Civil Action No. 10-2120 (JEB)\n\nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND\nHUMAN SERVICES, et al.,\n       Defendants.\n\n\n                                 MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n       Plaintiffs, who are the National Whistleblower Center and six current and former\n\nemployees of Defendant Department of Health and Human Services, have brought this action to\n\ngain access to records related to the individuals’ employment with that Agency. Plaintiffs’\n\nSecond Amended Complaint challenges the decisions of various HHS components and other\n\nagencies to withhold documents, and it asserts claims under a variety of statutes including, but\n\nnot limited to, the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act, and the Administrative\n\nProcedure Act.\n\n       The records at issue in the parties’ current Cross-Motions for Partial Summary Judgment\n\nare contained in two investigative case files maintained by HHS’s Office of the Inspector\n\nGeneral. While OIG has already released hundreds of pages from these files to Plaintiffs, it has\n\nwithheld, in whole or in part, hundreds more, citing exemptions to disclosure under FOIA and\n\nthe Privacy Act. Through this Motion, Plaintiffs are now challenging a subset of OIG’s\n\nwithholding decisions, as well as the procedure HHS followed when processing their related\n\n\n\n                                                1\n\fadministrative appeals. Defendants oppose Plaintiffs’ Motion, arguing their withholdings and\n\nprocessing procedures are correct.\n\n       Having considered OIG’s sworn representations regarding the content of these withheld\n\nrecords and the necessity of withholding them, and having reviewed in camera many of the\n\nactual pages at issue, the Court now upholds the majority of OIG’s withholding decisions, but\n\nnot all. In addition, because the Court finds that Plaintiffs lack standing to bring their procedural\n\nclaims alleging OIG’s failure to adjudicate their appeals, summary judgment will be granted to\n\nDefendants on that claim.\n\nI.     Background\n\n       Plaintiffs Ewa Czerska, Paul Hardy, Julian Nicholas, Robert Smith, R. Lakshmi\n\nVishnuvajjala, and Nancy Wersto claim that they are witnesses, complainants, or targets of two\n\nHHS OIG investigations related to whistleblowing activities. Plfs. Mot. (ECF No. 14), Exh. A\n\n(Declaration of Kelly McClanahan), ¶ 5. They contend that these whistleblowing activities relate\n\nto HHS’s improper approval of medical devices. Plfs. Mot. at 2. Between July 26 and\n\nNovember 4, 2010, all individual Plaintiffs, in concert with the National Whistleblower Center,\n\nsubmitted requests under FOIA, 5 U.S.C. §552, et seq., and the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552a, et\n\nseq., for various records pertaining to their employment with HHS. Sec. Am. Compl., ¶¶ 17, 51,\n\n64, 102, 155, 168. Different agency components treated the requests differently. As to OIG,\n\nafter initially denying their requests under Exemption 7(A), on the ground that the files related to\n\nan ongoing investigation, it processed Plaintiffs’ requests and released to them over 800 pages of\n\nrelevant, non-exempt documents, some with redactions. See Def. Opp./Mot., Attach. 1\n\n(Declaration of Robin Brooks), ¶¶ 11-12, 18-19, 24-25, 30-31, 36-37, 43-44.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f          Plaintiffs filed this action on December 15, 2010, and have twice since amended their\n\nComplaint. The parties’ instant Cross-Motions for Partial Summary Judgment are limited to\n\nCounts 1, 6, 7, 12, 19, 20, and 28, which relate only to Plaintiffs’ requests for documents\n\nmaintained by HHS’s OIG and not any other component.1 The documents at issue in these\n\ncounts are contained in two OIG Investigative Case Files: H-08-20505-3 and H-10-00248-3.\n\nFile H-08-20505-3 (H-08) contains documents relating to OIG’s “investigation into managerial\n\nmisconduct [at FDA] based on Plaintiffs’ allegations.” Plfs. Opp. (ECF No. 68) at 3. File H-10-\n\n00248-3 (H-10) contains documents relating to OIG’s investigation into Plaintiffs’ “alleged\n\nunauthorized disclosure of confidential information.” Id. at 4. See Defendant HHS’s Statement\n\nof Material Facts as to Which there Is No Genuine Issue, ¶¶ 4, 6; Plaintiffs’ Response to\n\nDefendants’ Statement of Material Facts, ¶¶ 4, 6.\n\n          OIG initially released 481 pages in full and 25 pages with redactions from File H-08.\n\nBrooks Decl., ¶ 49. Another 366 pages were released in full and 5 pages were released with\n\nredactions from File H-10. Id., ¶ 73. HHS withheld in full 839 pages and 52 pages, respectively,\n\nfrom those two files under FOIA Exemptions 4, 5, 6, 7(C), and 7(E). Id., Exhs. 15-16 (Vaughn\n\nIndices 1-2). Finally, OIG referred 182 pages to the Food and Drug Administration (the original\n\ncreator of the documents) for consultation. See Defs. Supp. Mot. (ECF No. 59) at 3; Plfs. Opp.\n\nat 2-3.\n\n          Plaintiffs initially filed the Motion for Partial Summary Judgment now at issue on April\n\n27, 2011, in conjunction with a Motion for Preliminary Injunction. Defendants opposed\n\nPlaintiffs’ Motions and cross-moved for summary judgment on May 18, 2011. On June 3, the\n\n\n1\n  Plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed Count 27, a FOIA/Privacy Act claim against OIG for “failure to perform\nsearches.” See Sec. Am. Compl., ¶¶ 209-216; Plfs. Opp. at 6. Following OIG’s performance in June-August 2011\nof an additional search for records responsive to their requests, “Plaintiffs stipulate that Defendants’ search for OIG\nrecords was adequate and offer no challenge on that issue.” Plfs. Opp. at 6. Count 27 is thus dismissed.\n\n                                                           3\n\fCourt stayed briefing on Defendants’ Cross-Motion pending a ruling on Plaintiffs’ Motion for\n\nPreliminary Injunction. Plaintiffs’ filed their Reply on June 10. Following a hearing on June 20,\n\nthe Court, two days later, denied Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief and lifted the stay on\n\nDefendants’ Cross-Motion. See Order Denying Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\n\n(ECF No. 28).\n\n       Since initially filing their Cross-Motions, the parties have worked cooperatively to\n\nnarrow the areas of their disagreement. On June 23, 2011, OIG completed its consultation\n\nregarding the 182 pages at issue that had originated with FDA and released to Plaintiffs an\n\nadditional 51 complete pages and 73 pages with redactions, while withholding 58 pages. See\n\nDefs. Supp. Mot. at 3. At this time OIG also released an additional 35 pages to Plaintiffs,\n\nincluding all withholdings from File H-10 previously made under Exemption 7(E). See Joint\n\nNotice Regarding Modification of Exemption 7(E) Withholdings (ECF No. 29) at 1.\n\n       Some time in June 2011, OIG began an additional search to confirm that all records\n\nresponsive to Plaintiffs’ requests were in fact contained in Investigative Files H-08 and H-10.\n\nSee Defs. Supp. Mot. at 2. During this search, additional responsive documents were located in\n\nboxes in the case agent’s office. Id. at 3. OIG’s FOIA Officer, Robin Brooks, determined that\n\n923 pages were responsive to Plaintiffs’ requests. Id. On August 30 and September 2, 2011,\n\nOIG released to Plaintiff an additional 312 pages in their entirety, released 289 pages with\n\nredactions, and withheld in their entirety 322 pages located during this additional search. Id.\n\n       On September 26, Defendants filed a Supplement to their Cross-Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment in order to address the withholding of the documents discovered during OIG’s\n\nadditional search and those initially referred to FDA for consultation, as well as to address\n\nCounts 27 and 28. (ECF No. 59). Plaintiffs filed their Opposition to Defendants’ Motion and\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fSupplement on October 26, and Defendants filed a Reply on November 16. The Motions are\n\nnow ripe.\n\n         Throughout their briefing, the parties have – admirably, in the Court’s opinion –\n\ncontinued to work together to narrow their disputes. Plaintiffs have agreed, for the purpose of\n\nthese Motions, to limit the list of OIG withholdings that they seek to contest. The withholdings\n\nPlaintiffs presently oppose are:\n\n            From Investigative File H-08-20505-3:\n\n                  o Withheld in part: Pages 1, 9, 25, 48, 49, 52, 53, 135, and 207-212*.2\n                  o Withheld in full: Pages 6, 11-13, 15-16, 18-19, 21, 24, 28-47, 50-51, 54-57,\n                    60, 62-63, 68-93, 94-101, and 217-234*.\n\n            From Investigative File H-10-00248-3:\n\n                  o Withheld in part: Pages 3-5*, 6-10*, 14-40*, 551*, and 553.\n                  o Withheld in full: Pages 42-54*, 126-27, 447, 450-51, 498-503, 543-44, 554-\n                    55, and 558-59.\n\n            Additional Search (AS) Records3:\n\n                  o Withheld in part: Pages 77-81, 83-87, 93-98, 106-114, 115, 197-98, 199, 289-\n                    96, 378, 381-82, 392-94, 705, 770, 774-78, 784, 806, and 828-29.\n                  o Withheld in full: Pages 20-29, 31, 33, 36-48, 66, 74-76, 264, 274, 276, 278-\n                    80, 324, 390, and 427-635.\n\nSee Plfs. Opp. at 3-4.\n\n         Plaintiffs are “also voluntarily removing from controversy any challenge to the\n\nwithholding of any names, titles, phone numbers, social security numbers, office numbers, and\n\ncomparable Personally Identifiable Information (‘PII’) that may be located in the above indicated\n\npages.” Plfs. Opp. at 6. Plaintiffs note, however, that “this concession is made with the caveat\n\n\n\n2\n  Pages with asterisks denote those that originated with FDA and were initially referred there for consultation prior\nto OIG making a final FOIA determination.\n3\n  OIG describes these records as being “part of investigation numbers H-08-20505-3 and H-10-00248-3.” Plfs. Opp.\nat 3 (emphasis in original); see also Defs. Reply at 5.\n\n                                                         5\n\fthat Plaintiffs narrowly define PII as just these types of unique identifiers, as opposed to . . .\n\nanything that could be used to identify a person.” Id. (emphasis added). As an example,\n\nPlaintiffs challenge the notion that “the fact that [an individual] was in a particular meeting and\n\nthat Plaintiffs would be able to use that information to deduce the person’s identity based on the\n\nfact that they knew who was present at that meeting” qualifies as personally identifiable\n\ninformation exempt from disclosure. Id.\n\n        In order to more accurately evaluate OIG’s withholding decisions, on March 13 and 20,\n\n2012, the Court ordered OIG to submit for in camera review 279 pages that the Agency contends\n\nare exempt from disclosure, along with a declaration further explaining the non-public nature of\n\nthe law-enforcement techniques withheld under Exemption 7(E). OIG complied with these\n\norders, and the Court has reviewed the documents in question.\n\n        While Counts 1, 6, 7, 12, 19, and 20 all relate to Plaintiffs’ challenges to specific OIG\n\nwithholdings, Count 28 – “Failure to Adjudicate Appeals” – is procedural in nature. See Sec.\n\nAm. Compl., ¶¶ 217-225. Here Plaintiffs state: “Each time Plaintiffs filed an administrative\n\nappeal challenging the blanket exemptions initially invoked by OIG, HHS did not adjudicate the\n\nappeal. Instead, OIG opened a new FOIA/PA request with a new Request Number, and HHS\n\ndismissed the pending appeal as moot. Upon information and belief, this activity represents an\n\nongoing policy or practice.” Id., ¶ 218. “By failing to adjudicate Plaintiffs’ appeals of these\n\nblanket withholdings,” they allege, “HHS effectively ensured that the blanket withholdings could\n\nnot be reversed administratively or undergo judicial review.” Id., ¶ 219. Plaintiffs contend that\n\n“[a] policy or practice that intentionally avoids appellate or judicial review of withholding\n\ndecisions is in violation of FOIA and the Privacy Act,” and is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of\n\ndiscretion, or otherwise contrary to law.” Id., ¶ 220. As relief Plaintiffs seek a declaratory order\n\n\n\n                                                   6\n\fthat “HHS is in violation of its statutory responsibilities under 5 U.S.C. § 552, 552a and an\n\ninjunction compelling Defendant HHS pursuant to those statutes to cease the practice of opening\n\nnew FOIA/PA requests instead of properly adjudicating administrative appeals of denials.” Id., ¶\n\n225.\n\nII.    Legal Standard\n\n        Summary judgment may be granted if “the movant shows that there is no genuine\n\ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 56(a); see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48 (1986);\n\nHolcomb v. Powell, 433 F.3d 889, 895 (D.C. Cir. 2006). “A party asserting that a fact cannot be\n\nor is genuinely disputed must support the assertion by citing to particular parts of materials in the\n\nrecord.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A). The moving party bears the burden of demonstrating the\n\nabsence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986).\n\n“[A] material fact is ‘genuine’ . . . if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a\n\nverdict for the nonmoving party” on an element of the claim. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. at\n\n248. Factual assertions in the moving party’s affidavits or declarations may be accepted as true\n\nunless the opposing party submits his own affidavits, declarations, or documentary evidence to\n\nthe contrary. Neal v. Kelly, 963 F.2d 453, 456 (D.C. Cir. 1992).\n\n       FOIA cases typically and appropriately are decided on motions for summary judgment.\n\nDefenders of Wildlife v. U.S. Border Patrol, 623 F. Supp. 2d 83, 87 (D.D.C. 2009); Bigwood v.\n\nUnited States Agency for Int'l Dev., 484 F. Supp. 2d 68, 73 (D.D.C. 2007). A defendant agency\n\nseeking summary judgment in a FOIA case must demonstrate that no material facts are in\n\ndispute, that it has conducted an adequate search for responsive records, and that each responsive\n\nrecord that it has located has been produced to the plaintiff or is exempt from disclosure.\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fStudents Against Genocide v. U.S. Dep’t of State, 257 F.3d 828, 833 (D.C. Cir. 2001). In a\n\nFOIA case, the Court may grant summary judgment based solely on information provided in an\n\nagency’s affidavits or declarations if they are relatively detailed and “describe the documents and\n\nthe justifications for nondisclosure with reasonably specific detail, demonstrate that the\n\ninformation withheld logically falls within the claimed exemption, and are not controverted by\n\neither contrary evidence in the record nor by evidence of agency bad faith.” Military Audit\n\nProject v. Casey, 656 F.2d 724, 738 (D.C. Cir. 1981). Such affidavits or declarations are\n\naccorded “a presumption of good faith, which cannot be rebutted by ‘purely speculative claims\n\nabout the existence and discoverability of other documents.’” SafeCard Servs., Inc. v. Sec. &\n\nExch. Comm’n, 926 F.2d 1197, 1200 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (quoting Ground Saucer Watch, Inc. v.\n\nCIA, 692 F.2d 770, 771 (D.C. Cir. 1981)).\n\nIII.   Analysis\n\n       As narrowed by the parties, there are now three questions to be decided here. First,\n\nalthough OIG has released many pages to Plaintiffs, it nonetheless asserts a blanket privilege\n\nunder the Privacy Act for those documents it has withheld. Is this blanket privilege proper?\n\nSecond, even if proper under the Privacy Act, are the particular withholdings also appropriate\n\nunder FOIA? Plaintiffs’ entitlement to access records under each of these Acts “is available\n\nwithout regard to exemptions under the other”; therefore, in order to withhold the documents\n\nPlaintiffs seek, OIG “must demonstrate that the documents fall within some exemption under\n\neach Act.” Martin v. Office of Special Counsel, MSPB, 819 F.2d 1181, 1184 (D.C. Cir. 1987)\n\n(emphasis in original). Third and finally, did OIG correctly handle Plaintiffs’ administrative\n\nappeals under FOIA?\n\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\f        A.      Privacy Act\n\n        The Privacy Act requires that\n\n             [e]ach agency that maintains a system of records shall . . . upon request by\n             any individual to gain access to his record or to any information pertaining\n             to him which is contained in the system, permit him . . . to review the\n             record and have a copy made of all or any portion thereof in a form\n             comprehensible to him . . . .\n\n5 U.S.C. § 552a(d)(1). The Act, however, also identifies certain general and specific exemptions\n\nfrom this requirement. See id., §§ 552a(d)(5), (j)-(k). In the present case, Defendants invoke §\n\n552a(k)(2). Under this exemption, OIG may withhold the documents Plaintiffs seek under the\n\nPrivacy Act if HHS has properly promulgated a rule that exempts from disclosure the system of\n\nrecords in which they are maintained. See 5 U.S.C. § 552a(k). Whether HHS has done so is\n\nwhere the first dispute lies.\n\n                1.      Proper Promulgation of Rule\n\n        HHS contends that the records at issue in this case – namely, those contained in Files H-\n\n08 and H-10 – are exempt because they are maintained in OIG’s “civil and administrative\n\ninvestigative files” records system, and HHS has promulgated a rule, 45 C.F.R. §\n\n5b.11(b)(2)(ii)(D), exempting such files from the Privacy Act’s access provisions. See Defs.\n\nOpp./Mot. (ECF No. 18) at 35-36 (citing Brooks Decl., ¶ 7). In light of this rule, Defendants\n\nargue, OIG need not have processed Plaintiffs’ records requests under the Privacy Act.\n\n        Plaintiffs argue first, and in vain, that 45 C.F.R. § 5b.11(b)(2)(ii)(D) was improperly\n\npromulgated and, consequently, that OIG’s civil and administrative investigative files have not\n\nbeen successfully exempted from the Privacy Act. See, e.g., Plfs. Reply (ECF No. 26) at 5-7.\n\nTheir argument is based on the last provision of § 552a(k), which states that “[a]t the time rules\n\nare adopted under this subsection, the agency shall include in the statement required under\n\nsection 553(c) of this title, the reasons why the system of records is to be exempt from a\n                                                  9\n\fprovision of this section.” They argue that § 5b.11(b)(2)(ii)(D) fails to comply with this\n\nrequirement and is thus invalid.\n\n       Plaintiffs concede that “HHS included its reasons for exempting the OIG Civil/\n\nAdministrative Records System when it published a Final Rule in the Federal Register.” Plfs.\n\nReply at 6 (citing 47 Fed. Reg. 57040 (Dec. 22, 1982)). In fact, the Final Rule advises that\n\nOIG’s Civil and Administrative Investigative Files were exempted “[i]n order to maintain the\n\nintegrity of the OIG investigative process and to assure that the OIG will be able to obtain access\n\nto complete and accurate information” and explains that this records system\n\n           will contain sensitive investigative records, the release of which could\n           impede on-going investigations, violate the privacy rights of individuals\n           other than the subjects of the investigations, reveal the identifies of\n           confidential sources, or otherwise impair the ability of the Office of\n           Inspector General to conduct civil and administrative investigations. For\n           these reasons, the Department is exempting this system, under subsection\n           (k)(2) of the Privacy Act, from the notification, access, correction and\n           amendment provisions of the Privacy Act.\n\n47 Fed. Reg. 57040. Nor do Plaintiffs contest the sufficiency of these reasons. Rather, they\n\nargue that because HHS’s statement of reasons appears only in the Federal Register, and not in\n\nthe Code of Federal Regulations where the rule was eventually codified at 45 C.F.R. §\n\n5b.11(b)(2)(ii)(D), subsection (k) is not satisfied. Plaintiffs’ interpretation of subsection (k) and,\n\nmore to the point, section 553(c) demands too much.\n\n       Subsection (k)(2) requires only that an agency’s rule exempting investigative material\n\ncomply with the Administrative Procedure Act’s requirement that “the agency shall incorporate\n\nin the rules adopted a concise general statement of their basis and purpose.” 5 U.S.C. § 553(c).\n\nContrary to Plaintiffs’ position, see Plfs. Reply at 6-7 n.3, § 553(c) is satisfied when a statement\n\nof the rule’s basis and purpose is included in the preamble to the Final Rule appearing in the\n\nFederal Register. That is the case here.\n\n\n                                                  10\n\f       The regulations and case law interpreting § 553(c) indicate that compliance with the\n\n“basis and purpose” requirement is an essential part of a rule’s preamble. For example, 1 C.F.R.\n\n§ 18.12 requires that “[e]ach agency submitting a proposed or final rule document for publication\n\nshall prepare a preamble which will inform the reader, who is not an expert in the subject area, of\n\nthe basis and purpose for the rule or proposal.” Id. (emphasis added). The D.C. Circuit has\n\nmade clear that when a rule’s preamble contains an adequate statement of the rule’s basis and\n\npurpose, the requirement of § 533(c) is satisfied. See In re Surface Mining Regulations\n\nLitigation, 627 F.2d 1346, 1354 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (“The preamble to the final interim regulations\n\nsatisfies the mandate of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. s 553(c), that rules adopted\n\nincorporate ‘a concise general statement of their basis and purpose.’”). Section 4(b) of the APA,\n\ncodified at § 533(c), the D.C. Circuit has explained,\n\n           provides that the statement of “basis and purpose” shall be incorporated\n           “in the rules.” Since the rules must be published . . . a statement of “basis\n           and purpose” can be “incorporated in the rules” only if it too is published.\n           We do not mean to suggest, however, that a [§] 4(b) statement must be\n           published at precisely the same moment as the regulations. The agency\n           must be allowed some latitude for technical difficulties. The enquiry must\n           be whether the rules and statement are published close enough together in\n           time so that there is no doubt that the statement accompanies, rather than\n           rationalizes the rules.\n\nTabor v. Joint Board for Enrollment of Actuaries, 566 F.2d 705, 711 n.14 (D.C. Cir. 1977).\n\n       As the reasons for HHS’s rule exempting OIG’s civil and administrative investigative\n\nfiles from the Privacy Act’s access provisions sufficiently appear in the preamble to the Final\n\nRule in the Federal Register, OIG has complied with § 553(c). These files, including those at\n\nissue in this case, therefore, are generally exempt from the Privacy Act.\n\n               2.      Denial of Right, Privilege, or Benefit\n\n       Section 552a(k)(2) makes clear, however, that even files contained in an exempt system\n\nof records must be disclosed under the Privacy Act “if any individual is denied any right,\n                                                11\n\fprivilege, or benefit that he would otherwise be entitled by Federal law, or for which he would\n\notherwise be eligible, as a result of the maintenance of such material.” Plaintiffs contend that\n\neven if OIG’s records-system exemption was properly promulgated, they have a right to access\n\nthe documents contained in File H-10 under this exception. In other words, they claim they\n\nsuffered adverse employment actions as a result of the maintenance of such material. See Notice\n\nof Filing of Additional Exhibits and of Additional Authority (dated June 20, 2011) (ECF No. 27)\n\n(with attachments: “Czerska Notice of Proposed Removal,” “Hardy Notice of Non-Duty Status,”\n\n“Vishnuvajjala Memo of Caution”). This argument fares no better.\n\n       OIG disputes that any employment actions taken against Plaintiffs occurred as a result of\n\nthe maintenance of Investigative File H-10. The results of that investigation, OIG attests,\n\nproduced “no evidence of prohibited personnel practices, retaliation, or other violations of law.\n\nAny administrative action taken by the FDA against the individual plaintiffs was separate from\n\nOIG’s two investigations, was at FDA’s discretion, and was not as a result of OIG’s maintenance\n\nof records in the two investigation files at issue in this case.” Brooks Decl., ¶ 9. All Plaintiffs\n\noffer in contradiction is an email from the OIG Assistant Special Agent in Charge of the\n\ninvestigation to the FDA Director of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH),\n\nwhere Plaintiffs worked. This email states: “Your office indicated it had developed sufficient\n\nevidence to address the alleged misconduct through administrative processes . . . .” Plfs. Mot. at\n\n15. Despite Plaintiffs’ reliance on it, when it is considered in light of OIG’s findings of no\n\nmisconduct, this email actually supports OIG. In other words, OIG is pointing out that FDA will\n\nhandle Plaintiffs’ misconduct through FDA’s administrative processes. In sum, OIG’s\n\nmaintenance of its investigative files did not cause Plaintiffs to be denied rights or benefits;\n\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\finstead, FDA’s maintenance of its own investigative files resulted in any adverse employment\n\nactions suffered by Plaintiffs.\n\n        Plaintiffs nevertheless contend that Plaintiff Czerska was terminated by FDA in part\n\nbased on “‘evidence that OIG obtained during its investigation.’” Plfs. Opp. at 14 (quoting Defs.\n\nOpp./Mot. at 32). They contend that § (k)(2) should be read such that if one agency (FDA) took\n\nadministrative action against an employee based on records or documents collected by another\n\nagency (OIG) during its own investigation, the files must be disclosed. Yet, as the email\n\ndemonstrates, FDA took action based on its collection of evidence, not OIG’s. Finally, Plaintiffs\n\nargue that FDA’s actions and OIG’s maintenance of its investigative files are both attributable to\n\ntheir parent agency, HHS. The Court need not decide this issue now because Plaintiff has sought\n\nthe same documents from FDA itself. The Court will thus address the FDA issue when it is\n\npresented. The Court otherwise concludes that Plaintiffs cannot access File H-10 under the cited\n\nexception to subsection (k)(2) because OIG’s investigation resulted in no denial of benefit to\n\nPlaintiffs.\n\n        Because the undisputed facts show that OIG is entitled to withhold the documents\n\nPlaintiffs seek under the Privacy Act, the Court now moves to consider whether withholding is\n\nappropriate under FOIA.\n\n        B.     FOIA\n\n        FOIA provides that “each agency, upon any request for records which (i) reasonably\n\ndescribes such records and (ii) is made in accordance with published rules . . . , shall make the\n\nrecords promptly available to any person.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3)(A). Consistent with this\n\nstatutory mandate, federal courts have jurisdiction to order the production of records that an\n\nagency improperly withholds. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B); U.S. Dep’t of Justice v. Reporters\n\n\n\n                                                13\n\fComm. for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749, 755 (1989). “Unlike the review of other agency\n\naction that must be upheld if supported by substantial evidence and not arbitrary and capricious,\n\nthe FOIA expressly places the burden ‘on the agency to sustain its action’ and directs the district\n\ncourts to ‘determine the matter de novo.’” Reporters Comm., 489 U.S. at 755 (quoting 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(a)(4)(B)). “At all times, courts must bear in mind that FOIA mandates a ‘strong\n\npresumption in favor of disclosure . . . .’” Nat’l Ass’n of Home Builders v. Norton, 309 F.3d 26,\n\n32 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (quoting U.S. Dep’t of State v. Ray, 502 U.S. 164, 173 (1991)).\n\n        Congress exempted nine categories of documents from FOIA’s broad sweep. “[T]he\n\nstatutory exemptions, which are exclusive, are to be ‘narrowly construed.’” Id. (quoting Dep’t of\n\nAir Force v. Rose, 425 U.S. 352, 361 (1976)). This case turns on the application of Exemptions\n\n5, 6, 7(C), and 7(E).4\n\n        In evaluating the propriety of OIG’s withholding decisions, the Court has reviewed and\n\nrelies in part on the Declaration and Supplemental Declaration of OIG’s FOIA Officer, Robin\n\nBrooks, see Def. Opp./Mot., Attach. 1; Def. Supp. Mot., Exh. 1, as well as the four Vaughn\n\nIndices the government has filed with their briefs. See Brooks Decl., Exh. 15 (index for File H-\n\n08 initial withholdings, hereinafter Vaughn Index 1); Brooks Decl., Exh. 16 (index for File H-10\n\ninitial withholdings, hereinafter Vaughn Index 2); Brooks Supp. Decl., Exh. 4 (index for\n\ndocuments found during OIG’s additional search, hereinafter Vaughn Index 3); Brooks Supp.\n\nDecl., Exh. 5 (index for documents initially referred to FDA for consultation, hereinafter Vaughn\n\nIndex 4). In addition, the Court has conducted its own in camera review of a substantial subset\n\n\n\n4\n At this time, Plaintiffs do not challenge OIG’s withholdings under Exemption 4. See Defs. Reply (ECF No. 74) at\n1 (noting that Plaintiffs’ briefs do not address Exemption 4 withholdings). For this reason, the Court need not now\ndecide whether portions of the following documents were improperly withheld: H-08 pages 207-12, 217-34; H-10\npages 3-5, 14-40; and the Exemption 4 redactions to AS 77-81.\n\n\n                                                        14\n\fof the withheld documents at issue, which OIG has provided. These documents consist of: 1)\n\nFile H-08 pages 9, 54-57, and 62-63; 2) File H-10 pages 126-27, 447, 450-51, 498-503, 543-44,\n\n553, and 554-55; and 3) Additional Search pages AS 20-29, 31, 33, 36-48, 66, 74-76, 264, 274,\n\n276, 278-79, 324, 378, 381-82, 390, 392-94, 427-635, 705, 770, 784, and 806. Finally, the\n\nCourt has also reviewed in camera a declaration explaining the non-public nature of the law-\n\nenforcement techniques withheld under FOIA Exemption 7(E).\n\n               1.      Exemptions 6 and 7(C)\n\n       Because the majority of the pages Plaintiffs assert should be released to them were\n\nwithheld at least in part based on FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C), the Court will consider first\n\nwhether these exemptions were properly applied. OIG invokes Exemptions 6 and 7(C) for all\n\ndocuments withheld in full and almost all partial redactions from File H-08, all but two pages\n\nwithheld from File H-10, and the majority of pages withheld from the additional search (AS)\n\ndocuments.\n\n       Exemption 6 protects “personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of\n\nwhich would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” 5 U.S.C. §\n\n552(b)(6). Exemption 7(C) excludes “records of information compiled for law enforcement\n\npurposes . . . to the extent that production of such law enforcement records or information . . .\n\ncould reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” Id. §\n\n552(b)(7)(C). Both provisions require agencies and reviewing courts to “balance the privacy\n\ninterests that would be compromised by disclosure against the public interest in the release of the\n\nrequested information.” Beck v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 997 F.2d 1489, 1491 (D.C. Cir. 1993)\n\n(quoting Davis v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 968 F.2d 1276, 1281 (D.C. Cir. 1992)).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 15\n\f       Although both exemptions require agencies and reviewing courts to undertake the same\n\nweighing of interests, the balance tilts more strongly toward nondisclosure in the context of\n\nExemption 7(C) because “Exemption 7(C)’s privacy language is broader than the comparable\n\nlanguage in Exemption 6 in two respects.” Reporters Comm., 489 U.S. at 756. First, Exemption\n\n6 encompasses “clearly unwarranted” invasions of privacy, while Exemption 7(C) omits the\n\nadverb “clearly.” See id. Second, Exemption 6 prevents disclosures that “would constitute” an\n\ninvasion of privacy, while Exemption 7(C) targets disclosures that “could reasonably be\n\nexpected to constitute” such an invasion. See id. Both differences are the result of specific\n\namendments, reflecting Congress’s conscious choice to provide greater protection to law-\n\nenforcement materials than to personnel, medical, and other similar files. See id. Courts have\n\naccordingly held that Exemption 7(C) “establishes a lower bar for withholding material” than\n\nExemption 6. ACLU v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 655 F.3d 1, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2011); see also Beck, 997\n\nF.2d at 1491.\n\n       As a result, if the records and information OIG seeks to withhold in this case were\n\n“compiled for law enforcement purposes,” the Court need only address whether the agency has\n\nproperly withheld these documents under Exemption 7(C). While Defendants maintain Files H-\n\n08 and H-10 meet this threshold requirement, Plaintiffs contend they do not. On this point\n\nDefendants are correct.\n\n                      a. Law-Enforcement Purposes\n\n       In Jefferson v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Office of Professional Responsibility, 284 F.3d 172\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2002), the D.C. Circuit summarized the law governing application of Exemption 7’s\n\nrequirement that the records in question be compiled for law-enforcement purposes. In\n\nperforming this analysis, “the focus is on how and under what circumstances the requested files\n\n\n\n                                                16\n\fwere compiled, . . . and ‘whether the files sought relate to anything that can fairly be\n\ncharacterized as an enforcement proceeding.’” Id. at 176-77 (citing Weisberg v. U.S. Dep’t of\n\nJustice, 489 F.2d 1195, 1202 (D.C. Cir. 1973); quoting Aspin v. U.S. Dep’t of Defense, 491 F.2d\n\n24, 27 (D.C. Cir. 1973)). The court reiterated its identification of two categories of investigative\n\nfiles that government agencies compile: “(1) files in connection with government oversight of\n\nthe performance of duties by its employees, and (2) files in connection with investigations that\n\nfocus directly on specific alleged illegal acts which could result in civil or criminal sanctions.”\n\nJefferson, 284 F.3d at 177 (citing Rural Housing Alliance v. U.S. Dep’t of Agriculture, 498 F.2d\n\n73, 81 (D.C. Cir. 1974)).\n\n        Exemption 7 does not exempt “[i]nternal agency investigations . . . in which an agency,\n\nacting as the employer, simply supervises its own employees.” Stern v. F.B.I., 737 F.2d 84, 89\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1984). On the other hand, “an agency’s investigation of its own employees is for ‘law\n\nenforcement purposes’ . . . if it focuses directly on specifically alleged illegal acts, illegal acts of\n\nparticular identified officials, acts which could, if proved, result in civil or criminal sanctions.”\n\nId. (quoting Rural Housing Alliance, 498 F.2d at 81); see also Kimberlin v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice,\n\n139 F.3d 944, 947 (D.C. Cir. 1998). Exemption 7 is thus triggered when “‘the files sought relate\n\nto anything that can fairly be characterized as an enforcement proceeding.’” Jefferson, 284 F.3d\n\nat 177 (quoting Aspin v. U.S. Dep’t of Defense, 491 F.2d 24, 27 (D.C. Cir. 1973)).\n\n        The documents contained in both Investigative Files H-10 and H-08 qualify as records\n\ncompiled for law-enforcement purposes. File H-10 was compiled to “investigat[e] allegations\n\nagainst plaintiffs, Hardy, Smith, and Czerska, of unauthorized disclosure of information in\n\npotential violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1905.” Brooks Decl., ¶ 8. File H-08 was compiled to:\n\n            investigat[e] specific allegations from certain [FDA] employees, including\n            individual plaintiffs, about certain managers at the FDA Center for\n\n                                                   17\n\f           Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), regarding allegations that those\n           managers engaged in misconduct relating to the scientific review of\n           applications for pre-market approval or clearance of radiological devices,\n           allegations that those managers violated an FDA regulation, 21 C.F.R §\n           10.70, concerning the documentation of significant decisions in the\n           administrative file, and allegations that those managers retaliated against\n           the complainants.\n\nId. In other words, the records in both investigative files were compiled to investigate\n\nallegations that specific individuals at FDA had engaged in specific acts that could constitute\n\nviolations of criminal and civil laws. This is not a case involving personnel files maintained in\n\nthe ordinary course of monitoring employees’ performance at an agency. Instead, these files\n\nwere compiled to carry out investigations in response to specific allegations with the potential to\n\nlead to enforcement actions against the targets.\n\n       It is of no moment that both investigations resulted in findings of no misconduct and that\n\nno sanctions were ultimately imposed by OIG. See Center for National Policy Review on Race\n\nand Urban Issues v. Weinberger, 502 F.2d 370, 373 (D.C. Cir. 1974) (“For a file to be deemed to\n\nhave been compiled for law enforcement purposes it is not necessary that an adjudication have\n\nbeen imminent or even likely, either at the time the material was amassed or at the time\n\ndisclosure is sought under the FOIA.”). Exemption 7 is “applicable to material amassed in\n\nconnection with an enforcement proceeding that [is] merely ‘conceivable.’ Likelihood of\n\nadjudication is not the decisive determinant of whether a file has been compiled for law\n\nenforcement purposes.” Id.\n\n       The facts underlying Investigation H-10 are on all fours with Kimberlin v. U.S. Dep’t of\n\nJustice, 139 F.3d 944 (D.C. Cir. 1998), in which the D.C. Circuit found that the records at issue\n\nwere compiled for law-enforcement purposes. Id. at 947-48. That case, as does this one,\n\ninvolved an “investigation . . . conducted in response to and focused upon a specific, potentially\n\nillegal release of information by a particular, identified official.” Id. at 947. The Kimberlin\n                                                   18\n\finvestigation, as is true for both investigations in the present case, “was not aiming generally. . .\n\n‘to insure that [the agency’s] employees are acting in accordance with statutory mandate and the\n\nagency’s own regulations.’” Id. at 948-49 (quoting Rural Housing Alliance, 498 F.2d at 81)\n\n(emphasis added). Defendants have thus satisfied their initial burden under Exemption 7 of\n\nshowing that the records Plaintiffs seek were compiled for law-enforcement purposes.\n\n                       b. Privacy Interests in Withholding\n\n       Exemption 7(C) allows for the withholding of records compiled for law-enforcement\n\npurposes if disclosure “could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of\n\npersonal privacy.” 5 U.S.C. § 552 (b)(7)(C). “To determine whether disclosure of certain\n\ninformation would constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy, the Court must balance the\n\npublic interest in disclosure against the privacy interest of the individual mentioned in the\n\nrecord.” Blanton v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 63 F. Supp. 2d 35, 45 (D.D.C. 1999).\n\n       The first step in the Exemption 7(C) analysis is to determine whether there is, in fact, a\n\nprivacy interest in the materials sought. See ACLU, 655 F.3d at 6. In this context, the Supreme\n\nCourt has rejected a “cramped notion of personal privacy” and emphasized that “privacy\n\nencompass[es] the individual’s control of information concerning his or her person.” Reporters\n\nComm., 489 U.S. at 763. To constitute a privacy interest under FOIA, the claimed interest must\n\nbe “substantial.” Multi Ag Media LLC v. USDA, 515 F.3d 1224, 1229-30 (D.C. Cir. 2008).\n\n“[S]ubstantial,” however, “means less than it might seem. A substantial privacy interest is\n\nanything greater than a de minimis privacy interest.” Id.\n\n       Individuals involved in law-enforcement investigations – including targets, witnesses,\n\ncomplainants, and investigators – have a privacy interest in the non-disclosure of their names and\n\nidentifying information. See Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility v. U.S. Secret\n\n\n\n                                                  19\n\fService, 72 F.3d 897, 904 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (“‘Exemption 7(C) takes particular note of the strong\n\ninterest of individuals, whether they be suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being\n\nassociated unwarrantedly with alleged criminal activity.’”) (quoting Dunkelberger v. U.S. Dep’t\n\nof Justice, 906 F.2d 779, 781 (D.C. Cir. 1990)). This protection extends to “‘persons who are not\n\nthe subjects of the investigation [but who] may nonetheless have their privacy invaded by having\n\ntheir identities and information about them revealed in connection with the investigation’”\n\nbecause disclosure of their identities “‘may result in embarrassment and harassment.’” Id.\n\n(quoting Burge v. Eastburn, 934 F.2d 577, 579 (5th Cir. 1991); McDonnell v. United States, 4\n\nF.3d 1227, 1255 (3d Cir. 1993)). Exemption 7(C) thus “affords broad[] privacy rights to\n\nsuspects, witnesses, and investigators.” Bast v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 665 F.2d 1251, 1254 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1981); see also SafeCard Services, Inc. v. SEC, 926 F.2d 1197, 1205 (D.C. Cir. 1991).\n\n       OIG invokes Exemption 7(C) as a basis for withholding nearly all of the documents that\n\nremain in dispute for purposes of this Motion. While Defendant has withheld some of these\n\ndocuments in full (including H-08 pages 6, 11-13, 15-16, 18-19, 21, 24, 28-47, 50-51, 54-57, 60-\n\n62-63, 68-93, and 94-101; H-10 pages 42-54, 447, 450-51, 498-503, 543-44, and 558-59; and AS\n\npages 20-29, 31, 33, 36-48, 66, 74-76, 264, 274, 276, 278-80, 324, 390, and 427-635), it has\n\nreleased others in part through the use of redactions to prevent the disclosure of personally\n\nidentifiable information (including H-08 pages 1, 9, 25, 48, 49, 52, 53, and 135; H-10 pages 6-\n\n10, 14-40, 551, and 553; and AS pages 77-81, 83-87, 93-98, 106-114, 115, 197, 199, 289, 378,\n\n381-82, 392-94, and 828-29).\n\n       The pages Plaintiffs contend OIG improperly withholds under this exemption fall into\n\none of three general categories: 1) documents – such as emails or exhibit logs – on which OIG\n\nhas excised personally identifiable information through the use of discrete redactions; 2)\n\n\n\n                                                 20\n\fdocuments – such as notes of witness interviews – that OIG has withheld in their entirety on the\n\nground that all of the information contained therein would reveal an individual’s identity; and 3)\n\ndocuments in which accusations and derogatory statements made against an individual, as well\n\nas that individual’s identity, have been redacted. The Court will consider the privacy interests at\n\nstake for each of these categories of documents.\n\n       In the first category, many of the withholdings under Exemption 7(C) were made, OIG\n\nattests, to protect the identities of the targets of, and the witnesses and law enforcement agents\n\nand officials who participated in, the two investigations at issue. Where this was accomplished\n\nmerely by redacting a name, title, phone number, office number, or comparable personally\n\nidentifiable information, Plaintiffs do not object to the withholding. Plfs. Opp. at 21. This\n\nconcession thus ends the Court’s analysis of the pages where such limited redactions of personal\n\ninformation were made. OIG represents, and the Court’s review of the size and placement of the\n\nredactions on a number of the pages confirms, that redactions on the following pages were thus\n\nproperly withheld: H-08 pages 1, 48, 49, 52, 53, and 135; H-10 pages 551 and 552-53; and AS\n\npages 381-82 and 392-94.\n\n       Although H-10 pages 447 and 450-51, and AS page 390, were withheld in their entirety,\n\nthe Court’s in camera review of these documents confirms that, as described in Section\n\nIII(B)(3)(b), infra, the substance of these emails between OIG and either FDA or the Office of\n\nPublic Health and Science, or between employees of FDA, may be withheld under Exemption 5,\n\nleaving for Exemption 7(C) only the type of personal information Plaintiffs decline to challenge.\n\nSimilarly, while H-08 page 9 and AS page 392-94 contain substantial redactions under both\n\nExemption 5 and Exemption 7(C), the Court’s in camera review revealed that all substantive\n\ninformation redacted under both exemptions qualifies for withholding under Exemption 5, thus\n\n\n\n                                                 21\n\flimiting the use of Exemption 7(C) in this document to discrete personal information. No\n\ndispute remains, therefore, as to the Exemption 7(C) withholdings in these documents.\n\n       The second category of documents at issue here is a source of disagreement for the\n\nparties. These records, which include File H-08 pages 6, 11-13, 15-16, 18-19, 21, 24, 25, 28-47,\n\n50-51, 54-57, 60, 62-63, 68-93, and 94-101; H-10 pages 558-59; and AS pages 20-29, 31, 33, 36-\n\n48, 66, 74-76, 264, 274, 276, 278-80, 324, and 427-635, were withheld in their entirety (or in\n\nsubstantial part) under Exemption 7(C). According to OIG’s Vaughn Index and Robin Brooks’s\n\nDeclarations, and confirmed by the Court’s in camera review of the AS documents included in\n\nthis category, these pages consist of reports of conversations, reports of interviews, and\n\n“handwritten notes of OIG agents taken during witness interviews and handwritten notes of FDA\n\nemployees provided to OIG during OIG’s investigation[s].” Vaughn Index 3 at 3. OIG contends\n\nthese documents must be withheld in full under Exemption 7(C) “where it was not possible to\n\nreasonably segregate information, because the witnesses were known to the targets,” or where\n\nthe “third parties interviewed or investigated worked in the same office or agency and would be\n\neasily identifiable to the targets of the investigation, as well as [to] the plaintiffs.” Brooks Decl.,\n\n¶ 64. Plaintiffs argue OIG’s interpretation of Exemption 7(C) is overbroad in asserting “that\n\nentire records may be withheld under these exemptions because one or more Plaintiffs,\n\npossessing the specialized knowledge gleaned from having taken part in the investigations, may\n\nbe able to identify these individuals based on their testimony where a member of the public\n\nwould not.” Plfs. Opp. at 21.\n\n       Exemption 7(C) protects a qualifying individual’s privacy by exempting records and\n\ninformation that would reveal his or her identity from disclosure. Nothing in the language of the\n\nexemption limits such withholdings to names, social security numbers, phone numbers, and other\n\n\n\n                                                  22\n\fdiscrete personally identifiable information that Plaintiffs decline to challenge. The decisions of\n\nother courts that have considered this issue support OIG’s contention that “[w]hen the\n\ninformation in question concerns a small group of individuals who are known to each other and\n\neasily identifiable from the details contained in the information, redaction does not adequately\n\nprotect privacy interests.” Defs. Reply (ECF No. 74) at 12. For instance, Department of Air\n\nForce v. Rose, 425 U.S. 352 (1976), involved a FOIA request for case summaries of honor and\n\nethics hearings at a service academy with personal references and other identifying material\n\ndeleted. The Supreme Court observed in that case, however, that “what constitutes identifying\n\ninformation regarding a subject cadet must be weighed not only from the viewpoint of the public,\n\nbut also from the vantage of those who would have been familiar, as fellow cadets or Academy\n\nstaff, with other aspects of his career at the Academy.” Id. at 380. In other words, while the\n\nredaction of an individual’s name may be sufficient to protect his identity and privacy from the\n\npublic, it may not be sufficient so protect him in the smaller community of his school or work.\n\n       The Rose Court thus upheld the court of appeals instruction to the district court that, “if\n\nin its opinion deletion of personal references and other identifying information ‘is not sufficient\n\nto safeguard privacy, then the summaries should not be disclosed.’” 425 U.S. at 381 (citation\n\nomitted). The Tenth Circuit also applied this principle in Alirez v. NLRB, 676 F.2d 423 (10th\n\nCir. 1982). In that case, the “requested documents relate[d] to a few incidents involving about a\n\ndozen people. Even sanitized, these documents would enable Mr. Alirez, and others who had\n\nspecific knowledge of these incidents, to identify readily the informant and persons discussed in\n\neach document.” Id. at 427-28. For this reason, the court concluded that the “deletion of names\n\nand other identifying data ordered by the district court [was] inadequate to prevent serious\n\nprivacy invasions.” Id. at 427. These cases support OIG’s position that an entire document such\n\n\n\n                                                 23\n\fas a report or notes from a witness interview may be withheld in its entirety where disclosure\n\nwould allow other agency employees to identify the witness and thus constitute an unwarranted\n\ninvasion of privacy.\n\n       The Court here accepts OIG’s determination that the contents of the reports and notes\n\nlisted above, unless withheld in their entirety, would reveal the identity of a target or witness in\n\nOIG’s investigations. While the Court has reviewed some but not all of these documents,\n\nlacking the knowledge of an FDA insider, the Court is not in a position to make line-by-line\n\ndeterminations of which statements from a witness interview would expose the witness’s\n\nidentity. As the Ninth and Tenth Circuits have observed:\n\n           “The problems in undertaking to decide which portions of an employee's\n           statement may be released to his employer without revealing that\n           employee’s identity are enormous, if, indeed, not insoluble. Merely\n           deleting the name from the statement would not insure against\n           identification, since the employee’s narrative, or part of it, may be such\n           that the employer could identify the employee involved, or could narrow\n           the group down to two or three employees. Moreover, it is doubtful\n           whether the court could select which portions to release with the degree of\n           certainty required adequately to protect the interests of employees who\n           wish to avoid identification.”\n\nAlirez, 676 F.2d at 428 (quoting Harvey’s Wagon Wheel, Inc. v. NLRB, 91 L.R.R.M. 2410,\n\n2415 (N.D. Cal. 1976), remanded in part on other grounds, 550 F.2d 1139 (9th Cir. 1976)).\n\n       This deference to the government’s evaluation is warranted because this is not a case in\n\nwhich OIG has categorically withheld in full all documents for which it claims Exemption 7(C).\n\nOn the contrary, the record in this case contains numerous examples of places where OIG has\n\nmade use of targeted redactions to release documents to Plaintiffs without disclosing personally\n\nidentifiable information. OIG has attested that “all reasonably segregable, non-exempt\n\ninformation has been released,” and that where “records [were] withheld in their entirety, there\n\nwas no reasonably segregable material or non-exempt information amounted to essentially\n\n\n                                                 24\n\fmeaningless words and phrases.” Brooks Decl., ¶ 88; Brooks Supp. Decl., ¶ 19. The Court has\n\nno reason to doubt the veracity of these declarations. The fact that OIG has redacted and\n\nreleased many of the documents for which it claims Exemption 7(C) applies supports its\n\ndeclaration that it has only withheld the information necessary to protect the identities of the\n\ninvestigation’s targets, witness, and investigators. The Court’s partial in camera review, which\n\nrevealed general diligence and fairness on the part of OIG in selecting which information to\n\ndisclose and which information to withhold, provides no cause to question the government’s\n\napplication of the exemption to these documents. The Court therefore finds that the witness and\n\ninterview notes listed above all contain information to which significant privacy interests attach.\n\n       Third and finally, Plaintiffs also contest OIG’s decision to withhold under Exemption\n\n7(C) a category of information that the government describes as “accusations or derogatory\n\nstatements against specific individuals.” See Defs. Reply at 14 n.11; see also Plfs. Opp. at 23-24.\n\nThese records consist of H-10 pages 6-10, 14-40, and 42-54; and AS pages 77-81, 83-87, 93-98,\n\n106-114, 115, 197-98, 199, and 828-29. Id. With the exception of one document (H-10 42-54,\n\nfor which OIG also asserted Exemptions 4 and 5), all of these documents have been released to\n\nPlaintiffs in part, with limited redactions. Accusations and derogatory statements made against\n\nspecific individuals, if made public, can reasonably be expected to result in an intrusion on those\n\nindividuals’ personal privacy by causing embarrassment and reputational harm. See McCutchen\n\nv. Dep’t of Health and Human Services, 30 F.3d 183, 187-88 (D.C. Cir. 1994); Carter v. Dep’t of\n\nCommerce, 830 F.2d 388 (D.C. Cir. 1987). The subjects of these statements thus have a privacy\n\ninterest in the non-disclosure of accusations and derogatory statements made against them,\n\nparticularly when they have been found not to have officially committed any misconduct.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 25\n\fMcCutchen, 30 F.3d at 188 (finding HHS scientists accused of misconduct “who have been\n\ninvestigated and exonerated[] have a substantial privacy interest in remaining anonymous”).\n\n       Having found personal privacy interests in all of OIG’s Exemption 7(C) withholdings,\n\nthe Court must now evaluate the public interest in their disclosure.\n\n                       c. Public Interest in Disclosure\n\n       When evaluating the public interest in disclosure of information that implicates the\n\npersonal privacy of an individual mentioned in a law-enforcement record, it is the “‘interest of\n\nthe general public and not that of the private litigant’” that the Court must consider. Blanton v.\n\nU.S. Dep’t Justice, 63 F. Supp. 2d 35, 45 (D.D.C. 1999) (quoting Brown v. FBI, 658 F.2d 71, 75\n\n(2d Cir. 1981)). “[T]he only public interest relevant for purposes of Exemption 7(C) is one that\n\nfocuses on ‘the citizens’ right to be informed about what their government is up to.’” Davis v.\n\n968 F.2d at 1282 (quoting Reporters Comm., 489 U.S. at 773). The request must thus “have the\n\nobjective of obtaining a response that ‘sheds light on the conduct of [a] Government agency or\n\nofficial.’” Cuban v. SEC, 744 F. Supp. 2d 60, 87 (D.D.C. 2010) (quoting Reporters Comm., 489\n\nU.S. at 773).\n\n       Plaintiffs explain that they are currently involved in a public debate over “whether or not\n\nthe OIG investigations” – H-08 and H-10 – “were conducted properly.” Plfs. Opp. at 23\n\n(emphasis in original). “That purpose,” they explain, “is the driving force behind Plaintiffs’\n\nefforts to obtain the controverted information from these Case Files. Plaintiffs agree that the\n\nOIG reports found no misconduct. Plaintiffs (and a healthy number of politicians and reporters)\n\ndo not believe that the evidence inside the Case Files supports such a finding.” Id. (emphasis in\n\noriginal). In support of this asserted public interest, Plaintiffs have filed with the Court\n\nnumerous newspaper articles discussing a Congressional inquiry into whether the FDA illegally\n\n\n\n                                                  26\n\fsurveilled Plaintiffs’ personal email accounts and whether Plaintiffs were retaliated against for\n\nengaging in protected whistleblower activities. See ECF Nos. 80 and 88.\n\n       The public no doubt has an interest in knowing whether HHS OIG properly investigates\n\nallegations of misconduct by agency officials and whether this was done during Investigations\n\nH-08 and H-10. “[M]atters of substantive law enforcement policy are properly the subject of\n\npublic concern.” ACLU, 655 F.3d at 14 (quoting Reporters Comm., 489 U.S. at 766 n.18). For\n\nthis reason, “a request that seeks ‘information that would explain how [an agency’s] disciplinary\n\nprocedures actually functioned’ is permissible.” Cuban, 744 F. Supp. 2d at 87 (quoting\n\nReporters Comm., 489 U.S. at 773). As another court in this District described it, “There is a\n\ncompelling public interest in knowing whether the defendant [agency] conducts investigations\n\nfree of misconduct by its employees and how alleged transgressions by its employees are\n\naddressed.” Cuban, 744 F. Supp. 2d at 84.\n\n       In light of Plaintiffs’ stated purpose in seeking the information contained in the files for\n\ninvestigations H-08 and H-10, the Court finds that the public does have an interest in their\n\ndisclosure. The Court must now balance this public interest with the privacy interests implicated\n\nby disclosure.\n\n                       d. Balancing\n\n       The Supreme Court has explained the test to be applied when balancing private interests\n\nin non-disclosure with the public interest in obtaining the information withheld:\n\n           Where the privacy concerns addressed by Exemption 7(C) are present, the\n           exemption requires the person requesting the information to establish a\n           sufficient reason for the disclosure. First, the citizen must show that the\n           public interest sought to be advanced is a significant one, an interest more\n           specific than having the information for its own sake. Second, the citizen\n           must show the information is likely to advance that interest. Otherwise,\n           the invasion of privacy is unwarranted.\n\nNational Archives and Records Admin. v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157, 172 (2004).\n                                                27\n\f       As described above, the disputed documents withheld in this case under Exemption 7(C)\n\ncan be divided into two general categories based on the privacy interests at stake. At issue in the\n\nfirst category, consisting of reports and notes of conversations and interviews with witnesses or\n\nagency employees, is the witnesses’, employees’, and investigators’ privacy interest in not\n\nhaving their identities disclosed. The second category, which includes accusations and\n\nderogatory statements made about particular individuals, raises the same privacy concerns with\n\nrespect to the identities of the subjects of those accusations and statements. In addition, the\n\naccusations and derogatory statements themselves have been withheld in this second group. As\n\nthe privacy interests and public interest with respect to each category may be different, the Court\n\nwill conduct separate balancing analyses for each.\n\n                               i.      Disclosure of Identities\n\n       With respect to the documents OIG has withheld on the ground that release would\n\ndisclose the identities of targets, witnesses, or investigators who participated in the two\n\ninvestigations underlying Plaintiffs’ FOIA requests (H-08 pages 6, 11-13, 15-16, 18-19, 21, 24,\n\n25, 28-47, 50-51, 54-57, 60, 62-63, 68-93, and 94-101; and AS pages 20-29, 31, 33, 36-48, 66,\n\n74-76, 264, 276, 278-80, 324, and 427-635), the privacy interests of those individuals are\n\n“substantial.” See Bast, 665 F.2d at 1254; SafeCard Services, Inc. v. SEC, 926 F.2d 1197, 1205-\n\n06 (D.C. Cir. 1991). The D.C. Circuit has held “categorically that, unless access to the names\n\nand addresses of private individuals appearing in files within the ambit of Exemption 7(C) is\n\nnecessary in order to confirm or refute compelling evidence that the agency is engaged in illegal\n\nactivity, such information is exempt from disclosure.” SafeCard Services, 926 F.2d at 1206. In\n\nSafeCard Services, the D.C. Circuit rejected the plaintiff’s claim that “access to the names and\n\naddresses of potential witnesses or litigants in SEC stock manipulation investigations would\n\nprovide SafeCard and the public with insight into the SEC’s conduct with respect to SafeCard in\n                                                 28\n\fparticular and short selling practices in general,” noting that “the type of information sought is\n\nsimply not very probative of an agency’s behavior or performance.” Id. at 1205-06.\n\n        This case presents a slightly more complex problem than is involved in cases where an\n\nindividual’s identity can be protected merely by redacting discrete pieces of personally\n\nidentifiable information. In the records at issue here, as explained in Section III(B)(1)(b), supra,\n\nthe Court accepts OIG’s attestation that certain documents must be withheld in their entirety in\n\norder to protect an individual’s identity and thus privacy. In the process, however, the Court\n\nrecognizes that substantive information beyond names, titles, and phone numbers will likely also\n\nbe withheld in the name of privacy. This concern is not enough, however, to persuade the Court\n\nthat these documents must be released. This, again, is not a case in which the government has\n\ncategorically withheld all documents compiled for law-enforcement purposes in their entirety.\n\nOn the contrary, they have released many of the records that Plaintiffs sought in full and many\n\nmore with limited redactions. Thus even were the Court to find – which it does not – that\n\nPlaintiffs had presented compelling evidence that OIG engaged in illegal activity by improperly\n\ninvestigating their allegations of misconduct at FDA, they have not shown that disclosure of the\n\ndocuments at issue here – and, correspondingly, the identities of the particular individuals\n\ninvolved – would be necessary to confirm or refute such allegations. The Court therefore finds\n\nthat the privacy interests at stake outweigh the public interest in these records and that their\n\nrelease “could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal\n\nprivacy.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7). OIG thus properly withholds these documents under Exemption\n\n7(C).\n\n        The exception to this ruling relates to H-08 pages 54-57 and 62-63. OIG describes these\n\npages as “memoranda from OIG to FDA.” See Vaughn Index 1 at 5-6. Unlike the majority of\n\n\n\n                                                 29\n\fthe pages withheld here in their entirety under Exemption 7(C), the Court’s in camera review\n\nreveals that, rather than recording witness interviews or conversations, these pages are\n\nmemoranda from OIG seeking information from potential witnesses about a personnel matter\n\ninvolving one FDA employee, Sophie Paquerault, who signed a privacy waiver in connection\n\nwith Plaintiffs’ FOIA requests. See Plfs. Mot. at 18 n.10. While portions of H-08 pages 54-55\n\nand 62-63 may properly be redacted under Exemption 7(C), including the recipient’s name and\n\nother identifying information, other portions of these memoranda should be released, as the\n\npublic interest in the facts and questions contained therein is substantial, and the privacy interests\n\nimplicated by the questions and background material is insignificant. For one of these\n\nmemoranda (H-08 pages 56-57), OIG released the witness’s response without withholding any\n\nportions of the document under Exemption 7(C). See Section III(B)(3) (discussing AS 289-90\n\nand AS 294-96). The response includes all information in the memorandum. H-08 pages 56-57\n\nshould thus be released in full, and H-08 pages 54-55 and 62-63 should be released in part.\n\n                               ii.     Accusations or Derogatory Statements\n\n       The second category of documents at issue are those in which OIG redacted accusations\n\nor derogatory statements about specific individuals (H-10 pages 6-10, 14-40, and 42-54; and AS-\n\n77-81, 82-87, 93-98, 106-114, 115, 197-98, 199, and 828-29). Without exception, these\n\ndocuments were authored by Plaintiffs or, in one case, Sophie Paquerault, another employee who\n\nsigned a privacy waiver in connection with Plaintiffs’ FOIA requests. See Plfs. Mot. at 18 n.10.\n\nThe Court infers from the circumstances involved and the unredacted portions of these\n\ndocuments that individuals mentioned are the subjects of OIG’s investigation into Plaintiffs’\n\nallegations of managerial misconduct at FDA.\n\n       The Court finds first that these individuals’ identities were properly withheld under\n\nExemption 7(C) through OIG’s redactions. Targets of an investigation, like witnesses and\n                                                 30\n\finvestigators, have a privacy interest in protecting their identities from public disclosure. This is\n\nespecially true where such individuals have been investigated and exonerated. See McCutchen,\n\n30 F.3d at 188. After completing and closing investigations H-08 and H-10, OIG issued findings\n\nthat no misconduct had occurred. The stated public interest in the release of these documents is\n\nthat they are probative of whether the investigations themselves were properly conducted. The\n\nidentities of the individual FDA officials that Plaintiffs have accused of wrongdoing need not be\n\nreleased in order to probe the propriety of the investigations themselves. See Reporters Comm.,\n\n489 U.S. at 773 (citing Rose, 425 U.S. at 372, where deletions of names from disciplinary\n\nhearing summaries “were unquestionably appropriate because the names of the particular cadets\n\nwere irrelevant to the inquiry into the way the Air Force Academy administered its Honor\n\nCode”). “[T]he identities of the subject[s] of the investigation[s] . . . is not nearly as significant”\n\nin terms of the public interest “as the actions (or lack thereof) taken by the defendant.” Cuban,\n\n744 F. Supp. 2d at 89.\n\n       The D.C. Circuit’s opinion in McCutchen, 30 F.3d 183, is instructive on this point. That\n\ncase involved a scientist’s request for “a list of all investigations of scientific misconduct\n\nundertaken by the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Scientific Integrity,”\n\nincluding the names of both the complainants and the targets of the investigations. The record in\n\nthe case included “newspaper articles as evidence of ‘growing concern’ that OSI was\n\nmishandling scientific misconduct investigations,” and “allegations in the scientific and political\n\ncommunities that OSI’s handling of these cases ha[d] been inadequate.” Id. at 188. The court\n\npermitted HHS to withhold the names of the targets of these investigations on the ground that a\n\n“mere desire to review how an agency is doing its job, coupled with allegations that it is not,\n\ndoes not create a public interest sufficient to override the privacy interests protected by\n\n\n\n                                                  31\n\fExemption 7(C).” For this same reason, the Court finds that redaction of the identities of\n\nindividuals mentioned in “accusations and derogatory statements” contained in the documents at\n\nissue may properly be withheld.\n\n       Plaintiffs rely heavily on the decision of another court in this District in Cuban v. SEC,\n\n744 F. Supp. 2d 60, to support their case for disclosure. This case, however, is clearly\n\ndistinguishable from the facts before the Cuban court. Most importantly, that case involved the\n\ngovernment’s decision to withhold entire documents under Exemption 7(C), rather than just the\n\nidentities of particular individuals, without providing an explanation to the court for “why\n\nredacting the names and any other identifying characteristics of the persons involved in the OIG\n\ninvestigations will not adequately protect the privacy interests at stake.” Id. at 89. Even\n\naccepting “the defendant’s representations that the identity of persons connected with the\n\ninvestigation should not be disclosed for the reasons the defendant offers,” the court found “the\n\ndefendant has not justified withholding the remainder of the information likely contained in the\n\nrecords.” Id. This is a crucial distinction for Plaintiffs in the present case, as the Court finds\n\nhere that OIG may withhold only enough information as is necessary to protect the privacy and\n\nidentities of the individuals mentioned.\n\n       The substance of the accusations and derogatory statements contained in the records at\n\nissue, however, is another matter. To the extent the public has an interest in information that\n\nsheds light on whether or not OIG properly conducted the investigations at issue in this case, the\n\nnature of the accusations made against government officials may be probative of the propriety of\n\nthe steps OIG took to investigate. The Court thus finds that if the accusations and derogatory\n\nstatements contained in the documents Plaintiffs seek can be redacted such that the identity of\n\n\n\n\n                                                  32\n\fthe individuals against whom they are made will remain private, OIG may not withhold them\n\nunder Exemption 7(C).\n\n               2.      Exemption 7(E)\n\n       OIG may withhold records or information under Exemption 7(E) if they were “compiled\n\nfor law enforcement purposes,” and if production “would disclose techniques and procedures for\n\nlaw enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law\n\nenforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to\n\nrisk circumvention of the law.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(E). Exemption 7(E) thus generally protects\n\nthose law-enforcement techniques and procedures that are “not well-known to the public.” See\n\nJudicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Commerce, 337 F. Supp. 2d 146, 181 (D.D.C. 2004); see\n\nalso Albuquerque Publishing Co. v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 726 F. Supp. 851, 857 (Exemption\n\n7(E) applies to “techniques and procedures generally unknown to the public”).\n\n       OIG withholds portions of six additional pages under subsection (E) of Exemption 7. All\n\nsix pages come from File H-08: 1, 48, 49, 52, 53, and 135. As explained above, the Court has\n\nalready found that the records and information contained in Investigative File H-08 were\n\ncompiled for law-enforcement purposes. See Section III(B)(1)(a), supra. The Court has\n\nreviewed in camera both unredacted copies of each of these pages as well as a declaration\n\nprepared by OIG’s FOIA Officer, Robin Brooks, further explaining the non-public nature of the\n\nlaw-enforcement techniques withheld under this Exemption. In light of the Court’s review and\n\nBrooks’s attestations, it is clear that the redacted portions of the documents at issue relate to\n\ninvestigative techniques and procedures that OIG uses to gather and analyze evidence that are\n\nnot generally known to the public, and the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to\n\nrisk circumvention of the law. To describe these techniques in greater detail here would risk\n\n\n\n                                                  33\n\fdisclosing them – the very harm Exemption 7(E) seeks to prevent. See Smith v. Bureau of\n\nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, 977 F. Supp. 496, 501 (D.D.C. 1997) (recognizing “[i]n some\n\ncases, it is not possible to describe secret law enforcement techniques, even in general terms,\n\nwithout disclosing the very information to be withheld”). The Court, accordingly, finds that the\n\nsix documents at issue here were properly withheld under Exemption 7(E).\n\n               3.      Exemption 5\n\n       Finally, Plaintiffs object to a selection of HHS OIG’s withholdings under FOIA\n\nExemption 5, pursuant to which an agency need not disclose “inter-agency or intra-agency\n\nmemorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in\n\nlitigation with the agency.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5). Exemption 5 thus protects documents that\n\nwould be unavailable to an opposing party through discovery in civil litigation. See U.S. v.\n\nWeber Aircraft Corp., 465 U.S. 792, 800 (1984); Martin v. Office of Special Counsel, 819 F.2d\n\n1181, 1185 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (Exemption 5 “unequivocally” incorporates “all civil discovery\n\nrules”). Documents that fall within the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work-product\n\nprivilege, and the deliberative-process privilege are thus exempt from disclosure. See NLRB v.\n\nSears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 148-49 (1987); Coastal States Gas Corp. v. U.S. Dep’t of\n\nEnergy, 617 F.2d 854, 862 (D.C. Cir. 1980).\n\n       OIG justifies its invocation of Exemption 5 under the deliberative-process privilege.\n\nDefs. Supp. Mot. at 9. “One of the traditional evidentiary privileges available to the Government\n\nin the civil discovery context is the common-sense, common-law deliberative process privilege.”\n\nJordan v. DOJ, 591 F.2d 753, 772 (D.C. Cir. 1978), overruled in part on other grounds, Crooker\n\nv. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, 670 F.2d 1051 (D.C. Cir. 1981). This\n\nencompasses three main policy purposes, two of which are applicable to this dispute: (1) to\n\n\n\n                                                34\n\fencourage open, frank discussions on matters of policy between subordinates and superiors; and\n\n(2) to protect against public confusion that might result from disclosure of reasons and rationales\n\nthat were not in fact ultimately the grounds for an agency’s action. See Russell v. Dep’t of Air\n\nForce, 682 F.2d 1045, 1048 (D.C. Cir. 1982); see also Missouri ex rel. Shorr v. U.S. Army Corps\n\nof Eng’rs, 147 F.3d 708, 710 (8th Cir. 1998) (“The purpose of the deliberative process privilege\n\nis to allow agencies to freely explore alternative avenues of action and to engage in internal\n\ndebates without fear of public scrutiny.”).\n\n          Two requirements must be met to permit valid invocation of this privilege. The\n\ncommunication withheld must be predecisional – i.e., “antecedent to the adoption of an agency\n\npolicy,” Jordan, 591 F.2d at 774, and it must be deliberative – i.e., “a direct part of the\n\ndeliberative process in that it makes recommendations or expresses opinions on legal or policy\n\nmatters.” Vaughn v. Rosen, 523 F.2d 1136, 1144 (D.C. Cir. 1975). A record or document can\n\nbe predecisional in nature even when an agency subsequently makes a final decision on the issue\n\ndiscussed in the record or document. See Fed. Open Mkt. Comm. v. Merrill, 443 U.S. 340, 360\n\n(1979).\n\n          Exemption 5 may thus be invoked to withhold advisory opinions, recommendations, draft\n\ndocuments, proposals, analyses, suggestions, discussions, and other subjective documents that\n\n“compris[e] part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated.”\n\nSears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. at 150. “The deliberative character of agency documents can\n\noften be determined through ‘the simple test that factual material must be disclosed but advice\n\nand recommendations may be withheld.’” Mapother v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 3 F.3d 1533, 1537\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1993) (quoting Wolfe v. U.S. Dep’t of Health and Human Services, 839 F.2d 768, 773\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1988)). “[B]ecause the privilege serves to protect the deliberative process itself, not\n\n\n\n                                                  35\n\fmerely documents containing deliberative material,” however, “purely factual material” may be\n\nwithheld where it reflects an “exercise of discretion and judgment calls.” Mapother, 3 F.3d at\n\n1539; Ancient Coin Collectors Guild v. U.S. Dep’t of State, 641 F.3d 504, 513 (D.C. Cir. 2011).\n\nWhere a document contains “factual material . . . assembled through an exercise in judgment in\n\nextracting pertinent material from a vast number of documents for the benefit of an official\n\ncalled upon to take discretionary action,” the D.C. Circuit has found Exemption 5 to apply.\n\nMapother, 3 F.3d at 1539; see also Ancient Coin Collectors Guild, 641 F.3d at 513. This limited\n\nexception to the general principle that purely factual material may not be withheld under\n\nExemption 5 may not be read so broadly, however, as to swallow the rule. As the D.C. Circuit\n\nhas observed, “Anyone making a report must of necessity select the facts to be mentioned in it;\n\nbut a report does not become a part of the deliberative process merely because it contains only\n\nthose facts which the person making the reports thinks material. If this were not so, every factual\n\nreport would be protected as part of the deliberative process.” Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. U.S.\n\nDep’t of Justice, 677 F.2d 931, 935 (D.C. Cir. 1982).\n\n       Plaintiffs challenge OIG’s decision to withhold under Exemption 5 the following records:\n\nH-08 page 9; H-10 pages 3-5, 6-10, 14-40, 42-54, 126-27, 447, 450-51, 498-503, 543-44, and\n\n553-55; and AS pages 20-29, 31, 33, 36-48, 66, 74-76, 264, 276, 278-80, 289-96, 324, 378, 381-\n\n82, 390, 392-94, 427-635, 705, 770, 774-78, 784, and 806. Many pages on this list fall into one\n\ncategory of documents – namely, handwritten notes taken during meetings – which may be\n\naddressed together. The other pages are not as easily categorized, thus requiring the Court to\n\nseparately evaluate the propriety of withholding a variety of reports, emails, memoranda, and\n\ndraft documents.\n\n\n\n\n                                                36\n\f                       a. Notes\n\n       Many of the documents withheld in their entirety under Exemption 5, both from OIG’s\n\ninitial File H-10 disclosures and from the AS documents, are handwritten notes describing a\n\nmeeting, phone call, or interview. These include File H-10 pages 126-27, 498-503, and 543-44,\n\nand AS pages 20-29, 31, 33, 36-48, 66, 74-76, 264, 276, 278-80, 324, and 427-635. OIG attests,\n\nand the Court is persuaded, that all are predecisional. Brooks Decl., ¶¶ 80-85; Brooks Supp.\n\nDecl., ¶ 15. Each of these documents was prepared during the investigations that Files H-08 and\n\nH-10 concern, and all predate the October/November 2010 conclusion of those investigations.\n\nId.\n\n       OIG contends these handwritten notes are also deliberative because they “indicate the\n\nauthor’s thoughts about what was note-worthy” about the meeting, call or interview. See Brooks\n\nDecl., ¶¶ 80, 83-84; Brooks Supp. Decl., ¶ 15. Here OIG’s application of Exemption 5 is\n\noverbroad. Exemption 5 provides no general exclusion for handwritten notes prepared by an\n\nagency employee, even though such notes inherently reveal what the notetaker thought was\n\nnoteworthy about the subject of the notes. See Playboy Enterprises, 677 F.2d at 935 (“Anyone\n\nmaking a report must of necessity select the facts to be mentioned in it; but a report does not\n\nbecome a part of the deliberative process merely because it contains only those facts which the\n\nperson making the reports thinks material.”).\n\n       Handwritten notes may be deliberative or part of the agency’s deliberative process where\n\nthey contain the author’s opinions, analysis, or impressions of the event he or she describes. To\n\nthe extent such notes merely record or summarize factual content from the meetings, calls, or\n\ninterviews, those purely factual portions must be disclosed “unless the material is so inextricably\n\nintertwined with the deliberative sections of documents that its disclosure would inevitably\n\n\n\n                                                37\n\freveal the government’s deliberations.” In re Sealed Case, 121 F.3d 729, 737 (D.C. Cir. 1997).\n\nThis is the conclusion reached by other courts in this District that have recently been confronted\n\nwith similar documents sought under FOIA. See Williams & Connolly LLP v. SEC, 729 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 202, 213 (D.D.C. 2010); Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee v. Board of Governors of\n\nthe Federal Reserve System, 762 F. Supp. 2d 123, 136-38 (D.D.C. 2011).\n\n       In Williams & Connolly, the court considered documents described as “notes of\n\nconversations” and concluded: “To the extent that these documents contain merely factual\n\nmaterial such as statements made by Corigliano or Kearney, they do not fall within the\n\ndeliberative process privilege.” 729 F. Supp. 2d at 213. Similarly, in Gold Anti-Trust Action\n\nCommittee, the court reviewed in camera “a staff member’s notes on [a] discussion by the Gold\n\nand Foreign Exchange Committee of the Group of Ten.” 762 F. Supp. 2d at 137. Following\n\nthis review, Judge Ellen Huvelle concluded: “[I]t is apparent that these notes do not reflect ‘the\n\nwriter’s analytical views regarding the matters discussed . . . , but rather are a straightforward\n\nfactual recounting of a meeting . . . detailing what each of the participants said,” and therefore\n\nhave “not properly been withheld under Exemption 5.” Id. (emphasis in original). The Court\n\nthus finds that OIG may not withhold these notes categorically under Exemption 5.\n\n       Only two of these pages (H-10 pages 126-27), however, were not also withheld in their\n\nentirety under Exemption 7(C). The Court has reviewed these two in camera and concludes that\n\ntheir very brief contents are deliberative and were thus properly withheld.\n\n                       b. Other Pages\n\n       The Court will now address the other pages withheld under Exemption 5. Page 9 from\n\nFile H-08 is a report of a conversation between FDA staff and OIG staff dated February 11,\n\n2009. See Brooks Decl., ¶ 68. This document is predecisional because it predates and relates to\n\n\n\n                                                 38\n\fan investigation that concluded in October 2010. Id. The Court has reviewed the withheld\n\nportion of this page in camera, and the results confirm OIG’s attestation that the withheld portion\n\nis deliberative “because OIG’s advice was sought by FDA, regarding allegations that an FDA\n\nemployee made an unauthorized disclosure of confidential information,” id., and it includes\n\ndiscussion of potential possible actions to be taken in response. The Court thus finds that OIG’s\n\nredaction of a portion of page 9 was proper under Exemption 5.\n\n       Another group of documents withheld in their entirety includes emails between FDA and\n\nOIG (H-10 page 447), OIG and the Office of Public Health and Safety (pages 450-51), and OIG\n\nand DOJ (pages 553-55) discussing evidence relating to a potential then-pending OIG\n\ninvestigation. These emails are no doubt predecisional, as they were prepared between August\n\n2010 and October 2010 and thus predate the November 2010 conclusion of the investigation into\n\nPlaintiffs’ alleged breach of confidentiality. See Brooks Decl., ¶¶ 81, 82, 85. OIG attests that it\n\nwithheld pages 447 and 450-51 in their entirety to “preclude disclosure of the agency’s\n\ndeliberative process.” Id., ¶¶ 81-82. Having reviewed these documents in camera, the Court\n\nfinds that these emails do generally reveal the deliberative process the agency followed in\n\ndetermining how to proceed with its investigation and are thus covered by Exemption 5. Pages\n\n553 and 555 contain similar deliberative material. The sole exception is page 554, which also\n\ncontains purely factual information regarding the investigation into Plaintiffs’ alleged disclosure\n\nof confidential information. OIG should therefore redact page 554 to protect information\n\nregarding OIG’s deliberations, as well as personally identifiable information that qualifies for\n\nprotection under Exemption 7(C), and then disclose the purely factual portions of the page.\n\n       OIG also properly withheld all or portions of additional internal FDA emails under\n\nExemption 5. These pages include AS 378, 381-82, 390, 392-94, 705, 770, 784, and 806.\n\n\n\n                                                39\n\fBecause these 2008 and 2009 emails did not receive individualized discussion in Robin Brooks’s\n\nSupplemental Declaration, the Court reviewed them in camera. This review confirmed that\n\nthese records were both predecisional and deliberative, containing advice and recommendations\n\nregarding how to address either Plaintiffs’ conduct and pending personnel matters within FDA,\n\nor allegations of retaliation against FDA, before final decisions were made as to how to proceed\n\nwith respect to those matters.\n\n       Portions of pages AS 289-90 and AS 294-96, however, appear to be improperly withheld\n\nunder Exemption 5 for the reason that the document is not predecisional. Described in Vaughn\n\nIndex 3 merely as “[a]dvice and recommendations about Dr. Paquerault’s work performance and\n\nwhether to extend her appointment and names of other FDA employees,” the redacted pages\n\nprovided to Plaintiffs reveal the document to be a letter memorandum from Nicholas Petrick of\n\nOSEL/DIAM to an OIG Inspector dated August 12, 2009, with subject: “Response to 03-Aug-\n\n2009 Inquiry Letter.” OIG released the majority of this document with limited redactions – in\n\nfact, pages AS 291-93 were released in full. Vaughn Index 3 indicates only that OIG determined\n\nthe redacted statements qualify for Exemption 5 withholding because they “disclose internal\n\nFDA advice and recommendations about Dr. Paquerault’s work performance and whether to\n\nextend her appointment before a final agency decision was made.” The text of the document\n\nitself, however, indicates that it was prepared not as part of such a pending deliberative process,\n\nbut to explain past agency decisions regarding Dr. Paquerault. The document is structured to\n\nrespond to three particular issues. Issue #1 identifies a “decision that was made” and indicates\n\nthat the author was “asked to provide a written statement and supporting documentation detailing\n\nthe events that led up to this decision.” AS 289. Issue #3 uses similar language. AS 295. Issue\n\n#2 required the author to provide “a written statement and supporting documentation” for\n\n\n\n                                                 40\n\fexamples of behavior identified during Dr. Paquerault’s 2008 year-end PMAP review, which had\n\nalready taken place. AS 291. Given the document’s stated purpose of explaining or justifying\n\nprior decisions, rather than making recommendations for future ones, and the fact that the\n\nSupplemental Declaration of Robin Brooks does not specifically mention these pages, the Court\n\nfinds that OIG has failed to carry its burden of showing that the redacted portions of these pages\n\nare properly exempt under the deliberative-process privilege.\n\n       Finally, AS 774-78 disclose comments on a draft FDA document and are thus properly\n\nwithheld under Exemption 5. See Judicial Watch, 337 F. Supp. 2d at 174 (“Drafts and comments\n\non drafts are squarely within the scope of Exemption 5.”).\n\n       C.      Count 28\n\n       Unlike Counts 1, 6, 7, 12, 19, and 20, Count 28 relates not to the substance of OIG’s\n\nwithholdings, but rather to the procedure the agency used to process Plaintiffs’ FOIA requests.\n\nBecause the Court finds that Plaintiffs lack standing to bring this claim, the Court will grant\n\nsummary judgment in Defendants’ favor on Count 28.\n\n       Neither party disputes that OIG initially denied each of Plaintiffs’ individual FOIA\n\nrequests under Exemption 7(A). See Brooks Decl., ¶¶ 11, 18, 24, 30, 36, 43 (denying Plaintiff\n\nSmith’s request on September 27, 2010; Plaintiffs Wersto, Vishnuvajjala, Nicholas, and\n\nCzerska’s requests on October 7, 2010; and Plainitff Hardy’s request on November 8, 2010).\n\nExemption 7(A) permits an agency to withhold “records or information compiled for law\n\nenforcement purposes” when production of such records “could reasonably be expected to\n\ninterfere with enforcement proceedings.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(A). In denying Plaintiffs’\n\nrequests, OIG informed each of them of “an open and ongoing investigation concerning the\n\nsubject of the request” and that the agency had determined that “prematurely releasing even\n\n\n\n                                                 41\n\fsome of the information in the file could have disclosed the direction of the investigation and\n\ncould have impeded or interfered with law enforcement proceedings.” See, e.g., Brooks Decl., ¶\n\n11. After receiving these denials, Plaintiffs administratively appealed OIG’s blanket application\n\nof Exemption 7(A) to their requests for documents contained in OIG Investigative Files H-08\n\nand H-10.\n\n       While Plaintiffs’ appeals were pending, Investigations H-08 and H-10 were closed. In\n\nlight of the fact that the investigations at issue were no longer ongoing, in November 2010, OIG\n\nwithdrew its invocation of Exemption 7(A) and began processing Plaintiffs’ requests under new\n\nnumbers. See Brooks Decl., ¶¶ 12, 19, 25, 31, 37, 44. OIG released some documents to Plaintiff\n\nCzerka on November 3, 2010; to Plaintiffs Smith, Wersto, Vishnuvajjala, and Nicholas on\n\nNovember 5; and to Plaintiff Hardy on November 30, while withholding others in full or in part\n\nunder Exemptions 5, 6, 7(C), and 7(E). Id., ¶¶ 13, 20, 26, 32, 38, 45. Plaintiffs plead in their\n\nSecond Amended Complaint that after OIG began processing their requests with new numbers,\n\nHHS dismissed their pending appeals of OIG’s initial refusal to release documents under\n\nExemption 7(A) as moot. See Sec. Am. Compl., ¶ 218. They further contend that “this activity\n\nrepresents [Defendants’] ongoing policy or practice.” Id.\n\n       Plaintiffs allege in Count 28 that by beginning the process anew and dismissing\n\nPlaintiffs’ administrative appeals as moot without adjudicating them, “HHS effectively ensured\n\nthat the blanket withholdings could not be reversed administratively or undergo judicial review.”\n\nId., ¶ 219. Plaintiffs thus allege that HHS maintains a “policy or practice that intentionally\n\navoids appellate or judicial review of withholding decisions” in violation of FOIA and the APA.\n\nId., ¶ 220. They further allege that they “were materially harmed by this practice due to the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 42\n\fnecessity that they bring the instant case to ensure appropriate review of OIG’s blanket\n\ninvocations.” Id., ¶ 224.\n\n       Defendants have now moved for summary judgment on Count 28 on the ground that\n\n“OIG acted reasonably when it processed Plaintiffs’ requests following the closing of the OIG\n\ninvestigation[s].” Def. Supp. Mot. at 19. The Court need not reach that issue because it finds\n\nPlaintiffs have no standing to bring this count. Article III of the Constitution limits the power of\n\nthe federal judiciary to the resolution of “Cases” and “Controversies.” U.S. Const. art. III, § 2;\n\nsee also Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 750 (1984) (discussing the case-or-controversy\n\nrequirement). “This limitation is no mere formality: it ‘defines with respect to the Judicial\n\nBranch the idea of separation of powers on which the Federal Government is founded.’”\n\nDominguez v. UAL Corp., 666 F.3d 1359, 1361 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (quoting Allen, 468 U.S. at\n\n750). Because “standing is an essential and unchanging part of the case-or-controversy\n\nrequirement of Article III,” Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992), finding\n\nthat a plaintiff has standing is a necessary “predicate to any exercise of [the Court’s]\n\njurisdiction.” Fla. Audubon Soc’y v. Bentsen, 94 F.3d 658, 663 (D.C. Cir. 1996)).\n\n       “Every plaintiff in federal court,” accordingly, “bears the burden of establishing the three\n\nelements that make up the ‘irreducible constitutional minimum’ of Article III standing: injury-in-\n\nfact, causation, and redressability.” Dominguez, 666 F.3d at 1362 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at\n\n560-61). Although Defendants do not explicitly challenge Plaintiffs’ standing with respect to\n\nCount 28, “[b]ecause standing is a jurisdictional doctrine,” the Court is “obliged to consider the\n\nissue sua sponte.” Catholic Social Services v. Shalala, 12 F.3d 1123, 1125 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 1994).\n\nPlantiffs “bear[] the burden of providing, by affidavit or other evidence, specific facts sufficient\n\nto demonstrate standing; once provided, however, those facts will be taken as true by this Court.”\n\n\n\n                                                 43\n\fTown of Barnstable v. F.A.A., 659 F.3d 28, 31 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitations omitted).\n\n       It is on the first of the three standing criteria that Plaintiffs’ standing falters. To establish\n\nthat they have suffered an “injury in fact,” Plaintiffs must point to “an invasion of a legally\n\nprotected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not\n\nconjectural or hypothetical.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 (internal citations and quotations omitted).\n\nCount 28 is premised on an alleged injury to Plaintiffs’ procedural rights – namely, that by re-\n\nprocessing Plaintiffs’ FOIA requests under new numbers and dismissing their administrative\n\nappeals without adjudicating them, OIG denied Plaintiffs the process they were due. See Plfs.\n\nOpp. at 26-27.\n\n       To demonstrate standing to assert a claim based on the alleged violation of a procedural\n\nright, Plaintiffs “must show not only that the defendant[s’] acts omitted some procedural\n\nrequirement, but also that it is substantially probable that the procedural breach will cause the\n\nessential injury to the plaintiff[s’] own interest[s].” Bentsen, 94 F.3d at 665. Thus “to have\n\nstanding to challenge an alleged procedural violation, a party must demonstrate that it has\n\nsuffered an injury caused by the substantive action taken by the agency.” WebCel\n\nCommunications, Inc. v. FCC, 1999 WL 325450, at *1 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 28, 1999).\n\n       Here the undisputed facts of the case disprove the substantive injury Plaintiffs allege they\n\nsuffered as a result of Defendants’ dismissal of their administrative appeals. The only\n\nsubstantive injury Plaintiffs allege in their Second Amended Complaint is that they “were\n\nmaterially harmed by this practice due to the necessity that they bring the instant case to ensure\n\nappropriate review of OIG’s blanket invocations.” Sec. Am. Compl., ¶ 224. Although the count\n\ncites both FOIA and the Privacy Act, Plaintiffs’ brief on the issue makes manifest this claim\n\n\n\n                                                  44\n\frelates only to Defendants’ invocation of FOIA Exemption 7(A). See Plfs. Opp. at 26-27.\n\nPlaintiffs do not dispute, however, and Defendants attest, that OIG had withdrawn its reliance on\n\nExemption 7(A), processed their FOIA requests, and asserted other exemptions for any\n\nremaining withholdings by November 5 (in the case of Plaintiffs Smith, Wersto, Vishnuvajjala,\n\nNicholas, and Czerska) and by November 30, 2010 (in the case of Plaintiff Hardy). Plaintiffs did\n\nnot file this suit until December 15, 2010, more than two weeks after OIG had disclaimed any\n\nreliance on Exemption 7(A) to continue to withhold documents. As a result, Plaintiffs did not\n\nneed to bring this suit to challenge Defendants’ reliance on 7(A); such reliance – and, ergo, such\n\ninjury – had ceased by the time of filing.\n\n       To the extent Plaintiff National Whistleblower Center alleges that, “[a]s a frequent FOIA\n\nrequester, [it] stands to continue to be harmed by this ongoing practice in the future,” Sec. Am.\n\nCompl., ¶ 224, this allegation of future unspecified harm is too vague. Is the harm, for instance,\n\na future invocation of Exemption 7(A) or, more broadly, generally improper reliance on\n\nexemptions? More particularity is required before such an allegation could continue.\n\n       Because Plaintiffs have failed to plead and demonstrate that they have suffered a\n\nmaterial, concrete harm as a result of any procedural violation Defendants may have committed\n\nin processing their FOIA requests, the Court will grant summary judgment in favor of\n\nDefendants on Count 28.\n\nIV.    Conclusion\n\n       For the reasons articulated above, an Order accompanying this Memorandum Opinion\n\nwill grant in part and deny in part the parties’ Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment, dismiss\n\nCounts 27 and 28 of Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint, and instruct Defendant HHS OIG\n\nto release additional information to Plaintiffs consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.\n\n\n\n                                                45\n\f                            /s/ James E.

Civil Action No. 10-2120 (JEB)\n\nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND\nHUMAN SERVICES, et al.,\n       Defendants.\n\n\n                                 MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n       Plaintiffs, who are the National Whistleblower Center and six current and former\n\nemployees of Defendant Department of Health and Human Services, have brought this action to\n\ngain access to records related to the individuals’ employment with that Agency. Plaintiffs’\n\nSecond Amended Complaint challenges the decisions of various HHS components and other\n\nagencies to withhold documents, and it asserts claims under a variety of statutes including, but\n\nnot limited to, the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act, and the Administrative\n\nProcedure Act.\n\n       The records at issue in the parties’ current Cross-Motions for Partial Summary Judgment\n\nare contained in two investigative case files maintained by HHS’s Office of the Inspector\n\nGeneral. While OIG has already released hundreds of pages from these files to Plaintiffs, it has\n\nwithheld, in whole or in part, hundreds more, citing exemptions to disclosure under FOIA and\n\nthe Privacy Act. Through this Motion, Plaintiffs are now challenging a subset of OIG’s\n\nwithholding decisions, as well as the procedure HHS followed when processing their related\n\n\n\n                                                1\n\fadministrative appeals. Defendants oppose Plaintiffs’ Motion, arguing their withholdings and\n\nprocessing procedures are correct.\n\n       Having considered OIG’s sworn representations regarding the content of these withheld\n\nrecords and the necessity of withholding them, and having reviewed in camera many of the\n\nactual pages at issue, the Court now upholds the majority of OIG’s withholding decisions, but\n\nnot all. In addition, because the Court finds that Plaintiffs lack standing to bring their procedural\n\nclaims alleging OIG’s failure to adjudicate their appeals, summary judgment will be granted to\n\nDefendants on that claim.\n\nI.     Background\n\n       Plaintiffs Ewa Czerska, Paul Hardy, Julian Nicholas, Robert Smith, R. Lakshmi\n\nVishnuvajjala, and Nancy Wersto claim that they are witnesses, complainants, or targets of two\n\nHHS OIG investigations related to whistleblowing activities. Plfs. Mot. (ECF No. 14), Exh. A\n\n(Declaration of Kelly McClanahan), ¶ 5. They contend that these whistleblowing activities relate\n\nto HHS’s improper approval of medical devices. Plfs. Mot. at 2. Between July 26 and\n\nNovember 4, 2010, all individual Plaintiffs, in concert with the National Whistleblower Center,\n\nsubmitted requests under FOIA, 5 U.S.C. §552, et seq., and the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552a, et\n\nseq., for various records pertaining to their employment with HHS. Sec. Am. Compl., ¶¶ 17, 51,\n\n64, 102, 155, 168. Different agency components treated the requests differently. As to OIG,\n\nafter initially denying their requests under Exemption 7(A), on the ground that the files related to\n\nan ongoing investigation, it processed Plaintiffs’ requests and released to them over 800 pages of\n\nrelevant, non-exempt documents, some with redactions. See Def. Opp./Mot., Attach. 1\n\n(Declaration of Robin Brooks), ¶¶ 11-12, 18-19, 24-25, 30-31, 36-37, 43-44.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f          Plaintiffs filed this action on December 15, 2010, and have twice since amended their\n\nComplaint. The parties’ instant Cross-Motions for Partial Summary Judgment are limited to\n\nCounts 1, 6, 7, 12, 19, 20, and 28, which relate only to Plaintiffs’ requests for documents\n\nmaintained by HHS’s OIG and not any other component.1 The documents at issue in these\n\ncounts are contained in two OIG Investigative Case Files: H-08-20505-3 and H-10-00248-3.\n\nFile H-08-20505-3 (H-08) contains documents relating to OIG’s “investigation into managerial\n\nmisconduct [at FDA] based on Plaintiffs’ allegations.” Plfs. Opp. (ECF No. 68) at 3. File H-10-\n\n00248-3 (H-10) contains documents relating to OIG’s investigation into Plaintiffs’ “alleged\n\nunauthorized disclosure of confidential information.” Id. at 4. See Defendant HHS’s Statement\n\nof Material Facts as to Which there Is No Genuine Issue, ¶¶ 4, 6; Plaintiffs’ Response to\n\nDefendants’ Statement of Material Facts, ¶¶ 4, 6.\n\n          OIG initially released 481 pages in full and 25 pages with redactions from File H-08.\n\nBrooks Decl., ¶ 49. Another 366 pages were released in full and 5 pages were released with\n\nredactions from File H-10. Id., ¶ 73. HHS withheld in full 839 pages and 52 pages, respectively,\n\nfrom those two files under FOIA Exemptions 4, 5, 6, 7(C), and 7(E). Id., Exhs. 15-16 (Vaughn\n\nIndices 1-2). Finally, OIG referred 182 pages to the Food and Drug Administration (the original\n\ncreator of the documents) for consultation. See Defs. Supp. Mot. (ECF No. 59) at 3; Plfs. Opp.\n\nat 2-3.\n\n          Plaintiffs initially filed the Motion for Partial Summary Judgment now at issue on April\n\n27, 2011, in conjunction with a Motion for Preliminary Injunction. Defendants opposed\n\nPlaintiffs’ Motions and cross-moved for summary judgment on May 18, 2011. On June 3, the\n\n\n1\n  Plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed Count 27, a FOIA/Privacy Act claim against OIG for “failure to perform\nsearches.” See Sec. Am. Compl., ¶¶ 209-216; Plfs. Opp. at 6. Following OIG’s performance in June-August 2011\nof an additional search for records responsive to their requests, “Plaintiffs stipulate that Defendants’ search for OIG\nrecords was adequate and offer no challenge on that issue.” Plfs. Opp. at 6. Count 27 is thus dismissed.\n\n                                                           3\n\fCourt stayed briefing on Defendants’ Cross-Motion pending a ruling on Plaintiffs’ Motion for\n\nPreliminary Injunction. Plaintiffs’ filed their Reply on June 10. Following a hearing on June 20,\n\nthe Court, two days later, denied Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief and lifted the stay on\n\nDefendants’ Cross-Motion. See Order Denying Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\n\n(ECF No. 28).\n\n       Since initially filing their Cross-Motions, the parties have worked cooperatively to\n\nnarrow the areas of their disagreement. On June 23, 2011, OIG completed its consultation\n\nregarding the 182 pages at issue that had originated with FDA and released to Plaintiffs an\n\nadditional 51 complete pages and 73 pages with redactions, while withholding 58 pages. See\n\nDefs. Supp. Mot. at 3. At this time OIG also released an additional 35 pages to Plaintiffs,\n\nincluding all withholdings from File H-10 previously made under Exemption 7(E). See Joint\n\nNotice Regarding Modification of Exemption 7(E) Withholdings (ECF No. 29) at 1.\n\n       Some time in June 2011, OIG began an additional search to confirm that all records\n\nresponsive to Plaintiffs’ requests were in fact contained in Investigative Files H-08 and H-10.\n\nSee Defs. Supp. Mot. at 2. During this search, additional responsive documents were located in\n\nboxes in the case agent’s office. Id. at 3. OIG’s FOIA Officer, Robin Brooks, determined that\n\n923 pages were responsive to Plaintiffs’ requests. Id. On August 30 and September 2, 2011,\n\nOIG released to Plaintiff an additional 312 pages in their entirety, released 289 pages with\n\nredactions, and withheld in their entirety 322 pages located during this additional search. Id.\n\n       On September 26, Defendants filed a Supplement to their Cross-Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment in order to address the withholding of the documents discovered during OIG’s\n\nadditional search and those initially referred to FDA for consultation, as well as to address\n\nCounts 27 and 28. (ECF No. 59). Plaintiffs filed their Opposition to Defendants’ Motion and\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fSupplement on October 26, and Defendants filed a Reply on November 16. The Motions are\n\nnow ripe.\n\n         Throughout their briefing, the parties have – admirably, in the Court’s opinion –\n\ncontinued to work together to narrow their disputes. Plaintiffs have agreed, for the purpose of\n\nthese Motions, to limit the list of OIG withholdings that they seek to contest. The withholdings\n\nPlaintiffs presently oppose are:\n\n            From Investigative File H-08-20505-3:\n\n                  o Withheld in part: Pages 1, 9, 25, 48, 49, 52, 53, 135, and 207-212*.2\n                  o Withheld in full: Pages 6, 11-13, 15-16, 18-19, 21, 24, 28-47, 50-51, 54-57,\n                    60, 62-63, 68-93, 94-101, and 217-234*.\n\n            From Investigative File H-10-00248-3:\n\n                  o Withheld in part: Pages 3-5*, 6-10*, 14-40*, 551*, and 553.\n                  o Withheld in full: Pages 42-54*, 126-27, 447, 450-51, 498-503, 543-44, 554-\n                    55, and 558-59.\n\n            Additional Search (AS) Records3:\n\n                  o Withheld in part: Pages 77-81, 83-87, 93-98, 106-114, 115, 197-98, 199, 289-\n                    96, 378, 381-82, 392-94, 705, 770, 774-78, 784, 806, and 828-29.\n                  o Withheld in full: Pages 20-29, 31, 33, 36-48, 66, 74-76, 264, 274, 276, 278-\n                    80, 324, 390, and 427-635.\n\nSee Plfs. Opp. at 3-4.\n\n         Plaintiffs are “also voluntarily removing from controversy any challenge to the\n\nwithholding of any names, titles, phone numbers, social security numbers, office numbers, and\n\ncomparable Personally Identifiable Information (‘PII’) that may be located in the above indicated\n\npages.” Plfs. Opp. at 6. Plaintiffs note, however, that “this concession is made with the caveat\n\n\n\n2\n  Pages with asterisks denote those that originated with FDA and were initially referred there for consultation prior\nto OIG making a final FOIA determination.\n3\n  OIG describes these records as being “part of investigation numbers H-08-20505-3 and H-10-00248-3.” Plfs. Opp.\nat 3 (emphasis in original); see also Defs. Reply at 5.\n\n                                                         5\n\fthat Plaintiffs narrowly define PII as just these types of unique identifiers, as opposed to . . .\n\nanything that could be used to identify a person.” Id. (emphasis added). As an example,\n\nPlaintiffs challenge the notion that “the fact that [an individual] was in a particular meeting and\n\nthat Plaintiffs would be able to use that information to deduce the person’s identity based on the\n\nfact that they knew who was present at that meeting” qualifies as personally identifiable\n\ninformation exempt from disclosure. Id.\n\n        In order to more accurately evaluate OIG’s withholding decisions, on March 13 and 20,\n\n2012, the Court ordered OIG to submit for in camera review 279 pages that the Agency contends\n\nare exempt from disclosure, along with a declaration further explaining the non-public nature of\n\nthe law-enforcement techniques withheld under Exemption 7(E). OIG complied with these\n\norders, and the Court has reviewed the documents in question.\n\n        While Counts 1, 6, 7, 12, 19, and 20 all relate to Plaintiffs’ challenges to specific OIG\n\nwithholdings, Count 28 – “Failure to Adjudicate Appeals” – is procedural in nature. See Sec.\n\nAm. Compl., ¶¶ 217-225. Here Plaintiffs state: “Each time Plaintiffs filed an administrative\n\nappeal challenging the blanket exemptions initially invoked by OIG, HHS did not adjudicate the\n\nappeal. Instead, OIG opened a new FOIA/PA request with a new Request Number, and HHS\n\ndismissed the pending appeal as moot. Upon information and belief, this activity represents an\n\nongoing policy or practice.” Id., ¶ 218. “By failing to adjudicate Plaintiffs’ appeals of these\n\nblanket withholdings,” they allege, “HHS effectively ensured that the blanket withholdings could\n\nnot be reversed administratively or undergo judicial review.” Id., ¶ 219. Plaintiffs contend that\n\n“[a] policy or practice that intentionally avoids appellate or judicial review of withholding\n\ndecisions is in violation of FOIA and the Privacy Act,” and is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of\n\ndiscretion, or otherwise contrary to law.” Id., ¶ 220. As relief Plaintiffs seek a declaratory order\n\n\n\n                                                   6\n\fthat “HHS is in violation of its statutory responsibilities under 5 U.S.C. § 552, 552a and an\n\ninjunction compelling Defendant HHS pursuant to those statutes to cease the practice of opening\n\nnew FOIA/PA requests instead of properly adjudicating administrative appeals of denials.” Id., ¶\n\n225.\n\nII.

First,\n\nalthough OIG has released many pages to Plaintiffs, it nonetheless asserts a blanket privilege\n\nunder the Privacy Act for those documents it has withheld. Is this blanket privilege proper?\n\nSecond, even if proper under the Privacy Act, are the particular withholdings also appropriate\n\nunder FOIA? Plaintiffs’ entitlement to access records under each of these Acts “is available\n\nwithout regard to exemptions under the other”; therefore, in order to withhold the documents\n\nPlaintiffs seek, OIG “must demonstrate that the documents fall within some exemption under\n\neach Act.” Martin v.

Cir. 1987)\n\n(emphasis in original). Third and finally, did OIG correctly handle Plaintiffs’ administrative\n\nappeals under FOIA?\n\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\f        A.      Privacy Act\n\n        The Privacy Act requires that\n\n             [e]ach agency that maintains a system of records shall . . . upon request by\n             any individual to gain access to his record or to any information pertaining\n             to him which is contained in the system, permit him . . . to review the\n             record and have a copy made of all or any portion thereof in a form\n             comprehensible to him . . . .\n\n5 U.S.C. § 552a(d)(1). The Act, however, also identifies certain general and specific exemptions\n\nfrom this requirement. See id., §§ 552a(d)(5), (j)-(k). In the present case, Defendants invoke §\n\n552a(k)(2). Under this exemption, OIG may withhold the documents Plaintiffs seek under the\n\nPrivacy Act if HHS has properly promulgated a rule that exempts from disclosure the system of\n\nrecords in which they are maintained. See 5 U.S.C. § 552a(k). Whether HHS has done so is\n\nwhere the first dispute lies.\n\n                1.      Proper Promulgation of Rule\n\n        HHS contends that the records at issue in this case – namely, those contained in Files H-\n\n08 and H-10 – are exempt because they are maintained in OIG’s “civil and administrative\n\ninvestigative files” records system, and HHS has promulgated a rule, 45 C.F.R. §\n\n5b.11(b)(2)(ii)(D), exempting such files from the Privacy Act’s access provisions. See Defs.\n\nOpp./Mot. (ECF No. 18) at 35-36 (citing Brooks Decl., ¶ 7). In light of this rule, Defendants\n\nargue, OIG need not have processed Plaintiffs’ records requests under the Privacy Act.\n\n        Plaintiffs argue first, and in vain, that 45 C.F.R. § 5b.11(b)(2)(ii)(D) was improperly\n\npromulgated and, consequently, that OIG’s civil and administrative investigative files have not\n\nbeen successfully exempted from the Privacy Act. See, e.g., Plfs. Reply (ECF No. 26) at 5-7.\n\nTheir argument is based on the last provision of § 552a(k), which states that “[a]t the time rules\n\nare adopted under this subsection, the agency shall include in the statement required under\n\nsection 553(c) of this title, the reasons why the system of records is to be exempt from a\n                                                  9\n\fprovision of this section.” They argue that § 5b.11(b)(2)(ii)(D) fails to comply with this\n\nrequirement and is thus invalid.\n\n       Plaintiffs concede that “HHS included its reasons for exempting the OIG Civil/\n\nAdministrative Records System when it published a Final Rule in the Federal Register.” Plfs.\n\nReply at 6 (citing 47 Fed. Reg. 57040 (Dec. 22, 1982)). In fact, the Final Rule advises that\n\nOIG’s Civil and Administrative Investigative Files were exempted “[i]n order to maintain the\n\nintegrity of the OIG investigative process and to assure that the OIG will be able to obtain access\n\nto complete and accurate information” and explains that this records system\n\n           will contain sensitive investigative records, the release of which could\n           impede on-going investigations, violate the privacy rights of individuals\n           other than the subjects of the investigations, reveal the identifies of\n           confidential sources, or otherwise impair the ability of the Office of\n           Inspector General to conduct civil and administrative investigations. For\n           these reasons, the Department is exempting this system, under subsection\n           (k)(2) of the Privacy Act, from the notification, access, correction and\n           amendment provisions of the Privacy Act.\n\n47 Fed. Reg. 57040. Nor do Plaintiffs contest the sufficiency of these reasons. Rather, they\n\nargue that because HHS’s statement of reasons appears only in the Federal Register, and not in\n\nthe Code of Federal Regulations where the rule was eventually codified at 45 C.F.R. §\n\n5b.11(b)(2)(ii)(D), subsection (k) is not satisfied. Plaintiffs’ interpretation of subsection (k) and,\n\nmore to the point, section 553(c) demands too much.\n\n       Subsection (k)(2) requires only that an agency’s rule exempting investigative material\n\ncomply with the Administrative Procedure Act’s requirement that “the agency shall incorporate\n\nin the rules adopted a concise general statement of their basis and purpose.” 5 U.S.C. § 553(c).\n\nContrary to Plaintiffs’ position, see Plfs. Reply at 6-7 n.3, § 553(c) is satisfied when a statement\n\nof the rule’s basis and purpose is included in the preamble to the Final Rule appearing in the\n\nFederal Register. That is the case here.\n\n\n                                                  10\n\f       The regulations and case law interpreting § 553(c) indicate that compliance with the\n\n“basis and purpose” requirement is an essential part of a rule’s preamble. For example, 1 C.F.R.\n\n§ 18.12 requires that “[e]ach agency submitting a proposed or final rule document for publication\n\nshall prepare a preamble which will inform the reader, who is not an expert in the subject area, of\n\nthe basis and purpose for the rule or proposal.” Id. (emphasis added). The D.C. Circuit has\n\nmade clear that when a rule’s preamble contains an adequate statement of the rule’s basis and\n\npurpose, the requirement of § 533(c) is satisfied.

Section 4(b) of the APA,\n\ncodified at § 533(c), the D.C.

Cir. 1977).\n\n       As the reasons for HHS’s rule exempting OIG’s civil and administrative investigative\n\nfiles from the Privacy Act’s access provisions sufficiently appear in the preamble to the Final\n\nRule in the Federal Register, OIG has complied with § 553(c). These files, including those at\n\nissue in this case, therefore, are generally exempt from the Privacy Act.\n\n               2.      Denial of Right, Privilege, or Benefit\n\n       Section 552a(k)(2) makes clear, however, that even files contained in an exempt system\n\nof records must be disclosed under the Privacy Act “if any individual is denied any right,\n                                                11\n\fprivilege, or benefit that he would otherwise be entitled by Federal law, or for which he would\n\notherwise be eligible, as a result of the maintenance of such material.” Plaintiffs contend that\n\neven if OIG’s records-system exemption was properly promulgated, they have a right to access\n\nthe documents contained in File H-10 under this exception. In other words, they claim they\n\nsuffered adverse employment actions as a result of the maintenance of such material. See Notice\n\nof Filing of Additional Exhibits and of Additional Authority (dated June 20, 2011) (ECF No. 27)\n\n(with attachments: “Czerska Notice of Proposed Removal,” “Hardy Notice of Non-Duty Status,”\n\n“Vishnuvajjala Memo of Caution”). This argument fares no better.\n\n       OIG disputes that any employment actions taken against Plaintiffs occurred as a result of\n\nthe maintenance of Investigative File H-10. The results of that investigation, OIG attests,\n\nproduced “no evidence of prohibited personnel practices, retaliation, or other violations of law.\n\nAny administrative action taken by the FDA against the individual plaintiffs was separate from\n\nOIG’s two investigations, was at FDA’s discretion, and was not as a result of OIG’s maintenance\n\nof records in the two investigation files at issue in this case.” Brooks Decl., ¶ 9. All Plaintiffs\n\noffer in contradiction is an email from the OIG Assistant Special Agent in Charge of the\n\ninvestigation to the FDA Director of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH),\n\nwhere Plaintiffs worked. This email states: “Your office indicated it had developed sufficient\n\nevidence to address the alleged misconduct through administrative processes . . . .” Plfs. Mot. at\n\n15. Despite Plaintiffs’ reliance on it, when it is considered in light of OIG’s findings of no\n\nmisconduct, this email actually supports OIG. In other words, OIG is pointing out that FDA will\n\nhandle Plaintiffs’ misconduct through FDA’s administrative processes. In sum, OIG’s\n\nmaintenance of its investigative files did not cause Plaintiffs to be denied rights or benefits;\n\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\finstead, FDA’s maintenance of its own investigative files resulted in any adverse employment\n\nactions suffered by Plaintiffs.\n\n        Plaintiffs nevertheless contend that Plaintiff Czerska was terminated by FDA in part\n\nbased on “‘evidence that OIG obtained during its investigation.’” Plfs. Opp. at 14 (quoting Defs.\n\nOpp./Mot. at 32). They contend that § (k)(2) should be read such that if one agency (FDA) took\n\nadministrative action against an employee based on records or documents collected by another\n\nagency (OIG) during its own investigation, the files must be disclosed. Yet, as the email\n\ndemonstrates, FDA took action based on its collection of evidence, not OIG’s. Finally, Plaintiffs\n\nargue that FDA’s actions and OIG’s maintenance of its investigative files are both attributable to\n\ntheir parent agency, HHS. The Court need not decide this issue now because Plaintiff has sought\n\nthe same documents from FDA itself. The Court will thus address the FDA issue when it is\n\npresented. The Court otherwise concludes that Plaintiffs cannot access File H-10 under the cited\n\nexception to subsection (k)(2) because OIG’s investigation resulted in no denial of benefit to\n\nPlaintiffs.\n\n        Because the undisputed facts show that OIG is entitled to withhold the documents\n\nPlaintiffs seek under the Privacy Act, the Court now moves to consider whether withholding is\n\nappropriate under FOIA.\n\n        B.     FOIA\n\n        FOIA provides that “each agency, upon any request for records which (i) reasonably\n\ndescribes such records and (ii) is made in accordance with published rules . . . , shall make the\n\nrecords promptly available to any person.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3)(A). Consistent with this\n\nstatutory mandate, federal courts have jurisdiction to order the production of records that an\n\nagency improperly withholds.

This case turns on the application of Exemptions\n\n5, 6, 7(C), and 7(E).4\n\n        In evaluating the propriety of OIG’s withholding decisions, the Court has reviewed and\n\nrelies in part on the Declaration and Supplemental Declaration of OIG’s FOIA Officer, Robin\n\nBrooks, see Def. Opp./Mot., Attach. 1; Def. Supp. Mot., Exh. 1, as well as the four Vaughn\n\nIndices the government has filed with their briefs. See Brooks Decl., Exh. 15 (index for File H-\n\n08 initial withholdings, hereinafter Vaughn Index 1); Brooks Decl., Exh. 16 (index for File H-10\n\ninitial withholdings, hereinafter Vaughn Index 2); Brooks Supp. Decl., Exh. 4 (index for\n\ndocuments found during OIG’s additional search, hereinafter Vaughn Index 3); Brooks Supp.\n\nDecl., Exh. 5 (index for documents initially referred to FDA for consultation, hereinafter Vaughn\n\nIndex 4). In addition, the Court has conducted its own in camera review of a substantial subset\n\n\n\n4\n At this time, Plaintiffs do not challenge OIG’s withholdings under Exemption 4. See Defs. Reply (ECF No. 74) at\n1 (noting that Plaintiffs’ briefs do not address Exemption 4 withholdings). For this reason, the Court need not now\ndecide whether portions of the following documents were improperly withheld: H-08 pages 207-12, 217-34; H-10\npages 3-5, 14-40; and the Exemption 4 redactions to AS 77-81.\n\n\n                                                        14\n\fof the withheld documents at issue, which OIG has provided. These documents consist of: 1)\n\nFile H-08 pages 9, 54-57, and 62-63; 2) File H-10 pages 126-27, 447, 450-51, 498-503, 543-44,\n\n553, and 554-55; and 3) Additional Search pages AS 20-29, 31, 33, 36-48, 66, 74-76, 264, 274,\n\n276, 278-79, 324, 378, 381-82, 390, 392-94, 427-635, 705, 770, 784, and 806. Finally, the\n\nCourt has also reviewed in camera a declaration explaining the non-public nature of the law-\n\nenforcement techniques withheld under FOIA Exemption 7(E).\n\n               1.      Exemptions 6 and 7(C)\n\n       Because the majority of the pages Plaintiffs assert should be released to them were\n\nwithheld at least in part based on FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C), the Court will consider first\n\nwhether these exemptions were properly applied. OIG invokes Exemptions 6 and 7(C) for all\n\ndocuments withheld in full and almost all partial redactions from File H-08, all but two pages\n\nwithheld from File H-10, and the majority of pages withheld from the additional search (AS)\n\ndocuments.\n\n       Exemption 6 protects “personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of\n\nwhich would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” 5 U.S.C. §\n\n552(b)(6). Exemption 7(C) excludes “records of information compiled for law enforcement\n\npurposes . . . to the extent that production of such law enforcement records or information . . .\n\ncould reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” Id. §\n\n552(b)(7)(C).

First, Exemption\n\n6 encompasses “clearly unwarranted” invasions of privacy, while Exemption 7(C) omits the\n\nadverb “clearly.” See id. Second, Exemption 6 prevents disclosures that “would constitute” an\n\ninvasion of privacy, while Exemption 7(C) targets disclosures that “could reasonably be\n\nexpected to constitute” such an invasion. See id. Both differences are the result of specific\n\namendments, reflecting Congress’s conscious choice to provide greater protection to law-\n\nenforcement materials than to personnel, medical, and other similar files.

On the other hand, “an agency’s investigation of its own employees is for ‘law\n\nenforcement purposes’ . . . if it focuses directly on specifically alleged illegal acts, illegal acts of\n\nparticular identified officials, acts which could, if proved, result in civil or criminal sanctions.”\n\nId.

Exemption 7 is thus triggered when “‘the files sought relate\n\nto anything that can fairly be characterized as an enforcement proceeding.’” Jefferson, 284 F.3d\n\nat 177 (quoting Aspin v. U.S. Dep’t of Defense, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"316588\"><a href=\"/opinion/316588/les-aspin-william-b-broydrick-v-department-of-defense-melvin-r-laird/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 27 (D.C. Cir. 1973)).\n\n        The documents contained in both Investigative Files H-10 and H-08 qualify as records\n\ncompiled for law-enforcement purposes. File H-10 was compiled to “investigat[e] allegations\n\nagainst plaintiffs, Hardy, Smith, and Czerska, of unauthorized disclosure of information in\n\npotential violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1905.” Brooks Decl., ¶ 8. File H-08 was compiled to:\n\n            investigat[e] specific allegations from certain [FDA] employees, including\n            individual plaintiffs, about certain managers at the FDA Center for\n\n                                                   17\n\f           Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), regarding allegations that those\n           managers engaged in misconduct relating to the scientific review of\n           applications for pre-market approval or clearance of radiological devices,\n           allegations that those managers violated an FDA regulation, 21 C.F.R §\n           10.70, concerning the documentation of significant decisions in the\n           administrative file, and allegations that those managers retaliated against\n           the complainants.\n\nId. In other words, the records in both investigative files were compiled to investigate\n\nallegations that specific individuals at FDA had engaged in specific acts that could constitute\n\nviolations of criminal and civil laws. This is not a case involving personnel files maintained in\n\nthe ordinary course of monitoring employees’ performance at an agency. Instead, these files\n\nwere compiled to carry out investigations in response to specific allegations with the potential to\n\nlead to enforcement actions against the targets.\n\n       It is of no moment that both investigations resulted in findings of no misconduct and that\n\nno sanctions were ultimately imposed by OIG.

Exemption 7 is “applicable to material amassed in\n\nconnection with an enforcement proceeding that [is] merely ‘conceivable.’ Likelihood of\n\nadjudication is not the decisive determinant of whether a file has been compiled for law\n\nenforcement purposes.” Id.\n\n       The facts underlying Investigation H-10 are on all fours with Kimberlin v.

Defendants have thus satisfied their initial burden under Exemption 7 of\n\nshowing that the records Plaintiffs seek were compiled for law-enforcement purposes.\n\n                       b. Privacy Interests in Withholding\n\n       Exemption 7(C) allows for the withholding of records compiled for law-enforcement\n\npurposes if disclosure “could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of\n\npersonal privacy.” 5 U.S.C. § 552 (b)(7)(C). “To determine whether disclosure of certain\n\ninformation would constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy, the Court must balance the\n\npublic interest in disclosure against the privacy interest of the individual mentioned in the\n\nrecord.” Blanton v.

See ACLU, 655 F.3d at 6. In this context, the Supreme\n\nCourt has rejected a “cramped notion of personal privacy” and emphasized that “privacy\n\nencompass[es] the individual’s control of information concerning his or her person.” Reporters\n\nComm., 489 U.S. at 763. To constitute a privacy interest under FOIA, the claimed interest must\n\nbe “substantial.” Multi Ag Media LLC v.

Cir. 1991).\n\n       OIG invokes Exemption 7(C) as a basis for withholding nearly all of the documents that\n\nremain in dispute for purposes of this Motion. While Defendant has withheld some of these\n\ndocuments in full (including H-08 pages 6, 11-13, 15-16, 18-19, 21, 24, 28-47, 50-51, 54-57, 60-\n\n62-63, 68-93, and 94-101; H-10 pages 42-54, 447, 450-51, 498-503, 543-44, and 558-59; and AS\n\npages 20-29, 31, 33, 36-48, 66, 74-76, 264, 274, 276, 278-80, 324, 390, and 427-635), it has\n\nreleased others in part through the use of redactions to prevent the disclosure of personally\n\nidentifiable information (including H-08 pages 1, 9, 25, 48, 49, 52, 53, and 135; H-10 pages 6-\n\n10, 14-40, 551, and 553; and AS pages 77-81, 83-87, 93-98, 106-114, 115, 197, 199, 289, 378,\n\n381-82, 392-94, and 828-29).\n\n       The pages Plaintiffs contend OIG improperly withholds under this exemption fall into\n\none of three general categories: 1) documents – such as emails or exhibit logs – on which OIG\n\nhas excised personally identifiable information through the use of discrete redactions; 2)\n\n\n\n                                                 20\n\fdocuments – such as notes of witness interviews – that OIG has withheld in their entirety on the\n\nground that all of the information contained therein would reveal an individual’s identity; and 3)\n\ndocuments in which accusations and derogatory statements made against an individual, as well\n\nas that individual’s identity, have been redacted. The Court will consider the privacy interests at\n\nstake for each of these categories of documents.\n\n       In the first category, many of the withholdings under Exemption 7(C) were made, OIG\n\nattests, to protect the identities of the targets of, and the witnesses and law enforcement agents\n\nand officials who participated in, the two investigations at issue. Where this was accomplished\n\nmerely by redacting a name, title, phone number, office number, or comparable personally\n\nidentifiable information, Plaintiffs do not object to the withholding. Plfs. Opp. at 21. This\n\nconcession thus ends the Court’s analysis of the pages where such limited redactions of personal\n\ninformation were made. OIG represents, and the Court’s review of the size and placement of the\n\nredactions on a number of the pages confirms, that redactions on the following pages were thus\n\nproperly withheld: H-08 pages 1, 48, 49, 52, 53, and 135; H-10 pages 551 and 552-53; and AS\n\npages 381-82 and 392-94.\n\n       Although H-10 pages 447 and 450-51, and AS page 390, were withheld in their entirety,\n\nthe Court’s in camera review of these documents confirms that, as described in Section\n\nIII(B)(3)(b), infra, the substance of these emails between OIG and either FDA or the Office of\n\nPublic Health and Science, or between employees of FDA, may be withheld under Exemption 5,\n\nleaving for Exemption 7(C) only the type of personal information Plaintiffs decline to challenge.\n\nSimilarly, while H-08 page 9 and AS page 392-94 contain substantial redactions under both\n\nExemption 5 and Exemption 7(C), the Court’s in camera review revealed that all substantive\n\ninformation redacted under both exemptions qualifies for withholding under Exemption 5, thus\n\n\n\n                                                 21\n\flimiting the use of Exemption 7(C) in this document to discrete personal information. No\n\ndispute remains, therefore, as to the Exemption 7(C) withholdings in these documents.\n\n       The second category of documents at issue here is a source of disagreement for the\n\nparties. These records, which include File H-08 pages 6, 11-13, 15-16, 18-19, 21, 24, 25, 28-47,\n\n50-51, 54-57, 60, 62-63, 68-93, and 94-101; H-10 pages 558-59; and AS pages 20-29, 31, 33, 36-\n\n48, 66, 74-76, 264, 274, 276, 278-80, 324, and 427-635, were withheld in their entirety (or in\n\nsubstantial part) under Exemption 7(C). According to OIG’s Vaughn Index and Robin Brooks’s\n\nDeclarations, and confirmed by the Court’s in camera review of the AS documents included in\n\nthis category, these pages consist of reports of conversations, reports of interviews, and\n\n“handwritten notes of OIG agents taken during witness interviews and handwritten notes of FDA\n\nemployees provided to OIG during OIG’s investigation[s].” Vaughn Index 3 at 3. OIG contends\n\nthese documents must be withheld in full under Exemption 7(C) “where it was not possible to\n\nreasonably segregate information, because the witnesses were known to the targets,” or where\n\nthe “third parties interviewed or investigated worked in the same office or agency and would be\n\neasily identifiable to the targets of the investigation, as well as [to] the plaintiffs.” Brooks Decl.,\n\n¶ 64. Plaintiffs argue OIG’s interpretation of Exemption 7(C) is overbroad in asserting “that\n\nentire records may be withheld under these exemptions because one or more Plaintiffs,\n\npossessing the specialized knowledge gleaned from having taken part in the investigations, may\n\nbe able to identify these individuals based on their testimony where a member of the public\n\nwould not.” Plfs. Opp. at 21.\n\n       Exemption 7(C) protects a qualifying individual’s privacy by exempting records and\n\ninformation that would reveal his or her identity from disclosure. Nothing in the language of the\n\nexemption limits such withholdings to names, social security numbers, phone numbers, and other\n\n\n\n                                                  22\n\fdiscrete personally identifiable information that Plaintiffs decline to challenge. The decisions of\n\nother courts that have considered this issue support OIG’s contention that “[w]hen the\n\ninformation in question concerns a small group of individuals who are known to each other and\n\neasily identifiable from the details contained in the information, redaction does not adequately\n\nprotect privacy interests.” Defs. Reply (ECF No. 74) at 12. For instance, Department of Air\n\nForce v. Rose, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109431\"><a href=\"/opinion/109431/department-of-air-force-v-rose/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">352</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1976), involved a FOIA request for case summaries of honor and\n\nethics hearings at a service academy with personal references and other identifying material\n\ndeleted. The Supreme Court observed in that case, however, that “what constitutes identifying\n\ninformation regarding a subject cadet must be weighed not only from the viewpoint of the public,\n\nbut also from the vantage of those who would have been familiar, as fellow cadets or Academy\n\nstaff, with other aspects of his career at the Academy.” Id. at 380. In other words, while the\n\nredaction of an individual’s name may be sufficient to protect his identity and privacy from the\n\npublic, it may not be sufficient so protect him in the smaller community of his school or work.\n\n       The Rose Court thus upheld the court of appeals instruction to the district court that, “if\n\nin its opinion deletion of personal references and other identifying information ‘is not sufficient\n\nto safeguard privacy, then the summaries should not be disclosed.’” 425 U.S. at 381 (citation\n\nomitted). The Tenth Circuit also applied this principle in Alirez v. NLRB, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"402593\"><a href=\"/opinion/402593/louis-alirez-plaintiff-appelleecross-appellant-v-national-labor/\"><span class=\"volume\">676</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">423</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th\n\nCir. 1982). In that case, the “requested documents relate[d] to a few incidents involving about a\n\ndozen people. Even sanitized, these documents would enable Mr. Alirez, and others who had\n\nspecific knowledge of these incidents, to identify readily the informant and persons discussed in\n\neach document.” Id. at 427-28. For this reason, the court concluded that the “deletion of names\n\nand other identifying data ordered by the district court [was] inadequate to prevent serious\n\nprivacy invasions.” Id. at 427. These cases support OIG’s position that an entire document such\n\n\n\n                                                 23\n\fas a report or notes from a witness interview may be withheld in its entirety where disclosure\n\nwould allow other agency employees to identify the witness and thus constitute an unwarranted\n\ninvasion of privacy.\n\n       The Court here accepts OIG’s determination that the contents of the reports and notes\n\nlisted above, unless withheld in their entirety, would reveal the identity of a target or witness in\n\nOIG’s investigations. While the Court has reviewed some but not all of these documents,\n\nlacking the knowledge of an FDA insider, the Court is not in a position to make line-by-line\n\ndeterminations of which statements from a witness interview would expose the witness’s\n\nidentity. As the Ninth and Tenth Circuits have observed:\n\n           “The problems in undertaking to decide which portions of an employee's\n           statement may be released to his employer without revealing that\n           employee’s identity are enormous, if, indeed, not insoluble. Merely\n           deleting the name from the statement would not insure against\n           identification, since the employee’s narrative, or part of it, may be such\n           that the employer could identify the employee involved, or could narrow\n           the group down to two or three employees. Moreover, it is doubtful\n           whether the court could select which portions to release with the degree of\n           certainty required adequately to protect the interests of employees who\n           wish to avoid identification.”\n\nAlirez, 676 F.2d at 428 (quoting Harvey’s Wagon Wheel, Inc. v.

OIG has attested that “all reasonably segregable, non-exempt\n\ninformation has been released,” and that where “records [were] withheld in their entirety, there\n\nwas no reasonably segregable material or non-exempt information amounted to essentially\n\n\n                                                 24\n\fmeaningless words and phrases.” Brooks Decl., ¶ 88; Brooks Supp. Decl., ¶ 19. The Court has\n\nno reason to doubt the veracity of these declarations. The fact that OIG has redacted and\n\nreleased many of the documents for which it claims Exemption 7(C) applies supports its\n\ndeclaration that it has only withheld the information necessary to protect the identities of the\n\ninvestigation’s targets, witness, and investigators. The Court’s partial in camera review, which\n\nrevealed general diligence and fairness on the part of OIG in selecting which information to\n\ndisclose and which information to withhold, provides no cause to question the government’s\n\napplication of the exemption to these documents. The Court therefore finds that the witness and\n\ninterview notes listed above all contain information to which significant privacy interests attach.\n\n       Third and finally, Plaintiffs also contest OIG’s decision to withhold under Exemption\n\n7(C) a category of information that the government describes as “accusations or derogatory\n\nstatements against specific individuals.” See Defs. Reply at 14 n.11; see also Plfs. Opp. at 23-24.\n\nThese records consist of H-10 pages 6-10, 14-40, and 42-54; and AS pages 77-81, 83-87, 93-98,\n\n106-114, 115, 197-98, 199, and 828-29. Id. With the exception of one document (H-10 42-54,\n\nfor which OIG also asserted Exemptions 4 and 5), all of these documents have been released to\n\nPlaintiffs in part, with limited redactions. Accusations and derogatory statements made against\n\nspecific individuals, if made public, can reasonably be expected to result in an intrusion on those\n\nindividuals’ personal privacy by causing embarrassment and reputational harm.

Opp. at 23\n\n(emphasis in original). “That purpose,” they explain, “is the driving force behind Plaintiffs’\n\nefforts to obtain the controverted information from these Case Files. Plaintiffs agree that the\n\nOIG reports found no misconduct. Plaintiffs (and a healthy number of politicians and reporters)\n\ndo not believe that the evidence inside the Case Files supports such a finding.” Id. (emphasis in\n\noriginal). In support of this asserted public interest, Plaintiffs have filed with the Court\n\nnumerous newspaper articles discussing a Congressional inquiry into whether the FDA illegally\n\n\n\n                                                  26\n\fsurveilled Plaintiffs’ personal email accounts and whether Plaintiffs were retaliated against for\n\nengaging in protected whistleblower activities. See ECF Nos. 80 and 88.\n\n       The public no doubt has an interest in knowing whether HHS OIG properly investigates\n\nallegations of misconduct by agency officials and whether this was done during Investigations\n\nH-08 and H-10. “[M]atters of substantive law enforcement policy are properly the subject of\n\npublic concern.” ACLU, 655 F.3d at 14 (quoting Reporters Comm., 489 U.S. at 766 n.18). For\n\nthis reason, “a request that seeks ‘information that would explain how [an agency’s] disciplinary\n\nprocedures actually functioned’ is permissible.” Cuban, 744 F.

As another court in this District described it, “There is a\n\ncompelling public interest in knowing whether the defendant [agency] conducts investigations\n\nfree of misconduct by its employees and how alleged transgressions by its employees are\n\naddressed.” Cuban, 744 F.

Balancing\n\n       The Supreme Court has explained the test to be applied when balancing private interests\n\nin non-disclosure with the public interest in obtaining the information withheld:\n\n           Where the privacy concerns addressed by Exemption 7(C) are present, the\n           exemption requires the person requesting the information to establish a\n           sufficient reason for the disclosure. First, the citizen must show that the\n           public interest sought to be advanced is a significant one, an interest more\n           specific than having the information for its own sake. Second, the citizen\n           must show the information is likely to advance that interest. Otherwise,\n           the invasion of privacy is unwarranted.\n\nNational Archives and Records Admin. v.

At issue in the\n\nfirst category, consisting of reports and notes of conversations and interviews with witnesses or\n\nagency employees, is the witnesses’, employees’, and investigators’ privacy interest in not\n\nhaving their identities disclosed. The second category, which includes accusations and\n\nderogatory statements made about particular individuals, raises the same privacy concerns with\n\nrespect to the identities of the subjects of those accusations and statements. In addition, the\n\naccusations and derogatory statements themselves have been withheld in this second group. As\n\nthe privacy interests and public interest with respect to each category may be different, the Court\n\nwill conduct separate balancing analyses for each.\n\n                               i.      Disclosure of Identities\n\n       With respect to the documents OIG has withheld on the ground that release would\n\ndisclose the identities of targets, witnesses, or investigators who participated in the two\n\ninvestigations underlying Plaintiffs’ FOIA requests (H-08 pages 6, 11-13, 15-16, 18-19, 21, 24,\n\n25, 28-47, 50-51, 54-57, 60, 62-63, 68-93, and 94-101; and AS pages 20-29, 31, 33, 36-48, 66,\n\n74-76, 264, 276, 278-80, 324, and 427-635), the privacy interests of those individuals are\n\n“substantial.” See Bast, 665 F.2d at 1254; SafeCard Services, Inc. v. SEC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556586\"><a href=\"/opinion/556586/safecard-services-inc-v-securities-and-exchange-commission/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1197</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1205-\n\n06 (D.C. Cir. 1991). The D.C. Circuit has held “categorically that, unless access to the names\n\nand addresses of private individuals appearing in files within the ambit of Exemption 7(C) is\n\nnecessary in order to confirm or refute compelling evidence that the agency is engaged in illegal\n\nactivity, such information is exempt from disclosure.” SafeCard Services, 926 F.2d at 1206. In\n\nSafeCard Services, the D.C. Circuit rejected the plaintiff’s claim that “access to the names and\n\naddresses of potential witnesses or litigants in SEC stock manipulation investigations would\n\nprovide SafeCard and the public with insight into the SEC’s conduct with respect to SafeCard in\n                                                 28\n\fparticular and short selling practices in general,” noting that “the type of information sought is\n\nsimply not very probative of an agency’s behavior or performance.” Id. at 1205-06.\n\n        This case presents a slightly more complex problem than is involved in cases where an\n\nindividual’s identity can be protected merely by redacting discrete pieces of personally\n\nidentifiable information. In the records at issue here, as explained in Section III(B)(1)(b), supra,\n\nthe Court accepts OIG’s attestation that certain documents must be withheld in their entirety in\n\norder to protect an individual’s identity and thus privacy. In the process, however, the Court\n\nrecognizes that substantive information beyond names, titles, and phone numbers will likely also\n\nbe withheld in the name of privacy. This concern is not enough, however, to persuade the Court\n\nthat these documents must be released. This, again, is not a case in which the government has\n\ncategorically withheld all documents compiled for law-enforcement purposes in their entirety.\n\nOn the contrary, they have released many of the records that Plaintiffs sought in full and many\n\nmore with limited redactions. Thus even were the Court to find – which it does not – that\n\nPlaintiffs had presented compelling evidence that OIG engaged in illegal activity by improperly\n\ninvestigating their allegations of misconduct at FDA, they have not shown that disclosure of the\n\ndocuments at issue here – and, correspondingly, the identities of the particular individuals\n\ninvolved – would be necessary to confirm or refute such allegations. The Court therefore finds\n\nthat the privacy interests at stake outweigh the public interest in these records and that their\n\nrelease “could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal\n\nprivacy.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7). OIG thus properly withholds these documents under Exemption\n\n7(C).\n\n        The exception to this ruling relates to H-08 pages 54-57 and 62-63. OIG describes these\n\npages as “memoranda from OIG to FDA.” See Vaughn Index 1 at 5-6. Unlike the majority of\n\n\n\n                                                 29\n\fthe pages withheld here in their entirety under Exemption 7(C), the Court’s in camera review\n\nreveals that, rather than recording witness interviews or conversations, these pages are\n\nmemoranda from OIG seeking information from potential witnesses about a personnel matter\n\ninvolving one FDA employee, Sophie Paquerault, who signed a privacy waiver in connection\n\nwith Plaintiffs’ FOIA requests. See Plfs. Mot. at 18 n.10. While portions of H-08 pages 54-55\n\nand 62-63 may properly be redacted under Exemption 7(C), including the recipient’s name and\n\nother identifying information, other portions of these memoranda should be released, as the\n\npublic interest in the facts and questions contained therein is substantial, and the privacy interests\n\nimplicated by the questions and background material is insignificant. For one of these\n\nmemoranda (H-08 pages 56-57), OIG released the witness’s response without withholding any\n\nportions of the document under Exemption 7(C). See Section III(B)(3) (discussing AS 289-90\n\nand AS 294-96). The response includes all information in the memorandum. H-08 pages 56-57\n\nshould thus be released in full, and H-08 pages 54-55 and 62-63 should be released in part.\n\n                               ii.     Accusations or Derogatory Statements\n\n       The second category of documents at issue are those in which OIG redacted accusations\n\nor derogatory statements about specific individuals (H-10 pages 6-10, 14-40, and 42-54; and AS-\n\n77-81, 82-87, 93-98, 106-114, 115, 197-98, 199, and 828-29). Without exception, these\n\ndocuments were authored by Plaintiffs or, in one case, Sophie Paquerault, another employee who\n\nsigned a privacy waiver in connection with Plaintiffs’ FOIA requests. See Plfs. Mot. at 18 n.10.\n\nThe Court infers from the circumstances involved and the unredacted portions of these\n\ndocuments that individuals mentioned are the subjects of OIG’s investigation into Plaintiffs’\n\nallegations of managerial misconduct at FDA.\n\n       The Court finds first that these individuals’ identities were properly withheld under\n\nExemption 7(C) through OIG’s redactions. Targets of an investigation, like witnesses and\n                                                 30\n\finvestigators, have a privacy interest in protecting their identities from public disclosure. This is\n\nespecially true where such individuals have been investigated and exonerated. See McCutchen,\n\n30 F.3d at 188. After completing and closing investigations H-08 and H-10, OIG issued findings\n\nthat no misconduct had occurred. The stated public interest in the release of these documents is\n\nthat they are probative of whether the investigations themselves were properly conducted. The\n\nidentities of the individual FDA officials that Plaintiffs have accused of wrongdoing need not be\n\nreleased in order to probe the propriety of the investigations themselves. See Reporters Comm.,\n\n489 U.S. at 773 (citing Rose, 425 U.S. at 372, where deletions of names from disciplinary\n\nhearing summaries “were unquestionably appropriate because the names of the particular cadets\n\nwere irrelevant to the inquiry into the way the Air Force Academy administered its Honor\n\nCode”). “[T]he identities of the subject[s] of the investigation[s] . . . is not nearly as significant”\n\nin terms of the public interest “as the actions (or lack thereof) taken by the defendant.” Cuban,\n\n744 F. Supp. 2d at 89.\n\n       The D.C. Circuit’s opinion in McCutchen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"675085\"><a href=\"/opinion/675085/dr-charles-w-mccutchen-appelleecross-appellant-v-us-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, is instructive on this point. That\n\ncase involved a scientist’s request for “a list of all investigations of scientific misconduct\n\nundertaken by the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Scientific Integrity,”\n\nincluding the names of both the complainants and the targets of the investigations. The record in\n\nthe case included “newspaper articles as evidence of ‘growing concern’ that OSI was\n\nmishandling scientific misconduct investigations,” and “allegations in the scientific and political\n\ncommunities that OSI’s handling of these cases ha[d] been inadequate.” Id. at 188. The court\n\npermitted HHS to withhold the names of the targets of these investigations on the ground that a\n\n“mere desire to review how an agency is doing its job, coupled with allegations that it is not,\n\ndoes not create a public interest sufficient to override the privacy interests protected by\n\n\n\n                                                  31\n\fExemption 7(C).” For this same reason, the Court finds that redaction of the identities of\n\nindividuals mentioned in “accusations and derogatory statements” contained in the documents at\n\nissue may properly be withheld.\n\n       Plaintiffs rely heavily on the decision of another court in this District in Cuban v. SEC,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2474063\"><a href=\"/opinion/2474063/cuban-v-sec/\"><span class=\"volume\">744</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, to support their case for disclosure. This case, however, is clearly\n\ndistinguishable from the facts before the Cuban court. Most importantly, that case involved the\n\ngovernment’s decision to withhold entire documents under Exemption 7(C), rather than just the\n\nidentities of particular individuals, without providing an explanation to the court for “why\n\nredacting the names and any other identifying characteristics of the persons involved in the OIG\n\ninvestigations will not adequately protect the privacy interests at stake.” Id. at 89. Even\n\naccepting “the defendant’s representations that the identity of persons connected with the\n\ninvestigation should not be disclosed for the reasons the defendant offers,” the court found “the\n\ndefendant has not justified withholding the remainder of the information likely contained in the\n\nrecords.” Id. This is a crucial distinction for Plaintiffs in the present case, as the Court finds\n\nhere that OIG may withhold only enough information as is necessary to protect the privacy and\n\nidentities of the individuals mentioned.\n\n       The substance of the accusations and derogatory statements contained in the records at\n\nissue, however, is another matter. To the extent the public has an interest in information that\n\nsheds light on whether or not OIG properly conducted the investigations at issue in this case, the\n\nnature of the accusations made against government officials may be probative of the propriety of\n\nthe steps OIG took to investigate. The Court thus finds that if the accusations and derogatory\n\nstatements contained in the documents Plaintiffs seek can be redacted such that the identity of\n\n\n\n\n                                                  32\n\fthe individuals against whom they are made will remain private, OIG may not withhold them\n\nunder Exemption 7(C).\n\n               2.      Exemption 7(E)\n\n       OIG may withhold records or information under Exemption 7(E) if they were “compiled\n\nfor law enforcement purposes,” and if production “would disclose techniques and procedures for\n\nlaw enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law\n\nenforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to\n\nrisk circumvention of the law.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(E). Exemption 7(E) thus generally protects\n\nthose law-enforcement techniques and procedures that are “not well-known to the public.” See\n\nJudicial Watch, Inc. v.

All\n\nsix pages come from File H-08: 1, 48, 49, 52, 53, and 135. As explained above, the Court has\n\nalready found that the records and information contained in Investigative File H-08 were\n\ncompiled for law-enforcement purposes. See Section III(B)(1)(a), supra. The Court has\n\nreviewed in camera both unredacted copies of each of these pages as well as a declaration\n\nprepared by OIG’s FOIA Officer, Robin Brooks, further explaining the non-public nature of the\n\nlaw-enforcement techniques withheld under this Exemption. In light of the Court’s review and\n\nBrooks’s attestations, it is clear that the redacted portions of the documents at issue relate to\n\ninvestigative techniques and procedures that OIG uses to gather and analyze evidence that are\n\nnot generally known to the public, and the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to\n\nrisk circumvention of the law. To describe these techniques in greater detail here would risk\n\n\n\n                                                  33\n\fdisclosing them – the very harm Exemption 7(E) seeks to prevent.

Many pages on this list fall into one\n\ncategory of documents – namely, handwritten notes taken during meetings – which may be\n\naddressed together. The other pages are not as easily categorized, thus requiring the Court to\n\nseparately evaluate the propriety of withholding a variety of reports, emails, memoranda, and\n\ndraft documents.\n\n\n\n\n                                                36\n\f                       a. Notes\n\n       Many of the documents withheld in their entirety under Exemption 5, both from OIG’s\n\ninitial File H-10 disclosures and from the AS documents, are handwritten notes describing a\n\nmeeting, phone call, or interview. These include File H-10 pages 126-27, 498-503, and 543-44,\n\nand AS pages 20-29, 31, 33, 36-48, 66, 74-76, 264, 276, 278-80, 324, and 427-635. OIG attests,\n\nand the Court is persuaded, that all are predecisional. Brooks Decl., ¶¶ 80-85; Brooks Supp.\n\nDecl., ¶ 15. Each of these documents was prepared during the investigations that Files H-08 and\n\nH-10 concern, and all predate the October/November 2010 conclusion of those investigations.\n\nId.\n\n       OIG contends these handwritten notes are also deliberative because they “indicate the\n\nauthor’s thoughts about what was note-worthy” about the meeting, call or interview. See Brooks\n\nDecl., ¶¶ 80, 83-84; Brooks Supp. Decl., ¶ 15. Here OIG’s application of Exemption 5 is\n\noverbroad. Exemption 5 provides no general exclusion for handwritten notes prepared by an\n\nagency employee, even though such notes inherently reveal what the notetaker thought was\n\nnoteworthy about the subject of the notes. See Playboy Enterprises, 677 F.2d at 935 (“Anyone\n\nmaking a report must of necessity select the facts to be mentioned in it; but a report does not\n\nbecome a part of the deliberative process merely because it contains only those facts which the\n\nperson making the reports thinks material.”).\n\n       Handwritten notes may be deliberative or part of the agency’s deliberative process where\n\nthey contain the author’s opinions, analysis, or impressions of the event he or she describes. To\n\nthe extent such notes merely record or summarize factual content from the meetings, calls, or\n\ninterviews, those purely factual portions must be disclosed “unless the material is so inextricably\n\nintertwined with the deliberative sections of documents that its disclosure would inevitably\n\n\n\n                                                37\n\freveal the government’s deliberations.” In re Sealed Case, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">729</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 737 (D.C. Cir. 1997).\n\nThis is the conclusion reached by other courts in this District that have recently been confronted\n\nwith similar documents sought under FOIA. See Williams & Connolly LLP v. SEC, 729 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 202, 213 (D.D.C. 2010); Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee v. Board of Governors of\n\nthe Federal Reserve System, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2470520\"><a href=\"/opinion/2470520/gold-anti-trust-action-v-bd-of-governors/\"><span class=\"volume\">762</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 136-38 (D.D.C. 2011).\n\n       In Williams & Connolly, the court considered documents described as “notes of\n\nconversations” and concluded: “To the extent that these documents contain merely factual\n\nmaterial such as statements made by Corigliano or Kearney, they do not fall within the\n\ndeliberative process privilege.” 729 F. Supp. 2d at 213. Similarly, in Gold Anti-Trust Action\n\nCommittee, the court reviewed in camera “a staff member’s notes on [a] discussion by the Gold\n\nand Foreign Exchange Committee of the Group of Ten.” 762 F. Supp. 2d at 137. Following\n\nthis review, Judge Ellen Huvelle concluded: “[I]t is apparent that these notes do not reflect ‘the\n\nwriter’s analytical views regarding the matters discussed . . . , but rather are a straightforward\n\nfactual recounting of a meeting . . . detailing what each of the participants said,” and therefore\n\nhave “not properly been withheld under Exemption 5.” Id. (emphasis in original). The Court\n\nthus finds that OIG may not withhold these notes categorically under Exemption 5.\n\n       Only two of these pages (H-10 pages 126-27), however, were not also withheld in their\n\nentirety under Exemption 7(C). The Court has reviewed these two in camera and concludes that\n\ntheir very brief contents are deliberative and were thus properly withheld.\n\n                       b. Other Pages\n\n       The Court will now address the other pages withheld under Exemption 5. Page 9 from\n\nFile H-08 is a report of a conversation between FDA staff and OIG staff dated February 11,\n\n2009. See Brooks Decl., ¶ 68. This document is predecisional because it predates and relates to\n\n\n\n                                                 38\n\fan investigation that concluded in October 2010. Id. The Court has reviewed the withheld\n\nportion of this page in camera, and the results confirm OIG’s attestation that the withheld portion\n\nis deliberative “because OIG’s advice was sought by FDA, regarding allegations that an FDA\n\nemployee made an unauthorized disclosure of confidential information,” id., and it includes\n\ndiscussion of potential possible actions to be taken in response. The Court thus finds that OIG’s\n\nredaction of a portion of page 9 was proper under Exemption 5.\n\n       Another group of documents withheld in their entirety includes emails between FDA and\n\nOIG (H-10 page 447), OIG and the Office of Public Health and Safety (pages 450-51), and OIG\n\nand DOJ (pages 553-55) discussing evidence relating to a potential then-pending OIG\n\ninvestigation. These emails are no doubt predecisional, as they were prepared between August\n\n2010 and October 2010 and thus predate the November 2010 conclusion of the investigation into\n\nPlaintiffs’ alleged breach of confidentiality. See Brooks Decl., ¶¶ 81, 82, 85. OIG attests that it\n\nwithheld pages 447 and 450-51 in their entirety to “preclude disclosure of the agency’s\n\ndeliberative process.” Id., ¶¶ 81-82. Having reviewed these documents in camera, the Court\n\nfinds that these emails do generally reveal the deliberative process the agency followed in\n\ndetermining how to proceed with its investigation and are thus covered by Exemption 5. Pages\n\n553 and 555 contain similar deliberative material. The sole exception is page 554, which also\n\ncontains purely factual information regarding the investigation into Plaintiffs’ alleged disclosure\n\nof confidential information. OIG should therefore redact page 554 to protect information\n\nregarding OIG’s deliberations, as well as personally identifiable information that qualifies for\n\nprotection under Exemption 7(C), and then disclose the purely factual portions of the page.\n\n       OIG also properly withheld all or portions of additional internal FDA emails under\n\nExemption 5. These pages include AS 378, 381-82, 390, 392-94, 705, 770, 784, and 806.\n\n\n\n                                                39\n\fBecause these 2008 and 2009 emails did not receive individualized discussion in Robin Brooks’s\n\nSupplemental Declaration, the Court reviewed them in camera. This review confirmed that\n\nthese records were both predecisional and deliberative, containing advice and recommendations\n\nregarding how to address either Plaintiffs’ conduct and pending personnel matters within FDA,\n\nor allegations of retaliation against FDA, before final decisions were made as to how to proceed\n\nwith respect to those matters.\n\n       Portions of pages AS 289-90 and AS 294-96, however, appear to be improperly withheld\n\nunder Exemption 5 for the reason that the document is not predecisional. Described in Vaughn\n\nIndex 3 merely as “[a]dvice and recommendations about Dr. Paquerault’s work performance and\n\nwhether to extend her appointment and names of other FDA employees,” the redacted pages\n\nprovided to Plaintiffs reveal the document to be a letter memorandum from Nicholas Petrick of\n\nOSEL/DIAM to an OIG Inspector dated August 12, 2009, with subject: “Response to 03-Aug-\n\n2009 Inquiry Letter.” OIG released the majority of this document with limited redactions – in\n\nfact, pages AS 291-93 were released in full. Vaughn Index 3 indicates only that OIG determined\n\nthe redacted statements qualify for Exemption 5 withholding because they “disclose internal\n\nFDA advice and recommendations about Dr. Paquerault’s work performance and whether to\n\nextend her appointment before a final agency decision was made.” The text of the document\n\nitself, however, indicates that it was prepared not as part of such a pending deliberative process,\n\nbut to explain past agency decisions regarding Dr. Paquerault. The document is structured to\n\nrespond to three particular issues. Issue #1 identifies a “decision that was made” and indicates\n\nthat the author was “asked to provide a written statement and supporting documentation detailing\n\nthe events that led up to this decision.” AS 289. Issue #3 uses similar language. AS 295. Issue\n\n#2 required the author to provide “a written statement and supporting documentation” for\n\n\n\n                                                 40\n\fexamples of behavior identified during Dr. Paquerault’s 2008 year-end PMAP review, which had\n\nalready taken place. AS 291. Given the document’s stated purpose of explaining or justifying\n\nprior decisions, rather than making recommendations for future ones, and the fact that the\n\nSupplemental Declaration of Robin Brooks does not specifically mention these pages, the Court\n\nfinds that OIG has failed to carry its burden of showing that the redacted portions of these pages\n\nare properly exempt under the deliberative-process privilege.\n\n       Finally, AS 774-78 disclose comments on a draft FDA document and are thus properly\n\nwithheld under Exemption 5. See Judicial Watch, 337 F. Supp. 2d at 174 (“Drafts and comments\n\non drafts are squarely within the scope of Exemption 5.”).\n\n       C.      Count 28\n\n       Unlike Counts 1, 6, 7, 12, 19, and 20, Count 28 relates not to the substance of OIG’s\n\nwithholdings, but rather to the procedure the agency used to process Plaintiffs’ FOIA requests.\n\nBecause the Court finds that Plaintiffs lack standing to bring this claim, the Court will grant\n\nsummary judgment in Defendants’ favor on Count 28.\n\n       Neither party disputes that OIG initially denied each of Plaintiffs’ individual FOIA\n\nrequests under Exemption 7(A). See Brooks Decl., ¶¶ 11, 18, 24, 30, 36, 43 (denying Plaintiff\n\nSmith’s request on September 27, 2010; Plaintiffs Wersto, Vishnuvajjala, Nicholas, and\n\nCzerska’s requests on October 7, 2010; and Plainitff Hardy’s request on November 8, 2010).\n\nExemption 7(A) permits an agency to withhold “records or information compiled for law\n\nenforcement purposes” when production of such records “could reasonably be expected to\n\ninterfere with enforcement proceedings.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(A). In denying Plaintiffs’\n\nrequests, OIG informed each of them of “an open and ongoing investigation concerning the\n\nsubject of the request” and that the agency had determined that “prematurely releasing even\n\n\n\n                                                 41\n\fsome of the information in the file could have disclosed the direction of the investigation and\n\ncould have impeded or interfered with law enforcement proceedings.” See, e.g., Brooks Decl., ¶\n\n11. After receiving these denials, Plaintiffs administratively appealed OIG’s blanket application\n\nof Exemption 7(A) to their requests for documents contained in OIG Investigative Files H-08\n\nand H-10.\n\n       While Plaintiffs’ appeals were pending, Investigations H-08 and H-10 were closed. In\n\nlight of the fact that the investigations at issue were no longer ongoing, in November 2010, OIG\n\nwithdrew its invocation of Exemption 7(A) and began processing Plaintiffs’ requests under new\n\nnumbers. See Brooks Decl., ¶¶ 12, 19, 25, 31, 37, 44. OIG released some documents to Plaintiff\n\nCzerka on November 3, 2010; to Plaintiffs Smith, Wersto, Vishnuvajjala, and Nicholas on\n\nNovember 5; and to Plaintiff Hardy on November 30, while withholding others in full or in part\n\nunder Exemptions 5, 6, 7(C), and 7(E). Id., ¶¶ 13, 20, 26, 32, 38, 45. Plaintiffs plead in their\n\nSecond Amended Complaint that after OIG began processing their requests with new numbers,\n\nHHS dismissed their pending appeals of OIG’s initial refusal to release documents under\n\nExemption 7(A) as moot. See Sec. Am. Compl., ¶ 218. They further contend that “this activity\n\nrepresents [Defendants’] ongoing policy or practice.” Id.\n\n       Plaintiffs allege in Count 28 that by beginning the process anew and dismissing\n\nPlaintiffs’ administrative appeals as moot without adjudicating them, “HHS effectively ensured\n\nthat the blanket withholdings could not be reversed administratively or undergo judicial review.”\n\nId., ¶ 219. Plaintiffs thus allege that HHS maintains a “policy or practice that intentionally\n\navoids appellate or judicial review of withholding decisions” in violation of FOIA and the APA.\n\nId., ¶ 220. They further allege that they “were materially harmed by this practice due to the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 42\n\fnecessity that they bring the instant case to ensure appropriate review of OIG’s blanket\n\ninvocations.” Id., ¶ 224.\n\n       Defendants have now moved for summary judgment on Count 28 on the ground that\n\n“OIG acted reasonably when it processed Plaintiffs’ requests following the closing of the OIG\n\ninvestigation[s].” Def. Supp. Mot. at 19. The Court need not reach that issue because it finds\n\nPlaintiffs have no standing to bring this count.

Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitations omitted).\n\n       It is on the first of the three standing criteria that Plaintiffs’ standing falters. To establish\n\nthat they have suffered an “injury in fact,” Plaintiffs must point to “an invasion of a legally\n\nprotected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not\n\nconjectural or hypothetical.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 (internal citations and quotations omitted).\n\nCount 28 is premised on an alleged injury to Plaintiffs’ procedural rights – namely, that by re-\n\nprocessing Plaintiffs’ FOIA requests under new numbers and dismissing their administrative\n\nappeals without adjudicating them, OIG denied Plaintiffs the process they were due. See Plfs.\n\nOpp. at 26-27.\n\n       To demonstrate standing to assert a claim based on the alleged violation of a procedural\n\nright, Plaintiffs “must show not only that the defendant[s’] acts omitted some procedural\n\nrequirement, but also that it is substantially probable that the procedural breach will cause the\n\nessential injury to the plaintiff[s’] own interest[s].” Bentsen, 94 F.3d at 665. Thus “to have\n\nstanding to challenge an alleged procedural violation, a party must demonstrate that it has\n\nsuffered an injury caused by the substantive action taken by the agency.” WebCel\n\nCommunications, Inc. v.

The only\n\nsubstantive injury Plaintiffs allege in their Second Amended Complaint is that they “were\n\nmaterially harmed by this practice due to the necessity that they bring the instant case to ensure\n\nappropriate review of OIG’s blanket invocations.” Sec.

Although the count\n\ncites both FOIA and the Privacy Act, Plaintiffs’ brief on the issue makes manifest this claim\n\n\n\n                                                  44\n\frelates only to Defendants’ invocation of FOIA Exemption 7(A). See Plfs. Opp. at 26-27.\n\nPlaintiffs do not dispute, however, and Defendants attest, that OIG had withdrawn its reliance on\n\nExemption 7(A), processed their FOIA requests, and asserted other exemptions for any\n\nremaining withholdings by November 5 (in the case of Plaintiffs Smith, Wersto, Vishnuvajjala,\n\nNicholas, and Czerska) and by November 30, 2010 (in the case of Plaintiff Hardy). Plaintiffs did\n\nnot file this suit until December 15, 2010, more than two weeks after OIG had disclaimed any\n\nreliance on Exemption 7(A) to continue to withhold documents. As a result, Plaintiffs did not\n\nneed to bring this suit to challenge Defendants’ reliance on 7(A); such reliance – and, ergo, such\n\ninjury – had ceased by the time of filing.\n\n       To the extent Plaintiff National Whistleblower Center alleges that, “[a]s a frequent FOIA\n\nrequester, [it] stands to continue to be harmed by this ongoing practice in the future,” Sec. Am.\n\nCompl., ¶ 224, this allegation of future unspecified harm is too vague. Is the harm, for instance,\n\na future invocation of Exemption 7(A) or, more broadly, generally improper reliance on\n\nexemptions? More particularity is required before such an allegation could continue.\n\n       Because Plaintiffs have failed to plead and demonstrate that they have suffered a\n\nmaterial, concrete harm as a result of any procedural violation Defendants may have committed\n\nin processing their FOIA requests, the Court will grant summary judgment in favor of\n\nDefendants on Count 28.\n\nIV.    Conclusion\n\n       For the reasons articulated above, an Order accompanying this Memorandum Opinion\n\nwill grant in part and deny in part the parties’ Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment, dismiss\n\nCounts 27 and 28 of Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint, and instruct Defendant HHS OIG\n\nto release additional information to Plaintiffs consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.\n\n\n\n                                                45\n\f                            /s/ James E.
