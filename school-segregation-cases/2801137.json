Womack, J., joined except as to points of\r\nerror one and two.  Price, J., concurred.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><center></center></strong></span><span>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn December 5<sup>th</sup>, 2005, appellant shot and killed Eric Smith after stealing Smith's common-law wife's SUV.  Smith was killed by a single shotgun blast to the back of the head.  Appellant was\r\narrested the next day.  In April 2007, appellant was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to\r\ndeath.<sup> (1)</sup>  Direct appeal to this Court is automatic.<sup> (2)</sup>  Appellant raises nine points of error.  Finding no\r\nreversible error, we affirm the conviction and sentence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong><center>I.  GUILT</center>\r\n</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong><center>A.  Photographs</center>\r\n</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t</strong>In point of error six, appellant contends that the admission of photographs depicting the\r\nvictim at the crime scene and during the autopsy violated Texas Rule of Evidence 403.<sup> (3)</sup>  He\r\ncomplains that the photographs depicted brain tissue, blood flow patterns, bloody clothes, and\r\nexposed limbs and that some of the photographs depicting brain tissue were \"very graphic.\"<sup> (4)</sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA trial court may consider several factors when determining whether the probative value of\r\nthe evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, including the number of\r\nphotographs, their gruesomeness, their size, whether they are color or black and white, the\r\navailability of other means of proof, and other circumstances unique to the individual case.<sup> (5)</sup> \r\nPhotographs are neither cumulative nor lacking in significant probative value simply because they\r\nmerely corroborate other kinds of evidence.<sup> (6)</sup>  Also, the gruesomeness of the subject matter depicted\r\nin a photograph does not render the photograph inadmissible if it merely reflects the reality of the\r\nbrutal crime committed.<sup> (7)</sup>  Appellant relies heavily on <em>Erazo v State</em><sup> (8)</sup><em> </em>and <em>Reese v. State</em>,<sup> (9)</sup> but those\r\ncases are distinguishable because they involved photographs of victims not named in the\r\nindictment,<sup> (10)</sup> which is not at issue here.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe photographs in the instant case related solely to the victim of the charged offense. \r\nAlthough some of the photographs contained gruesome depictions of the victim's head injuries, these\r\nand the other photographs simply reflected the brutality of the offense.<sup> (11)</sup>  Point of error six is\r\noverruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong><center>B.  \"Voluntariness\" Jury Instruction</center></strong>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn point of error three, appellant contends that the trial court erred when it refused to submit\r\na jury instruction on the issue of voluntariness under article 38.22, §6.  He argues that the testimony\r\nof Sergeant Brian Harris showed that appellant's confession was involuntary because Sergeant Harris\r\npromised appellant that he would be able to avoid the death penalty if he gave inculpatory\r\nstatements.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant relies upon the following testimony at the hearing on the motion to suppress:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Q: So, you are telling him on the tape that if he will be honest with you and tell you\r\nabout this shooting, that that is the only way he can get mercy to work right?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>A: That would be the only way for mercy to possibly have a chance to work.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Q: Okay.  Well, if he did what you asked him and told you what happened during the\r\nshooting, it's not very merciful that you turn around and seek the death penalty, is\r\nit?<sup> (12)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Appellant's brief cites only to the motion-to-suppress hearing and does not discuss, or provide a\r\ncitation to, any testimony before the jury.  Article 38.22, §6, contemplates that evidence contesting\r\nthe voluntariness of a statement be introduced in front of the jury before a voluntariness instruction\r\nis required.<sup> (13)</sup>  An appealing party has the duty to cite to the relevant portions of the record.<sup> (14)</sup> \r\nAppellant's claim is inadequately briefed and subject to rejection on that ground alone. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNevertheless, since the State has cited to the pertinent portion of the testimony before the\r\njury, we will, in the interest of justice, address appellant's claim in light of that testimony.  We set\r\nout the relevant portions of the record:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Q: What was it that you spoke to the defendant about, the theme of justice and\r\nmercy?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A: Okay.  Basically, the conversation about my portion in the conversation of justice\r\nand mercy, I tell the person, what is the definition of justice?  And when I hear that\r\nperson's definition, I then come back and refer to them my definition of justice.  And\r\nthat definition being: Justice equals people getting what they deserve.  Again, then\r\nI talk to some people (sic) confuse it with revenge and other things like that.  But that\r\njustice was people getting what they deserved.  And then that leads into a portion of\r\nmy conversation where I say, I don't believe that we live in a society of justice, that\r\nwe don't get what we deserve.  And then I thank you God every day that we don't\r\nlive  in a society of justice because this would be a very hard place to live if we all\r\ngot what we deserved for things that we have done, thought, or said to people.  And\r\nthat leads into the next portion of mercy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center>* * *</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q: And what do you talk to him about mercy?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center>* * *</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A: I share with them that mercy is not so much giving people what they want but\r\npeople what they need, and then I go into a - at that time or what I thought was a\r\npopular movie a conversation about a movie to demonstrate what mercy is and we\r\ntalk about the movie <em>Bruce Almighty</em> and a character named Jim Carey.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q: I've never seen that movie.  Tell the members of the jury what it is that you talk\r\nabout in that movie.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A: In the movie <em>Bruce Almighty</em>, the character Jim Carey is given the powers of God. \r\nAnd a portion of that conversation that I share with them is that he has power to\r\nanswer everyone's prayers.  And so, he says he is going to give everyone what they\r\nwant.  And there is a computer where all the prayers are, and he hits a button saying,\r\nyes, to everybody's prayer.  And in one particular prayer, we discuss about how there\r\nare thousands of people that pray to win the lottery and they all win the lottery.  But\r\nthe day they're walking around with a miserable buck 17, you know, and some loose\r\nchange in their pocket.  And then I stress to them, they all got what they wanted. \r\nThey won the lottery.  But what was it that they needed?  And then the point is made\r\nthat many times as people we may think we know what we want, but we don't know\r\nhow to ask for what we need.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center>* * *</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Q: Did you tell him that whole spiel you have on justice and mercy and even talk\r\nabout <em>Bruce Almighty</em>?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A: Yes, and then some other things.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q: Okay.  What were some of the other things that you spoke to the defendant about?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A: Yes.  Once I spoke to him about what mercy was, I then explained to him that in\r\norder for him to get what he needed, which was not to be looked upon as a vicious\r\nanimal, but rather a person, he needed somebody that could help explain that.  I also\r\ntold him that in order for mercy to work, it stands on truth, a hundred percent truth. \r\nThat mercy can't work, it's like a chair with four legs.  It's solid, and it's sturdy.  And\r\nmercy can only work when all four legs are like truth.  That if there is one lie, then\r\nmercy can't work.  There will be no balance.  It will fall apart.  And when somebody\r\ntries to abuse or manipulate mercy, then there is only one choice left and that's for\r\njustice to kick in and justice being, people getting what they deserve.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center>* * *</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Q: What were some of the additional things that you explained to him?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A: Various elements of crimes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center>* * *</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q: Did you make him any promise?  Did you threaten him in any way to get him to\r\ndo that [talk on tape]?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A: No and no.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA claim under article 38.22, section 6 focuses on whether the accused's statement was\r\nactually involuntary, and such an inquiry may include consideration of police overreaching, youth,\r\nintoxication, illness or medication, mental incapacitation, or other disabilities.<sup> (15)</sup>  A promise can\r\nrender a confession involuntary if the promise is \"positive, made or sanctioned by someone in\r\nauthority, and of such an influential nature that it would cause a defendant to speak untruthfully.\"<sup> (16)</sup> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThere is no evidence that Sergeant Harris made a positive promise to appellant.  At most, the\r\nevidence shows that the sergeant indicated that appellant could not hope to obtain mercy if he was\r\nnot truthful, but Sergeant Harris spoke of mercy in philosophical terms and never told appellant that\r\nmercy would entail lenient treatment from the authorities.  Rather, the sergeant's use of the \"mercy\"\r\ntheme seemed to be more focused on the morality of telling the truth.  Although it is a factor to\r\nconsider, \"moral urging does not in itself render an accused's statement involuntary.\"<sup> (17)</sup>  Finally,\r\ngiven Sergeant Harris's emphasis on appellant being 100 percent truthful, the interrogation was not\r\nof the type that would cause a defendant to speak untruthfully.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant points to nothing else in the record to suggest that his confession was involuntary. \r\nAccordingly, we conclude that the trial judge did not err in refusing to submit a jury instruction on\r\nthe voluntariness of his tape-recorded statement.   Point of error three is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong><center>C.  Closing Argument</center>\r\n</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn point of error five, appellant complains that the prosecutor's interjection of her opinion\r\nduring closing arguments required the trial court to declare a mistrial.  The following occurred:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>[PROSECUTOR]: It could have been a drug deal gone bad.  If the defendant robbed\r\nEric Smith and intentionally killed him even if it was a drug deal gone bad, it's still\r\ncapital murder.  I don't happen to personally believe it was a drug deal gone bad\r\nconsidering all of the circumstances that I know from the witnesses that I spoke to\r\nand witnesses --</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection to the argument that's inserting a personal\r\nopinion --</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>THE COURT: Sustained.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: We ask for a jury instruction.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>THE COURT: The jury will disregard the last statement of the prosecutor.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: We move for a mistrial.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>THE COURT: Denied. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIn determining whether a trial court erred in refusing to grant a mistrial at the guilt stage of\r\ntrial on the basis of improper argument, we balance three factors: (1) the severity of the misconduct\r\n(prejudicial effect), (2) curative measures, and (3) the certainty of the conviction absent the\r\nmisconduct.<sup> (18)</sup>  An instruction to disregard will be sufficient to cure error except in the most extreme\r\nof circumstances.<sup> (19)</sup>  An instruction to disregard will generally cure error even when the prosecutor\r\nargues facts outside the record<sup> (20)</sup> or interjects his personal opinion.<sup> (21)</sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe misconduct in this case was not severe.  The complained of comment was brief and\r\noccurred only on the one occasion mentioned above.  The prosecutor did give her personal opinion,\r\nbut it is not clear whether her allusion was to evidence the jury had heard at trial, or to facts outside\r\nthe record.  The issue on which the prosecutor spoke was collateral; the prosecutor explained that\r\ncharacterizing the incident as \"a drug deal gone bad\" would not exculpate the defendant of the\r\noffense of capital murder.  Immediately after the comment, the trial judge instructed the jury to\r\ndisregard.  The first two factors sufficiently favor the trial court's denial of a mistrial in this case, so\r\nwe need not determine the strength of the evidence supporting the conviction.  Under the\r\ncircumstances, we find that the trial court's instruction to disregard was sufficient to cure the error. \r\nPoint of error five is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong><center>II.  PUNISHMENT</center>\r\n</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong><center>A.  Texas Youth Commission Infractions</center>\r\n</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t</strong>In points of error one and two, appellant contends that the trial court erred in admitting into\r\nevidence a summary of disciplinary infractions that he committed while he was incarcerated in Texas\r\nYouth Commission (TYC) facilities in 2003 and 2004.  Appellant argues that admission of this\r\nevidence violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation.<sup> (22)</sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe summary contained a list of 267 disciplinary infractions allegedly committed while\r\nappellant was incarcerated.  The infractions listed the location, incident number, date, the date any\r\nabsconding ended, whether the incident was the subject of a level three hearing, and a brief\r\ndescriptive label.<sup> (23)</sup>  By way of illustration, we observe that the descriptive labels included \"disruption\r\nof program,\" \"assault of student/other,\" \"refusal to follow staff instructions,\" \"failure to comply with\r\nreasonable request,\" \"danger to others,\" and \"failure to abide by dress code.\"  No commentary or\r\nfurther detail was given about the nature of the incidents.  A level three hearing was held on 114 of\r\nthese incidents.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe TYC records custodian acknowledged that a variety of the descriptive labels could attach\r\nto misconduct that was very minor.  An assault could include throwing water on someone.  Sexual\r\ncontact could simply mean an inappropriate sexual comment.  Disruption of program could be being\r\ndisrespectful to staff.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMany violations are addressed through a process in which the TYC inmate's peers confront\r\nthe violator and make him aware that he needs to correct his behavior.  Other violations may require\r\na level three hearing, a more formal process of holding the youth accountable.  In a level three\r\nhearing, a staff member writes up an incident report, the allegation is read to the youth, and the youth\r\nis given the opportunity to respond regarding whether the allegation is true or not true.  The youth\r\ncan call witnesses and offer evidence on his behalf at this hearing.  If the allegation is found to be\r\ntrue, the youth is given the opportunity to appeal, which entails another staff member reviewing the\r\nincident and determining whether the hearing officer's finding was correct. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn <em>Crawford v. Washington</em>, the United States Supreme Court held that out-of-court\r\n\"testimonial\" statements of a non-testifying declarant could not be admitted unless the declarant was\r\nunavailable as a witness and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.<sup> (24)</sup>  In\r\n<em>Russeau v. State</em>, we found that disciplinary reports that described in graphic detail the conduct of\r\nan inmate were \"testimonial.\"<sup> (25)</sup>  We held that the admission of such reports into evidence without\r\naffording the defendant the opportunity to cross-examine those who allegedly observed his conduct\r\nviolated the Confrontation Clause.<sup> (26)</sup> <strong> </strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t</strong>However, in <em>Segundo v. State</em>, we held that \"boilerplate\" parole revocation certificates \"did\r\nnot contain any such testimonial statements, narratives of specific events, or written observations.\"<sup> (27)</sup> \r\nWe observed that \"Texas courts have recognized this distinction between official records that set out\r\na sterile and routine recitation of an official finding or unambiguous factual matter such as a\r\njudgment of conviction or a bare-bones disciplinary finding and a factual description of specific\r\nobservations or events that is akin to testimony.\"<sup> (28)</sup>  In saying that \"a bare-bones disciplinary finding\"\r\nwas not testimonial, we cited to the Fourteenth Court of Appeals's decision in <em>Ford v. State</em>, which\r\nupheld the admission of inmate disciplinary records \"that contained only a sterile recitation of\r\noffenses and the punishments received.\"<sup> (29)</sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLike <em>Ford</em>, the present case involves only the sterile recitation of disciplinary offenses.  At\r\nleast for the incidents that were the subject of level three hearings, under which at least rudimentary\r\ndue process protections appear to have been afforded,<sup> (30)</sup> we hold that the conclusion that appellant\r\ncommitted disciplinary violations and the very brief descriptions of those violations do not constitute\r\ntestimonial evidence within the meaning of the Confrontation Clause.  With respect to the remaining\r\nincidents, we find any error to be harmless because we are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that\r\nthose incidents would not create any appreciably greater impact on the jury than would have already\r\nbeen caused by the jury's awareness of the 114 violations for which level three hearings were held.<sup> (31)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBut even if a Confrontation Clause violation occurred with respect to the 114 incidents that\r\nwere subject to level three hearings, we would nevertheless find the error with respect to those\r\nincidents to be harmless.  Those incidents showed appellant's violent nature and his inability to\r\nfollow rules, but other evidence at trial indisputably established those characteristics. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWenshariba Gage, a former girlfriend of appellant, testified that he pointed a gun at her when\r\nshe tried to end their relationship.  Joseph Johnson testified that appellant was one of three people\r\nthat would \"pick fun\" and \"mess\" with him, until one day appellant punched him three or four times\r\nin the face.  Sherry Menifee, a team leader at a home for troubled or delinquent kids, testified about\r\nan incident in which appellant hit a female youth with his fist and pushed Menifee in the chest when\r\nshe intervened.  To subdue appellant during that incident, the staff had to throw him to the floor and\r\nhandcuff his hands behind his back.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTashara Sanders, another former girlfriend of appellant, testified that she became pregnant\r\nwith appellant's child.  He told her that he wanted her to get an abortion.  Later, knowing Sanders\r\nwas pregnant,<sup> (32)</sup> appellant dragged her off a couch and kicked her in the stomach two to three times. \r\nOn another occasion, appellant broke the windows in Sanders's car.  Another time, appellant\r\npunched her three times in the face, causing her to fall to the floor.  During that incident, he told her\r\nthat she \"better not call the police.\"  Sanders also testified that appellant was a member of the Bloods\r\ngang. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn November 26, 2005, an incident occurred with Roy Caldwell.  Caldwell testified that he\r\nwas approached by appellant and another individual.  He did not know appellant, but appellant asked\r\nhim for a cigarette.  After he began handing appellant a cigarette, Caldwell became unconscious. \r\nHe awoke in a hospital six days later, his face heavily damaged by a gunshot wound.  He lost an eye,\r\nlost feeling in a portion of his face, and could breathe through only one nostril.  Caldwell was still\r\ntaking pain medication for this injury at the time of trial.  Appellant had been standing by the side\r\nof Caldwell's face that was injured. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe State also introduced evidence that appellant had figured out how to escape from his cell\r\nwhile being held in \"super-max\" confinement at the Harris County Jail.  He had used a piece of a\r\nmilk carton to defeat the locking mechanism.  And while appellant was on trial for capital murder,\r\nhe told a fellow inmate in the jail that he was going to take the bailiff's gun and \"shoot her, shoot\r\nhis way out.\"  The inmate told the bailiff about this conversation shortly before she was about to\r\nopen the door to appellant's holdover cell, because he saw appellant running towards the door and\r\nwas afraid appellant was about to act on his words.  And Dr. Willard Gold, a Mental Health/Mental\r\nRetardation (MHMR) psychiatrist, testified that appellant attempted to convince personnel that he\r\nhad a serious mental illness that involved hearing voices.  Dr. Gold found that appellant was\r\n\"malingering.\"<sup> (33)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDefense witnesses confirmed appellant's violent and antisocial behavior.  Tommie Walter,\r\nappellant's grandmother, testified that appellant's behavior problems \"escalated\" when her sister,\r\nappellant's primary caregiver, died.  Appellant then went to live with Walter, but she could not\r\nhandle his behavior.  She tried sending him to counseling, but it did not work.  Appellant was\r\ndisrespectful to her, sometimes talked to her in terrible ways, and sometimes did horrible things to\r\nher that she did not deserve.  Walter characterized his behavior towards other people as \"constant\r\nfighting.\"  She acknowledged that appellant had assaulted others at school and in the neighborhood. \r\nAt some point, he threatened her, and she became afraid of him and called the police.  That call\r\ncaused appellant to be taken from her home.  Later, due to assault charges, appellant was taken to\r\nTYC. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThrough the defense's own expert witness, Bettina Wright, the State was able to reveal to\r\nthe jury a number of TYC documents that showed appellant's violent and antisocial behavior.  A \r\nnotation made on January 4, 1999, showed that staff members repeatedly discussed appellant \"testing\r\nthe limits,\" making threats to TYC staff members, and throwing chairs.  A January 5 notation\r\nshowed appellant had \"aggressively tried to close his door against staff to block entry for a safety\r\ncheck\" and was \"verbally abusive.\"  In another document, the notation was made that appellant \"has\r\n[a] history of homicidal ideation, fighting at placement homes.\"  A notation in the pediatric\r\nadmissions nursing notes stated that appellant had \"homicidal ideation, no one specific, just when\r\nsomeone makes me mad.\"  Another notation in the nursing notes characterized appellant as saying,\r\n\"I like to fight and destroy things,\" and commented that it \"appears as though he is trying to\r\nintimidate those around him.\"  Another notation stated that appellant \"has difficulty taking\r\nresponsibility for his own behavior.\"  And another note said that appellant's \"behavior has been\r\nprovocative, such as physically blocking people going down the hall.\"  Another note characterized\r\nappellant as \"manipulative\" in his behavior.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tVarious notes showed numerous instances of misconduct.  Appellant deliberately knocked\r\ndown a peer's toys.  He kicked the walls in the hallway and banged on the chair in his room.  He\r\nrefused to follow directions during a fire alarm, and when staff tried to redirect him, he became\r\n\"combative\" and was \"fighting, cursing, and threatening.\"  Because another resident \"was picking\r\non\" appellant and broke his nose, appellant said, \"I'm going to use my friend's gun to kill him.\" \r\nAppellant often sang rap songs with inappropriate lyrics that glorify drugs.  He refused to complete\r\na homework assignment because he \"refused to participate in school.\"  He threw books, used\r\nprofanity, and then threw chairs down the hall, causing a \"code yellow\" to be called.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe conclude that the purpose for which the TYC disciplinary records was offered - to show\r\nappellant's violent nature and inability to follow rules - was amply demonstrated by other evidence,\r\nincluding from defense witnesses.  We conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that any error with\r\nrespect to the introduction of the TYC disciplinary records did not contribute to appellant's\r\nconviction or punishment.  Points of error one and two are overruled.      <strong></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong><center>B.  Jail Escort Evidence</center>\r\n</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t</strong>In point of error four, appellant contends that the trial court erred in admitting evidence that\r\nthe use of an \"emergency response team\" to provide an escort to the courthouse for trial was an\r\noccasional but not common occurrence for prisoners and was based upon the risk they posed to\r\nthemselves and others.  Appellant argues that the evidence was irrelevant.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLonnie Tullis, a deputy with the Harris County Sheriff's Department and a part of the\r\nemergency response team, explained that an underground tunnel system connects the jail and the\r\ncourthouse and that prisoners walk the tunnel and take secure elevators to the courtroom.  Usually,\r\nprisoners are not physically escorted, but they are monitored by a closed-circuit camera.  Sometimes,\r\nhowever, a prisoner poses enough of a risk that he is escorted by the emergency response team. \r\nDeputy Tullis testified that appellant was provided such an escort for his trial.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEvidence is \"relevant\" if it has \"any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of\r\nconsequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be\r\nwithout the evidence.\"<sup> (34)</sup>  One fact of consequence at the punishment stage of a capital murder\r\nprosecution is \"whether there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of\r\nviolence that would constitute a continuing threat to society.\"<sup> (35)</sup>  That the authorities do not usually\r\nassign a personal escort but believed that appellant needed one has some tendency to make more\r\nprobable that appellant is the type of person who would commit criminal acts of violence in the\r\nfuture.<sup> (36)</sup>  Point of error four is overruled.  <strong></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong><center>C.  Child Protective Services and Hospital Record</center></strong>s\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn points of error seven through nine, appellant contends that the trial court erred in excluding\r\nfrom evidence records from Child Protective Services (CPS) and from Twelve Oaks Hospital.  He\r\nconcedes that the trial court was within its discretion to find that the evidence was hearsay, but he\r\nargues that the exclusion of the evidence violated his Fourteenth Amendment due process right to\r\npresent a defense and his Eighth Amendment right to present mitigating evidence in a death penalty\r\ncase.  He claims that his case fits under the first scenario of two scenarios outlined by this Court for\r\nwhen the exclusion of evidence rises to the level of a constitutional violation: when a state\r\nevidentiary rule categorically and arbitrarily prohibits the defendant from offering otherwise relevant,\r\nreliable evidence that is vital to his defense.<sup> (37)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\"[T]he exclusion of a defendant's evidence will be constitutional error only if the evidence\r\nforms such a vital portion of the case that exclusion effectively precludes the defendant from\r\npresenting a defense.\"<sup> (38)</sup>  Appellant claims that the CPS records in particular were vital because they\r\ndocumented his \"tragic childhood background\" and there were no available witnesses to testify\r\nregarding the information contained in the records.  Appellant does not explain in what manner his\r\nchildhood background was tragic, nor does he explain what information the records provide that he\r\nwished to have admitted into evidence, much less explain why this information could not have been\r\ngleaned from other sources.  And appellant provides no record citations for this argument.  An\r\nappealing party has an obligation to set out the facts relevant to his complaints, as well as to cite the\r\npertinent portions of the record.<sup> (39)</sup>  Appellant's claim is inadequately briefed and subject to rejection\r\non that ground alone.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNevertheless, as with a previous complaint, the State appears to have supplied the missing\r\ninformation, so we will, in the interest of justice, address appellant's claim in light of that\r\ninformation.  The CPS records contained hearsay statements from appellant's mother that she did\r\nnot want appellant, she has never wanted him, appellant was the product of date rape, and she had\r\nrelinquished her rights to appellant.  These statements were excluded by the trial court.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe CPS and hospital records also contained references to various medications.  The trial\r\ncourt appears to have been concerned whether certain of the drugs mentioned were actually being\r\ntaken by appellant: \"Well, this looks like just a list of different kinds of drugs.  If there is information\r\nthat he was on those drugs, then fine; but if it's something that just happened to get stuck in here -\"\r\nthen the trial court was going to sustain the objection.  The trial court was aware that appellant was\r\ntaking Zyprexa and ruled the references to that medication to be admissible. But the court invited\r\ndefense counsel to show the relevance of other medications, or else the trial court would sustain the\r\nState's objection.  Defense counsel then read from a document that, among other things, said, \"Dr.\r\nButtar would like [appellant] to continue on Zyprexa, Depakote, Paxil and have Ativan, if needed\r\nfor agitation.\"  Apparently distracted by the prosecutor placing the document from which defense\r\ncounsel was reading in front of her face, the trial court asked, \"Zyprexa and what else?\"  Defense\r\ncounsel responded, \"Depakote, Ativan\" and expressed uncertainty regarding a different name for\r\nAtivan.  The trial court then sustained the State's objection to references to Benzodiazopine and\r\nPaxil, but allowed the references to Zyprexa and Depakote.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTo preserve error regarding the exclusion of evidence, a party must not only tell the judge\r\nthat the evidence is admissible, but he must also explain why the evidence is admissible.<sup> (40)</sup>  And the\r\nexplanation given at trial must match the one urged on appeal.<sup> (41)</sup>  For example, an explanation for\r\nadmissibility based upon the Rules of Evidence does not preserve a claim that admission of the\r\nevidence is required by the Confrontation Clause.<sup> (42)</sup>  Moreover, a defendant's right to present a\r\ndefense is the type of claim that is forfeited if it is not specifically urged at trial.<sup> (43)</sup></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the present case, the State argued that the evidence was hearsay, while the defense argued\r\nthat the evidence fell within the hearsay exception for medical diagnosis and treatment.<sup> (44)</sup>  The\r\ndefense never argued that admission was required by any provision of the United States or Texas\r\nConstitutions.  Nor did the defense argue that the evidence was crucial to appellant's ability to\r\npresent a defense.  With respect to the statements made by appellant's mother, defense counsel\r\nargued just the opposite: \"The third reason is that virtually everything that the State objected to is\r\nalready in the record anyway by the witnesses that have testified.\"  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAnd with respect to the drug evidence, another preservation problem arises: The trial judge's\r\nexclusion of references to one of the drugs - Paxil - may have been based on an erroneous\r\nrecollection of the record.<sup> (45)</sup>  Though Paxil was listed as one of the drugs appellant was taking in a\r\npassage that was initially read to the trial court, when asked to repeat the relevant drugs, defense\r\ncounsel repeated only \"Depakote and Ativan.\"  Appellant has failed to preserve error for review.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEven if error had been preserved, however, appellant's claims would fail.  Though appellant\r\nwas unable to introduce his mother's statements about never wanting him, his grandmother, second\r\ncousin, and uncle testified that his mother did not want her child and had relinquished her parental\r\nrights.  In addition, the defense expert testified that appellant's mother's parental rights had been\r\nterminated.  And as explained above, the trial court did allow evidence of most (if not all) of the\r\nmedications appellant was taking.  In addition, the defense expert read from one of the records a\r\ndetailed list of some the medications appellant had received and read a notation that appellant was\r\non a \"record-breaking number of psychiatric medications.\"  Appellant was able to present the\r\nsubstance of the mitigating-circumstances case to which the excluded evidence related.<sup> (46)</sup>  The fact\r\nthat he was \"not able to present his case in the form he desired does not amount to constitutional\r\nerror.\"<sup> (47)</sup>  Points of error seven through nine are overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe affirm the judgment of the trial court.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Delivered: January 13, 2010</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Do not publish\r\n<p>1.

He argues that the testimony\r\nof Sergeant Brian Harris showed that appellant's confession was involuntary because Sergeant Harris\r\npromised appellant that he would be able to avoid the death penalty if he gave inculpatory\r\nstatements.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant relies upon the following testimony at the hearing on the motion to suppress:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Q: So, you are telling him on the tape that if he will be honest with you and tell you\r\nabout this shooting, that that is the only way he can get mercy to work right?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>A: That would be the only way for mercy to possibly have a chance to work.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Q: Okay.  Well, if he did what you asked him and told you what happened during the\r\nshooting, it's not very merciful that you turn around and seek the death penalty, is\r\nit?<sup> (12)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Appellant's brief cites only to the motion-to-suppress hearing and does not discuss, or provide a\r\ncitation to, any testimony before the jury.  Article 38.22, §6, contemplates that evidence contesting\r\nthe voluntariness of a statement be introduced in front of the jury before a voluntariness instruction\r\nis required.<sup> (13)</sup>  An appealing party has the duty to cite to the relevant portions of the record.<sup> (14)</sup> \r\nAppellant's claim is inadequately briefed and subject to rejection on that ground alone. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNevertheless, since the State has cited to the pertinent portion of the testimony before the\r\njury, we will, in the interest of justice, address appellant's claim in light of that testimony.  We set\r\nout the relevant portions of the record:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Q: What was it that you spoke to the defendant about, the theme of justice and\r\nmercy?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A: Okay.  Basically, the conversation about my portion in the conversation of justice\r\nand mercy, I tell the person, what is the definition of justice?  And when I hear that\r\nperson's definition, I then come back and refer to them my definition of justice.  And\r\nthat definition being: Justice equals people getting what they deserve.  Again, then\r\nI talk to some people (sic) confuse it with revenge and other things like that.  But that\r\njustice was people getting what they deserved.  And then that leads into a portion of\r\nmy conversation where I say, I don't believe that we live in a society of justice, that\r\nwe don't get what we deserve.  And then I thank you God every day that we don't\r\nlive  in a society of justice because this would be a very hard place to live if we all\r\ngot what we deserved for things that we have done, thought, or said to people.  And\r\nthat leads into the next portion of mercy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center>* * *</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q: And what do you talk to him about mercy?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center>* * *</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A: I share with them that mercy is not so much giving people what they want but\r\npeople what they need, and then I go into a - at that time or what I thought was a\r\npopular movie a conversation about a movie to demonstrate what mercy is and we\r\ntalk about the movie <em>Bruce Almighty</em> and a character named Jim Carey.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q: I've never seen that movie.  Tell the members of the jury what it is that you talk\r\nabout in that movie.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A: In the movie <em>Bruce Almighty</em>, the character Jim Carey is given the powers of God. \r\nAnd a portion of that conversation that I share with them is that he has power to\r\nanswer everyone's prayers.  And so, he says he is going to give everyone what they\r\nwant.  And there is a computer where all the prayers are, and he hits a button saying,\r\nyes, to everybody's prayer.  And in one particular prayer, we discuss about how there\r\nare thousands of people that pray to win the lottery and they all win the lottery.  But\r\nthe day they're walking around with a miserable buck 17, you know, and some loose\r\nchange in their pocket.  And then I stress to them, they all got what they wanted. \r\nThey won the lottery.  But what was it that they needed?  And then the point is made\r\nthat many times as people we may think we know what we want, but we don't know\r\nhow to ask for what we need.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center>* * *</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Q: Did you tell him that whole spiel you have on justice and mercy and even talk\r\nabout <em>Bruce Almighty</em>?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A: Yes, and then some other things.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q: Okay.  What were some of the other things that you spoke to the defendant about?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A: Yes.  Once I spoke to him about what mercy was, I then explained to him that in\r\norder for him to get what he needed, which was not to be looked upon as a vicious\r\nanimal, but rather a person, he needed somebody that could help explain that.  I also\r\ntold him that in order for mercy to work, it stands on truth, a hundred percent truth. \r\nThat mercy can't work, it's like a chair with four legs.  It's solid, and it's sturdy.  And\r\nmercy can only work when all four legs are like truth.  That if there is one lie, then\r\nmercy can't work.  There will be no balance.  It will fall apart.  And when somebody\r\ntries to abuse or manipulate mercy, then there is only one choice left and that's for\r\njustice to kick in and justice being, people getting what they deserve.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center>* * *</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Q: What were some of the additional things that you explained to him?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A: Various elements of crimes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center>* * *</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q: Did you make him any promise?  Did you threaten him in any way to get him to\r\ndo that [talk on tape]?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A: No and no.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA claim under article 38.22, section 6 focuses on whether the accused's statement was\r\nactually involuntary, and such an inquiry may include consideration of police overreaching, youth,\r\nintoxication, illness or medication, mental incapacitation, or other disabilities.<sup> (15)</sup>  A promise can\r\nrender a confession involuntary if the promise is \"positive, made or sanctioned by someone in\r\nauthority, and of such an influential nature that it would cause a defendant to speak untruthfully.\"<sup> (16)</sup> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThere is no evidence that Sergeant Harris made a positive promise to appellant.  At most, the\r\nevidence shows that the sergeant indicated that appellant could not hope to obtain mercy if he was\r\nnot truthful, but Sergeant Harris spoke of mercy in philosophical terms and never told appellant that\r\nmercy would entail lenient treatment from the authorities.  Rather, the sergeant's use of the \"mercy\"\r\ntheme seemed to be more focused on the morality of telling the truth.  Although it is a factor to\r\nconsider, \"moral urging does not in itself render an accused's statement involuntary.\"<sup> (17)</sup>  Finally,\r\ngiven Sergeant Harris's emphasis on appellant being 100 percent truthful, the interrogation was not\r\nof the type that would cause a defendant to speak untruthfully.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant points to nothing else in the record to suggest that his confession was involuntary. \r\nAccordingly, we conclude that the trial judge did not err in refusing to submit a jury instruction on\r\nthe voluntariness of his tape-recorded statement.   Point of error three is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong><center>C.  Closing Argument</center>\r\n</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn point of error five, appellant complains that the prosecutor's interjection of her opinion\r\nduring closing arguments required the trial court to declare a mistrial.  The following occurred:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>[PROSECUTOR]: It could have been a drug deal gone bad.  If the defendant robbed\r\nEric Smith and intentionally killed him even if it was a drug deal gone bad, it's still\r\ncapital murder.  I don't happen to personally believe it was a drug deal gone bad\r\nconsidering all of the circumstances that I know from the witnesses that I spoke to\r\nand witnesses --</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection to the argument that's inserting a personal\r\nopinion --</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>THE COURT: Sustained.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: We ask for a jury instruction.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>THE COURT: The jury will disregard the last statement of the prosecutor.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: We move for a mistrial.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>THE COURT: Denied. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIn determining whether a trial court erred in refusing to grant a mistrial at the guilt stage of\r\ntrial on the basis of improper argument, we balance three factors: (1) the severity of the misconduct\r\n(prejudicial effect), (2) curative measures, and (3) the certainty of the conviction absent the\r\nmisconduct.<sup> (18)</sup>  An instruction to disregard will be sufficient to cure error except in the most extreme\r\nof circumstances.<sup> (19)</sup>  An instruction to disregard will generally cure error even when the prosecutor\r\nargues facts outside the record<sup> (20)</sup> or interjects his personal opinion.<sup> (21)</sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe misconduct in this case was not severe.  The complained of comment was brief and\r\noccurred only on the one occasion mentioned above.  The prosecutor did give her personal opinion,\r\nbut it is not clear whether her allusion was to evidence the jury had heard at trial, or to facts outside\r\nthe record.  The issue on which the prosecutor spoke was collateral; the prosecutor explained that\r\ncharacterizing the incident as \"a drug deal gone bad\" would not exculpate the defendant of the\r\noffense of capital murder.  Immediately after the comment, the trial judge instructed the jury to\r\ndisregard.  The first two factors sufficiently favor the trial court's denial of a mistrial in this case, so\r\nwe need not determine the strength of the evidence supporting the conviction.  Under the\r\ncircumstances, we find that the trial court's instruction to disregard was sufficient to cure the error. \r\nPoint of error five is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong><center>II.  PUNISHMENT</center>\r\n</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong><center>A.  Texas Youth Commission Infractions</center>\r\n</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t</strong>In points of error one and two, appellant contends that the trial court erred in admitting into\r\nevidence a summary of disciplinary infractions that he committed while he was incarcerated in Texas\r\nYouth Commission (TYC) facilities in 2003 and 2004.  Appellant argues that admission of this\r\nevidence violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation.<sup> (22)</sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe summary contained a list of 267 disciplinary infractions allegedly committed while\r\nappellant was incarcerated.  The infractions listed the location, incident number, date, the date any\r\nabsconding ended, whether the incident was the subject of a level three hearing, and a brief\r\ndescriptive label.<sup> (23)</sup>  By way of illustration, we observe that the descriptive labels included \"disruption\r\nof program,\" \"assault of student/other,\" \"refusal to follow staff instructions,\" \"failure to comply with\r\nreasonable request,\" \"danger to others,\" and \"failure to abide by dress code.\"  No commentary or\r\nfurther detail was given about the nature of the incidents.  A level three hearing was held on 114 of\r\nthese incidents.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe TYC records custodian acknowledged that a variety of the descriptive labels could attach\r\nto misconduct that was very minor.  An assault could include throwing water on someone.  Sexual\r\ncontact could simply mean an inappropriate sexual comment.  Disruption of program could be being\r\ndisrespectful to staff.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMany violations are addressed through a process in which the TYC inmate's peers confront\r\nthe violator and make him aware that he needs to correct his behavior.  Other violations may require\r\na level three hearing, a more formal process of holding the youth accountable.  In a level three\r\nhearing, a staff member writes up an incident report, the allegation is read to the youth, and the youth\r\nis given the opportunity to respond regarding whether the allegation is true or not true.  The youth\r\ncan call witnesses and offer evidence on his behalf at this hearing.  If the allegation is found to be\r\ntrue, the youth is given the opportunity to appeal, which entails another staff member reviewing the\r\nincident and determining whether the hearing officer's finding was correct. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn <em>Crawford v. Washington</em>, the United States Supreme Court held that out-of-court\r\n\"testimonial\" statements of a non-testifying declarant could not be admitted unless the declarant was\r\nunavailable as a witness and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.<sup> (24)</sup>  In\r\n<em>Russeau v. State</em>, we found that disciplinary reports that described in graphic detail the conduct of\r\nan inmate were \"testimonial.\"<sup> (25)</sup>  We held that the admission of such reports into evidence without\r\naffording the defendant the opportunity to cross-examine those who allegedly observed his conduct\r\nviolated the Confrontation Clause.<sup> (26)</sup> <strong> </strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t</strong>However, in <em>Segundo v. State</em>, we held that \"boilerplate\" parole revocation certificates \"did\r\nnot contain any such testimonial statements, narratives of specific events, or written observations.\"<sup> (27)</sup> \r\nWe observed that \"Texas courts have recognized this distinction between official records that set out\r\na sterile and routine recitation of an official finding or unambiguous factual matter such as a\r\njudgment of conviction or a bare-bones disciplinary finding and a factual description of specific\r\nobservations or events that is akin to testimony.\"<sup> (28)</sup>  In saying that \"a bare-bones disciplinary finding\"\r\nwas not testimonial, we cited to the Fourteenth Court of Appeals's decision in <em>Ford v. State</em>, which\r\nupheld the admission of inmate disciplinary records \"that contained only a sterile recitation of\r\noffenses and the punishments received.\"<sup> (29)</sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLike <em>Ford</em>, the present case involves only the sterile recitation of disciplinary offenses.  At\r\nleast for the incidents that were the subject of level three hearings, under which at least rudimentary\r\ndue process protections appear to have been afforded,<sup> (30)</sup> we hold that the conclusion that appellant\r\ncommitted disciplinary violations and the very brief descriptions of those violations do not constitute\r\ntestimonial evidence within the meaning of the Confrontation Clause.  With respect to the remaining\r\nincidents, we find any error to be harmless because we are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that\r\nthose incidents would not create any appreciably greater impact on the jury than would have already\r\nbeen caused by the jury's awareness of the 114 violations for which level three hearings were held.<sup> (31)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBut even if a Confrontation Clause violation occurred with respect to the 114 incidents that\r\nwere subject to level three hearings, we would nevertheless find the error with respect to those\r\nincidents to be harmless.  Those incidents showed appellant's violent nature and his inability to\r\nfollow rules, but other evidence at trial indisputably established those characteristics. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWenshariba Gage, a former girlfriend of appellant, testified that he pointed a gun at her when\r\nshe tried to end their relationship.  Joseph Johnson testified that appellant was one of three people\r\nthat would \"pick fun\" and \"mess\" with him, until one day appellant punched him three or four times\r\nin the face.  Sherry Menifee, a team leader at a home for troubled or delinquent kids, testified about\r\nan incident in which appellant hit a female youth with his fist and pushed Menifee in the chest when\r\nshe intervened.  To subdue appellant during that incident, the staff had to throw him to the floor and\r\nhandcuff his hands behind his back.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTashara Sanders, another former girlfriend of appellant, testified that she became pregnant\r\nwith appellant's child.  He told her that he wanted her to get an abortion.  Later, knowing Sanders\r\nwas pregnant,<sup> (32)</sup> appellant dragged her off a couch and kicked her in the stomach two to three times. \r\nOn another occasion, appellant broke the windows in Sanders's car.  Another time, appellant\r\npunched her three times in the face, causing her to fall to the floor.  During that incident, he told her\r\nthat she \"better not call the police.\"  Sanders also testified that appellant was a member of the Bloods\r\ngang. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn November 26, 2005, an incident occurred with Roy Caldwell.  Caldwell testified that he\r\nwas approached by appellant and another individual.  He did not know appellant, but appellant asked\r\nhim for a cigarette.  After he began handing appellant a cigarette, Caldwell became unconscious. \r\nHe awoke in a hospital six days later, his face heavily damaged by a gunshot wound.  He lost an eye,\r\nlost feeling in a portion of his face, and could breathe through only one nostril.  Caldwell was still\r\ntaking pain medication for this injury at the time of trial.  Appellant had been standing by the side\r\nof Caldwell's face that was injured. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe State also introduced evidence that appellant had figured out how to escape from his cell\r\nwhile being held in \"super-max\" confinement at the Harris County Jail.  He had used a piece of a\r\nmilk carton to defeat the locking mechanism.  And while appellant was on trial for capital murder,\r\nhe told a fellow inmate in the jail that he was going to take the bailiff's gun and \"shoot her, shoot\r\nhis way out.\"  The inmate told the bailiff about this conversation shortly before she was about to\r\nopen the door to appellant's holdover cell, because he saw appellant running towards the door and\r\nwas afraid appellant was about to act on his words.  And Dr. Willard Gold, a Mental Health/Mental\r\nRetardation (MHMR) psychiatrist, testified that appellant attempted to convince personnel that he\r\nhad a serious mental illness that involved hearing voices.  Dr. Gold found that appellant was\r\n\"malingering.\"<sup> (33)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDefense witnesses confirmed appellant's violent and antisocial behavior.  Tommie Walter,\r\nappellant's grandmother, testified that appellant's behavior problems \"escalated\" when her sister,\r\nappellant's primary caregiver, died.  Appellant then went to live with Walter, but she could not\r\nhandle his behavior.  She tried sending him to counseling, but it did not work.  Appellant was\r\ndisrespectful to her, sometimes talked to her in terrible ways, and sometimes did horrible things to\r\nher that she did not deserve.  Walter characterized his behavior towards other people as \"constant\r\nfighting.\"  She acknowledged that appellant had assaulted others at school and in the neighborhood. \r\nAt some point, he threatened her, and she became afraid of him and called the police.  That call\r\ncaused appellant to be taken from her home.  Later, due to assault charges, appellant was taken to\r\nTYC. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThrough the defense's own expert witness, Bettina Wright, the State was able to reveal to\r\nthe jury a number of TYC documents that showed appellant's violent and antisocial behavior.  A \r\nnotation made on January 4, 1999, showed that staff members repeatedly discussed appellant \"testing\r\nthe limits,\" making threats to TYC staff members, and throwing chairs.  A January 5 notation\r\nshowed appellant had \"aggressively tried to close his door against staff to block entry for a safety\r\ncheck\" and was \"verbally abusive.\"  In another document, the notation was made that appellant \"has\r\n[a] history of homicidal ideation, fighting at placement homes.\"  A notation in the pediatric\r\nadmissions nursing notes stated that appellant had \"homicidal ideation, no one specific, just when\r\nsomeone makes me mad.\"  Another notation in the nursing notes characterized appellant as saying,\r\n\"I like to fight and destroy things,\" and commented that it \"appears as though he is trying to\r\nintimidate those around him.\"  Another notation stated that appellant \"has difficulty taking\r\nresponsibility for his own behavior.\"  And another note said that appellant's \"behavior has been\r\nprovocative, such as physically blocking people going down the hall.\"  Another note characterized\r\nappellant as \"manipulative\" in his behavior.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tVarious notes showed numerous instances of misconduct.  Appellant deliberately knocked\r\ndown a peer's toys.  He kicked the walls in the hallway and banged on the chair in his room.  He\r\nrefused to follow directions during a fire alarm, and when staff tried to redirect him, he became\r\n\"combative\" and was \"fighting, cursing, and threatening.\"  Because another resident \"was picking\r\non\" appellant and broke his nose, appellant said, \"I'm going to use my friend's gun to kill him.\" \r\nAppellant often sang rap songs with inappropriate lyrics that glorify drugs.  He refused to complete\r\na homework assignment because he \"refused to participate in school.\"  He threw books, used\r\nprofanity, and then threw chairs down the hall, causing a \"code yellow\" to be called.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe conclude that the purpose for which the TYC disciplinary records was offered - to show\r\nappellant's violent nature and inability to follow rules - was amply demonstrated by other evidence,\r\nincluding from defense witnesses.  We conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that any error with\r\nrespect to the introduction of the TYC disciplinary records did not contribute to appellant's\r\nconviction or punishment.  Points of error one and two are overruled.      <strong></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong><center>B.  Jail Escort Evidence</center>\r\n</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t</strong>In point of error four, appellant contends that the trial court erred in admitting evidence that\r\nthe use of an \"emergency response team\" to provide an escort to the courthouse for trial was an\r\noccasional but not common occurrence for prisoners and was based upon the risk they posed to\r\nthemselves and others.  Appellant argues that the evidence was irrelevant.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLonnie Tullis, a deputy with the Harris County Sheriff's Department and a part of the\r\nemergency response team, explained that an underground tunnel system connects the jail and the\r\ncourthouse and that prisoners walk the tunnel and take secure elevators to the courtroom.  Usually,\r\nprisoners are not physically escorted, but they are monitored by a closed-circuit camera.  Sometimes,\r\nhowever, a prisoner poses enough of a risk that he is escorted by the emergency response team. \r\nDeputy Tullis testified that appellant was provided such an escort for his trial.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEvidence is \"relevant\" if it has \"any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of\r\nconsequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be\r\nwithout the evidence.\"<sup> (34)</sup>  One fact of consequence at the punishment stage of a capital murder\r\nprosecution is \"whether there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of\r\nviolence that would constitute a continuing threat to society.\"<sup> (35)</sup>  That the authorities do not usually\r\nassign a personal escort but believed that appellant needed one has some tendency to make more\r\nprobable that appellant is the type of person who would commit criminal acts of violence in the\r\nfuture.<sup> (36)</sup>  Point of error four is overruled.  <strong></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong><center>C.  Child Protective Services and Hospital Record</center></strong>s\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn points of error seven through nine, appellant contends that the trial court erred in excluding\r\nfrom evidence records from Child Protective Services (CPS) and from Twelve Oaks Hospital.  He\r\nconcedes that the trial court was within its discretion to find that the evidence was hearsay, but he\r\nargues that the exclusion of the evidence violated his Fourteenth Amendment due process right to\r\npresent a defense and his Eighth Amendment right to present mitigating evidence in a death penalty\r\ncase.  He claims that his case fits under the first scenario of two scenarios outlined by this Court for\r\nwhen the exclusion of evidence rises to the level of a constitutional violation: when a state\r\nevidentiary rule categorically and arbitrarily prohibits the defendant from offering otherwise relevant,\r\nreliable evidence that is vital to his defense.<sup> (37)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\"[T]he exclusion of a defendant's evidence will be constitutional error only if the evidence\r\nforms such a vital portion of the case that exclusion effectively precludes the defendant from\r\npresenting a defense.\"<sup> (38)</sup>  Appellant claims that the CPS records in particular were vital because they\r\ndocumented his \"tragic childhood background\" and there were no available witnesses to testify\r\nregarding the information contained in the records.  Appellant does not explain in what manner his\r\nchildhood background was tragic, nor does he explain what information the records provide that he\r\nwished to have admitted into evidence, much less explain why this information could not have been\r\ngleaned from other sources.  And appellant provides no record citations for this argument.  An\r\nappealing party has an obligation to set out the facts relevant to his complaints, as well as to cite the\r\npertinent portions of the record.<sup> (39)</sup>  Appellant's claim is inadequately briefed and subject to rejection\r\non that ground alone.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNevertheless, as with a previous complaint, the State appears to have supplied the missing\r\ninformation, so we will, in the interest of justice, address appellant's claim in light of that\r\ninformation.  The CPS records contained hearsay statements from appellant's mother that she did\r\nnot want appellant, she has never wanted him, appellant was the product of date rape, and she had\r\nrelinquished her rights to appellant.  These statements were excluded by the trial court.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe CPS and hospital records also contained references to various medications.  The trial\r\ncourt appears to have been concerned whether certain of the drugs mentioned were actually being\r\ntaken by appellant: \"Well, this looks like just a list of different kinds of drugs.  If there is information\r\nthat he was on those drugs, then fine; but if it's something that just happened to get stuck in here -\"\r\nthen the trial court was going to sustain the objection.  The trial court was aware that appellant was\r\ntaking Zyprexa and ruled the references to that medication to be admissible. But the court invited\r\ndefense counsel to show the relevance of other medications, or else the trial court would sustain the\r\nState's objection.  Defense counsel then read from a document that, among other things, said, \"Dr.\r\nButtar would like [appellant] to continue on Zyprexa, Depakote, Paxil and have Ativan, if needed\r\nfor agitation.\"  Apparently distracted by the prosecutor placing the document from which defense\r\ncounsel was reading in front of her face, the trial court asked, \"Zyprexa and what else?\"  Defense\r\ncounsel responded, \"Depakote, Ativan\" and expressed uncertainty regarding a different name for\r\nAtivan.  The trial court then sustained the State's objection to references to Benzodiazopine and\r\nPaxil, but allowed the references to Zyprexa and Depakote.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTo preserve error regarding the exclusion of evidence, a party must not only tell the judge\r\nthat the evidence is admissible, but he must also explain why the evidence is admissible.<sup> (40)</sup>  And the\r\nexplanation given at trial must match the one urged on appeal.<sup> (41)</sup>  For example, an explanation for\r\nadmissibility based upon the Rules of Evidence does not preserve a claim that admission of the\r\nevidence is required by the Confrontation Clause.<sup> (42)</sup>  Moreover, a defendant's right to present a\r\ndefense is the type of claim that is forfeited if it is not specifically urged at trial.<sup> (43)</sup></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the present case, the State argued that the evidence was hearsay, while the defense argued\r\nthat the evidence fell within the hearsay exception for medical diagnosis and treatment.<sup> (44)</sup>  The\r\ndefense never argued that admission was required by any provision of the United States or Texas\r\nConstitutions.  Nor did the defense argue that the evidence was crucial to appellant's ability to\r\npresent a defense.  With respect to the statements made by appellant's mother, defense counsel\r\nargued just the opposite: \"The third reason is that virtually everything that the State objected to is\r\nalready in the record anyway by the witnesses that have testified.\"  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAnd with respect to the drug evidence, another preservation problem arises: The trial judge's\r\nexclusion of references to one of the drugs - Paxil - may have been based on an erroneous\r\nrecollection of the record.<sup> (45)</sup>  Though Paxil was listed as one of the drugs appellant was taking in a\r\npassage that was initially read to the trial court, when asked to repeat the relevant drugs, defense\r\ncounsel repeated only \"Depakote and Ativan.\"  Appellant has failed to preserve error for review.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEven if error had been preserved, however, appellant's claims would fail.  Though appellant\r\nwas unable to introduce his mother's statements about never wanting him, his grandmother, second\r\ncousin, and uncle testified that his mother did not want her child and had relinquished her parental\r\nrights.  In addition, the defense expert testified that appellant's mother's parental rights had been\r\nterminated.  And as explained above, the trial court did allow evidence of most (if not all) of the\r\nmedications appellant was taking.  In addition, the defense expert read from one of the records a\r\ndetailed list of some the medications appellant had received and read a notation that appellant was\r\non a \"record-breaking number of psychiatric medications.\"  Appellant was able to present the\r\nsubstance of the mitigating-circumstances case to which the excluded evidence related.<sup> (46)</sup>  The fact\r\nthat he was \"not able to present his case in the form he desired does not amount to constitutional\r\nerror.\"<sup> (47)</sup>  Points of error seven through nine are overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe affirm the judgment of the trial court.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Delivered: January 13, 2010</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Do not publish\r\n<p>1.

Appellant refers to exhibit numbers and quotes from the record, but he does not provide\r\nthe actual record references.  Although appellant has probably conveyed enough information to\r\nenable this Court to locate the portions of the record relied upon, the provision of record references\r\nwould make such an effort easier.  Fortunately, the State provided the relevant record references in\r\nits brief.  We need not decide whether appellant has failed to comply with his duty to provide\r\n\"citations . . . to the record\" under Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(h) in this instance, but we caution that a party\r\nshould always provide the volume and page numbers for any material from the record upon which\r\nthe party relies.  \r\n</p><p>5. <em>  Sonnier v.
