La. Office of Cmty. Servs., 47 F.3d 1438,\n\n1448 (5th Cir 1995) (citation omitted); see also Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co.\n\nv. White, 548 U.S. 53, 68 (2006) (reminding that Title VII “does not set forth ‘a\n\ngeneral civility code for the American workplace.’”) (quoting cases).\n\n      Mercieca’s case rests solely on a subjective suspicion that a co-worker\n\ncomplained about him because, at some undefined time, for some unexplained\n\nreason, his entire management chain “conspired to launch their secret anti-\n\nMercieca campaign,” as he puts it, and used the co-worker as a pawn in their\n\n“secret” scheme. Appellee’s Br. at 36. This theory—even if it had any factual\n\nbasis, which it does not—does not correspond to a claim under the Texas Labor\n\nCode (“TCHRA”). Therefore, in response to Microsoft’s appeal, Mercieca does\n\nnot offer a coherent, linear narrative explaining how the evidence he adduced\n\nprovides     a    legally   sufficient   basis   to   satisfy   the   elements   of   a\n\nretaliation/constructive discharge claim under Section 21.055 of the TCHRA.\n\nInstead, he does what he did at trial: masks the absence of relevant facts with a\n                                            1\n\fscattershot recitation of his subjective take on various isolated incidents, some\n\ndating back a decade before he engaged in the claimed “protected activity,” and\n\nsome that date well after he filed suit—and even after he finally left his job with\n\nMicrosoft voluntarily seven months later.1\n\n       In struggling to defend the jury’s findings, Mercieca grossly misrepresents\n\nthe actual substance of the hodgepodge of evidence adduced at trial. For instance:\n\n    He insists that his performance “became an issue for the first time in his\n     career at Microsoft” only after he complained about his managers on April\n     19, 2010. Appellee’s Br. at 51. In fact, the evidence shows that his annual\n     review for 2005—five years earlier—noted that his current “role was not\n     going to work out as a career choice” and indicated that he “did not meet\n     expectations.” 18RR:MSFT7. Thereafter, his 2006 midyear review still\n     noted “needs improvement” in multiple categories. 18RR:MSFT8.\n\n    Similarly, he claims that he only got a poor review in September 2011\n     because Eddie O’Brien, a Microsoft vice president, issued an “edict” to rate\n     him at the lowest performance level. Appellee’s Br. at 15, 51. But Mercieca\n     entirely ignores the uncontroverted evidence about how and why he was\n     ranked as he was relative to his larger sales group by the person who\n     actually prepared the review. See TAB J; 10RR20-29.\n\n    Further, Mercieca asserts that, in “mid-2009 to early 2010,” his managers\n     “made unsolicited comments about Mercieca needing a job.” Appellee’s Br.\n     at 27. The incidents to which he alludes happened well before he claims to\n     have engaged in any protected activity and thus, as explained below, cannot\n     be “retaliation” under the TCHRA. Moreover, no one ever told him that he\n     “needed to find a new job,” as Mercieca spins it. Id. He relies, for instance,\n     on a joke O’Brien made in the summer of 2009 after Mercieca had\n     performed with a band at a Microsoft event. Mercieca testified that,\n     “[O’Brien] said that -- he said that if -- I could get my friend, Bono, from U2\n\n       1\n          In a two-week trial, Mercieca testified for days about his subjective perception of\nisolated incidents spanning over a decade. 5RR92-268; 6RR220-278; 7RR6-277; 8RR5-221;\n9RR6-67.\n\n                                             2\n\f      to give you a job.” That Mercieca found it “strange” in 2009 that O’Brien\n      teased Mercieca about joining one of the most popular bands in history is\n      hardly evidence that Mercieca was constructively discharged in 2012.\n      8RR81-82.\n\n    Additionally, to support the incorrect assertion that he was told to look for\n     another job, Mercieca refers to announcements regarding positions within\n     Microsoft, sent to him before April 19, 2010, that would have resulted in\n     promotions. 18RR:MSFT39, 18RR:MSFT63. That he, who had initially\n     worked for Microsoft in Australia and was from England, thought it “weird”\n     that he was invited to apply for significant promotions to positions in New\n     Zealand (on October 6, 2009) and in Europe (on February 11, 2010) is not\n     evidence that he was constructively discharged in 2012.\n\n    Equally inaccurate is his claim that, in a phone call on April 15, 2010, his\n     direct supervisor “told Mercieca he needed to find a new job.” Appellee’s\n     Br. at 27. The transcript of that call, which Mercieca secretly recorded,\n     reveals that Mercieca spent over 40 minutes haranguing his supervisor, who\n     hardly spoke. 11RR9-52. After he had reduced her to tears, he was the one\n     who demanded: “Are you telling me to look for another job?,” to which she\n     answered, “No.” 11RR30-31. Mercieca later told HR that she had\n     threatened to fire him during this conversation, 7RR238-39, but that\n     characterization was as untrue then as it is now.\n\n    He also incorrectly asserts that a Microsoft HR director told his managers\n     that they should “let it go” with respect to the co-worker’s complaints about\n     Mercieca because there was “nothing there.” See Appellee’s Br. at 51. To\n     support this reputed “fact,” he cites nothing but his own testimony—\n     8RR217—when he attempted to explain the basis for his view that a\n     “conspiracy” had been launched against him; his testimony is, however,\n     nothing more than rank speculation.\n\n      Ultimately, the most compelling “evidence” to which Mercieca’s brief refers\n\ndoes not exist. The evidence actually adduced at trial does not satisfy the standard\n\nof legal sufficiency to support a finding of retaliatory constructive discharge, as a\n\nmatter of law.\n\n\n                                         3\n\f                               ARGUMENT IN REPLY\n\n      Mercieca’s brief pays relatively little attention to the core issue of whether\n\nthere was legally sufficient proof to support the jury’s liability findings. This is\n\nbecause the record is bereft of evidence to support the findings of (1) constructive\n\ndischarge, (2) good faith engagement in a protected activity, or (3) but-for\n\ncausation; thus there are three distinct reasons for reversing and rendering a take-\n\nnothing judgment for Microsoft. Additionally, if the Court were to reach the\n\nmultiple damages issues raised in the appeal and cross-appeal—which Microsoft\n\nrespectfully suggests will be unnecessary—the damages evidence is so flawed that\n\nit amounts to no evidence at all, thus also warranting reversal and rendition.\n\nI.    MERCIECA PROVIDES NEITHER LAW NOR EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT A\n      CONCLUSION THAT MICROSOFT RETALIATED AGAINST HIM BY\n      COMPELLING HIS CONSTRUCTIVE DISCHARGE.\n\n      A. Mercieca Provides Neither Law Nor Evidence to Support the Jury’s\n         Constructive Discharge Finding.\n\n         1. Mercieca has no law to support the constructive discharge\n            finding.\n\n      Mercieca has no legal support for his position that the proof adduced at trial\n\nis sufficient to sustain the jury’s finding that he was constructively discharged. In\n\nresponding to Microsoft’s legal sufficiency challenge, Mercieca instead leans\n\nheavily on a breach of contract case. Appellee’s Br. at 25-26 (citing Vaughan v.\n\nHartman Mmgt., 2010 WL 5514335 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] Dec. 28,\n\n2010, pet. denied) (mem. op.)). The charge-error issue in Vaughan is irrelevant to\n                                          4\n\fthe issue of the quantum and quality of proof required to support a constructive\n\ndischarge finding. Microsoft has not raised a charge-error issue in this appeal.\n\nThe issue is whether Mercieca adduced a scintilla of evidence that satisfies the\n\ncorrect legal standard, which was accurately articulated by the trial court in the\n\njury charge: did his employer make “conditions so intolerable that a reasonable\n\nperson in the employee’s position would have felt compelled to resign.” TAB A,\n\nQuestion 7.\n\n      None of the constructive discharge cases cited in Mercieca’s brief supports\n\nthe notion that (1) the evidence of workplace incidents Mercieca adduced represent\n\nconditions so “intolerable” as to reasonably compel a resignation or (2) a person\n\ncan sue his employer and then resign months later, as he did, declaring his\n\nunilateral decision a retaliatory constructive discharge. For example, Mercieca\n\ncites Carlton v. Houston Cmty. Coll., 2012 WL 3628890 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st\n\nDist.] Aug. 23, 2012, no pet.) (mem. op.), which affirmed the trial court’s decision\n\nto grant summary judgment for defendant on plaintiffs’ retaliation claims. The\n\nCarlton plaintiffs had complained of: being passed over for promotions, “effective\n\ndemotions and reduced responsibilities,” an “unfair” investigation of “sexual\n\nharassment complaints,” and other “hostile acts.” Id. at *12. “[A]s a matter of\n\nlaw,” the allegations did “not rise to the level of an adverse employment action.”\n\nId. at *13.\n\n\n                                         5\n\f      One of Mercieca’s few reported TCHRA cases, Passons v. Univ. of Tex. at\n\nAustin, 969 S.W.2d 560, 564-65 (Tex. App—Austin 1998, no pet.), is also a\n\ncharge-error case—again, not an issue that Microsoft has raised. In Passons, the\n\ncourt of appeals reversed based on the trial court’s erroneous instruction that the\n\nplaintiff was required to show that the claimed discrimination was the “sole cause”\n\nor “the basis” for the reputed constructive discharge.       Id. at 562 (emphasis\n\nretained). To determine whether the charge error was harmful, the court evaluated\n\nthe record and concluded that “we cannot say that the cumulative effect of the\n\nconduct here could not support a jury finding of constructive discharge.” Id. at\n\n564. In reaching this conclusion, Passons notes evidence that, during a discrete\n\nperiod following an audit, the plaintiff was “more harshly punished than were her\n\nmale counterparts for engaging in” the same misconduct, that she “was threatened\n\nwith criminal and financial sanctions which she contends were unjustified and\n\nhumiliating,” and that “her supervisors belittled and demeaned her in front of her\n\nown staff, preventing her from effectively doing her job.” Id. As discussed below,\n\nMercieca adduced no comparable evidence. But even Passons recognized that\n\n“mere harassment, without more, is insufficient” to create an issue of material fact\n\nas to whether workplace conditions were objectively intolerable. Id. (citing Bates\n\nv. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist., 952 S.W.2d 543, 551 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1997, writ\n\ndenied)).\n\n\n                                         6\n\f      By contrast, Wal–Mart Stores, Inc. v. Itz illustrates what can constitute\n\nlegally sufficient evidence of constructive discharge. 21 S.W.3d 456 (Tex. App.—\n\nAustin 2000, pet. denied). In Itz, the court of appeals relied on evidence, in\n\naffirming judgment for the plaintiff, that the plaintiff’s supervisor: repeatedly\n\ncalled her at home at night to ask about her relationship status; promised to put her\n\nup in an apartment if she broke up with her boyfriend; complimented her body;\n\ntouched her inappropriately during a one-on-one back-room meeting; was “‘always\n\nhovering around her and following her’”; gave her a “‘very forceful’” “‘body-to-\n\nbody’” hug; pressed her to break up with her boyfriend; and after she reported this\n\nconduct, the employer did not respond to her at all.        Id. at 462-65, 473-75.\n\nMercieca did not adduce evidence of anything remotely akin to such conduct.\n\n      Surprisingly, Mercieca suggests that the jury was “entitled” to adopt his\n\nconstructive discharge theory because his situation at Microsoft resembles the\n\ncircumstances presented in Emeritus Corp. v. Blanco, 355 S.W.3d 270 (Tex.\n\nApp.—El Paso 2011, pet. denied). Appellee’s Br. at 30. Emeritus affirmed a\n\nconstructive discharge claim brought by a whistleblower against an assisted living\n\nfacility. Plaintiff Blanco, an administrator, was brought in to try to right a non-\n\ncompliant facility. Id. at 272. She left her job after less than one year, thereafter\n\nfiling suit. The evidence showed that, during her brief tenure, her employer failed\n\nto take action to remedy the following: “medications [were] not being properly\n\ndocumented or dispensed, proper medical attention [was] not being provided and\n                                         7\n\faddressed, documentation to the residents charts [was] not being properly charted,\n\ncommunication to the doctors [was] not up to date[.]” Id. at 275. At one point,\n\nBlanco was called to an Alzheimer patient’s room, where the patient was lying in\n\nbed with a mass protruding from her body. Id. at 273. Blanco had to track down a\n\nnurse in another facility because hers did not have a single nurse on staff; she then\n\nagonized as the patient “suffered from multiple issues while waiting for surgery.”\n\nId. at 274. Instead of responding to Blanco’s requests for support, her employer\n\n“formally reprimanded” Blanco for permitting the facility to get “behind on\n\nbilling.” Id. She thereafter resigned, providing a detailed list of the concerns that\n\nhad shaken her, with an entreaty “that you immediately address these concerns to\n\nensure the safety and well being of the residents.” Id. at 275.\n\n      No evidence in the record supports the notion that Mercieca experienced any\n\ncomparable “conditions so intolerable” that his after-the-fact resignation can be\n\ndeemed objectively reasonable. Id. at 281.\n\n         2. Mercieca has no facts to support the constructive discharge\n            finding.\n\n      “‘[I]solated incidents (unless extremely serious)’ do not amount to\n\nactionable conduct” under either Title VII or the TCHRA. Satterwhite v. City of\n\nHouston, 602 F. App’x 585, 588 (5th Cir. 2015) (per curiam) (quoting Faragher v.\n\nCity of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 788 (1998)).        TCHRA and Title VII claims\n\n“based on isolated incidents of non-extreme conduct” are routinely rejected “as\n\n                                          8\n\finsufficient as a matter of law.” Id. (citing cases and finding plaintiff failed to\n\nmake a prima facie case of retaliation).2 This is true under both federal and state\n\nlaw. See, e.g., Tiner v. Tex. Dep’t of Transp., 294 S.W.3d 390, 395 (Tex. App.—\n\nTyler 2009, no pet.) (finding that the plaintiff “did not show that the working\n\nconditions were unbearable, or that her employer was attempting to encourage her\n\nto resign.”)\n\n       In Tiner, the court painstakingly considered the various incidents upon\n\nwhich the employee relied, in the light most favorable to the employee, and found\n\nthose incidents, taken together, did not amount to intolerable conditions as a\n\nmatter of law. Id. at 394-97. Tiner merits considerable attention, because the\n\nisolated incidents at issue there are comparable to those upon which Mercieca\n\nrelies. See Appellee’s Br. at 27-29, 33-35.\n\n       First, Tiner insisted that her employer had mishandled a conflict with one of\n\nher co-workers. Tiner, 294 S.W.3d at 396. Likewise, Mercieca claims that his\n\nmanagers mishandled Tracy Rummel’s internal complaint about his conduct, that\n\n\n       2\n          In Satterwhite, the plaintiff was actually demoted and received a salary cut at the\nrecommendation of the supervisor about whom the plaintiff had complained for allegedly saying\n“Heil Hitler” in a meeting. 602 F. App’x at 586. By contrast, Mercieca experienced no\ndemotion or salary cut. Satterwhite and the precedent upon which it rests are persuasive. While\nMercieca takes issue with Microsoft’s reliance on federal cases, this critique is unfounded, as the\nSupreme Court of Texas has “consistently held that those analogous federal statutes and the\ncases interpreting them guide [its] reading of the TCHRA.” Mission Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist. v.\nGarcia, 372 S.W.3d 629, 634 (Tex. 2012). Similarly, he asserts that Microsoft has no “on-point\nauthority” to support the type of constructive discharge theory pursued here. Appellee’s Br. at\n19, 37. What is true is that neither party can point the Court to any case in which a constructive\ndischarge claim has been maintained based on facts similar to those Mercieca adduced at trial.\n\n                                                9\n\fhe felt “marginalized” as a result, and that he had to file his own internal complaint\n\nagainst his management chain to learn what had happened to Rummel’s complaint.\n\nTAB E; Appellee’s Br. at 8, 9, 27. But the evidence shows that, after Rummel took\n\nher initial concerns to Mercieca’s manager, to her own Microsoft manager, and to\n\nits HR department, Microsoft directed her to follow up with the contracting agent\n\nthen employing her.3 18RR:MSFT48-50. Then, after Rummel became a full-time\n\nemployee, she reached out again to Microsoft’s HR department after experiencing\n\nwhat she saw as repercussions attributable to Mercieca. TAB F. While Mercieca\n\nthreatened “legal escalation” unless he was told what Rummel had said about him\n\nduring her confidential interview, Microsoft explained that doing so would violate\n\ncompany policy; however, Microsoft kept him fully informed as the investigation\n\nmoved       forward.      18RR:MSFT105;           18RR:MSFT126;           18RR:MSFT97;\n\n18RR:MSFT115.\n\n       Second, Tiner insisted that her own complaints were ignored, despite\n\nevidence that the employer conducted an internal investigation, as Mercieca does.\n\n294 S.W.3d at 396.         The evidence here shows that Microsoft conducted an\n\nextensive investigation into both Rummel’s and Mercieca’s HR complaints.\n\n18RR:MSFT260. Microsoft found insufficient evidence that its anti-discrimination\n\n\n       3\n         As noted in the Appellant’s brief, when Rummel first raised her concerns about\nMercieca, she was employed as a contract employee through an agency and assigned to work\nwith Mercieca on marketing issues for some of Mercieca’s Microsoft “partner”/client accounts.\nAppellant’s Br. at 6-7.\n\n                                             10\n\for anti-harassment policies had been violated in either instance, but reprimanded\n\nAulds for failing to disclose that she had once had a brief romantic relationship\n\nwith Mercieca, which they had both kept to themselves until 2010 when he\n\nproduced evidence of photocopied love letters and voicemails from 2001-2002\n\nduring the ERIT investigation. 18RR:MSFT178; 18RR:MSFT189. Aulds was\n\nthen removed from his management chain. 6RR83-85; 10RR68-69. No evidence\n\nsupports Mercieca’s insistence that she was “promoted” after the reprimand.4\n\nLikewise, no adverse employment action against Mercieca resulted from the\n\ninternal investigation,5 although the investigator found reason to suspects his\n\nmotives. 18RR:MSFT178; 6RR75-79; TAB M.\n\n       Third, Tiner insisted that the co-worker with whom she had difficulty was\n\n“abusive, threatening, and unpleasant”—which Mercieca cannot reasonably\n\nclaim—yet the court of appeals found the proffered evidence “no basis to conclude\n\nthat [the employer] somehow created unendurable working conditions” or that this\n\nsituation “caused Tiner to resign months later.” 294 S.W.3d at 397. Similarly,\n\nMercieca complains that Aulds was permitted to give him a review in 2010\n\n\n       4\n         Appellee’s Br. at 14 (citing testimony that contradicts the contention that she was\n“promoted,” 6RR183-84; 11RR86-87, and Mercieca’s subjective testimony that he nevertheless\nregarded the change as a promotion, 6RR218-19).\n       5\n          As addressed in the Appellant’s brief, poor performance evaluations, which an\nemployee views as unfair, cannot form the basis of a constructive discharge claim. Appellant’s\nBr. at 20-21, 30-31, 36-37. Regardless, Mercieca did not receive the poor review about which he\ncomplains until September 8, 2011, well after members of his management chain had changed\nand long after Rummel’s HR complaint against him had been resolved. 18RR:MSFT216; TAB J.\n\n                                              11\n\f(Appellee’s Br. at 14, 28) while his HR complaint about her was pending. Yet (1)\n\nthat review was largely positive; and (2) he did not resign until nearly two years\n\nlater, well after Aulds had been removed from his management chain entirely and\n\nreplaced by someone he liked and admired. 18RR:MSFT166; 7RR144;\n\n18RR:MSF394; TAB I.\n\n      Fourth, Tiner insisted “that her supervisor got into an argument with her,\n\nended her access to his email, and stopped talking to her”—yet the court of appeals\n\nheld that this conduct did “not rise to the level of conduct designed to badger,\n\nharass, or humiliate Tiner,” and found no basis to “conclude that the conduct was\n\ncalculated to encourage her resignation.” Id. at 395. Here Mercieca relies heavily\n\non these kinds of communication issues, including his subjective interpretation of\n\nemails as unduly “scrutinizing” his work. See, e.g., 18RR:MSFT57-60.\n\n      Fifth, Tiner complained about the tone of meetings with her supervisors, as\n\nMercieca does. 294 S.W.3d at 396. Mercieca, however, points to nothing in any\n\nmeeting that could be viewed objectively as “badgering, harassing, or humiliating\n\nor that [] was calculated to encourage [him] to resign.” Id. Indeed, the meetings\n\nand phone calls with his colleagues that Mercieca secretly recorded show his\n\nmanagers talking with him about business concerns and trying to resolve\n\ncommunication issues as he raised them. 18RR:MSFT58-MSFT61. Furthermore,\n\nas in Tiner, the meetings with his direct supervisor (Lori Aulds) and skip-level\n\n\n                                        12\n\fmanager (David Tannenbaum) about which Mercieca complains “took place\n\nmonths before [he] resigned.” 294 S.W.3d at 396.\n\n      In short, Tiner, like Mercieca, “was not satisfied with the way her supervisor\n\nhandled [a] situation.” Id. at 397. But such subjective frustration “does not rise to\n\nthe level of an adverse employment action.” Id. Like Tiner, Mercieca “was not\n\nfired or demoted, [he] was not reassigned or suspended. The minor actions that did\n\noccur do not represent meaningful changes in the conditions or privileges of [his]\n\nemployment.” Id.; 8RR65-70.\n\n         3. Mercieca’s scattershot approach            to   proving    constructive\n            discharge is legally impermissible.\n\n      Tiner helps to illuminate the fundamental failings of Mercieca’s constructive\n\ndischarge proof. But Mercieca’s constructive discharge theory is burdened by\n\nadditional analytical problems not present in Tiner. First, the incidents upon which\n\nTiner focused all happened within a discrete timeframe, while Mercieca’s\n\nperceived slights are scattered over a period of years. Second, Tiner’s incidents all\n\nhappened before she resigned, thus conceivably supporting a claim that they\n\ncompelled her departure.      Mercieca did not resign until months after suing\n\nMicrosoft. CRS11-33; TAB J.\n\n      The isolated incidents about which Mercieca complains were (and remain)\n\nuntethered to any discrete time that could rationally be relevant to his reputed\n\nconstructive discharge. Many of the incidents listed in his brief as comprising the\n\n                                         13\n\f“constructive discharge puzzle” can be disregarded, in accordance with basic rules\n\nof cause and effect. Appellee’s Br. at 27-30. To begin with, Mercieca’s initial HR\n\n“formal complaint,” dated April 19, 2010, describes concerns that do not relate to\n\nany anti-discrimination or anti-harassment policy. TAB E; TAB M at MS37863.\n\nAlthough Mercieca now tries to recast the April 2010 complaint as a “charge of\n\ngender discrimination,”6 events that predate his April 2010 complaint cannot\n\nlogically show that he was constructively discharged as retaliation for making that\n\ncomplaint. Appellee’s Br. at 32.\n\n       For instance, Mercieca relies on the brief affair he had with Aulds in 2001.7\n\nHe then describes comments Aulds made to him in 2008, when he fully supported\n\nher for the position of manager of his sales group.8 Id. at 5-6; 33-35.\n\n       After emphasizing the 2001 affair, Mercieca restarts his narrative in “mid-\n\n2009 and early 2010,” stating that “[o]n April 15, 2010”—several days before he\n\nhad lodged any complaint against his managers—“Aulds told Mercieca he needed\n\nto find a new job.” Id. at 27. To support this statement, Mercieca cites his own\n\ntestimony in which he refers to a phone call he had with Aulds, which he secretly\n\nrecorded. Id. (citing 9RR61). The transcription of that phone call does not support\n\n       6\n         At trial, Mercieca asked the jury to find that his alleged constructive discharge was\nmotivated by his age or his national origin, which the jury declined to do. Tab A, Question 8.\n       7\n         Mercieca continues to reference a “sexual harassment” claim made in June 2010\npremised on his 2001 relationship with Auld, which Microsoft investigated and found baseless\nand which even Mercieca dropped before the formal charge conference. CRS520-521; TAB A.\n       8\n           See, e.g., 8RR259-61; 8RR264-65; 8RR267; 18RR:MSFT10.\n\n                                             14\n\fhis representation that she told him he “needed to find a new job.” 11RR9-52.\n\nMoreover, the call cannot be evidence of retaliatory constructive discharge, as\n\nMercieca had not yet made the reputed charge of discrimination. Even Mercieca’s\n\nself-serving (and inaccurate) testimony about this call shows that he was having\n\ncommunication problems with Aulds in “e-mail traffic going backwards and\n\nforwards” about his expense reports or “T&Es.” 5RR238. Mercieca’s prickliness\n\nin communications with his supervisor predated any alleged protected activity and\n\nhad nothing to do with allegations of discrimination.       16RR:PX35; see also\n\n11RR9-52; 18RR:MSFT20; 18RR:MSFT21; 18RR:MSFT40; 18RR:MSFT55;\n\n18RR:MSFT57. This dispute about expense reports cannot reasonably be deemed\n\npart of what “compelled” him to resign years later.\n\n       Similarly, Mercieca cites his own testimony, in which he states that, leading\n\nup to March 26, 2010, he felt “subjected to a lot of harassment, bullying, and\n\nretaliation.”   9RR7.   First, Mercieca’s subjective beliefs “are insufficient to\n\nestablish a prima facie case” of an unlawful employment practice. Chandler v.\n\nCSC Applied Techs., LLC, 376 S.W.3d 802, 814 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n2012, pet. denied). Second, even Mercieca did not attribute his discomfort in the\n\nmonths leading up to his HR “formal complaint” to discrimination. In that HR\n\ncomplaint, he claimed that he felt “marginalized” because Rummel’s concerns\n\nabout him had “led to an escalation within HR” and to his management team, and\n\nhe found it “extremely upsetting” that “[a]t no time was I ever consulted about this\n                                         15\n\fby anyone.” TAB E. Feeling “marginalized” and distressed because Rummel had\n\nvoiced concerns about him cannot be evidence that Microsoft unlawfully retaliated\n\nagainst him for memorializing those feelings in an HR complaint that had not yet\n\nbeen made. Whatever Mercieca felt before April 19, 2010 when he engaged in the\n\nalleged protected activity does not prove that afterwards Microsoft retaliated by\n\nmaking circumstances so “intolerable” that a reasonable person would have been\n\ncompelled to resign two years later.\n\n       Additionally, some of Mercieca’s purported evidence that he was\n\n“constructively discharged” hinges on material that he only learned of through\n\nlitigation.   For instance, he refers obliquely to a “plan” to “eliminate” him.\n\nAppellee’s Br. at 8, 27. His reputed proof of this “plan” is an internal Microsoft\n\ndocument—emailed on April 16, 2010 between two upper-level managers—\n\ndescribing a proposed “FY11 Field Sales Team Structure.”              16RR:PX152\n\n(proposing, inter alia, eliminating Mercieca’s sales position as duplicative). There\n\nis no evidence that Mercieca ever saw this document while he worked at\n\nMicrosoft. The document was prepared in response to a directive from upper\n\nmanagement about the need to consider workforce reductions throughout the\n\norganization—and the proposal was never implemented.          6RR57-62.     Despite\n\nMercieca’s post-resignation efforts to seize upon this document as confirming his\n\nsuspicions, this internal discussion about a potential workforce reduction is\n\nunremarkable.      Regardless, this evidence does not and cannot support a\n                                        16\n\fconstructive discharge finding. Mercieca did not know about this document and,\n\nas is evident by the fact that Microsoft continued to employ him for another two\n\nyears until he voluntarily left, the plan was not implemented. Furthermore, as the\n\nproposal was made before Mercieca had lodged any HR complaint against his\n\nmanagers, it cannot conceivably be considered “retaliation” against Mercieca for\n\nan HR complaint he had not yet made. Compare 16RR:PX152 with TAB E.\n\n      Equally unsound is Mercieca’s reliance on incidents that occurred after he\n\nhad already sued Microsoft and even after he finally announced his departure. For\n\ninstance, Mercieca cites as evidence of intolerable conditions his testimony about a\n\npotential “FY2012” evaluation that never took place. Appellee’s Br. at 16, 29.\n\nMercieca’s last review was a mid-year review conveyed to him on March 9,\n\n2012—several days after he had already resigned (via a letter sent from his\n\nlitigation counsel to Microsoft’s outside counsel on February 22, 2012).\n\nMercieca’s manager at that time, Joe Sahagian, only commenced giving the review\n\nbecause Mercieca had not told Sahagian about the decision to resign, “effective\n\nApril 2, 2012,” until they were in the middle of the review. TAB I; 10RR216. An\n\nevent that never occurred and another that occurred only after a person has already\n\nresigned cannot evidence “intolerable” conditions that compelled the resignation.\n\n      Mercieca’s alleged constructive discharge is premised entirely on his\n\nsubjective interpretation of isolated incidents scattered over a ten-year period. This\n\nis an insurmountable problem. He cannot articulate specific events, related in time\n                                         17\n\fto his decision to leave Microsoft, that the law recognizes as supporting a finding\n\nof objectively intolerable workplace conditions sufficient to compel a reasonable\n\nperson to resign.    Even if the isolated incidents in Mercieca’s “constructive\n\ndischarge puzzle” could be amassed together, they are legally insufficient to show\n\nintolerable conditions and thus actionable retaliation under the TCHRA.          But\n\nisolated incidents “cannot be lumped together” to try to prove a discrete act, like a\n\nconstructive discharge. Univ. of Texas-Pan Am. v. Miller, 2013 WL 4818355, *8\n\n(Tex. App.—Austin Aug. 28, 2013, no pet.) (mem. op.); see also Pegram v.\n\nHoneywell, 361 F.3d 272, 280-81 (5th Cir. 2004) (finding various discrete\n\nemployment actions not actionable under continuing violations doctrine); Ptomey\n\nv. Tex. Tech Univ., 277 S.W.3d 487, 494 (Tex. App.–Amarillo 2009, pet. denied)\n\n(rejecting reliance on “events occurring between 1997 and [plaintiff’s] termination\n\nin 2002” to prove employment experience was one of continuous discrimination).\n\n      B.     Mercieca Has No Evidence of Good Faith Engagement in a\n             Protected Activity.\n\n      The    TCHRA      “protects   from      retaliation   employees   who   oppose\n\ndiscriminatory employment practices.” San Antonio Water Sys. v. Nicholas, --\n\nS.W.3d --, 2015 WL 1873217, *1 (Tex. Apr. 24, 2015). As the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt has recently stated, when “no reasonable person could have believed” that\n\nthe complained-of conduct “gave rise to an actionable sexual-harassment [or\n\ndiscrimination] claim,” the employee cannot show that he “engage[d] in a\n\n                                         18\n\fprotected activity under the TCHRA.” Id. at *1, *2 (vacating jury finding for\n\nplaintiff on retaliation after concluding plaintiff “did not engage in a protected\n\nactivity under the TCHRA”).\n\n      This Court recently articulated the correct standard for satisfying the\n\nprotected-activity element.    See Warrick v. Motiva Enter., L.L.C., 2014 WL\n\n7405645, *7 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] Dec. 30, 2014, no pet.) (mem. op.).\n\nTo qualify as a protected activity, “[t]he employee must put the employer on notice\n\nthat the employee is opposing practices that the [employee] believes constitute\n\nprohibited discrimination.” Id. (quoting numerous cases). “[T]he relevant inquiry\n\nis not [the employee’s] intentions in sending [for instance an] e-mail, but whether\n\nher opposition to proscribed discriminatory practices was discernible in the e-mail\n\nitself.” Id. at *8 (citing Harris-Childs v. Medco Health Solutions, Inc., 169 F.\n\nApp’x 913, 916 (5th Cir. 2006) (holding employee produced no evidence that\n\n“when she made her complaints to management, [she] ever mentioned that she felt\n\nshe was being treated unfairly due to her race or sex”)).\n\n             1. Mercieca’s first HR complaint does not evidence good-faith\n                engagement in a TCHRA-protected activity.\n\n      Mercieca now endeavors to recast his first HR complaint, submitted on April\n\n19, 2010, as a charge of “gender-based discrimination.” Appellee’s Br. at 32. To\n\nsupport this characterization, Mercieca directs the Court away from the HR\n\ncomplaint itself—which says nothing about discrimination of any kind. TAB E.\n\n                                         19\n\fInstead, Mercieca points to a subsequent complaint that Mercieca made, which he\n\nmentioned at some point during the internal ERIT investigation that commenced\n\nafter June 9, 2010. Appellee’s Br. at 32. During that investigation, Mercieca\n\nsuggested that he had been offended by an email that O’Brien had sent to his entire\n\nU.S. sales team touting “Two Female Promotions to Director in USOEM!” TAB N.\n\nMercieca does not direct the Court to the reputedly offending email, but to a\n\nsummary of the entire internal investigation of his HR complaints. Appellee’s Br.\n\nat 32 (citing 16RR:PX125). The summary upon which Mercieca relies notes that\n\nhe did not mention discrimination of any kind until after he was notified in May\n\n2010 that Rummel’s allegations were to receive an ERIT investigation:\n\n\n\n\nTab M at MS37863.\n\n      Regardless of whether O’Brien’s May 2010 email could be read objectively\n\nas offensive—as opposed to an effort to celebrate gender diversity within company\n\nmanagement—it is not evidence that Mercieca’s April 2010 HR complaint alleged\n\ndiscrimination.   First, his April 2010 HR complaint was made weeks before\n                                        20\n\fO’Brien’s email was sent. TAB G. A complaint about an email sent in May 2010\n\ncannot support a finding that his April 2010 complaint informed Microsoft of a\n\ncharge of “gender discrimination.” Second, Mercieca’s invocation of the O’Brien\n\nemail would not have put Microsoft on notice that Mercieca was claiming\n\ndiscrimination or sexual harassment.    “For workplace comments to provide\n\nsufficient evidence of discrimination, the comments must be,” inter alia, “(1)\n\nrelated to the plaintiff’s protected class, (2) proximate in time to the adverse\n\nemployment decision, … and (4) related to the employment decision at issue.”\n\nChandler, 376 S.W.3d at 816. The O’Brien email was not about a class to which\n\nMercieca belonged; the email was sent nearly two years before Mercieca resigned;\n\nand the email was unrelated to any employment decision that affected Mercieca.\n\nTAB N.\n\n      Mercieca’s April 2010 HR complaint speaks for itself and confirms what the\n\nrecord otherwise shows: that in late February 2010, Mercieca learned from Aulds\n\nthat Rummel had raised a concern about Mercieca’s behavior and that Rummel had\n\nreported her concerns; he then began demanding an “exoneration” regarding a\n\n“baseless rumor” about him that he felt Rummel had authored and Aulds had\n\nneedlessly referred to HR. 7RR159; 7RR161-64. An objective reading of the\n\nApril 2010 complaint (TAB E) and his communications with HR leading up to the\n\nemailing of that complaint (18RR:MSFT64; 18RR:MSFT67) show that his conduct\n\ndid not qualify as a TCHRA-protected activity. See, e.g., Warrick, 2014 WL\n                                       21\n\f7405645 at *8-*9 (explaining that employee’s email did not qualify as TCHRA-\n\nprotected activity because it only accused a co-worker of “unethical conduct,”\n\nstated that she had written “the EEOC about how the [other] employee” was\n\n“stealing time,” and “alleged serial bullying” but did not notify employer of\n\nmistreatment “based on a protected characteristic”).     Instead, the April 2010\n\ncomplaint confirms, as Mercieca later testified, that he felt “betrayed” that his\n\nmanagers had been “talking behind his back” about Rummel’s concerns and had\n\nnot come first to him—a long-time employee—about the concerns of a mere\n\n“contract” worker. 7RR168-170. During his initial conversations with HR, he did\n\nnot mention sexual harassment or discrimination based on gender or national origin\n\nor any other protected ground. 12RR19-27; 12RR31-32; 12RR35. As he said at\n\nthe time, he was motivated to submit a counter HR complaint, directed against his\n\nmanagers, to “play the percentage shot.” 7RR183.\n\n            2. Mercieca’s second HR complaint does not evidence good-faith\n               engagement in a TCHRA-protected activity.\n\n      As explained in the Appellant’s brief, the “supplementation” that Mercieca’s\n\nlawyer submitted to Microsoft’s HR department on June 9, 2010 on Mercieca’s\n\nbehalf does not evidence a good faith claim of discrimination. Appellant’s Br. at\n\n41-43; see also TAB M at MS37863 (noting “it was not until [Mercieca] was\n\nnotified of the ERIT investigation in May 2010 [of Rummel’s allegations] that he\n\nraised his allegations of discrimination.”). The “supplementation” does not add\n\n                                       22\n\fany concrete information regarding his grievances; it contains only conclusory\n\nassertions that he is complaining of “harassing, discriminatory, and retaliatory\n\nconduct based on his gender and national origin” and “sexual harassment,” words\n\ninvoked solely to trigger a Microsoft ERIT investigation of his grievances. TAB G;\n\n8RR41-41;       11RR216-217;        18RR:MSFT97;         18RR:MSFT313.          The\n\n“supplementation” was only submitted after Mercieca and his lawyer had learned\n\nfrom a Microsoft ERIT investigator that Mercieca’s April 2010 complaint did not\n\nfall within the scope of the company’s anti-discrimination and anti-harassment\n\npolicies. 18RR:MSFT97; 18RR:MSFT115; 18RR:MSFT74; 18RR:MSFT78-80.\n\nOnly after the investigator had explained at length precisely why Mercieca’s\n\ngrievances fell outside ERIT’s scope did Mercieca’s lawyer prepare the June 9\n\n“supplementation” including, for the first time, vague charges of discrimination.\n\n      As this Court has explained, “[a] vague charge of discrimination will not\n\ninvoke protection under the statute.” Azubuike v. Fiesta Mart, Inc., 970 S.W.2d\n\n60, 65 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1998, no pet.). Vague references to\n\ndiscrimination and harassment do not “put the employer on notice that the\n\ncomplaint was based on” unlawful employment practices. Harris-Childs, 169 F.\n\nApp’x at 916.\n\n      Even assuming that Mercieca subjectively believed that what he had\n\nexperienced was unlawful “discrimination” or “sexual harassment,” his belief is\n\n\n                                        23\n\finsufficient as a matter of law. “Subjective beliefs of discrimination alone are\n\ninsufficient to establish a prima facie case.”\n\n      C.     Mercieca Has No Evidence of Actionable Retaliation.\n\n             1.     Mercieca has no evidence of causation.\n\n      An employer cannot conceivably retaliate against an employee for engaging\n\nin a protected activity until after the employee engages in something that qualifies\n\nas TCHRA-protected conduct. See, e.g., Zaffuto v. City of Hammond, 308 F.3d\n\n485, 493 (5th Cir. 2002) (holding that the plaintiff failed to state a Title VII\n\nretaliation claim where the record demonstrated that his suspension occurred\n\nbefore he engaged in the protected activity); Soledad v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury,\n\n304 F.3d 500, 507 (5th Cir. 2002) (affirming grant of summary judgment on\n\nretaliation claim where there was little evidence to show that the defendant “took\n\ncertain actions because of [plaintiff’s] protected activity”). Further, Texas law\n\nrequires evidence of but-for causation: “plaintiff must establish ‘but for’ causal\n\nnexus between the protected activity and the prohibited conduct.” Chandler, 376\n\nS.W.3d at 823 (finding “no evidence [plaintiff] engaged in the protected activity of\n\ncomplaining that he was not included [on trip list] because of his race and was then\n\nsubsequently terminated”) (emphasis retained).\n\n      To try to elude his causation problem, Mercieca has continuously shifted this\n\nretaliation theory. For instance, in his opening statement, Mercieca’s counsel\n\nsuggested that his managers’ motivation for “retaliating” against him was “because\n                                          24\n\fhe’s got no high school education, he’s got no college education.” 3RR205. In\n\nclosing, Mercieca’s counsel argued that Microsoft was motivated by Mercieca’s\n\nage (which no one at trial knew) and his national origin (British). 12RR121-22.\n\nAge discrimination was not even mentioned in his EEOC charge or in either of his\n\ninternal HR complaints. TAB E & TAB G.\n\n      Now, on appeal, Mercieca suggests that Microsoft “conspired to launch their\n\nsecret anti-Mercieca campaign” after he “report[ed] the O’Brien incidents.”\n\nAppellee’s Br. at 36. Indeed, that “campaign” was so “secret” that he has no\n\nevidence to support it. Moreover, this newest theory does not help him establish\n\ncausation because Mercieca only complained about O’Brien’s comments (which\n\nwere neither about, nor directed at, Mercieca) after Rummel had expressed\n\nconcerns about his conduct and after he had complained to HR because his\n\nmanagers had listened to her. Compare TAB E with TAB N. Moreover, his alleged\n\n“constructive discharge” was nearly two years thereafter. TAB I. In short, there is\n\nno evidence of any adverse employment action proximate to any protected activity,\n\nthus no causation. See Chandler, 376 S.W.3d at 816 (finding plaintiff presented\n\n“no evidence” that racially derogatory comments “were made close to the time of\n\nthe adverse employment decision at issue” and thus could not support TCHRA\n\nclaims).\n\n\n\n\n                                        25\n\f             2. Mercieca has no cognizable theory, only impermissibly stacked\n                inferences to support his so-called “secret anti-Mercieca\n                campaign.”\n\n      Mercieca’s brief confirms that he has never had a cognizable retaliation\n\ntheory. He relies on a conspiracy theory based entirely on suspicion and stacked\n\ninferences. 8RR211-12. “[A]n inference stacked only on other inferences is not\n\nlegally sufficient evidence.” Marathon Corp. v. Pitzner, 106 S.W.3d 724, 728\n\n(Tex. 2003) (citing Lozano v. Lozano, 52 S.W.3d 141, 148 (Tex. 2001)).\n\n      A claim cannot withstand a legal sufficiency challenge by recourse to\n\ninferences derived “from meager circumstantial evidence.” Wright v. Wal-Mart\n\nStores, Inc., 73 S.W.3d 552, 555 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2002, no pet.).\n\n“[A] vital fact may not be established by piling inference upon inference.”\n\nSchlumberger Well Surveying Corp. v. Nortex Oil and Gas Corp., 435 S.W.2d 854,\n\n858 (Tex. 1968). Evidence that is “‘so weak as to do no more than create a mere\n\nsurmise or suspicion’” of its existence is, in legal effect, no evidence. Akin, Gump,\n\nStrauss, Hauer & Feld, L.L.P. v. Nat’l Dev. and Research Corp., 299 S.W.3d 106,\n\n115 (Tex. 2009) (citation omitted). “‘[S]ome suspicion linked to other suspicion\n\nproduces only more suspicion, which is not the same as some evidence.’”\n\nMarathon, 106 S.W.3d at 728 (citations omitted). Mercieca’s evidence equates to\n\nnothing more than what the cases describe as “mere surmise or suspicion.” T.O.\n\nStanley Boot Co. v. Bank of El Paso, 847 S.W.2d 218, 222 (Tex. 1992).\n\n\n                                         26\n\f      One aspect of Mercieca’s disparate retaliation theories has been consistent:\n\nhe believes that his managers listened to Rummel’s concerns about him and then\n\nlater “encouraged” her to “revive” those concerns by going to HR after he\n\nsubmitted his April 2010 HR complaint objecting to his managers’ failure to\n\n“consult” with him about Rummel’s concerns first.           8RR252; 8RR257-58;\n\n11RR70-76.     He has repeatedly characterized Rummel’s concerns as a “false\n\nsexual harassment” complaint. For instance, in Mercieca’s statement of the case,\n\nhe describes his retaliation claim this way: “Microsoft retaliated against him …\n\n[and] caused or encouraged another Microsoft employee to file a false sexual\n\nharassment charge against him.” Appellee’s Br. at 1; see also CRS6-10; TAB H\n\n¶53 (alleging a “campaign of retaliation against” him).\n\n      Even if such a theory could form the basis of actionable retaliation, no\n\nevidence, only rank speculation, supports Mercieca’s theory that some “secret anti-\n\nMercieca campaign” was launched against him through Tracy Rummel.\n\nAppellee’s Br. at 36. There is no evidence that anyone “caused or encouraged”\n\nRummel to complain about Mercieca. 4RR150-51.\n\n      Moreover, there is no evidence that Rummel ever filed a “false sexual\n\nharassment charge.” The uncontested evidence shows that, starting in November\n\n2009, Rummel spoke to various Microsoft personnel about her concerns. She\n\nspoke to Mercieca directly about her concerns. Then, after she joined Microsoft as\n\na full-time employee, Rummel experienced repercussions from having told\n                                        27\n\fMercieca about her concerns, including being removed from an account that she\n\nworked on with him. Therefore, she took these concerns to an HR director.\n\n9RR201; 16RR:P25-A; 4RR95-106; TAB F. The HR intake form that resulted\n\ndoes not support an inference that Rummel had been “encouraged” to bring\n\n“sexual harassment” allegations against Mercieca, as he suggests. The intake form\n\nnotes the same issues Rummel had raised a few months earlier: that Mercieca had\n\ntried to diminish her in front of a client by suggesting that she and he were dating\n\nand by making inappropriate comments that were sexual in nature. TAB F. The\n\nform also notes her new concern that, a few days after she spoke to Mercieca, a\n\nMicrosoft business partner asked that she be removed from his account. Id.\n\n      Mercieca cites nothing in the record to support the contention that Rummel’s\n\nstatements, as recorded by HR, were actually false. For instance, when Rummel\n\ncalled Mercieca to discuss her concerns about comments he had made at a client\n\ndinner, Mercieca threatened to “circle back” to those who had attended the event.\n\n9RR57; 16RR:P25-A. Mercieca followed through on his threat; and the client\n\nrepresentative to whom Mercieca “circled back” was Jason von Cordsen of Bass\n\nComputers. Von Cordsen, called by Mercieca at trial as a witness, admitted that\n\nnine days after the client event in question, he declared publicly at a Microsoft-\n\nsponsored meeting that he was not “getting any value” from Rummel so he wanted\n\nher taken off the account she was working on with Mercieca. 10RR84-86. In light\n\n\n                                        28\n\fof this testimony,9 Mercieca has no basis for suggesting that Rummel’s statement,\n\nas reported on the HR intake form, was false:\n\n\n\n\nTAB F.\n\n          Mercieca also admitted at trial that he had invited Rummel—a young, single\n\nwoman—to stay at his house when she was in town and that he had made\n\ncomments at a client dinner that made her uncomfortable, as the HR intake form\n\nstates.       Compare id. with 8RR45-46, 9RR32, 4RR86-90.              Indeed, the partial\n\nrecording he secretly made of his conversation with Rummel shows that he knew\n\nhe had said things at a client dinner, for instance, about “playing guitar in [her]\n\nbedroom,” that had caused her concern. 4RR87.\n\n          The “evidence” Mercieca offered to buttress his suspicion that Rummel was\n\nput up to making a complaint against him is no evidence at all: (1) a cell phone\n\nrecord showing that Rummel, a Microsoft employee, called Aulds, a Microsoft\n\nmanager in Rummel’s division, at various times, including the day that Rummel\n\n\n          9\n         Von Cordsen also admitted that he was told about the confidential HR complaints\nbrought by and about Mercieca and that his sole source of information about these internal HR\nmatters was Mercieca himself. 10RR123-124.\n\n                                             29\n\ffollowed-up with HR about Mercieca (PX243); and (2) an indemnification\n\nagreement that Microsoft executed with Rummel after Mercieca sued her (PX245).\n\nAppellee’s Br. at 12, 16.10         A “secret anti-Mercieca campaign” (let alone\n\nactionable retaliation) cannot reasonably be inferred from this evidence.\n\nMarathon, 106 S.W.3d at 728 (reminding that suspicion “is not the same as some\n\nevidence”).\n\n       These efforts to spin a conspiracy out of stacked inferences epitomizes the\n\nconcerns described in the seminal legal sufficiency case City of Keller v. Wilson,\n\n168 S.W.3d 802, 813-14 (Tex. 2005). In Keller, the Texas Supreme Court used, as\n\nan example, evidence that a macaroni salad was spilled on a grocery store’s floor.\n\nThe court considered whether that fact could be used to support an inference that\n\nthe grocery store was on notice of the spill: “one might infer from cart tracks in\n\nspilled macaroni salad that it had been on the floor a long time, but one might also\n\ninfer the opposite—that a sloppy shopper recently did both.” Id. at 814. As the\n\ncourt explained, the competing inferences negate each other and amount to no\n\nevidence: “When the circumstances are equally consistent with either of two facts,\n\nneither may be inferred.” Id. at 813.\n\n       Rummel and Aulds independently denied talking about Rummel’s complaint\n\nagainst Mercieca after Rummel first sought guidance from Aulds in November\n       10\n          The Appellee’s brief only mentions the indemnification agreement, which was\nimproperly admitted, in passing, but the agreement was a focal point for Mercieca at trial.\n4RR157; 4RR276-78; 12RR106-107; 12RR112-133.\n\n                                            30\n\f2009 and Aulds referred Rummel to HR. 4RR150-51; 11RR74.                   Moreover,\n\nMercieca admitted that he had no evidence that his complaints were “leaked” to\n\nAulds or Rummel to help prepare a complaint against him. 9RR38. Even if the\n\njury disregarded Rummel’s testimony about why she went back to HR when she\n\ndid, that would “[n]ormally . . . not [be] considered a sufficient basis for drawing a\n\ncontrary conclusion.” Mathis v. Lockwood, 166 S.W.3d 743, 745 (Tex. 2005)\n\n(quoting Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of U.S., Inc., 466 U.S. 485, 512 (1984)).\n\nRummel, like Mercieca, had a right to go to HR about her concerns under the\n\ncompany’s open-door policy.       18RR:MSFT235B; 11RR227-229.            There is no\n\nevidence showing that Microsoft would have done anything differently but for\n\nMercieca’s internal HR complaints. See Chandler, 376 S.W.3d at 823 (finding no\n\nevidence of but-for causation to support a retaliation claim).\n\nII.   ALTERNATIVELY, MERCIECA’S DAMAGES EVIDENCE IS SO TAINTED THAT\n      THE ONLY REMEDY IS TO REVERSE AND RENDER JUDGMENT FOR\n      MICROSOFT.\n\n      The damages problems in this case, should the Court reach them, are so\n\nfundamental as to warrant a reversal and rendering of judgment in Microsoft’s\n\nfavor. See Houston Unlimited, Inc. v Mel Acres Ranch, 443 S.W.3d 820 (Tex.\n\n2014) (finding damages evidence legally insufficient and reversing and rendering a\n\ntake-nothing judgment in the defendant’s favor).\n\n\n\n\n                                         31\n\f      A. The Back-Pay Award Is Unsustainable.\n\n      Back pay, as Mercieca acknowledges, may be awarded by a district court\n\nunder the TCHRA to compensate for a “prohibited employment action.”\n\nAppellee’s Br. at 38. Here, there was no prohibited employment action, so no\n\nback-pay award was proper. Moreover, the court had no discretion to make this\n\n$623,065 award based on a jury finding that utterly ignored the instruction to\n\naccount for Mercieca’s failure to mitigate his damages. Mercieca’s only response\n\nis that he had no duty to mitigate his damages while still employed by Microsoft.\n\nAppellee’s Br. at 41. This is correct—a fortiori, he cannot, as a matter of law or\n\nequity, recover for a claim alleging a “constructive discharge” brought when he\n\nwas still gainfully employed by Microsoft.      Additionally, Mercieca cites no\n\nevidence of any job search other than Mercieca’s unsubstantiated testimony that he\n\nlooked at “a great many” job prospects. Id. at 41-42. He cannot cite anything\n\nspecific because no evidence of any job applications exists.       “A conclusory\n\nstatement is one that does not provide the underlying facts to support the\n\nconclusion.” Methodist Hosp. v. Zurich Am. Ins. Co., 329 S.W.3d 510, 530 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2009, pet. denied). And a conclusory statement does\n\nnot even create a fact issue. Id.\n\n      B. The Compensatory Damages Award Is Unsustainable.\n\n      The compensatory damages award (of $300,000) is based on two jury\n\nfindings devoid of evidentiary support: a finding of $1,000,000 in mental anguish\n                                       32\n\fdamages and $9,999,999.24 in punitive damages. The capped amount, although\n\nwell below what the jury awarded,11 cannot stand because no evidence supports it.\n\n       Mercieca incorrectly insists that the jury was free to make whatever mental\n\nanguish award it liked since the charge did not define the term. Appellee’s Br. at\n\n42. For this proposition he cites Jefferson Cnty v. Davis, 2014 WL 4262184 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] Aug. 28, 2014, pet. filed) (mem. op.). This citation is\n\nan odd choice as the case resulted in zeroing-out a $500,000 mental anguish award.\n\nId. at *9-*10.\n\n       The more apt authority is Seminole Pipeline Co. v. Broad Leaf Partners,\n\nInc., 979 S.W.2d 730, 753 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1998, no pet.), in\n\nwhich this Court noted that “[e]motional distress is a subjective injury that is hard\n\nto predict, often speculative, easily fabricated, difficult to verify, and almost\n\nimpossible to refute.” These pitfalls are precisely why the Supreme Court has\n\ntaken pains “to fashion principles permitting recovery for severe emotional distress\n\nwhile maintaining constraints and safeguards against those who are merely\n\ndisappointed, embarrassed, or angry.” Id. Mercieca’s alleged distress does not\n\nsatisfy the standard because “liability does not extend to mere insults, indignities,\n\nthreats, annoyances, petty oppressions, or other trivialities[.]” Id. at 753-54.\n\n       11\n          Mercieca’s counsel invited error by urging the jury to award $1,000,000 in mental\nanguish and “ten million or more” in punitive damages knowing full well that this was a capped\ncase. 12RR125; 12RR131.\n\n\n\n                                             33\n\f      Mercieca expressed his view that his experience at Microsoft was “soul\n\ndestroying,” and his brief, citing his own testimony as evidence, states that he\n\n“now suffers from depression, for which he takes medication, and his sleep is\n\nerratic.” Appellee’s Br. at 44. Yet his personal therapist/expert acknowledged at\n\ntrial that the only mental disorder with which Mercieca had been diagnosed,\n\nstarting in 2003, was “adjustment disorder,” not depression, for which he was\n\nprescribed Lexapro, an anti-depressant, which he first took in 2001 after his\n\ndivorce. 9RR110-118; 9RR15. This diagnosis—which was consistent through\n\n2011—was made over a decade before his alleged “constructive discharge.” Id.\n\nAdditionally, the “stressors” to which Mercieca’s therapist attributed his condition\n\nwere, initially, a dysfunctional sexual relationship and then a child-custody dispute\n\nwith his ex-wife that had required police intervention and resulted in Mercieca\n\nbeing placed in handcuffs.     Id.   Mercieca’s therapist’s testimony established\n\nuncontrovertibly that Mercieca’s mental-health issues began years before Rummel\n\nraised concerns about his conduct in November 2009. As Mercieca’s brief states,\n\n“the Bass Computers function” in November 2009 was “the event that started it\n\nall” with respect to his grievances against Microsoft. Appellee’s Br. at 13. His\n\nlong-standing mental distress, which predates the Bass Computers event by over\n\nsix years, cannot be evidence of compensable “mental anguish damages” that\n\nresulted from a constructive discharge that he claims occurred two years\n\nthereafter. TAB A, Question 14.\n                                         34\n\f       Moreover, to support an award of mental anguish damages, “[t]here must be\n\nboth evidence of the existence of compensable mental anguish damages and\n\nevidence to justify the amount awarded.” Hancock v. Variyam, 400 S.W.3d 59, 68\n\n(Tex. 2013) (emphasis added).      Mercieca’s testimony regarding his anxieties\n\ncannot justify the $1,000,000 finding that is the basis for the trial court’s award.\n\nIndeed, a case Mercieca suggests is analogous—where the court found sufficient\n\nevidence to uphold a mental anguish award—is completely inapposite.             See\n\nBennett v. Grant, 2015 WL 1324857 (Tex. App.—Austin Mar. 20, 2015, no pet.).\n\nBennett affirmed an award of only $5,000 in mental anguish damages where the\n\nplaintiff had had to move repeatedly to protect himself from threats of violence\n\nfrom the defendant and had evidence of pronounced symptoms engendered by the\n\nstress. Id. at *11.\n\n      Likewise, in seeking to defend the punitive damages finding, Mercieca\n\nrattles off a selective list of his subjective view of events entirely denuded of\n\ncontext. Appellee’s Br. at 51-52. His description of these events cannot withstand\n\nscrutiny upon looking at the evidence itself. For example, Mercieca refers to\n\nTannenbaum’s answer to a hypothetical question from Mercieca’s lawyer about\n\nwhat Aulds might have intended when she discussed Mercieca’s “mental state with\n\nMercieca’s partner”—i.e., with Jason von Cordsen, a client representative of Bass\n\nComputers. Appellee’s Br. at 52. By looking at the testimony of von Cordsen\n\nhimself—the only witness, other than Aulds, privy to the conversation to which\n                                        35\n\fMercieca alludes—one finds that he did not view the conversation as retaliatory,\n\nmalicious, or in any way negative:\n\n          . . . it sounded like [Aulds] was\n      genuinely concerned about Michael's state of\n      paranoia, that -- that Michael -- Michael was\n      just overdocumenting things and – and asking\n      questions of other people, if you know, to --\n      to where it just seemed to her that he was\n      extremely paranoid and -- and something was\n      going on.\n\n          And I know that there was a taped\n      conversation between me and Michael that\n      evening and -- over the phone and I -- I had\n      brought up to Michael that I genuinely thought\n      -- at the time, I genuinely thought that --\n      that they were -- they were concerned for him.\n\n10RR92. Von Cordsen also described Aulds as “very professional” during this\n\nconversation.    10RR127. Therefore, Mercieca’s reliance on how a different\n\nwitness, with no personal knowledge of this conversation, responded to a leading\n\nquestion is no evidence of Microsoft’s “malice.”\n\n      When the standard is “clear and convincing,” as it is with punitive damages,\n\ncourts “must consider all the evidence,” not just the evidence favorable to the\n\njury’s finding. Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 817 (emphasis retained). That would include\n\nthe evidence of Microsoft’s independent internal investigation, which revealed that\n\nMercieca, not his managers, seemed animated by suspect motives. See, e.g., TAB\n\nM. Even if Mercieca’s self-serving and inaccurate representatives of the evidence\n\n\n\n                                        36\n\fare believed, on their face, these events do not amount to clear and convincing\n\nevidence of malice or reckless indifference on Microsoft’s part.\n\n       C. The Attorneys’ Fee Award Is Unsustainable.\n\n       Finally, the attorneys’ fees award (of $769,505.98 plus $192,376.50\n\nenhancement) cannot stand because it reflects an exercise of discretion that was\n\n“‘so arbitrary and unreasonable as to amount to a clear and prejudicial error of\n\nlaw.’” Winters v. Chubb & Son, Inc., 132 S.W.3d 568, 580 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 2004, no pet.) (citation omitted). As explained in the Appellant’s\n\nbrief, the evidence used to support the fee award, which was calculated based on\n\nthe lodestar method, is so facially suspect that it amounts to no evidence.\n\nTherefore, relying on that evidence in the wake of the Texas Supreme Court’s\n\nrecent mandates regarding the proof required to support an attorneys’ fee award is\n\nindefensible. See El Apple I, Ltd. v. Olivas, 370 S.W.3d 757 (Tex. 2012);12 City of\n\nLaredo v. Montano, 414 S.W.3d 731, 736 (Tex. 2013) (reaffirming El Apple and\n\nconfirming that hyperbolic testimony as “evidence” of attorneys’ fees is\n\nunacceptable). Mercieca’s counsel admitted before the trial court that they had\n\nmanufactured their billing records instead of relying on contemporaneous records\n\nthat they claimed existed, yet failed to produce; and the trial court’s fee award fails\n\nto account for the rampant improprieties and defects in those “records” that are\n       12\n          El Apple begins its analysis by citing Hensley v. Echerhart, 461 U.S. 424 (1983), which\nfirst required attorneys seeking fee awards in employment discrimination cases to present\ndetailed hourly time records and to segregate issues and claims in their bills.\n\n                                               37\n\fevident on their face. 19RR:MSFT411. The court then inexplicably enhanced the\n\naward, without indicating what, if any, factors might justify that decision, despite\n\nMicrosoft’s request for findings and conclusions. TAB C.\n\n       Mercieca devotes substantial space to arguments under the relevant lodestar\n\nfactors to suggest what the trial court might have had in mind. Appellee’s Br. at\n\n59-83. But see El Apple, 370 S.W.3d at 765 (accepting that a lodestar derived from\n\na “legitimate base” is presumptively reasonable while noting that an enhancement\n\nmust be justified). None of Mercieca’s arguments can redeem the illegitimate base\n\nused to support his request for a fee award. Indisputably, a trial court abuses its\n\ndiscretion by awarding fees based on flagrantly unreliable evidence. United Nat’l\n\nIns. Co. v. AMJ Invests., LLC, 447 S.W.3d 1, 16 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n2014, pet. dism’d) (holding that party choosing to use lodestar method is “required\n\nto introduce sufficient evidence to allow the factfinder to apply it.”).\n\n       Because every aspect of the damages award made to Mercieca is based on\n\nlegally insufficient evidence, the only appropriate relief is to reverse and render a\n\ntake-nothing judgment—should the Court even reach those issues.\n\n                      CONCLUSION AND PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, as well as those described in the Appellant’s\n\nbrief, Microsoft asks that the Court reverse and render a take-nothing judgment for\n\nMicrosoft and award any other relief to which Microsoft shows itself justly\n\nentitled.\n                                          38\n\fRespectfully submitted,\n\nBECK REDDEN LLP\n\nBy: /s/ Gretchen S.

You may discuss the case with other jurors only\n         when you are all together in the jury room.\n\n                Remember my previous instructions: Do not discuss the case with anyone else, either in\n         person or by any other means. Do not do any independent investigation about the case or\n         conduct any research. Do not look up any words in dictionaries or on the Internet. Do not post\n         information about the case on the Internet. Do not share any special knowledge or experiences\n         with the other jurors. Do not use your phone or any other electronic device during your\n         deliberations for any reason.\n\n                 Any notes you have taken are for your own personal use. You may take your notes back\n         into the jury room and consult them during deliberations, but do not show or read your notes to\n         your fellow jurors during your deliberations. Your notes are not evidence. Each of you should\n         rely on your independent recollection of the evidence and not be influenced by the fact that\n         another juror has or has not taken notes.\n\n                 You must leave your notes with the bailiff when you are not deliberating. The bailiff will\n         give your notes to me promptly after collecting them from you. I will make sure your notes are\n         kept in a safe, secure location and not disclosed to anyone. When you are released from jury\n         duty, the bailiff will promptly destroy your notes so that nobody can read what you wrote.\n\n                  Here are the instructions for answering the questions:\n\n                            1. Do not let bias, prejudice, or sympathy play any part in your ~~rn1Tha District Court\n                                                                                             of Travis County, Texas\nFlied In The District Court\n of Travis County, Texas                                    1\n\n      MAY -5 2014\nM                S'iiS(p./>M,                                                    1185\nArnall• Rodrfguez-Mendoza, Cleric\n\f                        DC           BK141 28 PG381\n\n\n\n\n2. Base your answers only on the evidence admitted in court and on the law that\n   is in these instructions and questions. Do not consider or discuss any evidence\n   that was not admitted in the courtroom.\n\n3. You are to make up your own minds about the facts. You are the sole judges\n   of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to give their testimony. But\n   on matters of law, you must follow all of my instructions.\n\n4. If my instructions use a word in a way that is different from its ordinary\n   meaning, use the meaning I give you, which will be a proper legal definition.\n\n5. All the questions and answers are important. No one should say that any\n   question or answer is not important.\n\n6. Answer \"yes\" or \"no\" to all questions unless you are told otherwise. A \"yes\"\n   answer must be based on a preponderance of the evidence unless you are told\n   otherwise. Whenever a question requires an answer other than \"yes\" or \"no,\"\n   your answer must be based on a preponderance of the evidence unless you are\n   told otherwise.\n\n   The term \"preponderance of the evidence\" means the greater weight of\n   credible evidence presented in this case. If you do not find that a\n   preponderance of the evidence supports a \"yes\" answer, then answer \"no.\" A\n   preponderance of the evidence is not mea5ured by the number of witnesses or\n   by the number of documents admitted in evidence. For a fact to be proved by\n   a preponderance of the evidence, you must find that the fact is more likely\n   true than not true.\n\n7. A fact may be established by direct evidence or by circumstantial evidence or\n   both. A fact is established by direct evidence when proved by documentary\n   evidence or by witnesses who saw the act done or heard the words spoken. A\n   fact is established by circumstantial evidence when it may be fairly and\n   reasonably inferred from other facts proved.\n\n8. Do not decide who you think should win before you answer the questions and\n   then just answer the questions to match your decision. Answer each question\n   carefully without considering who will win. Do not discuss or consider the\n   effect your answers will have.\n\n9. Do not answer questions by drawing straws or by any method of chance.\n\n10. Some questions might ask you for a dollar amount. Do not agree in advance\n    to decide on a dollar amount by adding up each juror's amount and then\n    figuring the average.\n\n11. Do not trade your answers. For example, do not say, \"I will answer this\n    question your way if you answer another question my way.\"\n                                 2\n\n\n\n                                                      1186\n\f                                        DC          BK14128 PG382\n\n\n\n\n               12. Unless otherwise instructed, the answers to the questions must be based on the\n                   decision of at least ten of the twelve jurors. The same ten jurors must agree on\n                   every answer. Do not agree to be bound by a vote of anything less than ten\n                   jurors, even if it would be a majority.\n\n               13. You are the sole judges of the credibility or believability of each witness and\n                   the weight to be given to his or her testimony. In weighing the testimony of a\n                   witness you should consider his or her relationship to the Plaintiffs or to the\n                   Defendants; his or her interest, if any, in the outcome of the case; his or her\n                   demeanor or manner of testifying; his or her opportunity to observe or acquire\n                   knowledge concerning the facts about which he or she has testified; his or her\n                   candor, fairness and intelligence; and the extent to which he or she has been\n                   supported or contradicted by other credible evidence. You may in short,\n                   accept or reject the testimony of any witness in whole or in part.\n\n       As I have said before, if you do not follow these instructions, you will be guilty of juror\nmisconduct, and I might have to order a new trial and start this process over again. This would\nwaste your time and the parties' money, and would require the taxpayers of this county to pay for\nanother trial. If a juror breaks any of these rules, tell that person to stop and report it to me\nimmediately.\n\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\n\n\n                                                                    1187\n\f                                      DC           BK14128 PG383\n\n\n\n\nOther Instructions and Definitions:\n\n1.

(To this dlJY I do not know specifically what the~ atregations are).\n\n       I was ur aware of the diKussion ti etwft'n Tracy and lori until I felt so concetned ar.d \"ncomfon:ab1e for\n       approximately 3 months and I requested a meeting with mv manager to bring ~ concer1u to her anennon.\n\n       In this meeting, which took place Monday February 22•d, I voiced rrry concerns about a conversation Ms. Rummel\n       and I had Monday 9\"' November 2009, where she stated comment$ had been made to her by peopl~ at the event\n       about mv behavior and it concerned her. Her comments were vague and didn't disclose either specifically what I\n       was supposed to have done or who had raised the issues with her, despite my asking her num41rous times. Ms\n       Rummell also confirmed many times that our conversation was between her and I and no further action or\n\n\n\n\n.:\n       investigation was required on my part.\n\n       My manager then confirmed:\n\n           l..   Ms Rummel had stayed at her home that weekend as friends, (Sunday November 8th}, and had spolcen to\n                 her about this.\n           2.    That my manager had directed Ms Rummel to talk to me which she did the following day - albeit under\n                 the guise of a private conversation. Clearly this was not true.\n           3.    My manager had escalated this to Marc Pisan, Tracy's manager and he subsequently escalated it to HR. I\n                 have since confirmed that my manager actually escalated to HR.\n           4.

My manager stated ei<plic1tly that what I was sensing was \"probably d11e to the allegation\n       Tracy had m;ide\"'\n\n       This was of course extrtirnely upsetting to me. At no time was I ever consulted about this by anyone. We had an off·\n       site in Oecember7'~ ·l.O'h wh•re all the mangers were present as was Mickv Shields from HR and no one took me\n       to one side to discuss this.

Approximately seven (7) weeks has passed since Mr. Mercieca's initial Formal\nComplailll and virtually nothing has been done to inform him as to what allegations have\nspecifically been made and/or to ascertain his account of events in relation to such specific\nallegations. As of June 8'11, Ms. Shields is just \"getting back to\" Mr. Mcrcieca under the email\nbeading which aptly summarizes Microsoft's continued inaction to minimize Mr. Mercieca's\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                             •\nsituation, \"Follow-up on your concern.\"\n\n         One would hope that after employing such an outstanding employee, repre.sentative, and\nambassador, Microsoft would kmJ\\v Michael Meccieca after l 6 years of service. To that end, the\nmost important thing to Mr. Mercieca is his name and reputation. It is paramount to him that he\nis cl.eared of any and all accusations and that his reputation is wholly restored. We sincerely\nhope that l'vficrosoft will start to address Mr. Mercicca's complaint with the attention that it\ndeserves.\n\n                                                     Sincerely,\n\n\n\n\n                                                     Roy A.

DISCOVERY CONTROL PLAN LEVEL\n\n              Plaintiff intends that discovery be conducted under Discovery Level 3.\n\n                                D.      PARTJES AND SERVICE\n\n       1.      Plaintiff, Michael Mercieca, is an individual who resides in Travis County, Texas.\n\n       2.      Defendant, Tracey Rummel, is an individual and resident of Harris County, Texas\n\nand has appeared and answered herein.\n\n       3.      Defendant, MICROSOFT CORPORATION, .is a Washington State corporation\n\nauthorized to do business and doing business in the State of Texas at all relevant times hereto, and\n\nhas appeared and answered herein.\n\n                             ID.     JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n\n       4.      The subject matter in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of this court.\n\n       5.      This court has jurisdiction over the parties because Plaintiff and the individual\n\n\n\n\n                                                  1\n                                                                                                        499\n\fDefendant are both Texas residents, and some or all of the employees and agents of Mjcrosoft\n\nCorporation that committed the acts described below work and reside in Travis County, Texas.\n\nAdditionally, Microsoft Corporation has four offices within the State of Texas, located in Austin,\n\nDallas, Houston and San Antoruo.\n\n        6.      Venue in Travis County is proper in this cause under the mandatory venue provision\n\n§15.017 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code because it is the county in which Plaintiff\n\nresided at the time of the accmal of Plaintiff's slander cause of action. Under such Code §15.004\n\nand 15.005, venue for all of Plaintiffs other causes of action also lies in Travis County because\n\nsuch other causes of action arise out of the same transaction, occurrence or series of transactions or\n\noccurrences as Plaintiff's slander cause of action.\n\n        Alternatively, venue in Travis County is proper under the general venue provision of Code\n\n§15.002(a) (1) because it is the county in which all or a substantial part of the events or omissions\n\ngiving 1ise to Plaintiffs claim occurred.\n\n                                            IV.       FACTS\n\n        7.     Plaintiff is an individual residing in Travis County, Texas. He turned 50 years of\n\nage as of his birthday on August 22, 2010. He was born in London, England, has British, Australian\n\nand New Zealand citizenship status, and became a nationalized USA citizen in September 2010.\n\nPlaintiff was a Senior Sales Executive for Microsoft Corporation and wasa employed with\n\nMicrosoft around the globe for 17 years. Plaintiff consistently excelled with over quota sales\n\nperformance to much critical acclaim. Plaintiff received awards and much positive feedback from\n\nMicrosoft for his customer service and sales excellence and was widely recognized by his\n\ncustomers, partners, and his peers as one of the most passionate advocates for Microsoft and one\n\nof the most generous, compassionate, and supportive team players. Plaintiff was acknowledged\n\n\n\n\n                                                      2\n                                                                                                         500\n\fas a leader amongst his peers- he was a loyal, selfless, and inspiring friend and colleague and\n\nrecognized as the very embodiment of integrity. During his time at Microsoft, Plaintiff received\n\na number of Sales Recognition Awards, Long Service Awards and Customer Service Awards and\n\nwas the first recipient of the Sales District \"Spirit of the District Award\" at Microsoft. In\n\naddition, Plaintiff received numerous letters and e-mails of commendation from Microsoft\n\npartners and customers, and from his peers and colleagues.\n\n       8.      In or about September or October 2007, Lori Aulds, a Microsoft employee, became\n\nPlaintiff's direct manager. Plaintiff and Ms. Aulds had had a sexual relationship over a period of\n\nyears prior to her promotion as Plaintiff's direct manager. Plaintiff had ended such relationship\n\nsome time prior to Ms. Aulds's promotion to his manager. Ms. Aulds remained Plaintiff's direct\n\nmanager until in or about December 2010.\n\n       9.      Defendant. Rummel was an independent contractor hired through Xtreme\n\nConsulting to work for Microsoft as a contingent staffer \"CS\" and marketing consultant from on or\n\nabout November 2008 through on or about February 15, 2010. In February 15, 2010, she was hired\n\nby Microsoft as a full-time employee. Prior to being hired by Microsoft, Ms. Rummel had such a\n\nclose personal relationsfop with Ms. Aulds that they spent overnights together either at Ms. Aulds'\n\nhome or while away on business. In or about November 8, 2009, Ms. Rummel and Ms. Aulds\n\nspent the night together and allegedly Ms. Rummel advised Ms. Aulds that she was subjected to\n\nsexual harassment comments and actions by Mr. Mercieca.          Until Plaintiff filed this suit and\n\nconducted discovery, Plaintiff had not been told the substance of the actual allegations made by Ms.\n\nRummel to Ms. Aulds in November 8, 2009. Based upon information and belief, Ms. Rummel, in\n\nthis conversation with Ms. Aulds during this sleepover, accused Plaintiff of sexually harassing\n\nher. However, any statement made by Ms. Rummel to Ms. Aulds in or about November 8, 2009\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n                                                                                                       501\n\faccusing Plaintiff of \"sexual harassment\" was never communicated to Plaintiff by anyone,\n\nincluding by Ms. Rummel, until after Ms. Rummel's deposition was taken after this suit was filed.\n\n         10. It is undisputed that Ms. Rummel was not an employee of Microsoft in November of\n\n2009 and that Ms. Aulds was not a member of Microsoft's Human Resources at all times relevant\n\nto this suit.\n\n          11. Thereafter, in late 2009 and early 2010, Ms. Aulds began to unduly scrutinize and\n\ncriticize Plaintiff relative to his job performance and to discriminate against him in her treatment of\n\nhim as an employee versus the treatment received from her by other employees that she supervised.\n\nPlaintiff met with Ms. Aulds in or about February 2010 to discuss his concerns over such treatment,\n\nand his concerns about the hiring of Ms. Rummel since Plaintiff had heard complaints from\n\nMicrosoft partners/customers about Ms. Rummel. Ms. Aulds discouraged Plaintiff from going to\n\nHuman Resources with such concerns. Ms. Aulds specifically told Plaintiff that Ms. Rummel had\n\nnot filed any complaint against him. Ms. Aulds advised Plaintiff for the first time that Tracy\n\nRummel had related complaints of sexual harassment to her and that she had advised Human\n\nResources. In or about November of 2009, although Micky Shields told Ms. Aulds that the matter\n\nwas not an Human Resources issue since no complaint had been raised and no one had contacted\n\nher about any facts or complaint and that the matter would be closed and confidential, Ms. Aulds\n\ntook it upon herself to republish the false allegations made by Tracy Rummel and she passed it on\n\nto her boss David Tannebaum and then to his boss Eddie Obrien.\n\n         12. After the false allegations were passed on to Mr. Mercieca' s upper management by Lori\n\nAulds, Plaintiff began to be treated differently by his manager and upper management. On or about\n\nApril 19, 2010, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Lori Aulds and other managers with Microsoft's\n\nHuman Resources department, complaining of harassment, hostile work environment, and\n\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n                                                                                                          502\n\fdiscrimination based on sex, age and national origin. From that point on, Mjcrosoft's mistreatment\n\nand discriminatory treatment of Plaintiff intensified to include but not be limited to, a bad faith\n\ninvestigation by was perfonned on Plaintiff's formal complaint.\n\n       13 .   Ms. Aulds' s mistreatment and discriminatory actions towards Plaintiff included,\n\nwithout limitation, the following actions or omissions, some of which occurred after Plaintiff filed\n\nhis complaint with Microsoft Human Resources:\n\n               a.       Ms. Aulds did not have one-to-one meetings with Plaintiff in the same\n\n               amount and same frequency that she had with other employees she supervised;\n\n               b.       She urged Plaintiff to apply for a transfer within Mjcrosoft to a position in\n\n               Europe    or Australia/New Zealand,        and to Plaintiff's knowledge,        never\n\n               recommended him for a promotion to a position in the United States;\n\n               c.       She cut his expense budget when other employees similarly situated to\n\n               Plaintiff did not have their expense budgets cut;\n\n               d.       She prohibited him from attending important meetings, and important\n\n               conferences which he had attended in previous years, that were necessary for\n\n               Plaintiff to maintain good relationships with his Microsoft accounts, whereas other\n\n               employees she supervised who were younger than Plaintiff or less experienced than\n\n               Plaintiff, or had been employed for less time with Microsoft than Plaintiff, were\n\n               allowed to attend such conferences and meetings;\n\n               e.       She met and talked with Plaintiffs account customers without Plaintiff's\n\n               knowledge and participation to discuss their accounts and to tty and obtain adverse\n\n               infonnation about Plaintiff;\n\n               f.       She promised to support Plaintiff's request for a promotion, but then failed\n\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n                                                                                                        503\n\f                to do so;\n\n                g.      She deliberately failed to foiward to Plaintiff communications from his\n\n                customer accounts;\n\n                h.      She falsely accused Plaintiff of expense irregularities;\n\n                1.      She unduly scrutinized and questioned his request for vacation time;\n\n                J.      She failed to recognize project accomplishments of Plaintiff while\n\n                recognizing the accomplishments of other employees she supervised;\n\n                k.      She failed to assign lead roles to Plaintiff that should have been assigned to\n\n                him and that were assigned to similarly situated employees;\n\n                I.      She made disparaging comments about Plaintiffs nation of origin and\n\n                questioned his green card status and right to work for Microsoft;\n\n                k.      She falsely accused Plaintiff of improper office behavior; and,\n\n                I.      She conspired with David Tannebaum to give Mr. Mercieca a bad final\n\nreview, which ultimately David Tannebaum used to demote Mr. Mercieca to a level 5 OEM team\n\nmember when his manager at the time, Joe Sahagian, recommended Mr. Mercieca to a level 3.\n\n        14.     Ms. Aulds has admitted to Plaintiff that she could not handle her relationship to\n\nPlaintiff as his boss and insisted that Plaintiff look for another job.\n\n        15.     During Microsoft Human Resource' s official investigation of Plaintiff's complaint,\n\nMs. Aulds lied to the investigator, Dan Shea, and said that she had not had a prior sexual\n\nrelationship with Plaintiff in order to show Plaintiff as a liar. The lies Ms. Aulds told were key to\n\nthe investigation. Even though Microsoft subsequently became aware of Ms. Aulds lies during an\n\nofficial investigation, Microsoft subsequently promoted Ms. Aulds and demoted Mr. Mercieca.\n\nWhile the investigation was still ongoing David Tannebaum demanded the investigation end before\n\n\n\n\n                                                     6\n                                                                                                         504\n\fit was completed and before all of Mr. Mercieca's supporting witnesses were contacted.\n\n        16..   At or about the same time that Ms. Aulds was engaging in the above-described\n\nbehavior towards Plaintiff, other Microsoft managers engaged in similar mistreatment and\n\ndiscriminatory treatment of Plaintiff including, without limitation, the following acts and omissions,\n\nsome of which occurred after Plaintiff filed his complaint with Mjcrosoft Human Resources:\n\n               a.      Plaintiff was chastised by manager David Tannebaum for missing a deadline\n\n               by three hours, when other employees were not chastised for missing deadlines by\n\n               such short time frames;\n\n               b.      Plaintiff was accused by manager David Tannenbaum of not pe1fonning his\n\n               job adequately because of the length of time he remained at a certain grade whereas\n\n               other similarly situated employees were not similarly criticized;\n\n               c.      Plaintiff did not receive promotions which he should have received and\n\n               which were awarded to similarly situated employees and to American employees;\n\n               d.      Microsoft delayed its investigation and engaged in a bad faith investigation\n\n               of Plaintiff's complaint;\n\n               e.      Microsoft's Human Resources summarily dismissed Plaintiffs complaint\n\n               without speaking to Plaintiff;\n\n               f.      Microsoft reported to Plaintiff that it had found no basis for his complaint;\n\n               g.      Microsoft promoted Ms. Aulds, even after discove1ing that she had lied\n\n               during the investigation of Plaintiff's complaint;\n\n               h.       In announcing the promotion of Ms. Aulds, Manager Eddie O'Brien\n\n               emphasized her gender;\n\n               1.      Microsoft managers, including without limitation, Ms. Aulds, David\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n                                                                                                         505\n\fTannenbaum, and Eddie O'Btien, communicated with Plaintiff's customer accounts\n\nwithout Plaintiff's knowledge and participation to discuss their accounts which\n\nmarginalized Plaintiff's position with his accounts;\n\nJ.      Microsoft managers, including without limitation, Ms. Aulds and David\n\nTannenbaum, communicated with Plaintiff's customer accounts without Plaintiff's\n\nknowledge and participation to try and obtain adverse infonnation about Plaintiff;\n\nk.     Microsoft managers, including without limitation, David Tannenbaum,\n\nmade job assignments that discriminated against Plaintiff and one other person of\n\napproximately the same age as Plaintiff;\n\nI.     In Plaintiff's annual review conducted by Microsoft in or about August\n\n2010, he received a vastly reduced pay raise even though his performance numbers\n\nwere better than the previous year. He also received a bonus and stock options that\n\nwere 70% lower than the previous year even though his petformance numbers\n\nplaced him among the top six sales representatives. Another sales representative of\n\napproximately the same age as Plaintiff also received reduced compensation during\n\nthe same annual review. An American sales representative who finished towards if\n\nnot at the bottom of the sales representatives in terms of performance numbers and\n\nwho is far younger and less experienced than Plaintiff received the same rating as\n\nPlaintiff.-\" achieved\"-even though he did not achieve his performance quota.\n\nPlaintiff believes that this younger, less experienced, and under achieving sales\n\nrepresentative received similar or more generous compensation as Plaintiff during\n\nthe August 2010 annual review. During Plaintiff's 2010 annual review, which was\n\nattended by two managers and a human resources representative, Microsoft raised\n\n\n\n\n                                  8\n                                                                                      506\n\funsubstantiated and unsupported claims of negative job performance as a pretext for\n\nPlaintiffs reduced compensation increases. To Plaintiffs knowledge, no other sales\n\nrepresentative was \"ganged up\" on in this manner;\n\nm.      Microsoft increased its scrutiny of Plaintiff's job petformance and work\n\nproduct to an extent that exceeded the scrutiny of similarly situated employees or of\n\nyounger, less experienced employees, and to such an extent that Plaintiff's customer\n\naccounts have told him that they fear they will suffer adverse consequences if they\n\nsupport Plaintiff;\n\nn.      Plaintiff was prohibited from attending a key conference with customers,\n\nwhich then resulted in Plaintiff being left out of subsequent meetings with his\n\ncustomer accounts. Instead of attending the conference, Plaintiff was required to\n\nattend a six hour internal training program;\n\no.      Microsoft manager Eddie O'Brien prohibited Plaintiff from attending a sales\n\nmeeting with one of Plaintiffs customer accounts even though other, younger\n\nAmerican employees are allowed to attend the sales meetings where senior\n\nexecutives at Microsoft meet with their customer accounts;\n\np.      Job anniversary milestones and project accomplishments of other employees\n\nare recognized by Microsoft, but Plaintiff does not receive such recognition for his\n\nanniversary milestones or project accomplishments;\n\nq.      Constructive criticism offered by Plaintiff concerning Microsoft services or\n\nproducts, which in the past was readily accepted by Microsoft managers, is now\n\ntreated as evidence of Plaintiff's alleged \"bad attitude\" concerning his job;\n\nr.      Plaintiff was forced to perform duties that were clearly too much for one\n\n\n\n\n                                   9\n                                                                                        507\n\f               person to perform ;\n\n               s.     Disparaging comments were made about Plaintiffs nation of origin. One\n\n               of the managers, Eddie O'Brien, is known throughout the company, for his\n\n               disparaging comments about ctifferent nationalities, including one time when\n\n               shortly after the recent tsunami in Japan, he said that \" I would have zero pity for\n\n               Japan. I would push them right under the bus and create another tsunami;\" and,\n\n               t.     At off-site gatherings of Microsoft employees Plaintiff was ostracized by\n\n               .Microsoft managers, whereas the same managers were clearly engaging socially\n\n               with other employees.\n\n       17.     Within approximately 18 days of Plaintiff filing his complaint with Microsoft\n\nHuman Resources, Plaintiff was notified by Microsoft, on or after May 12, 2010, that a Microsoft\n\nemployee had filed a complaint against him. Plaintiff subsequently learned, on or about June 17,\n\n2010, that Defendant Tracy Rummel had filed a sexual harassment complaint and retaliation\n\ncomplaint against him with Microsoft Human Resources, alleging that Plaintiff had been sexuaJ\n\nharassing her for approximately from on or about November 8, 2008 through November 9, 2009.\n\n       18      Despite Ms. Rummel's claim of sexual harassment by Plaintiff occurring prior to\n\nher being employed by Microsoft, she sought to join the very sales team at Microsoft which\n\nincluded Plaintiff\n\n       19. After this lawsuit was filed and through discovery, Plaintiff learned that Ms. Rummel\n\nfiled her complaint against him with Microsoft on or about May 7, 2010. Through ctiscovery\n\nPlaintiff has learned that Ms. Rummel never contacted anyone at Microsoft Human Resources from\n\nNovember 2009 until she was persuaded to file her complaint against Mr. Mercieca on or about\n\nMay 7, 2010 by Ms. Aulds. And in retaliation for Mr. Mercieca' s complaint against Ms. Aulds.\n\n\n\n\n                                                10\n                                                                                                      508\n\f        20. Microsoft investigated the Ms. Rummel's complaint and found it to be baseless and\n\n\"unsupported'', yet Ms. Rummel received no adverse consequences for engaging in such activity.\n\nThe only reason Ms. Aulds received any disciplinary conduct was because after she got caught in\n\nher lies, she ultimately admitted to the lies, and of course, Microsoft was forced to admonish her.\n\n        21 .    After the onset of the above-described mistreatment and disc1iminato1y treatment,\n\nsome of Plaintiff's colleagues at Microsoft have noticed changes in Plaintiff's behavior at work,\n\ncommenting to Plaintiff that he appeared withdrawn during conference calls and did not ask\n\nquestions and discuss issues in the same manner and with the same enthusiasm as in the past.\n\n        22.     One coIIeague whom Plaintiff highly respects has told Plaintiff that it is obvious or\n\nclear to him that Microsoft managers are treating Plaintiff differently and negatively, and are\n\nattempting to undermine anything that plaintiff says or does.\n\n        23 .    The environment at work has become so intolerable and stressful that Plaintiff could\n\nno longer work in Microsoft's Austin office unless it was absolutely necessary to get the job done,\n\npreferring to work instead from his home office or at customer' s offices. The environment at work\n\ncontinued to be so intolerable and stressful that Plaintiff's employment with Microsoft was\n\nconstructively terminated on or about February 22, 2012 and as a result of Plaintiff being ordered to\n\nbe unjustly placed at a level 5.\n\n                  V.      RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR AND RATIFICATION\n\n        24.     Whenever in this complaint it is alleged that the Defendant Microsoft did any act\n\nor thing, or failed to do any act or thing, it is meant that the Defendant's officers, agents,\n\nservants, employees or representatives did such act with full authorization or ratification of the\n\nDefendant, or was done in the normal and routine course and scope of employment of\n\nDefendant's officers, agents, servants, employees, or representatives including Tracy Rummel ,\n\n\n\n\n                                                  11\n                                                                                                        509\n\fMarketing Manager, Marc Pisan, Marketing Director U.S. OEM, Lori Aulds, Regional Sales\n\nDirector U.S. OEM, David Tannebaum National Sales Director U.S. OEM, and Eddie O'Brien, a\n\nVice President U.S. OEM. Whenever it is alleged in this petition that a Microsoft employee did\n\nany act or thing or failed to do any act or thing, it is meant that such employee acted or fai led to\n\nact with full authorization or ratification of Defendant, or was done in the normal and routine\n\ncourse and scope of employment by Defendant, or was done in a capacity or manner that makes\n\nMicrosoft vicariously liable for such conduct.\n\n                       VI.     SLANDER & CONSPIRACY TO SLANDER\n\n        25.     Plaintiff adopts and incorporates by reference into this section of his petition the\n\nstatements set forth above in the Facts section as if set forth in this section.\n\n        26.     During the deposition of Tracy Rummels in this case, Plaintiff learned that\n\nDefendant Rummels had published false statements to Micky Shields in the Human Resources\n\nDepartment at Microsoft in November 2009 in that she accused Plaintiff of sexually harassing her\n\nand of retaliati ng against her while she was a C.S. (i.e., non-employee) of Microsoft. Rummels' s\n\nallegations were not investigated by Microsoft at the time. Upon information and belief, Aulds\n\nrepeated these false allegations of sexual harassment David Tannebaum and Eddie O\"Brien.\n\n        27.     On or about May 7 or 10, 2010, false statements were published and/or republished\n\nby Defendant Rummel in that she accused Plaintiff of sexually harassing her and of retaliating\n\nagainst her while she was a vendor for Microsoft.\n\n        28.     Plaintiff asserts the discovery rule.\n\n        29.     After Rummel published or republished the false statements in May 2010, her\n\nallegations were for the first time investigated by employees of Microsoft and determined to be\"\n\nunsupported.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                    12\n                                                                                                        510\n\f        30.    As a result of the false allegations, Plaintiff has been subjected to undue st1ict\n\nscrutiny of his job performance, hostile work environment, continued harassment by Microsoft,\n\nretaliation, demotion and constmctive discharge.\n\n        31.    Defendant Microsoft, by and through its officers, agents, servants, employees, or\n\nrepresentatives, including, but not limited to, manager, Lori Aulds, acting within the course and\n\nscope of her employment or under conditions that make Microsoft vicariousl y liable for her\n\nconduct, conspired with Defendant Rummel , to slander Plaintiff by making false statements of\n\nfact referring to Plaintiff, i.ncluding without limitation, false allegations of sexual harassment an.d\n\nretaliation.\n\n      32.      The false statements constitute defamation per se because they accuse Plaintiff of\n\nengaging in illegal activity and/or sexual misconduct and/or they directly bear on his fitness as a\n\nsales agent and businessman and/or they constitute injury to his personal and business reputation\n\nand to his occupation and/or impeach his honesty, integiity or virtue. Furthermore, these statements\n\nare defamatory because they tend to injure Plaintiff's reputation and occupation in the sales and\n\nbusiness community and expose him to public hatred, contempt, ridicule, and financial inj ury, and\n\nimpeach his honesty and integrity.\n\n        33 .   The defamatory statements are false, slanderous, and libelous. At all times relevant\n\nhereto, Plaintiff was an employee of Microsoft for 17 years and engaged in outside sales.\n\nDefendants made, or conspired with each other to make, the defamatory statements with the\n\nknowledge that they were false or with substantial grounds for knowing that they might be false and\n\nwith recldess disregard to whether they were true or false. AJtematively, the defamatory statements\n\nwere negligently published by Defendants. Upon information and belief, Defendant Rummel\n\npublished her sexual harassment complaint against Plaintiff at the insistence of Microsoft and in\n\n\n\n\n                                                   13\n                                                                                                          511\n\fretaliation for Plaintiff filing a complaint against Microsoft.\n\n        34.     As a direct and proximate result of Defendants' publication of, and/or conspiracy to\n\npublish, the defamatory statements, Plaintiff's business sales reputation has been severely injured.\n\nThe false allegations contained in the defamatory statements have caused Plaintiff to suffer severe\n\nmental anguish, public humiliation and embarrassment as a result of Defendants' intentional and/or\n\nnegligent acts since the truth was known to Defendants. As a direct and proximate result of\n\nDefendants' acts, Plaintiff has suffered pecuniary losses, including without limitation, loss of\n\nincome as a result of his constructive discharge, loss of future income, and loss of employee\n\nbenefits. Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages for these injuiies in an amount that exceeds the\n\nminimum jurisdictional limits of this Court.\n\n        35.     Plaintiff is entitled to exemplary damages from Defendants because they acted with\n\na specific intent to cause injury to Plaintiff or with conscious indifference to the rights, safety, or\n\nwelfare of Plaintiff and with actual, subjective awareness that their conduct involved an extreme\n\ndegree of risk of harm to Plaintiff Plaintiff seeks exemplary damages in an amount not to exceed\n\nthree times the amount of his actual damages as determined by the fact finder.\n\n        36.     The publication and republication of the false statements by Defendants was not\n\nptivileged.\n\n        37.     Defendants were not acting m good faith m publishing and republishing the\n\nstatements.\n\n        38.     Plaintiff did not consent to the publishing or republisfong of the false statements\n\nabout him. Plaintiff sought a fair investigation of his formal complaint yet Microsoft engaged in a\n\nbad faith investigation of his complaints in an effort to hide the truth.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   14\n                                                                                                          512\n\f                 VII.    EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES\n\n        39.     Plaintiff adopts and incorporates by reference into this section of his petition the\n\nstatements set forth above in the Facts section as if set forth in this section.\n\n        40.     Plaintiff timely filed a charge of discrimination against Defendant Microsoft with\n\nthe Austin Human Rights Division, a division of the Civil Rights Division of the Texas\n\nWorkforce Commission (\" TWC\"), and made a dual filing with the EEOC. Plaintiff exhausted\n\nhis administrative remedies, received a right to sue letter from the appropriate State agency, and\n\nthis suit has been timely filed under the Texas Labor Code. All conditions precedent to filing\n\nthis claim have been performed by Plaintiff or have occurred.\n\n                      VIIl. DISCRIMINATION IN VIOLATION OF\n                   THE TEXAS COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS ACT\n\n        41.     Plaintiff adopts and incorporates by reference into this section of his petition the\n\nstatements set forth above in the Facts section as if set forth in this section.\n\n        42.     During the course of his employment, Defendant Microsoft discriminated against\n\nPlaintiff because of age and/or sex and/or national origin.\n\n        43.     Specifically, and without limitation, Defendant subjected Plaintiff to undue\n\nscrutiny, denied him promotions, denied him bonuses and other compensation, question his green\n\ncard status and right to work in the United States, subjected him to isolation and ostracized him,\n\nundermined him vis-a-vis other employees and his customers, and subjected him to a hostile\n\nwork environment, retaliation, and/or constructive discharge, based upon his age, sex and/or\n\nnational origin, or a combination of each.\n\n        44.     Through such actions, Defendant Microsoft intentionally discriminated against\n\nPlaintiff in connection with the compensation, terms, conditions, and privileges of employment,\n\nor limited, segregated or classified Plaintiff in a manner that would deprive or tend to deprive\n\n\n\n                                                    15\n                                                                                                       513\n\fhim of any employment opportunity or adversely affect his status as an employee, including\n\nwithout limitation, unjustly demoting him to a level 5 when his manager at the time had ranked\n\nhim at a level 3, resulting in a constructive discharge.\n\n       45.        Age and/or sex and/or national origin were motivating factors m Defendant\n\nMicrosoft's treatment of Plaintiff.\n\n       46.        Such conduct constitutes unlawful employment practices in violation of the Texas\n\nCommission on Human Rights Act, including without limitation, Texas Labor Code §21.051\n\nand/or 21 .056.\n\n       47.        Plaintiff was proximately damaged as a result of the conduct of Microsoft, its\n\nagents and employees, in an amount within the jurisdictional limits of this court. Plaintiff seeks\n\nrecovery of such damages, including without limitation, the damages provided by Texas Labor\n\nCode Sec. 21.2585.\n\n                                  IX.    SEXUAL HARASSlVIENT\n\n       48.        Plaintiff adopts and incorporates by reference into this section of his petition the\n\nstatements set forth above in the Facts section as if set forth in this section. Additionally, Defendant\n\nAulds, acting within the course and scope of her employment or in a manner that makes Microsoft\n\nvicariously liable for her conduct, made sexual comments to Plaintiff about her sex life (such as\n\n\"you have ruined me for sex with my boyfriends\"), commented on her sexual relationships with her\n\nboyfriends, and insisted that Plaintiff get involved in her and her boyfriend' s relationship and\n\ndisputes, even though on several occasions Plaintiff told Aulds that it made him uncomfortable\n\nbeing told and involved in these things, and handled her relationship with Plaintiff more like a\n\n\"boyf1iend/girlfriend\" relationship rather than an employer/employee relationship.\n\n       49.        The above-described conduct of Defendant Microsoft's manager employee, Lori\n\n\n\n\n                                                   16\n                                                                                                           514\n\fAulds, was sufficiently severe and pervasive so as to alter the conditions of Plaintiffs\n\nemployment and create an abusive work environment. The accumulated effect of her repeated\n\nverbal attacks and caustic comments to and about Plaintiff (which became known to Plaintiff)\n\nundermined Plaintiffs ability to succeed at his job, and caused harm to his emotional stability\n\nand health. Such gender-based animus exhibited by Ms. Aulds to Plaintiff constitutes sexual\n\nharassment of Plaintiff in violation of his rights under the law. Defendant Microsoft knew or\n\nshould have known of the harassment and abusive work environment, yet failed to take prompt\n\nremedial action.\n\n        50.     Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Microsoft, by and through its manager employee,\n\nsexually harassed Plaintiff and created an abusive work environment for Plaintiff with malice or\n\nwith reckless indifference to the legally protected rights of Plaintiff.\n\n        51.     Such harassment proximately caused damages to Plaintiff in an amount within the\n\njurisdictional limits of this court.\n\n                                       X.       RETALIATION\n\n        52.     Plaintiff adopts and incorporates by reference into this section of his petition the\n\nstatements set forth above in the Facts section as if set forth in this section.\n\n        53.     Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Microsoft, by and through its officers, agents,\n\nservants, employees or representatives, including without limitation, Tracy Rummel, Marketing\n\nManager, Marc Pisan, Marketing Director U.S. OEM, Lori Aulds, Regional Sales Director U.S.\n\nOEM, David Tannebaum National Sales Director U.S. OEM, and Eddie O'Brien, a Vice\n\nPresident U.S. OEM instituted a campaign of retaliation against Plaintiff due to Plaintiff filing\n\nhis formal complaint against Lori Aulds, Regional Sales Director U.S. OEM, David Tannebaum\n\nNational Sales Director U.S. OEM, and Eddie O'Brien, a Vice President U.S. OEM and\n\n\n\n\n                                                    17\n                                                                                                       515\n\fexercising his rights by filing a charge of discrimination with the Austin Commission on Human\n\nRights, a branch of the Texas Commission of Human Rights, and EEOC. This retaliation\n\nincluded the filing of a bogus sexual harassment and retaliation complaint by Defendant Rummel\n\nwhile employed by Microsoft, and Microsoft causing or encouraging Tracy Rummel to file a\n\nfalse and misleading charge of sexual harassment and retaliation against Plaintiff\n\n        54.     Such conduct violates Texas Labor Code Sec. 21.055 and/or 21 .056.\n\n        55.     Such conduct proximately caused Plaintiff to suffer damages in an amount within\n\nthe jurisdictional limits of this court.\n\n                                 XI.       INVASION OF PRIVACY\n\n        56.     Plaintiff adopts and incorporates by reference into this section of his petition the\n\nstatements set forth above in the Facts section as if set forth in this section.\n\n        57.     Defendant Microsoft, by and through its officers, agents, servants, employees or\n\nrepresentatives, intentionally invaded Plaintiffs privacy by intruding on his solitude, seclusion,\n\nor private affairs. The invasion was highly offensive to Plaintiff and would be highly offensive\n\nto a reasonable person. Plaintiff was injured because of the conduct of Defendant. Plaintiff\n\nproximately suffered damages in an amount within the jurisdictional limits of this court for\n\nwhich Plaintiff herein sues.\n\n        58.     Defendant Microsoft, by and through its officers, agents, servants, employees or\n\nrepresentatives, verbally publicized facts regarding Plaintiff's private life which were not of\n\nlegitimate public concern. The publicity was highly offensive to Plaintiff and would be highly\n\noffensive to a reasonable person. Plaintiff was injured as a result of the conduct of Defendant.\n\nPlaintiff proximately suffered damages as a proximate cause and result of Defendants' actions in\n\nan amount within the jurisdictional limits of this court for which Plaintiff herein sues.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    18\n                                                                                                       516\n\f                                      Xll.    DAMAGES\n\n       59.    Plaintiff sustained the following damages or elements of damage in an amount\n\nwithin the jurisdictional limits of this court for which he seeks compensation as a result of the\n\nactions and/or omissions of Defendants described above:\n\n       a.     Back pay from the date that Plaintiff was denied equal pay for equal work, and\n              interest on the back pay, in an amount of compensation to Plaintiff as the Court\n              deems equitable and just, and/or loss of earnings in the past;\n              AND, lost income resulting from Plaintiffs constructive discharge;\n       b.     Front pay in an amount the court deems equitable and just to make Plaintiff\n              whole, and/or loss of earning capacity which will, in all reasonable probability, be\n              incutTed in the future;\n       c.     Loss of benefits, including bonuses, stock options, 401 k matching contributions\n              and any other pension plan contributions, and any profit-sharing plan\n              contributions;\n       d.     Loss of enjoyment oflife;\n       e.     Mental anguish in the past;\n       f.     Mental anguish which will , in all reasonable probability, be suffered in the future;\n       g.     Reasonable medical care and expenses in the past. These expenses were incurred\n              by Plaintiff and such charges are reasonable and were usual and customary\n              charges for such services in Travis County, Texas;\n       h.     Reasonable medical care and expenses which Plaintiff will incur, in all reasonable\n              medical probability, in the future;\n       1.     Deprivation of seclusion;\n       J.     Humiliation;\n       k.     Loss of time and Inconvenience;\n       I.     Physical discomforts; and,\n       m.     Injury to reputation.\n\n                              xm.    EXEMPLARY DAMAGES\n\n       60.    Plaintiff would further show that the acts and/or omissions of Rummel and of\n\nDefendant Microsoft, by and through its officers, agents, servants, employees or representatives,\n\nincluding Manager Lori Aulds and co-worker Tracy Rummel , which are complained of herein\n\nwere committed with malice or reckless indifference to the protected rights of the Plaintiff. In\n\norder to punish Defendants, and to deter such actions and/or omissions in the future by\n\nDefendants or anyone else, Plaintiff also seeks a recovery of exemplary damages from\n\n\n\n\n                                               19\n                                                                                                      517\n\fDefendants.\n\n                                     XIV. ATTORNEY'S FEES\n\n        62.

I escalated this to our CRM team and th is continues to be 1\ninvestigated. That said, with Joe Sahaglan's support, I re-entered data in CRM for the third time this past\nyear. I have already stated that some of my partners elected not to respond because they felt they could\nnot be truthful In the assessment of the relationship with Microsoft - some feel a sense of fear of\nreceiving punitive responses for any perceived negative feedbacic to Microsoft. Nothing I can do about\nthat except try to assure them the feectback rs vah.ied and we will change things 1f necessary. Not\nresponding doesn't help anyone. C have plenty of examples of executive engagement however, what is\ntroub llng to me 1s t hat I have Ileen cut-out of these executive engagements w ith Robert Young.}Ohns;\nKe.vin Turner etc ·this has been a source of frustrat ion but I am confident this will change now r have a\nnew manager 1n Joe Sahagian. This included the rnost recent event with the Microsoft Houston Store\nOpening - the EPG reps were Invited and I was not and Lori Aulds drove the invitation to my Top Partner\nand CEO David Altounian from Motion Computing.\n\nSince Joe came on board - I have received much more support and useful coaching and direction on key\nstrategic Issues. I have also received more inclusion with direct support from Joe and Peter Han our new\nGM. Joe and Peter have met all my partners collectively 3-4 times this year and based on the meetings I\nhave coordinated, have created great relationships with the Texas partner ecosystem.\n\nUnlike Lor• Aulds who even in her n~ role has continued to marglna'llze and confuse my partners and\nmany t imes intemal Microsoft people with her actions - Joe and Peter have been very transparent and\nsupportive in cementing my postt1on with my partners as the lead.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                       MS14285\n\fMy COS statements have been first rate with regular follow-up w1ttl my accounts and proactive CRM\nupdates - I exceeded CR~1 updating beyond what was required by the subsidiary, including post\nscorecard timeline, w ith a view to ensuring continuity and preparedness for FY 12.\n\nMy CRM quality was one of the highest on my direct tean1 and Natlonl!llly with the following statistics :\n\n     • Exceeded US Team Average Score\n     • Exceeded Direct team Average Score - only Wayne Carey and myself achieved this with the rest\n       being below team average\n     • Ranked 2nd on direct team on overall quality score\n     • Ranked 2nd on team for full completion of CRM\n\nThe level of Executive enga9ement Is extremely high with one of if not the best attendance records at\nWWPC this year.\n\n     • 100% Partner organization participation at WWPC - this is at least the 4th year I have achieved\n       thiS\n     • At time of w11.tlng this my partners contributed to:\n           • 21 %+ of the total OEM o rganrzations represented\n           • over 13% of the total people represented\n           • Motion Computing received nomination for a WW Partner Award\n           • Motion Computing received a US nomlnatio n and Award fur US l'i\"obility Partner of the Year •\n             last year they were ranked as US OEM Partner of the Year\n\nThe overall team attendanc~ numbers for WWPC overall were struggling and a change was made that\nMi crosoft would subsidize the reg tstrat.ion costs - my results were achieved prior to this decision and\nwere based on a) my positioning of the value of WWPC and b) the long term personal and professional\nrelation ships I have developed over many years. having my complete set of partners represented is a\nconsistent performance result in my territory over many consecutive years showmg consistent and\nproven capability over a number of years.\n\nThe CPE comments I received from the responders t know were excellent ~ once again this is consistent\nand shows another element of my long term proven capabilities in this category.\n\n\nOptional Manager comment on Emptovee Results against this Commitment\nMichael d id not achieve this commitment, as he did not meet the accountability of 50% poll par ticipation\nin FY1 l. His partner partici pation was at 36%, the lowest on the team, this demonstrates a lack of effort.\nThe poll participation goal for FY12 is going to oe significantly higher and he will need to put more time\nand effort into driving higher poll participation numbers. As a team we achieved our NSAT goal of 151\nwhich 1s the highest it's been in many years. Michael's Condition of Satisfaction statements needed\nimprovernent in Hl, but he showed noted improvements in H2 on his wri tten conditions of satisfaction\nstatements in CRM.

In doing so, Michael was one of only a few people who\nmiSsed two product groups in FYl 1. Client revenue was at 110'% of target, 0 ffice Revenue was at 72 %\nof target and Server Revenue was at 76% ofta19et. Each individual component of his Revenue\ncommitrttent is as important as the overall attainment number. Michael has met or exceeded all four\nquarterly accountabilities in FYll and as noted has done this lbr eight straight quarters. The expectation\nof the entire team is to hit their overall btJ.dget, meet all revenue targets with regards to product groups\nand to meet quarter1y accountabilities.

He has also been involved with helping to shape tt1e\nStorytelling course from Mandel Communication. Michael kept his T&E Expenses In line with budget.\nMichael successfully met all the accountabilities of this commitment.\n\n\n\nOverall Performance\n\nEmployee Overall Performance Summary; Summarize your results against commitments and\nhow you demonstrated your ability to collaborate across boundaries, impact and influence\nothers, and e.xhibit I nterpersonal awareness and confidenc,e. In addition to these core\ncompet-encies, include how you demonstrated ~nv other profession-related competencies\nthat were key to your deliverables.\n HID YEAR SUMMARY;\n The past semester has been good from a re\\lenue perspective - consistent over budget performance -\n 6 consecutive quarters with a goal for 7 and 8 thiS fiscal year. My relationships across mv partners 1s\n excellent - with mutual respect and appreciation on a very deep level. This performance has been\n achieved despite the negativity and marg'ioalization by my management team - Joe Sahagian is an\n exception to this. I have had a 12-15 month issue with my organtzatlon that has included an Internal\n Investigation and now an external escalation and formal romplain t to the Texas Commission for\n Human Rights and the EEOC - Microsoft has been made aware of this at the highest levels. This has\n been a source of great pressure and distraction for me yet t continue to perform and bring in my\n revenues; nurture strong relationships and put my partners; customers; and Microsoft overall first.\n\n l want to confirm that my current manager, Joe Sahagian, is not a part of this negativity and given\n the circumstances I believe he has been a breath of fresh air and integrity in this leadership team\n which has shown itself to tack core values espoused by Microsoft In our Standards of Business\n Conduct. Even in his short tenure he has shown me tremendous support in          mv\n                                                                                  account activities and\n he reminds me of the time when Microsoft encoura9ed us to think big and believe io our core values\n and operate as a true trusting team.\n\n Mtcrosoft would do welt to increase Joe's responsib.lliUes and span of control and sphere of\n influence. He has a great gift of strong Emotional and IntElligence Quotients. He reminds me of Barry\n Ridgway and Phil Sorgen 10 terms of his management style and understands the business.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                           MS1.4292\n\fHe epitomizes walking the walk and not just using rhetori: as a punch-line but as a standard and\ncode to execute.\n\nThis is my MYCO but these are important factors tnat I feel passionately about and have a direct\nimpact on both mine and the teams OHI and ability to execute on our overall commitments. I still\nbelieve ttlat M1crosott, the company, stands for something grecst. What I am uncomfortable with is the\ngulf bet ween our code and values and execution of them.\n\nFULL '££AR SUMMARY\n\nAnother successful year with the following accomplishments:\n\n   • Excellent performance across the year for all my commitments ·always room for improvement\n     as I strive and aspire to perfection in all aspects of what l do\n   • My app ro acn has been positive and driven and despite the lack of sup port and roadblocks from\n     Mlerosoft management,(excludm9 Joe Saha90o),and the constant undenninlog and\n     marginallzatlon of my partner reiationsnips, my terrttorv operates extremely effectively and the\n     partner reiationshlps and CPE are superb although even my partners sense things are not eight.\n   • I hold myself to the h1gh~st standards and whilst I am the first to say I can always improve as\n     that is in rny nature, l also know that I have performed consistently and hi9tlly with integrity\n     and passion and fully supporting Microsoft's initiatives and being supportive of my management\n     team in Joe.\n   • J operate as a positive team ~ayer making myself avail<1ble to anyone in any team in any\n     d iv1s10n in any country l have a plethora of examples of th is m my career and in the past year\n     Including self funding a trip to support a Microsolt partner in need.\n\nAher Mid year I was placed on a weekly perfurmance review with my manager, which is an indicatiOn\nthat I am being given unwarranted extra scrutiny which r see as continued harassment and\nunwarranted focus based on my past and current formal complaints and following legal actions. rn\nshort this retaliatory by Microsoft and not only contrary to internal policy but 1s Illegal.\n\nThis request for additional reviews was based on my first semester performance as it was MYCD so I\nam confident that Joe Sahagian was not part of th is process and that it was mandated by\nmanagement and/or HR. T ht! request was based on 3 elements which r had already raised as areas of\nfocus proactively to Improve upon, (that does not mean they were bad or bad relative to the team),\nthey were just areas to increase performance as one can always look lO improve ones performance.\n\n1'hese wEre then used against me whicti I find perplexing and deeply upsetting- these areas were\nProduct Group performa nee; l m bedded Scorecard and CRM.\n\nAt Mid-year I have found on further scrutiny that more than one person did not m€et criteria in these\nareas as well as mysetf. One Individuals performance included:\n\n   • ~aving lower Embedded Scorecard performance than myself\n   • My CRM score exceeded team commitment level · th1~ individuals was no better at that point\n   • This person had only made 1/3 Product 9roups like myself the one he made was not client\n     (the bi99est number and mine was); also my IW number was incorrect -see above\n   • fhe individual posted tile LOWEST revenue number by MYCO an<J was b~low 71% of bud~t\n   • Hits was a a>ntinuat1on of poor revenue performance ashed kl not make budget (1 of only 2\n     reps) in a launch year fiscal f\"Y 10 when everyone else made and exceeded quota.\n\nI have to thf!n hypotheslTe that a) this individual was receiving special concessions and/orb) I was\nreceiving unnecessary and unwarranted negative focus as a rct~liatory measure to \"build\" a case\nagainst me. In short, why was I placed on weekly performance reviews and this individual was not\ndespite his poorer performance record and trending and over budget expense spendin9?\n\nDespite the negativity; hara~sment; the uncomfortable and untenable environment that forced me to\nelect to worl< from home and the ever increasing negative pre~sure and additional workload review\n\n\n                                                                                                       MS14293\n\frequirements placed oo myself, I have still chosen to rise above this ant:: put Microsoft; Partners;\nCustomers and my colleagues first and continue to drive attainment in llne and often in excess of\ncommitment levels.\n\nWhilst not perfect, ( I will and always will continue to strive fbr that level), I will not allow the\ndetractors to sway my performance to a negative route - I am paid by Microsoft to manage a\nbusiness and all the previously mentioned teams and individuals rely on that perfonnaoce.\n\nDespite unilaterally not being given any leadership projects th is year by the management team, l\ncontinue to operate as a leader and in line with our Standards of Business Conduct highlighting to my\nmanager and GM when others (Directors' and above) have not. I take my role extremely seriously\nand see myself as an ambassador of Microsoft in everyt,in9 I do 24/7.\n\nI have almost completed 18 years at Microsoft and I continue to execute my responsibilities\ndiligently; consistently and with comp;,ssion and integrity and with a high degree of business acumen.\nMy consistency and proven capabilities over each role In almost two decades and in this role, despite\nthe toxic environment that I find myself in, - have been nothing short of assiduous and I am\nconfident that should Microsoft in thiS review and beyond tlnd otherwise, that the investigations and\ninformation that will continue to ring information to light mme to light will fully support my excellent\nrecord of proven performance and cap.abilities.\n\nTo my manager Joe Sahagian I will formally go on record in thanking him for managing this delieate\nsituation with integrity and poise and a hi9h degree of professionalism wtlieh from my experience of\nhim over the years is of no surprise.\n\n\n\n\nManager's Overatl Performance Assessment: Summarize both the employee's results\nagainst commitments, and how weU this employee demonstrated an ability to collaborate\nacross boundaries, impact and influence others, and exhibit interpersonal awareness and\nconfidence. tn addition to these core competencies, indude any other profession-related\ncompetenc:ies that were key to hrs or her deliverable5. When asseHing overall performance\ncon5ider the. environmenl in which results were achieved and the impact of perlormanca\nrelative to peers. •summari~e the employee's proven cctpability based on a longer-term\ndemonstrated history of taking on more chatlenging work while continuing to deliver resu9ls\n(*proven capability is not applicable for an employee's first review at MS).\nMichael, you did a good job meeting each of your all up revenue quarterly accountabilities, as an\naccount manager, this is very important. Another area that you showed solid performance was\naround driving WWPC attendance and across being an alpha tester on our FRI murses. Some\ncommitment areas where you need to stay focused on in FY12 are meeting all of your Product\nGroups, driving better poll participation and keeping your plans In CRM up to date with quahty short\nand long term goals and objectives. You atso have done a good job of staying in front of the trends\nwithin your business especially as it relates to Motion Computing and Xplore Technologies tablet\nopportunities and chal1enges.\nDespite some of the above areas of success, there are number of areas where you dia oot achieve\nyour commitments and I expect to see consistent and sustained improv~ment. An area for\ndevelopment and opportunity around Microsoft competencies is product and technok:>gy expertise.\nManaging our largest tablet partner provlde:s the opportunity for yo1J to bring real time Intelligence\nback to the broader team around compete and competitive trends within the market place. Another\narea of development is cross group collaboration. Over the past year you have not been able to\ngenerate support from others. Feed back - both verbal and from the feedback tool -- indicates that\nothers are having trouble partnering with you. You have engaged with others in a way that makes\nthen not want to partner with you. How you perform your job is just as critical as your end\nresults. Your inability to partner with your team is not good for our internal team dynamics, external\nteam dynamics and customers.\nFlnafly, I note that your overall self·assessmmt contalr.s spec..i atlon and hypothesis about other\nemployees. Again, this is not appropriate content for your annual review. You also suggest that the\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                           MS14294\n\fperformance coaching we- have worked on over the last year iS rE'taliatory 10 some way. I can assure\nyou tl'\\at 1 talce the development of employees very seriously, alld that r initiated this action as a way\nto help yo1.. improve both the \"what\" and \"howH of your performance.

HR inslrUcted Tracy to raise her concerns with her\n                 employer. HR followed up with the CS employer and the CS employer informed HR that Tracy\n                 did not wish to raise concerns or proceed with an investigation. 1\n\n                 On February 23, 2010, Michael contacted his HRBP, Micky Shields, and stated that he wished to\n                 raise a \"fonnal complaint\" regarding actions in November 2009 related to Tracy Rummel. His\n                 contact with Micky followed a 1: l with the subject, Lori Aulds, in which Lori revealed to\n                 Michael that Tracy had raised concerns about him in November 2009. A number of calls/emails\n                 between Micky and Michael followed that initial contact.\n                 On March 26, 2010, Michael was intcrViewed by ER.IT at Micky's request in order to better\n                 wtderstand his concerns. Michael's coi:icems in th.at interview focused on the fact that\n                 allegations were raised against him by Tracy to his manager's attention and that his management\n                 chain was aware of the allegation. Michael did not raise any concerns regarding discrimination\n                 because of gender and/or national origin and Michael did not raise any concerns regarding sexual\n\n\n                 1\n                   The CS employee, Tracy Rummel. was hired 3S a Microsoft FTE on February lS, 2010.

Michael also alleged\n\n\n\n\n•\n    that when Lori applied for the open manager position on his team in 2007 she requested he not\n    mention their past relationship to the hiring manager, Megan Both. He stated that there was \"no\n    upside for me in mentioning it [past relationship}\" to Megan so \"I kept my mouth shut and did\n    my job.\" He stated that '·Megan called me and I said she was a good hire.\" In support of the\n    past romantic relationship, Michael provided voicemails, photographs and additional evidence\n    from 2002.\n    Lori initially denied that she and Michael had ever been romantically involved in the past. She\n    stated that they were friends a:id would go out together and travel together but th.at there was no\n    sexual relationship. During a subsequent interview in Austin, Texas I showed the evidence\n    provided by Michael and Lori then admitted to the past romantic relationship. She stated that\n    she spoke to Michael when applying for the job in 2007 and that he was supportive and had no\n    concerns. She said that Michael told her not to reveal the past romantic relationship to Megan\n    and that. since becoming his manager) \"I have been very careful to maintain a professional\n    distanct: so there would be no misunderstanding.\"\n\n    Witness/Both and documentary evidence corroborated that Michael was supportive ofTracy~s\n    hiring as his manager in 2007. Witness/Both stated that Michael called her and said th.at Lori\n    was a \"great person and a great hire.\" Following his call with Witness/Both, Michael sent an\n    email to Lori on July 2, 2007 detailing the call and including statements by him: \"I WOULD\n    HrRE YOU\" and \"I would be bappy to work for you.\"\n\n    The investigation revealed docwnentary evidence that corroborated Michael's allegation of a\n    past romantic relationship between him and Lori prior to her becoming his manager in 2007.\n    When confronted with documentary evidence, Lori admitted the past romantic relationship. The\n\n\n\n\n•                                                                                                         MS37857\n\finvestigation also revealed documentary evidence and witness evidence that Michael was\nsupportive of Lori's hiring and that neither Lori nor Michael revealed the past romantic\nrelationship to the hiring manager in 2007.\n                                                                                                                           •\nAlleged Unwelcome Gpnduct\n\nOn August 11, 20 I0, Michael alleged that he had been sexually harassed by Lori since she\nbecame his manager in 2007. Michael spedfically denied any sexual advances by Lori or any\npressure by Lori to return to their past romantic relationship while she has been his manager. He\nidentified her harassment as unwelcome verbal conduct, including: Lori alluding to their past\nromantic relationship in I: ls~ Lori making a statement regarding their past sexual relationship to\nMichael at his cubicle; Lori asking Michael to \"mediate\" her relationship with another man; Lori\nasking Michael to go out dancing; and Lori threatening his job if he revealed their past romantic\nrelationship. When questioned, Michael did confirm that he never raised any of these concerns\nto HR until speaking with ERlT on August 11, 2010 and that he had provided positive feedback\nregarding her management of him and the team.\n\nLori responded to the allegation of sexual harassment by denying that she acted inappropriately\ntowards Michael. She specifically denied alluding to their past romantic relationships in 1:ls,\nmaking a statement regarding their past sexual relationship, or threatening Michael's job if he\nrevealed their past relationship. She denied asking Michael to go out dancing after she became\nhis manager as she wished to keep their relationship strictly professional. Lori confirmed that\nMichael did intervene in a 2008 domestic issue between her and her ex-boyfriend, Chris Kelly.\nShe stated that she did not want th.at to happen but that she shared information with Michael\nregarding problems in her relationship and that Michael \"wanted to be protector\" and voluntarily\ncontacted Chris and met with him al her home. Lori stated th.at \"l never shared anything with\nMichael'' after that occurrence. Lori provided documentary evidence, including emails and h.is\nWHI scores for her in FY09 (sent directly to her by Michael), where Michael praised her work as\nhis manager. ·\n                                                                                                                               •\nWitness/Thompson has worked closely with Lori and Michael in the Austin office since Lori\nbecame Michael's manager. He noted a professional and congenial working relationship\nbetween Michael and Lori through begiruring of FY 10 that included the three of them often\ngoing to lunch together. He observed no discomfort by either Lori or Michael and noted ''they\nhave knoY.n each other for a long time.>'\nWitnesses and documentary evidence did not corToborate Michael's assertion that Lori alluded to\ntheir past romantic relationship in 1: 1s, made a statement regarding their past sex.ual relationship\nat his cubicle, asked him to go out dancing (as his manager), or threatened ttis job if he revealed\ntheir past romantic relationshlp. Documentary evjdence did corroborate that Michael voluntarily\ninvolved himself in Lori's domestic issues with her ex-boyfriend and that Lori permitted that to\noccur.\nThe investigation revealed there was a close personal (non-romantic) friendship between Lori\n                                                   4\nand Michael after she became his manager in 2007. The investigation did not find evidence\n\n4\n For example, in illl email dated October 2, 2008, Michael stated to Lori: \"I have dropped everything when you had\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                               •\nyour problems with Chris whatever times of the day or night and come over and called you to check on you-when\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                     MS37858\n\f•   supporting the unwelcome verbal conduct by Lori cited by Michael in support of his allegation\n    of sexual harassment. lbe comments related to the past romantic/sexual relationship were\n    denied by Lori and there were no witnesses/documentary evidence corrnborating them. Also,\n    Michael's involvement in Lori's domestic issue appeared voluntary on his pa.rt.\n\n    Analysis and Conclusion\n\n    Although Lori and Michael did have a past romantic relationship in 2002 and a close personal\n    (non-romantic) friendship that deteriorated in FYlO, I did not find support for Michael's\n    allegation that he was sexually harassed by Lori. There are a number of factors that led to this\n    conclusion: Michael supported Lori's hiring as his manager in 2007 and conununicated that\n    support to the hiring manager; Michael praised Lori's management in emails and in the FY09\n    WHI poll in contradiction of his subsequent allegation; Witnessffhompson observed a\n    professional and congenial working relationship between Lori and Michael since Lori became\n    Michael's manager and no discomfort on the part of Michael; and Michael did not raise this\n    allegation or inform HR of the past romantic relationship until after he was identified as a subject\n    in an ERIT investigation alleging sexual harassment and after issuc:s were raised by Lori about\n    his performance thereby raising significant question regarding his motive. Therefore> based on\n    tbe totality of the evidence, I do not find that Lori's treatment of Michael violated Microsoft's\n    Anti-Harassment and Anti-Discrimination Policy.\n\n    I do find that Lori exercised extremely poor judgment as a manager.

Regarding the specific examples above that Michael\n        identified, subjects, witnesses and documentary evidence indicated the following:\n        Lori confirmed that she and Michael did not have regular l :ls scheduled on their calendars. She\n        stated, and witnesses and documentation corroborated, that she and Michael had a close working\n        relationship in the Austin office and that the two of them would meet for l: 1s to discuss\n        Michael's business often on an ad hoc basis or at lunch.\n\n        Subjects stated, and witnesses and documentation corroborated, that Michael has not been\n        included on some communication with his partner, Motion Computing. Subjects explained, and\n        witnesses and docwnentation corroborated, that this was due to ( 1) the fact that Lori is leading\n        the US OEM's high·level Apple Compete Strategy that involves Motion. as well as other\n        Microsoft partners not assigned to Michael and (2) the fact that Michael was on vacation for\n        much of June/July 2010 when this Apple Compete Strategy \"heated up'' and required\n        conununication with Motion. Subjects also seated, and documentation and witnesses\n        corroborated, the meeting between Robert Youngjohns and the CEO of Motion was focused on\n\n\n\n•       the Apple Compete Strategy and that Robert prefers smaller meetings.\n        Lori and David stated, and documentation corroborated, that Michael initially communicated to\n        them that he would not be attending WPC because of low partner attendance. They stated> and\n        documentation corroborated, that Michael ultimately could not attend V.'PC because it conflicted\n        with the only available dates that he could attend in~person BPOS training (due to his vacation\n        schedule in July 2010.) Lori stated, and documentation corroborated, that she did not cut\n        Michael's T & E budget in FYlO.\n\n        Derogatory Comments\n\n        Michael alleged that at an offshe Eddie seated \"I'll get my friends in the IRA to blow up France.\"\n        He stated that lhe commented offended him because his mother's name is French. Eddie denied\n        the conunent and no -wimesses present at the offsite, including lhe HR.BP (Witness/Shields),\n        corroborated it.\n        Michael also alleged that Eddie sent an organization-wide email titled \"2 Females Promoted to\n        Director\". He stated lhat email offended rum because Eddie's organi1,ation does not designate\n        when men are promoted. Edcie confinned lhe email and noted that he received coachlng after\n        sending it that such email announcements should be more balanced. further, the organization\n        has announced other promotions of individuaJs by name via email. the email could be hurtful to\n        both men and women in his organization.\n        Analvsis and Conclusion\n\n\n\n\n•                                                                                                            MS37863\n\fThe investigation did not reveal sufficient evidence supporting MichaePs allegation of\ndiscrimination by the subjects because of his gender or national origin. First, Micha.el provided\nno corroborating witnesses or evidence that the treatment he received from subjects was related\nto either his gender or national origin. Second, there was a legitimate basis for the subjects'\n                                                                                                                          •\nmanagement of Michael in terms of career discussions, coaching and feedback on corroborated\ndeficiencies in performance. Third, many of the items identified by Michael as discrimination\nwere legitimate business/management decisions made by the subjects that he simply disagreed\nwith. Fourth, many of the examples of llllfair treaunent by the subjects cited by Michael were\ncontradicted by the interviews and documentary evidence. Finally, Michael had previously\nidentified Tracy RwnmePs allegations in November 2009 against him as the catalyst for his\ntreatment by the subjects and it was not W1til he was notified. of the ERIT investigation in May\n20 l 0 that he raised his allegations of discrimination.6\n\nBased on the foregoing, I find that the evidence does not support Michael's aJlegation that his\ngender or national origin was/is a factor in the subjects' treatment of him. Accordingly, I did not\nfind that the subjects' treatment ofMichael violated Microsoft's Anti-Harassment and Anti-\nDi.scrimination Policy.\n\n Allegation: Retaliation under Microsoft,s Anti-Harassment & Anti-Discrimination Policy\n-Unsupported\n\nMichael also alleged that Lori, David Tannenbaum, and Eddie O'Brien had retaliated against\nhim for raising a discrimination allegation against them and for participating in this ERIT\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                              •\ninvestigation. ln support of this allegation, Michael cited the following:\n\n    •    Feedback in FYlO Review\n    •    Rewards in FY10 Review\n\nFeedback in FY I 0 Review:\n\nMichael alleged that the subjects had retaliated against him by highlighting only\n\"critical/negative\" foedback in his review !hat wa.c; not substantiated and never raised in 1:ls or\nin MYCD.

Michael highlighted that a colleague\n          reporting to Lori, Michael Warren, was awarded equivalent or higher CBUSlock awards despite\n          having missed his quota.\n\n          Subjects denied that they retaliated against Michael in regards to his FYI 0 rewards. Regarding\n          CBI, subjects stated, and witnesses and documentation corroborated> that there were additional\n          factors weighed besides quota attainment that went into the assessment of PA Ms in David's\n          organization and Michael scored the lowest of all P AMs in David's organization. Subjects\n          stated, and documentation corroborated., that there were significant issues related to Michael\n          Warren•s business that resulted in adjustment of his quota attainment to 99% and Michael\n          Warren did better than Michael in other factors weighed by subjects when assessing P AMs in\n          David's organization. Regarding Stock award, subjects stated, and witnesses and documentation\n          corroborated, that Michact•s length of time in role, corroborated deficiencies, and documented\n          concerns around the UPC project were considered when assessing his contribution ranking at\n          bottom 70% on con!ributioo - thereby resulting in lower stock award.\n\n          Analysis and Conclusion\n\n          The investigation did not reveal sufficient evidence supporting Michael's allegation of retaliation\n          by subjects.

We are executing well,\n    capitalizing on the growth in the PC market and the launch of Win 7 thus\n    making outslanding traction on attach and revenue while making very strong\n    progress on CPE & OHi.\n\n\n\n    US OEM is driving hard to build on the Windows 7 momentum to drive share and\n    premium mix as part of our overall compete strategy against Apple, Google\n    and Linux. Some of owr key objectives are 1) to land Windows on all PCs\n    and new form factors; 2) capture the Corporate refresh opportunity; 3} Land\n    Professional on business PCs; 4) Land Windows 7 Starter on Netbooks; 5)\n    Ensure Office 2010 Starter image is on all PCs and 6) Lend Windows Live Wave\n    4 and Bing are on as many PCs as possible and 7) continue to grow Server\n    Attach.\n\n\n\n    Two roles that are critical to achieving these goals are 1) how we Operate\n    Sales and manage the Business overall to drive attach and 2) how we engage\n    with our Verticals and Named Accounts. In light of this I am very pleased to\n    announce the promotions of Lori Aulds to Director Named and Vertical and\n    Jeannine Borgen to Director Sales Operations and Business Management to\n    assist in driving these key efforts.\n\n\n\n\n•   Lori has played a critical role in enabling the team to drive 182% of budget\n    and 17% YoY growth in our Named Business as Group Manager for tile West\n    Region. Lori reads our engagement to WWOEM Named Team and is key\n    contributor to WN projects like LINC & LEAP. As Director for the Named &\n    Vertical she will deepen Iler focus in this critical part of the business to\n    drive longer term growth into the Named Business. Since joining the OEM team\n    in FY08, Lori has made a significant contribution first as Sales Manager,\n    then Group Manager and I know this will continue es Director. Lori will\n    continue to report to David Tannenbaum, Director for US Local OEM Sales, as\n    he will continue with his responsibilities for the all up Named and System\n    Builder sales in the US.\n\n\n\n    Before joining us, Jeannine worked in PCMIT where she oversaw the PC mark.et\n    and attach trends for 78 subsidiaries and integrated analysis on MNA,\n    Netbook, Apple and UPC into the forecast while managing live direct reports.\n    In addition to managing negotiations and discussions with 78 subsidiary GMs\n    and several regional VPs, she reported and defended results out to a variety\n    of executive stakeholders including from Client, Server and IW BGs, OEM,\n    Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations. In tier current role. she has\n    ramped quickly and has been a key liaison to working with her former team in\n    properly setting the market and attach trends and communicating out those\n    trends to the various stakeholders. Jeannine's unique work experience lends\n    itself to helping through cross-group and cross-team collaboration to\n    facilitate a more streamlined process and continued focus on attach through\n    sates operations aM Business Management.

Appellee’s Br. at 36. This theory—even if it had any factual\n\nbasis, which it does not—does not correspond to a claim under the Texas Labor\n\nCode (“TCHRA”). Therefore, in response to Microsoft’s appeal, Mercieca does\n\nnot offer a coherent, linear narrative explaining how the evidence he adduced\n\nprovides     a    legally   sufficient   basis   to   satisfy   the   elements   of   a\n\nretaliation/constructive discharge claim under Section 21.055 of the TCHRA.\n\nInstead, he does what he did at trial: masks the absence of relevant facts with a\n                                            1\n\fscattershot recitation of his subjective take on various isolated incidents, some\n\ndating back a decade before he engaged in the claimed “protected activity,” and\n\nsome that date well after he filed suit—and even after he finally left his job with\n\nMicrosoft voluntarily seven months later.1\n\n       In struggling to defend the jury’s findings, Mercieca grossly misrepresents\n\nthe actual substance of the hodgepodge of evidence adduced at trial. For instance:\n\n    He insists that his performance “became an issue for the first time in his\n     career at Microsoft” only after he complained about his managers on April\n     19, 2010. Appellee’s Br. at 51. In fact, the evidence shows that his annual\n     review for 2005—five years earlier—noted that his current “role was not\n     going to work out as a career choice” and indicated that he “did not meet\n     expectations.” 18RR:MSFT7. Thereafter, his 2006 midyear review still\n     noted “needs improvement” in multiple categories. 18RR:MSFT8.\n\n    Similarly, he claims that he only got a poor review in September 2011\n     because Eddie O’Brien, a Microsoft vice president, issued an “edict” to rate\n     him at the lowest performance level. Appellee’s Br. at 15, 51. But Mercieca\n     entirely ignores the uncontroverted evidence about how and why he was\n     ranked as he was relative to his larger sales group by the person who\n     actually prepared the review. See TAB J; 10RR20-29.\n\n    Further, Mercieca asserts that, in “mid-2009 to early 2010,” his managers\n     “made unsolicited comments about Mercieca needing a job.” Appellee’s Br.\n     at 27. The incidents to which he alludes happened well before he claims to\n     have engaged in any protected activity and thus, as explained below, cannot\n     be “retaliation” under the TCHRA. Moreover, no one ever told him that he\n     “needed to find a new job,” as Mercieca spins it. Id. He relies, for instance,\n     on a joke O’Brien made in the summer of 2009 after Mercieca had\n     performed with a band at a Microsoft event. Mercieca testified that,\n     “[O’Brien] said that -- he said that if -- I could get my friend, Bono, from U2\n\n       1\n          In a two-week trial, Mercieca testified for days about his subjective perception of\nisolated incidents spanning over a decade. 5RR92-268; 6RR220-278; 7RR6-277; 8RR5-221;\n9RR6-67.\n\n                                             2\n\f      to give you a job.” That Mercieca found it “strange” in 2009 that O’Brien\n      teased Mercieca about joining one of the most popular bands in history is\n      hardly evidence that Mercieca was constructively discharged in 2012.\n      8RR81-82.\n\n    Additionally, to support the incorrect assertion that he was told to look for\n     another job, Mercieca refers to announcements regarding positions within\n     Microsoft, sent to him before April 19, 2010, that would have resulted in\n     promotions. 18RR:MSFT39, 18RR:MSFT63. That he, who had initially\n     worked for Microsoft in Australia and was from England, thought it “weird”\n     that he was invited to apply for significant promotions to positions in New\n     Zealand (on October 6, 2009) and in Europe (on February 11, 2010) is not\n     evidence that he was constructively discharged in 2012.\n\n    Equally inaccurate is his claim that, in a phone call on April 15, 2010, his\n     direct supervisor “told Mercieca he needed to find a new job.” Appellee’s\n     Br. at 27. The transcript of that call, which Mercieca secretly recorded,\n     reveals that Mercieca spent over 40 minutes haranguing his supervisor, who\n     hardly spoke. 11RR9-52. After he had reduced her to tears, he was the one\n     who demanded: “Are you telling me to look for another job?,” to which she\n     answered, “No.” 11RR30-31. Mercieca later told HR that she had\n     threatened to fire him during this conversation, 7RR238-39, but that\n     characterization was as untrue then as it is now.\n\n    He also incorrectly asserts that a Microsoft HR director told his managers\n     that they should “let it go” with respect to the co-worker’s complaints about\n     Mercieca because there was “nothing there.” See Appellee’s Br. at 51. To\n     support this reputed “fact,” he cites nothing but his own testimony—\n     8RR217—when he attempted to explain the basis for his view that a\n     “conspiracy” had been launched against him; his testimony is, however,\n     nothing more than rank speculation.\n\n      Ultimately, the most compelling “evidence” to which Mercieca’s brief refers\n\ndoes not exist. The evidence actually adduced at trial does not satisfy the standard\n\nof legal sufficiency to support a finding of retaliatory constructive discharge, as a\n\nmatter of law.\n\n\n                                         3\n\f                               ARGUMENT IN REPLY\n\n      Mercieca’s brief pays relatively little attention to the core issue of whether\n\nthere was legally sufficient proof to support the jury’s liability findings. This is\n\nbecause the record is bereft of evidence to support the findings of (1) constructive\n\ndischarge, (2) good faith engagement in a protected activity, or (3) but-for\n\ncausation; thus there are three distinct reasons for reversing and rendering a take-\n\nnothing judgment for Microsoft. Additionally, if the Court were to reach the\n\nmultiple damages issues raised in the appeal and cross-appeal—which Microsoft\n\nrespectfully suggests will be unnecessary—the damages evidence is so flawed that\n\nit amounts to no evidence at all, thus also warranting reversal and rendition.\n\nI.    MERCIECA PROVIDES NEITHER LAW NOR EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT A\n      CONCLUSION THAT MICROSOFT RETALIATED AGAINST HIM BY\n      COMPELLING HIS CONSTRUCTIVE DISCHARGE.\n\n      A. Mercieca Provides Neither Law Nor Evidence to Support the Jury’s\n         Constructive Discharge Finding.\n\n         1. Mercieca has no law to support the constructive discharge\n            finding.\n\n      Mercieca has no legal support for his position that the proof adduced at trial\n\nis sufficient to sustain the jury’s finding that he was constructively discharged. In\n\nresponding to Microsoft’s legal sufficiency challenge, Mercieca instead leans\n\nheavily on a breach of contract case. Appellee’s Br. at 25-26 (citing Vaughan v.\n\nHartman Mmgt., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5514335</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.

The charge-error issue in Vaughan is irrelevant to\n                                          4\n\fthe issue of the quantum and quality of proof required to support a constructive\n\ndischarge finding. Microsoft has not raised a charge-error issue in this appeal.\n\nThe issue is whether Mercieca adduced a scintilla of evidence that satisfies the\n\ncorrect legal standard, which was accurately articulated by the trial court in the\n\njury charge: did his employer make “conditions so intolerable that a reasonable\n\nperson in the employee’s position would have felt compelled to resign.” TAB A,\n\nQuestion 7.\n\n      None of the constructive discharge cases cited in Mercieca’s brief supports\n\nthe notion that (1) the evidence of workplace incidents Mercieca adduced represent\n\nconditions so “intolerable” as to reasonably compel a resignation or (2) a person\n\ncan sue his employer and then resign months later, as he did, declaring his\n\nunilateral decision a retaliatory constructive discharge.

In Passons, the\n\ncourt of appeals reversed based on the trial court’s erroneous instruction that the\n\nplaintiff was required to show that the claimed discrimination was the “sole cause”\n\nor “the basis” for the reputed constructive discharge.       Id. at 562 (emphasis\n\nretained). To determine whether the charge error was harmful, the court evaluated\n\nthe record and concluded that “we cannot say that the cumulative effect of the\n\nconduct here could not support a jury finding of constructive discharge.” Id. at\n\n564. In reaching this conclusion, Passons notes evidence that, during a discrete\n\nperiod following an audit, the plaintiff was “more harshly punished than were her\n\nmale counterparts for engaging in” the same misconduct, that she “was threatened\n\nwith criminal and financial sanctions which she contends were unjustified and\n\nhumiliating,” and that “her supervisors belittled and demeaned her in front of her\n\nown staff, preventing her from effectively doing her job.” Id. As discussed below,\n\nMercieca adduced no comparable evidence.

In Itz, the court of appeals relied on evidence, in\n\naffirming judgment for the plaintiff, that the plaintiff’s supervisor: repeatedly\n\ncalled her at home at night to ask about her relationship status; promised to put her\n\nup in an apartment if she broke up with her boyfriend; complimented her body;\n\ntouched her inappropriately during a one-on-one back-room meeting; was “‘always\n\nhovering around her and following her’”; gave her a “‘very forceful’” “‘body-to-\n\nbody’” hug; pressed her to break up with her boyfriend; and after she reported this\n\nconduct, the employer did not respond to her at all.        Id. at 462-65, 473-75.\n\nMercieca did not adduce evidence of anything remotely akin to such conduct.\n\n      Surprisingly, Mercieca suggests that the jury was “entitled” to adopt his\n\nconstructive discharge theory because his situation at Microsoft resembles the\n\ncircumstances presented in Emeritus Corp. v.

Appellee’s Br. at 30. Emeritus affirmed a\n\nconstructive discharge claim brought by a whistleblower against an assisted living\n\nfacility. Plaintiff Blanco, an administrator, was brought in to try to right a non-\n\ncompliant facility. Id. at 272. She left her job after less than one year, thereafter\n\nfiling suit. The evidence showed that, during her brief tenure, her employer failed\n\nto take action to remedy the following: “medications [were] not being properly\n\ndocumented or dispensed, proper medical attention [was] not being provided and\n                                         7\n\faddressed, documentation to the residents charts [was] not being properly charted,\n\ncommunication to the doctors [was] not up to date[.]” Id. at 275. At one point,\n\nBlanco was called to an Alzheimer patient’s room, where the patient was lying in\n\nbed with a mass protruding from her body. Id. at 273. Blanco had to track down a\n\nnurse in another facility because hers did not have a single nurse on staff; she then\n\nagonized as the patient “suffered from multiple issues while waiting for surgery.”\n\nId. at 274. Instead of responding to Blanco’s requests for support, her employer\n\n“formally reprimanded” Blanco for permitting the facility to get “behind on\n\nbilling.” Id. She thereafter resigned, providing a detailed list of the concerns that\n\nhad shaken her, with an entreaty “that you immediately address these concerns to\n\nensure the safety and well being of the residents.” Id. at 275.\n\n      No evidence in the record supports the notion that Mercieca experienced any\n\ncomparable “conditions so intolerable” that his after-the-fact resignation can be\n\ndeemed objectively reasonable.

(finding that the plaintiff “did not show that the working\n\nconditions were unbearable, or that her employer was attempting to encourage her\n\nto resign.”)\n\n       In Tiner, the court painstakingly considered the various incidents upon\n\nwhich the employee relied, in the light most favorable to the employee, and found\n\nthose incidents, taken together, did not amount to intolerable conditions as a\n\nmatter of law. Id. at 394-97. Tiner merits considerable attention, because the\n\nisolated incidents at issue there are comparable to those upon which Mercieca\n\nrelies. See Appellee’s Br. at 27-29, 33-35.\n\n       First, Tiner insisted that her employer had mishandled a conflict with one of\n\nher co-workers. Tiner, 294 S.W.3d at 396.

While\nMercieca takes issue with Microsoft’s reliance on federal cases, this critique is unfounded, as the\nSupreme Court of Texas has “consistently held that those analogous federal statutes and the\ncases interpreting them guide [its] reading of the TCHRA.” Mission Consol.

Similarly, he asserts that Microsoft has no “on-point\nauthority” to support the type of constructive discharge theory pursued here. Appellee’s Br. at\n19, 37. What is true is that neither party can point the Court to any case in which a constructive\ndischarge claim has been maintained based on facts similar to those Mercieca adduced at trial.\n\n                                                9\n\fhe felt “marginalized” as a result, and that he had to file his own internal complaint\n\nagainst his management chain to learn what had happened to Rummel’s complaint.\n\nTAB E; Appellee’s Br. at 8, 9, 27. But the evidence shows that, after Rummel took\n\nher initial concerns to Mercieca’s manager, to her own Microsoft manager, and to\n\nits HR department, Microsoft directed her to follow up with the contracting agent\n\nthen employing her.3 18RR:MSFT48-50. Then, after Rummel became a full-time\n\nemployee, she reached out again to Microsoft’s HR department after experiencing\n\nwhat she saw as repercussions attributable to Mercieca. TAB F. While Mercieca\n\nthreatened “legal escalation” unless he was told what Rummel had said about him\n\nduring her confidential interview, Microsoft explained that doing so would violate\n\ncompany policy; however, Microsoft kept him fully informed as the investigation\n\nmoved       forward.      18RR:MSFT105;           18RR:MSFT126;           18RR:MSFT97;\n\n18RR:MSFT115.\n\n       Second, Tiner insisted that her own complaints were ignored, despite\n\nevidence that the employer conducted an internal investigation, as Mercieca does.\n\n294 S.W.3d at 396.         The evidence here shows that Microsoft conducted an\n\nextensive investigation into both Rummel’s and Mercieca’s HR complaints.\n\n18RR:MSFT260. Microsoft found insufficient evidence that its anti-discrimination\n\n\n       3\n         As noted in the Appellant’s brief, when Rummel first raised her concerns about\nMercieca, she was employed as a contract employee through an agency and assigned to work\nwith Mercieca on marketing issues for some of Mercieca’s Microsoft “partner”/client accounts.\nAppellant’s Br. at 6-7.\n\n                                             10\n\for anti-harassment policies had been violated in either instance, but reprimanded\n\nAulds for failing to disclose that she had once had a brief romantic relationship\n\nwith Mercieca, which they had both kept to themselves until 2010 when he\n\nproduced evidence of photocopied love letters and voicemails from 2001-2002\n\nduring the ERIT investigation. 18RR:MSFT178; 18RR:MSFT189. Aulds was\n\nthen removed from his management chain. 6RR83-85; 10RR68-69. No evidence\n\nsupports Mercieca’s insistence that she was “promoted” after the reprimand.4\n\nLikewise, no adverse employment action against Mercieca resulted from the\n\ninternal investigation,5 although the investigator found reason to suspects his\n\nmotives. 18RR:MSFT178; 6RR75-79; TAB M.\n\n       Third, Tiner insisted that the co-worker with whom she had difficulty was\n\n“abusive, threatening, and unpleasant”—which Mercieca cannot reasonably\n\nclaim—yet the court of appeals found the proffered evidence “no basis to conclude\n\nthat [the employer] somehow created unendurable working conditions” or that this\n\nsituation “caused Tiner to resign months later.” 294 S.W.3d at 397. Similarly,\n\nMercieca complains that Aulds was permitted to give him a review in 2010\n\n\n       4\n         Appellee’s Br. at 14 (citing testimony that contradicts the contention that she was\n“promoted,” 6RR183-84; 11RR86-87, and Mercieca’s subjective testimony that he nevertheless\nregarded the change as a promotion, 6RR218-19).\n       5\n          As addressed in the Appellant’s brief, poor performance evaluations, which an\nemployee views as unfair, cannot form the basis of a constructive discharge claim. Appellant’s\nBr. at 20-21, 30-31, 36-37. Regardless, Mercieca did not receive the poor review about which he\ncomplains until September 8, 2011, well after members of his management chain had changed\nand long after Rummel’s HR complaint against him had been resolved. 18RR:MSFT216; TAB J.\n\n                                              11\n\f(Appellee’s Br. at 14, 28) while his HR complaint about her was pending. Yet (1)\n\nthat review was largely positive; and (2) he did not resign until nearly two years\n\nlater, well after Aulds had been removed from his management chain entirely and\n\nreplaced by someone he liked and admired. 18RR:MSFT166; 7RR144;\n\n18RR:MSF394; TAB I.\n\n      Fourth, Tiner insisted “that her supervisor got into an argument with her,\n\nended her access to his email, and stopped talking to her”—yet the court of appeals\n\nheld that this conduct did “not rise to the level of conduct designed to badger,\n\nharass, or humiliate Tiner,” and found no basis to “conclude that the conduct was\n\ncalculated to encourage her resignation.” Id. at 395. Here Mercieca relies heavily\n\non these kinds of communication issues, including his subjective interpretation of\n\nemails as unduly “scrutinizing” his work. See, e.g., 18RR:MSFT57-60.\n\n      Fifth, Tiner complained about the tone of meetings with her supervisors, as\n\nMercieca does. 294 S.W.3d at 396. Mercieca, however, points to nothing in any\n\nmeeting that could be viewed objectively as “badgering, harassing, or humiliating\n\nor that [] was calculated to encourage [him] to resign.” Id. Indeed, the meetings\n\nand phone calls with his colleagues that Mercieca secretly recorded show his\n\nmanagers talking with him about business concerns and trying to resolve\n\ncommunication issues as he raised them. 18RR:MSFT58-MSFT61. Furthermore,\n\nas in Tiner, the meetings with his direct supervisor (Lori Aulds) and skip-level\n\n\n                                        12\n\fmanager (David Tannenbaum) about which Mercieca complains “took place\n\nmonths before [he] resigned.” 294 S.W.3d at 396.\n\n      In short, Tiner, like Mercieca, “was not satisfied with the way her supervisor\n\nhandled [a] situation.” Id. at 397. But such subjective frustration “does not rise to\n\nthe level of an adverse employment action.” Id. Like Tiner, Mercieca “was not\n\nfired or demoted, [he] was not reassigned or suspended. The minor actions that did\n\noccur do not represent meaningful changes in the conditions or privileges of [his]\n\nemployment.” Id.; 8RR65-70.\n\n         3. Mercieca’s scattershot approach            to   proving    constructive\n            discharge is legally impermissible.\n\n      Tiner helps to illuminate the fundamental failings of Mercieca’s constructive\n\ndischarge proof. But Mercieca’s constructive discharge theory is burdened by\n\nadditional analytical problems not present in Tiner. First, the incidents upon which\n\nTiner focused all happened within a discrete timeframe, while Mercieca’s\n\nperceived slights are scattered over a period of years. Second, Tiner’s incidents all\n\nhappened before she resigned, thus conceivably supporting a claim that they\n\ncompelled her departure.      Mercieca did not resign until months after suing\n\nMicrosoft. CRS11-33; TAB J.\n\n      The isolated incidents about which Mercieca complains were (and remain)\n\nuntethered to any discrete time that could rationally be relevant to his reputed\n\nconstructive discharge. Many of the incidents listed in his brief as comprising the\n\n                                         13\n\f“constructive discharge puzzle” can be disregarded, in accordance with basic rules\n\nof cause and effect. Appellee’s Br. at 27-30. To begin with, Mercieca’s initial HR\n\n“formal complaint,” dated April 19, 2010, describes concerns that do not relate to\n\nany anti-discrimination or anti-harassment policy. TAB E; TAB M at MS37863.\n\nAlthough Mercieca now tries to recast the April 2010 complaint as a “charge of\n\ngender discrimination,”6 events that predate his April 2010 complaint cannot\n\nlogically show that he was constructively discharged as retaliation for making that\n\ncomplaint. Appellee’s Br. at 32.\n\n       For instance, Mercieca relies on the brief affair he had with Aulds in 2001.7\n\nHe then describes comments Aulds made to him in 2008, when he fully supported\n\nher for the position of manager of his sales group.8 Id. at 5-6; 33-35.\n\n       After emphasizing the 2001 affair, Mercieca restarts his narrative in “mid-\n\n2009 and early 2010,” stating that “[o]n April 15, 2010”—several days before he\n\nhad lodged any complaint against his managers—“Aulds told Mercieca he needed\n\nto find a new job.” Id. at 27. To support this statement, Mercieca cites his own\n\ntestimony in which he refers to a phone call he had with Aulds, which he secretly\n\nrecorded. Id. (citing 9RR61). The transcription of that phone call does not support\n\n       6\n         At trial, Mercieca asked the jury to find that his alleged constructive discharge was\nmotivated by his age or his national origin, which the jury declined to do. Tab A, Question 8.\n       7\n         Mercieca continues to reference a “sexual harassment” claim made in June 2010\npremised on his 2001 relationship with Auld, which Microsoft investigated and found baseless\nand which even Mercieca dropped before the formal charge conference. CRS520-521; TAB A.\n       8\n           See, e.g., 8RR259-61; 8RR264-65; 8RR267; 18RR:MSFT10.\n\n                                             14\n\fhis representation that she told him he “needed to find a new job.” 11RR9-52.\n\nMoreover, the call cannot be evidence of retaliatory constructive discharge, as\n\nMercieca had not yet made the reputed charge of discrimination. Even Mercieca’s\n\nself-serving (and inaccurate) testimony about this call shows that he was having\n\ncommunication problems with Aulds in “e-mail traffic going backwards and\n\nforwards” about his expense reports or “T&Es.” 5RR238. Mercieca’s prickliness\n\nin communications with his supervisor predated any alleged protected activity and\n\nhad nothing to do with allegations of discrimination.       16RR:PX35; see also\n\n11RR9-52; 18RR:MSFT20; 18RR:MSFT21; 18RR:MSFT40; 18RR:MSFT55;\n\n18RR:MSFT57. This dispute about expense reports cannot reasonably be deemed\n\npart of what “compelled” him to resign years later.\n\n       Similarly, Mercieca cites his own testimony, in which he states that, leading\n\nup to March 26, 2010, he felt “subjected to a lot of harassment, bullying, and\n\nretaliation.”   9RR7.   First, Mercieca’s subjective beliefs “are insufficient to\n\nestablish a prima facie case” of an unlawful employment practice. Chandler v.\n\nCSC Applied Techs., LLC, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">802</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 814 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n2012, pet. denied). Second, even Mercieca did not attribute his discomfort in the\n\nmonths leading up to his HR “formal complaint” to discrimination. In that HR\n\ncomplaint, he claimed that he felt “marginalized” because Rummel’s concerns\n\nabout him had “led to an escalation within HR” and to his management team, and\n\nhe found it “extremely upsetting” that “[a]t no time was I ever consulted about this\n                                         15\n\fby anyone.” TAB E. Feeling “marginalized” and distressed because Rummel had\n\nvoiced concerns about him cannot be evidence that Microsoft unlawfully retaliated\n\nagainst him for memorializing those feelings in an HR complaint that had not yet\n\nbeen made. Whatever Mercieca felt before April 19, 2010 when he engaged in the\n\nalleged protected activity does not prove that afterwards Microsoft retaliated by\n\nmaking circumstances so “intolerable” that a reasonable person would have been\n\ncompelled to resign two years later.\n\n       Additionally, some of Mercieca’s purported evidence that he was\n\n“constructively discharged” hinges on material that he only learned of through\n\nlitigation.   For instance, he refers obliquely to a “plan” to “eliminate” him.\n\nAppellee’s Br. at 8, 27. His reputed proof of this “plan” is an internal Microsoft\n\ndocument—emailed on April 16, 2010 between two upper-level managers—\n\ndescribing a proposed “FY11 Field Sales Team Structure.”              16RR:PX152\n\n(proposing, inter alia, eliminating Mercieca’s sales position as duplicative). There\n\nis no evidence that Mercieca ever saw this document while he worked at\n\nMicrosoft. The document was prepared in response to a directive from upper\n\nmanagement about the need to consider workforce reductions throughout the\n\norganization—and the proposal was never implemented.          6RR57-62.     Despite\n\nMercieca’s post-resignation efforts to seize upon this document as confirming his\n\nsuspicions, this internal discussion about a potential workforce reduction is\n\nunremarkable.      Regardless, this evidence does not and cannot support a\n                                        16\n\fconstructive discharge finding. Mercieca did not know about this document and,\n\nas is evident by the fact that Microsoft continued to employ him for another two\n\nyears until he voluntarily left, the plan was not implemented. Furthermore, as the\n\nproposal was made before Mercieca had lodged any HR complaint against his\n\nmanagers, it cannot conceivably be considered “retaliation” against Mercieca for\n\nan HR complaint he had not yet made. Compare 16RR:PX152 with TAB E.\n\n      Equally unsound is Mercieca’s reliance on incidents that occurred after he\n\nhad already sued Microsoft and even after he finally announced his departure. For\n\ninstance, Mercieca cites as evidence of intolerable conditions his testimony about a\n\npotential “FY2012” evaluation that never took place. Appellee’s Br. at 16, 29.\n\nMercieca’s last review was a mid-year review conveyed to him on March 9,\n\n2012—several days after he had already resigned (via a letter sent from his\n\nlitigation counsel to Microsoft’s outside counsel on February 22, 2012).\n\nMercieca’s manager at that time, Joe Sahagian, only commenced giving the review\n\nbecause Mercieca had not told Sahagian about the decision to resign, “effective\n\nApril 2, 2012,” until they were in the middle of the review. TAB I; 10RR216. An\n\nevent that never occurred and another that occurred only after a person has already\n\nresigned cannot evidence “intolerable” conditions that compelled the resignation.\n\n      Mercieca’s alleged constructive discharge is premised entirely on his\n\nsubjective interpretation of isolated incidents scattered over a ten-year period.

Mercieca’s first HR complaint does not evidence good-faith\n                engagement in a TCHRA-protected activity.\n\n      Mercieca now endeavors to recast his first HR complaint, submitted on April\n\n19, 2010, as a charge of “gender-based discrimination.” Appellee’s Br. at 32. To\n\nsupport this characterization, Mercieca directs the Court away from the HR\n\ncomplaint itself—which says nothing about discrimination of any kind. TAB E.\n\n                                         19\n\fInstead, Mercieca points to a subsequent complaint that Mercieca made, which he\n\nmentioned at some point during the internal ERIT investigation that commenced\n\nafter June 9, 2010. Appellee’s Br. at 32. During that investigation, Mercieca\n\nsuggested that he had been offended by an email that O’Brien had sent to his entire\n\nU.S. sales team touting “Two Female Promotions to Director in USOEM!” TAB N.\n\nMercieca does not direct the Court to the reputedly offending email, but to a\n\nsummary of the entire internal investigation of his HR complaints. Appellee’s Br.\n\nat 32 (citing 16RR:PX125). The summary upon which Mercieca relies notes that\n\nhe did not mention discrimination of any kind until after he was notified in May\n\n2010 that Rummel’s allegations were to receive an ERIT investigation:\n\n\n\n\nTab M at MS37863.\n\n      Regardless of whether O’Brien’s May 2010 email could be read objectively\n\nas offensive—as opposed to an effort to celebrate gender diversity within company\n\nmanagement—it is not evidence that Mercieca’s April 2010 HR complaint alleged\n\ndiscrimination.   First, his April 2010 HR complaint was made weeks before\n                                        20\n\fO’Brien’s email was sent. TAB G. A complaint about an email sent in May 2010\n\ncannot support a finding that his April 2010 complaint informed Microsoft of a\n\ncharge of “gender discrimination.” Second, Mercieca’s invocation of the O’Brien\n\nemail would not have put Microsoft on notice that Mercieca was claiming\n\ndiscrimination or sexual harassment.    “For workplace comments to provide\n\nsufficient evidence of discrimination, the comments must be,” inter alia, “(1)\n\nrelated to the plaintiff’s protected class, (2) proximate in time to the adverse\n\nemployment decision, … and (4) related to the employment decision at issue.”\n\nChandler, 376 S.W.3d at 816. The O’Brien email was not about a class to which\n\nMercieca belonged; the email was sent nearly two years before Mercieca resigned;\n\nand the email was unrelated to any employment decision that affected Mercieca.\n\nTAB N.\n\n      Mercieca’s April 2010 HR complaint speaks for itself and confirms what the\n\nrecord otherwise shows: that in late February 2010, Mercieca learned from Aulds\n\nthat Rummel had raised a concern about Mercieca’s behavior and that Rummel had\n\nreported her concerns; he then began demanding an “exoneration” regarding a\n\n“baseless rumor” about him that he felt Rummel had authored and Aulds had\n\nneedlessly referred to HR. 7RR159; 7RR161-64. An objective reading of the\n\nApril 2010 complaint (TAB E) and his communications with HR leading up to the\n\nemailing of that complaint (18RR:MSFT64; 18RR:MSFT67) show that his conduct\n\ndid not qualify as a TCHRA-protected activity.

Instead, the April 2010\n\ncomplaint confirms, as Mercieca later testified, that he felt “betrayed” that his\n\nmanagers had been “talking behind his back” about Rummel’s concerns and had\n\nnot come first to him—a long-time employee—about the concerns of a mere\n\n“contract” worker. 7RR168-170. During his initial conversations with HR, he did\n\nnot mention sexual harassment or discrimination based on gender or national origin\n\nor any other protected ground. 12RR19-27; 12RR31-32; 12RR35.

Mercieca’s second HR complaint does not evidence good-faith\n               engagement in a TCHRA-protected activity.\n\n      As explained in the Appellant’s brief, the “supplementation” that Mercieca’s\n\nlawyer submitted to Microsoft’s HR department on June 9, 2010 on Mercieca’s\n\nbehalf does not evidence a good faith claim of discrimination. Appellant’s Br. at\n\n41-43; see also TAB M at MS37863 (noting “it was not until [Mercieca] was\n\nnotified of the ERIT investigation in May 2010 [of Rummel’s allegations] that he\n\nraised his allegations of discrimination.”). The “supplementation” does not add\n\n                                       22\n\fany concrete information regarding his grievances; it contains only conclusory\n\nassertions that he is complaining of “harassing, discriminatory, and retaliatory\n\nconduct based on his gender and national origin” and “sexual harassment,” words\n\ninvoked solely to trigger a Microsoft ERIT investigation of his grievances. TAB G;\n\n8RR41-41;       11RR216-217;        18RR:MSFT97;         18RR:MSFT313.          The\n\n“supplementation” was only submitted after Mercieca and his lawyer had learned\n\nfrom a Microsoft ERIT investigator that Mercieca’s April 2010 complaint did not\n\nfall within the scope of the company’s anti-discrimination and anti-harassment\n\npolicies. 18RR:MSFT97; 18RR:MSFT115; 18RR:MSFT74; 18RR:MSFT78-80.\n\nOnly after the investigator had explained at length precisely why Mercieca’s\n\ngrievances fell outside ERIT’s scope did Mercieca’s lawyer prepare the June 9\n\n“supplementation” including, for the first time, vague charges of discrimination.\n\n      As this Court has explained, “[a] vague charge of discrimination will not\n\ninvoke protection under the statute.” Azubuike v.

Further, Texas law\n\nrequires evidence of but-for causation: “plaintiff must establish ‘but for’ causal\n\nnexus between the protected activity and the prohibited conduct.” Chandler, 376\n\nS.W.3d at 823 (finding “no evidence [plaintiff] engaged in the protected activity of\n\ncomplaining that he was not included [on trip list] because of his race and was then\n\nsubsequently terminated”) (emphasis retained).\n\n      To try to elude his causation problem, Mercieca has continuously shifted this\n\nretaliation theory. For instance, in his opening statement, Mercieca’s counsel\n\nsuggested that his managers’ motivation for “retaliating” against him was “because\n                                          24\n\fhe’s got no high school education, he’s got no college education.” 3RR205. In\n\nclosing, Mercieca’s counsel argued that Microsoft was motivated by Mercieca’s\n\nage (which no one at trial knew) and his national origin (British). 12RR121-22.\n\nAge discrimination was not even mentioned in his EEOC charge or in either of his\n\ninternal HR complaints. TAB E & TAB G.\n\n      Now, on appeal, Mercieca suggests that Microsoft “conspired to launch their\n\nsecret anti-Mercieca campaign” after he “report[ed] the O’Brien incidents.”\n\nAppellee’s Br. at 36. Indeed, that “campaign” was so “secret” that he has no\n\nevidence to support it. Moreover, this newest theory does not help him establish\n\ncausation because Mercieca only complained about O’Brien’s comments (which\n\nwere neither about, nor directed at, Mercieca) after Rummel had expressed\n\nconcerns about his conduct and after he had complained to HR because his\n\nmanagers had listened to her. Compare TAB E with TAB N. Moreover, his alleged\n\n“constructive discharge” was nearly two years thereafter. TAB I. In short, there is\n\nno evidence of any adverse employment action proximate to any protected activity,\n\nthus no causation. See Chandler, 376 S.W.3d at 816 (finding plaintiff presented\n\n“no evidence” that racially derogatory comments “were made close to the time of\n\nthe adverse employment decision at issue” and thus could not support TCHRA\n\nclaims).\n\n\n\n\n                                        25\n\f             2.

He has repeatedly characterized Rummel’s concerns as a “false\n\nsexual harassment” complaint. For instance, in Mercieca’s statement of the case,\n\nhe describes his retaliation claim this way: “Microsoft retaliated against him …\n\n[and] caused or encouraged another Microsoft employee to file a false sexual\n\nharassment charge against him.” Appellee’s Br. at 1; see also CRS6-10; TAB H\n\n¶53 (alleging a “campaign of retaliation against” him).\n\n      Even if such a theory could form the basis of actionable retaliation, no\n\nevidence, only rank speculation, supports Mercieca’s theory that some “secret anti-\n\nMercieca campaign” was launched against him through Tracy Rummel.\n\nAppellee’s Br. at 36. There is no evidence that anyone “caused or encouraged”\n\nRummel to complain about Mercieca. 4RR150-51.\n\n      Moreover, there is no evidence that Rummel ever filed a “false sexual\n\nharassment charge.” The uncontested evidence shows that, starting in November\n\n2009, Rummel spoke to various Microsoft personnel about her concerns. She\n\nspoke to Mercieca directly about her concerns. Then, after she joined Microsoft as\n\na full-time employee, Rummel experienced repercussions from having told\n                                        27\n\fMercieca about her concerns, including being removed from an account that she\n\nworked on with him. Therefore, she took these concerns to an HR director.\n\n9RR201; 16RR:P25-A; 4RR95-106; TAB F. The HR intake form that resulted\n\ndoes not support an inference that Rummel had been “encouraged” to bring\n\n“sexual harassment” allegations against Mercieca, as he suggests. The intake form\n\nnotes the same issues Rummel had raised a few months earlier: that Mercieca had\n\ntried to diminish her in front of a client by suggesting that she and he were dating\n\nand by making inappropriate comments that were sexual in nature. TAB F. The\n\nform also notes her new concern that, a few days after she spoke to Mercieca, a\n\nMicrosoft business partner asked that she be removed from his account. Id.\n\n      Mercieca cites nothing in the record to support the contention that Rummel’s\n\nstatements, as recorded by HR, were actually false. For instance, when Rummel\n\ncalled Mercieca to discuss her concerns about comments he had made at a client\n\ndinner, Mercieca threatened to “circle back” to those who had attended the event.\n\n9RR57; 16RR:P25-A. Mercieca followed through on his threat; and the client\n\nrepresentative to whom Mercieca “circled back” was Jason von Cordsen of Bass\n\nComputers. Von Cordsen, called by Mercieca at trial as a witness, admitted that\n\nnine days after the client event in question, he declared publicly at a Microsoft-\n\nsponsored meeting that he was not “getting any value” from Rummel so he wanted\n\nher taken off the account she was working on with Mercieca. 10RR84-86. In light\n\n\n                                        28\n\fof this testimony,9 Mercieca has no basis for suggesting that Rummel’s statement,\n\nas reported on the HR intake form, was false:\n\n\n\n\nTAB F.\n\n          Mercieca also admitted at trial that he had invited Rummel—a young, single\n\nwoman—to stay at his house when she was in town and that he had made\n\ncomments at a client dinner that made her uncomfortable, as the HR intake form\n\nstates.       Compare id. with 8RR45-46, 9RR32, 4RR86-90.              Indeed, the partial\n\nrecording he secretly made of his conversation with Rummel shows that he knew\n\nhe had said things at a client dinner, for instance, about “playing guitar in [her]\n\nbedroom,” that had caused her concern. 4RR87.\n\n          The “evidence” Mercieca offered to buttress his suspicion that Rummel was\n\nput up to making a complaint against him is no evidence at all: (1) a cell phone\n\nrecord showing that Rummel, a Microsoft employee, called Aulds, a Microsoft\n\nmanager in Rummel’s division, at various times, including the day that Rummel\n\n\n          9\n         Von Cordsen also admitted that he was told about the confidential HR complaints\nbrought by and about Mercieca and that his sole source of information about these internal HR\nmatters was Mercieca himself. 10RR123-124.\n\n                                             29\n\ffollowed-up with HR about Mercieca (PX243); and (2) an indemnification\n\nagreement that Microsoft executed with Rummel after Mercieca sued her (PX245).\n\nAppellee’s Br. at 12, 16.10         A “secret anti-Mercieca campaign” (let alone\n\nactionable retaliation) cannot reasonably be inferred from this evidence.\n\nMarathon, 106 S.W.3d at 728 (reminding that suspicion “is not the same as some\n\nevidence”).\n\n       These efforts to spin a conspiracy out of stacked inferences epitomizes the\n\nconcerns described in the seminal legal sufficiency case City of Keller v.

As the\n\ncourt explained, the competing inferences negate each other and amount to no\n\nevidence: “When the circumstances are equally consistent with either of two facts,\n\nneither may be inferred.” Id. at 813.\n\n       Rummel and Aulds independently denied talking about Rummel’s complaint\n\nagainst Mercieca after Rummel first sought guidance from Aulds in November\n       10\n          The Appellee’s brief only mentions the indemnification agreement, which was\nimproperly admitted, in passing, but the agreement was a focal point for Mercieca at trial.\n4RR157; 4RR276-78; 12RR106-107; 12RR112-133.\n\n                                            30\n\f2009 and Aulds referred Rummel to HR. 4RR150-51; 11RR74.                   Moreover,\n\nMercieca admitted that he had no evidence that his complaints were “leaked” to\n\nAulds or Rummel to help prepare a complaint against him. 9RR38. Even if the\n\njury disregarded Rummel’s testimony about why she went back to HR when she\n\ndid, that would “[n]ormally . . . not [be] considered a sufficient basis for drawing a\n\ncontrary conclusion.” Mathis v.

There is no\n\nevidence showing that Microsoft would have done anything differently but for\n\nMercieca’s internal HR complaints.

ALTERNATIVELY, MERCIECA’S DAMAGES EVIDENCE IS SO TAINTED THAT\n      THE ONLY REMEDY IS TO REVERSE AND RENDER JUDGMENT FOR\n      MICROSOFT.\n\n      The damages problems in this case, should the Court reach them, are so\n\nfundamental as to warrant a reversal and rendering of judgment in Microsoft’s\n\nfavor.

The Back-Pay Award Is Unsustainable.\n\n      Back pay, as Mercieca acknowledges, may be awarded by a district court\n\nunder the TCHRA to compensate for a “prohibited employment action.”\n\nAppellee’s Br. at 38. Here, there was no prohibited employment action, so no\n\nback-pay award was proper. Moreover, the court had no discretion to make this\n\n$623,065 award based on a jury finding that utterly ignored the instruction to\n\naccount for Mercieca’s failure to mitigate his damages. Mercieca’s only response\n\nis that he had no duty to mitigate his damages while still employed by Microsoft.\n\nAppellee’s Br. at 41. This is correct—a fortiori, he cannot, as a matter of law or\n\nequity, recover for a claim alleging a “constructive discharge” brought when he\n\nwas still gainfully employed by Microsoft.      Additionally, Mercieca cites no\n\nevidence of any job search other than Mercieca’s unsubstantiated testimony that he\n\nlooked at “a great many” job prospects. Id. at 41-42. He cannot cite anything\n\nspecific because no evidence of any job applications exists.       “A conclusory\n\nstatement is one that does not provide the underlying facts to support the\n\nconclusion.” Methodist Hosp. v.

And a conclusory statement does\n\nnot even create a fact issue. Id.\n\n      B. The Compensatory Damages Award Is Unsustainable.\n\n      The compensatory damages award (of $300,000) is based on two jury\n\nfindings devoid of evidentiary support: a finding of $1,000,000 in mental anguish\n                                       32\n\fdamages and $9,999,999.24 in punitive damages. The capped amount, although\n\nwell below what the jury awarded,11 cannot stand because no evidence supports it.\n\n       Mercieca incorrectly insists that the jury was free to make whatever mental\n\nanguish award it liked since the charge did not define the term. Appellee’s Br. at\n\n42. For this proposition he cites Jefferson Cnty v. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4262184</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] Aug. 28, 2014, pet. filed) (mem. op.).

App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1998, no pet.), in\n\nwhich this Court noted that “[e]motional distress is a subjective injury that is hard\n\nto predict, often speculative, easily fabricated, difficult to verify, and almost\n\nimpossible to refute.” These pitfalls are precisely why the Supreme Court has\n\ntaken pains “to fashion principles permitting recovery for severe emotional distress\n\nwhile maintaining constraints and safeguards against those who are merely\n\ndisappointed, embarrassed, or angry.” Id. Mercieca’s alleged distress does not\n\nsatisfy the standard because “liability does not extend to mere insults, indignities,\n\nthreats, annoyances, petty oppressions, or other trivialities[.]” Id. at 753-54.\n\n       11\n          Mercieca’s counsel invited error by urging the jury to award $1,000,000 in mental\nanguish and “ten million or more” in punitive damages knowing full well that this was a capped\ncase. 12RR125; 12RR131.\n\n\n\n                                             33\n\f      Mercieca expressed his view that his experience at Microsoft was “soul\n\ndestroying,” and his brief, citing his own testimony as evidence, states that he\n\n“now suffers from depression, for which he takes medication, and his sleep is\n\nerratic.” Appellee’s Br. at 44. Yet his personal therapist/expert acknowledged at\n\ntrial that the only mental disorder with which Mercieca had been diagnosed,\n\nstarting in 2003, was “adjustment disorder,” not depression, for which he was\n\nprescribed Lexapro, an anti-depressant, which he first took in 2001 after his\n\ndivorce. 9RR110-118; 9RR15. This diagnosis—which was consistent through\n\n2011—was made over a decade before his alleged “constructive discharge.” Id.\n\nAdditionally, the “stressors” to which Mercieca’s therapist attributed his condition\n\nwere, initially, a dysfunctional sexual relationship and then a child-custody dispute\n\nwith his ex-wife that had required police intervention and resulted in Mercieca\n\nbeing placed in handcuffs.     Id.   Mercieca’s therapist’s testimony established\n\nuncontrovertibly that Mercieca’s mental-health issues began years before Rummel\n\nraised concerns about his conduct in November 2009. As Mercieca’s brief states,\n\n“the Bass Computers function” in November 2009 was “the event that started it\n\nall” with respect to his grievances against Microsoft. Appellee’s Br. at 13. His\n\nlong-standing mental distress, which predates the Bass Computers event by over\n\nsix years, cannot be evidence of compensable “mental anguish damages” that\n\nresulted from a constructive discharge that he claims occurred two years\n\nthereafter. TAB A, Question 14.\n                                         34\n\f       Moreover, to support an award of mental anguish damages, “[t]here must be\n\nboth evidence of the existence of compensable mental anguish damages and\n\nevidence to justify the amount awarded.” Hancock v. Variyam, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 68\n\n(Tex. 2013) (emphasis added).      Mercieca’s testimony regarding his anxieties\n\ncannot justify the $1,000,000 finding that is the basis for the trial court’s award.\n\nIndeed, a case Mercieca suggests is analogous—where the court found sufficient\n\nevidence to uphold a mental anguish award—is completely inapposite.             See\n\nBennett v. Grant, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1324857</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. App.—Austin Mar. 20, 2015, no pet.).\n\nBennett affirmed an award of only $5,000 in mental anguish damages where the\n\nplaintiff had had to move repeatedly to protect himself from threats of violence\n\nfrom the defendant and had evidence of pronounced symptoms engendered by the\n\nstress. Id. at *11.\n\n      Likewise, in seeking to defend the punitive damages finding, Mercieca\n\nrattles off a selective list of his subjective view of events entirely denuded of\n\ncontext. Appellee’s Br. at 51-52. His description of these events cannot withstand\n\nscrutiny upon looking at the evidence itself. For example, Mercieca refers to\n\nTannenbaum’s answer to a hypothetical question from Mercieca’s lawyer about\n\nwhat Aulds might have intended when she discussed Mercieca’s “mental state with\n\nMercieca’s partner”—i.e., with Jason von Cordsen, a client representative of Bass\n\nComputers. Appellee’s Br. at 52. By looking at the testimony of von Cordsen\n\nhimself—the only witness, other than Aulds, privy to the conversation to which\n                                        35\n\fMercieca alludes—one finds that he did not view the conversation as retaliatory,\n\nmalicious, or in any way negative:\n\n          . . . it sounded like [Aulds] was\n      genuinely concerned about Michael's state of\n      paranoia, that -- that Michael -- Michael was\n      just overdocumenting things and – and asking\n      questions of other people, if you know, to --\n      to where it just seemed to her that he was\n      extremely paranoid and -- and something was\n      going on.\n\n          And I know that there was a taped\n      conversation between me and Michael that\n      evening and -- over the phone and I -- I had\n      brought up to Michael that I genuinely thought\n      -- at the time, I genuinely thought that --\n      that they were -- they were concerned for him.\n\n10RR92. Von Cordsen also described Aulds as “very professional” during this\n\nconversation.    10RR127. Therefore, Mercieca’s reliance on how a different\n\nwitness, with no personal knowledge of this conversation, responded to a leading\n\nquestion is no evidence of Microsoft’s “malice.”\n\n      When the standard is “clear and convincing,” as it is with punitive damages,\n\ncourts “must consider all the evidence,” not just the evidence favorable to the\n\njury’s finding. Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 817 (emphasis retained). That would include\n\nthe evidence of Microsoft’s independent internal investigation, which revealed that\n\nMercieca, not his managers, seemed animated by suspect motives. See, e.g., TAB\n\nM. Even if Mercieca’s self-serving and inaccurate representatives of the evidence\n\n\n\n                                        36\n\fare believed, on their face, these events do not amount to clear and convincing\n\nevidence of malice or reckless indifference on Microsoft’s part.\n\n       C. The Attorneys’ Fee Award Is Unsustainable.\n\n       Finally, the attorneys’ fees award (of $769,505.98 plus $192,376.50\n\nenhancement) cannot stand because it reflects an exercise of discretion that was\n\n“‘so arbitrary and unreasonable as to amount to a clear and prejudicial error of\n\nlaw.’” Winters v. Chubb & Son, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1440446\"><a href=\"/opinion/1440446/winters-v-chubb-son-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">568</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 580 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 2004, no pet.) (citation omitted). As explained in the Appellant’s\n\nbrief, the evidence used to support the fee award, which was calculated based on\n\nthe lodestar method, is so facially suspect that it amounts to no evidence.\n\nTherefore, relying on that evidence in the wake of the Texas Supreme Court’s\n\nrecent mandates regarding the proof required to support an attorneys’ fee award is\n\nindefensible.

But see El Apple, 370 S.W.3d at 765 (accepting that a lodestar derived from\n\na “legitimate base” is presumptively reasonable while noting that an enhancement\n\nmust be justified). None of Mercieca’s arguments can redeem the illegitimate base\n\nused to support his request for a fee award.

You may discuss the case with other jurors only\n         when you are all together in the jury room.\n\n                Remember my previous instructions: Do not discuss the case with anyone else, either in\n         person or by any other means. Do not do any independent investigation about the case or\n         conduct any research. Do not look up any words in dictionaries or on the Internet. Do not post\n         information about the case on the Internet. Do not share any special knowledge or experiences\n         with the other jurors. Do not use your phone or any other electronic device during your\n         deliberations for any reason.\n\n                 Any notes you have taken are for your own personal use. You may take your notes back\n         into the jury room and consult them during deliberations, but do not show or read your notes to\n         your fellow jurors during your deliberations. Your notes are not evidence. Each of you should\n         rely on your independent recollection of the evidence and not be influenced by the fact that\n         another juror has or has not taken notes.\n\n                 You must leave your notes with the bailiff when you are not deliberating. The bailiff will\n         give your notes to me promptly after collecting them from you. I will make sure your notes are\n         kept in a safe, secure location and not disclosed to anyone. When you are released from jury\n         duty, the bailiff will promptly destroy your notes so that nobody can read what you wrote.\n\n                  Here are the instructions for answering the questions:\n\n                            1. Do not let bias, prejudice, or sympathy play any part in your ~~rn1Tha District Court\n                                                                                             of Travis County, Texas\nFlied In The District Court\n of Travis County, Texas                                    1\n\n      MAY -5 2014\nM                S'iiS(p./>M,                                                    1185\nArnall• Rodrfguez-Mendoza, Cleric\n\f                        DC           BK141 28 PG381\n\n\n\n\n2. Base your answers only on the evidence admitted in court and on the law that\n   is in these instructions and questions. Do not consider or discuss any evidence\n   that was not admitted in the courtroom.\n\n3. You are to make up your own minds about the facts. You are the sole judges\n   of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to give their testimony. But\n   on matters of law, you must follow all of my instructions.\n\n4. If my instructions use a word in a way that is different from its ordinary\n   meaning, use the meaning I give you, which will be a proper legal definition.\n\n5. All the questions and answers are important. No one should say that any\n   question or answer is not important.\n\n6. Answer \"yes\" or \"no\" to all questions unless you are told otherwise. A \"yes\"\n   answer must be based on a preponderance of the evidence unless you are told\n   otherwise. Whenever a question requires an answer other than \"yes\" or \"no,\"\n   your answer must be based on a preponderance of the evidence unless you are\n   told otherwise.\n\n   The term \"preponderance of the evidence\" means the greater weight of\n   credible evidence presented in this case. If you do not find that a\n   preponderance of the evidence supports a \"yes\" answer, then answer \"no.\" A\n   preponderance of the evidence is not mea5ured by the number of witnesses or\n   by the number of documents admitted in evidence. For a fact to be proved by\n   a preponderance of the evidence, you must find that the fact is more likely\n   true than not true.\n\n7. A fact may be established by direct evidence or by circumstantial evidence or\n   both. A fact is established by direct evidence when proved by documentary\n   evidence or by witnesses who saw the act done or heard the words spoken. A\n   fact is established by circumstantial evidence when it may be fairly and\n   reasonably inferred from other facts proved.\n\n8. Do not decide who you think should win before you answer the questions and\n   then just answer the questions to match your decision. Answer each question\n   carefully without considering who will win. Do not discuss or consider the\n   effect your answers will have.\n\n9. Do not answer questions by drawing straws or by any method of chance.\n\n10. Some questions might ask you for a dollar amount. Do not agree in advance\n    to decide on a dollar amount by adding up each juror's amount and then\n    figuring the average.\n\n11. Do not trade your answers. For example, do not say, \"I will answer this\n    question your way if you answer another question my way.\"\n                                 2\n\n\n\n                                                      1186\n\f                                        DC          BK14128 PG382\n\n\n\n\n               12. Unless otherwise instructed, the answers to the questions must be based on the\n                   decision of at least ten of the twelve jurors. The same ten jurors must agree on\n                   every answer. Do not agree to be bound by a vote of anything less than ten\n                   jurors, even if it would be a majority.\n\n               13. You are the sole judges of the credibility or believability of each witness and\n                   the weight to be given to his or her testimony. In weighing the testimony of a\n                   witness you should consider his or her relationship to the Plaintiffs or to the\n                   Defendants; his or her interest, if any, in the outcome of the case; his or her\n                   demeanor or manner of testifying; his or her opportunity to observe or acquire\n                   knowledge concerning the facts about which he or she has testified; his or her\n                   candor, fairness and intelligence; and the extent to which he or she has been\n                   supported or contradicted by other credible evidence. You may in short,\n                   accept or reject the testimony of any witness in whole or in part.\n\n       As I have said before, if you do not follow these instructions, you will be guilty of juror\nmisconduct, and I might have to order a new trial and start this process over again. This would\nwaste your time and the parties' money, and would require the taxpayers of this county to pay for\nanother trial. If a juror breaks any of these rules, tell that person to stop and report it to me\nimmediately.\n\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\n\n\n                                                                    1187\n\f                                      DC           BK14128 PG383\n\n\n\n\nOther Instructions and Definitions:\n\n1.

(To this dlJY I do not know specifically what the~ atregations are).\n\n       I was ur aware of the diKussion ti etwft'n Tracy and lori until I felt so concetned ar.d \"ncomfon:ab1e for\n       approximately 3 months and I requested a meeting with mv manager to bring ~ concer1u to her anennon.\n\n       In this meeting, which took place Monday February 22•d, I voiced rrry concerns about a conversation Ms. Rummel\n       and I had Monday 9\"' November 2009, where she stated comment$ had been made to her by peopl~ at the event\n       about mv behavior and it concerned her. Her comments were vague and didn't disclose either specifically what I\n       was supposed to have done or who had raised the issues with her, despite my asking her num41rous times. Ms\n       Rummell also confirmed many times that our conversation was between her and I and no further action or\n\n\n\n\n.:\n       investigation was required on my part.\n\n       My manager then confirmed:\n\n           l..   Ms Rummel had stayed at her home that weekend as friends, (Sunday November 8th}, and had spolcen to\n                 her about this.\n           2.    That my manager had directed Ms Rummel to talk to me which she did the following day - albeit under\n                 the guise of a private conversation. Clearly this was not true.\n           3.    My manager had escalated this to Marc Pisan, Tracy's manager and he subsequently escalated it to HR. I\n                 have since confirmed that my manager actually escalated to HR.\n           4.

My manager stated ei<plic1tly that what I was sensing was \"probably d11e to the allegation\n       Tracy had m;ide\"'\n\n       This was of course extrtirnely upsetting to me. At no time was I ever consulted about this by anyone. We had an off·\n       site in Oecember7'~ ·l.O'h wh•re all the mangers were present as was Mickv Shields from HR and no one took me\n       to one side to discuss this.

Approximately seven (7) weeks has passed since Mr. Mercieca's initial Formal\nComplailll and virtually nothing has been done to inform him as to what allegations have\nspecifically been made and/or to ascertain his account of events in relation to such specific\nallegations. As of June 8'11, Ms. Shields is just \"getting back to\" Mr. Mcrcieca under the email\nbeading which aptly summarizes Microsoft's continued inaction to minimize Mr. Mercieca's\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                             •\nsituation, \"Follow-up on your concern.\"\n\n         One would hope that after employing such an outstanding employee, repre.sentative, and\nambassador, Microsoft would kmJ\\v Michael Meccieca after l 6 years of service. To that end, the\nmost important thing to Mr. Mercieca is his name and reputation. It is paramount to him that he\nis cl.eared of any and all accusations and that his reputation is wholly restored. We sincerely\nhope that l'vficrosoft will start to address Mr. Mercicca's complaint with the attention that it\ndeserves.\n\n                                                     Sincerely,\n\n\n\n\n                                                     Roy A.

DISCOVERY CONTROL PLAN LEVEL\n\n              Plaintiff intends that discovery be conducted under Discovery Level 3.\n\n                                D.      PARTJES AND SERVICE\n\n       1.      Plaintiff, Michael Mercieca, is an individual who resides in Travis County, Texas.\n\n       2.      Defendant, Tracey Rummel, is an individual and resident of Harris County, Texas\n\nand has appeared and answered herein.\n\n       3.      Defendant, MICROSOFT CORPORATION, .is a Washington State corporation\n\nauthorized to do business and doing business in the State of Texas at all relevant times hereto, and\n\nhas appeared and answered herein.\n\n                             ID.     JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n\n       4.      The subject matter in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of this court.\n\n       5.      This court has jurisdiction over the parties because Plaintiff and the individual\n\n\n\n\n                                                  1\n                                                                                                        499\n\fDefendant are both Texas residents, and some or all of the employees and agents of Mjcrosoft\n\nCorporation that committed the acts described below work and reside in Travis County, Texas.\n\nAdditionally, Microsoft Corporation has four offices within the State of Texas, located in Austin,\n\nDallas, Houston and San Antoruo.\n\n        6.      Venue in Travis County is proper in this cause under the mandatory venue provision\n\n§15.017 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code because it is the county in which Plaintiff\n\nresided at the time of the accmal of Plaintiff's slander cause of action. Under such Code §15.004\n\nand 15.005, venue for all of Plaintiffs other causes of action also lies in Travis County because\n\nsuch other causes of action arise out of the same transaction, occurrence or series of transactions or\n\noccurrences as Plaintiff's slander cause of action.\n\n        Alternatively, venue in Travis County is proper under the general venue provision of Code\n\n§15.002(a) (1) because it is the county in which all or a substantial part of the events or omissions\n\ngiving 1ise to Plaintiffs claim occurred.\n\n                                            IV.       FACTS\n\n        7.     Plaintiff is an individual residing in Travis County, Texas. He turned 50 years of\n\nage as of his birthday on August 22, 2010. He was born in London, England, has British, Australian\n\nand New Zealand citizenship status, and became a nationalized USA citizen in September 2010.\n\nPlaintiff was a Senior Sales Executive for Microsoft Corporation and wasa employed with\n\nMicrosoft around the globe for 17 years. Plaintiff consistently excelled with over quota sales\n\nperformance to much critical acclaim. Plaintiff received awards and much positive feedback from\n\nMicrosoft for his customer service and sales excellence and was widely recognized by his\n\ncustomers, partners, and his peers as one of the most passionate advocates for Microsoft and one\n\nof the most generous, compassionate, and supportive team players. Plaintiff was acknowledged\n\n\n\n\n                                                      2\n                                                                                                         500\n\fas a leader amongst his peers- he was a loyal, selfless, and inspiring friend and colleague and\n\nrecognized as the very embodiment of integrity. During his time at Microsoft, Plaintiff received\n\na number of Sales Recognition Awards, Long Service Awards and Customer Service Awards and\n\nwas the first recipient of the Sales District \"Spirit of the District Award\" at Microsoft. In\n\naddition, Plaintiff received numerous letters and e-mails of commendation from Microsoft\n\npartners and customers, and from his peers and colleagues.\n\n       8.      In or about September or October 2007, Lori Aulds, a Microsoft employee, became\n\nPlaintiff's direct manager. Plaintiff and Ms. Aulds had had a sexual relationship over a period of\n\nyears prior to her promotion as Plaintiff's direct manager. Plaintiff had ended such relationship\n\nsome time prior to Ms. Aulds's promotion to his manager. Ms. Aulds remained Plaintiff's direct\n\nmanager until in or about December 2010.\n\n       9.      Defendant. Rummel was an independent contractor hired through Xtreme\n\nConsulting to work for Microsoft as a contingent staffer \"CS\" and marketing consultant from on or\n\nabout November 2008 through on or about February 15, 2010. In February 15, 2010, she was hired\n\nby Microsoft as a full-time employee. Prior to being hired by Microsoft, Ms. Rummel had such a\n\nclose personal relationsfop with Ms. Aulds that they spent overnights together either at Ms. Aulds'\n\nhome or while away on business. In or about November 8, 2009, Ms. Rummel and Ms. Aulds\n\nspent the night together and allegedly Ms. Rummel advised Ms. Aulds that she was subjected to\n\nsexual harassment comments and actions by Mr. Mercieca.          Until Plaintiff filed this suit and\n\nconducted discovery, Plaintiff had not been told the substance of the actual allegations made by Ms.\n\nRummel to Ms. Aulds in November 8, 2009. Based upon information and belief, Ms. Rummel, in\n\nthis conversation with Ms. Aulds during this sleepover, accused Plaintiff of sexually harassing\n\nher. However, any statement made by Ms. Rummel to Ms. Aulds in or about November 8, 2009\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n                                                                                                       501\n\faccusing Plaintiff of \"sexual harassment\" was never communicated to Plaintiff by anyone,\n\nincluding by Ms. Rummel, until after Ms. Rummel's deposition was taken after this suit was filed.\n\n         10. It is undisputed that Ms. Rummel was not an employee of Microsoft in November of\n\n2009 and that Ms. Aulds was not a member of Microsoft's Human Resources at all times relevant\n\nto this suit.\n\n          11. Thereafter, in late 2009 and early 2010, Ms. Aulds began to unduly scrutinize and\n\ncriticize Plaintiff relative to his job performance and to discriminate against him in her treatment of\n\nhim as an employee versus the treatment received from her by other employees that she supervised.\n\nPlaintiff met with Ms. Aulds in or about February 2010 to discuss his concerns over such treatment,\n\nand his concerns about the hiring of Ms. Rummel since Plaintiff had heard complaints from\n\nMicrosoft partners/customers about Ms. Rummel. Ms. Aulds discouraged Plaintiff from going to\n\nHuman Resources with such concerns. Ms. Aulds specifically told Plaintiff that Ms. Rummel had\n\nnot filed any complaint against him. Ms. Aulds advised Plaintiff for the first time that Tracy\n\nRummel had related complaints of sexual harassment to her and that she had advised Human\n\nResources. In or about November of 2009, although Micky Shields told Ms. Aulds that the matter\n\nwas not an Human Resources issue since no complaint had been raised and no one had contacted\n\nher about any facts or complaint and that the matter would be closed and confidential, Ms. Aulds\n\ntook it upon herself to republish the false allegations made by Tracy Rummel and she passed it on\n\nto her boss David Tannebaum and then to his boss Eddie Obrien.\n\n         12. After the false allegations were passed on to Mr. Mercieca' s upper management by Lori\n\nAulds, Plaintiff began to be treated differently by his manager and upper management. On or about\n\nApril 19, 2010, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Lori Aulds and other managers with Microsoft's\n\nHuman Resources department, complaining of harassment, hostile work environment, and\n\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n                                                                                                          502\n\fdiscrimination based on sex, age and national origin. From that point on, Mjcrosoft's mistreatment\n\nand discriminatory treatment of Plaintiff intensified to include but not be limited to, a bad faith\n\ninvestigation by was perfonned on Plaintiff's formal complaint.\n\n       13 .   Ms. Aulds' s mistreatment and discriminatory actions towards Plaintiff included,\n\nwithout limitation, the following actions or omissions, some of which occurred after Plaintiff filed\n\nhis complaint with Microsoft Human Resources:\n\n               a.       Ms. Aulds did not have one-to-one meetings with Plaintiff in the same\n\n               amount and same frequency that she had with other employees she supervised;\n\n               b.       She urged Plaintiff to apply for a transfer within Mjcrosoft to a position in\n\n               Europe    or Australia/New Zealand,        and to Plaintiff's knowledge,        never\n\n               recommended him for a promotion to a position in the United States;\n\n               c.       She cut his expense budget when other employees similarly situated to\n\n               Plaintiff did not have their expense budgets cut;\n\n               d.       She prohibited him from attending important meetings, and important\n\n               conferences which he had attended in previous years, that were necessary for\n\n               Plaintiff to maintain good relationships with his Microsoft accounts, whereas other\n\n               employees she supervised who were younger than Plaintiff or less experienced than\n\n               Plaintiff, or had been employed for less time with Microsoft than Plaintiff, were\n\n               allowed to attend such conferences and meetings;\n\n               e.       She met and talked with Plaintiffs account customers without Plaintiff's\n\n               knowledge and participation to discuss their accounts and to tty and obtain adverse\n\n               infonnation about Plaintiff;\n\n               f.       She promised to support Plaintiff's request for a promotion, but then failed\n\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n                                                                                                        503\n\f                to do so;\n\n                g.      She deliberately failed to foiward to Plaintiff communications from his\n\n                customer accounts;\n\n                h.      She falsely accused Plaintiff of expense irregularities;\n\n                1.      She unduly scrutinized and questioned his request for vacation time;\n\n                J.      She failed to recognize project accomplishments of Plaintiff while\n\n                recognizing the accomplishments of other employees she supervised;\n\n                k.      She failed to assign lead roles to Plaintiff that should have been assigned to\n\n                him and that were assigned to similarly situated employees;\n\n                I.      She made disparaging comments about Plaintiffs nation of origin and\n\n                questioned his green card status and right to work for Microsoft;\n\n                k.      She falsely accused Plaintiff of improper office behavior; and,\n\n                I.      She conspired with David Tannebaum to give Mr. Mercieca a bad final\n\nreview, which ultimately David Tannebaum used to demote Mr. Mercieca to a level 5 OEM team\n\nmember when his manager at the time, Joe Sahagian, recommended Mr. Mercieca to a level 3.\n\n        14.     Ms. Aulds has admitted to Plaintiff that she could not handle her relationship to\n\nPlaintiff as his boss and insisted that Plaintiff look for another job.\n\n        15.     During Microsoft Human Resource' s official investigation of Plaintiff's complaint,\n\nMs. Aulds lied to the investigator, Dan Shea, and said that she had not had a prior sexual\n\nrelationship with Plaintiff in order to show Plaintiff as a liar. The lies Ms. Aulds told were key to\n\nthe investigation. Even though Microsoft subsequently became aware of Ms. Aulds lies during an\n\nofficial investigation, Microsoft subsequently promoted Ms. Aulds and demoted Mr. Mercieca.\n\nWhile the investigation was still ongoing David Tannebaum demanded the investigation end before\n\n\n\n\n                                                     6\n                                                                                                         504\n\fit was completed and before all of Mr. Mercieca's supporting witnesses were contacted.\n\n        16..   At or about the same time that Ms. Aulds was engaging in the above-described\n\nbehavior towards Plaintiff, other Microsoft managers engaged in similar mistreatment and\n\ndiscriminatory treatment of Plaintiff including, without limitation, the following acts and omissions,\n\nsome of which occurred after Plaintiff filed his complaint with Mjcrosoft Human Resources:\n\n               a.      Plaintiff was chastised by manager David Tannebaum for missing a deadline\n\n               by three hours, when other employees were not chastised for missing deadlines by\n\n               such short time frames;\n\n               b.      Plaintiff was accused by manager David Tannenbaum of not pe1fonning his\n\n               job adequately because of the length of time he remained at a certain grade whereas\n\n               other similarly situated employees were not similarly criticized;\n\n               c.      Plaintiff did not receive promotions which he should have received and\n\n               which were awarded to similarly situated employees and to American employees;\n\n               d.      Microsoft delayed its investigation and engaged in a bad faith investigation\n\n               of Plaintiff's complaint;\n\n               e.      Microsoft's Human Resources summarily dismissed Plaintiffs complaint\n\n               without speaking to Plaintiff;\n\n               f.      Microsoft reported to Plaintiff that it had found no basis for his complaint;\n\n               g.      Microsoft promoted Ms. Aulds, even after discove1ing that she had lied\n\n               during the investigation of Plaintiff's complaint;\n\n               h.       In announcing the promotion of Ms. Aulds, Manager Eddie O'Brien\n\n               emphasized her gender;\n\n               1.      Microsoft managers, including without limitation, Ms. Aulds, David\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n                                                                                                         505\n\fTannenbaum, and Eddie O'Btien, communicated with Plaintiff's customer accounts\n\nwithout Plaintiff's knowledge and participation to discuss their accounts which\n\nmarginalized Plaintiff's position with his accounts;\n\nJ.      Microsoft managers, including without limitation, Ms. Aulds and David\n\nTannenbaum, communicated with Plaintiff's customer accounts without Plaintiff's\n\nknowledge and participation to try and obtain adverse infonnation about Plaintiff;\n\nk.     Microsoft managers, including without limitation, David Tannenbaum,\n\nmade job assignments that discriminated against Plaintiff and one other person of\n\napproximately the same age as Plaintiff;\n\nI.     In Plaintiff's annual review conducted by Microsoft in or about August\n\n2010, he received a vastly reduced pay raise even though his performance numbers\n\nwere better than the previous year. He also received a bonus and stock options that\n\nwere 70% lower than the previous year even though his petformance numbers\n\nplaced him among the top six sales representatives. Another sales representative of\n\napproximately the same age as Plaintiff also received reduced compensation during\n\nthe same annual review. An American sales representative who finished towards if\n\nnot at the bottom of the sales representatives in terms of performance numbers and\n\nwho is far younger and less experienced than Plaintiff received the same rating as\n\nPlaintiff.-\" achieved\"-even though he did not achieve his performance quota.\n\nPlaintiff believes that this younger, less experienced, and under achieving sales\n\nrepresentative received similar or more generous compensation as Plaintiff during\n\nthe August 2010 annual review. During Plaintiff's 2010 annual review, which was\n\nattended by two managers and a human resources representative, Microsoft raised\n\n\n\n\n                                  8\n                                                                                      506\n\funsubstantiated and unsupported claims of negative job performance as a pretext for\n\nPlaintiffs reduced compensation increases. To Plaintiffs knowledge, no other sales\n\nrepresentative was \"ganged up\" on in this manner;\n\nm.      Microsoft increased its scrutiny of Plaintiff's job petformance and work\n\nproduct to an extent that exceeded the scrutiny of similarly situated employees or of\n\nyounger, less experienced employees, and to such an extent that Plaintiff's customer\n\naccounts have told him that they fear they will suffer adverse consequences if they\n\nsupport Plaintiff;\n\nn.      Plaintiff was prohibited from attending a key conference with customers,\n\nwhich then resulted in Plaintiff being left out of subsequent meetings with his\n\ncustomer accounts. Instead of attending the conference, Plaintiff was required to\n\nattend a six hour internal training program;\n\no.      Microsoft manager Eddie O'Brien prohibited Plaintiff from attending a sales\n\nmeeting with one of Plaintiffs customer accounts even though other, younger\n\nAmerican employees are allowed to attend the sales meetings where senior\n\nexecutives at Microsoft meet with their customer accounts;\n\np.      Job anniversary milestones and project accomplishments of other employees\n\nare recognized by Microsoft, but Plaintiff does not receive such recognition for his\n\nanniversary milestones or project accomplishments;\n\nq.      Constructive criticism offered by Plaintiff concerning Microsoft services or\n\nproducts, which in the past was readily accepted by Microsoft managers, is now\n\ntreated as evidence of Plaintiff's alleged \"bad attitude\" concerning his job;\n\nr.      Plaintiff was forced to perform duties that were clearly too much for one\n\n\n\n\n                                   9\n                                                                                        507\n\f               person to perform ;\n\n               s.     Disparaging comments were made about Plaintiffs nation of origin. One\n\n               of the managers, Eddie O'Brien, is known throughout the company, for his\n\n               disparaging comments about ctifferent nationalities, including one time when\n\n               shortly after the recent tsunami in Japan, he said that \" I would have zero pity for\n\n               Japan. I would push them right under the bus and create another tsunami;\" and,\n\n               t.     At off-site gatherings of Microsoft employees Plaintiff was ostracized by\n\n               .Microsoft managers, whereas the same managers were clearly engaging socially\n\n               with other employees.\n\n       17.     Within approximately 18 days of Plaintiff filing his complaint with Microsoft\n\nHuman Resources, Plaintiff was notified by Microsoft, on or after May 12, 2010, that a Microsoft\n\nemployee had filed a complaint against him. Plaintiff subsequently learned, on or about June 17,\n\n2010, that Defendant Tracy Rummel had filed a sexual harassment complaint and retaliation\n\ncomplaint against him with Microsoft Human Resources, alleging that Plaintiff had been sexuaJ\n\nharassing her for approximately from on or about November 8, 2008 through November 9, 2009.\n\n       18      Despite Ms. Rummel's claim of sexual harassment by Plaintiff occurring prior to\n\nher being employed by Microsoft, she sought to join the very sales team at Microsoft which\n\nincluded Plaintiff\n\n       19. After this lawsuit was filed and through discovery, Plaintiff learned that Ms. Rummel\n\nfiled her complaint against him with Microsoft on or about May 7, 2010. Through ctiscovery\n\nPlaintiff has learned that Ms. Rummel never contacted anyone at Microsoft Human Resources from\n\nNovember 2009 until she was persuaded to file her complaint against Mr. Mercieca on or about\n\nMay 7, 2010 by Ms. Aulds. And in retaliation for Mr. Mercieca' s complaint against Ms. Aulds.\n\n\n\n\n                                                10\n                                                                                                      508\n\f        20. Microsoft investigated the Ms. Rummel's complaint and found it to be baseless and\n\n\"unsupported'', yet Ms. Rummel received no adverse consequences for engaging in such activity.\n\nThe only reason Ms. Aulds received any disciplinary conduct was because after she got caught in\n\nher lies, she ultimately admitted to the lies, and of course, Microsoft was forced to admonish her.\n\n        21 .    After the onset of the above-described mistreatment and disc1iminato1y treatment,\n\nsome of Plaintiff's colleagues at Microsoft have noticed changes in Plaintiff's behavior at work,\n\ncommenting to Plaintiff that he appeared withdrawn during conference calls and did not ask\n\nquestions and discuss issues in the same manner and with the same enthusiasm as in the past.\n\n        22.     One coIIeague whom Plaintiff highly respects has told Plaintiff that it is obvious or\n\nclear to him that Microsoft managers are treating Plaintiff differently and negatively, and are\n\nattempting to undermine anything that plaintiff says or does.\n\n        23 .    The environment at work has become so intolerable and stressful that Plaintiff could\n\nno longer work in Microsoft's Austin office unless it was absolutely necessary to get the job done,\n\npreferring to work instead from his home office or at customer' s offices. The environment at work\n\ncontinued to be so intolerable and stressful that Plaintiff's employment with Microsoft was\n\nconstructively terminated on or about February 22, 2012 and as a result of Plaintiff being ordered to\n\nbe unjustly placed at a level 5.\n\n                  V.      RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR AND RATIFICATION\n\n        24.     Whenever in this complaint it is alleged that the Defendant Microsoft did any act\n\nor thing, or failed to do any act or thing, it is meant that the Defendant's officers, agents,\n\nservants, employees or representatives did such act with full authorization or ratification of the\n\nDefendant, or was done in the normal and routine course and scope of employment of\n\nDefendant's officers, agents, servants, employees, or representatives including Tracy Rummel ,\n\n\n\n\n                                                  11\n                                                                                                        509\n\fMarketing Manager, Marc Pisan, Marketing Director U.S. OEM, Lori Aulds, Regional Sales\n\nDirector U.S. OEM, David Tannebaum National Sales Director U.S. OEM, and Eddie O'Brien, a\n\nVice President U.S. OEM. Whenever it is alleged in this petition that a Microsoft employee did\n\nany act or thing or failed to do any act or thing, it is meant that such employee acted or fai led to\n\nact with full authorization or ratification of Defendant, or was done in the normal and routine\n\ncourse and scope of employment by Defendant, or was done in a capacity or manner that makes\n\nMicrosoft vicariously liable for such conduct.\n\n                       VI.     SLANDER & CONSPIRACY TO SLANDER\n\n        25.     Plaintiff adopts and incorporates by reference into this section of his petition the\n\nstatements set forth above in the Facts section as if set forth in this section.\n\n        26.     During the deposition of Tracy Rummels in this case, Plaintiff learned that\n\nDefendant Rummels had published false statements to Micky Shields in the Human Resources\n\nDepartment at Microsoft in November 2009 in that she accused Plaintiff of sexually harassing her\n\nand of retaliati ng against her while she was a C.S. (i.e., non-employee) of Microsoft. Rummels' s\n\nallegations were not investigated by Microsoft at the time. Upon information and belief, Aulds\n\nrepeated these false allegations of sexual harassment David Tannebaum and Eddie O\"Brien.\n\n        27.     On or about May 7 or 10, 2010, false statements were published and/or republished\n\nby Defendant Rummel in that she accused Plaintiff of sexually harassing her and of retaliating\n\nagainst her while she was a vendor for Microsoft.\n\n        28.     Plaintiff asserts the discovery rule.\n\n        29.     After Rummel published or republished the false statements in May 2010, her\n\nallegations were for the first time investigated by employees of Microsoft and determined to be\"\n\nunsupported.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                    12\n                                                                                                        510\n\f        30.    As a result of the false allegations, Plaintiff has been subjected to undue st1ict\n\nscrutiny of his job performance, hostile work environment, continued harassment by Microsoft,\n\nretaliation, demotion and constmctive discharge.\n\n        31.    Defendant Microsoft, by and through its officers, agents, servants, employees, or\n\nrepresentatives, including, but not limited to, manager, Lori Aulds, acting within the course and\n\nscope of her employment or under conditions that make Microsoft vicariousl y liable for her\n\nconduct, conspired with Defendant Rummel , to slander Plaintiff by making false statements of\n\nfact referring to Plaintiff, i.ncluding without limitation, false allegations of sexual harassment an.d\n\nretaliation.\n\n      32.      The false statements constitute defamation per se because they accuse Plaintiff of\n\nengaging in illegal activity and/or sexual misconduct and/or they directly bear on his fitness as a\n\nsales agent and businessman and/or they constitute injury to his personal and business reputation\n\nand to his occupation and/or impeach his honesty, integiity or virtue. Furthermore, these statements\n\nare defamatory because they tend to injure Plaintiff's reputation and occupation in the sales and\n\nbusiness community and expose him to public hatred, contempt, ridicule, and financial inj ury, and\n\nimpeach his honesty and integrity.\n\n        33 .   The defamatory statements are false, slanderous, and libelous. At all times relevant\n\nhereto, Plaintiff was an employee of Microsoft for 17 years and engaged in outside sales.\n\nDefendants made, or conspired with each other to make, the defamatory statements with the\n\nknowledge that they were false or with substantial grounds for knowing that they might be false and\n\nwith recldess disregard to whether they were true or false. AJtematively, the defamatory statements\n\nwere negligently published by Defendants. Upon information and belief, Defendant Rummel\n\npublished her sexual harassment complaint against Plaintiff at the insistence of Microsoft and in\n\n\n\n\n                                                   13\n                                                                                                          511\n\fretaliation for Plaintiff filing a complaint against Microsoft.\n\n        34.     As a direct and proximate result of Defendants' publication of, and/or conspiracy to\n\npublish, the defamatory statements, Plaintiff's business sales reputation has been severely injured.\n\nThe false allegations contained in the defamatory statements have caused Plaintiff to suffer severe\n\nmental anguish, public humiliation and embarrassment as a result of Defendants' intentional and/or\n\nnegligent acts since the truth was known to Defendants. As a direct and proximate result of\n\nDefendants' acts, Plaintiff has suffered pecuniary losses, including without limitation, loss of\n\nincome as a result of his constructive discharge, loss of future income, and loss of employee\n\nbenefits. Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages for these injuiies in an amount that exceeds the\n\nminimum jurisdictional limits of this Court.\n\n        35.     Plaintiff is entitled to exemplary damages from Defendants because they acted with\n\na specific intent to cause injury to Plaintiff or with conscious indifference to the rights, safety, or\n\nwelfare of Plaintiff and with actual, subjective awareness that their conduct involved an extreme\n\ndegree of risk of harm to Plaintiff Plaintiff seeks exemplary damages in an amount not to exceed\n\nthree times the amount of his actual damages as determined by the fact finder.\n\n        36.     The publication and republication of the false statements by Defendants was not\n\nptivileged.\n\n        37.     Defendants were not acting m good faith m publishing and republishing the\n\nstatements.\n\n        38.     Plaintiff did not consent to the publishing or republisfong of the false statements\n\nabout him. Plaintiff sought a fair investigation of his formal complaint yet Microsoft engaged in a\n\nbad faith investigation of his complaints in an effort to hide the truth.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   14\n                                                                                                          512\n\f                 VII.    EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES\n\n        39.     Plaintiff adopts and incorporates by reference into this section of his petition the\n\nstatements set forth above in the Facts section as if set forth in this section.\n\n        40.     Plaintiff timely filed a charge of discrimination against Defendant Microsoft with\n\nthe Austin Human Rights Division, a division of the Civil Rights Division of the Texas\n\nWorkforce Commission (\" TWC\"), and made a dual filing with the EEOC. Plaintiff exhausted\n\nhis administrative remedies, received a right to sue letter from the appropriate State agency, and\n\nthis suit has been timely filed under the Texas Labor Code. All conditions precedent to filing\n\nthis claim have been performed by Plaintiff or have occurred.\n\n                      VIIl. DISCRIMINATION IN VIOLATION OF\n                   THE TEXAS COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS ACT\n\n        41.     Plaintiff adopts and incorporates by reference into this section of his petition the\n\nstatements set forth above in the Facts section as if set forth in this section.\n\n        42.     During the course of his employment, Defendant Microsoft discriminated against\n\nPlaintiff because of age and/or sex and/or national origin.\n\n        43.     Specifically, and without limitation, Defendant subjected Plaintiff to undue\n\nscrutiny, denied him promotions, denied him bonuses and other compensation, question his green\n\ncard status and right to work in the United States, subjected him to isolation and ostracized him,\n\nundermined him vis-a-vis other employees and his customers, and subjected him to a hostile\n\nwork environment, retaliation, and/or constructive discharge, based upon his age, sex and/or\n\nnational origin, or a combination of each.\n\n        44.     Through such actions, Defendant Microsoft intentionally discriminated against\n\nPlaintiff in connection with the compensation, terms, conditions, and privileges of employment,\n\nor limited, segregated or classified Plaintiff in a manner that would deprive or tend to deprive\n\n\n\n                                                    15\n                                                                                                       513\n\fhim of any employment opportunity or adversely affect his status as an employee, including\n\nwithout limitation, unjustly demoting him to a level 5 when his manager at the time had ranked\n\nhim at a level 3, resulting in a constructive discharge.\n\n       45.        Age and/or sex and/or national origin were motivating factors m Defendant\n\nMicrosoft's treatment of Plaintiff.\n\n       46.        Such conduct constitutes unlawful employment practices in violation of the Texas\n\nCommission on Human Rights Act, including without limitation, Texas Labor Code §21.051\n\nand/or 21 .056.\n\n       47.        Plaintiff was proximately damaged as a result of the conduct of Microsoft, its\n\nagents and employees, in an amount within the jurisdictional limits of this court. Plaintiff seeks\n\nrecovery of such damages, including without limitation, the damages provided by Texas Labor\n\nCode Sec. 21.2585.\n\n                                  IX.    SEXUAL HARASSlVIENT\n\n       48.        Plaintiff adopts and incorporates by reference into this section of his petition the\n\nstatements set forth above in the Facts section as if set forth in this section. Additionally, Defendant\n\nAulds, acting within the course and scope of her employment or in a manner that makes Microsoft\n\nvicariously liable for her conduct, made sexual comments to Plaintiff about her sex life (such as\n\n\"you have ruined me for sex with my boyfriends\"), commented on her sexual relationships with her\n\nboyfriends, and insisted that Plaintiff get involved in her and her boyfriend' s relationship and\n\ndisputes, even though on several occasions Plaintiff told Aulds that it made him uncomfortable\n\nbeing told and involved in these things, and handled her relationship with Plaintiff more like a\n\n\"boyf1iend/girlfriend\" relationship rather than an employer/employee relationship.\n\n       49.        The above-described conduct of Defendant Microsoft's manager employee, Lori\n\n\n\n\n                                                   16\n                                                                                                           514\n\fAulds, was sufficiently severe and pervasive so as to alter the conditions of Plaintiffs\n\nemployment and create an abusive work environment. The accumulated effect of her repeated\n\nverbal attacks and caustic comments to and about Plaintiff (which became known to Plaintiff)\n\nundermined Plaintiffs ability to succeed at his job, and caused harm to his emotional stability\n\nand health. Such gender-based animus exhibited by Ms. Aulds to Plaintiff constitutes sexual\n\nharassment of Plaintiff in violation of his rights under the law. Defendant Microsoft knew or\n\nshould have known of the harassment and abusive work environment, yet failed to take prompt\n\nremedial action.\n\n        50.     Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Microsoft, by and through its manager employee,\n\nsexually harassed Plaintiff and created an abusive work environment for Plaintiff with malice or\n\nwith reckless indifference to the legally protected rights of Plaintiff.\n\n        51.     Such harassment proximately caused damages to Plaintiff in an amount within the\n\njurisdictional limits of this court.\n\n                                       X.       RETALIATION\n\n        52.     Plaintiff adopts and incorporates by reference into this section of his petition the\n\nstatements set forth above in the Facts section as if set forth in this section.\n\n        53.     Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Microsoft, by and through its officers, agents,\n\nservants, employees or representatives, including without limitation, Tracy Rummel, Marketing\n\nManager, Marc Pisan, Marketing Director U.S. OEM, Lori Aulds, Regional Sales Director U.S.\n\nOEM, David Tannebaum National Sales Director U.S. OEM, and Eddie O'Brien, a Vice\n\nPresident U.S. OEM instituted a campaign of retaliation against Plaintiff due to Plaintiff filing\n\nhis formal complaint against Lori Aulds, Regional Sales Director U.S. OEM, David Tannebaum\n\nNational Sales Director U.S. OEM, and Eddie O'Brien, a Vice President U.S. OEM and\n\n\n\n\n                                                    17\n                                                                                                       515\n\fexercising his rights by filing a charge of discrimination with the Austin Commission on Human\n\nRights, a branch of the Texas Commission of Human Rights, and EEOC. This retaliation\n\nincluded the filing of a bogus sexual harassment and retaliation complaint by Defendant Rummel\n\nwhile employed by Microsoft, and Microsoft causing or encouraging Tracy Rummel to file a\n\nfalse and misleading charge of sexual harassment and retaliation against Plaintiff\n\n        54.     Such conduct violates Texas Labor Code Sec. 21.055 and/or 21 .056.\n\n        55.     Such conduct proximately caused Plaintiff to suffer damages in an amount within\n\nthe jurisdictional limits of this court.\n\n                                 XI.       INVASION OF PRIVACY\n\n        56.     Plaintiff adopts and incorporates by reference into this section of his petition the\n\nstatements set forth above in the Facts section as if set forth in this section.\n\n        57.     Defendant Microsoft, by and through its officers, agents, servants, employees or\n\nrepresentatives, intentionally invaded Plaintiffs privacy by intruding on his solitude, seclusion,\n\nor private affairs. The invasion was highly offensive to Plaintiff and would be highly offensive\n\nto a reasonable person. Plaintiff was injured because of the conduct of Defendant. Plaintiff\n\nproximately suffered damages in an amount within the jurisdictional limits of this court for\n\nwhich Plaintiff herein sues.\n\n        58.     Defendant Microsoft, by and through its officers, agents, servants, employees or\n\nrepresentatives, verbally publicized facts regarding Plaintiff's private life which were not of\n\nlegitimate public concern. The publicity was highly offensive to Plaintiff and would be highly\n\noffensive to a reasonable person. Plaintiff was injured as a result of the conduct of Defendant.\n\nPlaintiff proximately suffered damages as a proximate cause and result of Defendants' actions in\n\nan amount within the jurisdictional limits of this court for which Plaintiff herein sues.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    18\n                                                                                                       516\n\f                                      Xll.    DAMAGES\n\n       59.    Plaintiff sustained the following damages or elements of damage in an amount\n\nwithin the jurisdictional limits of this court for which he seeks compensation as a result of the\n\nactions and/or omissions of Defendants described above:\n\n       a.     Back pay from the date that Plaintiff was denied equal pay for equal work, and\n              interest on the back pay, in an amount of compensation to Plaintiff as the Court\n              deems equitable and just, and/or loss of earnings in the past;\n              AND, lost income resulting from Plaintiffs constructive discharge;\n       b.     Front pay in an amount the court deems equitable and just to make Plaintiff\n              whole, and/or loss of earning capacity which will, in all reasonable probability, be\n              incutTed in the future;\n       c.     Loss of benefits, including bonuses, stock options, 401 k matching contributions\n              and any other pension plan contributions, and any profit-sharing plan\n              contributions;\n       d.     Loss of enjoyment oflife;\n       e.     Mental anguish in the past;\n       f.     Mental anguish which will , in all reasonable probability, be suffered in the future;\n       g.     Reasonable medical care and expenses in the past. These expenses were incurred\n              by Plaintiff and such charges are reasonable and were usual and customary\n              charges for such services in Travis County, Texas;\n       h.     Reasonable medical care and expenses which Plaintiff will incur, in all reasonable\n              medical probability, in the future;\n       1.     Deprivation of seclusion;\n       J.     Humiliation;\n       k.     Loss of time and Inconvenience;\n       I.     Physical discomforts; and,\n       m.     Injury to reputation.\n\n                              xm.    EXEMPLARY DAMAGES\n\n       60.    Plaintiff would further show that the acts and/or omissions of Rummel and of\n\nDefendant Microsoft, by and through its officers, agents, servants, employees or representatives,\n\nincluding Manager Lori Aulds and co-worker Tracy Rummel , which are complained of herein\n\nwere committed with malice or reckless indifference to the protected rights of the Plaintiff. In\n\norder to punish Defendants, and to deter such actions and/or omissions in the future by\n\nDefendants or anyone else, Plaintiff also seeks a recovery of exemplary damages from\n\n\n\n\n                                               19\n                                                                                                      517\n\fDefendants.\n\n                                     XIV. ATTORNEY'S FEES\n\n        62.

I escalated this to our CRM team and th is continues to be 1\ninvestigated. That said, with Joe Sahaglan's support, I re-entered data in CRM for the third time this past\nyear. I have already stated that some of my partners elected not to respond because they felt they could\nnot be truthful In the assessment of the relationship with Microsoft - some feel a sense of fear of\nreceiving punitive responses for any perceived negative feedbacic to Microsoft. Nothing I can do about\nthat except try to assure them the feectback rs vah.ied and we will change things 1f necessary. Not\nresponding doesn't help anyone. C have plenty of examples of executive engagement however, what is\ntroub llng to me 1s t hat I have Ileen cut-out of these executive engagements w ith Robert Young.}Ohns;\nKe.vin Turner etc ·this has been a source of frustrat ion but I am confident this will change now r have a\nnew manager 1n Joe Sahagian. This included the rnost recent event with the Microsoft Houston Store\nOpening - the EPG reps were Invited and I was not and Lori Aulds drove the invitation to my Top Partner\nand CEO David Altounian from Motion Computing.\n\nSince Joe came on board - I have received much more support and useful coaching and direction on key\nstrategic Issues. I have also received more inclusion with direct support from Joe and Peter Han our new\nGM. Joe and Peter have met all my partners collectively 3-4 times this year and based on the meetings I\nhave coordinated, have created great relationships with the Texas partner ecosystem.\n\nUnlike Lor• Aulds who even in her n~ role has continued to marglna'llze and confuse my partners and\nmany t imes intemal Microsoft people with her actions - Joe and Peter have been very transparent and\nsupportive in cementing my postt1on with my partners as the lead.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                       MS14285\n\fMy COS statements have been first rate with regular follow-up w1ttl my accounts and proactive CRM\nupdates - I exceeded CR~1 updating beyond what was required by the subsidiary, including post\nscorecard timeline, w ith a view to ensuring continuity and preparedness for FY 12.\n\nMy CRM quality was one of the highest on my direct tean1 and Natlonl!llly with the following statistics :\n\n     • Exceeded US Team Average Score\n     • Exceeded Direct team Average Score - only Wayne Carey and myself achieved this with the rest\n       being below team average\n     • Ranked 2nd on direct team on overall quality score\n     • Ranked 2nd on team for full completion of CRM\n\nThe level of Executive enga9ement Is extremely high with one of if not the best attendance records at\nWWPC this year.\n\n     • 100% Partner organization participation at WWPC - this is at least the 4th year I have achieved\n       thiS\n     • At time of w11.tlng this my partners contributed to:\n           • 21 %+ of the total OEM o rganrzations represented\n           • over 13% of the total people represented\n           • Motion Computing received nomination for a WW Partner Award\n           • Motion Computing received a US nomlnatio n and Award fur US l'i\"obility Partner of the Year •\n             last year they were ranked as US OEM Partner of the Year\n\nThe overall team attendanc~ numbers for WWPC overall were struggling and a change was made that\nMi crosoft would subsidize the reg tstrat.ion costs - my results were achieved prior to this decision and\nwere based on a) my positioning of the value of WWPC and b) the long term personal and professional\nrelation ships I have developed over many years. having my complete set of partners represented is a\nconsistent performance result in my territory over many consecutive years showmg consistent and\nproven capability over a number of years.\n\nThe CPE comments I received from the responders t know were excellent ~ once again this is consistent\nand shows another element of my long term proven capabilities in this category.\n\n\nOptional Manager comment on Emptovee Results against this Commitment\nMichael d id not achieve this commitment, as he did not meet the accountability of 50% poll par ticipation\nin FY1 l. His partner partici pation was at 36%, the lowest on the team, this demonstrates a lack of effort.\nThe poll participation goal for FY12 is going to oe significantly higher and he will need to put more time\nand effort into driving higher poll participation numbers. As a team we achieved our NSAT goal of 151\nwhich 1s the highest it's been in many years. Michael's Condition of Satisfaction statements needed\nimprovernent in Hl, but he showed noted improvements in H2 on his wri tten conditions of satisfaction\nstatements in CRM.

In doing so, Michael was one of only a few people who\nmiSsed two product groups in FYl 1. Client revenue was at 110'% of target, 0 ffice Revenue was at 72 %\nof target and Server Revenue was at 76% ofta19et. Each individual component of his Revenue\ncommitrttent is as important as the overall attainment number. Michael has met or exceeded all four\nquarterly accountabilities in FYll and as noted has done this lbr eight straight quarters. The expectation\nof the entire team is to hit their overall btJ.dget, meet all revenue targets with regards to product groups\nand to meet quarter1y accountabilities.

He has also been involved with helping to shape tt1e\nStorytelling course from Mandel Communication. Michael kept his T&E Expenses In line with budget.\nMichael successfully met all the accountabilities of this commitment.\n\n\n\nOverall Performance\n\nEmployee Overall Performance Summary; Summarize your results against commitments and\nhow you demonstrated your ability to collaborate across boundaries, impact and influence\nothers, and e.xhibit I nterpersonal awareness and confidenc,e. In addition to these core\ncompet-encies, include how you demonstrated ~nv other profession-related competencies\nthat were key to your deliverables.\n HID YEAR SUMMARY;\n The past semester has been good from a re\\lenue perspective - consistent over budget performance -\n 6 consecutive quarters with a goal for 7 and 8 thiS fiscal year. My relationships across mv partners 1s\n excellent - with mutual respect and appreciation on a very deep level. This performance has been\n achieved despite the negativity and marg'ioalization by my management team - Joe Sahagian is an\n exception to this. I have had a 12-15 month issue with my organtzatlon that has included an Internal\n Investigation and now an external escalation and formal romplain t to the Texas Commission for\n Human Rights and the EEOC - Microsoft has been made aware of this at the highest levels. This has\n been a source of great pressure and distraction for me yet t continue to perform and bring in my\n revenues; nurture strong relationships and put my partners; customers; and Microsoft overall first.\n\n l want to confirm that my current manager, Joe Sahagian, is not a part of this negativity and given\n the circumstances I believe he has been a breath of fresh air and integrity in this leadership team\n which has shown itself to tack core values espoused by Microsoft In our Standards of Business\n Conduct. Even in his short tenure he has shown me tremendous support in          mv\n                                                                                  account activities and\n he reminds me of the time when Microsoft encoura9ed us to think big and believe io our core values\n and operate as a true trusting team.\n\n Mtcrosoft would do welt to increase Joe's responsib.lliUes and span of control and sphere of\n influence. He has a great gift of strong Emotional and IntElligence Quotients. He reminds me of Barry\n Ridgway and Phil Sorgen 10 terms of his management style and understands the business.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                           MS1.4292\n\fHe epitomizes walking the walk and not just using rhetori: as a punch-line but as a standard and\ncode to execute.\n\nThis is my MYCO but these are important factors tnat I feel passionately about and have a direct\nimpact on both mine and the teams OHI and ability to execute on our overall commitments. I still\nbelieve ttlat M1crosott, the company, stands for something grecst. What I am uncomfortable with is the\ngulf bet ween our code and values and execution of them.\n\nFULL '££AR SUMMARY\n\nAnother successful year with the following accomplishments:\n\n   • Excellent performance across the year for all my commitments ·always room for improvement\n     as I strive and aspire to perfection in all aspects of what l do\n   • My app ro acn has been positive and driven and despite the lack of sup port and roadblocks from\n     Mlerosoft management,(excludm9 Joe Saha90o),and the constant undenninlog and\n     marginallzatlon of my partner reiationsnips, my terrttorv operates extremely effectively and the\n     partner reiationshlps and CPE are superb although even my partners sense things are not eight.\n   • I hold myself to the h1gh~st standards and whilst I am the first to say I can always improve as\n     that is in rny nature, l also know that I have performed consistently and hi9tlly with integrity\n     and passion and fully supporting Microsoft's initiatives and being supportive of my management\n     team in Joe.\n   • J operate as a positive team ~ayer making myself avail<1ble to anyone in any team in any\n     d iv1s10n in any country l have a plethora of examples of th is m my career and in the past year\n     Including self funding a trip to support a Microsolt partner in need.\n\nAher Mid year I was placed on a weekly perfurmance review with my manager, which is an indicatiOn\nthat I am being given unwarranted extra scrutiny which r see as continued harassment and\nunwarranted focus based on my past and current formal complaints and following legal actions. rn\nshort this retaliatory by Microsoft and not only contrary to internal policy but 1s Illegal.\n\nThis request for additional reviews was based on my first semester performance as it was MYCD so I\nam confident that Joe Sahagian was not part of th is process and that it was mandated by\nmanagement and/or HR. T ht! request was based on 3 elements which r had already raised as areas of\nfocus proactively to Improve upon, (that does not mean they were bad or bad relative to the team),\nthey were just areas to increase performance as one can always look lO improve ones performance.\n\n1'hese wEre then used against me whicti I find perplexing and deeply upsetting- these areas were\nProduct Group performa nee; l m bedded Scorecard and CRM.\n\nAt Mid-year I have found on further scrutiny that more than one person did not m€et criteria in these\nareas as well as mysetf. One Individuals performance included:\n\n   • ~aving lower Embedded Scorecard performance than myself\n   • My CRM score exceeded team commitment level · th1~ individuals was no better at that point\n   • This person had only made 1/3 Product 9roups like myself the one he made was not client\n     (the bi99est number and mine was); also my IW number was incorrect -see above\n   • fhe individual posted tile LOWEST revenue number by MYCO an<J was b~low 71% of bud~t\n   • Hits was a a>ntinuat1on of poor revenue performance ashed kl not make budget (1 of only 2\n     reps) in a launch year fiscal f\"Y 10 when everyone else made and exceeded quota.\n\nI have to thf!n hypotheslTe that a) this individual was receiving special concessions and/orb) I was\nreceiving unnecessary and unwarranted negative focus as a rct~liatory measure to \"build\" a case\nagainst me. In short, why was I placed on weekly performance reviews and this individual was not\ndespite his poorer performance record and trending and over budget expense spendin9?\n\nDespite the negativity; hara~sment; the uncomfortable and untenable environment that forced me to\nelect to worl< from home and the ever increasing negative pre~sure and additional workload review\n\n\n                                                                                                       MS14293\n\frequirements placed oo myself, I have still chosen to rise above this ant:: put Microsoft; Partners;\nCustomers and my colleagues first and continue to drive attainment in llne and often in excess of\ncommitment levels.\n\nWhilst not perfect, ( I will and always will continue to strive fbr that level), I will not allow the\ndetractors to sway my performance to a negative route - I am paid by Microsoft to manage a\nbusiness and all the previously mentioned teams and individuals rely on that perfonnaoce.\n\nDespite unilaterally not being given any leadership projects th is year by the management team, l\ncontinue to operate as a leader and in line with our Standards of Business Conduct highlighting to my\nmanager and GM when others (Directors' and above) have not. I take my role extremely seriously\nand see myself as an ambassador of Microsoft in everyt,in9 I do 24/7.\n\nI have almost completed 18 years at Microsoft and I continue to execute my responsibilities\ndiligently; consistently and with comp;,ssion and integrity and with a high degree of business acumen.\nMy consistency and proven capabilities over each role In almost two decades and in this role, despite\nthe toxic environment that I find myself in, - have been nothing short of assiduous and I am\nconfident that should Microsoft in thiS review and beyond tlnd otherwise, that the investigations and\ninformation that will continue to ring information to light mme to light will fully support my excellent\nrecord of proven performance and cap.abilities.\n\nTo my manager Joe Sahagian I will formally go on record in thanking him for managing this delieate\nsituation with integrity and poise and a hi9h degree of professionalism wtlieh from my experience of\nhim over the years is of no surprise.\n\n\n\n\nManager's Overatl Performance Assessment: Summarize both the employee's results\nagainst commitments, and how weU this employee demonstrated an ability to collaborate\nacross boundaries, impact and influence others, and exhibit interpersonal awareness and\nconfidence. tn addition to these core competencies, indude any other profession-related\ncompetenc:ies that were key to hrs or her deliverable5. When asseHing overall performance\ncon5ider the. environmenl in which results were achieved and the impact of perlormanca\nrelative to peers. •summari~e the employee's proven cctpability based on a longer-term\ndemonstrated history of taking on more chatlenging work while continuing to deliver resu9ls\n(*proven capability is not applicable for an employee's first review at MS).\nMichael, you did a good job meeting each of your all up revenue quarterly accountabilities, as an\naccount manager, this is very important. Another area that you showed solid performance was\naround driving WWPC attendance and across being an alpha tester on our FRI murses. Some\ncommitment areas where you need to stay focused on in FY12 are meeting all of your Product\nGroups, driving better poll participation and keeping your plans In CRM up to date with quahty short\nand long term goals and objectives. You atso have done a good job of staying in front of the trends\nwithin your business especially as it relates to Motion Computing and Xplore Technologies tablet\nopportunities and chal1enges.\nDespite some of the above areas of success, there are number of areas where you dia oot achieve\nyour commitments and I expect to see consistent and sustained improv~ment. An area for\ndevelopment and opportunity around Microsoft competencies is product and technok:>gy expertise.\nManaging our largest tablet partner provlde:s the opportunity for yo1J to bring real time Intelligence\nback to the broader team around compete and competitive trends within the market place. Another\narea of development is cross group collaboration. Over the past year you have not been able to\ngenerate support from others. Feed back - both verbal and from the feedback tool -- indicates that\nothers are having trouble partnering with you. You have engaged with others in a way that makes\nthen not want to partner with you. How you perform your job is just as critical as your end\nresults. Your inability to partner with your team is not good for our internal team dynamics, external\nteam dynamics and customers.\nFlnafly, I note that your overall self·assessmmt contalr.s spec..i atlon and hypothesis about other\nemployees. Again, this is not appropriate content for your annual review. You also suggest that the\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                           MS14294\n\fperformance coaching we- have worked on over the last year iS rE'taliatory 10 some way. I can assure\nyou tl'\\at 1 talce the development of employees very seriously, alld that r initiated this action as a way\nto help yo1.. improve both the \"what\" and \"howH of your performance.

HR inslrUcted Tracy to raise her concerns with her\n                 employer. HR followed up with the CS employer and the CS employer informed HR that Tracy\n                 did not wish to raise concerns or proceed with an investigation. 1\n\n                 On February 23, 2010, Michael contacted his HRBP, Micky Shields, and stated that he wished to\n                 raise a \"fonnal complaint\" regarding actions in November 2009 related to Tracy Rummel. His\n                 contact with Micky followed a 1: l with the subject, Lori Aulds, in which Lori revealed to\n                 Michael that Tracy had raised concerns about him in November 2009. A number of calls/emails\n                 between Micky and Michael followed that initial contact.\n                 On March 26, 2010, Michael was intcrViewed by ER.IT at Micky's request in order to better\n                 wtderstand his concerns. Michael's coi:icems in th.at interview focused on the fact that\n                 allegations were raised against him by Tracy to his manager's attention and that his management\n                 chain was aware of the allegation. Michael did not raise any concerns regarding discrimination\n                 because of gender and/or national origin and Michael did not raise any concerns regarding sexual\n\n\n                 1\n                   The CS employee, Tracy Rummel. was hired 3S a Microsoft FTE on February lS, 2010.

Michael also alleged\n\n\n\n\n•\n    that when Lori applied for the open manager position on his team in 2007 she requested he not\n    mention their past relationship to the hiring manager, Megan Both. He stated that there was \"no\n    upside for me in mentioning it [past relationship}\" to Megan so \"I kept my mouth shut and did\n    my job.\" He stated that '·Megan called me and I said she was a good hire.\" In support of the\n    past romantic relationship, Michael provided voicemails, photographs and additional evidence\n    from 2002.\n    Lori initially denied that she and Michael had ever been romantically involved in the past. She\n    stated that they were friends a:id would go out together and travel together but th.at there was no\n    sexual relationship. During a subsequent interview in Austin, Texas I showed the evidence\n    provided by Michael and Lori then admitted to the past romantic relationship. She stated that\n    she spoke to Michael when applying for the job in 2007 and that he was supportive and had no\n    concerns. She said that Michael told her not to reveal the past romantic relationship to Megan\n    and that. since becoming his manager) \"I have been very careful to maintain a professional\n    distanct: so there would be no misunderstanding.\"\n\n    Witness/Both and documentary evidence corroborated that Michael was supportive ofTracy~s\n    hiring as his manager in 2007. Witness/Both stated that Michael called her and said th.at Lori\n    was a \"great person and a great hire.\" Following his call with Witness/Both, Michael sent an\n    email to Lori on July 2, 2007 detailing the call and including statements by him: \"I WOULD\n    HrRE YOU\" and \"I would be bappy to work for you.\"\n\n    The investigation revealed docwnentary evidence that corroborated Michael's allegation of a\n    past romantic relationship between him and Lori prior to her becoming his manager in 2007.\n    When confronted with documentary evidence, Lori admitted the past romantic relationship. The\n\n\n\n\n•                                                                                                         MS37857\n\finvestigation also revealed documentary evidence and witness evidence that Michael was\nsupportive of Lori's hiring and that neither Lori nor Michael revealed the past romantic\nrelationship to the hiring manager in 2007.\n                                                                                                                           •\nAlleged Unwelcome Gpnduct\n\nOn August 11, 20 I0, Michael alleged that he had been sexually harassed by Lori since she\nbecame his manager in 2007. Michael spedfically denied any sexual advances by Lori or any\npressure by Lori to return to their past romantic relationship while she has been his manager. He\nidentified her harassment as unwelcome verbal conduct, including: Lori alluding to their past\nromantic relationship in I: ls~ Lori making a statement regarding their past sexual relationship to\nMichael at his cubicle; Lori asking Michael to \"mediate\" her relationship with another man; Lori\nasking Michael to go out dancing; and Lori threatening his job if he revealed their past romantic\nrelationship. When questioned, Michael did confirm that he never raised any of these concerns\nto HR until speaking with ERlT on August 11, 2010 and that he had provided positive feedback\nregarding her management of him and the team.\n\nLori responded to the allegation of sexual harassment by denying that she acted inappropriately\ntowards Michael. She specifically denied alluding to their past romantic relationships in 1:ls,\nmaking a statement regarding their past sexual relationship, or threatening Michael's job if he\nrevealed their past relationship. She denied asking Michael to go out dancing after she became\nhis manager as she wished to keep their relationship strictly professional. Lori confirmed that\nMichael did intervene in a 2008 domestic issue between her and her ex-boyfriend, Chris Kelly.\nShe stated that she did not want th.at to happen but that she shared information with Michael\nregarding problems in her relationship and that Michael \"wanted to be protector\" and voluntarily\ncontacted Chris and met with him al her home. Lori stated th.at \"l never shared anything with\nMichael'' after that occurrence. Lori provided documentary evidence, including emails and h.is\nWHI scores for her in FY09 (sent directly to her by Michael), where Michael praised her work as\nhis manager. ·\n                                                                                                                               •\nWitness/Thompson has worked closely with Lori and Michael in the Austin office since Lori\nbecame Michael's manager. He noted a professional and congenial working relationship\nbetween Michael and Lori through begiruring of FY 10 that included the three of them often\ngoing to lunch together. He observed no discomfort by either Lori or Michael and noted ''they\nhave knoY.n each other for a long time.>'\nWitnesses and documentary evidence did not corToborate Michael's assertion that Lori alluded to\ntheir past romantic relationship in 1: 1s, made a statement regarding their past sex.ual relationship\nat his cubicle, asked him to go out dancing (as his manager), or threatened ttis job if he revealed\ntheir past romantic relationshlp. Documentary evjdence did corroborate that Michael voluntarily\ninvolved himself in Lori's domestic issues with her ex-boyfriend and that Lori permitted that to\noccur.\nThe investigation revealed there was a close personal (non-romantic) friendship between Lori\n                                                   4\nand Michael after she became his manager in 2007. The investigation did not find evidence\n\n4\n For example, in illl email dated October 2, 2008, Michael stated to Lori: \"I have dropped everything when you had\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                               •\nyour problems with Chris whatever times of the day or night and come over and called you to check on you-when\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                     MS37858\n\f•   supporting the unwelcome verbal conduct by Lori cited by Michael in support of his allegation\n    of sexual harassment. lbe comments related to the past romantic/sexual relationship were\n    denied by Lori and there were no witnesses/documentary evidence corrnborating them. Also,\n    Michael's involvement in Lori's domestic issue appeared voluntary on his pa.rt.\n\n    Analysis and Conclusion\n\n    Although Lori and Michael did have a past romantic relationship in 2002 and a close personal\n    (non-romantic) friendship that deteriorated in FYlO, I did not find support for Michael's\n    allegation that he was sexually harassed by Lori. There are a number of factors that led to this\n    conclusion: Michael supported Lori's hiring as his manager in 2007 and conununicated that\n    support to the hiring manager; Michael praised Lori's management in emails and in the FY09\n    WHI poll in contradiction of his subsequent allegation; Witnessffhompson observed a\n    professional and congenial working relationship between Lori and Michael since Lori became\n    Michael's manager and no discomfort on the part of Michael; and Michael did not raise this\n    allegation or inform HR of the past romantic relationship until after he was identified as a subject\n    in an ERIT investigation alleging sexual harassment and after issuc:s were raised by Lori about\n    his performance thereby raising significant question regarding his motive. Therefore> based on\n    tbe totality of the evidence, I do not find that Lori's treatment of Michael violated Microsoft's\n    Anti-Harassment and Anti-Discrimination Policy.\n\n    I do find that Lori exercised extremely poor judgment as a manager.

Regarding the specific examples above that Michael\n        identified, subjects, witnesses and documentary evidence indicated the following:\n        Lori confirmed that she and Michael did not have regular l :ls scheduled on their calendars. She\n        stated, and witnesses and documentation corroborated, that she and Michael had a close working\n        relationship in the Austin office and that the two of them would meet for l: 1s to discuss\n        Michael's business often on an ad hoc basis or at lunch.\n\n        Subjects stated, and witnesses and documentation corroborated, that Michael has not been\n        included on some communication with his partner, Motion Computing. Subjects explained, and\n        witnesses and docwnentation corroborated, that this was due to ( 1) the fact that Lori is leading\n        the US OEM's high·level Apple Compete Strategy that involves Motion. as well as other\n        Microsoft partners not assigned to Michael and (2) the fact that Michael was on vacation for\n        much of June/July 2010 when this Apple Compete Strategy \"heated up'' and required\n        conununication with Motion. Subjects also seated, and documentation and witnesses\n        corroborated, the meeting between Robert Youngjohns and the CEO of Motion was focused on\n\n\n\n•       the Apple Compete Strategy and that Robert prefers smaller meetings.\n        Lori and David stated, and documentation corroborated, that Michael initially communicated to\n        them that he would not be attending WPC because of low partner attendance. They stated> and\n        documentation corroborated, that Michael ultimately could not attend V.'PC because it conflicted\n        with the only available dates that he could attend in~person BPOS training (due to his vacation\n        schedule in July 2010.) Lori stated, and documentation corroborated, that she did not cut\n        Michael's T & E budget in FYlO.\n\n        Derogatory Comments\n\n        Michael alleged that at an offshe Eddie seated \"I'll get my friends in the IRA to blow up France.\"\n        He stated that lhe commented offended him because his mother's name is French. Eddie denied\n        the conunent and no -wimesses present at the offsite, including lhe HR.BP (Witness/Shields),\n        corroborated it.\n        Michael also alleged that Eddie sent an organization-wide email titled \"2 Females Promoted to\n        Director\". He stated lhat email offended rum because Eddie's organi1,ation does not designate\n        when men are promoted. Edcie confinned lhe email and noted that he received coachlng after\n        sending it that such email announcements should be more balanced. further, the organization\n        has announced other promotions of individuaJs by name via email. the email could be hurtful to\n        both men and women in his organization.\n        Analvsis and Conclusion\n\n\n\n\n•                                                                                                            MS37863\n\fThe investigation did not reveal sufficient evidence supporting MichaePs allegation of\ndiscrimination by the subjects because of his gender or national origin. First, Micha.el provided\nno corroborating witnesses or evidence that the treatment he received from subjects was related\nto either his gender or national origin. Second, there was a legitimate basis for the subjects'\n                                                                                                                          •\nmanagement of Michael in terms of career discussions, coaching and feedback on corroborated\ndeficiencies in performance. Third, many of the items identified by Michael as discrimination\nwere legitimate business/management decisions made by the subjects that he simply disagreed\nwith. Fourth, many of the examples of llllfair treaunent by the subjects cited by Michael were\ncontradicted by the interviews and documentary evidence. Finally, Michael had previously\nidentified Tracy RwnmePs allegations in November 2009 against him as the catalyst for his\ntreatment by the subjects and it was not W1til he was notified. of the ERIT investigation in May\n20 l 0 that he raised his allegations of discrimination.6\n\nBased on the foregoing, I find that the evidence does not support Michael's aJlegation that his\ngender or national origin was/is a factor in the subjects' treatment of him. Accordingly, I did not\nfind that the subjects' treatment ofMichael violated Microsoft's Anti-Harassment and Anti-\nDi.scrimination Policy.\n\n Allegation: Retaliation under Microsoft,s Anti-Harassment & Anti-Discrimination Policy\n-Unsupported\n\nMichael also alleged that Lori, David Tannenbaum, and Eddie O'Brien had retaliated against\nhim for raising a discrimination allegation against them and for participating in this ERIT\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                              •\ninvestigation. ln support of this allegation, Michael cited the following:\n\n    •    Feedback in FYlO Review\n    •    Rewards in FY10 Review\n\nFeedback in FY I 0 Review:\n\nMichael alleged that the subjects had retaliated against him by highlighting only\n\"critical/negative\" foedback in his review !hat wa.c; not substantiated and never raised in 1:ls or\nin MYCD.

Michael highlighted that a colleague\n          reporting to Lori, Michael Warren, was awarded equivalent or higher CBUSlock awards despite\n          having missed his quota.\n\n          Subjects denied that they retaliated against Michael in regards to his FYI 0 rewards. Regarding\n          CBI, subjects stated, and witnesses and documentation corroborated> that there were additional\n          factors weighed besides quota attainment that went into the assessment of PA Ms in David's\n          organization and Michael scored the lowest of all P AMs in David's organization. Subjects\n          stated, and documentation corroborated., that there were significant issues related to Michael\n          Warren•s business that resulted in adjustment of his quota attainment to 99% and Michael\n          Warren did better than Michael in other factors weighed by subjects when assessing P AMs in\n          David's organization. Regarding Stock award, subjects stated, and witnesses and documentation\n          corroborated, that Michact•s length of time in role, corroborated deficiencies, and documented\n          concerns around the UPC project were considered when assessing his contribution ranking at\n          bottom 70% on con!ributioo - thereby resulting in lower stock award.\n\n          Analysis and Conclusion\n\n          The investigation did not reveal sufficient evidence supporting Michael's allegation of retaliation\n          by subjects.

We are executing well,\n    capitalizing on the growth in the PC market and the launch of Win 7 thus\n    making outslanding traction on attach and revenue while making very strong\n    progress on CPE & OHi.\n\n\n\n    US OEM is driving hard to build on the Windows 7 momentum to drive share and\n    premium mix as part of our overall compete strategy against Apple, Google\n    and Linux. Some of owr key objectives are 1) to land Windows on all PCs\n    and new form factors; 2) capture the Corporate refresh opportunity; 3} Land\n    Professional on business PCs; 4) Land Windows 7 Starter on Netbooks; 5)\n    Ensure Office 2010 Starter image is on all PCs and 6) Lend Windows Live Wave\n    4 and Bing are on as many PCs as possible and 7) continue to grow Server\n    Attach.\n\n\n\n    Two roles that are critical to achieving these goals are 1) how we Operate\n    Sales and manage the Business overall to drive attach and 2) how we engage\n    with our Verticals and Named Accounts. In light of this I am very pleased to\n    announce the promotions of Lori Aulds to Director Named and Vertical and\n    Jeannine Borgen to Director Sales Operations and Business Management to\n    assist in driving these key efforts.\n\n\n\n\n•   Lori has played a critical role in enabling the team to drive 182% of budget\n    and 17% YoY growth in our Named Business as Group Manager for tile West\n    Region.
