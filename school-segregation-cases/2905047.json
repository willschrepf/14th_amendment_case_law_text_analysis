Factual and Procedural Background\n\n       Plaintiffs are a proposed class of shareholders of mutual\nfunds managed by Lord, Abbett & Co. LLC (Lord Abbett). On\nFebruary 9, 2004, they filed this lawsuit against Lord Abbett and\nLord Abbett Distributor LLC, the investment adviser and\ndistributor of the Lord Abbett mutual funds.1 Following the\nconsolidation of multiple related cases, plaintiffs filed a\n\n\n  1\n      A number of other defendants are no longer in the case.\n\n                                4\n\fConsolidated Amended Class Action Complaint on August 16,\n2004.\n\n        In their Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint,\nplaintiffs alleged (among other misdeeds) that Lord Abbett\ncharged its existing investors excessive fees that were\nimproperly used to pay brokers to market Lord Abbett funds to\nother investors. Plaintiffs claimed that Lord Abbett was\nmotivated to charge excessive fees because its management fees\nwere based on the amount of assets being managed – as the\nnumber of investors grew so did the assets – and so did the fees.\nPlaintiffs alleged violations of both federal and state law,\nincluding violations of Sections 36(b) and 48(a) of the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940, brought on behalf of the\nproposed class, and four state law counts, also brought on behalf\nof the class.\n\n        Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, based in part on the\nground that plaintiffs’ action was pre-empted by SLUSA, 15\nU.S.C. § 78bb(f). As we recently explained in LaSala v. Border\net Cie., 519 F.3d 121, 127-28 (3d Cir. 2008), SLUSA was\nenacted as a supplement to the Private Securities Litigation\nReform Act of 1995, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77z-1, 78u-4 (PSLRA or\nReform Act). Congress enacted the PSLRA to prevent the filing\nof “strike suits” – abusive class actions which are brought with\nthe hope that the expense of litigation may force defendants to\nsettle despite the actions’ lack of merit. In Congress’s view,\nsuch actions “unnecessarily increase the cost of raising capital\nand chill corporate disclosure . . .. ” S. Rep. 104-98 (1995),\nreprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. 679, 683. The PSLRA imposed\n\n\n                                5\n\fa number of requirements on federal securities litigation\nplaintiffs, designed to deter such frivolous suits.2\n\n        In reaction to the rigors of the PSLRA, plaintiffs began\nfiling cases in state courts under less strict state securities laws.\nCongress then enacted SLUSA, stating that\n\n        [I]n order to prevent certain State private\n        securities class action lawsuits alleging fraud\n        from being used to frustrate the objectives of the\n        Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,\n        it is appropriate to enact national standards for\n        securities class action lawsuits involving\n\n\n    2\n     In particular, the PSLRA imposed heightened pleading\nrequirements in fraud cases brought under Section 10(b) of the\nExchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78j, and SEC Rule 10b-5. The\nPSLRA requires that plaintiffs plead misleading statements\n“with particularity,” 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(1), plead facts\ncreating a “strong inference” of scienter, 15 U.S.C. § 78u-\n4(b)(2), and prove loss causation, 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(4). The\nPSLRA also “limit[s] recoverable damages and attorney’s fees,\nprovide[s] a ‘safe harbor’ for forward-looking statements,\nimpose[s] new restrictions on the selection of (and\ncompensation awarded to) lead plaintiffs, mandate[s] imposition\nof sanctions for frivolous litigation, and authorize[s] a stay of\ndiscovery pending resolution of any motion to dismiss.” Merrill\nLynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Dabit, 547 U.S. 71, 81\n(2006) (Dabit II) (citing 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4); see also 15 U.S.C.\n§ 78u-5.\n\n                                 6\n\f      nationally traded securities, while preserving the\n      appropriate enforcement powers of State\n      securities regulators and not changing the current\n      treatment of individual lawsuits.\n\nSLUSA, S. 1260, 105th Cong. § 2(5), 112 Stat. 3227. The\nSLUSA Conference Report explains that\n\n      [S]ince passage of the Reform Act, plaintiffs’\n      lawyers have sought to circumvent the Act’s\n      provisions by exploiting differences between\n      Federal and State laws by filing frivolous and\n      speculative lawsuits in State court, where\n      essentially none of the Reform Act’s procedural\n      or substantive protections against abusive suits\n      are available. . . . [A] single state can impose the\n      risks and costs of its peculiar litigation system on\n      all national issues. The solution to this problem is\n      to make Federal court the exclusive venue for\n      most securities fraud class action litigation\n      involving nationally traded securities.\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 105-803, at 14-15 (1998) (Conf. Rep.) (internal\nquotation omitted).\n\n      Accordingly, SLUSA barred certain class actions and\nmass actions from state courts, providing in relevant part:\n\n      No covered class action based upon the\n      statutory or common law of any State\n      or subdivision thereof may be maintained\n\n                               7\n\f      in any State or Federal court by any private\n      party alleging –\n\n             (A) a misrepresentation or omission\n             of a material fact in connection\n             with the purchase or sale of a\n             covered security; or\n\n             (B) that the defendant used or\n             employed any manipulative or\n             deceptive device or contrivance in\n             connection with the purchase or\n             sale of a covered security.\n\n15 U.S.C. § 78bb(f)(1). Under SLUSA, a “covered class action”\nbrought in state court may be removed to federal court and is\nsubject to the above limitations. 15 U.S.C. § 78bb(f)(2).\n\n      SLUSA defines the term “covered class action” as:\n\n      (i) any single lawsuit in which –\n\n             (I) damages are sought on\n             behalf of more than 50\n             persons or prospective class\n             members, and questions of\n             law or fact common to those\n             persons or members of the\n             prospective class, without\n             reference to issues of\n             individualized reliance on\n\n                              8\n\f       an alleged misstatement or\n       omission, predominate over\n       any questions affecting only\n       ind ividual pe rsons or\n       members; or\n\n       (II) one or more named\n       parties seek to recover\n       damages on a representative\n       basis on behalf of\n       them selv e s a n d othe r\n       unnamed parties similarly\n       situated, and questions of\n       law or fact common to those\n       persons or members of the\n       prospective         class\n       predominate over any\n       questions affecting only\n       individua l p e r sons or\n       members; or\n\n(ii) any group of lawsuits filed in or\npending in the same court and\ninvolving common questions of law\nor fact, in which –\n\n       (I) damages are\n       sought on behalf of\n       more than 50\n       persons; and\n\n\n                          9\n\f              (II) the lawsuits are joined,\n              consolidated, or otherwise\n              proceed as a single action\n              for any purpose.\n\n15 U.S.C. § 78bb(f)(5)(B).\n\n        SLUSA is frequently described as “pre-empting” state-\nlaw claims. However, as the Supreme Court has explained,\nSLUSA does not actually “pre-empt” such claims; it merely\n“denies plaintiffs the right to use the class-action device to\nvindicate certain claims.” Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &\nSmith, Inc. v. Dabit, 547 U.S. 71, 87 (2006) (Dabit II).\nPlaintiffs retain the right to bring such a claim as an individual\nstate-law claim or federal securities fraud class action claim.\nLaSala, 519 F.3d at 129.\n\n        On August 30, 2005, the District Court dismissed the four\nstate claims pled in plaintiffs’ Consolidated Amended Class\nAction Complaint as pre-empted by SLUSA. 3 The District\nCourt also dismissed the remaining federal claims for failure to\nstate a claim. With respect to plaintiffs’ claims for violations of\nSections 36(b) and 48(a) of the Investment Company Act of\n1940, the District Court determined that there is no direct cause\nof action under Section 36(b), which was a predicate for the\n\n\n\n  3\n   The District Court issued an amended order and opinion on\nDecember 28, 2005. In re Lord Abbett Mut. Funds Fee Litig.,\n407 F. Supp. 2d 616 (D.N.J. 2005).\n\n                                10\n\fSection 48(a) claim, and dismissed those claims without\nprejudice.\n\n       Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint on\nSeptember 29, 2005, asserting only two derivative claims\nalleging violations of Sections 36(b) and 48(a) of the Investment\nCompany Act. In general, plaintiffs alleged that Lord Abbett\nhad received excessive management fees from its investors,\nprimarily because it had failed to pass along the benefits of the\neconomies of scale achieved as the funds grew.\n\n        Meanwhile, on September 14, 2005, defendants moved\nfor reconsideration of the District Court’s decision to dismiss\nthe claims without prejudice, in part on the grounds that SLUSA\nrequires dismissal of the entire action not merely dismissal of\nthe improper state law securities claims. Without reaching the\nissue, the District Court denied the motion as lacking sufficient\ngrounds for reconsideration but subsequently granted the\ndefendants leave to brief the issue for de novo consideration.\nAccordingly, on May 3, 2006, defendants filed a motion to\ndismiss the Second Amended Complaint pursuant to SLUSA.4\n\n\n  4\n   On February 21, 2006, defendants filed a motion to dismiss\non the grounds that (1) plaintiffs’ claims were time barred under\nthe one-year look back period of Section 36(b)(3), and they\ncontain no relevant allegations addressing the relevant time\nframe; (2) section 17 of the Investment Company Act prohibits\nplaintiffs from bringing a common action on behalf of multiple\nLord Abbett funds; (3) plaintiffs failed to state a claim under\nSection 36(b) of the Investment Advisers Act; and (4) section\n\n                               11\n\f       The District Court granted the motion and dismissed the\nSecond Amended Complaint with prejudice on December 4,\n2006. The District Court referred to our opinion in Rowinski v.\nSalomon Smith Barney Inc., 398 F.3d 294 (3d Cir. 2005), where,\nin response to the plaintiffs’ argument that the court should\nexamine each count separately to determine whether it should be\npre-empted, we noted in dictum:\n\n       [W]e question whether preemption of certain\n       counts and remand of others is consistent with the\n       plain meaning of SLUSA. The statute does not\n       preempt particular ‘claims’ or ‘counts’ but rather\n       preempts ‘actions,’ 15 U.S.C. § 78bb(f)(1),\n       suggesting that if any claims alleged in a covered\n       class action are preempted, the entire action must\n       be dismissed.\n\nId. at 305. As the District Court acknowledged, we did not\nreach this issue in Rowinski because in that case the plaintiff had\nincorporated pre-empted state-law allegations into every count\nof his complaint. Id. 5 However, the District Court found\n\n\n\n36(b) does not apply to 12b-1 fees. This motion was briefed by\nthe parties, but the District Court never ruled on it.\n  5\n   Citing Rowinski and the District Court’s opinion in this case,\nthe Tenth Circuit recently dismissed an entire complaint as pre-\nempted under SLUSA where the plaintiffs had incorporated\ntheir general class allegations into each of their claims, each of\nwhich was based on state law. Anderson v. Merrill Lynch,\n\n                                12\n\fRowinski “helpful” in that it “provide[d] strong support, albeit\nin dicta, for the proposition that SLUSA preempts entire class\nactions rather than individual claims.” 6\n\n       The District Court then turned to the statutory language.\nThe District Court noted that, by its own terms, SLUSA pre-\nemption applies to any “covered class action,” which is in turn\ndefined as “any single lawsuit” or “group of lawsuits,” and\nconcluded that this language reflects Congress’s intent to\nregulate entire lawsuits. The District Court reasoned further that\nCongress has used the word “claim” or “claims” elsewhere in\nthe securities laws, including in the PSLRA, and that Congress\n\n\n\nPierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 521 F.3d 1278, 1287 n.6 (10th\nCir. 2008). As such, the Tenth Circuit did not have to decide\n“whether, in another action, SLUSA would permit the\npreclusion of certain claims and the remand of others.” Id.\n  6\n   The District Court similarly cited the U.S. District Court for\nthe District of New Jersey’s holding in LaSala v. Bordier et\nCie., 452 F. Supp. 2d 575 (D.N.J. 2006), in which the district\ncourt dismissed Swiss law claims that incorporated by reference\nand were clearly tied to the allegations supporting the state law\nsecurities claims. We reversed, noting that “by its terms\n[SLUSA] only affects claims based upon the laws of a state or\nterritory of the United States.” LaSala v. Bordier et Cie., 519\nF.3d 121, 143 (3d Cir. 2008). We did not have to reach the\nquestion presented here, however, namely “[w]hether a single\noffending claim requires dismissal of the entire action . . ..” Id.\nat 129 n.6.\n\n                                13\n\fpresumably would have used a narrower term than “action” if it\nintended otherwise.\n\n        The District Court acknowledged that the Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit had addressed the present issue\nin Dabit v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 395\nF.3d 25 (2d Cir. 2005) (Dabit I), holding that SLUSA does not\nrequire the dismissal of an entire case where only some of the\nclaims are improper state law claims under SLUSA.7 In Dabit\nI, the court acknowledged that SLUSA’s provisions might be\nread as prohibiting maintenance of an entire action that includes\npre-empted state-law allegations. 395 F.3d at 47. The court,\nhowever, declined to hold that SLUSA operated in this manner,\nreasoning that,\n\n       On this reading, SLUSA would effectively\n       preempt any state law claim conjoined in a given\n       case with a securities fraud claim, whatever its\n       nature. We assume, however, that the historic\n       police powers of the states are not preempted\n       unless it was Congress’s ‘clear and manifest\n       purpose’ to do so.\n\n\n\n\n  7\n   The Second Circuit subsequently reiterated its holding that\nSLUSA does not require dismissal of an entire action that\nincludes only some pre-empted claims in a non-precedential\nopinion. Gray v. Seaboard Secs., Inc., 126 Fed. Appx. 14, 16\n(2d Cir. Mar. 9, 2005).\n\n                               14\n\fId. (quoting City of Milwaukee v. Illinois, 451 U.S. 304, 316\n(1981)).\n\n       The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeal’s\nholding on other grounds, ruling that SLUSA pre-empts state\nlaw claims alleging fraud brought by investors who held\nsecurities, as well as by those who purchased or sold securities.\nDabit II, 547 U.S. at 71. The Supreme Court explained,\n\n       In concluding that SLUSA pre-empts state-law\n       holder class-action claims of the kind alleged in\n       Dabit’s complaint, we do not lose sight of the\n       general ‘presum[ption] that Congress does not\n       cavalierly pre-empt state-law causes of action.’\n       Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U.S. 470, 485\n       (1996). But that presumption carries less force\n       here than in other contexts because SLUSA does\n       not actually pre-empt any state cause of action. It\n       simply denies plaintiffs the right to use the class-\n       action device to vindicate certain claims. The Act\n       does not deny any individual plaintiff, or indeed\n       any group of fewer than 50 plaintiffs, the right to\n       enforce any state-law cause of action that may\n       exist.\n\n       Moreover, the tailored exceptions to SLUSA’s\n       preemptive command demonstrate that Congress\n       did not by any means act ‘cavalierly’ here. The\n       statute carefully exempts from its operation\n       certain class actions based on the law of the State\n\n                               15\n\f       in which the issuer of the covered security is\n       incorporated, actions brought by a state agency or\n       state pension plan, actions under contracts\n       between issuers and indenture trustees, and\n       derivative actions brought by shareholders on\n       behalf of a corporation.         15 U.S.C. §§\n       78bb(f)(3)(A)-(C), (f)(5)(C).\n\nDabit II, 547 U.S. at 87.\n\n        In dismissing plaintiffs’ entire action in the present case,\nthe District Court acknowledged that, in Dabit II, the Supreme\nCourt had not specifically addressed whether preemption of one\nclaim under SLUSA requires dismissal of the entire action.\nHowever, because the presumption against pre-emption had\nunderpinned the Second Circuit’s analysis, the District Court\nfound that the Supreme Court’s decision in Dabit II had\n“weakened, if not undercut entirely,” the Second Circuit’s\nreasoning that SLUSA does not require dismissal of the entire\naction.\n\n        The District Court also concluded that reading SLUSA as\npre-empting entire actions would not produce absurd results,\nrejecting plaintiffs’ claim that applying SLUSA to require the\ndismissal of an entire action would encourage the filing of\nmultiple lawsuits based on the same set of facts in order to\nsegregate state and federal claims. The District Court found that\nCongress had addressed this potential problem by treating “any\ngroup of lawsuits” as a “covered class action” for purposes of\nSLUSA.\n\n\n                                16\n\f        Plaintiffs appealed. They contend that the District Court\nerred in concluding that SLUSA requires dismissal of an entire\naction. Defendants urge us to affirm the District Court’s\nholding or, in the alternative, to affirm the motion to dismiss on\nthe grounds that there is no private right of action under Section\n48(a) of the Investment Company Act and that plaintiffs have\nfailed to state a claim under Section 36(b). Because we agree\nthat SLUSA does not require dismissal of an entire action that\nincludes some claims that are not pre-empted by SLUSA in\naddition to some that are, we will vacate the District Court’s\ndismissal and remand this action to the District Court for further\nproceedings.\n\nII. Discussion\n\n        The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. § 80a-43, the\nInvestment Advisers Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. § 80b-14, and 28\nU.S.C. § 1391(b). We have jurisdiction over this appeal from a\nfinal judgment of the District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §\n1291. “SLUSA preemption is jurisdictional, and we review\ndismissals for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction de novo.”\nLaSala, 519 F.3d at 129 n.7 (3d Cir. 2008).\n\n        As described above, SLUSA was enacted to prevent the\nflight of securities cases from federal to state courts, thereby\npreventing abusive lawsuits and “mak[ing] Federal court the\nexclusive venue for most securities fraud class action litigation\ninvolving nationally traded securities.” H.R. Rep. No. 105-803,\nat 15 (1998) (Conf. Rep.); see also Securities Litigation\nUniform Standards Act of 1998, S. 1260, 105th Cong. § 2(5),\n\n                               17\n\f112 Stat. 3227. Neither the Supreme Court nor this Court has\nsquarely addressed the issue raised in this appeal: whether the\ninclusion of a SLUSA pre-empted state-law claim in a\ncomplaint, also alleging non-SLUSA pre-empted claims,\nrequires dismissal of the entire action. In considering this issue\nas a matter of first impression, and mindful of SLUSA’s\npurpose, we conclude that neither the statutory language, the\nlegislative history, nor the relevant case law supports the\ncomplete dismissal of such an action.\n\n        “The role of the courts in interpreting a statute is to give\neffect to Congress’s intent.” Rosenberg v. XM Ventures, 274\nF.3d 137, 141 (3d Cir. 2001). The first step in statutory\nconstruction is to consider the plain language of the statute.\nUnited States v. Gregg, 226 F.3d 253, 257 (3d Cir. 2000). “If\nthe language of the statute expresses Congress’s intent with\nsufficient precision, the inquiry ends there and the statute is\nenforced according to its terms.” Id. “Where the statutory\nlanguage does not express Congress’s intent unequivocally, a\ncourt traditionally refers to the legislative history and the\natmosphere in which the statute was enacted in an attempt to\ndetermine the congressional purpose.” Id.\n\n       The plain language of SLUSA does not clearly indicate\nwhether Congress intended SLUSA to pre-empt entire actions\nthat include an offending state-law claim. SLUSA provides,\n“No covered class action based upon the statutory or common\nlaw of any State or subdivision thereof may be maintained in\nany State or Federal court . . ..” 15 U.S.C. § 78bb(f)(1)\n(emphasis added). The term “covered class action,” in turn, is\ndefined to include a “single lawsuit” or “group of lawsuits.” Id.\n\n                                18\n\fat § 78bb(f)(5)(B) (emphasis added). As we suggested in\nRowinski, the terms “no . . . action,” “lawsuit,” and “group of\nlawsuits” indeed suggest that SLUSA intends that entire actions,\nas opposed to particular claims, should fail. 398 F.3d at 305.\nHowever, the word “action” is modified by the phrase “based\nupon the statutory or common law of any State.” 15 U.S.C. §\n78bb(f)(1). The plain language of SLUSA does not refer to\nactions, such as this one, based in part on state law.\n\n       Nor does the legislative history compel us to conclude\nthat SLUSA requires dismissal of the entire action in such a\ncase. The legislative history is silent as to whether Congress\nintended an action to be dismissed in its entirety when it\nincludes pre-empted claims or whether only the pre-empted\nclaims must be dismissed. We struggle to see how permitting\nfederal claims that do not specifically trigger the SLUSA\npreemption to proceed would lead to either abusive litigation or\nto the application of different legal standards to national\nsecurities. Failing to dismiss the entire complaint would simply\nallow class action federal claims, and state law claims that do\nnot trigger the SLUSA preemption, to proceed. Nothing in\nSLUSA’s language or history indicates any intent to eviscerate\nsuch claims.\n\n       Of course, requiring the dismissal of an entire action\npursuant to SLUSA might deter class action plaintiffs and their\nattorneys from attempting to test the boundaries of which\nindividual state law claims are pre-empted by SLUSA.\nHowever, nothing in either the plain language of the statute or\n\n\n\n                              19\n\fthe legislative history suggests that Congress intended SLUSA\nto have such a punitive effect.8 Even if SLUSA were interpreted\n\n\n   8\n     In In re Enron Corporation Securities, 535 F.3d 325 (5th\nCir. 2008), the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit recently\nsuggested that plaintiffs (or, perhaps, their attorneys) faced risk\nof dismissal pursuant to SLUSA where they chose to pursue pre-\nempted state law claims in multiple lawsuits each involving\nfewer than fifty plaintiffs. In In re Enron, the court held that,\nwhere the lawsuits were coordinated and nearly identical, ten\ncases consolidated in multi-district litigation were a “covered\nclass action” for purposes of SLUSA, notwithstanding that prior\nto removal and consolidation each case might have escaped\nSLUSA pre-emption based on the number of plaintiffs. Id. at\n340.\n        In so doing, the court rejected the plaintiffs’ argument\nthat preempting their claims would lead to an absurd result in\nthe context of multi-district litigation, noting, “[T]he . . .\nplaintiffs brush aside their own contribution to SLUSA\npreemption: choosing to proceed as a single action. . . . [T]hey\nmust now face the consequences.” Id. at 342. “[T]he issue here\nis not whether [plaintiffs] may avoid SLUSA; the question is\nwhether they did in fact avoid SLUSA.” Id. at 342 n.15.\n        While this language may suggest that SLUSA can have\na punitive effect, the Fifth Circuit was not presented with, and\ntherefore did not consider, the issue presented in this case. The\nquestion presented here, whether SLUSA requires dismissal of\nan entire complaint where only some of the claims are pre-\nempted state law claims, is very different from the question of\n\n                                20\n\fthis way, plaintiffs could simply bring two or more actions in\norder to avoid having all of their claims dismissed – one action\nwith the potentially pre-empted state law claims and one or more\nwith the remaining claims.\n\n       It is entirely consistent with the purposes of SLUSA to\nrequire the dismissal of those state law securities claims that are\nclearly pre-empted by the statute. To require the dismissal of all\nof the other claims in the same action, in contrast, would not\nappear to serve those goals and is not supported by the plain\nlanguage or legislative history. We hold therefore that SLUSA\ndoes not mandate dismissal of an action in its entirety where the\naction includes only some pre-empted claims.\n\n       Our understanding of SLUSA’s requirements with\nrespect to dismissal is not inconsistent with relevant case law.\nWe disagree with the District Court’s conclusion that the\nSupreme Court’s holding in Dabit II “implicitly rejected the\nSecond Circuit’s view” of the issue presented in this case. In\nDabit II, the Supreme Court was confronted with the issue of\nwhether a state law class action claim based on the fact that the\ninvestors held onto overvalued securities as a result of\nmisrepresentations by the brokers was pre-empted by SLUSA.\nDabit II, 547 U.S. at 76-78. The Second Circuit had held that\nSLUSA did not pre-empt such an action because, pursuant to\nBlue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U.S. 723 (1975),\nthe “holder” plaintiffs had no remedy for the alleged fraud under\n\n\nwhether plaintiffs may avoid SLUSA pre-emption altogether by\nfiling multiple lawsuits.\n\n                                21\n\ffederal securities laws. Dabit I, 395 F.3d at 39-44. In reversing,\nthe Supreme Court determined that, in light of SLUSA’s stated\npurpose to prevent frustration of the PSLRA, “[i]t would be odd,\nto say the least, if SLUSA exempted that particularly\ntroublesome subset of class actions [holder actions] from its pre-\nemptive sweep.” Dabit II, 547 U.S. at 86.\n\n         With respect to the Supreme Court’s observation in Dabit\nII that the presumption against pre-emption “carries less force\n. . . because SLUSA does not actually pre-empt any state cause\nof action,” id. at 87, the observation on which the District Court\nrelied, our holding today does not in any way lessen SLUSA’s\n“pre-emptive sweep.” State law securities claims alleging fraud\nwill continue to be pre-empted under SLUSA. We hold simply\nthat any valid federal claims pled in the same action – claims\nthat, if brought independently, would clearly fall outside of\nSLUSA’s pre-emptive scope – need not also be dismissed.\n\n       Nor does the Supreme Court’s decision in Kircher v.\nPutnam Funds Trust, 547 U.S. 633 (2006), compel us to hold\nthat SLUSA requires dismissal of an action in its entirety. In\nKircher, the Supreme Court held that SLUSA does not exempt\nremand orders from the general rule of nonappealability of 28\nU.S.C. § 1447(d).9 547 U.S. at 648. Our conclusion today does\n\n\n  9\n   Section 1447(d) provides, “An order remanding a case to the\nState court from which it was removed is not reviewable on\nappeal or otherwise, except that an order remanding a case to the\nState court from which it was removed pursuant to section 1443\nof this title shall be reviewable by appeal or otherwise.”\n\n                               22\n\fno injury to this holding, for the Kircher opinion did not rely on\nany requirement that an action, including at least some\nimpermissible state law claims, must be dismissed in its\nentirety.10 This issue was not even presented to the Court;\nindeed, the complaint in Kircher included only state-law claims.\nId. at 637.\n\n       Other case law supports our holding. While not directly\non point because it addresses another statute, the Supreme\nCourt’s recent holding in Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 127 S.Ct.\n910 (2007), suggests that Congress’s use of the phrase “no\naction” in a statute is not necessarily determinative of whether\na preclusion provision requires dismissal of the entire action. In\nJones, the Supreme Court held that the Prison Litigation Reform\nAct, which provides, “No action shall be brought with respect to\nprison conditions . . . until such administrative remedies as are\navailable are exhausted,” 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a), does not require\n\n\n  10\n    It is true that the Kircher opinion includes some language to\nthis effect. The Supreme Court stated, for example, “If the\naction is precluded, neither the District Court nor the state court\nmay entertain it, and the proper course is to dismiss.” 547 U.S.\nat 644 (emphasis added). The Court also noted, “[SLUSA]\navails a defendant of a federal forum in contemplation not of\nfurther litigation over the merits of a claim brought in state\ncourt, but of termination of the proceedings altogether . . ..” Id.\nat 644 n.12. Given that the Supreme Court did not have to\nconfront the issue at hand, we do not believe that the use of the\nwords “action” and “proceedings” reflects a holding as to this\nissue.\n\n                                23\n\fdismissal of an entire action where the plaintiff has failed to\nexhaust some, but not all, of his claims. 127 S.Ct. at 923-26.\n\n       Rejecting the argument that Congress could have used\nthe word “claim” instead of “action” if it intended to prohibit\nonly the filing of particular claims, the Supreme Court\nexplained, “This statutory phrasing – ‘no action shall be\nbrought’ – is boilerplate language.” Id. at 924. The Supreme\nCourt continued,\n\n       As a general matter, if a complaint contains both\n       good and bad claims, the court proceeds with the\n       good and leaves the bad. [O]nly the bad claims\n       are dismissed; the complaint as a whole is not. If\n       Congress meant to depart from this norm, we\n       would expect some indication of that, and we find\n       none.\n\nId. (internal quotation omitted).\n\n        Although Jones did not involve SLUSA, its analysis\nsuggests that the fact that SLUSA provides, “No covered class\naction . . . may be maintained,” does not require dismissal of an\nentire action that includes only some offending claims. At least\none court, albeit non-binding on this Court, has found Jones\nhelpful in deciding the present issue and likewise determined\nthat SLUSA does not require a complete dismissal. See In re\nSalomon Smith Barney Mut. Fund Fees Litig., 528 F. Supp. 2d\n332, 334 n.3 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (rejecting the argument that all\nclaims must be dismissed under SLUSA); LaSala v. Bank of\nCyprus Pub. Co., 510 F. Supp. 2d 246, 274-75 & 274 n.11\n\n                               24\n\f(S.D.N.Y. 2007) (holding that Dabit I remains the law of the\nSecond Circuit regarding whether the entire action should be\ndismissed, and rejecting the District Court’s analysis of Dabit I\nin this case).\n\n        Because nothing in the language, legislative history, or\nrelevant case law mandates the dismissal of an entire action that\nincludes both claims that do not offend SLUSA’s prohibition on\nstate law securities class actions and claims that do, the District\nCourt erred in dismissing this action on these grounds.\nAllowing those claims that do not fall within SLUSA’s pre-\nemptive scope to proceed, while dismissing those that do, is\nconsistent with the goals of preventing abusive securities\nlitigation while promoting national legal standards for nationally\ntraded securities.\n\n        We decline defendants’ request to affirm the dismissal of\nthis case on alternative grounds, in particular, that plaintiffs’\ncomplaint fails to state a cause of action under Section 48(a)\nbecause no private right of action exists under that provision and\nthat plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under Section 36(b).11\nThese alternate grounds, along with a number of other possible\nbases for dismissal, were all briefed before the District Court in\na separate motion to dismiss, which was pending when the\nDistrict Court dismissed the case on SLUSA grounds. The\nalternate grounds for dismissal would be better decided by the\nDistrict Court in the first instance.\n\n\n  11\n    At oral argument, counsel for plaintiffs indicated that they\nare no longer pursuing their claims under Section 48(a).\n\n                                25\n\fIV. Conclusion\n\n       For the reasons set forth above, we will vacate the\nDistrict Court’s order dismissing the entire action on the\ngrounds that it is pre-empted by SLUSA and remand the case for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this Opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                             26\n\f",

Factual and Procedural Background\n\n       Plaintiffs are a proposed class of shareholders of mutual\nfunds managed by Lord, Abbett & Co. LLC (Lord Abbett). On\nFebruary 9, 2004, they filed this lawsuit against Lord Abbett and\nLord Abbett Distributor LLC, the investment adviser and\ndistributor of the Lord Abbett mutual funds.1 Following the\nconsolidation of multiple related cases, plaintiffs filed a\n\n\n  1\n      A number of other defendants are no longer in the case.\n\n                                4\n\fConsolidated Amended Class Action Complaint on August 16,\n2004.\n\n        In their Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint,\nplaintiffs alleged (among other misdeeds) that Lord Abbett\ncharged its existing investors excessive fees that were\nimproperly used to pay brokers to market Lord Abbett funds to\nother investors. Plaintiffs claimed that Lord Abbett was\nmotivated to charge excessive fees because its management fees\nwere based on the amount of assets being managed – as the\nnumber of investors grew so did the assets – and so did the fees.\nPlaintiffs alleged violations of both federal and state law,\nincluding violations of Sections 36(b) and 48(a) of the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940, brought on behalf of the\nproposed class, and four state law counts, also brought on behalf\nof the class.\n\n        Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, based in part on the\nground that plaintiffs’ action was pre-empted by SLUSA, 15\nU.S.C. § 78bb(f).

Congress enacted the PSLRA to prevent the filing\nof “strike suits” – abusive class actions which are brought with\nthe hope that the expense of litigation may force defendants to\nsettle despite the actions’ lack of merit. In Congress’s view,\nsuch actions “unnecessarily increase the cost of raising capital\nand chill corporate disclosure . . .. ” S. Rep. 104-98 (1995),\nreprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. 679, 683.

The court,\nhowever, declined to hold that SLUSA operated in this manner,\nreasoning that,\n\n       On this reading, SLUSA would effectively\n       preempt any state law claim conjoined in a given\n       case with a securities fraud claim, whatever its\n       nature.

The Supreme Court explained,\n\n       In concluding that SLUSA pre-empts state-law\n       holder class-action claims of the kind alleged in\n       Dabit’s complaint, we do not lose sight of the\n       general ‘presum[ption] that Congress does not\n       cavalierly pre-empt state-law causes of action.’\n       Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118055\"><a href=\"/opinion/118055/medtronic-inc-v-lohr/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">470</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 485\n       (1996). But that presumption carries less force\n       here than in other contexts because SLUSA does\n       not actually pre-empt any state cause of action. It\n       simply denies plaintiffs the right to use the class-\n       action device to vindicate certain claims. The Act\n       does not deny any individual plaintiff, or indeed\n       any group of fewer than 50 plaintiffs, the right to\n       enforce any state-law cause of action that may\n       exist.\n\n       Moreover, the tailored exceptions to SLUSA’s\n       preemptive command demonstrate that Congress\n       did not by any means act ‘cavalierly’ here. The\n       statute carefully exempts from its operation\n       certain class actions based on the law of the State\n\n                               15\n\f       in which the issuer of the covered security is\n       incorporated, actions brought by a state agency or\n       state pension plan, actions under contracts\n       between issuers and indenture trustees, and\n       derivative actions brought by shareholders on\n       behalf of a corporation.         15 U.S.C. §§\n       78bb(f)(3)(A)-(C), (f)(5)(C).\n\nDabit II, 547 U.S. at 87.\n\n        In dismissing plaintiffs’ entire action in the present case,\nthe District Court acknowledged that, in Dabit II, the Supreme\nCourt had not specifically addressed whether preemption of one\nclaim under SLUSA requires dismissal of the entire action.\nHowever, because the presumption against pre-emption had\nunderpinned the Second Circuit’s analysis, the District Court\nfound that the Supreme Court’s decision in Dabit II had\n“weakened, if not undercut entirely,” the Second Circuit’s\nreasoning that SLUSA does not require dismissal of the entire\naction.\n\n        The District Court also concluded that reading SLUSA as\npre-empting entire actions would not produce absurd results,\nrejecting plaintiffs’ claim that applying SLUSA to require the\ndismissal of an entire action would encourage the filing of\nmultiple lawsuits based on the same set of facts in order to\nsegregate state and federal claims. The District Court found that\nCongress had addressed this potential problem by treating “any\ngroup of lawsuits” as a “covered class action” for purposes of\nSLUSA.\n\n\n                                16\n\f        Plaintiffs appealed. They contend that the District Court\nerred in concluding that SLUSA requires dismissal of an entire\naction. Defendants urge us to affirm the District Court’s\nholding or, in the alternative, to affirm the motion to dismiss on\nthe grounds that there is no private right of action under Section\n48(a) of the Investment Company Act and that plaintiffs have\nfailed to state a claim under Section 36(b). Because we agree\nthat SLUSA does not require dismissal of an entire action that\nincludes some claims that are not pre-empted by SLUSA in\naddition to some that are, we will vacate the District Court’s\ndismissal and remand this action to the District Court for further\nproceedings.\n\nII. Discussion\n\n        The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. § 80a-43, the\nInvestment Advisers Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. § 80b-14, and 28\nU.S.C. § 1391(b). We have jurisdiction over this appeal from a\nfinal judgment of the District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §\n1291. “SLUSA preemption is jurisdictional, and we review\ndismissals for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction de novo.”\nLaSala, 519 F.3d at 129 n.7 (3d Cir. 2008).\n\n        As described above, SLUSA was enacted to prevent the\nflight of securities cases from federal to state courts, thereby\npreventing abusive lawsuits and “mak[ing] Federal court the\nexclusive venue for most securities fraud class action litigation\ninvolving nationally traded securities.” H.R. Rep. No. 105-803,\nat 15 (1998) (Conf. Rep.); see also Securities Litigation\nUniform Standards Act of 1998, S. 1260, 105th Cong. § 2(5),\n\n                               17\n\f112 Stat. 3227. Neither the Supreme Court nor this Court has\nsquarely addressed the issue raised in this appeal: whether the\ninclusion of a SLUSA pre-empted state-law claim in a\ncomplaint, also alleging non-SLUSA pre-empted claims,\nrequires dismissal of the entire action. In considering this issue\nas a matter of first impression, and mindful of SLUSA’s\npurpose, we conclude that neither the statutory language, the\nlegislative history, nor the relevant case law supports the\ncomplete dismissal of such an action.\n\n        “The role of the courts in interpreting a statute is to give\neffect to Congress’s intent.” Rosenberg v.

Gregg, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770377\"><a href=\"/opinion/770377/united-states-of-america-in-no-99-5079-v-joseph-r-gregg-ruby-c/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 257 (3d Cir. 2000). “If\nthe language of the statute expresses Congress’s intent with\nsufficient precision, the inquiry ends there and the statute is\nenforced according to its terms.” Id. “Where the statutory\nlanguage does not express Congress’s intent unequivocally, a\ncourt traditionally refers to the legislative history and the\natmosphere in which the statute was enacted in an attempt to\ndetermine the congressional purpose.” Id.\n\n       The plain language of SLUSA does not clearly indicate\nwhether Congress intended SLUSA to pre-empt entire actions\nthat include an offending state-law claim. SLUSA provides,\n“No covered class action based upon the statutory or common\nlaw of any State or subdivision thereof may be maintained in\nany State or Federal court . . ..” 15 U.S.C. § 78bb(f)(1)\n(emphasis added). The term “covered class action,” in turn, is\ndefined to include a “single lawsuit” or “group of lawsuits.” Id.\n\n                                18\n\fat § 78bb(f)(5)(B) (emphasis added). As we suggested in\nRowinski, the terms “no . . . action,” “lawsuit,” and “group of\nlawsuits” indeed suggest that SLUSA intends that entire actions,\nas opposed to particular claims, should fail. 398 F.3d at 305.\nHowever, the word “action” is modified by the phrase “based\nupon the statutory or common law of any State.” 15 U.S.C. §\n78bb(f)(1). The plain language of SLUSA does not refer to\nactions, such as this one, based in part on state law.\n\n       Nor does the legislative history compel us to conclude\nthat SLUSA requires dismissal of the entire action in such a\ncase. The legislative history is silent as to whether Congress\nintended an action to be dismissed in its entirety when it\nincludes pre-empted claims or whether only the pre-empted\nclaims must be dismissed. We struggle to see how permitting\nfederal claims that do not specifically trigger the SLUSA\npreemption to proceed would lead to either abusive litigation or\nto the application of different legal standards to national\nsecurities. Failing to dismiss the entire complaint would simply\nallow class action federal claims, and state law claims that do\nnot trigger the SLUSA preemption, to proceed. Nothing in\nSLUSA’s language or history indicates any intent to eviscerate\nsuch claims.\n\n       Of course, requiring the dismissal of an entire action\npursuant to SLUSA might deter class action plaintiffs and their\nattorneys from attempting to test the boundaries of which\nindividual state law claims are pre-empted by SLUSA.\nHowever, nothing in either the plain language of the statute or\n\n\n\n                              19\n\fthe legislative history suggests that Congress intended SLUSA\nto have such a punitive effect.8 Even if SLUSA were interpreted\n\n\n   8\n     In In re Enron Corporation Securities, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"62944\"><a href=\"/opinion/62944/in-re-enron-corp-securities/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th\nCir. 2008), the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit recently\nsuggested that plaintiffs (or, perhaps, their attorneys) faced risk\nof dismissal pursuant to SLUSA where they chose to pursue pre-\nempted state law claims in multiple lawsuits each involving\nfewer than fifty plaintiffs. In In re Enron, the court held that,\nwhere the lawsuits were coordinated and nearly identical, ten\ncases consolidated in multi-district litigation were a “covered\nclass action” for purposes of SLUSA, notwithstanding that prior\nto removal and consolidation each case might have escaped\nSLUSA pre-emption based on the number of plaintiffs. Id. at\n340.\n        In so doing, the court rejected the plaintiffs’ argument\nthat preempting their claims would lead to an absurd result in\nthe context of multi-district litigation, noting, “[T]he . . .\nplaintiffs brush aside their own contribution to SLUSA\npreemption: choosing to proceed as a single action. . . . [T]hey\nmust now face the consequences.” Id. at 342. “[T]he issue here\nis not whether [plaintiffs] may avoid SLUSA; the question is\nwhether they did in fact avoid SLUSA.” Id. at 342 n.15.\n        While this language may suggest that SLUSA can have\na punitive effect, the Fifth Circuit was not presented with, and\ntherefore did not consider, the issue presented in this case. The\nquestion presented here, whether SLUSA requires dismissal of\nan entire complaint where only some of the claims are pre-\nempted state law claims, is very different from the question of\n\n                                20\n\fthis way, plaintiffs could simply bring two or more actions in\norder to avoid having all of their claims dismissed – one action\nwith the potentially pre-empted state law claims and one or more\nwith the remaining claims.\n\n       It is entirely consistent with the purposes of SLUSA to\nrequire the dismissal of those state law securities claims that are\nclearly pre-empted by the statute. To require the dismissal of all\nof the other claims in the same action, in contrast, would not\nappear to serve those goals and is not supported by the plain\nlanguage or legislative history. We hold therefore that SLUSA\ndoes not mandate dismissal of an action in its entirety where the\naction includes only some pre-empted claims.\n\n       Our understanding of SLUSA’s requirements with\nrespect to dismissal is not inconsistent with relevant case law.\nWe disagree with the District Court’s conclusion that the\nSupreme Court’s holding in Dabit II “implicitly rejected the\nSecond Circuit’s view” of the issue presented in this case. In\nDabit II, the Supreme Court was confronted with the issue of\nwhether a state law class action claim based on the fact that the\ninvestors held onto overvalued securities as a result of\nmisrepresentations by the brokers was pre-empted by SLUSA.\nDabit II, 547 U.S. at 76-78. The Second Circuit had held that\nSLUSA did not pre-empt such an action because, pursuant to\nBlue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109267\"><a href=\"/opinion/109267/blue-chip-stamps-v-manor-drug-stores/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">723</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1975),\nthe “holder” plaintiffs had no remedy for the alleged fraud under\n\n\nwhether plaintiffs may avoid SLUSA pre-emption altogether by\nfiling multiple lawsuits.\n\n                                21\n\ffederal securities laws. Dabit I, 395 F.3d at 39-44. In reversing,\nthe Supreme Court determined that, in light of SLUSA’s stated\npurpose to prevent frustration of the PSLRA, “[i]t would be odd,\nto say the least, if SLUSA exempted that particularly\ntroublesome subset of class actions [holder actions] from its pre-\nemptive sweep.” Dabit II, 547 U.S. at 86.\n\n         With respect to the Supreme Court’s observation in Dabit\nII that the presumption against pre-emption “carries less force\n. . . because SLUSA does not actually pre-empt any state cause\nof action,” id. at 87, the observation on which the District Court\nrelied, our holding today does not in any way lessen SLUSA’s\n“pre-emptive sweep.” State law securities claims alleging fraud\nwill continue to be pre-empted under SLUSA. We hold simply\nthat any valid federal claims pled in the same action – claims\nthat, if brought independently, would clearly fall outside of\nSLUSA’s pre-emptive scope – need not also be dismissed.\n\n       Nor does the Supreme Court’s decision in Kircher v.\nPutnam Funds Trust, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145645\"><a href=\"/opinion/145645/kircher-v-putnam-funds-trust/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">633</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2006), compel us to hold\nthat SLUSA requires dismissal of an action in its entirety. In\nKircher, the Supreme Court held that SLUSA does not exempt\nremand orders from the general rule of nonappealability of 28\nU.S.C. § 1447(d).9 547 U.S. at 648. Our conclusion today does\n\n\n  9\n   Section 1447(d) provides, “An order remanding a case to the\nState court from which it was removed is not reviewable on\nappeal or otherwise, except that an order remanding a case to the\nState court from which it was removed pursuant to section 1443\nof this title shall be reviewable by appeal or otherwise.”\n\n                               22\n\fno injury to this holding, for the Kircher opinion did not rely on\nany requirement that an action, including at least some\nimpermissible state law claims, must be dismissed in its\nentirety.10 This issue was not even presented to the Court;\nindeed, the complaint in Kircher included only state-law claims.\nId. at 637.\n\n       Other case law supports our holding. While not directly\non point because it addresses another statute, the Supreme\nCourt’s recent holding in Jones v. Bock, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145763\"><a href=\"/opinion/145763/jones-v-bock/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">199</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145763\"><a href=\"/opinion/145763/jones-v-bock/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">910</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2007), suggests that Congress’s use of the phrase “no\naction” in a statute is not necessarily determinative of whether\na preclusion provision requires dismissal of the entire action. In\nJones, the Supreme Court held that the Prison Litigation Reform\nAct, which provides, “No action shall be brought with respect to\nprison conditions . . . until such administrative remedies as are\navailable are exhausted,” 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a), does not require\n\n\n  10\n    It is true that the Kircher opinion includes some language to\nthis effect. The Supreme Court stated, for example, “If the\naction is precluded, neither the District Court nor the state court\nmay entertain it, and the proper course is to dismiss.” 547 U.S.\nat 644 (emphasis added). The Court also noted, “[SLUSA]\navails a defendant of a federal forum in contemplation not of\nfurther litigation over the merits of a claim brought in state\ncourt, but of termination of the proceedings altogether . . ..” Id.\nat 644 n.12. Given that the Supreme Court did not have to\nconfront the issue at hand, we do not believe that the use of the\nwords “action” and “proceedings” reflects a holding as to this\nissue.\n\n                                23\n\fdismissal of an entire action where the plaintiff has failed to\nexhaust some, but not all, of his claims. 127 S.Ct. at 923-26.\n\n       Rejecting the argument that Congress could have used\nthe word “claim” instead of “action” if it intended to prohibit\nonly the filing of particular claims, the Supreme Court\nexplained, “This statutory phrasing – ‘no action shall be\nbrought’ – is boilerplate language.” Id. at 924. The Supreme\nCourt continued,\n\n       As a general matter, if a complaint contains both\n       good and bad claims, the court proceeds with the\n       good and leaves the bad. [O]nly the bad claims\n       are dismissed; the complaint as a whole is not. If\n       Congress meant to depart from this norm, we\n       would expect some indication of that, and we find\n       none.\n\nId. (internal quotation omitted).\n\n        Although Jones did not involve SLUSA, its analysis\nsuggests that the fact that SLUSA provides, “No covered class\naction . . . may be maintained,” does not require dismissal of an\nentire action that includes only some offending claims. At least\none court, albeit non-binding on this Court, has found Jones\nhelpful in deciding the present issue and likewise determined\nthat SLUSA does not require a complete dismissal.

The\nalternate grounds for dismissal would be better decided by the\nDistrict Court in the first instance.\n\n\n  11\n    At oral argument, counsel for plaintiffs indicated that they\nare no longer pursuing their claims under Section 48(a).\n\n                                25\n\fIV. Conclusion\n\n       For the reasons set forth above, we will vacate the\nDistrict Court’s order dismissing the entire action on the\ngrounds that it is pre-empted by SLUSA and remand the case for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this Opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                             26\n\f</pre>",
