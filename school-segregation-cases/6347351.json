Because Restrictive Covenant 1 is ambiguous, it must be\n            strictly construed in favor of BCH’s free and unrestricted use\n            of the property ............................................................................... 10\n\n                A.      Wohlrabe’s argument ignores the more pertinent\n                        definitions contain in the 1951 and current building\n                        codes.................................................................................13\n\n                        1.       BCH properly preserved its argument\n                                 regarding the 1951 Dallas Building Code ................13\n                        2.       The 1951 Dallas Building Code definitions\n                                 demonstrate that the restrictive covenant is\n                                 susceptible to more than one reasonable\n                                 interpretation ..........................................................14\n                B.      Courts in Texas and elsewhere have held similar\n                        covenants ambiguous ....................................................... 17\n\n                        1.       The Dallas County District Court ruling in\n                                 Dienes v. LTG Vegan Ltd. is not instructive in\n                                 this case................................................................... 17\n                        2.       Courts of appeal across various jurisdictions\n                                 have held similar deed restriction language\n                                 ambiguous as a matter of law ................................ 18\n                        3.       The Arizona, Arkansas, Nevada, and\n                                 California cases cited by Wohlrabe are not\n                                 instructive and should not be considered by\n                                 this Court ................................................................21\n\n\n                                                      3\n\f          C.    The evidence in the summary judgment record\n                demonstrates the ambiguity of the phrase “one story\n                in height” ......................................................................... 23\n\n                1.      BCH did not waive its argument that its\n                        proposed habitable attic was not a second\n                        story ....................................................................... 23\n                2.      Wohlrabe’s objections to Blanchard and\n                        Shekter’s affidavits are unfounded and were\n                        waived .................................................................... 24\n                3.      Conflicting expert testimony bolsters BCH’s\n                        allegation that “one story in height” is\n                        susceptible to more than one interpretation ......... 26\n                4.      Testimony from Wohlrabe and Wohlrabe’s\n                        expert further demonstrates the ambiguity of\n                        the phrase “one story in height” ............................ 28\n          D.    Wohlrabe’s subjective interpretation of the\n                Restrictive Covenant 1 renders it meaningless ............... 29\n\nII.    BCH’s affirmative defenses of impossibility, waiver, estoppel,\n       and unclean hands precluded summary judgment ....................... 30\n\n          A.    The trial court erred in granting summary judgment\n                and denying BCH’s Motion to Reconsider because\n                there was a fact issue on BCH’s affirmative defense\n                of impossibility ................................................................ 30\n\n          B.    The trial court erred in granting summary judgment\n                as to BCH’s waiver defense ............................................. 32\n\n          C.    The trial court erred in granting summary judgment\n                as to BCH’s estoppel defense........................................... 34\n\n          D.    The trial court erred in granting summary judgment\n                as to BCH’s unclean hands defense ................................. 36\n\nIII.   The trial court abused its discretion when it denied BCH’s\n       Motion to Dissolve Due to Changed Circumstances ..................... 38\n\n                                             4\n\f    IV.     The trial court erred when it granted summary judgment as\n            to BCH’s counter claims against Wohlrabe and the other\n            members of the LHPOA ................................................................ 39\n\nCONCLUSION............................................................................................. 40\n\nPRAYER ...................................................................................................... 42\n\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE....................................................................... 44\n\nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE .............................................................. 45\n\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nRelator’s Petition for Writ of Mandamus\n(Case No. 05-16-01481-CV)                                                                               Tab 1\n\nOpinion (Case No. 05-16-01481-CV)                                                                      Tab 2\n\n\n\n\n                                                       5\n\f                              INDEX OF AUTHORITIES\n\nCases\n\nDyegard Land P’ship v.

Because Restrictive Covenant 1 is ambiguous, it must be\n          strictly construed in favor of BCH’s free and unrestricted\n          use of the property\n\n          Covenants restricting the free use of land are not favored by the\n\ncourts, but will be enforced if they are clearly worded and confined to a\n\nlawful purpose. See, e.g., Jennings v. Bindseil, 258 S.W.3d 190, 194–95\n\n(Tex. App.—Austin 2008, no pet.) (citing Wilmoth v. Wilcox, 734 S.W.2d\n\n656, 657 (Tex. 1987)). When the language of a restrictive covenant is\n\nunambiguous, it is liberally construed to give effect to its purpose and\n\nintent. Id. at 195; Tex. Prop. Code § 202.003(a).\n\n          However, if the language is found to be ambiguous, the restrictive\n\ncovenant is construed strictly against the party seeking to enforce the\n\nrestriction, and all doubts must be resolved in favor of the free and\n\nunrestricted use of the property. Wilmoth, 734 S.W.2d at 657.\n\n          Wohlrabe’s attempt to distinguish the Texas Supreme Court’s holding\n\nin Wilmoth falls flat. Wohlrabe argues Wilmoth is inapplicable because it\n\nwas decided before § 202.003(a) was enacted. 1 This in incorrect—it was\n\ndecided after §202.003(a) was enacted. More importantly, the Texas\n\nSupreme Court more recently refused to find that § 202.003(a) supplanted\n\nWilmoth and its analysis. See Pilarcik v. Emmons, 966 S.W.2d 474, 478–\n\n1   See Appellees’ Br. at 22, fn 5.\n                                         10\n\f80 (Tex.1998). This is precisely why a majority of the Texas courts of\n\nappeals have adopted the Wilmoth holding that when a deed restriction is\n\nambiguous, it must be “strictly construed against the party seeking to\n\nenforce the restriction, and all doubts must be resolved in favor of the free\n\nand unrestricted use of the property.” Jennings, 258 S.W.3d at 195.2\n\nWohlrabe’s suggestion that there is no authority to support BCH’s\n\ncontention that ambiguous covenants must be strictly construed against the\n\nparty seeking to enforce them is therefore a blatant misrepresentation.\n\n      Whether a restrictive covenant is ambiguous is a question of law that\n\nmust be decided by examining the covenant as a whole in light of the\n\ncircumstances     present when it was            drafted.   See Columbia Gas\n\nTransmission Corp. v. New Ulm Gas, Ltd., 940 S.W.2d 587, 589 (Tex.\n\n1996). Restrictive covenants are subject to the general rules of contract\n\nconstruction. Pilarcik v. Emmons, 966 S.W.2d 474, 478 (Tex.1998). Like a\n\ncontract, restrictive covenants are unambiguous as a matter of law if they\n\ncan be given a definite or certain legal meaning. Id. at 478.

App.—Beaumont 2017, pet. filed).\n\n                                         11\n\fhand, restrictive covenants that are susceptible to more than one\n\nreasonable interpretation are ambiguous as a matter of law, even if one\n\ninterpretation appears more reasonable than another. Id.; Balandran v.\n\nSafeco Ins. Co. of Am., 972 S.W.2d 738, 741 (Tex. 1998). Importantly, the\n\nwords and phrases in the restrictive covenant must not be enlarged,\n\nextended, changed, or stretched by construction. Wilmoth, 734 S.W.2d at\n\n657–58.\n\n      The language used in Restrictive Covenant 1—“one story in height”—\n\nis ambiguous on its face. The covenants do not prohibit attics and there is\n\nno definition regarding what constitutes a “story” and, more specifically,\n\nwhat kind of attic is not permitted. Moreover, while Restrictive Covenant 1\n\nis a restriction based on “height,” the covenants fail entirely to provide what\n\nconstitutes excessive “height” in violation of the covenant. This not only\n\ncreates ambiguity, but by Wohlrabe’s expert’s own testimony, makes\n\nRestrictive Covenant 1 arbitrary, as a home could be 40 feet tall (tall enough\n\nto be a three-story home), so long as there is no usable space over the\n\nground floor. BCH’s contention is supported by (1) pertinent definitions of\n\nthe 1951 Dallas Building Code, (2) all relevant case law, and (3) the\n\nevidence in the summary judgment record.\n\n\n\n\n                                      12\n\f     A.       Wohlrabe’s argument ignores the more pertinent\n              definitions contain in the 1951 and current building\n              codes\n\n     In the summary judgment record and in Appellees’ Brief, Wohlrabe\n\ncites the 1940, 1952, and 1956 dictionary definitions of “story” and “height”\n\nto show their “generally accepted meaning” at the time the restrictive\n\ncovenants were created—which, generally, stated that a “story” was a set of\n\nrooms on the same floor of a building and “height” meant a distance\n\nupward from the ground. (4 CR 4161–66.) But contrary to Wohlrabe’s\n\nassertion that these dictionary definitions in and of themselves give the\n\nrestrictive covenant at issue a definite and certain meaning, there were\n\nother applicable and relevant definitions that existed at the time the\n\ncovenants were written within the 1951 Dallas Building Code.\n\n              1.   BCH properly preserved its argument regarding\n                   the 1951 Dallas Building Code\n\n     Wohlrabe asserts that BCH waived its ambiguity arguments arising\n\nfrom the 1951 Dallas Building Code’s definition of “attic story.” This is\n\ninaccurate.\n\n     The 1951 Dallas Building Code was expressly addressed in Wohlrabe’s\n\nMotion for Summary Judgment. (4 CR 4163.) Moreover, the 1951 Dallas\n\nBuilding Code Provisions—including the term “attic story”—were discussed\n\nat length in the summary judgment evidence submitted by BCH, including:\n\n                                     13\n\fthe affidavit of Frank Blanchard, the testimony of Wohlrabe, and the\n\nAmended Affidavit of Mark Shekter. (3 SCR 72–102, 177–78; 6 CR 5512–\n\n29.) All of these exhibits were cited in BCH’s summary judgment response\n\nand amended response in support of BCH’s argument that the language in\n\nthe restrictive covenant is ambiguous. (5 CR 4637–4688; 6 CR 5371–5425.)\n\nAccordingly, Wohlrabe’s claim that BCH’s argument that the 1951 Building\n\nCode provisions support BCH’s assertion of ambiguity is meritless.\n\n            2.     The 1951 Dallas Building Code definitions\n                   demonstrate that the restrictive covenant is\n                   susceptible to more than one reasonable\n                   interpretation\n\n      The 1951 Dallas Building Code, which was in force at the time the\n\nrestrictions were written, contained a separate definition for “story,” attic”\n\nand “attic story.” Specifically, “story” is defined as:\n\n      That portion of a building included between the upper surface\n      of any floor and the upper surface of the floor next above,\n      except that the topmost story shall be that portion of a building\n      included between the upper surface of the topmost floor and the\n      ceiling above.\n\nThe 1951 Code defines “attic” as:\n\n      Any space situated between a roof and ceiling immediately\n      below and not used for business, storage, or habitation.\n\n“Attic story” is defined as:\n\n\n\n\n                                        14\n\f      Any story situated whole or partly in the roof, so designated,\n      arranged or built as to be used for business, storage, or\n      habitation.\n\n(Appellant’s Br. at Apx. Tab L.) Whether or not an “attic story” was\n\nconsidered a “story” is not mentioned or defined in the 1951 Code, but the\n\nspecific inclusion of “attic story” in the Code indicates that an “attic story” is\n\nnot the same as a “story” in the general sense. Moreover, most houses in the\n\naddition do have an “attic story” under the 1951 definitions.\n\n      Most importantly, the 1951 Dallas Building Code states an “attic\n\nstory”—a finished-out attic for habitation—is not the same as “story.” The\n\nrestrictive covenants at issue do not prohibit attics from being used for\n\nstorage or habitation, nor are the terms “attic” or “attic story” mentioned in\n\nthe deed restrictions. Thus, the 1951 Code alone creates an ambiguity as to\n\nwhether habitable attics are prohibited under the restrictive covenants at\n\nissue and whether an “attic story,” which is separately defined under the\n\nCode, is considered a “story” within the meaning of the deed restrictions.\n\n      Wohlrabe argues that “simply because the Restrictive Covenants\n\ndon’t expressly prohibit ‘attic stories’ does not mean the creators did not\n\nintend to prohibit them. . .” Appellees’ Br. at 31–32. However, Wohlrabe\n\nhas presented no evidence that the creators of the covenants did intend to\n\nprohibit attic stories. And, despite the clear distinctions between “attic,”\n\n\n                                       15\n\f“attic story,” and “story” in the very regulations which governed building in\n\nDallas at the time the covenants were written, the creators chose to use the\n\nmore general phrase “one story in height.” Moreover, rather than\n\n“nullifying”   Restrictive    Covenant       1   as   Wohlrabe    claims,   BCH’s\n\ninterpretation   simply      provides    an      alternative   interpretation—that\n\nRestrictive Covenant 1 does not prohibit certain types of attics. This creates\n\nunmistakable ambiguity, which mandates that the restrictive covenant be\n\nstrictly construed toward the free and unrestricted use of the property.\n\n      Wohlrabe belabors the point that the only relevant sources for\n\ndetermining the deed restrictions are those that were in existence at the\n\ntime the covenants were drafted (such as the 1951 Dallas Building Code).\n\nYet it is still instructive to compare the 1951 provisions to the present day\n\nIRC provisions, for doing so highlights the trend of Dallas building codes to\n\ndraw a distinction between a traditional “story” and an “attic/habitable\n\nattic/attic story.” Notably, the 2012 and 2015 IRCs “habitable attic”\n\ndefinition is very similar to the definition of “attic story” contained in the\n\n1951 version of the Dallas Building Code, which governed residential\n\nconstruction in Dallas at the inception of the Addition’s deed restrictions.\n\nIn fact, the only difference between the IRC definition of “habitable attic”\n\nand the 1951 Dallas Building Code definition of “attic story” is that under\n\n\n                                        16\n\fthe modern day definition of “habitable attic,” the exact same attic space\n\nwould have been defined as an “attic story” in 1951 and must now comply\n\nwith certain safety requirements, whether the attic is finished or\n\nunfinished. Further, a “habitable attic” under the 2012 IRC definitions is,\n\nby the IRC’s exact words, “not considered a story.”\n\n     Wohlrabe’s argument that the Restrictive Covenant 1 has a “definite\n\nlegal meaning” rests on dictionary definitions, rather than the more\n\npertinent definitions set out in the 1951 Dallas Building Code and IRC,\n\nwhich reveal there is more than one reasonable interpretation of the phrase\n\n“one story in height.” This creates ambiguity which compels this Court to\n\nstrictly construe the restrictive covenants against Wohlrabe and resolve the\n\nambiguity favorably toward BCH’s free and unrestricted use of the\n\nproperty.\n\n     B.     Courts in Texas and elsewhere have held similar\n            covenants ambiguous\n\n            1.   The Dallas County District Court ruling in Dienes\n                 v. LTG Vegan Ltd. is not instructive in this case\n\n     Wohlrabe cites the 191st District Court’s Findings of Fact and\n\nConclusions of Law in the 2005 case Dienes v. LTG Vegan Ltd. (Cause No.\n\n04-10084-J) in support of her argument that the phrase “one story in\n\nheight” is not ambiguous as a matter of law. Appellee’s Br. at 28. Notably,\n\n\n                                     17\n\fthese findings of fact and conclusions of law do not discuss whether there is\n\nlanguage in those restrictions that define the “height” or whether there was\n\nan active ACC in that case. Further, there is no record or opinion from a\n\ncourt of appeals discussing the merits of the case, as the case was never\n\nappealed. Accordingly, the 191st District Court’s findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law are not legal authority and should not be considered by\n\nthis Court.\n\n              2.   Courts of appeal across various jurisdictions have\n                   held similar deed restriction language ambiguous\n                   as a matter of law\n\n      In Johnson v. Linton, 491 S.W.2d 189 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1973, no\n\nwrit), this Court reviewed a deed restriction which prohibited the building\n\nof houses that exceeded “one and one-half (1-1/2) story in height.” Id. at\n\n191. In that case, the homeowner sought to add two rooms and a bath above\n\nhis garage, which the homeowner claimed constituted a “one-half story.” Id.\n\nThe Court reasoned that because it could not say that “the restrictive\n\nrecitations are so clear that but one reasonable meaning for each respective\n\nphrase ha[d] clearly emerged,” the restriction was ambiguous and must be\n\nconstrued against the party seeking its enforcement. Id. at 197.\n\n      Similar restrictions have been interpreted by many other courts in\n\nvarying jurisdictions to be ambiguous—several of which have cited the\n\n\n                                     18\n\fJohnson case out of this Court. See Allen v. Reed, 155 P.3d 443, 445-46\n\n(Colo. Ct. App. 2006) (citing Johnson in holding deed restriction that\n\nheight of dwelling house “shall not exceed one story in height, measured\n\nfrom finished grade” was ambiguous and unenforceable); Fong v.\n\nHashimoto, 977 P.2d 878, 880-83 (Haw. 2000) (holding that the term “one\n\nstory in height” in the deed restriction was ambiguous and unenforceable);\n\nHiner v. Hoffman, 977 P.2d 878, 880-83 (Haw. 1999) (citing Johnson, 491\n\nS.W.2d at 196-97) (“The indeterminate “two story” language, in our view, is\n\nnot only ineffectual to achieve that purpose but ambiguous when applied to\n\nthe case at bar.”); Metius v. Julio, 342 A.2d 348 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1975)\n\n(“The equitable height restriction does not limit the buildings to ‘three\n\nstories' but rather to ‘three stories in height.’ We are persuaded that the\n\nmeaning of the express ‘three stories in height’ used in this particular\n\nequitable restriction, is ambiguous.”). These courts frequently emphasize\n\nthat a building may have two “stories” and yet not exceed one story in\n\nheight. Hiner, 977 P.2d at 882; Metius, 342 A.2d at 354. Conversely, an\n\ninterpretation that a restriction limiting a structure to one story in height\n\nprohibited any home with any living space on the second “story” would\n\nboth render the phrase “in height” superfluous, Allen, 155 P.3d at 445, and\n\nlead to absurd results, such as:\n\n\n                                     19\n\f         1.    a 35-foot-high one-story house would comply with the\n               restriction but a 20-foot-high two story house wouldn’t, Allen,\n               155 P.3d at 445-46; Hiner, 977 P.2d at 881-82; and\n\n         2.    one home could violate the restriction merely because there is\n               usable space on the two floors while another home, identical\n               from the outside, would not violate the restriction if there were\n               no useable second floor. Allen, 155 P.3d at 445-46.3\n\n       Indeed, for this latter reason, the Eastland Court of Appeals has held\n\nthat homes with finished portions of the attic are one-story homes as a\n\nmatter of law, because on the outside they appeared to be one-story homes.\n\nMorton v. Paradise Code Prop. Owners Ass’n, No. 11-09-00022-CV, 2009\n\nWL 2841208, at *5 (Tex. App.—Eastland Sept. 3, 2009, no pet.) (mem. op.).\n\nIn Morton, the court reasoned that the obvious purpose of the one-story\n\nlimitation was to protect the view of other property owners within the\n\nsubdivision. Id. Thus, the homes complied with the deed restriction\n\nbecause the homes appeared to be one-story homes when viewed from the\n\nexterior despite a finished attic space. Id.\n\n\n\n\n3\n  Wohlrabe argues that this case law is inapplicable because the courts strictly construed the\nrestrictions in contravention to § 202.003(a) and (2) none of the plaintiffs in those cases made the\nsame arguments as Wohlrabe. Appellees’ Br. at 36–37. This attempt to distinguish these cases\nfalls flat. As outlined in greater detail above, Texas courts across the board strictly construe\ncovenants that are ambiguous.\n                                                20\n\f           3.    The Arizona, Arkansas, Nevada, and California\n                 cases cited by Wohlrabe are not instructive and\n                 should not be considered by this Court\n\n     Wohlrabe’s reliance on cases from Arizona, Arkansas, California, and\n\nNevada is improper. Appellees’ Br. at 26–27 (citing Price v. Kravitz, 1 CA-\n\nCV 10-0889, 2012 WL 1380269 (Ariz. Ct. App., April 19, 2012); Pinnacle\n\nPeak Ranchos Prop. Owners Ass’n v. Ramioulle, 2015 WL 8475067, at *2-3\n\n(Ariz. Ct. App. Dec. 10, 2015); King v. Kugler, 17 Cal. Rptr. 504 (Cal. Ct.\n\nApp. 1961); Dickstein v. Williams, 571 P.2d 1169, 1170-71 (Nev. 1977);\n\nHolmesley v. Walk, 39 S.W.3d 463, 465-467 (Ark. Ct. App. 2001)).\n\n     First, Wohlrabe cited to Price v. Kravitz—a memorandum decision\n\nfrom the Arizona Court of Appeals. Appellees’ Br. at 26–27; See Calpine\n\nConstr. Fin. Co. v. Arizona Dep’t of Revenue, 211 P.3d 1228, 1233 (Ariz. Ct.\n\nApp. 2009) (“The general rule for memorandum decisions is that they\n\n“shall not be regarded as precedent nor cited in any court.”). Because Price\n\nis a memorandum opinion that does not refer to or cite relevant Texas law,\n\nit should have no bearing on this Court’s analysis of this case. Moreover,\n\nPrice did not hold that the phrase “not to exceed one story in height” was\n\nunambiguous. Instead, it held that the phrase “one-story in height was\n\n“sufficiently clear to permit enforcement” under Arizona’s rules of\n\nconstruction, which explicitly reject the rule that ambiguous deed\n\n\n                                    21\n\frestrictions are construed in favor of the free use of the land. Price, 2012\n\nWL 1380269, at *2. In Texas, ambiguous deed restriction are construed\n\nstrictly against the party seeking to enforce them and in favor of the free\n\nand unrestricted use of the land. See e.g., See Pilarcik, 966 S.W.2d at 478–\n\n480.\n\n       The Arkansas case similarly does not support Wohlrabe’s position\n\nbecause the deed restriction in that case stated, “No two-story dwelling\n\nshall be constructed” on the property. Holmesley, 39 S.W.3d at 465. The\n\nterm “two-story dwelling” is much less ambiguous than the deed restriction\n\nat issue in this case, which prohibits the building of a home more than\n\n“one-story in height.” Id.\n\n       Finally, even though the California and Nevada cases cited by\n\nWohlrabe might indicate some disharmony over the issue of deed\n\nrestrictions like the one at issue in this case, there are two significant facts\n\nregarding this split of authorities. First, the cases supporting Wohlrabe’s\n\nposition are older, while the more recent cases that were rendered post\n\nJohnson v. Linton support BCH’s position. Second, and more importantly,\n\nthis Court has held that a similar phrase—“not to exceed one-half story in\n\nheight”—to be ambiguous as a matter of law. Johnson, 491 S.W.2d at 106–\n\n\n\n\n                                      22\n\f197. This Court should reaffirm its holding in Johnson and hold that the\n\ndeed restriction at issue in this case is ambiguous as a matter of law.\n\n      C.    The evidence in the summary judgment record\n            demonstrates the ambiguity of the phrase “one story in\n            height”\n\n            1.    BCH did not waive its argument that its proposed\n                  habitable attic was not a second story\n\n      BCH has argued vehemently from the very beginning that the home it\n\nwishes to construct did not violate the covenants because the home was not\n\na two-story home, nor did it exceed one-story in height. However,\n\nWohlrabe contends that BCH waived its argument that its proposed\n\nbuilding plans did not depict a second story under the commonly accepted\n\nmeaning of the term in the 1950s, when the covenants were promulgated.\n\nAppellees’ Br. at 41. This is wrong. While BCH did argue that the 2012 IRC\n\ndefinitions were instructive, BCH did not waive its right to also argue that—\n\neven under the applicable definitions from the 1950s—BCH’s proposed\n\nhome was not a two-story structure. Nor did it exceed one story in height.\n\nRather, BCH attached and cited to evidence, including affidavits and\n\ntestimony from Wohlrabe, Blanchard, Shekter, and Karl Evans in which the\n\n1950s definitions were specifically discussed. (3 SCR 72–102, 139–152,\n\n177–78; 5 CR 4637–4688; 6 CR 5512–29, 5371–5425.)                   Moreover,\n\nWohlrabe discussed these original definitions and Dallas Building Code\n\n                                      23\n\fprovisions in her own Motion for Summary Judgment. (4 CR 4163.) She\n\ncannot now claim that these provisions were not part of the arguments at\n\nsummary judgment and preclude BCH’s citation of them in this Court.\n\nAccordingly, BCH has not waived the argument that its building plans do\n\nnot violate Restrictive Covenant 1 under the definitions in the 1951 Dallas\n\nBuilding Code.\n\n            2.    Wohlrabe’s objections to Blanchard and Shekter’s\n                  affidavits are unfounded and were waived\n\n      While Wohlrabe argues that Blanchard’s testimony via his Amended\n\nAffidavit was inadmissible because his Amended Affidavit was unsigned\n\nand unsworn, Blanchard’s original Affidavit (attached to BCH’s preliminary\n\nresponse to Wohlrabe’s Motion for Summary Judgment) was signed and\n\nsworn. (3 SCR 72–102.) Blanchard’s original Affidavit and Amended\n\nAffidavit contain most of the same testimony, and Blanchard’s original\n\nAffidavit was incorporated by reference into BCH’s amended summary\n\njudgment response. (Id.; 6 CR 5423, 5426–5449.) Accordingly, Wohlrabe’s\n\nobjection on this ground is unfounded and irrelevant to the determination\n\nof this appeal.\n\n      Reasserting the arguments made in her written objection filed with\n\nthe trial court, Wohlrabe further argues that the affidavits of Blanchard and\n\nShekter were inadmissible because they were conclusory, irrelevant, and\n\n                                     24\n\fnot credible. Appellees’ Br. at 43–46; (6 CR 5700–5737.) However, for a\n\nruling on an objection to summary judgment evidence to be effective, the\n\nruling must be reduced to writing, signed by the trial court, and entered of\n\nrecord. S&I Mgmt., Inc. v. Sungju Choi, 331 S.W.3d 849, 855 (Tex. App.—\n\nDallas 2011, no pet.). If the objecting party does not obtain a ruling on its\n\nobjections, objections as to the form of the affidavit are waived and the\n\nobjected-to material is in evidence. Id. (stating that the following objections\n\nconstitute objections as to form: that affidavit is hearsay; that affidavit of\n\ninterested witness is not clear, positive, credible, and free from\n\ncontradiction). Only objections that an affidavit is conclusory may be raised\n\nfor the first time on appeal. Id. Affidavits are conclusory if they do not\n\nprovide the underlying facts to support the conclusion. Id. at 855–86.\n\n      Wohlrabe did not obtain a written ruling from the trial court on her\n\nobjections to Blanchard and Shekter’s affidavits. As most of Wohlrabe’s\n\nobjections stem from her belief that the affidavits are not credible—or that\n\nthe affidavits simply provide testimony she disagrees with—the majority of\n\nWohlrabe’s objections were waived by her failure to obtain a written ruling\n\nin the trial court. To the extent that Wohlrabe argues the affidavits were\n\nconclusory, even a cursory review of the affidavits demonstrates they were\n\nnot. Blanchard’s affidavit is over 25 pages long and provides a detailed\n\n\n                                      25\n\fdescription of the facts and reasoning supporting his ultimate conclusion.\n\n(3 SCR 72–102.) Shekter’s affidavit is similarly thorough. (6 CR 5512–\n\n5529.) This is a far cry from what is sufficient to label an affidavit\n\nconclusory. Accordingly, Wohlrabe’s objections to Blanchard and Shekter’s\n\naffidavits are meritless and have been waived for purposes of this appeal.\n\n            3.    Conflicting expert testimony bolsters BCH’s\n                  allegation that “one story in height” is susceptible\n                  to more than one interpretation\n\n      In coming to its holding in Johnson v. Linton—that the deed\n\nrestriction prohibiting homes that exceeded “one and one-half (1-1/2) story\n\nin height” was ambiguous—this Court reasoned that the “vagueness and\n\nuncertainty of the phrases is classically illustrated by the testimony of the\n\nvarious experts” because each “expert in the field of architectural design\n\nhad his own idea and conception of what was meant by the phrases utilized\n\nin the restrictions.” Id. at 197. Here, just as in Johnson, experts for both\n\nsides put forth thoughtful, well-supported opinions regarding whether, in\n\ntheir opinion, a habitable attic constituted a “story” within the meaning of\n\nthe restrictive covenants.\n\n      BCH’s experts opined that the habitable attic depicted in BCH’s\n\nbuilding plans did not constitute a second “story” within the meaning of the\n\nrestrictions. (3 SCR 72–102; 6 CR 5426-5449, 5512-5529.) Both experts\n\n\n                                     26\n\fstated that they believed BCH’s building plans were in full compliance with\n\nthe restrictive covenants. (6 CR 5441-5442, 5528.) Specifically, Blanchard\n\ntestified that the home BCH intends to build would have no exterior second\n\nfloor plate lines, the entire roof assembly of the home sits on the ground\n\nfloor plate line, and the home lacked any architecturally defined features\n\nthat would be required for a home to be architecturally defined as a two-\n\nstory home. (6 CR 5430.) Both Blanchard and Shekter testified that the\n\ninclusion of the phrase “ground floor area” within restriction #2 indicates\n\nthat the drafters did not intend to prohibit a two-story home or a home with\n\na habitable attic. (6 CR 5437, 5524-5525.) Conversely, Wohlrabe’s expert\n\ntestified that they believed that a habitable attic created a home that is\n\nmore than “one-story in height” within the meaning of the covenants and\n\nthat BCH’s proposed building plans were thus in violation. (2 RR 25-26;\n\n143.)\n\n        Thus, the experts on both sides of this case had their own ideas and\n\nconceptions regarding what they believed was meant by the phrase “one-\n\nstory in height.” (Id.); cf. Johnson, 491 S.W.2d at 197 (“[C]an we say that\n\nthe questioned phrases contained in the restrictive recitations are so clear\n\nthat but one reasonable meaning for each respective phrase has clearly\n\nemerged? The mere reading of the phrases themselves and the reading of\n\n\n                                     27\n\fthe testimony of the experts who attempted to define the same answers the\n\nquestion in the negative.”). This split in expert opinions classically\n\nillustrates the ambiguity of the deed restrictions.\n\n            4.    Testimony from Wohlrabe and Wohlrabe’s expert\n                  further demonstrates the ambiguity of the phrase\n                  “one story in height”\n\n      The ambiguity of the phrase “not to exceed one story in height” in this\n\ncase is manifest by Wohlrabe’s admission at the November 25, 2013\n\ntemporary injunction hearing that if BCH did not finish out the attic, and\n\njust left the exact same size attic unfinished, it would not be a violation of\n\nthe restrictive covenant. (3 SCR 160–61; 166.) The ambiguity is further\n\ndemonstrated in the testimony that was provided by Wohlrabe’s expert,\n\nBob Brendle, who testified at the November 7, 2013 temporary injunction\n\nhearing that if the area in dispute was totally unfinished, but the design and\n\nheight were otherwise the same, the house would only be one-story and the\n\nrestrictive covenants would not be violated. (2 RR 183-184.) Brendle also\n\ntestified similarly in his deposition—an excerpt of which was attached to\n\nBCH’s summary judgment response—that even a building that was 40 feet\n\nhigh could be in compliance with the restrictions if it was only one story. (3\n\nSCR 234.) The obvious purpose of the “not to exceed one story in height”\n\nrestriction is to restrict the height of the exterior of the homes within the\n\n\n                                      28\n\fAddition; the restrictions were not intended to regulate how homeowners\n\nuse the interior of their homes.\n\n      Accordingly, the meaning of the term “one story in height,” without\n\nfurther definition or specification, is ambiguous. Because it is ambiguous,\n\nthis Court must interpret the restrictive covenants in BCH’s favor, as\n\nambiguity must be resolved in favor of the unrestricted use of the premises.\n\nUnder BCH’s interpretation of the restrictive language, BCH’s building\n\nplans did not violate the restrictive covenants because the phrase “one story\n\nin height” does not restrict a homeowner from building a home with a\n\nfinished/habitable attic space or a second story. Accordingly, Wohlrabe was\n\nnot entitled to summary judgment or a permanent injunction.\n\n      D.    Wohlrabe’s subjective interpretation of the Restrictive\n            Covenant 1 renders it meaningless\n\n      Wherever possible, a covenant should be construed to give effect to all\n\nof the provisions and to avoid rendering any provision meaningless. Crispin\n\nv. Paragon Homes, Inc., 888 S.W.2d 78, 82 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n1994, writ denied). Wohlrabe argues that BCH’s interpretation of\n\nRestrictive Covenant 1 as a “height” restriction, rather than a “story”\n\nrestriction, is not reasonable because it is “nonsensical to say that the\n\ncreators intended to limit the “height” of the homes but then neglected to\n\nprovide a numerical height limitation.” Appellees’ Br. at 37. This is illogical.\n\n                                      29\n\fWohlrabe’s argument that the only reasonable interpretation of the\n\ncovenant as a “story restriction” renders the covenant’s “in height” language\n\nsuperfluous and meaningless. This is in direct contradiction to the clear\n\nrule prohibiting an interpretation that renders language in covenants\n\nmeaningless.\n\n      The fact that the restriction could reasonably be interpreted as either\n\na “story” or “height” restriction leads to the only logical conclusion—that\n\nthe language in Restrictive Covenant 1 is ambiguous because it is subject to\n\nmore than one reasonable interpretation. Consequently, the covenant must\n\nbe interpreted strictly against Wohlrabe and in favor of the free and\n\nunrestricted use of the land. That is, the covenants must be construed in\n\nline with BCH’s interpretation—the practical result of which being that\n\nBCH’s proposed building plans are deemed not in violation of Restrictive\n\nCovenant 1.\n\nII.   BCH’s affirmative defenses of impossibility, waiver,\n      estoppel, and unclean hands precluded summary judgment\n\n      A.      The trial court erred in granting summary judgment\n              and denying BCH’s Motion to Reconsider because\n              there was a fact issue on BCH’s affirmative defense of\n              impossibility\n\n      The restrictive covenants at issue charge the ACC with the\n\nresponsibility of approving and disapproving building plans for homes\n\n\n                                     30\n\fwithin the Addition. Part of the criteria considered by the ACC must be\n\nwhether the plan complied with the restrictive covenants.\n\n     In this case, the ACC is clearly necessary for performance of BCH’s\n\nobligations under Paragraphs 8-10 of the deed restrictions. Specifically,\n\nparagraphs 8, 9, and 10 of the deed restrictions provide that the ACC is the\n\nonly entity that has the power to approve or disapprove of “constriction\n\nplans and specifications” based on “quality of workmanship and materials,\n\nharmony of external design with existing structures, and as to the location\n\nwith respect to topography and finish grade elevation.” (14 RR 304-305.)\n\nFurther, in the event the ACC, or its designated representative, fails to\n\napprove or disapprove within 30 days after plans and specification have\n\nbeen submitted to it, or in any event, if no suit to enjoin the construction\n\nhas been commenced prior to the completion thereof, approval will not be\n\nrequired and the covenants shall be deemed to have been fully complied\n\nwith. (Id.) There is nothing in the deed restrictions that give any of the\n\nhomeowners or the LHPOA the right to bypass or usurp the ACC’s authority\n\nto approve or disapprove of “construction plans and specifications.”\n\n     All members of the ACC are deceased and, at the time BCH completed\n\nits building plans, there was no ACC in existence for BCH to submit its\n\nplans to, as required by the restrictive covenants. (8 CR 6662-6664.) That\n\n\n                                    31\n\fis, it was impossible for BCH to obtain approval, as required by the deed\n\nrestrictions. Accordingly, the doctrine of impossibility excused BCH from\n\nobtaining approval. Further, even if it were possible for BCH to get\n\napproval, the plans were deemed approved because they were sent to the\n\nlisted members of the ACC and no response was received.\n\n     Because the restrictive covenants were impossible to comply with, the\n\ntrial court erred in granting summary judgment and denying BCH’s Motion\n\nto Reconsider.\n\n     B.    The trial court erred in granting summary judgment as\n           to BCH’s waiver defense\n\n     In order to establish the affirmative defense of waiver in a deed\n\nrestriction case, the nonconforming user must prove that violations then-\n\nexisting are so great as to lead the mind of an “average man” to reasonably\n\nconclude that the restriction in question has been abandoned and its\n\nenforcement waived. New Jerusalem Baptist Church, Inc. v. City of\n\nHouston, 598 S.W.2d 666, 669 (Tex. App.—Houston 1980, no writ). Among\n\nthe factors to be considered by the “average man” are the number, nature,\n\nand severity of the then-existing violations, any prior acts of enforcement of\n\nthe restriction, and whether it is still possible to realize to a substantial\n\ndegree the benefits intended through the covenant. Id.\n\n\n\n                                     32\n\f      The majority of Wohlrabe’s argument as to BCH’s waiver defense is\n\nthat only one other house in the Addition violated Restrictive Covenant 1’s\n\nprohibition on two-story homes. However, the ratio of violations to lots\n\nwithin a subdivision is only one factor courts consider when determining\n\nwhether the then-existing violations were so great, such as to support\n\nwaiver. New Jerusalem Baptist Church, Inc., 598 S.W.2d at 669 (listing\n\nother factors such as nature and severity of then-existing violations). Even a\n\nsingle violation can constitute waiver if it is sufficiently severe as to lead an\n\n“average man” to reasonable conclude that the restriction in question has\n\nbeen abandoned. See generally id.\n\n      There is a full two-story home at 6144 Monticello—which is the lot\n\nthat sits directly next to the lot owned by BCH at 6148 Monticello, where\n\nthe proposed home was to be built. (3 RR 109–110; 5 CR 4218.) The home\n\nat 6144 Monticello measures 30.90 feet in height, which is 5 ½ feet higher\n\nthan the home BCH proposed to build on the neighboring lot. (6 CR 5426–\n\n5439, 5490–5494, 5512–5529.) In further contrast to the home proposed in\n\nBCH’s building plans, the two-story house at 6144 Monticello has gabled\n\nwindows on the front of the house in the roof, a second story exterior plate\n\nline, and second story windows that are clearly seen from the exterior of the\n\nhome. (6 CR 5426–5439, 5490–5494, 5512–5529.)\n\n\n                                       33\n\f     The second floor addition and second floor plate lines at 6144\n\nMonticello are far more significant and substantial than the alleged breach\n\npresented by BCH’s building plans. That is, the impact of the full second\n\nstory at 6144 Monticello on the neighborhood was far greater than any\n\nimpact that could result from BCH’s proposed building plans. On this basis\n\nalone, waiver is supported.\n\n     C.    The trial court erred in granting summary judgment as\n           to BCH’s estoppel defense\n\n     Quasi-estoppel precludes a party from asserting, to another’s\n\ndisadvantage, a right inconsistent with a position previously taken.\n\nCimarron Country Prop. Owners Ass’n v. Keen, 117 S.W.3d 509, 511 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Beaumont 2003, no pet.). The doctrine applies when it would be\n\nunconscionable to allow a party to maintain a position inconsistent with\n\none to which the party acquiesced, or from which the party accepted a\n\nbenefit. Id. (citing Lopez v. Munoz, Hockema & Reed, L.L.P., 22 S.W.3d\n\n857, 864 (Tex. 2000)). Stated another way, the doctrine of quasi-estoppel\n\nprecludes a party, with knowledge of the facts, from taking a position\n\ninconsistent with his or her former position to the disadvantage of another.\n\nSee Stimpson v. Plano Indep. School Dist., 743 S.W.2d 944, 946 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Dallas 1987, writ denied). Unlike equitable estoppel, quasi-estoppel\n\nrequires no showing of a false representation or detrimental reliance. See\n\n                                    34\n\fStimpson, 743 S.W.2d at 946; El Paso Nat’l Bank v. Southwest Numismatic\n\nInv. Grp., Ltd., 548 S.W.2d 942, 948 (Tex. Civ. App.—El Paso 1977, no\n\nwrit.).\n\n      Wohlrabe claims because there is no evidence that any of the\n\nhomeowners “knew” about the restrictions, the elements of quasi-estoppel\n\ncannot be met. However, actual knowledge is not required for a finding of\n\nestoppel. Rather, the knowledge requirement is met by a showing of\n\nconstructive knowledge. See e.g., Nash v. Beckett, 365 S.W.3d 131, 143–44\n\n(Tex. App.—Texarkana 2012, pet. denied). Thus, because subsequent\n\ngrantees are charged with constructive knowledge of restrictive covenants\n\non their properties when those covenants are on file in the county deed\n\nrecords, the property owners in the Addition here had constructive\n\nknowledge of Restrictive Covenant 1. See Musgrave v. Brookhaven Lake\n\nProperty Owners Ass’n, 990 S.W.2d 386 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 1999, pet.\n\ndenied).\n\n      The homeowners within the Addition permitted violations of the\n\nrestrictive covenants to occur for many years without any objection and\n\nmost, if not all, of the homeowners admittedly violated one or more deed\n\nrestrictions Wohlrabe seeks to enforce. (6 CR 5442-5446; 4 RR 14.)\n\nMoreover, most of the homeowners that comprise LHPOA lived in the\n\n\n                                   35\n\fAddition when, for example, the Stillos remodeled their home in violation\n\nof the deed restrictions and when the house at 6144 Monticello was\n\nremodeled into a full two-story home measuring 30.90 feet in height. (2 RR\n\n109-110; 6 RR 5426-5449.) This is a prime example of the type of prior\n\nacquiescence contemplated by the doctrine of quasi-estoppel. Accordingly,\n\nthe trial court erred in granting summary judgment as to BCH’s estoppel\n\ndefense.\n\n     D.    The trial court erred in granting summary judgment as\n           to BCH’s unclean hands defense\n\n     Wohlrabe’s argument that BCH is preclude from asserting unclean\n\nhands because the homeowners did not own the properties at the time the\n\nviolations occurred is inapposite. Because real covenants run with the land,\n\nit is of no consequence to the application of the unclean hands defense that\n\na homeowner did not own the property in question at the time the violation\n\nof the deed restrictions occurred. See Inwood N. Homeowners Ass’n v.\n\nHarris, 736 S.W.2d 632, 635 (Tex. 1987). Rather, because deed restrictions\n\nrun with the land, they are enforceable against a homeowner at any time,\n\nregardless of whether that homeowner owned the property at the time the\n\nviolation occurred. Id.; see also Fallis v. River Mountain Ranch Property\n\nOwners Ass’n. Inc., No. 04-09-00256-CV, 2010 WL 2679997 (Tex. App.—\n\nSan Antonio July 7, 2010, no pet.) (mem. op.) (reasoning that because the\n\n                                    36\n\feasement at issue was similar to a restrictive covenant, it was enforceable at\n\nany time, regardless of whether the homeowner owned the property when\n\nthe violation occurred). Thus, if a party’s culpability for a deed restriction\n\nviolation is not dependent on the party’s possession of the property at the\n\ntime the violation occurred, a party cannot avoid the application of the\n\nunclean hands doctrine by acquiring a property after a violation occurs.\n\nThis long-established rule is actually reflected in the deed restrictions in\n\nthis case, which state that “[i]f the parties hereto, or any of them, or their\n\nheirs or assigns shall violate or attempt to violate any of the covenants\n\nherein, it shall be lawful for any other person or persons owning real\n\nproperty as hereinabove described to prosecute any proceedings at law or in\n\nequity against the person. . .” (14 RR 304.)\n\n      Several of the members comprising LHPOA have admittedly violated\n\nthe deed restrictions at issue. (6 CR 5442-5446; 14 RR 97-106.) In fact,\n\nWohlrabe herself testified at the November 25, 2013 hearing that some of\n\nthe wood siding on the back of her house and garage set-back was in\n\nviolation of the restrictive covenants. (4 RR 14.) Thus, the doctrine of\n\nunclean hands applies, as “[LHPOA] is guilty of the same actions of which\n\n[BCH] is accused.” See Park v. Escalera Ranch Owners’ Ass’n, Inc., 457\n\nS.W.3d 571, 597 (Tex. App.—Austin 2015, no pet.).\n\n\n                                      37\n\fIII. The trial court abused its discretion when it denied BCH’s\n     Motion to Dissolve Due to Changed Circumstances\n\n     A party may move to modify or dissolve a temporary or permanent\n\ninjunction on the grounds of changed circumstances or fundamental error.\n\nUniversal Health Servs., Inc. v. Thompson, 24 S.W.3d 570, 580 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Austin 2000). The purpose of a motion to dissolve is to provide a\n\nmeans to show that changed circumstances require modification or\n\ndissolution of the injunction. Id. Changed circumstances are conditions\n\nthat either alter the status quo after the issuance of the injunction or make\n\nthe injunction unnecessary or improper. Chase Manhattan Bank v. Bowles,\n\n52 S.W.3d 871, 879 (Tex. App.—Waco 2001, no pet.).\n\n     It is common for deed restrictions to contain provisions providing\n\nthat if building plans or specifications are not approved in writing by the\n\nACC by a certain number of days, the plans or specifications are deemed\n\napproved by the ACC. While Wohlrabe claims the ACC does not have the\n\npower to approve plans that violate the restrictive covenants, the Texas\n\nSupreme Court has held that such provisions are recognized to be “default\n\nconsequences in the event the ACC does not act swiftly enough.” Pilarcik,\n\n966 S.W.2d at 40, n.3.\n\n     Wohlrabe contends there were no changed circumstances to support\n\ndissolution. However, the record contains evidence that BCH did attempt to\n\n                                     38\n\fseek ACC approval by mailing their building plans to the named ACC\n\nmembers set out in the covenants, but that BCH received no response. (8\n\nCR 6554, 6623-6635, 6661-6664.) Thus, BCH’s construction plans were\n\ndeemed approved, as the 30-day window in which the ACC could\n\ndisapprove closed with BCH receiving no response. (8 CR 6345-6471.)\n\nThese changed circumstances rendered the permanent injunction invalid\n\nand improper due to the doctrine of deemed approval. Accordingly, the trial\n\ncourt abused its discretion when it denied BCH’s Motion to Dissolve.\n\nIV.   The trial court erred when it granted summary judgment as\n      to BCH’s counter claims against Wohlrabe and the other\n      members of the LHPOA\n\n      Even if BCH’s counterclaims against Wohlrabe were barred at the\n\ntime originally asserted, on January 9, 2014, Wohlrabe and the other\n\nmembers of the LHPOA asserted affirmative claims against BCH. (4 CR\n\n2728–2744.) These affirmative claims sought a declaratory judgment that\n\nWohlrabe and the other members did not violate the very deed restrictions\n\nthat BCH alleged they did violate. Because Wohlrabe and the other\n\nmembers initiated this action for affirmative relief against Blanchard on\n\nJanuary 9, 2014, BCH could then assert any counterclaims or cross-claim\n\nagainst Wohlrabe and the other members arising out of the same\n\ntransaction or occurrence, so long as it did so “not later than the 30th day\n\n\n                                    39\n\fafter the date on which the party’s answer is required.” Tex. Civ. Prac. &\n\nRem. Code § 16.069. BCH’s live pleading at that time already asserted its\n\nclaim for affirmative relief against Wohlrabe and the other members, and\n\nthat claim for affirmative relief arose out of the very deed restriction\n\nviolations that Wohlrabe and the other members’ affirmative claim\n\naddressed. So, BCH’s claim against Wohlrabe and the other members arose\n\nout of the same transaction or occurrence as Wohlrabe and the other\n\nmembers’ affirmative claims against BCH. Fallis v. River Mountain Ranch\n\nProp. Owners Ass’n, No. 04-09-00256-CV, 2010 WL 2679997, at *7–8\n\n(Tex. App.—San Antonio July 7, 2010, no pet.) And it was asserted “not\n\nlater than the 30th day after the date on which the party’s answer was\n\nrequired.” Thus, BCH’s claims are not time barred by the statute of\n\nlimitations. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 16.069.\n\n                             CONCLUSION\n\n     There was no basis to grant summary judgment against BCH. The\n\ntrial court erred in doing so. But the problem was deeper than simply an\n\nerroneous grant of summary judgment.\n\n     As argued extensively in a companion mandamus filed by BCH and\n\ngranted by this Court, the “fix is in” in the trial court. See In re BCH\n\nDevelopment, LLC, No. 05-16-01481-CV (Tex. App.—Dallas); (Apx. Tab 1,\n\n\n                                    40\n\fPetition for Writ of Mandamus); see also In re BCH Dev., LLC, 525 S.W.3d\n\n920 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2017) (orig. proceeding) (Apx. Tab 2). The Court\n\nshould reverse the summary judgment. But absent firm guidance from this\n\nCourt, the trial court is likely to find a way to grant another one.\n\n\n\n\n                                       41\n\f                           PRAYER\n\nAppellant BCH Development, LLC prays that the Court:\n\n(1)   reverse the trial court’s orders granting summary judgment\n      signed on March 27, 2014; August 27, 2014; January 21, 2015;\n      February 24, 2015; March 9, 2015;\n(2)   reverse the trial court’s order denying BCH’s Motion to\n      Reconsider the granting of Wohlrabe’s Motion for Summary\n      Judgment;\n(3)   reverse the trial court’s order granting Wohlrabe and the\n      LHPOA’s application for permanent injunction and dissolve the\n      permanent injunction against BCH;\n(4)   reverse the trial court’s orders granting summary judgment\n      against BCH’s counterclaims for breach of restrictive covenants\n      against the 27 individual homeowners;\n(5)   reverse the trial court’s order denying BCH’s Motion to Dissolve;\n(6)   reverse the trial court’s judgment as to Wohlrabe, including\n      award of attorney’s fees and costs;\n(7)   award costs for prevailing on appeal and any other relief to which\n      Appellant BCH Development, LLC is entitled.\n\n\n\n\n                               42\n\fRespectfully submitted,\n\n\n/s/ Shelby G.

The Trial Court Ignores the Jury Verdict ................................. 24\n\nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT.............................................................. 24\n\nARGUMENT................................................................................................ 27\n\n        I.      Mandamus relief is available and necessary to review a\n                trial court’s order granting a new trial on legally invalid\n                grounds. .................................................................................... 27\n\n                A.      Mandamus may issue to reverse a court’s order\n                        granting a new trial on unstated or legally invalid\n                        grounds. .......................................................................... 27\n\n                B.      The trial court’s order granting a new trial on\n                        attorney’s fees has left BCH without an adequate\n                        remedy on appeal. ........................................................... 29\n\n        II.     Granting new trial for BCH’s purportedly improper\n                questions and argument is a legally invalid ground. ................ 30\n\n                                                      4\n\n                                                    TAB 1\n\fA.   To preserve error for evidence or argument, a party\n     must timely object, obtain a ruling, and request an\n     instruction to disregard, unless it is incurable. ................31\n\nB.   The trial court clearly abused its discretion in\n     granting a new trial for purported violations of the\n     limine orders. .................................................................. 33\n\n     1.      Purported violations of the limine order on\n             the law of block billing did not justify a new\n             trial......................................................................... 35\n     2.      Eliciting testimony regarding the\n             unreasonableness of the hours billed did not\n             justify a new trial. .................................................. 39\n     3.      Arguing a floor on attorney’s fees of $150,000\n             in closing argument did not justify a new trial. ..... 42\nC.   Other jury arguments by BCH were not improper,\n     not objected to by Wohlrabe, and not incurable. ............ 45\n\n     1.      BCH’s argument that this case was a “money\n             grab” was not improper, was not objected to\n             by Wohlrabe, and was not incurable...................... 46\n     2.      BCH’s argument questioning the formation of\n             the homeowner’s association was not\n             improper, was not objected to by Wohlrabe,\n             and was not incurable. ........................................... 49\n     3.      BCH’s argument regarding the suspect nature\n             of the fee arrangement was not improper, was\n             not objected to by Wohlrabe, and was not\n             incurable. ............................................................... 50\n     4.      BCH’s argument regarding failure to segregate\n             cannot serve as a proper basis for a new trial. ....... 52\nD.   The purported indiscretions by BCH in questions\n     and argument cannot serve as the proper basis for a\n     new trial, individually or cumulatively............................ 53\n\n                                  5\n\n                                 TAB 1\n\f        III.     There was factually sufficient evidence to support the\n                 jury’s award of attorney’s fees in the amount of $290,000. ..... 54\n\n                 A.      It is of no consequence that the amount $290,000\n                         was not uttered specifically by a witness. ........................ 55\n\n                 B.      The attorney’s fees sought by Wohlrabe were\n                         contradicted. ................................................................... 57\n\nCONCLUSION............................................................................................. 62\n\nPRAYER ...................................................................................................... 64\n\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE....................................................................... 65\n\nCERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO TEX.

The mandamus stems solely from a\n                   jury trial on attorney’s fees. Specifically, the trial\n                   court granted summary judgment on Wohlrabe’s\n                   declaratory judgment. (MR Tab D at 4–5.) A jury\n                   trial ensued on attorney’s fees. The jury awarded\n                   $290,000 to Wohlrabe in reasonable attorney’s\n                   fees.

An order granting a new trial must articulate reasons in support that\n\n     are specific and legally correct. Here, the stated bases in the trial\n\n     court’s order granting new trial are summarized as (a) BCH violated\n\n     limine orders in its questions to witnesses, (b) BCH made improper\n\n     jury arguments in closing argument, and (c) the evidence was\n\n     factually insufficient to support the jury’s award of $290,000 in\n\n     attorney’s fees. Did the trial court clearly abuse its discretion\n\n     in granting a new trial, leaving BCH without an adequate\n\n     remedy by appeal, when:\n\n       a. the purported limine violations were not violations or improper\n          at all, were not objected to with a request for an instruction to\n          disregard or motion for mistrial, or were not incurable such that\n          no objection was necessary;\n       b. BCH’s jury arguments, made in large part without any objection\n          from Wohlrabe, were based on inferences drawn from the\n          evidence, and at no time did Wohlrabe request an instruction to\n          disregard or move for mistrial; and\n       c. there was factually sufficient evidence contradicting Wohlrabe’s\n          claim that $579,000 was a reasonable attorney’s fees for the\n          work done on the declaratory judgment claim, and that\n          $290,000 was within the range of a reasonable attorney’s fees\n          for the work?\n\n\n                                   12\n\n                                   TAB 1\n\f                              INTRODUCTION\n\n                  Equal justice under law.\n  Supreme Court Building—Supreme Court of the United States\n\n      As long as the United States Supreme Court has sat in its own\n\nbuilding, these words have served as a beacon over the entrance. The\n\nphrase, based in the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution,\n\nguarantees this inalienable right to all litigants.\n\n      This short phrase is actually two guarantees. First, “equal justice”\n\nseeks to guarantee that no one, in any court, is given preferential treatment.\n\nNot based on wealth. Or race. Or status. Or a judge’s affection for the\n\nlawyers on one side.\n\n      Second, “under law” means subjective notions of fairness do not\n\ntrump established legal principles. In other words, a judge cannot pick the\n\nwinner despite the law compelling a different result.\n\n\n          The right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate.\n                        Tex. Const. art. I, § 15\n\n      Contrary to equal justice under law, the judge in County Court at Law\n\nNo. 1 in Dallas County has administered—throughout the pendency of the\n\nunderlying case—unequal justice above the law. Unequal because the judge\n\nhas played favorites towards one party and her lawyers. Above the law\n\nbecause the judge’s preference for one side has trumped legal principles.\n\n                                       13\n\n                                       TAB 1\n\f      This mandamus does not intend to point out all examples of unequal\n\njustice above the law. It will focus only on one: the trial court’s granting of a\n\nnew trial on attorney’s fees as a result of the jury’s failure to award as much\n\nmoney as the favored party and her attorneys asked the jury to award. This\n\njury trial occurred after the trial court granted summary judgment on the\n\nfavored party’s declaratory judgment claims in a deed restriction case. As\n\nthere were no actual damages claimed, the only issue for jury trial—before\n\nan appeal on the declaratory judgment claims—was attorney’s fees. During\n\npre-trial, the trial court severely hamstrung the disfavored party by limiting\n\nthe matters on which its attorney’s fees’ expert could testify in refuting the\n\nfavored party’s claim for attorney’s fees.\n\n      Given the trial court’s affection for the favored party, the disfavored\n\nparty assumed that every single ruling—discretionary or otherwise—would\n\ngo against it at trial. This would prove to be a correct assumption. But the\n\ndisfavored party nevertheless took solace in trying the attorney’s fees claim\n\nto a jury, for at least four reasons.\n\n      First, the disfavored party would finally be in front of a jury, who\n\ncould administer equal justice under law, without playing favorites.\n\n      Second, the favored party was not seeking actual damages yet was\n\nseeking almost $600,000 in attorney’s fees. Who was the client who had\n\n\n                                        14\n\n                                        TAB 1\n\fincurred these fees? A lawyer at the law firm representing the favored\n\nparty. The lawyer is the client, and the client is the lawyer. Further, the\n\n“client” and “attorney” had a contingency fee agreement, despite this\n\nincestuous relationship and no actual damages.\n\n      Given this arrangement and the exorbitant fees sought, the disfavored\n\nparty liked its chances in arguing this claim for attorney’s fees was nothing\n\nmore than a fee-generating mechanism for the law firm. A “lawyer money\n\ngrab,” if you will.\n\n      Third, the disfavored party liked it chances cross-examining the\n\nfavored party’s attorney’s fees’ expert—an attorney at the law firm where\n\nthe client/lawyer worked. The disfavored party believed they had numerous\n\ncross-examination points—from failing to segregate fees, to block billing\n\n(which prevented the jury from determining recoverable and reasonable\n\nfees), to the inexperience of the favored party’s attorneys in handling deed\n\nrestriction cases.\n\n      Fourth, the disfavored party had its own attorney’s fees expert. He\n\nwas an experienced deed restriction lawyer. He had represented the\n\ndisfavored party in the case. He could speak to handling a deed restriction\n\ncase and what fees would reasonably be expected to be incurred in a typical,\n\neven contentious, case. The disfavored party would present this as a\n\n\n                                     15\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\fsuggested floor on attorney’s fees, leaving the amount to be awarded up to\n\nthe jury.\n\n      With this in mind, the claim for attorney’s fees proceeded to a jury\n\ntrial. The disfavored party was correct in its assumption—every single\n\nruling of substance went against it. But the four above-noted reasons and\n\nstrategies gave it hope that the jury would reduce the fees sought by the\n\nfavored party.\n\n      And this is precisely what happened. A thoughtful jury paid attention\n\nto all the evidence in awarding attorney’s fees. The jury apparently listened\n\nto the relationship between the favored party as the client and as the lawyer\n\nin the case, and the favored party’s attorney’s fees expert as the\n\nclient/lawyer’s boss. The favored party’s expert on attorney’s fees also\n\nreported he was the boss of the favored party’s lead lawyer and that the lead\n\nlawyer answered to him in the case. The jury apparently also listened to\n\ncross-examination of the favored party’s attorney’s fees expert on the\n\naforementioned matters. And the jury heard from the disfavored party’s\n\nattorney’s fees’ expert, who testified what should reasonably be incurred in\n\nterms of hours spent by lawyers in prosecuting a typical, albeit contentious,\n\ndeed restriction case. Finally, the jury apparently listened to closing\n\n\n\n\n                                     16\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\farguments, in which the disfavored party argued that this arrangement and\n\nthe attorney’s fees sought reflected a “lawyer money grab.”\n\n     What did the jury do with this evidence? Essentially it awarded\n\nattorney’s fees in an amount in between what the favored party advocated,\n\nand what the disfavored party asked that it consider. More than the floor.\n\nLess than the ceiling. The jury awarded $290,000, to be precise.\n\n\n      Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\n                    Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\n     All that appeared to be left after the jury’s verdict on attorney’s fees\n\nwas entering judgment. The claims for declaratory relief were already\n\ndecided—in favor of the favored party—on summary judgment. Once a\n\njudgment was entered on the jury verdict on attorney’s fees, the parties\n\ncould appeal as they saw fit, on all issues ranging from the declaratory\n\njudgment to attorney’s fees.\n\n     The disfavored party filed a motion for entry of judgment simply\n\nseeking entry of judgment on the jury verdict. The favored party sought a\n\njudgment notwithstanding the verdict, or alternatively a new trial, arguing\n\nthat the jury didn’t award enough in attorney’s fees.\n\n     The trial court heard these motions together, taking them under\n\nadvisement. By order entered September 21, 2016, the trial court granted\n\n\n                                     17\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\fthe favored party’s motion for new trial. The order granting a new trial on\n\nattorney’s fees can be summarized as stating three (albeit improper)\n\ngrounds.\n\n     First, the disfavored party supposedly elicited testimony on a lowered\n\namount of attorney’s fees that was not allowed based on the court’s rulings\n\nthroughout trial against the disfavored party.\n\n     Second, the disfavored party apparently engaged in improper jury\n\nargument by arguing that the claim for attorney’s fees was a “lawyer money\n\ngrab.”\n\n     Third, the jury wasn’t told an exact number that should be the floor\n\non attorney’s fees, and thus was required to award the ceiling. Related, the\n\njury never heard the actual amount it awarded, $290,000, and thus could\n\nnot award this amount.\n\n     The order granting new trial is long. Many “indiscretions” noted in it\n\nwere not objected to by the favored party during trial—including the\n\n“lawyer money grab” jury argument. Others reflect proper lines of\n\nquestioning and argument in a case where attorney’s fees are sought,\n\nparticularly when approximately $580,000 is sought in fees, the attorney\n\nand the client are the same, and there are no actual damages. Finally, at no\n\n\n\n\n                                     18\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\ftime did the favored party seek a mistrial for these or any other supposed\n\nindiscretions.\n\n      More fundamentally, none of these stated reasons is a proper ground\n\nfor granting a new trial. The trial court clearly abused its discretion in\n\ngranting a new trial on attorney’s fees. The court improperly stripped the\n\njury of its duty in faithfully rendering a verdict.\n\n      In granting a new trial, the trial court ignored equal justice under law.\n\nInstead, it carried out unequal justice above the law. The court’s favoritism\n\nand outcome-determinative approach—all the while stripping the jury of its\n\nverdict on the fact-driven claim of attorney’s fees—should not stand.\n\n      This Court should reverse and render judgment on attorney’s fees\n\nconsistent with the jury’s verdict. Alternatively, the Court should reverse\n\nand instruct the trial court to do so.\n\n                          STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\nI.    The Trial Court Grants Wohlrabe’s Declaratory Judgment\n\n      The underlying case is a deed restriction case. (MR Tab B at 4–10.)\n\nWohlrabe—acting as both a plaintiff and an attorney in the case—created\n\nthe Association and brought suit against BCH and Blanchard Homes, LLC.\n\n(MR Tab B at 18; MR Tab N at 126.) She sought to enforce a deed\n\n\n\n\n                                         19\n\n                                         TAB 1\n\frestriction that prohibited building a house with more than one story. (MR\n\nTab B at 4–5.)\n\n      The case has lingered in the trial court since October 13, 2013. (MR\n\nTab A at 1.) Eventually, Wohlrabe sought a summary judgment on the\n\ndeclaratory judgment. (MR Tab C at 11.) The trial court granted Wohlrabe’s\n\nmotions for summary judgment, including granting a permanent injunction\n\nthat prevented BCH and Blanchard Homes, LLC from building the home in\n\nthe neighborhood. (MR Tab D at 4–5.) This endeavor by Wohlrabe—\n\ncreating a homeowners’ association and seeking a declaratory judgment on\n\nthe deed restrictions—apparently ran up attorney’s fees at her law firm of\n\nalmost $580,000. (MR Tab M at 58–89; MR Tab N at 182.)\n\n      Wohlrabe also originally asserted a claim for tortious interference.\n\n(MR Tab B at 19.) But this is not a claim for which attorney’s fees was\n\navailable. Wohlrabe abandoned this claim before the jury trial on attorney’s\n\nfees. Wohlrabe also nonsuited Blanchard Homes, LLC shortly before the\n\ntrial on attorney’s fees. (MR Tab E at 2; MR Tab F at 1–2.).\n\nII.   The Jury Awards $290,000 in Reasonable Attorney’s Fees\n\n      Sometime after obtaining summary judgment, Wohlrabe proceeded\n\nto a jury trial on attorney’s fees. David Elrod was designated as Wohlrabe’s\n\nexpert on attorney’s fees. (MR Tab H at 2.) Travis Kitchens was designated\n\n\n                                     20\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\fas BCH’s expert to refute Elrod’s testimony and address the reasonableness\n\nof the fees sought by Wohlrabe. (MR Tab G at 20.)\n\n     Elrod is the boss of Wohlrabe and supervises Brian Farlow, lead trial\n\ncounsel for the Association. (MR Tab N at 14.) He testified that his firm—\n\ndespite seeking no actual damages—had a contingency fee agreement with\n\nWohlrabe, the client/attorney. (MR Tab M at 43.) From this arrangement,\n\nElrod testified that $579,954.45 were attorney’s fees attributable to the\n\ndeclaratory judgment claims. (MR Tab M at 91; MR Tab N at 183.) He\n\nfurther testified that segregated amounts were already taken out of this\n\namount. (MR Tab M at 38-39, 43-44, 89-94.) Elrod further stated that the\n\nfees were reasonable in light of the extensive work that had been put into\n\nthe case. (MR Tab N at 79.)\n\n     On cross-examination Elrod admitted that he had never before taken\n\na homeowners’ case on a contingency fee basis. (MR Tab M at 103.) BCH\n\nfurther established that Elrod did not specialize in homeowners’ association\n\ncases, having handled only one of them before. (MR Tab M at 103.) The\n\ncross-examination also involved going through numerous time entries\n\nwhich were so heavily redacted and block billed that it could not reasonably\n\nbe determined (1) whether entries related to the claim for which fees were\n\n\n\n\n                                    21\n\n                                    TAB 1\n\frecoverable, and (2) whether tasks and time spent were reasonable. (MR\n\nTab M at 121–26.)\n\n        In BCH’s case-in-chief, Travis Kitchens testified. (MR N at 54.)\n\nDrawing on the experience gained from handling over two hundred\n\nhomeowners’ cases, Kitchens testified that the billing method and extensive\n\nredactions by Wohlrabe’s law firm made it nearly impossible to determine\n\nwhether the fees had been properly segregated. (MR Tab N at 115.) Kitchens\n\nalso testified that Wohlrabe’s extended delay in filing her motion for\n\nsummary judgment, in which Wohlrabe ultimately prevailed, led to a\n\nsignificant amount of additional, unnecessary work and fees. (MR Tab N at\n\n95–96.) In this regard, Kitchens went through the docket sheet and noted a\n\none-year delay from when summary judgment could have been sought and\n\nwhen summary judgment was sought and granted. (MR Tab N at 79.) The\n\nattorney’s fees during this one-year delay were $361,000. (See MR Tab N at\n\n79; MR Tab O at 1–3.) Subtracted from $579,954.45, this “floor” would be\n\n$218,117.95. For these and other reasons, Kitchens testified that in his\n\nopinion the fees sought by Wohlrabe were unreasonable. (MR Tab N at\n\n154.)\n\n        But he didn’t stop there. He also testified that there is a typical and\n\nreasonable manner in which a deed restriction case, in his vast experience,\n\n\n                                       22\n\n                                       TAB 1\n\fshould be handled. (MR Tab N at 58–105.) Going through task by task, he\n\nexplained a range of hours it should take to handle this type of case, even if\n\ncontentious like this one. (MR Tab N at 97–105.) The outer limit of this\n\nrange totaled 620 hours. (Id.) Using the billable rate of Wohlrabe’s lead\n\ntrial counsel, this outer limit would result in a “floor” of $170,500. (See MR\n\nTab M at 46.) Using the lower limit of the range would result in a much\n\nlower amount more in the range of $150,000. (MR Tab M at 46; MR Tab N\n\nat 97–105.)\n\n      After all evidence, the parties presented closing arguments. (MR Tab\n\nN at 176–198.) Wohlrabe advocated for an award of $579,954.45. (MR Tab\n\nN at 177.)\n\n      BCH argued that the fees sought by Wohlrabe and her law firm\n\nconstituted a “lawyer money grab.” (MR Tab N at 186.) BCH then\n\nadvocated for a lower amount, either as low as the floors or by reducing the\n\nceiling advocated by Wohlrabe. (See MR Tab N at 192.) Counsel for\n\nWohlrabe objected repeatedly to BCH’s arguments, and every objection was\n\nsustained—even when no basis for the objection was stated. (MR Tab N at\n\n186–93.) Notably, though, counsel for Wohlrabe did not object to the\n\nmoney grab argument. (MR Tab N at 186–87.) Also, at no time during\n\nclosing argument did Wohlrabe request an instruction to the jury to\n\n\n                                     23\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\fdisregard or move for a mistrial. (See MR Tab N at 186–93.) In fact, at no\n\ntime throughout the trial did Wohlrabe move for a mistrial, despite the\n\nnumerous claimed indiscretions by BCH.\n\n      After closing arguments, the jury deliberated. The jury rendered a\n\nverdict that awarded Wohlrabe $290,000 in reasonable attorney’s fees.\n\n(MR Tab Tab I at 3.)\n\nIII. The Trial Court Ignores the Jury Verdict\n\n      The trial court ignored the jury’s verdict, granting a new trial for\n\nWohlrabe on attorney’s fees. (MR Tab L at 6; Apx. 1 at 6.) In its order, the\n\ncourt advocated that violations of the court’s limine order and part of BCH’s\n\njury argument were improper, incurable, and likely led to an improper\n\nverdict. (MR Tab L at 5; Apx. 1 at 5.) The order further stated that the\n\nevidence was factually insufficient for the jury to only award $290,000.\n\n(MR Tab L at 5; Apx. 1 at 5.)\n\n                   SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n      When a trial court grants a new trial on legally invalid grounds,\n\ncourts of appeals may conduct a “merits review” of the correctness of the\n\nnew trial order. Here, the trial court granted Wohlrabe’s motion for new\n\ntrial, stating that violations of the court’s limine orders and improper jury\n\narguments likely led to the rendition of an improper judgment. The court\n\n\n                                     24\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\falso stated that a new trial was appropriate because the evidence was\n\nfactually insufficient to support the jury’s verdict. These grounds,\n\nindividually or collectively, are legally incorrect and do not support\n\nproperly granting a new trial.\n\n      As to the limine orders, purported violations were not valid grounds\n\nfor the grant of new trial because a limine violation alone is inadequate to\n\nsupport the drastic act of throwing out a jury’s verdict. Further, it is\n\nquestionable at best that BCH even violated the limine orders, as the trial\n\ncourt’s erratic rulings were inconsistent and outside the orders’ parameters.\n\nBut even assuming BCH violated the court’s limine orders, the violations\n\nwere curable, and Wohlrabe failed to preserve error by properly objecting,\n\nrequesting an instruction to disregard, and seeking a mistrial.\n\n      As to the jury arguments made by BCH, they similarly cannot serve as\n\na proper basis for a new trial because they were neither improper nor\n\nincurable. In contrast, BCH’s arguments were based on inferences properly\n\ndrawn from the evidence. Moreover, the arguments were not sufficiently\n\noutrageous to constitute incurable error. Wohlrabe failed to object to all but\n\none of these arguments, and did not request an instruction to disgreard or\n\nmove for mistrial as to any of them. Thus, error was not preserved as to any\n\nof BCH’s jury arguments.\n\n\n                                     25\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\f      Finally, the evidence was factually sufficient to support the jury’s\n\nverdict. Specifically, BCH presented factually sufficient evidence that the\n\nfees sought by Wohlrabe were unreasonable. BCH did so by cross-\n\nexamining Wohlrabe’s expert on attorney’s fees. It also did so by presenting\n\ntestimony from its own expert on attorney’s fees, from which two methods\n\nto calculate a floor on attorney’s fees were presented to the jury. From this\n\nevidence, the jury could (1) award Wohlrabe the fees sought; (2) reduce\n\nthese fees sought; (3) award one of the “floor” amounts; or (4) award fees in\n\nbetween the ceiling and the floor. The jury chose option four, and acted\n\nwithin its purview in doing so.\n\n      The trial court clearly abused its discretion in granting a new trial\n\nbecause the court failed to articulate any legally valid ground supporting a\n\ngrant of new trial. Accordingly, this Court should reverse the trial court’s\n\norder and reinstate the jury’s verdict.\n\n\n\n\n                                      26\n\n                                      TAB 1\n\f                                ARGUMENT\n\nI.    Mandamus relief is available and necessary to review a trial\n      court’s order granting a new trial on legally invalid\n      grounds.\n\n      A.    Mandamus may issue to reverse a court’s order\n            granting a new trial on unstated or legally invalid\n            grounds.\n\n      Trial courts used to have broad discretion to grant new trials for\n\nvirtually any or no stated reason. Stated another way, the trial court was not\n\nrequired to state a reason for granting new trial, much less a legally sound\n\nreason.\n\n      This broad discretion, however, was restricted by the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt in 2009. See In re Columbia Med. Ctr. of Las Colinas, Sub., L.P., 290\n\nS.W.3d 204, 210, 213 (Tex. 2009) (orig. proceeding). The Court in\n\nColumbia held that a trial court abuses its discretion by granting a motion\n\nfor new trial without providing a reasonably specific reason for setting aside\n\nthe jury’s verdict. Id. (“The trial court’s action in failing to give its reasons\n\nfor disregarding the jury’s verdict as to Columbia was arbitrary and an\n\nabuse of discretion.”).\n\n      Four years later, the Texas Supreme Court further expanded\n\nmandamus review of orders granting new trials in holding that an appellate\n\ncourt may conduct a “merits review” of the correctness of a new trial order.\n\nIn re Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A, Inc., 407 S.W.3d 746, 757–59 (Tex. 2013)\n                                       27\n\n                                       TAB 1\n\f(orig. proceeding) (stating that a new trial order cannot stand if the court’s\n\narticulated reasons are not supported by the underlying record). The Court\n\nreasoned that “[s]imply articulating understandable, reasonably specific,\n\nand legally appropriate reasons is not enough: the reasons must be valid\n\nand correct.” Id. at 759.\n\n      Requiring increased specificity and legal correctness protects a\n\nlitigant’s right to a jury trial by ensuring a trial judge cannot set aside a\n\nverdict simply because the judge sees the evidence differently. Columbia,\n\n290 S.W.3d at 212 (quoting Scott v. Monsanto Co., 868 F.2d 786, 791 (5th\n\nCir. 1989) (stating that “a trial court’s discretion in granting a new trial is\n\nnot ‘impenetrable’ and that ‘careful scrutiny given to orders of new trials is\n\nintended to assure that the court does not simply substitute [its] judgment\n\nfor that of the jury.’”)). It also protects against a rogue judge playing\n\nfavorites and showing outcome-determinative preferences to one side by\n\ngiving a litigant multiple bites at the apple with unjustified new trials.\n\n      Since Columbia and Toyota, appellate courts—including this Court—\n\nhave granted mandamus relief in reversing trial court orders granting new\n\ntrials on unspecified or legally invalid grounds. See, e.g., In re Zimmer,\n\nInc., 451 S.W.3d 893, 900 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2014, orig. proceeding); In re\n\n\n\n\n                                      28\n\n                                       TAB 1\n\fWyatt Field Serv. Co., 454 S.W.3d 145, 149 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th\n\nDist.] 2014, orig. proceeding).\n\n      B.    The trial court’s order granting a new trial on\n            attorney’s fees has left BCH without an adequate\n            remedy on appeal.\n\n      The two requisites for obtaining mandamus relief for an improper\n\ngrant of new trial are the same as for any mandamus: (1) the trial court\n\nclearly abused its discretion and (2) there is no adequate remedy by appeal.\n\nIn re Reece, 341 S.W.3d 360, 364 (Tex. 2011). A trial court clearly abuses its\n\ndiscretion when its decision is so arbitrary and unreasonable as to amount\n\nto a clear and prejudicial error of law, or if it fails to analyze or apply the\n\nlaw correctly. See In re Cerberus Capital Mgmt. L.P., 164 S.W.3d 379, 382\n\n(Tex. 2005). Here, the trial court clearly abused its discretion when it\n\ngranted Wohlrabe’s Motion for New Trial on legally invalid grounds.\n\n      As to the second element, the long-established rule in Texas—that an\n\norder granting a motion for new trial generally is not subject to appellate\n\nreview—ended with Columbia and Toyota. See Columbia, 290 S.W.3d at\n\n209 (reasoning that absent mandamus review, Columbia would have no\n\nappellate review of the order granting new trial). Now, a litigant lacks an\n\nadequate remedy by appeal when the order granting new trial either\n\n\n\n\n                                      29\n\n                                      TAB 1\n\f(1) does not state the reasons or (2) states legally or factually invalid\n\nreasons. Id.\n\n      The latter basis leaves BCH with no adequate remedy by appeal here.\n\nAlso, affording Wohlrabe a new trial on attorney’s fees would provide her\n\ntwo bites at the apple, on grounds that were legally invalid.\n\nII.   Granting new trial for BCH’s purportedly improper\n      questions and argument is a legally invalid ground.\n\n      In its order granting new trial, the trial court documented a laundry\n\nlist of supposed instances in which BCH violated the court’s supplemental\n\nlimine order and made improper jury arguments. For example, the court\n\nsaid BCH violated the trial court’s limine order by presenting testimony and\n\nargument regarding (1) the number of hours BCH’s expert believed would\n\nhave been reasonable and (2) BCH’s assertions that $150,000.00 was a\n\nreasonable attorney’s fee.\n\n      The court further noted that certain parts of BCH’s jury argument\n\ncaused incurable harm, including argument that: (1) the case was about a\n\n“lawyer money grab”; (2) attacked the creation of an association by some\n\nproperty owners; (3) criticized counsel for the Association’s use of block\n\nbilling as preventing scrutiny of the billing entries; and (4) counsel for the\n\nAssociation’s failure to segregate entries related to a cause of action that\n\nwas dropped (and for which attorney’s fees were not recoverable).\n\n                                      30\n\n                                      TAB 1\n\f      Each of these grounds is legally invalid and cannot support the proper\n\ngrant of new trial for three reasons. First, BCH did not violate the limine\n\norder. Second, most of the purportedly improper jury arguments were not\n\nobjected to and were not incurable. Third, for those jury arguments that\n\nwere objected to, no mistrial was sought, and these arguments were not\n\nincurable.\n\n      A.     To preserve error for evidence or argument, a party\n             must timely object, obtain a ruling, and request an\n             instruction to disregard, unless it is incurable.\n\n      When improper testimony or argument reaches the jury, the party\n\nopposing the evidence or argument generally must object and obtain a\n\nruling. One Call Sys. v. Houston Lighting & Power, 936 S.W.2d 673, 677\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1996, writ denied); Hur v. City of\n\nMesquite, 893 S.W.2d 227, 231 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 1995, writ denied). To\n\npursue a ruling, a party must first make a proper and specific objection to\n\nthe evidence or argument presented. If the court overrules the objection,\n\nthe error is preserved and no further action need be taken. Lone Star Ford,\n\nInc. v. Carter, 848 S.W.2d 850, 854 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1993,\n\nno writ).\n\n      But if the court sustains a timely objection, the objecting party must\n\nthen ask the court to instruct the jury to disregard the evidence. State Bar\n\n\n                                    31\n\n                                    TAB 1\n\fof Tex. v. Evans, 774 S.W.2d 656, 658 n. 6 (Tex. 1989). Additionally, once\n\nthe court sustains the objection and instructs the jury to disregard, the\n\nparty must then move for mistrial in order to later seek a new trial as a\n\nresult of the improper question or argument. See Hur, 893 S.W.2d at 231–\n\n32; Ortiz v. Ford Motor Credit Co., 859 S.W.2d 73, 77–78 (Tex. App.—\n\nCorpus Christi 1993, writ denied).\n\n     If a party fails to follow these steps, the party generally waives any\n\nobjection to the error. The exception is when an improper line of questions\n\nor argument is incurable. The instances of Texas courts finding questions or\n\nargument incurable are rare. What does not suffice as incurable is merely\n\nviolating a limine order or a rule of evidence in introducing evidence or\n\nmaking an argument. What might suffice as incurable is argument violating\n\nall bounds of decency. Instances of such incurable argument include racial\n\nattacks or comparing a party to a genocidal murderer like Hitler. See, e.g.,\n\nLiving Ctrs. of Tex., Inc. v. Penalver, 256 S.W.3d 678, 680 (Tex. 2008).\n\n     In granting a new trial, the trial court cited multiple instances where\n\nallegedly improper argument and testimony were permitted to reach the\n\njury. Notwithstanding, Wohlrabe only requested a curative instruction for\n\none of these. Moreover, Wohlrabe did not at any time move for a mistrial.\n\nConsequently, Wohlrabe failed to preserve error as to any of the allegedly\n\n\n                                     32\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\fimproper testimony or jury argument, unless the arguments were\n\nincurable. See Hur, 893 S.W.2d at 231-32; Ortiz, 859 S.W.2d at 77-78. To\n\nfind these arguments incurable would set a dangerously low bar for\n\nincurable arguments that no Texas court has dared approach.\n\n      B.    The trial court clearly abused its discretion in granting\n            a new trial for purported violations of the limine\n            orders.\n\n      When evidence or argument is placed before the jury in violation of a\n\nmotion in limine, an instruction to disregard is generally sufficient to cure\n\nthe error. In re Wyatt Field Serv. Co., 454 S.W.3d 145, 161 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2014, orig. proceeding). While curable violations\n\nrequire counsel to object and pursue an adverse ruling to preserve error (or\n\nobject and request an instruction to disregard if the objection is sustained),\n\nincurable violations may serve as the basis for a new trial even if not\n\nproperly preserved. See Wyatt Field Serv. Co., 454 S.W.3d at 161; Nat. Un.\n\nFire Ins. v. Kwiatkowski, 915 S.W.2d 662, 664–65 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 1996, no writ).\n\n      When conducting appellate review of the purported violation of a\n\nlimine order, the appellate court will determine whether the instruction\n\nissued by the trial court was sufficient to cure the error. In re City of\n\nHouston, 418 S.W.3d 388, 397 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2013, orig.\n\n\n                                     33\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\fproceeding). But when a curative instruction is neither requested nor\n\nissued, a curable violation is waived and cannot serve as a proper basis for\n\ngranting a new trial. Wyatt Field Serv. Co., 454 S.W.3d at 161.\n\n      The trial court below issued three supplemental limine orders. The\n\nfirst order instructs the parties not to argue any law prohibiting block\n\nbilling:\n\n      [a]ny testimony, evidence, or argument that any law requires a\n      party seeking to recover attorney fee statements which utilize\n      task billing, i.e., which reflect the amount of time spent on each\n      task performed by the attorney, paralegal, legal assistant, or any\n      law that prohibits block billing.\n\n(MR Tab N at 13.)\n\n      The second and third orders limit the matters over which BCH’s\n\nexpert was permitted to testify:\n\n      [h]e can opine that he thinks that the amount that was disclosed\n      is improper. . . . [H]e can also opine as to why he thinks that,\n      but he cannot opine as to what he thinks an appropriate\n      number would have been. . . . He can testify to hours, but\n      not amounts.\n\n(MR Tab N at 51, 53) (emphasis added.)\n\n      In its order granting new trial, the court stated that BCH made\n\narguments and elicited testimony violating all three of these supplemental\n\nlimine orders. (MR Tab L at 2; Apx. 1 at 2.) It is questionable at best that\n\nBCH violated these limine orders. But either way, Wohlrabe waived error\n\n\n                                     34\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\fby failing to ask for a curative instruction. Nor did Wohlrabe ever move for\n\na mistrial at any time during the trial. Even when taken cumulatively, none\n\nof the alleged violations constitute incurable error; thus, there is no basis\n\nfor granting a new trial.\n\n            1.     Purported violations of the limine order on the\n                   law of block billing did not justify a new trial.\n\n      BCH did not violate the court’s supplemental limine order regarding\n\nblock billing. Specifically, the supplemental order precluded BCH from\n\nascertaining or arguing “that any law requires” the use of task billing or\n\nprohibits block billing. (MR Tab N at 13.) After the court’s issuance of this\n\norder, however, the record is bereft of testimony or argument regarding any\n\nsuch matter.\n\n      In this regard, the following excerpts of the record comprise the\n\nentirety of the block billing testimony and argument that occurred after the\n\nissuance of the court’s supplemental order. During the direct examination\n\nof BCH’s expert witness, there were three different occasions where counsel\n\nfor Wohlrabe objected to testimony regarding the impact of block billing:\n\n      Q:    (By Mr. Yanof) If you do not itemize each amount and\n      instead simply block bill amounts, does that make it –– well,\n      what does that do to your bill?\n\n      Mr. Farlow:    Objection, Your Honor. This is – –\n\n      The Court:    Sustained.\n\n                                     35\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\f(MR Tab N at 63.)\n\n                                      ***\n     Q: So you bill each single thing you do, and then put the actual\n     time spent next to it?\n\n     A:   Yes, sir.\n\n     Mr. Farlow:       Objection, Your Honor, relevance.\n\n     The Court:       Sustained.\n\n(MR Tab N at 65–66.)\n\n                                      ***\n     Q:      (By Mr. Yanof)        In looking through these bills, Mr.\n     Kitchens, can you figure out whether any of the research done\n     was devoted to the tortious interference claim, a claim on which\n     plaintiffs could not recover attorneys’ fees?\n\n     A:     For the most part, no. If you look at Exhibit 4, the first\n     page, there’s four entries. And on the next page there’s another\n     entry for legal fee. And ––\n\n     Q:   This is the first page of Exhibit 4 – –\n\n     A:   Yes, sir.\n\n     Q:   – – just for reference.\n\n     A: And that doesn’t tell me one way or the other what they’re\n     researching, whether it would be recoverable or not recoverable.\n\n     Mr. Farlow:       Objection, Your Honor. He’s asking the question\n     that – –\n\n     The Court:       Sustained.\n\n\n                                      36\n\n\n                                    TAB 1\n\f(MR Tab N at 84–85.)\n\n      That these objections were sustained shows the favoritism the trial\n\ncourt showed to the favored party, Wohlrabe. For two of the objections,\n\ncounsel did not even state the basis for the objection. For all of them, these\n\nwere proper questions.\n\n      But more to the point, these questions did not ask the witness to\n\ncomment on the law of task or block billing. Rather, they properly asked\n\nabout the limitations that block billing places on scrutinizing bills to\n\ndetermine reasonable attorney’s fees attributable to a recoverable claim.\n\n      A similar sequence played out in closing arguments. That is,\n\nWohlrabe objected to jury argument addressing the implications of block or\n\ntask billing:\n\n      They bill – – if we can look at the bill, the way they did it, they\n      chose to do this. You heard Mr. Elrod testify he could have done\n      it either way. He could have – – he could have billed – –\n\n      Mr. Farlow:      You Honor, objection. I’m sorry. This is going\n      into the – –\n\n      The Court:     Be careful, Mr. Culpepper.\n\n      Mr. Culpepper:      All I’m – – my only statement is if you – –\n      from these bills, you can’t determine how much time they spent.\n      You heard Mr. Kitchens say he sends his client itemized bills.\n      He can’t determine it. You can’t – – the other expert can’t\n      segregate.\n\n      Mr. Farlow:     Objection.\n\n                                      37\n\n                                      TAB 1\n\f      The Court:    Sustained.\n\n(MR Tab N at 188–89.)\n\n      Again, Wohlrabe’s counsel failed to state the basis for his objection.\n\nMore importantly, this argument had nothing to do with “the law” of block\n\nor task billing. Instead, it simply makes the point that block billing in this\n\nmanner makes it difficult to segregate recoverable fees from non-\n\nrecoverable fees and to determine whether each task in a block-billed entry\n\nwas reasonable. Because BCH did not violate the supplemental orders in\n\nlimine, “violation” of the court’s limine order regarding block billing cannot\n\nserve as a proper basis for a grant of new trial.\n\n      Yet, even if BCH violated the court’s order, the violations were neither\n\npreserved nor incurable error. In its order granting new trial, the trial court\n\nstated that the testimony and argument made regarding block billing\n\nconstituted incurable error. This means that, assuming BCH violated the\n\nlimine order, the violations were so severe that an instruction to disregard\n\nwould not have cured the violation’s prejudicial effect. The testimony and\n\nargument outlined above, however, are proper, and certainly not so extreme\n\nor shocking that an instruction to disregard would not have been effective.\n\nThus, any violation of the order regarding block billing was curable and\n\n\n\n                                      38\n\n\n                                       TAB 1\n\fmust have been properly preserved in order to serve as a legitimate basis for\n\na grant of new trial.\n\n      Wohlrabe did not preserve error with regard to BCH’s alleged\n\nviolations of the court’s supplemental order because no mistrial was sought.\n\nAt no time during the trial—with all of the alleged indiscretions committed\n\nby BCH—did Wohlrabe move for a mistrial. In fact, the only time an\n\ninstruction was requested was before day two of trial began, and before the\n\ntestimony and argument at issue were presented. Accordingly, this stated\n\nbasis in the order granting new trial is not substantively valid or correct and\n\ncannot support properly granting a new trial.\n\n            2.    Eliciting testimony regarding the\n                  unreasonableness of the hours billed did not\n                  justify a new trial.\n\n      There were multiple instances in this case where BCH attempted to\n\nput on testimony that the hours billed by Wohlrabe attorneys were\n\nunreasonable. While this was not in violation of the limine order on this\n\nmatter—which precluded testimony as to a dollar amount that the expert\n\nthought would be appropriate (MR Tab N at 51, 53)—the court stated in its\n\norder granting new trial that BCH had violated the order many times. The\n\nfollowing excerpts from the record contain the entirety of the expert’s\n\ntestimony in question:\n\n\n                                     39\n\n                                      TAB 1\n\f     Q: But in your experience as a 37-year lawyer handling HOA\n     cases, do you have an opinion about whether the total amount\n     of hours expended by the law firm representing the plaintiff’s\n     was reasonable?\n\n     A:   I have an opinion.\n\n     Q:   What is that opinion?\n\n     A:   It’s unreasonable.\n\n     Q: In your experience as a 37-year lawyer specializing in HOA\n     cases, how many hours do you believe are reasonable in\n     prosecuting a deed restriction case, the claim on which\n     attorney’s fees are recoverable?\n\n     Mr. Farlow:     Objection, Your Honor. That’s the exact – –\n\n     The Court:     Sustained.\n\n(MR Tab N at 89.)\n\n                                    ***\n\n     Q: (By Mr. Yanof) You heard the testimony yesterday that the\n     total amount of hours in this case by plaintiffs’ counsel’s firm,\n     including plaintiff herself, is most – – who has more hours than\n     anybody else us 2,560.50 hours. Do you recall that?\n\n     A:   That’s what their exhibit shows?\n\n     Q:    Have you ever seen that many hours in a deed restriction\n     case?\n\n     Mr. Farlow:     Objection, Your Honor.\n\n     The Court:     Sustained.\n\n(MR Tab N at 97.)\n\n\n                                    40\n\n                                  TAB 1\n\f      For starters, yet again Wohlrabe’s counsel did not state a basis for the\n\nobjection. No matter, the trial court again sustained the objections.\n\n      More fundamentally, in asking the number of hours instead of the\n\ndollar amounts, BCH carefully complied with the trial court’s supplemental\n\nlimine orders (misguided as they were). (MR Tab N at 51, 53.) The trial\n\ncourt continually hamstrung BCH anyway, sustaining objections that did\n\nnot violate the order and without a stated basis. Simply put, if the favored\n\nparty asked for it, the favored party got it.\n\n      Be that as it may, at no point in these exchanges between BCH’s\n\ncounsel and its expert witness did counsel request, or the witness suggest, a\n\nspecific dollar amount that would have been reasonable (as prohibited by\n\nthe limine order). Furthermore, this testimony was directly within the\n\nparameters of the trial court’s instruction that the witness may “testify as to\n\nhours, but not amounts.” (MR Tab N at 51, 53.) Therefore, because there\n\nwas no violation in the first place, a purported violation of this limine order\n\ncannot serve as the basis for a proper grant of a new trial.\n\n      But even if this supplemental limine order was violated, the error was\n\ncurable and not properly preserved. Any error arising from these alleged\n\nviolations was curable because an instruction most assuredly would have\n\neliminated any prejudice created by the purportedly improper questions.\n\n\n                                       41\n\n                                       TAB 1\n\fThis is due in large part to the fact that the witness was not permitted to\n\nprovide an answer to these questions, let alone provide a dollar amount\n\nthat he deemed reasonable for this case. The alleged violations thus did not\n\nconstitute incurable error.\n\n      Because any alleged error related to this particular limine order was\n\ncurable, Wohlrabe’s counsel was required to preserve error by pursuing an\n\nadverse ruling or if sustained, request an instruction. Wohlrabe failed to do\n\nso. Consequently, any error was waived and this ground, as outlined in the\n\ntrial court’s order, cannot support the trial court’s grant of a new trial.\n\n            3.    Arguing a floor on attorney’s fees of $150,000 in\n                  closing argument did not justify a new trial.\n\n      In its order granting new trial, the court stated that BCH violated its\n\npretrial rulings when it argued to the jury that $150,000 as a floor would be\n\na reasonable attorney’s fee to award. (MR Tab L at 2; Apx. 1 at 2.) The basis\n\nfor this jury argument was two-fold.\n\n      First, BCH’s expert, an experienced deed restriction lawyer, opined\n\non the reasonable hours that should be expended in a deed restriction\n\ncase—even a contentious case. (MR Tab N at 98–104.) These hours paled in\n\ncomparison to those expended by Wohlrabe’s law firm, that was\n\ninexperienced in handling deed restriction cases. This range of hours, using\n\nthe hourly rate of Wohlrabe’s law firm, totaled approximately $150,000\n\n                                       42\n\n                                       TAB 1\n\f($170,500 for the high end of the range, and approximately $150,000 or\n\nless for the lower end of the range).\n\n      Second, BCH’s expert testified that Wohlrabe’s law firm should have\n\nmoved the case to conclusion earlier. In direct examination of BCH’s\n\nexpert, he went through the court’s docket and how Wohlrabe could have\n\nreasonably obtained a summary judgment on the merits about a year\n\nearlier, thereby avoiding exorbitant fees incurred by delaying. (MR Tab N at\n\n79-80.) By eliminating the dragged-out litigation, the fees that could have\n\nbeen avoided would reduce the fees recoverable to a little higher floor—to\n\n$218,000.\n\n      To be clear, the jury did not go as low as these floors and award\n\n$150,000-$218,000. But it could have. Conversely, the jury did not award\n\nthe fees Wohlrabe asked the jury to award: $579,954.45. Instead, the jury\n\nawarded $290,000. Less than the ceiling, more than the floor. The jury was\n\nwithin its discretion in doing so. More fundamentally, BCH’s arguing for\n\nthe floor of somewhere in the $150,000 range was proper given the\n\nevidence. No expert or document had to explicitly say the number\n\n$150,000 to properly argue it was a reasonable amount, given the\n\ntestimony cited above. Rather, it was a reasonable inference drawn from\n\n\n\n\n                                        43\n\n                                        TAB 1\n\fthe testimony presented. Further, the supplemental limine order on\n\namounts of fees addresses expert testimony, not jury argument.\n\n      But even assuming arguendo that this argument was improper and\n\nviolated the trial court’s limine orders, it was not properly preserved.\n\nAdmittedly, Wohlrabe’s counsel did object to this jury argument.\n\nPredictably, the trial court sustained the objection for the favored party.\n\n      Notwithstanding, to be a proper basis for a new trial, Wohlrabe had to\n\nrequest a curative instruction or move for a mistrial. See Bishop Abbey\n\nHomes, Ltd. v. Hale, No. 05–14–01137–CV, 2015 WL 9167799, at *11 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Dallas 2015, pet. denied) (reasoning that error as to improper\n\nargument must be preserved by proper objection and request for an\n\ninstruction or mistrial, unless the argument is incurable). Because\n\nWohlrabe did neither, error was not preserved, and the trial court could not\n\nproperly order a new trial on this ground unless the argument was\n\nincurable. It is difficult to conceive how stating a dollar amount is\n\nincurable. When the dollar amount is reasonably inferred from the\n\nevidence, it certainly is not incurable (or improper, for that matter).\n\n      Simply put, granting a new trial based on suggesting $150,000 as a\n\nfloor for reasonable attorney’s fees is legally incorrect and does not justify\n\nthe proper grant of a new trial.\n\n\n                                      44\n\n                                      TAB 1\n\f     C.      Other jury arguments by BCH were not improper, not\n             objected to by Wohlrabe, and not incurable.\n\n     Improper jury argument can result in the later granting of a new trial\n\nonly when it is properly objected to or incurable. See Bishop Abbey Homes,\n\n2015 WL 9167799, at *11. Almost always, to preserve error an objection\n\nmust be asserted because incurable jury argument is rare. Id. Cases finding\n\nincurable harm “typically involved unsubstantiated attacks on the integrity\n\nor veracity of a party or counsel, appeals to racial prejudice, or the like.”\n\nOtis Elevator Co. v. Wood, 436 S.W.2d 324, 333 (Tex. 1968). Said another\n\nway, an argument is only incurable when it is “so extreme that a ‘juror of\n\nordinary intelligence could have been persuaded by that argument to agree\n\nto a verdict contrary to that to which he would have agreed but for such\n\nargument.’” Phillips v. Bramlett, 288 S.W.3d 876, 883 (Tex. 2009)\n\n(quoting Goforth v. Alvey, 271 S.W.2d 404, 404 (1954)).\n\n     In its order granting new trial, the trial court outlined multiple\n\ninstances in which BCH supposedly made improper and incurable jury\n\narguments. Only one of these—failing to segregate—was objected to by\n\nWohlrabe. For all others, error was not preserved unless the argument was\n\nincurable.\n\n\n\n\n                                     45\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\f     None of these arguments was incurable. In fact, BCH’s closing\n\nargument was proper, and certainly a far cry from the sort of outrageous\n\nand extreme argument that typically underlies a finding of incurability.\n\n           1.    BCH’s argument that this case was a “money\n                 grab” was not improper, was not objected to by\n                 Wohlrabe, and was not incurable.\n\n     In its closing argument, counsel for BCH stated that “this case was\n\nabout a lawyer money grab from day one.” (MR Tab N at 186.) In its order\n\ngranting new trial, the court stated that this argument, among others, “had\n\nthe effect of striking at and harming the judicial system itself.” (MR Tab L\n\nat 3; Apx. 1 at 3.) Given the nature of this case, this argument certainly was\n\nnot the kind of extreme argument that classifies as “incurable.”\n\n      Parties are permitted to make arguments based on inferences drawn\n\nfrom the evidence presented at trial. Clark v. Bres, 217 S.W.3d 501, 510\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, pet. dism’d). When doing so, there\n\nis no rule against expressing even a highly unfavorable opinion of an\n\nopposing party or witness. Id. (citing S.W. Greyhound Lines v. Dickson,\n\n236 S.W.2d 115, 118 (Tex, 1951)) (holding that party’s argument that party\n\nwas a “thief, liar, and a fraud” was not improper argument).\n\n     In Bishop Abbey Homes, this Court held that counsel’s comment\n\nduring closing argument regarding “the depth and breadth of the lies” told\n\n\n                                     46\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\fby a witness was not incurable error. Bishop Abbey Homes, Ltd., 2015 WL\n\n9167799, at *13. In so holding, the Court reiterated the proposition that\n\ntrial counsel is given wide latitude in making jury arguments. Id. Because\n\nevidence was presented at trial that the witness may have made false\n\nrepresentations, it was not improper for counsel to argue as to the witness’s\n\ntruthfulness during closing argument. Id. This Court further held that in\n\nany event, any harm caused by the argument could have been cured by an\n\nobjection and instruction by the trial court. Id.\n\n       Here, the sole issue at trial was how much Wohlrabe should recover\n\nin reasonable attorney’s fees. Testimony was presented that Wohlrabe\n\nfailed to segregate fees of the underlying declaratory judgment action from\n\nthe related tort action. (MR Tab N at 80–82.) There was also testimony that\n\nWohlrabe’s delay in filing a motion for summary judgment caused fees to\n\nbe driven up. (MR Tab N at 76–80.) Finally, there was testimony elicited as\n\nto the suspect nature of the contingency fee arrangement between\n\nWohlrabe and her counsel—specifically that such an arrangement in a case\n\nwith no actual damages creates an incentive to drive up fees because they\n\nare the only means of recovery for Wohlrabe’s law firm. (MR Tab N at 105–\n\n07.)\n\n\n\n\n                                      47\n\n                                      TAB 1\n\f      As a result, BCH argued in closing argument that seeking\n\napproximately $580,000 in fees constituted a “lawyer money grab.” (MR\n\nTab N at 186.) Given the evidence, this was not improper jury argument.\n\nRather, it was simply argument that admittedly was argumentative. See\n\nClark, 217 S.W.3d at 510 (“”[S]uch hyperbole for emphasis is an accepted\n\ntechnique of oral advocacy and is part of our legal heritage and tradition.”).\n\n      But even if it was improper argument, Wohlrabe failed to object. (See\n\nMR Tab N at 186–87.) Just as this Court noted in Bishop Abbey Homes,\n\n“[a]ny error or harm occurred from counsel’s use of hyperbole in his\n\ndiscussion could have been cured by an objection and instruction from the\n\ntrial court.” Hale, 2015 WL 9167799, at *13.\n\n      Likewise, BCH’s jury argument was not improper, or at most, curable\n\nerror. Consequently, Wohlrabe was required to properly preserve the error\n\nby a timely objection and request for a curative instruction. Wohlrabe did\n\nneither. Accordingly, BCH’s jury argument that the case was about a\n\n“lawyer money grab” is a legally incorrect ground from which the trial court\n\ncould properly grant a new trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                      48\n\n                                      TAB 1\n\f           2.    BCH’s argument questioning the formation of the\n                 homeowner’s association was not improper, was\n                 not objected to by Wohlrabe, and was not\n                 incurable.\n\n     The trial court also found that BCH’s jury argument “attacking the\n\ncreation of an association” by Wohlrabe—the client and attorney at the\n\nclient’s law firm—was incurable jury argument warranting a new trial. (MR\n\nTab L at 3; Apx. 1 at 3.) The following is the only mention of Wohlrabe\n\ncreating the homeowner’s association during BCH’s closing argument:\n\n“They never needed the homeowner’s association. It wasn’t necessary. It\n\nwas created – – an entity to go sue them and didn’t need [Wohlrabe] to file\n\ntheir lawsuit.” (MR Tab N at 187.)\n\n     This argument emphasized that the client was the attorney and drove\n\nhome the point that the attorney’s fees were unreasonably escalated. There\n\nis nothing improper about this (brief) argument.\n\n     Further, the argument was neither objected to by Wohlrabe nor\n\nincurable. That is, the argument was not so severe or outrageous that it\n\ncould have caused the jury to “agree to a verdict contrary to that to which\n\nhe would have agreed but for such argument.” Phillips v. Bramlett, 288\n\nS.W.3d 876, 883 (Tex. 2009). Therefore, any prejudice incurred by\n\nWohlrabe—due to this brief, three-sentence-long argument—was curable by\n\nan objection and instruction from the trial court to disregard. Because\n\n                                     49\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\fWohlrabe did not object or request such an instruction, much less move for\n\na mistrial, error was not preserved. And if error was not preserved, it could\n\nnot properly serve as a ground for new trial. The trial court clearly abused\n\nits discretion in granting a new trial on this ground.\n\n            3.    BCH’s argument regarding the suspect nature of\n                  the fee arrangement was not improper, was not\n                  objected to by Wohlrabe, and was not incurable.\n\n      The trial court’s order further noted that a new trial was appropriate\n\nbecause BCH made arguments attacking the validity of Wohlrabe’s\n\ncontingency fee arrangement with its counsel. The trial court thus deemed\n\nthe following argument improper and incurable:\n\n            And you heard from Mr. Elrod. He told you on the stand\n      the contingency fee agreements are typically used because\n      somebody can’t pay. Ms. Elrod – – excuse me. Ms. Wohlrabe,\n      according to Mr. Elrod, charges $300 an hour. So I think that\n      she could pay that if she wanted to. Instead, they enter into a\n      contingency fee agreement where all – – the only thing they’re\n      going to collect is attorneys’ fees.\n            So what are they going to do? If it settles day one, they get\n      zero, nothing, nada. The only recovery is the longer the thing\n      goes on and the bigger the attorneys’ fees they jet up, the bigger\n      the award potentially. That’s all there is. That’s all they’re\n      fighting about, attorneys’ fees.\n\n(MR Tab N at 187.)\n\n                                    ***\n            So the agreement is we discussed that contingency fee\n      agreement. Ms. Wohlrabe is never going to have to pay any fees.\n      The homeowners’ association is never going to have to pay any\n      fees. And, again, the only way they recover any fees is if there\n\n                                      50\n\n                                      TAB 1\n\f     are fees to recover. So without creating fees, you’ve got no\n     recovery.\n           And, in fact, as both Mr. Elrod and Mr. Kitchens testified,\n     in a contingency fee agreement, they typically share the\n     recovery. They’re not sharing any recovery with Ms. Wohlrabe\n     or the homeowners’ association with these fees.\n           Now, we talked about budget. Mr. Elrod said, well, by the\n     nature of a contingency fee agreement, he was going to have to\n     be efficient. That was his testimony. I would agree with him in a\n     normal contingency fee agreement where there are actual\n     damages that you’re trying to recover and you’re going to share\n     in those damages because the quicker you end it, the sooner you\n     get the recovery. And as a lawyer, you don’t have to put in as\n     much time in because the less time you put in, the bigger your\n     recovery.\n           Under this contingency fee agreement, the more time he\n     puts in, the more potential recovery for him. It’s the opposite of\n     a typical contingency fee agreement. This contingency fee\n     agreement incentivizes the lawyer’s to spend money, which is\n     the opposite of what Mr. Elrod told you.\n\n(MR Tab N at 189–90.)\n\n     In addition to the incestuous relationship between attorney and\n\nclient, this argument is premised on two undisputed and relevant facts:\n\nthere were no actual damages sought, yet Wohlrabe sought almost\n\n$580,000 in attorney’s fees from a contingency fee agreement. This\n\nrendered the fee agreement an unprecedented one—a contingency fee\n\nagreement where there is no shared recovery, and where recovery requires\n\nchurning up significant attorney’s fees. How is pointing this out to the jury\n\nimproper?\n\n\n\n                                     51\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\f        Also, this lengthy argument was not objected to by Wohlrabe. Thus, it\n\nis waived and cannot be the proper basis for a new trial, unless the\n\nargument was incurable. This argument certainly does not fit within the\n\ncategory of argument that is incurable.\n\n        Rather, this argument was proper, and in any event was neither\n\nobjected to nor incurable. Accordingly, it was legally incorrect for the trial\n\ncourt to grant a new trial on this ground.\n\n             4.      BCH’s argument regarding failure to segregate\n                     cannot serve as a proper basis for a new trial.\n\n        There was one other portion of BCH’s jury argument cited by the trial\n\ncourt in the order granting new trial. Specifically, BCH argued that\n\nWohlrabe failed to properly segregate recoverable fees from nonrecoverable\n\nfees:\n\n              And Mr. Elrod told you, well, I took out $25,000. If you\n        look at the fee statements, remember he had a cause of action,\n        one whole cause of action that he dropped, he couldn’t recover\n        attorney’s fees on. And he’s saying, but that was only $25,000.\n        If you look at the fee statements, you will see that they should\n        have segregated hundreds of thousands of dollars related to that\n        claim. They were going to – –\n\n        Mr. Farlow:    Objection, Your Honor.\n\n        The Court:    Sustained.\n\n(MR Tab N at 190–91.)\n\n\n\n                                      52\n\n                                      TAB 1\n\f      Again, that there was no stated basis for the objection did not stop the\n\ntrial court from sustaining the objection. Further, the jury heard evidence\n\nthat segregation of recoverable fees from non-recoverable fees was required\n\nand that these fees were not sufficiently segregated. (MR Tab N at 81.)\n\nTherefore, argument asserting that the fees were not properly segregated\n\nwas proper.\n\n      But even if this argument was improper, it was curable. Thus,\n\nWohlrabe was required to object and, if sustained, seek a curative\n\ninstruction or move for a mistrial. Otherwise, error is not preserved to later\n\nseek a new trial on this basis.\n\n      Wohlrabe did neither. Instead, Wohlrabe’s counsel merely objected,\n\nstating no basis for the objection, then sat down once the objection was\n\nsustained. Accordingly, any purported error as to this argument was\n\nwaived, and the trial court’s order granting new trial cannot be supported\n\non this ground.\n\n      D.    The purported indiscretions by BCH in questions and\n            argument cannot serve as the proper basis for a new\n            trial, individually or cumulatively.\n\n      Not a single stated basis for granting a new trial was legally\n\nsupportable. Nor did Wohlrabe properly preserve any ground by requesting\n\na curative instruction or seeking a mistrial. Because none of the evidence or\n\n\n                                     53\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\fargument was incurable, error was waived. More fundamentally, every\n\nsingle stated basis in the order granting new trial was proper examination\n\nor argument by BCH.\n\n         Yet Wohlrabe argues that individually and collectively, the stated\n\nbases suffice for granting a new trial. There is no legal basis in Texas\n\njurisprudence for granting a new trial based on cumulative error when each\n\nstated reason is not improper, much less preserved for later seeking a new\n\ntrial.\n\n         The stated bases for granting a new trial are not legally supportable,\n\nindividually or cumulatively. Therefore, the order granting new trial on\n\ngrounds of improper questioning and argument states legally invalid\n\nreasons for granting a new trial.\n\nIII. There was factually sufficient evidence to support the jury’s\n     award of attorney’s fees in the amount of $290,000.\n\n         The trial court seemed persuaded by three arguments from Wohlrabe\n\nregarding the purported factual insufficiency of the amount awarded by the\n\njury. First, no expert uttered the number $290,000. Second, the only\n\nspecific number stated by an expert was $579,954.45. Third, jury argument\n\nsuggesting a floor as low as $150,000 was not supported by the evidence.\n\nNone of these arguments is a proper basis for a new trial.\n\n\n\n                                       54\n\n                                       TAB 1\n\f      The determination of reasonable attorney’s fees is a fact question and\n\n“’the testimony of an interested witness, such as a party to the suit, though\n\nnot contradicted, does no more than raise a fact issue to be determined by\n\nthe jury.” Garcia v. Gomez, 319 S.W.3d 638, 642 (Tex. 2010). There is an\n\nexception to this rule: “where the testimony of an interested witness is not\n\ncontradicted by any other witness, or attendant circumstances, and the\n\nsame is clear, direct and positive, and free from contradiction, inaccuracies,\n\nand circumstances tending to cast suspicion thereon, it is taken as true, as a\n\nmatter of law.” Ragsdale v. Progressive Voters League, 801 S.W.2d 880,\n\n882 (Tex. 1990).\n\n      In other words, when a party puts on evidence that contradicts the\n\nfees sought by the plaintiff—whether by cross-examination of the plaintiff’s\n\nexpert or by presenting its own expert—the trier of fact is not bound to the\n\nnumber provided by the plaintiff’s expert. Powell Elec. Systems, Inc. v.\n\nHewlett Packard Co., 356 S.W.3d 113, 128 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n\nno pet.).\n\n      A.    It is of no consequence that the amount $290,000 was\n            not uttered specifically by a witness.\n\n      In seeking a new trial, Wohlrabe argued that the “only evidence\n\nsubmitted in the case concerning the amount of reasonable fees for the\n\nservices of Plaintiffs’ attorneys through trial was the evidence and\n\n                                     55\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\ftestimony submitted by Plaintiffs.” (See MR Tab J at 3-4.) In reasoning\n\nfurther, the basis for this bold statement is simply that BCH’s expert did not\n\ntestify to a dollar amount.\n\n      But this is of no consequence. If this were the law, then attorney’s fees\n\ncould never be reduced solely on cross-examination of the expert testifying\n\nto attorney’s fees—unless she gratuitously reduced the amount herself. This\n\nis not the law. A party disputing attorney’s fees can put the reasonableness\n\nof certain fees at issue solely based on cross-examination of the expert\n\nseeking fees. See, e.g., Cullins v. Foster, 171 S.W.3d 521, 537-39 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, pet. denied) (rejecting that attorney’s\n\nfees were established as a matter of law where the only witness to testify on\n\nfees was cross-examined on segregation and other issues).\n\n      That is, of course, not what happened here, as BCH’s expert, Mr.\n\nKitchens, testified (1) what fees could have been avoided by seeking\n\nsummary judgment sooner and (2) what the fees would have been in a\n\nusual and customary case based on his experience. Notwithstanding, cross-\n\nexamination of Wohlrabe’s expert, Mr. Elrod, alone would have allowed\n\nreducing the fees, particularly since the jury is the sole judge of the\n\ncredibility of witnesses. See Cullins, 171 S.W.3d at 537-39.\n\n\n\n\n                                      56\n\n                                      TAB 1\n\f      Wohlrabe further argued in the trial court that because there is not\n\nsome reasoning that would support the actual dollar amount awarded by\n\nthe jury, it is not supported. But the case law belies this argument. See, e.g.,\n\nGarcia v. Gomez, 319 S.W.3d 638, 641-42 (Tex. 2010); Powell, 356 S.W.3d\n\nat 127-29.\n\n      A jury can award within a range of fees. This is precisely what the jury\n\ndid here, by either calculation of the suggested floor. Also, if there is\n\nevidence from which the fees sought could be undercut, including solely\n\nfrom cross-examination of the attorney seeking fees, the jury may do so.\n\nSee Powell, 356 S.W.3d at 127-29; Cullins, 171 S.W.3d at 537-39. Such\n\nevidence was abundant here.\n\n      Simply put, the law does not require an amount be specifically uttered\n\nto the jury for the jury to award that amount in attorney’s fees.\n\n      B.     The attorney’s fees sought by Wohlrabe were\n             contradicted.\n\n      That the fees were contradicted is most obviously shown by the\n\ntestimony of Mr. Kitchens, BCH’s expert. But the fees were also\n\ncontradicted by cross-examination of BCH’s expert.\n\n      For example, the jury heard abundant evidence from which it could\n\nhave (and apparently did) view with skepticism Wohlrabe’s exorbitant\n\nclaim for attorney’s fees. This included:\n\n                                      57\n\n                                      TAB 1\n\f        • The initial fee agreement noted that the clients (Wohlrabe and\n          her Association) were being provided services from Wohlrabe\n          pro bono, then suddenly the matter was converted to seek fees\n          (MR Tab N at 71);\n\n        • The fee agreement to which it was converted, in an HOA deed\n          restriction case with no actual damages, was a contingency fee\n          case—something unheard of in an HOA deed restriction case\n          (MR Tab N at 67-68);\n\n        • The redactions and failure to describe for the jury what research\n          was performed specifically in the fee statements did not allow\n          the jury to ascertain what portion of the fees should have been\n          segregated as between recoverable and non-recoverable claims\n          (MR Tab N at 122–23; MR Tab N at 84–88);\n\n        • The redactions and failure to describe for the jury what research\n          was performed specifically in the fee statements did not allow\n          the jury to determine the reasonableness of such entries and\n          fees (Id.); and\n\n        • The client (Wohlrabe and the Association—of which she is the\n          director and set up solely for this litigation) is the attorney, and\n          attorney is the client.\n\n     This evidence undercut Wohlrabe’s claims for the exorbitant amount\n\nof attorney’s fees sought. When combined with credibility issues for\n\nWohlrabe’s attorney’s fees’ expert, there is factually sufficient evidence\n\nsupporting the lower amount awarded by the jury.\n\n     The trial court instructed the jury in its charge that it was “the sole\n\njudges of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given their\n\ntestimony.” (MR Tab I at 1.) Apparently, the jury took this to heart in\n\n\n\n                                     58\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\fawarding an amount lower than what Mr. Elrod told them he wanted and\n\ndeserved.\n\n     More specifically, Mr. Elrod presented with credibility issues. Mind\n\nyou, Mr. Elrod is a fine lawyer who has handled some very significant cases\n\nof very significant value. He certainly testified extensively about his wins\n\nand “notches on his belt.”\n\n     For the jury, though, the problem may have been that in his 38 years\n\nof practicing law, this was only his second HOA case. (MR Tab M at 103.)\n\nFor all the experience Mr. Elrod has, he readily admitted that he has rarely\n\nhandled HOA cases (one other in his career), and does not specialize in this\n\narea. (MR Tab M at 103.)\n\n     From this testimony, it is not a stretch for the jury to conclude his\n\nlack of experience in these types of cases unnecessarily and unreasonably\n\ndrove up the fees. In fact, BCH argued this to the jury in closing arguments.\n\n(MR Tab N at 191.) When combined with the testimony of BCH’s expert\n\nTravis Kitchens—about how a typical case should be handled—this is likely\n\nanother reason the jury reduced the award.\n\n     Specifically, Mr. Kitchens testified on multiple occasions that the fees\n\nsought by Wohlrabe were unreasonable. He also specified the facts and\n\nevidence on which this was based.\n\n\n                                     59\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\f      For starters, Wohlrabe waited well over a year after obtaining a\n\ntemporary injunction to seek a permanent injunction (by summary\n\njudgment). (MR Tab N at 76-80.) Mr. Kitchens testified that this delay\n\nresulted in unnecessary fees from February 2014 (45 days after the\n\ntemporary injunction was granted on December 13, 2013) to February 2015\n\n(when the first summary judgment and permanent injunction was granted).\n\n(Id.) The fees in that time period—taken straight from Wohlrabe’s exhibit\n\nsummarizing the fees by month—total $361,836.50. (See MR Tab N at 79;\n\nMR Tab O at 1–3.) When this amount is subtracted from the amount sought\n\nby Plaintiffs, the modified total is $218,117.95.\n\n      This modified amount of $218,117.95 served as one floor for the\n\naward of attorney’s fees. And under this calculation—firmly supported by\n\nthe evidence—the range of recoverable attorney’s fees (assuming proper\n\nsegregation) is $218,117.95-$579,954.45. The jury’s award of $290,000 is\n\nsquarely within this range.\n\n      But there was another alternative measure from which the jury could\n\nhave reduced fees. Mr. Kitchens testified that there is a typical and\n\nreasonable manner in which to handle an HOA deed restriction case. (MR\n\nTab N at 99-104.) Mr. Kitchens testified that the law is not complex in these\n\ncases. (MR Tab N at 84.)\n\n\n                                      60\n\n                                      TAB 1\n\f      He then explained, from his experience, the usual and customary\n\nmanner in which such cases are handled. (MR Tab N at 99-104.) He\n\ndetailed—task by task—the number of hours it should take to work up such\n\na case. (Id.) If the high end of his range for handling such a case is\n\ncalculated, it totals 620 hours. (Id.) Using Mr. Farlow (lead counsel) and\n\nMs. Wohlrabe’s hourly rate of $275, this totals $170,500. If the lower end of\n\nthe range was used, the figure would drop further—to approximately\n\n$150,000. This amount of $150,000-$170,500 provides a second floor to\n\nwhich the jury could have reduced fees. The jury awarded approximately\n\n$120,000-$140,000 more than this floor in awarding $290,000.\n\n      Wohlrabe does not like the jury award. But there is factually sufficient\n\nevidence to support an award of $290,000.\n\n      Given the battle of experts, cross-examination of Wohlrabe’s expert,\n\nand other evidence regarding the exorbitant fees and incestuous\n\nrelationship between Wohlrabe as client and attorney/her law firm, the jury\n\naward is not so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to\n\nbe clearly wrong and unjust. Cullins v. Foster, 171 S.W.3d 521, 539 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, no pet.). Therefore, granting a new trial\n\nbased on the jury’s award of $290,000 in attorney’s fees is legally invalid.\n\n\n\n\n                                      61\n\n                                      TAB 1\n\f                               CONCLUSION\n\n      In virtually every manner, the trial court played favorites and showed\n\npreference for one side, all the while ignoring established legal principles.\n\nThis is particularly true for the jury trial on attorney’s fees. In doing so, the\n\ntrial court exacted on BCH unequal justice above the law.\n\n      The trial court severely impeded BCH’s ability to examine witnesses,\n\nincluding sustaining objection after objection without Wohlrabe even\n\nstating a basis. The court also found violations of limine orders which did\n\nnot even implicate the orders, much less were improper. Finally, the court\n\ndisallowed closing argument that was proper, and certainly not incurable\n\nsuch that Wohlrabe could fail to object, request a curative instruction, or\n\nseek a mistrial and still preserve error to later seek a new trial.\n\n      Notwithstanding, the jury heard the evidence/arguments and\n\nrendered a verdict on attorney’s fees. There was factually sufficient\n\nevidence to support the verdict.\n\n      Yet the trial court—again administering unequal justice above the\n\nlaw—granted a new trial by an order listing trumped up charges of\n\nindiscretions by BCH. None of these is a proper basis for a new trial, either\n\nbecause the questions or arguments were not improper, or the error was\n\n\n\n\n                                       62\n\n                                       TAB 1\n\fnot preserved (including because the questions and arguments were not\n\nincurable).\n\n      One could ask, what is the harm in conducting a new trial on\n\nattorney’s fees? After all, it would be a short trial on attorney’s fees, then a\n\njudgment entered from which the parties could appeal. The simple answer\n\nis a new trial is not proper. There is no legal basis for the trial court\n\ngranting a new trial.\n\n      But beyond a second trial, what happens next? What if the second\n\njury awards $350,000 in attorney’s fees? Surely, Wohlrabe will seek a third\n\ntrial, and the trial court will undoubtedly grant it. What about if the jury\n\nawards $400,000 at the third trial? Wohlrabe will then seek a fourth trial,\n\nand the trial court will undoubtedly grant it. There are only two ends to to\n\nthis cycle: Wohlrabe finds a jury that is willing to simply rubber-stamp\n\nattorney’s fees of $579,954.45 (or more for each re-trial), or this Court puts\n\nan end to it here.\n\n      This Court should grant mandamus to correct the clear abuses of\n\ndiscretion by the trial court. Specifically, the Court should reverse the order\n\ngranting new trial and render judgment on the jury verdict (or order the\n\ntrial court to do so).\n\n\n\n\n                                      63\n\n                                      TAB 1\n\f                            PRAYER\n\nRelators pray that this Fifth District Court of Appeals:\n\n(1)   grant mandamus relief by finding that the trial court clearly\n      abused its discretion, and has left Relators without an adequate\n      remedy on appeal, in granting Plaintiffs’ motion for new trial;\n\n(2)   reverse the trial court’s Order Granting New Trial and either\n      enter judgment on the jury verdict or order the trial court to do\n      so; and\n\n(3)   award such other relief to which Relator may be entitled.\n\n                              Respectfully submitted,\n\n                              THOMPSON, COE, COUSINS & IRONS,\n                              L.L.P.\n\n\n                              By: /s/ Michael A.

Due to Defendant BCH Development, LLC's failure to make sufficient pre-trial\n\nexpert disclosures as required under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court made various\n\npre-trial rulings excluding and limiting certain expert evidence and testimony, as well as any\n\nreference to such evidence and testimony.            Specifically, the Court prohibited Defendant's\n\nattorney-fee expert from presenting (i) evidence concerning any specific amount of attorney's\n\nfees which Defendant's attorney-fee expert intended to testify was a reasonable amount of fees\n\nfor the services of Plaintiffs' attorneys in this matter, (ii) evidence concerning any specific\n\nnumber of hours which Defendant's attorney fee expert intended to testify was a reasonable\n\nnumber of hours for Plaintiffs' attorneys to have expended in representing the Plaintiffs in this\n\nmatter, (iii) evidence concerning the reasonable fees that are charged in Dallas County, Texas,\n\n(iv) evidence concerning any specific dollar amount of attorney's fees, or any specific number of\n\nattorney hours, which should have been segregated from the fees requested by Plaintiffs, and (v)\n\nevidence concerning any percentage to apply to Plaintiffs' attorney fee evidence in order to\n\narrive at a reasonable attorney's fee in the case.\n\n        2.     Despite and in contravention of the Court's rulings, Defendant attempted to place\n\nsuch excluded matters before the jury both through the testimony o f Defendant's expert witness\n\nand through argument to the jury, including (i) testimony concerning the number of hours\n\nDefendant's expert believed would be reasonable for prosecution of a deed restriction case like\n\nthis one, and (ii) jury argument that $150,000 was a reasonable attorney's fee through trial and\n\ncould be calculated by subtracting a certain amount of fees from the $579,954.45 fees sought by\n\nPlaintiffs.\n\n\nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL\n                                                                                              Page 2\n\n\n\n\n                                                     TAB 1\n\n\n                                                     TAB 1\n\f       3.      Defendant made several attempts to present testimony and argument to the jury\n\nthat Plaintiffs' attorneys' use of \"block billing\" in their attorney fee statements was somehow\n\nimproper or impermissible under the law and that as a result Plaintiffs should not recover some\n\nportion of their attorney's fees.    Despite the Court having granted Plaintiffs' request for a\n\nsupplemental limine order excluding any testimony, evidence or argument that any law requires\n\na party seeking to recover attorney's fees to prepare attorney fee statements which utilize \"task\n\nbilling,\" or that any law prohibits \"block billing\" (and the Court granting Plaintiffs' request for a\n\ncurative instruction to the jury,) Defendant proceeded to ignore the supplemental limine order by\n\n(i) posing questions to its expert witness which improperly touched upon the block billing issue,\n\nand (ii) arguing to the jury that Plaintiffs' attorney's fees should be reduced due to the fact that\n\ntheir attorneys' fee statements did not include itemizations of the time spent on each task.\n\n       4.      Defendant engaged         in improper jury argument which was inflammatory,\n\ncontained unsupported, extreme and personal attacks on the Plaintiffs and their attorneys, was\n\nunsupported by the evidence, was unsupported by the law or was contrary to the law, and which\n\nwas calculated to cause prejudice to the Plaintiffs and had the effect of striking at and harming\n\nthe judicial system itself, including:\n\n        (i)    argument to the jury that \"this case was about a lawyer money grab from day\n\n               one\";\n\n        (ii)    argument to the jury attacking the creation o f an association by certain property\n\n                owners in the Lakeview Heights Addition and the filing of this suit by the\n\n                association on their behalf, even though Texas law expressly permits the creation\n\n                of such an association and permits the filing of suit by a property owner's\n\n                designated representative, and Defendant introduced no evidence that the filing of\n\n\nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL\n                                                                                               Page 3\n\n\n\n\n                                                 TAB 1\n\n\n                                                 TAB 1\n\f                                                       I\n\n\n\n\n             suit by the Association rather than by each o f its individual members\n\n             unreasonably or unnecessarily increased the Plaintiffs' legal fees;\n\n     (iii)   argument to the jury attacking the Plaintiffs' use of a contingency fee arrangement\n\n             with their counsel by making the legally unsupported assertion that contingency\n\n             fee arrangements are only to be used by people who can't afford to pay an\n\n             attorney, as well as the factually unsupported argument that Plaintiff Wohlrabe\n\n             could pay for legal services i f she wanted to;\n\n     (iv)    argument to the jury attacking the propriety of Plaintiffs' contingency fee\n\n             arrangement by making the assertions that under the agreement the Plaintiffs are\n\n             never going to have to pay any fees and that the only way for them to obtain a\n\n             recovery is to create fees;\n\n     (v)     factually unsupported argument to the jury that under the Plaintiffs' contingency\n\n             fee arrangement the only thing Plaintiffs could collect would be their attorney's\n\n             fees, that the contingency fee agreements incentivized the attorneys to keep the\n\n             law suit going as long as possible so they could \"jet up\" or \"gin up\" the attorney's\n\n             fees and obtain a bigger attorney fee award, and that the attorney's fees were all\n\n             that the Plaintiffs were fighting about, even though the gravamen of Plaintiffs'\n\n             petition was their request for temporary and permanent injunctive relief;\n\n     (vi)    factually and legally unsupported argument to the jury that under the Plaintiffs'\n\n             contingency fee arrangement the more time Plaintiffs' counsel puts in the case the\n\n             more he recovers, and that this is the opposite of a typical contingency agreement;\n\n     (vii)   factually unsupported argument to the jury that Plaintiffs should have segregated\n\n             hundreds of thousands of dollars related to a cause of action which was dropped\n\n\nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL\n                                                                                           Page 4\n\n\n\n\n                                               TAB 1\n\n\n                                               TAB 1\n\f              by Plaintiffs after it had been pending for years;\n\n       5.     The afore-listed jury argument was designed to cause prejudice and harm to\n\nPlaintiffs, struck at and damaged the integrity of the judicial system itself, and was incurable.\n\nDefendant's repeated attacks on Plaintiffs and their counsel as having filed this suit simply as a\n\n\"money grab\" or an attempt to create attorney's fees or \"jet up\" or \"gin up\" attorney's fees,\n\nrather than for the legal and legitimate purpose of enforcing a neighborhood's deed restrictions,\n\nwas not based on any evidence and was extreme, unsupported, and designed to turn the jury\n\nagainst Plaintiffs and their counsel.     Defendant's repeated attacks on Plaintiffs' use of a\n\ncontingency fee arrangement with their counsel were unsupported by the law and were advanced\n\nfor the purpose of attempting to characterize Plaintiffs and their counsel as greedy and as having\n\npursued this legal action solely in order to extract money from Defendant.\n\n       6.      The cumulative effect of Defendant's violations of the Court's rulings, as outlined\n\nabove, and o f Defendant's extreme, unsupported, and improper jury argument, as outlined above,\n\nmight reasonably have resulted in, and probably did result in, an improper verdict and harm to\n\nthe Plaintiffs which was incurable.\n\n       7.      In addition, there was insufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that\n\n$290,000 is a reasonable attorney's fee for Plaintiffs through trial of the case and the finding is\n\nagainst the overwhelming weight o f the evidence.        There was no expert testimony or other\n\nevidence that $290,000 was a reasonable attorney's fee through trial in this case and there was\n\ninsufficient evidence to support any figure or range of figures that the jury might have used to\n\ndetermine that a reasonable attorney's fee through trial in this case was $290,000. The only\n\ndollar figure presented to the jury as to Plaintiffs' reasonable attorney's fees through trial was the\n\n$579,954.45 figure presented by Plaintiffs. There was insufficient evidence to support the\n\n\nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL\n                                                                                                Page 5\n\n\n\n\n                                                 TAB 1\n\n\n                                                 TAB 1\n\f$150,000 figure that Defendant sought to present to the jury because (i) there was no testimony\n\nor other evidence to support the $150,000 figure, and (ii) Defendant's expert's testimony\n\nconcerning legal fees which might not have been incurred had Plaintiffs filed their summary\n\njudgment motion four months earlier was incomplete and insufficient to support Defendant's\n\n$150,000 figure.\n\n        8.      For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that good cause exists for a new\n\ntrial of Plaintiffs' claim for attorney's fees through the trial of the case.\n\n        THEREFORE, it is ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that Plaintiffs' Motion\n\nfor New Trial is GRANTED.\n\n\n\n\n                                                Judge Presiding\n\n\n\n\n ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL\n                                                                                          Page 6\n\n\n\n\n                                                    TAB 1\n\n\n                                                    TAB 1\n\fCONDITIONALLY GRANT; and Opinion Filed August 15, 2017.\n\n\n\n\n                                          S    In The\n                                Court of Appeals\n                         Fifth District of Texas at Dallas\n                                       No. 05-16-01481-CV\n\n                         IN RE BCH DEVELOPMENT, LLC, Relator\n\n                        On Appeal from the County Court at Law No. 1\n                                    Dallas County, Texas\n                            Trial Court Cause No. CC-13-05900-A\n\n                                           OPINION\n                            Before Justices Evans, Brown, and Schenck\n                                    Opinion by Justice Schenck\n       After the trial court granted real parties in interest’s motion for summary judgment in this\n\ndeed restriction case, the matter proceeded to a jury trial on attorney’s fees pursuant to section\n\n5.006 of the property code. TEX. PROP. CODE ANN. § 5.006 (West 2014). The jury returned a\n\nverdict awarding real parties in interest $290,000 in attorney’s fees, rather than the full\n\n$579,954.45 they sought to recover. The trial court granted real parties in interest’s request for a\n\nnew trial.\n\n       Relator, BCH Development, LLC (“BCH”), filed a petition for writ of mandamus urging\n\nthat we direct the trial court to vacate its new trial order because none of the specified reasons for\n\nordering a new trial legally support relief in the form of a new trial. We agree and therefore\n\nconditionally grant mandamus relief and direct the trial court to vacate the September 21, 2016\n\nOrder Granting New Trial and enter a judgment on the jury verdict.\n\n\n\n                                               TAB 2\n\f                                                             BACKGROUND\n\n           This case arises from BCH’s attempt to construct a home with a habitable attic in the\n\nLakeview Heights Addition.                      Barbara Wohlrabe and Lakeview Heights Addition Property\n\nOwners’ Association (collectively, the “Association”) brought suit against BCH and Blanchard\n\nHomes, LLC asserting they were breaching and violating deed restrictions and seeking to enjoin\n\nthem from constructing a dwelling that has more than one above-ground level or floor of living\n\nspace, and from constructing a dwelling that has a habitable attic. The Association also asserted\n\na claim for tortious interference, which it later abandoned. After the trial court granted the\n\nAssociation’s motion for summary judgment and permanently enjoined BCH from building a\n\ndwelling in the neighborhood in excess of one story and with a habitable attic, the Association\n\nnonsuited its claims against Blanchard Homes, LLC.\n\n           At trial, the only remaining issue was an award of attorney’s fees under the property\n\ncode. One of the Association’s attorneys testified as the expert for the Association. He opined\n\nthat fees in the amount of $579,954.45 were reasonable in pursuing the breach and violation of\n\nthe deed restrictions claims in light of the extensive work that had been put into the case. On\n\ncross examination, he testified that the jury in a different, less complicated deed restriction case\n\nawarded $250,000 based on his testimony in that case.                                       BCH’s expert countered that the\n\nAssociation unnecessarily delayed seeking a summary judgment for a period of a year. The\n\nrecord—the Association’s exhibit of its attorney’s fees—shows that fees of approximately\n\n$361,000 accrued during the delay. 1 BCH’s expert, who has handled hundreds of property\n\nowners’ association cases, also testified as to what would be the reasonable hours expended\n\nduring various phases of a deed restriction case. They totaled 500 to 600 hours. The jury\n\n     1\n        BCH points out that the attorney’s fees sought by the Association, in the amount of $579,954, less the fees incurred during this delay in\nmoving for summary judgment, in the amount of $361,000, equals approximately $218,000. The Association responds that these amounts and\nthis calculation were never mentioned to the jury.\n\n\n\n                                                                     –2–\n                                                                    TAB 2\n\freturned a verdict awarding the Association $290,000. The Association moved for judgment\n\nnotwithstanding the verdict or for a new trial. The trial court granted the Association’s motion\n\nfor new trial. This original proceeding followed.\n\n                STANDARD FOR GRANTING MANDAMUS—ORDER GRANTING NEW TRIAL\n\n           A trial court’s order granting a new trial after a jury trial is subject to mandamus review.\n\nIn re Zimmer, Inc., 451 S.W.3d 893, 898 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2014, orig. proceeding) (citing In\n\nre United Scaffolding, Inc., 377 S.W.3d 685, 688–89 (Tex. 2012) (orig. proceeding)). A new\n\ntrial order must initially satisfy two “facial requirements.” In re Bent, 487 S.W.3d 170, 173\n\n(Tex. 2016) (orig. proceeding). One, the order must state a legally appropriate reason for the\n\nnew trial. Id. Two, the stated reason must be specific enough to indicate that the trial court did\n\nnot simply parrot a pro forma template but rather derived the articulated reason from the case’s\n\nparticular facts and circumstances. Id. The order must satisfy both requirements, or it reflects an\n\nabuse of discretion correctable by mandamus. See United Scaffolding, 377 S.W.3d at 688–89.\n\n           Further, even if a new trial order meets the facial requirements, a relator can show an\n\nabuse of discretion and an entitlement to mandamus relief if, after a merits review, the record\n\ndoes not support the trial court’s rationale for ordering a new trial. Bent, 487 S.W.3d at 173; In\n\nre Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc., 407 S.W.3d 746, 749 (Tex. 2013) (orig. proceeding).\n\n                                                               DISCUSSION\n\n     A. Were the trial court’s reasons for ordering a new trial both sufficiently specific and\n        legally appropriate?\n\n           The order in this case cites (1) BCH’s violation of limine orders limiting the scope of\n\nBCH’s attorney fee expert’s testimony, 2 (2) BCH’s improper jury argument attacking the\n\n\n\n     2\n       The Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for New Trial identifies BCH’s expert’s testimony concerning the number of hours he believed\nwould be reasonable for prosecution of a deed restriction case like this one, and BCH’s attempts to present testimony that plaintiffs’ attorneys’\n“block billing” statements were somehow improper or impermissible, as violations of limine orders.\n\n\n\n                                                                     –3–\n                                                                    TAB 2\n\fAssociation and its attorneys, criticizing the use of a contingency fee agreement and lack of\n\nsegregation of fees, and stating that $150,000 was a reasonable fee through trial, and (3) factual\n\nand legal insufficiency of the evidence to support the jury’s award of $290,000 in attorney’s fees,\n\nas its bases for granting a new trial. Violation of limine orders, improper jury argument, and\n\ninsufficiency of the evidence, if established, can serve as legally proper reasons for granting a\n\nnew trial. See In re United Servs. Auto. Ass’n¸ 446 S.W.3d 162, 174 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st\n\nDist.] 2014, orig. proceeding) (the violation of a limine order can serve as a basis for a new trial\n\norder), mand. denied, 487 S.W.3d 170 (Tex. 2016); Living Ctrs. of Tex., Inc. v. Penalver, 256\n\nS.W.3d 678, 681–82 (Tex. 2008) (holding that improper incurable jury argument is a legally\n\nappropriate ground for a new trial); Zimmer, 451 S.W.3d at 898 (noting that factual insufficiency\n\nof the evidence to support the jury’s verdict, if established, is a legally proper reason for granting\n\na new trial). Thus, the order complies with the first facial requirement. Toyota, 407 S.W.3d at\n\n756–57.\n\n       The trial court’s order also satisfies the second requirement of specificity. It recites the\n\nspecific facts and circumstances of the case that led the trial judge to reach her conclusions. The\n\norder is specific enough both to permit BCH to attack it and to enable our review. See Zimmer,\n\n451 S.W.3d at 898.\n\n   B. Were the trial court’s reasons for granting a new trial valid and correct?\n\n       Simply articulating understandable, reasonably specific, and legally appropriate reasons\n\nis not enough to sustain a new trial order; the reasons must be valid and correct. Id. (citing\n\nToyota, 407 S.W.3d at 759). We must conduct a careful “merits review” of the record. See\n\nToyota, 407 S.W.3d at 759. In a mandamus proceeding, we may not substitute our judgment for\n\nthat of the trial court. In re Sanders, 153 S.W.3d 54, 56 (Tex. 2004) (orig. proceeding). But\n\nneither may the trial court substitute its judgment for that of the jury in granting a new trial.\n\n                                                 –4–\n                                               TAB 2\n\fre Columbia Med. Ctr. of Las Colinas, 290 S.W.3d 204, 212 (Tex. 2009) (orig. proceeding);\n\nToyota, 407 S.W.3d at 758 (“If . . . a trial court’s articulated reasons are not supported by the\n\nunderlying record, the new trial order cannot stand.”). Thus, using a factual sufficiency standard,\n\nwe will engage in a review of the entire trial record to determine whether it supports the trial\n\ncourt’s reasons for granting a new trial. See Bent, 487 S.W.3d at 180. If the record does not\n\nsupport the trial court’s stated reasons, then the trial court will have abused its discretion in\n\ngranting a new trial. See Toyota, 407 S.W.3d at 761 (holding the trial court abused its discretion\n\nby granting a new trial because the record did not support the articulated reason).\n\n       1. Limine Orders and Jury Arguments\n\n       As to the trial court’s assertion that BCH’s alleged violations of motion-in-limine orders\n\nare bases for granting a new trial, we note that the purpose of a motion in limine is to prevent a\n\nparty from asking prejudicial questions and introducing evidence in front of the jury without first\n\nasking the court’s permission. See Weidner v. Sanchez, 14 S.W.3d 353, 363 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2000, no pet.). A motion in limine itself preserves nothing for review. In\n\nre R.V. Jr., 977 S.W.2d 777, 780 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1998, no pet.). The complaining party\n\nmust immediately object and also request the trial court to instruct the jury to disregard the\n\nevidence introduced in violation of a limine order. State Bar of Tex. v. Evans, 774 S.W.2d 656,\n\n658 n.6 (Tex. 1989) (per curiam); Weidner, 14 S.W.3d at 363.\n\n       Before BCH called its expert witness to testify, the Association moved to exclude certain\n\ntestimony of this witness, arguing BCH failed to disclose certain expert opinions the Association\n\nbelieved BCH would attempt to elicit based on BCH’s opening statement. In response, the trial\n\ncourt ruled that BCH’s expert would not be allowed to opine as to (1) the appropriate amount of\n\nfees that should be segregated, (2) the reasonable hourly rates in Dallas County (BCH conceded\n\nits expert would not be challenging the Association’s expert’s opinion on reasonable rates), and\n\n                                               –5–\n                                              TAB 2\n\f(3) the specific amount that should have been charged.\n\n            The trial court considered BCH’s attempt to present testimony concerning the number of\n\nhours that would be reasonable for prosecution of a deed restriction case like this one, and\n\nattempt to present testimony that the Association’s attorneys’ “block billing” statements were\n\nsomehow improper, to violate its limine orders. A review of the challenged comments reveals,\n\nhowever, that they did not reach into any of the topics precluded by the motion and the resulting\n\norder.\n\n            As for BCH’s expert’s testimony concerning a reasonable number of hours for\n\nprosecution of a case like this, in connection with the Association’s request that BCH’s expert be\n\nprecluded from testifying on certain matters, the trial court affirmatively permitted that\n\ntestimony, indicating that he could “say that, in his experience, someone working on a summary\n\njudgment of the type that was permitted or presented in this case would have been 20 hours not\n\n60 hours.” The court went on to clarify, after BCH’s attorney asked whether he could ask the\n\nexpert how many billable hours it should take to drive this type of case to resolution based upon\n\nhis experience, that “he can testify as to the hours, but not to the amounts.” Thus, BCH’s\n\nexpert’s testimony concerning billable hours did not violate a limine order and cannot serve as a\n\nlegally proper reason for granting a new trial.\n\n            As to testimony concerning “block billing,” it also was not subject to a limine order. In\n\nfact, BCH’s attorney elicited testimony concerning block billing from the Association’s expert\n\nwitness on cross examination without objection.3 In addition, the Association’s own attorney\n\n\n3\n    The following exchange occurred between BCH’s counsel and the Association’s expert witness:\n\n            Q.    And when you bill in this manner, sir, is that commonly required [sic] to as block billing?\n            A.    It’s called block billing.\n            Q.    And is it your understanding that Courts disfavor block billing?\n            A.    Absolutely not. In fact, I’ve testified in attorneys’ fees cases where we don't even introduce the fee statements. It’s\n                  not required.\n            Q.    And so is it your testimony that Courts do not -- or do you have an opinion -- let me strike that. Have you read any\n                  cases about block billing and whether the Court -- whether Courts favor block billing?\n\n\n                                                                       –6–\n                                                                      TAB 2\n\fquestioned its expert on block billing. 4 The trial court did not enter a limine order concerning\n\ntestimony, evidence, or argument as to whether task billing was necessary until after the\n\nAssociation’s expert had already testified.                               Thus, testimony elicited from the Association’s\n\nexpert concerning “block billing” did not violate a limine order and cannot serve as a legally\n\nproper reason for granting a new trial.\n\n             When BCH’s counsel attempted to question BCH’s expert as to what block billing does\n\nto the bill, the Association objected and the court sustained the objection before the basis for the\n\nobjection could be stated. BCH’s expert did not answer the question. Thereafter, the trial court\n\ninstructed the jury as follows:\n\n             Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I just want to give you an instruction that – or\n             an admonition to follow. You have previously heard examination questions,\n             arguments, or testimony which may have caused you to believe that Texas law\n             prohibits block billing in an attorneys’ fee statement. That is an incorrect\n             statement of Texas law. You are to disregard questions, arguments, or testimony\n             with regard to the issue of block billing.\n\n             A.     It depends on what Court you’re in. If you’re in a bankruptcy court, you cannot block bill.\n             Q.     Okay. Have you read any cases from the Fifth Circuit about what they think about block billing?\n             A.     It depends if you’re talking about a bankruptcy case. If you’re talking about a bankruptcy case, the Fifth Circuit says\n                    you can’t block bill in bankruptcy cases because that’s a debtor, and the bankruptcy courts won’t let you block bill.\n             Q.     What about non-bankruptcy cases, sir?\n             A.     In non-bankruptcy cases, no, I’m not familiar with any prohibition by the Fifth Circuit in block billing to get\n                    attorneys’ fees. If you have the case, let me see it please.\n             ....\n             Q.     So, at least as far as you’re concerned, there is -- block billing is fine, true?\n             A.     In getting recovery of attorneys’ fees in Texas under 5.006, block billing is fine because you don’t even have to\n                    introduce your fee statements.\n             Q.     Have you ever done any research about block billing yourself? Have you done any?\n             A.     Yes.\n             Q.     Okay. You have done research on block billing?\n             A.     In bankruptcy cases, yes.\n             Q.     In non-bankruptcy cases, sir. I’m talking about civil cases that aren’t bankruptcy cases.\n             A.     Mr. Culpepper, I’m pretty much aware of the cases that have to deal with proving up attorneys’ fees in state court in Texas, and\n                    I’m not familiar with a case that says you cannot block bill and recover attorneys’ fees. If you have one, I’d be happy to read it.\n                    I’m not familiar with a case that prohibits block billing.\n4\n    The following exchange took place between the Association’s counsel and the Association’s expert:\n\n             Q.     Now there was a great deal of talk about-- he mentioned block billing. And would the other type of billing where you\n                    put the amount down for each individual task be called task billing?\n             A.     It’s task billing.\n             Q.     And, [Association’s expert], is it your opinion -- are you aware of any opinion which prohibits the recovery of\n                    attorneys’ fees based on block billing?\n             A.     Absolutely not. That [sic] why he -- if he’s got one, I wanted Mr. Culpepper to show me because I’m not aware of\n                    one.\n             Q.     Have -- now while you might be able to task bill in a case, is there anything wrong with block billing?\n             A.     Absolutely not. That’s why I said for 12 percent of our clients, we bill block bill. For 10 percent, we task bill. It’s a\n                    specific request by client. If you’re doing bankruptcy work, the bankruptcy -- if you’re doing litigation for a debtor in\n                    a bankruptcy case, then the bankruptcy court requires you to do task billing, not block billing.\n\n\n                                                                          –7–\n                                                                        TAB 2\n\f       When a trial court instructs the jury to disregard evidence offered in violation of a motion\n\nin limine, we may review that evidence to determine whether an instruction to disregard was\n\nadequate to cure its admission. In re City of Houston, 418 S.W.3d 388, 397 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2013, orig. proceeding). “Violations of an order on a motion in limine are\n\nincurable if instructions to the jury would not eliminate the danger of prejudice.” Dove v. Dir.,\n\nState Emps. Workers’ Comp. Div., 857 S.W.2d 577, 580 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1993,\n\nwrit denied) (citing Dennis v. Hulse, 362 S.W.2d 308, 309 (Tex. 1962)). We presume that jurors\n\nfollow the instructions they are given. Taylor v. Fabritech, Inc., 132 S.W.3d 613, 626 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2004, pet. denied). In this case, there is no reason to conclude that\n\nthe instruction actually failed to cure the effect of an unanswered question concerning block\n\nbilling. Thus, to the extent the trial court granted a new trial on that basis, it cannot serve as a\n\nlegally proper reason for granting a new trial.\n\n       As to the trial court’s assertion that BCH engaged in improper jury argument during\n\nclosing argument, we note that a litigant is entitled to have his counsel argue the facts of the case\n\nto the jury. Clark v. Bres, 217 S.W.3d 501, 510 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, pet.\n\ndenied) (citing Texas Sand Co. v. Shield, 381 S.W.2d 48, 57–58 (Tex. 1964)). Reasonable\n\ninferences and deductions from the evidence are permissible as well during closing argument.\n\nPopCap Games, Inc. v. MumboJumbo, L.L.C., 350 S.W.3d 699, 721 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2011,\n\npet. denied). Hyperbole is also generally a permissible rhetorical technique in closing argument.\n\nId. Counsel may comment on the credibility of witnesses. See id. at 722 (arguing that jury\n\nshould accept one witness’s opinion instead of another’s was not improper). Trial counsel\n\nshould be given wide latitude in arguing the evidence and the reasonable inferences from the\n\nevidence to the jury. Clark, 217 S.W.3d at 510.\n\n\n\n                                                  –8–\n                                                  TAB 2\n\f       A complaint about improper, but curable, jury argument is waived by the failure to object\n\nat trial. Standard Fire Ins. v. Reese, 584 S.W.2d 835, 841 (Tex. 1979). A complaint of incurable\n\njury argument, however, may be asserted and preserved in a motion for new trial, even in the\n\nabsence of a timely objection during trial. TEX. R. CIV. P. 324(b)(5); Phillips v. Bramlett, 288\n\nS.W.3d 876, 883 (Tex. 2009). Instances of incurable improper jury arguments are rare. See\n\nPenalver, 256 S.W.3d at 680. Examples of incurable improper jury arguments can include\n\nappeals to racial prejudice, unsupported accusations of witness tampering by the opposing party,\n\nand unsupported, extreme, and personal attacks on opposing parties and witnesses. Id. at\n\n681; see also Cottman Transmission Sys., L.L.C. v. FVLR Enters., L.L.C., 295 S.W.3d 372, 380\n\n(Tex. App.—Dallas 2009, pet. denied) (recognizing that incurable argument can include\n\nunsupported charges of perjury and the use of inflammatory epithets such as “liar” and “cheat”).\n\n       Of the closing argument statements the trial court considered to be improper, the\n\nAssociation objected to only BCH’s attorney’s statements that $150,000 was a reasonable fee in\n\nthis case and “You can’t – the other expert can’t segregate.” The Fourteenth Court of Appeals\n\ndecided that trial error that is not preserved for appellate review is not available as proper\n\ngrounds for a new trial. In re Athans, 478 S.W.3d 128, 139 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n2015) (orig. proceeding). We agree. We conclude the unobjected to arguments the trial court\n\nconsidered to be attacks against the Association and its attorneys and critical of the use of a\n\ncontingency fee agreement were not preserved and did not amount to fundamental error. Thus,\n\nthey cannot serve as legally proper reasons for granting a new trial.\n\n       As to the jury argument that $150,000 was a reasonable attorney’s fee through trial, in\n\naccordance with the trial court’s directive, BCH’s expert testified concerning reasonable billable\n\nhours in a case like this. They totaled 500 to 600 hours. The evidence established Wohlrabe,\n\nwho is an attorney with the firm representing the Association, charges $300 per hour for her\n\n                                                –9–\n                                              TAB 2\n\fprofessional services.   Thus, BCH’s comment that a reasonable fee was $150,000 was a\n\nreasonable inference or deduction from the evidence, and did not violate the trial court’s limine\n\norder concerning a specific amount of fees, because the order was directed to BCH’s expert’s\n\ntestimony, not to BCH’s attorney and argument. Thus, the argument was not improper.\n\n       As to argument concerning segregation of fees, BCH’s counsel stated:\n\n       And [the Association’s expert] told you, well, I took out $25,000. If you look at\n       the fee statements, remember he had a cause of action for years, one whole cause\n       of action that he dropped, he couldn’t recover attorney’s fees on. And he’s saying,\n       but that was only $25,000. If you look at the fee statements, you will see that they\n       should have segregated hundreds of thousands of dollars related to that claim.\n\nCounsel for the Association objected to this statement without stating the grounds, and the trial\n\ncourt sustained the objection. The evidence established that segregation of recoverable fees from\n\nnon-recoverable fees was required in this case. The jury heard evidence that the fees were not\n\nsufficiently segregated, that the fees related to the tortious interference with contract claim were\n\nnot recoverable, and that the tortious interference with contract claim was dismissed after it had\n\nbeen pending for years. Thus, BCH’s counsel’s comments about the $25,000 segregation and\n\nthe claim upon which the Association could not recover were comments on the facts and\n\nreasonable inferences therefrom. BCH’s counsel referred the jury to the fee statements, which\n\nwere in evidence, to decide the issue of segregation itself and the comment about hundreds of\n\nthousands of dollars was hyperbole. The arguments were, thus, not improper.\n\n       Accordingly, the arguments cited as reasons for granting a new trial are not correct or\n\nlegally appropriate bases upon which to order a new trial.\n\n       2. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n       As to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury’s verdict, the trial court stated\n\nthere was no expert testimony or other evidence that $290,000 was a reasonable attorney’s fee in\n\nthis case and there was insufficient evidence to support any figure or range of figures that the\n\n                                               –10–\n                                              TAB 2\n\fjury might have used to determine that a reasonable attorney’s fee in this case was $290,000.\n\nThe court continued by stating the only dollar figure presented to the jury as to the Association’s\n\nreasonable attorney’s fees was the $579,954.45 figure presented by the Association.            We\n\ndisagree.\n\n       When a party puts on evidence that contradicts the fees sought by the plaintiff—whether\n\nby cross examination of the plaintiff’s expert or by presenting its own expert—the trier of fact is\n\nnot bound to the number provided by the plaintiff’s expert. Powell Elec. Sys., Inc. v. Hewlett\n\nPackard Co., 356 S.W.3d 113, 128 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2011, no pet.). While the\n\nAssociation’s expert opined fees in the amount of $579,954.24 were reasonable and necessary,\n\nBCH’s expert testified as to fees that could have been avoided by seeking summary judgment\n\nearlier in the case, and opined that a case like this one should have required 500 to 600 hours of\n\nattorney time. The evidence also established Wohlrabe’s billable rate is $300 per hour. And 500\n\nhours at $300 per hour equates to a minimum of $150,000, as noted previously. During closing\n\nargument, the trial court permitted, over objection, argument that “had [the Association] chosen\n\nto file [their motions for summary judgment] early on . . . they could have cut out a tremendous\n\namount of fees they incurred after March of 2014 . . . . They said they incurred $429,381, if you\n\nadd it up.” Subtracting this sum from the claimed fees of approximately $579,000, leaves\n\napproximately $150,000.\n\n       Thus, the evidence showed a range of fees from $150,000 to slightly over $579,000. The\n\njury awarded the Association $290,000, well within the range supported by the evidence. Under\n\nthese circumstances, the evidence was sufficient to support the jury’s award of $290,000.

Barash Energy, Ltd., No. 02–11–00258–CV, 2013 WL\n\n2631164, at *12 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth June 13, 2013, pet. denied) (mem. op.)

Dallas Cty. Bail\n\nBond Bd., 23 S.W.3d 407, 415 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2000, pet. denied) (affirming trial court’s\n\naward of attorney’s fees because the amount was within the range supported by the evidence);\n\nsee also, e.g., Sw. Energy Prod. Co. v. Berry–Helfand, 491 S.W.3d 699, 713 (Tex. 2016) (“The\n\njury generally has discretion to award damages within the range of evidence presented at trial.”).\n\n       Thus, to the extent the trial court granted a new trial based on factual insufficiency of the\n\nevidence to support the jury’s award of $290,000 in attorney’s fees, that reason is not correct or\n\nlegally appropriate, and the trial court abused its discretion in granting a new trial for that reason.\n\n       To the extent the trial court granted a new trial on the basis of cumulative error, that basis\n\nis not a reason that is legally appropriate. When there are no errors, we reject cumulative error\n\narguments. Caro v. Sharp, No. 03-02-00108-CV, 2003 WL 21354602, at *8 (Tex. App.—Austin\n\nJune 12, 2003, pet. denied) (mem. op.).\n\n                                            CONCLUSION\n\n       The trial court abused its discretion by granting a new trial based on grounds that were\n\nnot legally appropriate. Therefore, we conditionally grant BCH’s petition for writ of mandamus.\n\nA writ will issue only if the trial court fails to vacate its September 21, 2016 Order Granting New\n\nTrial and fails to enter a judgment on the jury’s verdict.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      /David J.

When the language of a restrictive covenant is\n\nunambiguous, it is liberally construed to give effect to its purpose and\n\nintent. Id. at 195; Tex. Prop. Code § 202.003(a).\n\n          However, if the language is found to be ambiguous, the restrictive\n\ncovenant is construed strictly against the party seeking to enforce the\n\nrestriction, and all doubts must be resolved in favor of the free and\n\nunrestricted use of the property. Wilmoth, 734 S.W.2d at 657.\n\n          Wohlrabe’s attempt to distinguish the Texas Supreme Court’s holding\n\nin Wilmoth falls flat. Wohlrabe argues Wilmoth is inapplicable because it\n\nwas decided before § 202.003(a) was enacted. 1 This in incorrect—it was\n\ndecided after §202.003(a) was enacted. More importantly, the Texas\n\nSupreme Court more recently refused to find that § 202.003(a) supplanted\n\nWilmoth and its analysis. See Pilarcik v. Emmons, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2378132\"><a href=\"/opinion/2378132/pilarcik-v-emmons/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 478–\n\n1   See Appellees’ Br. at 22, fn 5.\n                                         10\n\f80 (Tex.1998). This is precisely why a majority of the Texas courts of\n\nappeals have adopted the Wilmoth holding that when a deed restriction is\n\nambiguous, it must be “strictly construed against the party seeking to\n\nenforce the restriction, and all doubts must be resolved in favor of the free\n\nand unrestricted use of the property.” Jennings, 258 S.W.3d at 195.2\n\nWohlrabe’s suggestion that there is no authority to support BCH’s\n\ncontention that ambiguous covenants must be strictly construed against the\n\nparty seeking to enforce them is therefore a blatant misrepresentation.\n\n      Whether a restrictive covenant is ambiguous is a question of law that\n\nmust be decided by examining the covenant as a whole in light of the\n\ncircumstances     present when it was            drafted.

Importantly, the\n\nwords and phrases in the restrictive covenant must not be enlarged,\n\nextended, changed, or stretched by construction. Wilmoth, 734 S.W.2d at\n\n657–58.\n\n      The language used in Restrictive Covenant 1—“one story in height”—\n\nis ambiguous on its face. The covenants do not prohibit attics and there is\n\nno definition regarding what constitutes a “story” and, more specifically,\n\nwhat kind of attic is not permitted. Moreover, while Restrictive Covenant 1\n\nis a restriction based on “height,” the covenants fail entirely to provide what\n\nconstitutes excessive “height” in violation of the covenant. This not only\n\ncreates ambiguity, but by Wohlrabe’s expert’s own testimony, makes\n\nRestrictive Covenant 1 arbitrary, as a home could be 40 feet tall (tall enough\n\nto be a three-story home), so long as there is no usable space over the\n\nground floor. BCH’s contention is supported by (1) pertinent definitions of\n\nthe 1951 Dallas Building Code, (2) all relevant case law, and (3) the\n\nevidence in the summary judgment record.\n\n\n\n\n                                      12\n\f     A.       Wohlrabe’s argument ignores the more pertinent\n              definitions contain in the 1951 and current building\n              codes\n\n     In the summary judgment record and in Appellees’ Brief, Wohlrabe\n\ncites the 1940, 1952, and 1956 dictionary definitions of “story” and “height”\n\nto show their “generally accepted meaning” at the time the restrictive\n\ncovenants were created—which, generally, stated that a “story” was a set of\n\nrooms on the same floor of a building and “height” meant a distance\n\nupward from the ground. (4 CR 4161–66.) But contrary to Wohlrabe’s\n\nassertion that these dictionary definitions in and of themselves give the\n\nrestrictive covenant at issue a definite and certain meaning, there were\n\nother applicable and relevant definitions that existed at the time the\n\ncovenants were written within the 1951 Dallas Building Code.\n\n              1.   BCH properly preserved its argument regarding\n                   the 1951 Dallas Building Code\n\n     Wohlrabe asserts that BCH waived its ambiguity arguments arising\n\nfrom the 1951 Dallas Building Code’s definition of “attic story.” This is\n\ninaccurate.\n\n     The 1951 Dallas Building Code was expressly addressed in Wohlrabe’s\n\nMotion for Summary Judgment. (4 CR 4163.) Moreover, the 1951 Dallas\n\nBuilding Code Provisions—including the term “attic story”—were discussed\n\nat length in the summary judgment evidence submitted by BCH, including:\n\n                                     13\n\fthe affidavit of Frank Blanchard, the testimony of Wohlrabe, and the\n\nAmended Affidavit of Mark Shekter. (3 SCR 72–102, 177–78; 6 CR 5512–\n\n29.) All of these exhibits were cited in BCH’s summary judgment response\n\nand amended response in support of BCH’s argument that the language in\n\nthe restrictive covenant is ambiguous. (5 CR 4637–4688; 6 CR 5371–5425.)\n\nAccordingly, Wohlrabe’s claim that BCH’s argument that the 1951 Building\n\nCode provisions support BCH’s assertion of ambiguity is meritless.\n\n            2.     The 1951 Dallas Building Code definitions\n                   demonstrate that the restrictive covenant is\n                   susceptible to more than one reasonable\n                   interpretation\n\n      The 1951 Dallas Building Code, which was in force at the time the\n\nrestrictions were written, contained a separate definition for “story,” attic”\n\nand “attic story.” Specifically, “story” is defined as:\n\n      That portion of a building included between the upper surface\n      of any floor and the upper surface of the floor next above,\n      except that the topmost story shall be that portion of a building\n      included between the upper surface of the topmost floor and the\n      ceiling above.\n\nThe 1951 Code defines “attic” as:\n\n      Any space situated between a roof and ceiling immediately\n      below and not used for business, storage, or habitation.\n\n“Attic story” is defined as:\n\n\n\n\n                                        14\n\f      Any story situated whole or partly in the roof, so designated,\n      arranged or built as to be used for business, storage, or\n      habitation.\n\n(Appellant’s Br. at Apx. Tab L.) Whether or not an “attic story” was\n\nconsidered a “story” is not mentioned or defined in the 1951 Code, but the\n\nspecific inclusion of “attic story” in the Code indicates that an “attic story” is\n\nnot the same as a “story” in the general sense. Moreover, most houses in the\n\naddition do have an “attic story” under the 1951 definitions.\n\n      Most importantly, the 1951 Dallas Building Code states an “attic\n\nstory”—a finished-out attic for habitation—is not the same as “story.” The\n\nrestrictive covenants at issue do not prohibit attics from being used for\n\nstorage or habitation, nor are the terms “attic” or “attic story” mentioned in\n\nthe deed restrictions. Thus, the 1951 Code alone creates an ambiguity as to\n\nwhether habitable attics are prohibited under the restrictive covenants at\n\nissue and whether an “attic story,” which is separately defined under the\n\nCode, is considered a “story” within the meaning of the deed restrictions.\n\n      Wohlrabe argues that “simply because the Restrictive Covenants\n\ndon’t expressly prohibit ‘attic stories’ does not mean the creators did not\n\nintend to prohibit them. . .” Appellees’ Br. at 31–32. However, Wohlrabe\n\nhas presented no evidence that the creators of the covenants did intend to\n\nprohibit attic stories. And, despite the clear distinctions between “attic,”\n\n\n                                       15\n\f“attic story,” and “story” in the very regulations which governed building in\n\nDallas at the time the covenants were written, the creators chose to use the\n\nmore general phrase “one story in height.” Moreover, rather than\n\n“nullifying”   Restrictive    Covenant       1   as   Wohlrabe    claims,   BCH’s\n\ninterpretation   simply      provides    an      alternative   interpretation—that\n\nRestrictive Covenant 1 does not prohibit certain types of attics. This creates\n\nunmistakable ambiguity, which mandates that the restrictive covenant be\n\nstrictly construed toward the free and unrestricted use of the property.\n\n      Wohlrabe belabors the point that the only relevant sources for\n\ndetermining the deed restrictions are those that were in existence at the\n\ntime the covenants were drafted (such as the 1951 Dallas Building Code).\n\nYet it is still instructive to compare the 1951 provisions to the present day\n\nIRC provisions, for doing so highlights the trend of Dallas building codes to\n\ndraw a distinction between a traditional “story” and an “attic/habitable\n\nattic/attic story.” Notably, the 2012 and 2015 IRCs “habitable attic”\n\ndefinition is very similar to the definition of “attic story” contained in the\n\n1951 version of the Dallas Building Code, which governed residential\n\nconstruction in Dallas at the inception of the Addition’s deed restrictions.\n\nIn fact, the only difference between the IRC definition of “habitable attic”\n\nand the 1951 Dallas Building Code definition of “attic story” is that under\n\n\n                                        16\n\fthe modern day definition of “habitable attic,” the exact same attic space\n\nwould have been defined as an “attic story” in 1951 and must now comply\n\nwith certain safety requirements, whether the attic is finished or\n\nunfinished. Further, a “habitable attic” under the 2012 IRC definitions is,\n\nby the IRC’s exact words, “not considered a story.”\n\n     Wohlrabe’s argument that the Restrictive Covenant 1 has a “definite\n\nlegal meaning” rests on dictionary definitions, rather than the more\n\npertinent definitions set out in the 1951 Dallas Building Code and IRC,\n\nwhich reveal there is more than one reasonable interpretation of the phrase\n\n“one story in height.” This creates ambiguity which compels this Court to\n\nstrictly construe the restrictive covenants against Wohlrabe and resolve the\n\nambiguity favorably toward BCH’s free and unrestricted use of the\n\nproperty.\n\n     B.     Courts in Texas and elsewhere have held similar\n            covenants ambiguous\n\n            1.   The Dallas County District Court ruling in Dienes\n                 v. LTG Vegan Ltd. is not instructive in this case\n\n     Wohlrabe cites the 191st District Court’s Findings of Fact and\n\nConclusions of Law in the 2005 case Dienes v. LTG Vegan Ltd. (Cause No.\n\n04-10084-J) in support of her argument that the phrase “one story in\n\nheight” is not ambiguous as a matter of law. Appellee’s Br. at 28. Notably,\n\n\n                                     17\n\fthese findings of fact and conclusions of law do not discuss whether there is\n\nlanguage in those restrictions that define the “height” or whether there was\n\nan active ACC in that case. Further, there is no record or opinion from a\n\ncourt of appeals discussing the merits of the case, as the case was never\n\nappealed. Accordingly, the 191st District Court’s findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law are not legal authority and should not be considered by\n\nthis Court.\n\n              2.   Courts of appeal across various jurisdictions have\n                   held similar deed restriction language ambiguous\n                   as a matter of law\n\n      In Johnson v. Linton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1530704\"><a href=\"/opinion/1530704/johnson-v-linton/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">189</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.

Allen, 155 P.3d at 445-46.3\n\n       Indeed, for this latter reason, the Eastland Court of Appeals has held\n\nthat homes with finished portions of the attic are one-story homes as a\n\nmatter of law, because on the outside they appeared to be one-story homes.\n\nMorton v.

Because Price\n\nis a memorandum opinion that does not refer to or cite relevant Texas law,\n\nit should have no bearing on this Court’s analysis of this case. Moreover,\n\nPrice did not hold that the phrase “not to exceed one story in height” was\n\nunambiguous. Instead, it held that the phrase “one-story in height was\n\n“sufficiently clear to permit enforcement” under Arizona’s rules of\n\nconstruction, which explicitly reject the rule that ambiguous deed\n\n\n                                    21\n\frestrictions are construed in favor of the free use of the land.

In Texas, ambiguous deed restriction are construed\n\nstrictly against the party seeking to enforce them and in favor of the free\n\nand unrestricted use of the land. See e.g., See Pilarcik, 966 S.W.2d at 478–\n\n480.\n\n       The Arkansas case similarly does not support Wohlrabe’s position\n\nbecause the deed restriction in that case stated, “No two-story dwelling\n\nshall be constructed” on the property. Holmesley, 39 S.W.3d at 465. The\n\nterm “two-story dwelling” is much less ambiguous than the deed restriction\n\nat issue in this case, which prohibits the building of a home more than\n\n“one-story in height.” Id.\n\n       Finally, even though the California and Nevada cases cited by\n\nWohlrabe might indicate some disharmony over the issue of deed\n\nrestrictions like the one at issue in this case, there are two significant facts\n\nregarding this split of authorities. First, the cases supporting Wohlrabe’s\n\nposition are older, while the more recent cases that were rendered post\n\nJohnson v. Linton support BCH’s position. Second, and more importantly,\n\nthis Court has held that a similar phrase—“not to exceed one-half story in\n\nheight”—to be ambiguous as a matter of law. Johnson, 491 S.W.2d at 106–\n\n\n\n\n                                      22\n\f197. This Court should reaffirm its holding in Johnson and hold that the\n\ndeed restriction at issue in this case is ambiguous as a matter of law.\n\n      C.    The evidence in the summary judgment record\n            demonstrates the ambiguity of the phrase “one story in\n            height”\n\n            1.    BCH did not waive its argument that its proposed\n                  habitable attic was not a second story\n\n      BCH has argued vehemently from the very beginning that the home it\n\nwishes to construct did not violate the covenants because the home was not\n\na two-story home, nor did it exceed one-story in height. However,\n\nWohlrabe contends that BCH waived its argument that its proposed\n\nbuilding plans did not depict a second story under the commonly accepted\n\nmeaning of the term in the 1950s, when the covenants were promulgated.\n\nAppellees’ Br. at 41. This is wrong. While BCH did argue that the 2012 IRC\n\ndefinitions were instructive, BCH did not waive its right to also argue that—\n\neven under the applicable definitions from the 1950s—BCH’s proposed\n\nhome was not a two-story structure. Nor did it exceed one story in height.\n\nRather, BCH attached and cited to evidence, including affidavits and\n\ntestimony from Wohlrabe, Blanchard, Shekter, and Karl Evans in which the\n\n1950s definitions were specifically discussed. (3 SCR 72–102, 139–152,\n\n177–78; 5 CR 4637–4688; 6 CR 5512–29, 5371–5425.)                   Moreover,\n\nWohlrabe discussed these original definitions and Dallas Building Code\n\n                                      23\n\fprovisions in her own Motion for Summary Judgment. (4 CR 4163.) She\n\ncannot now claim that these provisions were not part of the arguments at\n\nsummary judgment and preclude BCH’s citation of them in this Court.\n\nAccordingly, BCH has not waived the argument that its building plans do\n\nnot violate Restrictive Covenant 1 under the definitions in the 1951 Dallas\n\nBuilding Code.\n\n            2.    Wohlrabe’s objections to Blanchard and Shekter’s\n                  affidavits are unfounded and were waived\n\n      While Wohlrabe argues that Blanchard’s testimony via his Amended\n\nAffidavit was inadmissible because his Amended Affidavit was unsigned\n\nand unsworn, Blanchard’s original Affidavit (attached to BCH’s preliminary\n\nresponse to Wohlrabe’s Motion for Summary Judgment) was signed and\n\nsworn. (3 SCR 72–102.) Blanchard’s original Affidavit and Amended\n\nAffidavit contain most of the same testimony, and Blanchard’s original\n\nAffidavit was incorporated by reference into BCH’s amended summary\n\njudgment response. (Id.; 6 CR 5423, 5426–5449.) Accordingly, Wohlrabe’s\n\nobjection on this ground is unfounded and irrelevant to the determination\n\nof this appeal.\n\n      Reasserting the arguments made in her written objection filed with\n\nthe trial court, Wohlrabe further argues that the affidavits of Blanchard and\n\nShekter were inadmissible because they were conclusory, irrelevant, and\n\n                                     24\n\fnot credible. Appellees’ Br. at 43–46; (6 CR 5700–5737.) However, for a\n\nruling on an objection to summary judgment evidence to be effective, the\n\nruling must be reduced to writing, signed by the trial court, and entered of\n\nrecord.

If the objecting party does not obtain a ruling on its\n\nobjections, objections as to the form of the affidavit are waived and the\n\nobjected-to material is in evidence. Id. (stating that the following objections\n\nconstitute objections as to form: that affidavit is hearsay; that affidavit of\n\ninterested witness is not clear, positive, credible, and free from\n\ncontradiction). Only objections that an affidavit is conclusory may be raised\n\nfor the first time on appeal. Id. Affidavits are conclusory if they do not\n\nprovide the underlying facts to support the conclusion. Id. at 855–86.\n\n      Wohlrabe did not obtain a written ruling from the trial court on her\n\nobjections to Blanchard and Shekter’s affidavits. As most of Wohlrabe’s\n\nobjections stem from her belief that the affidavits are not credible—or that\n\nthe affidavits simply provide testimony she disagrees with—the majority of\n\nWohlrabe’s objections were waived by her failure to obtain a written ruling\n\nin the trial court. To the extent that Wohlrabe argues the affidavits were\n\nconclusory, even a cursory review of the affidavits demonstrates they were\n\nnot. Blanchard’s affidavit is over 25 pages long and provides a detailed\n\n\n                                      25\n\fdescription of the facts and reasoning supporting his ultimate conclusion.\n\n(3 SCR 72–102.) Shekter’s affidavit is similarly thorough. (6 CR 5512–\n\n5529.) This is a far cry from what is sufficient to label an affidavit\n\nconclusory. Accordingly, Wohlrabe’s objections to Blanchard and Shekter’s\n\naffidavits are meritless and have been waived for purposes of this appeal.\n\n            3.    Conflicting expert testimony bolsters BCH’s\n                  allegation that “one story in height” is susceptible\n                  to more than one interpretation\n\n      In coming to its holding in Johnson v. Linton—that the deed\n\nrestriction prohibiting homes that exceeded “one and one-half (1-1/2) story\n\nin height” was ambiguous—this Court reasoned that the “vagueness and\n\nuncertainty of the phrases is classically illustrated by the testimony of the\n\nvarious experts” because each “expert in the field of architectural design\n\nhad his own idea and conception of what was meant by the phrases utilized\n\nin the restrictions.” Id. at 197. Here, just as in Johnson, experts for both\n\nsides put forth thoughtful, well-supported opinions regarding whether, in\n\ntheir opinion, a habitable attic constituted a “story” within the meaning of\n\nthe restrictive covenants.\n\n      BCH’s experts opined that the habitable attic depicted in BCH’s\n\nbuilding plans did not constitute a second “story” within the meaning of the\n\nrestrictions. (3 SCR 72–102; 6 CR 5426-5449, 5512-5529.) Both experts\n\n\n                                     26\n\fstated that they believed BCH’s building plans were in full compliance with\n\nthe restrictive covenants. (6 CR 5441-5442, 5528.) Specifically, Blanchard\n\ntestified that the home BCH intends to build would have no exterior second\n\nfloor plate lines, the entire roof assembly of the home sits on the ground\n\nfloor plate line, and the home lacked any architecturally defined features\n\nthat would be required for a home to be architecturally defined as a two-\n\nstory home. (6 CR 5430.) Both Blanchard and Shekter testified that the\n\ninclusion of the phrase “ground floor area” within restriction #2 indicates\n\nthat the drafters did not intend to prohibit a two-story home or a home with\n\na habitable attic. (6 CR 5437, 5524-5525.) Conversely, Wohlrabe’s expert\n\ntestified that they believed that a habitable attic created a home that is\n\nmore than “one-story in height” within the meaning of the covenants and\n\nthat BCH’s proposed building plans were thus in violation. (2 RR 25-26;\n\n143.)\n\n        Thus, the experts on both sides of this case had their own ideas and\n\nconceptions regarding what they believed was meant by the phrase “one-\n\nstory in height.” (Id.); cf. Johnson, 491 S.W.2d at 197 (“[C]an we say that\n\nthe questioned phrases contained in the restrictive recitations are so clear\n\nthat but one reasonable meaning for each respective phrase has clearly\n\nemerged? The mere reading of the phrases themselves and the reading of\n\n\n                                     27\n\fthe testimony of the experts who attempted to define the same answers the\n\nquestion in the negative.”). This split in expert opinions classically\n\nillustrates the ambiguity of the deed restrictions.\n\n            4.    Testimony from Wohlrabe and Wohlrabe’s expert\n                  further demonstrates the ambiguity of the phrase\n                  “one story in height”\n\n      The ambiguity of the phrase “not to exceed one story in height” in this\n\ncase is manifest by Wohlrabe’s admission at the November 25, 2013\n\ntemporary injunction hearing that if BCH did not finish out the attic, and\n\njust left the exact same size attic unfinished, it would not be a violation of\n\nthe restrictive covenant. (3 SCR 160–61; 166.) The ambiguity is further\n\ndemonstrated in the testimony that was provided by Wohlrabe’s expert,\n\nBob Brendle, who testified at the November 7, 2013 temporary injunction\n\nhearing that if the area in dispute was totally unfinished, but the design and\n\nheight were otherwise the same, the house would only be one-story and the\n\nrestrictive covenants would not be violated. (2 RR 183-184.) Brendle also\n\ntestified similarly in his deposition—an excerpt of which was attached to\n\nBCH’s summary judgment response—that even a building that was 40 feet\n\nhigh could be in compliance with the restrictions if it was only one story. (3\n\nSCR 234.) The obvious purpose of the “not to exceed one story in height”\n\nrestriction is to restrict the height of the exterior of the homes within the\n\n\n                                      28\n\fAddition; the restrictions were not intended to regulate how homeowners\n\nuse the interior of their homes.\n\n      Accordingly, the meaning of the term “one story in height,” without\n\nfurther definition or specification, is ambiguous. Because it is ambiguous,\n\nthis Court must interpret the restrictive covenants in BCH’s favor, as\n\nambiguity must be resolved in favor of the unrestricted use of the premises.\n\nUnder BCH’s interpretation of the restrictive language, BCH’s building\n\nplans did not violate the restrictive covenants because the phrase “one story\n\nin height” does not restrict a homeowner from building a home with a\n\nfinished/habitable attic space or a second story. Accordingly, Wohlrabe was\n\nnot entitled to summary judgment or a permanent injunction.\n\n      D.    Wohlrabe’s subjective interpretation of the Restrictive\n            Covenant 1 renders it meaningless\n\n      Wherever possible, a covenant should be construed to give effect to all\n\nof the provisions and to avoid rendering any provision meaningless. Crispin\n\nv. Paragon Homes, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1493939\"><a href=\"/opinion/1493939/crispin-v-paragon-homes-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">888</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 82 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n1994, writ denied). Wohlrabe argues that BCH’s interpretation of\n\nRestrictive Covenant 1 as a “height” restriction, rather than a “story”\n\nrestriction, is not reasonable because it is “nonsensical to say that the\n\ncreators intended to limit the “height” of the homes but then neglected to\n\nprovide a numerical height limitation.” Appellees’ Br. at 37. This is illogical.\n\n                                      29\n\fWohlrabe’s argument that the only reasonable interpretation of the\n\ncovenant as a “story restriction” renders the covenant’s “in height” language\n\nsuperfluous and meaningless. This is in direct contradiction to the clear\n\nrule prohibiting an interpretation that renders language in covenants\n\nmeaningless.\n\n      The fact that the restriction could reasonably be interpreted as either\n\na “story” or “height” restriction leads to the only logical conclusion—that\n\nthe language in Restrictive Covenant 1 is ambiguous because it is subject to\n\nmore than one reasonable interpretation. Consequently, the covenant must\n\nbe interpreted strictly against Wohlrabe and in favor of the free and\n\nunrestricted use of the land. That is, the covenants must be construed in\n\nline with BCH’s interpretation—the practical result of which being that\n\nBCH’s proposed building plans are deemed not in violation of Restrictive\n\nCovenant 1.\n\nII.   BCH’s affirmative defenses of impossibility, waiver,\n      estoppel, and unclean hands precluded summary judgment\n\n      A.      The trial court erred in granting summary judgment\n              and denying BCH’s Motion to Reconsider because\n              there was a fact issue on BCH’s affirmative defense of\n              impossibility\n\n      The restrictive covenants at issue charge the ACC with the\n\nresponsibility of approving and disapproving building plans for homes\n\n\n                                     30\n\fwithin the Addition. Part of the criteria considered by the ACC must be\n\nwhether the plan complied with the restrictive covenants.\n\n     In this case, the ACC is clearly necessary for performance of BCH’s\n\nobligations under Paragraphs 8-10 of the deed restrictions. Specifically,\n\nparagraphs 8, 9, and 10 of the deed restrictions provide that the ACC is the\n\nonly entity that has the power to approve or disapprove of “constriction\n\nplans and specifications” based on “quality of workmanship and materials,\n\nharmony of external design with existing structures, and as to the location\n\nwith respect to topography and finish grade elevation.” (14 RR 304-305.)\n\nFurther, in the event the ACC, or its designated representative, fails to\n\napprove or disapprove within 30 days after plans and specification have\n\nbeen submitted to it, or in any event, if no suit to enjoin the construction\n\nhas been commenced prior to the completion thereof, approval will not be\n\nrequired and the covenants shall be deemed to have been fully complied\n\nwith. (Id.) There is nothing in the deed restrictions that give any of the\n\nhomeowners or the LHPOA the right to bypass or usurp the ACC’s authority\n\nto approve or disapprove of “construction plans and specifications.”\n\n     All members of the ACC are deceased and, at the time BCH completed\n\nits building plans, there was no ACC in existence for BCH to submit its\n\nplans to, as required by the restrictive covenants. (8 CR 6662-6664.) That\n\n\n                                    31\n\fis, it was impossible for BCH to obtain approval, as required by the deed\n\nrestrictions. Accordingly, the doctrine of impossibility excused BCH from\n\nobtaining approval. Further, even if it were possible for BCH to get\n\napproval, the plans were deemed approved because they were sent to the\n\nlisted members of the ACC and no response was received.\n\n     Because the restrictive covenants were impossible to comply with, the\n\ntrial court erred in granting summary judgment and denying BCH’s Motion\n\nto Reconsider.\n\n     B.    The trial court erred in granting summary judgment as\n           to BCH’s waiver defense\n\n     In order to establish the affirmative defense of waiver in a deed\n\nrestriction case, the nonconforming user must prove that violations then-\n\nexisting are so great as to lead the mind of an “average man” to reasonably\n\nconclude that the restriction in question has been abandoned and its\n\nenforcement waived. New Jerusalem Baptist Church, Inc. v. City of\n\nHouston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2437652\"><a href=\"/opinion/2437652/new-jerusalem-baptist-church-inc-v-city-of-houston/\"><span class=\"volume\">598</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">666</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 669 (Tex. App.—Houston 1980, no writ). Among\n\nthe factors to be considered by the “average man” are the number, nature,\n\nand severity of the then-existing violations, any prior acts of enforcement of\n\nthe restriction, and whether it is still possible to realize to a substantial\n\ndegree the benefits intended through the covenant. Id.\n\n\n\n                                     32\n\f      The majority of Wohlrabe’s argument as to BCH’s waiver defense is\n\nthat only one other house in the Addition violated Restrictive Covenant 1’s\n\nprohibition on two-story homes. However, the ratio of violations to lots\n\nwithin a subdivision is only one factor courts consider when determining\n\nwhether the then-existing violations were so great, such as to support\n\nwaiver. New Jerusalem Baptist Church, Inc., 598 S.W.2d at 669 (listing\n\nother factors such as nature and severity of then-existing violations). Even a\n\nsingle violation can constitute waiver if it is sufficiently severe as to lead an\n\n“average man” to reasonable conclude that the restriction in question has\n\nbeen abandoned. See generally id.\n\n      There is a full two-story home at 6144 Monticello—which is the lot\n\nthat sits directly next to the lot owned by BCH at 6148 Monticello, where\n\nthe proposed home was to be built. (3 RR 109–110; 5 CR 4218.) The home\n\nat 6144 Monticello measures 30.90 feet in height, which is 5 ½ feet higher\n\nthan the home BCH proposed to build on the neighboring lot. (6 CR 5426–\n\n5439, 5490–5494, 5512–5529.) In further contrast to the home proposed in\n\nBCH’s building plans, the two-story house at 6144 Monticello has gabled\n\nwindows on the front of the house in the roof, a second story exterior plate\n\nline, and second story windows that are clearly seen from the exterior of the\n\nhome. (6 CR 5426–5439, 5490–5494, 5512–5529.)\n\n\n                                       33\n\f     The second floor addition and second floor plate lines at 6144\n\nMonticello are far more significant and substantial than the alleged breach\n\npresented by BCH’s building plans. That is, the impact of the full second\n\nstory at 6144 Monticello on the neighborhood was far greater than any\n\nimpact that could result from BCH’s proposed building plans. On this basis\n\nalone, waiver is supported.\n\n     C.    The trial court erred in granting summary judgment as\n           to BCH’s estoppel defense\n\n     Quasi-estoppel precludes a party from asserting, to another’s\n\ndisadvantage, a right inconsistent with a position previously taken.\n\nCimarron Country Prop.

However, actual knowledge is not required for a finding of\n\nestoppel. Rather, the knowledge requirement is met by a showing of\n\nconstructive knowledge. See e.g., Nash v. Beckett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2541672\"><a href=\"/opinion/2541672/nash-v-beckett/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">131</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 143–44\n\n(Tex. App.—Texarkana 2012, pet. denied). Thus, because subsequent\n\ngrantees are charged with constructive knowledge of restrictive covenants\n\non their properties when those covenants are on file in the county deed\n\nrecords, the property owners in the Addition here had constructive\n\nknowledge of Restrictive Covenant 1. See Musgrave v.

App.—Texarkana 1999, pet.\n\ndenied).\n\n      The homeowners within the Addition permitted violations of the\n\nrestrictive covenants to occur for many years without any objection and\n\nmost, if not all, of the homeowners admittedly violated one or more deed\n\nrestrictions Wohlrabe seeks to enforce. (6 CR 5442-5446; 4 RR 14.)\n\nMoreover, most of the homeowners that comprise LHPOA lived in the\n\n\n                                   35\n\fAddition when, for example, the Stillos remodeled their home in violation\n\nof the deed restrictions and when the house at 6144 Monticello was\n\nremodeled into a full two-story home measuring 30.90 feet in height. (2 RR\n\n109-110; 6 RR 5426-5449.) This is a prime example of the type of prior\n\nacquiescence contemplated by the doctrine of quasi-estoppel. Accordingly,\n\nthe trial court erred in granting summary judgment as to BCH’s estoppel\n\ndefense.\n\n     D.    The trial court erred in granting summary judgment as\n           to BCH’s unclean hands defense\n\n     Wohlrabe’s argument that BCH is preclude from asserting unclean\n\nhands because the homeowners did not own the properties at the time the\n\nviolations occurred is inapposite. Because real covenants run with the land,\n\nit is of no consequence to the application of the unclean hands defense that\n\na homeowner did not own the property in question at the time the violation\n\nof the deed restrictions occurred. See Inwood N.

(reasoning that because the\n\n                                    36\n\feasement at issue was similar to a restrictive covenant, it was enforceable at\n\nany time, regardless of whether the homeowner owned the property when\n\nthe violation occurred). Thus, if a party’s culpability for a deed restriction\n\nviolation is not dependent on the party’s possession of the property at the\n\ntime the violation occurred, a party cannot avoid the application of the\n\nunclean hands doctrine by acquiring a property after a violation occurs.\n\nThis long-established rule is actually reflected in the deed restrictions in\n\nthis case, which state that “[i]f the parties hereto, or any of them, or their\n\nheirs or assigns shall violate or attempt to violate any of the covenants\n\nherein, it shall be lawful for any other person or persons owning real\n\nproperty as hereinabove described to prosecute any proceedings at law or in\n\nequity against the person. . .” (14 RR 304.)\n\n      Several of the members comprising LHPOA have admittedly violated\n\nthe deed restrictions at issue.

In fact,\n\nWohlrabe herself testified at the November 25, 2013 hearing that some of\n\nthe wood siding on the back of her house and garage set-back was in\n\nviolation of the restrictive covenants.

App.—Waco 2001, no pet.).\n\n     It is common for deed restrictions to contain provisions providing\n\nthat if building plans or specifications are not approved in writing by the\n\nACC by a certain number of days, the plans or specifications are deemed\n\napproved by the ACC. While Wohlrabe claims the ACC does not have the\n\npower to approve plans that violate the restrictive covenants, the Texas\n\nSupreme Court has held that such provisions are recognized to be “default\n\nconsequences in the event the ACC does not act swiftly enough.” Pilarcik,\n\n966 S.W.2d at 40, n.3.\n\n     Wohlrabe contends there were no changed circumstances to support\n\ndissolution. However, the record contains evidence that BCH did attempt to\n\n                                     38\n\fseek ACC approval by mailing their building plans to the named ACC\n\nmembers set out in the covenants, but that BCH received no response. (8\n\nCR 6554, 6623-6635, 6661-6664.) Thus, BCH’s construction plans were\n\ndeemed approved, as the 30-day window in which the ACC could\n\ndisapprove closed with BCH receiving no response. (8 CR 6345-6471.)\n\nThese changed circumstances rendered the permanent injunction invalid\n\nand improper due to the doctrine of deemed approval. Accordingly, the trial\n\ncourt abused its discretion when it denied BCH’s Motion to Dissolve.\n\nIV.   The trial court erred when it granted summary judgment as\n      to BCH’s counter claims against Wohlrabe and the other\n      members of the LHPOA\n\n      Even if BCH’s counterclaims against Wohlrabe were barred at the\n\ntime originally asserted, on January 9, 2014, Wohlrabe and the other\n\nmembers of the LHPOA asserted affirmative claims against BCH. (4 CR\n\n2728–2744.) These affirmative claims sought a declaratory judgment that\n\nWohlrabe and the other members did not violate the very deed restrictions\n\nthat BCH alleged they did violate. Because Wohlrabe and the other\n\nmembers initiated this action for affirmative relief against Blanchard on\n\nJanuary 9, 2014, BCH could then assert any counterclaims or cross-claim\n\nagainst Wohlrabe and the other members arising out of the same\n\ntransaction or occurrence, so long as it did so “not later than the 30th day\n\n\n                                    39\n\fafter the date on which the party’s answer is required.” Tex. Civ. Prac. &\n\nRem. Code § 16.069. BCH’s live pleading at that time already asserted its\n\nclaim for affirmative relief against Wohlrabe and the other members, and\n\nthat claim for affirmative relief arose out of the very deed restriction\n\nviolations that Wohlrabe and the other members’ affirmative claim\n\naddressed. So, BCH’s claim against Wohlrabe and the other members arose\n\nout of the same transaction or occurrence as Wohlrabe and the other\n\nmembers’ affirmative claims against BCH. Fallis v. River Mountain Ranch\n\nProp.

And it was asserted “not\n\nlater than the 30th day after the date on which the party’s answer was\n\nrequired.” Thus, BCH’s claims are not time barred by the statute of\n\nlimitations. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 16.069.\n\n                             CONCLUSION\n\n     There was no basis to grant summary judgment against BCH. The\n\ntrial court erred in doing so. But the problem was deeper than simply an\n\nerroneous grant of summary judgment.\n\n     As argued extensively in a companion mandamus filed by BCH and\n\ngranted by this Court, the “fix is in” in the trial court.

The Trial Court Grants Wohlrabe’s Declaratory Judgment ......19\n\n        II.     The Jury Awards $290,000 in Reasonable Attorney’s Fees .... 20\n\n        III.    The Trial Court Ignores the Jury Verdict ................................. 24\n\nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT.............................................................. 24\n\nARGUMENT................................................................................................ 27\n\n        I.      Mandamus relief is available and necessary to review a\n                trial court’s order granting a new trial on legally invalid\n                grounds. .................................................................................... 27\n\n                A.      Mandamus may issue to reverse a court’s order\n                        granting a new trial on unstated or legally invalid\n                        grounds. .......................................................................... 27\n\n                B.      The trial court’s order granting a new trial on\n                        attorney’s fees has left BCH without an adequate\n                        remedy on appeal. ........................................................... 29\n\n        II.     Granting new trial for BCH’s purportedly improper\n                questions and argument is a legally invalid ground. ................ 30\n\n                                                      4\n\n                                                    TAB 1\n\fA.   To preserve error for evidence or argument, a party\n     must timely object, obtain a ruling, and request an\n     instruction to disregard, unless it is incurable. ................31\n\nB.   The trial court clearly abused its discretion in\n     granting a new trial for purported violations of the\n     limine orders. .................................................................. 33\n\n     1.      Purported violations of the limine order on\n             the law of block billing did not justify a new\n             trial......................................................................... 35\n     2.      Eliciting testimony regarding the\n             unreasonableness of the hours billed did not\n             justify a new trial. .................................................. 39\n     3.      Arguing a floor on attorney’s fees of $150,000\n             in closing argument did not justify a new trial. ..... 42\nC.   Other jury arguments by BCH were not improper,\n     not objected to by Wohlrabe, and not incurable. ............ 45\n\n     1.      BCH’s argument that this case was a “money\n             grab” was not improper, was not objected to\n             by Wohlrabe, and was not incurable...................... 46\n     2.      BCH’s argument questioning the formation of\n             the homeowner’s association was not\n             improper, was not objected to by Wohlrabe,\n             and was not incurable. ........................................... 49\n     3.      BCH’s argument regarding the suspect nature\n             of the fee arrangement was not improper, was\n             not objected to by Wohlrabe, and was not\n             incurable. ............................................................... 50\n     4.      BCH’s argument regarding failure to segregate\n             cannot serve as a proper basis for a new trial. ....... 52\nD.   The purported indiscretions by BCH in questions\n     and argument cannot serve as the proper basis for a\n     new trial, individually or cumulatively............................ 53\n\n                                  5\n\n                                 TAB 1\n\f        III.     There was factually sufficient evidence to support the\n                 jury’s award of attorney’s fees in the amount of $290,000. ..... 54\n\n                 A.      It is of no consequence that the amount $290,000\n                         was not uttered specifically by a witness. ........................ 55\n\n                 B.      The attorney’s fees sought by Wohlrabe were\n                         contradicted. ................................................................... 57\n\nCONCLUSION............................................................................................. 62\n\nPRAYER ...................................................................................................... 64\n\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE....................................................................... 65\n\nCERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO TEX.

The mandamus stems solely from a\n                   jury trial on attorney’s fees. Specifically, the trial\n                   court granted summary judgment on Wohlrabe’s\n                   declaratory judgment. (MR Tab D at 4–5.) A jury\n                   trial ensued on attorney’s fees. The jury awarded\n                   $290,000 to Wohlrabe in reasonable attorney’s\n                   fees.

An order granting a new trial must articulate reasons in support that\n\n     are specific and legally correct. Here, the stated bases in the trial\n\n     court’s order granting new trial are summarized as (a) BCH violated\n\n     limine orders in its questions to witnesses, (b) BCH made improper\n\n     jury arguments in closing argument, and (c) the evidence was\n\n     factually insufficient to support the jury’s award of $290,000 in\n\n     attorney’s fees. Did the trial court clearly abuse its discretion\n\n     in granting a new trial, leaving BCH without an adequate\n\n     remedy by appeal, when:\n\n       a. the purported limine violations were not violations or improper\n          at all, were not objected to with a request for an instruction to\n          disregard or motion for mistrial, or were not incurable such that\n          no objection was necessary;\n       b. BCH’s jury arguments, made in large part without any objection\n          from Wohlrabe, were based on inferences drawn from the\n          evidence, and at no time did Wohlrabe request an instruction to\n          disregard or move for mistrial; and\n       c. there was factually sufficient evidence contradicting Wohlrabe’s\n          claim that $579,000 was a reasonable attorney’s fees for the\n          work done on the declaratory judgment claim, and that\n          $290,000 was within the range of a reasonable attorney’s fees\n          for the work?\n\n\n                                   12\n\n                                   TAB 1\n\f                              INTRODUCTION\n\n                  Equal justice under law.\n  Supreme Court Building—Supreme Court of the United States\n\n      As long as the United States Supreme Court has sat in its own\n\nbuilding, these words have served as a beacon over the entrance. The\n\nphrase, based in the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution,\n\nguarantees this inalienable right to all litigants.\n\n      This short phrase is actually two guarantees. First, “equal justice”\n\nseeks to guarantee that no one, in any court, is given preferential treatment.\n\nNot based on wealth. Or race. Or status. Or a judge’s affection for the\n\nlawyers on one side.\n\n      Second, “under law” means subjective notions of fairness do not\n\ntrump established legal principles. In other words, a judge cannot pick the\n\nwinner despite the law compelling a different result.\n\n\n          The right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate.\n                        Tex. Const. art. I, § 15\n\n      Contrary to equal justice under law, the judge in County Court at Law\n\nNo. 1 in Dallas County has administered—throughout the pendency of the\n\nunderlying case—unequal justice above the law. Unequal because the judge\n\nhas played favorites towards one party and her lawyers. Above the law\n\nbecause the judge’s preference for one side has trumped legal principles.\n\n                                       13\n\n                                       TAB 1\n\f      This mandamus does not intend to point out all examples of unequal\n\njustice above the law. It will focus only on one: the trial court’s granting of a\n\nnew trial on attorney’s fees as a result of the jury’s failure to award as much\n\nmoney as the favored party and her attorneys asked the jury to award. This\n\njury trial occurred after the trial court granted summary judgment on the\n\nfavored party’s declaratory judgment claims in a deed restriction case. As\n\nthere were no actual damages claimed, the only issue for jury trial—before\n\nan appeal on the declaratory judgment claims—was attorney’s fees. During\n\npre-trial, the trial court severely hamstrung the disfavored party by limiting\n\nthe matters on which its attorney’s fees’ expert could testify in refuting the\n\nfavored party’s claim for attorney’s fees.\n\n      Given the trial court’s affection for the favored party, the disfavored\n\nparty assumed that every single ruling—discretionary or otherwise—would\n\ngo against it at trial. This would prove to be a correct assumption. But the\n\ndisfavored party nevertheless took solace in trying the attorney’s fees claim\n\nto a jury, for at least four reasons.\n\n      First, the disfavored party would finally be in front of a jury, who\n\ncould administer equal justice under law, without playing favorites.\n\n      Second, the favored party was not seeking actual damages yet was\n\nseeking almost $600,000 in attorney’s fees. Who was the client who had\n\n\n                                        14\n\n                                        TAB 1\n\fincurred these fees? A lawyer at the law firm representing the favored\n\nparty. The lawyer is the client, and the client is the lawyer. Further, the\n\n“client” and “attorney” had a contingency fee agreement, despite this\n\nincestuous relationship and no actual damages.\n\n      Given this arrangement and the exorbitant fees sought, the disfavored\n\nparty liked its chances in arguing this claim for attorney’s fees was nothing\n\nmore than a fee-generating mechanism for the law firm. A “lawyer money\n\ngrab,” if you will.\n\n      Third, the disfavored party liked it chances cross-examining the\n\nfavored party’s attorney’s fees’ expert—an attorney at the law firm where\n\nthe client/lawyer worked. The disfavored party believed they had numerous\n\ncross-examination points—from failing to segregate fees, to block billing\n\n(which prevented the jury from determining recoverable and reasonable\n\nfees), to the inexperience of the favored party’s attorneys in handling deed\n\nrestriction cases.\n\n      Fourth, the disfavored party had its own attorney’s fees expert. He\n\nwas an experienced deed restriction lawyer. He had represented the\n\ndisfavored party in the case. He could speak to handling a deed restriction\n\ncase and what fees would reasonably be expected to be incurred in a typical,\n\neven contentious, case. The disfavored party would present this as a\n\n\n                                     15\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\fsuggested floor on attorney’s fees, leaving the amount to be awarded up to\n\nthe jury.\n\n      With this in mind, the claim for attorney’s fees proceeded to a jury\n\ntrial. The disfavored party was correct in its assumption—every single\n\nruling of substance went against it. But the four above-noted reasons and\n\nstrategies gave it hope that the jury would reduce the fees sought by the\n\nfavored party.\n\n      And this is precisely what happened. A thoughtful jury paid attention\n\nto all the evidence in awarding attorney’s fees. The jury apparently listened\n\nto the relationship between the favored party as the client and as the lawyer\n\nin the case, and the favored party’s attorney’s fees expert as the\n\nclient/lawyer’s boss. The favored party’s expert on attorney’s fees also\n\nreported he was the boss of the favored party’s lead lawyer and that the lead\n\nlawyer answered to him in the case. The jury apparently also listened to\n\ncross-examination of the favored party’s attorney’s fees expert on the\n\naforementioned matters. And the jury heard from the disfavored party’s\n\nattorney’s fees’ expert, who testified what should reasonably be incurred in\n\nterms of hours spent by lawyers in prosecuting a typical, albeit contentious,\n\ndeed restriction case. Finally, the jury apparently listened to closing\n\n\n\n\n                                     16\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\farguments, in which the disfavored party argued that this arrangement and\n\nthe attorney’s fees sought reflected a “lawyer money grab.”\n\n     What did the jury do with this evidence? Essentially it awarded\n\nattorney’s fees in an amount in between what the favored party advocated,\n\nand what the disfavored party asked that it consider. More than the floor.\n\nLess than the ceiling. The jury awarded $290,000, to be precise.\n\n\n      Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\n                    Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\n     All that appeared to be left after the jury’s verdict on attorney’s fees\n\nwas entering judgment. The claims for declaratory relief were already\n\ndecided—in favor of the favored party—on summary judgment. Once a\n\njudgment was entered on the jury verdict on attorney’s fees, the parties\n\ncould appeal as they saw fit, on all issues ranging from the declaratory\n\njudgment to attorney’s fees.\n\n     The disfavored party filed a motion for entry of judgment simply\n\nseeking entry of judgment on the jury verdict. The favored party sought a\n\njudgment notwithstanding the verdict, or alternatively a new trial, arguing\n\nthat the jury didn’t award enough in attorney’s fees.\n\n     The trial court heard these motions together, taking them under\n\nadvisement. By order entered September 21, 2016, the trial court granted\n\n\n                                     17\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\fthe favored party’s motion for new trial. The order granting a new trial on\n\nattorney’s fees can be summarized as stating three (albeit improper)\n\ngrounds.\n\n     First, the disfavored party supposedly elicited testimony on a lowered\n\namount of attorney’s fees that was not allowed based on the court’s rulings\n\nthroughout trial against the disfavored party.\n\n     Second, the disfavored party apparently engaged in improper jury\n\nargument by arguing that the claim for attorney’s fees was a “lawyer money\n\ngrab.”\n\n     Third, the jury wasn’t told an exact number that should be the floor\n\non attorney’s fees, and thus was required to award the ceiling. Related, the\n\njury never heard the actual amount it awarded, $290,000, and thus could\n\nnot award this amount.\n\n     The order granting new trial is long. Many “indiscretions” noted in it\n\nwere not objected to by the favored party during trial—including the\n\n“lawyer money grab” jury argument. Others reflect proper lines of\n\nquestioning and argument in a case where attorney’s fees are sought,\n\nparticularly when approximately $580,000 is sought in fees, the attorney\n\nand the client are the same, and there are no actual damages. Finally, at no\n\n\n\n\n                                     18\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\ftime did the favored party seek a mistrial for these or any other supposed\n\nindiscretions.\n\n      More fundamentally, none of these stated reasons is a proper ground\n\nfor granting a new trial. The trial court clearly abused its discretion in\n\ngranting a new trial on attorney’s fees. The court improperly stripped the\n\njury of its duty in faithfully rendering a verdict.\n\n      In granting a new trial, the trial court ignored equal justice under law.\n\nInstead, it carried out unequal justice above the law. The court’s favoritism\n\nand outcome-determinative approach—all the while stripping the jury of its\n\nverdict on the fact-driven claim of attorney’s fees—should not stand.\n\n      This Court should reverse and render judgment on attorney’s fees\n\nconsistent with the jury’s verdict. Alternatively, the Court should reverse\n\nand instruct the trial court to do so.\n\n                          STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\nI.    The Trial Court Grants Wohlrabe’s Declaratory Judgment\n\n      The underlying case is a deed restriction case. (MR Tab B at 4–10.)\n\nWohlrabe—acting as both a plaintiff and an attorney in the case—created\n\nthe Association and brought suit against BCH and Blanchard Homes, LLC.\n\n(MR Tab B at 18; MR Tab N at 126.) She sought to enforce a deed\n\n\n\n\n                                         19\n\n                                         TAB 1\n\frestriction that prohibited building a house with more than one story. (MR\n\nTab B at 4–5.)\n\n      The case has lingered in the trial court since October 13, 2013. (MR\n\nTab A at 1.) Eventually, Wohlrabe sought a summary judgment on the\n\ndeclaratory judgment. (MR Tab C at 11.) The trial court granted Wohlrabe’s\n\nmotions for summary judgment, including granting a permanent injunction\n\nthat prevented BCH and Blanchard Homes, LLC from building the home in\n\nthe neighborhood. (MR Tab D at 4–5.) This endeavor by Wohlrabe—\n\ncreating a homeowners’ association and seeking a declaratory judgment on\n\nthe deed restrictions—apparently ran up attorney’s fees at her law firm of\n\nalmost $580,000. (MR Tab M at 58–89; MR Tab N at 182.)\n\n      Wohlrabe also originally asserted a claim for tortious interference.\n\n(MR Tab B at 19.) But this is not a claim for which attorney’s fees was\n\navailable. Wohlrabe abandoned this claim before the jury trial on attorney’s\n\nfees. Wohlrabe also nonsuited Blanchard Homes, LLC shortly before the\n\ntrial on attorney’s fees. (MR Tab E at 2; MR Tab F at 1–2.).\n\nII.   The Jury Awards $290,000 in Reasonable Attorney’s Fees\n\n      Sometime after obtaining summary judgment, Wohlrabe proceeded\n\nto a jury trial on attorney’s fees. David Elrod was designated as Wohlrabe’s\n\nexpert on attorney’s fees. (MR Tab H at 2.) Travis Kitchens was designated\n\n\n                                     20\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\fas BCH’s expert to refute Elrod’s testimony and address the reasonableness\n\nof the fees sought by Wohlrabe. (MR Tab G at 20.)\n\n     Elrod is the boss of Wohlrabe and supervises Brian Farlow, lead trial\n\ncounsel for the Association. (MR Tab N at 14.) He testified that his firm—\n\ndespite seeking no actual damages—had a contingency fee agreement with\n\nWohlrabe, the client/attorney. (MR Tab M at 43.) From this arrangement,\n\nElrod testified that $579,954.45 were attorney’s fees attributable to the\n\ndeclaratory judgment claims. (MR Tab M at 91; MR Tab N at 183.) He\n\nfurther testified that segregated amounts were already taken out of this\n\namount. (MR Tab M at 38-39, 43-44, 89-94.) Elrod further stated that the\n\nfees were reasonable in light of the extensive work that had been put into\n\nthe case. (MR Tab N at 79.)\n\n     On cross-examination Elrod admitted that he had never before taken\n\na homeowners’ case on a contingency fee basis. (MR Tab M at 103.) BCH\n\nfurther established that Elrod did not specialize in homeowners’ association\n\ncases, having handled only one of them before. (MR Tab M at 103.) The\n\ncross-examination also involved going through numerous time entries\n\nwhich were so heavily redacted and block billed that it could not reasonably\n\nbe determined (1) whether entries related to the claim for which fees were\n\n\n\n\n                                    21\n\n                                    TAB 1\n\frecoverable, and (2) whether tasks and time spent were reasonable. (MR\n\nTab M at 121–26.)\n\n        In BCH’s case-in-chief, Travis Kitchens testified. (MR N at 54.)\n\nDrawing on the experience gained from handling over two hundred\n\nhomeowners’ cases, Kitchens testified that the billing method and extensive\n\nredactions by Wohlrabe’s law firm made it nearly impossible to determine\n\nwhether the fees had been properly segregated. (MR Tab N at 115.) Kitchens\n\nalso testified that Wohlrabe’s extended delay in filing her motion for\n\nsummary judgment, in which Wohlrabe ultimately prevailed, led to a\n\nsignificant amount of additional, unnecessary work and fees. (MR Tab N at\n\n95–96.) In this regard, Kitchens went through the docket sheet and noted a\n\none-year delay from when summary judgment could have been sought and\n\nwhen summary judgment was sought and granted. (MR Tab N at 79.) The\n\nattorney’s fees during this one-year delay were $361,000. (See MR Tab N at\n\n79; MR Tab O at 1–3.) Subtracted from $579,954.45, this “floor” would be\n\n$218,117.95. For these and other reasons, Kitchens testified that in his\n\nopinion the fees sought by Wohlrabe were unreasonable. (MR Tab N at\n\n154.)\n\n        But he didn’t stop there. He also testified that there is a typical and\n\nreasonable manner in which a deed restriction case, in his vast experience,\n\n\n                                       22\n\n                                       TAB 1\n\fshould be handled. (MR Tab N at 58–105.) Going through task by task, he\n\nexplained a range of hours it should take to handle this type of case, even if\n\ncontentious like this one. (MR Tab N at 97–105.) The outer limit of this\n\nrange totaled 620 hours. (Id.) Using the billable rate of Wohlrabe’s lead\n\ntrial counsel, this outer limit would result in a “floor” of $170,500. (See MR\n\nTab M at 46.) Using the lower limit of the range would result in a much\n\nlower amount more in the range of $150,000. (MR Tab M at 46; MR Tab N\n\nat 97–105.)\n\n      After all evidence, the parties presented closing arguments. (MR Tab\n\nN at 176–198.) Wohlrabe advocated for an award of $579,954.45. (MR Tab\n\nN at 177.)\n\n      BCH argued that the fees sought by Wohlrabe and her law firm\n\nconstituted a “lawyer money grab.” (MR Tab N at 186.) BCH then\n\nadvocated for a lower amount, either as low as the floors or by reducing the\n\nceiling advocated by Wohlrabe. (See MR Tab N at 192.) Counsel for\n\nWohlrabe objected repeatedly to BCH’s arguments, and every objection was\n\nsustained—even when no basis for the objection was stated. (MR Tab N at\n\n186–93.) Notably, though, counsel for Wohlrabe did not object to the\n\nmoney grab argument. (MR Tab N at 186–87.) Also, at no time during\n\nclosing argument did Wohlrabe request an instruction to the jury to\n\n\n                                     23\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\fdisregard or move for a mistrial. (See MR Tab N at 186–93.) In fact, at no\n\ntime throughout the trial did Wohlrabe move for a mistrial, despite the\n\nnumerous claimed indiscretions by BCH.\n\n      After closing arguments, the jury deliberated. The jury rendered a\n\nverdict that awarded Wohlrabe $290,000 in reasonable attorney’s fees.\n\n(MR Tab Tab I at 3.)\n\nIII. The Trial Court Ignores the Jury Verdict\n\n      The trial court ignored the jury’s verdict, granting a new trial for\n\nWohlrabe on attorney’s fees. (MR Tab L at 6; Apx. 1 at 6.) In its order, the\n\ncourt advocated that violations of the court’s limine order and part of BCH’s\n\njury argument were improper, incurable, and likely led to an improper\n\nverdict. (MR Tab L at 5; Apx. 1 at 5.) The order further stated that the\n\nevidence was factually insufficient for the jury to only award $290,000.\n\n(MR Tab L at 5; Apx. 1 at 5.)\n\n                   SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n      When a trial court grants a new trial on legally invalid grounds,\n\ncourts of appeals may conduct a “merits review” of the correctness of the\n\nnew trial order. Here, the trial court granted Wohlrabe’s motion for new\n\ntrial, stating that violations of the court’s limine orders and improper jury\n\narguments likely led to the rendition of an improper judgment. The court\n\n\n                                     24\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\falso stated that a new trial was appropriate because the evidence was\n\nfactually insufficient to support the jury’s verdict. These grounds,\n\nindividually or collectively, are legally incorrect and do not support\n\nproperly granting a new trial.\n\n      As to the limine orders, purported violations were not valid grounds\n\nfor the grant of new trial because a limine violation alone is inadequate to\n\nsupport the drastic act of throwing out a jury’s verdict. Further, it is\n\nquestionable at best that BCH even violated the limine orders, as the trial\n\ncourt’s erratic rulings were inconsistent and outside the orders’ parameters.\n\nBut even assuming BCH violated the court’s limine orders, the violations\n\nwere curable, and Wohlrabe failed to preserve error by properly objecting,\n\nrequesting an instruction to disregard, and seeking a mistrial.\n\n      As to the jury arguments made by BCH, they similarly cannot serve as\n\na proper basis for a new trial because they were neither improper nor\n\nincurable. In contrast, BCH’s arguments were based on inferences properly\n\ndrawn from the evidence. Moreover, the arguments were not sufficiently\n\noutrageous to constitute incurable error. Wohlrabe failed to object to all but\n\none of these arguments, and did not request an instruction to disgreard or\n\nmove for mistrial as to any of them. Thus, error was not preserved as to any\n\nof BCH’s jury arguments.\n\n\n                                     25\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\f      Finally, the evidence was factually sufficient to support the jury’s\n\nverdict. Specifically, BCH presented factually sufficient evidence that the\n\nfees sought by Wohlrabe were unreasonable. BCH did so by cross-\n\nexamining Wohlrabe’s expert on attorney’s fees. It also did so by presenting\n\ntestimony from its own expert on attorney’s fees, from which two methods\n\nto calculate a floor on attorney’s fees were presented to the jury. From this\n\nevidence, the jury could (1) award Wohlrabe the fees sought; (2) reduce\n\nthese fees sought; (3) award one of the “floor” amounts; or (4) award fees in\n\nbetween the ceiling and the floor. The jury chose option four, and acted\n\nwithin its purview in doing so.\n\n      The trial court clearly abused its discretion in granting a new trial\n\nbecause the court failed to articulate any legally valid ground supporting a\n\ngrant of new trial. Accordingly, this Court should reverse the trial court’s\n\norder and reinstate the jury’s verdict.\n\n\n\n\n                                      26\n\n                                      TAB 1\n\f                                ARGUMENT\n\nI.

Mandamus may issue to reverse a court’s order\n            granting a new trial on unstated or legally invalid\n            grounds.\n\n      Trial courts used to have broad discretion to grant new trials for\n\nvirtually any or no stated reason. Stated another way, the trial court was not\n\nrequired to state a reason for granting new trial, much less a legally sound\n\nreason.\n\n      This broad discretion, however, was restricted by the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt in 2009.

The trial court’s order granting a new trial on\n            attorney’s fees has left BCH without an adequate\n            remedy on appeal.\n\n      The two requisites for obtaining mandamus relief for an improper\n\ngrant of new trial are the same as for any mandamus: (1) the trial court\n\nclearly abused its discretion and (2) there is no adequate remedy by appeal.\n\nIn re Reece, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895325\"><a href=\"/opinion/895325/in-re-reece/\"><span class=\"volume\">341</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">360</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 364 (Tex. 2011). A trial court clearly abuses its\n\ndiscretion when its decision is so arbitrary and unreasonable as to amount\n\nto a clear and prejudicial error of law, or if it fails to analyze or apply the\n\nlaw correctly. See In re Cerberus Capital Mgmt. L.P., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894661\"><a href=\"/opinion/894661/in-re-cerberus-capital-management-lp/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">379</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 382\n\n(Tex. 2005). Here, the trial court clearly abused its discretion when it\n\ngranted Wohlrabe’s Motion for New Trial on legally invalid grounds.\n\n      As to the second element, the long-established rule in Texas—that an\n\norder granting a motion for new trial generally is not subject to appellate\n\nreview—ended with Columbia and Toyota. See Columbia, 290 S.W.3d at\n\n209 (reasoning that absent mandamus review, Columbia would have no\n\nappellate review of the order granting new trial). Now, a litigant lacks an\n\nadequate remedy by appeal when the order granting new trial either\n\n\n\n\n                                      29\n\n                                      TAB 1\n\f(1) does not state the reasons or (2) states legally or factually invalid\n\nreasons. Id.\n\n      The latter basis leaves BCH with no adequate remedy by appeal here.\n\nAlso, affording Wohlrabe a new trial on attorney’s fees would provide her\n\ntwo bites at the apple, on grounds that were legally invalid.\n\nII.   Granting new trial for BCH’s purportedly improper\n      questions and argument is a legally invalid ground.\n\n      In its order granting new trial, the trial court documented a laundry\n\nlist of supposed instances in which BCH violated the court’s supplemental\n\nlimine order and made improper jury arguments. For example, the court\n\nsaid BCH violated the trial court’s limine order by presenting testimony and\n\nargument regarding (1) the number of hours BCH’s expert believed would\n\nhave been reasonable and (2) BCH’s assertions that $150,000.00 was a\n\nreasonable attorney’s fee.\n\n      The court further noted that certain parts of BCH’s jury argument\n\ncaused incurable harm, including argument that: (1) the case was about a\n\n“lawyer money grab”; (2) attacked the creation of an association by some\n\nproperty owners; (3) criticized counsel for the Association’s use of block\n\nbilling as preventing scrutiny of the billing entries; and (4) counsel for the\n\nAssociation’s failure to segregate entries related to a cause of action that\n\nwas dropped (and for which attorney’s fees were not recoverable).\n\n                                      30\n\n                                      TAB 1\n\f      Each of these grounds is legally invalid and cannot support the proper\n\ngrant of new trial for three reasons. First, BCH did not violate the limine\n\norder. Second, most of the purportedly improper jury arguments were not\n\nobjected to and were not incurable. Third, for those jury arguments that\n\nwere objected to, no mistrial was sought, and these arguments were not\n\nincurable.\n\n      A.     To preserve error for evidence or argument, a party\n             must timely object, obtain a ruling, and request an\n             instruction to disregard, unless it is incurable.\n\n      When improper testimony or argument reaches the jury, the party\n\nopposing the evidence or argument generally must object and obtain a\n\nruling.

The exception is when an improper line of questions\n\nor argument is incurable. The instances of Texas courts finding questions or\n\nargument incurable are rare. What does not suffice as incurable is merely\n\nviolating a limine order or a rule of evidence in introducing evidence or\n\nmaking an argument. What might suffice as incurable is argument violating\n\nall bounds of decency.

Moreover, Wohlrabe did not at any time move for a mistrial.\n\nConsequently, Wohlrabe failed to preserve error as to any of the allegedly\n\n\n                                     32\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\fimproper testimony or jury argument, unless the arguments were\n\nincurable.

But when a curative instruction is neither requested nor\n\nissued, a curable violation is waived and cannot serve as a proper basis for\n\ngranting a new trial. Wyatt Field Serv. Co., 454 S.W.3d at 161.\n\n      The trial court below issued three supplemental limine orders. The\n\nfirst order instructs the parties not to argue any law prohibiting block\n\nbilling:\n\n      [a]ny testimony, evidence, or argument that any law requires a\n      party seeking to recover attorney fee statements which utilize\n      task billing, i.e., which reflect the amount of time spent on each\n      task performed by the attorney, paralegal, legal assistant, or any\n      law that prohibits block billing.\n\n(MR Tab N at 13.)\n\n      The second and third orders limit the matters over which BCH’s\n\nexpert was permitted to testify:\n\n      [h]e can opine that he thinks that the amount that was disclosed\n      is improper. . . . [H]e can also opine as to why he thinks that,\n      but he cannot opine as to what he thinks an appropriate\n      number would have been. . . . He can testify to hours, but\n      not amounts.\n\n(MR Tab N at 51, 53) (emphasis added.)\n\n      In its order granting new trial, the court stated that BCH made\n\narguments and elicited testimony violating all three of these supplemental\n\nlimine orders. (MR Tab L at 2; Apx. 1 at 2.) It is questionable at best that\n\nBCH violated these limine orders. But either way, Wohlrabe waived error\n\n\n                                     34\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\fby failing to ask for a curative instruction. Nor did Wohlrabe ever move for\n\na mistrial at any time during the trial. Even when taken cumulatively, none\n\nof the alleged violations constitute incurable error; thus, there is no basis\n\nfor granting a new trial.\n\n            1.     Purported violations of the limine order on the\n                   law of block billing did not justify a new trial.\n\n      BCH did not violate the court’s supplemental limine order regarding\n\nblock billing. Specifically, the supplemental order precluded BCH from\n\nascertaining or arguing “that any law requires” the use of task billing or\n\nprohibits block billing. (MR Tab N at 13.) After the court’s issuance of this\n\norder, however, the record is bereft of testimony or argument regarding any\n\nsuch matter.\n\n      In this regard, the following excerpts of the record comprise the\n\nentirety of the block billing testimony and argument that occurred after the\n\nissuance of the court’s supplemental order. During the direct examination\n\nof BCH’s expert witness, there were three different occasions where counsel\n\nfor Wohlrabe objected to testimony regarding the impact of block billing:\n\n      Q:    (By Mr. Yanof) If you do not itemize each amount and\n      instead simply block bill amounts, does that make it –– well,\n      what does that do to your bill?\n\n      Mr. Farlow:    Objection, Your Honor. This is – –\n\n      The Court:    Sustained.\n\n                                     35\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\f(MR Tab N at 63.)\n\n                                      ***\n     Q: So you bill each single thing you do, and then put the actual\n     time spent next to it?\n\n     A:   Yes, sir.\n\n     Mr. Farlow:       Objection, Your Honor, relevance.\n\n     The Court:       Sustained.\n\n(MR Tab N at 65–66.)\n\n                                      ***\n     Q:      (By Mr. Yanof)        In looking through these bills, Mr.\n     Kitchens, can you figure out whether any of the research done\n     was devoted to the tortious interference claim, a claim on which\n     plaintiffs could not recover attorneys’ fees?\n\n     A:     For the most part, no. If you look at Exhibit 4, the first\n     page, there’s four entries. And on the next page there’s another\n     entry for legal fee. And ––\n\n     Q:   This is the first page of Exhibit 4 – –\n\n     A:   Yes, sir.\n\n     Q:   – – just for reference.\n\n     A: And that doesn’t tell me one way or the other what they’re\n     researching, whether it would be recoverable or not recoverable.\n\n     Mr. Farlow:       Objection, Your Honor. He’s asking the question\n     that – –\n\n     The Court:       Sustained.\n\n\n                                      36\n\n\n                                    TAB 1\n\f(MR Tab N at 84–85.)\n\n      That these objections were sustained shows the favoritism the trial\n\ncourt showed to the favored party, Wohlrabe. For two of the objections,\n\ncounsel did not even state the basis for the objection. For all of them, these\n\nwere proper questions.\n\n      But more to the point, these questions did not ask the witness to\n\ncomment on the law of task or block billing. Rather, they properly asked\n\nabout the limitations that block billing places on scrutinizing bills to\n\ndetermine reasonable attorney’s fees attributable to a recoverable claim.\n\n      A similar sequence played out in closing arguments. That is,\n\nWohlrabe objected to jury argument addressing the implications of block or\n\ntask billing:\n\n      They bill – – if we can look at the bill, the way they did it, they\n      chose to do this. You heard Mr. Elrod testify he could have done\n      it either way. He could have – – he could have billed – –\n\n      Mr. Farlow:      You Honor, objection. I’m sorry. This is going\n      into the – –\n\n      The Court:     Be careful, Mr. Culpepper.\n\n      Mr. Culpepper:      All I’m – – my only statement is if you – –\n      from these bills, you can’t determine how much time they spent.\n      You heard Mr. Kitchens say he sends his client itemized bills.\n      He can’t determine it. You can’t – – the other expert can’t\n      segregate.\n\n      Mr. Farlow:     Objection.\n\n                                      37\n\n                                      TAB 1\n\f      The Court:    Sustained.\n\n(MR Tab N at 188–89.)\n\n      Again, Wohlrabe’s counsel failed to state the basis for his objection.\n\nMore importantly, this argument had nothing to do with “the law” of block\n\nor task billing. Instead, it simply makes the point that block billing in this\n\nmanner makes it difficult to segregate recoverable fees from non-\n\nrecoverable fees and to determine whether each task in a block-billed entry\n\nwas reasonable. Because BCH did not violate the supplemental orders in\n\nlimine, “violation” of the court’s limine order regarding block billing cannot\n\nserve as a proper basis for a grant of new trial.\n\n      Yet, even if BCH violated the court’s order, the violations were neither\n\npreserved nor incurable error. In its order granting new trial, the trial court\n\nstated that the testimony and argument made regarding block billing\n\nconstituted incurable error. This means that, assuming BCH violated the\n\nlimine order, the violations were so severe that an instruction to disregard\n\nwould not have cured the violation’s prejudicial effect. The testimony and\n\nargument outlined above, however, are proper, and certainly not so extreme\n\nor shocking that an instruction to disregard would not have been effective.\n\nThus, any violation of the order regarding block billing was curable and\n\n\n\n                                      38\n\n\n                                       TAB 1\n\fmust have been properly preserved in order to serve as a legitimate basis for\n\na grant of new trial.\n\n      Wohlrabe did not preserve error with regard to BCH’s alleged\n\nviolations of the court’s supplemental order because no mistrial was sought.\n\nAt no time during the trial—with all of the alleged indiscretions committed\n\nby BCH—did Wohlrabe move for a mistrial. In fact, the only time an\n\ninstruction was requested was before day two of trial began, and before the\n\ntestimony and argument at issue were presented. Accordingly, this stated\n\nbasis in the order granting new trial is not substantively valid or correct and\n\ncannot support properly granting a new trial.\n\n            2.    Eliciting testimony regarding the\n                  unreasonableness of the hours billed did not\n                  justify a new trial.\n\n      There were multiple instances in this case where BCH attempted to\n\nput on testimony that the hours billed by Wohlrabe attorneys were\n\nunreasonable. While this was not in violation of the limine order on this\n\nmatter—which precluded testimony as to a dollar amount that the expert\n\nthought would be appropriate (MR Tab N at 51, 53)—the court stated in its\n\norder granting new trial that BCH had violated the order many times. The\n\nfollowing excerpts from the record contain the entirety of the expert’s\n\ntestimony in question:\n\n\n                                     39\n\n                                      TAB 1\n\f     Q: But in your experience as a 37-year lawyer handling HOA\n     cases, do you have an opinion about whether the total amount\n     of hours expended by the law firm representing the plaintiff’s\n     was reasonable?\n\n     A:   I have an opinion.\n\n     Q:   What is that opinion?\n\n     A:   It’s unreasonable.\n\n     Q: In your experience as a 37-year lawyer specializing in HOA\n     cases, how many hours do you believe are reasonable in\n     prosecuting a deed restriction case, the claim on which\n     attorney’s fees are recoverable?\n\n     Mr. Farlow:     Objection, Your Honor. That’s the exact – –\n\n     The Court:     Sustained.\n\n(MR Tab N at 89.)\n\n                                    ***\n\n     Q: (By Mr. Yanof) You heard the testimony yesterday that the\n     total amount of hours in this case by plaintiffs’ counsel’s firm,\n     including plaintiff herself, is most – – who has more hours than\n     anybody else us 2,560.50 hours. Do you recall that?\n\n     A:   That’s what their exhibit shows?\n\n     Q:    Have you ever seen that many hours in a deed restriction\n     case?\n\n     Mr. Farlow:     Objection, Your Honor.\n\n     The Court:     Sustained.\n\n(MR Tab N at 97.)\n\n\n                                    40\n\n                                  TAB 1\n\f      For starters, yet again Wohlrabe’s counsel did not state a basis for the\n\nobjection. No matter, the trial court again sustained the objections.\n\n      More fundamentally, in asking the number of hours instead of the\n\ndollar amounts, BCH carefully complied with the trial court’s supplemental\n\nlimine orders (misguided as they were). (MR Tab N at 51, 53.) The trial\n\ncourt continually hamstrung BCH anyway, sustaining objections that did\n\nnot violate the order and without a stated basis. Simply put, if the favored\n\nparty asked for it, the favored party got it.\n\n      Be that as it may, at no point in these exchanges between BCH’s\n\ncounsel and its expert witness did counsel request, or the witness suggest, a\n\nspecific dollar amount that would have been reasonable (as prohibited by\n\nthe limine order). Furthermore, this testimony was directly within the\n\nparameters of the trial court’s instruction that the witness may “testify as to\n\nhours, but not amounts.” (MR Tab N at 51, 53.) Therefore, because there\n\nwas no violation in the first place, a purported violation of this limine order\n\ncannot serve as the basis for a proper grant of a new trial.\n\n      But even if this supplemental limine order was violated, the error was\n\ncurable and not properly preserved. Any error arising from these alleged\n\nviolations was curable because an instruction most assuredly would have\n\neliminated any prejudice created by the purportedly improper questions.\n\n\n                                       41\n\n                                       TAB 1\n\fThis is due in large part to the fact that the witness was not permitted to\n\nprovide an answer to these questions, let alone provide a dollar amount\n\nthat he deemed reasonable for this case. The alleged violations thus did not\n\nconstitute incurable error.\n\n      Because any alleged error related to this particular limine order was\n\ncurable, Wohlrabe’s counsel was required to preserve error by pursuing an\n\nadverse ruling or if sustained, request an instruction. Wohlrabe failed to do\n\nso. Consequently, any error was waived and this ground, as outlined in the\n\ntrial court’s order, cannot support the trial court’s grant of a new trial.\n\n            3.    Arguing a floor on attorney’s fees of $150,000 in\n                  closing argument did not justify a new trial.\n\n      In its order granting new trial, the court stated that BCH violated its\n\npretrial rulings when it argued to the jury that $150,000 as a floor would be\n\na reasonable attorney’s fee to award. (MR Tab L at 2; Apx. 1 at 2.) The basis\n\nfor this jury argument was two-fold.\n\n      First, BCH’s expert, an experienced deed restriction lawyer, opined\n\non the reasonable hours that should be expended in a deed restriction\n\ncase—even a contentious case. (MR Tab N at 98–104.) These hours paled in\n\ncomparison to those expended by Wohlrabe’s law firm, that was\n\ninexperienced in handling deed restriction cases. This range of hours, using\n\nthe hourly rate of Wohlrabe’s law firm, totaled approximately $150,000\n\n                                       42\n\n                                       TAB 1\n\f($170,500 for the high end of the range, and approximately $150,000 or\n\nless for the lower end of the range).\n\n      Second, BCH’s expert testified that Wohlrabe’s law firm should have\n\nmoved the case to conclusion earlier. In direct examination of BCH’s\n\nexpert, he went through the court’s docket and how Wohlrabe could have\n\nreasonably obtained a summary judgment on the merits about a year\n\nearlier, thereby avoiding exorbitant fees incurred by delaying. (MR Tab N at\n\n79-80.) By eliminating the dragged-out litigation, the fees that could have\n\nbeen avoided would reduce the fees recoverable to a little higher floor—to\n\n$218,000.\n\n      To be clear, the jury did not go as low as these floors and award\n\n$150,000-$218,000. But it could have. Conversely, the jury did not award\n\nthe fees Wohlrabe asked the jury to award: $579,954.45. Instead, the jury\n\nawarded $290,000. Less than the ceiling, more than the floor. The jury was\n\nwithin its discretion in doing so. More fundamentally, BCH’s arguing for\n\nthe floor of somewhere in the $150,000 range was proper given the\n\nevidence. No expert or document had to explicitly say the number\n\n$150,000 to properly argue it was a reasonable amount, given the\n\ntestimony cited above. Rather, it was a reasonable inference drawn from\n\n\n\n\n                                        43\n\n                                        TAB 1\n\fthe testimony presented. Further, the supplemental limine order on\n\namounts of fees addresses expert testimony, not jury argument.\n\n      But even assuming arguendo that this argument was improper and\n\nviolated the trial court’s limine orders, it was not properly preserved.\n\nAdmittedly, Wohlrabe’s counsel did object to this jury argument.\n\nPredictably, the trial court sustained the objection for the favored party.\n\n      Notwithstanding, to be a proper basis for a new trial, Wohlrabe had to\n\nrequest a curative instruction or move for a mistrial.

Id. This Court further held that in\n\nany event, any harm caused by the argument could have been cured by an\n\nobjection and instruction by the trial court. Id.\n\n       Here, the sole issue at trial was how much Wohlrabe should recover\n\nin reasonable attorney’s fees. Testimony was presented that Wohlrabe\n\nfailed to segregate fees of the underlying declaratory judgment action from\n\nthe related tort action. (MR Tab N at 80–82.) There was also testimony that\n\nWohlrabe’s delay in filing a motion for summary judgment caused fees to\n\nbe driven up. (MR Tab N at 76–80.) Finally, there was testimony elicited as\n\nto the suspect nature of the contingency fee arrangement between\n\nWohlrabe and her counsel—specifically that such an arrangement in a case\n\nwith no actual damages creates an incentive to drive up fees because they\n\nare the only means of recovery for Wohlrabe’s law firm. (MR Tab N at 105–\n\n07.)\n\n\n\n\n                                      47\n\n                                      TAB 1\n\f      As a result, BCH argued in closing argument that seeking\n\napproximately $580,000 in fees constituted a “lawyer money grab.” (MR\n\nTab N at 186.) Given the evidence, this was not improper jury argument.\n\nRather, it was simply argument that admittedly was argumentative. See\n\nClark, 217 S.W.3d at 510 (“”[S]uch hyperbole for emphasis is an accepted\n\ntechnique of oral advocacy and is part of our legal heritage and tradition.”).\n\n      But even if it was improper argument, Wohlrabe failed to object. (See\n\nMR Tab N at 186–87.) Just as this Court noted in Bishop Abbey Homes,\n\n“[a]ny error or harm occurred from counsel’s use of hyperbole in his\n\ndiscussion could have been cured by an objection and instruction from the\n\ntrial court.” Hale, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">9167799</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *13.\n\n      Likewise, BCH’s jury argument was not improper, or at most, curable\n\nerror. Consequently, Wohlrabe was required to properly preserve the error\n\nby a timely objection and request for a curative instruction. Wohlrabe did\n\nneither. Accordingly, BCH’s jury argument that the case was about a\n\n“lawyer money grab” is a legally incorrect ground from which the trial court\n\ncould properly grant a new trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                      48\n\n                                      TAB 1\n\f           2.    BCH’s argument questioning the formation of the\n                 homeowner’s association was not improper, was\n                 not objected to by Wohlrabe, and was not\n                 incurable.\n\n     The trial court also found that BCH’s jury argument “attacking the\n\ncreation of an association” by Wohlrabe—the client and attorney at the\n\nclient’s law firm—was incurable jury argument warranting a new trial. (MR\n\nTab L at 3; Apx. 1 at 3.) The following is the only mention of Wohlrabe\n\ncreating the homeowner’s association during BCH’s closing argument:\n\n“They never needed the homeowner’s association. It wasn’t necessary. It\n\nwas created – – an entity to go sue them and didn’t need [Wohlrabe] to file\n\ntheir lawsuit.” (MR Tab N at 187.)\n\n     This argument emphasized that the client was the attorney and drove\n\nhome the point that the attorney’s fees were unreasonably escalated. There\n\nis nothing improper about this (brief) argument.\n\n     Further, the argument was neither objected to by Wohlrabe nor\n\nincurable. That is, the argument was not so severe or outrageous that it\n\ncould have caused the jury to “agree to a verdict contrary to that to which\n\nhe would have agreed but for such argument.” Phillips v. Bramlett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895094\"><a href=\"/opinion/895094/phillips-v-bramlett/\"><span class=\"volume\">288</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">876</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 883 (Tex. 2009). Therefore, any prejudice incurred by\n\nWohlrabe—due to this brief, three-sentence-long argument—was curable by\n\nan objection and instruction from the trial court to disregard. Because\n\n                                     49\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\fWohlrabe did not object or request such an instruction, much less move for\n\na mistrial, error was not preserved. And if error was not preserved, it could\n\nnot properly serve as a ground for new trial. The trial court clearly abused\n\nits discretion in granting a new trial on this ground.\n\n            3.    BCH’s argument regarding the suspect nature of\n                  the fee arrangement was not improper, was not\n                  objected to by Wohlrabe, and was not incurable.\n\n      The trial court’s order further noted that a new trial was appropriate\n\nbecause BCH made arguments attacking the validity of Wohlrabe’s\n\ncontingency fee arrangement with its counsel. The trial court thus deemed\n\nthe following argument improper and incurable:\n\n            And you heard from Mr. Elrod. He told you on the stand\n      the contingency fee agreements are typically used because\n      somebody can’t pay. Ms. Elrod – – excuse me. Ms. Wohlrabe,\n      according to Mr. Elrod, charges $300 an hour. So I think that\n      she could pay that if she wanted to. Instead, they enter into a\n      contingency fee agreement where all – – the only thing they’re\n      going to collect is attorneys’ fees.\n            So what are they going to do? If it settles day one, they get\n      zero, nothing, nada. The only recovery is the longer the thing\n      goes on and the bigger the attorneys’ fees they jet up, the bigger\n      the award potentially. That’s all there is. That’s all they’re\n      fighting about, attorneys’ fees.\n\n(MR Tab N at 187.)\n\n                                    ***\n            So the agreement is we discussed that contingency fee\n      agreement. Ms. Wohlrabe is never going to have to pay any fees.\n      The homeowners’ association is never going to have to pay any\n      fees. And, again, the only way they recover any fees is if there\n\n                                      50\n\n                                      TAB 1\n\f     are fees to recover. So without creating fees, you’ve got no\n     recovery.\n           And, in fact, as both Mr. Elrod and Mr. Kitchens testified,\n     in a contingency fee agreement, they typically share the\n     recovery. They’re not sharing any recovery with Ms. Wohlrabe\n     or the homeowners’ association with these fees.\n           Now, we talked about budget. Mr. Elrod said, well, by the\n     nature of a contingency fee agreement, he was going to have to\n     be efficient. That was his testimony. I would agree with him in a\n     normal contingency fee agreement where there are actual\n     damages that you’re trying to recover and you’re going to share\n     in those damages because the quicker you end it, the sooner you\n     get the recovery. And as a lawyer, you don’t have to put in as\n     much time in because the less time you put in, the bigger your\n     recovery.\n           Under this contingency fee agreement, the more time he\n     puts in, the more potential recovery for him. It’s the opposite of\n     a typical contingency fee agreement. This contingency fee\n     agreement incentivizes the lawyer’s to spend money, which is\n     the opposite of what Mr. Elrod told you.\n\n(MR Tab N at 189–90.)\n\n     In addition to the incestuous relationship between attorney and\n\nclient, this argument is premised on two undisputed and relevant facts:\n\nthere were no actual damages sought, yet Wohlrabe sought almost\n\n$580,000 in attorney’s fees from a contingency fee agreement. This\n\nrendered the fee agreement an unprecedented one—a contingency fee\n\nagreement where there is no shared recovery, and where recovery requires\n\nchurning up significant attorney’s fees. How is pointing this out to the jury\n\nimproper?\n\n\n\n                                     51\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\f        Also, this lengthy argument was not objected to by Wohlrabe. Thus, it\n\nis waived and cannot be the proper basis for a new trial, unless the\n\nargument was incurable. This argument certainly does not fit within the\n\ncategory of argument that is incurable.\n\n        Rather, this argument was proper, and in any event was neither\n\nobjected to nor incurable. Accordingly, it was legally incorrect for the trial\n\ncourt to grant a new trial on this ground.\n\n             4.      BCH’s argument regarding failure to segregate\n                     cannot serve as a proper basis for a new trial.\n\n        There was one other portion of BCH’s jury argument cited by the trial\n\ncourt in the order granting new trial. Specifically, BCH argued that\n\nWohlrabe failed to properly segregate recoverable fees from nonrecoverable\n\nfees:\n\n              And Mr. Elrod told you, well, I took out $25,000. If you\n        look at the fee statements, remember he had a cause of action,\n        one whole cause of action that he dropped, he couldn’t recover\n        attorney’s fees on. And he’s saying, but that was only $25,000.\n        If you look at the fee statements, you will see that they should\n        have segregated hundreds of thousands of dollars related to that\n        claim. They were going to – –\n\n        Mr. Farlow:    Objection, Your Honor.\n\n        The Court:    Sustained.\n\n(MR Tab N at 190–91.)\n\n\n\n                                      52\n\n                                      TAB 1\n\f      Again, that there was no stated basis for the objection did not stop the\n\ntrial court from sustaining the objection. Further, the jury heard evidence\n\nthat segregation of recoverable fees from non-recoverable fees was required\n\nand that these fees were not sufficiently segregated. (MR Tab N at 81.)\n\nTherefore, argument asserting that the fees were not properly segregated\n\nwas proper.\n\n      But even if this argument was improper, it was curable. Thus,\n\nWohlrabe was required to object and, if sustained, seek a curative\n\ninstruction or move for a mistrial. Otherwise, error is not preserved to later\n\nseek a new trial on this basis.\n\n      Wohlrabe did neither. Instead, Wohlrabe’s counsel merely objected,\n\nstating no basis for the objection, then sat down once the objection was\n\nsustained. Accordingly, any purported error as to this argument was\n\nwaived, and the trial court’s order granting new trial cannot be supported\n\non this ground.\n\n      D.    The purported indiscretions by BCH in questions and\n            argument cannot serve as the proper basis for a new\n            trial, individually or cumulatively.\n\n      Not a single stated basis for granting a new trial was legally\n\nsupportable. Nor did Wohlrabe properly preserve any ground by requesting\n\na curative instruction or seeking a mistrial. Because none of the evidence or\n\n\n                                     53\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\fargument was incurable, error was waived. More fundamentally, every\n\nsingle stated basis in the order granting new trial was proper examination\n\nor argument by BCH.\n\n         Yet Wohlrabe argues that individually and collectively, the stated\n\nbases suffice for granting a new trial. There is no legal basis in Texas\n\njurisprudence for granting a new trial based on cumulative error when each\n\nstated reason is not improper, much less preserved for later seeking a new\n\ntrial.\n\n         The stated bases for granting a new trial are not legally supportable,\n\nindividually or cumulatively. Therefore, the order granting new trial on\n\ngrounds of improper questioning and argument states legally invalid\n\nreasons for granting a new trial.\n\nIII. There was factually sufficient evidence to support the jury’s\n     award of attorney’s fees in the amount of $290,000.\n\n         The trial court seemed persuaded by three arguments from Wohlrabe\n\nregarding the purported factual insufficiency of the amount awarded by the\n\njury. First, no expert uttered the number $290,000. Second, the only\n\nspecific number stated by an expert was $579,954.45. Third, jury argument\n\nsuggesting a floor as low as $150,000 was not supported by the evidence.\n\nNone of these arguments is a proper basis for a new trial.\n\n\n\n                                       54\n\n                                       TAB 1\n\f      The determination of reasonable attorney’s fees is a fact question and\n\n“’the testimony of an interested witness, such as a party to the suit, though\n\nnot contradicted, does no more than raise a fact issue to be determined by\n\nthe jury.” Garcia v. Gomez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895255\"><a href=\"/opinion/895255/garcia-v-gomez/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">638</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 642 (Tex. 2010). There is an\n\nexception to this rule: “where the testimony of an interested witness is not\n\ncontradicted by any other witness, or attendant circumstances, and the\n\nsame is clear, direct and positive, and free from contradiction, inaccuracies,\n\nand circumstances tending to cast suspicion thereon, it is taken as true, as a\n\nmatter of law.” Ragsdale v.

Systems, Inc. v.\n\nHewlett Packard Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2539540\"><a href=\"/opinion/2539540/powell-elec-systems-v-hewlett-packard-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">113</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 128 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n\nno pet.).\n\n      A.    It is of no consequence that the amount $290,000 was\n            not uttered specifically by a witness.\n\n      In seeking a new trial, Wohlrabe argued that the “only evidence\n\nsubmitted in the case concerning the amount of reasonable fees for the\n\nservices of Plaintiffs’ attorneys through trial was the evidence and\n\n                                     55\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\ftestimony submitted by Plaintiffs.” (See MR Tab J at 3-4.) In reasoning\n\nfurther, the basis for this bold statement is simply that BCH’s expert did not\n\ntestify to a dollar amount.\n\n      But this is of no consequence. If this were the law, then attorney’s fees\n\ncould never be reduced solely on cross-examination of the expert testifying\n\nto attorney’s fees—unless she gratuitously reduced the amount herself. This\n\nis not the law. A party disputing attorney’s fees can put the reasonableness\n\nof certain fees at issue solely based on cross-examination of the expert\n\nseeking fees. See, e.g., Cullins v. Foster, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1560642\"><a href=\"/opinion/1560642/cullins-v-foster/\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">521</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 537-39 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, pet. denied) (rejecting that attorney’s\n\nfees were established as a matter of law where the only witness to testify on\n\nfees was cross-examined on segregation and other issues).\n\n      That is, of course, not what happened here, as BCH’s expert, Mr.\n\nKitchens, testified (1) what fees could have been avoided by seeking\n\nsummary judgment sooner and (2) what the fees would have been in a\n\nusual and customary case based on his experience. Notwithstanding, cross-\n\nexamination of Wohlrabe’s expert, Mr. Elrod, alone would have allowed\n\nreducing the fees, particularly since the jury is the sole judge of the\n\ncredibility of witnesses. See Cullins, 171 S.W.3d at 537-39.\n\n\n\n\n                                      56\n\n                                      TAB 1\n\f      Wohlrabe further argued in the trial court that because there is not\n\nsome reasoning that would support the actual dollar amount awarded by\n\nthe jury, it is not supported. But the case law belies this argument. See, e.g.,\n\nGarcia v. Gomez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895255\"><a href=\"/opinion/895255/garcia-v-gomez/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">638</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 641-42 (Tex. 2010); Powell, 356 S.W.3d\n\nat 127-29.\n\n      A jury can award within a range of fees. This is precisely what the jury\n\ndid here, by either calculation of the suggested floor. Also, if there is\n\nevidence from which the fees sought could be undercut, including solely\n\nfrom cross-examination of the attorney seeking fees, the jury may do so.\n\nSee Powell, 356 S.W.3d at 127-29; Cullins, 171 S.W.3d at 537-39. Such\n\nevidence was abundant here.\n\n      Simply put, the law does not require an amount be specifically uttered\n\nto the jury for the jury to award that amount in attorney’s fees.\n\n      B.     The attorney’s fees sought by Wohlrabe were\n             contradicted.\n\n      That the fees were contradicted is most obviously shown by the\n\ntestimony of Mr. Kitchens, BCH’s expert. But the fees were also\n\ncontradicted by cross-examination of BCH’s expert.\n\n      For example, the jury heard abundant evidence from which it could\n\nhave (and apparently did) view with skepticism Wohlrabe’s exorbitant\n\nclaim for attorney’s fees. This included:\n\n                                      57\n\n                                      TAB 1\n\f        • The initial fee agreement noted that the clients (Wohlrabe and\n          her Association) were being provided services from Wohlrabe\n          pro bono, then suddenly the matter was converted to seek fees\n          (MR Tab N at 71);\n\n        • The fee agreement to which it was converted, in an HOA deed\n          restriction case with no actual damages, was a contingency fee\n          case—something unheard of in an HOA deed restriction case\n          (MR Tab N at 67-68);\n\n        • The redactions and failure to describe for the jury what research\n          was performed specifically in the fee statements did not allow\n          the jury to ascertain what portion of the fees should have been\n          segregated as between recoverable and non-recoverable claims\n          (MR Tab N at 122–23; MR Tab N at 84–88);\n\n        • The redactions and failure to describe for the jury what research\n          was performed specifically in the fee statements did not allow\n          the jury to determine the reasonableness of such entries and\n          fees (Id.); and\n\n        • The client (Wohlrabe and the Association—of which she is the\n          director and set up solely for this litigation) is the attorney, and\n          attorney is the client.\n\n     This evidence undercut Wohlrabe’s claims for the exorbitant amount\n\nof attorney’s fees sought. When combined with credibility issues for\n\nWohlrabe’s attorney’s fees’ expert, there is factually sufficient evidence\n\nsupporting the lower amount awarded by the jury.\n\n     The trial court instructed the jury in its charge that it was “the sole\n\njudges of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given their\n\ntestimony.” (MR Tab I at 1.) Apparently, the jury took this to heart in\n\n\n\n                                     58\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\fawarding an amount lower than what Mr. Elrod told them he wanted and\n\ndeserved.\n\n     More specifically, Mr. Elrod presented with credibility issues. Mind\n\nyou, Mr. Elrod is a fine lawyer who has handled some very significant cases\n\nof very significant value. He certainly testified extensively about his wins\n\nand “notches on his belt.”\n\n     For the jury, though, the problem may have been that in his 38 years\n\nof practicing law, this was only his second HOA case. (MR Tab M at 103.)\n\nFor all the experience Mr. Elrod has, he readily admitted that he has rarely\n\nhandled HOA cases (one other in his career), and does not specialize in this\n\narea. (MR Tab M at 103.)\n\n     From this testimony, it is not a stretch for the jury to conclude his\n\nlack of experience in these types of cases unnecessarily and unreasonably\n\ndrove up the fees. In fact, BCH argued this to the jury in closing arguments.\n\n(MR Tab N at 191.) When combined with the testimony of BCH’s expert\n\nTravis Kitchens—about how a typical case should be handled—this is likely\n\nanother reason the jury reduced the award.\n\n     Specifically, Mr. Kitchens testified on multiple occasions that the fees\n\nsought by Wohlrabe were unreasonable. He also specified the facts and\n\nevidence on which this was based.\n\n\n                                     59\n\n                                     TAB 1\n\f      For starters, Wohlrabe waited well over a year after obtaining a\n\ntemporary injunction to seek a permanent injunction (by summary\n\njudgment). (MR Tab N at 76-80.) Mr. Kitchens testified that this delay\n\nresulted in unnecessary fees from February 2014 (45 days after the\n\ntemporary injunction was granted on December 13, 2013) to February 2015\n\n(when the first summary judgment and permanent injunction was granted).\n\n(Id.) The fees in that time period—taken straight from Wohlrabe’s exhibit\n\nsummarizing the fees by month—total $361,836.50. (See MR Tab N at 79;\n\nMR Tab O at 1–3.) When this amount is subtracted from the amount sought\n\nby Plaintiffs, the modified total is $218,117.95.\n\n      This modified amount of $218,117.95 served as one floor for the\n\naward of attorney’s fees. And under this calculation—firmly supported by\n\nthe evidence—the range of recoverable attorney’s fees (assuming proper\n\nsegregation) is $218,117.95-$579,954.45. The jury’s award of $290,000 is\n\nsquarely within this range.\n\n      But there was another alternative measure from which the jury could\n\nhave reduced fees. Mr. Kitchens testified that there is a typical and\n\nreasonable manner in which to handle an HOA deed restriction case. (MR\n\nTab N at 99-104.) Mr. Kitchens testified that the law is not complex in these\n\ncases. (MR Tab N at 84.)\n\n\n                                      60\n\n                                      TAB 1\n\f      He then explained, from his experience, the usual and customary\n\nmanner in which such cases are handled. (MR Tab N at 99-104.) He\n\ndetailed—task by task—the number of hours it should take to work up such\n\na case. (Id.) If the high end of his range for handling such a case is\n\ncalculated, it totals 620 hours. (Id.) Using Mr. Farlow (lead counsel) and\n\nMs. Wohlrabe’s hourly rate of $275, this totals $170,500. If the lower end of\n\nthe range was used, the figure would drop further—to approximately\n\n$150,000. This amount of $150,000-$170,500 provides a second floor to\n\nwhich the jury could have reduced fees. The jury awarded approximately\n\n$120,000-$140,000 more than this floor in awarding $290,000.\n\n      Wohlrabe does not like the jury award. But there is factually sufficient\n\nevidence to support an award of $290,000.\n\n      Given the battle of experts, cross-examination of Wohlrabe’s expert,\n\nand other evidence regarding the exorbitant fees and incestuous\n\nrelationship between Wohlrabe as client and attorney/her law firm, the jury\n\naward is not so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to\n\nbe clearly wrong and unjust.

Therefore, granting a new trial\n\nbased on the jury’s award of $290,000 in attorney’s fees is legally invalid.\n\n\n\n\n                                      61\n\n                                      TAB 1\n\f                               CONCLUSION\n\n      In virtually every manner, the trial court played favorites and showed\n\npreference for one side, all the while ignoring established legal principles.\n\nThis is particularly true for the jury trial on attorney’s fees. In doing so, the\n\ntrial court exacted on BCH unequal justice above the law.\n\n      The trial court severely impeded BCH’s ability to examine witnesses,\n\nincluding sustaining objection after objection without Wohlrabe even\n\nstating a basis. The court also found violations of limine orders which did\n\nnot even implicate the orders, much less were improper. Finally, the court\n\ndisallowed closing argument that was proper, and certainly not incurable\n\nsuch that Wohlrabe could fail to object, request a curative instruction, or\n\nseek a mistrial and still preserve error to later seek a new trial.\n\n      Notwithstanding, the jury heard the evidence/arguments and\n\nrendered a verdict on attorney’s fees. There was factually sufficient\n\nevidence to support the verdict.\n\n      Yet the trial court—again administering unequal justice above the\n\nlaw—granted a new trial by an order listing trumped up charges of\n\nindiscretions by BCH. None of these is a proper basis for a new trial, either\n\nbecause the questions or arguments were not improper, or the error was\n\n\n\n\n                                       62\n\n                                       TAB 1\n\fnot preserved (including because the questions and arguments were not\n\nincurable).\n\n      One could ask, what is the harm in conducting a new trial on\n\nattorney’s fees? After all, it would be a short trial on attorney’s fees, then a\n\njudgment entered from which the parties could appeal. The simple answer\n\nis a new trial is not proper. There is no legal basis for the trial court\n\ngranting a new trial.\n\n      But beyond a second trial, what happens next? What if the second\n\njury awards $350,000 in attorney’s fees? Surely, Wohlrabe will seek a third\n\ntrial, and the trial court will undoubtedly grant it. What about if the jury\n\nawards $400,000 at the third trial? Wohlrabe will then seek a fourth trial,\n\nand the trial court will undoubtedly grant it. There are only two ends to to\n\nthis cycle: Wohlrabe finds a jury that is willing to simply rubber-stamp\n\nattorney’s fees of $579,954.45 (or more for each re-trial), or this Court puts\n\nan end to it here.\n\n      This Court should grant mandamus to correct the clear abuses of\n\ndiscretion by the trial court. Specifically, the Court should reverse the order\n\ngranting new trial and render judgment on the jury verdict (or order the\n\ntrial court to do so).\n\n\n\n\n                                      63\n\n                                      TAB 1\n\f                            PRAYER\n\nRelators pray that this Fifth District Court of Appeals:\n\n(1)   grant mandamus relief by finding that the trial court clearly\n      abused its discretion, and has left Relators without an adequate\n      remedy on appeal, in granting Plaintiffs’ motion for new trial;\n\n(2)   reverse the trial court’s Order Granting New Trial and either\n      enter judgment on the jury verdict or order the trial court to do\n      so; and\n\n(3)   award such other relief to which Relator may be entitled.\n\n                              Respectfully submitted,\n\n                              THOMPSON, COE, COUSINS & IRONS,\n                              L.L.P.\n\n\n                              By: /s/ Michael A.

Due to Defendant BCH Development, LLC's failure to make sufficient pre-trial\n\nexpert disclosures as required under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court made various\n\npre-trial rulings excluding and limiting certain expert evidence and testimony, as well as any\n\nreference to such evidence and testimony.            Specifically, the Court prohibited Defendant's\n\nattorney-fee expert from presenting (i) evidence concerning any specific amount of attorney's\n\nfees which Defendant's attorney-fee expert intended to testify was a reasonable amount of fees\n\nfor the services of Plaintiffs' attorneys in this matter, (ii) evidence concerning any specific\n\nnumber of hours which Defendant's attorney fee expert intended to testify was a reasonable\n\nnumber of hours for Plaintiffs' attorneys to have expended in representing the Plaintiffs in this\n\nmatter, (iii) evidence concerning the reasonable fees that are charged in Dallas County, Texas,\n\n(iv) evidence concerning any specific dollar amount of attorney's fees, or any specific number of\n\nattorney hours, which should have been segregated from the fees requested by Plaintiffs, and (v)\n\nevidence concerning any percentage to apply to Plaintiffs' attorney fee evidence in order to\n\narrive at a reasonable attorney's fee in the case.\n\n        2.     Despite and in contravention of the Court's rulings, Defendant attempted to place\n\nsuch excluded matters before the jury both through the testimony o f Defendant's expert witness\n\nand through argument to the jury, including (i) testimony concerning the number of hours\n\nDefendant's expert believed would be reasonable for prosecution of a deed restriction case like\n\nthis one, and (ii) jury argument that $150,000 was a reasonable attorney's fee through trial and\n\ncould be calculated by subtracting a certain amount of fees from the $579,954.45 fees sought by\n\nPlaintiffs.\n\n\nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL\n                                                                                              Page 2\n\n\n\n\n                                                     TAB 1\n\n\n                                                     TAB 1\n\f       3.      Defendant made several attempts to present testimony and argument to the jury\n\nthat Plaintiffs' attorneys' use of \"block billing\" in their attorney fee statements was somehow\n\nimproper or impermissible under the law and that as a result Plaintiffs should not recover some\n\nportion of their attorney's fees.    Despite the Court having granted Plaintiffs' request for a\n\nsupplemental limine order excluding any testimony, evidence or argument that any law requires\n\na party seeking to recover attorney's fees to prepare attorney fee statements which utilize \"task\n\nbilling,\" or that any law prohibits \"block billing\" (and the Court granting Plaintiffs' request for a\n\ncurative instruction to the jury,) Defendant proceeded to ignore the supplemental limine order by\n\n(i) posing questions to its expert witness which improperly touched upon the block billing issue,\n\nand (ii) arguing to the jury that Plaintiffs' attorney's fees should be reduced due to the fact that\n\ntheir attorneys' fee statements did not include itemizations of the time spent on each task.\n\n       4.      Defendant engaged         in improper jury argument which was inflammatory,\n\ncontained unsupported, extreme and personal attacks on the Plaintiffs and their attorneys, was\n\nunsupported by the evidence, was unsupported by the law or was contrary to the law, and which\n\nwas calculated to cause prejudice to the Plaintiffs and had the effect of striking at and harming\n\nthe judicial system itself, including:\n\n        (i)    argument to the jury that \"this case was about a lawyer money grab from day\n\n               one\";\n\n        (ii)    argument to the jury attacking the creation o f an association by certain property\n\n                owners in the Lakeview Heights Addition and the filing of this suit by the\n\n                association on their behalf, even though Texas law expressly permits the creation\n\n                of such an association and permits the filing of suit by a property owner's\n\n                designated representative, and Defendant introduced no evidence that the filing of\n\n\nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL\n                                                                                               Page 3\n\n\n\n\n                                                 TAB 1\n\n\n                                                 TAB 1\n\f                                                       I\n\n\n\n\n             suit by the Association rather than by each o f its individual members\n\n             unreasonably or unnecessarily increased the Plaintiffs' legal fees;\n\n     (iii)   argument to the jury attacking the Plaintiffs' use of a contingency fee arrangement\n\n             with their counsel by making the legally unsupported assertion that contingency\n\n             fee arrangements are only to be used by people who can't afford to pay an\n\n             attorney, as well as the factually unsupported argument that Plaintiff Wohlrabe\n\n             could pay for legal services i f she wanted to;\n\n     (iv)    argument to the jury attacking the propriety of Plaintiffs' contingency fee\n\n             arrangement by making the assertions that under the agreement the Plaintiffs are\n\n             never going to have to pay any fees and that the only way for them to obtain a\n\n             recovery is to create fees;\n\n     (v)     factually unsupported argument to the jury that under the Plaintiffs' contingency\n\n             fee arrangement the only thing Plaintiffs could collect would be their attorney's\n\n             fees, that the contingency fee agreements incentivized the attorneys to keep the\n\n             law suit going as long as possible so they could \"jet up\" or \"gin up\" the attorney's\n\n             fees and obtain a bigger attorney fee award, and that the attorney's fees were all\n\n             that the Plaintiffs were fighting about, even though the gravamen of Plaintiffs'\n\n             petition was their request for temporary and permanent injunctive relief;\n\n     (vi)    factually and legally unsupported argument to the jury that under the Plaintiffs'\n\n             contingency fee arrangement the more time Plaintiffs' counsel puts in the case the\n\n             more he recovers, and that this is the opposite of a typical contingency agreement;\n\n     (vii)   factually unsupported argument to the jury that Plaintiffs should have segregated\n\n             hundreds of thousands of dollars related to a cause of action which was dropped\n\n\nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL\n                                                                                           Page 4\n\n\n\n\n                                               TAB 1\n\n\n                                               TAB 1\n\f              by Plaintiffs after it had been pending for years;\n\n       5.     The afore-listed jury argument was designed to cause prejudice and harm to\n\nPlaintiffs, struck at and damaged the integrity of the judicial system itself, and was incurable.\n\nDefendant's repeated attacks on Plaintiffs and their counsel as having filed this suit simply as a\n\n\"money grab\" or an attempt to create attorney's fees or \"jet up\" or \"gin up\" attorney's fees,\n\nrather than for the legal and legitimate purpose of enforcing a neighborhood's deed restrictions,\n\nwas not based on any evidence and was extreme, unsupported, and designed to turn the jury\n\nagainst Plaintiffs and their counsel.     Defendant's repeated attacks on Plaintiffs' use of a\n\ncontingency fee arrangement with their counsel were unsupported by the law and were advanced\n\nfor the purpose of attempting to characterize Plaintiffs and their counsel as greedy and as having\n\npursued this legal action solely in order to extract money from Defendant.\n\n       6.      The cumulative effect of Defendant's violations of the Court's rulings, as outlined\n\nabove, and o f Defendant's extreme, unsupported, and improper jury argument, as outlined above,\n\nmight reasonably have resulted in, and probably did result in, an improper verdict and harm to\n\nthe Plaintiffs which was incurable.\n\n       7.      In addition, there was insufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that\n\n$290,000 is a reasonable attorney's fee for Plaintiffs through trial of the case and the finding is\n\nagainst the overwhelming weight o f the evidence.        There was no expert testimony or other\n\nevidence that $290,000 was a reasonable attorney's fee through trial in this case and there was\n\ninsufficient evidence to support any figure or range of figures that the jury might have used to\n\ndetermine that a reasonable attorney's fee through trial in this case was $290,000. The only\n\ndollar figure presented to the jury as to Plaintiffs' reasonable attorney's fees through trial was the\n\n$579,954.45 figure presented by Plaintiffs. There was insufficient evidence to support the\n\n\nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL\n                                                                                                Page 5\n\n\n\n\n                                                 TAB 1\n\n\n                                                 TAB 1\n\f$150,000 figure that Defendant sought to present to the jury because (i) there was no testimony\n\nor other evidence to support the $150,000 figure, and (ii) Defendant's expert's testimony\n\nconcerning legal fees which might not have been incurred had Plaintiffs filed their summary\n\njudgment motion four months earlier was incomplete and insufficient to support Defendant's\n\n$150,000 figure.\n\n        8.      For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that good cause exists for a new\n\ntrial of Plaintiffs' claim for attorney's fees through the trial of the case.\n\n        THEREFORE, it is ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that Plaintiffs' Motion\n\nfor New Trial is GRANTED.\n\n\n\n\n                                                Judge Presiding\n\n\n\n\n ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL\n                                                                                          Page 6\n\n\n\n\n                                                    TAB 1\n\n\n                                                    TAB 1\n\fCONDITIONALLY GRANT; and Opinion Filed August 15, 2017.\n\n\n\n\n                                          S    In The\n                                Court of Appeals\n                         Fifth District of Texas at Dallas\n                                       No. 05-16-01481-CV\n\n                         IN RE BCH DEVELOPMENT, LLC, Relator\n\n                        On Appeal from the County Court at Law No. 1\n                                    Dallas County, Texas\n                            Trial Court Cause No. CC-13-05900-A\n\n                                           OPINION\n                            Before Justices Evans, Brown, and Schenck\n                                    Opinion by Justice Schenck\n       After the trial court granted real parties in interest’s motion for summary judgment in this\n\ndeed restriction case, the matter proceeded to a jury trial on attorney’s fees pursuant to section\n\n5.006 of the property code. TEX. PROP. CODE ANN. § 5.006 (West 2014). The jury returned a\n\nverdict awarding real parties in interest $290,000 in attorney’s fees, rather than the full\n\n$579,954.45 they sought to recover. The trial court granted real parties in interest’s request for a\n\nnew trial.\n\n       Relator, BCH Development, LLC (“BCH”), filed a petition for writ of mandamus urging\n\nthat we direct the trial court to vacate its new trial order because none of the specified reasons for\n\nordering a new trial legally support relief in the form of a new trial. We agree and therefore\n\nconditionally grant mandamus relief and direct the trial court to vacate the September 21, 2016\n\nOrder Granting New Trial and enter a judgment on the jury verdict.\n\n\n\n                                               TAB 2\n\f                                                             BACKGROUND\n\n           This case arises from BCH’s attempt to construct a home with a habitable attic in the\n\nLakeview Heights Addition.                      Barbara Wohlrabe and Lakeview Heights Addition Property\n\nOwners’ Association (collectively, the “Association”) brought suit against BCH and Blanchard\n\nHomes, LLC asserting they were breaching and violating deed restrictions and seeking to enjoin\n\nthem from constructing a dwelling that has more than one above-ground level or floor of living\n\nspace, and from constructing a dwelling that has a habitable attic. The Association also asserted\n\na claim for tortious interference, which it later abandoned. After the trial court granted the\n\nAssociation’s motion for summary judgment and permanently enjoined BCH from building a\n\ndwelling in the neighborhood in excess of one story and with a habitable attic, the Association\n\nnonsuited its claims against Blanchard Homes, LLC.\n\n           At trial, the only remaining issue was an award of attorney’s fees under the property\n\ncode. One of the Association’s attorneys testified as the expert for the Association. He opined\n\nthat fees in the amount of $579,954.45 were reasonable in pursuing the breach and violation of\n\nthe deed restrictions claims in light of the extensive work that had been put into the case. On\n\ncross examination, he testified that the jury in a different, less complicated deed restriction case\n\nawarded $250,000 based on his testimony in that case.                                       BCH’s expert countered that the\n\nAssociation unnecessarily delayed seeking a summary judgment for a period of a year. The\n\nrecord—the Association’s exhibit of its attorney’s fees—shows that fees of approximately\n\n$361,000 accrued during the delay. 1 BCH’s expert, who has handled hundreds of property\n\nowners’ association cases, also testified as to what would be the reasonable hours expended\n\nduring various phases of a deed restriction case. They totaled 500 to 600 hours. The jury\n\n     1\n        BCH points out that the attorney’s fees sought by the Association, in the amount of $579,954, less the fees incurred during this delay in\nmoving for summary judgment, in the amount of $361,000, equals approximately $218,000. The Association responds that these amounts and\nthis calculation were never mentioned to the jury.\n\n\n\n                                                                     –2–\n                                                                    TAB 2\n\freturned a verdict awarding the Association $290,000. The Association moved for judgment\n\nnotwithstanding the verdict or for a new trial. The trial court granted the Association’s motion\n\nfor new trial. This original proceeding followed.\n\n                STANDARD FOR GRANTING MANDAMUS—ORDER GRANTING NEW TRIAL\n\n           A trial court’s order granting a new trial after a jury trial is subject to mandamus review.\n\nIn re Zimmer, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">893</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 898 (Tex.

In response, the trial\n\ncourt ruled that BCH’s expert would not be allowed to opine as to (1) the appropriate amount of\n\nfees that should be segregated, (2) the reasonable hourly rates in Dallas County (BCH conceded\n\nits expert would not be challenging the Association’s expert’s opinion on reasonable rates), and\n\n                                               –5–\n                                              TAB 2\n\f(3) the specific amount that should have been charged.\n\n            The trial court considered BCH’s attempt to present testimony concerning the number of\n\nhours that would be reasonable for prosecution of a deed restriction case like this one, and\n\nattempt to present testimony that the Association’s attorneys’ “block billing” statements were\n\nsomehow improper, to violate its limine orders. A review of the challenged comments reveals,\n\nhowever, that they did not reach into any of the topics precluded by the motion and the resulting\n\norder.\n\n            As for BCH’s expert’s testimony concerning a reasonable number of hours for\n\nprosecution of a case like this, in connection with the Association’s request that BCH’s expert be\n\nprecluded from testifying on certain matters, the trial court affirmatively permitted that\n\ntestimony, indicating that he could “say that, in his experience, someone working on a summary\n\njudgment of the type that was permitted or presented in this case would have been 20 hours not\n\n60 hours.” The court went on to clarify, after BCH’s attorney asked whether he could ask the\n\nexpert how many billable hours it should take to drive this type of case to resolution based upon\n\nhis experience, that “he can testify as to the hours, but not to the amounts.” Thus, BCH’s\n\nexpert’s testimony concerning billable hours did not violate a limine order and cannot serve as a\n\nlegally proper reason for granting a new trial.\n\n            As to testimony concerning “block billing,” it also was not subject to a limine order. In\n\nfact, BCH’s attorney elicited testimony concerning block billing from the Association’s expert\n\nwitness on cross examination without objection.3 In addition, the Association’s own attorney\n\n\n3\n    The following exchange occurred between BCH’s counsel and the Association’s expert witness:\n\n            Q.    And when you bill in this manner, sir, is that commonly required [sic] to as block billing?\n            A.    It’s called block billing.\n            Q.    And is it your understanding that Courts disfavor block billing?\n            A.    Absolutely not. In fact, I’ve testified in attorneys’ fees cases where we don't even introduce the fee statements. It’s\n                  not required.\n            Q.    And so is it your testimony that Courts do not -- or do you have an opinion -- let me strike that. Have you read any\n                  cases about block billing and whether the Court -- whether Courts favor block billing?\n\n\n                                                                       –6–\n                                                                      TAB 2\n\fquestioned its expert on block billing. 4 The trial court did not enter a limine order concerning\n\ntestimony, evidence, or argument as to whether task billing was necessary until after the\n\nAssociation’s expert had already testified.                               Thus, testimony elicited from the Association’s\n\nexpert concerning “block billing” did not violate a limine order and cannot serve as a legally\n\nproper reason for granting a new trial.\n\n             When BCH’s counsel attempted to question BCH’s expert as to what block billing does\n\nto the bill, the Association objected and the court sustained the objection before the basis for the\n\nobjection could be stated. BCH’s expert did not answer the question. Thereafter, the trial court\n\ninstructed the jury as follows:\n\n             Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I just want to give you an instruction that – or\n             an admonition to follow. You have previously heard examination questions,\n             arguments, or testimony which may have caused you to believe that Texas law\n             prohibits block billing in an attorneys’ fee statement. That is an incorrect\n             statement of Texas law. You are to disregard questions, arguments, or testimony\n             with regard to the issue of block billing.\n\n             A.     It depends on what Court you’re in. If you’re in a bankruptcy court, you cannot block bill.\n             Q.     Okay. Have you read any cases from the Fifth Circuit about what they think about block billing?\n             A.     It depends if you’re talking about a bankruptcy case. If you’re talking about a bankruptcy case, the Fifth Circuit says\n                    you can’t block bill in bankruptcy cases because that’s a debtor, and the bankruptcy courts won’t let you block bill.\n             Q.     What about non-bankruptcy cases, sir?\n             A.     In non-bankruptcy cases, no, I’m not familiar with any prohibition by the Fifth Circuit in block billing to get\n                    attorneys’ fees. If you have the case, let me see it please.\n             ....\n             Q.     So, at least as far as you’re concerned, there is -- block billing is fine, true?\n             A.     In getting recovery of attorneys’ fees in Texas under 5.006, block billing is fine because you don’t even have to\n                    introduce your fee statements.\n             Q.     Have you ever done any research about block billing yourself? Have you done any?\n             A.     Yes.\n             Q.     Okay. You have done research on block billing?\n             A.     In bankruptcy cases, yes.\n             Q.     In non-bankruptcy cases, sir. I’m talking about civil cases that aren’t bankruptcy cases.\n             A.     Mr. Culpepper, I’m pretty much aware of the cases that have to deal with proving up attorneys’ fees in state court in Texas, and\n                    I’m not familiar with a case that says you cannot block bill and recover attorneys’ fees. If you have one, I’d be happy to read it.\n                    I’m not familiar with a case that prohibits block billing.\n4\n    The following exchange took place between the Association’s counsel and the Association’s expert:\n\n             Q.     Now there was a great deal of talk about-- he mentioned block billing. And would the other type of billing where you\n                    put the amount down for each individual task be called task billing?\n             A.     It’s task billing.\n             Q.     And, [Association’s expert], is it your opinion -- are you aware of any opinion which prohibits the recovery of\n                    attorneys’ fees based on block billing?\n             A.     Absolutely not. That [sic] why he -- if he’s got one, I wanted Mr. Culpepper to show me because I’m not aware of\n                    one.\n             Q.     Have -- now while you might be able to task bill in a case, is there anything wrong with block billing?\n             A.     Absolutely not. That’s why I said for 12 percent of our clients, we bill block bill. For 10 percent, we task bill. It’s a\n                    specific request by client. If you’re doing bankruptcy work, the bankruptcy -- if you’re doing litigation for a debtor in\n                    a bankruptcy case, then the bankruptcy court requires you to do task billing, not block billing.\n\n\n                                                                          –7–\n                                                                        TAB 2\n\f       When a trial court instructs the jury to disregard evidence offered in violation of a motion\n\nin limine, we may review that evidence to determine whether an instruction to disregard was\n\nadequate to cure its admission.

App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n2015) (orig. proceeding). We agree. We conclude the unobjected to arguments the trial court\n\nconsidered to be attacks against the Association and its attorneys and critical of the use of a\n\ncontingency fee agreement were not preserved and did not amount to fundamental error. Thus,\n\nthey cannot serve as legally proper reasons for granting a new trial.\n\n       As to the jury argument that $150,000 was a reasonable attorney’s fee through trial, in\n\naccordance with the trial court’s directive, BCH’s expert testified concerning reasonable billable\n\nhours in a case like this. They totaled 500 to 600 hours. The evidence established Wohlrabe,\n\nwho is an attorney with the firm representing the Association, charges $300 per hour for her\n\n                                                –9–\n                                              TAB 2\n\fprofessional services.   Thus, BCH’s comment that a reasonable fee was $150,000 was a\n\nreasonable inference or deduction from the evidence, and did not violate the trial court’s limine\n\norder concerning a specific amount of fees, because the order was directed to BCH’s expert’s\n\ntestimony, not to BCH’s attorney and argument. Thus, the argument was not improper.\n\n       As to argument concerning segregation of fees, BCH’s counsel stated:\n\n       And [the Association’s expert] told you, well, I took out $25,000. If you look at\n       the fee statements, remember he had a cause of action for years, one whole cause\n       of action that he dropped, he couldn’t recover attorney’s fees on. And he’s saying,\n       but that was only $25,000. If you look at the fee statements, you will see that they\n       should have segregated hundreds of thousands of dollars related to that claim.\n\nCounsel for the Association objected to this statement without stating the grounds, and the trial\n\ncourt sustained the objection. The evidence established that segregation of recoverable fees from\n\nnon-recoverable fees was required in this case. The jury heard evidence that the fees were not\n\nsufficiently segregated, that the fees related to the tortious interference with contract claim were\n\nnot recoverable, and that the tortious interference with contract claim was dismissed after it had\n\nbeen pending for years. Thus, BCH’s counsel’s comments about the $25,000 segregation and\n\nthe claim upon which the Association could not recover were comments on the facts and\n\nreasonable inferences therefrom. BCH’s counsel referred the jury to the fee statements, which\n\nwere in evidence, to decide the issue of segregation itself and the comment about hundreds of\n\nthousands of dollars was hyperbole. The arguments were, thus, not improper.\n\n       Accordingly, the arguments cited as reasons for granting a new trial are not correct or\n\nlegally appropriate bases upon which to order a new trial.\n\n       2. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n       As to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury’s verdict, the trial court stated\n\nthere was no expert testimony or other evidence that $290,000 was a reasonable attorney’s fee in\n\nthis case and there was insufficient evidence to support any figure or range of figures that the\n\n                                               –10–\n                                              TAB 2\n\fjury might have used to determine that a reasonable attorney’s fee in this case was $290,000.\n\nThe court continued by stating the only dollar figure presented to the jury as to the Association’s\n\nreasonable attorney’s fees was the $579,954.45 figure presented by the Association.            We\n\ndisagree.\n\n       When a party puts on evidence that contradicts the fees sought by the plaintiff—whether\n\nby cross examination of the plaintiff’s expert or by presenting its own expert—the trier of fact is\n\nnot bound to the number provided by the plaintiff’s expert.

App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2011, no pet.). While the\n\nAssociation’s expert opined fees in the amount of $579,954.24 were reasonable and necessary,\n\nBCH’s expert testified as to fees that could have been avoided by seeking summary judgment\n\nearlier in the case, and opined that a case like this one should have required 500 to 600 hours of\n\nattorney time. The evidence also established Wohlrabe’s billable rate is $300 per hour. And 500\n\nhours at $300 per hour equates to a minimum of $150,000, as noted previously. During closing\n\nargument, the trial court permitted, over objection, argument that “had [the Association] chosen\n\nto file [their motions for summary judgment] early on . . . they could have cut out a tremendous\n\namount of fees they incurred after March of 2014 . . . . They said they incurred $429,381, if you\n\nadd it up.” Subtracting this sum from the claimed fees of approximately $579,000, leaves\n\napproximately $150,000.\n\n       Thus, the evidence showed a range of fees from $150,000 to slightly over $579,000. The\n\njury awarded the Association $290,000, well within the range supported by the evidence. Under\n\nthese circumstances, the evidence was sufficient to support the jury’s award of $290,000.

SCHENCK\n                                                      JUSTICE\n\n\n\n161481F.P05\n\n\n\n                                                 –12–\n                                                TAB 2\n\f</pre>",
