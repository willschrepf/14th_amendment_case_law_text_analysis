The trial court erred by denying the City’s plea and otherwise had\n        no subject-matter jurisdiction over Appellees’ claims. ......................... 11\n\n        A.      The trial court had no subject-matter jurisdiction because\n                Appellees’ TPIA mandamus and attorney fee claims were\n                not justiciable. ......................................................................... 11\n\n                1.       Appellees’ TPIA mandamus and attorney fee claims\n                         were no longer justiciable at the time of final judgment\n                         because they were mooted when the City, prior to\n                         final judgment, produced all withheld documents that\n                         the trial court ordered the City to disclose. ....................... 11\n\n                2.       As a result, the trial court had no subject-matter\n                         jurisdiction because Appellees’ TPIA mandamus and\n                         attorney fee claims were not justiciable at the time of\n                         final judgment. ............................................................... 13\n\n        B.      The trial court also had no subject-matter jurisdiction\n                because all Appellees’ claims are barred by immunity. ............... 15\n\n                1.       Appellees’ TDJA claims are barred by immunity\n                         because they are redundant and duplicative of their\n                         TPIA claims. .................................................................. 15\n\n                2.       Appellees’ TPIA mandamus claims are also barred by\n                         immunity because the TPIA does not waive the City’s\n                         immunity and the only proper defendant for such\n                         claims is the pertinent public information officer. ............. 17\n\n                3.       Appellees’ TDJA claims are likewise barred by\n                         immunity because the TDJA also does not waive the\n                         City’s immunity and the only proper defendant for\n                         such claims is the pertinent public information officer. ..... 20\n                4.       As a result, the trial court also had no subject-matter\n                         jurisdiction because all Appellees’ claims are barred by\n                         immunity. ...................................................................... 21\n\n\n                                                     iv\n\fII.        The trial court erred by awarding attorney fees to Appellees\n           because there was no evidence or insufficient evidence to support\n           any award of fees to them. ................................................................. 22\n\n           A.      Kallinen was not entitled to any award of attorney fees\n                   because he did not actually incur any attorney fees—as\n                   Kubosh incurred all the claimed fees. ........................................ 22\n\n           B.      Appellees were not entitled to any award of attorney fees\n                   because they failed to properly segregate recoverable\n                   (alleged) fees from non-recoverable (alleged) fees. ..................... 24\n\n           C.      Appellees offered no evidence or insufficient evidence to\n                   support the amount of the award of attorney fees. ..................... 25\nIII.       The trial court also had no subject-matter jurisdiction over\n           Kubosh’s claims; Kubosh’s TPIA mandamus and attorney fee\n           claims were never justiciable due to lack of ripeness and standing\n           because he never submitted any TPIA request to the City. .................. 28\n\nConclusion and Prayer ............................................................................... 29\n\nCertificate of Compliance ........................................................................... 30\n\nCertificate of Service .................................................................................. 31\n\nAppendix\n\n      A.

Const. art. XI, § 5. In accordance with\nSection 9.008(b) of the Texas Local Government Code, the City respectfully requests this\nCourt to take judicial notice of its published charter and status thereunder as a home-rule\ncity. See Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code § 9.008(b).\n2\n  In its original brief in this appeal (prior to the Supreme Court’s ruling), the City addressed\nissues relating to the trial court’s original final judgment in an abundance of caution given\nthat it did learn that the trial court entered a modified final judgment until the day it filed its\noriginal appeal brief. Although the modified final judgment is at issue here, the City\naddresses issues relating to Kubosh also in an abundance of caution in the event that this\nCourt’s September 3, 2015 order (App. J) allowing supplemental briefing by the parties does\nnot contemplate the filing of a responsive brief by the City to Appellees’ supplemental brief.\nIn addition, for the same reason, to the extent that any of the City’s arguments as to\nKallinen also apply to Kubosh, the City addresses those arguments as to Appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                                                xi\n\fTrial court disposition:     On July 12, 2012, the trial court entered a modified\n                             final judgment dismissing Kubosh due to lack of\n                             standing and awarding attorney fees only to\n                             Kallinen. CR[2].17-18; App. G. The City timely\n                             appealed.

The\n                             Texas Supreme Court reversed this Court’s judgment\n                             and remanded to this Court for further proceedings\n                             in accordance with its opinion. See Kallinen v. City of\n                             Houston, 462 S.W.3d 25 (Tex. 2015); App. I.\n\nCurrent procedural           On September 3, 2015, this Court entered an order\nposture:                     allowing the parties to file supplemental briefing to\n                             aid this Court’s consideration of the issues on\n                             remand. App. J.\n\n\n                      Statement Regarding Oral Argument\n\n      The City respectfully requests that the Court hear oral argument in this\n\nappeal to allow the parties an opportunity to simplify and focus the issues for\n\nthe Court’s consideration.\n\n\n                                  Issues Presented\n\n      The trial court erred in denying the City’s plea to the jurisdiction and\n\nmotion for new trial for the following reasons:\n\n\n\n                                         xii\n\f1.   The trial court had no subject-matter jurisdiction over\n     Appellees’ claims.\n\n     a. The trial court had no subject-matter jurisdiction over\n        Appellees’ TPIA mandamus and attorney fee claims because\n        they were no longer justiciable at the time of final judgment;\n        they were mooted when the City, prior to final judgment,\n        produced to Kallinen all withheld documents that the trial\n        court ordered the City to disclose.\n\n     b. The trial court also had no subject-matter jurisdiction\n        because all Appellees’ claims are barred by immunity.\n\n        i. Appellees’ TDJA claims are barred by immunity because\n           they are redundant and duplicative of their TPIA claims.\n\n       ii. Appellees’ TPIA mandamus claims are also barred by\n           immunity because the TPIA does not waive the City’s\n           immunity and the only proper defendant for such claims\n           is the pertinent public information officer.\n\n      iii. Appellees’ TDJA claims are likewise barred by immunity\n           because the TDJA likewise also does not waive the City’s\n           immunity and the only proper defendant for such claims\n           is the pertinent public information officer.\n\n2.   The trial court erred by awarding attorney fees to Appellees\n     because there was no evidence or insufficient evidence to\n     support any award of fees to them.\n\n     a. Kallinen was not entitled to any award of attorney fees\n        because he did not actually incur any attorney fees—as\n        Kubosh incurred all the claimed fees.\n\n     b. Appellees offered no evidence or insufficient evidence to\n        support the amount of the award of attorney fees.\n\n3.   The trial court also had no subject-matter jurisdiction over\n     Kubosh’s claims; Kubosh’s TPIA mandamus and attorney fee\n     claims were never justiciable due to lack of ripeness and\n\n                                  xiii\n\fstanding because he never submitted any TPIA request to the\nCity.\n\n\n\n\n                          xiv\n\f                               Introduction and Overview\n\n       After the City released most of the documents that Kallinen requested\n\nrelating to the City’s red light traffic camera system under the TPIA, Appellees\n\nsued the City seeking mandamus relief (as well as attorney fees) under the\n\nTPIA to compel disclosure of documents that the City withheld based on\n\nTPIA disclosure exceptions. They filed their suit against the City, not a City\n\nofficial. They also sought redundant and duplicative declaratory relief (as well\n\nas attorney fees) under the TDJA to declare that disclosure is required. Kubosh\n\njoined the suit despite the fact that only Kallinen submitted any TPIA request\n\nto the City.\n\n       In late 2009, the trial court ruled on the TPIA exceptions asserted by the\n\nCity, and the City immediately complied by producing all documents that the\n\ntrial court ruled were not excepted from disclosure. In late 2011, the trial court\n\nentered a final judgment which included an attorney fee award jointly to\n\nAppellees. Later, in mid-2012, after the City filed a motion for new trial and\n\nplea to the jurisdiction, the trial court entered modified final judgment\n\ndismissing Kubosh for lack of standing and awarding attorney fees only to\n\nKallinen.3 But as a result of the City’s production of all documents that the trial\n\n\n3\n In its original brief in this appeal, given that it did not learn that the trial court entered a\nmodified final judgment until the day it filed that brief, the City addressed issues relating to\n\fcourt ordered the City to disclose, Kallinen’s claims were all rendered moot\n\nprior to final judgment and he was entitled to no attorney fee award. As a\n\nresult, all Kallinen’s claims should be dismissed for lack of subject matter\n\njurisdiction and the fee award to him should be reversed and rendered in the\n\nCity’s favor.\n\n\n                                  Statement of Facts\n\nA.     Only Kallinen submits TPIA Requests to City.\n\n       In November and December 2008, Kallinen submitted four email\n\nrequests to the City pursuant to the TPIA requesting release of documents\n\nrelating to the City’s red light traffic camera system. CR.41-48. Kubosh did not\n\nsubmit to the City any TPIA request for documents. CR.75, 194, 322, 607,\n\n674, 746-47, 920, 1001; CR[1].139, 258, 262; RR[1].28, 54. Kallinen’s requests\n\ndid not mention or reference Kubosh. CR.41-48.\n\nB.     City releases 82% of requested documents.\n\n       The City released approximately 3,235 pages of documents to Kallinen\n\npursuant to his requests (about 82% of all responsive documents). CR.398,\n\nthe trial court’s original final judgment in an abundance of caution. Although the modified\nfinal judgment is at issue here, the City addresses issues relating to Kubosh also in an\nabundance of caution in the event that this Court’s September 3, 2015 order allowing\nsupplemental briefing by the parties does not contemplate the filing of a reply brief by the\nCity. In addition, for the same reason, to the extent that any of the City’s arguments as to\nKallinen would also apply to Kubosh, the City addresses those arguments as to both.\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f541-68, 586, 746, 825, 883, 890, 901, 908, 1054, 1071. The City withheld only\n\nabout 700 pages of documents based primarily on TPIA disclosure exceptions\n\nfor materials protected by the deliberative process privilege and attorney-client\n\nprivilege. CR.398, 586, 746, 825, 883, 890, 901, 908, 1054, 1071. The City also\n\ntimely requested a ruling by the Texas Attorney General on application of the\n\nexceptions. CR.75, 80, 81-83, 86-91, 194, 199-202, 205-10, 321, 326-29, 334-\n\n39, 399, 421-27, 587, 607, 746-47, 867, 919-20, 1054, 1071.\n\nC.    Appellees sue City.\n\n      On December 26, 2008, both Appellees sued the City seeking mandamus\n\nrelief under the TPIA to compel disclosure of all the documents that Kallinen\n\nsought in his four requests to the City and declaratory relief under the TDJA to\n\ndeclare that disclosure is required. CR.2-8, 30-38. Appellees filed suit: (1) less\n\nthan two weeks after Kallinen’s fourth request to the City, (2) before the City\n\ncompleted all its submissions to the Attorney General supporting TPIA\n\nexceptions for the withheld documents, (3) before the Attorney General had an\n\nopportunity to complete its review of the City’s submissions and issue its\n\nruling, and (4) despite the fact that Kubosh never requested any documents\n\nfrom the City. CR.2-8, 30-38, 41-48, 75, 80-83, 86-91, 176-77, 194, 199-202,\n\n205-10, 321, 326-29, 334-39, 341-42, 399, 421-27, 429-34, 587, 607, 746-47,\n\n867, 919-20, 1054, 1071, 1110-11, 1135-36, 1139-42, 1186-87.\n\n\n                                        3\n\fD.    Appellees ensure Attorney General does not rule on City’s proper\n      request.\n\n      On January 30, 2009, Appellees (through their counsel) sent an email to\n\nthe Attorney General’s office requesting that it decline to issue a ruling, despite\n\nthe City’s proper request, based on the pendency of their recently-filed lawsuit\n\nagainst the City. CR.399, 428-30, 1110, 1135-36. On December 16, 2008, and\n\nJanuary 8, 2008, the Attorney General sent letters to the City declining to issue\n\nany ruling and instead deferring to the trial court to decide whether the\n\nwithheld documents were excepted from disclosure under the TPIA. CR.176-\n\n77, 341-42, 399, 431-34, 1110-11, 1139-42, 1186-87.\n\nE.    Trial court grants partial summary judgment to Appellees; City\n      releases all documents held not excepted from disclosure.\n\n      On September 14, 2009, Appellees filed a motion for partial summary\n\njudgment arguing that the withheld documents were not excepted from\n\ndisclosure. CR.615, 648-54. On September 28, 2009, the City filed a response.\n\nCR.398-541. On October 2, 2009, Appellees filed a reply. CR.569-74. On\n\nOctober 12, 2009, the trial court entered two orders granting in part and\n\ndenying in part Appellees’ motion for summary judgment and ordering the\n\nCity to disclose some of the withheld documents. CR.582-85; App. A; App. B.\n\nThe City then immediately disclosed to Appellees all withheld documents that\n\nthe trial court ordered the City to disclose. CR.1104.\n\n\n\n                                        4\n\fF.    Trial court holds attorney fees hearing; enters final judgment for\n      Appellees.\n\n      On November 16, 2009, Appellees filed a motion for entry of judgment\n\nand award of attorney fees. CR.659-67. On December 3, 2009, the City filed a\n\nresponse. CR.882-920. On December 8, 2009, the trial court entered an order\n\nreiterating its October 12, 2009 ruling and stating that Appellees’ attorney fee\n\nclaim would be heard at the January 2010 trial setting (which was postponed\n\nseveral times). CR.925, 931-32, 940-41; App. C.4\n\n      On November 20, 2009, the City filed a motion to strike Kubosh as a\n\nparty-plaintiff on the ground that he has no standing to seek relief as a TPIA\n\n“requestor” because he never actually submitted to the City any request for\n\ndocuments. CR.746-50. On November 25, 2009, Appellees filed a response.\n\nCR.810-14. On December 30, 2009, Appellees filed a supplemental response.\n\nCR.935-37. On March 1, 2010, the trial court entered an order denying the\n\nCity’s motion to strike Kubosh. CR.969; App. D.\n\n      On October 6, 2010, the trial court held a hearing on Appellees’ attorney\n\nfee claim against the City. RR[1]. On October 12, 2011, the court entered a\n\n\n\n4\n  Judge Tracy Christopher presided over all trial court proceedings below until December\n2009 when she was appointed as a Justice of the Fourteenth Court of Appeals. After Judge\nChristopher entered the December 8, 2009 order, Judge Caroline Baker presided over all\nsubsequent trial court proceedings below.\n\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\ffinal judgment again reiterating its October 12, 2009 ruling and awarding\n\nattorney fees to Appellees jointly.

On January 5, 2012, the court\n\nentered an order granting in part and denying in part the City’s new trial\n\nmotion and denying the City’s plea. CR.1208; App. F. The court granted the\n\nCity’s new trial motion only as to the attorney fee award to Kubosh and denied\n\nthe remainder of the motion. CR.1208; App. F. The parties subsequently filed\n\nmotions seeking clarification of the trial court’s ruling. CR[1].2-5, 44-122, 257-\n\n60. But in an abundance of caution, on January 12, 2012, the City filed a\n\nnotice of appeal. CR.1213-14.\n\nH.    Trial court modifies judgment, dismisses Kubosh, awards fees only to\n      Kallinen\n\n      On March 9, 2012, Appellees filed a motion for reconsideration of the\n\ntrial court’s ruling on the City’s new trial motion as to the award of attorney\n\nfees to Kubosh or (alternatively) for severance as to Kubosh so that the\n\njudgment as to Kallinen may become final and appealable.

The City also filed a\n\nmotion seeking (alternatively) entry of judgment awarding no attorney fees to\n\nany Appellee. CR[1].44-122. On May 4, 2012, Appellees filed a supplemental\n\nmotion for reconsideration of the trial court’s ruling on the City’s new trial\n\nmotion as to the award of attorney fees to Kubosh or (alternatively) for entry of\n\nan amended final judgment and order reflecting dismissal as to Kubosh.\n\nCR[1].257-60. On May 24, 2012, the City filed a response. CR[2].2.\n\n      On July 12, 2012, the trial court entered a modified final judgment ruling\n\nthat Kubosh has no standing and awarding him no attorney fees. CR[2].17-18;\n\nApp. G. On July 24, 2012, the City filed a request for findings of fact and\n\nconclusion of law. CR[2].19-20. On August 10, 2012, the City filed a motion\n\nfor new trial as to the trial court’s amended final judgment. CR[2].21-33. On\n\nAugust 15, 2012, Appellees filed proposed findings of fact and conclusion of\n\nlaw. CR[2].36-41. On August 17, 2012, the City filed a notice of past due\n\nfindings of fact and conclusion of law. CR[3].26-27.\n\n      On September 19, 2012, in an abundance of caution, the City filed\n\nanother notice of appeal as to the trial court’s amended final judgment.\n\nCR[3].29-30. On October 3, 2012, Appellees also filed a notice of appeal notice\n\nof appeal as to the trial court’s amended final judgment. CR[4].3-4.

CR[4].5-6.\n\nI.     This Court rules for City; Texas Supreme Court disagrees.\n\n       On August 29, 2013, this Court reversed the trial court’s order denying\n\nthe City’s plea and rendered judgment that Appellees claims against the City\n\nare dismissed for want of jurisdiction. App. H. On March 20, 2015, the\n\nSupreme Court reversed this Court’s judgment and remanded to this Court for\n\nfurther proceedings in accordance with its opinion. App. I. Both this Court’s\n\nand the Supreme Court’s rulings focused on the City’s argument regarding\n\nwhether the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over Appellees’ claims\n\nbefore the Attorney General ruled on the City’s request for decision on the\n\ndocuments it withheld based on TPIA disclosure exceptions—and did not\n\naddress other arguments raised by the City. App. H; App. I.5\n\n\n                                 Summary of Argument\n\n       First, Appellees’ TPIA mandamus and attorney fee claims were not\n\njusticiable. Appellees’ TPIA mandamus and attorney fee claims were no longer\n\n\n\n5\n For the Court’s convenience, the City includes in this brief arguments (infra, pp. 17-28) that\nwere raised in its original appeal brief in the event the Court prefers to have one brief\ncontaining all the City’s arguments not addressed by this Court’s and the Supreme Court’s\nrulings.\n\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\fjusticiable at the time of final judgment because they were mooted when, prior\n\nto final judgment, the City produced to Kallinen all withheld documents that\n\nthe trial court ordered the City to disclose, obviating any justiciable\n\ncontroversy regarding entitlement to mandamus relief or attorney fees. The\n\ntrial court therefore had no subject matter jurisdiction at the time it entered its\n\nmodified final judgment because Appellees’ TPIA mandamus and attorney fee\n\nclaims were no longer justiciable at that time due to mootness.\n\n      Second, Appellees’ claims against the City are barred by governmental\n\nimmunity, which defeats subject matter jurisdiction, for several reasons.\n\nAppellees’ TDJA claims are barred by immunity because they are redundant\n\nand duplicative of their TPIA claims. Appellees’ TPIA mandamus claims are\n\nalso barred by immunity because the TPIA does not waive the City’s immunity\n\nand the only proper defendant for such claims is the pertinent public\n\ninformation officer. Appellees’ TDJA claims are likewise barred by immunity\n\nbecause the TDJA likewise does not waive immunity and the only proper\n\ndefendant for such claims is the pertinent public information officer. The trial\n\ncourt therefore had no subject matter jurisdiction because Appellees’ claims\n\nagainst the City are barred by governmental immunity.\n\n      Third, there was no evidence or insufficient evidence to support any\n\naward of attorney fees to Appellees. Kallinen was not entitled to any award of\n\n\n                                        9\n\fattorney fees because he did not actually incur any fees—as Kubosh, who was\n\nnot a “requestor” and therefore had no justiciable claim on which to sue,\n\nincurred all the claimed fees. In addition, Appellees offered no evidence or\n\ninsufficient evidence to support the amount of the attorney fee award. The trial\n\ncourt therefore also erred by awarding attorney fees to Appellees because they\n\nfailed to satisfy their burden to support any award of fees.\n\n      Finally, although the trial court ultimately dismissed Kubosh and his\n\nclaims, the City nonetheless also addresses those claims here in the event that\n\nit does not have the opportunity to file a reply brief. Kubosh’s TPIA\n\nmandamus and attorney fee claims were never justiciable due to lack of\n\nripeness and standing because he never actually submitted any TPIA request to\n\nthe City, obviating any status as a TPIA “requestor” authorized to file suit.\n\nThe trial court therefore also never had no subject matter jurisdiction over\n\nKubosh’s TPIA mandamus and attorney fee claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                        10\n\f                                        Argument\n\nI.     The trial court erred by denying the City’s plea and otherwise had no\n       subject-matter jurisdiction over Appellees’ claims.\n\n       A.     The trial court had no subject-matter jurisdiction because\n              Appellees’ TPIA mandamus and attorney fee claims were not\n              justiciable.\n\n              1.     Appellees’ TPIA mandamus and attorney fee claims were\n                     no longer justiciable at the time of final judgment because\n                     they were mooted when the City, prior to final judgment,\n                     produced all withheld documents that the trial court\n                     ordered the City to disclose.\n\n       The trial court had no subject-matter jurisdiction over Appellees’ TPIA\n\nmandamus and attorney fee claims due to mootness. The TPIA provides that,\n\nin an action under Section 552.321, “the court shall assess costs of litigation\n\nand reasonable attorney fees incurred by a plaintiff who substantially prevails”\n\n(subject to certain exceptions). See Tex. Gov’t Code § 552.323(a).6 The term\n\n“substantially prevails” incorporates the concept of a “prevailing party” and\n\nmust be construed in line with prevailing-party requirements for recovering\n\nattorney fees. See Tex. State Bd. of Veterinary Med. Exam’rs v. Giggleman, 408\n\nS.W.3d 696, 703 (Tex. App.—Austin 2013, no pet.).\n\n6\n  Section 552.323(a) specifies exception prohibiting the court from assessing “costs and fees\nagainst a governmental body if the court finds that the governmental body acted in\nreasonable reliance on: (1) a judgment or an order of a court applicable to the governmental\nbody; (2) the published opinion of an appellate court; or (3) a written decision of the\nattorney general, including a decision issued under Subchapter G or an opinion issued\nunder Section 402.042.” See Tex. Gov’t Code § 552.323(a).\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\f      Although a requestor may plead TPIA mandamus and attorney fee\n\nclaims and even obtain favorable interlocutory summary judgment on\n\nmandamus, the case is rendered moot and the requestor does not substantially\n\nprevail where the governmental body produces the disputed documents before\n\nfinal judgment, thus obviating any justiciable controversy. See Giggleman, 408\n\nS.W.3d at 702-06; see also Int’l Grp. P’ship v. KB Home Lone Star L.P., 295\n\nS.W.3d 650, 653 (Tex. 2009) (to qualify as “prevailing party” there must be\n\njudicially sanctioned relief on the merits that materially alters the legal\n\nrelationship between the parties such as damages award, injunctive or\n\ndeclaratory relief, or consent decree or settlement in party’s favor). Satisfaction\n\nof the TPIA “substantially prevails” prong for fee recovery requires an\n\nenforceable final judgment against the defendant from whom fees are sought,\n\nor comparable relief through a consent decree or settlement. See Giggleman, 408\n\nS.W.3d at 703; see also Int’l Grp. P’ship, 295 S.W.3d at 654.\n\n      In this case, Appellees’ TPIA mandamus and attorney fee claims were\n\nmooted prior to the trial court’s final judgment. It is undisputed that, after the\n\ntrial court granted summary judgment in favor of Appellees but before it\n\nentered final judgment, the City immediately and voluntarily produced to\n\nAppellees all withheld documents that the trial court ordered the City to\n\ndisclose. CR.1104. By doing so, the City obviated any justiciable controversy\n\n\n                                        12\n\fregarding Kallinen’s (or Kubosh’s) entitlement to mandamus relief or attorney\n\nfees. See Giggleman, 408 S.W.3d at 704. This result is particularly appropriate\n\nhere, where the City timely and properly requested an Attorney General\n\nopinion, but was deprived of the ability to obtain and rely on such an\n\nopinion—by Appellees’ filing suit before the Attorney General ruled and\n\nrequesting the Attorney General to defer ruling due to their suit. Had the City\n\nnot been so deprived, Appellees would not have been entitled to attorney fees\n\nbecause the City would have complied with the Attorney General ruling. It is\n\nalso consistent with both Section 552.321 and Giggleman to hold that the City\n\nwhich—once it was provided with authoritative guidance in the trial court’s\n\nruling, relied on it, and produced the documents—should not have been\n\nsubjected to an award of attorney fees.\n\n\n            2.    As a result, the trial court had no subject-matter\n                  jurisdiction because Appellees’ TPIA mandamus and\n                  attorney fee claims were not justiciable at the time of final\n                  judgment.\n\n      Subject matter jurisdiction is essential to the authority of a court to\n\ndecide a case. See M.D. Anderson Cancer Center v. Novak, 52 S.W.3d 704, 708\n\n(Tex. 2001); Tex. Ass’n of Bus. v. Tex. Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 443 (Tex.\n\n1993). Subject matter jurisdiction requires that the party bringing the suit have\n\nstanding, that there be a live controversy between the parties, and that the case\n\n\n                                          13\n\fbe justiciable. See State Bar of Tex. v. Gomez, 891 S.W.2d 243, 245 (Tex. 1994);\n\nTex. Ass’n of Bus., 852 S.W.2d at 443-46. The justiciability doctrines of ripeness,\n\nstanding, and lack of mootness are constitutional components of subject matter\n\njurisdiction—and are rooted in the prohibition against advisory opinions,\n\nwhich is rooted, in turn, in the separation-of-powers doctrine. See Patterson v.\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Houston, 971 S.W.2d 439, 442-43 (Tex. 1998); Williams v.\n\nLara, 52 S.W.3d 171, 184 (Tex. 2000).\n\n      Ripeness concerns when an action may be brought and requires that, at\n\nthe time a lawsuit is filed, the facts have developed sufficiently so that an injury\n\nhas occurred or is likely to occur, rather than being contingent or remote. See\n\nPatterson, 971 S.W.2d at 442. A controversy is not ripe when resolution\n\ndepends on contingent or hypothetical facts. Id. at 443. Standing concerns who\n\nmay bring an action and requires the plaintiff to be personally aggrieved.\n\nDaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Inman, 252 S.W.3d 299, 304-05 (Tex. 2008). A plaintiff\n\ndoes not have standing unless the alleged injury is concrete and particularized,\n\nactual or imminent, not hypothetical. Id. at 305. Mootness concerns the\n\ncessation of what was once a live controversy between the parties. Williams, 52\n\nS.W.3d at 184. A controversy ceases to exist and a case becomes moot if the\n\nissues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable\n\n\n\n\n                                        14\n\finterest in the outcome. Id. If a case becomes moot, the parties lose standing to\n\nmaintain their claims. Id.\n\n      The trial court therefore had no jurisdiction at the time it entered final\n\njudgment because Appellees’ TPIA mandamus and attorney fee claims were\n\nmooted, and thus no longer justiciable, prior to that judgment due to the City’s\n\nproduction of the remaining documents to Kallinen.\n\n\n      B.    The trial court also had no subject-matter jurisdiction because\n            all Appellees’ claims are barred by immunity.\n\n            1.    Appellees’ TDJA claims are barred by immunity because\n                  they are redundant and duplicative of their TPIA claims.\n\n      The TDJA also does not waive immunity for Appellees’ TDJA claims\n\nseeking relief that is redundant or duplicative of the relief they seek through\n\ntheir TPIA mandamus claims. Declaratory relief is proper if a justiciable\n\ncontroversy exists as to the rights and status of the parties and the controversy\n\nwill be resolved by the declaration sought. See Bonham State Bank v. Beadle, 907\n\nS.W.2d 465, 467 (Tex. 1995); Tex. Ass’n of Bus., 852 S.W.2d at 446. But a mere\n\nrequest for declaratory relief alone does not establish jurisdiction because the\n\nTDJA is not a grant of jurisdiction, but merely a procedural device for deciding\n\ncases already within a court’s jurisdiction. See Chenault v. Phillips, 914 S.W.2d\n\n140, 141 (Tex. 1996) (per curiam); Tex. Ass’n of Bus., 852 S.W.2d at 444. The\n\n\n\n                                       15\n\fTDJA is not available to settle disputes already pending before a court. See\n\nBHP Petroleum Co., Inc. v. Millard, 800 S.W.2d 838, 841 (Tex. 1990).7\n\n       Under the redundant remedies doctrine, courts will not entertain an\n\naction brought under the TDJA when the same claim could be pursued\n\nthrough different channels. See Patel v. Tex. Dep’t of Licensing & Regulation, 469\n\nS.W.3d 69, 79 (Tex. 2015). The focus of the doctrine is on the initiation of the\n\ncase and, in the jurisdictional and immunity context, whether the Legislature\n\ncreated a statutory waiver of sovereign immunity that permits the parties to\n\nraise their claims through some avenue other than the UDJA. Id. The Texas\n\nSupreme Court, as well as the Austin Court of Appeals, has confirmed that an\n\naward of attorney fees under the TDJA is unavailable if the claim for\n\ndeclaratory relief is merely incidental to or redundant of relief sought through\n\nTPIA claims. See Jackson v. State Office of Admin. Hearings, 351 S.W.3d 290, 300-\n\n01 (Tex. 2011); Giggleman, 408 S.W.3d at 704.\n\n       In this case, Appellees’ pleadings confirm that their TDJA claims are\n\nredundant and duplicative their TPIA claims. Their TDJA and TPIA claims\n\nboth complain only about the disclosure of documents that Kallinen requested\n7\n Nor can a party use the TDJA to seek the same relief afforded under another cause of\naction merely in an effort to obtain recovery of otherwise impermissible attorney fees. See\nMBM Fin. Corp. v. Woodlands Operating Co., 292 S.W.3d 660, 669 (Tex. 2009); see also City of\nHouston v. Texan Land & Cattle Co., 138 S.W.3d 382, 392 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n2004, no pet.).\n\n\n\n\n                                            16\n\ffrom the City. So Appellees’ TDJA claims only seek to resolve issues already\n\npending before the trial court through their TPIA claims and raise no new or\n\ndifferent controversies. Appellees allege duplicative TDJA claims merely in an\n\neffort to obtain attorney fees, under the permissive TDJA standard, that are\n\notherwise unrecoverable under the TPIA here. Allowing Appellees to recover\n\nattorney fees under the TDJA when they cannot meet the requirements for fee\n\nrecovery under the TPIA would frustrate the limits established by the TPIA.\n\nSee Jackson, 351 S.W.3d at 300. Appellees’ TDJA claims are therefore also\n\nbarred by immunity because they seek relief that is redundant and duplicative\n\nof the relief that they seek through their TPIA claims.\n\n\n            2.    Appellees’ TPIA mandamus claims are also barred by\n                  immunity because the TPIA does not waive the City’s\n                  immunity and the only proper defendant for such claims is\n                  the pertinent public information officer.\n\n      The TPIA does not waive immunity for Appellees’ TPIA mandamus\n\nclaims against the City under section 552.321(a)—it authorizes such claims\n\nonly against the pertinent City official. The TPIA requires an “officer for\n\npublic information of a governmental body” to produce public information for\n\ninspection and/or duplication on application by any person to the officer. See\n\nTex. Gov’t Code § 552.221(a). It also authorizes a “requestor” to file suit for a\n\n\n\n\n                                       17\n\fwrit of mandamus compelling “a governmental body” to make information\n\navailable for public inspection. See Tex. Gov’t Code § 552.321(a).8\n\n      The Texas Supreme Court reconciled these provisions and held that the\n\nonly “proper party” against whom mandamus may be sought under Section\n\n552.321(a) is the officer for public information rather than the governmental\n\nbody. See A & T Consultants, Inc. v. Sharp, 904 S.W.2d 668, 672-73, 681 (Tex.\n\n1995). The Court based its conclusion on the duty that the public information\n\nofficer has to make public information available under Sections 552.203 and\n\n552.221(a). Id. In addition, the Fourteenth Court of Appeals followed Sharp\n\nand reversed a summary judgment disposing of a mandamus suit filed against\n\na county sheriff in his official capacity. See Guthrie v. Garcia, 352 S.W.3d 307,\n\n308-10 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2011, no pet.).\n\n      The Guthrie Court also relied on the Texas Supreme Court decision in\n\nHeinrich regarding the ultra vires exception to governmental immunity based on\n\nthe distinction between suits against a governmental entity and those against a\n\npublic official in his official capacity. See Guthrie, 352 S.W.3d at 309\n\n(discussing City of El Paso v. Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d 366, 372-76 (Tex. 2009)). The\n\nHeinrich court explained as follows:\n\n8\n The TPIA defines a “requestor” as “a person who submits a request to a governmental\nbody for inspection or copies of public information.” See Tex. Gov’t Code § 552.003(6).\n\n\n\n\n                                          18\n\f     From this rationale, it is clear that suits to require state officials to\n     comply with statutory or constitutional provisions are not\n     prohibited by sovereign immunity, even if a declaration to that\n     effect compels the payment of money. To fall within this ultra vires\n     exception, a suit must not complain of a government officer’s\n     exercise of discretion, but rather must allege, and ultimately prove,\n     that the officer acted without legal authority or failed to perform a\n     purely ministerial act. Thus, ultra vires suits do not attempt to exert\n     control over the state—they attempt to reassert the control of the\n     state. Stated another way, these suits do not seek to alter\n     government policy but rather to enforce existing policy.\n\nHeinrich, 284 S.W.3d at 372. The Guthrie court therefore held that the\n\nrequestor’s mandamus suit against the county sheriff in his official capacity\n\nwas proper under Section 552.321(a) because any claim against the county for\n\nmandamus relief would necessarily have failed as a matter of law. See Guthrie,\n\n352 S.W.3d at 309-10.\n\n     In this case, Appellees filed their TPIA mandamus claims under Section\n\n552.321(a) only against the City. They did not file those claims against the\n\nCity’s public information officer for the withheld information. So Appellees\n\ndid not file suit against the only proper party against whom mandamus relief\n\nmay be sought under Section 552.321(a), and the City is therefore immune\n\nfrom Appellees’ TPIA mandamus claims under Section 552.321(a).\n\n\n\n\n                                        19\n\f            3.     Appellees’ TDJA claims are likewise barred by immunity\n                   because the TDJA also does not waive the City’s\n                   immunity and the only proper defendant for such claims is\n                   the pertinent public information officer.\n\n      The TDJA also does not waive immunity for Appellees’ TDJA claims\n\nagainst the City—and, just like the TPIA, only authorizes such claims against\n\nthe pertinent City official. As outlined above, the Heinrich Court explained the\n\nultra vires exception to immunity based on the distinction between suits against\n\na governmental entity and those against public officials in their official\n\ncapacities. See Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d at 372-76; see also Guthrie, 352 S.W.3d at\n\n309. But Heinrich also confirmed that a plaintiff may not bring declaratory\n\njudgment actions against a governmental entity to determine rights under a\n\nparticular statute. See Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d at 372-73; see also Tex. Dep’t of State\n\nHealth Servs. v. Holmes, 294 S.W.3d 328, 335 (Tex. App.—Austin 2009, pet.\n\ndenied). Rather, plaintiffs are limited to bringing ultra vires suits against\n\ngovernmental officials in their official capacities. See Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d at\n\n372-73; Holmes, 294 S.W.3d at 335. So as a technical matter, governmental\n\nentities—as opposed to their officers in their official capacities—remain\n\nimmune from suit. See Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d at 372-73.\n\n      In this case, like their TPIA claims, Appellees also filed their TDJA\n\nclaims only against the City. They did not file those claims against the\n\n\n\n                                        20\n\fpertinent City official in his or her official capacity. So Appellees did not file\n\nsuit against the only proper party against whom declaratory relief may be\n\nsought under the TDJA, and the City is therefore also immune from\n\nAppellees’ TDJA claims.\n\n\n            4.    As a result, the trial court also had no subject-matter\n                  jurisdiction because all Appellees’ claims are barred by\n                  immunity.\n\n      Sovereign and governmental immunity protect the State and its political\n\nsubdivisions, including municipalities, from suit and liability unless such\n\nimmunity is waived. See Mission Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Garcia, 253 S.W.3d\n\n653, 655 & n.2 (Tex. 2008); Reata Const. Corp. v. City of Dallas, 197 S.W.3d 371,\n\n374 (Tex. 2006). Courts interpret waivers of immunity narrowly because the\n\nintent to waive must be clear and unambiguous. See Garcia, 253 S.W.3d at 655;\n\nReata Const. Corp., 197 S.W.3d at 375; Tex. Gov’t Code § 311.034. The party\n\nsuing the governmental entity has the burden to both plead and prove consent\n\nto suit under a clear and unambiguous constitutional or statutory waiver of\n\nthat immunity. See Tex. Natural Res. Conservation Comm’n v. IT-Davy, 74 S.W.3d\n\n849, 853-55 (Tex. 2002); Tex. Dep’t of Transp. v. Jones, 8 S.W.3d 636, 638 (Tex.\n\n1999). Immunity from suit defeats subject-matter jurisdiction. See Reata Const.\n\nCorp., 197 S.W.3d at 374; IT-Davy, 74 S.W.3d at 855.\n\n\n\n                                       21\n\f      The trial court therefore had no jurisdiction because all Appellees’ claims\n\nare barred by immunity for several reasons: (1) their TDJA claims are barred\n\nbecause they are redundant and duplicative of their TPIA claims, (2) their\n\nTPIA mandamus claims are barred because the TPIA does not waive\n\nimmunity and the only proper defendant for such claims is the pertinent public\n\ninformation officer, and (3) their TDJA claims are barred by immunity because\n\nthe TDJA also does not waive immunity and the only proper defendant for\n\nsuch claims is the pertinent public information officer.\n\n\nII.   The trial court erred by awarding attorney fees to Appellees because\n      there was no evidence or insufficient evidence to support any award of\n      fees to them.\n\n      A.    Kallinen was not entitled to any award of attorney fees because\n            he did not actually incur any attorney fees—as Kubosh incurred\n            all the claimed fees.\n\n      Even if the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction (which the City\n\ndenies), Kallinen was not entitled to any attorney fee award because he did not\n\nactually incur any fees. As noted above, the TPIA requires the trial court to\n\nassess costs of litigation and reasonable attorney fees in a mandamus suit\n\nunder Section 552.321—but may only award costs and fees that are actually\n\nincurred by a plaintiff who substantially prevails. See Tex. Gov’t Code\n\n§ 552.323(a). The Texas Supreme Court has confirmed that attorney fees are\n\nincurred only where a party becomes liable for them and that a fee award\n\n                                       22\n\funder Section 552.323(a) or the TDJA is proper only where the fees are\n\nactually incurred. See Jackson, 351 S.W.3d at 299-301 (holding that licensed\n\nattorney was not entitled to recover attorney fees under TPIA because he did\n\nnot incur attorney fees since he represented himself or under TDJA because his\n\ndeclaratory relief claim was merely incidental to his TPIA claim).\n\n       In this case, the evidence presented at the trial court hearing on attorney\n\nfees, including all billing invoices that Appellees’ counsel submitted for\n\nrepresentation of Appellees in this case, conclusively establishes that only\n\nKubosh incurred all the claimed fees allegedly incurred in connection with the\n\nTPIA requests for information that only Kallinen submitted to the City.\n\nAppellees’ counsel submitted all billing invoices only to Kubosh—and did not\n\nsubmit any billing invoices to Kallinen. RR[1] Ex. 2. Kallinen offered no\n\nevidence that he incurred any of the claimed fees. RR[1] Ex. 2. Kallinen was\n\ntherefore not entitled to any award of attorney fees because he did not actually\n\nincur any attorney fees—as Kubosh incurred all the claimed fees.9\n\n\n9\n  To the extent that Appellees challenge the trial court’s dismissal of Kubosh due to lack of\nstanding, the attorney fee award under the court’s original final judgment was nonetheless\nerroneous. First, for the reasons outlined above (which are incorporated here for all\npurposes), Kubosh was not entitled to any fee award because his TPIA mandamus and\nattorney fee claims were not justiciable. Second, for the same reasons that Kubosh was not\nentitled to any fee award, the fee award to Appellees jointly was erroneous and could not\nstand because Kallinen was not entitled to any fees that Kubosh was not entitled to recover\n—and Appellees failed to segregate the fees that each allegedly incurred.\n\n\n\n\n                                             23\n\f      B.    Appellees were not entitled to any award of attorney fees\n            because they failed to properly segregate recoverable (alleged)\n            fees from non-recoverable (alleged) fees.\n\n      Even if Kallinen incurred any fees (which the City denies), neither\n\nAppellee was entitled to any award of attorney fees because each failed to\n\nproperly segregate recoverable (alleged) fees from non-recoverable (alleged)\n\nfees. The Texas Supreme Court has confirmed that where attorney fees relate\n\nto a claim for which fees are not recoverable, a claimant must segregate\n\nrecoverable from unrecoverable fees. See Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212\n\nS.W.3d 299, 313 (Tex. 2006). Intertwined facts do not make fees recoverable;\n\nit is only when discrete legal services advance both a recoverable and\n\nunrecoverable claim that they are so intertwined that they need not be\n\nsegregated. See Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at 313-14; see also Rapid Settlements, Ltd. v.\n\nSettlement Funding, LLC, 358 S.W.3d 777, 787 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th\n\nDist.] 2012, no pet.) (citing Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at 313-14).\n\n      In this case, as noted above, Appellees’ counsel failed to segregate any\n\nattorney fees incurred with regard to documents that the trial court ordered the\n\nCity to disclose from any incurred with regard to documents that the City\n\nultimately disclosed to Appellees voluntarily. RR[1] Ex. 2. Appellees’ counsel\n\nalso failed to segregate any attorney fees incurred by Kubosh from any\n\nincurred by Kallinen. RR[1] Ex. 2. But such segregation as to Kubosh and\n\n\n                                       24\n\fKallinen is critical to determining the amount of fees to which each may be\n\nentitled. It is particularly critical to ensuring that neither is awarded any\n\nattorney fees incurred only by Kubosh—who, as outlined above, lacks standing\n\nnot only for the same reasons why Kallinen lacks standing, but also for the\n\nadditional reason that he never actually submitted any TPIA request to the\n\nCity and therefore is not even a requestor authorized to file suit for mandamus\n\nrelief under Section 552.321(a). Appellees were therefore not entitled to any\n\naward of attorney fees because they failed to properly segregate recoverable\n\n(alleged) fees from non-recoverable (alleged) fees.10\n\n\n       C.     Appellees offered no evidence or insufficient evidence to support\n              the amount of the award of attorney fees.\n\n       In the alternative, and subject to the City’s arguments on lack of\n\njurisdiction (including that Kallinen is not a prevailing party for purposes of\n\nTPIA fee recovery), Appellees also failed to offer any evidence or any\n\nsufficient evidence to support any fee award. As noted above, the TPIA\n\nauthorizes the court to assess reasonable attorney fees incurred by a plaintiff\n\nwho substantially prevails in a mandamus suit under Section 552.321(a). See\n\n\n10\n  Although Appellees did segregate fees to a limited (and insufficient) extent after the trial\ncourt’s original final judgment, they failed to properly segregate fees separately incurred by\neach of them.\n\n\n\n\n                                             25\n\fTex. Gov’t Code § 552.323(a). In this case, Appellees offered no evidence or\n\ninsufficient evidence to establish that any attorney fees they allegedly incurred\n\nwere reasonable. The City’s attorney fee expert, Patrick Zummo, testified at\n\nthe attorney fee hearing in the trial court that Appellees’ claimed attorney fees\n\nwere not reasonable or proper for multiple reasons.\n\n      Mr. Zummo explained that Appellees’ counsel did not exercise\n\nappropriate billing judgment. RR[1].122, 134-35, 139, 1144. Mr. Zummo’s\n\ntestimony also confirms that Appellees’ evidence cannot support their burden\n\nto prove that the claimed attorney fees were reasonable because:\n\n   1. The billing invoices included many single entries for total time allegedly\n      expended in a single day instead of multiple daily entries broken down\n      for discrete individual tasks. RR[1].128-29, 141-43, 149, 182.\n\n   2. Many task descriptions were too generic which precluded any\n      independent assessment of the reasonableness of the stated time\n      amounts. RR[1].132, 133, 147.\n\n   3. Many task descriptions were redacted which also precluded independent\n      assessment of the reasonableness of the stated time amounts. RR[1].121,\n      130, 133, 149, 151, .\n\n   4. Tasks relating to the deliberative process privilege and attorney-client\n      privilege on which the City relied were not segregated even though they\n      could have been segregated for the most part. RR[1].148-49, 152-54.\n\n   5. The billing invoices included amounts for extensive research on legal\n      issues of Appellees’ counsel touted expertise. RR[1].132, 156-57.\n\n   6. The billing invoices included amounts for numerous attorney-client\n      conferences to discuss “strategy” despite the fact that strategy had not\n\n\n                                       26\n\f      significantly changed and that Appellees are lawyers. RR[1].132-33, 141-\n      42, 147-48, 150, 151, 180, .\n\n   7. The billing invoices included amounts for unproductive speculation and\n      investigation regarding whether Professor Robert Stein of Rice\n      University allowed an alleged employment relationship between his wife\n      and staff of the Mayor of the City of Houston to influence his research,\n      analysis and opinions. RR[1].146-47.\n\n   8. The billing invoices included amounts for excessive time spent reviewing\n      the City’s documents and performing other tasks. RR[1].136-44, 151.\n\nMr. Zummo’s testimony therefore raised numerous fact issues regarding\n\nwhether Appellees satisfied their burden to prove that the claimed attorney fees\n\nwere reasonable.\n\n      Mr. Zummo testified that the foregoing issues with Appellees’ claimed\n\nattorney fees required reduction of about $21,440.00 (based upon 67 hours at\n\n$320 per hour). RR[1].151-52. Mr. Zummo also testified that, based on the\n\ncount of the documents subject to the trial court’s rulings, Appellees were not\n\nsuccessful in their attempt to obtain 25% of the documents they sought—\n\nreflecting the total percentage of withheld document for which the City\n\nclaimed the attorney-client privilege. RR[1].153-55. Mr. Zummo determined\n\nthat, even after deduction of $21,440 as stated above, the remaining amount\n\nshould be further reduced accordingly to a percentage reflecting only the total\n\npercentage of withheld documents that the trial court ordered the City to\n\n\n\n\n                                      27\n\fdisclose. RR[1].153-55. Mr. Zummo’s testimony therefore also confirms that\n\nthe amount of attorney fees awarded was excessive.\n\n\nIII.   The trial court also had no subject-matter jurisdiction over Kubosh’s\n       claims; Kubosh’s TPIA mandamus and attorney fee claims were never\n       justiciable due to lack of ripeness and standing because he never\n       submitted any TPIA request to the City.\n\n       The trial court also had no subject-matter jurisdiction over Kubosh’s\n\nTPIA mandamus and attorney fee claims due to lack of ripeness and standing.\n\nAs noted above, the TPIA authorizes a “requestor” to file suit for a writ of\n\nmandamus compelling a governmental body to make information available for\n\npublic inspection—and defines a “requestor” as “a person who submits a\n\nrequest to a governmental body for inspection or copies of public information.”\n\nSee Tex. Gov’t Code §§ 552.321(a), 552.003(6). The plain language of Section\n\n552.321 therefore only authorizes a person who submits a request for\n\ninformation to a governmental body to file suit for a writ of mandamus. In this\n\ncase, it is undisputed that Kubosh never actually submitted any request for\n\ninformation to the City before filing his TPIA claims against the City—despite\n\ntheir lack of ripeness and his lack of standing. The trial court therefore had no\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction over Kubosh’s TPIA mandamus and attorney fee\n\nclaims under Sections 552.321(a) and Section 552.323 because those claims\n\nwere not justiciable due to lack of ripeness and standing.\n\n\n                                       28\n\f                            Conclusion and Prayer\n\n      For these reasons, the City Houston asked this Court to (1) reverse the\n\norder of the trial court denying the City’s plea to the jurisdiction and render\n\njudgment in the City’s favor that all Kallinen’s claims against the City are\n\ndismissed for want of jurisdiction, and (2) reverse the modified final judgment\n\nof the trial court awarding attorney fees to Kallinen and render judgment in the\n\nCity’s favor that Kallinen is not entitled to attorney fees and shall take nothing\n\non any of his claims against the City.\n\n\n\n\n                                         29\n\f                                       Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                       DONNA L.

Randall Kallinen and Paul\n\nKubosh (“appellees”) filed a mandamus suit against the City of Houston (“the\n\nCity”) seeking the public disclosure of various documents requested regarding the\n\fCity’s red light camera installations. After a series of rulings by the trial court, the\n\nCity filed a motion for new trial and plea to the jurisdiction. The trial court denied\n\nthe City’s plea to the jurisdiction. In two issues, the City challenges the trial\n\ncourt’s orders denying its plea to the jurisdiction and awarding attorney’s fees to\n\nappellees. We reverse and render.\n\n                                     Background\n\n      In November and December 2008, Kallinen made four requests under the\n\nTPIA for release of information regarding a commissioned study on traffic light\n\ncameras in Houston. The City released some of the documents but withheld others\n\nbased upon disclosure exceptions under the Act.           The City also requested a\n\ndecision from the Attorney General regarding whether the TPIA exceptions\n\napplied. Before the Attorney General had issued a decision, appellees filed suit in\n\ndistrict court on December 26, 2008, seeking a writ of mandamus under the TPIA.1\n\nAppellees then requested that the Attorney General refrain from making a\n\ndetermination because the issue was a subject of ongoing litigation. The Attorney\n\nGeneral did subsequently decline to issue an opinion in order to allow the trial\n\ncourt to decide whether the withheld documents were excepted from disclosure\n\nunder the TPIA.\n\n\n1\n      Appellees also filed a declaratory judgment under the Texas Declaratory Judgment\n      Act (“TDJA”), seeking a declaration that disclosure was required. See TEX. CIV.\n      PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 37.002(b) (West 2008).\n                                           2\n\f      On September 14, 2009, appellees filed a motion for partial summary\n\njudgment seeking a ruling as to whether the TPIA’s exceptions applied to the\n\nwithheld documents. On October 12, 2009, the trial court granted in part, and\n\ndenied in part, appellees’ summary judgment motion, and ordered the City to\n\ndisclose some of the withheld documents. On November 16, 2009, appellees filed\n\na motion for entry of judgment and award of attorney’s fees and, following a\n\nhearing on appellees’ attorney’s fee claim, the trial court issued a final judgment\n\non October 12, 2011, reiterating its October 12, 2009 ruling and awarding\n\nappellees $95,664 jointly in attorney’s fees.\n\n      On November 10, 2011, the City filed a motion for new trial and plea to the\n\njurisdiction. On January 5, 2012, the trial court granted the City’s motion for new\n\ntrial as to attorney’s fees for Kubosh and denied the City’s plea to the jurisdiction.\n\nOn July 12, 2012, the trial court entered a modified final judgment ruling that\n\nKubosh was without standing and awarding him no attorney’s fees.\n\n                                Standard of Review\n\n      A plea to the jurisdiction challenges the trial court’s subject matter\n\njurisdiction which is essential to the authority of a court to decide a case. See\n\nBland Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Blue, 34 S.W.3d 547, 553–54 (Tex. 2000). A plea\n\nchallenging a trial court’s jurisdiction is a question of law that is reviewed de novo.\n\nSee City of Dallas v. Carbajal, 324 S.W.3d 537, 538 (Tex. 2010).\n\n                                          3\n\f      The construction of a statute, too, is a question of law which is reviewed de\n\nnovo. See Atmos Energy Corp. v. Cities of Allen, 353 S.W.3d 156, 160 (Tex.\n\n2011). The purpose of interpretation is to arrive at the legislature’s intent in\n\ncreating the statute. F.F.P. Operating Partners, L.P. v. Duenez, 237 S.W.3d 680,\n\n683 (Tex. 2007).     In discerning legislative intent, we consider the plain and\n\ncommon meaning of the statutory language. See McIntyre v. Ramirez, 109 S.W.3d\n\n741, 745 (Tex. 2003). The statute must be read as a whole, giving effect to all—\n\nnot just isolated—portions. See City of San Antonio v. City of Boerne, 111 S.W.3d\n\n22, 25 (Tex. 2003). Courts also consider the objective the law seeks to obtain. See\n\nTEX. GOV’T CODE § 311.023(1) (West 2005).\n\n                                    Discussion\n\n      In its first issue, the City contends that the trial court erred in denying its\n\nplea to the jurisdiction because, among other reasons, the Attorney General\n\ndeclined to perform his statutory duty to issue a decision on the City’s request.\n\nAppellees argue that they have a statutory right to file a suit for writ of mandamus\n\nagainst the City because the City refused to release public information.\n\n   A. Applicable Law\n\n      The TPIA governs public disclosure of information about the affairs of the\n\ngovernment and the official acts of public officials and employees, and it requires\n\nthe officer for public information of a governmental body to produce public\n\n                                         4\n\finformation for inspection or copying on application by any person to the officer.\n\nSee TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. §§ 552.001, .203, .221(a) (West 2012). A “requestor”\n\nis defined as “a person who submits a request to a governmental body for\n\ninspection or copies of public information.” Id. § 552.003(6).\n\n      The TPIA also lists numerous exceptions from required disclosure. See id.\n\n§§ 552.101–.153. Though the act is to be liberally construed in favor of granting\n\nrequests for information, id. § 552.001(b), a governmental body may seek to\n\nwithhold requested information that it believes falls within one of the statutory\n\nexceptions to disclosure. See id. §§ 552.101–.153. To do so, the government body\n\nmust timely request an Attorney General determination (if there has not been a\n\nprevious determination) and assert which exceptions to disclosure apply to the\n\ninformation requested. Id. § 552.301. The TPIA provides that “the attorney\n\ngeneral shall promptly render a decision requested . . . determining whether the\n\nrequested information is within one of the exceptions . . . .” Id. § 552.306(a).\n\nHowever, the governmental body may disclose the requested information to the\n\npublic or to the requestor before the Attorney General—or, if suit is filed under the\n\nTPIA, the court with jurisdiction—makes a final determination that the requested\n\ninformation is public, except if the requested information is confidential by law.\n\nSee id. § 552.303(a).\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\f        The TPIA also provides that the Attorney General and the original requestor\n\nmay file suit for a writ of mandamus to compel a governmental body to release\n\ninformation to the public “if the governmental body refuses to request an attorney\n\ngeneral’s decision . . . or refuses to supply public information or information that\n\nthe attorney general has determined is public information.” Id. § 552.32(a). If a\n\ngovernmental body does not request an Attorney General decision after receiving a\n\nwritten request for information, the requested information is presumed to be\n\nsubject to required public disclosure and must be released unless there is a\n\ncompelling reason to withhold it. See id. § 552.302. Further, the TPIA also\n\nprovides that the only exceptions to required disclosure that the governmental body\n\nmay raise in such a suit are those that it properly raised before the Attorney\n\nGeneral to support its request for a decision as to whether disclosure is required.\n\nSee id. § 552.326(a).\n\n        B. Analysis\n\n        The issue before us is whether the TPIA allows a requestor to sue for a writ\n\nof mandamus prior to the Attorney General issuing a decision when the\n\ngovernmental body has requested one. The City contends that the TPIA requires\n\nthe Attorney General to render a decision before a mandamus suit may be filed.\n\nAppellees argue that no such requirement has been or should be read into the\n\nTPIA.\n\n                                          6\n\f      As previously noted, section 552.321(a) sets out three scenarios under which\n\nthe Attorney General or a requestor may file a mandamus suit.               First, if a\n\ngovernmental body fails to request an Attorney General decision in the time\n\npermitted, the information is presumed to be open to public disclosure, and the\n\ngovernmental body must release the information. See id. § 552.321(a). If it fails to\n\ndo so, the requestor may file suit for a writ of mandamus. See id. Second, if the\n\nAttorney General has rendered a decision and the governmental body has failed to\n\ncomply with the decision, the Attorney General or the requestor may then file suit.\n\nSee id. Finally, either the Attorney General or the requestor may file suit, if the\n\ngovernmental body “refuses to supply public information.” Id.\n\n      Appellees argue that the third scenario applies here. That is, they argue that\n\nthe City refused to release public information and they were therefore entitled to\n\nfile a mandamus suit. In support of their argument, appellees point out that the\n\nlegislature did not qualify the word “refuse” by including exceptions for cases in\n\nwhich the government body has requested an Attorney General ruling. 2 That\n\n2\n      Appellees rely on Thomas v. Cornyn, 71 S.W.3d 473, 486 (Tex. App.—Austin\n      2002, no pet.) (noting that mandamus statute “does not qualify the word ‘refuse’\n      by including an exception for cases in which the governing body has filed a suit\n      against the attorney general under the Act, and we will not read such an exception\n      into the statute.”). That reliance is misplaced. In Thomas, the Attorney General\n      had already rendered a decision on the nature of the information. According to\n      section 552.324(a)(2), a governmental body may sue for declaratory relief from\n      compliance with an already issued decision by the Attorney General. The Thomas\n      court correctly determined that the suit for writ of mandamus filed after the\n      Attorney General decision and before the suit for declaratory relief had been\n                                          7\n\freading, however, is unpersuasive. Though the term “refuse” is not qualified, the\n\nterm “information” is. See id. § 552.321(a) (permitting suit for writ of mandamus\n\nwhere “governmental body refuses to supply public information”) (emphasis\n\nadded). Because the TPIA carves out numerous exceptions to disclosure of certain\n\ntypes of information and establishes procedures to determine whether information\n\nfalls under those exceptions, it is illogical to presume that information is public\n\nwhile its very status is being challenged. Additionally, considering that the statute\n\nexplicitly states when information is presumed to be public—i.e., if the\n\ngovernmental body has not made an Attorney General request—it does not stand to\n\nreason that information should be considered public when a request has been made.\n\n      Not only does the statute clearly provide when a mandamus suit may be\n\nfiled, but it is equally clear that the Attorney General must render a decision on the\n\nnature of the information in question. The City contends that the TPIA is a\n\ncomprehensive regulatory scheme under which the Attorney General must issue a\n\ndecision before a mandamus suit may be filed.3 It argues that because the Attorney\n\n\n      decided was a valid one, pointing to the relevant provision in 552.325(a) allowing\n      a requestor to intervene in such suits. The language that appellees cite from\n      Thomas is clearly applicable only to fact patterns involving governmental bodies’\n      suits against the Attorney General, not for suits for writ of mandamus prior to an\n      Attorney General ruling.\n3\n      An agency has exclusive jurisdiction when it is clear that the legislature instituted\n      a pervasive regulatory scheme meant to be the exclusive means of remedying\n      certain problems targeted by the legislation. See Subaru of America, Inc. v. David\n      McDavid Nissan, Inc., 84 S.W.3d 212, 221 (Tex. 2002). If an agency has\n                                            8\n\fGeneral did not issue a decision in this case before appellees filed their suit, the\n\njurisdictional prerequisite for filing suit under section 552.321 was not met.\n\nAppellees, citing past Attorney General decisions, contend that the Attorney\n\nGeneral may—indeed, must in this case—defer to courts’ decisions when certain\n\nissues are being litigated.\n\n      The Attorney General, however, has already weighed in on this debate:\n\nOpen Records Decision No. 687 concludes that “in accordance with its\n\nlegislatively[] mandated function, the Attorney General has a statutory directive to\n\nrule on a PIA disclosure question in the first instance in advance of judicial\n\nreview.” Tex. Att’y Gen. OR2011-687. After acknowledging the previous agency\n\ndecisions cited by appellees in which the agency had declined to issue an opinion\n\nwhen that same question was pending before a court, the Attorney General ruled\n\nthat “this litigation policy is withdrawn and is no longer applicable to the PIA\n\nruling process.” Id.\n\n      This decision is significant in several ways. First, it notes that the Attorney\n\nGeneral may not refuse to fulfill his duty to render open records decisions. See\n\nHous. Chronicle Publ’g Co. v. Mattox, 767 S.W.2d 695, 698 (Tex. 1989). Second,\n\n      exclusive jurisdiction, a party must exhaust all administrative avenues before\n      asking for judicial review of the agency’s action. Cash Am. Int’l Inc. v. Bennett,\n      35 S.W.3d 12, 15 (Tex. 1999). Otherwise, a trial court lacks subject matter\n      jurisdiction and must dismiss the claims within the agency’s exclusive jurisdiction.\n      See Tex. Educ. Agency v. Cypress-Fairbanks Indep. Sch. Dist., 830 S.W.2d 88, 90\n      (Tex. 1992).\n\n                                           9\n\fit points out the 1999 revisions to the TPIA, which expanded the scope of the\n\nAttorney General’s role. In particular, the decision highlights the addition of\n\nsection 552.011, which charges the Attorney General with “maintain[ing]\n\nuniformity in the application, operation, and interpretation of this chapter.” The\n\ndecision then concludes that the detailed statutory scheme under which the\n\nAttorney General’s open records ruling process operates, as well as the lack of any\n\nlanguage affirmatively directing the Attorney General to decline to issue an open\n\nrecords ruling for the benefit of the public, demonstrate that such Attorney General\n\ndecisions are, indeed, mandatory. Finally, Open Records Decision No. 687 offers\n\ninsights into the policy considerations underpinning the Attorney General’s\n\nexpanded role under the statute. Vesting the Attorney General with the role of\n\nevaluating requests by governmental bodies to withhold putatively excepted\n\ninformation is both more efficient, avoiding the expense of court action, and more\n\ndemocratic, allowing Texans equal access to information regardless of their ability\n\nto secure legal representation. The decision concludes by stating that “there is\n\nlittle to commend a rule that would avoid ruling on a pending question where the\n\nAttorney General has not previously spoken.” Tex. Att’y Gen. OR2011-687.\n\n\n\n\n                                        10\n\f      We agree with the Attorney General’s interpretation. 4          The TPIA is a\n\ncomprehensive statutory scheme under which “the Attorney General [is] the first\n\narbiter of openness before Texans can be denied access to their government’s\n\nrecords.”   See Tex. Att’y Gen. OR2011-687 (noting that, in enacting TPIA,\n\nlegislature “set[] out a detailed statutory scheme . . . which . . . evidences [its]\n\nintention that the Attorney General play a critical, quasi-judicial role when a\n\ngovernmental body wishes to avoid releasing information requested pursuant to the\n\nPIA.”); see also Tex. Dep’t of Pub. Safety v. Cox Tex. Newspapers, L.P., 343\n\nS.W.3d 112, 121 (Tex. 2011) (Wainwright, J., concurring) (describing TPIA as\n\n“comprehensive scheme arming the public with statutory mandates for the\n\ngovernment to disclose information . . . .”). Although district courts have subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction under the TPIA, that jurisdiction only arises after the Attorney\n\nGeneral has ruled. See TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 552.321(a).\n\n      Appellees filed suit for writ of mandamus before the Attorney General\n\nissued a ruling on the information that the City sought to withhold. Because\n\n\n4\n      Although not binding authority on appellate courts, we give due consideration to\n      the Attorney General on questions involving the TPIA. See Holmes v. Morales,\n      924 S.W.2d 920, 924 (Tex. 1996) (explaining that Attorney General opinions are\n      “persuasive but not controlling” authority); City of Lubbock v. Cornyn, 993\n      S.W.2d 461, 463 (Tex. App.—Austin 1999, no pet.) (recognizing due\n      consideration to be given Attorney General decisions especially in cases involving\n      TPIA); City of Hous. v. Hous.

Dep’t Pub. Safety v.\n\nCox Tex. Newspapers, L.P., 343 S.W.3d 112, 114 (Tex. 2011). The PIA provides that when a\n\ngovernmental body receives a written request for information for which it wishes to claim an\n\nexception, it must timely seek a ruling from the Attorney General if the exception’s applicability to\n\nthe requested information has not previously been determined. TEX . GOV ’T CODE § 552.301(a); see\n\nalso id. § 552.301(g). But the PIA also provides that a requestor may sue to compel disclosure of\n\nthe information. TEX . GOV ’T CODE § 552.321(a). In this case, the court of appeals held that a trial\n\ncourt lacks subject matter jurisdiction over such a suit until the Attorney General rules. 414 S.W.3d\n\n815, 820 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2013). We disagree.\n\f       Invoking the PIA, Randall Kallinen requested information from the City of Houston\n\nregarding a study of traffic light cameras it had commissioned. The City produced a large number\n\nof documents but withheld some and timely asked the Attorney General for an opinion on whether\n\nthe PIA excepted the withheld information from disclosure. The PIA gives the Attorney General\n\nforty-five business days to issue opinions, though the time can be extended. TEX . GOV ’T CODE\n\n§ 552.306(a). But before this time elapsed and before the Attorney General ruled, Kallinen sued for\n\na writ of mandamus to compel the City to disclose the withheld information. The City moved to\n\nabate the lawsuit pending the Attorney General’s ruling, but the Attorney General closed his file\n\nwhen he was alerted to the suit. At the time, the Attorney General did not interpret the PIA to\n\nrequire an open records ruling on issues already in litigation. See Tex. Att’y Gen. OR2011-687\n\n(citing Tex. Att’y Gen. OR1990-560 at 3 (declining to rule on sensitive information on the ground\n\nthe issues should be resolved in the pending Texas prison litigation), and A & T Consultants, Inc.\n\nv. Sharp, 904 S.W.2d 668, 671 (Tex. 1995) (noting in dicta that the Attorney General withdrew his\n\nopinion pending litigation on PIA questions)).\n\n       The City filed a plea to the jurisdiction, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction over the suit\n\nuntil the Attorney General ruled. The district court overruled the plea, granted summary judgment\n\nfor Kallinen, ordered disclosure of many of the withheld documents, and awarded Kallinen $175,664\n\nin attorney fees through appeal to this Court.\n\n       The City complied with the order to disclose but appealed the attorney fee award. The parties\n\nagree that the only basis for the trial court’s jurisdiction is Section 552.321(a) of the PIA. That\n\n\n\n                                                   2\n\fprovision, with subsections inserted in brackets for ease of reference, conditions the court’s exercise\n\nof jurisdiction as follows:\n\n                A requestor or the attorney general may file suit for a writ of mandamus\n       compelling a governmental body to make information available for public inspection\n       if the governmental body [A] refuses to request an attorney general’s decision . . . or\n       [B] refuses to supply [1] public information or [2] information that the attorney\n       general has determined is public information that is not excepted from disclosure.\n\nTEX . GOV ’T CODE § 552.321(a). The parties agree that conditions A and B2 do not apply. The court\n\nof appeals reasoned that condition B1 cannot apply when the governmental body is challenging\n\nwhether an exception to disclosure applies because the information has not yet been determined to\n\nbe public. 414 S.W.3d at 818. Accepting the City’s argument, the court stated that the Attorney\n\nGeneral must determine whether information is subject to disclosure when asked to do so, that he\n\nhas exclusive jurisdiction to make that determination in the first instance, that the requestor of\n\ninformation must exhaust all administrative remedies before suing, and that therefore a trial court’s\n\njurisdiction over a requestor’s suit “only arises after the Attorney General has ruled.” Id. at 818–20.\n\n       The City’s position is flawed in several respects. First, it equates information that is public\n\nwith information that has been determined by the Attorney General to be public, so that condition\n\nB2 swallows up condition B1. This violates a duty of statutory interpretation to “give effect to all\n\nthe words of a statute and not treat any statutory language as surplusage if possible.” Chevron Corp.\n\nv. Redmon, 745 S.W.2d 314, 316 (Tex. 1987).\n\n       Further, the City’s view of Section 552.321(a) would relegate mandamus relief to compelling\n\na governmental body to request an Attorney General’s decision and then comply with it. The\n\ncorrectness of that decision would be unreviewable. But we have reviewed the Attorney General’s\n\n                                                  3\n\frulings. See Cox Tex. Newspapers, L.P., 343 S.W.3d at 113; In re City of Georgetown, 53 S.W.3d\n\n328, 329–36 (Tex. 2001). And we have interpreted PIA exceptions without a ruling by the Attorney\n\nGeneral. See City of Garland v. Dall. Morning News, 22 S.W.3d 351, 358–64 (Tex. 2000); A & T\n\nConsultants, Inc., 904 S.W.2d at 671, 674–81. The court of appeals’ interpretation ignores these\n\ncases.\n\n         The City argues, and the court of appeals held, that requestors of information should be\n\nrequired to exhaust their remedies in placing disputes before the Attorney General before resorting\n\nto the courts. But requestors have no such remedies. While the Attorney General may invite their\n\narguments, they have no right to request or demand a ruling or disclosure from the Attorney General,\n\nand no right to an administrative appeal. See TEX . GOV ’T CODE § 552.304. Requestors cannot be\n\nrequired to finish something they have no right to start. The requirement that a governmental body\n\nseek a ruling from the Attorney General when withholding requested information is a check on the\n\ngovernmental body, not a remedy for the requestor to exhaust. And again, the City’s view of Section\n\n552.321(a) would make the Attorney General’s ruling unreviewable.\n\n         The City argues that because information is generally “presumed to be subject to required\n\npublic disclosure” when a governmental body fails to timely request an Attorney General’s ruling,\n\nTEX . GOV ’T CODE § 552.302, the information should not be considered public when a ruling is\n\nrequested. But the premise cannot establish its converse. One may infer from a governmental\n\nbody’s failure to request a ruling that the body is not claiming an exclusion, else it would advance\n\nits position in compliance with prescribed procedures. See TEX . GOV ’T CODE § 552.301. One\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fcannot likewise infer that just because a governmental body properly seeks an Attorney General’s\n\nruling, its exclusion claim must be correct.\n\n       The Attorney General advises in an amicus brief that he does not claim exclusive jurisdiction\n\nto decide open records issues. Consistent with that position, at the time of the City’s request for a\n\nruling, as noted above, the Attorney General’s policy was not to rule on issues in litigation. See Tex.\n\nAtt’y Gen. OR2011-687. In reversing that policy, he does not claim the authority to rule without\n\ncourt review.\n\n       A requestor of information certainly has the choice to await the Attorney General’s decision.\n\nA governmental body may decide to release the requested information during the process and on\n\nreceipt of an adverse opinion from the Attorney General. Efficiency may counsel patience. But the\n\ngovernmental body is entitled to insist on its position to a final ruling, see TEX . GOV ’T CODE\n\n§ 552.324, and a requestor is not required to defer a suit for mandamus.\n\n       A court may decide, exercising sound discretion, to abate proceedings to await the Attorney\n\nGeneral’s ruling. The Attorney General characterizes its authority as akin to primary jurisdiction,\n\na prudential doctrine that applies when an agency is “staffed with experts trained in handling the\n\ncomplex problems in the agency’s purview” and there is a benefit to be “derived from [the] agency[]\n\nuniformly interpreting its laws, rules, and regulations.” Subaru of Am., Inc. v. David McDavid\n\nNissan, Inc., 84 S.W.3d 212, 221 (Tex. 2002). The Legislature has expressly charged the Attorney\n\nGeneral with maintaining “uniformity in the application, operation, and interpretation” of the PIA,\n\nTEX . GOV ’T CODE § 552.011, and the Office of the Attorney General is experienced in interpreting\n\nand applying the subchapter C exceptions. If the court determines that under the circumstances of\n\n                                                  5\n\fa particular case a decision from the Attorney General before adjudication of the merits of disclosure\n\nwould be beneficial and any delay would not impinge on a requestor’s right to information,\n\nabatement would be within the court’s discretion.\n\n       The court of appeals erred in dismissing Kallinen’s suit for want of jurisdiction.\n\nAccordingly, we grant the petition for review and, without hearing oral argument, reverse the court\n\nof appeals’ judgment and remand to that court for further proceedings in accordance with this\n\nopinion.

The trial court erred by denying the City’s plea and otherwise had\n        no subject-matter jurisdiction over Appellees’ claims. ......................... 11\n\n        A.      The trial court had no subject-matter jurisdiction because\n                Appellees’ TPIA mandamus and attorney fee claims were\n                not justiciable. ......................................................................... 11\n\n                1.       Appellees’ TPIA mandamus and attorney fee claims\n                         were no longer justiciable at the time of final judgment\n                         because they were mooted when the City, prior to\n                         final judgment, produced all withheld documents that\n                         the trial court ordered the City to disclose. ....................... 11\n\n                2.       As a result, the trial court had no subject-matter\n                         jurisdiction because Appellees’ TPIA mandamus and\n                         attorney fee claims were not justiciable at the time of\n                         final judgment. ............................................................... 13\n\n        B.      The trial court also had no subject-matter jurisdiction\n                because all Appellees’ claims are barred by immunity. ............... 15\n\n                1.       Appellees’ TDJA claims are barred by immunity\n                         because they are redundant and duplicative of their\n                         TPIA claims. .................................................................. 15\n\n                2.       Appellees’ TPIA mandamus claims are also barred by\n                         immunity because the TPIA does not waive the City’s\n                         immunity and the only proper defendant for such\n                         claims is the pertinent public information officer. ............. 17\n\n                3.       Appellees’ TDJA claims are likewise barred by\n                         immunity because the TDJA also does not waive the\n                         City’s immunity and the only proper defendant for\n                         such claims is the pertinent public information officer. ..... 20\n                4.       As a result, the trial court also had no subject-matter\n                         jurisdiction because all Appellees’ claims are barred by\n                         immunity. ...................................................................... 21\n\n\n                                                     iv\n\fII.        The trial court erred by awarding attorney fees to Appellees\n           because there was no evidence or insufficient evidence to support\n           any award of fees to them. ................................................................. 22\n\n           A.      Kallinen was not entitled to any award of attorney fees\n                   because he did not actually incur any attorney fees—as\n                   Kubosh incurred all the claimed fees. ........................................ 22\n\n           B.      Appellees were not entitled to any award of attorney fees\n                   because they failed to properly segregate recoverable\n                   (alleged) fees from non-recoverable (alleged) fees. ..................... 24\n\n           C.      Appellees offered no evidence or insufficient evidence to\n                   support the amount of the award of attorney fees. ..................... 25\nIII.       The trial court also had no subject-matter jurisdiction over\n           Kubosh’s claims; Kubosh’s TPIA mandamus and attorney fee\n           claims were never justiciable due to lack of ripeness and standing\n           because he never submitted any TPIA request to the City. .................. 28\n\nConclusion and Prayer ............................................................................... 29\n\nCertificate of Compliance ........................................................................... 30\n\nCertificate of Service .................................................................................. 31\n\nAppendix\n\n      A.

Const. art. XI, § 5. In accordance with\nSection 9.008(b) of the Texas Local Government Code, the City respectfully requests this\nCourt to take judicial notice of its published charter and status thereunder as a home-rule\ncity. See Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code § 9.008(b).\n2\n  In its original brief in this appeal (prior to the Supreme Court’s ruling), the City addressed\nissues relating to the trial court’s original final judgment in an abundance of caution given\nthat it did learn that the trial court entered a modified final judgment until the day it filed its\noriginal appeal brief. Although the modified final judgment is at issue here, the City\naddresses issues relating to Kubosh also in an abundance of caution in the event that this\nCourt’s September 3, 2015 order (App. J) allowing supplemental briefing by the parties does\nnot contemplate the filing of a responsive brief by the City to Appellees’ supplemental brief.\nIn addition, for the same reason, to the extent that any of the City’s arguments as to\nKallinen also apply to Kubosh, the City addresses those arguments as to Appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                                                xi\n\fTrial court disposition:     On July 12, 2012, the trial court entered a modified\n                             final judgment dismissing Kubosh due to lack of\n                             standing and awarding attorney fees only to\n                             Kallinen.

App. J.\n\n\n                      Statement Regarding Oral Argument\n\n      The City respectfully requests that the Court hear oral argument in this\n\nappeal to allow the parties an opportunity to simplify and focus the issues for\n\nthe Court’s consideration.\n\n\n                                  Issues Presented\n\n      The trial court erred in denying the City’s plea to the jurisdiction and\n\nmotion for new trial for the following reasons:\n\n\n\n                                         xii\n\f1.   The trial court had no subject-matter jurisdiction over\n     Appellees’ claims.\n\n     a. The trial court had no subject-matter jurisdiction over\n        Appellees’ TPIA mandamus and attorney fee claims because\n        they were no longer justiciable at the time of final judgment;\n        they were mooted when the City, prior to final judgment,\n        produced to Kallinen all withheld documents that the trial\n        court ordered the City to disclose.\n\n     b. The trial court also had no subject-matter jurisdiction\n        because all Appellees’ claims are barred by immunity.\n\n        i. Appellees’ TDJA claims are barred by immunity because\n           they are redundant and duplicative of their TPIA claims.\n\n       ii. Appellees’ TPIA mandamus claims are also barred by\n           immunity because the TPIA does not waive the City’s\n           immunity and the only proper defendant for such claims\n           is the pertinent public information officer.\n\n      iii. Appellees’ TDJA claims are likewise barred by immunity\n           because the TDJA likewise also does not waive the City’s\n           immunity and the only proper defendant for such claims\n           is the pertinent public information officer.\n\n2.   The trial court erred by awarding attorney fees to Appellees\n     because there was no evidence or insufficient evidence to\n     support any award of fees to them.\n\n     a. Kallinen was not entitled to any award of attorney fees\n        because he did not actually incur any attorney fees—as\n        Kubosh incurred all the claimed fees.\n\n     b. Appellees offered no evidence or insufficient evidence to\n        support the amount of the award of attorney fees.\n\n3.   The trial court also had no subject-matter jurisdiction over\n     Kubosh’s claims; Kubosh’s TPIA mandamus and attorney fee\n     claims were never justiciable due to lack of ripeness and\n\n                                  xiii\n\fstanding because he never submitted any TPIA request to the\nCity.\n\n\n\n\n                          xiv\n\f                               Introduction and Overview\n\n       After the City released most of the documents that Kallinen requested\n\nrelating to the City’s red light traffic camera system under the TPIA, Appellees\n\nsued the City seeking mandamus relief (as well as attorney fees) under the\n\nTPIA to compel disclosure of documents that the City withheld based on\n\nTPIA disclosure exceptions. They filed their suit against the City, not a City\n\nofficial. They also sought redundant and duplicative declaratory relief (as well\n\nas attorney fees) under the TDJA to declare that disclosure is required. Kubosh\n\njoined the suit despite the fact that only Kallinen submitted any TPIA request\n\nto the City.\n\n       In late 2009, the trial court ruled on the TPIA exceptions asserted by the\n\nCity, and the City immediately complied by producing all documents that the\n\ntrial court ruled were not excepted from disclosure. In late 2011, the trial court\n\nentered a final judgment which included an attorney fee award jointly to\n\nAppellees. Later, in mid-2012, after the City filed a motion for new trial and\n\nplea to the jurisdiction, the trial court entered modified final judgment\n\ndismissing Kubosh for lack of standing and awarding attorney fees only to\n\nKallinen.3 But as a result of the City’s production of all documents that the trial\n\n\n3\n In its original brief in this appeal, given that it did not learn that the trial court entered a\nmodified final judgment until the day it filed that brief, the City addressed issues relating to\n\fcourt ordered the City to disclose, Kallinen’s claims were all rendered moot\n\nprior to final judgment and he was entitled to no attorney fee award. As a\n\nresult, all Kallinen’s claims should be dismissed for lack of subject matter\n\njurisdiction and the fee award to him should be reversed and rendered in the\n\nCity’s favor.\n\n\n                                  Statement of Facts\n\nA.     Only Kallinen submits TPIA Requests to City.\n\n       In November and December 2008, Kallinen submitted four email\n\nrequests to the City pursuant to the TPIA requesting release of documents\n\nrelating to the City’s red light traffic camera system. CR.41-48. Kubosh did not\n\nsubmit to the City any TPIA request for documents. CR.75, 194, 322, 607,\n\n674, 746-47, 920, 1001; CR[1].139, 258, 262; RR[1].28, 54. Kallinen’s requests\n\ndid not mention or reference Kubosh. CR.41-48.\n\nB.     City releases 82% of requested documents.\n\n       The City released approximately 3,235 pages of documents to Kallinen\n\npursuant to his requests (about 82% of all responsive documents). CR.398,\n\nthe trial court’s original final judgment in an abundance of caution. Although the modified\nfinal judgment is at issue here, the City addresses issues relating to Kubosh also in an\nabundance of caution in the event that this Court’s September 3, 2015 order allowing\nsupplemental briefing by the parties does not contemplate the filing of a reply brief by the\nCity. In addition, for the same reason, to the extent that any of the City’s arguments as to\nKallinen would also apply to Kubosh, the City addresses those arguments as to both.\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f541-68, 586, 746, 825, 883, 890, 901, 908, 1054, 1071. The City withheld only\n\nabout 700 pages of documents based primarily on TPIA disclosure exceptions\n\nfor materials protected by the deliberative process privilege and attorney-client\n\nprivilege. CR.398, 586, 746, 825, 883, 890, 901, 908, 1054, 1071. The City also\n\ntimely requested a ruling by the Texas Attorney General on application of the\n\nexceptions. CR.75, 80, 81-83, 86-91, 194, 199-202, 205-10, 321, 326-29, 334-\n\n39, 399, 421-27, 587, 607, 746-47, 867, 919-20, 1054, 1071.\n\nC.    Appellees sue City.\n\n      On December 26, 2008, both Appellees sued the City seeking mandamus\n\nrelief under the TPIA to compel disclosure of all the documents that Kallinen\n\nsought in his four requests to the City and declaratory relief under the TDJA to\n\ndeclare that disclosure is required. CR.2-8, 30-38. Appellees filed suit: (1) less\n\nthan two weeks after Kallinen’s fourth request to the City, (2) before the City\n\ncompleted all its submissions to the Attorney General supporting TPIA\n\nexceptions for the withheld documents, (3) before the Attorney General had an\n\nopportunity to complete its review of the City’s submissions and issue its\n\nruling, and (4) despite the fact that Kubosh never requested any documents\n\nfrom the City. CR.2-8, 30-38, 41-48, 75, 80-83, 86-91, 176-77, 194, 199-202,\n\n205-10, 321, 326-29, 334-39, 341-42, 399, 421-27, 429-34, 587, 607, 746-47,\n\n867, 919-20, 1054, 1071, 1110-11, 1135-36, 1139-42, 1186-87.\n\n\n                                        3\n\fD.    Appellees ensure Attorney General does not rule on City’s proper\n      request.\n\n      On January 30, 2009, Appellees (through their counsel) sent an email to\n\nthe Attorney General’s office requesting that it decline to issue a ruling, despite\n\nthe City’s proper request, based on the pendency of their recently-filed lawsuit\n\nagainst the City. CR.399, 428-30, 1110, 1135-36. On December 16, 2008, and\n\nJanuary 8, 2008, the Attorney General sent letters to the City declining to issue\n\nany ruling and instead deferring to the trial court to decide whether the\n\nwithheld documents were excepted from disclosure under the TPIA. CR.176-\n\n77, 341-42, 399, 431-34, 1110-11, 1139-42, 1186-87.\n\nE.    Trial court grants partial summary judgment to Appellees; City\n      releases all documents held not excepted from disclosure.\n\n      On September 14, 2009, Appellees filed a motion for partial summary\n\njudgment arguing that the withheld documents were not excepted from\n\ndisclosure. CR.615, 648-54. On September 28, 2009, the City filed a response.\n\nCR.398-541. On October 2, 2009, Appellees filed a reply. CR.569-74. On\n\nOctober 12, 2009, the trial court entered two orders granting in part and\n\ndenying in part Appellees’ motion for summary judgment and ordering the\n\nCity to disclose some of the withheld documents. CR.582-85; App. A; App. B.\n\nThe City then immediately disclosed to Appellees all withheld documents that\n\nthe trial court ordered the City to disclose. CR.1104.\n\n\n\n                                        4\n\fF.    Trial court holds attorney fees hearing; enters final judgment for\n      Appellees.\n\n      On November 16, 2009, Appellees filed a motion for entry of judgment\n\nand award of attorney fees. CR.659-67. On December 3, 2009, the City filed a\n\nresponse. CR.882-920. On December 8, 2009, the trial court entered an order\n\nreiterating its October 12, 2009 ruling and stating that Appellees’ attorney fee\n\nclaim would be heard at the January 2010 trial setting (which was postponed\n\nseveral times). CR.925, 931-32, 940-41; App. C.4\n\n      On November 20, 2009, the City filed a motion to strike Kubosh as a\n\nparty-plaintiff on the ground that he has no standing to seek relief as a TPIA\n\n“requestor” because he never actually submitted to the City any request for\n\ndocuments. CR.746-50. On November 25, 2009, Appellees filed a response.\n\nCR.810-14. On December 30, 2009, Appellees filed a supplemental response.\n\nCR.935-37. On March 1, 2010, the trial court entered an order denying the\n\nCity’s motion to strike Kubosh. CR.969; App. D.\n\n      On October 6, 2010, the trial court held a hearing on Appellees’ attorney\n\nfee claim against the City. RR[1]. On October 12, 2011, the court entered a\n\n\n\n4\n  Judge Tracy Christopher presided over all trial court proceedings below until December\n2009 when she was appointed as a Justice of the Fourteenth Court of Appeals. After Judge\nChristopher entered the December 8, 2009 order, Judge Caroline Baker presided over all\nsubsequent trial court proceedings below.\n\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\ffinal judgment again reiterating its October 12, 2009 ruling and awarding\n\nattorney fees to Appellees jointly.

The parties subsequently filed\n\nmotions seeking clarification of the trial court’s ruling. CR[1].2-5, 44-122, 257-\n\n60. But in an abundance of caution, on January 12, 2012, the City filed a\n\nnotice of appeal. CR.1213-14.\n\nH.    Trial court modifies judgment, dismisses Kubosh, awards fees only to\n      Kallinen\n\n      On March 9, 2012, Appellees filed a motion for reconsideration of the\n\ntrial court’s ruling on the City’s new trial motion as to the award of attorney\n\nfees to Kubosh or (alternatively) for severance as to Kubosh so that the\n\njudgment as to Kallinen may become final and appealable.

CR[4].5-6.\n\nI.     This Court rules for City; Texas Supreme Court disagrees.\n\n       On August 29, 2013, this Court reversed the trial court’s order denying\n\nthe City’s plea and rendered judgment that Appellees claims against the City\n\nare dismissed for want of jurisdiction. App. H. On March 20, 2015, the\n\nSupreme Court reversed this Court’s judgment and remanded to this Court for\n\nfurther proceedings in accordance with its opinion. App. I. Both this Court’s\n\nand the Supreme Court’s rulings focused on the City’s argument regarding\n\nwhether the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over Appellees’ claims\n\nbefore the Attorney General ruled on the City’s request for decision on the\n\ndocuments it withheld based on TPIA disclosure exceptions—and did not\n\naddress other arguments raised by the City. App. H; App. I.5\n\n\n                                 Summary of Argument\n\n       First, Appellees’ TPIA mandamus and attorney fee claims were not\n\njusticiable. Appellees’ TPIA mandamus and attorney fee claims were no longer\n\n\n\n5\n For the Court’s convenience, the City includes in this brief arguments (infra, pp. 17-28) that\nwere raised in its original appeal brief in the event the Court prefers to have one brief\ncontaining all the City’s arguments not addressed by this Court’s and the Supreme Court’s\nrulings.\n\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\fjusticiable at the time of final judgment because they were mooted when, prior\n\nto final judgment, the City produced to Kallinen all withheld documents that\n\nthe trial court ordered the City to disclose, obviating any justiciable\n\ncontroversy regarding entitlement to mandamus relief or attorney fees. The\n\ntrial court therefore had no subject matter jurisdiction at the time it entered its\n\nmodified final judgment because Appellees’ TPIA mandamus and attorney fee\n\nclaims were no longer justiciable at that time due to mootness.\n\n      Second, Appellees’ claims against the City are barred by governmental\n\nimmunity, which defeats subject matter jurisdiction, for several reasons.\n\nAppellees’ TDJA claims are barred by immunity because they are redundant\n\nand duplicative of their TPIA claims. Appellees’ TPIA mandamus claims are\n\nalso barred by immunity because the TPIA does not waive the City’s immunity\n\nand the only proper defendant for such claims is the pertinent public\n\ninformation officer. Appellees’ TDJA claims are likewise barred by immunity\n\nbecause the TDJA likewise does not waive immunity and the only proper\n\ndefendant for such claims is the pertinent public information officer. The trial\n\ncourt therefore had no subject matter jurisdiction because Appellees’ claims\n\nagainst the City are barred by governmental immunity.\n\n      Third, there was no evidence or insufficient evidence to support any\n\naward of attorney fees to Appellees. Kallinen was not entitled to any award of\n\n\n                                        9\n\fattorney fees because he did not actually incur any fees—as Kubosh, who was\n\nnot a “requestor” and therefore had no justiciable claim on which to sue,\n\nincurred all the claimed fees. In addition, Appellees offered no evidence or\n\ninsufficient evidence to support the amount of the attorney fee award. The trial\n\ncourt therefore also erred by awarding attorney fees to Appellees because they\n\nfailed to satisfy their burden to support any award of fees.\n\n      Finally, although the trial court ultimately dismissed Kubosh and his\n\nclaims, the City nonetheless also addresses those claims here in the event that\n\nit does not have the opportunity to file a reply brief. Kubosh’s TPIA\n\nmandamus and attorney fee claims were never justiciable due to lack of\n\nripeness and standing because he never actually submitted any TPIA request to\n\nthe City, obviating any status as a TPIA “requestor” authorized to file suit.\n\nThe trial court therefore also never had no subject matter jurisdiction over\n\nKubosh’s TPIA mandamus and attorney fee claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                        10\n\f                                        Argument\n\nI.     The trial court erred by denying the City’s plea and otherwise had no\n       subject-matter jurisdiction over Appellees’ claims.\n\n       A.     The trial court had no subject-matter jurisdiction because\n              Appellees’ TPIA mandamus and attorney fee claims were not\n              justiciable.\n\n              1.     Appellees’ TPIA mandamus and attorney fee claims were\n                     no longer justiciable at the time of final judgment because\n                     they were mooted when the City, prior to final judgment,\n                     produced all withheld documents that the trial court\n                     ordered the City to disclose.\n\n       The trial court had no subject-matter jurisdiction over Appellees’ TPIA\n\nmandamus and attorney fee claims due to mootness. The TPIA provides that,\n\nin an action under Section 552.321, “the court shall assess costs of litigation\n\nand reasonable attorney fees incurred by a plaintiff who substantially prevails”\n\n(subject to certain exceptions). See Tex. Gov’t Code § 552.323(a).6 The term\n\n“substantially prevails” incorporates the concept of a “prevailing party” and\n\nmust be construed in line with prevailing-party requirements for recovering\n\nattorney fees. See Tex. State Bd. of Veterinary Med. Exam’rs v. Giggleman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">696</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 703 (Tex. App.—Austin 2013, no pet.).\n\n6\n  Section 552.323(a) specifies exception prohibiting the court from assessing “costs and fees\nagainst a governmental body if the court finds that the governmental body acted in\nreasonable reliance on: (1) a judgment or an order of a court applicable to the governmental\nbody; (2) the published opinion of an appellate court; or (3) a written decision of the\nattorney general, including a decision issued under Subchapter G or an opinion issued\nunder Section 402.042.” See Tex.

Satisfaction\n\nof the TPIA “substantially prevails” prong for fee recovery requires an\n\nenforceable final judgment against the defendant from whom fees are sought,\n\nor comparable relief through a consent decree or settlement. See Giggleman, 408\n\nS.W.3d at 703; see also Int’l Grp. P’ship, 295 S.W.3d at 654.\n\n      In this case, Appellees’ TPIA mandamus and attorney fee claims were\n\nmooted prior to the trial court’s final judgment. It is undisputed that, after the\n\ntrial court granted summary judgment in favor of Appellees but before it\n\nentered final judgment, the City immediately and voluntarily produced to\n\nAppellees all withheld documents that the trial court ordered the City to\n\ndisclose. CR.1104. By doing so, the City obviated any justiciable controversy\n\n\n                                        12\n\fregarding Kallinen’s (or Kubosh’s) entitlement to mandamus relief or attorney\n\nfees. See Giggleman, 408 S.W.3d at 704. This result is particularly appropriate\n\nhere, where the City timely and properly requested an Attorney General\n\nopinion, but was deprived of the ability to obtain and rely on such an\n\nopinion—by Appellees’ filing suit before the Attorney General ruled and\n\nrequesting the Attorney General to defer ruling due to their suit. Had the City\n\nnot been so deprived, Appellees would not have been entitled to attorney fees\n\nbecause the City would have complied with the Attorney General ruling. It is\n\nalso consistent with both Section 552.321 and Giggleman to hold that the City\n\nwhich—once it was provided with authoritative guidance in the trial court’s\n\nruling, relied on it, and produced the documents—should not have been\n\nsubjected to an award of attorney fees.\n\n\n            2.    As a result, the trial court had no subject-matter\n                  jurisdiction because Appellees’ TPIA mandamus and\n                  attorney fee claims were not justiciable at the time of final\n                  judgment.\n\n      Subject matter jurisdiction is essential to the authority of a court to\n\ndecide a case.

Id.\n\n      The trial court therefore had no jurisdiction at the time it entered final\n\njudgment because Appellees’ TPIA mandamus and attorney fee claims were\n\nmooted, and thus no longer justiciable, prior to that judgment due to the City’s\n\nproduction of the remaining documents to Kallinen.\n\n\n      B.    The trial court also had no subject-matter jurisdiction because\n            all Appellees’ claims are barred by immunity.\n\n            1.    Appellees’ TDJA claims are barred by immunity because\n                  they are redundant and duplicative of their TPIA claims.\n\n      The TDJA also does not waive immunity for Appellees’ TDJA claims\n\nseeking relief that is redundant or duplicative of the relief they seek through\n\ntheir TPIA mandamus claims. Declaratory relief is proper if a justiciable\n\ncontroversy exists as to the rights and status of the parties and the controversy\n\nwill be resolved by the declaration sought.

The focus of the doctrine is on the initiation of the\n\ncase and, in the jurisdictional and immunity context, whether the Legislature\n\ncreated a statutory waiver of sovereign immunity that permits the parties to\n\nraise their claims through some avenue other than the UDJA. Id. The Texas\n\nSupreme Court, as well as the Austin Court of Appeals, has confirmed that an\n\naward of attorney fees under the TDJA is unavailable if the claim for\n\ndeclaratory relief is merely incidental to or redundant of relief sought through\n\nTPIA claims.

So Appellees’ TDJA claims only seek to resolve issues already\n\npending before the trial court through their TPIA claims and raise no new or\n\ndifferent controversies. Appellees allege duplicative TDJA claims merely in an\n\neffort to obtain attorney fees, under the permissive TDJA standard, that are\n\notherwise unrecoverable under the TPIA here. Allowing Appellees to recover\n\nattorney fees under the TDJA when they cannot meet the requirements for fee\n\nrecovery under the TPIA would frustrate the limits established by the TPIA.\n\nSee Jackson, 351 S.W.3d at 300. Appellees’ TDJA claims are therefore also\n\nbarred by immunity because they seek relief that is redundant and duplicative\n\nof the relief that they seek through their TPIA claims.\n\n\n            2.    Appellees’ TPIA mandamus claims are also barred by\n                  immunity because the TPIA does not waive the City’s\n                  immunity and the only proper defendant for such claims is\n                  the pertinent public information officer.\n\n      The TPIA does not waive immunity for Appellees’ TPIA mandamus\n\nclaims against the City under section 552.321(a)—it authorizes such claims\n\nonly against the pertinent City official. The TPIA requires an “officer for\n\npublic information of a governmental body” to produce public information for\n\ninspection and/or duplication on application by any person to the officer. See\n\nTex. Gov’t Code § 552.221(a). It also authorizes a “requestor” to file suit for a\n\n\n\n\n                                       17\n\fwrit of mandamus compelling “a governmental body” to make information\n\navailable for public inspection. See Tex. Gov’t Code § 552.321(a).8\n\n      The Texas Supreme Court reconciled these provisions and held that the\n\nonly “proper party” against whom mandamus may be sought under Section\n\n552.321(a) is the officer for public information rather than the governmental\n\nbody. See A & T Consultants, Inc. v. Sharp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1523516\"><a href=\"/opinion/1523516/a-t-consultants-inc-v-sharp/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 672-73, 681 (Tex.\n\n1995). The Court based its conclusion on the duty that the public information\n\nofficer has to make public information available under Sections 552.203 and\n\n552.221(a). Id. In addition, the Fourteenth Court of Appeals followed Sharp\n\nand reversed a summary judgment disposing of a mandamus suit filed against\n\na county sheriff in his official capacity. See Guthrie v.

App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2011, no pet.).\n\n      The Guthrie Court also relied on the Texas Supreme Court decision in\n\nHeinrich regarding the ultra vires exception to governmental immunity based on\n\nthe distinction between suits against a governmental entity and those against a\n\npublic official in his official capacity. See Guthrie, 352 S.W.3d at 309\n\n(discussing City of El Paso v. Heinrich, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">366</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 372-76 (Tex. 2009)). The\n\nHeinrich court explained as follows:\n\n8\n The TPIA defines a “requestor” as “a person who submits a request to a governmental\nbody for inspection or copies of public information.” See Tex. Gov’t Code § 552.003(6).\n\n\n\n\n                                          18\n\f     From this rationale, it is clear that suits to require state officials to\n     comply with statutory or constitutional provisions are not\n     prohibited by sovereign immunity, even if a declaration to that\n     effect compels the payment of money. To fall within this ultra vires\n     exception, a suit must not complain of a government officer’s\n     exercise of discretion, but rather must allege, and ultimately prove,\n     that the officer acted without legal authority or failed to perform a\n     purely ministerial act. Thus, ultra vires suits do not attempt to exert\n     control over the state—they attempt to reassert the control of the\n     state. Stated another way, these suits do not seek to alter\n     government policy but rather to enforce existing policy.\n\nHeinrich, 284 S.W.3d at 372. The Guthrie court therefore held that the\n\nrequestor’s mandamus suit against the county sheriff in his official capacity\n\nwas proper under Section 552.321(a) because any claim against the county for\n\nmandamus relief would necessarily have failed as a matter of law. See Guthrie,\n\n352 S.W.3d at 309-10.\n\n     In this case, Appellees filed their TPIA mandamus claims under Section\n\n552.321(a) only against the City. They did not file those claims against the\n\nCity’s public information officer for the withheld information. So Appellees\n\ndid not file suit against the only proper party against whom mandamus relief\n\nmay be sought under Section 552.321(a), and the City is therefore immune\n\nfrom Appellees’ TPIA mandamus claims under Section 552.321(a).\n\n\n\n\n                                        19\n\f            3.     Appellees’ TDJA claims are likewise barred by immunity\n                   because the TDJA also does not waive the City’s\n                   immunity and the only proper defendant for such claims is\n                   the pertinent public information officer.\n\n      The TDJA also does not waive immunity for Appellees’ TDJA claims\n\nagainst the City—and, just like the TPIA, only authorizes such claims against\n\nthe pertinent City official. As outlined above, the Heinrich Court explained the\n\nultra vires exception to immunity based on the distinction between suits against\n\na governmental entity and those against public officials in their official\n\ncapacities. See Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d at 372-76; see also Guthrie, 352 S.W.3d at\n\n309. But Heinrich also confirmed that a plaintiff may not bring declaratory\n\njudgment actions against a governmental entity to determine rights under a\n\nparticular statute. See Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d at 372-73; see also Tex. Dep’t of State\n\nHealth Servs. v. Holmes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1789860\"><a href=\"/opinion/1789860/texas-department-of-state-health-services-v-holmes/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">328</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 335 (Tex. App.—Austin 2009, pet.\n\ndenied). Rather, plaintiffs are limited to bringing ultra vires suits against\n\ngovernmental officials in their official capacities. See Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d at\n\n372-73; Holmes, 294 S.W.3d at 335. So as a technical matter, governmental\n\nentities—as opposed to their officers in their official capacities—remain\n\nimmune from suit. See Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d at 372-73.\n\n      In this case, like their TPIA claims, Appellees also filed their TDJA\n\nclaims only against the City. They did not file those claims against the\n\n\n\n                                        20\n\fpertinent City official in his or her official capacity. So Appellees did not file\n\nsuit against the only proper party against whom declaratory relief may be\n\nsought under the TDJA, and the City is therefore also immune from\n\nAppellees’ TDJA claims.\n\n\n            4.    As a result, the trial court also had no subject-matter\n                  jurisdiction because all Appellees’ claims are barred by\n                  immunity.\n\n      Sovereign and governmental immunity protect the State and its political\n\nsubdivisions, including municipalities, from suit and liability unless such\n\nimmunity is waived.

Immunity from suit defeats subject-matter jurisdiction. See Reata Const.\n\nCorp., 197 S.W.3d at 374; IT-Davy, 74 S.W.3d at 855.\n\n\n\n                                       21\n\f      The trial court therefore had no jurisdiction because all Appellees’ claims\n\nare barred by immunity for several reasons: (1) their TDJA claims are barred\n\nbecause they are redundant and duplicative of their TPIA claims, (2) their\n\nTPIA mandamus claims are barred because the TPIA does not waive\n\nimmunity and the only proper defendant for such claims is the pertinent public\n\ninformation officer, and (3) their TDJA claims are barred by immunity because\n\nthe TDJA also does not waive immunity and the only proper defendant for\n\nsuch claims is the pertinent public information officer.\n\n\nII.   The trial court erred by awarding attorney fees to Appellees because\n      there was no evidence or insufficient evidence to support any award of\n      fees to them.\n\n      A.    Kallinen was not entitled to any award of attorney fees because\n            he did not actually incur any attorney fees—as Kubosh incurred\n            all the claimed fees.\n\n      Even if the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction (which the City\n\ndenies), Kallinen was not entitled to any attorney fee award because he did not\n\nactually incur any fees. As noted above, the TPIA requires the trial court to\n\nassess costs of litigation and reasonable attorney fees in a mandamus suit\n\nunder Section 552.321—but may only award costs and fees that are actually\n\nincurred by a plaintiff who substantially prevails. See Tex. Gov’t Code\n\n§ 552.323(a). The Texas Supreme Court has confirmed that attorney fees are\n\nincurred only where a party becomes liable for them and that a fee award\n\n                                       22\n\funder Section 552.323(a) or the TDJA is proper only where the fees are\n\nactually incurred. See Jackson, 351 S.W.3d at 299-301 (holding that licensed\n\nattorney was not entitled to recover attorney fees under TPIA because he did\n\nnot incur attorney fees since he represented himself or under TDJA because his\n\ndeclaratory relief claim was merely incidental to his TPIA claim).\n\n       In this case, the evidence presented at the trial court hearing on attorney\n\nfees, including all billing invoices that Appellees’ counsel submitted for\n\nrepresentation of Appellees in this case, conclusively establishes that only\n\nKubosh incurred all the claimed fees allegedly incurred in connection with the\n\nTPIA requests for information that only Kallinen submitted to the City.\n\nAppellees’ counsel submitted all billing invoices only to Kubosh—and did not\n\nsubmit any billing invoices to Kallinen. RR[1] Ex. 2. Kallinen offered no\n\nevidence that he incurred any of the claimed fees. RR[1] Ex. 2. Kallinen was\n\ntherefore not entitled to any award of attorney fees because he did not actually\n\nincur any attorney fees—as Kubosh incurred all the claimed fees.9\n\n\n9\n  To the extent that Appellees challenge the trial court’s dismissal of Kubosh due to lack of\nstanding, the attorney fee award under the court’s original final judgment was nonetheless\nerroneous. First, for the reasons outlined above (which are incorporated here for all\npurposes), Kubosh was not entitled to any fee award because his TPIA mandamus and\nattorney fee claims were not justiciable. Second, for the same reasons that Kubosh was not\nentitled to any fee award, the fee award to Appellees jointly was erroneous and could not\nstand because Kallinen was not entitled to any fees that Kubosh was not entitled to recover\n—and Appellees failed to segregate the fees that each allegedly incurred.\n\n\n\n\n                                             23\n\f      B.    Appellees were not entitled to any award of attorney fees\n            because they failed to properly segregate recoverable (alleged)\n            fees from non-recoverable (alleged) fees.\n\n      Even if Kallinen incurred any fees (which the City denies), neither\n\nAppellee was entitled to any award of attorney fees because each failed to\n\nproperly segregate recoverable (alleged) fees from non-recoverable (alleged)\n\nfees. The Texas Supreme Court has confirmed that where attorney fees relate\n\nto a claim for which fees are not recoverable, a claimant must segregate\n\nrecoverable from unrecoverable fees. See Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 313 (Tex. 2006). Intertwined facts do not make fees recoverable;\n\nit is only when discrete legal services advance both a recoverable and\n\nunrecoverable claim that they are so intertwined that they need not be\n\nsegregated. See Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at 313-14; see also Rapid Settlements, Ltd. v.\n\nSettlement Funding, LLC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2541467\"><a href=\"/opinion/2541467/rapid-v-settlement-funding-llc/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">777</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 787 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th\n\nDist.] 2012, no pet.) (citing Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at 313-14).\n\n      In this case, as noted above, Appellees’ counsel failed to segregate any\n\nattorney fees incurred with regard to documents that the trial court ordered the\n\nCity to disclose from any incurred with regard to documents that the City\n\nultimately disclosed to Appellees voluntarily. RR[1] Ex. 2. Appellees’ counsel\n\nalso failed to segregate any attorney fees incurred by Kubosh from any\n\nincurred by Kallinen. RR[1] Ex. 2. But such segregation as to Kubosh and\n\n\n                                       24\n\fKallinen is critical to determining the amount of fees to which each may be\n\nentitled. It is particularly critical to ensuring that neither is awarded any\n\nattorney fees incurred only by Kubosh—who, as outlined above, lacks standing\n\nnot only for the same reasons why Kallinen lacks standing, but also for the\n\nadditional reason that he never actually submitted any TPIA request to the\n\nCity and therefore is not even a requestor authorized to file suit for mandamus\n\nrelief under Section 552.321(a). Appellees were therefore not entitled to any\n\naward of attorney fees because they failed to properly segregate recoverable\n\n(alleged) fees from non-recoverable (alleged) fees.10\n\n\n       C.     Appellees offered no evidence or insufficient evidence to support\n              the amount of the award of attorney fees.\n\n       In the alternative, and subject to the City’s arguments on lack of\n\njurisdiction (including that Kallinen is not a prevailing party for purposes of\n\nTPIA fee recovery), Appellees also failed to offer any evidence or any\n\nsufficient evidence to support any fee award. As noted above, the TPIA\n\nauthorizes the court to assess reasonable attorney fees incurred by a plaintiff\n\nwho substantially prevails in a mandamus suit under Section 552.321(a). See\n\n\n10\n  Although Appellees did segregate fees to a limited (and insufficient) extent after the trial\ncourt’s original final judgment, they failed to properly segregate fees separately incurred by\neach of them.\n\n\n\n\n                                             25\n\fTex. Gov’t Code § 552.323(a). In this case, Appellees offered no evidence or\n\ninsufficient evidence to establish that any attorney fees they allegedly incurred\n\nwere reasonable. The City’s attorney fee expert, Patrick Zummo, testified at\n\nthe attorney fee hearing in the trial court that Appellees’ claimed attorney fees\n\nwere not reasonable or proper for multiple reasons.\n\n      Mr. Zummo explained that Appellees’ counsel did not exercise\n\nappropriate billing judgment. RR[1].122, 134-35, 139, 1144. Mr. Zummo’s\n\ntestimony also confirms that Appellees’ evidence cannot support their burden\n\nto prove that the claimed attorney fees were reasonable because:\n\n   1. The billing invoices included many single entries for total time allegedly\n      expended in a single day instead of multiple daily entries broken down\n      for discrete individual tasks. RR[1].128-29, 141-43, 149, 182.\n\n   2. Many task descriptions were too generic which precluded any\n      independent assessment of the reasonableness of the stated time\n      amounts. RR[1].132, 133, 147.\n\n   3. Many task descriptions were redacted which also precluded independent\n      assessment of the reasonableness of the stated time amounts. RR[1].121,\n      130, 133, 149, 151, .\n\n   4. Tasks relating to the deliberative process privilege and attorney-client\n      privilege on which the City relied were not segregated even though they\n      could have been segregated for the most part. RR[1].148-49, 152-54.\n\n   5. The billing invoices included amounts for extensive research on legal\n      issues of Appellees’ counsel touted expertise. RR[1].132, 156-57.\n\n   6. The billing invoices included amounts for numerous attorney-client\n      conferences to discuss “strategy” despite the fact that strategy had not\n\n\n                                       26\n\f      significantly changed and that Appellees are lawyers. RR[1].132-33, 141-\n      42, 147-48, 150, 151, 180, .\n\n   7. The billing invoices included amounts for unproductive speculation and\n      investigation regarding whether Professor Robert Stein of Rice\n      University allowed an alleged employment relationship between his wife\n      and staff of the Mayor of the City of Houston to influence his research,\n      analysis and opinions. RR[1].146-47.\n\n   8. The billing invoices included amounts for excessive time spent reviewing\n      the City’s documents and performing other tasks. RR[1].136-44, 151.\n\nMr. Zummo’s testimony therefore raised numerous fact issues regarding\n\nwhether Appellees satisfied their burden to prove that the claimed attorney fees\n\nwere reasonable.\n\n      Mr. Zummo testified that the foregoing issues with Appellees’ claimed\n\nattorney fees required reduction of about $21,440.00 (based upon 67 hours at\n\n$320 per hour). RR[1].151-52. Mr. Zummo also testified that, based on the\n\ncount of the documents subject to the trial court’s rulings, Appellees were not\n\nsuccessful in their attempt to obtain 25% of the documents they sought—\n\nreflecting the total percentage of withheld document for which the City\n\nclaimed the attorney-client privilege. RR[1].153-55. Mr. Zummo determined\n\nthat, even after deduction of $21,440 as stated above, the remaining amount\n\nshould be further reduced accordingly to a percentage reflecting only the total\n\npercentage of withheld documents that the trial court ordered the City to\n\n\n\n\n                                      27\n\fdisclose. RR[1].153-55. Mr. Zummo’s testimony therefore also confirms that\n\nthe amount of attorney fees awarded was excessive.\n\n\nIII.   The trial court also had no subject-matter jurisdiction over Kubosh’s\n       claims; Kubosh’s TPIA mandamus and attorney fee claims were never\n       justiciable due to lack of ripeness and standing because he never\n       submitted any TPIA request to the City.\n\n       The trial court also had no subject-matter jurisdiction over Kubosh’s\n\nTPIA mandamus and attorney fee claims due to lack of ripeness and standing.\n\nAs noted above, the TPIA authorizes a “requestor” to file suit for a writ of\n\nmandamus compelling a governmental body to make information available for\n\npublic inspection—and defines a “requestor” as “a person who submits a\n\nrequest to a governmental body for inspection or copies of public information.”\n\nSee Tex. Gov’t Code §§ 552.321(a), 552.003(6). The plain language of Section\n\n552.321 therefore only authorizes a person who submits a request for\n\ninformation to a governmental body to file suit for a writ of mandamus. In this\n\ncase, it is undisputed that Kubosh never actually submitted any request for\n\ninformation to the City before filing his TPIA claims against the City—despite\n\ntheir lack of ripeness and his lack of standing. The trial court therefore had no\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction over Kubosh’s TPIA mandamus and attorney fee\n\nclaims under Sections 552.321(a) and Section 552.323 because those claims\n\nwere not justiciable due to lack of ripeness and standing.\n\n\n                                       28\n\f                            Conclusion and Prayer\n\n      For these reasons, the City Houston asked this Court to (1) reverse the\n\norder of the trial court denying the City’s plea to the jurisdiction and render\n\njudgment in the City’s favor that all Kallinen’s claims against the City are\n\ndismissed for want of jurisdiction, and (2) reverse the modified final judgment\n\nof the trial court awarding attorney fees to Kallinen and render judgment in the\n\nCity’s favor that Kallinen is not entitled to attorney fees and shall take nothing\n\non any of his claims against the City.\n\n\n\n\n                                         29\n\f                                       Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                       DONNA L.

The\n\n\n\n200022v1\n\fCourt also FINDS and ORDERS, however, that Paul ICubosh does not have standing in this case, and\n\nhe is dismissed with prejudice by this Judgment.

Accordingly, the Court reverses the trial court’s judgment denying the City\nof Houston’s plea to the jurisdiction and renders judgment that Randall Kallinen’s and\nPaul Kubosh’s claims against the City of Houston are dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\n\n       The Court orders that the appellees, Randall Kallinen and Paul Kubosh, jointly and\nseverally, pay all appellate costs.\n\n       The Court orders that this decision be certified below for observance.\n\fJudgment rendered August 29, 2013.\n\nPanel consists of Justices Bland, Sharp, and Massengale.

Randall Kallinen and Paul\n\nKubosh (“appellees”) filed a mandamus suit against the City of Houston (“the\n\nCity”) seeking the public disclosure of various documents requested regarding the\n\fCity’s red light camera installations. After a series of rulings by the trial court, the\n\nCity filed a motion for new trial and plea to the jurisdiction. The trial court denied\n\nthe City’s plea to the jurisdiction. In two issues, the City challenges the trial\n\ncourt’s orders denying its plea to the jurisdiction and awarding attorney’s fees to\n\nappellees. We reverse and render.\n\n                                     Background\n\n      In November and December 2008, Kallinen made four requests under the\n\nTPIA for release of information regarding a commissioned study on traffic light\n\ncameras in Houston. The City released some of the documents but withheld others\n\nbased upon disclosure exceptions under the Act.           The City also requested a\n\ndecision from the Attorney General regarding whether the TPIA exceptions\n\napplied. Before the Attorney General had issued a decision, appellees filed suit in\n\ndistrict court on December 26, 2008, seeking a writ of mandamus under the TPIA.1\n\nAppellees then requested that the Attorney General refrain from making a\n\ndetermination because the issue was a subject of ongoing litigation. The Attorney\n\nGeneral did subsequently decline to issue an opinion in order to allow the trial\n\ncourt to decide whether the withheld documents were excepted from disclosure\n\nunder the TPIA.\n\n\n1\n      Appellees also filed a declaratory judgment under the Texas Declaratory Judgment\n      Act (“TDJA”), seeking a declaration that disclosure was required. See TEX. CIV.\n      PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 37.002(b) (West 2008).\n                                           2\n\f      On September 14, 2009, appellees filed a motion for partial summary\n\njudgment seeking a ruling as to whether the TPIA’s exceptions applied to the\n\nwithheld documents. On October 12, 2009, the trial court granted in part, and\n\ndenied in part, appellees’ summary judgment motion, and ordered the City to\n\ndisclose some of the withheld documents. On November 16, 2009, appellees filed\n\na motion for entry of judgment and award of attorney’s fees and, following a\n\nhearing on appellees’ attorney’s fee claim, the trial court issued a final judgment\n\non October 12, 2011, reiterating its October 12, 2009 ruling and awarding\n\nappellees $95,664 jointly in attorney’s fees.\n\n      On November 10, 2011, the City filed a motion for new trial and plea to the\n\njurisdiction. On January 5, 2012, the trial court granted the City’s motion for new\n\ntrial as to attorney’s fees for Kubosh and denied the City’s plea to the jurisdiction.\n\nOn July 12, 2012, the trial court entered a modified final judgment ruling that\n\nKubosh was without standing and awarding him no attorney’s fees.\n\n                                Standard of Review\n\n      A plea to the jurisdiction challenges the trial court’s subject matter\n\njurisdiction which is essential to the authority of a court to decide a case.

Courts also consider the objective the law seeks to obtain. See\n\nTEX. GOV’T CODE § 311.023(1) (West 2005).\n\n                                    Discussion\n\n      In its first issue, the City contends that the trial court erred in denying its\n\nplea to the jurisdiction because, among other reasons, the Attorney General\n\ndeclined to perform his statutory duty to issue a decision on the City’s request.\n\nAppellees argue that they have a statutory right to file a suit for writ of mandamus\n\nagainst the City because the City refused to release public information.\n\n   A. Applicable Law\n\n      The TPIA governs public disclosure of information about the affairs of the\n\ngovernment and the official acts of public officials and employees, and it requires\n\nthe officer for public information of a governmental body to produce public\n\n                                         4\n\finformation for inspection or copying on application by any person to the officer.\n\nSee TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. §§ 552.001, .203, .221(a) (West 2012). A “requestor”\n\nis defined as “a person who submits a request to a governmental body for\n\ninspection or copies of public information.” Id. § 552.003(6).\n\n      The TPIA also lists numerous exceptions from required disclosure. See id.\n\n§§ 552.101–.153. Though the act is to be liberally construed in favor of granting\n\nrequests for information, id. § 552.001(b), a governmental body may seek to\n\nwithhold requested information that it believes falls within one of the statutory\n\nexceptions to disclosure. See id. §§ 552.101–.153. To do so, the government body\n\nmust timely request an Attorney General determination (if there has not been a\n\nprevious determination) and assert which exceptions to disclosure apply to the\n\ninformation requested. Id. § 552.301. The TPIA provides that “the attorney\n\ngeneral shall promptly render a decision requested . . . determining whether the\n\nrequested information is within one of the exceptions . . . .” Id. § 552.306(a).\n\nHowever, the governmental body may disclose the requested information to the\n\npublic or to the requestor before the Attorney General—or, if suit is filed under the\n\nTPIA, the court with jurisdiction—makes a final determination that the requested\n\ninformation is public, except if the requested information is confidential by law.\n\nSee id. § 552.303(a).\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\f        The TPIA also provides that the Attorney General and the original requestor\n\nmay file suit for a writ of mandamus to compel a governmental body to release\n\ninformation to the public “if the governmental body refuses to request an attorney\n\ngeneral’s decision . . . or refuses to supply public information or information that\n\nthe attorney general has determined is public information.” Id. § 552.32(a). If a\n\ngovernmental body does not request an Attorney General decision after receiving a\n\nwritten request for information, the requested information is presumed to be\n\nsubject to required public disclosure and must be released unless there is a\n\ncompelling reason to withhold it. See id. § 552.302. Further, the TPIA also\n\nprovides that the only exceptions to required disclosure that the governmental body\n\nmay raise in such a suit are those that it properly raised before the Attorney\n\nGeneral to support its request for a decision as to whether disclosure is required.\n\nSee id. § 552.326(a).\n\n        B. Analysis\n\n        The issue before us is whether the TPIA allows a requestor to sue for a writ\n\nof mandamus prior to the Attorney General issuing a decision when the\n\ngovernmental body has requested one. The City contends that the TPIA requires\n\nthe Attorney General to render a decision before a mandamus suit may be filed.\n\nAppellees argue that no such requirement has been or should be read into the\n\nTPIA.\n\n                                          6\n\f      As previously noted, section 552.321(a) sets out three scenarios under which\n\nthe Attorney General or a requestor may file a mandamus suit.               First, if a\n\ngovernmental body fails to request an Attorney General decision in the time\n\npermitted, the information is presumed to be open to public disclosure, and the\n\ngovernmental body must release the information. See id. § 552.321(a). If it fails to\n\ndo so, the requestor may file suit for a writ of mandamus. See id. Second, if the\n\nAttorney General has rendered a decision and the governmental body has failed to\n\ncomply with the decision, the Attorney General or the requestor may then file suit.\n\nSee id. Finally, either the Attorney General or the requestor may file suit, if the\n\ngovernmental body “refuses to supply public information.” Id.\n\n      Appellees argue that the third scenario applies here. That is, they argue that\n\nthe City refused to release public information and they were therefore entitled to\n\nfile a mandamus suit. In support of their argument, appellees point out that the\n\nlegislature did not qualify the word “refuse” by including exceptions for cases in\n\nwhich the government body has requested an Attorney General ruling. 2 That\n\n2\n      Appellees rely on Thomas v.

(noting that mandamus statute “does not qualify the word ‘refuse’\n      by including an exception for cases in which the governing body has filed a suit\n      against the attorney general under the Act, and we will not read such an exception\n      into the statute.”). That reliance is misplaced. In Thomas, the Attorney General\n      had already rendered a decision on the nature of the information. According to\n      section 552.324(a)(2), a governmental body may sue for declaratory relief from\n      compliance with an already issued decision by the Attorney General. The Thomas\n      court correctly determined that the suit for writ of mandamus filed after the\n      Attorney General decision and before the suit for declaratory relief had been\n                                          7\n\freading, however, is unpersuasive. Though the term “refuse” is not qualified, the\n\nterm “information” is. See id. § 552.321(a) (permitting suit for writ of mandamus\n\nwhere “governmental body refuses to supply public information”) (emphasis\n\nadded). Because the TPIA carves out numerous exceptions to disclosure of certain\n\ntypes of information and establishes procedures to determine whether information\n\nfalls under those exceptions, it is illogical to presume that information is public\n\nwhile its very status is being challenged. Additionally, considering that the statute\n\nexplicitly states when information is presumed to be public—i.e., if the\n\ngovernmental body has not made an Attorney General request—it does not stand to\n\nreason that information should be considered public when a request has been made.\n\n      Not only does the statute clearly provide when a mandamus suit may be\n\nfiled, but it is equally clear that the Attorney General must render a decision on the\n\nnature of the information in question. The City contends that the TPIA is a\n\ncomprehensive regulatory scheme under which the Attorney General must issue a\n\ndecision before a mandamus suit may be filed.3 It argues that because the Attorney\n\n\n      decided was a valid one, pointing to the relevant provision in 552.325(a) allowing\n      a requestor to intervene in such suits. The language that appellees cite from\n      Thomas is clearly applicable only to fact patterns involving governmental bodies’\n      suits against the Attorney General, not for suits for writ of mandamus prior to an\n      Attorney General ruling.\n3\n      An agency has exclusive jurisdiction when it is clear that the legislature instituted\n      a pervasive regulatory scheme meant to be the exclusive means of remedying\n      certain problems targeted by the legislation.

Att’y Gen. OR2011-687. After acknowledging the previous agency\n\ndecisions cited by appellees in which the agency had declined to issue an opinion\n\nwhen that same question was pending before a court, the Attorney General ruled\n\nthat “this litigation policy is withdrawn and is no longer applicable to the PIA\n\nruling process.” Id.\n\n      This decision is significant in several ways. First, it notes that the Attorney\n\nGeneral may not refuse to fulfill his duty to render open records decisions. See\n\nHous. Chronicle Publ’g Co. v.

In particular, the decision highlights the addition of\n\nsection 552.011, which charges the Attorney General with “maintain[ing]\n\nuniformity in the application, operation, and interpretation of this chapter.” The\n\ndecision then concludes that the detailed statutory scheme under which the\n\nAttorney General’s open records ruling process operates, as well as the lack of any\n\nlanguage affirmatively directing the Attorney General to decline to issue an open\n\nrecords ruling for the benefit of the public, demonstrate that such Attorney General\n\ndecisions are, indeed, mandatory. Finally, Open Records Decision No. 687 offers\n\ninsights into the policy considerations underpinning the Attorney General’s\n\nexpanded role under the statute. Vesting the Attorney General with the role of\n\nevaluating requests by governmental bodies to withhold putatively excepted\n\ninformation is both more efficient, avoiding the expense of court action, and more\n\ndemocratic, allowing Texans equal access to information regardless of their ability\n\nto secure legal representation.

The court\n\nof appeals reasoned that condition B1 cannot apply when the governmental body is challenging\n\nwhether an exception to disclosure applies because the information has not yet been determined to\n\nbe public. 414 S.W.3d at 818. Accepting the City’s argument, the court stated that the Attorney\n\nGeneral must determine whether information is subject to disclosure when asked to do so, that he\n\nhas exclusive jurisdiction to make that determination in the first instance, that the requestor of\n\ninformation must exhaust all administrative remedies before suing, and that therefore a trial court’s\n\njurisdiction over a requestor’s suit “only arises after the Attorney General has ruled.” Id. at 818–20.\n\n       The City’s position is flawed in several respects. First, it equates information that is public\n\nwith information that has been determined by the Attorney General to be public, so that condition\n\nB2 swallows up condition B1.

The court of appeals’ interpretation ignores these\n\ncases.\n\n         The City argues, and the court of appeals held, that requestors of information should be\n\nrequired to exhaust their remedies in placing disputes before the Attorney General before resorting\n\nto the courts. But requestors have no such remedies. While the Attorney General may invite their\n\narguments, they have no right to request or demand a ruling or disclosure from the Attorney General,\n\nand no right to an administrative appeal. See TEX . GOV ’T CODE § 552.304. Requestors cannot be\n\nrequired to finish something they have no right to start. The requirement that a governmental body\n\nseek a ruling from the Attorney General when withholding requested information is a check on the\n\ngovernmental body, not a remedy for the requestor to exhaust. And again, the City’s view of Section\n\n552.321(a) would make the Attorney General’s ruling unreviewable.\n\n         The City argues that because information is generally “presumed to be subject to required\n\npublic disclosure” when a governmental body fails to timely request an Attorney General’s ruling,\n\nTEX . GOV ’T CODE § 552.302, the information should not be considered public when a ruling is\n\nrequested. But the premise cannot establish its converse. One may infer from a governmental\n\nbody’s failure to request a ruling that the body is not claiming an exclusion, else it would advance\n\nits position in compliance with prescribed procedures. See TEX . GOV ’T CODE § 552.301. One\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fcannot likewise infer that just because a governmental body properly seeks an Attorney General’s\n\nruling, its exclusion claim must be correct.\n\n       The Attorney General advises in an amicus brief that he does not claim exclusive jurisdiction\n\nto decide open records issues. Consistent with that position, at the time of the City’s request for a\n\nruling, as noted above, the Attorney General’s policy was not to rule on issues in litigation. See Tex.\n\nAtt’y Gen. OR2011-687. In reversing that policy, he does not claim the authority to rule without\n\ncourt review.\n\n       A requestor of information certainly has the choice to await the Attorney General’s decision.\n\nA governmental body may decide to release the requested information during the process and on\n\nreceipt of an adverse opinion from the Attorney General. Efficiency may counsel patience. But the\n\ngovernmental body is entitled to insist on its position to a final ruling, see TEX . GOV ’T CODE\n\n§ 552.324, and a requestor is not required to defer a suit for mandamus.\n\n       A court may decide, exercising sound discretion, to abate proceedings to await the Attorney\n\nGeneral’s ruling. The Attorney General characterizes its authority as akin to primary jurisdiction,\n\na prudential doctrine that applies when an agency is “staffed with experts trained in handling the\n\ncomplex problems in the agency’s purview” and there is a benefit to be “derived from [the] agency[]\n\nuniformly interpreting its laws, rules, and regulations.” Subaru of Am., Inc. v. David McDavid\n\nNissan, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1579863\"><a href=\"/opinion/1579863/subaru-of-america-v-david-mcdavid-nissan/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 221 (Tex. 2002). The Legislature has expressly charged the Attorney\n\nGeneral with maintaining “uniformity in the application, operation, and interpretation” of the PIA,\n\nTEX . GOV ’T CODE § 552.011, and the Office of the Attorney General is experienced in interpreting\n\nand applying the subchapter C exceptions. If the court determines that under the circumstances of\n\n                                                  5\n\fa particular case a decision from the Attorney General before adjudication of the merits of disclosure\n\nwould be beneficial and any delay would not impinge on a requestor’s right to information,\n\nabatement would be within the court’s discretion.\n\n       The court of appeals erred in dismissing Kallinen’s suit for want of jurisdiction.\n\nAccordingly, we grant the petition for review and, without hearing oral argument, reverse the court\n\nof appeals’ judgment and remand to that court for further proceedings in accordance with this\n\nopinion.
