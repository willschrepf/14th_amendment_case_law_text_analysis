LISD, Williams, Thomas, and\n\nAtkins appeal the district court's denial of their motion for\n\nsummary judgment based on their claim of qualified immunity.            We\n\ndismiss the appeal of the LISD for lack of appellate jurisdiction\n\nand reverse the denial of summary judgment for the remaining\n\ndefendants and render judgment in their favor.\n\n                               Background\n\n     On February 27, 1992, approximately 103 sixth graders from\n\nJames A. Whiteside Elementary School in Lubbock, Texas, visited the\n\n                                   1\n\fLubbock County Youth Center, a facility housing both the Lubbock\n\nCounty Probation Office and a detention center for minors between\n\nthe   ages   of   10   and   17   who   are   either   in   custody   awaiting\n\nadjudication on criminal offenses or being detained thereafter.\n\nWilliams and Thomas accompanied the children.\n\n      At the outset of the tour, Center employees explained to the\n\nchildren that the Center expected all visitors to comply with\n\nCenter rules concerning deportment and respect, and that they\n\nshould listen carefully and not talk inside the facility.               Center\n\npersonnel then divided the schoolchildren into groups, one of which\n\nconsisted of 15 boys, Williams, Thomas, and a Center employee,\n\nRicky Atkins.      As this group made its way through the facility\n\nAmeen Hassan was cautioned repeatedly for being inattentive and\n\ndisrespectful. When he persisted, Williams and Thomas asked Atkins\n\nto place him in a holding room so that the other students could\n\ncontinue the tour without distraction.1\n\n      Atkins took Hassan to a room used to hold juveniles brought to\n\nthe facility pending retrieval by their parents or admission into\n\nthe Center.    The room, located at the front of the facility outside\n\nthe detention area, contained a bed and a toilet, but was otherwise\n\nbare.     Its metal door had a glass partition.         Hassan was locked in\n\nthis room for approximately 50 minutes, monitored continuously by\n\nCenter employees and Thomas who returned to the area to check on\n\n\n      1\n      The defendants describe the facility as a series of locked\nsections which must be keyed to enter or exit any section.\nAtkins apparently escorted Hassan back through several sections\nto a holding room, also described as an \"intake\" room.\n\n                                        2\n\fhim.\n\n       When the other students finished their tour, school officials\n\nled them by the room in which Hassan was waiting and allegedly told\n\nthem to look at Hassan.         Thomas then escorted Hassan to the bus\n\nwhere he joined the other students for the return trip to Whiteside\n\nElementary.      Once back at the school, Thomas had Hassan tell the\n\nclass about his behavior and the resulting punishment, informing\n\nthem what, if anything, he had learned from the experience.\n\n       The next day Williams met with Hassan's parents to explain the\n\nincident. He apologized for placing Hassan in a situation of which\n\nthey did not approve, but insisted that the trip had been a\n\npositive experience for Hassan. Manifesting disagreement, Hassan's\n\nparents removed him from Whiteside Elementary and enrolled him in\n\nanother school.\n\n       The instant action under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 followed, claiming\n\nthat LISD, Williams, Thomas, and Atkins violated Ameen Hassan's\n\nfourth amendment right against unreasonable seizures, fourteenth\n\namendment due process rights, and eighth amendment right to be free\n\nfrom cruel and unusual punishment.2         The complaint also claims that\n\nThomas violated Hassan's first amendment right to free association\n\nby ordering Hassan to leave the school grounds when he went there\n\nto play with his friends after transferring schools.            The district\n\ncourt      dismissed   the   eighth   and   first   amendment   claims   under\n\n       2\n      The amended original complaint also alleges false\nimprisonment, but Hassan maintains that all of his claims are\nbased on federal law and we accordingly treat the false\nimprisonment claim as part of the fourth amendment seizure claim.\n\n\n                                        3\n\fFed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6);           Hassan did not appeal those dismissals.\n\n       The LISD, Williams, Thomas, and Atkins moved for summary\n\njudgment on the fourth and fourteenth amendment claims on two\n\ngrounds:          (1) the LISD could not be held liable because its\n\nemployees did not act pursuant to an official policy or custom, and\n\n(2) the individual defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.\n\nThe district court denied the motions for summary judgment and the\n\ndefendants timely appealed.\n\n                                       Analysis\n\n           At the outset, we note that we have jurisdiction over the\n\nappeal by Williams, Thomas, and Atkins of the district court's\n\ndenial of qualified immunity under Mitchell v. Forsyth,3 which held\n\nthat such denials, to the extent that they turn on a question of\n\nlaw,       were    final    judgments      for    the    purposes     of   appellate\n\njurisdiction.          The LISD appeals the district court's denial of its\n\ndefense of absolute immunity to Hassan's apparent state law false\n\nimprisonment claim.4         Hassan, however, maintains in brief that all\n\nof   his     claims      arise     under   federal      law.     Because    of   this\n\nclarification, the LISD no longer advances its claim of absolute\n\nimmunity.          LISD offers no other jurisdictional basis for its\n\nappeal.           We   therefore    dismiss      same   for    lack   of   appellate\n\njurisdiction.\n\n       3\n      472 U.S. 511, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985)\n(allowing interlocutory appeal of denial of qualified immunity\nunder the collateral order doctrine).\n       4\n      See Loya v. Texas Dep't of Corrections, 878 F.2d 860 (5th\nCir.1989) (allowing entity to appeal denial of absolute\nimmunity).\n\n                                            4\n\f          We review a district court's denial of summary judgment de\n\nnovo, applying the same standard as the district court.                 \"Summary\n\njudgment is proper when no issue of material fact exists and the\n\nmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.                         In\n\ndetermining whether summary judgment was proper, all fact questions\n\nare   viewed    in    the    light   most   favorable   to    the    non-movant.\n\nQuestions of law are reviewed ... de novo.\"5\n\n          In examining the claims of qualified immunity on summary\n\njudgment,     we     first   inquire   whether   Hassan      has    alleged   \"the\n\nviolation of a clearly established constitutional right.\"6                    For a\n\nright to be clearly established, there does not have to be a prior\n\ncase directly on point, but the unlawfulness of the precipitating\n\nacts must be apparent in light of the existing law.7                     We then\n\ninquire whether the defendants' conduct was objectively reasonable\n\n\" \"in light of the legal rules clearly established at the time' of\n\n      5\n      Moore v. Eli Lilly & Co., 990 F.2d 812, 815 (5th Cir.)\n(citations omitted), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 467,\n126 L.Ed.2d 419 (1993).\n      6\n      Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226, 231, 111 S.Ct. 1789, 1793,\n114 L.Ed.2d 277 (1991) (outlining two step process for evaluating\nqualified immunity claims).\n      7\n      Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97\nL.Ed.2d 523 (1987). Hassan insists his rights under the fourth\nand fourteenth amendments were clearly established at the time of\nthe incident and that the first inquiry is therefore satisfied.\nThe determination whether a right is \"clearly established\" is a\nmore particularized inquiry than Hassan suggests; otherwise,\nplaintiffs could \"convert the rule of qualified immunity ... into\na rule of virtually unqualified liability.\" Id. at 639, 107\nS.Ct. at 3039. The proper inquiry is whether a reasonable\nofficial would know that the act in question was unlawful. Id.\nat 640, 107 S.Ct. at 3039. It necessarily follows that a right\nis not clearly established if there is no actual constitutional\nviolation alleged. Siegert.\n\n                                        5\n\fthe incident in issue.\"8          Thus, even if we find a violation of\n\nHassan's constitutional       rights,     the   individual   defendants   are\n\nimmune from liability if reasonable public officials could differ\n\non the lawfulness of their actions.9        The court need not reach this\n\nsecond inquiry, however, if Hassan fails to tender the requisite\n\nsummary judgment evidence that the individual defendants violated\n\na clearly established constitutional right.10\n\n         In his first claim, Hassan alleges that the acts of Williams,\n\nThomas, and Atkins violated his fourth amendment right to be free\n\nfrom an unreasonable seizure. This constitutional right extends to\n\nseizures by or at the direction of school officials, but whether\n\nsuch a seizure is unreasonable depends on all relevant contextual\n\ncircumstances.11       The Supreme Court has recognized the unique\n\nbackdrop that schools present for the operation of the fourth\n\namendment, specifically noting that \"the preservation of order and\n\na proper educational environment requires close supervision of\n\nschoolchildren, as well as the enforcement of rules against conduct\n\nthat would be perfectly permissible if undertaken by an adult.\"12\n\nThus, while school officials are subject to the limitations of the\n\n\n     8\n      Spann v.

The   two   school   officials   supervising    the   trip,\n\nWilliams and Thomas, were charged with the care and control of all\n\nof the students.         The detention center contained both older and\n\nyounger youths awaiting adjudication for criminal offenses, or\n\nresiding     at   the    center   following   adjudication   for    criminal\n\noffenses;     these surroundings understandably heightened the need\n\nfor a disciplined attitude by the visiting students to ensure their\n\nsafety and to maintain order among the residents of the facility.\n\nIn this setting Hassan misbehaved.14          We are fully cognizant that\n\nteachers routinely find it necessary to punish such behavior.\n\nWilliams and Thomas, aware of their responsibilities, responded to\n\nHassan's behavior by separating and isolating him until the other\n\nstudents had finished their tour. We entertain no doubt that these\n\nactions properly furthered the mandated maintenance of discipline\n\nwithin the touring group, thus making it possible for the other\n\n     13\n      Edwards v. Rees, 883 F.2d 882 (10th Cir.1989) (applying\nreasonableness test announced in T.L.O. for school searches to a\nschool seizure case); Hayes v. Unified Sch. Dist., 377, 669\nF.Supp. 1519 (D.Kan.1987) (applying T.L.O. framework to seizure\nclaim of student), rev'd on other grounds, 877 F.2d 809 (10th\nCir.1989).\n     14\n      Hassan concedes in his affidavit that he was uncooperative\nand was reprimanded by Thomas.\n\n                                        7\n\fstudents to continue their valuable educational experience.15             We\n\nconclude that Hassan's seizure was reasonably justified at its\n\ninception.\n\n      The placement of Hassan in the holding room at the detention\n\ncenter was     also   reasonably   related   in   scope   to   the   relevant\n\ncircumstances, thus justifying the action.         The presence of other\n\npotentially dangerous juveniles militated against Hassan being left\n\nalone in an easily accessible area.      The room into which Hassan was\n\nplaced both protected him and allowed for his easy supervision.\n\nFurther, this restriction of his freedom of movement lasted no\n\nlonger than absolutely necessary.16      He was released from the room\n\nas soon as the other students completed their visit.            Under these\n\ncircumstances, we find no violation of any of Hassan's clearly\n\nestablished constitutional rights by either Williams or Thomas.\n\n          Nor do we perceive anything in Atkins' role as a Center\n\nemployee, or his actions in this incident, that warrants the\n\n\n     15\n      We reject the suggestion that the location of this seizure\nheightens the otherwise relaxed fourth amendment standards\napplicable to school searches and seizures. School field trips\noften present greater, not lesser, challenges to school officials\ntrying to maintain order and discipline than do the relatively\norderly confines of a school. See Webb v. McCullough, 828 F.2d\n1151 (6th Cir.1987) (holding that the greater challenges\npresented by field trips justify in loco parentis authority as\nwell as official authority).\n     16\n      While the duration of a seizure is normally irrelevant to\nthe determination of its constitutionality, see United States v.\nBrignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. 873, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607\n(1975), the Supreme Court's command in T.L.O. to examine all of\nthe circumstances in the context of school searches and seizures\nleads us to conclude that the duration of a seizure is relevant\nto its constitutionality in the school setting. See Edwards\n(noting seizure of student lasted for 20 minutes).\n\n                                     8\n\fapplication of a different standard to his conduct.                     He acted at\n\nthe behest of school officials and at all times his control over\n\nHassan remained subject to the direction of Thomas and Williams.\n\nThere is no summary judgment evidence that Atkins used the school\n\ntrip as a subterfuge for incarcerating Hassan;17                      rather, the\n\nevidence supports the conclusion that Atkins acted reasonably.                     We\n\ntherefore conclude that Hassan has not shown that Atkins violated\n\na clearly established fourth amendment right.\n\n          Hassan    also     claims    that     Williams,   Thomas,     and   Atkins\n\n\"incarcerated\" him in a \"jail cell\" in violation of the due process\n\nclause of the fourteenth amendment.                It is well established that\n\nchildren do        not   \"   \"shed    their     constitutional   rights'      at   the\n\nschoolhouse door\"18 and that deprivations of liberty in the school\n\ncontext may implicate both procedural and substantive due process\n\nliberty interests.19         These rights, however, are circumscribed by\n\nthe need     for    effective        and   often   immediate   action    by   school\n\n\n     17\n      See Martens v.

This action made it\n\npossible for the other children to finish the planned visit to the\n\nfacility.     As noted above, Hassan's restraint was terminated\n\nimmediately upon cessation of its need. Under these circumstances,\n\nwe are persuaded beyond peradventure that the actions of Thomas,\n\nWilliams, and Atkins amount to a de minimis deprivation of Hassan's\n\nliberty that does not implicate either procedural or substantive\n\ndue process guarantees.    We also conclude that Hassan's punishment\n\nwas within the range of discretion accorded school officials and\n\nthat the punishment bore a rational relationship to the goal of\n\n     23\n      Cf. Ysleta (finding physical restraint of child by tying\nhim to chair to be unconstitutional).\n     24\n      The school officials clearly retained ultimate authority\nover Hassan at all times, even though they delegated that\nauthority to Atkins to detain and watch Hassan while the other\nchildren completed the tour.\n\n                                  11\n\fproviding a valuable and safe educational experience for the other\n\n102 children.\n\n     Hassan insists, and we do not disagree, that more appropriate\n\nmeans of punishment were available to the school officials.          This\n\nargument,     however,   lacks    persuasive   force.    That   a   better\n\npunishment may have been available does not establish that the\n\npunishment administered was unconstitutional. To so hold would run\n\ncounter to the Supreme Court's affirmance of \"the comprehensive\n\nauthority of the States and of school officials, consistent with\n\nfundamental constitutional safeguards, to prescribe and control\n\nconduct in the schools.\"25       Perceiving no summary judgment evidence\n\nof a constitutional violation, we conclude, as we must, that there\n\nis no violation of a clearly established constitutional right.          We\n\ntherefore need inquire no further.             The trial court erred in\n\ndenying qualified immunity to Thomas, Williams, and Atkins.\n\n     Accordingly, we REVERSE the denial of summary judgment for\n\nWilliams, Thomas, and Atkins and render judgment in their favor.\n\nThe trial court is to enter the appropriate decree.       We DISMISS the\n\nappeal of LISD for lack of appellate jurisdiction.\n\n     DISMISSED IN PART, REVERSED AND RENDERED IN PART.\n\n\n\n\n     25\n          Tinker, 393 U.S. at 507, 89 S.Ct. at 737.\n\n                                      12\n\f",

LISD, Williams, Thomas, and Atkins appeal the district court's denial of their motion for summary judgment based on their claim of qualified immunity.  We dismiss the appeal of the LISD for lack of appellate jurisdiction and reverse the denial of summary judgment for the remaining defendants and render judgment in their favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 27, 1992, approximately 103 sixth graders from James A. Whiteside Elementary School in Lubbock, Texas, visited the Lubbock County Youth Center, a facility housing both the Lubbock County Probation Office and a detention center for minors between the ages of 10 and 17 who are either in custody awaiting adjudication on criminal offenses or being detained thereafter.  Williams and Thomas accompanied the children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset of the tour, Center employees explained to the children that the Center expected all visitors to comply with Center rules concerning deportment and respect, and that they should listen carefully and not talk inside the facility.  Center personnel then divided the schoolchildren into groups, one of which consisted of 15 boys, Williams, Thomas, and a Center employee, Ricky Atkins.  As this group made its way through the facility Ameen Hassan was cautioned repeatedly for being inattentive and disrespectful.  When he persisted, Williams and Thomas asked Atkins to place him in a holding room so that the other students could continue the tour without distraction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Atkins took Hassan to a room used to hold juveniles brought to the facility pending retrieval by their parents or admission into the Center.  The room, located at the front of the facility outside the detention area, contained a bed and a toilet, but was otherwise bare.  Its metal door had a glass partition.  Hassan was locked in this room for approximately 50 minutes, monitored continuously by Center employees and Thomas who returned to the area to check on him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the other students finished their tour, school officials led them by the room in which Hassan was waiting and allegedly told them to look at Hassan.  Thomas then escorted Hassan to the bus where he joined the other students for the return trip to Whiteside Elementary.  Once back at the school, Thomas had Hassan tell the class about his behavior and the resulting punishment, informing them what, if anything, he had learned from the experience.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day Williams met with Hassan's parents to explain the incident.  He apologized for placing Hassan in a situation of which they did not approve, but insisted that the trip had been a positive experience for Hassan.  Manifesting disagreement, Hassan's parents removed him from Whiteside Elementary and enrolled him in another school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instant action under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 followed, claiming that LISD, Williams, Thomas, and Atkins violated Ameen Hassan's fourth amendment right against unreasonable seizures, fourteenth amendment due process rights, and eighth amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The complaint also claims that Thomas violated Hassan's first amendment right to free association by ordering Hassan to leave the school grounds when he went there to play with his friends after transferring schools.  The district court dismissed the eighth and first amendment claims under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6);  Hassan did not appeal those dismissals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The LISD, Williams, Thomas, and Atkins moved for summary judgment on the fourth and fourteenth amendment claims on two grounds:  (1) the LISD could not be held liable because its employees did not act pursuant to an official policy or custom, and (2) the individual defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.  The district court denied the motions for summary judgment and the defendants timely appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, we note that we have jurisdiction over the appeal by Williams, Thomas, and Atkins of the district court's denial of qualified immunity under Mitchell v. Forsyth,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> which held that such denials, to the extent that they turn on a question of law, were final judgments for the purposes of appellate jurisdiction.  The LISD appeals the district court's denial of its defense of absolute immunity to Hassan's apparent state law false imprisonment claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Hassan, however, maintains in brief that all of his claims arise under federal law.  Because of this clarification, the LISD no longer advances its claim of absolute immunity.  LISD offers no other jurisdictional basis for its appeal.  We therefore dismiss same for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's denial of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard as the district court.  \"Summary judgment is proper when no issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  In determining whether summary judgment was proper, all fact questions are viewed in the light most favorable to the non-movant.  Questions of law are reviewed ... de novo.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In examining the claims of qualified immunity on summary judgment, we first inquire whether Hassan has alleged \"the violation of a clearly established constitutional right.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  For a right to be clearly established, there does not have to be a prior case directly on point, but the unlawfulness of the precipitating acts must be apparent in light of the existing law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  We then inquire whether the defendants' conduct was objectively reasonable \" 'in light of the legal rules clearly established at the time' of the incident in issue.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Thus, even if we find a violation of Hassan's constitutional rights, the individual defendants are immune from liability if reasonable public officials could differ on the lawfulness of their actions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The court need not reach this second inquiry, however, if Hassan fails to tender the requisite summary judgment evidence that the individual defendants violated a clearly established constitutional right.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his first claim, Hassan alleges that the acts of Williams, Thomas, and Atkins violated his fourth amendment right to be free from an unreasonable seizure.  This constitutional right extends to seizures by or at the direction of school officials, but whether such a seizure is unreasonable depends on all relevant contextual circumstances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  The Supreme Court has recognized the unique backdrop that schools present for the operation of the fourth amendment, specifically noting that \"the preservation of order and a proper educational environment requires close supervision of schoolchildren, as well as the enforcement of rules against conduct that would be perfectly permissible if undertaken by an adult.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Thus, while school officials are subject to the limitations of the fourth amendment, the reasonableness of seizures must be determined in light of all of the circumstances, with particular attention being paid to whether the seizure was justified at its inception and reasonable in scope.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the instant seizure, Hassan was touring a juvenile detention center as part of a school-sponsored educational field trip.  The two school officials supervising the trip, Williams and Thomas, were charged with the care and control of all of the students.  The detention center contained both older and younger youths awaiting adjudication for criminal offenses, or residing at the center following adjudication for criminal offenses;  these surroundings understandably heightened the need for a disciplined attitude by the visiting students to ensure their safety and to maintain order among the residents of the facility.  In this setting Hassan misbehaved.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  We are fully cognizant that teachers routinely find it necessary to punish such behavior.  Williams and Thomas, aware of their responsibilities, responded to Hassan's behavior by separating and isolating him until the other students had finished their tour.  We entertain no doubt that these actions properly furthered the mandated maintenance of discipline within the touring group, thus making it possible for the other students to continue their valuable educational experience.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  We conclude that Hassan's seizure was reasonably justified at its inception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The placement of Hassan in the holding room at the detention center was also reasonably related in scope to the relevant circumstances, thus justifying the action.  The presence of other potentially dangerous juveniles militated against Hassan being left alone in an easily accessible area.  The room into which Hassan was placed both protected him and allowed for his easy supervision.  Further, this restriction of his freedom of movement lasted no longer than absolutely necessary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  He was released from the room as soon as the other students completed their visit.  Under these circumstances, we find no violation of any of Hassan's clearly established constitutional rights by either Williams or Thomas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do we perceive anything in Atkins' role as a Center employee, or his actions in this incident, that warrants the application of a different standard to his conduct.  He acted at the behest of school officials and at all times his control over Hassan remained subject to the direction of Thomas and Williams.  There is no summary judgment evidence that Atkins used the school trip as a subterfuge for incarcerating Hassan;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  rather, the evidence supports the conclusion that Atkins acted reasonably.  We therefore conclude that Hassan has not shown that Atkins violated a clearly established fourth amendment right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hassan also claims that Williams, Thomas, and Atkins \"incarcerated\" him in a \"jail cell\" in violation of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.  It is well established that children do not \" 'shed their constitutional rights' at the schoolhouse door\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> and that deprivations of liberty in the school context may implicate both procedural and substantive due process liberty interests.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>  These rights, however, are circumscribed by the need for effective and often immediate action by school officials to maintain order and discipline.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a>  De minimis or trivial deprivations of liberty in the course of the disciplining of a student do not implicate procedural due process requirements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a>  Likewise, punishment does not implicate substantive due process concerns unless the action is \"arbitrary, capricious, or wholly unrelated to the legitimate state goal of maintaining an atmosphere conducive to learning.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We perceive no constitutional violation inherent in the detention of Hassan in the Center's intake room.  The room was relatively large with 80 square feet of space and was furnished with a toilet and a bed and had a glass partition in the door.  Although Hassan could not leave the room, he was not otherwise physically restrained.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>  He remained under adult supervision and protection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do we equate the request of Williams and Thomas that Atkins physically remove Hassan so that the other students could proceed with their educational field trip with the turning of Hassan over to the state authorities for incarceration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a>  Hassan was not placed with the residents of the facility and the intake room was not located within the detention area.  Putting Hassan in that room was done in response to his behavior and was a measure of punishment in a safe and supervised manner.  This action made it possible for the other children to finish the planned visit to the facility.  As noted above, Hassan's restraint was terminated immediately upon cessation of its need.  Under these circumstances, we are persuaded beyond peradventure that the actions of Thomas, Williams, and Atkins amount to a de minimis deprivation of Hassan's liberty that does not implicate either procedural or substantive due process guarantees.  We also conclude that Hassan's punishment was within the range of discretion accorded school officials and that the punishment bore a rational relationship to the goal of providing a valuable and safe educational experience for the other 102 children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hassan insists, and we do not disagree, that more appropriate means of punishment were available to the school officials.  This argument, however, lacks persuasive force.  That a better punishment may have been available does not establish that the punishment administered was unconstitutional.  To so hold would run counter to the Supreme Court's affirmance of \"the comprehensive authority of the States and of school officials, consistent with fundamental constitutional safeguards, to prescribe and control conduct in the schools.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a>  Perceiving no summary judgment evidence of a constitutional violation, we conclude, as we must, that there is no violation of a clearly established constitutional right.  We therefore need inquire no further.  The trial court erred in denying qualified immunity to Thomas, Williams, and Atkins.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we REVERSE the denial of summary judgment for Williams, Thomas, and Atkins and render judgment in their favor.  The trial court is to enter the appropriate decree.  We DISMISS the appeal of LISD for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DISMISSED IN PART, REVERSED AND RENDERED IN PART.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The defendants describe the facility as a series of locked sections which must be keyed to enter or exit any section.

LISD, Williams, Thomas, and Atkins appeal the district court's denial of their motion for summary judgment based on their claim of qualified immunity.  We dismiss the appeal of the LISD for lack of appellate jurisdiction and reverse the denial of summary judgment for the remaining defendants and render judgment in their favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 27, 1992, approximately 103 sixth graders from James A. Whiteside Elementary School in Lubbock, Texas, visited the Lubbock County Youth Center, a facility housing both the Lubbock County Probation Office and a detention center for minors between the ages of 10 and 17 who are either in custody awaiting adjudication on criminal offenses or being detained thereafter.  Williams and Thomas accompanied the children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset of the tour, Center employees explained to the children that the Center expected all visitors to comply with Center rules concerning deportment and respect, and that they should listen carefully and not talk inside the facility.  Center personnel then divided the schoolchildren into groups, one of which consisted of 15 boys, Williams, Thomas, and a Center employee, Ricky Atkins.  As this group made its way through the facility Ameen Hassan was cautioned repeatedly for being inattentive and disrespectful.  When he persisted, Williams and Thomas asked Atkins to place him in a holding room so that the other students could continue the tour without distraction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Atkins took Hassan to a room used to hold juveniles brought to the facility pending retrieval by their parents or admission into the Center.  The room, located at the front of the facility outside the detention area, contained a bed and a toilet, but was otherwise bare.  Its metal door had a glass partition.  Hassan was locked in this room for approximately 50 minutes, monitored continuously by Center employees and Thomas who returned to the area to check on him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the other students finished their tour, school officials led them by the room in which Hassan was waiting and allegedly told them to look at Hassan.  Thomas then escorted Hassan to the bus where he joined the other students for the return trip to Whiteside Elementary.  Once back at the school, Thomas had Hassan tell the class about his behavior and the resulting punishment, informing them what, if anything, he had learned from the experience.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day Williams met with Hassan's parents to explain the incident.  He apologized for placing Hassan in a situation of which they did not approve, but insisted that the trip had been a positive experience for Hassan.  Manifesting disagreement, Hassan's parents removed him from Whiteside Elementary and enrolled him in another school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instant action under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 followed, claiming that LISD, Williams, Thomas, and Atkins violated Ameen Hassan's fourth amendment right against unreasonable seizures, fourteenth amendment due process rights, and eighth amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The complaint also claims that Thomas violated Hassan's first amendment right to free association by ordering Hassan to leave the school grounds when he went there to play with his friends after transferring schools.  The district court dismissed the eighth and first amendment claims under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6);  Hassan did not appeal those dismissals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The LISD, Williams, Thomas, and Atkins moved for summary judgment on the fourth and fourteenth amendment claims on two grounds:  (1) the LISD could not be held liable because its employees did not act pursuant to an official policy or custom, and (2) the individual defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.  The district court denied the motions for summary judgment and the defendants timely appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, we note that we have jurisdiction over the appeal by Williams, Thomas, and Atkins of the district court's denial of qualified immunity under Mitchell v. Forsyth,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> which held that such denials, to the extent that they turn on a question of law, were final judgments for the purposes of appellate jurisdiction.  The LISD appeals the district court's denial of its defense of absolute immunity to Hassan's apparent state law false imprisonment claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Hassan, however, maintains in brief that all of his claims arise under federal law.  Because of this clarification, the LISD no longer advances its claim of absolute immunity.  LISD offers no other jurisdictional basis for its appeal.  We therefore dismiss same for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's denial of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard as the district court.  \"Summary judgment is proper when no issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  In determining whether summary judgment was proper, all fact questions are viewed in the light most favorable to the non-movant.  Questions of law are reviewed ... de novo.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In examining the claims of qualified immunity on summary judgment, we first inquire whether Hassan has alleged \"the violation of a clearly established constitutional right.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  For a right to be clearly established, there does not have to be a prior case directly on point, but the unlawfulness of the precipitating acts must be apparent in light of the existing law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  We then inquire whether the defendants' conduct was objectively reasonable \" 'in light of the legal rules clearly established at the time' of the incident in issue.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Thus, even if we find a violation of Hassan's constitutional rights, the individual defendants are immune from liability if reasonable public officials could differ on the lawfulness of their actions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The court need not reach this second inquiry, however, if Hassan fails to tender the requisite summary judgment evidence that the individual defendants violated a clearly established constitutional right.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his first claim, Hassan alleges that the acts of Williams, Thomas, and Atkins violated his fourth amendment right to be free from an unreasonable seizure.  This constitutional right extends to seizures by or at the direction of school officials, but whether such a seizure is unreasonable depends on all relevant contextual circumstances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  The Supreme Court has recognized the unique backdrop that schools present for the operation of the fourth amendment, specifically noting that \"the preservation of order and a proper educational environment requires close supervision of schoolchildren, as well as the enforcement of rules against conduct that would be perfectly permissible if undertaken by an adult.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Thus, while school officials are subject to the limitations of the fourth amendment, the reasonableness of seizures must be determined in light of all of the circumstances, with particular attention being paid to whether the seizure was justified at its inception and reasonable in scope.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the instant seizure, Hassan was touring a juvenile detention center as part of a school-sponsored educational field trip.  The two school officials supervising the trip, Williams and Thomas, were charged with the care and control of all of the students.  The detention center contained both older and younger youths awaiting adjudication for criminal offenses, or residing at the center following adjudication for criminal offenses;  these surroundings understandably heightened the need for a disciplined attitude by the visiting students to ensure their safety and to maintain order among the residents of the facility.  In this setting Hassan misbehaved.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  We are fully cognizant that teachers routinely find it necessary to punish such behavior.  Williams and Thomas, aware of their responsibilities, responded to Hassan's behavior by separating and isolating him until the other students had finished their tour.  We entertain no doubt that these actions properly furthered the mandated maintenance of discipline within the touring group, thus making it possible for the other students to continue their valuable educational experience.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  We conclude that Hassan's seizure was reasonably justified at its inception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The placement of Hassan in the holding room at the detention center was also reasonably related in scope to the relevant circumstances, thus justifying the action.  The presence of other potentially dangerous juveniles militated against Hassan being left alone in an easily accessible area.  The room into which Hassan was placed both protected him and allowed for his easy supervision.  Further, this restriction of his freedom of movement lasted no longer than absolutely necessary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  He was released from the room as soon as the other students completed their visit.  Under these circumstances, we find no violation of any of Hassan's clearly established constitutional rights by either Williams or Thomas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do we perceive anything in Atkins' role as a Center employee, or his actions in this incident, that warrants the application of a different standard to his conduct.  He acted at the behest of school officials and at all times his control over Hassan remained subject to the direction of Thomas and Williams.  There is no summary judgment evidence that Atkins used the school trip as a subterfuge for incarcerating Hassan;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  rather, the evidence supports the conclusion that Atkins acted reasonably.  We therefore conclude that Hassan has not shown that Atkins violated a clearly established fourth amendment right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hassan also claims that Williams, Thomas, and Atkins \"incarcerated\" him in a \"jail cell\" in violation of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.  It is well established that children do not \" 'shed their constitutional rights' at the schoolhouse door\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> and that deprivations of liberty in the school context may implicate both procedural and substantive due process liberty interests.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>  These rights, however, are circumscribed by the need for effective and often immediate action by school officials to maintain order and discipline.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a>  De minimis or trivial deprivations of liberty in the course of the disciplining of a student do not implicate procedural due process requirements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a>  Likewise, punishment does not implicate substantive due process concerns unless the action is \"arbitrary, capricious, or wholly unrelated to the legitimate state goal of maintaining an atmosphere conducive to learning.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We perceive no constitutional violation inherent in the detention of Hassan in the Center's intake room.  The room was relatively large with 80 square feet of space and was furnished with a toilet and a bed and had a glass partition in the door.  Although Hassan could not leave the room, he was not otherwise physically restrained.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>  He remained under adult supervision and protection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do we equate the request of Williams and Thomas that Atkins physically remove Hassan so that the other students could proceed with their educational field trip with the turning of Hassan over to the state authorities for incarceration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a>  Hassan was not placed with the residents of the facility and the intake room was not located within the detention area.  Putting Hassan in that room was done in response to his behavior and was a measure of punishment in a safe and supervised manner.  This action made it possible for the other children to finish the planned visit to the facility.  As noted above, Hassan's restraint was terminated immediately upon cessation of its need.  Under these circumstances, we are persuaded beyond peradventure that the actions of Thomas, Williams, and Atkins amount to a de minimis deprivation of Hassan's liberty that does not implicate either procedural or substantive due process guarantees.  We also conclude that Hassan's punishment was within the range of discretion accorded school officials and that the punishment bore a rational relationship to the goal of providing a valuable and safe educational experience for the other 102 children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hassan insists, and we do not disagree, that more appropriate means of punishment were available to the school officials.  This argument, however, lacks persuasive force.  That a better punishment may have been available does not establish that the punishment administered was unconstitutional.  To so hold would run counter to the Supreme Court's affirmance of \"the comprehensive authority of the States and of school officials, consistent with fundamental constitutional safeguards, to prescribe and control conduct in the schools.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a>  Perceiving no summary judgment evidence of a constitutional violation, we conclude, as we must, that there is no violation of a clearly established constitutional right.  We therefore need inquire no further.  The trial court erred in denying qualified immunity to Thomas, Williams, and Atkins.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we REVERSE the denial of summary judgment for Williams, Thomas, and Atkins and render judgment in their favor.  The trial court is to enter the appropriate decree.  We DISMISS the appeal of LISD for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DISMISSED IN PART, REVERSED AND RENDERED IN PART.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The defendants describe the facility as a series of locked sections which must be keyed to enter or exit any section.

Hassan insists his rights under the fourth and fourteenth amendments were clearly established at the time of the incident and that the first inquiry is therefore satisfied.  The determination whether a right is \"clearly established\" is a more particularized inquiry than Hassan suggests;  otherwise, plaintiffs could \"convert the rule of qualified immunity ... into a rule of virtually unqualified liability.\"  Id. at 639, 107 S.Ct. at 3039.   The proper inquiry is whether a reasonable official would know that the act in question was unlawful.  Id. at 640, 107 S.Ct. at 3039.   It necessarily follows that a right is not clearly established if there is no actual constitutional violation alleged.
