class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>I.  Introduction</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          The\r\nTexas Department of Criminal Justice (the Department) appeals the trial court’s\r\npartial denial of its plea to the jurisdiction in the wrongful death lawsuit\r\nfiled against it by Appellee Bonnie Ledbetter, Individually and as\r\nRepresentative of the Estate of John Ledbetter, and Freddie Ledbetter, Callie\r\nLedbetter, Amber Bogusch, Ashley Ledbetter, and John Ledbetter, Jr.\r\n(collectively, Ledbetter).  The Department contends in one issue that the trial\r\ncourt erred by denying the Department’s plea to the jurisdiction because there\r\nis no evidence that the use of tangible personal property proximately caused\r\nJohn Ledbetter’s death.  We affirm.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>II. \r\nProcedural History</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Ledbetter\r\nfiled this suit in June 2010.  She alleges in her fifth amended petition that\r\nher son John Ledbetter (John) died while in the Department’s custody and that\r\nthe Department is liable for his death because the Department’s employees used\r\nor misused a transport van, handcuffs, and restraints.  More specifically,\r\nLedbetter alleges that on June 27, 2008, John was not coherent and vomited in\r\nhis cell.  Department correctional officers transported John by van to another\r\nprison facility for evaluation and did not call for an ambulance so that John\r\ncould be taken to a hospital.  Prior to laying John on the backseat of the van,\r\nthe officers placed him in handcuffs and belly and ankle cuffs with a chain\r\nrunning between his hands, belly chain, and ankles.  Ledbetter alleges that,\r\nbecause of the restraints, John “could not move him self as needed to take care\r\nof himself when vomiting.”  Ledbetter further alleges that “[w]hen John arrived\r\nat the Robertson Unit, the nurses immediately saw that John was not breathing\r\nand started CPR[,] but it was too late.  The misuse of the restraints, which\r\nwere placed on John by employees, agents and servants of [the Department] . . .\r\n[was] a direct and proximate cause of John’s death.”  “John died because he\r\naspirated vomit.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          The\r\nDepartment filed its plea to the jurisdiction in September 2011, and the trial\r\ncourt conducted a hearing in February 2012.  The appellate record does not\r\ncontain a written response by Ledbetter, but we note that there are several\r\nwitness statements attached to Ledbetter’s fifth amended petition.  The trial\r\ncourt granted the Department’s plea to the jurisdiction in part as to\r\nLedbetter’s allegations concerning the use or misuse of the transport van but\r\nalso denied the plea to the jurisdiction in part.  As to the partial denial,\r\nthe trial court’s order states that “[t]he case will proceed under the Texas\r\nTort Claims Act solely predicated upon the alleged use or misuse of\r\nrestraints.”  This interlocutory appeal by the Department followed.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[2]</span></span></span> \r\n<i>See</i> Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 51.014(a)(8) (West Supp.\r\n2012).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>III. \r\nStandard of Review</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Whether\r\nthe trial court has subject-matter jurisdiction is a question of law that we\r\nreview de novo.  <i>Tex. Natural Res. Conservation Comm’n v. IT-Davy</i>, 74\r\nS.W.3d 849, 855 (Tex. 2002).  A plea to the jurisdiction is a dilatory plea\r\nthat challenges the trial court’s subject-matter jurisdiction.  <i>Bland Indep.\r\nSch. Dist. v. Blue</i>, 34 S.W.3d 547, 554 (Tex. 2000).  It is used to defeat a\r\ncause of action without regard to whether the claims asserted have merit.  <i>Id.</i></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          The\r\nplaintiff has the burden of alleging facts that affirmatively establish the\r\ntrial court’s subject-matter jurisdiction.  <i>Tex. Ass’n of Bus. v. Tex. Air\r\nControl Bd.</i>, 852 S.W.2d 440, 446 (Tex. 1993).  We construe the pleadings\r\nliberally in favor of the plaintiff, look to the pleader’s intent, and accept\r\nthe pleadings’ factual allegations as true.  <i>Tex. Dep’t of Parks &amp;\r\nWildlife v. Miranda</i>, 133 S.W.3d 217, 226 (Tex. 2004).  If, as in this case,\r\na plea to the jurisdiction challenges the existence of jurisdictional facts, we\r\nconsider relevant evidence submitted by the parties that is necessary to\r\nresolve the jurisdictional issues.  <i>Id.</i> at 227; <i>Bland</i>, 34 S.W.3d\r\nat 555.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          The\r\nplea to the jurisdiction standard generally mirrors that of a traditional\r\nmotion for summary judgment.  <i>Miranda</i>, 133 S.W.3d at 228; <i>see </i>Tex.\r\nR. Civ. P. 166a(c).  The governmental unit is required to meet the summary\r\njudgment standard of proof for its assertion that the trial court lacks\r\njurisdiction.  <i>Miranda</i>, 133 S.W.3d at 228.  Once the governmental unit\r\nmeets its burden, the plaintiff is then required to show there is a disputed\r\nmaterial fact regarding the jurisdictional issue.  <i>Id.</i>  We take as true\r\nall evidence favorable to the nonmovant, and we indulge every reasonable\r\ninference and resolve any doubts in the nonmovant’s favor.  <i>Wise Reg’l\r\nHealth Sys. v. Brittain</i>, 268 S.W.3d 799, 805 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2008, no\r\npet.) (citing <i>Miranda</i>, 133 S.W.3d at 228).  If the evidence creates a\r\nfact question regarding jurisdiction, the trial court must deny the plea to the\r\njurisdiction and leave its resolution to the factfinder.  <i>Miranda</i>, 133\r\nS.W.3d at 227–28.  But if the evidence is undisputed or fails to raise a fact\r\nquestion on the jurisdictional issue, the trial court rules on the plea to the\r\njurisdiction as a matter of law.  <i>Id.</i> at 228.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>IV. \r\nSovereign Immunity</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          The\r\nDepartment asserts that it is entitled to sovereign immunity from suit. Unless\r\nwaived by the State, sovereign immunity from suit defeats a trial court’s\r\nsubject-matter jurisdiction.<i>  Id.</i> at 225–26.  Relevant to this case,\r\nsection 101.021(2) of the Tort Claims Act waives immunity only for personal\r\ninjury and death “caused by a condition or use of tangible personal or real\r\nproperty if the governmental unit would, were it a private person, be liable to\r\nthe claimant according to Texas law.”  Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. §\r\n101.021(2) (West 2011).  Conversely, the Tort Claims Act does not waive sovereign\r\nimmunity if the State would not be liable to the claimant under Texas law if it\r\nwere a private person.  <i>Id.</i>; <i>see City of Fort Worth v. Robinson</i>,\r\n300 S.W.3d 892, 897 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2009, no pet.).  Thus, the Tort\r\nClaims Act creates a unique statutory scheme in which immunity from liability\r\nand immunity from suit are coextensive.  <i>Miranda</i>, 133 S.W.3d at 224; <i>see\r\nalso </i>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 101.021(2).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          At\r\nissue in this case is causation.  The Department argues that Ledbetter has not\r\npleaded and offered evidence that the use of tangible personal property caused\r\nJohn’s death.  Ledbetter responds that John died as a result of the officers’\r\nuse of restraints because “the application of the restraints onto an\r\nunconscious and vomiting John led directly to his inability to clear his\r\nairways and ultimately his death.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          “Section\r\n101.021(2) requires that for immunity to be waived, personal injury or death\r\nmust be proximately caused by the condition or use of tangible property.”  <i>Dallas\r\nCnty. Mental Health &amp; Mental Retardation v. Bossley</i>, 968 S.W.2d 339,\r\n343 (Tex.), <i>cert. denied</i>, 525 U.S. 1017 (1998).  To satisfy this\r\nrequirement, there must be “a nexus between the use of tangible property and\r\nthe plaintiff’s injuries.”  <i>Tex. Tech Univ. Health Scis. Ctr. v. Ward</i>,\r\n280 S.W.3d 345, 352 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2008, pet. denied) (citing <i>Dallas\r\nArea Rapid Transit v. Whitley</i>, 104 S.W.3d 540, 542–43 (Tex. 2003)).  Ledbetter’s\r\npleadings are clearly sufficient to allege that the use of the restraints\r\ncaused John’s death.  Among other things, Ledbetter alleges that the “misuse of\r\nthe restraints . . . were a direct and proximate cause of John’s death,” that\r\nthe Department “[a]ffirmatively us[ed] . . . the restraining devices to\r\nrestrain John Ledbetter while he was vomiting without a way to allow him to\r\nprotect himself and without protecting him,” and that “John died because he\r\naspirated vomit.”  We thus focus on whether the Department’s evidence negated\r\ncausation as a matter of law and, if so, whether Ledbetter presented evidence\r\nthat the alleged misuse of the restraining devices caused John’s death.  <i>See\r\nid.</i>; <i>see also Bossley</i>, 968 S.W.2d at 343; <i>Brittain</i>, 268\r\nS.W.3d at 805.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>V.  Plea\r\nto the Jurisdiction Evidence</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          The\r\nrecord before the trial court at the hearing on the Department’s plea to the\r\njurisdiction consisted of Ledbetter’s fifth amended petition, the witness\r\nstatements attached to Ledbetter’s fifth amended petition, the Department’s plea\r\nto the jurisdiction, and the autopsy report attached to the Department’s plea.  Because\r\nwe assume the truth of the nonmovant’s evidence when reviewing a plea to the\r\njurisdiction, <i>Brittain</i>, 268 S.W.3d at 805, we summarize the evidence in\r\nthe light most favorable to Ledbetter, the nonmovant.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Sergeant\r\nD. Pierce’s written statement provides that an officer escorted John into the\r\nmedical department at approximately 10 p.m. on June 27, 2008, because John had\r\nbeen “removing his clothes on several occasions and walking around the dayroom.”\r\n The nurse on duty said that nothing could be done for John until a\r\npsychological evaluation could be conducted the next morning, but John was moved\r\nto a segregated cell.  In ordering John to pack his belongings to be moved,\r\nSergeant Pierce noted that John seemed confused.  At approximately 4 a.m. the\r\nnext morning, Sergeant Pierce saw that John “had thrown up on the floor with a\r\nbrown coffee type substance,” was lying on his bunk, and was nonresponsive.  Sergeant\r\nPierce wrote that John “was just lying there shaking and moving his arms and\r\nhead around.”  Sergeant Pierce then called to have John transported to the\r\nRobertson Unit for evaluation, and officers placed John onto a gurney for the\r\ntransport and temporarily took him to the medical department.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Sergeant\r\nPierce also wrote the following in his witness statement:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>While in Medical, I\r\nhad Officer Skeens remove [John’s] shirt due to the liquids on it and he was\r\nplaced in transport restraints.  [John] was awake and breathing at this time[;]\r\nhe was shaking and moving his head around.  He was not talking or making any\r\nnoises. . . . When [the transport van] arrived, I along with Officer Skeens\r\nassisted [John] into the side doors of the transport Van.  I had control of\r\n[John]’s upper body and Officer Skeens had control of [John]’s legs and he was\r\nlifted from the gurney to the backseat of the transport Van.  At this time I\r\nwas inside the Van and placed [John] in a lying down position on his left side\r\ndue to [his] not being able to sit up on his own and throwing up at this time. \r\n[John] was still moving his head and shaking at this time.  The transport team\r\nleft for the Robertson Unit with all three Officers in the front cab area due\r\nto space limitations with [John] laying down on the only seat in the middle\r\nsection and the need to transport [him] in an urgent manner.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Officer\r\nJ. Martinez wrote in his statement that he retrieved restraints after being\r\nnotified that John would be transferred to Robertson Unit and that he and other\r\nofficers “applied the transport restraints.”  According to Officer Martinez’s\r\nstatement, John was placed into the transport van “on his side to prevent\r\nchoking due to his prior vomiting.”  The transport van departed at 4:20 a.m.,\r\narrived at the Robertson Unit at 4:22 a.m., and pulled up to the Robertson Unit\r\nMedical Department at approximately 4:25 a.m.  Officer Martinez wrote that John\r\nwas moaning and shaking upon arrival but that he was no longer moaning when the\r\nofficers opened the van doors.  During transport, John “had rolled himself in\r\nbetween the seat where he was lying on his side.”  Officer Martinez checked\r\nJohn’s pulse and “observed it to be very faint.”  Officer Martinez also helped\r\nmove John to a gurney and watched as nurses began CPR.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Nurse\r\nR. Mayfield’s written statement provides that John was “face down between [the]\r\nseat and cage” when she first saw him.  Nurse Mayfield called the ambulance,\r\nand officers removed John from the van and placed him on a gurney.  Nurse\r\nMayfield wrote that John’s “face and head was purple, pupils fixed and\r\ndilated.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Nurse\r\nG. Perales wrote in her statement that she heard officers say that John was not\r\nbreathing and that she “jumped [onto the] gurney and started chest compression.” \r\nNurse Perales also wrote:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Told my supervisor to\r\nget Ambubag from under gurney to give air.  Airway clear.  [Nurse] Mayfield,\r\nLVN pushing gurney down hallway toward ER Room.  More Security arrived. \r\nAssisting with CPR.  Airway suctioned out.  O2 applied with Ambubag at 10 L/M. \r\nPatient not responding.  Skin cold and purple.  No pulse or respiration noted. \r\nAmbulance had been called.  CPR continued.  Paramedics arrived.  MD called at\r\nHMC and given report told to stop CPR.  CPR in progress X 30 minutes approx. \r\nHeart monitors showing no cardiac activity.  Paramedics applied their heart\r\nmonitors and nothing was seen.  Hear[t] not responding.  CPR was ordered by HMC\r\nDoctor to be discontinued.  End of CPR rescue efforts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Nurse\r\nC. Williamson’s statement reflects that John was “lying face down between the\r\nseat and the cage” in the transport van when she first saw him.  He was\r\ntransferred from the van to the gurney by the officers, and someone called EMS.\r\n Nurse Williamson also wrote:  “[John’s] color was purple on head and face,\r\npupils were fixed, above nipple line color was lightly red/purple and mottled.”\r\n John had no pulse three minutes later, but nurses continued CPR until the\r\nparamedics arrived.  The paramedics assessed John’s condition after they\r\narrived and contacted Dr. Maloney who told them to stop CPR.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[3]</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          The\r\nlast written statement attached to Ledbetter’s petition is by inmate Jesus\r\nEzpinoza.  Ezpinoza wrote that the officers were not trying to help John\r\ndespite his requests for help and that they only offered him a cup of water.  Ezpinoza\r\nfurther stated that the “officers finally got him some medical attention [when]\r\nhe was drooling out green stuff from his mouth.”  Ezpinoza wrote that John was\r\ntrembling when he initially walked into his cell but that his “bones were\r\ntr[e]mbling” when the officers carried him out to the gurney.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          The\r\nDepartment’s only evidence is the autopsy report.  The listed findings include\r\nthat John was “pronounced dead in infirmary following episode of\r\ndisorientation, vomiting, and convulsions (by history)” and that John had\r\nsevere atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, severe pulmonary edema and\r\ncongestion, cardiomegaly, and arteriolonephrosclerosis.  The medical examiner\r\nlisted the causes of death as “congestive heart failure due to hypertensive and\r\natherosclerotic cardiovascular disease” and chronic hepatitis.  The autopsy\r\nreport also stated that John’s airways were “patent, containing no foreign\r\nobjects or material.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>VI. \r\nAnalysis</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          The\r\nDepartment contends that the trial court lacks subject matter jurisdiction\r\nbecause Ledbetter failed to plead and prove that the use of restraints caused\r\nJohn’s death and thereby failed to establish a waiver of sovereign immunity\r\nunder the Tort Claims Act.  Specifically, the Department argues that the\r\nautopsy report establishes that John died from heart failure and that Ledbetter\r\nhas presented no evidence tending to show that John died of asphyxiation as a\r\nresult of being restrained while vomiting.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          We\r\nconclude that the evidence in the plea to the jurisdiction record does not\r\nconclusively disprove causation.  Although the autopsy report does not include\r\naspiration as an immediate or secondary cause of John’s death, we are required\r\nto review the evidence in the light most favorable to Ledbetter, indulging\r\nevery reasonable inference and resolving any doubts in her favor.  <i>See Brittain</i>,\r\n268 S.W.3d at 805.  Considered in that light, evidence other than the autopsy\r\nreport shows that John may have asphyxiated and that the restraints could have been\r\na proximate cause of John’s death.  John was vomiting when placed into the\r\ntransport van and was restrained while in the van.  Sergeant Pierce wrote in\r\nhis statement that John was placed “in a lying down position” in the transport\r\nvan because he could not sit up on his own and was “throwing up at this time.”  Viewing\r\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to Ledbetter, a reasonable inference\r\nmay be drawn that John was vomiting after he was placed in the van.  Although\r\nOfficer Martinez’s statement provides that John was placed on his side to\r\nprevent choking, there is no evidence that John did not continue vomiting en\r\nroute to the Robertson Unit as no one rode in the back of the van with John to\r\nobserve his condition during the transport.  In addition, all three nurses\r\nnoted that, upon arrival at the Robertson Unit, John’s coloring was purple.  Nurse\r\nPerales wrote in her statement that she was called by Nurse Mayfield to help\r\nwhile the officers were removing John from the van.  She heard them say, “He is\r\nnot breathing.”  She then “jumped up gurney and started chest compression” and\r\ntold her supervisor to give John air.  She then wrote that John’s airway was\r\nclear, all of this occurring as Nurse Perales was continuing CPR and as Nurse\r\nMayfield was pushing the gurney toward the emergency room.  John’s airway was\r\nthen suctioned.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Applying\r\nthe appropriate standard of review, Nurse Perales’s statements that John’s\r\nairway was clear and was suctioned out do not conclusively negate the\r\npossibility that John’s airway was obstructed when Nurse Perales began CPR upon\r\nJohn’s arrival at the Robertson Unit.  <i>See Miranda</i>, 133 S.W.3d at 228; <i>Brittain</i>,\r\n268 S.W.3d at 805.  The Department relies on the statement in the autopsy\r\nreport that John’s airway was open, clear, and “contain[ed] no foreign objects\r\nor material,” but the suctioning of John’s airway would explain the medical\r\nexaminer’s failure to find obstructions in John’s airway when he performed the\r\nautopsy later that day.  Thus, in the absence of affirmative evidence offered\r\nby the Department that John’s physical symptoms upon arrival at the Robertson\r\nUnit were not consistent with asphyxiation, the evidence does not conclusively\r\ndisprove Ledbetter’s theory that John asphyxiated on vomit as a result of being\r\nrestrained in the transport van.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Applying\r\nthe appropriate standard of review and thus reviewing the plea to the\r\njurisdiction evidence in the light most favorable to Ledbetter, we hold that\r\nthe evidence does not conclusively show that the Department’s use of restraints\r\nwas not a proximate cause of John’s death.  <i>See generally Brittain</i>,<i> </i>268\r\nS.W.3d at 808 (“The causation requirement in section 101.021(2) is one of\r\nproximate cause-not a heightened standard such as sole cause.”).  Although the\r\nevidence arguably preponderates against a conclusion that the restraints\r\nproximately caused John’s death in that he was apparently suffering from a\r\ncardiac event prior to being restrained and was determined to have died as a\r\nresult of congestive heart failure, the evidence does not conclusively negate\r\nthe use of restraints as a proximate cause of John’s death and is likewise\r\nconflicting as to whether the Department’s use of restraints was, although not\r\nthe sole cause, a proximate cause of John’s death.  The trial court therefore did\r\nnot err by denying the Department’s plea to the jurisdiction.  We overrule the\r\nDepartment’s sole issue.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>VII. \r\nConclusion</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p

lawsuit\r\nfiled against it by Appellee Bonnie Ledbetter, Individually and as\r\nRepresentative of the Estate of John Ledbetter, and Freddie Ledbetter, Callie\r\nLedbetter, Amber Bogusch, Ashley Ledbetter, and John Ledbetter, Jr.\r\n(collectively, Ledbetter).  The Department contends in one issue that the trial\r\ncourt erred by denying the Department’s plea to the jurisdiction because there\r\nis no evidence that the use of tangible personal property proximately caused\r\nJohn Ledbetter’s death.  We affirm.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>II. \r\nProcedural History</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Ledbetter\r\nfiled this suit in June 2010.  She alleges in her fifth amended petition that\r\nher son John Ledbetter (John) died while in the Department’s custody and that\r\nthe Department is liable for his death because the Department’s employees used\r\nor misused a transport van, handcuffs, and restraints.  More specifically,\r\nLedbetter alleges that on June 27, 2008, John was not coherent and vomited in\r\nhis cell.  Department correctional officers transported John by van to another\r\nprison facility for evaluation and did not call for an ambulance so that John\r\ncould be taken to a hospital.  Prior to laying John on the backseat of the van,\r\nthe officers placed him in handcuffs and belly and ankle cuffs with a chain\r\nrunning between his hands, belly chain, and ankles.  Ledbetter alleges that,\r\nbecause of the restraints, John “could not move him self as needed to take care\r\nof himself when vomiting.”  Ledbetter further alleges that “[w]hen John arrived\r\nat the Robertson Unit, the nurses immediately saw that John was not breathing\r\nand started

Martinez wrote in his statement that he retrieved restraints after being\r\nnotified that John would be transferred to Robertson Unit and that he and other\r\nofficers “applied the transport restraints.”  According to Officer Martinez’s\r\nstatement, John was placed into the transport van “on his side to prevent\r\nchoking due to his prior vomiting.”  The transport van departed at 4:20 a.m.,\r\narrived at the Robertson Unit at 4:22 a.m., and pulled up to the Robertson Unit\r\nMedical Department at approximately 4:25 a.m.  Officer Martinez wrote that John\r\nwas moaning and shaking upon arrival but that he was no longer moaning when the\r\nofficers opened the van doors.  During transport, John “had rolled himself in\r\nbetween the seat where he was lying on his side.”  Officer Martinez checked\r\nJohn’s pulse and “observed it to be very faint.”  Officer Martinez also helped\r\nmove John to a gurney and watched as nurses began CPR.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Nurse\r\nR. Mayfield’s written statement provides that John was “face down between [the]\r\nseat and cage” when she first saw him.  Nurse Mayfield called the ambulance,\r\nand officers removed John from the van and placed him on a gurney.  Nurse\r\nMayfield wrote that John’s “face and head was purple, pupils fixed and\r\ndilated.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Nurse\r\nG. Perales wrote in her statement that she heard officers say that John was not\r\nbreathing and that she “jumped [onto the] gurney and started chest compression.” \r\nNurse Perales also wrote:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Told my supervisor to\r\nget Ambubag from under gurney to give air.  Airway clear.  [Nurse] Mayfield,\r\nLVN pushing gurney down hallway toward ER Room.  More Security arrived. \r\nAssisting with CPR.  Airway suctioned out.  O2 applied with Ambubag at 10 L/M. \r\nPatient not responding.  Skin cold and purple.  No pulse or respiration noted. \r\nAmbulance had been called.  CPR continued.  Paramedics arrived.  MD called at\r\nHMC and given report told to stop CPR.  CPR in progress X 30 minutes approx. \r\nHeart monitors showing no cardiac activity.  Paramedics applied their heart\r\nmonitors and nothing was seen.  Hear[t] not responding.  CPR was ordered by HMC\r\nDoctor to be discontinued.  End of CPR rescue efforts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Nurse\r\nC.

mottled.”\r\n John had no pulse three minutes later, but nurses continued CPR until the\r\nparamedics arrived.  The paramedics assessed John’s condition after they\r\narrived and contacted Dr. Maloney who told them to stop CPR.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[3]</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          The\r\nlast written statement attached to Ledbetter’s petition is by inmate Jesus\r\nEzpinoza.  Ezpinoza wrote that the officers were not trying to help John\r\ndespite his requests for help and that they only offered him a cup of water.  Ezpinoza\r\nfurther stated that the “officers finally got him some medical attention [when]\r\nhe was drooling out green stuff from his mouth.”  Ezpinoza wrote that John was\r\ntrembling when he initially walked into his cell but that his “bones were\r\ntr[e]mbling” when the officers carried him out to the gurney.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          The\r\nDepartment’s only evidence is the autopsy report.  The listed findings include\r\nthat John was “pronounced dead in infirmary following episode of\r\ndisorientation, vomiting, and convulsions (by history)” and that John had\r\nsevere atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, severe pulmonary edema and\r\ncongestion, cardiomegaly, and arteriolonephrosclerosis.  The medical examiner\r\nlisted the causes of death as “congestive heart failure due to hypertensive and\r\natherosclerotic cardiovascular disease” and chronic hepatitis.  The autopsy\r\nreport also stated that John’s airways were “patent, containing no foreign\r\nobjects or material.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>VI. \r\nAnalysis</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          The\r\nDepartment contends that the trial court lacks subject matter jurisdiction\r\nbecause Ledbetter failed to plead and prove that the use of restraints caused\r\nJohn’s death and thereby failed to establish a waiver of sovereign immunity\r\nunder the Tort Claims Act.  Specifically, the Department argues that the\r\nautopsy report establishes that John died from heart failure and that Ledbetter\r\nhas presented no evidence tending to show that John died of asphyxiation as a\r\nresult of being restrained while vomiting.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          We\r\nconclude that the evidence in the plea to the jurisdiction record does not\r\nconclusively disprove causation.  Although the autopsy report does not include\r\naspiration as an immediate or secondary cause of John’s death, we are required\r\nto review the evidence in the light most favorable to Ledbetter, indulging\r\nevery reasonable inference and resolving any doubts in her favor.  <i>See Brittain</i>,\r\n268 S.W.3d at 805.  Considered in that light, evidence other than the autopsy\r\nreport shows that John may have asphyxiated and that the restraints could have been\r\na proximate cause of John’s death.  John was vomiting when placed into the\r\ntransport van and was restrained while in the van.  Sergeant Pierce wrote in\r\nhis statement that John was placed “in a lying down position” in the transport\r\nvan because he could not sit up on his own and was “throwing up at this time.”  Viewing\r\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to Ledbetter, a reasonable inference\r\nmay be drawn that John was vomiting after he was placed in the van.  Although\r\nOfficer Martinez’s statement provides that John was placed on his side to\r\nprevent choking, there is no evidence that John did not continue vomiting en\r\nroute to the Robertson Unit as no one rode in the back of the van with John to\r\nobserve his condition during the transport.  In addition, all three nurses\r\nnoted that, upon arrival at the Robertson Unit, John’s coloring was purple.  Nurse\r\nPerales wrote in her statement that she was called by Nurse Mayfield to help\r\nwhile the officers were removing John from the van.  She heard them say, “He is\r\nnot breathing.”  She then “jumped up gurney and started chest compression” and\r\ntold her supervisor to give John air.  She then wrote that John’s airway was\r\nclear, all of this occurring as Nurse Perales was continuing CPR and as Nurse\r\nMayfield was pushing the gurney toward the emergency room.  John’s airway was\r\nthen suctioned.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Applying\r\nthe appropriate standard of review, Nurse Perales’s statements that John’s\r\nairway was clear and was suctioned out do not conclusively negate the\r\npossibility that John’s airway was obstructed when Nurse Perales began CPR upon\r\nJohn’s arrival at the Robertson Unit.  <i>See Miranda</i>, 133 S.W.3d at 228; <i>Brittain</i>,\r\n268 S.W.3d at 805.  The Department relies on the statement in the autopsy\r\nreport that John’s airway was open, clear, and “contain[ed] no foreign objects\r\nor material,” but the suctioning of John’s airway would explain the medical\r\nexaminer’s failure to find obstructions in John’s airway when he performed the\r\nautopsy later that day.  Thus, in the absence of affirmative evidence offered\r\nby the Department that John’s physical symptoms upon arrival at the Robertson\r\nUnit were not consistent with asphyxiation, the evidence does not conclusively\r\ndisprove Ledbetter’s theory that John asphyxiated on vomit as a result of being\r\nrestrained in the transport van.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Applying\r\nthe appropriate standard of review and thus reviewing the plea to the\r\njurisdiction evidence in the light most favorable to Ledbetter, we hold that\r\nthe evidence does not conclusively show that the Department’s use of restraints\r\nwas not a proximate cause of John’s death.  <i>See generally Brittain</i>,<i> </i>268\r\nS.W.3d at 808 (“The causation requirement in section 101.021(2) is one of\r\nproximate cause-not a heightened standard such as sole cause.”).  Although the\r\nevidence arguably preponderates against a conclusion that the restraints\r\nproximately caused John’s death in that he was apparently suffering from a\r\ncardiac event prior to being restrained and was determined to have died as a\r\nresult of congestive heart failure, the evidence does not conclusively negate\r\nthe use of restraints as a proximate cause of John’s death and is likewise\r\nconflicting as to whether the Department’s use of restraints was, although not\r\nthe sole cause, a proximate cause of John’s death.  The trial court therefore did\r\nnot err by denying the Department’s plea to the jurisdiction.  We overrule the\r\nDepartment’s sole issue.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>VII. \r\nConclusion</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p
