Appellanf requests oral argument.\n\n\n                                STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n          Appellant pled not guilty to all counts of an eighteen count indictment, alleging\n\n sexual assault and aggravated sexual assault, on various dates against the same\n\n complainant.r Prior to jury selection, the State waived nine of the eighteen counts.\n\n The remaining nine counts consisted ofthlee counts ofsexual assault and six counts\n\n of aggravated sexual assault. The six aggravated counts alleged six discrete sexual\n\nassaults purpolting to have occurred on various dates from August 2012 through\n\nNovernber 2012. The agglavating eìernent of each of the six discrete aggravated\n\ncounts is alleged in identical statutory language, threatening to cause imrninent \"death\n\nor serious bodily\".\n\n         The three discrete non-aggravated counts are alleged to have each occurred in\n\nthe   niddle of tl.ris tirne period, in October 2012.\n\n        On Octobe¡ 24,2013, the jury convicted Appellant on all nine discr.ete counts\n\n\n\n   rThis was, in\n                 fact, a reindictment. l'he original indictruent was fil'teen counts and contained no\n\"aggravating\" language. Iloth indictments contained one counl ofindecency with a child which\nwas waived by the state (Clerk's Tr. at pp. 6-9 &. 12-14).\n\f On October' 25,2013, the tlial couú sentenced Appellant to six lìfìy-year sentences,\n\n on the aggravated counts, and three twenty-year sentences on the non-aggravated\n\n counts.   All   sentences to lun concul.rently. Appellant tirnely appealed.\n\n                      STATEMENT OF PROCEDURAL IIISTORY\n\n       ln an opinion, designated forpublication, handed down on April 30, 2015, the\n\nFort vy'orth court of Appeals affirmed Appellant's convictions on all nine counts.\n\nSmallwood, Jr. y. State,20l5 Tex.App.LEXIS 4457 (Tex.App.ìior1 Worlh April 30,\n\n2015). Appellanl liled       a   timely Motion for Rehearing.   Or.r   August 6,2015,the Court\n\nof Appeals withdlew its original opinion and issued a new published opinion, again\n\naffilrring all nine of Appellant's convictions. Smallwood, Jr. v. State, 2015\n\nTex.App.LEXIS        825 3   (Tex.App.Fort'ùy'oúh August 6, 20 1 5).\n\n      Appellant's tirnely Motion for.Rehearing on the Court's second published\n\nopinion was denied on August 28,2015. This petition was then timely filed with the\n\nClerk of the Court of Criminal Appeals, to wit on September 28,Z0lS.\n\n                                   GROUND FOR REVIE\\il\n\nGROUND FOR REVIEW\n\n     THE COURT OF APPEALS REVERSIBLY ERRED IN I]OLDING\n     THAT THE EVIDENCE WAS LEGALLY SUFF'ICIENT TO\n     SUPPOIìT.'I.HIT ALLEGËD AGGIIAVATING ELEMENT IN EACIT\n     OF THE SIX DISCRETE AGGRAVATED SEXUAL ASSAULT\n     COUNTS.\n\f REASONS F'OIì GRAN'I'ING IìEVIEW\n\n       In holding that the evidence was legally sufficient to suppod the alleged\n\n aggravating elernent in each of the six disclete aggravated sexual assault counts, the\n\n court of Appeals decided on irnpoftant question of state law in a way that conflicts\n\n with the applicable decisions ofthe courl of criminal Appeals and the Suplerne court\n\n of the United States as well as the Texas and the United States Constitution.\n\n            ARGUMENT SUPPORTING GTTOUND FOR IìEVIEW\n\n\n       Appellant was indicted on six discr.ete counts of aggravated sexual assault\n\nalleged to have been committed against the same fifleen year old complainant\n\n(Appellant's step-daughter). The indictment alleged specific \"on or about\" dates for\n\neach of the six disclete counts. The lÌrst date alleged was in August 2012 andfhelast\n\nwas in November 2012. The indictment also alleged three discrete unaggravated\n\nsexual assault counts, against the same complainant, which were alleged to have\n\noccurred in the middle of this time period, in October 2012.\n\n      The six discrete aggravated counts each contained identical aggravating\n\nlanguage, which read as follows:\n\n      And the defendant by acts ol'words placed Alicia Carpenter in fear.that\n      death or selious bodily injury would be imminently inflicted or.r Alioia\n      Carpentel or Krista Carpenter.\n\f (Clerk's'l'r. at pp. 6-B).\n\n        l'-irst, the State's evidence was legally insuffìcient to connect any of the\n\n purported thleats attributed to Appellant to any         of the six discrete counts of\n aggravated sexual assault alleged in the indictr¡ent. \"fhe court ofAppeals erroneously\n\n analyzed,this evidentiary deficiency in its legal sufficiency analysis on rehealing by\n\n stating:\n\n        'I\"he unique facts\n                         of this case lequile us to look at the threats as\n       continuing duling the comtnission of the assaults ovel. an extended\n       period of time.\n\n Slip Op. on Rehearing Below at I 1.\n\n       The Couft below, therefore, erloneously deemed it unnecessary to analyze fhe\n\nsix aggravated counts as six disclete crirnes in which each element, including the\n\naggravating element, must be pl'oven beyond a reasonable doubt, which the State\n\nclearly failed to do. Rather, in order to find the evidence legally sufficient, the Court\n\nbelow elroneously analyzed the evidence    as   ifthe indictment alleged a single criminal\n\nepisode, that continued \"over an extended period of tirne,\" rather than six separate,\n\ndiscrete crirnes, each one of which has essential statutoly elements, each element      of\nwhich must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The lower court's analysis, in\n\nessence, deletes the te¡m \"imrninently   inllicted\" f¡oln the indictrnent and thc statute\n\nby detennining that those words have no significance. The lower court's analysis also,\n\f in el.ítct, adds the term \"satne crirnir.ral episode\" where the legislature dicl not itrclucle\n\n ir.\n\n        The legal sufficiency standard of.eview is highly defelencial and is viewed in\n\n the light most favorable to the State. Jackson v. Virginia,443 U.S. 307 (lg7g).\n\n l{owever, the State's evidence, in order to be legally sufficient, must not only rneet\n\n the lelevant statute,   it   rnust be assigned to the specific allegations made in the\n\n indictrnent. lf the indictmenl alleges multiple discrete offenses, the evidence must be\n\n assigned   to specific discrete counts, not simply to the \"criminal episode.,, The\n\n unanirnity cases make        it   clear that he proof   of the   elernents   in a multi-count\nindictment must be proven as to each individual discrete count. \"An unanimousjury\n\nverdict ensures that the jury agrees on factual elements underlying an offense-it is\n\nnrore than lnere agreement on a violation of a statute.\" Francis v. State,36 S.W.3d\n\n121, 125 (Tex.Crirn.App. 2000). See. also, Ansari v. State,20l5 Tex.App. LEXIS\n\n8192 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 2015):\n\n       In Texas, the jury must \"reach a unanilnous verdict about the specific\n       crime that the defendant comrnitted.\" Casio,353 S.W.3d at 771. This\n       rneans \"the jury must agree upou a single and discrete incident that\n       would constitute the commission of the offense alleged.\"\n\nAnsari, supra. at 8792.\n\n       The State's evidence is legally insufficient if they do not prove every element\n\f ol'each cliscretc count, or ifthey p¡rove an offense different than the otie alleged in the\n\n indictrnent, even ifthe oflense proven violates the sarxe statutoly plovision. Gollihar\n\n v. State,46 S.W.3d 243 (Tex.Cr.im.App. 2001).\n\n       Although each ofthe nine counts in the case-at-bar. alleges a padicular \"on or\n\n about\" date, it is clear frorn the State's evidence presented af trial, that the various\n\n dates alleged    in the indictrnent were chosen randomly and arbitrarily. V/ith        the\n\nexception of counts     I   and 2, the complainant's testimony describing the events is\n\nextlemely sketchy and does not colrespond to any specifìc dates alleged. The State\n\ndoes not have to prove the exact date an offense occurred, but in this case, the State's\n\nevidence ofthe alleged aggravating element's in each of the six disclete aggravated\n\ncounts, does not correspond to any of the particular, discrete aggravated counts\n\nalleged in the indictment. Therefole, the State, among other things, did not prove the\n\naggravating element in any of the discrete agglavated counts alleged, and the courl\n\nbelow used the wtong analysis, by failing to tleat the counts as disc¡ete counts. The\n\npurported threat that elevated each ofthe six aggravated counts had to be proven as\n\nto each discrete count, not, as stated by the coult ofappeals \"as continuing during the\n\ncornmission of the assaults over ân extended peliod of time.\"\n\n      Tl.re State's key witness was    their alleged cornplainant. ln lier testimony, she\n\ndescribed   in   some detail the   first time she agleed to have sex with Appellant.\n\f Although it is not clear, it is assun-red tl.rat the State intended the jury to infer that this\n\n description applied to count(s) 1 and/or 2 of the indictment which wele alleged to\n\n have occurred \"on or about\" August I0, 2012, the earliest date alleged in the\n\n indictrnent. Accolding to the complainant, and viewing the evidence most favorably\n\n to the State, these two disclete offenses (vaginal and oral assaults) took place at\n\n Appellant's house in Grand Prairie, while complainant's twin brothers were asleep\n\n in anothelroom.

(R.Vol. 5 af l3B-142).\n\n       The complainant said nothing about a threat ofdeath or serous bodily injury\n\nrnade during these two discrete offenses (presumably, aggravated counts one and two\n\nofthe indictment), that would have elevated these two purporfed acts from two sexual\n\nassaults, to two aggravated sexual assaults. The cornplainant also did not testify that\n\nshe was in fear of death ot'serious     bodily injury during this \"fitst night\". Clear.ly, the\n\fState did not prove the alleged aggravating element   ofcounts I or 2.\n      'lìre prosecutor then had the cornplainant summarily describe, in very cursory\n\nfashion, the other tirnes it happened, plesurnably in an effol-t to prove each of the\n\nrernaining seven disclete counts ofthe indictrnent (3-9).\n\n      IPROSECUTOR]: Is this sornething that happened more than once?\n\n      A.    Yes.\n\n      a.    How many times do you think that it happened?\n\n      A.    Like eight to 11 times.

Yes.\n\n(R.Vol. 5 at 144-145).\n\n       After this brief surnmary of what one can only assume was supposed to be a\n\ncul'sory account of the lemaining seven, alleged discrete counts, the complainant\n\ntestified that she received   a   call flom Appellant saying that they clid not have to do it\n\nanymore. (R.Vol. 5 at 163).\n\n      IPROSECUTOR]: And that was the last time anything happened like\n      that?\n\n      A.      Yes, Ma'am.\n\n      a.      Let me ask you this. Did the defendant ever say anything about what\n              rnight happen if you did tell?\n\n      A.      That I shouldn't tell, nobody would believe me. He would take my\n\f      br'others away.\n\n\n\n       And then he told me a story about a gill who was babysitting this\nguy's kids, and he ended up raping her. And then she went to couft, and\nthen he pretended to be somebody that he wasn't and hit her up on\nFacebook and that they met up thinking it was somebody else, and he\nkilled her'.\n\na     And when you're saying he?\n\nA.    I'rn talking about the person in the story that he was telling rne\n      about.\n\na.    So the defendant didn't tell you that he did these things?\n\nA.

And did he say that they might, in fact, kill you?\n\nA.   Not, like, out of his mouth, but his actions, like the way that he would\n     talk about it. He put it towalcls rne that that could be a possibility.\n\na    Did you l'eel that - that he was thleâtening you with that?\n\nA.   Yes.\n\na.

Vol. 5 at 163-167).\n\n\n\n         At this point, the complainant has testified, at best, that sometimes there was\n\na   thleat during the sexual assault, but usually thel.e was not. There is no way to assign\n\nthat threat or those threats to any discrete count in the indictment. The exact nature\n\nof the threat or threats is vague and which counts, if any, the alleged \"threat,\n\npurportedly applied to is impossible to tell. No reasonable juror could have found,\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, that a particular threat was made as a part of any alleged\n\n\n\n                                             t4\n\f discrete count.\n\n         Appellant was indicted in each discr.ete aggravatecl count pursuant to T.p.C.\n\n $22.021(a)(2)(Axii), which agg'avates what is otherwise an unaggravated sexual\n\nassault ofa child (i.e., under seventeen) ifthe defendant by acts or words threatens the\n\nvictim, or any pel'son, with imminent death or serious bodily injury. uniike other\n\nsubsections of the same statute, the specific thleat, whether by acts or by words, must\n\nbe a palt of the alleged sexual assault itself. By              contr.ast, see 'I.p.C.\n\n$22.021(a)(2)(Axii), which agglavates an otherwise unaggravated sexual assault,       if\nthe perpetlator causes serious bodily injury ol'attempts to câuse death, \"in the course\n\nof the   sarne oliminal episode.\" Also, contr.ast T.P.C. Q22.021(a)(Z)(A)(iv), which\n\naggl'avates an otherwise unagglavated sexual assault,      if the perpetrator uses or\nexhibits a deadly weapon \"in the course of the same criminal episode.,'\n\n      Further, on cross-examination, the complainant testified as follows:\n\n      fDefense Counsel]: And it's your-your testimony that you participated\n      in events that you've described for us out offear that Jayylo was going\n      to go public with the photographs of you?\n\n      A.      Correct.\n\n     a       And also, part of your fear wer.e stories that you attr-ibuted or you\n             interpreted as threats concerning Jeffl\n\n     A.

Right\n\n          a     And also, that Jeff told you a story about a girl of-who                was\n                babysilting and was raped by the father?\n\n          A.    Coruect.\n\n\n\n\n         a.     So it wasn't, then, a direct thr-eat by Jeff to you was it?\n\n         A.     I guess not.\n\n\n\n         a     Concerning threats from Jeff, did you tell us ea¡lier today that the\n               threat was not out of his mouth but rather his actions?\n\n         A.    He didn't, like, threaten me and say, oh, you're going to die ii;\n               you know, you tell. It wasn't like that. I was just kind of like, you\n               know, don't tell, something bad will happen. I,ll get the boys\n               taken away from me. Something bad might happen to you. your\n               morr might not believe you.\n\n(R.Vol. 5 at224-226).2\n\n         Therefore, none of the alleged threats purportedly rnade by Appellant as\n\ntestified to by oomplainant, are threats ol\"imrninent\" death or ser.ious bodily injury.\n\n\n   2ln\n       its opinion on rehearing, the court below stated, \"Complainant lestified that Appellant had\ntold her'(1) that he knew people in Mexico associated wilh the Mexican mafia and that they\nwould kill hel and her rnolher without the killings being traced back to him . . .\" slip op. below\na1 p.10. This passage is not accurate. 'l'he complainant did not testily 10 that.\n\n\n                                                t6\n\f Black's Law Dictionat'y 4'r'Edition defines \"imminent danger\"\",       as   \"imrnecliate clanger,\n\n such as must be instantly rnet, such as cannot be guarcled against by calling for the\n\n assistance of others or tl-re protection of the law.\"\n\n          In Blountv. State,542 S.W.2d 164 (Tex.Crim .App.1976),an,,aggr.avated rape\"\n\n case,   \"two unarmed men, including appellant, forced their way into the house tr-ailer\n\n of tlre prosecutrix, who was alone at the time.', Id. af 165.,,[T]he rnen dragged her\n\n along the floor thlough the bathloorn into the bedroom . . . both men engaged in\n\n sexual intercourse with hel'and then depart ed.\" Id. The victim, who was deaf, testified\n\nthat one of them told her \"that     if   [she] told they would come back and      kill   [her.]\".\n\n         The Court held that the evidence was legally insufficient to prove the\n\naggravating element:\n\n         . . . the only threater.red death was conditional [i.e., if she told] and at\n         some indefinite time in the future. 1'his threat [to kill her if she told] was\n         insufficient to satisfy the lequirement of the statute that the threat be\n         imminent. As stated in the practice commentary to Sec. 21.03:\n\n                \"Note that the thleatened harm of Subsection (a)(1) must be\n         'imminent;\" hence a thr.eat to harm someone at an indetermine tirne in\n         the future does not aggravate.\"\n\nId. at 166 (emphasis added) (notes ornitted).\n\n         As in the case-at-bar, the Court in Blount noted thal ,.[a] threat can be\n\ncommunicated by action or conduct as well as words.\".Id. at I66 (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n                                               t1\n\f As in lllount, none ol'the alleged wolds ol actions attributed to Appellant by the\n\n complainant in her testimoÍìy were imrninent thleats to cause death ol selious bodily\n\n injuly to the conrplainant (Alicia Carpenter), ol l.rer.motl.rer, (Krista Car.penter). As the\n\n complainant stated on cross-exalnination:\n\n        a.     So it wasn'l, then, a direct thleat by Jeff to you was it?\n\n       A.     I guess not.\n\n\n\n\n       a.     Concerning threats fì'om Jeft did you tell us earlier today that the\n              threat was not out of his mouth but rather his actions?\n\n\n       A.     He didn't, like, threaten me and say, oh, you're going to die if,\n              you know, you tell. It wasn't like that. I was just kind of like, you\n              know, don't tell, something bad will happen. I'll get the boys\n              taken away fì'om me. Something bad rnight happen to you. Your\n              mom rnight not believe you.\n\n(R.Vol. 5 at226).\n\n       The purported words or actions at most implied a veiled conditional threat,\n\nwhich is legally insufficient to meet the definition of imminent death or serious bodily\n\ninjury. See. Blount. supra.\n\n      InRamirezv. State,336 S.V/.3d 846 (Tex.App.-Arnarillo 201I,pet. refld), the\n\ncouft cited B/ounl with approval in the context of a duress delènse. \"'l-he 'I'exas court\n\nof criminal Appeals has determined that      a threat   of death at some indefinite time in\n\f the futu.e js hsufl-pþ¡! lg_s¿Xiqry ûe recìuirement o                     .,,   kl. at g51-52\n (citing Blount at 166) (emphasis added).\n\n        The Rant i.rez Coul.t went on to explain:\n\n        . . .

State,2013 Tex.App.      LEXlS929l (Tex.App.-V/aco,Iuly25,2013)\n\n(unpublished) (citing, Blount with approval). ln l{ernantlez, the trial court correctly\n\nexcluded evidence offered by the defendant in support of his duress defense. The\n\ncourt held that evidence of gang rnembership and previous cLimes were irrelevant in\n\nestablishing the element of the defendant's feal of irnrninent halrn to the defendant or\n\nhis farnily. In the case-at-bar, the state relied on testimony that Appellant clairned to\n\nhave connections with the Mexican rnalia and Mexican assassins and that he spoke\n\nspanish . (R,vol. 5 at 52 &.YoL7 at 177). Asin Hernandez         and,   Blount,the State's\n\f evidcnce was legally instrflìcient to establish an \"irnminent\" tlueât of doath or ser.ious\n\n bodily injury to the cornplainant or her mother.\n\n        In McDowell v. State,235 S.W.3d 294, 297 (Tex.App.-Texarkana 2007, no\n\n pet.), the court held that, \"[a] threat rnade six r¡onths before the threatened event is\n\n not an irnminent threat.\" ln Anguish v. State,991 S.W.2d gg3, gg6,g7 (Tex.App._\n\n l-louston [1'r Dist.] 1999,pet. refld.), the court held that   a   threat made four days prior\n\n to a robbery was not imminent. ln Stníth v. State,949 S.W.2d 333,336 (Tex.App.\n\n Tyler 1996, pet. r'efd), the coult concluded that a threat made four months earlier was\n\n not imminent.\n\n       A \"fea. that death or serious bodily injury would be imminently inflicted',            as\n\nalleged in the indictrnent and as requiled by the applicable statute \"requires       a   present\n\nthreat; threats of future harm alone are not sufficient.\" pol ier v. state,,2012Tex.App.\n\nLEXIS 9473 (Tex.App.-Houston [1'1 Dist], Nov. 15, 2012, per.                        dismissed\n\n(unpublished) (citing, Blount and Devine v.

The trial court sentenced him accordingly, ordering the\n\f  sentences to be served concurrently. Appellant brings five issues on appeal,\n\n  challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to show the aggravating element for\n\n  the síx convictions of aggravated sexual assault of a child (counts one through\n\n four, eight, and nine) and contending that the state misrepresented the law during\n\n voir dire and that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding evidence of ihe\n\n complainant's prior rape accusation against a neighbor and the testimony of two\n\n other witnesses. Because the evidence ís sufficient to support the jury's verdict\n\n and because the trial court committed no reversible error, we affirm the trial\n\n court's judgments.\n\n Brief Facts\n\n       Appellant and Complaínant's mother (Mother) had been a couple, had\n\n shared a home with complainant and her brother, and were the parents of twin\n\n boys, Complainant's younger half-brothers. Appellant and Mother parted ways\n\n and went through a custody battle over the twins. On July, 4,2012, Complainant,\n\nwho was fourteen years old at the time, was at Appellant's home with her twin\n\nbrothers. complainant and Mother were not getting along around this             time.\n\nAppellant told complainant that he wanted to put Mother in a hole and hire some\n\nMexican assassins to hurt   her. ln the same conversation, Appellant suggested\nthat Complainant have sex with him to make Mother mad, but Complainant\n\nrefused his offer.\n\n      Later that same month, Complainant, along with her twin brothers, visited\n\nAppellant's parents in El Paso. During this trip, Complainant received messages\n\f from someone who identified himself as \"Jayylo\" thiough Kik, an application on\n\n her cell phone. Jayylo sent pictures of his penis to   her. She     responded by\n \"sen[ding] inappropriate pictures of [her] boobs.\" She never gave Jayylo her\n\n home address or her real name. Jayylo continued to send more pictures of\n\n himself to her. When Complainant threatened to stop sending Jayylo pictures, he\n\n threatened   to send the photos she had sent him to her school and to        the\n\n mailboxes    of   Mother and her neighbors. Complainant noticed that the\n background of one of the photos he sent her resembled a portion of Appellant,s\n\n house. Complainant was then suspicious that Appellant was Jayylo.\n\n        She confronted Appellant, but he denied having a Kik account. About an\n\n hour later, Appellant called Complainant back and asked her why he had pictures\n\nof her boobs in his mailbox. Complainant started crying and told him what had\n\nhappened with Jayylo and that he had threatened     her.   Complainant also told\n\nAppellant's mother why she was crying, and Appellant got mad at Complainant\n\nfor telling his mother. complainant turned fifteen years old while she was in El\n\nPaso.\n\n        When Complainant returned home from El Paso, she began receiving text\n\nmessages from Jayylo sent directly   to her cell phone number.       Complainant\n\nnoticed that the first six digits of Jayyfo's phone number were the same as\n\nAppellant's cell phone number. Jayylo told her that he got her phone number\n\nfrom one of her friends, which Complainant knew not to be true. Whenever\n\nComplainant asked Jayylo who he really was, he would change his story of how\n\f Complainant was supposed        to know him and how old he was. Jayylo texted\n Complainant almost every day at different times of the day. But she could never\n\n get a response when she called him.\n\n       Jayylo continued threatening Complainant and demanded that she send\n\n him more photos, have sex with Appellant, videotape it, and send the video to\n\n Jayylo. Complainant refused. Jayylo put one of the photos Complainant had sent\n\n him on a Facebook page he had created and ihreatened to add all of her friends\n\n to that page. Appellant told Complainant that Jayylo was also contacting him, but\n\n she never saw any of the messages that Appellant claimed to have received.\n\n       Appellant and Complainant spoke about the situation and decided to\n\nacquiesce   to   Jayylo's demands. Complainant and Appellant had sexual\n\nintercourse in Appellant's house while Complainant's twin brothers were asleep.\n\nFollowing Jayylo's demands, Appellant and Complainant continued their sexual\n\nrelationship. They had sexual intercourse \"eight to eleven times[,] [m]aybe more,',\n\nfrom August 2012 to November 2012. These sexual encounters would occur at\n\neither Appellant's or Complainant's home.\n\n      Complainant testified that she texted Jayylo that it was getting harder for\n\nher to keep these incidents a secret, and shortly after she sent this text, Appellant\n\ncalled her and told her that they did not \"have to do it anymore.\" Appellant then\n\ntofd Complainant a story about\n\n      a girl who was babysitting this guy's kids, and he ended up raping\n      her. And then she went to court, and then he pretended to be\n\f       somebody that he wasn't and hit her up on Facebook and thal they\n       met up thinking it was somebody else, and he killed her.\n\n This story scared Complainant. At trial, she testified that Appellant knew people\n\n from Mexico who were in the Mexican Mafia. Although complainant testified that\n\n Appellant never specifically threatened her, she also testified ihat he made it\n\n clear that if he could hurt Mother, he could hurt Complainant   too. ln December\n 2012, Complainant made an outcry to Mother's friend. Shorily afterward, the\n\n decision to call the police was made. Appellant pled not guilty to all counts of an\n\neighteen-count indictment alleging that he had committed sexual assault and\n\naggravated sexual assault on various dates against Complainant.\n\n       Outside the presence of the jury, in an in-camera hearing, Appellant\n\npresented evidence from Ricky    May. May lived in Complainant's neighborhood\naround 2008 to    2009. He testified that when he was         eighteen years old,\nComplainant would contact him \"through phone [and] text messaging, trying to get\n\n[him] to have sexual intercourse with her\" because she was \"horny.\" May refused\n\nComplainant's offer, but he heard that Complainant had iold people in their\n\nneighborhood that he had raped her, which he denied. May was never charged\n\nwith or arrested for rape. The State objected to May's testimony on hearsay\n\ngrounds.\n\n      THE   COURT:       Response?\n\n      IPROSËCUTOR]: Once agaín, Your Honor, this is an opinion based\n                    upon hearsay. There's no proof that she ever\n                    said these things. And this is the type of\n                    reputation and opínion evidence that is, I believe,\n\f                                proh¡bited under 412 as is relating to sexual\n                                conduct and it's not fitting in one of the categories\n                                that aflows for past behavior to be admissible.\n\n The trial court sustained the State's objection, and May was not permitted to\n\ntestify in front of the jury.\n\n       Appellant also offered testimony from Jeannie Redmon outside the\n\npresence of the     jury.   Redmon testifíed that she had known Complainant for\n\n\"[a]pproximately seven to eight years.\" Redmon testified that Complainant was\n\n\"untruthful\" because (1) she took items that belonged to Redmon's daughter; told\n\nRedmon that Redmon's daughter had given her the items when in fact, Redmon's\n\ndaughter had not; (2) and instructed Redmon's daughter               to similarly lie;   she\n\nwould tell Redmon and her daughter that she was dating people whom she was\n\nnot dating, (3) she had said that a boy across the street had raped her; and (4)\n\nshe lied about giving out her phone number to boys at a waterpark when Redmon\n\nasked her if she had done           so.   Redmon afso testified that she thought her\n\ndaughter and Complainant had gone to pornographic websites on Redmon's\n\nhome computer. Appellant offered Redmon's testimony as her opinion on\n\nComplainant's truthfulness. The State objected to Redmon's testimony:\n\n     We'll object under rule 608 and 609, also 404. I thínk if this witness\n     knew [Complainant] presently, we would be legally okay with her\n     opinion that she's untruthful, but I think four years ago is a little bit too\n     remote. And certainly, even if that was allowed, the rules, specifically\n     608(b)l,l disallow specific instances of conduct. So we would object\n     to any specific instances.\n\n           Additionally, it sounds like almost all of this is hearsay and,\n     except for perhaps the opinion as to truthfulness. But the porn use, I\n\f       don't think we can say that this witness knows with her own personal\n       knowledge that it was definitely [Complainant]. I think perhaps she's\n       basing that off of what her daughter has told her. And the same with\n       the false claim of rape, she's admitted on cross she really does not\n       know what happened.\n\n The trial court sustained the State's objections, and Redmon was not permitted to\n\ntestify in front of the jury.\n\n       Appellant also presented evidence from Denise Brown outside the\n\npresence of the     jury.       Brown tesiified that Complainant was friends with her\n\ndaughter and that she knew Complainant in 2009 and 2010. Brown testified that\n\nComplainant was untruthfuf because Complainant ('l) spread rumors that Brown's\n\ndaughter was pregnant and (2) took some fingernail polish belonging to Brown's\n\ndaughter without permission. Brown also testified that Complainant was\n\nflirtatious   with boys and opined that             Complainant   was   promiscuous.\n\nComplainant's friendship with Brown's daughter ended when Brown's daughter\n\nbegan dating a boy whom Complainant had previously dated, and Complainant\n\nbegan calling Brown's daughter            a \"slut.\" The State objected to    Brown's\n\ntestimony:\n\n      The State would objeci as to . . . this witness . . . having no personal\n      knowledge of the things that she has referenced as far as her basis\n      for determining this-[Complainant's] credibility. She's basing it upon\n      hearsay. So we would object under 608.\n\n              Also, as far as going into specific instances of conduct, she\n      doesn't-she did not personally observe them or have personal\n      knowledge as to them,\n\n              Also, we'd object under 404, 403 as             to her general\n     characterization of [Complainant's being] boy crazy, promiscuous.\n\f             [S]he has clearly demonstrated her own bias towards\n        fComplainant] where she does not apply the standard to her own\n        daughter as she does for [Complainant], even though they're\n        engaged in the same conduct.\n\n The trial court sustained the State's rule 608 objection.\n\n Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n       ln his first issue, Appellant argues that the evidence is insufficient      to\n\n support the jury's determination that, during the alleged aggravated sexual\n\n assaults, he, \"by acts or words placed [Complainant] in fear that death or serious\n\n bodily injury woufd be imminently inflicted on [her] or [her mother],\" as alleged in\n\ncounts one through four, eight, and nine.\n\n       ln our due-process review of the sufficiency of the evidence to support a\n\nconviction, we view all the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict to\n\ndetermine whether any rational trier      of fact could have found the     essential\n\nelements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.l This standard gives full play\n\nto the responsibility of the trier of fact to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to\n\nweigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to\n\nultimate facts.2\n\n\n\n\n     lJackson v. Virginia,443 U.S.\n                                     307, 319, 99 S. Ct. 2781 , 2789 (1979);\nDobbs v. State, 434 S.W.3d 166, 170 (Tex. Crim.

Ct. at 2789: Dobbs,434 S.W.3d at 170.\n\f          The trier of fact is the sole judge of the weight and credibility of the\n\n evidence.3 Thus, when performing an evidentiary sufficiency review, we may not\n\n re-evaluate the weight and credibility of ihe evidence and substitute our judgment\n\n for that of the factfinder.a lnstead, we determine whether the             necessary\n\n inferences are reasonable based upon the cumulative force of the evidence when\n\nviewed in the light most favorable to the verdict,5 We must presume that the\n\nfactfinder resolved any conflicting inferences in favor of the verdict and defer to\n\nthat resolution.6\n\n          ïhe   standard of review is the same for direct and circumstantial evidence\n\ncases; circumstantial evidence is as probative as direct evidence in establishing\n\nthe guilt of an actor.7\n\n          Complainant testified that Appellant had told her (1) that he knew people in\n\nMexico associated with the Mexican mafia and that they would kill her and her\n\nmother without the killings being traced back to him and (2) a story about a man\n\n\n     3See Tex.\n               Code Crim.

Sfafes and its progeny to argue that the threats\n\nwere not imminent because they were conditional.           fhe   Blount courl found\n\ninsufficient the attackers' telling the victim that if she told, they would come back\n\nand kill her because the threat was conditional.s As the State points oul, Blount\n\nrelied on a former version of the statute that required not only that the threat was\n\nmade but that       it   \"compelled submission to the rape.\"'o That language was\n\nremoved from the statute when it was later amended, and consequently, as the\n\nState argues, it does not apply to this offense.11\n\n      Further, a child cannot consent to sexual contact or intercourse.l2 There is\n\nno efement of compulsion required to be proved in the aggravated sexual assault\n\n\n      u542\n              S.W.2d'164 (Tex.

Complainant said in her outcry and repeated at trial that Appellant-who\n\n for most of the period of the continuing offenses was a person lurking in the\n\n background    of her life-made various death threats to keep her participating\n silently in the sexual relationship.

Judge Cochran has explaíned,\n\n              Trials involving sexual assault may raise particular evidentiary\n       and constitutional concerns because the credibility of both the\n       complainant and defendant is a central, often dispositive, issue.\n       Sexual assault cases are frequently \"he said, she said\" trials in\n       which the jury must reach a unanimous verdict based solely upon\n       iwo diametrically different versions of an event, unaided by any\n        physical, scientific, or other corroborative evidence. Thus, the Rules\n       of  Evidence, especially Rule 403, should be used sparingly to\n       exclude relevant, otherwise admissible evidence that might bear\n       upon the credibility of either the defendant or complainant in such\n       \"he said, she said\" cases. And Ïexas law, as well as the federal\n       constitution, requires great latitude when the evidence deals with a\n       witness's specific bias, motive, or interest to testify in a particular\n       fashion.\n\n              But, as the Supreme Court noted in Davis v. Alaska, there is\n      an important distinction between an attack on the general credibility\n      of a witness and a more particular attack on credibility that reveals\n      \"possible biases, prejudices, or ulterior motives of the witness as\n      they may relate directly to issues or personalities in the case at\n      hand,\" Thus, under Dayrs, \"the exposure of a witness' motivation in\n      testifying is a proper and important function of the constitutionally\n      protected right of cross-examination.\" However, as Justice Stewart\n      noted in concurrence, the Court neither held nor suggested that the\n      Constitution confers a right to impeach the general credibility of a\n      witness through otherwise prohibited modes of cross-examination.\n      Thus, the Dayrs Court did not hold that a defendant has an absolute\n      constitutionaf right to impeach the general credibility of a witness in\n      any fashion that he chooses. But the constitution is offended if the\n      state evidentiary rule would prohibit him from cross-examining a\n      witness concerning possible motives, bias, and prejudice to such an\n      extent that he could not present a vital defensive theory.18\n\n\n\n\n      lsHammer     v.   State, 296 S.W.3d 555, 561-63 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009)\n(footnotes omitted).\n\f        A witness's credibility may be attacked in three ways: opinion or reputation\n\n for general iruthfulness or untruthfulness and cross-examination on specific\n instances of conduct that establish bias, sellinterest, or motive for testifying as\n\n he or she did.re Opinion evidence is not the same as reputation evidence.20 As\n\n this court has explained,\n\n       Reputation witnesses' testimony must be based on discussion w¡th\n       others about the subject, or on hearing others discuss the person's\n       reputation, and not just on personal knowledge. Rule 405 requires\n       only \"substantial familiarity\" with the reputation of the accused.2l\n\n        Reputation evidence, then, must necessarily be grounded in hearsay.22\n\nAn objection that the testimony of reputation evidence is hearsay and not based\n\non personal knowledge thus will not lie.23 Opinion testimony is governed by rule\n\nof evidence 701 and must be based on personal observation.2a\n\n       Within this general framework, Judge Cochran, speaking for the\nunanimous Hammer court, has explained why Texas, unlike many other states,\n\n\n\n\n       leTex.\n                R.

Evid. 701.\n\fdoes not allow a defendant in a sexual assault case to impeach the complainant\n\nwith evidence of prior false accusations:\n\n             The theory for admitting prior false accusations of rape in a\n      sex-offense prosecution is frequently analogized to Aesop's story of\n      \"The Boy Who Cried Wolf.\" A past false accusation makes it more\n      likely that the witness lacks credibility and thus should not be\n      believed concerning this accusatíon. But in Aesop's fable, there\n      really was a wolf, and it killed the sheep. The moral of that story was\n      \"Nobody believes a liar . . even when he is telling the truth.\" A\n      criminal trial, however, is designed to find the truth about a specific\n      incident, not to decide whether someone has lied in the past about\n      the presence of wolves or about being raped. Prior false allegations\n      of rape do not tend to prove or disprove any of the elements of the\n      charged sexual offense.\n\n           Therefore, Texas, unlike some jurisdictions, has not created a\n     per se exception to Rule 608(b)'s general prohibition against\n     impeachment with specific instances of conduct to admit evidence of\n     the complainant's pr¡or false allegations of abuse or molestation.\n     The inferential chain of logic that is barred by Rule 608(b) is this:\n\n             The witness lied to his employer (or did some specific act of\n             dishonesty)\n\n             That specific conduct proves dishonest character;\n\n             Therefore, the witness is generally dishonest and should not\n             be believed in this case.\n\n     Applied to prior false accusations, the barred evidentiary chain is\n     this:\n\n             Complainant made a prior false accusation;\n\n             That specific conduct proves dishonest character;\n\n             Therefore, the complainant is generally dishonest and should\n             not be believed in this case.\n\n          This is precisely the prohibited propensity chain of logic-\n     \"Once a thief, always a thief,\" \"Once a liar, always a liar\"-that\n     underlies both Rules 404(b) and 608(b). A sexual assault\n\n\n                                       15\n\f compla¡nant is not a volunteer for an exercise in character\n assassination. Several federal courts have held that exclusion of\n this evidence, offered to attack the victim's general credibility, does\n not violate the Confrontation Clause.\n\n          lf, however, the cross-examiner offers evidence of a prior false\naccusation of sexual activity for some purpose other than a\npropensity atiack upon the witness's general character for\ntruthfulness, it may well be admissible under our state evidentiary\n rules.\n\n       For example, in Billodeau y. Sfafe, we held that the trial court\n should have admitted evidence that the child complainant in that\naggravated sexual assault prosecution had made threats to falsely\naccuse two neighbors of sexual molestation. We held that such\nevidence supported the defensive theory that the complainant's\nmotive in accusing the defendant of sexual molestation was \"rage\nand anger\" when he was thwarted. Evidence of threats to accuse\nothers of sexual molestation when he displayed \"rage and anger\" at\nbeing thwarted is some evidence of a common motive for accusing\nthe defendant of sexual molestation. The chain of logic is as follows:\n\n      The victim makes false accusations in certain circumstances\nand for certain reasons;\n\n          Those circumstances and reasons are present in this case;\n\n          Therefore, the victim made a false accusation in this case.\n\n          One might even call this modus operand¡ ev¡dence admissible\nunder Rule 404(b). Evidence of other acts or wrongs may be\nadmissible under Rule 404(b) to prove such matters as motive,\nintent, scheme, or any other relevant purpose except conduct in\nconformity with bad character. Even \"the doctrine of chances\" has\nbeen invoked as a possible basis for admitting evidence of a victim's\nprior false accusation of rape. Similarly, evidence of a victim's prior\nsexual activity may be admissible under Rule 412, lhe Texas Rape\nShield Law, when offered to establish the victim's motive or bias\nagainst the defendant.\n\n       ln sum, several different state evidentiary rules permit the use\nof prior false accusations when offered to show the witness's bias or\nmotive or for some other relevant, noncharacter purpose. The\nConfrontation Clause mandate of Davrs v. Alaska is not inconsistent\n\n\n                                     16\n\f       with Texas evidence law. Thus, compliance with a rule of evidence\n       will, in most instances, avoid a constitutional question concerning ihe\n       admissibility of such evidence.25\n\n We now examine the case at bar.\n\n       Prior Rape\n\n       Appeflant argues that the trial courl abused its discretion by excluding\n\n May's testimony that he had heard a rumor that Complainant was telling people\n\nthat he had sexually assaulted her and Redmon's testimony pertaining to the\n\nalleged incident. Appellant offered May's testimony under rule of evidence\n\n 404(b).26 While Appellant now argues that the trial court's ruling abridged certain\n\nof his constitutional rights, at trial he spoke only of credibility and Rule 404(b).\n\nAppellant's complaints at trial do not conform to his constitutional complaints on\n\nappeal; we therefore do not address his constitutional complaints.2T\n\n      Additionally, May's testimony dealt with rumors on the street; it did not\n\nconstitute testimony of Complainant's reputation for truthfulness, nor were his\n\nclaims that he had heard that she was spreading rumors                 in any    way\n\nsubstantiated to provide a basis for an opinion that she was not worthy of belief\n\nunder oath. And to the e)dent that his testimony was intended to be evidence of\n\n\n\n      'uHammer,296 S.W.3d at 564-66 (footnotes omitted).\n      26lex. R. Evid. 404(b).\n\n      27see\n             Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a)(1); Lovill v. Sfafe, 319 S.W.3d 687, 691-92\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2009).\n\f prior false accusations of sexual assault, such test¡mony is not admissible for the\n\n purpose of showing her character conformity or propensity to lie,28\n\n         Although Appellant also argues that the evidence was admissible to show\n\n motive and modus operandi, May candidly admiited that Complainant never\n\naccused him to his face of raping    her. His belief that she had accused him was\nbased on rumors that he had heard. The record does not establish confirmation\n\nof May's belief that she falsely accused him of rape. Nor do the rumors he heard\n\nsuggest a motive for falsely accusing Appellant or a modus operandi. May said\n\nthat Complainant would ask him to have sex with her, and he refused. But we\n\ncannot discern how the rumors he heard thai she was accusing him of rape were\n\never verified. The record before this court therefore does not establish the\n\nadmissibilíty of this evidence of purported false accusations of rape under rule\n\n404(b).\n\n         At trial, Appellant explained in seeking admission of the false accusation\n\ntestimony, \"the false claim    of rape is going to credibility.\" We hold that the\nrumors of false rape accusations were not admissible, and based on the record\n\nbefore us, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellant's\n\nrequest to present this evidence before the    jury. We overrule Appellant's   third\n\nissue.\n\n\n\n\n         28See\n                 Hammer, 296 S.W.3d at 564.\n\n\n\n                                         1B\n\f Redmon's and Brown's Opinion Testimony\n\n       ln his fourth and fifth issues, Appellant complains of the exclusion of the\n\n testimony of Redmon and Brown concerning their opinions of Complainant's\n\n credibility. As we understand the record, Appellant appears to have offered\n\n these opinions by having the women explain specific acts that they suspected\n\n had occurred and speculate on others. He did not offer their testimony on any\n\nconstitutional basis, We therefore do noi address the constitutional arguments\n\nhe raises on appeal.2e\n\n       Redmon's testimony was based on her belief that Complainant had lied\n\nand had told Redmon's daughter to lie about having given Complainant things\n\nthat Complainant had stolen from Redmon's daughter. Redmon also believed\n\nthat Complainant had lied to her and to her daughter about dating, smoking\n\nmarijuana, and being raped. Appellant explained to the trial court that he was\n\noffering Redmon's testimony as \"possible opinion testimony on truthfulness.\"\n\n      Brown believed that Complainant had spread untruthful rumors about her\n\ndaughter and that she had stolen her daughter's nail polish. We are not clear on\n\nthe legal basis for which Appellant offered this evidence, other than as an opinion\n\nof Complainant's truthfulness. Judge Keasler has explained for the Texas Court\n\nof Criminal Appeals,\n\n\n\n      2esee\n              Tex. R. App P. 33.1(a)(1); Lovítt,319 S.W.3d at691-92\n\f [A] less common notion of error preservation comes into play in this\n case, although certainly not a novel one. Professors Goode,\n Wellborn and Sharlot refer to it as \"party responsibílity.      \"\n                                                               They\n explain it this way:\n\n             To the question, which pady has the responsibility\n       regarding any particular matter, it is infallibly accurate to\n       answer with another question: which pafty                  is\n       complaining now on appeal? This is because in a real\n       sense both parties are always responsible for the\n       application of any evidence rule to any evidence.\n       Whichever party complains on appeal about the trial\n       judge's action must, at the earliest opportunity, have\n       done everything necessary to bring to the judge's\n       attention the evidence rule in question and its precise\n       and proper application to the evidence in question.\n\nThe basis for party responsibility is, among other things, Appellate\nRule 33.'1 . lt provides that as a prerequisite to presenting a\ncomplaint for appellate review, the record must show that the party\n\"stated the grounds for the ruling that (he) sought from the trial court\nwith sufficient specificity to make the trial couÍ aware of the\ncomplaint.\" So it is not enough to tell the judge that evidence is\nadmissible. The proponent, if he is the losing party on appeal, must\nhave told the judge why the evidence was admissible,\n\n        We recently discussed this notion in Ma¡finez y. Sfafe. There,\n the defendant moved to suppress oral statements due to the State's\n failure to comply with Art. 20.17. -lhe State argued for the first time\n on appeal that Art. 20.17 did not apply. We concluded that the State\n forfeited this argument by failing to bring it to the trial judge's\n attention. We explained that \"both Texas Rule of Appellate\n Procedure 33.1 and Texas Rule of Evidence 103 are 'judge-\n protecting' rules of error preservation. The basic principle of both\n rules is that of 'party responsibility.\"' We recognized that \"the party\ncomplaining on appeal (whether it be the State or the defendant)\nabout a trial court's admission, exclusion, or suppression of evidence\nmust, at the earlíest opportunity, have done everything necessary to\nbring to the judge's attention the evidence rule or statute in question\nand its precise and proper application to the evidence in question.\"\nThe issue, we said, \"is not whether the appealing party is the State\nor the defendant or whether the trial court's ruling is legally 'correct'\nin every sense, but whether the complaining party on appeal brought\n\n\n                                   20\n\f to the trial court's aitention the very complaint that party is     now\n making on appeal.\"\n\n       Similarly, in Willover y. Sfafe, the defendant sought to admit\n two videotaped interviews of the victim. At trial,\n\n       it (was) clear that, although (the defendant) did not\n       aciually recite the specific rule of evidence he was\n       relying upon, (he) sought to admit the videotapes for\n       impeachment purposes. (He) did not argue, nor was\n       there any discussion at trial, that the tapes were not\n       hearsay or that the videotapes were admissible under\n       any exception to the hearsay rule other than Article\n       38.071 or for impeachment purposes.\n\n       On appeal, the defendant argued for the first time that the\nvideotapes were not hearsay. We relied on the notion of \"party\nresponsibility\" to reject this argument because \"(i)n order to have\nevidence admitted under a hearsay exception, the proponent of the\nevidence must specify which exception he is relying upon.\" lt was\nup to the defendant, we said, and ''not the trial court, to specify\nwhich exception to the hearsay rule he was relying upon or to\nspecify how the evidence was not hearsay.\"\n\n       ln some cases, we have applied the \"party responsibility\"\ntheory without using those precise words. ln Clark v. Sfafe, the\nState presented the testimony of Dr. James Grigson that the\ndefendant would be a future danger. The defendant sought at trial\nto introduce a letter and accompany¡ng report which listed eleven\nindividuals convicted of capital murder whose sentences had later\nbeen commuted or reduced. ln several of those cases, Dr. Grigson\nhad predicted that the individual would be a future danger. The trial\ncourt refused to admit the evidence.\n\n      On appeal, the defendant argued that the excluded evidence\nwas admissible to impeach Dr. Grigson and show that his prior\nfuture dangerousness predictions had turned out to be incorrect.\nBut the defendant had not articulated this basis for admission at trial.\nAt trial, he had argued the evidence was admissible to impeach\nstatements that Dr. Gr¡gson had made in Lubbock County. The\nState had objected that the impeachment went to a collateral matter,\nand the trial judge had agreed.\n\f       We rejected the defendant's argument on appeal because he\n \"did not clearly articulate\" that he wanted to admit the evidence to\n demonstrate Grigson's past mistakes in predicting future\n dangerousness. We said that the trial judge \"never had the\n opportunity to rule upon (the defendant's) appellate rationale.\" Since\n the defendant \"did not sufficiently clearly expressly offer the\n evidence for the purpose which he now claims on appeal,'' that\n argument could not be raised on appeal.\n\n       Finally, in Jones v. Sfafe, the defendant sought at trial to admit\n the grand jury testimony of a witness who asserted her Fifth\n Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and refused to\n testify. The State objected, claiming hearsay. We concluded that\n the defendant failed to preserve error because he never specified\n which portions of the witness's testimony he wanted to admit into\n evidence. We said:\n\n             The trial court need never sort through challenged\n      evidence in order to segregate the admissible from the\n      excludable, nor is the trial court required to admit only\n      the former part or exclude only the latter part. lf\n      evidence is offered and challenged which contains\n      some of each, the trial court may safely admit it all or\n      exclude it all, and the losing party, no matter who he is,\n      will be made to suffer on appeal the consequences of\n      his insufficiently specific offer or objection. ln this case,\n      because the trial court chose to exclude the evidence,\n      appellant is the party adversely affected by his own\n      default. Because appellant failed to specify which\n      portion of the transcript he intended to introduce into\n      evidence, the court was presented with a proffer\n      containing both admissible and inadmissible evidence.\n      When evidence which       is partially admissible and\n      partially inadmissible is excluded, a party may not\n      complain upon appeal unless the admissible evidence\n      was specifically offered.\n\n                              Application\n\n        ln this case, Reyna argued to the trial judge that the evidence\nshould be admitted for \"credibilíty.\" He said that he was \"not offering\nit to prove the truth of the matter asserted\" and \"not offering it to go\ninto her sexuality.\" lnstead, he argued, \"l'm offering to             it\n\n                                  22\n\f demonstrate that as to prior sexual activities, that she made\n allegations that there were prior sexual allegaiions, and recanted.\"\n\n        Reyna did not cite to any rules of evidence, cases, or\n constitutional provisions. Reyna's references to \"the truth of the\n matter asserted\" reflect that he was arg uing that the evidence was\n not hearsay under Evidence Rule 801(d). His claim that he was not\n offering it \"to go into her sexuality\" reffects his argument that the\n evidence should not be excluded under Evidence Rule 412(b).\n These arguments are both based on the Rules of Evidence.\n Reyna's reference to \"credibility\" could be a reference to either the\n Rules of Evidence or the Confrontafion Clause.\n\n       Reyna told the trial judge that the purpose of admitting the\n evidence was to attack the victim's credibility, but he did not provide\nthe basis for admitting the evidence. He could have been relying on\nthe Rules of Evidence or the Confrontation Clause. lt was up to the\njudge to discern some basis for admitting the evidence.\n\n       We have said that \"(t)he purpose of requiring (an) objection is\nto give to the trial court or the opposing party the opportunity to\ncorrect the error or remove the basis for the objection.\" When a\ndefendant's objection encompasses complaints under both the\nTexas Rules of Evidence and the Confrontation Clause, the\nobjection is not sufficiently specific to preserve error. An objection\non hearsay does not preserve error on Confrontation Clause\ngrounds.\n\n       Although this case involves a proffer of evidence rather than\n an objection, the same rationale applies. Reyna did not argue that\nthe Confrontation Clause demanded admission of the evidence.\n Reyna's arguments for admitting the evidence could refer to either\nthe Rules of Evidence or the Confrontation Clause. His arguments\nabout hearsay did not put the trial judge on notice that he was\nmaking a Confrontation Clause argument. Because Reyna \"did not\nclearly articulate\" that the Confrontation Clause demanded\nadmission of the evídence, the trial judge \"never had the opportunity\nto rule upon\" this rationale. As the losing party, Reyna must \"suffer\non appeal the consequences of his insufficiently specific offer.\"\nReyna did not do \"everything necessary to bring to the judge's\n\f         attent¡on ihe evidence rule or statute in questior and its precise and\n         proper application to the evidence in question.\n\n         ln the case now before this court, Appellant offered the evidence on the\n\n  vague basis of \"possible\" opinion testimony. He did not sustain his burden of\n\n  explaining to the trial court on the record, and by extension to us, why Redmon,s\n\n and Brown's testimony was admissible-whether under an evidentiary rule or\n\n statute, as an exception to an evidentiary rule or statute, or under a constitutional\n\n provision.

The trial court sentenced hìm accordingly, ordering the\n\n sentences to be served concurrently. Appellant brings five issues on appeal,\n\n challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to show the aggravating element for\n\n the six convictions of aggravated sexual assault of a child (counts one through\n\n four, eight, and nine) and contending that the State misrepresented the law during\n\n voir dire and that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding evidence of the\n\n complainant's prior rape accusation against a neighbor and the testimony of two\n\nother witnesses. Because the evidence is sufficient to support the jury's verdict\n\nand because the trial court committed no reversible error, we affirm the trial\n\ncourt's judgments.\n\nBrief Facts\n\n      Appellant and Complainant's mother (Mother) had been a couple, had\n\nshared a home with Complainant and her brother, and were the parents of twin\n\nboys, Complainant's younger half-brothers. Appellant and Mother parted ways\n\nand went through a custody battle over the twins. On July, 4,2012, Complainant,\n\nwho was fourteen years old at the time, was at Appellant's home with her twin\n\nbrothers. Complainant and Mother were not getting along around this             time.\n\nAppellant tofd Complainant that he wanted to put Mother in a hole and hire some\n\nMexican assassins to hu¡f   her. ln the same conversation, Appellant suggested\n\f that Complainant have sex with him to make Mother mad, but Complainant\n\n refused his offer.\n\n         Later that same month, Complainant, along with her twin brothers, visited\n\n Appellant's parents in El Paso. During this trip, Complainant received messages\n\n from someone who identified himself as \"Jayylo\" through Kik, an application on\n\n her cell phone. Jayylo sent pictures of his penis to    her. She responded    by\n\n \"sen[ding] inappropriate pictures of [her] boobs.\" She never gave Jayylo her\n\n home address or her real name. Jayylo continued to send more pictures of\n\n himself to her. When Complainant threatened io stop sending Jayylo pictures, he\n\nthreatened    to send the photos she had sent him to her school and to        the\n\nmailboxes     of   Mother and her neighbors. Complainant noticed that the\nbackground of one of the photos he sent her resembled a portion of Appellant's\n\nhouse. Complainant was then suspicious that Appellant was Jayylo.\n\n        She confronted Appellant, but he denied having a Kik account. About an\n\nhour later, Appellant called Complainant back and asked her why he had pictures\n\nof her boobs in his mailbox. Complainant started crying and told him what had\n\nhappened with Jayylo and that he had threatened      her. Complainant also told\nAppellant's mother why she was crying, and Appellant got mad at Complainant\n\nfor telling his mother. Complainant turned fifteen years old while she was in El\n\nPaso,\n\n        When Complainant returned home from El Paso, she began receiving text\n\nmessages from Jayylo sent directly    to her cell phone number.     Complaínant\n\f noticed that the first six digits of Jayylo's phone number were the same as\n\n Appellant's cell phone number. Jayylo told her that he got her phone number\n\n from one of her friends, which Complainant knew not to be true. Whenever\n\n Complainant asked Jayylo who he really was, he would change his story of how\n\n Complainant was supposed to know him and how old he            was. Jayylo        texted\n\n Complainant almost every day at different times of the day. But she could never\n\n get a response when she called him.\n\n       Jayyfo continued threatening Complainant and demanded that she send\n\n him more photos, have sex with Appellant, videotape it, and send the video to\n\nJayylo. Complainant refused. Jayylo put one of the photos Complainant had sent\n\nhim on a Facebook page he had created and threatened to add all of her friends\n\nto that page. Appellant told Complainant that Jayylo was also contacting him, but\n\nshe never saw any of the messages that Appellant claimed to have received.\n\n       Appellant and Complainant spoke about the situation and decided to\n\nacquiesce   to   Jayylo's demands. Complainant and Appellant had sexual\n\nintercourse in Appellant's house while Complainant's twin brothers were asleep.\n\nFollowing Jayylo's demands, Appellant and Complainant continued their sexual\n\nrelatíonship. They had sexual intercourse \"eight to eleven times[,] [m]aybe more,\"\n\nfrom August 2012 to November 2012. These sexual encounters would occur at\n\neither Appellant's or Complainant's home.\n\n      Complainant testified that she texted Jayylo that it was getting harder for\n\nher to keep these incidents a secret, and shortly after she sent this   tef,   Appellant\n\f called her and told her ihat they did not \"have to do it anymore.\" Appellant then\n\n told Complainant a story about\n\n       a girl who was babysitting this guy's kids, and he ended up raping\n       her. And then she went to court, and then he pretended to be\n       somebody that he wasn't and hit her up on Facebook and that they\n       met up thinkíng it was somebody else, and he killed her.\n\n This story scared Complainant. At trial, she testified that Appellant knew people\n\n from Mexico who were in the Mexican Mafia. Although complainant testified that\n\n Appellant never specifically threatened her, she also testified that he made it\n\n clear that if he could hurt Mother, he could hurt Complainant   too. ln December\n 2012, Complaínant made an outcry to Mother's friend. Shortly afterward, the\n\ndecision to call the police was made. Appellant pled not guilty to all counts of an\n\neighteen-count indictment alleging that he had committed sexual assault and\n\naggravated sexual assault on various dates against Complainant.\n\n      Outside the presence of the jury, in an in-camera hearing, Appellant\n\npresented evidence from Ricky     May. May lived in Complainant's neighborhood\naround 2008 to    2009. He testified that when he was        eighteen years old,\n\nComplainant would contact him \"through phone [and] text messaging, trying to get\n\n[him] to have sexual intercourse with her\" because she was \"horny.\" May refused\n\nComplainant's offer, but he heard that Complainant had told people in their\n\nneighborhood that he had raped her, which he denied. May was never charged\n\nwith or arrested for rape. The State objected to May's testimony on hearsay\n\ngrounds.\n\f       THE    COURT:            Response?\n\n       IPROSECUTOR]: Once again, Your Honor, this is an opinion based\n                     upon hearsay. There's no proof that she ever\n                     said these things. And this is the type of\n                     reputation and opinion evidence that is, I believe,\n                     prohibited under 412 as is relating to sexual\n                     conduct and it's not fitting in one of the categories\n                     that allows for past behavior to be admissible.\n\n The trial court sustained the State's objection, and May was not permitted to\n\ntestify in front of the jury.\n\n       Appellant also offered testimony from Jeannie Redmon outside the\n\npresence of the     jury.   Redmon testified that she had known Complainant for\n\n\"[a]pproximately seven to eight years.\" Redmon testified that Complainant was\n\n\"untruthful\" because (1) she took items that belonged to Redmon's daughter, told\n\nRedmon that Redmon's daughter had given her the items when in fact, Redmon's\n\ndaughter had not, and instructed Redmon's daughter             to similarly lie; (2)   she\n\nwould tell Redmon and her daughter that she was dating people whom she was\n\nnot dating; (3) she had said that a boy across the street had raped her; and\n\n(4) she lied about giving out her phone number           to boys at a waterpark when\nRedmon asked her if she had done            so. Redmon also testified that she thought\nher daughter and Complainant had gone to pornographic websites on Redmon's\n\nhome computer. Appellant offered Redmon's testimony as her opinion on\n\nComplainant's truthfulness. The State objected to Redmon's testimony:\n\n      We'll object under rule 608 and 609, also 404. I think if this witness\n      knew [Complainant] presently, we would be legally okay wiih her\n      opinion that she's untruthful, but I think four years ago is a little bít too\n\f        remote. And certainly, even if that was allowed, the rules, specifically\n        608(b)l,l disallow specific instances of conduct. So we would object\n        to any specific instances.\n\n              Additionally, it sounds like almost all of this is hearsay and,\n       except for perhaps the opinion as to truthfulness. But the porn use, I\n       don't think we can say that this witness knows with her own personal\n       knowledge that it was definitely [Complainant]. lthink perhaps she's\n       basing that off of what her daughier has told her. And the same with\n       the false claim of rape, she's admitted on cross she really does noi\n       know what happened.\n\n The trial court sustained the State's objections, and Redmon was not permitted to\n\ntestify in front of the jury.\n\n       Appellant also presented evidence from Denise Brown outside the\n\npresence of the     jury.       Brown testified that Complainant was friends with her\n\ndaughter and that she knew Complainant in 2009 and 2010. Brown testified that\n\nComplainant was untruthful because Complainant (1) spread rumors that Brown's\n\ndaughter was pregnant and (2) took some fingernail polish belonging to Brown,s\n\ndaughter without permission             Brown also testified that Complainant was\n\nflirtatious   with boys and opined that             Complainant   was   promiscuous.\n\nComplainant's friendship with Brown's daughter ended when Brown's daughter\n\nbegan dating a boy whom Complainant had previously dated, and Complainant\n\nbegan calling Brown's daughter            a \"slut.\" The State objected to Brown's\ntestimony:\n\n      The State would object as to. . . this witness. . . having no personal\n      knowledge of the things that she has referenced as far as her basis\n      for determining this-[Complainant's] credibility. She's basing it upon\n      hearsay. So we would object under 608.\n\f            Also, as far as going into specific instances of conduct, she\n       doesn't-she did not personally observe them or have personal\n       knowledge as io them.\n\n            Also, we'd object under 404, 403 as to her general\n       characterization of [Complainant's being] boy crazy,\n       promiscuous. . . . [S]he has clearly demonstrated her own bias\n       towards [Complainant] where she does not apply the standard to her\n       own daughter as she does for [Complainant], even though they're\n       engaged in the same conduct.\n\n The trial court sustained the State's rule 608 objection.\n\n Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n       ln his first issue, Appellant argues thai the evidence is      insufficient to\n\nsupport the jury's determination that, during the alleged aggravated sexual\n\nassaults, he, \"by acts or words placed [Complainant] in fear that death or serious\n\nbodily injury would be imminently inflicted on [her] or [her mother],\" as alleged in\n\ncounts one through four, eight, and nine.\n\n       ln our due-process review of the sufficiency of the evidence to support a\n\nconviction, we view all the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict to\n\ndetermine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential\n\nelements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.r This standard gives full play\n\nto the responsibility of the trier of fact to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to\n\n\n\n\n     lJackson v. Virginia,443 U.S. 307,\n                                           319, 99 S. Ct. 2781 , 2789 (1979);\nDobbs v. State, 434 S.W.3d 166, 170 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014).\n\f weigh the ev¡dence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to\n\n ultimate facts.2\n\n        The trier of fact is the sole judge of the weight and credibility of the\n\n evidence.3 Thus, when performing an evidentiary sufficiency review, we may not\n\n re-evaluate the weight and credibility of the evidence and substitute our judgment\n\n for that of the factfinder.a lnstead, we determine whether the          necessary\n\n inferences are reasonable based upon the cumulative force of ihe evidence when\n\n viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict.s We must presume that the\n\n factfinder resolved any conflicting inferences in favor of the verdict and defer to\n\n that resolution.6\n\n       The standard of review is the same for direct and circumstantial evidence\n\ncases; circumstantial evidence is as probative as direct evidence in establishing\n\nthe guilt of an actor.T\n\n\n\n       2Jackson,443 U.S.\n                         at 319, 99 S.

Sfafes and its progeny to argue that the threats\n\nwere not imminent because they were conditional.            îhe   Blount court found\n\ninsufficient the attackers' telling the victim that if she told, they would come back\n\nand kill her because the threat was conditional.e As the State points out, Blount\n\nrelied on a former version of the statute that required not only that the threat was\n\nmade but that ít \"compelled submission to the rape.\"1o That language was\n\nremoved from the statute when it was later amended, and consequently, as the\n\nState argues, it does not apply to this offense.   11\n\n\n\n\n      8542\n              S.W.2d 164 (Tex.

She understood these threats to be continuing threats of imminent\n\nharm at any time. 15 The record supports that interpretation under the unique\n\nfacts of this case.

Judge Cochran has explained,\n\n            Trials involving sexual assault may raise particufar evidentiary\n      and constitutional concerns because the credibility of both the\n      complainant and defendant is a central, often dispositive, issue.\n      Sexual assault cases are frequently \"he said, she said\" trials in\n     which the jury must reach a unanimous verdict based solely upon\n     two diametrically different versions of an event, unaided by any\n      physical, scientific, or other corroborative evidence. Thus, the Rules\n     of Evidence, especially Rule 403, should be used sparingly to\n     exclude relevant, otherwise admissible evidence that might bear\n     upon the credibilíty of either the defendant or complainant in such\n     \"he said, she said\" cases. And Texas law, as well as the federaf\n     constitution, requires great latitude when the evidence deals with a\n     witness's specific bias, motive, or interest to testify in a pariicular\n     fashion.\n\n             But, as the Supreme Court noted in Davis v. Alaska, there is\n     an important distinction between an attack on the general credibility\n     of a witness and a more particular attack on credibility that reveals\n     \"possible biases, prejudices, or ulterior motives of the witness as\n     they may relate directly to issues or personalities in ihe case at\n     hand.\" Thus, under Dayis, \"the exposure of a witness' motivation in\n     testifying is a proper and important function of the constitutionally\n     protecied right of cross-examination.  \"However, as Justice Stewarl\n     noted in concurrence, the Court neither held nor suggested that the\n     Constitution confers a right to impeach the general credibility of a\n     witness through otherwise prohibited modes of cross-examination.\n     ïhus, the Davrs Court did not hold that a defendant has an absolute\n     constitutional right to impeach the general credibility of a witness in\n     any fashion that he chooses. But the constitution is offended if the\n     state evidentiary rule would prohibit him from cross-examining a\n\n\n\n\n                                       13\n\f       witness concerning possible motives, bias, and prejudice to such an\n       extent that he could not preseni a vital defensive theory.î8\n\n       A witness's credibility may be attacked in three ways: opinion or reputation\n\nfor general truthfulness or untruthfulness and cross-examination on         specifrc\n\ninstances of conduct that establish bias, self-interest, or mot¡ve for testifying as\n\nhe or she did.1s Opinion evidence is not the same as reputation evidence.20 As\n\nthis couri has explained,\n\n      Reputation witnesses' testimony must be based on discussion with\n      others about the subject, or on hearing others discuss the person's\n      reputation, and not just on personal knowledge. Rule 405 requires\n      only \"substantial familiarity\" with the reputation of the accused.2l\n\n      Reputation evidence, then, must necessarily be grounded in hearsay.22\n\nAn objection that the test¡mony of reputation evidence is hearsay and not based\n\non personal knowledge thus will not lie.23 Opinion testimony is governed by rule\n\nof evidence 701 and must be based on personal observation.2a\n\n\n      tuHammer       v.

Evid. 701.\n\f      Within this general framework, Judge Cochran, speaking               for   the\n\nunan¡mous Hammer court, has explained why Texas, unlike many other states,\n\ndoes not allow a defendant in a sexual assault case to impeach the complainant\n\nwiih evidence of prior false accusations:\n\n             ïhe theory for admitting prior false accusations of rape in a\n       sex-offense prosecution is frequently anafogized to Aesop's story of\n      \"The Boy Who Cried Wolf.\" A past false accusation makes it more\n      likely that the witness lacks credibility and thus should not be\n      believed concerning this accusation. But in Aesop's fable, there\n      really was a wolf, and it killed the sheep. The moral of that story was\n      \"Nobody believes a liar . . even when he is telling the truth.\" A\n      criminal trial, however, is designed to find the truth about a specific\n      incident, not to decide whether someone has lied in the past about\n      the presence of wolves or about being raped. Prior false allegations\n      of rape do not tend to prove or disprove any of the elements of the\n      charged sexual offense.\n\n           Therefore, Texas, unlike some jurisd¡ctions, has not created a\n      per se exception    to Rule 608(b)'s general prohibition against\n     impeachment with specific instances of conduct to admit evidence of\n     the complainant's prior false allegations of abuse or molestation.\n     ïhe inferential chain of logic that is barred by Rule 608(b) is this:\n             The witness lied to his employer (or did some specific act of\n             dishonesty)\n\n             That specific conduct proves dishonest character;\n\n             Therefore, the witness is generally dishonest and should not\n             be believed in this case.\n\n     Applied to prior false accusations, the barred evidentiary chain is\n     this:\n\n             Complainant made a prior false accusation;\n\n             ïhat specific conduct proves dishonest character;\n             Therefore, the complainant is generally dishonest and should\n             not be believed in this case-\n\n\n                                        15\n\f      This is precisely the prohibited propensity chain of logic-\n \"Once a thief, always a thief,\" \"Once a liar, always a liar\"-that\n underlies both Rules 404(b) and 608(b). A sexual assault\n complainani ís not a volunteer for an exercise in character\n assassination. Severaf federal courts have held that exclusion of\n this evidence, offered to attack the victim's general credibility, does\n not violate the Confrontation Clause.\n\n        lf, however, the cross-examiner offers evidence of a prior false\n accusation of sexual activity for some purpose other than a\n propensity attack upon the wiiness's general character for\n truthfulness, it may well be admissible under our state evídentiary\n rules.\n\n       For example, in Billodeau v. State, we held that the trial court\n should have admitted evidence that the child complainant in that\n aggravated sexual assault prosecution had made threats to falsely\naccuse two neighbors of sexual molestation. We held that such\nevidence supported the defensive theory that the complainant's\nmotive in accusing the defendant of sexual molestation was \"rage\nand anger\" when he was thwarted. Evidence of threats to accuse\nothers of sexual molestation when he displayed \"rage and anger\" at\nbeing thwarted is some evidence of a common motive for accusing\nthe defendant of sexual molestation. The chain of logic is as follows:\n\n          The victim makes false accusations in certain circumstances\nand for certain reasons;\n\n          Those circumstances and reasons are present in this case;\n\n          Therefore, the victim made a false accusation in this case.\n\n          One might even call this modus operandi evidence admissible\nunder Rule 404(b). Evidence of other acts or wrongs may be\nadmissible under Rule 404(b) to prove such matters as motive,\nintent, scheme, or any other relevant purpose except conduct in\nconformity with bad character. Even \"the doctrine of chances\" has\nbeen invoked as a possible basis for admitting evidence of a victim's\nprior false accusation of rape. Similarly, evidence of a victim's prior\nsexual activity may be admissible under Rule 412, fhe Texas Rape\nShield Law, when offered to establish the victim's motive or bias\nagainst the defendant.\n\n\n\n\n                                     16\n\f                ln sum, several different state ev¡dentiary rufes permit the use\n       of prior   false accusations when offered to show the witness's bias or\n       motive or for some other relevant, noncharacter purpose. The\n       Confrontation Clause mandate of Dayrs v. Alaska is not inconsistent\n       with Texas evidence law. Thus, compliance with a rule of evidence\n       will, in most instances, avoid a constitutional question concerning the\n       admissibility of such evidence.25\n\n We now examine the case at bar.\n\n      Prior Rape\n\n      Appellant argues that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding\n\nMay's testimony that he had heard a rumor that Complainant was telling people\n\nthat he had sexually assaulted her and Redmon's testimony pertaining to the\n\nafleged incident. Appellant offered May's testimony under rule of evidence\n\n404(b).26 While Appellant now argues that the trial court's ruling abridged cefain\n\nof his constitutional rights, at trial he spoke only of credibility and Rule 4O4(b).\n\nAppellant's complaints at trial do not conform to his constitutional complaints on\n\nappeal; we therefore do not address his constitutional complaints.2T\n\n      Additionally, May's testimony dealt with rumors on the street; it did not\n\nconstitute testimony of Complainant's repuiation for truthfulness, nor were his\n\nclaims that he had heard that she was spreadíng rumors                  in any way\n\n      2uHammer,296\n                       S.W.3d at 564-€6 (footnotes omitted).\n     26Tex.\n              R.

App. 2009).\n\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\f substantiated to provide a basis for an opinion that she was not worthy of belief\n\n under oath. And to the extent that his testimony was intended to be evidence of\n\n prior false accusations of sexual assault, such testimony is not admissibfe for the\n\n purpose of showing her character conformity or propensity to lie.28\n\n       Although Appellant also argues that the evidence was admissible to show\n\nmotíve and modus operandi, May candidly admitted that Complainant never\n\naccused him to his face of raping   her. His belief that she had accused hlm was\nbased on rumors that he had heard. The record does not establish confirmation\n\nof May's belief that she falsely accused him of rape. Nor do the rumors he heard\n\nsuggest a motive for falsely accusing Appellant or a modus operandi. May said\n\nthat Complainant would ask him to have sex with her, and he refused. But we\n\ncannot discern how the rumors he heard that she was accusing him of rape were\n\never verified. The record before this court therefore does not establish the\n\nadmissibility of this evidence of purported false accusations of rape under rule\n\n404(b).\n\n      At trial, Appellant explained in seeking admission of the false accusation\n\ntestimony, \"the false claim of rape is going    to credibility.\" We hold that the\nrumors of false rape accusations were not admissible, and based on the record\n\nbefore us, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellant's\n\n\n\n      28See\n              Hammer 296 S.W.3d at 564.\n\n\n\n                                        1B\n\f request to present this evidence before the     jury. We   overrule Appellant's third\n\n issue.\n\n Redmon's and Brown's Opinion Testimony\n\n          ln his fourth and fifth issues, Appellant complains of the exclusion of the\n\n testimony of Redmon and Brown concerning their opinions of Complainant's\n\n credibility. As we understand the record, Appellant appears to have offered\n\nthese opinions by having the women explain specific acts that they suspected\n\n had occurred and speculate on others. He did not offer their testimony on any\n\nconstitutional basis. We therefore do not address the constiiutionaf arguments\n\nhe raises on appeal.2e\n\n          Redmon's testimony was based on her belief ihat Complainant had lied\n\nand had told Redmon's daughter to lie about having given Complainant things\n\nthat Complainani had stolen from Redmon's daughter. Redmon also believed\n\nthat Complainant had lied to her and to her daughter about dating, smoking\n\nmarijuana, and being raped. Appellant explained to the trial court that he was\n\noffering Redmon's test¡mony as \"possibfe opinion testimony on truthfulness.\"\n\n      Brown believed that Complainant had spread untruthful rumors about her\n\ndaughter and that she had stolen her daughter's nail polish. We are not clear on\n\nthe legal basis for which Appellant offered this ev¡dence, other than as an opinion\n\n\n\n      2eSeeTex. R\n                      App P.33.1(aX1); Lovitt,319 S.W.3d at.691-92\n\n\n\n                                          19\n\fof Complainant's truthfulness. Judge Keasler has explained for the Ïexas Court\n\nof Criminal Appeals,\n\n      [A] less common notion of error preservation comes into play in this\n      case, although certainly not a novel one. Professors Goode,\n      Wellborn and Sharlot refer to it as \"party responsibility.\" They\n      explain it this way:\n\n                  To the question, which party has the responsibility\n            regarding any particular matter, it is infallibly accurate to\n            answer with another question: which party                  is\n            complaining now on appeal? This is because in a real\n            sense both pafiies are always responsible for the\n           application of any evidence rule to any evidence.\n           Whichever party complains on appeal about the trial\n           judge's action must, at the earliest opportunity, have\n           done everything necessary to bring to the judge's\n           attention the evidence rule in question and its precise\n           and proper application to the evidence in question.\n\n     The basis for party responsibility is, among other things, Appellate\n     Rule 33.1 . lt provides that as a prerequisite to presenting a\n     complaint for appellate review, the record must show that the party\n     \"stated the grounds for the ruling that (he) sought from the trial court\n     with sufficient specificity to make the trial court aware of the\n     complaint.\" So it is not enough to tell the judge that evidence is\n     admissible. The proponent, if he is the losing party on appeal, must\n     have told the judge why the evidence was admissible.\n\n           We recently discussed this notion in Ma¡tinez y. Sfafe. There,\n    the defendant moved to suppress oral statements due to the State's\n    failure to comply with Art. 20.17. The State argued for the first tíme\n    on appeal that Art. 20.17 did not apply. We concluded that the State\n    forfeited this argument by failing to bring it to the trial judge's\n    attention. We explained that \"both Texas Rule of Appellate\n    Procedure 33.1 and Texas Rule of Evidence 103 are 'judge-\n    protecting' rules of error preservation. The basic principle of both\n    rules is that of 'party responsibility. \"' We recognized that \"the party\n    complaining on appeal (whether rt be the State or the defendant)\n    about a trial court's admissíon, exclusion, or suppression of evidence\n    must, at the earliest oppoñunity, have done everything necessary to\n    bring to the judge's attention the evidence rule or statute in question\n\n\n                                       20\n\f and its precise and proper applicat¡on to the evidence in question.\"\n The issue, we said, \"is not whether the appealing party is the State\n or the defendant or whether the trial court's ruling is legally 'correct'\n in every sense, but whether the complaining party on appeal brought\n to the trial court's attention the very complaint that party is now\n making on appeal.\"\n\n       Similarly, in Willover v. State, the defendant soughi to admit\n two videotaped interviews of the victim. At trial,\n\n       it (was) clear that, although (the defendant) did not\n       actualfy recite the specific rule of evidence he was\n       relying upon, (he) sought to admit the videotapes for\n       impeachment purposes. (He) did not argue, nor was\n       there any discussion at trial, that the tapes were not\n       hearsay or that the videotapes were admissible under\n       any exception to the hearsay rule other than Article\n       38.071 or for impeachment purposes.\n\n       On appeal, the defendant argued for the first time that the\nvideotapes were not hearsay. We relied on the notion of \"party\nresponsibility\" to reject this argument because \"(i)n order to have\nevidence admitted under a hearsay exception, the proponent of the\nevidence must specify which exception he is relyíng upon.\" lt was\nup to the defendant, we said, and \"not the trial court, to specify\nwhich exception to the hearsay rule he was relying upon or to\nspecify how the evidence was not hearsay.\"\n\n       ln some cases, we have applied the \"party responsibility\"\ntheory without using those precise words. ln Clark y. Sfafe, the\nState presented the testimony of Dr. James Grigson that the\ndefendant would be a future danger. The defendant sought at trial\nto introduce a letter and accompanying report which listed eleven\nindividuals convicted of capital murder whose sentences had later\nbeen commuted or reduced. ln several of those cases, Dr. Grigson\nhad predicted that the individual would be a future danger. The trial\ncoud refused to admit the evidence.\n\n      On appeal, the defendant argued that the excluded evidence\nwas admissible to impeach Dr. Grigson and show that his prior\nfuture dangerousness predictions had turned out to be incorrect.\nBut the defendant had not articulated this basis for admission at trial.\nAt trial, he had argued the evidence was admissible to impeach\n\n\n                                  21\n\fstatements that Dr. Grigson had made in Lubbock County. The\nState had objected that the impeachment went to a collateral matter,\nand the trial judge had agreed.\n\n      We rejected the defendant's argument on appeal because he\n\"did not clearly articulate\" that he wanted to admit the evidence to\ndemonstrate Grigson's past mistakes in predicting future\ndangerousness. We said that the trial judge \"never had the\nopportunity to rule upon (the defendant's) appellate rationale.\" Since\nthe defendant \"did not sufficiently clearly expressly offer the\nevidence for the purpose which he now claims on appeal,\" that\nargument could not be raised on appeal.\n\n      Finally, in Jones v. Sfafe, the defendant sought at trial to admit\nthe grand jury testimony of a witness who asserted her Fifih\nAmendment privilege against self-incrimination and refused to\ntestify. The State objected, claiming hearsay. We concluded that\nthe defendant failed to preserve error because he never specified\nwhích portions of the wítness's testimony he wanted to admit into\nevidence. We said:\n\n            The trial court need never sort through challenged\n      evidence in order to segregate the admissible from the\n     excludable, nor is the trial court required to admit only\n     the former part or exclude only the latter part. lf\n     evidence is offered and challenged which contains\n     some of each, the trial court may safely admit it all or\n     exclude it all, and the losing party, no matter who he ís,\n     will be made to suffer on appeal the consequences of\n     his insufficiently specific offer or objection. ln this case,\n     because the trial court chose to exclude the evidence,\n     appellant is the party adversely affected by his own\n     default. Because appellant failed to specify which\n     portion of the transcript he intended to introduce into\n     evidence, the couÍ was presented with a proffer\n     containing both admissible and inadmissible evidence.\n     When evidence which         is\n                                  partlally admissible and\n     partially inadmissible is excluded, a party may not\n     complain upon appeal unless the admissible evídence\n     was specifically offered.\n\n\n\n\n                                 22\n\f                               Application\n\n         ln this case, Reyna argued to the trial judge that the evidence\n should be admitted for \"credibility.\" He said that he was \"not offering\n it to prove the truth of the matter asserted\" and \"not offering it to go\n into her sexuality.\" lnstead, he argued, \"l'm offering to         it\n demonstrate that as to prior sexual activities, that she made\n allegations that there were prior sexual allegations, and recanted.\"\n\n        Reyna did not cite to any rules of evidence, cases, or\n constitutional provisions. Reyna's references to \"the truth of the\n matter asserted\" reflect that he was arguing that the evidence was\n not hearsay under Evidence Rule 801(d). His claim that he was not\n offer¡ng it \"to go into her sexuality\" reflects his argument that the\n evidence should not be excluded under Evidence Rule 412(b).\n These arguments are both based on the Rules of Evidence.\n Reyna's reference to \"credibility\" could be a reference to either the\n Rules of Evidence or the Confrontation Clause.\n\n       Reyna told the trial judge that the purpose of admitt¡ng the\n evidence was to attack the victim's credibility, but he did not provide\nthe basis for admitting the evidence. He could have been relying on\nthe Rules of Evidence or the Confrontation Clause. lt was up to the\njudge to discern some basis for admitting the evidence.\n\n       We have said that \"(t)he purpose of requiring (an) objection is\nto give  to the trial court or the opposing party the opportunity to\ncorrect the error or remove the basis for the objection.\" When a\ndefendani's objection encompasses complaints under both the\nTexas Rules of Ëvidence and the Confrontation Clause, the\nobjection is not sufficiently specific to preserve error. An objection\non hearsay does not preserve error on Confrontation Clause\ngrounds.\n\n      Although this case involves a proffer of evidence rather than\nan objection, the same rationale applies. Reyna did not argue that\nthe Confrontation Clause demanded admission of the evidence.\nReyna's arguments for admitting the evidence could refer to either\nthe Rules of Evidence or the Confrontation Clause. His arguments\nabout hearsay did not put the trial judge on notice that he was\nmaking a Confrontation Clause argument. Because Reyna \"did not\nclearly articulate\" that the Confrontation Clause demanded\nadmission of the evidence, the trial judge \"never had the opportunity\n\f        to rule upon\" this rationale. As the losing party, Reyna must \"suffer\n        on appeal the consequences of his insufficiently specific offer,\"\n        Reyna did not do \"everything necessary to bring to the judge's\n        attention the evidence rule or statute in question and its precise and\n        proper application to the evidence in question.\n\n        ln the case now before this court, Appellant offered the evidence on the\n\n vague basis of \"possible\" opinion iestimony. He did noi sustain his burden of\n\n explaining to the trial court on the record, and by extension to us, why Redmon's\n\n and Brown's testimony was admissibf e-whether under an evidentiary rule or\n\n statute, as an exception to an evidentiary rule or statute, or under a constitutional\n\n provision. We therefore overrule Appellant's fourth and fifth issues.\n\n Conclusion\n\n        Having overruled Appellant's five issues on appeal, we affirm the trial\n\ncourt's judgments.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     isl Lee Ann Dauphinot\n                                                     LEE ANN DAUPHINOT\n                                                     JUSTICE\n\nPANEL: DAUPHINOT, GARDNER, and WALKER, JJ.\n\nPUBLISH\n\nDELIVERED: August 6, 2015\n\n\n\n       31Reyna   v.

Appellanf requests oral argument.\n\n\n                                STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n          Appellant pled not guilty to all counts of an eighteen count indictment, alleging\n\n sexual assault and aggravated sexual assault, on various dates against the same\n\n complainant.r Prior to jury selection, the State waived nine of the eighteen counts.\n\n The remaining nine counts consisted ofthlee counts ofsexual assault and six counts\n\n of aggravated sexual assault. The six aggravated counts alleged six discrete sexual\n\nassaults purpolting to have occurred on various dates from August 2012 through\n\nNovernber 2012. The agglavating eìernent of each of the six discrete aggravated\n\ncounts is alleged in identical statutory language, threatening to cause imrninent \"death\n\nor serious bodily\".\n\n         The three discrete non-aggravated counts are alleged to have each occurred in\n\nthe   niddle of tl.ris tirne period, in October 2012.\n\n        On Octobe¡ 24,2013, the jury convicted Appellant on all nine discr.ete counts\n\n\n\n   rThis was, in\n                 fact, a reindictment. l'he original indictruent was fil'teen counts and contained no\n\"aggravating\" language. Iloth indictments contained one counl ofindecency with a child which\nwas waived by the state (Clerk's Tr. at pp. 6-9 &. 12-14).\n\f On October' 25,2013, the tlial couú sentenced Appellant to six lìfìy-year sentences,\n\n on the aggravated counts, and three twenty-year sentences on the non-aggravated\n\n counts.   All   sentences to lun concul.rently. Appellant tirnely appealed.\n\n                      STATEMENT OF PROCEDURAL IIISTORY\n\n       ln an opinion, designated forpublication, handed down on April 30, 2015, the\n\nFort vy'orth court of Appeals affirmed Appellant's convictions on all nine counts.\n\nSmallwood, Jr. y. State,20l5 Tex.App.LEXIS 4457 (Tex.App.ìior1 Worlh April 30,\n\n2015). Appellanl liled       a   timely Motion for Rehearing.   Or.r   August 6,2015,the Court\n\nof Appeals withdlew its original opinion and issued a new published opinion, again\n\naffilrring all nine of Appellant's convictions. Smallwood, Jr. v. State, 2015\n\nTex.App.LEXIS        825 3   (Tex.App.Fort'ùy'oúh August 6, 20 1 5).\n\n      Appellant's tirnely Motion for.Rehearing on the Court's second published\n\nopinion was denied on August 28,2015. This petition was then timely filed with the\n\nClerk of the Court of Criminal Appeals, to wit on September 28,Z0lS.\n\n                                   GROUND FOR REVIE\\il\n\nGROUND FOR REVIEW\n\n     THE COURT OF APPEALS REVERSIBLY ERRED IN I]OLDING\n     THAT THE EVIDENCE WAS LEGALLY SUFF'ICIENT TO\n     SUPPOIìT.'I.HIT ALLEGËD AGGIIAVATING ELEMENT IN EACIT\n     OF THE SIX DISCRETE AGGRAVATED SEXUAL ASSAULT\n     COUNTS.\n\f REASONS F'OIì GRAN'I'ING IìEVIEW\n\n       In holding that the evidence was legally sufficient to suppod the alleged\n\n aggravating elernent in each of the six disclete aggravated sexual assault counts, the\n\n court of Appeals decided on irnpoftant question of state law in a way that conflicts\n\n with the applicable decisions ofthe courl of criminal Appeals and the Suplerne court\n\n of the United States as well as the Texas and the United States Constitution.\n\n            ARGUMENT SUPPORTING GTTOUND FOR IìEVIEW\n\n\n       Appellant was indicted on six discr.ete counts of aggravated sexual assault\n\nalleged to have been committed against the same fifleen year old complainant\n\n(Appellant's step-daughter). The indictment alleged specific \"on or about\" dates for\n\neach of the six disclete counts. The lÌrst date alleged was in August 2012 andfhelast\n\nwas in November 2012. The indictment also alleged three discrete unaggravated\n\nsexual assault counts, against the same complainant, which were alleged to have\n\noccurred in the middle of this time period, in October 2012.\n\n      The six discrete aggravated counts each contained identical aggravating\n\nlanguage, which read as follows:\n\n      And the defendant by acts ol'words placed Alicia Carpenter in fear.that\n      death or selious bodily injury would be imminently inflicted or.r Alioia\n      Carpentel or Krista Carpenter.\n\f (Clerk's'l'r. at pp. 6-B).\n\n        l'-irst, the State's evidence was legally insuffìcient to connect any of the\n\n purported thleats attributed to Appellant to any         of the six discrete counts of\n aggravated sexual assault alleged in the indictr¡ent. \"fhe court ofAppeals erroneously\n\n analyzed,this evidentiary deficiency in its legal sufficiency analysis on rehealing by\n\n stating:\n\n        'I\"he unique facts\n                         of this case lequile us to look at the threats as\n       continuing duling the comtnission of the assaults ovel. an extended\n       period of time.\n\n Slip Op. on Rehearing Below at I 1.\n\n       The Couft below, therefore, erloneously deemed it unnecessary to analyze fhe\n\nsix aggravated counts as six disclete crirnes in which each element, including the\n\naggravating element, must be pl'oven beyond a reasonable doubt, which the State\n\nclearly failed to do. Rather, in order to find the evidence legally sufficient, the Court\n\nbelow elroneously analyzed the evidence    as   ifthe indictment alleged a single criminal\n\nepisode, that continued \"over an extended period of tirne,\" rather than six separate,\n\ndiscrete crirnes, each one of which has essential statutoly elements, each element      of\nwhich must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The lower court's analysis, in\n\nessence, deletes the te¡m \"imrninently   inllicted\" f¡oln the indictrnent and thc statute\n\nby detennining that those words have no significance. The lower court's analysis also,\n\f in el.ítct, adds the term \"satne crirnir.ral episode\" where the legislature dicl not itrclucle\n\n ir.\n\n        The legal sufficiency standard of.eview is highly defelencial and is viewed in\n\n the light most favorable to the State. Jackson v. Virginia,443 U.S. 307 (lg7g).\n\n l{owever, the State's evidence, in order to be legally sufficient, must not only rneet\n\n the lelevant statute,   it   rnust be assigned to the specific allegations made in the\n\n indictrnent. lf the indictmenl alleges multiple discrete offenses, the evidence must be\n\n assigned   to specific discrete counts, not simply to the \"criminal episode.,, The\n\n unanirnity cases make        it   clear that he proof   of the   elernents   in a multi-count\nindictment must be proven as to each individual discrete count. \"An unanimousjury\n\nverdict ensures that the jury agrees on factual elements underlying an offense-it is\n\nnrore than lnere agreement on a violation of a statute.\" Francis v. State,36 S.W.3d\n\n121, 125 (Tex.Crirn.App. 2000). See. also, Ansari v. State,20l5 Tex.App. LEXIS\n\n8192 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 2015):\n\n       In Texas, the jury must \"reach a unanilnous verdict about the specific\n       crime that the defendant comrnitted.\" Casio,353 S.W.3d at 771. This\n       rneans \"the jury must agree upou a single and discrete incident that\n       would constitute the commission of the offense alleged.\"\n\nAnsari, supra. at 8792.\n\n       The State's evidence is legally insufficient if they do not prove every element\n\f ol'each cliscretc count, or ifthey p¡rove an offense different than the otie alleged in the\n\n indictrnent, even ifthe oflense proven violates the sarxe statutoly plovision. Gollihar\n\n v. State,46 S.W.3d 243 (Tex.Cr.im.App. 2001).\n\n       Although each ofthe nine counts in the case-at-bar. alleges a padicular \"on or\n\n about\" date, it is clear frorn the State's evidence presented af trial, that the various\n\n dates alleged    in the indictrnent were chosen randomly and arbitrarily. V/ith        the\n\nexception of counts     I   and 2, the complainant's testimony describing the events is\n\nextlemely sketchy and does not colrespond to any specifìc dates alleged. The State\n\ndoes not have to prove the exact date an offense occurred, but in this case, the State's\n\nevidence ofthe alleged aggravating element's in each of the six disclete aggravated\n\ncounts, does not correspond to any of the particular, discrete aggravated counts\n\nalleged in the indictment. Therefole, the State, among other things, did not prove the\n\naggravating element in any of the discrete agglavated counts alleged, and the courl\n\nbelow used the wtong analysis, by failing to tleat the counts as disc¡ete counts. The\n\npurported threat that elevated each ofthe six aggravated counts had to be proven as\n\nto each discrete count, not, as stated by the coult ofappeals \"as continuing during the\n\ncornmission of the assaults over ân extended peliod of time.\"\n\n      Tl.re State's key witness was    their alleged cornplainant. ln lier testimony, she\n\ndescribed   in   some detail the   first time she agleed to have sex with Appellant.\n\f Although it is not clear, it is assun-red tl.rat the State intended the jury to infer that this\n\n description applied to count(s) 1 and/or 2 of the indictment which wele alleged to\n\n have occurred \"on or about\" August I0, 2012, the earliest date alleged in the\n\n indictrnent. Accolding to the complainant, and viewing the evidence most favorably\n\n to the State, these two disclete offenses (vaginal and oral assaults) took place at\n\n Appellant's house in Grand Prairie, while complainant's twin brothers were asleep\n\n in anothelroom. (R.Vol. 5 at 137).\n\n       The complainant described counts          I   andlor 2 as follows:\n\n        IPROSECUTOR]:Do you rernember the first night that sornething\n\n                             happened with the defendant?\n\n              A.     Yes. He said that      _        to go there and just srnoke\n\n                     weed with hirn. And then we did . .        .\n\n\n\n\n(R.Vol.5 at 136).\n\n       The cornplainant went     <ln   to describe the sex act itself. (R.Vol. 5 af l3B-142).\n\n       The complainant said nothing about a threat ofdeath or serous bodily injury\n\nrnade during these two discrete offenses (presumably, aggravated counts one and two\n\nofthe indictment), that would have elevated these two purporfed acts from two sexual\n\nassaults, to two aggravated sexual assaults. The cornplainant also did not testify that\n\nshe was in fear of death ot'serious     bodily injury during this \"fitst night\". Clear.ly, the\n\fState did not prove the alleged aggravating element   ofcounts I or 2.\n      'lìre prosecutor then had the cornplainant summarily describe, in very cursory\n\nfashion, the other tirnes it happened, plesurnably in an effol-t to prove each of the\n\nrernaining seven disclete counts ofthe indictrnent (3-9).\n\n      IPROSECUTOR]: Is this sornething that happened more than once?\n\n      A.    Yes.\n\n      a.    How many times do you think that it happened?\n\n      A.    Like eight to 11 times. Maybe rnore.\n\n\n\n\n     a      For example, in August, do you believe it happened once or how\n            many times in August?\n\n     A.     Probably twice.\n\n     a.     Did it happen in Septernber?\n\n     A.     (Moving head up and down).\n\n\n\n\n     a.    And do you know how many times that would have been?\n\n     A.    At least once a week.\n\n\n\n     a     So that would have been at least four times?\n\f        A.     Yes, rna'arn.\n\n       a       Did this happerr in October'?\n\n       A.      Yes.\n\n       a       And how rnany times in October'?\n\n       A.      Like six times.\n\n       a      And did this happen in November?\n\n       A.     Like once or twice.\n\n       a.     And is that when it ended?\n\n       A.     Yes.\n\n(R.Vol. 5 at 144-145).\n\n       After this brief surnmary of what one can only assume was supposed to be a\n\ncul'sory account of the lemaining seven, alleged discrete counts, the complainant\n\ntestified that she received   a   call flom Appellant saying that they clid not have to do it\n\nanymore. (R.Vol. 5 at 163).\n\n      IPROSECUTOR]: And that was the last time anything happened like\n      that?\n\n      A.      Yes, Ma'am.\n\n      a.      Let me ask you this. Did the defendant ever say anything about what\n              rnight happen if you did tell?\n\n      A.      That I shouldn't tell, nobody would believe me. He would take my\n\f      br'others away.\n\n\n\n       And then he told me a story about a gill who was babysitting this\nguy's kids, and he ended up raping her. And then she went to couft, and\nthen he pretended to be somebody that he wasn't and hit her up on\nFacebook and that they met up thinking it was somebody else, and he\nkilled her'.\n\na     And when you're saying he?\n\nA.

Vol. 5 at 163-167).\n\n\n\n         At this point, the complainant has testified, at best, that sometimes there was\n\na   thleat during the sexual assault, but usually thel.e was not. There is no way to assign\n\nthat threat or those threats to any discrete count in the indictment. The exact nature\n\nof the threat or threats is vague and which counts, if any, the alleged \"threat,\n\npurportedly applied to is impossible to tell. No reasonable juror could have found,\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, that a particular threat was made as a part of any alleged\n\n\n\n                                             t4\n\f discrete count.\n\n         Appellant was indicted in each discr.ete aggravatecl count pursuant to T.p.C.\n\n $22.021(a)(2)(Axii), which agg'avates what is otherwise an unaggravated sexual\n\nassault ofa child (i.e., under seventeen) ifthe defendant by acts or words threatens the\n\nvictim, or any pel'son, with imminent death or serious bodily injury. uniike other\n\nsubsections of the same statute, the specific thleat, whether by acts or by words, must\n\nbe a palt of the alleged sexual assault itself. By              contr.ast, see 'I.p.C.\n\n$22.021(a)(2)(Axii), which agglavates an otherwise unaggravated sexual assault,       if\nthe perpetlator causes serious bodily injury ol'attempts to câuse death, \"in the course\n\nof the   sarne oliminal episode.\" Also, contr.ast T.P.C.

I guess not.\n\n\n\n         a     Concerning threats from Jeff, did you tell us ea¡lier today that the\n               threat was not out of his mouth but rather his actions?\n\n         A.    He didn't, like, threaten me and say, oh, you're going to die ii;\n               you know, you tell. It wasn't like that.

The trial court sentenced him accordingly, ordering the\n\f  sentences to be served concurrently. Appellant brings five issues on appeal,\n\n  challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to show the aggravating element for\n\n  the síx convictions of aggravated sexual assault of a child (counts one through\n\n four, eight, and nine) and contending that the state misrepresented the law during\n\n voir dire and that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding evidence of ihe\n\n complainant's prior rape accusation against a neighbor and the testimony of two\n\n other witnesses. Because the evidence ís sufficient to support the jury's verdict\n\n and because the trial court committed no reversible error, we affirm the trial\n\n court's judgments.\n\n Brief Facts\n\n       Appellant and Complaínant's mother (Mother) had been a couple, had\n\n shared a home with complainant and her brother, and were the parents of twin\n\n boys, Complainant's younger half-brothers. Appellant and Mother parted ways\n\n and went through a custody battle over the twins. On July, 4,2012, Complainant,\n\nwho was fourteen years old at the time, was at Appellant's home with her twin\n\nbrothers. complainant and Mother were not getting along around this             time.\n\nAppellant told complainant that he wanted to put Mother in a hole and hire some\n\nMexican assassins to hurt   her. ln the same conversation, Appellant suggested\nthat Complainant have sex with him to make Mother mad, but Complainant\n\nrefused his offer.\n\n      Later that same month, Complainant, along with her twin brothers, visited\n\nAppellant's parents in El Paso. During this trip, Complainant received messages\n\f from someone who identified himself as \"Jayylo\" thiough Kik, an application on\n\n her cell phone. Jayylo sent pictures of his penis to   her. She     responded by\n \"sen[ding] inappropriate pictures of [her] boobs.\" She never gave Jayylo her\n\n home address or her real name. Jayylo continued to send more pictures of\n\n himself to her. When Complainant threatened to stop sending Jayylo pictures, he\n\n threatened   to send the photos she had sent him to her school and to        the\n\n mailboxes    of   Mother and her neighbors. Complainant noticed that the\n background of one of the photos he sent her resembled a portion of Appellant,s\n\n house. Complainant was then suspicious that Appellant was Jayylo.\n\n        She confronted Appellant, but he denied having a Kik account. About an\n\n hour later, Appellant called Complainant back and asked her why he had pictures\n\nof her boobs in his mailbox. Complainant started crying and told him what had\n\nhappened with Jayylo and that he had threatened     her.   Complainant also told\n\nAppellant's mother why she was crying, and Appellant got mad at Complainant\n\nfor telling his mother. complainant turned fifteen years old while she was in El\n\nPaso.\n\n        When Complainant returned home from El Paso, she began receiving text\n\nmessages from Jayylo sent directly   to her cell phone number.       Complainant\n\nnoticed that the first six digits of Jayyfo's phone number were the same as\n\nAppellant's cell phone number. Jayylo told her that he got her phone number\n\nfrom one of her friends, which Complainant knew not to be true. Whenever\n\nComplainant asked Jayylo who he really was, he would change his story of how\n\f Complainant was supposed        to know him and how old he was. Jayylo texted\n Complainant almost every day at different times of the day. But she could never\n\n get a response when she called him.\n\n       Jayylo continued threatening Complainant and demanded that she send\n\n him more photos, have sex with Appellant, videotape it, and send the video to\n\n Jayylo. Complainant refused. Jayylo put one of the photos Complainant had sent\n\n him on a Facebook page he had created and ihreatened to add all of her friends\n\n to that page. Appellant told Complainant that Jayylo was also contacting him, but\n\n she never saw any of the messages that Appellant claimed to have received.\n\n       Appellant and Complainant spoke about the situation and decided to\n\nacquiesce   to   Jayylo's demands. Complainant and Appellant had sexual\n\nintercourse in Appellant's house while Complainant's twin brothers were asleep.\n\nFollowing Jayylo's demands, Appellant and Complainant continued their sexual\n\nrelationship. They had sexual intercourse \"eight to eleven times[,] [m]aybe more,',\n\nfrom August 2012 to November 2012. These sexual encounters would occur at\n\neither Appellant's or Complainant's home.\n\n      Complainant testified that she texted Jayylo that it was getting harder for\n\nher to keep these incidents a secret, and shortly after she sent this text, Appellant\n\ncalled her and told her that they did not \"have to do it anymore.\" Appellant then\n\ntofd Complainant a story about\n\n      a girl who was babysitting this guy's kids, and he ended up raping\n      her. And then she went to court, and then he pretended to be\n\f       somebody that he wasn't and hit her up on Facebook and thal they\n       met up thinking it was somebody else, and he killed her.\n\n This story scared Complainant. At trial, she testified that Appellant knew people\n\n from Mexico who were in the Mexican Mafia. Although complainant testified that\n\n Appellant never specifically threatened her, she also testified ihat he made it\n\n clear that if he could hurt Mother, he could hurt Complainant   too. ln December\n 2012, Complainant made an outcry to Mother's friend. Shorily afterward, the\n\n decision to call the police was made. Appellant pled not guilty to all counts of an\n\neighteen-count indictment alleging that he had committed sexual assault and\n\naggravated sexual assault on various dates against Complainant.\n\n       Outside the presence of the jury, in an in-camera hearing, Appellant\n\npresented evidence from Ricky    May. May lived in Complainant's neighborhood\naround 2008 to    2009. He testified that when he was         eighteen years old,\nComplainant would contact him \"through phone [and] text messaging, trying to get\n\n[him] to have sexual intercourse with her\" because she was \"horny.\" May refused\n\nComplainant's offer, but he heard that Complainant had iold people in their\n\nneighborhood that he had raped her, which he denied. May was never charged\n\nwith or arrested for rape. The State objected to May's testimony on hearsay\n\ngrounds.\n\n      THE   COURT:       Response?\n\n      IPROSËCUTOR]: Once agaín, Your Honor, this is an opinion based\n                    upon hearsay. There's no proof that she ever\n                    said these things. And this is the type of\n                    reputation and opínion evidence that is, I believe,\n\f                                proh¡bited under 412 as is relating to sexual\n                                conduct and it's not fitting in one of the categories\n                                that aflows for past behavior to be admissible.\n\n The trial court sustained the State's objection, and May was not permitted to\n\ntestify in front of the jury.\n\n       Appellant also offered testimony from Jeannie Redmon outside the\n\npresence of the     jury.   Redmon testifíed that she had known Complainant for\n\n\"[a]pproximately seven to eight years.\" Redmon testified that Complainant was\n\n\"untruthful\" because (1) she took items that belonged to Redmon's daughter; told\n\nRedmon that Redmon's daughter had given her the items when in fact, Redmon's\n\ndaughter had not; (2) and instructed Redmon's daughter               to similarly lie;   she\n\nwould tell Redmon and her daughter that she was dating people whom she was\n\nnot dating, (3) she had said that a boy across the street had raped her; and (4)\n\nshe lied about giving out her phone number to boys at a waterpark when Redmon\n\nasked her if she had done           so.   Redmon afso testified that she thought her\n\ndaughter and Complainant had gone to pornographic websites on Redmon's\n\nhome computer. Appellant offered Redmon's testimony as her opinion on\n\nComplainant's truthfulness. The State objected to Redmon's testimony:\n\n     We'll object under rule 608 and 609, also 404. I thínk if this witness\n     knew [Complainant] presently, we would be legally okay with her\n     opinion that she's untruthful, but I think four years ago is a little bit too\n     remote. And certainly, even if that was allowed, the rules, specifically\n     608(b)l,l disallow specific instances of conduct. So we would object\n     to any specific instances.\n\n           Additionally, it sounds like almost all of this is hearsay and,\n     except for perhaps the opinion as to truthfulness. But the porn use, I\n\f       don't think we can say that this witness knows with her own personal\n       knowledge that it was definitely [Complainant]. I think perhaps she's\n       basing that off of what her daughter has told her. And the same with\n       the false claim of rape, she's admitted on cross she really does not\n       know what happened.\n\n The trial court sustained the State's objections, and Redmon was not permitted to\n\ntestify in front of the jury.\n\n       Appellant also presented evidence from Denise Brown outside the\n\npresence of the     jury.       Brown tesiified that Complainant was friends with her\n\ndaughter and that she knew Complainant in 2009 and 2010. Brown testified that\n\nComplainant was untruthfuf because Complainant ('l) spread rumors that Brown's\n\ndaughter was pregnant and (2) took some fingernail polish belonging to Brown's\n\ndaughter without permission. Brown also testified that Complainant was\n\nflirtatious   with boys and opined that             Complainant   was   promiscuous.\n\nComplainant's friendship with Brown's daughter ended when Brown's daughter\n\nbegan dating a boy whom Complainant had previously dated, and Complainant\n\nbegan calling Brown's daughter            a \"slut.\" The State objected to    Brown's\n\ntestimony:\n\n      The State would objeci as to . . . this witness . . . having no personal\n      knowledge of the things that she has referenced as far as her basis\n      for determining this-[Complainant's] credibility. She's basing it upon\n      hearsay. So we would object under 608.\n\n              Also, as far as going into specific instances of conduct, she\n      doesn't-she did not personally observe them or have personal\n      knowledge as to them,\n\n              Also, we'd object under 404, 403 as             to her general\n     characterization of [Complainant's being] boy crazy, promiscuous.\n\f             [S]he has clearly demonstrated her own bias towards\n        fComplainant] where she does not apply the standard to her own\n        daughter as she does for [Complainant], even though they're\n        engaged in the same conduct.\n\n The trial court sustained the State's rule 608 objection.\n\n Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n       ln his first issue, Appellant argues that the evidence is insufficient      to\n\n support the jury's determination that, during the alleged aggravated sexual\n\n assaults, he, \"by acts or words placed [Complainant] in fear that death or serious\n\n bodily injury woufd be imminently inflicted on [her] or [her mother],\" as alleged in\n\ncounts one through four, eight, and nine.\n\n       ln our due-process review of the sufficiency of the evidence to support a\n\nconviction, we view all the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict to\n\ndetermine whether any rational trier      of fact could have found the     essential\n\nelements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.l This standard gives full play\n\nto the responsibility of the trier of fact to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to\n\nweigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to\n\nultimate facts.2\n\n\n\n\n     lJackson v.

Judge Cochran has explaíned,\n\n              Trials involving sexual assault may raise particular evidentiary\n       and constitutional concerns because the credibility of both the\n       complainant and defendant is a central, often dispositive, issue.\n       Sexual assault cases are frequently \"he said, she said\" trials in\n       which the jury must reach a unanimous verdict based solely upon\n       iwo diametrically different versions of an event, unaided by any\n        physical, scientific, or other corroborative evidence. Thus, the Rules\n       of  Evidence, especially Rule 403, should be used sparingly to\n       exclude relevant, otherwise admissible evidence that might bear\n       upon the credibility of either the defendant or complainant in such\n       \"he said, she said\" cases. And Ïexas law, as well as the federal\n       constitution, requires great latitude when the evidence deals with a\n       witness's specific bias, motive, or interest to testify in a particular\n       fashion.\n\n              But, as the Supreme Court noted in Davis v. Alaska, there is\n      an important distinction between an attack on the general credibility\n      of a witness and a more particular attack on credibility that reveals\n      \"possible biases, prejudices, or ulterior motives of the witness as\n      they may relate directly to issues or personalities in the case at\n      hand,\" Thus, under Dayrs, \"the exposure of a witness' motivation in\n      testifying is a proper and important function of the constitutionally\n      protected right of cross-examination.\" However, as Justice Stewart\n      noted in concurrence, the Court neither held nor suggested that the\n      Constitution confers a right to impeach the general credibility of a\n      witness through otherwise prohibited modes of cross-examination.\n      Thus, the Dayrs Court did not hold that a defendant has an absolute\n      constitutionaf right to impeach the general credibility of a witness in\n      any fashion that he chooses. But the constitution is offended if the\n      state evidentiary rule would prohibit him from cross-examining a\n      witness concerning possible motives, bias, and prejudice to such an\n      extent that he could not present a vital defensive theory.18\n\n\n\n\n      lsHammer     v.

Evid. 701.\n\fdoes not allow a defendant in a sexual assault case to impeach the complainant\n\nwith evidence of prior false accusations:\n\n             The theory for admitting prior false accusations of rape in a\n      sex-offense prosecution is frequently analogized to Aesop's story of\n      \"The Boy Who Cried Wolf.\" A past false accusation makes it more\n      likely that the witness lacks credibility and thus should not be\n      believed concerning this accusatíon. But in Aesop's fable, there\n      really was a wolf, and it killed the sheep. The moral of that story was\n      \"Nobody believes a liar . . even when he is telling the truth.\" A\n      criminal trial, however, is designed to find the truth about a specific\n      incident, not to decide whether someone has lied in the past about\n      the presence of wolves or about being raped. Prior false allegations\n      of rape do not tend to prove or disprove any of the elements of the\n      charged sexual offense.\n\n           Therefore, Texas, unlike some jurisdictions, has not created a\n     per se exception to Rule 608(b)'s general prohibition against\n     impeachment with specific instances of conduct to admit evidence of\n     the complainant's pr¡or false allegations of abuse or molestation.\n     The inferential chain of logic that is barred by Rule 608(b) is this:\n\n             The witness lied to his employer (or did some specific act of\n             dishonesty)\n\n             That specific conduct proves dishonest character;\n\n             Therefore, the witness is generally dishonest and should not\n             be believed in this case.\n\n     Applied to prior false accusations, the barred evidentiary chain is\n     this:\n\n             Complainant made a prior false accusation;\n\n             That specific conduct proves dishonest character;\n\n             Therefore, the complainant is generally dishonest and should\n             not be believed in this case.\n\n          This is precisely the prohibited propensity chain of logic-\n     \"Once a thief, always a thief,\" \"Once a liar, always a liar\"-that\n     underlies both Rules 404(b) and 608(b). A sexual assault\n\n\n                                       15\n\f compla¡nant is not a volunteer for an exercise in character\n assassination. Several federal courts have held that exclusion of\n this evidence, offered to attack the victim's general credibility, does\n not violate the Confrontation Clause.\n\n          lf, however, the cross-examiner offers evidence of a prior false\naccusation of sexual activity for some purpose other than a\npropensity atiack upon the witness's general character for\ntruthfulness, it may well be admissible under our state evidentiary\n rules.\n\n       For example, in Billodeau y. Sfafe, we held that the trial court\n should have admitted evidence that the child complainant in that\naggravated sexual assault prosecution had made threats to falsely\naccuse two neighbors of sexual molestation. We held that such\nevidence supported the defensive theory that the complainant's\nmotive in accusing the defendant of sexual molestation was \"rage\nand anger\" when he was thwarted. Evidence of threats to accuse\nothers of sexual molestation when he displayed \"rage and anger\" at\nbeing thwarted is some evidence of a common motive for accusing\nthe defendant of sexual molestation. The chain of logic is as follows:\n\n      The victim makes false accusations in certain circumstances\nand for certain reasons;\n\n          Those circumstances and reasons are present in this case;\n\n          Therefore, the victim made a false accusation in this case.\n\n          One might even call this modus operand¡ ev¡dence admissible\nunder Rule 404(b). Evidence of other acts or wrongs may be\nadmissible under Rule 404(b) to prove such matters as motive,\nintent, scheme, or any other relevant purpose except conduct in\nconformity with bad character. Even \"the doctrine of chances\" has\nbeen invoked as a possible basis for admitting evidence of a victim's\nprior false accusation of rape. Similarly, evidence of a victim's prior\nsexual activity may be admissible under Rule 412, lhe Texas Rape\nShield Law, when offered to establish the victim's motive or bias\nagainst the defendant.\n\n       ln sum, several different state evidentiary rules permit the use\nof prior false accusations when offered to show the witness's bias or\nmotive or for some other relevant, noncharacter purpose. The\nConfrontation Clause mandate of Davrs v. Alaska is not inconsistent\n\n\n                                     16\n\f       with Texas evidence law. Thus, compliance with a rule of evidence\n       will, in most instances, avoid a constitutional question concerning ihe\n       admissibility of such evidence.25\n\n We now examine the case at bar.\n\n       Prior Rape\n\n       Appeflant argues that the trial courl abused its discretion by excluding\n\n May's testimony that he had heard a rumor that Complainant was telling people\n\nthat he had sexually assaulted her and Redmon's testimony pertaining to the\n\nalleged incident. Appellant offered May's testimony under rule of evidence\n\n 404(b).26 While Appellant now argues that the trial court's ruling abridged certain\n\nof his constitutional rights, at trial he spoke only of credibility and Rule 404(b).\n\nAppellant's complaints at trial do not conform to his constitutional complaints on\n\nappeal; we therefore do not address his constitutional complaints.2T\n\n      Additionally, May's testimony dealt with rumors on the street; it did not\n\nconstitute testimony of Complainant's reputation for truthfulness, nor were his\n\nclaims that he had heard that she was spreading rumors                 in any    way\n\nsubstantiated to provide a basis for an opinion that she was not worthy of belief\n\nunder oath.

His belief that she had accused him was\nbased on rumors that he had heard. The record does not establish confirmation\n\nof May's belief that she falsely accused him of rape. Nor do the rumors he heard\n\nsuggest a motive for falsely accusing Appellant or a modus operandi. May said\n\nthat Complainant would ask him to have sex with her, and he refused. But we\n\ncannot discern how the rumors he heard thai she was accusing him of rape were\n\never verified. The record before this court therefore does not establish the\n\nadmissibilíty of this evidence of purported false accusations of rape under rule\n\n404(b).\n\n         At trial, Appellant explained in seeking admission of the false accusation\n\ntestimony, \"the false claim    of rape is going to credibility.\" We hold that the\nrumors of false rape accusations were not admissible, and based on the record\n\nbefore us, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellant's\n\nrequest to present this evidence before the    jury. We overrule Appellant's   third\n\nissue.\n\n\n\n\n         28See\n                 Hammer, 296 S.W.3d at 564.\n\n\n\n                                         1B\n\f Redmon's and Brown's Opinion Testimony\n\n       ln his fourth and fifth issues, Appellant complains of the exclusion of the\n\n testimony of Redmon and Brown concerning their opinions of Complainant's\n\n credibility. As we understand the record, Appellant appears to have offered\n\n these opinions by having the women explain specific acts that they suspected\n\n had occurred and speculate on others. He did not offer their testimony on any\n\nconstitutional basis, We therefore do noi address the constitutional arguments\n\nhe raises on appeal.2e\n\n       Redmon's testimony was based on her belief that Complainant had lied\n\nand had told Redmon's daughter to lie about having given Complainant things\n\nthat Complainant had stolen from Redmon's daughter. Redmon also believed\n\nthat Complainant had lied to her and to her daughter about dating, smoking\n\nmarijuana, and being raped. Appellant explained to the trial court that he was\n\noffering Redmon's testimony as \"possible opinion testimony on truthfulness.\"\n\n      Brown believed that Complainant had spread untruthful rumors about her\n\ndaughter and that she had stolen her daughter's nail polish. We are not clear on\n\nthe legal basis for which Appellant offered this evidence, other than as an opinion\n\nof Complainant's truthfulness. Judge Keasler has explained for the Texas Court\n\nof Criminal Appeals,\n\n\n\n      2esee\n              Tex. R. App P. 33.1(a)(1); Lovítt,319 S.W.3d at691-92\n\f [A] less common notion of error preservation comes into play in this\n case, although certainly not a novel one. Professors Goode,\n Wellborn and Sharlot refer to it as \"party responsibílity.      \"\n                                                               They\n explain it this way:\n\n             To the question, which pady has the responsibility\n       regarding any particular matter, it is infallibly accurate to\n       answer with another question: which pafty                  is\n       complaining now on appeal? This is because in a real\n       sense both parties are always responsible for the\n       application of any evidence rule to any evidence.\n       Whichever party complains on appeal about the trial\n       judge's action must, at the earliest opportunity, have\n       done everything necessary to bring to the judge's\n       attention the evidence rule in question and its precise\n       and proper application to the evidence in question.\n\nThe basis for party responsibility is, among other things, Appellate\nRule 33.'1 . lt provides that as a prerequisite to presenting a\ncomplaint for appellate review, the record must show that the party\n\"stated the grounds for the ruling that (he) sought from the trial court\nwith sufficient specificity to make the trial couÍ aware of the\ncomplaint.\" So it is not enough to tell the judge that evidence is\nadmissible. The proponent, if he is the losing party on appeal, must\nhave told the judge why the evidence was admissible,\n\n        We recently discussed this notion in Ma¡finez y. Sfafe. There,\n the defendant moved to suppress oral statements due to the State's\n failure to comply with Art. 20.17. -lhe State argued for the first time\n on appeal that Art. 20.17 did not apply. We concluded that the State\n forfeited this argument by failing to bring it to the trial judge's\n attention. We explained that \"both Texas Rule of Appellate\n Procedure 33.1 and Texas Rule of Evidence 103 are 'judge-\n protecting' rules of error preservation. The basic principle of both\n rules is that of 'party responsibility.\"' We recognized that \"the party\ncomplaining on appeal (whether it be the State or the defendant)\nabout a trial court's admission, exclusion, or suppression of evidence\nmust, at the earlíest opportunity, have done everything necessary to\nbring to the judge's attention the evidence rule or statute in question\nand its precise and proper application to the evidence in question.\"\nThe issue, we said, \"is not whether the appealing party is the State\nor the defendant or whether the trial court's ruling is legally 'correct'\nin every sense, but whether the complaining party on appeal brought\n\n\n                                   20\n\f to the trial court's aitention the very complaint that party is     now\n making on appeal.\"\n\n       Similarly, in Willover y. Sfafe, the defendant sought to admit\n two videotaped interviews of the victim. At trial,\n\n       it (was) clear that, although (the defendant) did not\n       aciually recite the specific rule of evidence he was\n       relying upon, (he) sought to admit the videotapes for\n       impeachment purposes. (He) did not argue, nor was\n       there any discussion at trial, that the tapes were not\n       hearsay or that the videotapes were admissible under\n       any exception to the hearsay rule other than Article\n       38.071 or for impeachment purposes.\n\n       On appeal, the defendant argued for the first time that the\nvideotapes were not hearsay. We relied on the notion of \"party\nresponsibility\" to reject this argument because \"(i)n order to have\nevidence admitted under a hearsay exception, the proponent of the\nevidence must specify which exception he is relying upon.\" lt was\nup to the defendant, we said, and ''not the trial court, to specify\nwhich exception to the hearsay rule he was relying upon or to\nspecify how the evidence was not hearsay.\"\n\n       ln some cases, we have applied the \"party responsibility\"\ntheory without using those precise words. ln Clark v. Sfafe, the\nState presented the testimony of Dr. James Grigson that the\ndefendant would be a future danger. The defendant sought at trial\nto introduce a letter and accompany¡ng report which listed eleven\nindividuals convicted of capital murder whose sentences had later\nbeen commuted or reduced. ln several of those cases, Dr. Grigson\nhad predicted that the individual would be a future danger. The trial\ncourt refused to admit the evidence.\n\n      On appeal, the defendant argued that the excluded evidence\nwas admissible to impeach Dr. Grigson and show that his prior\nfuture dangerousness predictions had turned out to be incorrect.\nBut the defendant had not articulated this basis for admission at trial.\nAt trial, he had argued the evidence was admissible to impeach\nstatements that Dr. Gr¡gson had made in Lubbock County. The\nState had objected that the impeachment went to a collateral matter,\nand the trial judge had agreed.\n\f       We rejected the defendant's argument on appeal because he\n \"did not clearly articulate\" that he wanted to admit the evidence to\n demonstrate Grigson's past mistakes in predicting future\n dangerousness. We said that the trial judge \"never had the\n opportunity to rule upon (the defendant's) appellate rationale.\" Since\n the defendant \"did not sufficiently clearly expressly offer the\n evidence for the purpose which he now claims on appeal,'' that\n argument could not be raised on appeal.\n\n       Finally, in Jones v. Sfafe, the defendant sought at trial to admit\n the grand jury testimony of a witness who asserted her Fifth\n Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and refused to\n testify. The State objected, claiming hearsay. We concluded that\n the defendant failed to preserve error because he never specified\n which portions of the witness's testimony he wanted to admit into\n evidence. We said:\n\n             The trial court need never sort through challenged\n      evidence in order to segregate the admissible from the\n      excludable, nor is the trial court required to admit only\n      the former part or exclude only the latter part. lf\n      evidence is offered and challenged which contains\n      some of each, the trial court may safely admit it all or\n      exclude it all, and the losing party, no matter who he is,\n      will be made to suffer on appeal the consequences of\n      his insufficiently specific offer or objection. ln this case,\n      because the trial court chose to exclude the evidence,\n      appellant is the party adversely affected by his own\n      default. Because appellant failed to specify which\n      portion of the transcript he intended to introduce into\n      evidence, the court was presented with a proffer\n      containing both admissible and inadmissible evidence.\n      When evidence which       is partially admissible and\n      partially inadmissible is excluded, a party may not\n      complain upon appeal unless the admissible evidence\n      was specifically offered.\n\n                              Application\n\n        ln this case, Reyna argued to the trial judge that the evidence\nshould be admitted for \"credibilíty.\" He said that he was \"not offering\nit to prove the truth of the matter asserted\" and \"not offering it to go\ninto her sexuality.\" lnstead, he argued, \"l'm offering to             it\n\n                                  22\n\f demonstrate that as to prior sexual activities, that she made\n allegations that there were prior sexual allegaiions, and recanted.\"\n\n        Reyna did not cite to any rules of evidence, cases, or\n constitutional provisions. Reyna's references to \"the truth of the\n matter asserted\" reflect that he was arg uing that the evidence was\n not hearsay under Evidence Rule 801(d). His claim that he was not\n offering it \"to go into her sexuality\" reffects his argument that the\n evidence should not be excluded under Evidence Rule 412(b).\n These arguments are both based on the Rules of Evidence.\n Reyna's reference to \"credibility\" could be a reference to either the\n Rules of Evidence or the Confrontafion Clause.\n\n       Reyna told the trial judge that the purpose of admitting the\n evidence was to attack the victim's credibility, but he did not provide\nthe basis for admitting the evidence. He could have been relying on\nthe Rules of Evidence or the Confrontation Clause. lt was up to the\njudge to discern some basis for admitting the evidence.\n\n       We have said that \"(t)he purpose of requiring (an) objection is\nto give to the trial court or the opposing party the opportunity to\ncorrect the error or remove the basis for the objection.\" When a\ndefendant's objection encompasses complaints under both the\nTexas Rules of Evidence and the Confrontation Clause, the\nobjection is not sufficiently specific to preserve error. An objection\non hearsay does not preserve error on Confrontation Clause\ngrounds.\n\n       Although this case involves a proffer of evidence rather than\n an objection, the same rationale applies. Reyna did not argue that\nthe Confrontation Clause demanded admission of the evidence.\n Reyna's arguments for admitting the evidence could refer to either\nthe Rules of Evidence or the Confrontation Clause. His arguments\nabout hearsay did not put the trial judge on notice that he was\nmaking a Confrontation Clause argument. Because Reyna \"did not\nclearly articulate\" that the Confrontation Clause demanded\nadmission of the evídence, the trial judge \"never had the opportunity\nto rule upon\" this rationale. As the losing party, Reyna must \"suffer\non appeal the consequences of his insufficiently specific offer.\"\nReyna did not do \"everything necessary to bring to the judge's\n\f         attent¡on ihe evidence rule or statute in questior and its precise and\n         proper application to the evidence in question.\n\n         ln the case now before this court, Appellant offered the evidence on the\n\n  vague basis of \"possible\" opinion testimony. He did not sustain his burden of\n\n  explaining to the trial court on the record, and by extension to us, why Redmon,s\n\n and Brown's testimony was admissible-whether under an evidentiary rule or\n\n statute, as an exception to an evidentiary rule or statute, or under a constitutional\n\n provision. We therefore overrule Appellant's fourth and fifth issues.\n\n Gonclusion\n\n        Having overruled Appellant's five issues on appeal, we affirm the trial\n\n court's judgments.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    /s/ Lee Ann Dauphinot\n                                                    LEE ANN DAUPHINOT\n                                                    JUSTICE\n\nPANEL: DAUPHINOT, GARDNER, and WALKER, JJ,\n\nGARDNER, J., and WALKER, J., concur without opinion.\n\nPUBLISH\n\nDELIVERED: April 30, 2015\n\n\n\n\n      3ÙReyna    y.

The trial court sentenced hìm accordingly, ordering the\n\n sentences to be served concurrently. Appellant brings five issues on appeal,\n\n challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to show the aggravating element for\n\n the six convictions of aggravated sexual assault of a child (counts one through\n\n four, eight, and nine) and contending that the State misrepresented the law during\n\n voir dire and that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding evidence of the\n\n complainant's prior rape accusation against a neighbor and the testimony of two\n\nother witnesses. Because the evidence is sufficient to support the jury's verdict\n\nand because the trial court committed no reversible error, we affirm the trial\n\ncourt's judgments.\n\nBrief Facts\n\n      Appellant and Complainant's mother (Mother) had been a couple, had\n\nshared a home with Complainant and her brother, and were the parents of twin\n\nboys, Complainant's younger half-brothers. Appellant and Mother parted ways\n\nand went through a custody battle over the twins. On July, 4,2012, Complainant,\n\nwho was fourteen years old at the time, was at Appellant's home with her twin\n\nbrothers. Complainant and Mother were not getting along around this             time.\n\nAppellant tofd Complainant that he wanted to put Mother in a hole and hire some\n\nMexican assassins to hu¡f   her. ln the same conversation, Appellant suggested\n\f that Complainant have sex with him to make Mother mad, but Complainant\n\n refused his offer.\n\n         Later that same month, Complainant, along with her twin brothers, visited\n\n Appellant's parents in El Paso. During this trip, Complainant received messages\n\n from someone who identified himself as \"Jayylo\" through Kik, an application on\n\n her cell phone. Jayylo sent pictures of his penis to    her. She responded    by\n\n \"sen[ding] inappropriate pictures of [her] boobs.\" She never gave Jayylo her\n\n home address or her real name. Jayylo continued to send more pictures of\n\n himself to her. When Complainant threatened io stop sending Jayylo pictures, he\n\nthreatened    to send the photos she had sent him to her school and to        the\n\nmailboxes     of   Mother and her neighbors. Complainant noticed that the\nbackground of one of the photos he sent her resembled a portion of Appellant's\n\nhouse. Complainant was then suspicious that Appellant was Jayylo.\n\n        She confronted Appellant, but he denied having a Kik account. About an\n\nhour later, Appellant called Complainant back and asked her why he had pictures\n\nof her boobs in his mailbox. Complainant started crying and told him what had\n\nhappened with Jayylo and that he had threatened      her. Complainant also told\nAppellant's mother why she was crying, and Appellant got mad at Complainant\n\nfor telling his mother. Complainant turned fifteen years old while she was in El\n\nPaso,\n\n        When Complainant returned home from El Paso, she began receiving text\n\nmessages from Jayylo sent directly    to her cell phone number.     Complaínant\n\f noticed that the first six digits of Jayylo's phone number were the same as\n\n Appellant's cell phone number. Jayylo told her that he got her phone number\n\n from one of her friends, which Complainant knew not to be true. Whenever\n\n Complainant asked Jayylo who he really was, he would change his story of how\n\n Complainant was supposed to know him and how old he            was. Jayylo        texted\n\n Complainant almost every day at different times of the day. But she could never\n\n get a response when she called him.\n\n       Jayyfo continued threatening Complainant and demanded that she send\n\n him more photos, have sex with Appellant, videotape it, and send the video to\n\nJayylo. Complainant refused. Jayylo put one of the photos Complainant had sent\n\nhim on a Facebook page he had created and threatened to add all of her friends\n\nto that page. Appellant told Complainant that Jayylo was also contacting him, but\n\nshe never saw any of the messages that Appellant claimed to have received.\n\n       Appellant and Complainant spoke about the situation and decided to\n\nacquiesce   to   Jayylo's demands. Complainant and Appellant had sexual\n\nintercourse in Appellant's house while Complainant's twin brothers were asleep.\n\nFollowing Jayylo's demands, Appellant and Complainant continued their sexual\n\nrelatíonship. They had sexual intercourse \"eight to eleven times[,] [m]aybe more,\"\n\nfrom August 2012 to November 2012. These sexual encounters would occur at\n\neither Appellant's or Complainant's home.\n\n      Complainant testified that she texted Jayylo that it was getting harder for\n\nher to keep these incidents a secret, and shortly after she sent this   tef,   Appellant\n\f called her and told her ihat they did not \"have to do it anymore.\" Appellant then\n\n told Complainant a story about\n\n       a girl who was babysitting this guy's kids, and he ended up raping\n       her. And then she went to court, and then he pretended to be\n       somebody that he wasn't and hit her up on Facebook and that they\n       met up thinkíng it was somebody else, and he killed her.\n\n This story scared Complainant. At trial, she testified that Appellant knew people\n\n from Mexico who were in the Mexican Mafia. Although complainant testified that\n\n Appellant never specifically threatened her, she also testified that he made it\n\n clear that if he could hurt Mother, he could hurt Complainant   too. ln December\n 2012, Complaínant made an outcry to Mother's friend. Shortly afterward, the\n\ndecision to call the police was made. Appellant pled not guilty to all counts of an\n\neighteen-count indictment alleging that he had committed sexual assault and\n\naggravated sexual assault on various dates against Complainant.\n\n      Outside the presence of the jury, in an in-camera hearing, Appellant\n\npresented evidence from Ricky     May. May lived in Complainant's neighborhood\naround 2008 to    2009. He testified that when he was        eighteen years old,\n\nComplainant would contact him \"through phone [and] text messaging, trying to get\n\n[him] to have sexual intercourse with her\" because she was \"horny.\" May refused\n\nComplainant's offer, but he heard that Complainant had told people in their\n\nneighborhood that he had raped her, which he denied. May was never charged\n\nwith or arrested for rape. The State objected to May's testimony on hearsay\n\ngrounds.\n\f       THE    COURT:            Response?\n\n       IPROSECUTOR]: Once again, Your Honor, this is an opinion based\n                     upon hearsay. There's no proof that she ever\n                     said these things. And this is the type of\n                     reputation and opinion evidence that is, I believe,\n                     prohibited under 412 as is relating to sexual\n                     conduct and it's not fitting in one of the categories\n                     that allows for past behavior to be admissible.\n\n The trial court sustained the State's objection, and May was not permitted to\n\ntestify in front of the jury.\n\n       Appellant also offered testimony from Jeannie Redmon outside the\n\npresence of the     jury.   Redmon testified that she had known Complainant for\n\n\"[a]pproximately seven to eight years.\" Redmon testified that Complainant was\n\n\"untruthful\" because (1) she took items that belonged to Redmon's daughter, told\n\nRedmon that Redmon's daughter had given her the items when in fact, Redmon's\n\ndaughter had not, and instructed Redmon's daughter             to similarly lie; (2)   she\n\nwould tell Redmon and her daughter that she was dating people whom she was\n\nnot dating; (3) she had said that a boy across the street had raped her; and\n\n(4) she lied about giving out her phone number           to boys at a waterpark when\nRedmon asked her if she had done            so. Redmon also testified that she thought\nher daughter and Complainant had gone to pornographic websites on Redmon's\n\nhome computer. Appellant offered Redmon's testimony as her opinion on\n\nComplainant's truthfulness. The State objected to Redmon's testimony:\n\n      We'll object under rule 608 and 609, also 404. I think if this witness\n      knew [Complainant] presently, we would be legally okay wiih her\n      opinion that she's untruthful, but I think four years ago is a little bít too\n\f        remote. And certainly, even if that was allowed, the rules, specifically\n        608(b)l,l disallow specific instances of conduct. So we would object\n        to any specific instances.\n\n              Additionally, it sounds like almost all of this is hearsay and,\n       except for perhaps the opinion as to truthfulness. But the porn use, I\n       don't think we can say that this witness knows with her own personal\n       knowledge that it was definitely [Complainant]. lthink perhaps she's\n       basing that off of what her daughier has told her. And the same with\n       the false claim of rape, she's admitted on cross she really does noi\n       know what happened.\n\n The trial court sustained the State's objections, and Redmon was not permitted to\n\ntestify in front of the jury.\n\n       Appellant also presented evidence from Denise Brown outside the\n\npresence of the     jury.       Brown testified that Complainant was friends with her\n\ndaughter and that she knew Complainant in 2009 and 2010. Brown testified that\n\nComplainant was untruthful because Complainant (1) spread rumors that Brown's\n\ndaughter was pregnant and (2) took some fingernail polish belonging to Brown,s\n\ndaughter without permission             Brown also testified that Complainant was\n\nflirtatious   with boys and opined that             Complainant   was   promiscuous.\n\nComplainant's friendship with Brown's daughter ended when Brown's daughter\n\nbegan dating a boy whom Complainant had previously dated, and Complainant\n\nbegan calling Brown's daughter            a \"slut.\" The State objected to Brown's\ntestimony:\n\n      The State would object as to. . . this witness. . . having no personal\n      knowledge of the things that she has referenced as far as her basis\n      for determining this-[Complainant's] credibility. She's basing it upon\n      hearsay. So we would object under 608.\n\f            Also, as far as going into specific instances of conduct, she\n       doesn't-she did not personally observe them or have personal\n       knowledge as io them.\n\n            Also, we'd object under 404, 403 as to her general\n       characterization of [Complainant's being] boy crazy,\n       promiscuous. . . . [S]he has clearly demonstrated her own bias\n       towards [Complainant] where she does not apply the standard to her\n       own daughter as she does for [Complainant], even though they're\n       engaged in the same conduct.\n\n The trial court sustained the State's rule 608 objection.\n\n Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n       ln his first issue, Appellant argues thai the evidence is      insufficient to\n\nsupport the jury's determination that, during the alleged aggravated sexual\n\nassaults, he, \"by acts or words placed [Complainant] in fear that death or serious\n\nbodily injury would be imminently inflicted on [her] or [her mother],\" as alleged in\n\ncounts one through four, eight, and nine.\n\n       ln our due-process review of the sufficiency of the evidence to support a\n\nconviction, we view all the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict to\n\ndetermine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential\n\nelements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.r This standard gives full play\n\nto the responsibility of the trier of fact to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to\n\n\n\n\n     lJackson v.

Judge Cochran has explained,\n\n            Trials involving sexual assault may raise particufar evidentiary\n      and constitutional concerns because the credibility of both the\n      complainant and defendant is a central, often dispositive, issue.\n      Sexual assault cases are frequently \"he said, she said\" trials in\n     which the jury must reach a unanimous verdict based solely upon\n     two diametrically different versions of an event, unaided by any\n      physical, scientific, or other corroborative evidence. Thus, the Rules\n     of Evidence, especially Rule 403, should be used sparingly to\n     exclude relevant, otherwise admissible evidence that might bear\n     upon the credibilíty of either the defendant or complainant in such\n     \"he said, she said\" cases. And Texas law, as well as the federaf\n     constitution, requires great latitude when the evidence deals with a\n     witness's specific bias, motive, or interest to testify in a pariicular\n     fashion.\n\n             But, as the Supreme Court noted in Davis v. Alaska, there is\n     an important distinction between an attack on the general credibility\n     of a witness and a more particular attack on credibility that reveals\n     \"possible biases, prejudices, or ulterior motives of the witness as\n     they may relate directly to issues or personalities in ihe case at\n     hand.\" Thus, under Dayis, \"the exposure of a witness' motivation in\n     testifying is a proper and important function of the constitutionally\n     protecied right of cross-examination.  \"However, as Justice Stewarl\n     noted in concurrence, the Court neither held nor suggested that the\n     Constitution confers a right to impeach the general credibility of a\n     witness through otherwise prohibited modes of cross-examination.\n     ïhus, the Davrs Court did not hold that a defendant has an absolute\n     constitutional right to impeach the general credibility of a witness in\n     any fashion that he chooses. But the constitution is offended if the\n     state evidentiary rule would prohibit him from cross-examining a\n\n\n\n\n                                       13\n\f       witness concerning possible motives, bias, and prejudice to such an\n       extent that he could not preseni a vital defensive theory.î8\n\n       A witness's credibility may be attacked in three ways: opinion or reputation\n\nfor general truthfulness or untruthfulness and cross-examination on         specifrc\n\ninstances of conduct that establish bias, self-interest, or mot¡ve for testifying as\n\nhe or she did.1s Opinion evidence is not the same as reputation evidence.20 As\n\nthis couri has explained,\n\n      Reputation witnesses' testimony must be based on discussion with\n      others about the subject, or on hearing others discuss the person's\n      reputation, and not just on personal knowledge. Rule 405 requires\n      only \"substantial familiarity\" with the reputation of the accused.2l\n\n      Reputation evidence, then, must necessarily be grounded in hearsay.22\n\nAn objection that the test¡mony of reputation evidence is hearsay and not based\n\non personal knowledge thus will not lie.23 Opinion testimony is governed by rule\n\nof evidence 701 and must be based on personal observation.2a\n\n\n      tuHammer       v.

Evid. 701.\n\f      Within this general framework, Judge Cochran, speaking               for   the\n\nunan¡mous Hammer court, has explained why Texas, unlike many other states,\n\ndoes not allow a defendant in a sexual assault case to impeach the complainant\n\nwiih evidence of prior false accusations:\n\n             ïhe theory for admitting prior false accusations of rape in a\n       sex-offense prosecution is frequently anafogized to Aesop's story of\n      \"The Boy Who Cried Wolf.\" A past false accusation makes it more\n      likely that the witness lacks credibility and thus should not be\n      believed concerning this accusation. But in Aesop's fable, there\n      really was a wolf, and it killed the sheep. The moral of that story was\n      \"Nobody believes a liar . . even when he is telling the truth.\" A\n      criminal trial, however, is designed to find the truth about a specific\n      incident, not to decide whether someone has lied in the past about\n      the presence of wolves or about being raped. Prior false allegations\n      of rape do not tend to prove or disprove any of the elements of the\n      charged sexual offense.\n\n           Therefore, Texas, unlike some jurisd¡ctions, has not created a\n      per se exception    to Rule 608(b)'s general prohibition against\n     impeachment with specific instances of conduct to admit evidence of\n     the complainant's prior false allegations of abuse or molestation.\n     ïhe inferential chain of logic that is barred by Rule 608(b) is this:\n             The witness lied to his employer (or did some specific act of\n             dishonesty)\n\n             That specific conduct proves dishonest character;\n\n             Therefore, the witness is generally dishonest and should not\n             be believed in this case.\n\n     Applied to prior false accusations, the barred evidentiary chain is\n     this:\n\n             Complainant made a prior false accusation;\n\n             ïhat specific conduct proves dishonest character;\n             Therefore, the complainant is generally dishonest and should\n             not be believed in this case-\n\n\n                                        15\n\f      This is precisely the prohibited propensity chain of logic-\n \"Once a thief, always a thief,\" \"Once a liar, always a liar\"-that\n underlies both Rules 404(b) and 608(b). A sexual assault\n complainani ís not a volunteer for an exercise in character\n assassination. Severaf federal courts have held that exclusion of\n this evidence, offered to attack the victim's general credibility, does\n not violate the Confrontation Clause.\n\n        lf, however, the cross-examiner offers evidence of a prior false\n accusation of sexual activity for some purpose other than a\n propensity attack upon the wiiness's general character for\n truthfulness, it may well be admissible under our state evídentiary\n rules.\n\n       For example, in Billodeau v. State, we held that the trial court\n should have admitted evidence that the child complainant in that\n aggravated sexual assault prosecution had made threats to falsely\naccuse two neighbors of sexual molestation. We held that such\nevidence supported the defensive theory that the complainant's\nmotive in accusing the defendant of sexual molestation was \"rage\nand anger\" when he was thwarted. Evidence of threats to accuse\nothers of sexual molestation when he displayed \"rage and anger\" at\nbeing thwarted is some evidence of a common motive for accusing\nthe defendant of sexual molestation. The chain of logic is as follows:\n\n          The victim makes false accusations in certain circumstances\nand for certain reasons;\n\n          Those circumstances and reasons are present in this case;\n\n          Therefore, the victim made a false accusation in this case.\n\n          One might even call this modus operandi evidence admissible\nunder Rule 404(b). Evidence of other acts or wrongs may be\nadmissible under Rule 404(b) to prove such matters as motive,\nintent, scheme, or any other relevant purpose except conduct in\nconformity with bad character. Even \"the doctrine of chances\" has\nbeen invoked as a possible basis for admitting evidence of a victim's\nprior false accusation of rape. Similarly, evidence of a victim's prior\nsexual activity may be admissible under Rule 412, fhe Texas Rape\nShield Law, when offered to establish the victim's motive or bias\nagainst the defendant.\n\n\n\n\n                                     16\n\f                ln sum, several different state ev¡dentiary rufes permit the use\n       of prior   false accusations when offered to show the witness's bias or\n       motive or for some other relevant, noncharacter purpose. The\n       Confrontation Clause mandate of Dayrs v. Alaska is not inconsistent\n       with Texas evidence law. Thus, compliance with a rule of evidence\n       will, in most instances, avoid a constitutional question concerning the\n       admissibility of such evidence.25\n\n We now examine the case at bar.\n\n      Prior Rape\n\n      Appellant argues that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding\n\nMay's testimony that he had heard a rumor that Complainant was telling people\n\nthat he had sexually assaulted her and Redmon's testimony pertaining to the\n\nafleged incident. Appellant offered May's testimony under rule of evidence\n\n404(b).26 While Appellant now argues that the trial court's ruling abridged cefain\n\nof his constitutional rights, at trial he spoke only of credibility and Rule 4O4(b).\n\nAppellant's complaints at trial do not conform to his constitutional complaints on\n\nappeal; we therefore do not address his constitutional complaints.2T\n\n      Additionally, May's testimony dealt with rumors on the street; it did not\n\nconstitute testimony of Complainant's repuiation for truthfulness, nor were his\n\nclaims that he had heard that she was spreadíng rumors                  in any way\n\n      2uHammer,296\n                       S.W.3d at 564-€6 (footnotes omitted).\n     26Tex.\n              R.

And to the extent that his testimony was intended to be evidence of\n\n prior false accusations of sexual assault, such testimony is not admissibfe for the\n\n purpose of showing her character conformity or propensity to lie.28\n\n       Although Appellant also argues that the evidence was admissible to show\n\nmotíve and modus operandi, May candidly admitted that Complainant never\n\naccused him to his face of raping   her. His belief that she had accused hlm was\nbased on rumors that he had heard. The record does not establish confirmation\n\nof May's belief that she falsely accused him of rape. Nor do the rumors he heard\n\nsuggest a motive for falsely accusing Appellant or a modus operandi. May said\n\nthat Complainant would ask him to have sex with her, and he refused. But we\n\ncannot discern how the rumors he heard that she was accusing him of rape were\n\never verified. The record before this court therefore does not establish the\n\nadmissibility of this evidence of purported false accusations of rape under rule\n\n404(b).\n\n      At trial, Appellant explained in seeking admission of the false accusation\n\ntestimony, \"the false claim of rape is going    to credibility.\" We hold that the\nrumors of false rape accusations were not admissible, and based on the record\n\nbefore us, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellant's\n\n\n\n      28See\n              Hammer 296 S.W.3d at 564.\n\n\n\n                                        1B\n\f request to present this evidence before the     jury. We   overrule Appellant's third\n\n issue.\n\n Redmon's and Brown's Opinion Testimony\n\n          ln his fourth and fifth issues, Appellant complains of the exclusion of the\n\n testimony of Redmon and Brown concerning their opinions of Complainant's\n\n credibility. As we understand the record, Appellant appears to have offered\n\nthese opinions by having the women explain specific acts that they suspected\n\n had occurred and speculate on others. He did not offer their testimony on any\n\nconstitutional basis. We therefore do not address the constiiutionaf arguments\n\nhe raises on appeal.2e\n\n          Redmon's testimony was based on her belief ihat Complainant had lied\n\nand had told Redmon's daughter to lie about having given Complainant things\n\nthat Complainani had stolen from Redmon's daughter. Redmon also believed\n\nthat Complainant had lied to her and to her daughter about dating, smoking\n\nmarijuana, and being raped. Appellant explained to the trial court that he was\n\noffering Redmon's test¡mony as \"possibfe opinion testimony on truthfulness.\"\n\n      Brown believed that Complainant had spread untruthful rumors about her\n\ndaughter and that she had stolen her daughter's nail polish. We are not clear on\n\nthe legal basis for which Appellant offered this ev¡dence, other than as an opinion\n\n\n\n      2eSeeTex. R\n                      App P.33.1(aX1); Lovitt,319 S.W.3d at.691-92\n\n\n\n                                          19\n\fof Complainant's truthfulness. Judge Keasler has explained for the Ïexas Court\n\nof Criminal Appeals,\n\n      [A] less common notion of error preservation comes into play in this\n      case, although certainly not a novel one. Professors Goode,\n      Wellborn and Sharlot refer to it as \"party responsibility.\" They\n      explain it this way:\n\n                  To the question, which party has the responsibility\n            regarding any particular matter, it is infallibly accurate to\n            answer with another question: which party                  is\n            complaining now on appeal? This is because in a real\n            sense both pafiies are always responsible for the\n           application of any evidence rule to any evidence.\n           Whichever party complains on appeal about the trial\n           judge's action must, at the earliest opportunity, have\n           done everything necessary to bring to the judge's\n           attention the evidence rule in question and its precise\n           and proper application to the evidence in question.\n\n     The basis for party responsibility is, among other things, Appellate\n     Rule 33.1 . lt provides that as a prerequisite to presenting a\n     complaint for appellate review, the record must show that the party\n     \"stated the grounds for the ruling that (he) sought from the trial court\n     with sufficient specificity to make the trial court aware of the\n     complaint.\" So it is not enough to tell the judge that evidence is\n     admissible. The proponent, if he is the losing party on appeal, must\n     have told the judge why the evidence was admissible.\n\n           We recently discussed this notion in Ma¡tinez y. Sfafe. There,\n    the defendant moved to suppress oral statements due to the State's\n    failure to comply with Art. 20.17. The State argued for the first tíme\n    on appeal that Art. 20.17 did not apply. We concluded that the State\n    forfeited this argument by failing to bring it to the trial judge's\n    attention. We explained that \"both Texas Rule of Appellate\n    Procedure 33.1 and Texas Rule of Evidence 103 are 'judge-\n    protecting' rules of error preservation. The basic principle of both\n    rules is that of 'party responsibility. \"' We recognized that \"the party\n    complaining on appeal (whether rt be the State or the defendant)\n    about a trial court's admissíon, exclusion, or suppression of evidence\n    must, at the earliest oppoñunity, have done everything necessary to\n    bring to the judge's attention the evidence rule or statute in question\n\n\n                                       20\n\f and its precise and proper applicat¡on to the evidence in question.\"\n The issue, we said, \"is not whether the appealing party is the State\n or the defendant or whether the trial court's ruling is legally 'correct'\n in every sense, but whether the complaining party on appeal brought\n to the trial court's attention the very complaint that party is now\n making on appeal.\"\n\n       Similarly, in Willover v. State, the defendant soughi to admit\n two videotaped interviews of the victim. At trial,\n\n       it (was) clear that, although (the defendant) did not\n       actualfy recite the specific rule of evidence he was\n       relying upon, (he) sought to admit the videotapes for\n       impeachment purposes. (He) did not argue, nor was\n       there any discussion at trial, that the tapes were not\n       hearsay or that the videotapes were admissible under\n       any exception to the hearsay rule other than Article\n       38.071 or for impeachment purposes.\n\n       On appeal, the defendant argued for the first time that the\nvideotapes were not hearsay. We relied on the notion of \"party\nresponsibility\" to reject this argument because \"(i)n order to have\nevidence admitted under a hearsay exception, the proponent of the\nevidence must specify which exception he is relyíng upon.\" lt was\nup to the defendant, we said, and \"not the trial court, to specify\nwhich exception to the hearsay rule he was relying upon or to\nspecify how the evidence was not hearsay.\"\n\n       ln some cases, we have applied the \"party responsibility\"\ntheory without using those precise words. ln Clark y. Sfafe, the\nState presented the testimony of Dr. James Grigson that the\ndefendant would be a future danger. The defendant sought at trial\nto introduce a letter and accompanying report which listed eleven\nindividuals convicted of capital murder whose sentences had later\nbeen commuted or reduced. ln several of those cases, Dr. Grigson\nhad predicted that the individual would be a future danger. The trial\ncoud refused to admit the evidence.\n\n      On appeal, the defendant argued that the excluded evidence\nwas admissible to impeach Dr. Grigson and show that his prior\nfuture dangerousness predictions had turned out to be incorrect.\nBut the defendant had not articulated this basis for admission at trial.\nAt trial, he had argued the evidence was admissible to impeach\n\n\n                                  21\n\fstatements that Dr. Grigson had made in Lubbock County. The\nState had objected that the impeachment went to a collateral matter,\nand the trial judge had agreed.\n\n      We rejected the defendant's argument on appeal because he\n\"did not clearly articulate\" that he wanted to admit the evidence to\ndemonstrate Grigson's past mistakes in predicting future\ndangerousness. We said that the trial judge \"never had the\nopportunity to rule upon (the defendant's) appellate rationale.\" Since\nthe defendant \"did not sufficiently clearly expressly offer the\nevidence for the purpose which he now claims on appeal,\" that\nargument could not be raised on appeal.\n\n      Finally, in Jones v. Sfafe, the defendant sought at trial to admit\nthe grand jury testimony of a witness who asserted her Fifih\nAmendment privilege against self-incrimination and refused to\ntestify. The State objected, claiming hearsay. We concluded that\nthe defendant failed to preserve error because he never specified\nwhích portions of the wítness's testimony he wanted to admit into\nevidence. We said:\n\n            The trial court need never sort through challenged\n      evidence in order to segregate the admissible from the\n     excludable, nor is the trial court required to admit only\n     the former part or exclude only the latter part. lf\n     evidence is offered and challenged which contains\n     some of each, the trial court may safely admit it all or\n     exclude it all, and the losing party, no matter who he ís,\n     will be made to suffer on appeal the consequences of\n     his insufficiently specific offer or objection. ln this case,\n     because the trial court chose to exclude the evidence,\n     appellant is the party adversely affected by his own\n     default. Because appellant failed to specify which\n     portion of the transcript he intended to introduce into\n     evidence, the couÍ was presented with a proffer\n     containing both admissible and inadmissible evidence.\n     When evidence which         is\n                                  partlally admissible and\n     partially inadmissible is excluded, a party may not\n     complain upon appeal unless the admissible evídence\n     was specifically offered.\n\n\n\n\n                                 22\n\f                               Application\n\n         ln this case, Reyna argued to the trial judge that the evidence\n should be admitted for \"credibility.\" He said that he was \"not offering\n it to prove the truth of the matter asserted\" and \"not offering it to go\n into her sexuality.\" lnstead, he argued, \"l'm offering to         it\n demonstrate that as to prior sexual activities, that she made\n allegations that there were prior sexual allegations, and recanted.\"\n\n        Reyna did not cite to any rules of evidence, cases, or\n constitutional provisions. Reyna's references to \"the truth of the\n matter asserted\" reflect that he was arguing that the evidence was\n not hearsay under Evidence Rule 801(d). His claim that he was not\n offer¡ng it \"to go into her sexuality\" reflects his argument that the\n evidence should not be excluded under Evidence Rule 412(b).\n These arguments are both based on the Rules of Evidence.\n Reyna's reference to \"credibility\" could be a reference to either the\n Rules of Evidence or the Confrontation Clause.\n\n       Reyna told the trial judge that the purpose of admitt¡ng the\n evidence was to attack the victim's credibility, but he did not provide\nthe basis for admitting the evidence. He could have been relying on\nthe Rules of Evidence or the Confrontation Clause. lt was up to the\njudge to discern some basis for admitting the evidence.\n\n       We have said that \"(t)he purpose of requiring (an) objection is\nto give  to the trial court or the opposing party the opportunity to\ncorrect the error or remove the basis for the objection.\" When a\ndefendani's objection encompasses complaints under both the\nTexas Rules of Ëvidence and the Confrontation Clause, the\nobjection is not sufficiently specific to preserve error. An objection\non hearsay does not preserve error on Confrontation Clause\ngrounds.\n\n      Although this case involves a proffer of evidence rather than\nan objection, the same rationale applies. Reyna did not argue that\nthe Confrontation Clause demanded admission of the evidence.\nReyna's arguments for admitting the evidence could refer to either\nthe Rules of Evidence or the Confrontation Clause. His arguments\nabout hearsay did not put the trial judge on notice that he was\nmaking a Confrontation Clause argument. Because Reyna \"did not\nclearly articulate\" that the Confrontation Clause demanded\nadmission of the evidence, the trial judge \"never had the opportunity\n\f        to rule upon\" this rationale. As the losing party, Reyna must \"suffer\n        on appeal the consequences of his insufficiently specific offer,\"\n        Reyna did not do \"everything necessary to bring to the judge's\n        attention the evidence rule or statute in question and its precise and\n        proper application to the evidence in question.\n\n        ln the case now before this court, Appellant offered the evidence on the\n\n vague basis of \"possible\" opinion iestimony. He did noi sustain his burden of\n\n explaining to the trial court on the record, and by extension to us, why Redmon's\n\n and Brown's testimony was admissibf e-whether under an evidentiary rule or\n\n statute, as an exception to an evidentiary rule or statute, or under a constitutional\n\n provision. We therefore overrule Appellant's fourth and fifth issues.\n\n Conclusion\n\n        Having overruled Appellant's five issues on appeal, we affirm the trial\n\ncourt's judgments.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     isl Lee Ann Dauphinot\n                                                     LEE ANN DAUPHINOT\n                                                     JUSTICE\n\nPANEL: DAUPHINOT, GARDNER, and WALKER, JJ.\n\nPUBLISH\n\nDELIVERED: August 6, 2015\n\n\n\n       31Reyna   v.
