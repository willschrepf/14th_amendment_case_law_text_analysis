(“ CCC” )\nto negotiate licenses with the Department of Commerce and other federal govern­\nment agencies, pursuant to which such agencies would, in exchange for a fee,\nobtain permission to reproduce certain copyrighted materials by photocopying.'\nSee Letter for Dawn E. Johnsen, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Office of\nLegal Counsel, from Andrew J. Pincus, General Counsel, Department of Com­\nmerce at 1 (June 23, 1998) (“ Pincus Letter” ). You inform us that a “ key factor\nin our decision whether such negotiations [with the CCC] even are appropriate\nis whether there are any circumstances under which the Copyright Act might\nrequire a government agency to obtain such a license: if a license is never nec­\nessary, there would be no reason to consider entering into negotiations with the\nCCC, or with individual authors of works.” Id. Accordingly, you have asked for\nour opinion on the following question: “ whether a government agency ever is\nrequired to secure either permission or licensing before making unauthorized\nreproduction and use of materials that are protected by copyright law, or whether\nall government reproduction and use of such materials per se qualifies for the\n‘fair use’ exception from the obligations of the Copyright Act.” Id. You further\nassert that “ [t]here appears to be substantial disagreement within the government\nwith-respect to this issue.” Id. In particular, you suggest that the Commercial\nLitigation Branch of the Department of Justice’s Civil Division may have con­\nveyed to certain agencies the view that “ virtually all photocopying for government\nuse is permitted under the fair use doctrine,” and that that view of the Commercial\n\n   ‘ The CCC, a nonprofit consortium, or “ clearing house,” established in 1977, acts as an agent for participating\npublishers. Under one of the CCC’s offered services, a user pays a flat fee, in exchange for which it receives a\nblanket annual license to make photocopies for internal use of any copyrighted material contained in any o f the\nworks registered with the CCC. The license fee is based on a limited photocopying survey that accounts for the\nlicense’s employee population and the copying fees for the journals regularly copied by that licensee Upon payment\nof the fee, the licensee is authorized for a specified term to make unlimited numbers of photocopies, for internal\nuse, from CCC-registered publications The revenue that the CCC derives from the licensee then is allocated among\nthe publishers that have registered publications with the CCC, with the CCC retaining certain service charges See\nAmerican Geophysical Union v. Texaco, Inc., 802 F. Supp 1, 7 -8 (S.D N.Y 1992) (discussing this CCC licensing\npractice), a jfd , 60 F.3d 913 (2d C ir 1994), cert, dismissed, 516 U.S. 1005 (1995)\n\n\n                                                         87\n\f                           Opinions o f the Office o f Legal Counsel in Volume 23\n\n\nLitigation Branch was “ based upon the decision in Williams & Wilkins Co. v.\nUnited States, 487 F.2d 1345 (Ct. Cl. 1973), a f f d by an equally divided Court,\n420 U.S. 376 (1975).” Id. at 2.\n   As we explain below, while government reproduction of copyrighted material\nfor governmental use would in many contexts be noninfringing because it would\nbe a “ fair use” under section 107 of the Copyright Act of 1976, 17 U.S.C. § 107\n(1994), there is no “ per se” rule under which such government reproduction of\ncopyrighted material invariably qualifies as a fair use.2 It is important to note,\nhowever, that we have been unable to discern any disagreement within the federal\ngovernment on this specific question: To our knowledge, no agency of the execu­\ntive branch has argued, or advised, that government copying is per se a fair use.\nIn particular, the Department o f Justice did not urge such a categorical rule in\nthe Williams & Wilkins litigation, see infra note 15 (brief for the United States\nin the Supreme Court did not dispute that photocopying by the government may\nin some circumstances constitute copyright infringement); and, to our knowledge,\nthe Department has not thereafter proffered any arguments, nor provided any\nadvice, inconsistent with the views expressed in that brief.3\n   We do not, in this opinion, reach any conclusions about the circumstances under\nwhich government agencies should negotiate to obtain photocopying licenses. We\ncaution, however, that a general practice of government agencies entering into\nlicensing agreements in which they pay licensing fees for uses that are fair may,\nover time, undermine the government’s ability to argue successfully that such uses\nare fair. For this and other reasons, government agencies may wish to ensure that,\nif they do negotiate licensing arrangements, such arrangements cover only those\ngovernment photocopying practices that otherwise would, in fact, be infringing.\n   In Part I of this opinion, we provide some background on the fair use doctrine.\nIn Part II, we review the case law regarding government photocopying and fair\nuse, as well as Congress’s enactment of the Copyright Act of 1976, and conclude\nthat government photocopying o f copyrighted materials does not invariably qualify\nas a fair use. Finally, in Part III, we provide some guidance on the factors that\nan agency should consider in determining whether a particular photocopying prac­\ntice would be a fair use and whether to negotiate a license with respect to par­\nticular photocopying practices.\n\n   2 In framing the particular question you have asked us to consider, you refer to “ unauthorized reproduction and\nuse o f materials that are protected by copyright law.” Pincus Letter at 1. The bulk o f your letter and supporting\nmaterials, however, indicates that your inquiry specifically concerns “ photocopying for government u s e ” Id at\n2 Accordingly, we will in this opinion focus, not on all potential federal government uses of copyrighted materials,\nbut instead, on government photocopying o f copyrighted materials for internal government use. We note, in particular,\nthat this opinion does not specifically consider the circumstances under which it would be a fair use for an agency\nto republish copyrighted materials in government publicauons or in publicly available databases.\n   3 Indeed, a Department o f Energy memorandum that you provided as an attachment to your letter indicates that\nthe Commercial Litigation Division of the Department o f Justice has informed the Department of Energy that, in\nits view, som e cases o f government photocopying likely would not be fair uses. See Memorandum for Jim Chafin\nand All Field Offices, from Paul A G ottlieb, Assistant G eneral Counsel for Technology Transfer and Intellectual\nProperty, U nited States Department of Energy, Re: Copyright Clearance Center at 2 (May 23,1995).\n\n\n                                                         88\n\f     Whether Government Reproduction o f Copyrighted Materials is a Noninfringing “Fair Use'\n\n\n                                  I. The Fair Use Doctrine\n\n   Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution empowers Congress to “ promote the\nProgress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors\nand Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.”\nU.S. Const, art. I, § 8, cl. 8. Pursuant to that power, Congress enacted the Copy­\nright Act of 1976, Pub. L. No. 94-553, 90 Stat. 2541 (1976) (codified as amended\nat 17 U.S.C. §101 et seq. (1994)) (the “ Copyright Act” or the “ 1976 Act” ).\nSection 106 of the Copyright Act provides, inter alia, that the owner of a copy­\nright under Title 17 of the United States Code “ has the exclusive rights . . .\nto reproduce the copyrighted work in copies,” and to “ authorize” such reproduc­\ntion. 17 U.S.C. § 106(1) (1994). Those “ exclusive rights,” however, are\n“ [sjubject to” limitations codified in “ sections 107 through 120” of the 1976\nAct. Id. § 106. For present purposes, the most important of those limitations is\nfound in section 107 of the Copyright Act, id. § 107. That section, which is entitled\n“ Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use,” provides, in pertinent part:\n\n        Notwithstanding the provisions of section[] 106 . . ., the fair use\n        of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies\n        . . ., for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting,\n        teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship,\n        or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining\n        whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair\n        use the factors to be considered shall include —\n\n        (1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such\n        use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational pur­\n        poses;\n\n        (2) the nature of the copyrighted work;\n\n        (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation\n        to the copyrighted work as a whole; and\n\n        (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value\n        of the copyrighted work.\n\n   Section 107’s “ fair use” limitation on copyright, and the particular factors\nenumerated in that section, reflect and incorporate a longstanding common law\ndoctrine. See Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. The Nation Enters ., 471 U.S.\n539, 549 (1985). From the “ infancy of copyright protection,” courts have found\nit necessary to provide some opportunity for fair use of copyrighted materials\nin order “ to fulfill copyright’s very purpose, ‘[t]o promote the Progress of Science\n\n                                              89\n\f                             Opinions o f the Office o f Legal Counsel in Volume 23\n\n\nand useful Arts.’ ” Cam pbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569, 575 (1994).\nBefore enactment of the 1976 Act, however, the fair-use doctrine was “ exclu­\nsively [a] judge-made doctrine.” Id. at 576. When it codified the fair use doctrine\nin section 107 of the 1976 Act, “ Congress meant ‘to restate the present judicial\ndoctrine of fair use, not to change, narrow, or enlarge it in any way’ and intended\nthat courts continue the common-law tradition of fair use adjudication.” Id. at\n577 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 94-1476, at 66 (1976) ( “ House Report” ), reprinted\nin 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5679; S. Rep. No. 94-473, at 62 (1975) ( “ Senate\nReport” )); accord H arper & Row, 471 U.S. at 554.4\n   As noted above, the fair use doctrine, like the copyright protections that it quali­\nfies, is necessary in order “ to fulfill copyright’s very purpose, ‘[t]o promote the\nProgress of Science and useful Arts.’ ” Campbell, 510 U.S. at 575; see also, e.g.,\nH arper & Row, 471 U.S. at 545 ( “ copyright is intended to increase and not to\nimpede the harvest of knowledge” ). As the Supreme Court recently emphasized,\n“ [t]he fair use doctrine thus ‘permits [and requires] courts to avoid rigid applica­\ntion of the copyright statute when, on occasion, it would stifle the very creativity\nwhich that law is designed to foster.’ ” Campbell, 510 U.S. at 577 (quoting\nStew art v. Abend, 495 U.S. 207, 236 (1990) (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted)).5\n\n\n\n\n   4 In 1992, Congress added the following senience to the end o f 17 U S C §107, in order to clanfy that the\nfair-use limitation is applicable to unpublished works: “ The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar\na finding o f fair use if such finding is m ade upon consideration o f all the above factors ” Pub L No. 102-492,\n106 Stat 3145 (1992). Arguably, application of the fair use doctrine to unpublished works is one way in which\nsection 107 departs from the common law. See, e g , H.R Rep No 102-836, at 4 (1992) ( “ The common law,\ngoing back to late eighteenth century English cases, had been stnct in prohibiting fair use of unpublished works\nunder the theory that the author should decide when and in what form his or her work should first reach the public ” ),\nreprinted in 1992 U S C.C A.N. 2553, 2556; Salinger v Random House, In c , 811 F.2d 90, 95 (2d Cir.) (“ Though\ncom m on law, especially as developed in England, appears to have denied the defense of fair use to unpublished\nworks, see W. Patry, The Fair Use Privilege in Copyright Law 436—41 (1985), the 1976 Act explicitly makes all\nof the rights protected by copynght, including the right o f first publication, subject to the defense of fair use.” ),\ncert denied, 484 U.S. 890 (1987); New Era Publications In t’l, AP S v Henry Holt & C o , 695 F Supp. 1493,\n1502 (S D N.Y 1988) (Copyright Act’s application o f fair use doctnne to unpublished work was “ in departure\nfrom the common law rule” ), a jfd , 873 F.2d 576 (2d Cir. 1989), cert denied, 493 U.S 1094 (1990) But see\nH arper &.

Aiken, 422 U S 151, 156 (1975))1\n     T he limited scope o f the copynght holder’s statutory monopoly             reflects a balance of competing claims\n     upon the public interest: CreaUve w ork is to be encouraged and rewarded, but pnvate motivation must\n    •ultimately serve the cause of promoting broad public avajlability o f literature, music, and the other arts.\n     The immediate effect o f our copyright law is to secure a fair return for an ‘author’s’ creative labor But\n     the ultimate aim is, by this incentive, to stimulate artistic creativity for the general public good\n\n\n                                                            90\n\f       Whether Government Reproduction o f Copyrighted Materials is a Noninfringing ‘ ‘Fair U se'\n\n\n                             II. Fair Use and Government Photocopying\n\n   The federal government can be liable for violation of the copyright laws. Con­\ngress has expressly provided that a work protected by the copyright laws can\nbe “ infringed by the United States,” 28 U.S.C. § 1498(b) (1994),6 and further\nhas provided that “ the exclusive action which may be brought for such infringe­\nment shall be an action by the copyright owner against the United States in the\nCourt of Federal Claims for the recovery of his reasonable and entire compensa­\ntion as damages for such infringement,” 28 U.S.C. § 1498(b) (Supp. Ill 1997).\nAt the same time, it cannot be disputed that the federal government’s copying\n(and other use) of copyrighted materials is subject to the fair use doctrine codified\nin 17 U.S.C. § 107.7 It follows that any federal government photocopying that\nis a fair use is not infringing. However, there is no basis for concluding that\nthe photocopying of copyrighted materials by the federal government automati­\ncally or invariably constitutes a fair use.\n   The case law provides very little guidance on the question of when government\nphotocopying is a fair use. Reported cases involving application of the fair use\ndoctrine to governmental conduct are rare. Indeed, the Williams & Wilkins deci­\nsion, to which your letter refers and which we discuss below, is one of the only\npublished opinions containing a significant discussion of governmental fair use.8\nAnd, outside the context of public schools, we have found only one case —\ninvolving circumstances far removed from those at issue in this opinion — in\nwhich a court has rejected a government’s assertion that its use of copyrighted\nmaterials was fair.9 What is more, even outside the context of governmental use,\n\n   6 See also H.R. Rep. No 86-624, at 2 (1959) (“ When the Government deliberately publishes a copyrighted article\nwithout obtaining the prior consent o f the copynght proprietor, the general assumption would be lhat the holder,\npursuant to the pnnciples o f ‘just compensation’ under the fifth amendment of our Constitution, should be entitled\nto an action against the Government for infringement ” )\n   7 There is nothing in the statute to suggest that the federal government cannot invoke the fair use doctnne. The\n legislative history indicates lhat cenain governmental uses can be fair. See infra notes 19, 24 And the courts uni­\nformly have assumed that the fair use analysis provided in section 107 o f the Act applies to government uses of\ncopynghted matenals See, e.g., the cases cited in note 8, infra\n   8 A few other cases contain less extensive discussion o f governmental fair use. See, e g . Association o f Am. Med.\nColleges v. Cuomo, 928 F.2d 519, 523-26 (2d Cir.), cert denied, 502 U.S 862 (1991), College Entrance Examination\nBd. v Pataki, 889 F.

In that case, the distnct court, on a motion\nfor preliminary injunction, found a likelihood o f success on plaintiffs’ infringement claim against a state government.\nThat case did not involve government copying for internal government use. See supra note 2. Instead, the case\ninvolved a challenge to a state statute that required testing organizations to disclose copies of their copynghted,\nconfidential tests and related materials, and that further provided that such materials, once disclosed, would become\npublic records.\n   There also are at least two decisions in which courts have found that a distnbution of multiple copies o f copyrighted\nmaterials to students in a public school was not a fair use. See Marcus v Rowley, 695 F.2d 1171, 1174—79 (9th\n                                                                                                               Continued\n\n\n                                                          91\n\f                             Opinions o f the Office o f Legal Counsel in Volume 23\n\n\nthere is only a small handful of reported cases involving whether and under what\ncircumstances photocopying is a fair use.10\n   The sole reported decision (apart from the classroom context) concerning\nwhether government photocopying is a fair use is Williams & Wilkins Co. v.\nUnited States, 487 F.2d 1345 (Ct. Cl. 1973), a j f d by an equally divided Court,\n420 U.S. 376 (1975). The plaintiff in that case challenged certain practices of\nthe National Institutes of Health ( “ NIH” ) and the National Library of Medicine\n(“ N LM ” ). The NIH library ran a photocopying service for the benefit of its\nresearch staff: On request, researchers could obtain a photocopy of an article from\nany of the journals in the library’s collection, typically to assist them in their\non-going projects or for background reading. As a general matter, NIH would\nagree to provide a requester only one copy of a particular article, only one article\nper journal issue, and no article o f over 50 pages. In 1970, the library filled 85,744\nrequests for photocopies of journal articles (including journals published by W il­\nliams & Wilkins), constituting about 930,000 pages. See 487 F.2d at 1348. NLM\nis a repository of much of the w orld’s medical literature, in essence a “ librarians’\nlibrary.” Id. Upon request, NLM would provide photocopies of journal articles,\nfree of charge, to other libraries and like research- and education-oriented institu­\ntions, both public and private (including commercial organizations, such as drug\ncompanies). NLM provided only one photocopy of a particular article per request,\nand would not honor a request for photocopying of an entire journal issue. In\n 1968, a representative year, NLM filled about 120,000 requests by photocopying\njournal articles. NLM made no effort to ascertain the ultimate use to which the\n\nCir. 1983), Wihtol v. Crow, 309 F.2d 777, 780-81 (8lh C ir 1962) Such classroom cases may be instructive on\nthe general matter o f fair use in the context o f reproduction for nonprofit purposes However, such cases typically\ninvolve archival collection o r distribution o f multiple copies o f copynghted materials that were, in the first instance,\nprepared and marketed primarily for use in the very same classroom setting. See, e.g., Marcus, 695 F.2d at 1175\nW e assume that the government photocopying practices about which you are concerned will rarely, if ever, involve\nfederal government duplication for educational use m a classroom, or practices that fairly can be said to be analogous\nto those at issue in Marcus O f course, insofar as certain federal government practices are akin to those at issue\nin the classroom cases, then the courts’ reasoning in decisions such as Marcus would be germane to the fair use\nanalysis (The holding in Wihtol is of less practical value, since the court in that case merely held that “ [w]hatever\nmay be the breadth o f the doctnne of ‘fair use,’ it is not conceivable to us that the copying of all, or substantially\nall, o f a copynghted song can be held to be a ‘fair use’ merely because the infnnger had no intent to infringe ”\n309 F.2d at 780.) Furthermore, with respect to such cases it may be mstrucuve to look to the legislative history\no f the 1976 Act, m which the House Committee on the Judiciary reproduced (i) an “ Agreement on Guidelines\nfor C lassroom Copying in Not-for-Profit Educational Institutions with Respect to Books and Periodicals,” which\nhad been drafted by representatives of author/publisher and educational organizations, and (n) a similar, more special­\nized set o f “ Guidelines for Educational Uses o f M usic,” which had been drafted by representatives of music pub­\nlishing and educational organizations See House Report at 66-72, reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N at 5680-86.

In that Court, the Depart­\nment of Justice argued that the Court of Claims correctly analyzed the fair use\nquestion, and that the Court should affirm the judgment in favor of the United\nStates. See Brief for the United States, Williams & Wilkins Co. v. United States,\n420 U.S. 376 (1975) (No. 73-1279); Paul Goldstein, Copyright’s Highway 113—\n26 (1994) (describing Supreme Court proceedings). An equally divided Court,\nwithout opinion, affirmed the low er court judgment. See 420 U.S. 376 (1975).\n   Congress was well aware of the dispute in Williams & Wilkins and of the Court\no f Claims’ plea that Congress enact legislation to resolve the difficult fair use\nquestions raised in that case. See, e.g., Senate Report at 71. And, in the 1976\nAct, Congress did take three steps with respect to the matter of photocopying.\nFirst, in section 106 of the Act, Congress expressly affirmed that the rights of\na copyright owner include the rights “ to reproduce the copyrighted work in\ncopies” and to “ authorize” such reproduction. 17 U.S.C. §106(1) (1994).11\nSecond, the text of section 107 of the Act — in which Congress for the first time\nformally codified the fair use doctrine — expressly provides that “ reproduction\nin copies . . . for purposes such as . . . news reporting, teaching . . ., scholar­\nship, or research,” can be “ the fair use of a copyrighted work.” Finally, in section\n 108 of the Act, Congress provided that certain forms of library and archival\nphotocopying are not infringing, see 17 U.S.C.A. § 108 (West 1996 & Supp.\n 1999), thereby creating a discrete carve-out, or safe harbor, that does not “ in\nany way affect[] the right o f fair use as provided by section 107,” 17 U.S.C.\n§ 108(f)(4) (1994). However, Congress did not otherwise resolve the fair use ques­\ntions raised in Williams <£ Wilkins, and, in particular, did not identify the cir­\ncumstances under which photocopying — and government photocopying in par­\nticular— would, or would not, constitute fair use under section 107 of the 1976\nA ct.12 Instead, as explained above, Congress simply enacted 17 U.S.C. §107 in\n   11 As the court in Williams & Wilkins indicated, see 487 F.2d at 1350-51, 1359, there had been some question\nwhether, under the then-existing copynght laws, the exclusive nghts of the copyright owner included the right to\ncontrol the copying o f books and penodicals for personal use.

The Wil­\nliams & Wilkins court, after discussing at length the eight different considerations,\nor “ elements,” that contributed to its decision, 487 F.2d at 1353-62, emphasized\nthat its holding (that the library copying practices at issue were noninfringing)\n\n     This is incorrect, because section 108 of the 1976 Act does not narrow the protection for fair use provided by\n the common-law doctnne codified in section 107 Section 108(a) o f the Act, 17 U.S.C A § 108(a) (West 1996 &\n Supp 1999), provides that, under certain conditions, it is “ not an infringement of copynght for a library or archives\n      . to reproduce no more than one copy or phonorecord o f a work, or to distribute such copy or phonorecord,”\n  “ [notw ithstanding the provisions o f section 106.” Section 108(g)(2), in turn, states that “ (t]he rights of reproduction\n and distnbution under this section . . . do not extend” to certain cases involving the “ systematic reproduction\n or distribution of single or multiple copies.” (Emphasis added) Section 108(g)(2) does not “ expressly proscnbe[]”\n the copying practices at issue in Williams & Wilkins — indeed, nothing in section 108 “ proscnbes” any practice\n at all. Nor is there anything in section 108 suggesting that “ systematic” reproduction is “ lawful only via the [section\n 108(g)(2)] proviso, [and] could not be a fair use ” United States Copynght Office, Report o f the Register o f Copy­\n rights' Library Reproduction o f Copyrighted Works (17 U.S.C. 108), at 98 (1983) ( “ 1983 Register Report” ) At\n most, section 108(g)(2) merely provides that the “ n ghts” to copy and distribute that are provided “ under” section\n  108 “ do not extend to” the “ systematic” practices descnbed in section 108(g)(2) To be sure, “ section 108 author­\n izes certain photocopying practices which may not qualify as a fair use,” House Report at 74 (emphasis added),\n reprinted in 1976 U.S C.C.A N. at 5688, see also Senate Report at 67 However, the statute does not provide, or\n even suggest, that the circumstances under which copying is noninfringing under section 108(a) are those “ lhat\n would typically not amount to fair use [under section 107],” White Paper at 84-85 (emphasis added), nor that\n “ Section 108 was enacted to make lawful some types o f copying which would otherwise be infringements o f copy­\n right, fair use notwithstanding,” 1983 Register Report at 96 (emphasis added) Indeed, by its express terms, nothing\n in section 108 “ in any way affects the nght of fair use as provided by section 107.” 17 U.S.C § 108(f)(4) (1994);\nsee uiso House Report at 74 ( “ No provision of section 108 is intended to lake away any nghts existing under\n the fair use doctrine.” ), reprinted in 1976 U .S C C .A N at 5687-88, Senate Report at 67 (same); 122 Cong. Rec.\n 3836 (1976) (statement o f Sen Magnuson) ( “ the Judiciary Committee clearly sel out in iheir report                that the\n fair use doctrine not only applies to reproduction practices of libraries, but that in no way did they intend section\n 108 to be a limitation upon the fair use doctnne” ).\n    Accordingly, whether section 108 renders certain copying practices “ not an infringement” does not affect w hether\nsuch practices are noninfringing fair uses under section 107 See Texaco, 802 F. Supp. at 28 & n 26 (emphasizing\nthat “ Section 108 is a separate special statutory exemption governed by an entirely different set of standards [than\nunder section 107],” and rejecting the argument “ that the understanding o f Section 107 should be influenced by\nwhat is permitted under Section 108” ); accord 4 Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright\n§ 13.05[E][2], at 13-240 (1998) A certain copying practice can be “ noninfnnging” under section 107, under section\n 108, under both provisions, or under neither. In ils 1983 Report, the Register of Copyrights suggested that such\na construction o f the statute, in which practices permissible under section 108 might also be permissible under section\n 107, would “ render §108 superfluous.” 1983 Register Report at 96 n.4 That is not the case, however. As the\nRegister noted, “ the library community sought § 108 to permit copying that had not been spelled out in the proposed\nfair use provision ” Id. (emphasis added). Section 108 identifies (“ spell[s] out” ) as noninfnnging a category of\nlibrary photocopying that may, or may not, constitute fair use Section 108 thus fairly can be viewed as a very\nvaluable— and not superfluous— safe harbor: If a certain library practice is noninfringing under the specific and\ndetailed provisions of section 108(a) (as confined by section 108(g)(2)), a library need not be concerned about how\nthat particular photocopying practice would fare under section 107’s more complex and indeterminate fair use stand­\nards.\n    13 Section 1498(b) o f title 28 provides that “ the exclusive action which may be brought for mfnngement [by\nthe federal government] shall be an action by the copynght owner against the United States in the Court of Federal\nClaims ” 28 U.S.C § 1498(b) (Supp. Ill 1997). Decisions o f lhat court are appealable to the United States Court\no f Appeals for the Federal Circuit, see 28 U S C § 1295(a)(3) (1994), which in turn considers itself bound by\ndecisions (such as Williams & Wilkins) that the former Court of Claims issued pnor to October 1982. See South\nCorp v. United States, 690 F 2d 1368, 1370 & n.2 (Fed Cir 1982); see also, e.g., Gargoyles, Inc. v. United States,\n113 F 3d 1572, 1576 (Fed C ir 1997).\n\n\n                                                           95\n\f                            Opinions o f the Office o f Legal Counsel in Volume 23\n\n\nwas based upon all of the elements present in that case, and that its decision\nwould not necessarily resolve different cases “ with other significant variables,”\nid. at 1362. The court expressly noted that it was not determining whether any\nof the particular elements in the Williams & Wilkins case would be sufficient\nfor a finding of fair use, nor whether all of the relevant elements cumulatively\nwere “ essential” to the finding o f fair use: It sufficed for the court simply to\ndecide that “ at least when all co-exist in combination a ‘fair use’ is made out.”\nId.\\ see also id. ( “ we feel a strong need to obey the canon of judicial parsimony,\nbeing stingy rather than expansive in the reach of our holding” ).14 Implicitly,\nthen, the decision in Williams & Wilkins itself suggests that there may be some\ncircumstances under which government photocopying might be infringing. See\nalso Brief for the United States at 14, Williams. & Wilkins Co. v. United States,\n420 U.S. 376 (1975) (No. 73-1279) (“ The doctrine is applied as its rationale\ndictates in each case, and has no sharp edges.” ).15\n   A ‘ ‘per se’ ’ rule also would be inconsistent with the approach that the Supreme\nCourt subsequently has taken in its decisions involving section 107 of the Copy­\nright Act. The Court repeatedly has emphasized that the task of determining\nwhether a particular use is fair “ is not to be simplified with bright-line rules,\nfor the statute, like the doctrine it recognizes, calls for case-by-case analysis.”\nCam pbell, 510 U.S. at 577; accord id. at 584 (Congress “ ‘eschewed a rigid,\nbright-line approach to fair use,’ ” in favor of “ a ‘sensitive balancing of\ninterests.’ ” ) (quoting Sony Corp. o f America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464\nU.S. 417, 449 n.31, 455 n.40 (1984)); H arper & Row, A ll U.S. at 552 (“ fair\nuse analysis must always be tailored to the individual case” ).\n\n   III. D eterm ining Whether a Particular Government Photocopying Practice is a\n                                                       Fair Use\n\n  Our conclusion that government photocopying is not invariably noninfringing\ndoes not, of course, answer the question whether government agencies should\nenter into licensing agreements for photocopying, and if so, what the terms and\n\n   14 M ore recent fair use decisions involving photocopying similarly have been confined narrowly to the particular\ncopying practices in dispute See, e g , Texaco, 60 F.3d at 931 ( “ Our ruling is confined to the institutional, systematic,\narchival multiplication o f copies revealed by the record— the precise copying that the parties stipulated should be\nthe basis for . . .d e c is io n . ”)\n   15 As we discuss supra p. 88, we have no reason to believe that any agency of the executive branch has argued,\nor advised, that government copying is “ per se a fair use.” In this respect, it is notable in particular lhat, in its\nSupreme Court brief in Williams <6 Wilkins, the United States cited a House Report as “ indicating]                  . that\nphotocopying by the government may in som e circumstances constitute copynght infringement ” B nef for the United\nStates at 15 n 24, Williams & Wilkins Co. v. United States, 420 U.S. 376 (1975) (No 73-1279) (citing H.R. Rep.\nNo 86-624, at 5 (1959)) In the cited House Report, a House Committee indicated that the federal government\ncould infringe a copyright when it “ publishes” an article without permission See supra note 6. The Committee\ndid not indicate what it meant by “ publishes,” and did not expressly mention photocopying At the page of the\nH ouse Report (page 5) that the Solicitor General cited, however, a letter wntten by the Department of Commerce\nassumes that government photocopying could be infringing. See also id. at 8 (reflecting a similar assumption conveyed\nby the Librarian o f Congress) There is no suggestion in the House Report that the House Committee disagreed\nw ith this assumption.\n\n\n                                                            96\n\f       Whether Government Reproduction o f Copyrighted Materials is a Noninfringing “Fair Use ’\n\n\nconditions of such agreements should be. In answering that question, there is an\n inescapable tension. On the one hand, because of the highly fact-bound nature\nof the fair use inquiry, it is difficult to ascertain in advance which governmental\npractices will, or will not, be fair uses: There is an “ endless variety of situations\nand combinations of circumstances that can rise in particular cases.” House Report\nat 66, reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5680. Such uncertainty, when viewed\nin isolation, might weigh in favor of entering into relatively broad licensing agree­\nments, so as to ensure that an agency’s photocopying will never be infringing.\nOn the other hand, and in addition to the desire to avoid unnecessary costs, there\nis an important legal consideration that counsels against entering into unnecessary\nlicensing agreements and in favor of limiting such agreements to encompass only\nthose photocopying practices that are infringing — namely, the concern that gen­\neral custom and usage may be integral to the fair use analysis.16 Indeed, at least\none court has opined, in particular, that whether it is “ fair,” under the copyright\nlaw, to engage in a photocopying practice without compensation may depend,\nin part, on whether similarly situated entities customarily agree to pay a fee to\nthe copyright holders.17 We have no occasion here to consider whether that court\nwas correct in this regard; but it is possible that other courts may follow suit.\nAccordingly, if government agencies routinely agree to pay licensing fees to\nengage in photocopying practices that were fair uses at the time, there is a chance\nsome courts may conclude that a growing or longstanding custom o f paying such\nfees weighs against a finding that such photocopying practices are fair uses when\nunlicensed. Thus, an agency that decides to negotiate a photocopying license\nshould seek to limit the scope of the licensing agreement so as not to cover those\nphotocopying practices that the agency, in good faith, concludes are not infringing.\n   In the end, each agency must do its best to evaluate whether any o f its\nphotocopying practices are infringing, and, if so, to obtain proper authorization\nfor such uses of copyrighted materials. Although, as we have explained, there\nmay be many government photocopying practices that are fair uses (or that are,\nfor other reasons, not infringing), under some circumstances government\nphotocopying may not be a fair use. In evaluating whether their practices are\ninfringing, agencies should be guided by Williams & Wilkins, which, as noted\nabove, is still binding precedent in the Federal Circuit. However, as explained\nabove, the holding in Williams & Wilkins itself was dependent on the particular\nfacts of that case, and the 8150 calculus may be different with respect to govern­\n\n   16 See, e g , Williams & Wilkins * 487 F 2 d at 1355-56, see also Harper & Row, 471 U S . at 550 (the fair use\ndoctnne traditionally “ was predicated on the author’s implied consent to ‘reasonable and customary’ use when he\nreleased his work for public consum ption” )\n   17 See Princeton Univ. Press, 99 F.3d at 1387 (consideration of the potential licensing revenues for photocopying\nin a fair use analysis is “ especially” appropnate where the copynght holder not only has an interest in exploiting\nthe licensing market, but also “ has actually succeeded in doing so” ) But c f Campbell, 510 U.S. at 585 n.18 (defend­\nants’ request for permission to use copyrighted song in a parody does “ not necessarily suggest that they believed\ntheir version was not fair use; the offer may simply have been made in a good-faith effort to avoid this litiganon” ).\n\n\n                                                         97\n\f                           Opinions o f the Office o f Legal Counsel in Volume 23\n\n\nment photocopying practices that diverge in material ways from the NIH and NLM\npractices at issue in Williams & Wilkins .18\n   Moreover, agencies should be aware that, in two important recent cases in other\ncircuits, sharply divided courts o f appeals have held that certain commercial\nphotocopying practices were not fair uses. In Princeton Univ. Press v. Michigan\nDocument Servs., Inc., 99 F.3d 1381 (6th Cir. 1996) (en banc), cert, denied, 520\nU.S. 1156 (1997), the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held\nthat a commercial copyshop had engaged in willful infringement by reproducing\nsubstantial segments of copyrighted works of scholarship and binding such repro­\nductions into coursepacks that the copyshop then sold to students. In American\nGeophysical Union v. Texaco, Inc., 60 F.3d 913 (2d Cir. 1994), cert, dismissed,\n516 U.S. 1005 (1995), the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit\nheld that Texaco’s systematic photocopying o f scientific journal articles for its\nresearchers’ archival use was infringing. Even if the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Federal Circuit were to adopt the reasoning of these decisions,\nthe rationale of those decisions would not apply with full force in the context\nof government photocopying, since the decisions each rested, in part, on the fact\nthat each of the defendants “ acquire[d] conspicuous financial rewards from its\nuse of the copyrighted material.” Id. at 922; see also Princeton Univ. Press, 99\nF.3d at 1386, 1389. Moreover, as the Texaco court noted, “ courts are more willing\nto find a secondary use [i.e., the use that is made of the photocopies] fair when\nit produces a value that benefits the broader public interest.” 60 F.3d at 922.\nNevertheless, the ongoing debate among the judges in cases such as these (and\nin W illiams & Wilkins) demonstrates that the boundaries of fair use in the\nphotocopying context are uncertain, highly contested, and especially dependent\nupon the particulars of a given case. And, while in some cases it might be fairly\neasy for an agency to determine that a government practice is noninfringing,19\nusually that will not be the case: Whether a particular government photocopying\npractice is a fair use often will depend upon a “ ‘sensitive balancing of\n\n   18 M oreover, the subsequent advent of the CCC, and the possibility of reasonable licensing agreements with that\norganization, may affect at least one of the factors that led the Court of Claims to rule against the copyright holder\nin Williams & Wilkins. The Court of C laim s reasoned that medical science would be seriously hurt by a finding\nthat the NIH and NLM photocopying was infringing, since the result of such a holding could have been that libraries\nw ould have to cease their photocopying practices. See 487 F.2d at 1356-57 But insofar as such libraries now could\navoid a finding o f fair use by agreeing to pay a reasonable and affordable licensing fee — that is, a fee that would\nnot materially deter the actual making and use o f valuable photocopies — the harm that the Williams & Wilkins\ncourt foresaw could be diminished See Texaco, 60 F 3d at 924 (“ To the extent the copying practice was ‘reasonable’\nin 1973 [when Williams & Wilkins was decided], it has ceased to be ‘reasonable’ as the reasons that justified it\nbefore [photocopying licensing] have ceased to exist ’) (quoting the district court opinion, 802 F. Supp. at 25)\nBut see id at 934 (Jacobs, J , dissenting).\n   19 For an example outside the context o f photocopying, see, e.g., House Report at 73 ( “ The Committee has consid­\nered the question o f publication, in Congressional hearings and documents, of copynghted material. Where the length\nof the work or excerpt published and the number of copies authonzed are reasonable under the circumstances, and\nthe work itself is directly relevant to a matter o f legitimate legislative concern, the Committee believes that the\npublication would constitute fair use.” ), reprinted in 1976 U .S C.C A.N at 5687\n\n\n                                                         98\n\f       Whether Government Reproduction o f Copyrighted Materials is a Noninfringing \"Fair U se’\n\n\ninterests.’ ” Cam pbell, 510 U.S. at 584 (quoting Sony Corp. o f America v. Uni­\nversal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 455 n.40 (1984)).\n   In the text of section 107 of the Copyright Act itself, Congress has instructed\nthat, in determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is\na fair use, ‘‘the factors to be considered shall include’’ the following:\n\n           (1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such\n           use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational pur­\n           poses;\n\n           (2) the nature of the copyrighted work;\n\n           (3) the amount and substantially of the portion used in relation\n           to the copyrighted work as a whole; and\n\n           (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value\n           of the copyrighted work.\n\nThese four statutory factors should not be treated in isolation, one from another.\nCampbell , 510 U.S. at 578. Nor are those factors exhaustive. See H arper & Row,\n471 U.S. at 560; H.R. Rep. No. 102-836, at 9-10 (1992), reprinted in 1992\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 2553, 2561-62.20 Most importantly, it is critical that the statutory\nfactors, as well as all other pertinent factors and considerations, “ be explored,\nand the results weighed together, in light o f the purposes o f copyright.\" Campbell,\n510 U.S. at 578 (emphasis added); see also id. at 581 (the fair use inquiry requires\nthat any particular use of copyrighted material “ be judged, case by case, in light\nof the ends of the copyright law” ).21 Accordingly, before turning to particular\nfactors and considerations that agencies should consider in the context of govern­\nment photocopying, it is important once again to identify the “ purposes of copy­\nright.”\n   Copyright law “ ultimately serves the purpose of enriching the general public\nthrough access to creative works.” Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., 510 U.S. 517-18,\n527 (1994); see also H arper <£ Row, 471 U.S. at 545 (“ copyright is intended\nto increase and not to impede the harvest of knowledge” ). Thus, in determining\nwhether a particular photocopying practice is a fair use, the ultimate question to\nbe answered is whether permitting the government to continue to engage in the\npractice without paying a licensing fee would “ serve[] the copyright objective\n\n   20 Section 107 expressly provides that “ the factors to be considered shall include” the four enumerated factors\n(emphasis added), and the 1976 Act elsewhere provides that the term “ including” is “ illustrative and not limitative,”\n17 U S.C. § 101 (1994)\n   21 See also 4 Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer, N immer on Copyright § 13 05[A][5], at 13-195 (1998) (“ the\nprotean factors enumerated in Section 107, standing by themselves, lack the concreteness to provide definite answers\nto difficult cases” ); Lloyd L Weinreb, Fair Use, 61 Fordham L.

Rev. 1105, 1110 (1990), cited with approval in Campbell,\n510 U.S. at 5 7 8 .2 2\n   Moreover, although the point is less clearly established, the fair use doctrine\nmay be understood to contemplate permitting uses that serve “ not only . . . the\npurpose of copyright but also . . . other socially recognized purposes.” Lloyd\nL. Weinreb, F a ir’s Fair: A Comment on the Fair Use Doctrine, 103 Harv. L.\nRev. 1137, 1144 (1990). For example, the Supreme Court in the Sony case held\nthat consumer videotaping of television broadcasts for purposes of “ time-shifting”\nwas a fair use, in part because such a practice “ yields societal benefits.” 464\nU.S. at 454. Elaborating on this point, the Court cited the example of using a\nvideotaping machine “ to enable a [hospital] patient to see programs he would\notherwise miss,” which, as the Court explained, “ has no productive purpose other\nthan contributing to the psychological well-being of the patient.” Id. at 455 n.40.\nO f greater pertinence to the subject matter at hand — namely, government\ncopying — the Court further suggested that “ a legislator who copies for the sake\no f broadening her understanding o f what her constituents are watching; or a con­\nstituent who copies a news program to help make a decision on how to vote,”\nare examples of uses that could be “ fair.” Id.\n   Thus, it fairly can be argued that, as a general matter, “ courts are more willing\nto find a secondary use fair when it produces a value that benefits the broader\npublic interest,” Texaco, 60 F.3d at 922, in contrast with a use that “ can fairly\nbe characterized as a form o f ‘commercial exploitation,’ i.e., when the copier\ndirectly and exclusively acquires conspicuous financial rewards from its use of\nthe copyrighted material,” id .23 For instance, the federal government typically\nphotocopies materials in order to facilitate some other, “ secondary” use of such\nmaterials, and such secondary use generally is aimed at providing a public benefit,\nor at serving a “ broad[] public purpose.” Id. Insofar as an agency’s photocopying\nis intended to facilitate such public purposes, that should weigh in favor of a\nfinding of fair use.24 See a lso infra p. 101 (discussing whether purpose of the\nphotocopying is to enhance profitmaking).\n\n   22 See also, e.g., Atari Games Corp. v Nintendo o f Am., Inc., 975 F 2 d 832, 843 (Fed. Cir 1992) (where, m\n“ reverse engineering” o f computer softw are, “ intermediate” copying permitted the user to study that software and\nthereafter design new video game program s, the resultant “ growth in creative expression” weighed in favor of\nfinding that the copying was a fair use).\n   23See also, e g ., N im m er, § 13.05[B][4], at 13-205 ( “ The public interest is also a factor that continually informs\nthe fair use analysis ” ) (footnote omitted).\n   24 See, e.g., Williams & Wilkins, 487 F 2 d at 1353 ( “ W e cannot believe, for instance, that a judge who makes\nand gives to a colleague a photocopy o f a law review article, m one o f the smaller or less available journals, which\nbears directly on a problem both ju d g es are then considering in a case before them is infringing the copynght,\nrather than making ‘fair use’ of his issue o f that journal.” ), Key Maps, I n c , 470 F. Supp at 38 (county fire marshal’s\ndistribution o f copies o f copynghted m aps to 50 fire departments, law enforcement agencies, and civil defense units\nin the county was “ legitimate, fair, and reasonable,” since the copies were disseminated “ solely for internal purposes\nwhich related to a discemable public interest,” namely, “ the coordination of fire prevention activities in the unincor­\nporated areas o f [the] county” ), see also House Report at 65 (noting that, under section 107 of the 1976 Act,\n\n\n                                                          100\n\f       Whether Government Reproduction o f Copyrighted Materials is a Noninfringing “Fair Use'\n\n\n   In order to decide whether a particular government use of copyrighted materials\nwould, on the whole, “ promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts,” it is\nnecessary to take into account an “ ample view of the universe of relevant evi­\ndence.” Campbell, 510 U.S. at 575, 584. Similarly, in order to determine whether\nany other benefits to the broader public interest would sufficiently outweigh the\ncosts of any reduction in the incentives for creativity, it is necessary to engage\nin a comprehensive evaluation of all pertinent factors. We think that, in the par­\nticular context of government photocopying, the following specific considerations\n(each of which bears on the four enumerated statutory factors) might have a\nsignificant impact on the fair use calculus:\n   (a)   One important consideration that courts typically address under the first\nstatutory factor (“ the purpose and character of the use, including whether such\nuse is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes” ) is whether\nthe use in question is undertaken in order to increase the user’s profits. In most,\nif not all, cases, the purposes for which the government makes photocopies do\nnot include profitmaking or commercial exploitation. Although the nonprofit\nnature of the government’s use of photocopies would not be dispositive, see\nCampbell, 510 U.S. at 584, it certainly would be “ one element,” id., germane\nto the fair use question.25 The commercial/nonprofit distinction may be especially\nsignificant where, as in most cases of photocopying, the secondary use is not\n“ transformative” — i.e., where the copyrighted material is merely copied in its\noriginal form and is not transformed into another valuable product. See id. at 579\n(the more transformative the use, the less significant to the analysis will be the\nquestion of commercialism).26\n\n “ courts might regard as fair” the “ reproduction o f a [copynghted] work in legislative or judicial proceedings or\nreports” ), reprinted in 1976 U.S C.C.A N. at 5678-79; Senate Report at 61-62 (same). Harper & Row, 471 U.S.\nat 584-85 n.8 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (example of a judicial opinion quoting extensively from copynghted materials),\nSinai, 1992 WL 470699, at *3 (state Bureau o f Automotive Repairs used matenals for a “ public purpose” when\nit disseminated an auto emissions chart to field offices throughout the state so that those offices could assist smog\ncheck stations and consumers in complying with the state’s emission laws).\n    25 See also Harper & Row, 471 U.S at 562, Texaco, 60 F 3d at 921-22\n    26 Counsel for the CCC, citing Campbell, suggest that nontransformative uses “ are unlikely to be regarded as\nfair ones.” Weil, Gotshal Memo at 8 However, the Court in Campbell simply indicated that, because “ the goal\nof copynght, to promote science and the arts, is generally furthered by the creation of transformative works, . . .\n(sjuch works thus lie at the heart o f the fair use doctnne’s guarantee o f breathing space within the confines of\ncopyright, . . . and the more transformative the new work, the less will be the significance of other factors, like\ncommercialism, that may weigh against a finding o f fair u s e ” 510 U.S. at 579. The Court expressly cautioned\nthat such transformative use “ is not absolutely necessary for a finding o f fair use,” id., and in support of that\nproposition, the Court cited (i) a case (Sony Corp o f Am. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417 (1984))\nin which the Court found a nontransformative use to be noninfringing, and (n) the express indication in section\n 107 of the 1976 Act that reproduction o f multiple copies for classroom distnbution can be a fair use. Id at 579\n& n .ll, see also id. at 584—85 (eschewing fair use analysis that relies on a “ hard evidentiary presumption,” in\nlight of the need for a “ sensitive balancing” o f interests). It is important to note, as well, that the very first example\nthat section 107 provides of a use that can be “ fair” is “ reproduction in copies or phonorecords,” even though\nsuch “ reproduction” in most cases would not be “ transformative” in the sense the Court described in Campbell\nSee also House Report at 66 ( “ the reference [m 17 U.S C. §107] to fair use ‘by reproduction in copies or\nphonorecords or by any other m eans’ is mainly intended to make clear that the doctrine has as much application\nto photocopying and taping as to older forms o f use” ), reprinted in 1976 U.S C C A.N. at 5679.\n\n\n                                                           101\n\f                           Opinions o f the Office o f Legal Counsel in Volume 23\n\n\n   (b) Photocopying more likely will be deemed “ fair” where the photocopies\nare disseminated to a discrete and limited audience within the government. To\nthe extent that copies are sold, or distributed broadly, especially outside the\ngovernment, that likely would weigh against a finding of fair use. See Williams\n& Wilkins, 487 F.2d at 1353 & n.12, 1354—55. (This consideration likely would\nbe germane to the first ( “ purpose and character of the use” ) and fourth ( “ effect\nof the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work” ) statu­\ntory factors.)\n   (c) Copying that is done “ spontaneously],” for the purpose of facilitating an\nimmediate and discrete objective, is more likely to be a fair use than systematic\n“ archival” copying of extensive materials for possible future use. See Texaco,\n60 F.3d at 919-20. (This consideration, too, would bear on the first and fourth\nstatutory factors.) And, as the third statutory factor expressly indicates, “ the\namount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work\nas a whole’’ also is relevant to determining whether a use is fair.\n   (d) Copying materials for the purpose of collecting or studying certain facts\nor ideas contained therein — as opposed to the work’s original expression —\n increases the likelihood that the reproduction will be a fair use. In Feist Publ ’ns,\nInc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., 499 U.S. 340 (1991), the Court emphasized that,\nas a matter of constitutional law, “ facts are not copyrightable.” Id. at 344. All\nfacts — scientific, historical, biographical, and news of the day — ‘‘ ‘may not be\ncopyrighted and are part of the public domain available to every person.’ ” Id.\nat 348 (citation omitted); accord H arper & Row, 471 U.S. at 556 (“ No author\nmay copyright his ideas or the facts he narrates.” ). Furthermore, 17 U.S.C.\n§ 102(b) (1994) provides that “ [i]n no case does copyright protection for an\noriginal work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method\nof operation, concept, principle, or discovery.” The exclusion of facts and ideas\nfrom copyright protection, like the fair use doctrine, serves the goal of promoting\nthe progress of science and useful arts. See Campbell, 510 U.S. at 575 n.5.27\nAccordingly, copyright protection for a work containing facts or ideas “ is limited\nto those aspects of the work — termed ‘expression’ — that display the stamp of\nthe author’s originality.” H arper & Row, 471 U.S. at 547. Indeed, as the Court\nreemphasized in Campbell, “ ‘facts contained in existing works may be freely\ncopied.’ ” 510 U.S. at 575 n.5 (quoting Feist, 499 U.S. at 359).28 Thus, where\nthe government’s copying is limited to the bare facts contained in particular mate­\n\n   27 Moreover, the Copyright Act’s distinction between copyrightable expression and uncopynghtable facts and ideas\nis necessary in order to reconcile the restrictions o f the Act with the First Amendment. See Harper & Row, 471\nU.S. at 556, 560, see also New York Tim es Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713, 726 n.* (1971) (Brennan, J., concur­\nring), cited with approval in Harper &. Row, 471 U.S. at 556\n   28 Thus, for exam ple, the Court in H arper & Row implied that although direct quotations from President Ford’s\nbiography were subject to copynght protection, the histoncal facts contained in that biography were not entitled\nto such protection and could be freely copied. See 471 U.S at 565-66 & n.8 (applying copynght analysis only\nto “ verbatim quotes” from the biography, and excluding from infringement consideration historical quotations attnb-\nuted to third parties and to government documents)\n\n\n                                                        102\n\f      Whether Government Reproduction o f Copynghted Materials is a Noninfringing ‘ ‘Fair Use ’\n\n\nrials, and there is no copying of protected expression, there is no possibility o f\ncopyright infringement, and the fair-use question is inapposite.\n   Moreover, even if a document or book is entitled to some copyright protection,\nnevertheless, as a general matter “ fair use is more likely to be found in factual\nworks than in fictional works.” Stewart v. Abend, 495 U.S. 207, 237 (1990).\nAccordingly, even where the government copies materials that contain protected\n“ expression,” or factual compilations that arrange or select facts in a manner\nsufficiently original to trigger some limited, “ thin” copyright protection,29 the\nphotocopying more likely will be a fair use if the purpose of the copying is simply\nto obtain, collect, or study the facts and ideas contained in the materials. This\nwill be the case especially where, for purposes of photocopying, the facts and\nideas cannot readily be segregated from the protected expression, and where the\ngovernment’s copying of the protected expression therefore is merely incidental\nto its copying of unprotected facts and ideas.30\n   (e) The fourth factor that the statute expressly identifies as relevant to the fair-\nuse analysis is the “ effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of\nthe copyrighted work.” This factor requires courts “ to consider not only the extent\nof the market harm caused by the particular actions of the alleged infringer, but\nalso ‘whether unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by the\ndefendant . . . would result in a substantially adverse impact on the potential\nmarket’ for the original.” Campbell, 510 U.S. at 590 (quoting 3 Nimmer\n§ 13.05[A][4], at 13-102.61 (1993)). The importance of this factor “ will vary,\nnot only with the amount of harm, but also with the relative strength of the\nshowing on the other [fair-use] factors.” Id. at 590 n.21.\n\n    29“ [T]he copynght in a factual compilation is thin,” extending only to the selection or arrangement of the facts,\nif any, that is original or expressive Feist, 499 U S at 348 As the Court explained-\n       The mere fact that a work is copynghted does not mean that every element of the work may be protected\n       Originality remains the sine qua non of copyright, accordingly, copyright protection may extend only to\n       those components o f a work that are original to the author. . . Thus, if the compilation author clothes\n       facts with an onginal collocation o f words, he or she may be able to claim a copynght in this written\n       expression. Others may copy the underlying facts from the publication, but not the precise words used\n       to present them.\nId at 348-49\n   30 See. eg., Texaco, 60 F 3d at 925 & n .ll. National Rifle A s s ’n o f Am v Handgun Control Fed. o f Ohio, 15\nF 3d 559, 562 (6th Cir.), cert, denied, 513 U.S 815 (1994), Texaco, 802 F Supp at 15 (although such a fact-\ncentered justification for photocopying “ has some m erit,'’ and is “ ingenious,” it “ simply does not fit the facts\nof the case” ); see also, e g , Atari Games Corp , 975 F 2d at 843 ( “ When the nature of a work requires intermediate\ncopying to understand the ideas and processes in a copyrighted work, that nature supports a fair use for intermediate\ncopying Thus, reverse engineenng object code to discern the unprotectable ideas in a computer program is a fair\nu s e ” ); Sega Enters. Ltd. v. Accolade, In c , 977 F.2d 1510, 1524—26 (9th Cir. 1992). By analogy, in the context\nof publication (rather than mere reproduction) o f copynghted materials, the Supreme Court has indicated that it\nmay be permissible to copy protected expression verbatim where “ necessary adequately to convey the facts,” or\nwhere particular expression is “ so integral to the idea expressed as to be inseparable from it ” Harper & Row,\n471 U S at 563, see also Leval, Toward a Fair Use Standard, 103 Harv L Rev. at 1113-15. Perhaps the most\nfamous case of this sort is Time Inc v Bernard Geis A sso cs, 293 F. Supp. 130 (S D N Y 1968), in which the\ncourt held that it was fair use to depict frames from the copyrighted Zapruder film in a book about the Kennedy\nassassination, where there was “ a public interest in having the fullest information available on the murder of President\nKennedy,” and where such photographs made the author’s theory o f the assassination “ easier to understand,” id\nat 146.\n\n\n                                                        103\n\f                         Opinions o f the Office o f L egal Counsel in Volume 23\n\n\n    The most obvious way in which copying can have an adverse market effect\nis where it directly curtails demand for purchase of the original work, such as\nwhere an entity uses photocopying in lieu of additional subscriptions of the\noriginal work that it otherwise would purchase. See, e.g., Texaco , 60 F.3d at 927-\n29. Furthermore, with the advent of the CCC, it now can be argued that the failure\nto pay a licensing fee for the photocopying of materials covered by the CCC\nhas an adverse effect on another potential “ market” that was not present at the\ntime of W illiams & Wilkins — namely, the potential “ licensing fee” market. See,\ne.g., Princeton Univ. Press, 99 F.3d at 1387-88; Texaco, 60 F.3d at 929-31.\nBecause this sort of “ harm ” to a licensing fee “ market” could, by definition,\nexist whenever an entity refuses to provide the requested compensation for its\ncopies, what is significant is not the simple question of whether any such market\nharm exists, but rather, the magnitude and effect of the harm. “ Market harm is\na matter of degree.” Campbell, 510 U.S. at 590 n.21.31 Harm to this potential\n “ licensing fee” market, like other forms of market harm, should be germane to\nthe fair-use analysis only if, and to the extent that, such harm would deter “ ‘the\ncreation and publication of edifying matter.’ ” Id. at 578 n.10 (quoting Leval,\nToward a F air Use, 103 Harv. L. Rev. at 1134). If “ unrestricted and widespread\n[photocopying] o f the sort engaged in by the [government],” Campbell, 510 U.S.\nat 590 (internal quotation marks omitted) would not appreciably alter the incen­\ntives to create and disseminate the underlying works (and other “ edifying”\noriginal creations), the harm to the fee “ market” should have correspondingly\nlimited impact when evaluating this fair use factor.\n\n                                               Conclusion\n\n  There is no “ per se” rule that government reproduction of copyrighted mate­\nrial— including, in particular, government photocopying of copyrighted materials\nfor internal government use — automatically qualifies as a fair use under section\n107 of the Copyright Act of 1976. However, government photocopying would\nin many contexts be noninfringing because it would be a “ fair use” ; and there\nare good reasons that, if an agency decides to negotiate photocopying licensing\nagreements, it should seek to limit the scope of any such arrangement to cover\nonly those government photocopying practices that otherwise would, in fact, be\ninfringing.\n\n                                                                     RANDOLPH D.

(“ CCC” )\nto negotiate licenses with the Department of Commerce and other federal govern­\nment agencies, pursuant to which such agencies would, in exchange for a fee,\nobtain permission to reproduce certain copyrighted materials by photocopying.'\nSee Letter for Dawn E. Johnsen, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Office of\nLegal Counsel, from Andrew J. Pincus, General Counsel, Department of Com­\nmerce at 1 (June 23, 1998) (“ Pincus Letter” ). You inform us that a “ key factor\nin our decision whether such negotiations [with the CCC] even are appropriate\nis whether there are any circumstances under which the Copyright Act might\nrequire a government agency to obtain such a license: if a license is never nec­\nessary, there would be no reason to consider entering into negotiations with the\nCCC, or with individual authors of works.” Id. Accordingly, you have asked for\nour opinion on the following question: “ whether a government agency ever is\nrequired to secure either permission or licensing before making unauthorized\nreproduction and use of materials that are protected by copyright law, or whether\nall government reproduction and use of such materials per se qualifies for the\n‘fair use’ exception from the obligations of the Copyright Act.” Id. You further\nassert that “ [t]here appears to be substantial disagreement within the government\nwith-respect to this issue.” Id. In particular, you suggest that the Commercial\nLitigation Branch of the Department of Justice’s Civil Division may have con­\nveyed to certain agencies the view that “ virtually all photocopying for government\nuse is permitted under the fair use doctrine,” and that that view of the Commercial\n\n   ‘ The CCC, a nonprofit consortium, or “ clearing house,” established in 1977, acts as an agent for participating\npublishers. Under one of the CCC’s offered services, a user pays a flat fee, in exchange for which it receives a\nblanket annual license to make photocopies for internal use of any copyrighted material contained in any o f the\nworks registered with the CCC. The license fee is based on a limited photocopying survey that accounts for the\nlicense’s employee population and the copying fees for the journals regularly copied by that licensee Upon payment\nof the fee, the licensee is authorized for a specified term to make unlimited numbers of photocopies, for internal\nuse, from CCC-registered publications The revenue that the CCC derives from the licensee then is allocated among\nthe publishers that have registered publications with the CCC, with the CCC retaining certain service charges See\nAmerican Geophysical Union v.

We\ncaution, however, that a general practice of government agencies entering into\nlicensing agreements in which they pay licensing fees for uses that are fair may,\nover time, undermine the government’s ability to argue successfully that such uses\nare fair. For this and other reasons, government agencies may wish to ensure that,\nif they do negotiate licensing arrangements, such arrangements cover only those\ngovernment photocopying practices that otherwise would, in fact, be infringing.\n   In Part I of this opinion, we provide some background on the fair use doctrine.\nIn Part II, we review the case law regarding government photocopying and fair\nuse, as well as Congress’s enactment of the Copyright Act of 1976, and conclude\nthat government photocopying o f copyrighted materials does not invariably qualify\nas a fair use. Finally, in Part III, we provide some guidance on the factors that\nan agency should consider in determining whether a particular photocopying prac­\ntice would be a fair use and whether to negotiate a license with respect to par­\nticular photocopying practices.\n\n   2 In framing the particular question you have asked us to consider, you refer to “ unauthorized reproduction and\nuse o f materials that are protected by copyright law.” Pincus Letter at 1. The bulk o f your letter and supporting\nmaterials, however, indicates that your inquiry specifically concerns “ photocopying for government u s e ” Id at\n2 Accordingly, we will in this opinion focus, not on all potential federal government uses of copyrighted materials,\nbut instead, on government photocopying o f copyrighted materials for internal government use. We note, in particular,\nthat this opinion does not specifically consider the circumstances under which it would be a fair use for an agency\nto republish copyrighted materials in government publicauons or in publicly available databases.\n   3 Indeed, a Department o f Energy memorandum that you provided as an attachment to your letter indicates that\nthe Commercial Litigation Division of the Department o f Justice has informed the Department of Energy that, in\nits view, som e cases o f government photocopying likely would not be fair uses. See Memorandum for Jim Chafin\nand All Field Offices, from Paul A G ottlieb, Assistant G eneral Counsel for Technology Transfer and Intellectual\nProperty, U nited States Department of Energy, Re: Copyright Clearance Center at 2 (May 23,1995).\n\n\n                                                         88\n\f     Whether Government Reproduction o f Copyrighted Materials is a Noninfringing “Fair Use'\n\n\n                                  I. The Fair Use Doctrine\n\n   Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution empowers Congress to “ promote the\nProgress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors\nand Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.”\nU.S. Const, art. I, § 8, cl. 8. Pursuant to that power, Congress enacted the Copy­\nright Act of 1976, Pub. L. No. 94-553, 90 Stat. 2541 (1976) (codified as amended\nat 17 U.S.C. §101 et seq. (1994)) (the “ Copyright Act” or the “ 1976 Act” ).\nSection 106 of the Copyright Act provides, inter alia, that the owner of a copy­\nright under Title 17 of the United States Code “ has the exclusive rights . . .\nto reproduce the copyrighted work in copies,” and to “ authorize” such reproduc­\ntion. 17 U.S.C. § 106(1) (1994). Those “ exclusive rights,” however, are\n“ [sjubject to” limitations codified in “ sections 107 through 120” of the 1976\nAct. Id. § 106. For present purposes, the most important of those limitations is\nfound in section 107 of the Copyright Act, id. § 107. That section, which is entitled\n“ Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use,” provides, in pertinent part:\n\n        Notwithstanding the provisions of section[] 106 . . ., the fair use\n        of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies\n        . . ., for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting,\n        teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship,\n        or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining\n        whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair\n        use the factors to be considered shall include —\n\n        (1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such\n        use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational pur­\n        poses;\n\n        (2) the nature of the copyrighted work;\n\n        (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation\n        to the copyrighted work as a whole; and\n\n        (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value\n        of the copyrighted work.\n\n   Section 107’s “ fair use” limitation on copyright, and the particular factors\nenumerated in that section, reflect and incorporate a longstanding common law\ndoctrine.

Fair Use and Government Photocopying\n\n   The federal government can be liable for violation of the copyright laws. Con­\ngress has expressly provided that a work protected by the copyright laws can\nbe “ infringed by the United States,” 28 U.S.C. § 1498(b) (1994),6 and further\nhas provided that “ the exclusive action which may be brought for such infringe­\nment shall be an action by the copyright owner against the United States in the\nCourt of Federal Claims for the recovery of his reasonable and entire compensa­\ntion as damages for such infringement,” 28 U.S.C. § 1498(b) (Supp. Ill 1997).\nAt the same time, it cannot be disputed that the federal government’s copying\n(and other use) of copyrighted materials is subject to the fair use doctrine codified\nin 17 U.S.C. § 107.7 It follows that any federal government photocopying that\nis a fair use is not infringing. However, there is no basis for concluding that\nthe photocopying of copyrighted materials by the federal government automati­\ncally or invariably constitutes a fair use.\n   The case law provides very little guidance on the question of when government\nphotocopying is a fair use. Reported cases involving application of the fair use\ndoctrine to governmental conduct are rare. Indeed, the Williams & Wilkins deci­\nsion, to which your letter refers and which we discuss below, is one of the only\npublished opinions containing a significant discussion of governmental fair use.8\nAnd, outside the context of public schools, we have found only one case —\ninvolving circumstances far removed from those at issue in this opinion — in\nwhich a court has rejected a government’s assertion that its use of copyrighted\nmaterials was fair.9 What is more, even outside the context of governmental use,\n\n   6 See also H.R. Rep. No 86-624, at 2 (1959) (“ When the Government deliberately publishes a copyrighted article\nwithout obtaining the prior consent o f the copynght proprietor, the general assumption would be lhat the holder,\npursuant to the pnnciples o f ‘just compensation’ under the fifth amendment of our Constitution, should be entitled\nto an action against the Government for infringement ” )\n   7 There is nothing in the statute to suggest that the federal government cannot invoke the fair use doctnne. The\n legislative history indicates lhat cenain governmental uses can be fair. See infra notes 19, 24 And the courts uni­\nformly have assumed that the fair use analysis provided in section 107 o f the Act applies to government uses of\ncopynghted matenals See, e.g., the cases cited in note 8, infra\n   8 A few other cases contain less extensive discussion o f governmental fair use.

See, e.g., Senate Report at 71. And, in the 1976\nAct, Congress did take three steps with respect to the matter of photocopying.\nFirst, in section 106 of the Act, Congress expressly affirmed that the rights of\na copyright owner include the rights “ to reproduce the copyrighted work in\ncopies” and to “ authorize” such reproduction. 17 U.S.C. §106(1) (1994).11\nSecond, the text of section 107 of the Act — in which Congress for the first time\nformally codified the fair use doctrine — expressly provides that “ reproduction\nin copies . . . for purposes such as . . . news reporting, teaching . . ., scholar­\nship, or research,” can be “ the fair use of a copyrighted work.” Finally, in section\n 108 of the Act, Congress provided that certain forms of library and archival\nphotocopying are not infringing, see 17 U.S.C.A. § 108 (West 1996 & Supp.\n 1999), thereby creating a discrete carve-out, or safe harbor, that does not “ in\nany way affect[] the right o f fair use as provided by section 107,” 17 U.S.C.\n§ 108(f)(4) (1994). However, Congress did not otherwise resolve the fair use ques­\ntions raised in Williams <£ Wilkins, and, in particular, did not identify the cir­\ncumstances under which photocopying — and government photocopying in par­\nticular— would, or would not, constitute fair use under section 107 of the 1976\nA ct.12 Instead, as explained above, Congress simply enacted 17 U.S.C. §107 in\n   11 As the court in Williams & Wilkins indicated, see 487 F.2d at 1350-51, 1359, there had been some question\nwhether, under the then-existing copynght laws, the exclusive nghts of the copyright owner included the right to\ncontrol the copying o f books and penodicals for personal use. See also B nef for the United States at 16 n26,\nWilliams & Wilkins Co. v. United States, 420 U.S 376 (1975) (No 73-1279) (discussing this question).\n    12 In a memorandum attached to your letter, counsel for the CCC argue that section 108 of the 1976 Act “ expressly\nproscnbes the copymg at issue in W illiams & Wilkins,” and that congressional enactment of section 108 “ signalled\nC ongressional disapproval o f [Williams & Wilkins] on fair use grounds, and instead indicated that the photocopying\nactivities in question should be covered by a separate statutory provision, namely Section 108.” Memorandum of\nW eil, Gotshal & M anges LLP, Re* Government Photocopying as Copyright Infringement at 22-23 (July 30, 1997)\n(“ Weil, Gotshal M em o” ).

The Wil­\nliams & Wilkins court, after discussing at length the eight different considerations,\nor “ elements,” that contributed to its decision, 487 F.2d at 1353-62, emphasized\nthat its holding (that the library copying practices at issue were noninfringing)\n\n     This is incorrect, because section 108 of the 1976 Act does not narrow the protection for fair use provided by\n the common-law doctnne codified in section 107 Section 108(a) o f the Act, 17 U.S.C A § 108(a) (West 1996 &\n Supp 1999), provides that, under certain conditions, it is “ not an infringement of copynght for a library or archives\n      . to reproduce no more than one copy or phonorecord o f a work, or to distribute such copy or phonorecord,”\n  “ [notw ithstanding the provisions o f section 106.” Section 108(g)(2), in turn, states that “ (t]he rights of reproduction\n and distnbution under this section . . . do not extend” to certain cases involving the “ systematic reproduction\n or distribution of single or multiple copies.” (Emphasis added) Section 108(g)(2) does not “ expressly proscnbe[]”\n the copying practices at issue in Williams & Wilkins — indeed, nothing in section 108 “ proscnbes” any practice\n at all. Nor is there anything in section 108 suggesting that “ systematic” reproduction is “ lawful only via the [section\n 108(g)(2)] proviso, [and] could not be a fair use ” United States Copynght Office, Report o f the Register o f Copy­\n rights' Library Reproduction o f Copyrighted Works (17 U.S.C. 108), at 98 (1983) ( “ 1983 Register Report” ) At\n most, section 108(g)(2) merely provides that the “ n ghts” to copy and distribute that are provided “ under” section\n  108 “ do not extend to” the “ systematic” practices descnbed in section 108(g)(2) To be sure, “ section 108 author­\n izes certain photocopying practices which may not qualify as a fair use,” House Report at 74 (emphasis added),\n reprinted in 1976 U.S C.C.A N. at 5688, see also Senate Report at 67 However, the statute does not provide, or\n even suggest, that the circumstances under which copying is noninfringing under section 108(a) are those “ lhat\n would typically not amount to fair use [under section 107],” White Paper at 84-85 (emphasis added), nor that\n “ Section 108 was enacted to make lawful some types o f copying which would otherwise be infringements o f copy­\n right, fair use notwithstanding,” 1983 Register Report at 96 (emphasis added) Indeed, by its express terms, nothing\n in section 108 “ in any way affects the nght of fair use as provided by section 107.” 17 U.S.C § 108(f)(4) (1994);\nsee uiso House Report at 74 ( “ No provision of section 108 is intended to lake away any nghts existing under\n the fair use doctrine.” ), reprinted in 1976 U .S C C .A N at 5687-88, Senate Report at 67 (same); 122 Cong. Rec.\n 3836 (1976) (statement o f Sen Magnuson) ( “ the Judiciary Committee clearly sel out in iheir report                that the\n fair use doctrine not only applies to reproduction practices of libraries, but that in no way did they intend section\n 108 to be a limitation upon the fair use doctnne” ).\n    Accordingly, whether section 108 renders certain copying practices “ not an infringement” does not affect w hether\nsuch practices are noninfringing fair uses under section 107 See Texaco, 802 F. Supp. at 28 & n 26 (emphasizing\nthat “ Section 108 is a separate special statutory exemption governed by an entirely different set of standards [than\nunder section 107],” and rejecting the argument “ that the understanding o f Section 107 should be influenced by\nwhat is permitted under Section 108” ); accord 4 Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright\n§ 13.05[E][2], at 13-240 (1998) A certain copying practice can be “ noninfnnging” under section 107, under section\n 108, under both provisions, or under neither. In ils 1983 Report, the Register of Copyrights suggested that such\na construction o f the statute, in which practices permissible under section 108 might also be permissible under section\n 107, would “ render §108 superfluous.” 1983 Register Report at 96 n.4 That is not the case, however. As the\nRegister noted, “ the library community sought § 108 to permit copying that had not been spelled out in the proposed\nfair use provision ” Id. (emphasis added). Section 108 identifies (“ spell[s] out” ) as noninfnnging a category of\nlibrary photocopying that may, or may not, constitute fair use Section 108 thus fairly can be viewed as a very\nvaluable— and not superfluous— safe harbor: If a certain library practice is noninfringing under the specific and\ndetailed provisions of section 108(a) (as confined by section 108(g)(2)), a library need not be concerned about how\nthat particular photocopying practice would fare under section 107’s more complex and indeterminate fair use stand­\nards.\n    13 Section 1498(b) o f title 28 provides that “ the exclusive action which may be brought for mfnngement [by\nthe federal government] shall be an action by the copynght owner against the United States in the Court of Federal\nClaims ” 28 U.S.C § 1498(b) (Supp. Ill 1997). Decisions o f lhat court are appealable to the United States Court\no f Appeals for the Federal Circuit, see 28 U S C § 1295(a)(3) (1994), which in turn considers itself bound by\ndecisions (such as Williams & Wilkins) that the former Court of Claims issued pnor to October 1982. See South\nCorp v. United States, 690 F 2d 1368, 1370 & n.2 (Fed Cir 1982); see also, e.g., Gargoyles, Inc. v. United States,\n113 F 3d 1572, 1576 (Fed C ir 1997).\n\n\n                                                           95\n\f                            Opinions o f the Office o f Legal Counsel in Volume 23\n\n\nwas based upon all of the elements present in that case, and that its decision\nwould not necessarily resolve different cases “ with other significant variables,”\nid. at 1362. The court expressly noted that it was not determining whether any\nof the particular elements in the Williams & Wilkins case would be sufficient\nfor a finding of fair use, nor whether all of the relevant elements cumulatively\nwere “ essential” to the finding o f fair use: It sufficed for the court simply to\ndecide that “ at least when all co-exist in combination a ‘fair use’ is made out.”\nId.\\ see also id. ( “ we feel a strong need to obey the canon of judicial parsimony,\nbeing stingy rather than expansive in the reach of our holding” ).14 Implicitly,\nthen, the decision in Williams & Wilkins itself suggests that there may be some\ncircumstances under which government photocopying might be infringing.

Rep.\nNo 86-624, at 5 (1959)) In the cited House Report, a House Committee indicated that the federal government\ncould infringe a copyright when it “ publishes” an article without permission See supra note 6. The Committee\ndid not indicate what it meant by “ publishes,” and did not expressly mention photocopying At the page of the\nH ouse Report (page 5) that the Solicitor General cited, however, a letter wntten by the Department of Commerce\nassumes that government photocopying could be infringing. See also id. at 8 (reflecting a similar assumption conveyed\nby the Librarian o f Congress) There is no suggestion in the House Report that the House Committee disagreed\nw ith this assumption.\n\n\n                                                            96\n\f       Whether Government Reproduction o f Copyrighted Materials is a Noninfringing “Fair Use ’\n\n\nconditions of such agreements should be. In answering that question, there is an\n inescapable tension. On the one hand, because of the highly fact-bound nature\nof the fair use inquiry, it is difficult to ascertain in advance which governmental\npractices will, or will not, be fair uses: There is an “ endless variety of situations\nand combinations of circumstances that can rise in particular cases.” House Report\nat 66, reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5680. Such uncertainty, when viewed\nin isolation, might weigh in favor of entering into relatively broad licensing agree­\nments, so as to ensure that an agency’s photocopying will never be infringing.\nOn the other hand, and in addition to the desire to avoid unnecessary costs, there\nis an important legal consideration that counsels against entering into unnecessary\nlicensing agreements and in favor of limiting such agreements to encompass only\nthose photocopying practices that are infringing — namely, the concern that gen­\neral custom and usage may be integral to the fair use analysis.16 Indeed, at least\none court has opined, in particular, that whether it is “ fair,” under the copyright\nlaw, to engage in a photocopying practice without compensation may depend,\nin part, on whether similarly situated entities customarily agree to pay a fee to\nthe copyright holders.17 We have no occasion here to consider whether that court\nwas correct in this regard; but it is possible that other courts may follow suit.\nAccordingly, if government agencies routinely agree to pay licensing fees to\nengage in photocopying practices that were fair uses at the time, there is a chance\nsome courts may conclude that a growing or longstanding custom o f paying such\nfees weighs against a finding that such photocopying practices are fair uses when\nunlicensed. Thus, an agency that decides to negotiate a photocopying license\nshould seek to limit the scope of the licensing agreement so as not to cover those\nphotocopying practices that the agency, in good faith, concludes are not infringing.\n   In the end, each agency must do its best to evaluate whether any o f its\nphotocopying practices are infringing, and, if so, to obtain proper authorization\nfor such uses of copyrighted materials. Although, as we have explained, there\nmay be many government photocopying practices that are fair uses (or that are,\nfor other reasons, not infringing), under some circumstances government\nphotocopying may not be a fair use.

And, while in some cases it might be fairly\neasy for an agency to determine that a government practice is noninfringing,19\nusually that will not be the case: Whether a particular government photocopying\npractice is a fair use often will depend upon a “ ‘sensitive balancing of\n\n   18 M oreover, the subsequent advent of the CCC, and the possibility of reasonable licensing agreements with that\norganization, may affect at least one of the factors that led the Court of Claims to rule against the copyright holder\nin Williams & Wilkins.

See 487 F.2d at 1356-57 But insofar as such libraries now could\navoid a finding o f fair use by agreeing to pay a reasonable and affordable licensing fee — that is, a fee that would\nnot materially deter the actual making and use o f valuable photocopies — the harm that the Williams & Wilkins\ncourt foresaw could be diminished See Texaco, 60 F 3d at 924 (“ To the extent the copying practice was ‘reasonable’\nin 1973 [when Williams & Wilkins was decided], it has ceased to be ‘reasonable’ as the reasons that justified it\nbefore [photocopying licensing] have ceased to exist ’) (quoting the district court opinion, 802 F.

Nor are those factors exhaustive. See H arper & Row,\n471 U.S. at 560; H.R. Rep. No. 102-836, at 9-10 (1992), reprinted in 1992\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 2553, 2561-62.20 Most importantly, it is critical that the statutory\nfactors, as well as all other pertinent factors and considerations, “ be explored,\nand the results weighed together, in light o f the purposes o f copyright.\" Campbell,\n510 U.S. at 578 (emphasis added); see also id. at 581 (the fair use inquiry requires\nthat any particular use of copyrighted material “ be judged, case by case, in light\nof the ends of the copyright law” ).21 Accordingly, before turning to particular\nfactors and considerations that agencies should consider in the context of govern­\nment photocopying, it is important once again to identify the “ purposes of copy­\nright.”\n   Copyright law “ ultimately serves the purpose of enriching the general public\nthrough access to creative works.” Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., 510 U.S. 517-18,\n527 (1994); see also H arper <£ Row, 471 U.S. at 545 (“ copyright is intended\nto increase and not to impede the harvest of knowledge” ). Thus, in determining\nwhether a particular photocopying practice is a fair use, the ultimate question to\nbe answered is whether permitting the government to continue to engage in the\npractice without paying a licensing fee would “ serve[] the copyright objective\n\n   20 Section 107 expressly provides that “ the factors to be considered shall include” the four enumerated factors\n(emphasis added), and the 1976 Act elsewhere provides that the term “ including” is “ illustrative and not limitative,”\n17 U S.C. § 101 (1994)\n   21 See also 4 Melville B.

Weinreb, F a ir’s Fair: A Comment on the Fair Use Doctrine, 103 Harv. L.\nRev. 1137, 1144 (1990). For example, the Supreme Court in the Sony case held\nthat consumer videotaping of television broadcasts for purposes of “ time-shifting”\nwas a fair use, in part because such a practice “ yields societal benefits.” 464\nU.S. at 454. Elaborating on this point, the Court cited the example of using a\nvideotaping machine “ to enable a [hospital] patient to see programs he would\notherwise miss,” which, as the Court explained, “ has no productive purpose other\nthan contributing to the psychological well-being of the patient.” Id. at 455 n.40.\nO f greater pertinence to the subject matter at hand — namely, government\ncopying — the Court further suggested that “ a legislator who copies for the sake\no f broadening her understanding o f what her constituents are watching; or a con­\nstituent who copies a news program to help make a decision on how to vote,”\nare examples of uses that could be “ fair.” Id.\n   Thus, it fairly can be argued that, as a general matter, “ courts are more willing\nto find a secondary use fair when it produces a value that benefits the broader\npublic interest,” Texaco, 60 F.3d at 922, in contrast with a use that “ can fairly\nbe characterized as a form o f ‘commercial exploitation,’ i.e., when the copier\ndirectly and exclusively acquires conspicuous financial rewards from its use of\nthe copyrighted material,” id .23 For instance, the federal government typically\nphotocopies materials in order to facilitate some other, “ secondary” use of such\nmaterials, and such secondary use generally is aimed at providing a public benefit,\nor at serving a “ broad[] public purpose.” Id. Insofar as an agency’s photocopying\nis intended to facilitate such public purposes, that should weigh in favor of a\nfinding of fair use.24 See a lso infra p. 101 (discussing whether purpose of the\nphotocopying is to enhance profitmaking).\n\n   22 See also, e.g., Atari Games Corp. v Nintendo o f Am., Inc., 975 F 2 d 832, 843 (Fed. Cir 1992) (where, m\n“ reverse engineering” o f computer softw are, “ intermediate” copying permitted the user to study that software and\nthereafter design new video game program s, the resultant “ growth in creative expression” weighed in favor of\nfinding that the copying was a fair use).\n   23See also, e g ., N im m er, § 13.05[B][4], at 13-205 ( “ The public interest is also a factor that continually informs\nthe fair use analysis ” ) (footnote omitted).\n   24 See, e.g., Williams & Wilkins, 487 F 2 d at 1353 ( “ W e cannot believe, for instance, that a judge who makes\nand gives to a colleague a photocopy o f a law review article, m one o f the smaller or less available journals, which\nbears directly on a problem both ju d g es are then considering in a case before them is infringing the copynght,\nrather than making ‘fair use’ of his issue o f that journal.” ), Key Maps, I n c , 470 F. Supp at 38 (county fire marshal’s\ndistribution o f copies o f copynghted m aps to 50 fire departments, law enforcement agencies, and civil defense units\nin the county was “ legitimate, fair, and reasonable,” since the copies were disseminated “ solely for internal purposes\nwhich related to a discemable public interest,” namely, “ the coordination of fire prevention activities in the unincor­\nporated areas o f [the] county” ), see also House Report at 65 (noting that, under section 107 of the 1976 Act,\n\n\n                                                          100\n\f       Whether Government Reproduction o f Copyrighted Materials is a Noninfringing “Fair Use'\n\n\n   In order to decide whether a particular government use of copyrighted materials\nwould, on the whole, “ promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts,” it is\nnecessary to take into account an “ ample view of the universe of relevant evi­\ndence.” Campbell, 510 U.S. at 575, 584. Similarly, in order to determine whether\nany other benefits to the broader public interest would sufficiently outweigh the\ncosts of any reduction in the incentives for creativity, it is necessary to engage\nin a comprehensive evaluation of all pertinent factors. We think that, in the par­\nticular context of government photocopying, the following specific considerations\n(each of which bears on the four enumerated statutory factors) might have a\nsignificant impact on the fair use calculus:\n   (a)   One important consideration that courts typically address under the first\nstatutory factor (“ the purpose and character of the use, including whether such\nuse is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes” ) is whether\nthe use in question is undertaken in order to increase the user’s profits. In most,\nif not all, cases, the purposes for which the government makes photocopies do\nnot include profitmaking or commercial exploitation. Although the nonprofit\nnature of the government’s use of photocopies would not be dispositive, see\nCampbell, 510 U.S. at 584, it certainly would be “ one element,” id., germane\nto the fair use question.25 The commercial/nonprofit distinction may be especially\nsignificant where, as in most cases of photocopying, the secondary use is not\n“ transformative” — i.e., where the copyrighted material is merely copied in its\noriginal form and is not transformed into another valuable product. See id. at 579\n(the more transformative the use, the less significant to the analysis will be the\nquestion of commercialism).26\n\n “ courts might regard as fair” the “ reproduction o f a [copynghted] work in legislative or judicial proceedings or\nreports” ), reprinted in 1976 U.S C.C.A N. at 5678-79; Senate Report at 61-62 (same).

The Court expressly cautioned\nthat such transformative use “ is not absolutely necessary for a finding o f fair use,” id., and in support of that\nproposition, the Court cited (i) a case (Sony Corp o f Am. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111062\"><a href=\"/opinion/111062/sony-corp-of-america-v-universal-city-studios-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">417</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984))\nin which the Court found a nontransformative use to be noninfringing, and (n) the express indication in section\n 107 of the 1976 Act that reproduction o f multiple copies for classroom distnbution can be a fair use. Id at 579\n& n .ll, see also id. at 584—85 (eschewing fair use analysis that relies on a “ hard evidentiary presumption,” in\nlight of the need for a “ sensitive balancing” o f interests). It is important to note, as well, that the very first example\nthat section 107 provides of a use that can be “ fair” is “ reproduction in copies or phonorecords,” even though\nsuch “ reproduction” in most cases would not be “ transformative” in the sense the Court described in Campbell\nSee also House Report at 66 ( “ the reference [m 17 U.S C. §107] to fair use ‘by reproduction in copies or\nphonorecords or by any other m eans’ is mainly intended to make clear that the doctrine has as much application\nto photocopying and taping as to older forms o f use” ), reprinted in 1976 U.S C C A.N. at 5679.\n\n\n                                                           101\n\f                           Opinions o f the Office o f Legal Counsel in Volume 23\n\n\n   (b) Photocopying more likely will be deemed “ fair” where the photocopies\nare disseminated to a discrete and limited audience within the government. To\nthe extent that copies are sold, or distributed broadly, especially outside the\ngovernment, that likely would weigh against a finding of fair use. See Williams\n& Wilkins, 487 F.2d at 1353 & n.12, 1354—55. (This consideration likely would\nbe germane to the first ( “ purpose and character of the use” ) and fourth ( “ effect\nof the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work” ) statu­\ntory factors.)\n   (c) Copying that is done “ spontaneously],” for the purpose of facilitating an\nimmediate and discrete objective, is more likely to be a fair use than systematic\n“ archival” copying of extensive materials for possible future use. See Texaco,\n60 F.3d at 919-20. (This consideration, too, would bear on the first and fourth\nstatutory factors.) And, as the third statutory factor expressly indicates, “ the\namount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work\nas a whole’’ also is relevant to determining whether a use is fair.\n   (d) Copying materials for the purpose of collecting or studying certain facts\nor ideas contained therein — as opposed to the work’s original expression —\n increases the likelihood that the reproduction will be a fair use.

See Campbell, 510 U.S. at 575 n.5.27\nAccordingly, copyright protection for a work containing facts or ideas “ is limited\nto those aspects of the work — termed ‘expression’ — that display the stamp of\nthe author’s originality.” H arper & Row, 471 U.S. at 547.

This\nwill be the case especially where, for purposes of photocopying, the facts and\nideas cannot readily be segregated from the protected expression, and where the\ngovernment’s copying of the protected expression therefore is merely incidental\nto its copying of unprotected facts and ideas.30\n   (e) The fourth factor that the statute expressly identifies as relevant to the fair-\nuse analysis is the “ effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of\nthe copyrighted work.” This factor requires courts “ to consider not only the extent\nof the market harm caused by the particular actions of the alleged infringer, but\nalso ‘whether unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by the\ndefendant . . . would result in a substantially adverse impact on the potential\nmarket’ for the original.” Campbell, 510 U.S. at 590 (quoting 3 Nimmer\n§ 13.05[A][4], at 13-102.61 (1993)). The importance of this factor “ will vary,\nnot only with the amount of harm, but also with the relative strength of the\nshowing on the other [fair-use] factors.” Id. at 590 n.21.\n\n    29“ [T]he copynght in a factual compilation is thin,” extending only to the selection or arrangement of the facts,\nif any, that is original or expressive Feist, 499 U S at 348 As the Court explained-\n       The mere fact that a work is copynghted does not mean that every element of the work may be protected\n       Originality remains the sine qua non of copyright, accordingly, copyright protection may extend only to\n       those components o f a work that are original to the author. . .

See, e.g., Texaco , 60 F.3d at 927-\n29. Furthermore, with the advent of the CCC, it now can be argued that the failure\nto pay a licensing fee for the photocopying of materials covered by the CCC\nhas an adverse effect on another potential “ market” that was not present at the\ntime of W illiams & Wilkins — namely, the potential “ licensing fee” market. See,\ne.g., Princeton Univ. Press, 99 F.3d at 1387-88; Texaco, 60 F.3d at 929-31.\nBecause this sort of “ harm ” to a licensing fee “ market” could, by definition,\nexist whenever an entity refuses to provide the requested compensation for its\ncopies, what is significant is not the simple question of whether any such market\nharm exists, but rather, the magnitude and effect of the harm. “ Market harm is\na matter of degree.” Campbell, 510 U.S. at 590 n.21.31 Harm to this potential\n “ licensing fee” market, like other forms of market harm, should be germane to\nthe fair-use analysis only if, and to the extent that, such harm would deter “ ‘the\ncreation and publication of edifying matter.’ ” Id. at 578 n.10 (quoting Leval,\nToward a F air Use, 103 Harv. L. Rev. at 1134). If “ unrestricted and widespread\n[photocopying] o f the sort engaged in by the [government],” Campbell, 510 U.S.\nat 590 (internal quotation marks omitted) would not appreciably alter the incen­\ntives to create and disseminate the underlying works (and other “ edifying”\noriginal creations), the harm to the fee “ market” should have correspondingly\nlimited impact when evaluating this fair use factor.\n\n                                               Conclusion\n\n  There is no “ per se” rule that government reproduction of copyrighted mate­\nrial— including, in particular, government photocopying of copyrighted materials\nfor internal government use — automatically qualifies as a fair use under section\n107 of the Copyright Act of 1976. However, government photocopying would\nin many contexts be noninfringing because it would be a “ fair use” ; and there\nare good reasons that, if an agency decides to negotiate photocopying licensing\nagreements, it should seek to limit the scope of any such arrangement to cover\nonly those government photocopying practices that otherwise would, in fact, be\ninfringing.\n\n                                                                     RANDOLPH D. MOSS\n                                                              Acting Assistant Attorney General\n                                                                   Office o f Legal Counsel\n\n 31 See also W illiam W Fisher III, Reconstructing the Fair Use D octnne, 101 Harv L. Rev 1659, 1671-72 (1988).\n\n\n                                                     104\n\f</pre>",
