Johnsen and Judge Patricia K. Norris joined.\n\n\nK E S S L E R, Presiding Judge:\n\n¶1              Plaintiffs/Appellants (collectively “the Seldins”)1 appeal\nfrom the superior court’s order dismissing their claims against Appellee\nArizona Public Safety Personnel Retirement System (“PSPRS”). We affirm\nbecause PSPRS is a state agency for purposes of the notice of claim statute,\nand the Seldins admittedly failed to provide PSPRS with a notice of claim\nor to file suit within the one-year statute of limitations period applicable to\nclaims against public entities.\n\n               FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n¶2            In September 2011, the Seldins sued PSPRS, alleging, among\nother things, aiding and abetting fraud and aiding and abetting breach of\nfiduciary duty. The claims arose out of a real estate investment gone\nawry, the specifics of which are not relevant to this appeal. PSPRS moved\nto dismiss the claims against it under Arizona Rule of Civil Procedure\n12(b)(6), arguing that it is a state agency covered by Arizona’s notice of\nclaim statute, Arizona Revised Statutes (“A.R.S.”) section 12-821.01 (Supp.\n2013),2 and the one-year statute of limitations applicable to claims against\npublic entities, A.R.S. § 12-821 (2003). The Seldins admittedly did not\nprovide PSPRS with a notice of claim, nor did they file the lawsuit within\nthe one-year limitations period. Instead, the Seldins argued that PSPRS is\nnot a state agency and, therefore, neither the notice of claim statute nor the\none-year limitations period applied.\n\n¶3           The superior court granted PSPRS’s motion to dismiss,\nconcluding that PSPRS is a state agency covered by the notice of claim\nstatute and the one-year statute of limitations. The Seldins timely\n\n\n1 Plaintiffs/Appellants included Millard R. Seldin, Scott A. Seldin, and\nnumerous Seldin-controlled entities, including Pivotal Colorado II, L.L.C.\n2 We cite the most recent versions of statutes when no revisions material\n\nto this decision have since occurred.\n\n\n\n                                      2\n\f                         PIVOTAL et al. v. PSPRS\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nappealed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. § 12-2101(A)(1) (Supp.\n2013).\n\n                               DISCUSSION\n\n¶4             We review the superior court’s grant of a motion to dismiss\nfor failure to state a claim de novo. See N. Peak Constr., LLC v. Architecture\nPlus, Ltd., 227 Ariz. 165, 167, ¶ 13, 254 P.3d 404, 406 (App. 2011). The sole\nissue on review is whether PSPRS is a state agency for purposes of the\nnotice of claim statute and the one-year statute of limitations applicable to\npublic entities. We conclude that it is.\n\nI.     Notice of Claim and Limitations Statutes\n\n¶5             “Persons who have claims against a public entity . . . shall\nfile claims with the person or persons authorized to accept service for the\npublic entity . . . within one hundred eighty days after the cause of action\naccrues.” A.R.S. § 12-821.01(A). The claim must include facts sufficient to\nallow the public entity to understand and assess liability. Id. “Any claim\nthat is not filed within one hundred eighty days after the cause of action\naccrues is barred . . . .” Id. The claim statute assists the government from\nincurring “excess or unwarranted liability and facilitates settlement of\nclaims by allowing the government to investigate the claim . . . and budget\nfor settlement or payment of large claims.” Yollin v. City of Glendale, 219\nAriz. 24, 29, ¶ 11, 191 P.3d 1040, 1045 (App. 2008). Additionally, “[a]ll\nactions against any public entity . . . shall be brought within one year\nafter the cause of action accrues . . . .” A.R.S. § 12-821.\n\n¶6            A public entity “includes this state and any political\nsubdivision of this state.” A.R.S. § 12-820(7) (Supp. 2013).3 “’State’ means\nthis state and any state agency, board, commission or department.” A.R.S.\n§ 12-820(8) (emphasis added). Thus, the notice of claim statute and the\naccompanying limitations period apply to PSPRS if it is a state agency,\nboard, commission or department.\n\n\n\n\n3 We note that the statute does not restrict the definition of “public entity”\nto the state or a political subdivision. The word “includes” suggests that\nother organizational forms could be considered public entities for notice\nof claim purposes. PSPRS, however, does not raise any argument in this\nregard.\n\n\n\n                                      3\n\f                          PIVOTAL et al. v. PSPRS\n                            Opinion of the Court\n\nII.    PSPRS Is a State Agency\n\n¶7            PSPRS “is the state agency responsible for administering the\npensions of Arizona’s police and fire fighters.” McClead v. Pima Cnty., 174\nAriz. 348, 353, 849 P.2d 1378, 1383 (App. 1992). Before July 1968, public\nsafety employees “were covered under various local, municipal and state\nretirement programs.” A.R.S. § 38-841(A)-(B) (2011). Consequently,\nbenefits paid to different groups of public safety employees varied widely.\nId. Our Legislature created PSPRS “[i]n order to provide a uniform,\nconsistent and equitable statewide program for public safety personnel\nwho are regularly assigned hazardous duty . . . .” A.R.S. § 38-841(B).\n\n¶8           PSPRS is managed by a board of trustees (“PSPRS’s board”),\nwhose members are appointed by the Governor with the consent of the\nSenate through the statutory procedures for appointment of state officers.\nA.R.S. §§ 38-848(A) (2011), -211(A) (2011). PSPRS’s board invests and\nmanages PSPRS’s assets, A.R.S. § 38-848(D), which are derived exclusively\nfrom deductions from the salaries of public safety employees and\ncontributions by their employers, A.R.S. § 38-843 (Supp. 2013).\n\n¶9            This Court previously concluded that PSPRS is a state\nagency based on the fact that it was created by the Legislature, its board is\nappointed by the Governor, it manages pension funds for state and local\npublic safety employees, the Arizona Attorney General serves as its\ncounsel, and it is subject to state agency sunset laws. See Fund Manager,\nPub. Safety Pers. Ret. Sys. v. Ariz. Dep’t of Admin., 151 Ariz. 93, 95, 725 P.2d\n1127, 1129 (App. 1986) (hereinafter “ADOA”) (“[W]e conclude that the\nFund Manager [the title formerly used for PSPRS’s board] is a state\nagency.”); Fund Manager, Pub. Safety Pers. Ret. Sys. v. Cnty. of Maricopa, 152\nAriz. 255, 259, 731 P.2d 620, 624 (App. 1986) (hereinafter “Fund Manager”)\n(“The trial court correctly held that the fund manager is a state agency.”);\nsee also McClead, 174 Ariz. at 353, 849 P.2d at 1383.\n\n¶10           The thrust of the Seldins’ argument is that subsequent\nlegislative amendments to A.R.S. § 38-848—PSPRS’s enabling legislation—\neffectively overruled our prior decisions, necessitating a reevaluation of\nPSPRS’s status as a state agency, and that PSPRS cannot be a state agency\nbecause its assets are not derived from the State’s general revenues. We\nconclude otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n                                       4\n\f                          PIVOTAL et al. v. PSPRS\n                            Opinion of the Court\n\n       A.     ADOA, Fund Manager, and the 1987 Amendment to A.R.S. §\n              38-848\n\n¶11            In ADOA, we concluded that PSPRS’s board was subject to\nthe salary recommendations of the Arizona Department of\nAdministration’s Personnel Board (“Personnel Board”). 151 Ariz. at 95-96,\n725 P.2d at 1129-30. The Personnel Board “annually recommends a salary\nrange for [state] agency heads and certain other [state] employees” that\ngoverns the salaries that can be paid to those individuals. Id. at 94, 725\nP.2d at 1128; see A.R.S. §§ 41-743(B)(4) (2013), -751(B)(4) (2013). At the\ntime, PSPRS’s enabling legislation stated that “[t]he administrator and\nother employees hired by [PSPRS’s board] are not under the jurisdiction of\nthe state personnel board or subject to title 41, chapter 4, articles 5 and 6.”\nA.R.S. § 38-848(J)(6) (1985); see also ADOA, 151 Ariz. at 94, 725 P.2d at 1128.\nPSPRS argued that its exemption from the jurisdiction of the Personnel\nBoard also exempted it from the salary recommendations. ADOA, 151\nAriz. at 94, 725 P.2d at 1128.\n\n¶12              A.R.S. § 38-611 (2011)4 gave the Personnel Board the\nauthority to make salary recommendations for state agencies otherwise\nexempt from the state personnel system. Id. PSPRS argued that A.R.S. §\n38-611 was inapplicable because PSPRS is not a state agency. Id. at 95, 725\nP.2d at 1129. We rejected PSPRS’s argument and concluded that it is a\nstate agency based upon how it was created, who appointed its members,\nits duties, its legal counsel, and it being subject to sunset laws:\n\n       [PSPRS’s board] consists of . . . individuals appointed by the\n       Governor. The appointment is made pursuant to A.R.S. §\n       38-211 which pertains to the appointment of state officers.\n       [Its] purpose is to manage monies in the Public Safety\n       Personnel Retirement System fund consisting of deductions\n       taken from the salaries of public safety personnel and\n       contributions by their employers. The Attorney General,\n       being the ‘chief legal officer’ of the state is a legal\n       representative of [PSPRS’s board]. Further, [PSPRS’s board\n       is subject to] the Sunset Review Laws, which pertain only to\n       state agencies . . . . Based on these statutes, we conclude that\n       [PSPRS’s board] is a state agency.\n\n\n\n4 We cite the 2011 version of the statute for ease of reference because its\nlanguage is the same as the version in effect at the time of ADOA.\n\n\n\n                                      5\n\f                           PIVOTAL et al. v. PSPRS\n                             Opinion of the Court\n\nId. (citations omitted).\n\n¶13            Later that year, we held in Fund Manager that PSPRS must\ncomply with the procurement code when it hires outside counsel. 152\nAriz. at 260, 731 P.2d at 625. PSPRS contended that it is not subject to the\nprocurement code because it is not a state agency and does not spend\npublic money. Id. at 259, 731 P.2d at 624. We again rejected PSPRS’s\nargument. Acknowledging our earlier determination in ADOA, we\nexplained:\n\n       The individual members of [PSPRS’s board] are appointed\n       by the [G]overnor under . . . [statutes pertaining] to the\n       appointment of state officers. In addition . . . the [A]ttorney\n       [G]eneral, the chief legal officer of the state, is a legal\n       representative of [PSPRS’s board]. Further, the Sunset\n       Review Laws, which pertain only to state agencies . . . [apply\n       to PSPRS’s board].\n\nId.\n\n¶14            In 1987, the Legislature amended PSPRS’s enabling\nlegislation to exempt its board from A.R.S. § 38-611 and the procurement\ncode. A.R.S. § 38-848(M) (2011).5 The Seldins argue that the 1987\namendment superseded both our determination that PSPRS’s board is\nsubject to A.R.S. § 38-611 and the procurement code, and our conclusion\nthat PSPRS is a state agency. However, nothing in that amendment\ndisturbs the underpinnings of our conclusion that PSPRS is a state agency.\nThe rationale that led us to conclude PSPRS is a state agency in ADOA and\nFund Manager remains valid today. The State Legislature created PSPRS\nand did so to allow the State and other public entities to satisfy their\ncontractual obligations to public safety retirees, and its board is appointed\nby the Governor with the consent of the Senate.\n\n¶15           The Seldins make too much of the 1987 amendment. Instead\nof classifying PSPRS as something other than a state agency, that\namendment simply exempted PSPRS’s board from A.R.S. § 38-611 and the\nprocurement code. “There is nothing unique about a state agency being\n\n\n5 We cite the 2011 version of the statute for ease of reference because its\nlanguage reflects the version effected by the 1987 amendment. The section\nhas since been amended to remove this language. See A.R.S. § 38-848(M)\n(Supp. 2013).\n\n\n\n                                     6\n\f                         PIVOTAL et al. v. PSPRS\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nexempt from the personnel system.” ADOA, 151 Ariz. at 95, 725 P.2d at\n1129. Nor is there anything unique about a state agency being exempt\nfrom the procurement code. Fund Manager, 152 Ariz. at 259, 731 P.2d at\n624 (noting that the procurement code exempts a number of agencies from\nits coverage). Thus, although the 1987 amendment superseded ADOA’s\nand Fund Manager’s determinations that PSPRS’s board is subject to the\nPersonnel Board’s salary recommendations and the procurement code, it\ndid not affect our conclusion that PSPRS is a state agency.\n\n¶16           Our conclusion is further supported by the fact that,\nalthough the Legislature has exempted PSPRS from certain statutes\notherwise applicable to state agencies, see A.R.S. § 38-848(M), it has not\nexempted PSPRS from the liability/immunity provisions of Title 12,\nwhich include the notice of claim requirement and the one-year statute of\nlimitations applicable to public entities.6 “The provision of one exemption\nin a statute implicitly denies the existence of other unstated exemptions.”\nState Comp. Fund v. Superior Court (EnerGCorp, Inc.), 190 Ariz. 371, 375, 948\nP.2d 499, 503 (App. 1997). Furthermore, the Legislature would not have\nexpressly exempted PSPRS from the procurement code and the Personnel\nBoard, two sets of statutes otherwise applicable to state agencies, unless it\nviewed PSPRS as a state agency. See id. at 376, 948 P.2d at 504.\nAccordingly, PSPRS remains a state agency covered by Title 12’s\nliability/immunity provisions.\n\n¶17        We are not persuaded by the Seldins’ argument that entities\nsuch as private insurers and charter schools are subject to state\n\n6 The Seldins point out that PSPRS’s enabling legislation uses the words\n“not subject to,” A.R.S. § 38-848(M), rather than the word “exempt,” and\nargue that there is a meaningful distinction between the two. In this\ncontext, we discern no meaningful difference between exempting PSPRS’s\nboard from the state procurement code or the jurisdiction of the Personnel\nBoard, and stating that it “is not subject to” the procurement code or the\njurisdiction of the Personnel Board. See, e.g., State Comp. Fund v. Superior\nCourt (EnerGCorp, Inc.), 190 Ariz. 371, 375, 948 P.2d 499, 503 (App. 1997)\n(citing State Comp. Fund v. Symington, 174 Ariz. 188, 194, 848 P.2d 273, 279\n(1993) and using “not subject to” and “exempt” interchangeably when\nexplaining that the State Fund is exempt from some statutes otherwise\napplicable to state agencies). Furthermore, the 1987 amendment was\nenacted as “[a]n act . . . prescribing an exemption from the procurement\ncode . . . .” 1987 Ariz. Sess. Laws., ch. 180 (1st Reg. Sess.) (emphasis\nadded).\n\n\n\n                                     7\n\f                         PIVOTAL et al. v. PSPRS\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nsupervision and regulation, yet are not state entities. The Seldins’\nargument ignores that private insurers and charter schools are not created\nby the Legislature. It is the bundle of statutes that create and regulate an\nentity that makes it a public entity for purposes of the notice of claim and\ncorresponding limitations statutes. PSPRS is a creature of statute, its\nboard is appointed by the Governor, and it is subject to various levels of\nstate control while being expressly exempted from other controls, yet not\nexempted from the immunity provisions of Title 12. That combination of\nfactors makes it a state agency subject to the notice of claim and\nlimitations statutes.\n\n       B.     The 2006 Amendment\n\n¶18           The Seldins offer two additional arguments related to a 2006\namendment to PSPRS’s enabling legislation that designates it as an\n“independent trust fund whose assets are separate and apart from all\nother funds of this state” and specifies that PSPRS is not subject to the\ndebt limits of Article 9, Sections 5 and 8, of the Arizona Constitution.\nA.R.S. § 38-848(M). The Seldins argue, first, that PSPRS cannot be a state\nagency because it is designated as an “independent trust fund” and its\nassets are separate from state funds. Second, the Seldins argue that\nholding otherwise would render the 2006 amendment unconstitutional\nbecause the Legislature cannot statutorily exempt a state agency from\napplicable constitutional provisions. We do not find these arguments\npersuasive.\n\n¶19            The language designating PSPRS as an “independent trust\nfund,” A.R.S. § 38-848(M), merely codifies part of the Arizona\nConstitution. Article 29, Section 1(B), of the Arizona Constitution states\nthat “[t]he assets of public retirement systems . . . are separate and\nindependent trust funds and shall be invested, administered and\ndistributed as determined by law solely in the interests of the members\nand beneficiaries of the public retirement systems.” That the Legislature\nstatutorily reiterated this constitutional designation does not demonstrate\nits intent to render PSPRS something other than a state agency. We\nunderstand the Seldins’ argument to be that PSPRS is not a state agency\nbecause its assets are not state money. PSPRS’s assets admittedly are not\nstate money. But this means only that its assets are separate from the state\ntreasury. See Grant v. Bd. of Regents, 133 Ariz. 527, 529, 652 P.2d 1374, 1376\n(1982) (“‘state money’ is money in the state treasury credited to a\nparticular fund therein”). PSPRS’s assets are still public money. See\nMcClead, 174 Ariz. at 352, 849 P.2d at 1382 (concluding that plaintiffs had\ntaxpayer standing to challenge increases in PSPRS retirement benefits\n\n\n                                      8\n\f                         PIVOTAL et al. v. PSPRS\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nbecause PSPRS expends public money). Public money is “all [money]\ncoming into the lawful possession, custody or control of state agencies,\nboards, commissions, or departments or a state officer, employee or agent\nin his official capacity, irrespective of the source from which, or the\nmanner in which, the [money is] received.” Id.; see also A.R.S. § 35-212(B)\n(2011). State money is a subset of public money, which encompasses a\nbroad range of funds lawfully in the State’s possession or under its\ncontrol, including state employee retirement funds held in independent\ntrust. That PSPRS manages an independent public trust fund rather than\na fund appropriated from the state treasury does not defeat its status as a\nstate agency.7\n\n¶20           As for the Seldins’ contention that holding PSPRS is a state\nagency for purposes of the notice of claim and one-year limitations period\nwould render the 2006 amendment unconstitutional, we determined in\nother cases that certain public entities that are otherwise covered by Title\n12’s immunity provisions were not subject to constitutional debt\nlimitations when the debt incurred did not impose a liability on the state\ngeneral fund. See Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Ariz. v. Sullivan, 45 Ariz. 245,\n260, 42 P.2d 619, 625 (1935); see also Arizona State Highway Comm’n v.\nNelson, 105 Ariz. 76, 79-80, 459 P.2d 509, 512-13 (1969). Because the\nconstitutionality of the 2006 amendment is not at issue in this case, we\ndecline to address the matter further.\n\n¶21           PSPRS requested attorneys’ fees incurred on appeal\npursuant to A.R.S. § 12-341.01(A) (Supp. 2013). In the exercise of our\ndiscretion, we decline to award attorneys’ fees. However, pursuant to\nA.R.S. § 12-342 (2003), PSPRS is entitled to its taxable costs on appeal upon\ntimely compliance with ARCAP 21.\n\n\n7 Nor are we persuaded by the Seldins’ argument that applying the notice\nof claim statute to PSPRS would not serve the statute’s purpose because\nPSPRS’s fund is independent from the state treasury. The purpose of the\nnotice of claims statute is to assist public entities from incurring excess or\nunwarranted liability and to facilitate settlement by allowing the public\nentity to investigate the claim and to budget accordingly. See Yollin, 219\nAriz. at 29, ¶ 11, 191 P.3d at 1045. That PSPRS’s fund is segregated from\nthe state treasury does not change the public nature of the entity or the\npublic nature of the fund it manages. Further, by the plain language of\nA.R.S. § 12-821.01 (Supp. 2013), application of the statute is contingent on\nthe nature of the entity, not the nature of its fund.\n\n\n\n                                      9\n\f                       PIVOTAL et al. v.

We affirm\nbecause PSPRS is a state agency for purposes of the notice of claim statute,\nand the Seldins admittedly failed to provide PSPRS with a notice of claim\nor to file suit within the one-year statute of limitations period applicable to\nclaims against public entities.\n\n               FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n¶2            In September 2011, the Seldins sued PSPRS, alleging, among\nother things, aiding and abetting fraud and aiding and abetting breach of\nfiduciary duty. The claims arose out of a real estate investment gone\nawry, the specifics of which are not relevant to this appeal. PSPRS moved\nto dismiss the claims against it under Arizona Rule of Civil Procedure\n12(b)(6), arguing that it is a state agency covered by Arizona’s notice of\nclaim statute, Arizona Revised Statutes (“A.R.S.”) section 12-821.01 (Supp.\n2013),2 and the one-year statute of limitations applicable to claims against\npublic entities, A.R.S. § 12-821 (2003). The Seldins admittedly did not\nprovide PSPRS with a notice of claim, nor did they file the lawsuit within\nthe one-year limitations period. Instead, the Seldins argued that PSPRS is\nnot a state agency and, therefore, neither the notice of claim statute nor the\none-year limitations period applied.\n\n¶3           The superior court granted PSPRS’s motion to dismiss,\nconcluding that PSPRS is a state agency covered by the notice of claim\nstatute and the one-year statute of limitations. The Seldins timely\n\n\n1 Plaintiffs/Appellants included Millard R. Seldin, Scott A. Seldin, and\nnumerous Seldin-controlled entities, including Pivotal Colorado II, L.L.C.\n2 We cite the most recent versions of statutes when no revisions material\n\nto this decision have since occurred.\n\n\n\n                                      2\n\f                         PIVOTAL et al. v.

We have jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. § 12-2101(A)(1) (Supp.\n2013).\n\n                               DISCUSSION\n\n¶4             We review the superior court’s grant of a motion to dismiss\nfor failure to state a claim de novo. See N. Peak Constr., LLC v. Architecture\nPlus, Ltd., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.</span> <span class=\"page\">165</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 167, ¶ 13, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2461868\"><a href=\"/opinion/2461868/north-peak-const-v-architecture-plus-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">404</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 406 (App. 2011). The sole\nissue on review is whether PSPRS is a state agency for purposes of the\nnotice of claim statute and the one-year statute of limitations applicable to\npublic entities. We conclude that it is.\n\nI.     Notice of Claim and Limitations Statutes\n\n¶5             “Persons who have claims against a public entity . . . shall\nfile claims with the person or persons authorized to accept service for the\npublic entity . . . within one hundred eighty days after the cause of action\naccrues.” A.R.S. § 12-821.01(A). The claim must include facts sufficient to\nallow the public entity to understand and assess liability. Id. “Any claim\nthat is not filed within one hundred eighty days after the cause of action\naccrues is barred . . . .” Id. The claim statute assists the government from\nincurring “excess or unwarranted liability and facilitates settlement of\nclaims by allowing the government to investigate the claim . . . and budget\nfor settlement or payment of large claims.” Yollin v. City of Glendale, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 29, ¶ 11, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2630491\"><a href=\"/opinion/2630491/yollin-v-city-of-glendale/\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1040</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1045 (App. 2008). Additionally, “[a]ll\nactions against any public entity . . . shall be brought within one year\nafter the cause of action accrues . . . .” A.R.S. § 12-821.\n\n¶6            A public entity “includes this state and any political\nsubdivision of this state.” A.R.S. § 12-820(7) (Supp. 2013).3 “’State’ means\nthis state and any state agency, board, commission or department.” A.R.S.\n§ 12-820(8) (emphasis added). Thus, the notice of claim statute and the\naccompanying limitations period apply to PSPRS if it is a state agency,\nboard, commission or department.\n\n\n\n\n3 We note that the statute does not restrict the definition of “public entity”\nto the state or a political subdivision. The word “includes” suggests that\nother organizational forms could be considered public entities for notice\nof claim purposes. PSPRS, however, does not raise any argument in this\nregard.\n\n\n\n                                      3\n\f                          PIVOTAL et al. v.

PSPRS Is a State Agency\n\n¶7            PSPRS “is the state agency responsible for administering the\npensions of Arizona’s police and fire fighters.” McClead v. Pima Cnty., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1135525\"><a href=\"/opinion/1135525/mcclead-v-pima-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">174</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.</span> <span class=\"page\">348</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 353, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1135525\"><a href=\"/opinion/1135525/mcclead-v-pima-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">849</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1378</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1383 (App. 1992). Before July 1968, public\nsafety employees “were covered under various local, municipal and state\nretirement programs.” A.R.S. § 38-841(A)-(B) (2011). Consequently,\nbenefits paid to different groups of public safety employees varied widely.\nId. Our Legislature created PSPRS “[i]n order to provide a uniform,\nconsistent and equitable statewide program for public safety personnel\nwho are regularly assigned hazardous duty . . . .” A.R.S. § 38-841(B).\n\n¶8           PSPRS is managed by a board of trustees (“PSPRS’s board”),\nwhose members are appointed by the Governor with the consent of the\nSenate through the statutory procedures for appointment of state officers.\nA.R.S. §§ 38-848(A) (2011), -211(A) (2011). PSPRS’s board invests and\nmanages PSPRS’s assets, A.R.S. § 38-848(D), which are derived exclusively\nfrom deductions from the salaries of public safety employees and\ncontributions by their employers, A.R.S. § 38-843 (Supp. 2013).\n\n¶9            This Court previously concluded that PSPRS is a state\nagency based on the fact that it was created by the Legislature, its board is\nappointed by the Governor, it manages pension funds for state and local\npublic safety employees, the Arizona Attorney General serves as its\ncounsel, and it is subject to state agency sunset laws.

We\nconclude otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n                                       4\n\f                          PIVOTAL et al. v. PSPRS\n                            Opinion of the Court\n\n       A.     ADOA, Fund Manager, and the 1987 Amendment to A.R.S. §\n              38-848\n\n¶11            In ADOA, we concluded that PSPRS’s board was subject to\nthe salary recommendations of the Arizona Department of\nAdministration’s Personnel Board (“Personnel Board”). 151 Ariz. at 95-96,\n725 P.2d at 1129-30. The Personnel Board “annually recommends a salary\nrange for [state] agency heads and certain other [state] employees” that\ngoverns the salaries that can be paid to those individuals. Id. at 94, 725\nP.2d at 1128; see A.R.S. §§ 41-743(B)(4) (2013), -751(B)(4) (2013). At the\ntime, PSPRS’s enabling legislation stated that “[t]he administrator and\nother employees hired by [PSPRS’s board] are not under the jurisdiction of\nthe state personnel board or subject to title 41, chapter 4, articles 5 and 6.”\nA.R.S. § 38-848(J)(6) (1985); see also ADOA, 151 Ariz. at 94, 725 P.2d at 1128.\nPSPRS argued that its exemption from the jurisdiction of the Personnel\nBoard also exempted it from the salary recommendations. ADOA, 151\nAriz. at 94, 725 P.2d at 1128.\n\n¶12              A.R.S. § 38-611 (2011)4 gave the Personnel Board the\nauthority to make salary recommendations for state agencies otherwise\nexempt from the state personnel system. Id. PSPRS argued that A.R.S. §\n38-611 was inapplicable because PSPRS is not a state agency. Id. at 95, 725\nP.2d at 1129. We rejected PSPRS’s argument and concluded that it is a\nstate agency based upon how it was created, who appointed its members,\nits duties, its legal counsel, and it being subject to sunset laws:\n\n       [PSPRS’s board] consists of . . . individuals appointed by the\n       Governor. The appointment is made pursuant to A.R.S. §\n       38-211 which pertains to the appointment of state officers.\n       [Its] purpose is to manage monies in the Public Safety\n       Personnel Retirement System fund consisting of deductions\n       taken from the salaries of public safety personnel and\n       contributions by their employers. The Attorney General,\n       being the ‘chief legal officer’ of the state is a legal\n       representative of [PSPRS’s board]. Further, [PSPRS’s board\n       is subject to] the Sunset Review Laws, which pertain only to\n       state agencies . . . . Based on these statutes, we conclude that\n       [PSPRS’s board] is a state agency.\n\n\n\n4 We cite the 2011 version of the statute for ease of reference because its\nlanguage is the same as the version in effect at the time of ADOA.\n\n\n\n                                      5\n\f                           PIVOTAL et al. v.

(citations omitted).\n\n¶13            Later that year, we held in Fund Manager that PSPRS must\ncomply with the procurement code when it hires outside counsel. 152\nAriz. at 260, 731 P.2d at 625. PSPRS contended that it is not subject to the\nprocurement code because it is not a state agency and does not spend\npublic money. Id. at 259, 731 P.2d at 624. We again rejected PSPRS’s\nargument. Acknowledging our earlier determination in ADOA, we\nexplained:\n\n       The individual members of [PSPRS’s board] are appointed\n       by the [G]overnor under . . . [statutes pertaining] to the\n       appointment of state officers. In addition . . . the [A]ttorney\n       [G]eneral, the chief legal officer of the state, is a legal\n       representative of [PSPRS’s board]. Further, the Sunset\n       Review Laws, which pertain only to state agencies . . . [apply\n       to PSPRS’s board].\n\nId.\n\n¶14            In 1987, the Legislature amended PSPRS’s enabling\nlegislation to exempt its board from A.R.S. § 38-611 and the procurement\ncode. A.R.S. § 38-848(M) (2011).5 The Seldins argue that the 1987\namendment superseded both our determination that PSPRS’s board is\nsubject to A.R.S. § 38-611 and the procurement code, and our conclusion\nthat PSPRS is a state agency. However, nothing in that amendment\ndisturbs the underpinnings of our conclusion that PSPRS is a state agency.\nThe rationale that led us to conclude PSPRS is a state agency in ADOA and\nFund Manager remains valid today. The State Legislature created PSPRS\nand did so to allow the State and other public entities to satisfy their\ncontractual obligations to public safety retirees, and its board is appointed\nby the Governor with the consent of the Senate.\n\n¶15           The Seldins make too much of the 1987 amendment. Instead\nof classifying PSPRS as something other than a state agency, that\namendment simply exempted PSPRS’s board from A.R.S. § 38-611 and the\nprocurement code. “There is nothing unique about a state agency being\n\n\n5 We cite the 2011 version of the statute for ease of reference because its\nlanguage reflects the version effected by the 1987 amendment. The section\nhas since been amended to remove this language. See A.R.S. § 38-848(M)\n(Supp. 2013).\n\n\n\n                                     6\n\f                         PIVOTAL et al. v. PSPRS\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nexempt from the personnel system.” ADOA, 151 Ariz. at 95, 725 P.2d at\n1129. Nor is there anything unique about a state agency being exempt\nfrom the procurement code. Fund Manager, 152 Ariz. at 259, 731 P.2d at\n624 (noting that the procurement code exempts a number of agencies from\nits coverage). Thus, although the 1987 amendment superseded ADOA’s\nand Fund Manager’s determinations that PSPRS’s board is subject to the\nPersonnel Board’s salary recommendations and the procurement code, it\ndid not affect our conclusion that PSPRS is a state agency.\n\n¶16           Our conclusion is further supported by the fact that,\nalthough the Legislature has exempted PSPRS from certain statutes\notherwise applicable to state agencies, see A.R.S. § 38-848(M), it has not\nexempted PSPRS from the liability/immunity provisions of Title 12,\nwhich include the notice of claim requirement and the one-year statute of\nlimitations applicable to public entities.6 “The provision of one exemption\nin a statute implicitly denies the existence of other unstated exemptions.”\nState Comp. Fund v. Superior Court (EnerGCorp, Inc.), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1125167\"><a href=\"/opinion/1125167/state-compensation-fund-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">190</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 375, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1125167\"><a href=\"/opinion/1125167/state-compensation-fund-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">948</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 503 (App. 1997). Furthermore, the Legislature would not have\nexpressly exempted PSPRS from the procurement code and the Personnel\nBoard, two sets of statutes otherwise applicable to state agencies, unless it\nviewed PSPRS as a state agency. See id. at 376, 948 P.2d at 504.\nAccordingly, PSPRS remains a state agency covered by Title 12’s\nliability/immunity provisions.\n\n¶17        We are not persuaded by the Seldins’ argument that entities\nsuch as private insurers and charter schools are subject to state\n\n6 The Seldins point out that PSPRS’s enabling legislation uses the words\n“not subject to,” A.R.S. § 38-848(M), rather than the word “exempt,” and\nargue that there is a meaningful distinction between the two. In this\ncontext, we discern no meaningful difference between exempting PSPRS’s\nboard from the state procurement code or the jurisdiction of the Personnel\nBoard, and stating that it “is not subject to” the procurement code or the\njurisdiction of the Personnel Board.

Furthermore, the 1987 amendment was\nenacted as “[a]n act . . . prescribing an exemption from the procurement\ncode . . . .” 1987 Ariz. Sess. Laws., ch. 180 (1st Reg. Sess.) (emphasis\nadded).\n\n\n\n                                     7\n\f                         PIVOTAL et al. v. PSPRS\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nsupervision and regulation, yet are not state entities. The Seldins’\nargument ignores that private insurers and charter schools are not created\nby the Legislature. It is the bundle of statutes that create and regulate an\nentity that makes it a public entity for purposes of the notice of claim and\ncorresponding limitations statutes. PSPRS is a creature of statute, its\nboard is appointed by the Governor, and it is subject to various levels of\nstate control while being expressly exempted from other controls, yet not\nexempted from the immunity provisions of Title 12. That combination of\nfactors makes it a state agency subject to the notice of claim and\nlimitations statutes.\n\n       B.     The 2006 Amendment\n\n¶18           The Seldins offer two additional arguments related to a 2006\namendment to PSPRS’s enabling legislation that designates it as an\n“independent trust fund whose assets are separate and apart from all\nother funds of this state” and specifies that PSPRS is not subject to the\ndebt limits of Article 9, Sections 5 and 8, of the Arizona Constitution.\nA.R.S. § 38-848(M). The Seldins argue, first, that PSPRS cannot be a state\nagency because it is designated as an “independent trust fund” and its\nassets are separate from state funds. Second, the Seldins argue that\nholding otherwise would render the 2006 amendment unconstitutional\nbecause the Legislature cannot statutorily exempt a state agency from\napplicable constitutional provisions. We do not find these arguments\npersuasive.\n\n¶19            The language designating PSPRS as an “independent trust\nfund,” A.R.S. § 38-848(M), merely codifies part of the Arizona\nConstitution. Article 29, Section 1(B), of the Arizona Constitution states\nthat “[t]he assets of public retirement systems . . . are separate and\nindependent trust funds and shall be invested, administered and\ndistributed as determined by law solely in the interests of the members\nand beneficiaries of the public retirement systems.” That the Legislature\nstatutorily reiterated this constitutional designation does not demonstrate\nits intent to render PSPRS something other than a state agency. We\nunderstand the Seldins’ argument to be that PSPRS is not a state agency\nbecause its assets are not state money. PSPRS’s assets admittedly are not\nstate money. But this means only that its assets are separate from the state\ntreasury. See Grant v. Bd. of Regents, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1165228\"><a href=\"/opinion/1165228/grant-v-bd-of-regents-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 529, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1165228\"><a href=\"/opinion/1165228/grant-v-bd-of-regents-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">652</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1374</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1376\n(1982) (“‘state money’ is money in the state treasury credited to a\nparticular fund therein”). PSPRS’s assets are still public money. See\nMcClead, 174 Ariz. at 352, 849 P.2d at 1382 (concluding that plaintiffs had\ntaxpayer standing to challenge increases in PSPRS retirement benefits\n\n\n                                      8\n\f                         PIVOTAL et al. v. PSPRS\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nbecause PSPRS expends public money). Public money is “all [money]\ncoming into the lawful possession, custody or control of state agencies,\nboards, commissions, or departments or a state officer, employee or agent\nin his official capacity, irrespective of the source from which, or the\nmanner in which, the [money is] received.” Id.; see also A.R.S. § 35-212(B)\n(2011). State money is a subset of public money, which encompasses a\nbroad range of funds lawfully in the State’s possession or under its\ncontrol, including state employee retirement funds held in independent\ntrust. That PSPRS manages an independent public trust fund rather than\na fund appropriated from the state treasury does not defeat its status as a\nstate agency.7\n\n¶20           As for the Seldins’ contention that holding PSPRS is a state\nagency for purposes of the notice of claim and one-year limitations period\nwould render the 2006 amendment unconstitutional, we determined in\nother cases that certain public entities that are otherwise covered by Title\n12’s immunity provisions were not subject to constitutional debt\nlimitations when the debt incurred did not impose a liability on the state\ngeneral fund.

Sullivan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.</span> <span class=\"page\">245</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n260, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 625 (1935); see also Arizona State Highway Comm’n v.\nNelson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2612126\"><a href=\"/opinion/2612126/arizona-state-highway-commission-v-nelson/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 79-80, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2612126\"><a href=\"/opinion/2612126/arizona-state-highway-commission-v-nelson/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">509</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 512-13 (1969). Because the\nconstitutionality of the 2006 amendment is not at issue in this case, we\ndecline to address the matter further.\n\n¶21           PSPRS requested attorneys’ fees incurred on appeal\npursuant to A.R.S. § 12-341.01(A) (Supp. 2013). In the exercise of our\ndiscretion, we decline to award attorneys’ fees. However, pursuant to\nA.R.S. § 12-342 (2003), PSPRS is entitled to its taxable costs on appeal upon\ntimely compliance with ARCAP 21.\n\n\n7 Nor are we persuaded by the Seldins’ argument that applying the notice\nof claim statute to PSPRS would not serve the statute’s purpose because\nPSPRS’s fund is independent from the state treasury. The purpose of the\nnotice of claims statute is to assist public entities from incurring excess or\nunwarranted liability and to facilitate settlement by allowing the public\nentity to investigate the claim and to budget accordingly. See Yollin, 219\nAriz. at 29, ¶ 11, 191 P.3d at 1045. That PSPRS’s fund is segregated from\nthe state treasury does not change the public nature of the entity or the\npublic nature of the fund it manages. Further, by the plain language of\nA.R.S. § 12-821.01 (Supp. 2013), application of the statute is contingent on\nthe nature of the entity, not the nature of its fund.\n\n\n\n                                      9\n\f                       PIVOTAL et al. v. PSPRS\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n\n¶22           For the foregoing reasons, PSPRS is a state agency covered\nby the notice of claim statute and the one-year statute of limitations\napplicable to public entities. The Seldins did not provide PSPRS with a\nnotice of claim, nor did they file suit within the one-year limitations\nperiod. Accordingly, the superior court properly dismissed the Seldins’\nclaims against PSPRS and we affirm that judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                :gsh\n\n\n\n\n                                  10\n\f</pre>",
