Attorney General Bell, in a\nletter of March 17, 1978, to the then Secretary of Health, Education,\nand Welfare, concurred in the conclusions expressed in the attached\nMarch 16, 1978, opinion of this Office on a similar bill. [2 Op. O.L.C.\n77 (1978).] Attorney General Bell concluded that such extension of\nthese grants to students enrolled in nonpublic elementary and secondary\nschools would be unconstitutional. We have reconsidered our earlier\nviews and believe that subsequent Supreme Court decisions confirm our\nconclusions. This memorandum supplements the views expressed in our\nMarch 16, 1978, opinion.\n   The BEOG program, as it now operates, provides grants to certain\nneedy students enrolled in institutions of higher education. S. 1101\nwould make students enrolled in private elementary and secondary\nschools eligible for these grants.\n   In order for a statute to survive Establishment Clause scrutiny, it\nmust have a secular legislative purpose; it must not have a primary\neffect that either advances or inhibits religions; and it must not foster an\nexcessive entanglement with religion. Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S.\n602, 612 (1971). This test has been repeated in every significant Su­\npreme Court decision in this area during the last decade. There is no\nevidence in cases decided by the Supreme Court since our earlier\nmemorandum that this three-part test has been altered in any significant\nway.\n\n  1 20 U .S.C . § 1070a (1976), as amended by 20 U .S.C. § 1070a (Supp. II 1978).\n\n                                                     648\n\f     Applying that test to the BEOG bill now under consideration in the\n  Senate, we remain of the view that while the program envisoned in that\n  bill might be found to have a neutral, nonreligious purpose, it would be\n struck down, nonetheless, because it has a primary effect that advances\n  the religious mission of sectarian elementary and secondary schools.\n     The programs appears to be virtually indistinguishable from that\n considered by the Congress two years ago and is not constitutionally\n distinguishable from those tuition grant programs struck down in Com­\n mittee fo r Public Education v. Nyquist, 413 U.S. 756 (1973), and a\n companion case, Sloan v. Lemon, 413 U.S. 825 (1973).\n     In Nyquist, the Court found that the New York program of tuition\n reimbursement to parents of children attending nonpublic elementary or\n secondary schools and a tax deduction provision had a primary effect\n of advancing religion. Likewise, a similar Pennsylvania tuition reim­\n bursement program was invalidated in Sloan. The Court made clear in\n these cases that it would strike down unrestricted grants to sectarian\n elementary and secondary schools, even if given indirectly by payments\n to the parents rather than the schools, see Sloan v. Lemon, 413 U.S. at\n 832, because such funds could be used to promote the religious mission\n of the schools. The Court in Nyquist noted that whether the funds are\n provided as reimbursement for tuition paid in past years or as grants for\n the current year is of no constitutional significance. 413 U.S. at 786-87.\n Nor does it matter whether the payment is made to the students rather\n than to the parents because “the Court look[s] beyond the formal\n recipient of the aid” to its primary effect of supporting the sectarian\n schools. See National Coalition for Public Ed. v. Harris, 489 F. Supp.\n 1248, 1259 (S.D.N.Y. 1980), citing Sloan v. Lemon, 413 U.S. at 832.\n    Recent Supreme Court decisions do not question Nyquist and Sloan.\n Just last term, the Court summarily affirmed Beggans v. Public Funds\nfo r Public Schools, 442 U.S. 907 (1979). The Third Circuit in Beggans\n relied heavily on Nyquist to strike down a New Jersey program of tax\n exemptions for parents of children enrolled in nonpublic elementary\n and secondary schools. 590 F.2d 514 (3d Cir. 1979). The court found\n that:\n       Even if parents of dependents in nonpublic schools do\n       have greater expenses than those supporting dependents in\n       public schools, the State may not “equalize” the burden\n       by granting a benefit only to taxpayers with dependents in\n       private or parochial schools. Nyquist explicitly forecloses\n       the argument that the State may deny an exemption to the\n       parents of students in public schools but may grant an\n       exemption to parents of students in nonpublic schools, on\n       the supposition that this differing treatment may tend to\n       equalize the two classes of parents in their educational\n       expenditures.\n\n                                   649\n\f          Inasmuch as New Jersey’s exemption denies to parents of\n          public school students a benefit granted to parents of\n          students in nonpublic schools, the exemption is not saved\n          because a similar provision applies to parents of college\n          and university students, including those in public institu­\n          tions.\nId. at 519-20 (citations deleted). Beggans noted that Nyquist held that\nthe tax exemption and tuition reimbursement programs each independ­\nently violated the Constitution. Id. at 520. As in the New Jersey\nprogram before the court in Beggans, the fact that the BEOG program\nis available to students in institutions of higher education does not make\nit a comprehensive and neutral scheme more similar to the property tax\nexemption for real property owned by religious organizations and used\nfor religious purposes upheld in Walz v. Tax Commission, 397 U.S. 664\n(1970).\n   This term the Supreme Court upheld a New York statute that directs\nthe reimbursement of nonpublic schools for the costs incurred in admin­\nistering state-mandated testing and certain other administrative activi­\nties. Commission fo r Public Education and Religious Liberty v. Regan,\n444 U.S. 646 (1980). The Court concluded that although sectarian\nschools received this aid along with secular private schools, the statute\ndoes not have a primary effect that advances religion. The funds go to\nclearly identifiable secular services. The Court compared the testing\nprogram in Regan with that upheld in Wolman v. Walter, 433 U.S. 229,\n240-41 (1977), and found that since the school has no control over the\ncontent of the tests, they could not be used for religious educational\npurposes. The Court noted:\n         if the grading procedures could be used to further the\n         religious mission of the school, serious Establishment\n         Clause problems would be posed under the Court’s cases,\n         for by furnishing the tests it might be concluded that the\n         State was directly aiding religious education.\n444 U.S. at 657. The administrative costs for which schools were\nreimbursed were also found to be separable and not related to the\nteaching function.\n   Regan does not purport to call into question the direct precedent in\nNyquist and Sloan that tuition reimbursement programs are unconstitu­\ntional. Tuition finances all aspects of a nonpublic school’s program,\nincluding the teaching and general religious education function of sec­\ntarian schools. Reimbursement thus would have a primary effect of\nadvancing the religious mission of the schools.2 Tuition reimbursement\n\n   8 T h e Suprem e C o u rt has developed a presum ption th at aid to the teaching aspects o f sectarian\nelem entary and secondary schools has a prim ary effect o f advancing the religious mission o f the\n                                              C on tin u ed\n\n\n                                                   650\n\fcannot be equated with the clearly segregated secular activities upheld\nin Regan. 3\n\n                                                           J ohn M.

See, e.g., Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U.S. 349, 365-66 (1975); Lemon v.\nKurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 617-19 (1971). T h e C o u rt has not applied a similar presum ption to institutions\no f higher education, see, e.g, Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 672 (1971), and therefore statutory\nschemes such as the B E O G program are defensible at the college and university level.\n    A three-judge district co u rt has recently upheld a program o f rem edial and counseling services in\nthe N ew York C ity sectarian elem entary and secondary schools. National Coalition for Public Ed. v.\nHarris. 489 F. Supp. 1248 (S.D .N .Y . 1980) ( “PEARL\"). A fter taking extensive evidence on the\noperation o f the fourteen-year program and the nature o f the schools services, the co u rt found that the\nN ew York C ity schools w ere not pervasively sectarian. Id. at 1260-65. T h e court then analyzed the\nregulations and history o f the program and found that it did not have a prim ary effect o f advancing\nthe religious mission o f the schools. W e cannot predict, o f course, w h ether the Suprem e C ourt will\nadopt this approach. It cannot be applied to an analysis o f S. 1101 on its face because there is no\nrestriction in the bill that to be eligible students must attend schools that are not pervasively sectarian.\nFurtherm ore, the PEARL decision must be distinguished from analysis o f the B E O G program because\nhere w e do not have a record o f operation* o v er m any years to assure a court that “ the result feared in\no ther cases has not m aterialized.\" Id. at 1265. M ost im portantly, a decision on a discrete, carefully\nregulated public-school-w ithin-a-sectarian-school T itle I program does not have precedential value for\na tuition reim bursem ent program that funds any aspect o f the sectarian training. PEARL distinguished\nT itle I from the statutes before the C ourt in Nyquist and Sloan:\n             T he program is therefore not com parable to a tuition reim bursem ent or tax break\n             offered only to parents o f private school students because it does not relieve the\n             schools' financial burdens o r supply funds free from use lim itations and is not limited\n             to a small class o f beneficiaries.\nId. at 1260.\n    3    T he Suprem e C o u rt has found it unnecessary to analyze the third prong o f the Establishm ent\nClause test— the potential for adm inistrative entanglem ent— in a case w here it held that a tuition\nreim bursem ent program has a prim ary effect o f aiding religious elem entary and secondary schools.\nCommittee f o r Public Education v.

W e cannot predict, o f course, w h ether the Suprem e C ourt will\nadopt this approach. It cannot be applied to an analysis o f S. 1101 on its face because there is no\nrestriction in the bill that to be eligible students must attend schools that are not pervasively sectarian.\nFurtherm ore, the PEARL decision must be distinguished from analysis o f the B E O G program because\nhere w e do not have a record o f operation* o v er m any years to assure a court that “ the result feared in\no ther cases has not m aterialized.\" Id. at 1265.
