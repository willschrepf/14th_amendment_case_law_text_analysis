The new penalties imposed by the Legislature\n\nwere to be an additional incentive to force the Payor to make timely payment of\n\nroyalties, as the statutory interest penalty imposed in 1983 on late payments\n\nestablished under Texas Natural Resources Code § 91.403 was not getting the job\n\ndone. The parties dispute whether the cause of action established under Texas\n\nNatural Resources Code § 91.404 to collect unpaid proceeds and interest can be\n\nextinguished ― and the additional penalties to be imposed under Section 91.406\n\nnullified and voided, if late payment of oil and gas proceeds and interest is finally\n\ntendered – albeit after suit had to be filed.\n\n         On motion for summary judgment filed by the Defendant Genesis Crude Oil,\n\nL.P.,1 the trial court found as a matter of law that the additional late payment\n\npenalties enacted under Section 91.406 were not mandatory and were extinguished\n\n\n1\n    CR. 158\n\n\n                                            x\n\fif late payment was tendered at any point prior to trial.2 As a result, the trial court\n\nfound the royalty owner was not entitled to collect either the Minimum Award or\n\nreasonable attorney’s fees for being forced to bring a lawsuit.3 In so doing, the\n\ntrial court rejected both the law’s requirements and the legislative intent to add\n\nadditional mandatory penalties over and above statutory interest, if a lawsuit had to\n\nbe filed because of non-payment of oil and gas proceeds or interest on late\n\npayments.4\n\n       By its ruling, the trial court also rejected the correct standard in making a\n\ndetermination that since late payments and interest had been finally paid, without\n\nfurther monetary damages Gloria Garcia was not entitled to a favorable judgment,\n\nthe Minimum Award of $200 and recovery of reasonable attorney’s fees, or a\n\ndeclaration of the rights of the parties in an ongoing and continuing relationship.5\n\n\n\n\n2\n  CR. 296.

This case involves important issues involving the rights of\n\nroyalty owners, statutory interpretation, and legislative history, and the Court\n\nwould be aided by oral argument. Moreover, any ruling in this case, which would\n\ninvolve issues of first impression, would have significant effect on the relationship\n\nbetween royalty interest owners and operators, especially on the rights of royalty\n\ninterest owners to their royalties and the remedies they have in the event operators\n\nfail to pay those timely. For these reasons, the Appellant believes that oral\n\nargument should be granted.\n\n\n\n\n                                         xii\n\f                                 ISSUES ON APPEAL\n\n                                     ISSUE NO. 1\n\nWhether the trial court erred in determining as a matter of law, that a cause of\naction under Texas Natural Resources Code § 91.404(a)-(b) can be extinguished,\nand the additional penalties to be imposed under Texas Natural Resources Code §\n91.406 nullified and voided even if a suit is filed, as long as the Payor tendered late\npayment of oil and gas proceeds and interest before a trial commences.\n\n                                     ISSUE NO. 2\n\nWhether the trial court erred in determining as a matter of law, that statutory\ninterest imposed under Texas Natural Resources Code § 91.403 provides the only\nmandatory penalty for late payments, even if the Payee has been forced to file suit\nto collect unpaid oil and gas proceeds and interest.\n\n                                     ISSUE NO. 3\n\nWhether the trial court erred in determining as a matter of law, that in order to be\nentitled to recover the statutory Minimum Award of $200.00 and reasonable\nattorney’s fees under Texas Natural Resources Code § 91.406 if suit is filed, the\nPayee must still recover “actual” monetary damages in order to be entitled to\nfavorable final judgment.\n\n                                     ISSUE NO. 4\n\nWhether the trial court erred in determining as a matter of law that the statutory\nlanguage of Texas Natural Resources Code § 91.406 was plain and unambiguous,\nwhich precluded an inquiry into the legislative intent of enacting additional\nmandatory penalties if suit had to be filed, as an incentive to force the Payor to\ntimely pay proceeds from the sale of oil and gas.\n\n\n\n\n                                         xiii\n\f                                  ISSUE NO. 5\n\nWhether the trial court erred in denying Garcia’s right to proceed to trial to\nestablish the essential elements of her claim:\n\n      a.    After notice was given, Genesis breached its duty to timely pay\n            proceeds from the sale of oil and gas to Gloria Garcia, pursuant to\n            Texas Natural Resources Code § 91.402(a)(1);\n\n      b.    Genesis was not excused from making a timely payment of oil and gas\n            proceeds, as there was no legitimate title dispute;\n\n      c.

A declaration of rights under the Texas Natural Resources Code, that\n            Genesis “is or was a ‘payor’ vis-à-vis Ms. Garcia” and “has or had” a\n            duty to keep in place a binding division order in connection with the\n            subject lease under § 91.402(c)(1).\n\n\n\n\n                                      xiv\n\f                              STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\nI.     THE MINERAL OWNERSHIP\n\n     A. 1994 - OIL & GAS LEASE WITH UVALDE ENERGY CORPORATION.\n\n     On August 3, 1994, Gloria Garcia and her father, Willie De La Fuente (now\n\ndeceased) as Lessors, executed and delivered an Oil, Gas and Liquid Hydrocarbons\n\nLease to Uvalde Energy Corporation, Lessee, for the purpose of drilling and\n\nproducing oil, gas, and all other liquid and hydrocarbons.6 The lease was for a\n\nterm of two (2) years from the date of its execution and as long thereafter as oil or\n\ngas was produced from the land by the Lessee in paying quantities, and was filed\n\nfor record.7\n\n     Gloria Garcia’s ownership interest in the 164.16 acre ranch was memorialized\n\nby Gift Deed from her father, Willie De La Fuente, filed for record in Duval\n\nCounty, Texas on November 7, 1994.8 This conveyance to Mrs. Garcia of the\n\nentire fee simple surface and an undivided one-half of the mineral estate was\n\nsubsequently corrected to reflect the reservation of a life estate in the right to\n\nreceive rents and royalties by Willie De La Fuente until his death, which\n\n\n\n\n6\n  CR. 30-40.\n7\n  Id..\n8\n  Supp.CR. 11-12, 61-62.\n\n\n                                         1\n\finstrument was filed for record on December 29, 1994.9 A final Correction Deed\n\nwas executed by Willie De La Fuente to reflect gifts to Mrs. Garcia of mineral\n\ninterests in additional property also located in Duval County, still subject to the\n\nlife estate being reserved by Willie De La Fuente, which was dated March 5, 1995,\n\nbut filed for record on October 19, 1995.10\n\n     B. 1998 - CHANGE IN LESSOR AND PAYOR.\n\n       In 1998, LTD Explorations, Inc. (“LTD”) took an assignment of the Willie\n\nDe La Fuente lease from Uvalde Energy Corporation, and assumed the contractual\n\nlease obligations as the new owner/operator.11 LTD then contracted with Genesis\n\nCrude Oil, LP (“Genesis”) to be the first purchaser of the oil produced from the\n\nsubject lease.12 As a result, on August 14, 1998, Genesis acquired an interest in the\n\noil production and lease and assumed the obligations of a Payor under the Texas\n\nNatural Resources Code, issuing two Division Orders in favor of Willie De La\n\nFuente under Lease No. 54546000, both made effective retroactively to July 1,\n\n1998.13\n\n\n\n\n9\n  Supp.CR. 12, 64-65.\n10\n    Supp.CR. 12, 67-68.\n11\n   CR. 67-68.\n12\n   Id.\n13\n   Supp.CR. 12, 103-104.\n\n\n                                         2\n\f     Willie De La Fuente passed away on December 12, 2008.14 On April 26,\n\n2011, Mrs. Garcia wrote a letter to LTD Exploration (the lessor and operator) and\n\nprovided copies of the Death Certificate and Gift Deed to establish that her royalty\n\nownership had fully vested.15 Receiving no response, on July 12, 2011, Mrs.\n\nGarcia’s attorney, Mark R. Paisley, wrote directly to Genesis concerning Mr. De\n\nLa Fuente’s death back in 2008, which triggered their duty to issue Mrs. Garcia\n\nnew Division Orders in place of Willie De La Fuente, and begin payment of oil\n\nand gas proceeds under the lease.16 Although Paisley wrote and later called\n\nGenesis relating to royalty payments, Genesis never responded.17 Mrs. Garcia\n\nfinally hired attorney James Harris, who again gave written notice to Genesis on\n\nJanuary 24, 2013, of their continued failure to pay royalties and accrued interest to\n\nwhich she was entitled, and provided Genesis with another copy of the 2008 Death\n\nCertificate of Mr. De La Fuente.18\n\n     Genesis failed to pay the oil and gas proceeds due within 30 days after receipt\n\nof the required notice and demand for payment of past due royalties in January of\n\n\n\n\n14\n   Supp.CR. 12, 70.\n15\n   Supp.CR. 12, 70, 72-77.\n16\n   Supp.CR. 12, 79.\n17\n   Supp.CR. 12, 106.\n18\n   Supp.CR. 12, 83-99.\n\n\n                                         3\n\f2013,19 and Genesis had no reasonable cause to dispute Mrs. Garcia’s entitlement\n\nto payment, as it was on constructive and actual notice of her right to be paid\n\nroyalties upon proof of death of her father, and Mrs. Garcia’s title was a matter of\n\npublic record.20 Her recorded title in 1994 long-preceded the transfer of lease to\n\nLTD in 1998, and Genesis Crude Oil, L.P. did not begin purchasing production\n\nfrom the lease until July 1, 1998.21 Genesis willfully refused to respond to Mr.\n\nHarris’ attempts to collect the unpaid royalties in Mrs. Garcia’s behalf.\n\n     C. THE UNDERLYING TEXAS NATURAL RESOURCES CODE LITIGATION.\n\n      Since receiving notice in 2011, both Genesis and LTD disputed liability for\n\ntendering timely royalty payments to Mrs. Garcia from the sale of oil and gas, and\n\nrefused to issue division orders. As a result, six months after sending the January\n\n24, 2013 demand letter to Genesis, Mrs. Garcia amended an environmental\n\nproperty damage lawsuit already pending against the lease owner/operator (LTD)\n\non July 19, 2013, to include both contractual and statutory claims under Texas\n\nNatural Resources Code for non-payment of royalties and interest accruing since\n\n\n\n19\n   CR. 187, Supp.CR. 12, 83; TEX. NATURAL RESOURCES CODE § 91.404(a)-(b). For the Court’s\nconvenience, a copy of TEX. NATURAL RESOURCES CODE § 91.401-91.406 is attached to this\nAppellant’s Brief as Appendix B.\n20\n   CR. 14-16, Jones v. Clem, 2012 WL 1069168, ___ S.W.3d ___, (Tex.App.―Eastland, 2012\n(unpublished opinion).\n21\n   Supp.CR. 12, 103-104.\n\n\n                                           4\n\fDecember 2010.22 Mrs. Garcia also sought declaratory relief from the Court to\n\ndetermine the identity of the statutory “payor” and obtain the division orders\n\nrequired to be issued under Texas Natural Resources Code § 91.402(c)(1), as a\n\nprerequisite to receiving payments.23 At the time of filing the July 19, 2013\n\npetition, royalty payments due Mrs. Garcia had been suspended since December\n\n2010, and both the well operator (LTD) and Genesis (the purchaser of oil\n\nproduction) denied liability for payment of royalties or accrued interest.24\n\n     As a result of the July 2013 pleading amendment, the trial date was delayed\n\nfrom November 12, 2013 to July 28, 2014.                Mrs. Garcia issued a subpoena for\n\nrecords from Genesis on September 18, 2013, seeking information regarding the\n\namount of oil and gas being produced and purchased from the lease, and to\n\ndetermine the relationship between Genesis and the Lessee/Operator pertaining to\n\nthe responsibility to issue division orders and pay proceeds to royalty owners.25 On\n\nJanuary 23, 2014, LTD joined Genesis in the pending lawsuit and Mrs. Garcia\n\nbecame aware that LTD had entered into an agreement with Genesis, whereby the\n\n\n22\n   CR. 21-40.\n23\n   Id.\n24\n   CR. 21-40, and 80-81, 101.\n25\n   TEXAS NATURAL RESOURCES CODE § 91.401(2) [“\"Payor\" means the party who undertakes to\ndistribute oil and gas proceeds to the payee, whether as the purchaser of the production of oil or\ngas generating such proceeds or as operator of the well from which such production was\nobtained or as lessee under the lease on which royalty is due.”]. See, Appendix B.\n\n\n                                                5\n\fpurchaser (Genesis) was to be responsible for payment of the proceeds from the\n\nsale of oil or gas to the royalty owner. 26 Mrs. Garcia also learned at that time that\n\nLTD had made demand upon Genesis to perform its statutory obligations to issue a\n\ndivision order and pay over the royalty proceeds due to Mrs. Garcia, which LTD\n\nalleged Genesis had collected and was holding in suspense.27 LTD’s efforts to\n\nobtain cooperation from Genesis to make full payment of Garcia’s royalties and\n\naccrued interest were unsuccessful.28\n\n     In April 2014, Genesis requested a continuance and the July 28, 2014 trial\n\ndate was postponed again to November 17, 2014.29       On June 4, 2014, Mrs. Garcia\n\nfiled her third amended petition joining Genesis as a direct defendant, seeking a\n\ndeclaration of her statutory rights and all damages to which she was entitled under\n\nthe statute, including accrued interest, and the reasonable attorney’s fees mandated\n\nunder Texas Natural Resources Code § 91.406.30 Mrs. Garcia asserted that as a\n\nresult of having to file suit under Section 91.404, she was not only entitled to\n\nstatutory interest on late payments due under § 91.403(a), but also the statutory\n\nMinimum Award of monetary damages and attorney’s fees imposed under §\n\n\n26\n   CR. 43 at ¶ 3.2.\n27\n   Id.\n28\n   CR. 41-48.\n29\n   CR. 49.\n30\n   CR. 51-60, at 57.

PARTIAL PAYMENTS BY GENESIS\n       After Mrs. Garcia was forced to file suit on July 19, 2013 for “Nonpayment\n\nof Oil and Gas Proceeds or Interest” under the Texas Natural Resources Code and\n\nsubpoenaed records from Genesis, two division orders were finally prepared and\n\nsubmitted by Genesis to Mrs. Garcia to be effective retroactively to December 1,\n\n2010 and January 1, 2011 (respectively) and Genesis made a partial tender of\n\naccrued royalties on November 1, 2013.33 However, Genesis refused to pay Mrs.\n\nGarcia the statutory accrued interest due under Section 91.403(a) of the Texas\n\nNatural Resources Code. As a result, Genesis was joined as a party to the lawsuit\n\non January 23, 2014,34 and named a direct defendant on June 5, 2014.35    Genesis\n\ncontinued to deny liability, asserting (among other defenses) that Mrs. Garcia had\n\n\n\n\n31\n   Id.

Mrs. Garcia also\n\nestablished that the attorney’s fees being sought were both reasonable, necessary,\n\nand incurred against the defendant sought to be charged with said fees.43 The\n\nattorney’s fee claim against Genesis related to far more than three weeks of\n\n39\n   CR. 94-102, at 98 ¶ B [“...plaintiff is required to show that the fees were incurred while suing\nthe defendant sought to be charged with the fees on a claim which allows recovery of such fees.”\n(citing) Stewart Title Co. v.

Thus,\n\nGenesis argued that allowing Mrs. Garcia to recover her attorney’s fees and a\n\nMinimum Award of $200 established under Section 91.406, would be “redundant\n\nto the remedy of statutory interest provided in Section 91.403 of the Resources\n\nCode” an[d] “creates a double penalty where it does not exist.”52 Genesis argued\n\nthat “Section 91.403 provides the mandatory remedy for any late payments,\n\nstatutory interest.”53 As a result, Genesis argued the court should not look to the\n\nstatute’s legislature history, because the plain meaning of Section 91.406 was\n\nunambiguous54 and required a judgment for proceeds or interest as “actual\n\ndamages” at the time of trial, in order for the judgment to be “favorable” to the\n\nplaintiff.55\n\n       Genesis’ Amended Motion for “Final” Summary Judgment stated the only\n\nthree issues in the case were (1) whether the Sec. 91.404 cause of action for\n52\n   CR. 284. See, Appendix B.\n53\n   CR. 286 @ ¶ 2.\n54\n   CR. 286 @ ¶ 1.\n55\n   CR. 285.\n\n\n                                         12\n\f“Nonpayment of Oil and Gas Proceeds or Interest” remained following payment;\n\n(2) if no Section 91.404 cause of action still exists, whether an independent cause\n\nof action existed allowing recovery of attorney’s fees; and (3) whether a party\n\ncould replead the Sec. 91.404 cause of action for non-payment as a Chapter 37\n\ndeclaratory judgment action and recover attorney’s fees.\n\n          The trial court erred by granting a final “take nothing” judgment that the\n\nadditional remedies to be afforded under Texas Natural Resources Code Section\n\n91.406, if suit had to be filed were not available, because the Section 91.404(c)\n\ncause of action established under the Texas Natural Resources Code had been\n\nextinguished following Genesis’ late payment of oil and gas proceeds and statutory\n\naccrued interest.56\n\n                                      ARGUMENT\n\nI.        THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THE CAUSE OF ACTION FOR\n          NONPAYMENT OF OIL AND GAS PROCEEDS OR INTEREST UNDER SECTION\n          91.404 OF THE RESOURCES CODE WAS EXTINGUISHED BY LATE PAYMENT.\n\n          Genesis contends that Section 91.404 created only one cause of action, and\n\nthe affirmative defense of payment (albeit late) for proceeds on November 1, 2013\n\nand late payment of statutory interest on June 25, 2014, extinguished the Resources\n\n\n\n56\n     See, Appendix A.\n\n\n                                          13\n\fCode cause of action for Nonpayment of Oil and Gas Proceeds Or Interest.57 Prior\n\nto the 1987 enactment of Section 91.406, Genesis’ interpretation of the law would\n\nhave been correct. However, following the addition of Section 91.406, statutory\n\ninterest for late payments was no longer the only mandatory penalty to be imposed,\n\nif suit was filed to collect proceeds and interest.\n\n       The sole purpose and legislative intent for adding Section 91.406 to the\n\nTexas Natural Resources Code was to provide “that if a suit is filed to collect\n\nproceeds and interest from the sale of oil and gas proceeds, the court shall include\n\nreasonable attorney’s fees and a minimum award of $200” as an additional\n\nincentive for the Payor to timely make payments.58                Despite the 68th Texas\n\nLegislature enacting strict time deadlines for payment in 1983, the 70 th Legislature\n\nrecognized that it was still very difficult for an individual with a claim for unpaid\n\nroyalty to obtain relief in a court of law under the Resources Code.59 Thus,\n\nrecovery of a minimum award and mandatory attorney’s fees were added as\n\nadditional remedies to persons forced to file suit under the Sec. 91.404 cause of\n\naction established in 1983 by the 68th Legislature, for nonpayment of proceeds and\n\n\n\n\n57\n   CR. 162-163. See, Appendix B.\n58\n   CR. 238 and Appendix D (Tex. H.B. 2363,70th Leg., R.S. – Bill Analysis: Purpose; Synopsis).\n59\n   See, CR. 238 and Appendix D (Tex. H.B. 2363,70th Leg., R.S. – Bill Analysis: Background).\n\n\n                                              14\n\finterest.60\n\n       In American Surety Co. v. Axtell Co., the Texas Supreme Court established\n\nthe steps in interpreting a statute:\n\n       To arrive at the intention of the Legislature ... it is the duty ... to look\n       primarily to the act itself as an entirety; and to understand the legal effect of\n       the amendment enacted by the Legislature, it must be considered in\n       connection with the original act, and that which has been done thereunder. A\n       particular section of an act of the Legislature, when enacted, must be\n       construed in view of the existence of the original statute as it stands after the\n       amendment is introduced; it and all sections of the old law must be regarded\n       as a harmonious whole, as connected with and naturally acting upon each\n       other.... It will be presumed that the Legislature, in adopting the amendment,\n       intended to make some change in the existing law, and therefore the courts\n       will endeavor to give some effect to the amendment.61\n\nThis Court is thus bound to conclude that, in amending the statute to add Section\n\n91.406, the Legislature intended to change existing law and implement additional\n\nmandatory penalties over and above the statutory interest penalty on late payments\n\n―if the incentives were ignored and the royalty owner was forced to file suit. As a\n\nresult, once suit has been filed to collect proceeds or interest under the Resources\n\nCode, then even a late tender of proceeds or interest cannot completely extinguish\n\nthe Resources Code cause of action. A plaintiff is entitled to proceed to trial and\n\nprove the essential elements of this cause of action (i.e., breach by non-payment;\n60\n   CR. 238 and Appendix D (Background).\n61\n   American Surety Co. v. Axtell Co., 120 Tex. 166, 36 S.W.2d 715, 718 (Tex.1931) (internal\ncitations and quotations omitted).\n\n\n\n                                            15\n\fwritten notice of failure to pay timely; and no reasonable excuse for non-payment).\n\nIf all elements are proven, the plaintiff is entitled to a favorable judgment with a\n\nMinimum Award of $200 and reasonable attorney’s fees for the collection process.\n\nII.   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DETERMINING LEGISLATIVE INTENT AND\n      INTERPRETATION OF SECTION 91.406 OF THE TEXAS NATURAL RESOURCES\n      CODE.\n\n      Section 91.406 of the Texas Natural Resources Code states:\n\n      “Sec. 91.406. ATTORNEY'S FEES AND MINIMUM AWARD. If a\n      suit is filed to collect proceeds and interest under this subchapter, the court\n      shall include in any final judgment in favor of the plaintiff an award of:\n\n      (1) Reasonable attorney's fees; and\n      (2) If the actual damages to the plaintiff are less than $200, an additional\n      amount so that the total amount of damages equals $200.\n\n      (Emphasis added)\n\n      Genesis argued and the trial court apparently found that Section 91.406 was\n\nunambiguous, but ignored legislative intent and failed to construe the amended\n\nstatute as a whole. When language in a statute is unambiguous, we will seek the\n\nintent of the legislature as found in the plain and common meaning of the words\n\nand terms used.62\n\n      In interpreting a statute, a court must diligently attempt to ascertain\n\n62\n  St. Luke's Episcopal Hosp. v.

Acts 1983, 68th Leg. p.\n966, ch. 228, § 1. Four bills concerning this topic were introduced: HB 1775, SB 146, and\nidentical bills HB 1266 and SB 731. On April 12, 1983, the House Energy Committee considered\n\n                             Footnote continued on the next page.\n                                             19\n\f85\n     As a result, a new law was enacted in 1983 to allow the payee to “sue for failure\n\nto make timely payments after giving the payor 30 days’ written notice.” Id. In\n\naddition, to setting deadlines for timely payment, it required late payments to be\n\nsubject to an interest penalty, unless there was a reasonable title dispute.86 As the\n\nbill was being debated in 1983, prime rate was 10.5% and to prevent market rates\n\nfrom exceeding a proposed fixed 9-percent interest rate, creating an incentive to\n\nkeep royalty owners’ money, a floating rate of interest on late payments was tied to\n\nmarket conditions.87 In April 1987, even though market interest rates had fallen\n\n\n\nHB 1775 and HB 1226 together at public hearing.

While it was\ngenerally accepted that a great deal of these delays stem from legitimate title problems, it was\nalso recognized that some delays were intentional and should be addressed by the Legislature. It\nwas the admirable intent of our Legislature to compel timely payment of proceeds to\nroyalty interest owners by those persons or entities occupying the status of a ‘payor.’“ See\nalso, Koch v.

Therefore, the clearly stated intent and purpose of H.B. 2363 and\n\nenactment of a new law by the 70th Legislature in 1987,89 was to add the incentive\n\nof a mandatory MINIMUM AWARD of monetary damages and reasonable\n\nattorney’s fees in a final judgment “if a suit is filed to collect proceeds and interest\n\nfrom the sale of oil and gas production.”90\n\n\n\n\n91\n\n\n\n\nspecified in Section 91.402 of this code, the payor must pay interest to a payee beginning at the\nexpiration of those time limits at two percentage points above the percentage rate charged on\nloans to depository institutions by the New York Federal Reserve Bank, unless a different rate of\ninterest is specified in a written agreement between payor and payee.”\n88\n   The Court is asked to take judicial notice of the historical U.S. prime interest rate history from\n1980 through 1987.\n89\n   See, Appendix D.

Under the\n\nResources Code penalty enacted in 1983 under Sec. 91.403(c), the obligation to\n\npay interest as well as the right to receive interest terminated on delivery of the\n\nproceeds. Thus, even though Genesis did not tender the statutory interest penalty\n\nuntil June 25, 2014, the amount of the penalty was fixed on the date the proceeds\n\nwere finally paid, and the statutory interest penalty would never increase from that\n\nfixed amount – no matter how long or how much effort it took for Mrs. Garcia to\n\ncollect the interest due.\n\n      As a result, following the 1987 enactment of Resources Code Section\n\n91.406, unless the payor was able to establish a reasonable excuse for withholding\n\ntimely payment, the royalty owner was no longer limited to collection of interest,\n\nand was instead entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees and a minimum damage\n\naward as additional mandatory remedies if the essential elements of the Resources\n\nCode cause of action was proven in a court of law. There is no evidence elsewhere\n\nin the legislative history to support the theory that the incentive of being forced to\n\npay for the services of an attorney hired to collect unpaid royalty or interest and\n\n\n                                         22\n\ffile suit could be circumvented, defeated, nullified, thwarted -- and the penalties\n\navoided -- by merely waiting until the eve of trial to tender the final payment due.\n\n       The statute’s title is “ATTORNEY’S FEES and MINIMUM AWARD.”92 In\n\nadopting the amendment the Legislature intended to change the existing law, and\n\ntherefore the courts must give some effect to the amendment as a whole and\n\nunderstand the legal effect of the amendment enacted by the Legislature. By its\n\nplain terms and reading the statutory cause of action established under Sec.\n\n91.404(a)-(b) only requires the Payor to have failed to timely pay; and continue\n\nthat failure after receiving 30 days written notice without having a reasonable\n\ncause for non-payment,93 before suit can be filed to collect unpaid oil and gas\n\nproceeds or interest. If payment is not made within thirty days of receiving written\n\nnotice, and if there is no reasonable cause for nonpayment, judicial action can\n\ncommence and the statutory penalties of Section 91.406 are to be imposed, in\n\n92\n  See, Appendix B. TEXAS NATURAL RESOURCES CODE § 91.406 (emphasis added).\n93\n   See, Appendix B. TEXAS NATURAL RESOURCES CODE § 91.404. “NONPAYMENT OF OIL\nAND GAS PROCEEDS OR INTEREST. (a) If a payee seeks relief for the failure of a payor to\nmake timely payment of proceeds from the sale of oil or gas or an interest in oil or gas as\nrequired under Section 91.402 or 91.403 of this code, the payee must give the payor written\nnotice by mail of that failure as a prerequisite to beginning judicial action against the payor for\nnonpayment.\n(b) The payor has 30 days after receipt of the required notice from the payee in which to pay the\nproceeds due, or to respond by stating in writing a reasonable cause for nonpayment.\n(c) A payee has a cause of action for nonpayment of oil or gas proceeds or interest on those\nproceeds as required in Section 91.402 or 91.403 of this code in any court of competent\njurisdiction in the county in which the oil or gas well is located.”\n\n\n\n                                                23\n\faddition to statutory accrued interest. A defendant found to have violated the\n\nstatute was to be held liable for a minimum statutory award of $200 in actual\n\ndamages, plus reasonable attorney’s fees.\n\n         Genesis’ position would allow a payor to withhold payment for up to four\n\nyears (the limitations period) with “no incentive” to make timely payment—\n\nbecause they could entirely avoid payment of the $200 Minimum Award and\n\nthe attorney’s fee penalty—as long as payment was eventually made at any time\n\nprior to trial. Interest rates charged by the New York Federal Reserve since 2011\n\nhave been - for the most part – at or below 1/10th of 1%, and only being required to\n\npay $585.47 in statutory interest94 as the sole penalty for holding tens of thousands\n\nof dollars in unpaid royalties for almost three years and forcing a royalty owner to\n\nhire an attorney to collect the monies due, is a license to steal that was rejected and\n\nprevented by the 70th Legislature through the enactment of the new law in 1987.\n\nIII.

THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING “ACTUAL” MONETARY DAMAGES\n         ARE NECESSARY TO RECOVER A MINIMUM AWARD AND RECEIVE A\n         FAVORABLE FINAL JUDGMENT.\n\n94\n     CR. 257-271.\n\n\n                                          24\n\f       A.      THE LEGISLATURE IS NOT PRESUMED TO DO A USELESS ACT.\n\n       Texas courts should not adopt a construction that would render a law or\n\nprovision meaningless.95 In addition, the Legislature is not presumed to do a\n\nuseless act, and the law does not permit a wrong without a remedy.96\n\n       In 1987, the Legislature passed a new law adopting a Minimum Award of\n\n$200.00 and requiring mandatory reasonable attorney’s fees to be paid as\n\nadditional penalties, “if suit is filed to collect proceeds and interest under this\n\nsubchapter.”97 Genesis argues that under their construction and “plain meaning”\n\nof the statute, a royalty owner suing to collect unpaid proceeds and interest can\n\nnever file a lawsuit and receive a final judgment in their favor as long as the\n\n“actual damages” (of proceeds and interest) are paid before the case reaches trial.\n\nGenesis ignores the statute’s provision that “if actual damages ... are less than\n\n$200, an additional amount” is to be included, “so that the total amount of\n\ndamages equals $200.” It is mathematically axiomatic that ZERO (0) dollars (if\n\nproceeds and interest are paid on the eve of trial) are less than $200, and therefore\n\n95\n   Centurion Planning Corp. v.

GOV'T CODE ANN. § 311.021(2) (stating the presumption that the Legislature intends an\nentire statute to be effective); id. § 311.023(5) (West 2005) (providing that in construing statutes,\ncourts may consider the consequences of a particular construction).\n97\n   See, Appendix B. TEX. NATURAL RESOURCES CODE § 91.406.\n\n\n                                                 25\n\fan additional amount is to be included in the Minimum Award to ensure that actual\n\ndamages are at least $200.00. The “plain meaning” of less than $200.00, is Zero\n\nDollars (0) to Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00).\n\n       The Legislature’s addition of Section 91.406 to the Resources Code\n\nfundamentally altered the statute’s remedial scheme, by adding additional penalties\n\nas an incentive to make timely payments of proceeds and interest to royalty\n\nowners. Adopting the construction imposed by Genesis relegates statutory interest\n\ncalculated under Sec. 91.403 to be the only penalty – even if suit must be filed to\n\ncollect proceeds or interest – and renders the incentive penalties enacted under Sec.\n\n91.406 completely inoperative, superfluous, or useless.98\n\n       B.     GENESIS CANNOT RE-WRITE THE STATUTE                    TO   SAY “IF ACTUAL\n              DAMAGES ARE GREATER THAN ZERO.”\n\n       Genesis argued that because all proceeds and accrued interest had been paid\n\nafter suit was filed, Mrs. Garcia would not be entitled to a favorable judgment.\n\nCiting In re Nalle Plastics Family, L.P.,99 and other breach of contract cases,\n\nGenesis argued that there is no basis to award Mrs. Garcia a favorable judgment\n\nunder a Sec. 91.404 cause of action, because attorney’s fees are not “damages.”\n\n\n98\n   City of Marshall v. City of Uncertain, 206 S.W.3d 97, 105 (Tex. 2006); see also, Dunnagan v.\nWatson, 204 S.W.3d 30, 43 (Tex.App.―Fort Worth 2006, pet. denied).\n99\n   In re Nalle Plastics, 406 S.W.3d 168 (Tex. 2013).\n\n\n                                              26\n\f          While it is true that under a breach of contract, there must be a recovery of\n\nsome measure of economic damages before a plaintiff is entitled to recover\n\nattorney’s fees, the statutory scheme of a Resources Code recovery under Section\n\n91.406 is not so limiting. Genesis argues that Section 91.406 must be read as only\n\nentitling a plaintiff to an additional amount if damages are greater than zero. But\n\nthe Legislature did not write: “if the actual damages to the plaintiff are greater\n\nthan zero ...”. Instead the Legislature created a MINIMUM AWARD of $200.00\n\nin actual damages, and if actual damages are less than $200.00, then an award of\n\nan additional amount - so that the total amount of damages equals $200.00. The\n\nmathematical formula [0 + $200 = $200] is a fairly easy concept.\n\n          In addition, this is not the only statute that the Legislature has written which\n\nallows for an award of a minimum amount of damages and reasonable attorney’s\n\nfees, without proof of any actual damages. Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code\n\nSec. 12.002, awards the greater of $10,000.00 - or actual damages as a result of\n\nsomeone filing a fraudulent lien or claim against real property.100 Thus even if a\n\nplaintiff is found to have suffered no actual economic damages as a result of\n\nsomeone violating the fraudulent lien statute, there is still a $10,000 minimum\n\nstatutory recovery in actual damages [0 + $10,000 = $10,000]. In addition to the\n\n100\n      TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.

ONE SATISFACTION RULE DOES NOT APPLY.\n\n      After Mrs. Garcia’s contractual claim against the Oil Company Defendant\n\n(LTD) was severed and the Fourth Amended Petition was filed against Genesis,\n\nGenesis argued that it would be entitled to a settlement credit against the $200\n\n“mandatory Minimum Award” guaranteed by Section 91.406 of the Resources\n\nCode; and as a result, contended that Garcia would still be barred from recovering\n\nstatutory attorney’s fees for this tort. However, Gloria Garcia’s claim against LTD\n\nconcerned their contractual failure to pay royalties under the terms of the oil and\n\ngas lease with Garcia, which was a breach of contract claim.102 Section 91.402(h)\n\nof the Resources Code expressly states that this statute “shall not change or relieve\n\nthe lessee's specific, expressed or implied obligations under an oil and gas\n\nlease.”103\n\n\n101\n     TEX.

In addition to the\n\nabsence of joint liability under the Resources Code violation, Genesis is barred by\n\njudicial estoppel from now claiming joint liability or joint tortfeasor status with\n\nLTD.104 Genesis successfully obtained a partial summary judgment against LTD,\n\ntaking the position that “Garcia’s other claim under the Texas Natural Resources\n\nCode does not sound in tort, as that claim is expressly statutory.”105 In obtaining\n\npartial summary judgment, Genesis contended LTD had no exposure to any tort\n\nclaims and was not a joint tortfeasor. The doctrine of judicial estoppel “precludes\n\na party from adopting a position inconsistent with one that it maintained\n\nsuccessfully in an earlier proceeding.”106 The doctrine is not strictly speaking\n\nestoppel, but rather is a rule of procedure based on justice and sound public\n\npolicy.107 Its essential function “is to prevent the use of intentional self-\n\ncontradiction as a means of obtaining unfair advantage.”108 The species of judicial\n\nestoppel alleged in this case is “based on the principle that a party should not be\n104\n   CR.217-225.\n105\n    CR. 223-2224.\n106\n    Pleasant Glade Assembly of God v.

Baylor University, the one-satisfaction rule was first\n\narticulated as being derived from tort law principles of contribution.111 Just as in\n\nBradshaw, in Stewart Title112 the Texas Supreme Court emphasized that the\n\ndamages all arose from the “alleged misrepresentations of all the defendants,”113\n\nand in Crown Life,114 the Court again explained that under the one-satisfaction rule,\n\n“the non-settling defendant may only claim a credit based on the damages for\n\nwhich all tortfeasors are jointly liable.”115 The Crown Life Court went on to say\n\nthat “[s]eparate or punitive damages paid by the settling defendant” on his own\n\nbehalf cannot offset a judgment against a non-settling defendant, since such\n\n109\n    Metroflight, Inc. v.

Worthington Nat’l Bank,117 the Fifth Circuit held that\n\nwhere one claim sounds in contract and the other in tort, and the settling party and\n\nnon-settling party did not share a common theory of legal liability, then factual\n\ncommonality did not render Citibank a joint tortfeasor with Worthington for one-\n\nsatisfaction rule purposes.118\n\nV.      THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT GARCIA WAS NOT ENTITLED\n        PROCEED TO TRIAL.\n      A. THERE WAS A JUSTICIABLE CONTROVERSY.\n        Genesis argued that Mrs. Garcia was not entitled to proceed to trial, because\n\nher request for declaratory relief improperly duplicated the elements of her claim\n\nunder the Resources Code. However, the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act\n\n(UDJA) provides a basis by which a claimant can obtain a declaration of rights,\n\nstatus, or other legal relations under a writing or a statute.119 A suit under the\n\nUDJA is not confined to cases in which the parties have a cause of action apart\n\nfrom the Act itself.120 The Legislature intended the UDJA to be remedial, to settle\n\n\n116\n    Id. at 391–92.\n117\n     GE Capital Commercial, Inc. v.

This was not a\n\nhypothetical issue. Because Genesis had suspended funds since December 2010,\n\nand refused to timely pay proceeds and interest due to her, Mrs. Garcia had been\n\nforced to file suit for Nonpayment under the Texas Natural Resources Code.\n\nUnless Genesis had a reasonable cause for nonpayment,127 Mrs. Garcia was\n\nentitled to a declaration of her statutory right to proceed to trial, and obtain\n\nfindings by the trier of fact whether Genesis breached its duty to timely pay\n\nproceeds under the Resources Code; whether Mrs. Garcia had given the requisite\n\n30 day notice prior to filing suit under the provisions of the Resources Code; and\n\nwhether Genesis had a legitimate excuse for refusing to tender a division order\n\nand/or making timely payment.\n\n      Mrs. Garcia was relying on the UDJA to provide a basis to obtain a\n\ndeclaration of her rights, status, and remedies under statute.128 And while the\n\nCourt might have found Mrs. Garcia was entitled to reasonable and necessary fees\n\n\n\n\n127\n    See, Appendix B. TEXAS NATURAL RESOURCES CODE § 91.404(b): “The payor has 30 days\nafter receipt of the required notice from the payee in which to pay the proceeds due, or to\nrespond by stating in writing a reasonable cause for nonpayment.”\n128\n    See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 37.004 (West 1997); City of Waco, 83 S.W.3d at\n177.\n\n\n                                            33\n\funder the UDJA, she was relying on the Texas Natural Resources Code to establish\n\nher statutory right to recover reasonable attorney’s fees.\n\n          B. GARCIA WAS ENTITLED TO KEEP A BINDING DIVISION ORDER IN PLACE.\n\n            The UDJA may be used to clarify the meaning of statutes.129 Courts have\n\nalso issued declaratory judgments construing a statute before the statute is\n\nviolated.130 Genesis threw down the gauntlet in making what was actually a\n\n“conditional” tender of accrued interest on the late payments, by continuing to\n\nchallenge both past or future liability to Mrs. Garcia, and disputing whether it was\n\never “at any time” the statutory “Payor” under the lease—with a continuing duty to\n\nkeep in place a binding division order.131\n\n\n\n\n132\n      .     According to Sec. 91.402(e) of the Resources Code, division orders are\n\nbinding only for the time and to the extent that they have been acted on and made\n\nthe basis of settlements and payments – and from the time that notice is given\n\n129\n     Frasier v.

TEXAS NATURAL RESOURCES CODE § 91.402(e) (“Division orders are\nbinding for the time and to the extent that they have been acted on and made the basis of\nsettlements and payments, and, from the time that notice is given that settlements will not be\nmade on the basis provided in them, they cease to be binding.”) (emphasis added).\n134\n     See, Appendix B. TEXAS NATURAL RESOURCES CODE § 91.402(e) (“Division orders are\nterminable by either party on 30 days written notice.”), see also, Phillips Petroleum Co. v.\nWilliams, 158 F.2d 723, 727 (5th Cir. 1946).\n135\n    Prize Energy Res., L.P. v. Cliff Hoskins, Inc., 345 S.W.3d 537, 560 (Tex.App.―San Antonio\n2011, no pet.).\n136\n    CR. 69-70, 72.\n\n\n                                             35\n\fa “take nothing” judgment.137 The trial court erred in making a determination that\n\nstatutory interest under Section 91.403(a) of the Texas Natural Resources Code\n\nwas the only mandatory penalty – even if suit was filed to collect unpaid oil and\n\ngas proceeds and interest. The trial court erred in determining that if suit was filed,\n\nthe Minimum Award of $200.00 under Section 91.406 of the Texas Natural\n\nResources Code meant a plaintiff must have actual damages “greater than zero” at\n\nthe time of trial, instead of “less than $200.00.” The trial court erred in refusing to\n\nconsider the Legislature’s intent in enacting a $200 Minimum Award and\n\nattorney’s fees under Section 91.406, and declaring that Gloria Garcia was entitled\n\nto a “take nothing” judgment on this claim. Finally, the trial court erred in\n\npreventing Mrs. Garcia from proceeding to trial on the essential elements of the\n\nResources Code lawsuit, or obtaining a declaration of the continuing duties and\n\nobligations of the parties under Section 91 of the Texas Natural Resources Code.\n\n          Accordingly, this Court should reverse the trial court’s order granting\n\nGenesis’ Motion for Final Summary Judgment to the extent it ruled that Gloria\n\nGarcia “take nothing” on the cause of action established under Texas Natural\n\nResources Code Section 91.404, as it was not extinguished by late payment of\n\nproceeds and statutory interest.    This Court should also reverse the order of the\n\n137\n      See, Appendix A.\n\n\n                                          36\n\ftrial court that granted Genesis a favorable judgment on Gloria Garcia’s Texas\n\nNatural Resources Section 91.406 claim of a Minimum Award of $200.00, and\n\nreasonable attorney’s fees.\n\n      After reversing the trial court, this Court should render as follows:\n      1.    That a suit filed to collect proceeds and interest under the Texas\nNatural Resources Code Section 91.404 cause of action, is not extinguished by\npayment of proceeds and statutory interest.\n\n       2.     That the statutory interest penalty established under Texas Natural\nResources Code Section 91.403 is not the only mandatory penalty to be imposed, if\na plaintiff has filed suit to collect proceeds and interest.\n      3.     That a plaintiff is entitled to a favorable final judgment if he or she\ncan establish the essential elements of a cause of action filed under Texas Natural\nResources Code Section 91.404.\n       4.     That “if actual damages ... are less than $200.00” means that a\nplaintiff who files suit to collect proceeds and interest under the Texas Natural\nResources Code and establishes the essential elements of the Section 91.404 cause\nof action, is entitled to a Minimum Award of $200, and if actual damages at trial\nare zero, “an additional amount so that the total amount of damages equals $200,”\nplus reasonable attorney’s fees.\n\n       5.     That Genesis failed to make timely payments of oil and gas proceeds\nto Gloria Garcia after December 1, 2010; Gloria Garcia gave written notice of the\nfailure to pay as a prerequisite to beginning judicial action for nonpayment; more\nthan 30 days elapsed after notice was given before suit was filed; Genesis had no\nreasonable cause for non-payment; and Gloria Garcia filed suit to collect proceeds\nand interest under the Texas Natural Resources Code.\n\n       6.    That Gloria Garcia is entitled to a Minimum Award of $200.00 in\nactual damages and $51,786.50, as a fair and reasonable fee for the necessary legal\nservices rendered to Gloria Garcia through July 23, 2014.\n\n\n\n\n                                         37\n\f      With respect to reasonable attorney's fees incurred by Gloria Garcia since\n\nJuly 23, 2014, this Court should remand the case for trial before a jury, for this\n\nlimited purpose. This Court should further grant all other relief, at law or in\n\nequity, to which Gloria Garcia is entitled.\n\n                                        Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                       James R.

Purchaser shall compute quantity and make corrections for gravity and\ntemperature and make deductions for impurities.\n\n       PAYMENT: From the effective date, payment is to be made monthly by\npayor's check, based on this division of interest, for oil run during the\npreceding calendar month from the property listed above, less taxes required\nby law to be deducted and remitted by payor as purchaser. Payments of less\nthan $100 may be accrued before disbursement until the total amount equals\n$100 or more, or until 12 months' proceeds accumulate, whichever occurs\nfirst. However, the payor may hold accumulated proceeds of less than $10\nuntil production ceases or the payor's responsibility for making payment for\nproduction ceases, whichever occurs first.

Any provision of a division order between payee\nand its lessee which is in contradiction with any provision of an oil and gas\nlease is invalid to the extent of the contradiction.\n\n       (i) A division order may be used to clarify royalty settlement terms\nin the oil and gas lease. With respect to oil and/or gas sold in the field\nwhere produced or at a gathering point in the immediate vicinity, the terms\n\"market value,\" \"market price,\" \"prevailing price in the field,\" or other\nsuch language, when used as a basis of valuation in the oil and gas lease,\nshall be defined as the amount realized at the mouth of the well by the\nseller of such production in an arm's-length transaction.\n\nAdded by Acts 1983, 68th Leg., p. 966, ch. 228, Sec. 1, eff.

The bill would require that payments to\n                 each person entitled to a share of the proceeds\n                 from the production be made within 120 days after\n                 the end of the month of the first sale of the\n                 output of an oil or gas well. The bill also sets\n                 deadlines for payments from subsequent sales.\n                 Late payments would be subject to an interest\n                 penalty, unless payment was withheld because of\n                 a title dispute affecting allocation of the proceeds or\n                 because of a reasonable question concerning either\n                 the payee's entitlement to share in the proceeds\n                 or the payee's whereabouts. A payee could sue\n                 for failure to make timely payments after giving\n                 the payor 30 days' written notice.\n                 Current law is totally vague as to deadlines for\n                 royalty payments. Most l~ases don't specify deadlines\n                 either, and there is no law specifically protecting\n                 Texas royalty owners from deliberate delay of\n                 their royalty checks. Many delays stem from legiti-\n                 mate questions about the validity of titles or\n                 the whereabouts of royalty owners. But some oil\n                 operators have raised title questions just to\n                 put off payments.\n                 The drilling boom a few years ago brought a lot\n                 of new investors into the Texas oil and gas business,\n                 including some fly-by-night operators, high interest\n                 rates gave marginal operators an incentive to\n                 hold onto other people's money as long as possible.\n                 Increased bankruptcies caused by the recent decline\n                 in the industry have aggravated problems of late\n                 payment and nonpayment. HB 646, by Craddick,\n                 already passed by the House, addresses the problem\n                 of bankruptcies more directly. But HB 1775 is\n                 also needed, to establish some guidelines in cases\nEXHIBIT\n                 of late payment and nonpayment. All the associations\n                 of producers and royalty owners support this bill.\n\n 5                               \")\")\n\n                                                                                                    00229\n                                              Cause No.DC-12-200; Gloria Garcia vs. Genesis Crude Oil, L.

A moderately long grace period\n(ccmtinued)   is needed at the beginning of a drilling and produc-\n              tion operation. Sometimes a well is drilled and\n              starts producing before all title questions are\n              reJolved. It.may take 30 to 45 days to get an\n              abstract, and another 30 ·to 45 days to get a title\n              opinion. Sometimes royalty owners delay in respon-\n              ding to division orders. When drilling starts\n              may also be influenced by the expiration date\n              of a lease or the availability of drilling rigs.\n              Title questions may be very cqmplex-~East Texas,\n              for example, is full of title problems, with missing\n              people, split interests, and improperly-worded\n              deeds.\n              Specifying a fixed 9-percent interest rate to\n              be added to late payments will simplify accounting\n              procedures.\n              ~he  oil industry would not support a proposal\n              to require that royalty payments be put in escrow\n              until title questions are resolved. This would\n              ~equire having to set up too many accounts.    Wyoming\n              has an escrow requirement, and oil operators have\n              had a lot of problems with it. An esc~ow requirement\n              would be unfair to legitim~te oil companies, which\n              mijy already be burdened with extra expenses when\n              title questions are involved.\n              There is no need for an additional provision cequicing\n              pijyment deadlines in future leases, as some have\n              proposed. Royalty owners would be sufficiently\n              protected under this bill. Leases may include\n              payment-deadline agreements under existing law.\nOPPONENTS     ~his   bill would allow routine delays of 120 to\nSAY:          lSO days in making royalty payments, depending\n              on which day of the month the oil or gas was sold,\n              even in cases when there are no title problems.\n              This is too long. The bill should be amended\n              to set a 60- or 90-day deadline, except when title\n              problems give reasonable cause for delay.\n              The bill should be amended to specify a floating\n              interest rate on late payments, tied to market\n              conditions. Otherwise, when market interestrates\n              exceed the statutory rate, payors would have an\n              incentive to keep royalty own~rs' mpney longer\n              than they should.\n\n\n\n\n                             23\n\n                                                                                                   00230\n                                            Cause No.DC-12-200; Gloria Garcia vs. Genesis Cru.de Oil, L. p_:\n\f                             HB 1775\n                           page three\n\nOPPONENTS     The bill should be amended to require that, when\nSAY:          payment is delayed because of a title question,\n(continued)   the royalty money must be put in an escrow account.\n              If the money is not placed in escrow, royalty\n              owners run a greater risk when a producer goes\n              bankrupt or an unscrupulous operator absconds.\n              The bill should require that all future leases\n              contain payment deadlines at least as stringent\n              as those specified in the bill. This would give\n              more notice to royalty owners of their protection\n              against late payments.\nNOTES:        SB 731, by Traeger, and its companion HB 1266,\n              by Coody, would require payment within 60 days\n              of the date of first sale, and within 45 days\n              after the end of the calendar month of subsequent\n              sales. SB 731 and HB 1266 specify a 12-percent\n              interest rate on late payments, require that payments\n              delayed due to title questions be put in a separate\n              account, allow payees to recover court costs and\n              attorney's fees when they win a judgment involving\n              a late payment, and specify that, if payment is\n              delayed to any person pending determination of\n              valid title or location of the payee, the delay\n              would not affect the timeliness of payment owed\n              to other royalty owners. SB 731 has been referred to\n              the Senate Natural Resources Committee. HB 1266\n              was heard in the House Energy Committee on April 12,\n              with no action taken.\n              SB 146, by Blake, would require that royalty payments\n              be made within 90 days of first sale, with an\n              annual interest rate of 18 percent on the unpaid\n              balance of late payments. SB 146 would require\n              oil and gas exploration and production leases\n              to state payment deadlines and would allow royalty\n              owners who win court judgments in cases of late\n              payment to recover court costs and dttorney's\n              fees. SB 146 has been referred to the Senate\n              Natural Resources Committee.\n              HB 846, by Craddick, has been passed by the House\n              and was scheduled for a hearing in the Senate\n              Natural Resources Committee on April 20. HB 846\n              would provide an automatic security interest (secured\n              claim) f~r owners and royalty-holders that would\n              allow them a priority claim against a purchase~\n              who failed to pay.\n\n\n\n\n                           24\n\n                                                                                              00231.\n                                        Cause No.DC-12-200; Gloria Garcia vs. Genesis Crude Oil, L.

B. 2363                                   Committee on Energy\nBy: Hackney\n\n\nBackground\nChapter 91 of the Natural Resources Code deals with regulation of\noil and gas production by the Railroad Commission of Texas, In\n1983, the 68th Legislature amended Chapter 91 by adding\nSubchapter K, which provides that a person or persons entitled to\npayment from the proceeds derived from the sale of oil or gas has\na cause of action for nonpayment in a court of competent\njurisdiction. Since many of these claims involve relatively\nsmall amounts of money, it is sometimes difficult for an\nindividual to have a cause resolved in court.\n\nPurpose\nH.B. 2363 would add an incentive of reasonable attorney's fees\nand a minimum award in any final judgement in favor of the\nplaintiff in cases involving nonpayment of oil and gas proceeds\nand interest on late payments.\n\nSynopais\nH.B. 2363 amends Subchapter K, Chapter 91 of the Natural\nResources Code by adding Section 91.406, providing that if a suit\nis filed to collect proceeds and interest from the sale of oil\nand gas production, the court shall include reasonable attorney's\nfees and a minimum award of $200 in any final judgement in favor\nof the plaintiff.\n\nRulemaking Authority\nIt is the opinion of the committee that this bill does not\ndelegate any rulemalting authority to a state agency, officer,\ndepartment, or institution.\n\nsummary of Committee Action\nH.B. 2363 was considered in a public hearing on April 27, 1987.\nTestifying for the bill was Seldon B. Graham, Jr., attorney,\nrepresenting himself. Nat testifying, but appearing to register\n~upport for the bill were; Warren R.  Anderson, representing the\nNational Association of Royalty OWners; Morris Burns,\nrepresenting the West Central Texas Oil and Gas Association; Joe\nc. Hanna, representing TIPRO, North Texas Oil and Gas, and a\nnumber of other oil and gas associations, Dan Jones, representing\nthe East Texas Producers and Royalty OWners Association; and\nScott Anderson, representing TIPRO. There were no other\nwitnesses, At the April 27, 1987 meeting a motion was made to\nreport H.B. 2363 favorably, with the recommendation that it be\nplaced on the consent calendar. The motion carried by a vote of 7\nayes, 0 nays, 0 PNV, and 2 absent.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                  00238\n                                            Cause No.DC-12-200; Gloria Garcia vs. Genesis Crude Oil, L.

The new penalties imposed by the Legislature\n\nwere to be an additional incentive to force the Payor to make timely payment of\n\nroyalties, as the statutory interest penalty imposed in 1983 on late payments\n\nestablished under Texas Natural Resources Code § 91.403 was not getting the job\n\ndone. The parties dispute whether the cause of action established under Texas\n\nNatural Resources Code § 91.404 to collect unpaid proceeds and interest can be\n\nextinguished ― and the additional penalties to be imposed under Section 91.406\n\nnullified and voided, if late payment of oil and gas proceeds and interest is finally\n\ntendered – albeit after suit had to be filed.\n\n         On motion for summary judgment filed by the Defendant Genesis Crude Oil,\n\nL.P.,1 the trial court found as a matter of law that the additional late payment\n\npenalties enacted under Section 91.406 were not mandatory and were extinguished\n\n\n1\n    CR. 158\n\n\n                                            x\n\fif late payment was tendered at any point prior to trial.2 As a result, the trial court\n\nfound the royalty owner was not entitled to collect either the Minimum Award or\n\nreasonable attorney’s fees for being forced to bring a lawsuit.3 In so doing, the\n\ntrial court rejected both the law’s requirements and the legislative intent to add\n\nadditional mandatory penalties over and above statutory interest, if a lawsuit had to\n\nbe filed because of non-payment of oil and gas proceeds or interest on late\n\npayments.4\n\n       By its ruling, the trial court also rejected the correct standard in making a\n\ndetermination that since late payments and interest had been finally paid, without\n\nfurther monetary damages Gloria Garcia was not entitled to a favorable judgment,\n\nthe Minimum Award of $200 and recovery of reasonable attorney’s fees, or a\n\ndeclaration of the rights of the parties in an ongoing and continuing relationship.5\n\n\n\n\n2\n  CR. 296.

This case involves important issues involving the rights of\n\nroyalty owners, statutory interpretation, and legislative history, and the Court\n\nwould be aided by oral argument. Moreover, any ruling in this case, which would\n\ninvolve issues of first impression, would have significant effect on the relationship\n\nbetween royalty interest owners and operators, especially on the rights of royalty\n\ninterest owners to their royalties and the remedies they have in the event operators\n\nfail to pay those timely. For these reasons, the Appellant believes that oral\n\nargument should be granted.\n\n\n\n\n                                         xii\n\f                                 ISSUES ON APPEAL\n\n                                     ISSUE NO. 1\n\nWhether the trial court erred in determining as a matter of law, that a cause of\naction under Texas Natural Resources Code § 91.404(a)-(b) can be extinguished,\nand the additional penalties to be imposed under Texas Natural Resources Code §\n91.406 nullified and voided even if a suit is filed, as long as the Payor tendered late\npayment of oil and gas proceeds and interest before a trial commences.\n\n                                     ISSUE NO. 2\n\nWhether the trial court erred in determining as a matter of law, that statutory\ninterest imposed under Texas Natural Resources Code § 91.403 provides the only\nmandatory penalty for late payments, even if the Payee has been forced to file suit\nto collect unpaid oil and gas proceeds and interest.\n\n                                     ISSUE NO. 3\n\nWhether the trial court erred in determining as a matter of law, that in order to be\nentitled to recover the statutory Minimum Award of $200.00 and reasonable\nattorney’s fees under Texas Natural Resources Code § 91.406 if suit is filed, the\nPayee must still recover “actual” monetary damages in order to be entitled to\nfavorable final judgment.\n\n                                     ISSUE NO. 4\n\nWhether the trial court erred in determining as a matter of law that the statutory\nlanguage of Texas Natural Resources Code § 91.406 was plain and unambiguous,\nwhich precluded an inquiry into the legislative intent of enacting additional\nmandatory penalties if suit had to be filed, as an incentive to force the Payor to\ntimely pay proceeds from the sale of oil and gas.\n\n\n\n\n                                         xiii\n\f                                  ISSUE NO. 5\n\nWhether the trial court erred in denying Garcia’s right to proceed to trial to\nestablish the essential elements of her claim:\n\n      a.

Genesis was not excused from making a timely payment of oil and gas\n            proceeds, as there was no legitimate title dispute;\n\n      c.

THE MINERAL OWNERSHIP\n\n     A. 1994 - OIL & GAS LEASE WITH UVALDE ENERGY CORPORATION.\n\n     On August 3, 1994, Gloria Garcia and her father, Willie De La Fuente (now\n\ndeceased) as Lessors, executed and delivered an Oil, Gas and Liquid Hydrocarbons\n\nLease to Uvalde Energy Corporation, Lessee, for the purpose of drilling and\n\nproducing oil, gas, and all other liquid and hydrocarbons.6 The lease was for a\n\nterm of two (2) years from the date of its execution and as long thereafter as oil or\n\ngas was produced from the land by the Lessee in paying quantities, and was filed\n\nfor record.7\n\n     Gloria Garcia’s ownership interest in the 164.16 acre ranch was memorialized\n\nby Gift Deed from her father, Willie De La Fuente, filed for record in Duval\n\nCounty, Texas on November 7, 1994.8 This conveyance to Mrs. Garcia of the\n\nentire fee simple surface and an undivided one-half of the mineral estate was\n\nsubsequently corrected to reflect the reservation of a life estate in the right to\n\nreceive rents and royalties by Willie De La Fuente until his death, which\n\n\n\n\n6\n  CR. 30-40.\n7\n  Id..\n8\n  Supp.CR. 11-12, 61-62.\n\n\n                                         1\n\finstrument was filed for record on December 29, 1994.9 A final Correction Deed\n\nwas executed by Willie De La Fuente to reflect gifts to Mrs. Garcia of mineral\n\ninterests in additional property also located in Duval County, still subject to the\n\nlife estate being reserved by Willie De La Fuente, which was dated March 5, 1995,\n\nbut filed for record on October 19, 1995.10\n\n     B. 1998 - CHANGE IN LESSOR AND PAYOR.\n\n       In 1998, LTD Explorations, Inc. (“LTD”) took an assignment of the Willie\n\nDe La Fuente lease from Uvalde Energy Corporation, and assumed the contractual\n\nlease obligations as the new owner/operator.11 LTD then contracted with Genesis\n\nCrude Oil, LP (“Genesis”) to be the first purchaser of the oil produced from the\n\nsubject lease.12 As a result, on August 14, 1998, Genesis acquired an interest in the\n\noil production and lease and assumed the obligations of a Payor under the Texas\n\nNatural Resources Code, issuing two Division Orders in favor of Willie De La\n\nFuente under Lease No. 54546000, both made effective retroactively to July 1,\n\n1998.13\n\n\n\n\n9\n  Supp.CR. 12, 64-65.\n10\n    Supp.CR. 12, 67-68.\n11\n   CR. 67-68.\n12\n   Id.\n13\n   Supp.CR. 12, 103-104.\n\n\n                                         2\n\f     Willie De La Fuente passed away on December 12, 2008.14 On April 26,\n\n2011, Mrs. Garcia wrote a letter to LTD Exploration (the lessor and operator) and\n\nprovided copies of the Death Certificate and Gift Deed to establish that her royalty\n\nownership had fully vested.15 Receiving no response, on July 12, 2011, Mrs.\n\nGarcia’s attorney, Mark R. Paisley, wrote directly to Genesis concerning Mr. De\n\nLa Fuente’s death back in 2008, which triggered their duty to issue Mrs. Garcia\n\nnew Division Orders in place of Willie De La Fuente, and begin payment of oil\n\nand gas proceeds under the lease.16 Although Paisley wrote and later called\n\nGenesis relating to royalty payments, Genesis never responded.17 Mrs. Garcia\n\nfinally hired attorney James Harris, who again gave written notice to Genesis on\n\nJanuary 24, 2013, of their continued failure to pay royalties and accrued interest to\n\nwhich she was entitled, and provided Genesis with another copy of the 2008 Death\n\nCertificate of Mr. De La Fuente.18\n\n     Genesis failed to pay the oil and gas proceeds due within 30 days after receipt\n\nof the required notice and demand for payment of past due royalties in January of\n\n\n\n\n14\n   Supp.CR. 12, 70.\n15\n   Supp.CR. 12, 70, 72-77.\n16\n   Supp.CR. 12, 79.\n17\n   Supp.CR. 12, 106.\n18\n   Supp.CR. 12, 83-99.\n\n\n                                         3\n\f2013,19 and Genesis had no reasonable cause to dispute Mrs. Garcia’s entitlement\n\nto payment, as it was on constructive and actual notice of her right to be paid\n\nroyalties upon proof of death of her father, and Mrs. Garcia’s title was a matter of\n\npublic record.20 Her recorded title in 1994 long-preceded the transfer of lease to\n\nLTD in 1998, and Genesis Crude Oil, L.P. did not begin purchasing production\n\nfrom the lease until July 1, 1998.21 Genesis willfully refused to respond to Mr.\n\nHarris’ attempts to collect the unpaid royalties in Mrs. Garcia’s behalf.\n\n     C. THE UNDERLYING TEXAS NATURAL RESOURCES CODE LITIGATION.\n\n      Since receiving notice in 2011, both Genesis and LTD disputed liability for\n\ntendering timely royalty payments to Mrs. Garcia from the sale of oil and gas, and\n\nrefused to issue division orders. As a result, six months after sending the January\n\n24, 2013 demand letter to Genesis, Mrs. Garcia amended an environmental\n\nproperty damage lawsuit already pending against the lease owner/operator (LTD)\n\non July 19, 2013, to include both contractual and statutory claims under Texas\n\nNatural Resources Code for non-payment of royalties and interest accruing since\n\n\n\n19\n   CR. 187, Supp.CR. 12, 83; TEX.

Mrs. Garcia issued a subpoena for\n\nrecords from Genesis on September 18, 2013, seeking information regarding the\n\namount of oil and gas being produced and purchased from the lease, and to\n\ndetermine the relationship between Genesis and the Lessee/Operator pertaining to\n\nthe responsibility to issue division orders and pay proceeds to royalty owners.25 On\n\nJanuary 23, 2014, LTD joined Genesis in the pending lawsuit and Mrs. Garcia\n\nbecame aware that LTD had entered into an agreement with Genesis, whereby the\n\n\n22\n   CR. 21-40.\n23\n   Id.\n24\n   CR. 21-40, and 80-81, 101.\n25\n   TEXAS NATURAL RESOURCES CODE § 91.401(2) [“\"Payor\" means the party who undertakes to\ndistribute oil and gas proceeds to the payee, whether as the purchaser of the production of oil or\ngas generating such proceeds or as operator of the well from which such production was\nobtained or as lessee under the lease on which royalty is due.”]. See, Appendix B.\n\n\n                                                5\n\fpurchaser (Genesis) was to be responsible for payment of the proceeds from the\n\nsale of oil or gas to the royalty owner. 26 Mrs. Garcia also learned at that time that\n\nLTD had made demand upon Genesis to perform its statutory obligations to issue a\n\ndivision order and pay over the royalty proceeds due to Mrs. Garcia, which LTD\n\nalleged Genesis had collected and was holding in suspense.27 LTD’s efforts to\n\nobtain cooperation from Genesis to make full payment of Garcia’s royalties and\n\naccrued interest were unsuccessful.28\n\n     In April 2014, Genesis requested a continuance and the July 28, 2014 trial\n\ndate was postponed again to November 17, 2014.29       On June 4, 2014, Mrs. Garcia\n\nfiled her third amended petition joining Genesis as a direct defendant, seeking a\n\ndeclaration of her statutory rights and all damages to which she was entitled under\n\nthe statute, including accrued interest, and the reasonable attorney’s fees mandated\n\nunder Texas Natural Resources Code § 91.406.30 Mrs. Garcia asserted that as a\n\nresult of having to file suit under Section 91.404, she was not only entitled to\n\nstatutory interest on late payments due under § 91.403(a), but also the statutory\n\nMinimum Award of monetary damages and attorney’s fees imposed under §\n\n\n26\n   CR. 43 at ¶ 3.2.\n27\n   Id.\n28\n   CR. 41-48.\n29\n   CR. 49.\n30\n   CR. 51-60, at 57.

PARTIAL PAYMENTS BY GENESIS\n       After Mrs. Garcia was forced to file suit on July 19, 2013 for “Nonpayment\n\nof Oil and Gas Proceeds or Interest” under the Texas Natural Resources Code and\n\nsubpoenaed records from Genesis, two division orders were finally prepared and\n\nsubmitted by Genesis to Mrs. Garcia to be effective retroactively to December 1,\n\n2010 and January 1, 2011 (respectively) and Genesis made a partial tender of\n\naccrued royalties on November 1, 2013.33 However, Genesis refused to pay Mrs.\n\nGarcia the statutory accrued interest due under Section 91.403(a) of the Texas\n\nNatural Resources Code. As a result, Genesis was joined as a party to the lawsuit\n\non January 23, 2014,34 and named a direct defendant on June 5, 2014.35    Genesis\n\ncontinued to deny liability, asserting (among other defenses) that Mrs. Garcia had\n\n\n\n\n31\n   Id.

Mrs. Garcia also\n\nestablished that the attorney’s fees being sought were both reasonable, necessary,\n\nand incurred against the defendant sought to be charged with said fees.43 The\n\nattorney’s fee claim against Genesis related to far more than three weeks of\n\n39\n   CR. 94-102, at 98 ¶ B [“...plaintiff is required to show that the fees were incurred while suing\nthe defendant sought to be charged with the fees on a claim which allows recovery of such fees.”\n(citing) Stewart Title Co. v.

Thus,\n\nGenesis argued that allowing Mrs. Garcia to recover her attorney’s fees and a\n\nMinimum Award of $200 established under Section 91.406, would be “redundant\n\nto the remedy of statutory interest provided in Section 91.403 of the Resources\n\nCode” an[d] “creates a double penalty where it does not exist.”52 Genesis argued\n\nthat “Section 91.403 provides the mandatory remedy for any late payments,\n\nstatutory interest.”53 As a result, Genesis argued the court should not look to the\n\nstatute’s legislature history, because the plain meaning of Section 91.406 was\n\nunambiguous54 and required a judgment for proceeds or interest as “actual\n\ndamages” at the time of trial, in order for the judgment to be “favorable” to the\n\nplaintiff.55\n\n       Genesis’ Amended Motion for “Final” Summary Judgment stated the only\n\nthree issues in the case were (1) whether the Sec. 91.404 cause of action for\n52\n   CR. 284. See, Appendix B.\n53\n   CR. 286 @ ¶ 2.\n54\n   CR. 286 @ ¶ 1.\n55\n   CR. 285.\n\n\n                                         12\n\f“Nonpayment of Oil and Gas Proceeds or Interest” remained following payment;\n\n(2) if no Section 91.404 cause of action still exists, whether an independent cause\n\nof action existed allowing recovery of attorney’s fees; and (3) whether a party\n\ncould replead the Sec. 91.404 cause of action for non-payment as a Chapter 37\n\ndeclaratory judgment action and recover attorney’s fees.\n\n          The trial court erred by granting a final “take nothing” judgment that the\n\nadditional remedies to be afforded under Texas Natural Resources Code Section\n\n91.406, if suit had to be filed were not available, because the Section 91.404(c)\n\ncause of action established under the Texas Natural Resources Code had been\n\nextinguished following Genesis’ late payment of oil and gas proceeds and statutory\n\naccrued interest.56\n\n                                      ARGUMENT\n\nI.        THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THE CAUSE OF ACTION FOR\n          NONPAYMENT OF OIL AND GAS PROCEEDS OR INTEREST UNDER SECTION\n          91.404 OF THE RESOURCES CODE WAS EXTINGUISHED BY LATE PAYMENT.\n\n          Genesis contends that Section 91.404 created only one cause of action, and\n\nthe affirmative defense of payment (albeit late) for proceeds on November 1, 2013\n\nand late payment of statutory interest on June 25, 2014, extinguished the Resources\n\n\n\n56\n     See, Appendix A.\n\n\n                                          13\n\fCode cause of action for Nonpayment of Oil and Gas Proceeds Or Interest.57 Prior\n\nto the 1987 enactment of Section 91.406, Genesis’ interpretation of the law would\n\nhave been correct. However, following the addition of Section 91.406, statutory\n\ninterest for late payments was no longer the only mandatory penalty to be imposed,\n\nif suit was filed to collect proceeds and interest.\n\n       The sole purpose and legislative intent for adding Section 91.406 to the\n\nTexas Natural Resources Code was to provide “that if a suit is filed to collect\n\nproceeds and interest from the sale of oil and gas proceeds, the court shall include\n\nreasonable attorney’s fees and a minimum award of $200” as an additional\n\nincentive for the Payor to timely make payments.58                Despite the 68th Texas\n\nLegislature enacting strict time deadlines for payment in 1983, the 70 th Legislature\n\nrecognized that it was still very difficult for an individual with a claim for unpaid\n\nroyalty to obtain relief in a court of law under the Resources Code.59 Thus,\n\nrecovery of a minimum award and mandatory attorney’s fees were added as\n\nadditional remedies to persons forced to file suit under the Sec. 91.404 cause of\n\naction established in 1983 by the 68th Legislature, for nonpayment of proceeds and\n\n\n\n\n57\n   CR. 162-163. See, Appendix B.\n58\n   CR. 238 and Appendix D (Tex. H.B. 2363,70th Leg., R.S. – Bill Analysis: Purpose; Synopsis).\n59\n   See, CR. 238 and Appendix D (Tex. H.B. 2363,70th Leg., R.S. – Bill Analysis: Background).\n\n\n                                              14\n\finterest.60\n\n       In American Surety Co. v. Axtell Co., the Texas Supreme Court established\n\nthe steps in interpreting a statute:\n\n       To arrive at the intention of the Legislature ... it is the duty ... to look\n       primarily to the act itself as an entirety; and to understand the legal effect of\n       the amendment enacted by the Legislature, it must be considered in\n       connection with the original act, and that which has been done thereunder. A\n       particular section of an act of the Legislature, when enacted, must be\n       construed in view of the existence of the original statute as it stands after the\n       amendment is introduced; it and all sections of the old law must be regarded\n       as a harmonious whole, as connected with and naturally acting upon each\n       other.... It will be presumed that the Legislature, in adopting the amendment,\n       intended to make some change in the existing law, and therefore the courts\n       will endeavor to give some effect to the amendment.61\n\nThis Court is thus bound to conclude that, in amending the statute to add Section\n\n91.406, the Legislature intended to change existing law and implement additional\n\nmandatory penalties over and above the statutory interest penalty on late payments\n\n―if the incentives were ignored and the royalty owner was forced to file suit. As a\n\nresult, once suit has been filed to collect proceeds or interest under the Resources\n\nCode, then even a late tender of proceeds or interest cannot completely extinguish\n\nthe Resources Code cause of action. A plaintiff is entitled to proceed to trial and\n\nprove the essential elements of this cause of action (i.e., breach by non-payment;\n60\n   CR. 238 and Appendix D (Background).\n61\n   American Surety Co. v.

THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DETERMINING LEGISLATIVE INTENT AND\n      INTERPRETATION OF SECTION 91.406 OF THE TEXAS NATURAL RESOURCES\n      CODE.\n\n      Section 91.406 of the Texas Natural Resources Code states:\n\n      “Sec. 91.406. ATTORNEY'S FEES AND MINIMUM AWARD. If a\n      suit is filed to collect proceeds and interest under this subchapter, the court\n      shall include in any final judgment in favor of the plaintiff an award of:\n\n      (1) Reasonable attorney's fees; and\n      (2) If the actual damages to the plaintiff are less than $200, an additional\n      amount so that the total amount of damages equals $200.\n\n      (Emphasis added)\n\n      Genesis argued and the trial court apparently found that Section 91.406 was\n\nunambiguous, but ignored legislative intent and failed to construe the amended\n\nstatute as a whole. When language in a statute is unambiguous, we will seek the\n\nintent of the legislature as found in the plain and common meaning of the words\n\nand terms used.62\n\n      In interpreting a statute, a court must diligently attempt to ascertain\n\n62\n  St. Luke's Episcopal Hosp. v.

Acts 1983, 68th Leg. p.\n966, ch. 228, § 1. Four bills concerning this topic were introduced: HB 1775, SB 146, and\nidentical bills HB 1266 and SB 731. On April 12, 1983, the House Energy Committee considered\n\n                             Footnote continued on the next page.\n                                             19\n\f85\n     As a result, a new law was enacted in 1983 to allow the payee to “sue for failure\n\nto make timely payments after giving the payor 30 days’ written notice.” Id. In\n\naddition, to setting deadlines for timely payment, it required late payments to be\n\nsubject to an interest penalty, unless there was a reasonable title dispute.86 As the\n\nbill was being debated in 1983, prime rate was 10.5% and to prevent market rates\n\nfrom exceeding a proposed fixed 9-percent interest rate, creating an incentive to\n\nkeep royalty owners’ money, a floating rate of interest on late payments was tied to\n\nmarket conditions.87 In April 1987, even though market interest rates had fallen\n\n\n\nHB 1775 and HB 1226 together at public hearing. The House Study Group reported on the bill\non April 21, 1983. The House Study Group reported arguments for and against the bill,\nsummarizing each of the bills that had been introduced on the subject. When HB 1775 reached\nthe House floor on April 21, 1983, same was amended to include new language for § 91.403(a)\nand to add § 91.405 (House Journal Report dated April 21, 1983). House Bill 1775, as amended,\nbecame effective September 1, 1983. Prior to the 1983 enactment, no specific laws protected\nroyalty owners from intentional practices to delay their royalty checks. While it was\ngenerally accepted that a great deal of these delays stem from legitimate title problems, it was\nalso recognized that some delays were intentional and should be addressed by the Legislature. It\nwas the admirable intent of our Legislature to compel timely payment of proceeds to\nroyalty interest owners by those persons or entities occupying the status of a ‘payor.’“ See\nalso, Koch v.

Thus, even though Genesis did not tender the statutory interest penalty\n\nuntil June 25, 2014, the amount of the penalty was fixed on the date the proceeds\n\nwere finally paid, and the statutory interest penalty would never increase from that\n\nfixed amount – no matter how long or how much effort it took for Mrs. Garcia to\n\ncollect the interest due.\n\n      As a result, following the 1987 enactment of Resources Code Section\n\n91.406, unless the payor was able to establish a reasonable excuse for withholding\n\ntimely payment, the royalty owner was no longer limited to collection of interest,\n\nand was instead entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees and a minimum damage\n\naward as additional mandatory remedies if the essential elements of the Resources\n\nCode cause of action was proven in a court of law. There is no evidence elsewhere\n\nin the legislative history to support the theory that the incentive of being forced to\n\npay for the services of an attorney hired to collect unpaid royalty or interest and\n\n\n                                         22\n\ffile suit could be circumvented, defeated, nullified, thwarted -- and the penalties\n\navoided -- by merely waiting until the eve of trial to tender the final payment due.\n\n       The statute’s title is “ATTORNEY’S FEES and MINIMUM AWARD.”92 In\n\nadopting the amendment the Legislature intended to change the existing law, and\n\ntherefore the courts must give some effect to the amendment as a whole and\n\nunderstand the legal effect of the amendment enacted by the Legislature. By its\n\nplain terms and reading the statutory cause of action established under Sec.\n\n91.404(a)-(b) only requires the Payor to have failed to timely pay; and continue\n\nthat failure after receiving 30 days written notice without having a reasonable\n\ncause for non-payment,93 before suit can be filed to collect unpaid oil and gas\n\nproceeds or interest. If payment is not made within thirty days of receiving written\n\nnotice, and if there is no reasonable cause for nonpayment, judicial action can\n\ncommence and the statutory penalties of Section 91.406 are to be imposed, in\n\n92\n  See, Appendix B. TEXAS NATURAL RESOURCES CODE § 91.406 (emphasis added).\n93\n   See, Appendix B. TEXAS NATURAL RESOURCES CODE § 91.404. “NONPAYMENT OF OIL\nAND GAS PROCEEDS OR INTEREST. (a) If a payee seeks relief for the failure of a payor to\nmake timely payment of proceeds from the sale of oil or gas or an interest in oil or gas as\nrequired under Section 91.402 or 91.403 of this code, the payee must give the payor written\nnotice by mail of that failure as a prerequisite to beginning judicial action against the payor for\nnonpayment.\n(b) The payor has 30 days after receipt of the required notice from the payee in which to pay the\nproceeds due, or to respond by stating in writing a reasonable cause for nonpayment.\n(c) A payee has a cause of action for nonpayment of oil or gas proceeds or interest on those\nproceeds as required in Section 91.402 or 91.403 of this code in any court of competent\njurisdiction in the county in which the oil or gas well is located.”\n\n\n\n                                                23\n\faddition to statutory accrued interest. A defendant found to have violated the\n\nstatute was to be held liable for a minimum statutory award of $200 in actual\n\ndamages, plus reasonable attorney’s fees.\n\n         Genesis’ position would allow a payor to withhold payment for up to four\n\nyears (the limitations period) with “no incentive” to make timely payment—\n\nbecause they could entirely avoid payment of the $200 Minimum Award and\n\nthe attorney’s fee penalty—as long as payment was eventually made at any time\n\nprior to trial. Interest rates charged by the New York Federal Reserve since 2011\n\nhave been - for the most part – at or below 1/10th of 1%, and only being required to\n\npay $585.47 in statutory interest94 as the sole penalty for holding tens of thousands\n\nof dollars in unpaid royalties for almost three years and forcing a royalty owner to\n\nhire an attorney to collect the monies due, is a license to steal that was rejected and\n\nprevented by the 70th Legislature through the enactment of the new law in 1987.\n\nIII.

THE LEGISLATURE IS NOT PRESUMED TO DO A USELESS ACT.\n\n       Texas courts should not adopt a construction that would render a law or\n\nprovision meaningless.95 In addition, the Legislature is not presumed to do a\n\nuseless act, and the law does not permit a wrong without a remedy.96\n\n       In 1987, the Legislature passed a new law adopting a Minimum Award of\n\n$200.00 and requiring mandatory reasonable attorney’s fees to be paid as\n\nadditional penalties, “if suit is filed to collect proceeds and interest under this\n\nsubchapter.”97 Genesis argues that under their construction and “plain meaning”\n\nof the statute, a royalty owner suing to collect unpaid proceeds and interest can\n\nnever file a lawsuit and receive a final judgment in their favor as long as the\n\n“actual damages” (of proceeds and interest) are paid before the case reaches trial.\n\nGenesis ignores the statute’s provision that “if actual damages ... are less than\n\n$200, an additional amount” is to be included, “so that the total amount of\n\ndamages equals $200.” It is mathematically axiomatic that ZERO (0) dollars (if\n\nproceeds and interest are paid on the eve of trial) are less than $200, and therefore\n\n95\n   Centurion Planning Corp. v.

Genesis argues that Section 91.406 must be read as only\n\nentitling a plaintiff to an additional amount if damages are greater than zero. But\n\nthe Legislature did not write: “if the actual damages to the plaintiff are greater\n\nthan zero ...”. Instead the Legislature created a MINIMUM AWARD of $200.00\n\nin actual damages, and if actual damages are less than $200.00, then an award of\n\nan additional amount - so that the total amount of damages equals $200.00. The\n\nmathematical formula [0 + $200 = $200] is a fairly easy concept.\n\n          In addition, this is not the only statute that the Legislature has written which\n\nallows for an award of a minimum amount of damages and reasonable attorney’s\n\nfees, without proof of any actual damages. Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code\n\nSec. 12.002, awards the greater of $10,000.00 - or actual damages as a result of\n\nsomeone filing a fraudulent lien or claim against real property.100 Thus even if a\n\nplaintiff is found to have suffered no actual economic damages as a result of\n\nsomeone violating the fraudulent lien statute, there is still a $10,000 minimum\n\nstatutory recovery in actual damages [0 + $10,000 = $10,000]. In addition to the\n\n100\n      TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.

ONE SATISFACTION RULE DOES NOT APPLY.\n\n      After Mrs. Garcia’s contractual claim against the Oil Company Defendant\n\n(LTD) was severed and the Fourth Amended Petition was filed against Genesis,\n\nGenesis argued that it would be entitled to a settlement credit against the $200\n\n“mandatory Minimum Award” guaranteed by Section 91.406 of the Resources\n\nCode; and as a result, contended that Garcia would still be barred from recovering\n\nstatutory attorney’s fees for this tort. However, Gloria Garcia’s claim against LTD\n\nconcerned their contractual failure to pay royalties under the terms of the oil and\n\ngas lease with Garcia, which was a breach of contract claim.102 Section 91.402(h)\n\nof the Resources Code expressly states that this statute “shall not change or relieve\n\nthe lessee's specific, expressed or implied obligations under an oil and gas\n\nlease.”103\n\n\n101\n     TEX.

This was not a\n\nhypothetical issue. Because Genesis had suspended funds since December 2010,\n\nand refused to timely pay proceeds and interest due to her, Mrs. Garcia had been\n\nforced to file suit for Nonpayment under the Texas Natural Resources Code.\n\nUnless Genesis had a reasonable cause for nonpayment,127 Mrs. Garcia was\n\nentitled to a declaration of her statutory right to proceed to trial, and obtain\n\nfindings by the trier of fact whether Genesis breached its duty to timely pay\n\nproceeds under the Resources Code; whether Mrs. Garcia had given the requisite\n\n30 day notice prior to filing suit under the provisions of the Resources Code; and\n\nwhether Genesis had a legitimate excuse for refusing to tender a division order\n\nand/or making timely payment.\n\n      Mrs. Garcia was relying on the UDJA to provide a basis to obtain a\n\ndeclaration of her rights, status, and remedies under statute.128 And while the\n\nCourt might have found Mrs. Garcia was entitled to reasonable and necessary fees\n\n\n\n\n127\n    See, Appendix B. TEXAS NATURAL RESOURCES CODE § 91.404(b): “The payor has 30 days\nafter receipt of the required notice from the payee in which to pay the proceeds due, or to\nrespond by stating in writing a reasonable cause for nonpayment.”\n128\n    See TEX.

GARCIA WAS ENTITLED TO KEEP A BINDING DIVISION ORDER IN PLACE.\n\n            The UDJA may be used to clarify the meaning of statutes.129 Courts have\n\nalso issued declaratory judgments construing a statute before the statute is\n\nviolated.130 Genesis threw down the gauntlet in making what was actually a\n\n“conditional” tender of accrued interest on the late payments, by continuing to\n\nchallenge both past or future liability to Mrs. Garcia, and disputing whether it was\n\never “at any time” the statutory “Payor” under the lease—with a continuing duty to\n\nkeep in place a binding division order.131\n\n\n\n\n132\n      .     According to Sec. 91.402(e) of the Resources Code, division orders are\n\nbinding only for the time and to the extent that they have been acted on and made\n\nthe basis of settlements and payments – and from the time that notice is given\n\n129\n     Frasier v.

The trial court erred in determining that if suit was filed,\n\nthe Minimum Award of $200.00 under Section 91.406 of the Texas Natural\n\nResources Code meant a plaintiff must have actual damages “greater than zero” at\n\nthe time of trial, instead of “less than $200.00.” The trial court erred in refusing to\n\nconsider the Legislature’s intent in enacting a $200 Minimum Award and\n\nattorney’s fees under Section 91.406, and declaring that Gloria Garcia was entitled\n\nto a “take nothing” judgment on this claim. Finally, the trial court erred in\n\npreventing Mrs. Garcia from proceeding to trial on the essential elements of the\n\nResources Code lawsuit, or obtaining a declaration of the continuing duties and\n\nobligations of the parties under Section 91 of the Texas Natural Resources Code.\n\n          Accordingly, this Court should reverse the trial court’s order granting\n\nGenesis’ Motion for Final Summary Judgment to the extent it ruled that Gloria\n\nGarcia “take nothing” on the cause of action established under Texas Natural\n\nResources Code Section 91.404, as it was not extinguished by late payment of\n\nproceeds and statutory interest.    This Court should also reverse the order of the\n\n137\n      See, Appendix A.\n\n\n                                          36\n\ftrial court that granted Genesis a favorable judgment on Gloria Garcia’s Texas\n\nNatural Resources Section 91.406 claim of a Minimum Award of $200.00, and\n\nreasonable attorney’s fees.\n\n      After reversing the trial court, this Court should render as follows:\n      1.    That a suit filed to collect proceeds and interest under the Texas\nNatural Resources Code Section 91.404 cause of action, is not extinguished by\npayment of proceeds and statutory interest.\n\n       2.     That the statutory interest penalty established under Texas Natural\nResources Code Section 91.403 is not the only mandatory penalty to be imposed, if\na plaintiff has filed suit to collect proceeds and interest.\n      3.     That a plaintiff is entitled to a favorable final judgment if he or she\ncan establish the essential elements of a cause of action filed under Texas Natural\nResources Code Section 91.404.\n       4.     That “if actual damages ... are less than $200.00” means that a\nplaintiff who files suit to collect proceeds and interest under the Texas Natural\nResources Code and establishes the essential elements of the Section 91.404 cause\nof action, is entitled to a Minimum Award of $200, and if actual damages at trial\nare zero, “an additional amount so that the total amount of damages equals $200,”\nplus reasonable attorney’s fees.\n\n       5.     That Genesis failed to make timely payments of oil and gas proceeds\nto Gloria Garcia after December 1, 2010; Gloria Garcia gave written notice of the\nfailure to pay as a prerequisite to beginning judicial action for nonpayment; more\nthan 30 days elapsed after notice was given before suit was filed; Genesis had no\nreasonable cause for non-payment; and Gloria Garcia filed suit to collect proceeds\nand interest under the Texas Natural Resources Code.\n\n       6.    That Gloria Garcia is entitled to a Minimum Award of $200.00 in\nactual damages and $51,786.50, as a fair and reasonable fee for the necessary legal\nservices rendered to Gloria Garcia through July 23, 2014.\n\n\n\n\n                                         37\n\f      With respect to reasonable attorney's fees incurred by Gloria Garcia since\n\nJuly 23, 2014, this Court should remand the case for trial before a jury, for this\n\nlimited purpose.

Purchaser shall compute quantity and make corrections for gravity and\ntemperature and make deductions for impurities.\n\n       PAYMENT: From the effective date, payment is to be made monthly by\npayor's check, based on this division of interest, for oil run during the\npreceding calendar month from the property listed above, less taxes required\nby law to be deducted and remitted by payor as purchaser. Payments of less\nthan $100 may be accrued before disbursement until the total amount equals\n$100 or more, or until 12 months' proceeds accumulate, whichever occurs\nfirst. However, the payor may hold accumulated proceeds of less than $10\nuntil production ceases or the payor's responsibility for making payment for\nproduction ceases, whichever occurs first.

Any provision of a division order between payee\nand its lessee which is in contradiction with any provision of an oil and gas\nlease is invalid to the extent of the contradiction.\n\n       (i) A division order may be used to clarify royalty settlement terms\nin the oil and gas lease. With respect to oil and/or gas sold in the field\nwhere produced or at a gathering point in the immediate vicinity, the terms\n\"market value,\" \"market price,\" \"prevailing price in the field,\" or other\nsuch language, when used as a basis of valuation in the oil and gas lease,\nshall be defined as the amount realized at the mouth of the well by the\nseller of such production in an arm's-length transaction.\n\nAdded by Acts 1983, 68th Leg., p. 966, ch. 228, Sec. 1, eff.

The bill would require that payments to\n                 each person entitled to a share of the proceeds\n                 from the production be made within 120 days after\n                 the end of the month of the first sale of the\n                 output of an oil or gas well. The bill also sets\n                 deadlines for payments from subsequent sales.\n                 Late payments would be subject to an interest\n                 penalty, unless payment was withheld because of\n                 a title dispute affecting allocation of the proceeds or\n                 because of a reasonable question concerning either\n                 the payee's entitlement to share in the proceeds\n                 or the payee's whereabouts. A payee could sue\n                 for failure to make timely payments after giving\n                 the payor 30 days' written notice.\n                 Current law is totally vague as to deadlines for\n                 royalty payments. Most l~ases don't specify deadlines\n                 either, and there is no law specifically protecting\n                 Texas royalty owners from deliberate delay of\n                 their royalty checks. Many delays stem from legiti-\n                 mate questions about the validity of titles or\n                 the whereabouts of royalty owners. But some oil\n                 operators have raised title questions just to\n                 put off payments.\n                 The drilling boom a few years ago brought a lot\n                 of new investors into the Texas oil and gas business,\n                 including some fly-by-night operators, high interest\n                 rates gave marginal operators an incentive to\n                 hold onto other people's money as long as possible.\n                 Increased bankruptcies caused by the recent decline\n                 in the industry have aggravated problems of late\n                 payment and nonpayment. HB 646, by Craddick,\n                 already passed by the House, addresses the problem\n                 of bankruptcies more directly. But HB 1775 is\n                 also needed, to establish some guidelines in cases\nEXHIBIT\n                 of late payment and nonpayment. All the associations\n                 of producers and royalty owners support this bill.\n\n 5                               \")\")\n\n                                                                                                    00229\n                                              Cause No.DC-12-200; Gloria Garcia vs. Genesis Crude Oil, L.

A moderately long grace period\n(ccmtinued)   is needed at the beginning of a drilling and produc-\n              tion operation. Sometimes a well is drilled and\n              starts producing before all title questions are\n              reJolved. It.may take 30 to 45 days to get an\n              abstract, and another 30 ·to 45 days to get a title\n              opinion. Sometimes royalty owners delay in respon-\n              ding to division orders. When drilling starts\n              may also be influenced by the expiration date\n              of a lease or the availability of drilling rigs.\n              Title questions may be very cqmplex-~East Texas,\n              for example, is full of title problems, with missing\n              people, split interests, and improperly-worded\n              deeds.\n              Specifying a fixed 9-percent interest rate to\n              be added to late payments will simplify accounting\n              procedures.\n              ~he  oil industry would not support a proposal\n              to require that royalty payments be put in escrow\n              until title questions are resolved. This would\n              ~equire having to set up too many accounts.    Wyoming\n              has an escrow requirement, and oil operators have\n              had a lot of problems with it. An esc~ow requirement\n              would be unfair to legitim~te oil companies, which\n              mijy already be burdened with extra expenses when\n              title questions are involved.\n              There is no need for an additional provision cequicing\n              pijyment deadlines in future leases, as some have\n              proposed. Royalty owners would be sufficiently\n              protected under this bill. Leases may include\n              payment-deadline agreements under existing law.\nOPPONENTS     ~his   bill would allow routine delays of 120 to\nSAY:          lSO days in making royalty payments, depending\n              on which day of the month the oil or gas was sold,\n              even in cases when there are no title problems.\n              This is too long. The bill should be amended\n              to set a 60- or 90-day deadline, except when title\n              problems give reasonable cause for delay.\n              The bill should be amended to specify a floating\n              interest rate on late payments, tied to market\n              conditions. Otherwise, when market interestrates\n              exceed the statutory rate, payors would have an\n              incentive to keep royalty own~rs' mpney longer\n              than they should.\n\n\n\n\n                             23\n\n                                                                                                   00230\n                                            Cause No.DC-12-200; Gloria Garcia vs. Genesis Cru.de Oil, L. p_:\n\f                             HB 1775\n                           page three\n\nOPPONENTS     The bill should be amended to require that, when\nSAY:          payment is delayed because of a title question,\n(continued)   the royalty money must be put in an escrow account.\n              If the money is not placed in escrow, royalty\n              owners run a greater risk when a producer goes\n              bankrupt or an unscrupulous operator absconds.\n              The bill should require that all future leases\n              contain payment deadlines at least as stringent\n              as those specified in the bill. This would give\n              more notice to royalty owners of their protection\n              against late payments.\nNOTES:        SB 731, by Traeger, and its companion HB 1266,\n              by Coody, would require payment within 60 days\n              of the date of first sale, and within 45 days\n              after the end of the calendar month of subsequent\n              sales. SB 731 and HB 1266 specify a 12-percent\n              interest rate on late payments, require that payments\n              delayed due to title questions be put in a separate\n              account, allow payees to recover court costs and\n              attorney's fees when they win a judgment involving\n              a late payment, and specify that, if payment is\n              delayed to any person pending determination of\n              valid title or location of the payee, the delay\n              would not affect the timeliness of payment owed\n              to other royalty owners. SB 731 has been referred to\n              the Senate Natural Resources Committee. HB 1266\n              was heard in the House Energy Committee on April 12,\n              with no action taken.\n              SB 146, by Blake, would require that royalty payments\n              be made within 90 days of first sale, with an\n              annual interest rate of 18 percent on the unpaid\n              balance of late payments. SB 146 would require\n              oil and gas exploration and production leases\n              to state payment deadlines and would allow royalty\n              owners who win court judgments in cases of late\n              payment to recover court costs and dttorney's\n              fees. SB 146 has been referred to the Senate\n              Natural Resources Committee.\n              HB 846, by Craddick, has been passed by the House\n              and was scheduled for a hearing in the Senate\n              Natural Resources Committee on April 20. HB 846\n              would provide an automatic security interest (secured\n              claim) f~r owners and royalty-holders that would\n              allow them a priority claim against a purchase~\n              who failed to pay.\n\n\n\n\n                           24\n\n                                                                                              00231.\n                                        Cause No.DC-12-200; Gloria Garcia vs. Genesis Crude Oil, L.

B. 2363                                   Committee on Energy\nBy: Hackney\n\n\nBackground\nChapter 91 of the Natural Resources Code deals with regulation of\noil and gas production by the Railroad Commission of Texas, In\n1983, the 68th Legislature amended Chapter 91 by adding\nSubchapter K, which provides that a person or persons entitled to\npayment from the proceeds derived from the sale of oil or gas has\na cause of action for nonpayment in a court of competent\njurisdiction. Since many of these claims involve relatively\nsmall amounts of money, it is sometimes difficult for an\nindividual to have a cause resolved in court.\n\nPurpose\nH.B. 2363 would add an incentive of reasonable attorney's fees\nand a minimum award in any final judgement in favor of the\nplaintiff in cases involving nonpayment of oil and gas proceeds\nand interest on late payments.\n\nSynopais\nH.B. 2363 amends Subchapter K, Chapter 91 of the Natural\nResources Code by adding Section 91.406, providing that if a suit\nis filed to collect proceeds and interest from the sale of oil\nand gas production, the court shall include reasonable attorney's\nfees and a minimum award of $200 in any final judgement in favor\nof the plaintiff.\n\nRulemaking Authority\nIt is the opinion of the committee that this bill does not\ndelegate any rulemalting authority to a state agency, officer,\ndepartment, or institution.\n\nsummary of Committee Action\nH.B. 2363 was considered in a public hearing on April 27, 1987.\nTestifying for the bill was Seldon B. Graham, Jr., attorney,\nrepresenting himself. Nat testifying, but appearing to register\n~upport for the bill were; Warren R.  Anderson, representing the\nNational Association of Royalty OWners; Morris Burns,\nrepresenting the West Central Texas Oil and Gas Association; Joe\nc. Hanna, representing TIPRO, North Texas Oil and Gas, and a\nnumber of other oil and gas associations, Dan Jones, representing\nthe East Texas Producers and Royalty OWners Association; and\nScott Anderson, representing TIPRO. There were no other\nwitnesses, At the April 27, 1987 meeting a motion was made to\nreport H.B. 2363 favorably, with the recommendation that it be\nplaced on the consent calendar. The motion carried by a vote of 7\nayes, 0 nays, 0 PNV, and 2 absent.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                  00238\n                                            Cause No.DC-12-200; Gloria Garcia vs. Genesis Crude Oil, L.
