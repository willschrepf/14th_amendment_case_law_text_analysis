No. 101-336, 104 Stat. 327 (more particularly,\n42 U.S.C. § 12132) is violated by a restriction on the number\nof people who can participate in the special Medicaid waiver\nprogram that provides for alternatives other than institutional-\nization for developmentally disabled people. 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1396n(c).

BRADDOCK               3797\n                            BACKGROUND\n\n   Medicaid is a program under which the federal government\nprovides financial assistance to participating states to help\nthem furnish care to low-income persons. If a state chooses to\nparticipate, which all 50 have, it must comply with the federal\nrequirements and regulations, and it must also submit a plan\nfor approval by the federal regulators. See Children’s Hosp.\n& Health Ctr. v. Belshe, 188 F.3d 1090, 1093 (9th Cir. 1999).\n\n   DSHS devised a plan for providing services to qualified\ndevelopmentally disabled individuals and divided it into two\ncomponents. First, it funded Intermediate Care Facilities for\nthe Mentally Retarded (ICF/MR), which are generally large\npublic institutions that are made available to any person who\nmeets the eligibility requirements for admission. See 42\nU.S.C. § 1396d(a)(15), (d). In addition, the plan used some\nICF/MR funds to support smaller, privately operated resi-\ndences that serve between six and forty individuals each. Sec-\nond, in an effort to gain more flexibility in developing its\nprograms and to offer alternatives other than institutionaliza-\ntion, DSHS sought and received a waiver of certain ICF/MR\nrules. 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(1); 42 C.F.R. § 441.300. That\nwaiver program was known as the Home and Community-\nBased Services waiver (HCBS), or the Community Alterna-\ntives Program (CAP).2 HCBS provided a variety of noninsti-\ntutional care options for qualified persons who desire to live\nat home or independently.\n\n   Central to the question presented to us is the HCBS limita-\ntion of its special services to a particular number of individu-\nals — 9,977 when this action was filed. Such a limitation is\nexpressly contemplated by the Medicaid waiver provisions.\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(9), (10); 42 C.F.R. § 441.303(f)(6).\n  2\n  For the sake of clarity, the program will be referred to hereafter as\nHCBS.\n\f3798           ARC   OF   WASHINGTON v. BRADDOCK\nYet Arc asserts that it violates the ADA. The district court\ndisagreed; hence, this appeal.\n\n                           DISCUSSION\n\n  What the issue in this case amounts to is a claim that the\nMedicaid provisions and the ADA clash. Thus, we are pre-\nsented with a question of statutory interpretation, which we\nreview de novo. See Friend v. Reno, 172 F.3d 638, 641 (9th\nCir. 1999).\n\n  [1] We start with the statutory provisions themselves. As\nwe have noted, the Medicaid statute and regulations do pro-\nvide for waivers that will permit the provision of services at\nhome. However, Congress saw that as a limited kind of pro-\ngram and, therefore, included the following provisions in 42\nU.S.C. § 1396n(c), the waiver portion of the statute:\n\n       (9) In the case of any waiver under this subsection\n    which contains a limit on the number of individuals\n    who shall receive home or community-based ser-\n    vices, the State may substitute additional individuals\n    to receive such services to replace any individuals\n    who die or become ineligible for services under the\n    State plan.\n\n       (10) The Secretary shall not limit to fewer than\n    200 the number of individuals in the State who may\n    receive home and community-based services under a\n    waiver under this subsection.\n\nThe regulations follow up on that and go on to require that the\nlimitations must be adhered to. In fact:\n\n      The State must indicate the number of undupli-\n    cated beneficiaries to which it intends to provide\n    waiver services in each year of its program. This\n    number will constitute a limit on the size of the\n\f               ARC   OF   WASHINGTON v. BRADDOCK            3799\n    waiver program unless the State requests and the\n    Secretary approves a greater number of waiver par-\n    ticipants in a waiver amendment.\n\n42 C.F.R. § 441.303(f)(6). Washington obtained that kind of\nwaiver and has adhered to its limitations. There is no indica-\ntion that Washington is not making full use of the available\nslots; rather, Arc complains that once the program is full, peo-\nple must await openings before they can be added to the pro-\ngram.\n\n   [2] On the other hand, the ADA provides that “no qualified\nindividual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability,\nbe excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of\nthe services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be\nsubjected to discrimination by any such entity.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12,132. And the regulations, which flesh out that provision,\nindicate that: “[a] public entity shall administer services, pro-\ngrams, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate\nto the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.” 28\nC.F.R. § 35.130(d). Because of that, says Arc, states cannot\nmaintain the cap and must, actually, make the HCBS program\navailable to every developmentally disabled person who could\nqualify for an ICF/MR setting, but who wishes to be in a\nHCBS setting instead. We do not agree.\n\n   Of course, the policy behind the ADA is a powerful one,\nand speaks to individuals’ yearning to be as free as possible\nfrom institutionalization, with its concomitant segregation and\nrestrictions. See, e.g., Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527\nU.S. 581, 599-601, 119 S. Ct. 2176, 2186-87, 144 L. Ed. 2d\n540 (1999). But, the policy behind the Medicaid provision is\none of experimentation, and the ADA requirements are not\nboundless. Id. at 603, 119 S. Ct. at 2188 (plurality). Indeed,\nif they were so, they might break Medicaid’s back. See Bry-\nson v. Shumway, 308 F.3d 79, 87 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n   [3] Thus, to the extent that the statutes point in opposite\ndirections, one of them must prevail. In this case, the Medic-\n\f3800            ARC   OF   WASHINGTON v. BRADDOCK\naid statute should receive the laurel wreath because, “[w]here\nthere is no clear intention otherwise, a specific statute will not\nbe controlled or nullified by a general one, regardless of the\npriority of enactment.” Crawford Fitting Co. v. J.T. Gibbons,\nInc., 482 U.S. 437, 445, 107 S. Ct. 2494, 2499, 96 L. Ed. 2d\n385 (1987) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted);\nsee also Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S. 374,\n384-85, 112 S. Ct. 2031, 2037, 119 L. Ed. 2d 157 (1992). As\nwe said in S.V. v. Sherwood School District, 254 F.3d 877,\n881 (9th Cir. 2001), “[i]t is a well-established tenet of statu-\ntory construction that a specific statute controls over a general\nstatute.” If Arc were correct, the general ADA injunction\nagainst discrimination would repeal the specific Medicaid\nprovisions for limited waiver programs. That cannot be. In so\nstating, we do not mean that the ADA has nothing whatsoever\nto say about a state’s obligation to provide community-based\nservices to the disabled. We have already held to the contrary.\nSee Townsend v. Quasim, 328 F.3d 511, 520 (9th Cir. 2003).\nWe merely state that the ADA does not overcome the specific\ncap provisions in the Medicaid statute.\n\n   [4] To put it somewhat less starkly, the ADA and the Med-\nicaid statutes and regulations can be harmonized so that each\nis effective in its own way. See FCC v. NextWave Pers. Com-\nmunications Inc., 537 U.S. 293, 304, 123 S. Ct. 832, 840, 154\nL. Ed. 2d 863 (2003). Thus, congressional intent, as far as it\ncan be discerned, can be given the “fullest expression” possi-\nble. Get Oil Out! Inc. v. Exxon Corp., 586 F.2d 726, 729 (9th\nCir. 1978). Medicaid fund availability will itself encourage\nthe use of HCBS services for the developmentally disabled,\na prime goal of the ADA, but the ADA will not fundamentally\nupset the Medicaid program. Similarly, the states will be left\nwith reasonable leeway in their provision of services. See\nOlmstead, 527 U.S. at 603-04, 119 S. Ct. at 2188 (plurality).\n\n                           CONCLUSION\n\n   [5] We hold that notwithstanding the accommodation pro-\nvisions of the ADA, states are permitted to use the cap pro-\n\f                ARC   OF   WASHINGTON v. BRADDOCK              3801\nvided in the Medicaid law when they utilize the Medicaid\nwaiver program for HCBS.\n\n  AFFIRMED on the issue discussed in this opinion.3 The\nparties shall bear their own costs on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n  3\n  We note that we reverse and remand on certain issues in this case,\nwhich are considered in a memorandum disposition filed on this date.\n\f",

There is no indica-\ntion that Washington is not making full use of the available\nslots; rather, Arc complains that once the program is full, peo-\nple must await openings before they can be added to the pro-\ngram.\n\n   [2] On the other hand, the ADA provides that “no qualified\nindividual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability,\nbe excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of\nthe services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be\nsubjected to discrimination by any such entity.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12,132. And the regulations, which flesh out that provision,\nindicate that: “[a] public entity shall administer services, pro-\ngrams, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate\nto the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.” 28\nC.F.R. § 35.130(d). Because of that, says Arc, states cannot\nmaintain the cap and must, actually, make the HCBS program\navailable to every developmentally disabled person who could\nqualify for an ICF/MR setting, but who wishes to be in a\nHCBS setting instead. We do not agree.\n\n   Of course, the policy behind the ADA is a powerful one,\nand speaks to individuals’ yearning to be as free as possible\nfrom institutionalization, with its concomitant segregation and\nrestrictions. See, e.g., Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118315\"><a href=\"/opinion/118315/olmstead-v-lc/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">581</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 599-601, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118315\"><a href=\"/opinion/118315/olmstead-v-lc/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

But, the policy behind the Medicaid provision is\none of experimentation, and the ADA requirements are not\nboundless. Id. at 603, 119 S. Ct. at 2188 (plurality). Indeed,\nif they were so, they might break Medicaid’s back. See Bry-\nson v.

That cannot be. In so\nstating, we do not mean that the ADA has nothing whatsoever\nto say about a state’s obligation to provide community-based\nservices to the disabled. We have already held to the contrary.\nSee Townsend v. Quasim, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781887\"><a href=\"/opinion/781887/levi-townsend-v-lyle-quasim-secretary-of-the-state-of-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 520 (9th Cir. 2003).\nWe merely state that the ADA does not overcome the specific\ncap provisions in the Medicaid statute.\n\n   [4] To put it somewhat less starkly, the ADA and the Med-\nicaid statutes and regulations can be harmonized so that each\nis effective in its own way.

Medicaid fund availability will itself encourage\nthe use of HCBS services for the developmentally disabled,\na prime goal of the ADA, but the ADA will not fundamentally\nupset the Medicaid program. Similarly, the states will be left\nwith reasonable leeway in their provision of services. See\nOlmstead, 527 U.S. at 603-04, 119 S.
