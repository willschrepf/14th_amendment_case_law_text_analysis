AliKhan, Deputy Solicitor General.\n\f                                  2\n    Before: TATEL and PILLARD, Circuit Judges, and EDWARDS,\nSenior Circuit Judge.\n     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge TATEL.\n     TATEL, Circuit Judge: This case presents a recurring issue\nunder the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act: When a\nparent chooses, without school officials’ consent, to send her child\nto a private school, under what circumstances must the school\ndistrict reimburse the parent for the costs of attending that school?\nHere, the parent chose a private boarding school, and both a\nhearing officer and the district court denied reimbursement\nbecause, in their view, the child had no need to be in a residential\nprogram. On the record before us, however, all statutory,\nregulatory, and judicial requirements for reimbursement of the\ncosts of private school have been satisfied: the school district failed\nto offer the child a “free appropriate public education” in either a\npublic school or a non-residential private school, 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1412(10)(C)(i); the private boarding school the parent selected\nwas, at the time, the only one on the record “reasonably calculated\nto enable the child to receive educational benefits” designed to\nmeet the child’s needs, Board of Education of Hendrick Hudson\nCentral School District v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 207 (1982); the\nresidential component of the private school was in fact “necessary\nto provide a free appropriate public education to” the child, 34\nC.F.R. § 104.33(a)(c)(3); and the school district has not shown\nthat the parent acted “unreasonabl[y],” 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1412(10)(C)(iii)(III). Accordingly, we reverse and remand for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                  I.\n     Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\n(IDEA), every child with a disability in this country is entitled to a\n“free appropriate public education,” or FAPE. 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1400(d)(1)(A). As Congress explained when it passed IDEA, the\nAct’s primary purpose is “to ensure that all children with\n\f                                  3\ndisabilities have available to them a[n] . . . education that\nemphasizes special education and related services designed to\n. . . prepare them for further education, employment, and\nindependent living.” Id. “Special education,” in turn, means,\nsimply, instruction “specially designed . . . to meet the unique\nneeds of a child with a disability.” Id. § 1401(29).\n     To guarantee that no child with a disability misses out on the\neducation the Act promises, and to ensure, in turn, that the\neducation offered is “appropriate,” IDEA requires that school\nofficials develop a comprehensive strategy, known as an\n“individualized education program,” or IEP, tailored to the\nstudent’s unique needs. Id. § 1414(d)(1)(A). Critical to the issue\nbefore us, IDEA requires that school districts have an IEP in place\nfor each student with a disability “[a]t the beginning of each school\nyear.” Id. § 1414(d)(2)(A).\n     Although Congress envisioned that children with disabilities\nwould normally be educated in “the regular public schools or in\nprivate schools chosen jointly by school officials and parents,”\nFlorence County School District Four v. Carter By and Through\nCarter, 510 U.S. 7, 12 (1993), it provided that parents who\nbelieve that their child’s public school system failed to offer a free\nappropriate public education—either because the child’s IEP was\ninadequate or because school officials never even developed one—\nmay choose to enroll the child in a private school that serves her\neducational needs. Id. Specifically, IDEA provides that if parents\n“enroll the child in a private . . . school without the consent of [the\nschool district], a court or a hearing officer may require the [school\ndistrict] to reimburse [them] for the cost of that enrollment . . . .”\n20 U.S.C. § 1412(10)(C)(ii). The statute requires reimbursement,\nhowever, only where the school district has failed to “ma[k]e a free\nappropriate public education available to the child.” Id.\nReimbursement, moreover, may be “reduced or denied” if the\nparents fail to notify school officials of their intent to withdraw the\nchild, id. § 1412(10)(C)(iii)(I), deny them a chance to evaluate the\n\f                                  4\nstudent, id. § 1412(10)(C)(iii)(II), or, of special relevance here,\notherwise act “unreasonabl[y],” id. § 1412(10)(C)(iii)(III).\n     In regulations that largely track these provisions, the\nDepartment of Education has made clear that parents can obtain\nreimbursement even for residential programs. Specifically, the\nregulations state that “[i]f a public or private residential placement\nis necessary to provide a free appropriate public education to a\nhandicapped [child] because of his or her handicap, the placement,\nincluding non-medical care and room and board, shall be provided\nat no cost to the [child] or his or her parents or guardian.” 34\nC.F.R. § 104.33(c)(3).\n     Elucidating these provisions, the Supreme Court explained in\nSchool Committee of Town of Burlington v. Department of\nEducation of Massachusetts that it is the Act’s grant of equitable\nauthority that empowers a court “to order school authorities to\nreimburse parents for their expenditures on private special\neducation for a child if the court ultimately determines that such\nplacement . . . is proper under the Act.” 471 U.S. 359, 369 (1985).\nIn such cases, “parents who disagree with the proposed IEP are\nfaced with a choice: go along with the IEP to the detriment of their\nchild if it turns out to be inappropriate or pay for what they\nconsider to be the appropriate placement.” Id. at 370. For parents\nwho make the latter choice, the Court reasoned, “it would be an\nempty victory to have a court tell them several years later that they\nwere right but that these expenditures could not in a proper case be\nreimbursed by the school officials.” Id. Because such a result\nwould be contrary to IDEA’s guarantee of a “free appropriate\npublic education,” the Court confirmed that “Congress meant to\ninclude retroactive reimbursement to parents as an available\nremedy in a proper case.” Id.\n    A decade later, and again considering the conditions under\nwhich reimbursement for a parental placement is appropriate, the\nCourt reiterated in Florence County School District Four v.\nCarter that IDEA empowers courts to order school officials to\n\f                                  5\nreimburse parents for their expenditures on private special\neducation if the private placement was “‘proper under the Act.’”\n510 U.S. at 12 (quoting Burlington, 471 U.S. at 369). In setting\nout that requirement, the Court acknowledged that “Congress has\nimposed a significant financial burden on states and school\ndistricts that participate in IDEA.” Id. at 17. But school districts,\nthe Court observed, have complete control over their fate: “public\neducational authorities who want to avoid reimbursing parents for\nthe private education of a disabled child can do [so by] . . . giv[ing]\nthe child a free appropriate public education in a public setting, or\nplac[ing] the child in an appropriate private setting of the State’s\nchoice.” Id. This, according to the Court, “is IDEA’s mandate, and\nschool officials who conform to it need not worry about\nreimbursement claims.” Id.\n     In this case, we must determine the precise contours of these\nrequirements: Under what circumstances does the school district’s\nfailure to offer an IEP by the start of the year—either in a public or\nprivate school—amount to a denial of FAPE? When is a private\nboarding-school placement “proper under the Act”? And what\nfactors must a court consider when addressing the equities? But\ngiven that these issues arise in the context of the education of a\nparticular child—Appellant Jane Leggett’s teenage daughter\nK.E.—we turn first to the facts.\n     Now nineteen years old, K.E. attended school in the District of\nColumbia Public Schools, or DCPS, from kindergarten through\nthe end of her first attempt at the eleventh grade in 2012. While in\nelementary school, K.E. was diagnosed with several learning\nissues, including “deficits in auditory awareness and in fine motor\nskills.” Hearing Officer Determination at 4. Although her\nelementary school provided her with special education, her middle\nschool did not. Still, when K.E. entered Wilson High School in\n2009, Leggett asked school officials to evaluate her daughter for\nlearning disabilities. The school agreed to perform that evaluation,\n\f                                 6\nbut it had failed to do so by the fall of 2011 when K.E. began her\njunior year.\n     By October of that year, although K.E. had been identified as\na student of above-average intelligence, she was failing most of her\nclasses, often due to inattention, disorganization, and anxiety.\nDispirited by her personal and academic struggles, K.E. threatened\nsuicide that same fall. In February 2012, spurred on by K.E.’s\nefforts to harm herself and the news that she would probably fail to\ngraduate if things did not change, Leggett again asked school\nofficials to evaluate her daughter. When the school district\nrefused—instead recommending that Leggett pay for a private\nassessment—Leggett filed a due-process complaint seeking a\ncomprehensive evaluation to determine K.E.’s eligibility for\nspecial education. See 20 U.S.C. § 1415(f) (providing for an\n“impartial due process hearing, which shall be conducted by the\nState educational agency or by the local educational agency”).\nWhen school officials finally agreed to undertake the necessary\ntesting, Leggett withdrew her complaint.\n     The resulting evaluations demonstrated that although K.E.’s\nverbal skills were in the “superior” range, her non-verbal cognitive\nabilities were “low-average” and she demonstrated weakness in\nexecutive functions, including organization, planning, and\nprocessing speed. Even more worrisome, DCPS’s own\npsychologist concluded that K.E.’s anxiety and depression were\n“disabling” to her “life functions,” Hearing Officer Determination\nat 8, and K.E.’s private doctor diagnosed her with Major\nDepressive Disorder, Panic Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress\nDisorder, an Identity Problem, a Reading Disorder, and Attention-\nDeficit Hyperactivity Disorder. To combat those conditions, the\nprivate psychologist recommended that K.E. be placed in a “small,\nhighly structured therapeutic classroom with a low student to\nteacher ratio throughout her day” and proposed a “more intensive\neducational program” for K.E., including benchmarking of reading\nfluency, strategies to support reading comprehension, and\nevidence-based cognitive behavioral strategies for depression and\n\f                                 7\nanxiety. Neuropsychological Evaluation at 6–7; Due Process\nHearing, Testimony of Dr. Culotta at 138.\n     Given these recommendations, Wilson officials convened a\nteam in the weeks following final exams to develop an IEP for\nK.E. for the next school year. See 20 U.S.C. § 1414(b)(4)(A)\n(“[T]he determination of whether the child is a child with a\ndisability as defined in [the Act] and the educational needs of the\nchild shall be made by a team of qualified professionals and the\nparent of the child . . . .”). Following two June meetings, however,\nthe team had yet to complete the IEP, so it agreed to meet again in\nlate August to finalize the plan. The team also recommended that,\nin the meantime, K.E. receive counseling over the summer. On\nJune 21, just a week after the IEP team had met, Leggett emailed\nWilson’s Special Education Coordinator to pin down the details of\nthe August meeting and to ask for guidance on the recommended\nsummer counseling. She received no response. Facing a summer\nwithout the recommended assistance, Leggett next left a voicemail\nmessage for the Coordinator. No response. Finally, Leggett sent a\nletter in early July to the same effect. Again, nothing.\n    Having received no indication that DCPS would finalize\nK.E.’s IEP before the school year began, and thus with no\nassurance that K.E. would get the special-education services she\nneeded, Leggett began exploring alternative placements. She\ninvestigated “literally dozens” of possible schools, but she found\nonly two that appeared to meet K.E.’s needs. One, a local private\nday school, rejected K.E. on the ground that a “highly structured,\nsupportive school or therapeutic setting” would better serve her\nneeds. The other, the Grier School—a boarding school in\nPennsylvania—accepted her for the upcoming term.\n    On August 6, just three weeks before the Wilson school year\nwould begin, Leggett sent DCPS written notice, as the Act\nrequires, see 20 U.S.C. § 1412(10)(C)(iii)(I)(bb), that she would\nbe withdrawing K.E. from Wilson and seeking public funding for\nher placement at the Grier School. Critical for our purposes,\n\f                                  8\nLeggett’s communication made clear that she “remain[ed] open\nto” the possibility that K.E. could return to Wilson if the school\noffered her a satisfactory IEP. Letter from Benjamin W.\nMassarsky to Peter Cahall, Principal, Woodrow Wilson High\nSchool, Aug. 6, 2012. Again, no response. Having heard nothing\nby August 17, just 10 days before the first day of the Wilson\nschool year, Leggett filed a new due-process complaint seeking\neither an acceptable IEP at Wilson or reimbursement for the cost\nof attending Grier.\n     Five days before the first day of school, Leggett finally heard\nfrom DCPS when school officials contacted her to schedule a\n“resolution meeting.” The record does not indicate what happened\nat that meeting, and although the parties agreed at oral argument\nthat the meeting occurred on August 29, neither could offer any\ndetails. Everyone agrees, however, that the session resulted in no\nIEP. On September 4, without an IEP in place and with no\nguarantee that K.E. would receive the special education she\nrequired if she returned to Wilson, Leggett enrolled her at Grier.\n     By all accounts, K.E. thrived there. The school offered her\nindividualized tutoring, life-skills instruction, and extra study hall,\nall coordinated under the rubric of Grier’s Learning Skills\nProgram, and all consistent with her psychologists’\nrecommendations. The proof is in the results: whereas K.E. had\nfailed to complete the eleventh grade at Wilson, she pulled all A’s\nand B’s in her first semester at Grier.\n     Meanwhile, on September 11, more than two weeks into the\nWilson school year, K.E.’s IEP team met once again to try to\nfinalize her plan. By September 24, officials had come up with a\ndocument, but according to Leggett, the IEP was riddled with\nerrors and failed to include many of the special-education\nprograms K.E. needed. DCPS, by contrast, insists that the\ndocument was substantively valid, if sloppily done. Whichever\nversion one credits, though, DCPS officials clearly had no IEP in\n\f                                 9\nplace for K.E. by the time the Wilson year began, or even by the\ntime she had to enroll at Grier.\n     In late October, a Hearing Officer took up Leggett’s request\nfor reimbursement for the tuition and fees she had paid to Grier.\nAlthough the Officer found that DCPS had denied K.E. a free\nappropriate public education, he nonetheless concluded that the\nGrier placement was improper because K.E. had no need to be in a\nresidential program. See Hearing Officer Determination at 16–20.\nAccordingly, he denied Leggett any reimbursement at all.\n     Pursuant to IDEA’s judicial-review provision, 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1415(i)(2)(A), Leggett filed two law suits against DCPS in the\nU.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, one seeking\nreimbursement for the 2012–13 school year and the other for\n2013–14. In the matter before us now—the 2012–13 suit—the\nparties filed cross motions for summary judgment and, basing its\ndecision entirely on the administrative record, the district court\ndenied Leggett’s request for reimbursement for much the same\nreason as the Hearing Officer had, adding only that in its\nestimation, Leggett had acted unreasonably by withdrawing K.E.\nfrom Wilson in August and sending her to an expensive boarding\nschool. See K.E. v. District of Columbia, 19 F. Supp. 3d 140,\n151–152 (D.D.C. 2014).\n     Leggett appeals. Although our review would typically be for\n“clear error as to any factual findings and abuse of discretion as to\nthe remedy,” Reid ex rel. Reid v. District of Columbia, 401 F.3d\n516, 522 (D.C. Cir. 2005), where, as here, the district court\n“t[akes] no additional evidence” and instead “grant[s] summary\njudgment based simply on the administrative record . . . we review\nits decision de novo . . . and apply the same non-deferential\nstandard the district court . . . applied to the hearing [officer’s\nlegal] decision.” Id.\n\f                                  10\n                                  II.\n     As interpreted by the Supreme Court, IDEA requires school\ndistricts to reimburse parents for their private-school expenses if\n(1) school officials failed to offer the child a free appropriate\npublic education in a public or private school; (2) the private-\nschool placement chosen by the parents was otherwise “proper\nunder the Act”; and (3) the equities weigh in favor of\nreimbursement—that is, the parents did not otherwise act\n“unreasonabl[y].” See Carter, 510 U.S. at 15–16; 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1412(10)(C)(iii)(III). Leggett and DCPS disagree at every turn.\nLeggett argues that DCPS’s failure to provide K.E. an IEP by the\nbeginning of the 2012 school year itself constituted an IDEA\nviolation, that the placement at Grier was proper, and that nothing\nin the record suggests that she acted unreasonably. In her view,\ntherefore, the equities weigh in her favor and she is entitled to\nreimbursement. For its part, DCPS argues that any IDEA violation\nwas procedural and thus not a denial of FAPE, that the Grier\nplacement was improper because K.E. could have succeeded in a\nnon-residential program, and that Leggett acted unreasonably in\nher dealings with Wilson administrators. Accordingly, it argues,\nLeggett is entitled to no reimbursement at all. We address each\npoint in turn.\n                                  A.\n     Recall that the IEP is the vehicle through which school\ndistricts typically fulfill their statutory obligation to provide a free\nappropriate public education and that officials must have an IEP in\nplace for each student with a disability “[a]t the beginning of each\nschool year.” 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(2)(A). DCPS concedes that it\nfailed to satisfy that timeliness requirement with respect to K.E.\nThe parties part ways, however, over the import of that\nuncontested fact. According to Leggett, DCPS’s failure to offer\nK.E. an IEP by the first day of school was, by itself, a denial of\nFAPE, thus satisfying the first of IDEA’s three requirements for\nprivate-school reimbursement. DCPS’s own Hearing Officer\n\f                                 11\nagreed: “I find . . . that DCPS’[s] failure to develop an IEP for\n[K.E.] before the start of the 2012–2013 school year . . . was a\nclear denial of FAPE.” Hearing Officer Determination at 17.\nDisagreeing with that conclusion, DCPS argues that the IEP\nviolation was procedural and de minimis and, therefore, not a\ndenial of FAPE.\n     DCPS has the standard correct: a procedural violation, such\nas a school district’s failure to provide an IEP by the beginning of\nthe school year, will constitute a denial of a free appropriate public\neducation only if it “result[s] in loss of educational opportunity”\nfor the student. Lesesne ex rel. B.F. v. District of Columbia, 447\nF.3d 828, 834 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). That is, a school district’s failure to comply with the\nprocedural requirements of IDEA will be “actionable” only “if\nthose procedural violations affected the student’s substantive\nrights.” Id. at 832, 834 (emphasis omitted).\n     Applying that standard to the circumstances of this case,\nDCPS argues that Leggett has not “demonstrated” that its failure\nto offer K.E. an IEP by the beginning of the 2012 school year—a\ndelay of somewhere between two weeks and a month, depending\non whose facts one credits—amounted to “an educational\ndeprivation or substantive violation.” Appellee’s Br. 23. To be\nsure, this court has at times required parents to “demonstrate . . .\nthat [the student’s] education was affected by any procedural\nviolations [the school district] might have committed,” Lesesne,\n447 F.3d at 834. We have done so, however, only where the\nviolation was not obviously substantive. See, e.g., id. (plaintiff\nfailed to demonstrate that the school district’s failure to satisfy\nmid-year IEP deadline was a substantive violation). And in the\nparticular circumstances of this case, we think the violation was\nquite clearly substantive. Although “[a] delay does not affect\nsubstantive rights if the student’s education would not have been\ndifferent had there been no delay,” D.R. ex rel. Robinson v.\nGovernment of District of Columbia, 637 F. Supp. 2d 11, 18\n\f                                 12\n(D.D.C. 2009), the converse is true as well: a delay does affect a\nstudent’s substantive rights, and is therefore “actionable,” see\nLesesne, 447 F.3d at 832, if the student’s education would have\nbeen different but for the procedural violation. That is the case\nhere. DCPS concedes—and the Hearing Officer found—that K.E.\nneeded an IEP that included special education and related services.\nSee Hearing Officer Determination at 16 (noting that K.E. was\n“determined to be eligible for special education and related\nservices” and describing “her IEP needs”); see also Appellee’s Br.\n5–7 (“The [IEP] team agreed at the May 2012 meeting that K.E.\nwas eligible for special education services.”). Put another way,\nDCPS acknowledges that K.E.’s education would have been\ndifferent if school officials had fulfilled their statutory\nresponsibilities on time: with an IEP in place at Wilson, K.E.\nwould have received the targeted special education she needed;\nwithout an IEP and still at Wilson, she would have been on her\nown, much as she was for the first three years of high school,\nduring which she struggled mightily. Under these circumstances,\nDCPS’s failure to have an IEP in place by the start of the school\nyear—in clear violation of its IDEA obligations—adversely\naffected K.E.’s educational opportunities and therefore denied her\na FAPE. DCPS’s arguments to the contrary are without merit.\n      First, although its logic is far from clear, DCPS seems to\ncontend that Leggett is actually to blame for the violation because\nshe “had already decided” to send K.E. to a private boarding\nschool some three weeks before the start of the school year, while\nschool officials were still doing their best to get an IEP in place.\nAppellee’s Br. 23. According to DCPS, then, it was Leggett’s fault\nthat school officials ran out of time and so it was Leggett, not\nDCPS, who effectively caused K.E. to lose out on educational\nopportunities. That is, it was Leggett who transformed the absence\nof an IEP from a procedural deficiency into a substantive harm. In\nthis sense, the school system argues, this case looks a lot like C.H.\nv. Cape Henlopen School District, 606 F.3d 59 (3d Cir. 2010).\nThere, like here, the school district failed to complete an IEP for\n\f                                  13\nthe student before the start of the school year. And, like here, the\nchild’s mother elected to withdraw him from his public school,\nplace him in a private school, and seek reimbursement. Denying\nreimbursement, the Third Circuit found that the delay was\nprocedural, not substantive, because the parent had caused it.\nAlthough the school district missed the deadline, it had\ndemonstrated a “consistent willingness to evaluate C.H. and to\ndevelop an IEP.” Id. at 69. “[T]he [p]arents,” however, “delayed\nthe continuation of [the IEP] meeting until after the start of classes,\nand ultimately terminated the process by filing a due process\nrequest.” Id. Under those circumstances, the court held, the school\ndistrict’s failure to adopt a final IEP before the first day of school\ndid not violate the student’s substantive rights.\n      By contrast, the record in this case contains no evidence that\nLeggett’s decision to withdraw K.E. from Wilson prevented school\nofficials from developing an IEP. Indeed, although Leggett notified\nWilson on August 6 that K.E. would enroll at Grier to start the\nschool year, she expressly left open the possibility that K.E. could\ninstead begin the year in public school if officials were prepared to\nprovide the special education that even the school system agreed\nshe needed. See Massarsky Letter. What is more, even if Leggett\nhad never made this offer and instead had summarily withdrawn\nK.E. from Wilson, nothing would have stopped DCPS from\nfulfilling its statutory obligation to complete an IEP by the\nbeginning of the school year. This case thus looks nothing like\nCape Henlopen. There the court pointed to evidence that the\nschool district would likely have gotten an IEP together but for the\nparent’s intransigence. Here Leggett had made K.E. available for\nevaluation, and she remained open to leaving her daughter at\nWilson until she had to enroll at Grier. DCPS had until the\nbeginning of the Wilson school year to create an IEP for K.E. It is\nentirely illogical for the school system to blame Leggett for its\nfailure to do so.\n\f                                 14\n     DCPS next argues that Leggett’s own communications with\nschool officials show that those officials were acting in good faith.\nFor instance, it points out that Leggett told the Special Education\nCoordinator that she had “sent a set of proposed [classroom]\naccommodations to the special education teacher and had talked\nmore with the school social worker about goals for the behavioral\nsection of the IEP.” Appellee’s Br. 8 (internal quotation marks\nomitted) (alteration in original). Of course, these communications\nmerely highlight the fact that despite Leggett’s repeated entreaties,\nno IEP materialized. But DCPS’s argument gets even more\npreposterous. Seeking to demonstrate that Leggett should have\nknown that school officials were on the road to an IEP, the school\nsystem observes that Leggett, “[f]ollowing up on [its] offer of\ncounseling for K.E. during the summer, . . . suggested a specific\ntherapeutic program in Connecticut, where K.E. would be\nspending most of the summer with her grandmother.” Id. at 8–9.\nThe implication seems to be that Leggett had to have known that\nK.E. would be taken care of because school officials were\nconsidering summer placements. But we fail to see how Leggett’s\ncommunication regarding her own efforts to find a summer\nprogram for K.E. could possibly demonstrate the school district’s\ngood faith when school officials failed to respond to that very\ncommunication.\n      Moreover, nothing in IDEA required Leggett to wait until the\nfirst day of school to pull K.E. out of Wilson. In fact, the Act\nexpressly prohibited her from waiting that long. IDEA requires a\nparent to notify the school district ten days before she sends her\nchild to private school to remedy an IDEA violation. See 20\nU.S.C. § 1412(10)(C)(iii)(I)(bb). On DCPS’s reading, Leggett\nshould have given school officials a chance to finish the IEP by the\nfirst day of school at Wilson before withdrawing K.E. But had\nLeggett waited that long she would have been entitled to no\nreimbursement because she would have violated the ten-day notice\nrequirement. DCPS, therefore, asks us both to require parents to\n\f                                 15\nnotify school officials ten days out and to penalize Leggett for\nnotifying them too early. DCPS cannot have it both ways.\n     In sum, then, Leggett’s actions imposed no impediments to\nDCPS fulfilling its statutory responsibilities. Quite to the contrary,\nit was DCPS’s failure to develop an IEP that forced Leggett’s\nhand. School officials acknowledged in June 2012 that K.E.\nneeded an IEP. Yet they responded to none of Leggett’s\ncommunications, fulfilled none of their statutory responsibilities,\nand left her in a position in which the only way to find out if DCPS\nwould ever develop an IEP would have been to leave K.E. at\nWilson despite lacking any evidence that the school was close to\nhaving a plan ready. IDEA prohibits school districts from forcing\nparents to make that kind of decision.\n      For all of these reasons, we agree with the Hearing Officer\nand the district court that DCPS denied K.E. a free appropriate\npublic education by failing to have an IEP in place by the\nbeginning of the school year. The school system, of course, may\nstill escape liability if the placement at Grier was otherwise\nimproper under the Act or if Leggett acted unreasonably, questions\nto which we now turn.\n                                 B.\n      The parties offer dueling tests for determining whether the\nGrier School placement was “‘proper under the Act.’” Carter, 510\nU.S. at 12 (quoting Burlington, 471 U.S. at 369). According to\nLeggett, the placement was proper because Grier offered K.E. the\ntools she needed to complete her education. As DCPS would have\nit, the critical factor is that Grier is a residential school—one with\nan equestrian program, it repeatedly emphasizes. Because K.E.\ncould have succeeded in a non-residential school, DCPS argues,\nthe placement was improper.\n     We begin with what is undisputed: under the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Rowley, a public school district need not guarantee the\nbest possible education or even a “potential-maximizing” one. 458\n\f                                 16\nU.S. at 197 n.21. Instead, an IEP is generally “proper under the\nAct” if “reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive\neducational benefits.” Id. at 207; see also Branham v. District of\nColumbia, 427 F.3d 7, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (IEP need not\nmaximize the child’s development as long as it “provide[s] some\n[educational] benefit”) (internal quotation marks omitted). True,\nas DCPS points out, the Supreme Court enunciated this principle,\nand this court has echoed it, in the context of disputes over whether\nthe education the school district offered was proper. But we\nbelieve the standard applies as well where, as here, the parent\nmakes the choice. Whether the school system or the parent chooses\nthe private school, the Rowley standard protects the child by\nguaranteeing an education “reasonably calculated” to benefit her.\nAs we explain below, moreover, where the parent selects the\nprivate school because the school system failed to provide a FAPE\nand the court finds that the school the parent selected is\n“reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational\nbenefits,” the court may still “reduce[] or den[y]” reimbursement if\n“[e]quitable considerations” warrant it—for instance, “if the cost\nof the private education was unreasonable.” Carter, 510 U.S. at\n16. In this way, and consistent with Rowley, we ensure not only\nthat the child’s IDEA rights are fully protected, but also that the\nschool system will not be required to fund a program that exceeds\nwhat the child needs to obtain a “free appropriate public\neducation.”\n     Employing the Rowley standard where the parent chooses the\nschool is also consistent with the practice of our sister circuits. In\nthe decision the Supreme Court affirmed in Carter, for instance,\nthe Fourth Circuit held that “when a public school system has\ndefaulted on its obligations under the Act, a private school\nplacement is ‘proper under the Act’ if the education provided by\nthe private school is ‘reasonably calculated to enable the child to\nreceive educational benefits,’—the same standard by which the\nappropriateness of a public school’s IEP is assessed.” Carter By\nand Through Carter v. Florence County School District Four,\n\f                                 17\n950 F.2d 156, 163 (4th Cir. 1991), aff’d, 510 U.S. 7 (1993)\n(quoting Rowley, 458 U.S. at 207) (citation omitted). The Second\nCircuit has concurred, holding that “the same considerations and\ncriteria that apply in determining whether the [s]chool [d]istrict’s\nplacement is appropriate should be considered in determining the\nappropriateness of the parents’ placement . . . . [T]he issue turns on\nwhether a placement—public or private—is ‘reasonably calculated\nto enable the child to receive educational benefits.’” Frank G. v.\nBoard of Education of Hyde Park, 459 F.3d 356, 364 (2d Cir.\n2006) (quoting Rowley, 458 U.S. at 207).\n     The baseline, then, is this: a parent’s unilateral private\nplacement is proper under the Act so long as it is “reasonably\ncalculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.”\nRowley, 458 U.S. at 207. DCPS urges us to apply a more exacting\nstandard because Grier is a boarding school. In particular, it asks\nus to require that the placement be not just reasonably calculated\nto provide educational benefits, but necessary to serve that goal.\nIn support, it points to the above-mentioned regulation providing\nthat a school system must pay for a residential placement only if\n“necessary to provide a free appropriate public education to a\nhandicapped person.” 34 C.F.R. § 104.33(c)(3). It also relies on\nMcKenzie v. Smith, in which this court explained that a residential\nplacement is unnecessary to the student’s education if it is “‘a\nresponse to medical, social or emotional problems that are\nsegregable from the learning process.’” 771 F.2d 1527, 1534\n(D.C. Cir. 1985) (quoting Kruelle v. New Castle County School\nDistrict, 642 F.2d 687, 693 (3d Cir. 1981)); see also Ashland\nSchool District v. Parents of Student R.J., 588 F.3d 1004, 1010\n(9th Cir. 2009) (although teachers reported that student had\ndifficulty turning in assignments on time, she earned good grades\nwhen she completed her work, was well regarded by teachers, and\nwas not disruptive, and it was student’s “risky behaviors” outside\nof school that prompted her parents to enroll her in facility). In\nother words, if a placement reasonably calculated to educate the\nchild could be provided in a non-residential school or if a parent\n\f                                18\nsends her child to a residential program primarily to treat the\nchild’s emotional, social, or psychological issues, then the\nplacement is not “necessary to provide a free appropriate public\neducation.” Contrary to DCPS’s argument, however, neither of\nthese principles bars reimbursement here.\n      To begin with, the record demonstrates that the Grier\nplacement was primarily educational and not “a response to\nmedical, social or emotional problems that are segregable from the\nlearning process.” True, K.E.’s educational difficulties can be\ntraced to her social issues—as well as her anxiety and depression,\nwhich are, of course, “emotional problems,” though not of the\n“explosive” and debilitating variety present in McKenzie, see 771\nF.2d at 1533—but nothing in the record indicates that Leggett sent\nK.E. to Grier to receive medical care. Instead, K.E. went there to\nreceive the help her IEP team and two psychologists identified as\nnecessary to her education, including small classes, individualized\ntutoring, and life-skills instruction. Indeed, Grier, which the\nHearing Officer found was “not a residential treatment center or a\ntherapeutic boarding school,” Hearing Officer Determination at\n20, and which the district court agreed was “not primarily a school\nfor kids with learning or emotional issues,” K.E. v. District of\nColumbia, 19 F. Supp. 3d at 152, offered those precise benefits.\nSee, e.g., Due Process Hearing, Testimony of Learning Skills\nTeacher at 176–182; see also Munir v. Pottsville Area School\nDistrict, 723 F.3d 423, 433 (3d Cir. 2013) (“the fact that classes\nare offered may provide evidence that the purpose of the placement\nis, in fact, educational”). The Hearing Officer found as much,\nconcluding that “[K.E.] is doing well at [Grier],” “turning her\nschool work in and showing improvement . . . .” Hearing Officer\nDecision at 13. The results confirm that conclusion: whereas K.E.\nhad fallen behind at Wilson, she was an above-average student at\nGrier. See id. at 13. Because the placement was thus “primarily\noriented toward enabling [K.E.] to obtain an education,” Dale M.\nex rel. Alice M. v. Board of Education of Bradley-Bourbonnais\nHigh School District No. 307, 237 F.3d 813, 817 (7th Cir. 2001),\n\f                                 19\nit was, under the regulation, “necessary to provide a free\nappropriate public education” to her.\n     The Grier program was “necessary” in another significant—\nindeed, dispositive—way: it was the only placement on the record\nthat could have provided K.E. with an education that met her\nidentified needs. DCPS neither offered an IEP by the start of the\nyear nor identified—before the hearing officer, in the district court,\nor here—an alternative placement of any kind. In fact, it failed\neven to challenge Leggett’s assertion—repeated at every stage of\nthe proceedings—that she considered more than a dozen schools,\nthat only two were appropriate, and that one of those denied K.E.\nadmission. Instead, DCPS has repeatedly insisted, against all logic,\nthat the Wilson IEP itself offered the required “educational\nbenefits,” despite the fact that it did not exist in any form when the\nWilson school year began—or even until a month into the school\nyear, when K.E. was already firmly ensconced at Grier. To be\nsure, had DCPS offered K.E. a spot at a less expensive day school\nin the District—or just identified one early enough in the\nprocess—the Grier placement may not have been “necessary.”\nIndeed, as explained above, to fulfill its obligations under the Act,\nDCPS had no obligation to offer K.E. a program as good as\nGrier’s. See Rowley, 458 U.S. at 197 n.21 (education need not be\n“potential[]maximizing”). Under Rowley, the Act required it to\noffer a program “reasonably calculated to enable [K.E.] to receive\neducational benefits.” See id. at 207. But because school officials\noffered her no such program, either in the public schools or a non-\nresidential private school, the Grier placement was quite plainly\n“necessary” for K.E. to obtain the educational services she was\nentitled to under IDEA.\n    In this sense, Leggett’s case resembles McKenzie v. Smith in a\nway that helps her. Although we noted the distinction between\neducational and medical placements in McKenzie, we ultimately\nconcluded that DCPS would have to pay for the student’s boarding\nschool because there, as here, “DCPS . . . failed at every stage in\n\f                                 20\nthe proceedings to comply with . . . its obligations under [IDEA].”\n771 F.2d at 1535. And there, as here, the placement was “the only\nprogram supported by any evidence in the record” that could\nplausibly offer educational benefit to the child. Id. Under these\ncircumstances, we concluded, DCPS had no basis for faulting his\nparents for sending him to the private residential school they\nultimately chose.\n     So too here. Because Grier was “necessary” to K.E.’s\neducation and because it was “reasonably calculated to provide\neducational benefit,” it was “proper under the Act.” Under the\nstatute and regulations, therefore, DCPS must reimburse Leggett\nfor her costs. Although this conclusion applies most comfortably to\nGrier’s tuition, it extends to room and board as well. The\nregulation expressly requires that “the placement, including . . .\nroom and board, shall be provided at no cost to the [child] or his or\nher parents or guardian” if it is “necessary” to the child’s\neducation. 34 C.F.R. § 104.33(c)(3). Because K.E. could not\npossibly have attended Grier, some three hours from the District,\nwithout living there, the school’s residential program was clearly\n“necessary” and thus reimbursable.\n     Before moving on, we must address one final issue. Although\nnot saying so expressly, DCPS appears to argue that even if the\nGrier School program as a whole was proper under the Act, certain\ncomponents were not. When parts of a placement are not primarily\noriented toward education—that is, when those parts are not the\nkind of “special education and related services” the Act\nguarantees—“the school district is not obligated to bear the total\ncost of the placement.” King v. Pine Plains Central School\nDistrict, 918 F. Supp. 772, 778 (S.D.N.Y. 1996). Instead, it must\ncover the cost of the educational portion of the program “but need\nnot fund . . . non-educational expenses.” Id. Although we have\nconcluded that Grier’s educational and residential programs were\n“necessary” because DCPS had offered K.E. no alternative, the\nschool system may, on remand, seek to demonstrate that specific\n\f                                 21\ncomponents of the placement, such as extracurricular activities or\nthe horseback riding to which DCPS so vociferously objects, were\nnot “primarily oriented toward” educating K.E., Dale M., 237\nF.3d at 817, and were therefore not “necessary” under the Act.\n                                 C.\n     This, then, brings us to the final question, i.e., the equities.\nRecall that IDEA allows a district court to “reduce[] or den[y]”\nreimbursement—even if the placement meets all of the Act’s other\nrequirements—based “upon a . . . finding of unreasonableness with\nrespect to actions taken by the parents.” 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1412(10)(C)(iii)(III); see also Carter, 510 U.S. at 16. Acting\non that invitation, the district court found—and DCPS continues to\nargue—that Leggett behaved unreasonably in several ways: by\n“remov[ing] K.E. from Wilson three weeks before the start of the\nschool year, at a time when the District had not yet failed in its\nobligations”; by placing K.E. at a school that “is not primarily a\nschool for kids with learning and emotional issues”; by failing to\nchallenge the IEP DCPS officials created for K.E. in September\n2012; and by choosing a school “far from the District of\nColumbia” with “an annual cost of $[58,100].” K.E. v. District of\nColumbia, 19 F. Supp. 3d at 152. In our view, and given the\nrecord before us, none of these actions was unreasonable.\n     To begin with, we think it quite unremarkable that Leggett\npursued a private placement for K.E. over the summer and then\nnotified DCPS of the withdrawal in early August. As explained\nabove, faced with school officials who were not responding to her\nphone calls or emails, who failed to provide the promised summer\ncounseling, and who had yet to show any sign of producing an IEP\nin time for the school year, Leggett did what any parent would do:\nshe began exploring other opportunities for her child. Even so, her\nlawyer’s letter notifying officials of the Grier placement made\nclear that she “remain[ed] open” to keeping K.E. at Wilson and\nwould “seriously consider” it if DCPS provided her with an IEP.\nSee Massarsky Letter. But having failed to do so by the beginning\n\f                                  22\nof school, DCPS left Leggett with no choice but to send her\ndaughter to Grier, lest she risk the child spending another year at\nWilson without an IEP. Nothing about the timing of Leggett’s\nactions was unreasonable.\n      Defending the court’s second reason, although DCPS argued\nearlier that the Grier placement was improper because it was\nprimarily oriented toward K.E.’s “medical, social or emotional”\nneeds, see supra 19, it now faults Leggett for sending K.E. to a\nschool that was not restrictive enough. See Appellee’s Br. 40\n(“Grier . . . offered little if any specialized instruction for children\nwith learning or emotional disabilities.”). IDEA, however, requires\nthat a child be educated in the least restrictive environment\npossible—that is, the one that provides “some educational benefit”\nand “most closely approximates” the education a disabled child\nwould receive if she had no disability, Kerkam v. Superintendent,\nDistrict of Columbia Public Schools, 931 F.2d 84, 86 (D.C. Cir.\n1991); see also 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A). (“to the maximum\nextent appropriate, children with disabilities . . . are educated with\nchildren who are not disabled”). Given this, we cannot see how the\nfact that Grier was designed to help K.E. thrive educationally in a\nnormal classroom environment could possibly be a strike against\nit.\n     Nor can Leggett’s failure to challenge the IEP DCPS finally\ndid develop—some four weeks after the school year began—have\nany bearing on the reasonableness of her actions with respect to the\nplacement at Grier. After all, IDEA requires the school system to\nhave an IEP in place by the start of the school year, so it cannot be\nthat Leggett had to challenge an IEP that was completed in late\nSeptember and that she did not see until sometime in October\nbefore she could obtain reimbursement for a placement she chose\nin August.\n    Although not saying so directly, DCPS seems to imply that\nLeggett’s failure to object to the IEP was significant because K.E.\ncould have returned to Wilson for the second semester of the 2012\n\f                                  23\nschool year, after school officials had completed the allegedly\nacceptable IEP. Before even considering that possibility, however,\nwe would need to know a lot more: Was the IEP in fact adequate?\nWould returning to Wilson have unduly disrupted K.E.’s\neducation? Were K.E.’s tuition, room and board, and other fees\nrefundable mid-year? Neither DCPS nor the record tells us\nanything about these critical questions. We thus leave it to the\ndistrict court to give DCPS an opportunity—should it want one—\nto show that Leggett’s failure to return K.E. to Wilson for the\nsecond half of the 2012–13 school year was unreasonable.\n      Finally, DCPS insists that it was per se unreasonable for\nLeggett to choose a school that was a three-hour drive from the\nDistrict of Columbia and cost $58,100 per year. True, “total\nreimbursement will not be appropriate if the court determines that\nthe cost of the private education was unreasonable.” Carter, 510\nU.S. at 16. And $58,000 is a lot of money. But if a student\nrequires special education, if school officials fail to offer it, and if\nthe only private school that could serve the student’s needs—that\nis, the only school “reasonably calculated to offer educational\nbenefit”—is not within commuting distance and costs $58,000 (or\neven more) then it cannot be unreasonable for the child’s parent to\nsend her there. Here, because DCPS offered no IEP at Wilson,\nidentified no suitable alternative, and failed even to challenge\nLeggett’s claim that Grier was the only available placement, Grier\nwas “the only program supported by any evidence in the record,”\nMcKenzie, 771 F.2d at 1535. It was thus not “unreasonable” for\nLeggett to send K.E. there.\n                                     D.\n     To sum up, given that DCPS failed to provide K.E. a FAPE at\nWilson or anywhere else, that the Grier placement was\n“reasonably calculated to offer educational benefit,” that the\nresidential program was “necessary” to achieve that objective, and\nthat DCPS has, on this record, failed to show that Leggett acted\n“unreasonabl[y],” Leggett is entitled under the Act and the\n\f                                 24\nregulation to reimbursement for tuition, room and board, and any\nother costs necessary to attend Grier. That said, on remand the\ndistrict court may reduce this amount if, as explained above, the\nIEP DCPS finally generated was adequate and the school district\ncan demonstrate that Leggett’s refusal to return K.E. to Wilson at\nthe end of the first semester was “unreasonable[].” 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1412(10)(C)(iii)(III). (Leggett’s eligibility for reimbursement\nfor the 2013–14 school year is the subject of a different case.) The\ndistrict court may also deny reimbursement for any cost, e.g.,\nextracurricular activities, horseback riding, or excessive travel,\nthat it finds was either not “primarily oriented toward enabling\n[K.E.] to obtain an education,” Dale M., 237 F.3d at 817—that is,\nnot “necessary” within the meaning of the regulation—or\notherwise “unreasonable,” Carter, 510 U.S. at 16 (“Courts\nfashioning discretionary equitable relief under IDEA must\nconsider all relevant factors, including the appropriate and\nreasonable level of reimbursement that should be required. Total\nreimbursement will not be appropriate if the court determines that\nthe cost of the private education was unreasonable.”).\n                                III.\n     We understand that requiring a school system to reimburse\nparents for the costs of expensive private boarding schools diverts\nfunds away from public education. But where, as here, the school\ndistrict has failed to provide a free appropriate public education in\neither a public or a non-residential private school, where the\nresidential school the parent selected is “reasonably calculated to\nprovide educational benefits,” where the residential component of\nthat school is “necessary” for the child to attend that school, and\nwhere the school system has not shown that the parent acted\nunreasonably, IDEA requires reimbursement for tuition, room and\nboard, and other related educational expenses—even if costly.\nMoreover, and contrary to the district court’s fear that if Leggett\nprevails parents will have “carte blanche” to choose an expensive\nprivate school, K.E. v. District of Columbia, 19 F. Supp. 3d at\n\f                                25\n151, the Supreme Court emphasized in Carter that under IDEA,\nschool officials have complete control over the situation, i.e., to\navoid burdensome reimbursement obligations, they need only offer\neach child a free appropriate public education, either in a public\nschool or in a private school the district chooses. Carter, 510 U.S.\nat 15–16. This, according to the Court, “is IDEA’s mandate, and\nschool officials who conform to it need not worry about\nreimbursement claims.” Id. at 15. Like any other public school\nsystem, then, DCPS can avoid cases like this one simply by\nensuring that its employees understand and fulfill the school\nsystem’s obligations under IDEA—to provide a FAPE and to do\nso in a timely manner—and that they answer the phone when it\nrings.\n    For the foregoing reasons, we reverse and remand for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                                       So ordered.\n\f",

Accordingly, we reverse and remand for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                  I.\n     Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\n(IDEA), every child with a disability in this country is entitled to a\n“free appropriate public education,” or FAPE. 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1400(d)(1)(A). As Congress explained when it passed IDEA, the\nAct’s primary purpose is “to ensure that all children with\n\f                                  3\ndisabilities have available to them a[n] . . . education that\nemphasizes special education and related services designed to\n. . . prepare them for further education, employment, and\nindependent living.” Id. “Special education,” in turn, means,\nsimply, instruction “specially designed . . . to meet the unique\nneeds of a child with a disability.” Id. § 1401(29).\n     To guarantee that no child with a disability misses out on the\neducation the Act promises, and to ensure, in turn, that the\neducation offered is “appropriate,” IDEA requires that school\nofficials develop a comprehensive strategy, known as an\n“individualized education program,” or IEP, tailored to the\nstudent’s unique needs. Id. § 1414(d)(1)(A). Critical to the issue\nbefore us, IDEA requires that school districts have an IEP in place\nfor each student with a disability “[a]t the beginning of each school\nyear.” Id. § 1414(d)(2)(A).\n     Although Congress envisioned that children with disabilities\nwould normally be educated in “the regular public schools or in\nprivate schools chosen jointly by school officials and parents,”\nFlorence County School District Four v. Carter By and Through\nCarter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112910\"><a href=\"/opinion/112910/florence-county-school-dist-four-v-carter/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 12 (1993), it provided that parents who\nbelieve that their child’s public school system failed to offer a free\nappropriate public education—either because the child’s IEP was\ninadequate or because school officials never even developed one—\nmay choose to enroll the child in a private school that serves her\neducational needs. Id. Specifically, IDEA provides that if parents\n“enroll the child in a private . . . school without the consent of [the\nschool district], a court or a hearing officer may require the [school\ndistrict] to reimburse [them] for the cost of that enrollment . . . .”\n20 U.S.C. § 1412(10)(C)(ii). The statute requires reimbursement,\nhowever, only where the school district has failed to “ma[k]e a free\nappropriate public education available to the child.” Id.\nReimbursement, moreover, may be “reduced or denied” if the\nparents fail to notify school officials of their intent to withdraw the\nchild, id. § 1412(10)(C)(iii)(I), deny them a chance to evaluate the\n\f                                  4\nstudent, id. § 1412(10)(C)(iii)(II), or, of special relevance here,\notherwise act “unreasonabl[y],” id. § 1412(10)(C)(iii)(III).\n     In regulations that largely track these provisions, the\nDepartment of Education has made clear that parents can obtain\nreimbursement even for residential programs. Specifically, the\nregulations state that “[i]f a public or private residential placement\nis necessary to provide a free appropriate public education to a\nhandicapped [child] because of his or her handicap, the placement,\nincluding non-medical care and room and board, shall be provided\nat no cost to the [child] or his or her parents or guardian.” 34\nC.F.R. § 104.33(c)(3).\n     Elucidating these provisions, the Supreme Court explained in\nSchool Committee of Town of Burlington v. Department of\nEducation of Massachusetts that it is the Act’s grant of equitable\nauthority that empowers a court “to order school authorities to\nreimburse parents for their expenditures on private special\neducation for a child if the court ultimately determines that such\nplacement . . . is proper under the Act.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111420\"><a href=\"/opinion/111420/burlington-school-comm-v-mass-dept-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">359</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 369 (1985).\nIn such cases, “parents who disagree with the proposed IEP are\nfaced with a choice: go along with the IEP to the detriment of their\nchild if it turns out to be inappropriate or pay for what they\nconsider to be the appropriate placement.” Id. at 370. For parents\nwho make the latter choice, the Court reasoned, “it would be an\nempty victory to have a court tell them several years later that they\nwere right but that these expenditures could not in a proper case be\nreimbursed by the school officials.” Id. Because such a result\nwould be contrary to IDEA’s guarantee of a “free appropriate\npublic education,” the Court confirmed that “Congress meant to\ninclude retroactive reimbursement to parents as an available\nremedy in a proper case.” Id.\n    A decade later, and again considering the conditions under\nwhich reimbursement for a parental placement is appropriate, the\nCourt reiterated in Florence County School District Four v.\nCarter that IDEA empowers courts to order school officials to\n\f                                  5\nreimburse parents for their expenditures on private special\neducation if the private placement was “‘proper under the Act.’”\n510 U.S. at 12 (quoting Burlington, 471 U.S. at 369). In setting\nout that requirement, the Court acknowledged that “Congress has\nimposed a significant financial burden on states and school\ndistricts that participate in IDEA.” Id. at 17. But school districts,\nthe Court observed, have complete control over their fate: “public\neducational authorities who want to avoid reimbursing parents for\nthe private education of a disabled child can do [so by] . . . giv[ing]\nthe child a free appropriate public education in a public setting, or\nplac[ing] the child in an appropriate private setting of the State’s\nchoice.” Id. This, according to the Court, “is IDEA’s mandate, and\nschool officials who conform to it need not worry about\nreimbursement claims.” Id.\n     In this case, we must determine the precise contours of these\nrequirements: Under what circumstances does the school district’s\nfailure to offer an IEP by the start of the year—either in a public or\nprivate school—amount to a denial of FAPE? When is a private\nboarding-school placement “proper under the Act”? And what\nfactors must a court consider when addressing the equities? But\ngiven that these issues arise in the context of the education of a\nparticular child—Appellant Jane Leggett’s teenage daughter\nK.E.—we turn first to the facts.\n     Now nineteen years old, K.E. attended school in the District of\nColumbia Public Schools, or DCPS, from kindergarten through\nthe end of her first attempt at the eleventh grade in 2012. While in\nelementary school, K.E. was diagnosed with several learning\nissues, including “deficits in auditory awareness and in fine motor\nskills.” Hearing Officer Determination at 4. Although her\nelementary school provided her with special education, her middle\nschool did not. Still, when K.E. entered Wilson High School in\n2009, Leggett asked school officials to evaluate her daughter for\nlearning disabilities. The school agreed to perform that evaluation,\n\f                                 6\nbut it had failed to do so by the fall of 2011 when K.E. began her\njunior year.\n     By October of that year, although K.E. had been identified as\na student of above-average intelligence, she was failing most of her\nclasses, often due to inattention, disorganization, and anxiety.\nDispirited by her personal and academic struggles, K.E. threatened\nsuicide that same fall. In February 2012, spurred on by K.E.’s\nefforts to harm herself and the news that she would probably fail to\ngraduate if things did not change, Leggett again asked school\nofficials to evaluate her daughter. When the school district\nrefused—instead recommending that Leggett pay for a private\nassessment—Leggett filed a due-process complaint seeking a\ncomprehensive evaluation to determine K.E.’s eligibility for\nspecial education. See 20 U.S.C. § 1415(f) (providing for an\n“impartial due process hearing, which shall be conducted by the\nState educational agency or by the local educational agency”).\nWhen school officials finally agreed to undertake the necessary\ntesting, Leggett withdrew her complaint.\n     The resulting evaluations demonstrated that although K.E.’s\nverbal skills were in the “superior” range, her non-verbal cognitive\nabilities were “low-average” and she demonstrated weakness in\nexecutive functions, including organization, planning, and\nprocessing speed. Even more worrisome, DCPS’s own\npsychologist concluded that K.E.’s anxiety and depression were\n“disabling” to her “life functions,” Hearing Officer Determination\nat 8, and K.E.’s private doctor diagnosed her with Major\nDepressive Disorder, Panic Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress\nDisorder, an Identity Problem, a Reading Disorder, and Attention-\nDeficit Hyperactivity Disorder. To combat those conditions, the\nprivate psychologist recommended that K.E. be placed in a “small,\nhighly structured therapeutic classroom with a low student to\nteacher ratio throughout her day” and proposed a “more intensive\neducational program” for K.E., including benchmarking of reading\nfluency, strategies to support reading comprehension, and\nevidence-based cognitive behavioral strategies for depression and\n\f                                 7\nanxiety. Neuropsychological Evaluation at 6–7; Due Process\nHearing, Testimony of Dr. Culotta at 138.\n     Given these recommendations, Wilson officials convened a\nteam in the weeks following final exams to develop an IEP for\nK.E. for the next school year. See 20 U.S.C. § 1414(b)(4)(A)\n(“[T]he determination of whether the child is a child with a\ndisability as defined in [the Act] and the educational needs of the\nchild shall be made by a team of qualified professionals and the\nparent of the child . . . .”). Following two June meetings, however,\nthe team had yet to complete the IEP, so it agreed to meet again in\nlate August to finalize the plan. The team also recommended that,\nin the meantime, K.E. receive counseling over the summer. On\nJune 21, just a week after the IEP team had met, Leggett emailed\nWilson’s Special Education Coordinator to pin down the details of\nthe August meeting and to ask for guidance on the recommended\nsummer counseling. She received no response. Facing a summer\nwithout the recommended assistance, Leggett next left a voicemail\nmessage for the Coordinator. No response. Finally, Leggett sent a\nletter in early July to the same effect. Again, nothing.\n    Having received no indication that DCPS would finalize\nK.E.’s IEP before the school year began, and thus with no\nassurance that K.E. would get the special-education services she\nneeded, Leggett began exploring alternative placements. She\ninvestigated “literally dozens” of possible schools, but she found\nonly two that appeared to meet K.E.’s needs. One, a local private\nday school, rejected K.E. on the ground that a “highly structured,\nsupportive school or therapeutic setting” would better serve her\nneeds. The other, the Grier School—a boarding school in\nPennsylvania—accepted her for the upcoming term.\n    On August 6, just three weeks before the Wilson school year\nwould begin, Leggett sent DCPS written notice, as the Act\nrequires, see 20 U.S.C. § 1412(10)(C)(iii)(I)(bb), that she would\nbe withdrawing K.E. from Wilson and seeking public funding for\nher placement at the Grier School. Critical for our purposes,\n\f                                  8\nLeggett’s communication made clear that she “remain[ed] open\nto” the possibility that K.E. could return to Wilson if the school\noffered her a satisfactory IEP. Letter from Benjamin W.\nMassarsky to Peter Cahall, Principal, Woodrow Wilson High\nSchool, Aug. 6, 2012. Again, no response. Having heard nothing\nby August 17, just 10 days before the first day of the Wilson\nschool year, Leggett filed a new due-process complaint seeking\neither an acceptable IEP at Wilson or reimbursement for the cost\nof attending Grier.\n     Five days before the first day of school, Leggett finally heard\nfrom DCPS when school officials contacted her to schedule a\n“resolution meeting.” The record does not indicate what happened\nat that meeting, and although the parties agreed at oral argument\nthat the meeting occurred on August 29, neither could offer any\ndetails. Everyone agrees, however, that the session resulted in no\nIEP. On September 4, without an IEP in place and with no\nguarantee that K.E. would receive the special education she\nrequired if she returned to Wilson, Leggett enrolled her at Grier.\n     By all accounts, K.E. thrived there. The school offered her\nindividualized tutoring, life-skills instruction, and extra study hall,\nall coordinated under the rubric of Grier’s Learning Skills\nProgram, and all consistent with her psychologists’\nrecommendations. The proof is in the results: whereas K.E. had\nfailed to complete the eleventh grade at Wilson, she pulled all A’s\nand B’s in her first semester at Grier.\n     Meanwhile, on September 11, more than two weeks into the\nWilson school year, K.E.’s IEP team met once again to try to\nfinalize her plan. By September 24, officials had come up with a\ndocument, but according to Leggett, the IEP was riddled with\nerrors and failed to include many of the special-education\nprograms K.E. needed. DCPS, by contrast, insists that the\ndocument was substantively valid, if sloppily done. Whichever\nversion one credits, though, DCPS officials clearly had no IEP in\n\f                                 9\nplace for K.E. by the time the Wilson year began, or even by the\ntime she had to enroll at Grier.\n     In late October, a Hearing Officer took up Leggett’s request\nfor reimbursement for the tuition and fees she had paid to Grier.\nAlthough the Officer found that DCPS had denied K.E. a free\nappropriate public education, he nonetheless concluded that the\nGrier placement was improper because K.E. had no need to be in a\nresidential program. See Hearing Officer Determination at 16–20.\nAccordingly, he denied Leggett any reimbursement at all.\n     Pursuant to IDEA’s judicial-review provision, 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1415(i)(2)(A), Leggett filed two law suits against DCPS in the\nU.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, one seeking\nreimbursement for the 2012–13 school year and the other for\n2013–14. In the matter before us now—the 2012–13 suit—the\nparties filed cross motions for summary judgment and, basing its\ndecision entirely on the administrative record, the district court\ndenied Leggett’s request for reimbursement for much the same\nreason as the Hearing Officer had, adding only that in its\nestimation, Leggett had acted unreasonably by withdrawing K.E.\nfrom Wilson in August and sending her to an expensive boarding\nschool.

Leggett and DCPS disagree at every turn.\nLeggett argues that DCPS’s failure to provide K.E. an IEP by the\nbeginning of the 2012 school year itself constituted an IDEA\nviolation, that the placement at Grier was proper, and that nothing\nin the record suggests that she acted unreasonably. In her view,\ntherefore, the equities weigh in her favor and she is entitled to\nreimbursement. For its part, DCPS argues that any IDEA violation\nwas procedural and thus not a denial of FAPE, that the Grier\nplacement was improper because K.E. could have succeeded in a\nnon-residential program, and that Leggett acted unreasonably in\nher dealings with Wilson administrators. Accordingly, it argues,\nLeggett is entitled to no reimbursement at all. We address each\npoint in turn.\n                                  A.\n     Recall that the IEP is the vehicle through which school\ndistricts typically fulfill their statutory obligation to provide a free\nappropriate public education and that officials must have an IEP in\nplace for each student with a disability “[a]t the beginning of each\nschool year.” 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(2)(A). DCPS concedes that it\nfailed to satisfy that timeliness requirement with respect to K.E.\nThe parties part ways, however, over the import of that\nuncontested fact. According to Leggett, DCPS’s failure to offer\nK.E. an IEP by the first day of school was, by itself, a denial of\nFAPE, thus satisfying the first of IDEA’s three requirements for\nprivate-school reimbursement. DCPS’s own Hearing Officer\n\f                                 11\nagreed: “I find . . . that DCPS’[s] failure to develop an IEP for\n[K.E.] before the start of the 2012–2013 school year . . . was a\nclear denial of FAPE.” Hearing Officer Determination at 17.\nDisagreeing with that conclusion, DCPS argues that the IEP\nviolation was procedural and de minimis and, therefore, not a\ndenial of FAPE.\n     DCPS has the standard correct: a procedural violation, such\nas a school district’s failure to provide an IEP by the beginning of\nthe school year, will constitute a denial of a free appropriate public\neducation only if it “result[s] in loss of educational opportunity”\nfor the student. Lesesne ex rel. B.F. v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186671\"><a href=\"/opinion/186671/lesesne-lakeisha-v-dc/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">828</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 834 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). That is, a school district’s failure to comply with the\nprocedural requirements of IDEA will be “actionable” only “if\nthose procedural violations affected the student’s substantive\nrights.” Id. at 832, 834 (emphasis omitted).\n     Applying that standard to the circumstances of this case,\nDCPS argues that Leggett has not “demonstrated” that its failure\nto offer K.E. an IEP by the beginning of the 2012 school year—a\ndelay of somewhere between two weeks and a month, depending\non whose facts one credits—amounted to “an educational\ndeprivation or substantive violation.” Appellee’s Br. 23. To be\nsure, this court has at times required parents to “demonstrate . . .\nthat [the student’s] education was affected by any procedural\nviolations [the school district] might have committed,” Lesesne,\n447 F.3d at 834. We have done so, however, only where the\nviolation was not obviously substantive. See, e.g., id. (plaintiff\nfailed to demonstrate that the school district’s failure to satisfy\nmid-year IEP deadline was a substantive violation). And in the\nparticular circumstances of this case, we think the violation was\nquite clearly substantive. Although “[a] delay does not affect\nsubstantive rights if the student’s education would not have been\ndifferent had there been no delay,” D.R. ex rel. Robinson v.\nGovernment of District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2383396\"><a href=\"/opinion/2383396/dr-ex-rel-robinson-v-government-of-the-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">637</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

That is the case\nhere. DCPS concedes—and the Hearing Officer found—that K.E.\nneeded an IEP that included special education and related services.\nSee Hearing Officer Determination at 16 (noting that K.E. was\n“determined to be eligible for special education and related\nservices” and describing “her IEP needs”); see also Appellee’s Br.\n5–7 (“The [IEP] team agreed at the May 2012 meeting that K.E.\nwas eligible for special education services.”). Put another way,\nDCPS acknowledges that K.E.’s education would have been\ndifferent if school officials had fulfilled their statutory\nresponsibilities on time: with an IEP in place at Wilson, K.E.\nwould have received the targeted special education she needed;\nwithout an IEP and still at Wilson, she would have been on her\nown, much as she was for the first three years of high school,\nduring which she struggled mightily. Under these circumstances,\nDCPS’s failure to have an IEP in place by the start of the school\nyear—in clear violation of its IDEA obligations—adversely\naffected K.E.’s educational opportunities and therefore denied her\na FAPE. DCPS’s arguments to the contrary are without merit.\n      First, although its logic is far from clear, DCPS seems to\ncontend that Leggett is actually to blame for the violation because\nshe “had already decided” to send K.E. to a private boarding\nschool some three weeks before the start of the school year, while\nschool officials were still doing their best to get an IEP in place.\nAppellee’s Br. 23. According to DCPS, then, it was Leggett’s fault\nthat school officials ran out of time and so it was Leggett, not\nDCPS, who effectively caused K.E. to lose out on educational\nopportunities. That is, it was Leggett who transformed the absence\nof an IEP from a procedural deficiency into a substantive harm. In\nthis sense, the school system argues, this case looks a lot like C.H.\nv. Cape Henlopen School District, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"147102\"><a href=\"/opinion/147102/ch-v-cape-henlopen-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">606</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 2010).\nThere, like here, the school district failed to complete an IEP for\n\f                                  13\nthe student before the start of the school year. And, like here, the\nchild’s mother elected to withdraw him from his public school,\nplace him in a private school, and seek reimbursement. Denying\nreimbursement, the Third Circuit found that the delay was\nprocedural, not substantive, because the parent had caused it.\nAlthough the school district missed the deadline, it had\ndemonstrated a “consistent willingness to evaluate C.H. and to\ndevelop an IEP.” Id. at 69. “[T]he [p]arents,” however, “delayed\nthe continuation of [the IEP] meeting until after the start of classes,\nand ultimately terminated the process by filing a due process\nrequest.” Id. Under those circumstances, the court held, the school\ndistrict’s failure to adopt a final IEP before the first day of school\ndid not violate the student’s substantive rights.\n      By contrast, the record in this case contains no evidence that\nLeggett’s decision to withdraw K.E. from Wilson prevented school\nofficials from developing an IEP. Indeed, although Leggett notified\nWilson on August 6 that K.E. would enroll at Grier to start the\nschool year, she expressly left open the possibility that K.E. could\ninstead begin the year in public school if officials were prepared to\nprovide the special education that even the school system agreed\nshe needed. See Massarsky Letter. What is more, even if Leggett\nhad never made this offer and instead had summarily withdrawn\nK.E. from Wilson, nothing would have stopped DCPS from\nfulfilling its statutory obligation to complete an IEP by the\nbeginning of the school year. This case thus looks nothing like\nCape Henlopen. There the court pointed to evidence that the\nschool district would likely have gotten an IEP together but for the\nparent’s intransigence. Here Leggett had made K.E. available for\nevaluation, and she remained open to leaving her daughter at\nWilson until she had to enroll at Grier. DCPS had until the\nbeginning of the Wilson school year to create an IEP for K.E. It is\nentirely illogical for the school system to blame Leggett for its\nfailure to do so.\n\f                                 14\n     DCPS next argues that Leggett’s own communications with\nschool officials show that those officials were acting in good faith.\nFor instance, it points out that Leggett told the Special Education\nCoordinator that she had “sent a set of proposed [classroom]\naccommodations to the special education teacher and had talked\nmore with the school social worker about goals for the behavioral\nsection of the IEP.” Appellee’s Br. 8 (internal quotation marks\nomitted) (alteration in original). Of course, these communications\nmerely highlight the fact that despite Leggett’s repeated entreaties,\nno IEP materialized. But DCPS’s argument gets even more\npreposterous. Seeking to demonstrate that Leggett should have\nknown that school officials were on the road to an IEP, the school\nsystem observes that Leggett, “[f]ollowing up on [its] offer of\ncounseling for K.E. during the summer, . . . suggested a specific\ntherapeutic program in Connecticut, where K.E. would be\nspending most of the summer with her grandmother.” Id. at 8–9.\nThe implication seems to be that Leggett had to have known that\nK.E. would be taken care of because school officials were\nconsidering summer placements. But we fail to see how Leggett’s\ncommunication regarding her own efforts to find a summer\nprogram for K.E. could possibly demonstrate the school district’s\ngood faith when school officials failed to respond to that very\ncommunication.\n      Moreover, nothing in IDEA required Leggett to wait until the\nfirst day of school to pull K.E. out of Wilson. In fact, the Act\nexpressly prohibited her from waiting that long. IDEA requires a\nparent to notify the school district ten days before she sends her\nchild to private school to remedy an IDEA violation. See 20\nU.S.C. § 1412(10)(C)(iii)(I)(bb). On DCPS’s reading, Leggett\nshould have given school officials a chance to finish the IEP by the\nfirst day of school at Wilson before withdrawing K.E. But had\nLeggett waited that long she would have been entitled to no\nreimbursement because she would have violated the ten-day notice\nrequirement. DCPS, therefore, asks us both to require parents to\n\f                                 15\nnotify school officials ten days out and to penalize Leggett for\nnotifying them too early. DCPS cannot have it both ways.\n     In sum, then, Leggett’s actions imposed no impediments to\nDCPS fulfilling its statutory responsibilities. Quite to the contrary,\nit was DCPS’s failure to develop an IEP that forced Leggett’s\nhand. School officials acknowledged in June 2012 that K.E.\nneeded an IEP. Yet they responded to none of Leggett’s\ncommunications, fulfilled none of their statutory responsibilities,\nand left her in a position in which the only way to find out if DCPS\nwould ever develop an IEP would have been to leave K.E. at\nWilson despite lacking any evidence that the school was close to\nhaving a plan ready. IDEA prohibits school districts from forcing\nparents to make that kind of decision.\n      For all of these reasons, we agree with the Hearing Officer\nand the district court that DCPS denied K.E. a free appropriate\npublic education by failing to have an IEP in place by the\nbeginning of the school year. The school system, of course, may\nstill escape liability if the placement at Grier was otherwise\nimproper under the Act or if Leggett acted unreasonably, questions\nto which we now turn.\n                                 B.\n      The parties offer dueling tests for determining whether the\nGrier School placement was “‘proper under the Act.’” Carter, 510\nU.S. at 12 (quoting Burlington, 471 U.S. at 369). According to\nLeggett, the placement was proper because Grier offered K.E. the\ntools she needed to complete her education. As DCPS would have\nit, the critical factor is that Grier is a residential school—one with\nan equestrian program, it repeatedly emphasizes. Because K.E.\ncould have succeeded in a non-residential school, DCPS argues,\nthe placement was improper.\n     We begin with what is undisputed: under the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Rowley, a public school district need not guarantee the\nbest possible education or even a “potential-maximizing” one. 458\n\f                                 16\nU.S. at 197 n.21.

District of\nColumbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186533\"><a href=\"/opinion/186533/branham-irene-v-govt-dc/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (IEP need not\nmaximize the child’s development as long as it “provide[s] some\n[educational] benefit”) (internal quotation marks omitted). True,\nas DCPS points out, the Supreme Court enunciated this principle,\nand this court has echoed it, in the context of disputes over whether\nthe education the school district offered was proper. But we\nbelieve the standard applies as well where, as here, the parent\nmakes the choice. Whether the school system or the parent chooses\nthe private school, the Rowley standard protects the child by\nguaranteeing an education “reasonably calculated” to benefit her.\nAs we explain below, moreover, where the parent selects the\nprivate school because the school system failed to provide a FAPE\nand the court finds that the school the parent selected is\n“reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational\nbenefits,” the court may still “reduce[] or den[y]” reimbursement if\n“[e]quitable considerations” warrant it—for instance, “if the cost\nof the private education was unreasonable.” Carter, 510 U.S. at\n16. In this way, and consistent with Rowley, we ensure not only\nthat the child’s IDEA rights are fully protected, but also that the\nschool system will not be required to fund a program that exceeds\nwhat the child needs to obtain a “free appropriate public\neducation.”\n     Employing the Rowley standard where the parent chooses the\nschool is also consistent with the practice of our sister circuits. In\nthe decision the Supreme Court affirmed in Carter, for instance,\nthe Fourth Circuit held that “when a public school system has\ndefaulted on its obligations under the Act, a private school\nplacement is ‘proper under the Act’ if the education provided by\nthe private school is ‘reasonably calculated to enable the child to\nreceive educational benefits,’—the same standard by which the\nappropriateness of a public school’s IEP is assessed.” Carter By\nand Through Carter v.

DCPS urges us to apply a more exacting\nstandard because Grier is a boarding school.

In\nother words, if a placement reasonably calculated to educate the\nchild could be provided in a non-residential school or if a parent\n\f                                18\nsends her child to a residential program primarily to treat the\nchild’s emotional, social, or psychological issues, then the\nplacement is not “necessary to provide a free appropriate public\neducation.” Contrary to DCPS’s argument, however, neither of\nthese principles bars reimbursement here.\n      To begin with, the record demonstrates that the Grier\nplacement was primarily educational and not “a response to\nmedical, social or emotional problems that are segregable from the\nlearning process.” True, K.E.’s educational difficulties can be\ntraced to her social issues—as well as her anxiety and depression,\nwhich are, of course, “emotional problems,” though not of the\n“explosive” and debilitating variety present in McKenzie, see 771\nF.2d at 1533—but nothing in the record indicates that Leggett sent\nK.E. to Grier to receive medical care. Instead, K.E. went there to\nreceive the help her IEP team and two psychologists identified as\nnecessary to her education, including small classes, individualized\ntutoring, and life-skills instruction. Indeed, Grier, which the\nHearing Officer found was “not a residential treatment center or a\ntherapeutic boarding school,” Hearing Officer Determination at\n20, and which the district court agreed was “not primarily a school\nfor kids with learning or emotional issues,” K.E. v. District of\nColumbia, 19 F. Supp. 3d at 152, offered those precise benefits.\nSee, e.g., Due Process Hearing, Testimony of Learning Skills\nTeacher at 176–182; see also Munir v.

DCPS neither offered an IEP by the start of the\nyear nor identified—before the hearing officer, in the district court,\nor here—an alternative placement of any kind. In fact, it failed\neven to challenge Leggett’s assertion—repeated at every stage of\nthe proceedings—that she considered more than a dozen schools,\nthat only two were appropriate, and that one of those denied K.E.\nadmission. Instead, DCPS has repeatedly insisted, against all logic,\nthat the Wilson IEP itself offered the required “educational\nbenefits,” despite the fact that it did not exist in any form when the\nWilson school year began—or even until a month into the school\nyear, when K.E. was already firmly ensconced at Grier. To be\nsure, had DCPS offered K.E. a spot at a less expensive day school\nin the District—or just identified one early enough in the\nprocess—the Grier placement may not have been “necessary.”\nIndeed, as explained above, to fulfill its obligations under the Act,\nDCPS had no obligation to offer K.E. a program as good as\nGrier’s. See Rowley, 458 U.S. at 197 n.21 (education need not be\n“potential[]maximizing”). Under Rowley, the Act required it to\noffer a program “reasonably calculated to enable [K.E.] to receive\neducational benefits.” See id. at 207. But because school officials\noffered her no such program, either in the public schools or a non-\nresidential private school, the Grier placement was quite plainly\n“necessary” for K.E. to obtain the educational services she was\nentitled to under IDEA.\n    In this sense, Leggett’s case resembles McKenzie v. Smith in a\nway that helps her. Although we noted the distinction between\neducational and medical placements in McKenzie, we ultimately\nconcluded that DCPS would have to pay for the student’s boarding\nschool because there, as here, “DCPS . . . failed at every stage in\n\f                                 20\nthe proceedings to comply with . . . its obligations under [IDEA].”\n771 F.2d at 1535. And there, as here, the placement was “the only\nprogram supported by any evidence in the record” that could\nplausibly offer educational benefit to the child. Id. Under these\ncircumstances, we concluded, DCPS had no basis for faulting his\nparents for sending him to the private residential school they\nultimately chose.\n     So too here. Because Grier was “necessary” to K.E.’s\neducation and because it was “reasonably calculated to provide\neducational benefit,” it was “proper under the Act.” Under the\nstatute and regulations, therefore, DCPS must reimburse Leggett\nfor her costs. Although this conclusion applies most comfortably to\nGrier’s tuition, it extends to room and board as well. The\nregulation expressly requires that “the placement, including . . .\nroom and board, shall be provided at no cost to the [child] or his or\nher parents or guardian” if it is “necessary” to the child’s\neducation. 34 C.F.R. § 104.33(c)(3). Because K.E. could not\npossibly have attended Grier, some three hours from the District,\nwithout living there, the school’s residential program was clearly\n“necessary” and thus reimbursable.\n     Before moving on, we must address one final issue. Although\nnot saying so expressly, DCPS appears to argue that even if the\nGrier School program as a whole was proper under the Act, certain\ncomponents were not. When parts of a placement are not primarily\noriented toward education—that is, when those parts are not the\nkind of “special education and related services” the Act\nguarantees—“the school district is not obligated to bear the total\ncost of the placement.” King v. Pine Plains Central School\nDistrict, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1448128\"><a href=\"/opinion/1448128/king-v-pine-plains-cent-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">772</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 778 (S.D.N.Y. 1996). Instead, it must\ncover the cost of the educational portion of the program “but need\nnot fund . . . non-educational expenses.” Id. Although we have\nconcluded that Grier’s educational and residential programs were\n“necessary” because DCPS had offered K.E. no alternative, the\nschool system may, on remand, seek to demonstrate that specific\n\f                                 21\ncomponents of the placement, such as extracurricular activities or\nthe horseback riding to which DCPS so vociferously objects, were\nnot “primarily oriented toward” educating K.E., Dale M., 237\nF.3d at 817, and were therefore not “necessary” under the Act.\n                                 C.\n     This, then, brings us to the final question, i.e., the equities.\nRecall that IDEA allows a district court to “reduce[] or den[y]”\nreimbursement—even if the placement meets all of the Act’s other\nrequirements—based “upon a . . . finding of unreasonableness with\nrespect to actions taken by the parents.” 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1412(10)(C)(iii)(III); see also Carter, 510 U.S. at 16. Acting\non that invitation, the district court found—and DCPS continues to\nargue—that Leggett behaved unreasonably in several ways: by\n“remov[ing] K.E. from Wilson three weeks before the start of the\nschool year, at a time when the District had not yet failed in its\nobligations”; by placing K.E. at a school that “is not primarily a\nschool for kids with learning and emotional issues”; by failing to\nchallenge the IEP DCPS officials created for K.E. in September\n2012; and by choosing a school “far from the District of\nColumbia” with “an annual cost of $[58,100].” K.E. v. District of\nColumbia, 19 F. Supp. 3d at 152. In our view, and given the\nrecord before us, none of these actions was unreasonable.\n     To begin with, we think it quite unremarkable that Leggett\npursued a private placement for K.E. over the summer and then\nnotified DCPS of the withdrawal in early August. As explained\nabove, faced with school officials who were not responding to her\nphone calls or emails, who failed to provide the promised summer\ncounseling, and who had yet to show any sign of producing an IEP\nin time for the school year, Leggett did what any parent would do:\nshe began exploring other opportunities for her child. Even so, her\nlawyer’s letter notifying officials of the Grier placement made\nclear that she “remain[ed] open” to keeping K.E. at Wilson and\nwould “seriously consider” it if DCPS provided her with an IEP.\nSee Massarsky Letter. But having failed to do so by the beginning\n\f                                  22\nof school, DCPS left Leggett with no choice but to send her\ndaughter to Grier, lest she risk the child spending another year at\nWilson without an IEP. Nothing about the timing of Leggett’s\nactions was unreasonable.\n      Defending the court’s second reason, although DCPS argued\nearlier that the Grier placement was improper because it was\nprimarily oriented toward K.E.’s “medical, social or emotional”\nneeds, see supra 19, it now faults Leggett for sending K.E. to a\nschool that was not restrictive enough. See Appellee’s Br. 40\n(“Grier . . . offered little if any specialized instruction for children\nwith learning or emotional disabilities.”). IDEA, however, requires\nthat a child be educated in the least restrictive environment\npossible—that is, the one that provides “some educational benefit”\nand “most closely approximates” the education a disabled child\nwould receive if she had no disability, Kerkam v. Superintendent,\nDistrict of Columbia Public Schools, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"559861\"><a href=\"/opinion/559861/alexander-kerkam-a-minorby-his-father-james-kerkam-v-superintendent/\"><span class=\"volume\">931</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 86 (D.C. Cir.\n1991); see also 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A). (“to the maximum\nextent appropriate, children with disabilities . . . are educated with\nchildren who are not disabled”). Given this, we cannot see how the\nfact that Grier was designed to help K.E. thrive educationally in a\nnormal classroom environment could possibly be a strike against\nit.\n     Nor can Leggett’s failure to challenge the IEP DCPS finally\ndid develop—some four weeks after the school year began—have\nany bearing on the reasonableness of her actions with respect to the\nplacement at Grier. After all, IDEA requires the school system to\nhave an IEP in place by the start of the school year, so it cannot be\nthat Leggett had to challenge an IEP that was completed in late\nSeptember and that she did not see until sometime in October\nbefore she could obtain reimbursement for a placement she chose\nin August.\n    Although not saying so directly, DCPS seems to imply that\nLeggett’s failure to object to the IEP was significant because K.E.\ncould have returned to Wilson for the second semester of the 2012\n\f                                  23\nschool year, after school officials had completed the allegedly\nacceptable IEP. Before even considering that possibility, however,\nwe would need to know a lot more: Was the IEP in fact adequate?\nWould returning to Wilson have unduly disrupted K.E.’s\neducation? Were K.E.’s tuition, room and board, and other fees\nrefundable mid-year? Neither DCPS nor the record tells us\nanything about these critical questions. We thus leave it to the\ndistrict court to give DCPS an opportunity—should it want one—\nto show that Leggett’s failure to return K.E. to Wilson for the\nsecond half of the 2012–13 school year was unreasonable.\n      Finally, DCPS insists that it was per se unreasonable for\nLeggett to choose a school that was a three-hour drive from the\nDistrict of Columbia and cost $58,100 per year. True, “total\nreimbursement will not be appropriate if the court determines that\nthe cost of the private education was unreasonable.” Carter, 510\nU.S. at 16. And $58,000 is a lot of money. But if a student\nrequires special education, if school officials fail to offer it, and if\nthe only private school that could serve the student’s needs—that\nis, the only school “reasonably calculated to offer educational\nbenefit”—is not within commuting distance and costs $58,000 (or\neven more) then it cannot be unreasonable for the child’s parent to\nsend her there. Here, because DCPS offered no IEP at Wilson,\nidentified no suitable alternative, and failed even to challenge\nLeggett’s claim that Grier was the only available placement, Grier\nwas “the only program supported by any evidence in the record,”\nMcKenzie, 771 F.2d at 1535. It was thus not “unreasonable” for\nLeggett to send K.E. there.\n                                     D.\n     To sum up, given that DCPS failed to provide K.E. a FAPE at\nWilson or anywhere else, that the Grier placement was\n“reasonably calculated to offer educational benefit,” that the\nresidential program was “necessary” to achieve that objective, and\nthat DCPS has, on this record, failed to show that Leggett acted\n“unreasonabl[y],” Leggett is entitled under the Act and the\n\f                                 24\nregulation to reimbursement for tuition, room and board, and any\nother costs necessary to attend Grier. That said, on remand the\ndistrict court may reduce this amount if, as explained above, the\nIEP DCPS finally generated was adequate and the school district\ncan demonstrate that Leggett’s refusal to return K.E. to Wilson at\nthe end of the first semester was “unreasonable[].” 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1412(10)(C)(iii)(III). (Leggett’s eligibility for reimbursement\nfor the 2013–14 school year is the subject of a different case.) The\ndistrict court may also deny reimbursement for any cost, e.g.,\nextracurricular activities, horseback riding, or excessive travel,\nthat it finds was either not “primarily oriented toward enabling\n[K.E.] to obtain an education,” Dale M., 237 F.3d at 817—that is,\nnot “necessary” within the meaning of the regulation—or\notherwise “unreasonable,” Carter, 510 U.S. at 16 (“Courts\nfashioning discretionary equitable relief under IDEA must\nconsider all relevant factors, including the appropriate and\nreasonable level of reimbursement that should be required. Total\nreimbursement will not be appropriate if the court determines that\nthe cost of the private education was unreasonable.”).\n                                III.\n     We understand that requiring a school system to reimburse\nparents for the costs of expensive private boarding schools diverts\nfunds away from public education. But where, as here, the school\ndistrict has failed to provide a free appropriate public education in\neither a public or a non-residential private school, where the\nresidential school the parent selected is “reasonably calculated to\nprovide educational benefits,” where the residential component of\nthat school is “necessary” for the child to attend that school, and\nwhere the school system has not shown that the parent acted\nunreasonably, IDEA requires reimbursement for tuition, room and\nboard, and other related educational expenses—even if costly.\nMoreover, and contrary to the district court’s fear that if Leggett\nprevails parents will have “carte blanche” to choose an expensive\nprivate school, K.E. v. District of Columbia, 19 F. Supp. 3d at\n\f                                25\n151, the Supreme Court emphasized in Carter that under IDEA,\nschool officials have complete control over the situation, i.e., to\navoid burdensome reimbursement obligations, they need only offer\neach child a free appropriate public education, either in a public\nschool or in a private school the district chooses. Carter, 510 U.S.\nat 15–16. This, according to the Court, “is IDEA’s mandate, and\nschool officials who conform to it need not worry about\nreimbursement claims.” Id. at 15. Like any other public school\nsystem, then, DCPS can avoid cases like this one simply by\nensuring that its employees understand and fulfill the school\nsystem’s obligations under IDEA—to provide a FAPE and to do\nso in a timely manner—and that they answer the phone when it\nrings.\n    For the foregoing reasons, we reverse and remand for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                                       So ordered.\n\f</pre>",
