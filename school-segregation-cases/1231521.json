Sanderson for Appellant\n\n        Eric C. Stewart for Appellee\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\nSHAW, J.\n\n      {¶1} Defendant-appellant John Timothy Shook (“Shook”) appeals the\n\nDecember 11, 2013 judgment of the Logan County Common Pleas Court\n\nsentencing Shook to an aggregate prison term of 7.5 years after Shook was\n\nconvicted in a jury trial of six counts of Sexual Battery in violation of R.C.\n\n2907.03(A)(7), all felonies of the third degree, five counts of Gross Sexual\n\nimposition in violation of R.C. 2907.05(A)(1), all felonies of the fourth degree,\n\nand one count of Attempted Sexual Battery in violation of R.C. 2923.02 and R.C.\n\n2907.05(A)(7), a felony of the fourth degree.\n\n      {¶2} The facts relevant to this appeal are as follows. On March 12, 2013,\n\nShook was indicted for various sexual crimes alleging that Shook, who was the\n\nband and choir teacher at Riverside school in Logan County, engaged in sexual\n\ncontact with three of his high school students. (Doc. 2). During the proceedings\n\nthe indictment was amended twice. (Doc. 18); (Doc. 52). Shook was ultimately\n\ncharged with thirteen total counts allegedly perpetrated against three separate\n\nvictims: six counts of Sexual Battery against victim E.P. in violation of R.C.\n\n2907.03(A)(7), all felonies of the third degree, three counts of Gross Sexual\n\nImposition of victim L.K. in violation of R.C. 2907.05(A)(1), all felonies of the\n\nfourth degree, Attempted Sexual Battery against victim L.K. in violation of R.C.\n\n2923.02 and R.C. 2907.03(A)(7), a felony of the fourth degree, two counts of\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\nGross Sexual Imposition against victim K.W. in violation of R.C. 2907.05(A)(1),\n\nboth felonies of the fourth degree, and one count of Attempted Sexual Battery\n\nagainst victim K.W. in violation of R.C. 2923.02 and R.C. 2907.03(A)(7), a felony\n\nof the fourth degree. (Doc. 52). Shook pled not guilty to the charges against him.\n\n      {¶3} On July 18, 2013, Shook filed a motion in limine to exclude “prior\n\nbad acts” evidence. (Doc. 36). In the memorandum in support, Shook argued that\n\nhe anticipated the State would offer the testimony of students he previously taught\n\nat another school and that those students would testify that Shook engaged in\n\nsexual acts with them. (Id.) Shook argued that such evidence would be unfairly\n\nprejudicial and was impermissible under Evid.R. 404(B).\n\n      {¶4} On July 29, 2013, the State filed a response to Shook’s motion in\n\nlimine, contending that under the Ohio Supreme Court’s decision in State v.\n\nWilliams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521 (2012), 404(B) evidence could be introduced in\n\nsexual abuse cases where it is relevant and probative if used to prove the\n\ndefendant’s plan, motive, intent, or preparation.     The State argued that the\n\ntestimony of the students from Shook’s previous school would be offered for just\n\nsuch a purpose. (Doc. 39).\n\n      {¶5} On September 19, 2013, the trial court filed a journal entry denying\n\nShook’s motion in limine, citing Williams, and this Court’s decision in State v.\n\nBump, 3d Dist. Logan No. 8-12-04, 2013-Ohio-1006. (Doc. 50). The trial court\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\nindicated that it would specifically instruct the jury that it could not consider the\n\ntestimony of Shook’s prior students to show that Shook acted in conformity with\n\nthese prior acts. (Id.)\n\n       {¶6} On October 14, 2013, Shook filed a “Motion to Sever the Indictment.”\n\n(Doc. 90). Shook contended that although the charges were all similar in character\n\nas sex offenses, the charges related to victims L.K. and K.W. required the state to\n\nprove that Shook acted “with the purpose of sexual gratification,” making the\n\ncharges substantially different from the Sexual Battery charges related to victim\n\nE.P. (Id.) On October 22, 2013, the State filed a response, contending that the law\n\nfavored joinder, and that the evidence related to each victim was simple and direct.\n\n(Doc. 123).\n\n       {¶7} On October 24, 2013, the trial court filed a journal entry denying\n\nShook’s motion to sever the indictment. (Doc. 133). The trial court reasoned that\n\nfirst, the testimony of the victims would be admissible in the other victims’ trials,\n\nand second that the evidence was simple and direct such that the jurors should not\n\nbe confused. (Id.)\n\n       {¶8} The case subsequently proceeded to a jury trial, which was held from\n\nOctober 29 to November 1, 2013. At trial the State called 14 witnesses including\n\nthe three victims. The first victim, E.P., testified that she was a student in Shook’s\n\nband and choir classes, that she was a member of Shook’s marching band, that she\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\nwas a “band aide” for Shook her freshman year of high school, that she\n\noccasionally babysat Shook’s children, and that she kept the book for Shook’s\n\njunior high basketball team. (Tr. at 186-194). E.P. testified that Shook first\n\nshowed an interest in her in his office, where he called her over and told her to sit\n\non his lap and read an email. (Tr. at 195-197). E.P. testified while she was on\n\nShook’s lap, Shook began touching her legs and vagina. (Tr. at 197-198). E.P.\n\ntestified that she was 16 at the time, and that Shook told her she could not tell\n\nanyone about the incident. (Tr. at 201).\n\n        {¶9} E.P. then testified to a series of incidents where she engaged in sexual\n\nacts with Shook, including losing her virginity to Shook, other incidents of vaginal\n\nsex, oral sex to both parties, and anal sex that occurred from December of 2011\n\nthrough January of 2013.1 E.P. testified to incidents that occurred in various\n\nlocations around Riverside school, and at Shook’s home.                            E.P. was able to\n\nspecifically identify dates and locations through dated entries in her journals,\n\nwhich were introduced into evidence at the trial.\n\n        {¶10} The second victim to testify at trial, L.K., testified that she had\n\nwanted to learn clarinet to join marching band so Shook began giving her lessons\n\nin his office at the school in the summer of 2012. (Tr. at 350). L.K. testified that\n\nafter her second lesson with Shook he called her over to the computer, put his arm\n\n\n1\n As Shook does not contest the sufficiency or weight of the evidence for any of his convictions, we find it\nunnecessary to recite the details of each separate instance of sexual activity.\n\n                                                   -5-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\naround her and then “touched [her] butt.” (Tr. at 353). L.K. testified that she was\n\ntold not to tell anyone, and that she did not tell her parents or other adults because\n\neveryone “loved” Shook. (Tr. at 355). L.K. testified that during the next lesson\n\nShook touched her butt and her breasts. (Tr. at 354). She testified that she tried to\n\npull away but she could not because Shook was “stronger.” (Id.) L. K. testified\n\nthat the same thing happened again at the next lesson, with Shook touching her\n\nbutt and her breasts. (Tr. at 355). L.K. testified the lesson after that she was\n\nwearing spandex because she had volleyball practice. L.K. testified that Shook\n\nput his hand down her spandex and touched her “bare vagina.” (Tr. at 357). L.K.\n\ntestified that shortly after that final incident she stopped going to private lessons\n\nwith Shook and quit marching band. (Tr. at 358).\n\n       {¶11} The third victim to testify at trial, K.W., testified that she was also a\n\nmember of the band and in Shook’s choir class. K.W. testified that Shook gave\n\nher a ride home from the school on multiple occasions. K.W. testified that on one\n\nof the rides home, Shook touched her leg and she was uncomfortable and scooted\n\naway. (Tr. at 388). K.W. testified that on another ride Shook touched her leg\n\nagain but up higher. (Tr. at 389). K.W. also testified to an incident that happened\n\nin Shook’s office where Shook spanked her with his bare hand, grabbed her\n\n“boob” and “squeezed her nipple.” (Tr. at 394). K.W. testified that Shook told\n\nher not to tell anyone because he would get fired if she did. (Tr. at 395).\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\n        {¶12} After the State rested its case, Shook called ten witnesses and also\n\ntook the stand himself to deny that he ever had sex with E.P. and to deny that he\n\ntouched L.K. or K.W. inappropriately.\n\n        {¶13} Following closing arguments and jury instructions,2 the case was\n\nsubmitted to the jury. The jury returned guilty verdicts on twelve of the thirteen\n\nindicted counts, acquitting Shook of the Attempted Sexual Battery of K.W. He\n\nwas otherwise found guilty of six counts of Sexual Battery against E.P. in\n\nviolation of R.C. 2907.03(A)(7), all felonies of the third degree, three counts of\n\nGross Sexual Imposition of victim L.K. in violation of R.C. 2907.05(A)(1), all\n\nfelonies of the fourth degree, Attempted Sexual Battery against L.K. in violation\n\nof R.C. 2923.02 and R.C. 2907.03(A)(7), a felony of the fourth degree, and two\n\ncounts of Gross Sexual Imposition against K.W. in violation of R.C.\n\n2907.05(A)(1), both felonies of the fourth degree.\n\n        {¶14} On December 9, 2013 a sentencing hearing was held. At the hearing\n\nShook had several people speak on his behalf pleading for leniency, and he made a\n\nstatement himself.          The prosecutor then made a statement and argued for\n\nmaximum consecutive sentences for a 39 year prison term. Members of the\n\nvictims’ families also made statements. After hearing the arguments of the parties\n\n\n\n\n2\n At the request of the defense, the jury was also instructed as to the lesser included offenses of Sexual\nImposition on the Gross Sexual Imposition charges.\n\n                                                  -7-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\nthe court sentenced Shook to serve an aggregate prison term of 7.5 years.3 A\n\njudgment entry memorializing this sentence was filed December 11, 2013. (Doc.\n\n163).\n\n        {¶15} It is from this judgment that Shook appeals, asserting the following\n\nassignments of error for our review.\n\n                    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR 1\n        THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED HARMFUL ERROR IN\n        DENYING THE REQUEST OF THE DEFENDANT-\n        APPELLANT TO SEVER THE COUNTS OF THE\n        INDICTMENT BELOW.\n\n                     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR 2\n        THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED HARMFUL ERROR IN\n        ADMITTING CERTAIN EVIDENCE OF “PRIOR BAD\n        ACTS” IN THE TRIAL OF THE INSTANT CASE.\n\n                     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR 3\n        THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED HARMFUL ERROR IN\n        PRECLUDING THE DEFENDANT-APPELLANT FROM\n        INTRODUCING EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE IN THE\n        TRIAL OF THE INSTANT CASE.\n\n                                    First Assignment of Error\n\n        {¶16} In Shook’s first assignment of error, he argues that the trial court\n\nerred by overruling his motion to sever the indictment.                         Specifically, Shook\n\ncontends that the crimes against the various victims vary temporally, and that the\n\n\n3\n  Shook was ordered to serve 5 years in prison on each of the Sexual Battery convictions against E.P.,\nwhich would run concurrent to each other. Shook was ordered to serve 15 months in prison on each of the\nfour convictions related to L.K., which would run concurrent to each other but consecutive to the five year\nSexual Battery term. Shook was ordered to serve 15 months in prison for the Gross Sexual Imposition\nconvictions against K.W., which would run concurrent to each other but consecutive to the other prison\nsentences, creating the aggregate prison term of 7.5 years.\n\n                                                   -8-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\ncrimes against victims L.K. and K.W. were dissimilar to those against victim E.P.\n\nbecause the State had to prove the extra element of “with purpose of sexual\n\ngratification” for L.K. and K.W.4\n\n         {¶17} The joinder of offenses is governed by Crim.R. 8(A) which provides:\n\n         Two or more offenses may be charged in the same indictment * *\n         * if the offenses charged * * * are of the same or similar\n         character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or are\n         based on two or more acts or transactions connected together or\n         constituting parts of a common scheme or plan, or are part of a\n         course of criminal conduct.\n\n         {¶18} “ ‘It is well-established that the law favors joinder because the\n\navoidance of multiple trials conserves time and expense and minimizes the\n\npotentially incongruous outcomes that can result from successive trials before\n\ndifferent juries.’ ” State v. Howard, 2d Dist. Greene No.2012–CA–39, 2013–\n\nOhio–2343, ¶ 35, quoting State v. Glass, 2d Dist. Greene No.2000–CA–74, 2001\n\nWL 228453, *2 (Mar. 9, 2001), citing State v. Schiebel, 55 Ohio St.3d 71, 86–87\n\n(1990).\n\n         {¶19} A defendant can move to sever joined offenses pursuant to\n\nCrim.R.14, which states that, “If it appears that a defendant * * * is prejudiced by\n\na joinder of offenses * * * the court shall order an election or separate trial of\n\n\n4\n  Shook states in his argument that “with purpose of sexual gratification” is an element of Gross Sexual\nImposition. It is actually part of the definition of sexual contact, which is an element of Gross Sexual\nImposition. Pursuant to R.C. 2907.01(B), “ ‘Sexual contact’ means any touching of an erogenous zone of\nanother, including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if the person is a female,\na breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or gratifying either person.” (Emphasis added.)\n\n                                                      -9-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\ncounts, grant a severance of defendants or provide such other relief as justice\n\nrequires.”\n\n       {¶20} “The defendant claiming error in the trial court's refusal to sever\n\nmultiple charges has the burden of affirmatively showing that his rights were\n\nprejudiced.” (Citations omitted.)    State v. Skatzes, 2d Dist. Montgomery No.\n\n15848, 2003–Ohio–516, ¶ 147. “To affirmatively show that his rights have been\n\nprejudiced, the defendant ‘must furnish the trial court with sufficient information\n\nso that it can weigh the considerations favoring joinder against the defendant's\n\nright to a fair trial, and [the defendant] must demonstrate that the court abused its\n\ndiscretion in refusing to separate the charges for trial.’ ” Glass, supra, at *3–4,\n\nquoting State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 163 (1990). (Other citation omitted.)\n\n       {¶21} “When a defendant claims that he was prejudiced by the joinder of\n\nmultiple offenses, a court must determine (1) whether evidence of the other crimes\n\nwould be admissible even if the counts were severed, and (2) if not, whether the\n\nevidence of each crime is simple and distinct.” State v. Schaim, 65 Ohio St.3d 51,\n\n59 (1992); State v. Thomas, 3d Dist. Allen No. 1–11–25, 2012–Ohio–5577, ¶ 21.\n\nIf the evidence of other crimes would be admissible at separate trials, any “\n\n‘prejudice that might result from the jury's hearing the evidence of the other crime\n\nin a joint trial would be no different from that possible in separate trials,’ and a\n\ncourt need not inquire further.” Schaim, quoting Drew v. United States, 331 F.2d\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\n85, 90 (1964). Moreover, “a defendant is not prejudiced by joinder where the\n\njoined offenses are ‘simple and direct, so that a jury is capable of segregating the\n\nproof required for each offense.’ ” State v. Wilson, 2d Dist. Montgomery No.\n\n20910, 2005–Ohio–6666, ¶ 38, quoting State v. Fletcher, 2d Dist. Clark No.2003–\n\nCA–62, 2004–Ohio–4517, ¶ 41.\n\n       {¶22} We review a trial court’s decision on joinder of offenses for trial\n\nunder an abuse of discretion standard. State v. Stober, 3d Dist. Putnam No. 12-13-\n\n09, 2014-Ohio-1568, ¶ 99. “The term ‘abuse of discretion’ connotes more than a\n\nmere error in law or judgment; it implies that the court's attitude was unreasonable,\n\narbitrary or unconscionable.” State v. Adams, 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157 (1980).\n\n       {¶23} In this case, prior to the trial, Shook filed a motion to sever the\n\nindictment, which was denied by the trial court. The trial court reasoned that the\n\ntestimony of the victims would be admissible in each other’s trials and that the\n\ntestimony was simple and direct such that it should not confuse the jury. The trial\n\ncourt thus found that both of the factors that the Ohio Supreme Court stated in\n\nSchaim were present in this case, supporting joinder, even though the trial court\n\nonly needed to find one factor or the other. Shook renewed his motion to sever the\n\nindictment at the beginning of the trial and it was again denied by the trial court,\n\nfor the same reasons it had stated previously.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\n      {¶24} Despite Shook’s arguments that the charges were dissimilar and\n\nvaried temporally, the evidence presented at trial suggests that many of the\n\ncharges were similar and that they occurred during the same time frame. Shook\n\nwas charged with Sexual Battery of E.P. and Attempted Sexual Battery of both\n\nL.K. and K.W., indicating a direct similarity between charged offenses against all\n\nthree victims. The remaining charges were all Gross Sexual Impositions, which\n\nwere also sexually-related crimes.\n\n      {¶25} Shook’s claim that the crimes varied temporally is not necessarily\n\nsupported by the record either. The testimony at trial indicated that all of the\n\nsexual crimes took place between December of 2011 and January of 2013. The\n\nSexual Batteries against E.P. allegedly took place over that entire span, while the\n\ncrimes against L.K. and K.W. both allegedly took place in the summer of 2012,\n\nspecifically July and August. Thus all of the crimes were of a similar nature and\n\nwere within the same time frame.\n\n      {¶26} The crimes were also similar in that they were all perpetrated against\n\nsimilarly aged victims who were all students in Shook’s classes. In addition, all\n\nthree victims testified to incidents that took place at the school, specifically in\n\nShook’s band room or his office. Thus Shook’s arguments that the crimes were\n\ndissimilar have no merit.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\n        {¶27} We addressed a similar argument to Shook’s in State v. Stober, 3d\n\nDist. Putnam No. 12-13-09, 2014-Ohio-1568, and found that the testimony of\n\nmultiple victims of a teacher who was having sexual contact with students could\n\nhave been admissible in each other’s trials under Evid.R. 404(B) “to show motive,\n\nintent, plan, or scheme.” Stober at ¶ 102. On this basis, we found that the trial\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant’s motion to sever. A\n\nsimilar holding is appropriate here where under 404(B) the State could have\n\nintroduced the testimony in each separate trial to show a plan or scheme.5\n\n        {¶28} Nevertheless, while the trial court needed only to find that either the\n\ntestimony would be admissible in separate trials or that the testimony was simple\n\nand direct, the trial court found both in this case. The result of the trial seems to\n\nsuggest that the testimony was simple and direct as the jury acquitted Shook on\n\none of the counts against victim K.W., indicating that the jury was able to clearly\n\nfollow and understand the testimony. There is no indication in the record that the\n\ntestimony was anything but simple and direct and Shook has not pointed us to\n\nanything to establish otherwise.\n\n        {¶29} Accordingly as it is Shook’s burden on appeal to establish\n\naffirmatively that the trial court erred in denying his motion to sever the\n\n\n5\n  In addition, we would note that Shook’s argument that there was an additional element to be proven in the\ncase of L.K. and K.W. similarly fails, as while “for the purpose of sexual gratification” is not explicitly\nstated in the Sexual Battery statute, having intercourse with a student carries an obvious implication of\nsexual gratification.\n\n                                                  -13-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\nindictment, that he was prejudiced by the denial of his motion and he has not done\n\nso, we cannot find the trial court abused its discretion.       Therefore his first\n\nassignment of error is overruled.\n\n                            Second Assignment of Error\n\n       {¶30} In his second assignment of error, Shook argues that the trial court\n\nerred in permitting the State to present the testimony of three witnesses from\n\nCovington, a school Shook taught at previously. Specifically Shook contends that\n\nthe testimony of these witnesses constituted prior “bad acts” testimony and was\n\nimpermissible under 404(B), that the students’ testimony was irrelevant, and that it\n\nwas far more prejudicial than probative.\n\n       {¶31} Evid.R. 404(B) reads as follows.\n\n       Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to\n       prove the character of a person in order to show action in\n       conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other\n       purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent,\n       preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or\n       accident. * * *\n\n       {¶32} “Generally, the prosecution in a criminal case may not present\n\nevidence that the defendant has committed other crimes or acts independent of the\n\ncrime for which the defendant is being tried to establish that the defendant acted in\n\nconformity with his bad character.” State v.

Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d\n\n521, 526, 2012–Ohio–5695, that the admission of other acts evidence is a three-\n\nstep process. Williams, at ¶ 22; State v. Guerra, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 12CA010188,\n\n2013–Ohio–5367, ¶ 17.\n\n       The first step is to consider whether the other acts evidence is\n       relevant to making any fact that is of consequence to the\n       determination of the action more or less probable than it would\n       be without the evidence. Evid.R. 401. The next step is to\n       consider whether evidence of the other crimes, wrongs, or acts is\n       presented to prove the character of the accused in order to show\n       activity in conformity therewith or whether the other acts\n       evidence is presented for a legitimate purpose, such as those\n       stated in Evid.R. 404(B). The third step is to consider whether\n       the probative value of the other acts evidence is substantially\n       outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\n\nWilliams at ¶ 20.\n\n       {¶34} “Evidentiary rulings at trial are reviewed on appeal for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.” State v. Altman, 7th Dist. Columbiana No. 12 CO 42, 2013–Ohio-\n\n5883, ¶ 22, citing State v. Beshara, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 07 MA 37, 2009–\n\nOhio–6529, ¶ 55, citing State v. Bey, 85 Ohio St.3d 487, 490 (1999).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\n         {¶35} In this case Shook specifically objects to the testimony of J.H., T.C.,\n\nand C.B. who were all students at Covington while Shook taught there from 2001\n\nto 2005. At trial J.H. testified that when he heard of Shook’s indictment he called\n\nthe authorities to report an incident he witnessed in the band room at Covington\n\nwhere Shook was kissing one of J.H.’s fellow students, T.C. (Tr. at 435). T.C.\n\ntestified that the kiss did take place, that it was mostly mutual, and that she later\n\nhad sex with Shook at his house one time. (Tr. at 449).\n\n         {¶36} C.B. testified that when she was 17 and a student of Shook’s at\n\nCovington she also had sex with Shook once during school. (Tr. at 460). C.B.\n\nand T.C. both testified that Shook flirted with his students. (Tr. at 448, 461). All\n\nthree of these students were members of Shook’s band at Covington.\n\n         {¶37} On appeal Shook argues that the Covington witnesses’ testimony\n\nwas not material, and that even if it was, the probative value was substantially\n\noutweighed by unfair prejudice.6 The State contends that the testimony of these\n\nCovington witnesses was permissible to show “motive, opportunity, intent,\n\npreparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident” and thus\n\nwas admissible at the trial. The State argues that the testimony was specifically\n\noffered to show that Shook had a pattern of preying on teenage female students\n\n\n6\n  Shook also argues that the Rape Shield statute should protect him from testimony regarding specific\nsexual acts, citing to R.C. 2907.02(D). We would note that Shook was not on trial for rape, and there is no\nsimilar “Rape Shield” provision in the Sexual Battery statute. There is one, however, in the GSI statute.\nNevertheless, there is a specific exception in that provision for the type of 404(B) evidence discussed here.\n\n                                                   -16-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\nfrom the age of 15-17 in his band and choir classes, and that he would then engage\n\nin sexual activity with them either on school grounds or at his home. The State\n\nalso contends that the Covington witnesses’ testimony was particularly relevant to\n\nthe claims of victim L.K. and K.W. where the State had to prove that when Shook\n\nhad contact with them, Shook had a sexual interest in those victims.\n\n       {¶38} The record supports the State’s arguments as Shook’s victims were\n\nall 15-17 year old females who were in his band class and the sexual activity took\n\nplace either in the school or at Shook’s home. Both of the female Covington\n\nwitnesses testified to incidents that happened in the school, which is similar in\n\nnature to all three of the victims in this case, indicating a plan or pattern.\n\n       {¶39} Moreover, the Covington witnesses’ testimony tends to show a\n\nsexual motive in Shook touching L.K. and K.W., which is relevant to the elements\n\nof the Gross Sexual Imposition charges. Shook either denied that he touched these\n\nvictims inappropriately, or claimed that any contact was not of a sexual nature.\n\nThe testimony of the Covington witnesses tends to dispute his denials and\n\nindicates that Shook had a sexual interest in girls of that age in his classes.\n\n       {¶40} While there is some inherent prejudice in allowing the testimony of\n\nthe Covington witnesses, we cannot find under the facts and circumstances of this\n\ncase that the trial court abused its discretion in finding that the Covington\n\nwitnesses’ testimony was admissible at trial.\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\n       {¶41} Nevertheless, even if the testimony of the Covington witnesses was\n\nimproperly admitted, any resulting prejudice was severely diminished by the trial\n\ncourt’s multiple limiting instructions, and by being, at least in some part,\n\ncumulative to other testimony already in the record.\n\n       {¶42} Prior to any of the Covington witnesses taking the stand, the court\n\ngave the following limiting instruction to the jury.\n\n       Ladies and gentlemen, the State, as they have told you in\n       opening statement, is going to have witnesses from the prior\n       school district that the defendant was employed at. This is what\n       we call other acts evidence, and there are rules under which this\n       is admissible. We do not in this court or any other court in the\n       State convict somebody of bad character, so his – his character\n       isn’t at issue here, and this testimony isn’t being admitted to\n       show the defendant’s character or that he acted in conformity\n       with that character; it’s being admitted to prove other elements\n       of the offense such as purpose, motive, plan, or scheme.\n\n(Tr. at 413).\n\n       {¶43} At the conclusion of the trial, Shook’s counsel further highlighted the\n\ncourt’s preliminary instruction to the jury during his closing arguments, by\n\nemphasizing that the jury could not consider the Covington witnesses’ testimony\n\nas 404(B) evidence.\n\n       I would like to talk for a moment before I start to talk about the\n       actual alleged victims in this case, about the evidence that you\n       heard from the witnesses who testified from Covington.\n\n       As [the prosecutor] indicated, they were not victims in this case.\n       There are no charges filed in that case, and the judge will give\n       you a limited instruction telling you you can only consider their\n\n                                        -18-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\n        testimony for the purpose of determining motive, opportunity,\n        intent, or purpose, preparation or plan to commit the offense.\n        What you cannot consider it for is that Mr. Shook acted in\n        conformity therewith.\n\n        He told you when he talked to you about this before; that the\n        reason for that is that we do not consider that because somebody\n        did something bad in the past [does not mean] they did\n        something bad at this point. You’re not permitted to consider it\n        for that purpose, and there’s a very good reason.\n\n        Think about the witnesses from Covington. Charges happened\n        eight years ago. What opportunity, what real opportunity does\n        Mr. Shook have to provide you a defense to those charges?\n        Counts that he’s not even charged with? Eight years ago,\n        witnesses are gone, memories are faded. There might be alibi\n        witnesses, there might have been someone else who was there.\n\n        These people did not come forward. They did not give him the\n        opportunity to contest those charges, and it’s improper for you\n        to consider that he did that then and because of that he’s done\n        what he did to these girls. You may not make that connection.\n\n        You may consider it for motive, opportunity, intent, or purpose,\n        and when you look at it that way, is what he allegedly did with\n        the Covington witnesses the same as what he did in this case?\n\n(Tr. at 729-730). Defense counsel then continued to argue that that the incidents at\n\nCovington were different than the incidents in this case.7\n\n        {¶44} After closing arguments concluded, the trial court gave its formal\n\ninstructions to the jury, and specifically instructed the jury again on this issue of\n\nthe Covington witnesses, using the following language.\n\n\n7\n In defense counsel’s lengthy closing argument, she routinely attacks the idea that a consistent “plan,”\n“motive,” or “scheme” etc. was shown through the use of the Covington witnesses. (Tr. at 730-31, 762,\n779).\n\n                                                 -19-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\n       Evidence was received about the commission of crimes or wrong\n       acts other than the offense with which the defendant is charged\n       in this trial. That evidence was received only for a limited\n       purpose. It was not received and you may not consider it to\n       prove the character of the defendant in order to show that he\n       acted in conformity with that character. If you find that the\n       evidence of other crimes or wrongs – or wrong act true and the\n       defendant committed it or them, you may consider that evidence\n       only for the purpose of deciding whether it proves the\n       defendant’s motive, opportunity, intent or purpose, preparation,\n       or plan to commit the offense charged in this trial. That\n       evidence cannot be considered for any other purpose.\n\n(Tr. at 803-804).\n\n       {¶45} The trial court thus gave a limiting instruction before the evidence\n\nwas even heard, and an instruction to the jury before they deliberated. As we\n\npresume that the jury followed the court’s instructions, we find any potential\n\nprejudice severely limited in this case.\n\n       {¶46} That any potential prejudice is severely limited is also particularly\n\ntrue in light of the fact that the jury was already aware of the existence of at least\n\none Covington witness through the testimony of victim E.P.             During direct\n\nexamination of E.P., the following exchange occurred.\n\n       Q: Did [Shook] ever talk about why he left his former job?\n\n       A: He had said that he was having sexual relations with a girl\n       from Covington and she had told her friends and then the\n       teachers heard about it and started asking questions so he just\n       left.\n\n       Q: Okay. Do you remember where that conversation occurred?\n\n\n                                           -20-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\n       A: We were in the instrument room.\n\n(Tr. at 214). Therefore the jury was at least in part already aware of accusations of\n\nShook having a sexual relationship with a former student at Covington.\n\n       {¶47} Thus based on the record before us, we cannot find that the trial court\n\nabused its discretion in permitting the Covington witnesses’ testimony. However,\n\neven if the testimony was improperly admitted, we find that any prejudice was\n\nseverely limited.   Any resulting prejudice seems insignificant in light of the\n\nsubstantial evidence presented at trial, particularly with regard to E.P., who even\n\nhad journals detailing some of her encounters with Shook. Accordingly, for all of\n\nthe foregoing reasons, Shook’s second assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                            Third Assignment of Error\n\n       {¶48} In Shook’s third assignment of error, he argues that the trial court\n\nerred by excluding the testimony of one of his witnesses. Specifically, Shook\n\ncontends that the trial court erred in excluding the testimony of J.M., who would\n\nhave testified that victim E.P. told J.M. she was still a virgin after the date on\n\nwhich E.P. claimed at trial to have had sex with Shook.\n\n       {¶49} A trial court has broad discretion whether to admit or exclude\n\nevidence and its decision in such matters will not be disturbed on appeal absent an\n\nabuse of discretion. State v. Graham, 58 Ohio St.2d 350, 352 (1979).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -21-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\n       {¶50} Evid.R. 613(B) governs the admissibility of extrinsic evidence of a\n\nprior inconsistent statement. It states, in relevant part:\n\n       Extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by a witness\n       is admissible if both of the following apply:\n\n       (1) If the statement is offered solely for the purpose of\n       impeaching the witness, the witness is afforded a prior\n       opportunity to explain or deny the statement and the opposite\n       party is afforded an opportunity to interrogate the witness on\n       the statement or the interests of justice otherwise require;\n\n       (2) The subject matter of the statement is one of the following:\n\n       (a) A fact that is of consequence to the determination of the\n       action other than the credibility of a witness * * *.\n\nEvid.R. 613(B).\n\n       {¶51} Extrinsic evidence is not admissible under Evid.R. 613(B) unless a\n\nproper foundation is laid for its admission. A foundation must be established\n\nthrough direct or cross-examination in which: (1) the witness is presented with the\n\nformer statement; (2) the witness is asked whether he or she made the statement;\n\n(3) the witness is given an opportunity to admit, deny, or explain the statement;\n\nand (4) the opposing party is given an opportunity to interrogate the witness\n\nregarding the inconsistent statement.

Theuring, 46 Ohio App.3d 152,\n\n155 (1st Dist.1988).\n\n\n\n\n                                          -22-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\n      {¶52} If a witness denies making the statement, extrinsic evidence of the\n\nstatement is generally admissible; provided, the evidence does not relate to a\n\ncollateral matter.

Riggins, 35 Ohio App.3d 1, 3 (8th Dist.1986). “If, however, the witness\n\nadmits making the prior statement, the trial court does not abuse its discretion by\n\nthereafter refusing to admit extrinsic evidence of that statement.” State v. Kemp,\n\n8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 97913, 2013-Ohio-167, ¶ 36 (additional citations omitted).\n\n      {¶53} In this case, Shook’s attorney attempted to challenge E.P.’s claims\n\nregarding having sex with Shook, and E.P.’s related journal entries about when the\n\nsexual incidents took place. During Shook’s counsel’s cross-examination of E.P.,\n\nthe following testimony was presented.\n\n      Q [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So you went to snowball February\n      4th with Austin, and you talked with [J.M.] about that the\n      following Monday, didn’t you?\n\n      ***\n\n      A [E.P.]: Yes.\n\n      Q: In fact, you told her that you had a plan with Austin to lose\n      your virginity that night but it didn’t happen because the\n      condom broke. Do you remember telling [J.M.] that?\n\n      A: Not my virginity, his virginity.\n\n      Q: That’s not what you told [J.M.]. Your plan was to lose your\n      virginity?\n\n      A: She thought that I was still a virgin.\n\n                                         -23-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\n\n       Q: Excuse me?\n\n       A: She thought that I was still a virgin.\n\n       Q: So you were lying to her when you said that?\n\n       A: Yes, I was.\n\n(Tr. at 256-257).\n\n       {¶54} In order to further attempt to challenge E.P.’s claims and her\n\ncredibility, Shook called J.M. to the stand in his case-in-chief. When Shook’s\n\ncounsel began to ask J.M. about what E.P. had told her regarding the dance and\n\nlosing her virginity to Austin, the State objected and the following conversation\n\nwas held.\n\n       [STATE]: Objection. This is hearsay.\n\n       MS. BURKETT [Defense Counsel]: I can direct it specifically to\n       impeaching [E.P.]’s testimony yesterday[.]\n\n       THE COURT: Let’s have a side bar, counsel.\n\n       ***\n\n       [During sidebar]\n\n       THE COURT: It’s still hearsay.\n\n       MS. BURKETT [Defense Counsel]: [E.P.] testified yesterday\n       that she did not tell [J.M.] that she was going to lose her\n       virginity.\n\n       THE COURT: What she is testifying is hearsay. What is the\n       hearsay exception?\n\n                                       -24-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\n\n       MS. BURKETT: It’s one prior inconsistent statement, Your\n       Honor.\n\n       ***\n\n       THE COURT: I’m not going to allow it. I don’t think this is\n       admissible under 613.\n\n       MS. BURKETT: And we need to proffer it because it’s a pretty\n       important piece of our case.\n\n       THE COURT: Okay.\n\n       ***\n\n       MS. BURKETT: If we were permitted to question this witness,\n       we anticipate that she would indicate that [E.P.] did in fact tell\n       her that she was going to lose her virginity before the – she told\n       her before the snowball that she had planned to lose her\n       virginity with Austin at the snowball. She then spoke to her on\n       Monday after the snowball and told her that, in fact, she did not\n       lose her virginity because the condom had broken. This is\n       directly contradictory to what [E.P.] testified to yesterday and\n       this statement would have been offered to impeach her.\n\n(Tr. at 509-510).\n\n       {¶55} On appeal, Shook contends that he should have been permitted to\n\nintroduce J.M.’s statement to impeach E.P. as having made prior inconsistent\n\nstatements. However, Shook overlooks the fact that E.P. never denied that she had\n\ntold J.M. she was still a virgin. E.P. explicitly testified on cross-examination that\n\nshe was lying to J.M. when she told her she was still a virgin at “snowball.” Thus\n\nShook had no basis to introduce extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent\n\n\n                                        -25-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\nstatement as E.P. did not provide inconsistent statements on this matter. Thus we\n\ncan find no error in the court’s denial of Shook’s proffered testimony. At the very\n\nleast, we cannot find that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding this\n\nevidence. See Kemp, supra, at ¶ ¶ 36-41.\n\n       {¶56} Moreover, even if there was error here, it clearly was not prejudicial\n\nwhere the jury already had the testimony from E.P. that she had lied to J.M. about\n\nbeing a virgin at the time of the snowball dance. J.M.’s testimony would have\n\nmerely been cumulative to testimony the jury was already aware of, and we could\n\nnot say that but-for this piece of evidence the outcome of the trial would have been\n\ndifferent. Thus even if there was error here, we cannot find that it was anything\n\nbut harmless. Accordingly, Shook’s third assignment of error is overruled.\n\n       {¶57} For the foregoing reasons Shook’s assignments of error are overruled\n\nand the judgment of the Logan County Common Pleas Court is affirmed.\n\n                                                               Judgment Affirmed\n\nROGERS and PRESTON, J.J., concur.\n\n/jlr\n\n\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\f",

Sanderson for Appellant\n\n        Eric C. Stewart for Appellee\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\nSHAW, J.\n\n      {¶1} Defendant-appellant John Timothy Shook (“Shook”) appeals the\n\nDecember 11, 2013 judgment of the Logan County Common Pleas Court\n\nsentencing Shook to an aggregate prison term of 7.5 years after Shook was\n\nconvicted in a jury trial of six counts of Sexual Battery in violation of R.C.\n\n2907.03(A)(7), all felonies of the third degree, five counts of Gross Sexual\n\nimposition in violation of R.C. 2907.05(A)(1), all felonies of the fourth degree,\n\nand one count of Attempted Sexual Battery in violation of R.C. 2923.02 and R.C.\n\n2907.05(A)(7), a felony of the fourth degree.\n\n      {¶2} The facts relevant to this appeal are as follows. On March 12, 2013,\n\nShook was indicted for various sexual crimes alleging that Shook, who was the\n\nband and choir teacher at Riverside school in Logan County, engaged in sexual\n\ncontact with three of his high school students. (Doc. 2). During the proceedings\n\nthe indictment was amended twice. (Doc. 18); (Doc. 52). Shook was ultimately\n\ncharged with thirteen total counts allegedly perpetrated against three separate\n\nvictims: six counts of Sexual Battery against victim E.P. in violation of R.C.\n\n2907.03(A)(7), all felonies of the third degree, three counts of Gross Sexual\n\nImposition of victim L.K. in violation of R.C. 2907.05(A)(1), all felonies of the\n\nfourth degree, Attempted Sexual Battery against victim L.K. in violation of R.C.\n\n2923.02 and R.C. 2907.03(A)(7), a felony of the fourth degree, two counts of\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\nGross Sexual Imposition against victim K.W. in violation of R.C. 2907.05(A)(1),\n\nboth felonies of the fourth degree, and one count of Attempted Sexual Battery\n\nagainst victim K.W. in violation of R.C. 2923.02 and R.C. 2907.03(A)(7), a felony\n\nof the fourth degree. (Doc. 52). Shook pled not guilty to the charges against him.\n\n      {¶3} On July 18, 2013, Shook filed a motion in limine to exclude “prior\n\nbad acts” evidence. (Doc. 36). In the memorandum in support, Shook argued that\n\nhe anticipated the State would offer the testimony of students he previously taught\n\nat another school and that those students would testify that Shook engaged in\n\nsexual acts with them. (Id.) Shook argued that such evidence would be unfairly\n\nprejudicial and was impermissible under Evid.R. 404(B).\n\n      {¶4} On July 29, 2013, the State filed a response to Shook’s motion in\n\nlimine, contending that under the Ohio Supreme Court’s decision in State v.\n\nWilliams, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">521</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2012), 404(B) evidence could be introduced in\n\nsexual abuse cases where it is relevant and probative if used to prove the\n\ndefendant’s plan, motive, intent, or preparation.     The State argued that the\n\ntestimony of the students from Shook’s previous school would be offered for just\n\nsuch a purpose. (Doc. 39).\n\n      {¶5} On September 19, 2013, the trial court filed a journal entry denying\n\nShook’s motion in limine, citing Williams, and this Court’s decision in State v.\n\nBump, 3d Dist. Logan No. 8-12-04, 2013-Ohio-1006. (Doc. 50). The trial court\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\nindicated that it would specifically instruct the jury that it could not consider the\n\ntestimony of Shook’s prior students to show that Shook acted in conformity with\n\nthese prior acts. (Id.)\n\n       {¶6} On October 14, 2013, Shook filed a “Motion to Sever the Indictment.”\n\n(Doc. 90). Shook contended that although the charges were all similar in character\n\nas sex offenses, the charges related to victims L.K. and K.W. required the state to\n\nprove that Shook acted “with the purpose of sexual gratification,” making the\n\ncharges substantially different from the Sexual Battery charges related to victim\n\nE.P. (Id.) On October 22, 2013, the State filed a response, contending that the law\n\nfavored joinder, and that the evidence related to each victim was simple and direct.\n\n(Doc. 123).\n\n       {¶7} On October 24, 2013, the trial court filed a journal entry denying\n\nShook’s motion to sever the indictment. (Doc. 133). The trial court reasoned that\n\nfirst, the testimony of the victims would be admissible in the other victims’ trials,\n\nand second that the evidence was simple and direct such that the jurors should not\n\nbe confused. (Id.)\n\n       {¶8} The case subsequently proceeded to a jury trial, which was held from\n\nOctober 29 to November 1, 2013. At trial the State called 14 witnesses including\n\nthe three victims. The first victim, E.P., testified that she was a student in Shook’s\n\nband and choir classes, that she was a member of Shook’s marching band, that she\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\nwas a “band aide” for Shook her freshman year of high school, that she\n\noccasionally babysat Shook’s children, and that she kept the book for Shook’s\n\njunior high basketball team. (Tr. at 186-194). E.P. testified that Shook first\n\nshowed an interest in her in his office, where he called her over and told her to sit\n\non his lap and read an email. (Tr. at 195-197). E.P. testified while she was on\n\nShook’s lap, Shook began touching her legs and vagina. (Tr. at 197-198). E.P.\n\ntestified that she was 16 at the time, and that Shook told her she could not tell\n\nanyone about the incident. (Tr. at 201).\n\n        {¶9} E.P. then testified to a series of incidents where she engaged in sexual\n\nacts with Shook, including losing her virginity to Shook, other incidents of vaginal\n\nsex, oral sex to both parties, and anal sex that occurred from December of 2011\n\nthrough January of 2013.1 E.P. testified to incidents that occurred in various\n\nlocations around Riverside school, and at Shook’s home.                            E.P. was able to\n\nspecifically identify dates and locations through dated entries in her journals,\n\nwhich were introduced into evidence at the trial.\n\n        {¶10} The second victim to testify at trial, L.K., testified that she had\n\nwanted to learn clarinet to join marching band so Shook began giving her lessons\n\nin his office at the school in the summer of 2012. (Tr. at 350). L.K. testified that\n\nafter her second lesson with Shook he called her over to the computer, put his arm\n\n\n1\n As Shook does not contest the sufficiency or weight of the evidence for any of his convictions, we find it\nunnecessary to recite the details of each separate instance of sexual activity.\n\n                                                   -5-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\naround her and then “touched [her] butt.” (Tr. at 353). L.K. testified that she was\n\ntold not to tell anyone, and that she did not tell her parents or other adults because\n\neveryone “loved” Shook. (Tr. at 355). L.K. testified that during the next lesson\n\nShook touched her butt and her breasts. (Tr. at 354). She testified that she tried to\n\npull away but she could not because Shook was “stronger.” (Id.) L. K. testified\n\nthat the same thing happened again at the next lesson, with Shook touching her\n\nbutt and her breasts. (Tr. at 355). L.K. testified the lesson after that she was\n\nwearing spandex because she had volleyball practice. L.K. testified that Shook\n\nput his hand down her spandex and touched her “bare vagina.” (Tr. at 357). L.K.\n\ntestified that shortly after that final incident she stopped going to private lessons\n\nwith Shook and quit marching band. (Tr. at 358).\n\n       {¶11} The third victim to testify at trial, K.W., testified that she was also a\n\nmember of the band and in Shook’s choir class. K.W. testified that Shook gave\n\nher a ride home from the school on multiple occasions. K.W. testified that on one\n\nof the rides home, Shook touched her leg and she was uncomfortable and scooted\n\naway. (Tr. at 388). K.W. testified that on another ride Shook touched her leg\n\nagain but up higher. (Tr. at 389). K.W. also testified to an incident that happened\n\nin Shook’s office where Shook spanked her with his bare hand, grabbed her\n\n“boob” and “squeezed her nipple.” (Tr. at 394). K.W. testified that Shook told\n\nher not to tell anyone because he would get fired if she did. (Tr. at 395).\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\n        {¶12} After the State rested its case, Shook called ten witnesses and also\n\ntook the stand himself to deny that he ever had sex with E.P. and to deny that he\n\ntouched L.K. or K.W. inappropriately.\n\n        {¶13} Following closing arguments and jury instructions,2 the case was\n\nsubmitted to the jury. The jury returned guilty verdicts on twelve of the thirteen\n\nindicted counts, acquitting Shook of the Attempted Sexual Battery of K.W. He\n\nwas otherwise found guilty of six counts of Sexual Battery against E.P. in\n\nviolation of R.C. 2907.03(A)(7), all felonies of the third degree, three counts of\n\nGross Sexual Imposition of victim L.K. in violation of R.C. 2907.05(A)(1), all\n\nfelonies of the fourth degree, Attempted Sexual Battery against L.K. in violation\n\nof R.C. 2923.02 and R.C. 2907.03(A)(7), a felony of the fourth degree, and two\n\ncounts of Gross Sexual Imposition against K.W. in violation of R.C.\n\n2907.05(A)(1), both felonies of the fourth degree.\n\n        {¶14} On December 9, 2013 a sentencing hearing was held. At the hearing\n\nShook had several people speak on his behalf pleading for leniency, and he made a\n\nstatement himself.          The prosecutor then made a statement and argued for\n\nmaximum consecutive sentences for a 39 year prison term. Members of the\n\nvictims’ families also made statements. After hearing the arguments of the parties\n\n\n\n\n2\n At the request of the defense, the jury was also instructed as to the lesser included offenses of Sexual\nImposition on the Gross Sexual Imposition charges.\n\n                                                  -7-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\nthe court sentenced Shook to serve an aggregate prison term of 7.5 years.3 A\n\njudgment entry memorializing this sentence was filed December 11, 2013. (Doc.\n\n163).\n\n        {¶15} It is from this judgment that Shook appeals, asserting the following\n\nassignments of error for our review.\n\n                    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR 1\n        THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED HARMFUL ERROR IN\n        DENYING THE REQUEST OF THE DEFENDANT-\n        APPELLANT TO SEVER THE COUNTS OF THE\n        INDICTMENT BELOW.\n\n                     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR 2\n        THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED HARMFUL ERROR IN\n        ADMITTING CERTAIN EVIDENCE OF “PRIOR BAD\n        ACTS” IN THE TRIAL OF THE INSTANT CASE.\n\n                     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR 3\n        THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED HARMFUL ERROR IN\n        PRECLUDING THE DEFENDANT-APPELLANT FROM\n        INTRODUCING EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE IN THE\n        TRIAL OF THE INSTANT CASE.\n\n                                    First Assignment of Error\n\n        {¶16} In Shook’s first assignment of error, he argues that the trial court\n\nerred by overruling his motion to sever the indictment.                         Specifically, Shook\n\ncontends that the crimes against the various victims vary temporally, and that the\n\n\n3\n  Shook was ordered to serve 5 years in prison on each of the Sexual Battery convictions against E.P.,\nwhich would run concurrent to each other. Shook was ordered to serve 15 months in prison on each of the\nfour convictions related to L.K., which would run concurrent to each other but consecutive to the five year\nSexual Battery term. Shook was ordered to serve 15 months in prison for the Gross Sexual Imposition\nconvictions against K.W., which would run concurrent to each other but consecutive to the other prison\nsentences, creating the aggregate prison term of 7.5 years.\n\n                                                   -8-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\ncrimes against victims L.K. and K.W. were dissimilar to those against victim E.P.\n\nbecause the State had to prove the extra element of “with purpose of sexual\n\ngratification” for L.K. and K.W.4\n\n         {¶17} The joinder of offenses is governed by Crim.R. 8(A) which provides:\n\n         Two or more offenses may be charged in the same indictment * *\n         * if the offenses charged * * * are of the same or similar\n         character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or are\n         based on two or more acts or transactions connected together or\n         constituting parts of a common scheme or plan, or are part of a\n         course of criminal conduct.\n\n         {¶18} “ ‘It is well-established that the law favors joinder because the\n\navoidance of multiple trials conserves time and expense and minimizes the\n\npotentially incongruous outcomes that can result from successive trials before\n\ndifferent juries.’ ” State v. Howard, 2d Dist. Greene No.2012–CA–39, 2013–\n\nOhio–2343, ¶ 35, quoting State v. Glass, 2d Dist.

It is actually part of the definition of sexual contact, which is an element of Gross Sexual\nImposition. Pursuant to R.C. 2907.01(B), “ ‘Sexual contact’ means any touching of an erogenous zone of\nanother, including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if the person is a female,\na breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or gratifying either person.” (Emphasis added.)\n\n                                                      -9-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\ncounts, grant a severance of defendants or provide such other relief as justice\n\nrequires.”\n\n       {¶20} “The defendant claiming error in the trial court's refusal to sever\n\nmultiple charges has the burden of affirmatively showing that his rights were\n\nprejudiced.” (Citations omitted.)    State v. Skatzes, 2d Dist. Montgomery No.\n\n15848, 2003–Ohio–516, ¶ 147. “To affirmatively show that his rights have been\n\nprejudiced, the defendant ‘must furnish the trial court with sufficient information\n\nso that it can weigh the considerations favoring joinder against the defendant's\n\nright to a fair trial, and [the defendant] must demonstrate that the court abused its\n\ndiscretion in refusing to separate the charges for trial.’ ” Glass, supra, at *3–4,\n\nquoting State v.

(Other citation omitted.)\n\n       {¶21} “When a defendant claims that he was prejudiced by the joinder of\n\nmultiple offenses, a court must determine (1) whether evidence of the other crimes\n\nwould be admissible even if the counts were severed, and (2) if not, whether the\n\nevidence of each crime is simple and distinct.” State v.

Moreover, “a defendant is not prejudiced by joinder where the\n\njoined offenses are ‘simple and direct, so that a jury is capable of segregating the\n\nproof required for each offense.’ ” State v. Wilson, 2d Dist. Montgomery No.\n\n20910, 2005–Ohio–6666, ¶ 38, quoting State v. Fletcher, 2d Dist. Clark No.2003–\n\nCA–62, 2004–Ohio–4517, ¶ 41.\n\n       {¶22} We review a trial court’s decision on joinder of offenses for trial\n\nunder an abuse of discretion standard. State v. Stober, 3d Dist. Putnam No. 12-13-\n\n09, 2014-Ohio-1568, ¶ 99. “The term ‘abuse of discretion’ connotes more than a\n\nmere error in law or judgment; it implies that the court's attitude was unreasonable,\n\narbitrary or unconscionable.” State v. Adams, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 157 (1980).\n\n       {¶23} In this case, prior to the trial, Shook filed a motion to sever the\n\nindictment, which was denied by the trial court. The trial court reasoned that the\n\ntestimony of the victims would be admissible in each other’s trials and that the\n\ntestimony was simple and direct such that it should not confuse the jury. The trial\n\ncourt thus found that both of the factors that the Ohio Supreme Court stated in\n\nSchaim were present in this case, supporting joinder, even though the trial court\n\nonly needed to find one factor or the other. Shook renewed his motion to sever the\n\nindictment at the beginning of the trial and it was again denied by the trial court,\n\nfor the same reasons it had stated previously.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\n      {¶24} Despite Shook’s arguments that the charges were dissimilar and\n\nvaried temporally, the evidence presented at trial suggests that many of the\n\ncharges were similar and that they occurred during the same time frame. Shook\n\nwas charged with Sexual Battery of E.P. and Attempted Sexual Battery of both\n\nL.K. and K.W., indicating a direct similarity between charged offenses against all\n\nthree victims. The remaining charges were all Gross Sexual Impositions, which\n\nwere also sexually-related crimes.\n\n      {¶25} Shook’s claim that the crimes varied temporally is not necessarily\n\nsupported by the record either. The testimony at trial indicated that all of the\n\nsexual crimes took place between December of 2011 and January of 2013. The\n\nSexual Batteries against E.P. allegedly took place over that entire span, while the\n\ncrimes against L.K. and K.W. both allegedly took place in the summer of 2012,\n\nspecifically July and August. Thus all of the crimes were of a similar nature and\n\nwere within the same time frame.\n\n      {¶26} The crimes were also similar in that they were all perpetrated against\n\nsimilarly aged victims who were all students in Shook’s classes. In addition, all\n\nthree victims testified to incidents that took place at the school, specifically in\n\nShook’s band room or his office. Thus Shook’s arguments that the crimes were\n\ndissimilar have no merit.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\n        {¶27} We addressed a similar argument to Shook’s in State v. Stober, 3d\n\nDist. Putnam No. 12-13-09, 2014-Ohio-1568, and found that the testimony of\n\nmultiple victims of a teacher who was having sexual contact with students could\n\nhave been admissible in each other’s trials under Evid.R. 404(B) “to show motive,\n\nintent, plan, or scheme.” Stober at ¶ 102. On this basis, we found that the trial\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant’s motion to sever. A\n\nsimilar holding is appropriate here where under 404(B) the State could have\n\nintroduced the testimony in each separate trial to show a plan or scheme.5\n\n        {¶28} Nevertheless, while the trial court needed only to find that either the\n\ntestimony would be admissible in separate trials or that the testimony was simple\n\nand direct, the trial court found both in this case. The result of the trial seems to\n\nsuggest that the testimony was simple and direct as the jury acquitted Shook on\n\none of the counts against victim K.W., indicating that the jury was able to clearly\n\nfollow and understand the testimony. There is no indication in the record that the\n\ntestimony was anything but simple and direct and Shook has not pointed us to\n\nanything to establish otherwise.\n\n        {¶29} Accordingly as it is Shook’s burden on appeal to establish\n\naffirmatively that the trial court erred in denying his motion to sever the\n\n\n5\n  In addition, we would note that Shook’s argument that there was an additional element to be proven in the\ncase of L.K. and K.W. similarly fails, as while “for the purpose of sexual gratification” is not explicitly\nstated in the Sexual Battery statute, having intercourse with a student carries an obvious implication of\nsexual gratification.\n\n                                                  -13-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\nindictment, that he was prejudiced by the denial of his motion and he has not done\n\nso, we cannot find the trial court abused its discretion.       Therefore his first\n\nassignment of error is overruled.\n\n                            Second Assignment of Error\n\n       {¶30} In his second assignment of error, Shook argues that the trial court\n\nerred in permitting the State to present the testimony of three witnesses from\n\nCovington, a school Shook taught at previously. Specifically Shook contends that\n\nthe testimony of these witnesses constituted prior “bad acts” testimony and was\n\nimpermissible under 404(B), that the students’ testimony was irrelevant, and that it\n\nwas far more prejudicial than probative.\n\n       {¶31} Evid.R. 404(B) reads as follows.\n\n       Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to\n       prove the character of a person in order to show action in\n       conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other\n       purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent,\n       preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or\n       accident. * * *\n\n       {¶32} “Generally, the prosecution in a criminal case may not present\n\nevidence that the defendant has committed other crimes or acts independent of the\n\ncrime for which the defendant is being tried to establish that the defendant acted in\n\nconformity with his bad character.” State v.

At trial J.H. testified that when he heard of Shook’s indictment he called\n\nthe authorities to report an incident he witnessed in the band room at Covington\n\nwhere Shook was kissing one of J.H.’s fellow students, T.C. (Tr. at 435). T.C.\n\ntestified that the kiss did take place, that it was mostly mutual, and that she later\n\nhad sex with Shook at his house one time. (Tr. at 449).\n\n         {¶36} C.B. testified that when she was 17 and a student of Shook’s at\n\nCovington she also had sex with Shook once during school. (Tr. at 460). C.B.\n\nand T.C. both testified that Shook flirted with his students. (Tr. at 448, 461). All\n\nthree of these students were members of Shook’s band at Covington.\n\n         {¶37} On appeal Shook argues that the Covington witnesses’ testimony\n\nwas not material, and that even if it was, the probative value was substantially\n\noutweighed by unfair prejudice.6 The State contends that the testimony of these\n\nCovington witnesses was permissible to show “motive, opportunity, intent,\n\npreparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident” and thus\n\nwas admissible at the trial. The State argues that the testimony was specifically\n\noffered to show that Shook had a pattern of preying on teenage female students\n\n\n6\n  Shook also argues that the Rape Shield statute should protect him from testimony regarding specific\nsexual acts, citing to R.C. 2907.02(D). We would note that Shook was not on trial for rape, and there is no\nsimilar “Rape Shield” provision in the Sexual Battery statute. There is one, however, in the GSI statute.\nNevertheless, there is a specific exception in that provision for the type of 404(B) evidence discussed here.\n\n                                                   -16-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\nfrom the age of 15-17 in his band and choir classes, and that he would then engage\n\nin sexual activity with them either on school grounds or at his home. The State\n\nalso contends that the Covington witnesses’ testimony was particularly relevant to\n\nthe claims of victim L.K. and K.W. where the State had to prove that when Shook\n\nhad contact with them, Shook had a sexual interest in those victims.\n\n       {¶38} The record supports the State’s arguments as Shook’s victims were\n\nall 15-17 year old females who were in his band class and the sexual activity took\n\nplace either in the school or at Shook’s home. Both of the female Covington\n\nwitnesses testified to incidents that happened in the school, which is similar in\n\nnature to all three of the victims in this case, indicating a plan or pattern.\n\n       {¶39} Moreover, the Covington witnesses’ testimony tends to show a\n\nsexual motive in Shook touching L.K. and K.W., which is relevant to the elements\n\nof the Gross Sexual Imposition charges. Shook either denied that he touched these\n\nvictims inappropriately, or claimed that any contact was not of a sexual nature.\n\nThe testimony of the Covington witnesses tends to dispute his denials and\n\nindicates that Shook had a sexual interest in girls of that age in his classes.\n\n       {¶40} While there is some inherent prejudice in allowing the testimony of\n\nthe Covington witnesses, we cannot find under the facts and circumstances of this\n\ncase that the trial court abused its discretion in finding that the Covington\n\nwitnesses’ testimony was admissible at trial.\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\n       {¶41} Nevertheless, even if the testimony of the Covington witnesses was\n\nimproperly admitted, any resulting prejudice was severely diminished by the trial\n\ncourt’s multiple limiting instructions, and by being, at least in some part,\n\ncumulative to other testimony already in the record.\n\n       {¶42} Prior to any of the Covington witnesses taking the stand, the court\n\ngave the following limiting instruction to the jury.\n\n       Ladies and gentlemen, the State, as they have told you in\n       opening statement, is going to have witnesses from the prior\n       school district that the defendant was employed at. This is what\n       we call other acts evidence, and there are rules under which this\n       is admissible. We do not in this court or any other court in the\n       State convict somebody of bad character, so his – his character\n       isn’t at issue here, and this testimony isn’t being admitted to\n       show the defendant’s character or that he acted in conformity\n       with that character; it’s being admitted to prove other elements\n       of the offense such as purpose, motive, plan, or scheme.\n\n(Tr. at 413).\n\n       {¶43} At the conclusion of the trial, Shook’s counsel further highlighted the\n\ncourt’s preliminary instruction to the jury during his closing arguments, by\n\nemphasizing that the jury could not consider the Covington witnesses’ testimony\n\nas 404(B) evidence.\n\n       I would like to talk for a moment before I start to talk about the\n       actual alleged victims in this case, about the evidence that you\n       heard from the witnesses who testified from Covington.\n\n       As [the prosecutor] indicated, they were not victims in this case.\n       There are no charges filed in that case, and the judge will give\n       you a limited instruction telling you you can only consider their\n\n                                        -18-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\n        testimony for the purpose of determining motive, opportunity,\n        intent, or purpose, preparation or plan to commit the offense.\n        What you cannot consider it for is that Mr. Shook acted in\n        conformity therewith.\n\n        He told you when he talked to you about this before; that the\n        reason for that is that we do not consider that because somebody\n        did something bad in the past [does not mean] they did\n        something bad at this point. You’re not permitted to consider it\n        for that purpose, and there’s a very good reason.\n\n        Think about the witnesses from Covington. Charges happened\n        eight years ago. What opportunity, what real opportunity does\n        Mr. Shook have to provide you a defense to those charges?\n        Counts that he’s not even charged with? Eight years ago,\n        witnesses are gone, memories are faded. There might be alibi\n        witnesses, there might have been someone else who was there.\n\n        These people did not come forward. They did not give him the\n        opportunity to contest those charges, and it’s improper for you\n        to consider that he did that then and because of that he’s done\n        what he did to these girls. You may not make that connection.\n\n        You may consider it for motive, opportunity, intent, or purpose,\n        and when you look at it that way, is what he allegedly did with\n        the Covington witnesses the same as what he did in this case?\n\n(Tr. at 729-730). Defense counsel then continued to argue that that the incidents at\n\nCovington were different than the incidents in this case.7\n\n        {¶44} After closing arguments concluded, the trial court gave its formal\n\ninstructions to the jury, and specifically instructed the jury again on this issue of\n\nthe Covington witnesses, using the following language.\n\n\n7\n In defense counsel’s lengthy closing argument, she routinely attacks the idea that a consistent “plan,”\n“motive,” or “scheme” etc. was shown through the use of the Covington witnesses. (Tr. at 730-31, 762,\n779).\n\n                                                 -19-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\n       Evidence was received about the commission of crimes or wrong\n       acts other than the offense with which the defendant is charged\n       in this trial. That evidence was received only for a limited\n       purpose. It was not received and you may not consider it to\n       prove the character of the defendant in order to show that he\n       acted in conformity with that character. If you find that the\n       evidence of other crimes or wrongs – or wrong act true and the\n       defendant committed it or them, you may consider that evidence\n       only for the purpose of deciding whether it proves the\n       defendant’s motive, opportunity, intent or purpose, preparation,\n       or plan to commit the offense charged in this trial. That\n       evidence cannot be considered for any other purpose.\n\n(Tr. at 803-804).\n\n       {¶45} The trial court thus gave a limiting instruction before the evidence\n\nwas even heard, and an instruction to the jury before they deliberated. As we\n\npresume that the jury followed the court’s instructions, we find any potential\n\nprejudice severely limited in this case.\n\n       {¶46} That any potential prejudice is severely limited is also particularly\n\ntrue in light of the fact that the jury was already aware of the existence of at least\n\none Covington witness through the testimony of victim E.P.             During direct\n\nexamination of E.P., the following exchange occurred.\n\n       Q: Did [Shook] ever talk about why he left his former job?\n\n       A: He had said that he was having sexual relations with a girl\n       from Covington and she had told her friends and then the\n       teachers heard about it and started asking questions so he just\n       left.\n\n       Q: Okay. Do you remember where that conversation occurred?\n\n\n                                           -20-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\n       A: We were in the instrument room.\n\n(Tr. at 214). Therefore the jury was at least in part already aware of accusations of\n\nShook having a sexual relationship with a former student at Covington.\n\n       {¶47} Thus based on the record before us, we cannot find that the trial court\n\nabused its discretion in permitting the Covington witnesses’ testimony. However,\n\neven if the testimony was improperly admitted, we find that any prejudice was\n\nseverely limited.   Any resulting prejudice seems insignificant in light of the\n\nsubstantial evidence presented at trial, particularly with regard to E.P., who even\n\nhad journals detailing some of her encounters with Shook. Accordingly, for all of\n\nthe foregoing reasons, Shook’s second assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                            Third Assignment of Error\n\n       {¶48} In Shook’s third assignment of error, he argues that the trial court\n\nerred by excluding the testimony of one of his witnesses. Specifically, Shook\n\ncontends that the trial court erred in excluding the testimony of J.M., who would\n\nhave testified that victim E.P. told J.M. she was still a virgin after the date on\n\nwhich E.P. claimed at trial to have had sex with Shook.\n\n       {¶49} A trial court has broad discretion whether to admit or exclude\n\nevidence and its decision in such matters will not be disturbed on appeal absent an\n\nabuse of discretion.

During Shook’s counsel’s cross-examination of E.P.,\n\nthe following testimony was presented.\n\n      Q [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So you went to snowball February\n      4th with Austin, and you talked with [J.M.] about that the\n      following Monday, didn’t you?\n\n      ***\n\n      A [E.P.]: Yes.\n\n      Q: In fact, you told her that you had a plan with Austin to lose\n      your virginity that night but it didn’t happen because the\n      condom broke. Do you remember telling [J.M.] that?\n\n      A: Not my virginity, his virginity.\n\n      Q: That’s not what you told [J.M.]. Your plan was to lose your\n      virginity?\n\n      A: She thought that I was still a virgin.\n\n                                         -23-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\n\n       Q: Excuse me?\n\n       A: She thought that I was still a virgin.\n\n       Q: So you were lying to her when you said that?\n\n       A: Yes, I was.\n\n(Tr. at 256-257).\n\n       {¶54} In order to further attempt to challenge E.P.’s claims and her\n\ncredibility, Shook called J.M. to the stand in his case-in-chief. When Shook’s\n\ncounsel began to ask J.M. about what E.P. had told her regarding the dance and\n\nlosing her virginity to Austin, the State objected and the following conversation\n\nwas held.\n\n       [STATE]: Objection. This is hearsay.\n\n       MS. BURKETT [Defense Counsel]: I can direct it specifically to\n       impeaching [E.P.]’s testimony yesterday[.]\n\n       THE COURT: Let’s have a side bar, counsel.\n\n       ***\n\n       [During sidebar]\n\n       THE COURT: It’s still hearsay.\n\n       MS. BURKETT [Defense Counsel]: [E.P.] testified yesterday\n       that she did not tell [J.M.] that she was going to lose her\n       virginity.\n\n       THE COURT: What she is testifying is hearsay. What is the\n       hearsay exception?\n\n                                       -24-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\n\n       MS. BURKETT: It’s one prior inconsistent statement, Your\n       Honor.\n\n       ***\n\n       THE COURT: I’m not going to allow it. I don’t think this is\n       admissible under 613.\n\n       MS. BURKETT: And we need to proffer it because it’s a pretty\n       important piece of our case.\n\n       THE COURT: Okay.\n\n       ***\n\n       MS. BURKETT: If we were permitted to question this witness,\n       we anticipate that she would indicate that [E.P.] did in fact tell\n       her that she was going to lose her virginity before the – she told\n       her before the snowball that she had planned to lose her\n       virginity with Austin at the snowball. She then spoke to her on\n       Monday after the snowball and told her that, in fact, she did not\n       lose her virginity because the condom had broken. This is\n       directly contradictory to what [E.P.] testified to yesterday and\n       this statement would have been offered to impeach her.\n\n(Tr. at 509-510).\n\n       {¶55} On appeal, Shook contends that he should have been permitted to\n\nintroduce J.M.’s statement to impeach E.P. as having made prior inconsistent\n\nstatements. However, Shook overlooks the fact that E.P. never denied that she had\n\ntold J.M. she was still a virgin. E.P. explicitly testified on cross-examination that\n\nshe was lying to J.M. when she told her she was still a virgin at “snowball.” Thus\n\nShook had no basis to introduce extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent\n\n\n                                        -25-\n\fCase No. 8-14-01\n\n\nstatement as E.P. did not provide inconsistent statements on this matter. Thus we\n\ncan find no error in the court’s denial of Shook’s proffered testimony. At the very\n\nleast, we cannot find that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding this\n\nevidence. See Kemp, supra, at ¶ ¶ 36-41.\n\n       {¶56} Moreover, even if there was error here, it clearly was not prejudicial\n\nwhere the jury already had the testimony from E.P. that she had lied to J.M. about\n\nbeing a virgin at the time of the snowball dance. J.M.’s testimony would have\n\nmerely been cumulative to testimony the jury was already aware of, and we could\n\nnot say that but-for this piece of evidence the outcome of the trial would have been\n\ndifferent. Thus even if there was error here, we cannot find that it was anything\n\nbut harmless. Accordingly, Shook’s third assignment of error is overruled.\n\n       {¶57} For the foregoing reasons Shook’s assignments of error are overruled\n\nand the judgment of the Logan County Common Pleas Court is affirmed.\n\n                                                               Judgment Affirmed\n\nROGERS and PRESTON, J.J., concur.\n\n/jlr\n\n\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\f</pre>",
