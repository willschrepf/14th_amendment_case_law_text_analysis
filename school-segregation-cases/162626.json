Richard G. Stearns, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n               Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n                 and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Renee J. Bushey, with whom Michael A. Feinberg and Feinberg,\r\nCharnas &amp; Birmingham, P.C. were on brief, for appellants.\r\n   Richard W. Gleeson, with whom Gleeson &amp; Corcoran was on brief,\r\nfor appellee.\r\n\nDecember 29, 1999\r\n\nSELYA, Circuit Judge.  Henry John Fernandes, Richard H.\r\nGilbert, and Benjamin G. Rose, all dark-skinned Cape Verdeans,\r\nsued their quondam employer, Costa Brothers Masonry, Inc. (Costa\r\nBros.), alleging a discriminatory failure to rehire.  They now\r\nappeal from an order granting summary judgment against them.  Their\r\nappeal requires us to explore how courts charged with resolving\r\ndiscrimination cases should choose between pretext analysis (an\r\napproach first limned in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S.\r\n792 (1973)) and mixed-motive analysis (an alternative approach\r\nlimned later in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228 (1989)\r\n(plurality opinion)).  We conclude, as did the district court, that\r\nthe evidence thus far adduced does not trigger mixed-motive\r\nanalysis.  We also conclude, however, that under a properly\r\nperformed pretext analysis, the appellants' case should have\r\nsurvived.  Consequently, we vacate the judgment and remand for\r\nfurther proceedings.\r\nI.  THE FACTS\r\nAs the summary judgment standard demands, we take the\r\nfacts in the light most hospitable to the appellants, indulging all\r\nreasonable inferences in their favor.  See Conward v. Cambridge\r\nSch. Comm., 171 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 1999).  Mindful of this coign\r\nof vantage, we deliberately omit from our narrative versions of\r\ncertain conversations and events that conflict with the appellants'\r\naccounts.\r\nIn 1995, Stone Building Company secured a contract to\r\nconstruct a new high school in Mashpee, Massachusetts.  It engaged\r\nCosta Bros. as the masonry subcontractor.  Because the job was\r\npublicly funded, contractors and subcontractors were told that they\r\nhad to conform to specific equal employment opportunity (EEO) rules\r\nand to issue weekly EEO summaries documenting the number of hours\r\nworked by minority employees.\r\nA Portuguese immigrant, Domingos DaCosta, owns Costa\r\nBros.  On November 13, 1995, he retained Sebastian Ceribelli, a\r\nBrazilian, as the masonry foreman for the Mashpee project.  DaCosta\r\nand Ceribelli then hired a number of masons and laborers to work on\r\nthe job.  Those engaged on November 27 included five masons   the\r\nappellants and two white males, George Choquette and George\r\nMedeiros   and a dark-skinned Cape Verdean laborer, Glenn Spinola. \r\nThese six men worked as a team until December 7, when Ceribelli\r\nlaid off all six due to winter weather conditions and lack of heat\r\nin the workplace.  He vowed that he would recall them when the\r\nheating quandary had been solved.  Other workers were laid off at\r\nroughly the same time (although some, unlike the appellants, were\r\nassigned to ongoing Costa Bros. projects elsewhere).\r\nOn or about December 13, Costa Bros. resumed work on the\r\nMashpee project.  It recalled some masons (but not the appellants). \r\nGilbert visited the job site the following week and asked Ceribelli\r\nwhen he would be rehired.  Ceribelli responded, \"The way things are\r\ngoing now . . . I wouldn't count on it.\"\r\nRose sojourned to the site the next Saturday.  He noticed\r\nmasons working there and queried DaCosta about this circumstance. \r\nDaCosta replied, \"We're doing a little fixing up here.\"  Rose then\r\nasked, \"Are we going to get called back?\"  DaCosta responded,\r\n\"We're going to close in\"   a comment that Rose reasonably took to\r\nmean that the building would be enclosed in order to create a\r\nheated space in which masons could work.\r\nHaving heard nothing further, Rose checked back two weeks\r\nlater.  He saw that the job site was fully heated and asked\r\nDaCosta, \"Aren't we coming back?\"  DaCosta replied cryptically,\r\n\"Well, I got my men.\"  When Rose inquired about what had happened\r\nto the plan to recruit residents and minorities, DaCosta stated, \"I\r\ndon't need minorities, and I don't need no residents on this job. \r\nI got my men.\"  Rose complained that DaCosta had \"twelve new faces\"\r\nworking on the project, but DaCosta abruptly terminated the\r\nconversation.\r\nIn point of fact, Costa Bros. recalled a total of\r\neighteen workmen (masons and laborers) between December 13 and\r\nJanuary 25, and hired ten new ones in that span (none of whom had\r\nworked previously for Costa Bros.).  All twenty-eight were white\r\nmales.\r\nFernandes returned to the job site on numerous occasions\r\nin December and January.  Each time, DaCosta told him that there\r\nwas no work available but to come back again.  After several weeks,\r\nFernandes asked Ceribelli why he and the other Cape Verdeans had\r\nnot been recalled.  Ceribelli replied that Costa Bros. \"had only\r\nhired a few minorities because of local pressure.\"\r\nOn January 30, DaCosta, James Byrne (the clerk of the\r\nworks), and a representative of the general contractor met with\r\nFernandes, Raoul Galvin (a civil rights activist), and others from\r\nthe local community regarding Costa Bros.'s compliance with EEO\r\nrequirements.  Galvin noted that Costa Bros. had hired more\r\nworkers, all of whom were white, but that it had no minorities\r\nworking at the site.  He implored DaCosta to rehire Fernandes\r\nbecause \"whatever was going on at the time would stop if he at\r\nleast put one of [the Cape Verdeans] back to work.\"  DaCosta\r\nindicated that he would honor this request.\r\nFernandes reported for duty the following Monday but was\r\ninformed that there was no work available.  This experience was\r\nrepeated several times.  Costa Bros. finally restored Fernandes to\r\nthe payroll on March 26, albeit as a laborer rather than as a\r\nmason.  On the same day, Ceribelli warned him to \"watch out\"\r\nbecause DaCosta was \"going to be on [his] back.\"  This prediction\r\nproved prophetic:  according to Fernandes, DaCosta \"followed [him]\r\naround,\" constantly \"hollering and screaming\" at him.\r\nWhen Fernandes reported for work the next morning,\r\nDaCosta instructed him to get an \"F block\" (or so he thought). \r\nFernandes was unsure what an \"F block\" was and asked DaCosta (who,\r\nas matters turned out, had wanted a standard \"half block\").  After\r\ncastigating Fernandes for his ignorance, DaCosta declared that he\r\nwas \"tired of . . . what's going on between you guys,\" and voiced\r\nthe opinion that \"[y]ou guys are trying to hurt me.\"  He then\r\nproclaimed:  \"I don't have to hire you locals or Cape Verdean\r\npeople.  This is my business.  It belongs to me.\"  At that\r\njuncture, DaCosta fired Fernandes.\r\nII.  TRAVEL OF THE CASE\r\nAfter pursuing administrative remedies, see 42 U.S.C. \r\n2000e-5(e); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B,  5, the appellants sued.  In\r\ntheir complaint, they alleged discrimination on the basis of race\r\nand color in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\r\n1964, 42 U.S.C.  2000e to 2000e-17, and its state-law analogue,\r\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B,  4(1).  Costa Bros. denied the material\r\nallegations of the complaint, and the parties spent the next year\r\nconducting pretrial discovery.  From the record and the briefs, it\r\nappears that the appellants' original claim was constructively\r\namended to include discrimination predicated on national origin,\r\nand the case went forward on that assumption.\r\nIn due course, Costa Bros. moved for summary judgment,\r\nsee Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, and the appellants filed an opposition. \r\nThe district court heard oral argument, took the matter under\r\nadvisement, and thereafter granted the motion as to all claims.  In\r\nits unpublished rescript, the court characterized DaCosta's\r\nstatement that \"I don't need minorities . . . on this job\" as a\r\nstray remark, insufficient to trigger mixed-motive analysis. \r\nAlthough the court catalogued DaCosta's comment that \"I don't have\r\nto hire you locals or Cape Verdean people\" in its recitation of the\r\nfacts, it did not mention this comment thereafter.\r\nUndertaking pretext analysis, the court focused on two\r\nwhite masons who had been hired in January 1996   Piper and\r\nWinters.  The court ruled that the Piper hiring did not assist the\r\nappellants because Piper had special skills and they could not\r\nestablish that their qualifications were equivalent to his.  As to\r\nWinters, the court accepted Costa Bros.'s explanation that it had\r\nhired him on the recommendation of another employee, characterizing\r\nwhat had happened as cronyism rather than discrimination.  The\r\ncourt never discussed whether the record sufficed to support a\r\nfinding that this explanation was pretextual, nor did it explore\r\nthe numerous other employment decisions that Costa Bros. made in\r\nthe December-January time frame.  This appeal followed.\r\nIII.  DISCUSSION\r\nThe appellants asseverate that the district court erred\r\nin choosing a legal framework and that, even if the court marched\r\ndown an acceptable analytic path, it did not stay on track.  We\r\nconsider these arguments in sequence, pausing first to frame the\r\nchoice-of-approach issue.  We then briefly address the appellants'\r\nstate-law claim.\r\n             A.  The Available Analytic Methods.\r\nA plaintiff alleging disparate treatment under Title VII\r\nmay proceed on a mixed-motive approach or on a pretext approach. \r\nFor purposes of this case, it is important to understand the basic\r\ndifference between these two modalities.\r\nMixed-motive analysis applies when the evidence shows\r\nthat an employer considered both a proscribed factor (say, race)\r\nand one or more legitimate factors (say, competence) in making a\r\nchallenged employment decision.  See  Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at\r\n241-42.  In that scenario, the plaintiff is not obliged to separate\r\nout the relative import of each element that went into the\r\ndecision; rather, once the plaintiff proves that a proscribed\r\nfactor \"played a motivating part\" in the decision, the burden of\r\npersuasion shifts to the employer, who will be held liable for\r\ndamages under Title VII unless \"it can prove that, even if it had\r\nnot taken [the proscribed factor] into account, it would have come\r\nto the same decision regarding [the plaintiff].\"  Id. at 242, 244. \r\nEven then, because Congress has reshaped mixed-motive analysis in\r\ncertain respects, the employee may be entitled to equitable relief\r\nso long as he has proven that the proscribed factor played some\r\npart in the decisional calculus.  See 42 U.S.C.  2000e-2(m);\r\n2000e-5(g)(2)(B); see also Higgins v. New Balance Athletic Shoe,\r\nInc., 194 F.3d 252, 259 n.3 (1st Cir. 1999); Carey v. Mt. Desert\r\nIsland Hosp., 156 F.3d 31, 43-44 (1st Cir. 1998).\r\nIt is readily apparent that this mixed-motive approach,\r\nuncabined, has the potential to swallow whole the traditional\r\nMcDonnell Douglas analysis.  To guard against this possibility, the\r\nCourt restricted its applicability to those infrequent cases in\r\nwhich a plaintiff can demonstrate with a high degree of assurance\r\nthat the employment decision of which he complains \"was the product\r\nof a mixture of legitimate and illegitimate motives.\"  Price\r\nWaterhouse, 490 U.S. at 247.  Under this formulation, access to the\r\nmixed-motive approach ultimately depends on the quality of the\r\navailable evidence.  Most courts agree that Justice O'Connor's\r\nseminal concurrence in Price Waterhouse furnishes the best device\r\nfor testing quality (and, thus, the best roadmap for segregating\r\nmixed-motive cases from the mine-run of discrimination cases). \r\nAfter all, when the Supreme Court rules by means of a plurality\r\nopinion (as was true in Price Waterhouse), inferior courts should\r\ngive effect to the narrowest ground upon which a majority of the\r\nJustices supporting the judgment would agree.  See Marks v. United\r\nStates, 430 U.S. 188, 193 (1977).  The O'Connor concurrence fits\r\nthis profile.  Hence, we turn to it.\r\n\"What is required [to trigger mixed-motive analysis] is\r\n. . . direct evidence that decisionmakers placed substantial\r\nnegative reliance on an illegitimate criterion in reaching their\r\ndecision.\"  Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 277 (O'Connor, J.,\r\nconcurring).  Because discrimination tends more and more to operate\r\nin subtle ways, direct evidence is relatively rare; when it comes\r\nto light, however, a plaintiff can use it to demonstrate \"that an\r\nillegitimate factor played a substantial role in a particular\r\nemployment decision.\"  Id. at 275.  It follows that plaintiffs may\r\nuse the Price Waterhouse mechanism in disparate treatment cases in\r\nwhich they adduce direct evidence of a discriminatory animus,\r\nwhereas they must proceed under the conventional McDonnell Douglas\r\nframework (commonly called \"pretext analysis\") in all other cases. \r\nSee Ayala-Gerena v. Bristol Myers-Squibb Co., 95 F.3d 86, 95 (1st\r\nCir. 1996).\r\nUnder the pretext method, the plaintiff first must\r\nestablish a prima facie case.  See Texas Dep't of Comm'y Affairs v.\r\nBurdine, 450 U.S. 248, 252-53 (1981); McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S.\r\nat 802.  We shall return to the components of the prima facie case;\r\nfor now, it suffices to say that this requirement is \"not onerous.\" \r\nBurdine, 450 U.S. at 253.  If the plaintiff clears this modest\r\nhurdle, the burden of production   but not the burden of persuasion\r\nshifts to the employer, who must articulate a legitimate,\r\nnondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action.  See\r\nSt. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506-07 (1993);\r\nBurdine, 450 U.S. at 254-55.  Once that occurs, the plaintiff must\r\nshow both that the employer's \"proffered reason is a sham, and that\r\ndiscriminatory animus sparked [its] actions.\"  Conward, 171 F.3d at\r\n19.  To this end, the full panoply of circumstantial evidence is\r\navailable, including but not limited to \"statistical evidence\r\nshowing disparate treatment by the employer of members of the\r\nprotected class, comments by decisionmakers which denigrate\r\n[persons in the protected group], the incidence of differential\r\ntreatment in the workplace, and the deployment of . . .\r\nreplacements.\"  Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 824\r\n(1st Cir. 1991) (citations omitted).  The totality of the evidence\r\nthen is examined \"as part of an aggregate package of proof.\"  Id.\r\nA plaintiff, uncertain of what discovery will yield or\r\nhow a judge will react to certain proffers, may elect to proceed\r\nsimultaneously on both fronts (mixed-motive and pretext), cognizant\r\nthat the trial court, at an appropriate stage of the litigation,\r\nwill channel the case into one format or the other.  See Price\r\nWaterhouse, 490 U.S. at 247 n.12; Thomas v. National Football\r\nLeague Players Ass'n, 131 F.3d 198, 202 (D.C. Cir. 1997). \r\nConsistent with the O'Connor concurrence, the court typically will\r\nmake that determination based on the availability or unavailability\r\nof direct evidence.  See Taylor v. Virginia Union Univ., 193 F.3d\r\n219, 232 (4th Cir. 1999) (en banc); Ostrowski v. Atlantic Mut. Ins.\r\nCos., 968 F.2d 171, 181-82 (2d Cir. 1992).\r\nThis ruling can have important effects on the outcome of\r\nthe litigation.  In a mixed-motive analysis, \"the burden of\r\npersuasion shifts from the employee to the employer, who must then\r\naffirmatively prove that it would have made the same decision even\r\nif it had not taken the protected characteristic into account.\" \r\nAyala-Gerena, 95 F.3d at 95-96; accord Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S.\r\nat 246 (explaining that, under a mixed-motive analysis, \"the\r\nplaintiff must persuade the factfinder on one point, and then the\r\nemployer, if it wishes to prevail, must persuade it on another\"). \r\nThis contrasts vividly with pretext analysis, under which the\r\nemployee retains the burden of persuasion throughout.  See Cumpiano\r\nv. Banco Santander P.R., 902 F.2d 148, 153 (1st Cir. 1990).\r\n                  B.  Mixed-Motive Analysis.\r\nWith this preface, we turn to the appellants' contention\r\nthat the lower court erred in eschewing a mixed-motive analysis. \r\nBecause this case comes to us on appeal from an order granting\r\nbrevis disposition, we afford de novo review.  See Conward, 171\r\nF.3d at 18.\r\nAs our earlier discussion indicates, direct evidence is\r\nthe touchstone for mixed-motive analysis.  Hence, the fate of the\r\nappellants' present contention hinges on whether they adduced\r\ndirect evidence of Costa Bros.'s use of a proscribed factor (race,\r\ncolor, and/or national origin) in the decisional process. \r\nAnswering that question is more difficult than might appear at\r\nfirst blush.  To be sure, Justice O'Connor furnished a trenchant,\r\nuniversally accepted example of what is not direct evidence:  stray\r\nremarks, such as \"statements by nondecisionmakers, or statements by\r\ndecisionmakers unrelated to the decisional process itself.\"  Price\r\nWaterhouse, 490 U.S. at 277 (O'Connor, J., concurring).  Since\r\nthen, however, jurists have struggled in attempting to define the\r\nterm affirmatively.  This operose task not only has divided the\r\ncourts of appeals but also has created a patchwork of intra-circuit\r\nconflicts.  Generally speaking, three schools of thought have\r\nemerged.\r\n1.  The \"Classic\" Position.  Some courts adopt the\r\ntraditional definition of \"direct evidence\" for this purpose,\r\nholding that the term signifies evidence which, if believed,\r\nsuffices to prove the fact of discriminatory animus without\r\ninference, presumption, or resort to other evidence.  See, e.g.,\r\nShorter v. ICG Holdings, Inc., 188 F.3d 1204, 1207 (10th Cir.\r\n1999); Haas v. Advo Sys., Inc., 168 F.3d 732, 734 n.2 (5th Cir.\r\n1999); EEOC v. Wiltel, Inc., 81 F.3d 1508, 1514 (10th Cir. 1996);\r\nNichols v. Loral Vought Sys. Corp., 81 F.3d 38, 40 (5th Cir. 1996). \r\nAlthough only the Fifth and Tenth Circuits cling consistently to\r\nthis view, other tribunals have embraced it periodically.  See,\r\ne.g., Carter v. Three Springs Resid'l Treatment, 132 F.3d 635, 641\r\n(11th Cir. 1998); Troupe v. May Dep't Stores Co., 20 F.3d 734, 736\r\n(7th Cir. 1994).\r\n2.  The \"Animus Plus\" Position.  The Fourth Circuit,\r\nsitting en banc, recently defined \"direct evidence\" for this\r\npurpose as evidence, both direct and circumstantial, of conduct or\r\nstatements that (1) reflect directly the alleged discriminatory\r\nanimus and (2) bear squarely on the contested employment decision. \r\nSee Taylor, 193 F.3d at 232.  The D.C. Circuit takes the same view. \r\nSee Thomas, 131 F.3d at 204.  The Ninth Circuit seems headed in\r\nthis direction.  See Lambert v. Ackerley, 180 F.3d 997, 1008-09\r\n(9th Cir. 1999) (en banc), petition for cert. filed, 68 U.S.L.W.\r\n3292 (U.S. Oct. 20, 1999) (No. 99-681).  The Third Circuit at one\r\ntime was in the \"animus plus\" camp, see Walden v. Georgia-Pacific\r\nCorp., 126 F.3d 506, 513 (3d Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct.\r\n1516 (1998), but that court is poised to revisit the question.  See\r\nHankins v. City of Philadelphia, 189 F.3d 353 (3d Cir. 1999),\r\nrehearing en banc granted, opinion vacated, 188 F.3d 217 (3d Cir.\r\n1999).  Two other courts of appeals have indicated occasional\r\napproval of this approach, see, e.g., Sheehan v. Donlen Corp., 173\r\nF.3d 1039, 1044 (7th Cir. 1999); Deneen v. Northwest Airlines,\r\nInc., 132 F.3d 431, 436 (8th Cir. 1998), but as the cases cited\r\nherein indicate, both of these courts have flirted with other\r\nformulations.  Courts endorsing the animus plus position do not\r\ndistinguish between direct and circumstantial evidence in the\r\nclassic sense but, rather, emphasize that the mixed-motive trigger\r\ndepends on the strength of the plaintiff's case.  See, e.g.,\r\nKubicko v. Ogden Logistics Servs., 181 F.3d 544, 553 (4th Cir.\r\n1999) (emphasizing that whether a case falls under the mixed-motive\r\nor pretext rubric \"ultimately hinges on the strength of the\r\nevidence establishing discrimination\") (citation and internal\r\nquotation marks omitted); Thomas, 131 F.3d at 204 (similar).\r\n3.  The \"Animus\" Position.  A few courts resolve the\r\ndirect evidence conundrum by the simple expedient of deleting the\r\n\"plus\" from the \"animus plus\" formulation.  Those courts opine that\r\nas long as the evidence (whether direct or circumstantial) is tied\r\nto the alleged discriminatory animus, it need not bear squarely on\r\nthe challenged employment decision.  The Second Circuit advocates\r\nthis position.  See, e.g., Lightfoot v. Union Carbide Corp., 110\r\nF.3d 898, 913 (2d Cir. 1997); Ostrowski, 968 F.2d at 182.  The\r\nEighth Circuit intermittently takes this stance, see, e.g., Kerns\r\nv. Capital Graphics, Inc., 178 F.3d 1011, 1017-18 (8th Cir. 1999);\r\nRadabaugh v. Zip Feed Mills, Inc., 997 F.2d 444, 449 (8th Cir.\r\n1993), and two other cases appear to fit somewhat loosely into this\r\ncategory, see Wright v. Southland Corp., 187 F.3d 1287, 1303-04\r\n(11th Cir. 1999); Hennessy v. Penril Datacomm Networks, Inc., 69\r\nF.3d 1344, 1348-50 (7th Cir. 1995).\r\n4.  The First Circuit's Position.  To complete our survey\r\nof the legal landscape, we direct our gaze inward.  Although we\r\nhave dropped inconclusive hints here and there, see, e.g., Ayala-\r\nGerena, 95 F.3d at 95-96; Smith v. F.W. Morse &amp; Co., 76 F.3d 413,\r\n421 (1st Cir. 1996), we have yet to choose among these conflicting\r\napproaches.  Thus, the question is wide open in this circuit.\r\n5.  The Case at Hand.  This case does not require us to\r\nfill the void, and we decline to do so gratuitously.  The\r\nappellants contend that two comments attributed to DaCosta   \"I\r\ndon't need minorities, and I don't need residents on this job\" and\r\n\"I don't have to hire you locals or Cape Verdean people\"  \r\nconstitute direct evidence that a proscribed factor influenced\r\nCosta Bros.'s hiring practices.  The employer demurs, asserting\r\nthat these are merely \"stray remarks\" and, in all events, lack\r\nsufficient probative force to constitute direct evidence.\r\nWe do not share the view that DaCosta's statements must\r\nbe classified as stray remarks.  As we have pointed out, DaCosta\r\nwas the ultimate decisionmaker, and both pronouncements pertained\r\nto the decisional process.  He made the first statement when\r\nrefusing to rehire Rose; because it bore directly on a challenged\r\nemployment decision, it hardly qualifies as a stray remark.  See,\r\ne.g., Deneen, 132 F.3d at 436; Diaz-Gandia v. Dapena-Thompson, 90\r\nF.3d 609, 616 (1st Cir. 1996).  DaCosta uttered the second\r\nstatement when cashiering Fernandez and, although this suit does\r\nnot challenge Fernandes's dismissal per se, see infra note 3, we\r\nthink that the comment, which in terms bears upon Costa Bros.'s\r\nrepeated refusals to rehire the appellants, sufficiently implicates\r\nthe decisional process to avoid classification as a stray remark. \r\nSee Wichmann v. Board of Trustees, 180 F.3d 791, 802 (7th Cir.\r\n1999), petition for cert. filed, 68 U.S.L.W. 3154 (U.S. Sept. 3,\r\n1999) (No. 99-411); Thomas, 131 F.3d at 204.\r\nIn the last analysis, however, this taxonomic triumph\r\nconstitutes a hollow victory for the appellants.  Despite the fact\r\nthat these statements cannot be brushed aside as stray remarks,\r\nthey are inherently ambiguous and, as such, do not directly reflect\r\nthe alleged animus.  The first   \"I don't need minorities and I\r\ndon't need residents on the job\"   may be interpreted either as an\r\nadmission of an exclusionary hiring practice (thus explicating the\r\ntrue reason for DaCosta's actions) or as a benign response to a\r\nspecific inquiry reflecting DaCosta's (erroneous) perception that\r\nhe no longer had to make special efforts to comply with EEO\r\nrequirements.  The second   \"I don't have to hire you locals or\r\nCape Verdean people\"   may be interpreted either as a\r\ndiscriminatory explanation for DaCosta's actions or as a response\r\nto what he perceived as an unjustified attempt to impose some sort\r\nof quota system upon his company.\r\nUnder any of the three views we have delineated, these\r\nstatements do not rise to the level of direct evidence.  Courts\r\nthat take the \"classic\" position have contrasted direct evidence\r\nwith, inter alia, ambiguous statements, and have indicated that the\r\nlatter will not suffice.  See Maldonado v. U.S. Bank, 186 F.3d 759,\r\n763 (7th Cir. 1999); Troupe, 20 F.3d at 736-37.  Courts that take\r\neither the \"animus plus\" or \"animus\" position place great emphasis\r\non the strength of the proof of discriminatory animus.  See, e.g.,\r\nFuller v. Phipps, 67 F.3d 1137, 1142-43 (4th Cir. 1995); Thomas,\r\n131 F.3d at 204; Fields v. New York State Office of Mental\r\nRetardation &amp; Developmental Disabilities, 115 F.3d 116, 122 (2d\r\nCir. 1997); Ostrowski, 968 F.2d at 182.  In our judgment,\r\ninherently ambiguous statements, without more, cannot supply the\r\nstrong evidence that these courts rightfully demand as a\r\nprerequisite to mixed-motive analysis.  We conclude, therefore,\r\nthat a statement that plausibly can be interpreted two different\r\nways   one discriminatory and the other benign   does not directly\r\nreflect illegal animus and, thus, does not constitute direct\r\nevidence.  See, e.g., Carter, 132 F.3d at 641 (\"We have held that\r\nstatements that are open to more than one interpretation do not\r\nconstitute direct evidence of racial discrimination.\"); Troupe, 20\r\nF.3d at 736-37 (similar).  Thus, DaCosta's statements do not serve\r\nto unlatch the door to the mixed-motive approach.\r\n                    C.  Pretext Analysis.\r\nHaving determined that the district court appropriately\r\nselected pretext analysis as the method of choice, we next examine\r\nthe court's execution of that analysis.  We again afford plenary\r\nreview.  See Conward, 171 F.3d at 18.\r\n1.  The Prima Facie Case.  Notwithstanding Costa Bros.'s\r\ntendency to conceptualize this appeal as a reduction-in-force case,\r\nthe appellants' complaint squarely alleges a discriminatory failure\r\nto rehire.  Because the appellants have not complained that the\r\nlayoff itself was discriminatory, the employer's focus on the\r\nelements of a prima facie reduction-in-force case is misplaced. \r\nThe proper focus is on failure to rehire, and the proper source for\r\nthe elements of a prima facie failure-to-rehire case is McDonnell\r\nDouglas itself.\r\nUnder that authority, a plaintiff alleging a failure to\r\nrehire establishes his prima facie case by showing:\r\n  (i) that he belongs to a racial minority; (ii)\r\nthat he applied and was qualified for a job\r\nfor which the employer was seeking applicants;\r\n(iii) that, despite his qualifications, he was\r\nrejected; and (iv) that, after his rejection,\r\nthe position remained open and the employer\r\ncontinued to seek applicants from persons of\r\ncomplainant's qualifications.\r\n\nMcDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802.  Contrary to Costa Bros.'s\r\ncontention, a plaintiff need not show as part of his prima facie\r\ncase that the employer either recalled similarly situated non-\r\nminority employees or otherwise treated employees of different\r\nethnic backgrounds more favorably.  See Perry v. Woodward, 188 F.3d\r\n1220, 1228-29 (10th Cir. 1999); Conward, 171 F.3d at 19-20; Walker\r\nv. Mortham, 158 F.3d 1177, 1179 n.2, 1186 (11th Cir. 1998), cert.\r\ndenied, 120 S. Ct. 39 (1999); Walker v. St. Anthony's Med. Ctr.,\r\n881 F.2d 554, 558 (8th Cir. 1989); see also Cumpiano, 902 F.2d at \r\n155 n.2.\r\nAgainst this benchmark, we conclude without serious\r\nquestion that the appellants established a prima facie case.  The\r\nfirst prong is uncontroversial; all three appellants are Cape\r\nVerdean and, as such, belong to a racial minority.  The second\r\nelement also falls easily into place:  all three performed\r\nsatisfactorily as masons prior to the layoff and plainly were\r\nqualified to do the work.\r\nTurning to the third facet of the prima facie case, the\r\nrecord establishes that all three appellants returned to the job\r\nsite at various times after the layoff and sought reinstatement. \r\nFor the most part, Costa Bros. rebuffed these efforts.  The sole\r\nexception   the time in March when DaCosta capitulated to external\r\npressure and hired Fernandes as a laborer, only to fire him on his\r\nsecond day of work   hardly suffices to tip the balance.  Cf.\r\nInternational Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324,\r\n341-42 (1977) (explaining that subsequent changes in corporate\r\n\"hiring and promotion policies . . . could not erase [the\r\ncompany's] previous illegal conduct or its obligation to afford\r\nrelief to those who suffered because of it\").  This is especially\r\nso since what transpired on that occasion plausibly can be\r\ninterpreted (drawing permissive inferences favorable to the\r\nappellants) as further evidence of DaCosta's discriminatory\r\ntreatment of Fernandes.  After all, DaCosta had resisted rehiring\r\nFernandes for several weeks and had to be persuaded to do so by a\r\ncivil rights advocate.  Moreover, Ceribelli   the Costa Bros.\r\nforeman   forewarned Fernandes that DaCosta would be \"on [his]\r\nback,\" and the sequence of events that followed reasonably could be\r\nseen as proof of the pudding.\r\nThe appellants also fulfilled the final prima facie case\r\nrequirement.  In the relevant time frame (December-January), Costa\r\nBros. had an ongoing need for masons on the Mashpee project, hiring\r\nand recalling many throughout the period.  For aught that appears,\r\nthe qualifications of the vast majority of these masons were much\r\nthe same as the appellants' qualifications.  No more is exigible. \r\nSee Conward, 171 F.3d at 19.\r\nCosta Bros.'s efforts to dispute this element of the\r\nprima facie case are unavailing.  In the district court, it\r\ncharacterized its hiring practices as \"simply react[ing] to men who\r\nappeared at the right place at the right time,\" and argued that it\r\nhad no need for additional help at the precise moments that the\r\nappellants inquired.  On this chiaroscuro record, a jury might so\r\nfind   but it also might find this to be a self-serving fiction.  \r\nIt may or may not be a coincidence that, of the nineteen\r\nmen whom DaCosta furloughed on December 7 and 8 (the three\r\nappellants, plus Choquette, George Medeiros, Spinola, William\r\nCeribelli, Juliao Fernandes, Victor Fernandez, Martirio Neto,\r\nAntonio Santo, Jose Silva, Artur Teles, Antonio DaSilva, Fernando\r\nDaSilva, Miguel Silva, Joseph Pimenthal, Jose Claudino, and Dinos\r\nMedeiros), all but five either were reassigned to another Costa\r\nBros. job or recalled in mid-December.  Likewise, it may or may\r\nnot be coincidental that four of the excluded five (the three\r\nappellants and Spinola) comprised the entire complement of minority\r\nemployees who had toiled on the Mashpee project.  Moreover, the\r\nfourteen men who were given an opportunity to work for Costa Bros.\r\neither at Mashpee or on another project in mid-December included\r\ntwo white masons (George Medeiros and William Ceribelli) and three\r\nwhite laborers (Joao Bolarinho, Fernando DaSilva, and Artur Teles)\r\nwho had been hired, and then furloughed, on approximately the same\r\ndates as the appellants.\r\nCosta Bros. attempts to blunt the force of this evidence\r\nin three ways.  First, it notes that George Medeiros, though\r\nrecalled, only worked for four days.  The fact remains, however,\r\nthat he was recalled and the appellants were not.  Second, Costa\r\nBros. points out that one member of the excluded group (Choquette)\r\nwas a white mason.  That is true as far as it goes   but it does\r\nnot go very far:  the record is devoid of evidence that Choquette\r\napplied for reinstatement at any time.  Third, Costa Bros. asserts\r\nthat it rehired Spinola in April 1996.  We think that this fact\r\npossesses only marginal relevance here, inasmuch as Spinola's\r\nrecall occurred well beyond the December-January period during\r\nwhich the appellants unsuccessfully sought reinstatement.\r\nIn addition to the fourteen rehires just discussed, the\r\nrecord indicates that Costa Bros. engaged a half-dozen new workers\r\nfor determinate positions during late December and January:  Carlos\r\nBolarinho (a laborer, hired on December 29); Piper (a mason, hired\r\non January 2); Winters (a mason, hired on January 10); Joaquim\r\nFernandes (a laborer, hired on January 18); Dan Cormier (a laborer,\r\nhired on January 22); and Luis Amaro (a laborer, hired on January\r\n23).  All were white.  Costa Bros. recruited four more white males\r\n(Antonio Reboca, Joao Soares, Michael Oliveira, and Steven Downey)\r\non various dates between January 5 and January 25.  Although these\r\nfour were assigned to work on the Mashpee project, we cannot\r\naccurately determine from the existing record which were masons and\r\nwhich were laborers.\r\nThese figures make the appellants' point emphatically. \r\nThey create an ample evidentiary platform for a finding that,\r\nduring the relevant two-month period, Costa Bros. sought applicants\r\npossessing qualifications similar to those of the appellants for\r\nopen positions.  Thus, the prima facie case was fully formed.\r\n2.  The Employer's Reason.  We proceed to the next step\r\nof the McDonnell Douglas pavane:  Costa Bros.'s professed reason\r\nfor failing to rehire the appellants.  In its response to a\r\ndiscovery request, Costa Bros. stated that it hired others in the\r\npertinent time frame because it \"needed masons or laborers and the\r\nindividuals [eventually hired] were available.\"  It also stated\r\nthat, apart from Piper and Winters, all the masons that it engaged\r\n\"were currently working or had worked for Costa Brothers.\"  The\r\nemployer glossed these statements in its summary judgment papers,\r\nmaintaining that it \"simply reacted to men who appeared at the\r\nright place at the right time and put them to work.\"\r\nAs to Piper and Winters, Costa Bros. makes situation-\r\nspecific arguments.  Piper,  it says, had special skills as a\r\nlayout man, and Winters was recommended by Victor Fernandez,\r\nanother Costa Bros. employee.\r\nWe assume, for argument's sake, that these reasons, in\r\nthe aggregate, constitute legitimate, nondiscriminatory grounds for\r\nhiring others in lieu of recalling the appellants.  Accordingly, we\r\nproceed to the third and final stage of the McDonnell Douglas\r\ninquiry.\r\n3.  Pretext for Discrimination.  Once the employer\r\narticulates a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for a challenged\r\nemployment decision, the plaintiff must be accorded a fair chance\r\nto show that the stated reason disguised a discriminatory animus. \r\nSee McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804; Pagano v. Frank, 983 F.2d\r\n343, 348 (1st Cir. 1993).  As long as the plaintiff offers evidence\r\nof pretext, the trial court must not accept the employer's\r\nproffered reason for the adverse employment action at face value,\r\nno matter how plausible it may sound, but must proceed to the final\r\nanalytic step.  See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804.  To that\r\nend, we review the summary judgment record.\r\nWe start with the employer's situation-specific reasons. \r\nThe lower court accepted without further inquiry Costa Bros.'s\r\nexplanations of why it hired Piper and Winters.  We are not so\r\nsanguine.\r\nThat said, we cannot fault the district court's ruling\r\nvis--vis Piper.  Costa Bros. asserts without contradiction that it\r\nneeded a layout man on the job and that none of the appellants\r\npossessed this particular skill.  If true, this rationale suffices\r\nto dispel any odor of unfair discrimination, see Hill v. Seaboard\r\nCoast Line R.R. Co., 767 F.2d 771, 774 (11th Cir. 1985), and the\r\nappellants neither contested the need for a layout man nor claimed\r\nto possess the requisite skill set.\r\nWinters's hiring is more problematic.  The district court\r\ncharacterized this event as cronyism, not discrimination (and\r\ntherefore lawful, though perhaps unsavory).  For this proposition,\r\nit relied upon our opinion in Foster v. Dalton, 71 F.3d 52 (1st\r\nCir. 1995).  Foster, however, cannot carry the weight that the\r\ndistrict court thrust upon it.\r\nIn Foster, the trial court concluded that cronyism, not\r\nrace discrimination, had prompted a hiring decision.  See id. at\r\n55.  We upheld that conclusion, ruling that \"in this case, cronyism\r\nprovides a sufficient alternative explanation\" for the decision. \r\nSee id. at 56.  Withal, the district court made its finding not on\r\nsummary judgment but after a bench trial.  See id. at 54-56.  The\r\nopinion does not stand for the proposition that a court, at the\r\nsummary judgment stage, may accept uncritically an employer's\r\narticulation of cronyism as an explanation for its actions. \r\nRather, the court must take the next step and determine, on whole-\r\nrecord review, if the evidence raises a genuine issue of material\r\nfact as to whether the proffered explanation is the real reason for\r\nthe employer's decision or, conversely, a pretext for\r\ndiscrimination.  See, e.g., Conward, 171 F.3d at 19; Mullin v.\r\nRaytheon Co., 164 F.3d 696, 699 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 120 S.\r\nCt. 44 (1999).\r\nAt any rate, the district court's error goes well beyond\r\nits failure to probe the facts surrounding Winters's enlistment. \r\nIn the circumstances of this case, the court should have cast the\r\nnet of its inquiry more widely and assessed all the recalls and\r\nhirings that had transpired during the months of December and\r\nJanuary.  See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804-05; Conward, 171\r\nF.3d at 20.\r\nCosta Bros. seems to concede that, in the usual case,\r\nthis would be the proper focus.  Nevertheless, it maintains that\r\nthe appellants directed the lower court's attention to Piper and\r\nWinters, and thus have waived the right to claim that the court\r\nshould have considered a broader array of hiring decisions.  We\r\nexamine this line of defense.\r\nIn fairness, the appellants did place heavy emphasis on\r\nthe arrival of Piper and Winters.  Yet, we cannot say that they did\r\nso to the exclusion of the broader comparative group.  The\r\nappellants' complaint alleges, without limitation, that on three\r\ndates in January 1996, \"the defendant hired other outside white\r\nemployees for the mason positions previously held by plaintiffs.\" \r\nThe appellants followed up on this averment in the course of\r\npretrial discovery; they sought the race and national origin of all\r\nemployees who were (a) laid off on December 7, 1995, and (b) hired\r\n(or rehired) thereafter.  When Costa Bros. moved for summary\r\njudgment, the appellants' opposition noted that \"[d]efendant also\r\nadmits that numerous employees [who] were white and/or Portuguese\r\nwere hired at the project as masons,\" thus conceptualizing the\r\ncomparative group as comprising more than merely Piper and Winters. \r\nThey also assailed the employer's contention that DaCosta had hired\r\nhis \"own men,\" positing that this was not a legitimate,\r\nnondiscriminatory reason for failing to recall the appellants\r\nbecause this group included no minorities.  Finally, at oral\r\nargument on the summary judgment motion, the appellants' counsel\r\nattempted to focus the court on the issue of pretext, urging that\r\nthe \"regular crew\" and \"special skills\" explanations \"weren't the\r\nreasons that [DaCosta] wasn't hiring minorities\"; that \"when [Rose]\r\nwent back to this site the place was full . . . and none of the\r\nfaces that he saw on the job site when he returned there were any\r\nemployees he had seen previously\"; and that \"the reasons given [by\r\nDaCosta] were false . . . . the whole place was re-employed and\r\n[Piper and Winters] weren't the only [new] people.\"\r\nIn sum, the appellants persistently attempted to refer\r\nthe district court to a larger comparative group.  The court, just\r\nas persistently, refused to countenance such a comparison.  Waivers\r\nare not lightly to be inferred, and in these circumstances, we are\r\nreluctant to deprive the appellants of their day in court. \r\nAlthough the question is not free from doubt, we conclude that the\r\nappellants adequately preserved the argument that the proper\r\ncomparative group consists of all workers recalled or hired during\r\nDecember and January.\r\nWe turn to this comparison.  Costa Bros. tries valiantly\r\nto head off a detailed inquiry by insisting that, in the relevant\r\nperiod, it hired only persons who had been part of its regular\r\ncomplement.  Without more, this professed policy cannot justify the\r\nentry of summary judgment.  Indeed, such a praxis   in DaCosta's\r\nphrase, the exclusionary use of \"my own men\"   cuts both ways. \r\nCommon sense teaches that when a work force is lily white (or\r\nnearly so), practices that have the effect of excluding outsiders\r\nmay serve to discriminate against minorities in a devastatingly\r\neffective manner.  Accordingly, the very existence of such a policy\r\nsometimes constitutes evidence of discrimination.  See, e.g., EEOC\r\nv. Steamship Clerks Union, Local 1066, 48 F.3d 594, 606 (1st Cir.\r\n1995); Thomas v. Washington County Sch. Bd., 915 F.2d 922, 925 (4th\r\nCir. 1990).  Given the contradictions and ambiguities that permeate\r\nthis record, the question of whether DaCosta's stated preference\r\nfor hiring \"my own men\" is a pretext for racial discrimination is\r\nfor the factfinder at trial, not for the judge on a Rule 56 motion.\r\nCosta Bros. also presses a \"same actor\" argument.  See\r\nLeBlanc v. Great Am. Ins. Co., 6 F.3d 836, 847 (1st Cir. 1993).  It\r\nobserves that Ceribelli hired Rose and Gilbert on the basis of\r\nfriendship and suggests that declining to rehire them based on\r\nracial animus makes no sense.  But it was DaCosta, not Ceribelli,\r\nwho rebuffed Rose and Gilbert when they applied for reinstatement. \r\nA jury rationally could conclude, therefore, that, in Ceribelli's\r\nown words, he had \"only hired a few minorities because of local\r\npressure,\" and that DaCosta   who owned the company   precluded any\r\nfurther minority hiring once that pressure subsided.\r\nHaving cut a passable swath through the tangle of\r\narguments advanced by the employer, we now focus on the adequacy of\r\nthe appellants' proof of pretext cum animus.  We previously\r\nconcluded that DaCosta's statements that (1) \"I don't need\r\nminorities, and I don't need residents on this job.  I got my men,\"\r\nand (2) \"I don't have to hire you locals or Cape Verdean people\"\r\nwere amenable to differing interpretations, one benign and one\r\ndiscriminatory.  See supra Part III(B).  Although this ambiguity\r\ndefeated the attempt to characterize the statements as direct\r\nevidence (and thus defeated the claim that the lower court erred in\r\nrefusing to engage in a mixed-motive analysis), see id., the\r\nquestion differs under pretext analysis.\r\nIn that mode, an inquiring court does not ask whether the\r\nplaintiff has adduced direct evidence of discrimination, but asks\r\ninstead whether the evidence presented, regardless of its\r\ncharacter, suffices to raise a genuine issue about the\r\npretextuality of the employer's explanation for the challenged\r\nemployment decision.  In the course of this latter exercise, the\r\ncourt, at the summary judgment stage, must interpret the evidence\r\nin the light most flattering to the nonmovant, resolving all\r\nambiguities in that party's favor.  See Conward, 171 F.3d at 18;\r\nPagano, 983 F.2d at 347.  Thus, the fact that DaCosta's comments\r\nwere susceptible to conflicting interpretations helps the\r\nappellants at this juncture.\r\nTo all intents and purposes, that ends the matter.  The\r\nevidence that we recounted in connection with the appellants' prima\r\nfacie case suffices to put the question of pretext into issue, and\r\nDaCosta's statements, taken in the light most favorable to the\r\nappellants, add the necessary element of racial animus.  See \r\nHodgens v. General Dynamics Corp., 144 F.3d 151, 171 (1st Cir.\r\n1998)(citing cases).  In other words, there is room on this record\r\nfor a rational factfinder to infer that Costa Bros.'s failure to\r\nrecall the appellants was motivated by a proscribed racial animus\r\nrather than by random availability of workers or loyalty to members\r\nof its regular crew.\r\nIf more were needed   and we doubt that it is   the\r\nrecord is replete with other evidence that points to the same\r\nconclusion.  For instance, Ceribelli, when asked why minority\r\nworkers had not been recalled, responded that Costa Bros. \"had only\r\nhired a few minorities because of local pressure.\"  In the same\r\nvein, DaCosta's repeated allusions to \"you guys\" and terms of like\r\ntenor reinforce the inference of racial animus.  Then, too, the\r\ncircumstances surrounding Fernandes's abortive return to work lend\r\nfurther support.\r\nWe glean another relevant item of proof from George\r\nMedeiros's affidavit.  Medeiros, a white mason, had been laid off\r\nalong with the appellants on December 7.  Later that month, he\r\ninquired about reinstatement.  According to Medeiros:\r\n  Mr. Ceribelli told me to call Domingos DaCosta\r\nat the company office, and inform him that I\r\nam looking for work as a bricklayer and mason,\r\nand specifically inform him that I am a\r\nMashpee resident and am white.  I did what Mr.\r\nCeribelli asked me to, and the next day\r\n[December 15] was hired to work on the Mashpee\r\nHigh School Project.\r\n\n(Emphasis supplied.)\r\nAlthough the appellants do not choose to catalog this statement as\r\ndirect evidence of racial discrimination   a choice on which we\r\ntake no view   we believe that it speaks volumes in a pretext\r\nanalysis.  We realize that a factfinder will have to pass upon\r\nMedeiros's credibility, but that is precisely the point.  The\r\nevidence, taken as a whole, creates a genuine issue of material\r\nfact as to whether Costa Bros.'s explanations are canards, designed\r\nto mask a discriminatory animus.\r\n                   D.  The State-Law Claim.\r\nWe need not separately discuss the merits of the\r\nappellants' state-law claim.  The McDonnell Douglas framework\r\napplies to disparate treatment claims brought under Chapter 151B,\r\nbut the appellants' burden is somewhat lighter in one respect. \r\n\"While federal law requires a showing of pretext plus [racial]\r\nanimus, the Massachusetts courts appear, at the third step of the\r\npavane, to require a claimant to show only pretext.\"  Mullin, 164\r\nF.3d at 699 (citing Blare v. Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston,\r\nInc., 646 N.E.2d 111, 116-17 (Mass. 1995)).  We already have\r\nconcluded that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether\r\nCosta Bros.'s stated reasons for its actions are a pretext for\r\ndiscrimination.  See supra Part III(C).  A fortiori, we must reach\r\nthe same conclusion with respect to the appellants' state-law\r\nclaim.  See Brennan v. GTE Gov't Sys. Corp., 150 F.3d 21, 26-27\r\n(1st Cir. 1998).\r\nIV.  CONCLUSION\r\nWe need go no further.  In the circumstances of this\r\ncase, sufficient evidence exists to permit a rational finder of\r\nfact to infer that the employer's articulated reasons for not\r\nrehiring the appellants are merely a coverup for racial\r\ndiscrimination.  Consequently, we vacate the order granting summary\r\njudgment and remand for further proceedings consistent herewith.\r\n\nVacated and remanded.  Costs to appellants.\n",

Bushey, with whom Michael A. Feinberg and Feinberg, Charnas &amp; Birmingham, P.C. were on brief, for appellants.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Richard W. Gleeson, with whom Gleeson &amp; Corcoran was on brief, for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before Selya, Circuit Judge, Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge, and Stahl, Circuit Judge.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SELYA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henry John Fernandes, Richard H. Gilbert, and Benjamin G. Rose, all dark-skinned Cape Verdeans,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> sued their quondam employer, Costa Brothers Masonry, Inc. (Costa Bros.), alleging a discriminatory failure to rehire. They now appeal from an order granting summary judgment against them. Their appeal requires us to explore how courts charged with resolving discrimination cases should choose between pretext analysis (an approach first limned in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973)) and mixed-motive analysis (an alternative approach limned later in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228 (1989) (plurality opinion)). We conclude, as did the district court, that the evidence thus far adduced does not trigger mixed-motive analysis. We also conclude, however, that under a properly performed pretext analysis, the appellants' case should have survived. Consequently, we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. THE FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the summary judgment standard demands, we take the facts in the light most hospitable to the appellants, indulging all reasonable inferences in their favor. See Conward v. Cambridge Sch. Comm., 171 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 1999). Mindful of this coign of vantage, we deliberately omit from our narrative versions of certain conversations and events that conflict with the appellants' accounts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1995, Stone Building Company secured a contract to construct a new high school in Mashpee, Massachusetts. It engaged Costa Bros. as the masonry subcontractor. Because the job was publicly funded, contractors and subcontractors were told that they had to conform to specific equal employment opportunity (EEO) rules and to issue weekly EEO summaries documenting the number of hours worked by minority employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A Portuguese immigrant, Domingos DaCosta, owns Costa Bros. On November 13, 1995, he retained Sebastian Ceribelli, a Brazilian, as the masonry foreman for the Mashpee project. DaCosta and Ceribelli then hired a number of masons and laborers to work on the job. Those engaged on November 27 included five masons -- the appellants and two white males, George Choquette and George Medeiros -- and a dark-skinned Cape Verdean laborer, Glenn Spinola. These six men worked as a team until December 7, when Ceribelli laid off all six due to winter weather conditions and lack of heat in the workplace. He vowed that he would recall them when the heating quandary had been solved. Other workers were laid off at roughly the same time (although some, unlike the appellants, were assigned to ongoing Costa Bros. projects elsewhere).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about December 13, Costa Bros. resumed work on the Mashpee project. It recalled some masons (but not the appellants). Gilbert visited the job site the following week and asked Ceribelli when he would be rehired. Ceribelli responded, \"The way things are going now . . . I wouldn't count on it.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rose sojourned to the site the next Saturday. He noticed masons working there and queried DaCosta about this circumstance. DaCosta replied, \"We're doing a little fixing up here.\" Rose then asked, \"Are we going to get called back?\" DaCosta responded, \"We're going to close in\" -- a comment that Rose reasonably took to mean that the building would be enclosed in order to create a heated space in which masons could work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having heard nothing further, Rose checked back two weeks later. He saw that the job site was fully heated and asked DaCosta, \"Aren't we coming back?\" DaCosta replied cryptically, \"Well, I got my men.\" When Rose inquired about what had happened to the plan to recruit residents and minorities, DaCosta stated, \"I don't need minorities, and I don't need no residents on this job. I got my men.\" Rose complained that DaCosta had \"twelve new faces\" working on the project, but DaCosta abruptly terminated the conversation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In point of fact, Costa Bros. recalled a total of eighteen workmen (masons and laborers) between December 13 and January 25, and hired ten new ones in that span (none of whom had worked previously for Costa Bros.). All twenty-eight were white males.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fernandes returned to the job site on numerous occasions in December and January. Each time, DaCosta told him that there was no work available but to come back again. After several weeks, Fernandes asked Ceribelli why he and the other Cape Verdeans had not been recalled. Ceribelli replied that Costa Bros. \"had only hired a few minorities because of local pressure.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 30, DaCosta, James Byrne (the clerk of the works), and a representative of the general contractor met with Fernandes, Raoul Galvin (a civil rights activist), and others from the local community regarding Costa Bros.'s compliance with EEO requirements. Galvin noted that Costa Bros. had hired more workers, all of whom were white, but that it had no minorities working at the site. He implored DaCosta to rehire Fernandes because \"whatever was going on at the time would stop if he at least put one of [the Cape Verdeans] back to work.\" DaCosta indicated that he would honor this request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fernandes reported for duty the following Monday but was informed that there was no work available. This experience was repeated several times. Costa Bros. finally restored Fernandes to the payroll on March 26, albeit as a laborer rather than as a mason. On the same day, Ceribelli warned him to \"watch out\" because DaCosta was \"going to be on [his] back.\" This prediction proved prophetic: according to Fernandes, DaCosta \"followed [him] around,\" constantly \"hollering and screaming\" at him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Fernandes reported for work the next morning, DaCosta instructed him to get an \"F block\" (or so he thought). Fernandes was unsure what an \"F block\" was and asked DaCosta (who, as matters turned out, had wanted a standard \"half block\"). After castigating Fernandes for his ignorance, DaCosta declared that he was \"tired of . . . what's going on between you guys,\" and voiced the opinion that \"[y]ou guys are trying to hurt me.\" He then proclaimed: \"I don't have to hire you locals or Cape Verdean people. This is my business. It belongs to me.\" At that juncture, DaCosta fired Fernandes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. TRAVEL OF THE CASE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After pursuing administrative remedies, see 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(e); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &#167; 5, the appellants sued. In their complaint, they alleged discrimination on the basis of race and color in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2000e to 2000e-17, and its state-law analogue, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &#167; 4(1). Costa Bros. denied the material allegations of the complaint, and the parties spent the next year conducting pretrial discovery. From the record and the briefs, it appears that the appellants' original claim was constructively amended to include discrimination predicated on national origin, and the case went forward on that assumption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, Costa Bros. moved for summary judgment, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, and the appellants filed an opposition. The district court heard oral argument, took the matter under advisement, and thereafter granted the motion as to all claims. In its unpublished rescript, the court characterized DaCosta's statement that \"I don't need minorities . . . on this job\" as a stray remark, insufficient to trigger mixed-motive analysis. Although the court catalogued DaCosta's comment that \"I don't have to hire you locals or Cape Verdean people\" in its recitation of the facts, it did not mention this comment thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Undertaking pretext analysis, the court focused on two white masons who had been hired in January 1996 -- Piper and Winters. The court ruled that the Piper hiring did not assist the appellants because Piper had special skills and they could not establish that their qualifications were equivalent to his. As to Winters, the court accepted Costa Bros.'s explanation that it had hired him on the recommendation of another employee, characterizing what had happened as cronyism rather than discrimination. The court never discussed whether the record sufficed to support a finding that this explanation was pretextual, nor did it explore the numerous other employment decisions that Costa Bros. made in the December-January time frame. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants asseverate that the district court erred in choosing a legal framework and that, even if the court marched down an acceptable analytic path, it did not stay on track. We consider these arguments in sequence, pausing first to frame the choice-of-approach issue. We then briefly address the appellants' state-law claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The Available Analytic Methods.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plaintiff alleging disparate treatment under Title VII may proceed on a mixed-motive approach or on a pretext approach. For purposes of this case, it is important to understand the basic difference between these two modalities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mixed-motive analysis applies when the evidence shows that an employer considered both a proscribed factor (say, race) and one or more legitimate factors (say, competence) in making a challenged employment decision. See Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 241-42. In that scenario, the plaintiff is not obliged to separate out the relative import of each element that went into the decision; rather, once the plaintiff proves that a proscribed factor \"played a motivating part\" in the decision, the burden of persuasion shifts to the employer, who will be held liable for damages under Title VII unless \"it can prove that, even if it had not taken [the proscribed factor] into account, it would have come to the same decision regarding [the plaintiff].\" Id. at 242, 244. Even then, because Congress has reshaped mixed-motive analysis in certain respects, the employee may be entitled to equitable relief so long as he has proven that the proscribed factor played some part in the decisional calculus. See 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2000e-2(m); 2000e-5(g)(2)(B); see also Higgins v. New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc., 194 F.3d 252, 259 n.3 (1st Cir. 1999); Carey v. Mt. Desert Island Hosp., 156 F.3d 31, 43-44 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is readily apparent that this mixed-motive approach, uncabined, has the potential to swallow whole the traditional McDonnell Douglas analysis. To guard against this possibility, the Court restricted its applicability to those infrequent cases in which a plaintiff can demonstrate with a high degree of assurance that the employment decision of which he complains \"was the product of a mixture of legitimate and illegitimate motives.\" Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 247. Under this formulation, access to the mixed-motive approach ultimately depends on the quality of the available evidence. Most courts agree that Justice O'Connor's seminal concurrence in Price Waterhouse furnishes the best device for testing quality (and, thus, the best roadmap for segregating mixed-motive cases from the mine-run of discrimination cases). After all, when the Supreme Court rules by means of a plurality opinion (as was true in Price Waterhouse), inferior courts should give effect to the narrowest ground upon which a majority of the Justices supporting the judgment would agree. See Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 193 (1977). The O'Connor concurrence fits this profile. Hence, we turn to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"What is required [to trigger mixed-motive analysis] is . . . direct evidence that decisionmakers placed substantial negative reliance on an illegitimate criterion in reaching their decision.\" Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 277 (O'Connor, J., concurring). Because discrimination tends more and more to operate in subtle ways, direct evidence is relatively rare; when it comes to light, however, a plaintiff can use it to demonstrate \"that an illegitimate factor played a substantial role in a particular employment decision.\" Id. at 275. It follows that plaintiffs may use the Price Waterhouse mechanism in disparate treatment cases in which they adduce direct evidence of a discriminatory animus, whereas they must proceed under the conventional McDonnell Douglas framework (commonly called \"pretext analysis\") in all other cases. See Ayala-Gerena v. Bristol Myers-Squibb Co., 95 F.3d 86, 95 (1st Cir. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the pretext method, the plaintiff first must establish a prima facie case. See Texas Dep't of Comm'y Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 252-53 (1981); McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. We shall return to the components of the prima facie case; for now, it suffices to say that this requirement is \"not onerous.\" Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253. If the plaintiff clears this modest hurdle, the burden of production -- but not the burden of persuasion -- shifts to the employer, who must articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. See St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506-07 (1993); Burdine, 450 U.S. at 254-55. Once that occurs, the plaintiff must show both that the employer's \"proffered reason is a sham, and that discriminatory animus sparked [its] actions.\" Conward, 171 F.3d at 19. To this end, the full panoply of circumstantial evidence is available, including but not limited to \"statistical evidence showing disparate treatment by the employer of members of the protected class, comments by decisionmakers which denigrate [persons in the protected group], the incidence of differential treatment in the workplace, and the deployment of . . . replacements.\" Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 824 (1st Cir. 1991) (citations omitted). The totality of the evidence then is examined \"as part of an aggregate package of proof.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plaintiff, uncertain of what discovery will yield or how a judge will react to certain proffers, may elect to proceed simultaneously on both fronts (mixed-motive and pretext), cognizant that the trial court, at an appropriate stage of the litigation, will channel the case into one format or the other. See Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 247 n.12; Thomas v. National Football League Players Ass'n, 131 F.3d 198, 202 (D.C. Cir. 1997). Consistent with the O'Connor concurrence, the court typically will make that determination based on the availability or unavailability of direct evidence. See Taylor v. Virginia Union Univ., 193 F.3d 219, 232 (4th Cir. 1999) (en banc); Ostrowski v. Atlantic Mut. Ins. Cos., 968 F.2d 171, 181-82 (2d Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This ruling can have important effects on the outcome of the litigation. In a mixed-motive analysis, \"the burden of persuasion shifts from the employee to the employer, who must then affirmatively prove that it would have made the same decision even if it had not taken the protected characteristic into account.\" Ayala-Gerena, 95 F.3d at 95-96; accord Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 246 (explaining that, under a mixed-motive analysis, \"the plaintiff must persuade the factfinder on one point, and then the employer, if it wishes to prevail, must persuade it on another\"). This contrasts vividly with pretext analysis, under which the employee retains the burden of persuasion throughout. See Cumpiano v. Banco Santander P.R., 902 F.2d 148, 153 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Mixed-Motive Analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With this preface, we turn to the appellants' contention that the lower court erred in eschewing a mixed-motive analysis. Because this case comes to us on appeal from an order granting brevis disposition, we afford de novo review. See Conward, 171 F.3d at 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As our earlier discussion indicates, direct evidence is the touchstone for mixed-motive analysis. Hence, the fate of the appellants' present contention hinges on whether they adduced direct evidence of Costa Bros.'s use of a proscribed factor (race, color, and/or national origin) in the decisional process. Answering that question is more difficult than might appear at first blush. To be sure, Justice O'Connor furnished a trenchant, universally accepted example of what is not direct evidence: stray remarks, such as \"statements by nondecisionmakers, or statements by decisionmakers unrelated to the decisional process itself.\" Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 277 (O'Connor, J., concurring). Since then, however, jurists have struggled in attempting to define the term affirmatively. This operose task not only has divided the courts of appeals but also has created a patchwork of intra-circuit conflicts. Generally speaking, three schools of thought have emerged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The \"Classic\" Position. Some courts adopt the traditional definition of \"direct evidence\" for this purpose, holding that the term signifies evidence which, if believed, suffices to prove the fact of discriminatory animus without inference, presumption, or resort to other evidence. See, e.g., Shorter v. ICG Holdings, Inc., 188 F.3d 1204, 1207 (10th Cir. 1999); Haas v. Advo Sys., Inc., 168 F.3d 732, 734 n.2 (5th Cir. 1999); EEOC v. Wiltel, Inc., 81 F.3d 1508, 1514 (10th Cir. 1996); Nichols v. Loral Vought Sys. Corp., 81 F.3d 38, 40 (5th Cir. 1996). Although only the Fifth and Tenth Circuits cling consistently to this view, other tribunals have embraced it periodically. See, e.g., Carter v. Three Springs Resid'l Treatment, 132 F.3d 635, 641 (11th Cir. 1998); Troupe v. May Dep't Stores Co., 20 F.3d 734, 736 (7th Cir. 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The \"Animus Plus\" Position.  The Fourth Circuit, sitting en banc, recently defined \"direct evidence\" for this purpose as evidence, both direct and circumstantial, of conduct or statements that (1) reflect directly the alleged discriminatory animus and (2) bear squarely on the contested employment decision. See Taylor, 193 F.3d at 232. The D.C. Circuit takes the same view. See Thomas, 131 F.3d at 204. The Ninth Circuit seems headed in this direction. See Lambert v. Ackerley, 180 F.3d 997, 1008-09 (9th Cir. 1999) (en banc), petition for cert. denied, ___U.S.___,120 S.Ct. 936, (U.S. 1999). The Third Circuit at one time was in the \"animus plus\" camp, see Walden v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., 126 F.3d 506, 513 (3d Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 1516 (1998), but that court is poised to revisit the question. See Hankins v. City of Philadelphia, 189 F.3d 353 (3d Cir. 1999), rehearing en banc granted, opinion vacated, 188 F.3d 217 (3d Cir. 1999). Two other courts of appeals have indicated occasional approval of this approach, see, e.g., Sheehan v. Donlen Corp., 173 F.3d 1039, 1044 (7th Cir. 1999); Deneen v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 132 F.3d 431, 436 (8th Cir. 1998), but as the cases cited herein indicate, both of these courts have flirted with other formulations. Courts endorsing the animus plus position do not distinguish between direct and circumstantial evidence in the classic sense but, rather, emphasize that the mixed-motive trigger depends on the strength of the plaintiff's case. See, e.g., Kubicko v. Ogden Logistics Servs., 181 F.3d 544, 553 (4th Cir. 1999) (emphasizing that whether a case falls under the mixed-motive or pretext rubric \"ultimately hinges on the strength of the evidence establishing discrimination\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); Thomas, 131 F.3d at 204 (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. The \"Animus\" Position. A few courts resolve the direct evidence conundrum by the simple expedient of deleting the \"plus\" from the \"animus plus\" formulation. Those courts opine that as long as the evidence (whether direct or circumstantial) is tied to the alleged discriminatory animus, it need not bear squarely on the challenged employment decision. The Second Circuit advocates this position. See, e.g., Lightfoot v. Union Carbide Corp., 110 F.3d 898, 913 (2d Cir. 1997); Ostrowski, 968 F.2d at 182. The Eighth Circuit intermittently takes this stance, see, e.g., Kerns v. Capital Graphics, Inc., 178 F.3d 1011, 1017-18 (8th Cir. 1999); Radabaugh v. Zip Feed Mills, Inc., 997 F.2d 444, 449 (8th Cir. 1993), and two other cases appear to fit somewhat loosely into this category, see Wright v. Southland Corp., 187 F.3d 1287, 1303-04 (11th Cir. 1999); Hennessy v. Penril Datacomm Networks, Inc., 69 F.3d 1344, 1348-50 (7th Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. The First Circuit's Position. To complete our survey of the legal landscape, we direct our gaze inward. Although we have dropped inconclusive hints here and there, see, e.g., Ayala-Gerena, 95 F.3d at 95-96; Smith v. F.W. Morse &amp; Co., 76 F.3d 413, 421 (1st Cir. 1996), we have yet to choose among these conflicting approaches. Thus, the question is wide open in this circuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. The Case at Hand. This case does not require us to fill the void, and we decline to do so gratuitously. The appellants contend that two comments attributed to DaCosta -- \"I don't need minorities, and I don't need residents on this job\" and \"I don't have to hire you locals or Cape Verdean people\" -- constitute direct evidence that a proscribed factor influenced Costa Bros.'s hiring practices. The employer demurs, asserting that these are merely \"stray remarks\" and, in all events, lack sufficient probative force to constitute direct evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not share the view that DaCosta's statements must be classified as stray remarks. As we have pointed out, DaCosta was the ultimate decisionmaker, and both pronouncements pertained to the decisional process. He made the first statement when refusing to rehire Rose; because it bore directly on a challenged employment decision, it hardly qualifies as a stray remark. See, e.g., Deneen, 132 F.3d at 436; Diaz-Gandia v. Dapena-Thompson, 90 F.3d 609, 616 (1st Cir. 1996). DaCosta uttered the second statement when cashiering Fernandez and, although this suit does not challenge Fernandes's dismissal per se, see infra note 3, we think that the comment, which in terms bears upon Costa Bros.'s repeated refusals to rehire the appellants, sufficiently implicates the decisional process to avoid classification as a stray remark. See Wichmann v. Board of Trustees, 180 F.3d 791, 802 (7th Cir. 1999), granted, judgement vacated by, (U.S. 1999); Thomas, 131 F.3d at 204.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the last analysis, however, this taxonomic triumph constitutes a hollow victory for the appellants. Despite the fact that these statements cannot be brushed aside as stray remarks, they are inherently ambiguous and, as such, do not directly reflect the alleged animus. The first -- \"I don't need minorities and I don't need residents on the job\" -- may be interpreted either as an admission of an exclusionary hiring practice (thus explicating the true reason for DaCosta's actions) or as a benign response to a specific inquiry reflecting DaCosta's (erroneous) perception that he no longer had to make special efforts to comply with EEO requirements. The second -- \"I don't have to hire you locals or Cape Verdean people\" -- may be interpreted either as a discriminatory explanation for DaCosta's actions or as a response to what he perceived as an unjustified attempt to impose some sort of quota system upon his company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under any of the three views we have delineated, these statements do not rise to the level of direct evidence. Courts that take the \"classic\" position have contrasted direct evidence with, inter alia, ambiguous statements, and have indicated that the latter will not suffice. See Maldonado v. U.S. Bank, 186 F.3d 759, 763 (7th Cir. 1999); Troupe, 20 F.3d at 736-37. Courts that take either the \"animus plus\" or \"animus\" position place great emphasis on the strength of the proof of discriminatory animus. See, e.g., Fuller v. Phipps, 67 F.3d 1137, 1142-43 (4th Cir. 1995); Thomas, 131 F.3d at 204; Fields v. New York State Office of Mental Retardation &amp; Developmental Disabilities, 115 F.3d 116, 122 (2d Cir. 1997); Ostrowski, 968 F.2d at 182. In our judgment, inherently ambiguous statements, without more, cannot supply the strong evidence that these courts rightfully demand as a prerequisite to mixed-motive analysis. We conclude, therefore, that a statement that plausibly can be interpreted two different ways -- one discriminatory and the other benign -- does not directly reflect illegal animus and, thus, does not constitute direct evidence. See, e.g., Carter, 132 F.3d at 641 (\"We have held that statements that are open to more than one interpretation do not constitute direct evidence of racial discrimination.\"); Troupe, 20 F.3d at 736-37 (similar). Thus, DaCosta's statements do not serve to unlatch the door to the mixed-motive approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Pretext Analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that the district court appropriately selected pretext analysis as the method of choice, we next examine the court's execution of that analysis.

The Prima Facie Case. Notwithstanding Costa Bros.'s tendency to conceptualize this appeal as a reduction-in-force case, the appellants' complaint squarely alleges a discriminatory failure to rehire. Because the appellants have not complained that the layoff itself was discriminatory, the employer's focus on the elements of a prima facie reduction-in-force case is misplaced.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The proper focus is on failure to rehire, and the proper source for the elements of a prima facie failure-to-rehire case is McDonnell Douglas itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under that authority, a plaintiff alleging a failure to rehire establishes his prima facie case by showing:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) that he belongs to a racial minority; (ii) that he applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants; (iii) that, despite his qualifications, he was rejected; and (iv) that, after his rejection, the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of complainant's qualifications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. Contrary to Costa Bros.'s contention, a plaintiff need not show as part of his prima facie case that the employer either recalled similarly situated non-minority employees or otherwise treated employees of different ethnic backgrounds more favorably. See Perry v. Woodward, 188 F.3d 1220, 1228-29 (10th Cir. 1999); Conward, 171 F.3d at 19-20; Walker v. Mortham, 158 F.3d 1177, 1179 n.2, 1186 (11th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 39 (1999); Walker v. St. Anthony's Med. Ctr., 881 F.2d 554, 558 (8th Cir. 1989); see also Cumpiano, 902 F.2d at 155 n.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this benchmark, we conclude without serious question that the appellants established a prima facie case. The first prong is uncontroversial; all three appellants are Cape Verdean and, as such, belong to a racial minority. The second element also falls easily into place: all three performed satisfactorily as masons prior to the layoff and plainly were qualified to do the work.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the third facet of the prima facie case, the record establishes that all three appellants returned to the job site at various times after the layoff and sought reinstatement. For the most part, Costa Bros. rebuffed these efforts. The sole exception -- the time in March when DaCosta capitulated to external pressure and hired Fernandes as a laborer, only to fire him on his second day of work -- hardly suffices to tip the balance. Cf. International Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 341-42 (1977) (explaining that subsequent changes in corporate \"hiring and promotion policies . . . could not erase [the company's] previous illegal conduct or its obligation to afford relief to those who suffered because of it\"). This is especially so since what transpired on that occasion plausibly can be interpreted (drawing permissive inferences favorable to the appellants) as further evidence of DaCosta's discriminatory treatment of Fernandes. After all, DaCosta had resisted rehiring Fernandes for several weeks and had to be persuaded to do so by a civil rights advocate. Moreover, Ceribelli -- the Costa Bros. foreman -- forewarned Fernandes that DaCosta would be \"on [his] back,\" and the sequence of events that followed reasonably could be seen as proof of the pudding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants also fulfilled the final prima facie case requirement. In the relevant time frame (December-January), Costa Bros. had an ongoing need for masons on the Mashpee project, hiring and recalling many throughout the period. For aught that appears, the qualifications of the vast majority of these masons were much the same as the appellants' qualifications. No more is exigible. See Conward, 171 F.3d at 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Costa Bros.'s efforts to dispute this element of the prima facie case are unavailing. In the district court, it characterized its hiring practices as \"simply react[ing] to men who appeared at the right place at the right time,\" and argued that it had no need for additional help at the precise moments that the appellants inquired. On this chiaroscuro record, a jury might so find -- but it also might find this to be a self-serving fiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It may or may not be a coincidence that, of the nineteen men whom DaCosta furloughed on December 7 and 8 (the three appellants, plus Choquette, George Medeiros, Spinola, William Ceribelli, Juliao Fernandes, Victor Fernandez, Martirio Neto, Antonio Santo, Jose Silva, Artur Teles, Antonio DaSilva, Fernando DaSilva, Miguel Silva, Joseph Pimenthal, Jose Claudino, and Dinos Medeiros), all but five either were reassigned to another Costa Bros. job or recalled in mid-December.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Likewise, it may or may not be coincidental that four of the excluded five (the three appellants and Spinola) comprised the entire complement of minority employees who had toiled on the Mashpee project. Moreover, the fourteen men who were given an opportunity to work for Costa Bros. either at Mashpee or on another project in mid-December included two white masons (George Medeiros and William Ceribelli) and three white laborers (Joao Bolarinho, Fernando DaSilva, and Artur Teles) who had been hired, and then furloughed, on approximately the same dates as the appellants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Costa Bros. attempts to blunt the force of this evidence in three ways. First, it notes that George Medeiros, though recalled, only worked for four days. The fact remains, however, that he was recalled and the appellants were not. Second, Costa Bros. points out that one member of the excluded group (Choquette) was a white mason. That is true as far as it goes -- but it does not go very far: the record is devoid of evidence that Choquette applied for reinstatement at any time. Third, Costa Bros. asserts that it rehired Spinola in April 1996. We think that this fact possesses only marginal relevance here, inasmuch as Spinola's recall occurred well beyond the December-January period during which the appellants unsuccessfully sought reinstatement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the fourteen rehires just discussed, the record indicates that Costa Bros. engaged a half-dozen new workers for determinate positions during late December and January: Carlos Bolarinho (a laborer, hired on December 29); Piper (a mason, hired on January 2); Winters (a mason, hired on January 10); Joaquim Fernandes (a laborer, hired on January 18); Dan Cormier (a laborer, hired on January 22); and Luis Amaro (a laborer, hired on January 23). All were white. Costa Bros. recruited four more white males (Antonio Reboca, Joao Soares, Michael Oliveira, and Steven Downey) on various dates between January 5 and January 25. Although these four were assigned to work on the Mashpee project, we cannot accurately determine from the existing record which were masons and which were laborers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These figures make the appellants' point emphatically. They create an ample evidentiary platform for a finding that, during the relevant two-month period, Costa Bros. sought applicants possessing qualifications similar to those of the appellants for open positions. Thus, the prima facie case was fully formed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The Employer's Reason. We proceed to the next step of the McDonnell Douglas pavane: Costa Bros.'s professed reason for failing to rehire the appellants. In its response to a discovery request, Costa Bros. stated that it hired others in the pertinent time frame because it \"needed masons or laborers and the individuals [eventually hired] were available.\" It also stated that, apart from Piper and Winters, all the masons that it engaged \"were currently working or had worked for Costa Brothers.\" The employer glossed these statements in its summary judgment papers, maintaining that it \"simply reacted to men who appeared at the right place at the right time and put them to work.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Piper and Winters, Costa Bros. makes situation-specific arguments. Piper, it says, had special skills as a layout man, and Winters was recommended by Victor Fernandez, another Costa Bros. employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We assume, for argument's sake, that these reasons, in the aggregate, constitute legitimate, nondiscriminatory grounds for hiring others in lieu of recalling the appellants. Accordingly, we proceed to the third and final stage of the McDonnell Douglas inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Pretext for Discrimination. Once the employer articulates a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for a challenged employment decision, the plaintiff must be accorded a fair chance to show that the stated reason disguised a discriminatory animus. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804; Pagano v. Frank, 983 F.2d 343, 348 (1st Cir. 1993). As long as the plaintiff offers evidence of pretext, the trial court must not accept the employer's proffered reason for the adverse employment action at face value, no matter how plausible it may sound, but must proceed to the final analytic step. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804. To that end, we review the summary judgment record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the employer's situation-specific reasons. The lower court accepted without further inquiry Costa Bros.'s explanations of why it hired Piper and Winters. We are not so sanguine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That said, we cannot fault the district court's ruling vis-a-vis Piper. Costa Bros. asserts without contradiction that it needed a layout man on the job and that none of the appellants possessed this particular skill. If true, this rationale suffices to dispel any odor of unfair discrimination, see Hill v. Seaboard Coast Line R.R. Co., 767 F.2d 771, 774 (11th Cir. 1985), and the appellants neither contested the need for a layout man nor claimed to possess the requisite skill set.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Winters's hiring is more problematic. The district court characterized this event as cronyism, not discrimination (and therefore lawful, though perhaps unsavory). For this proposition, it relied upon our opinion in Foster v. Dalton, 71 F.3d 52 (1st Cir. 1995). Foster, however, cannot carry the weight that the district court thrust upon it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Foster, the trial court concluded that cronyism, not race discrimination, had prompted a hiring decision. See id. at 55. We upheld that conclusion, ruling that \"in this case, cronyism provides a sufficient alternative explanation\" for the decision. See id. at 56. Withal, the district court made its finding not on summary judgment but after a bench trial. See id. at 54-56. The opinion does not stand for the proposition that a court, at the summary judgment stage, may accept uncritically an employer's articulation of cronyism as an explanation for its actions. Rather, the court must take the next step and determine, on whole-record review, if the evidence raises a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the proffered explanation is the real reason for the employer's decision or, conversely, a pretext for discrimination. See, e.g., Conward, 171 F.3d at 19; Mullin v. Raytheon Co., 164 F.3d 696, 699 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 44 (1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At any rate, the district court's error goes well beyond its failure to probe the facts surrounding Winters's enlistment. In the circumstances of this case, the court should have cast the net of its inquiry more widely and assessed all the recalls and hirings that had transpired during the months of December and January. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804-05; Conward, 171 F.3d at 20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Costa Bros. seems to concede that, in the usual case, this would be the proper focus. Nevertheless, it maintains that the appellants directed the lower court's attention to Piper and Winters, and thus have waived the right to claim that the court should have considered a broader array of hiring decisions. We examine this line of defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fairness, the appellants did place heavy emphasis on the arrival of Piper and Winters. Yet, we cannot say that they did so to the exclusion of the broader comparative group. The appellants' complaint alleges, without limitation, that on three dates in January 1996, \"the defendant hired other outside white employees for the mason positions previously held by plaintiffs.\" The appellants followed up on this averment in the course of pretrial discovery; they sought the race and national origin of all employees who were (a) laid off on December 7, 1995, and (b) hired (or rehired) thereafter. When Costa Bros. moved for summary judgment, the appellants' opposition noted that \"[d]efendant also admits that numerous employees [who] were white and/or Portuguese were hired at the project as masons,\" thus conceptualizing the comparative group as comprising more than merely Piper and Winters. They also assailed the employer's contention that DaCosta had hired his \"own men,\" positing that this was not a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for failing to recall the appellants because this group included no minorities. Finally, at oral argument on the summary judgment motion, the appellants' counsel attempted to focus the court on the issue of pretext, urging that the \"regular crew\" and \"special skills\" explanations \"weren't the reasons that [DaCosta] wasn't hiring minorities\"; that \"when [Rose] went back to this site the place was full . . . and none of the faces that he saw on the job site when he returned there were any employees he had seen previously\"; and that \"the reasons given [by DaCosta] were false . . . . the whole place was re-employed and [Piper and Winters] weren't the only [new] people.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the appellants persistently attempted to refer the district court to a larger comparative group. The court, just as persistently, refused to countenance such a comparison. Waivers are not lightly to be inferred, and in these circumstances, we are reluctant to deprive the appellants of their day in court. Although the question is not free from doubt, we conclude that the appellants adequately preserved the argument that the proper comparative group consists of all workers recalled or hired during December and January.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to this comparison. Costa Bros. tries valiantly to head off a detailed inquiry by insisting that, in the relevant period, it hired only persons who had been part of its regular complement. Without more, this professed policy cannot justify the entry of summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Indeed, such a praxis -- in DaCosta's phrase, the exclusionary use of \"my own men\" -- cuts both ways. Common sense teaches that when a work force is lily white (or nearly so), practices that have the effect of excluding outsiders may serve to discriminate against minorities in a devastatingly effective manner. Accordingly, the very existence of such a policy sometimes constitutes evidence of discrimination. See, e.g., EEOC v. Steamship Clerks Union, Local 1066, 48 F.3d 594, 606 (1st Cir. 1995); Thomas v. Washington County Sch. Bd., 915 F.2d 922, 925 (4th Cir. 1990). Given the contradictions and ambiguities that permeate this record, the question of whether DaCosta's stated preference for hiring \"my own men\" is a pretext for racial discrimination is for the factfinder at trial, not for the judge on a Rule 56 motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Costa Bros. also presses a \"same actor\" argument. See LeBlanc v. Great Am. Ins. Co., 6 F.3d 836, 847 (1st Cir. 1993). It observes that Ceribelli hired Rose and Gilbert on the basis of friendship and suggests that declining to rehire them based on racial animus makes no sense. But it was DaCosta, not Ceribelli, who rebuffed Rose and Gilbert when they applied for reinstatement. A jury rationally could conclude, therefore, that, in Ceribelli's own words, he had \"only hired a few minorities because of local pressure,\" and that DaCosta -- who owned the company -- precluded any further minority hiring once that pressure subsided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having cut a passable swath through the tangle of arguments advanced by the employer, we now focus on the adequacy of the appellants' proof of pretext cum animus. We previously concluded that DaCosta's statements that (1) \"I don't need minorities, and I don't need residents on this job. I got my men,\" and (2) \"I don't have to hire you locals or Cape Verdean people\" were amenable to differing interpretations, one benign and one discriminatory. See supra Part III(B). Although this ambiguity defeated the attempt to characterize the statements as direct evidence (and thus defeated the claim that the lower court erred in refusing to engage in a mixed-motive analysis), see id., the question differs under pretext analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In that mode, an inquiring court does not ask whether the plaintiff has adduced direct evidence of discrimination, but asks instead whether the evidence presented, regardless of its character, suffices to raise a genuine issue about the pretextuality of the employer's explanation for the challenged employment decision. In the course of this latter exercise, the court, at the summary judgment stage, must interpret the evidence in the light most flattering to the nonmovant, resolving all ambiguities in that party's favor. See Conward, 171 F.3d at 18; Pagano, 983 F.2d at 347. Thus, the fact that DaCosta's comments were susceptible to conflicting interpretations helps the appellants at this juncture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To all intents and purposes, that ends the matter. The evidence that we recounted in connection with the appellants' prima facie case suffices to put the question of pretext into issue, and DaCosta's statements, taken in the light most favorable to the appellants, add the necessary element of racial animus. See Hodgens v. General Dynamics Corp., 144 F.3d 151, 171 (1st Cir. 1998)(citing cases). In other words, there is room on this record for a rational factfinder to infer that Costa Bros.'s failure to recall the appellants was motivated by a proscribed racial animus rather than by random availability of workers or loyalty to members of its regular crew.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more were needed -- and we doubt that it is -- the record is replete with other evidence that points to the same conclusion. For instance, Ceribelli, when asked why minority workers had not been recalled, responded that Costa Bros. \"had only hired a few minorities because of local pressure.\" In the same vein, DaCosta's repeated allusions to \"you guys\" and terms of like tenor reinforce the inference of racial animus. Then, too, the circumstances surrounding Fernandes's abortive return to work lend further support.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We glean another relevant item of proof from George Medeiros's affidavit. Medeiros, a white mason, had been laid off along with the appellants on December 7. Later that month, he inquired about reinstatement. According to Medeiros:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Ceribelli told me to call Domingos DaCosta at the company office, and inform him that I am looking for work as a bricklayer and mason, and specifically inform him that I am a Mashpee resident and am white. I did what Mr. Ceribelli asked me to, and the next day [December 15] was hired to work on the Mashpee High School Project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the appellants do not choose to catalog this statement as direct evidence of racial discrimination -- a choice on which we take no view -- we believe that it speaks volumes in a pretext analysis. We realize that a factfinder will have to pass upon Medeiros's credibility, but that is precisely the point. The evidence, taken as a whole, creates a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Costa Bros.'s explanations are canards, designed to mask a discriminatory animus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. The State-Law Claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not separately discuss the merits of the appellants' state-law claim. The McDonnell Douglas framework applies to disparate treatment claims brought under Chapter 151B, but the appellants' burden is somewhat lighter in one respect. \"While federal law requires a showing of pretext plus [racial] animus, the Massachusetts courts appear, at the third step of the pavane, to require a claimant to show only pretext.\" Mullin, 164 F.3d at 699 (citing Blare v. Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., 646 N.E.2d 111, 116-17 (Mass. 1995)). We already have concluded that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether Costa Bros.'s stated reasons for its actions are a pretext for discrimination. See supra Part III(C). A fortiori, we must reach the same conclusion with respect to the appellants' state-law claim. See Brennan v. GTE Gov't Sys. Corp., 150 F.3d 21, 26-27 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.

From time to time, Costa Bros. suggests that these employees should be counted as \"minorities.\" In some contexts, persons of Portuguese descent indeed may be classified as members of a minority group. See 49 C.F.R. &#167; 26.5 (1999); see also Cone Corp. v. Florida Dep't of Transp., 921 F.2d 1190, 1193 n.10 (11th Cir. 1991). Here, however, the gravamen of the appellants' claim is that Costa Bros. discriminated against them because they were black and Cape Verdean, instead preferring white, non-Cape Verdean workers. Thus, for purposes of this case, we do not consider persons of Portuguese extraction to be \"minorities.\" Rather, we group such persons with other white workers (a grouping that emulates the taxonomy used by Costa Bros. in its EEO reports).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p>  By the same token, the appellants do not cite Fernandes's firing in March as an independent act of discrimination but, rather, treat it as further evidence of the employer's race-based animus in the December-January time frame.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p>  Although DaCosta and Ceribelli state in their respective affidavits that Fernandes \"was not a good mason,\" Costa Bros. does not directly aver that he was unqualified. In all events, Fernandes had worked as a mason for over twelve years; the company retained him until lack of heat forced job-wide layoffs without complaining about his proficiency; and it never cited poor performance as a justification for not recalling him. Given the de minimis nature of the proof required to establish a prima facie case, see Barbour v. Dynamics Research Corp., 63 F.3d 32, 38 (1st Cir. 1995), and the necessity to draw all inferences in the nonmovant's favor on summary judgment, we readily conclude that Fernandes satisfied this criterion.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p>  Because the mason and laborer jobs are closely connected and the record contains some evidence of interchangeability, we conclude that the employer's hiring practices anent both positions during the pertinent period are relevant to our analysis. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804-05 (holding that evidence relevant to a showing of pretext \"includes facts as to . . . [the employer's] general policy and practice with respect to minority employment\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p>  Costa Bros. argues that Ceribelli, a Brazilian national who was the foreman's son, should be counted as a member of a minority group. The record shows, however, that Costa Bros. itself recorded persons of Brazilian extraction as Caucasians.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p>  Costa Bros. asserts for the first time on appeal that some sort of seniority principle drove its hiring decisions. See Appellee's Brief at 25 n.18. This directly contradicts the argument that it made before the district court. Moreover, the suggestion is largely undeveloped. Consequently, we ignore it. See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p>  We say \"professed policy\" because the employer's assertion stands unconfirmed. The record reveals that it recalled no fewer than three persons who were, by its own admission, not part of its regular crew; and that it hired ten more, including Piper and Winters, who had no prior experience with Costa Bros. Indeed, we are unable to tell with any degree of assurance which of the other masons and laborers could legitimately lay claim to \"regular crew\" status. For example, Costa Bros. asserts that Antonio DaSilva and Fernando DaSilva were members of its regular crew, but the record suggests that these two men, like the appellants, were hired for the first time in November 1995.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p>  In an abundance of caution, we note that although the appellants' present proffer falls shy of the direct evidence threshold, it is possible that they might adduce further evidence at trial that would warrant the district court in concluding that mixed-motive analysis is appropriate and in framing its jury instructions accordingly. See Starceski v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 54 F.3d 1089, 1098 (3d Cir. 1995); Ostrowski, 968 F.2d at 181. Although we take no view of the likelihood of this possibility materializing, our decision today does not foreclose it.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

(Costa Bros.), alleging a discriminatory failure to rehire. They now appeal from an order granting summary judgment against them. Their appeal requires us to explore how courts charged with resolving discrimination cases should choose between pretext analysis (an approach first limned in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span> (1973)) and mixed-motive analysis (an alternative approach limned later in Price Waterhouse v.

We conclude, as did the district court, that the evidence thus far adduced does not trigger mixed-motive analysis. We also conclude, however, that under a properly performed pretext analysis, the appellants' case should have survived. Consequently, we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. THE FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the summary judgment standard demands, we take the facts in the light most hospitable to the appellants, indulging all reasonable inferences in their favor. See Conward v. Cambridge Sch. Comm., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762534\"><a href=\"/opinion/762534/thomas-conward-v-the-cambridge-school-committee/\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir. 1999). Mindful of this coign of vantage, we deliberately omit from our narrative versions of certain conversations and events that conflict with the appellants' accounts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1995, Stone Building Company secured a contract to construct a new high school in Mashpee, Massachusetts. It engaged Costa Bros. as the masonry subcontractor. Because the job was publicly funded, contractors and subcontractors were told that they had to conform to specific equal employment opportunity (EEO) rules and to issue weekly EEO summaries documenting the number of hours worked by minority employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A Portuguese immigrant, Domingos DaCosta, owns Costa Bros. On November 13, 1995, he retained Sebastian Ceribelli, a Brazilian, as the masonry foreman for the Mashpee project. DaCosta and Ceribelli then hired a number of masons and laborers to work on the job. Those engaged on November 27 included five masons -- the appellants and two white males, George Choquette and George Medeiros -- and a dark-skinned Cape Verdean laborer, Glenn Spinola. These six men worked as a team until December 7, when Ceribelli laid off all six due to winter weather conditions and lack of heat in the workplace. He vowed that he would recall them when the heating quandary had been solved. Other workers were laid off at roughly the same time (although some, unlike the appellants, were assigned to ongoing Costa Bros. projects elsewhere).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about December 13, Costa Bros. resumed work on the Mashpee project. It recalled some masons (but not the appellants). Gilbert visited the job site the following week and asked Ceribelli when he would be rehired. Ceribelli responded, \"The way things are going now . . . I wouldn't count on it.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rose sojourned to the site the next Saturday. He noticed masons working there and queried DaCosta about this circumstance. DaCosta replied, \"We're doing a little fixing up here.\" Rose then asked, \"Are we going to get called back?\" DaCosta responded, \"We're going to close in\" -- a comment that Rose reasonably took to mean that the building would be enclosed in order to create a heated space in which masons could work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having heard nothing further, Rose checked back two weeks later. He saw that the job site was fully heated and asked DaCosta, \"Aren't we coming back?\" DaCosta replied cryptically, \"Well, I got my men.\" When Rose inquired about what had happened to the plan to recruit residents and minorities, DaCosta stated, \"I don't need minorities, and I don't need no residents on this job. I got my men.\" Rose complained that DaCosta had \"twelve new faces\" working on the project, but DaCosta abruptly terminated the conversation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In point of fact, Costa Bros. recalled a total of eighteen workmen (masons and laborers) between December 13 and January 25, and hired ten new ones in that span (none of whom had worked previously for Costa Bros.). All twenty-eight were white males.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fernandes returned to the job site on numerous occasions in December and January. Each time, DaCosta told him that there was no work available but to come back again. After several weeks, Fernandes asked Ceribelli why he and the other Cape Verdeans had not been recalled. Ceribelli replied that Costa Bros. \"had only hired a few minorities because of local pressure.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 30, DaCosta, James Byrne (the clerk of the works), and a representative of the general contractor met with Fernandes, Raoul Galvin (a civil rights activist), and others from the local community regarding Costa Bros.'s compliance with EEO requirements. Galvin noted that Costa Bros. had hired more workers, all of whom were white, but that it had no minorities working at the site. He implored DaCosta to rehire Fernandes because \"whatever was going on at the time would stop if he at least put one of [the Cape Verdeans] back to work.\" DaCosta indicated that he would honor this request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fernandes reported for duty the following Monday but was informed that there was no work available. This experience was repeated several times. Costa Bros. finally restored Fernandes to the payroll on March 26, albeit as a laborer rather than as a mason. On the same day, Ceribelli warned him to \"watch out\" because DaCosta was \"going to be on [his] back.\" This prediction proved prophetic: according to Fernandes, DaCosta \"followed [him] around,\" constantly \"hollering and screaming\" at him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Fernandes reported for work the next morning, DaCosta instructed him to get an \"F block\" (or so he thought). Fernandes was unsure what an \"F block\" was and asked DaCosta (who, as matters turned out, had wanted a standard \"half block\"). After castigating Fernandes for his ignorance, DaCosta declared that he was \"tired of . . . what's going on between you guys,\" and voiced the opinion that \"[y]ou guys are trying to hurt me.\" He then proclaimed: \"I don't have to hire you locals or Cape Verdean people. This is my business. It belongs to me.\" At that juncture, DaCosta fired Fernandes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. TRAVEL OF THE CASE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After pursuing administrative remedies, see 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(e); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &#167; 5, the appellants sued. In their complaint, they alleged discrimination on the basis of race and color in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2000e to 2000e-17, and its state-law analogue, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &#167; 4(1). Costa Bros. denied the material allegations of the complaint, and the parties spent the next year conducting pretrial discovery. From the record and the briefs, it appears that the appellants' original claim was constructively amended to include discrimination predicated on national origin, and the case went forward on that assumption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, Costa Bros. moved for summary judgment, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, and the appellants filed an opposition. The district court heard oral argument, took the matter under advisement, and thereafter granted the motion as to all claims. In its unpublished rescript, the court characterized DaCosta's statement that \"I don't need minorities . . . on this job\" as a stray remark, insufficient to trigger mixed-motive analysis. Although the court catalogued DaCosta's comment that \"I don't have to hire you locals or Cape Verdean people\" in its recitation of the facts, it did not mention this comment thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Undertaking pretext analysis, the court focused on two white masons who had been hired in January 1996 -- Piper and Winters. The court ruled that the Piper hiring did not assist the appellants because Piper had special skills and they could not establish that their qualifications were equivalent to his. As to Winters, the court accepted Costa Bros.'s explanation that it had hired him on the recommendation of another employee, characterizing what had happened as cronyism rather than discrimination. The court never discussed whether the record sufficed to support a finding that this explanation was pretextual, nor did it explore the numerous other employment decisions that Costa Bros. made in the December-January time frame. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants asseverate that the district court erred in choosing a legal framework and that, even if the court marched down an acceptable analytic path, it did not stay on track. We consider these arguments in sequence, pausing first to frame the choice-of-approach issue. We then briefly address the appellants' state-law claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The Available Analytic Methods.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plaintiff alleging disparate treatment under Title VII may proceed on a mixed-motive approach or on a pretext approach. For purposes of this case, it is important to understand the basic difference between these two modalities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mixed-motive analysis applies when the evidence shows that an employer considered both a proscribed factor (say, race) and one or more legitimate factors (say, competence) in making a challenged employment decision. See Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 241-42. In that scenario, the plaintiff is not obliged to separate out the relative import of each element that went into the decision; rather, once the plaintiff proves that a proscribed factor \"played a motivating part\" in the decision, the burden of persuasion shifts to the employer, who will be held liable for damages under Title VII unless \"it can prove that, even if it had not taken [the proscribed factor] into account, it would have come to the same decision regarding [the plaintiff].\" Id. at 242, 244. Even then, because Congress has reshaped mixed-motive analysis in certain respects, the employee may be entitled to equitable relief so long as he has proven that the proscribed factor played some part in the decisional calculus. See 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2000e-2(m); 2000e-5(g)(2)(B); see also Higgins v. New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198690\"><a href=\"/opinion/198690/higgins-v-new-balance/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span>, 259 n.3 (1st Cir. 1999); Carey v. Mt. Desert Island Hosp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757871\"><a href=\"/opinion/757871/michael-d-carey-v-mt-desert-island-hospital-michael-d-carey-v-mt/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 43-44 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is readily apparent that this mixed-motive approach, uncabined, has the potential to swallow whole the traditional McDonnell Douglas analysis. To guard against this possibility, the Court restricted its applicability to those infrequent cases in which a plaintiff can demonstrate with a high degree of assurance that the employment decision of which he complains \"was the product of a mixture of legitimate and illegitimate motives.\" Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 247. Under this formulation, access to the mixed-motive approach ultimately depends on the quality of the available evidence. Most courts agree that Justice O'Connor's seminal concurrence in Price Waterhouse furnishes the best device for testing quality (and, thus, the best roadmap for segregating mixed-motive cases from the mine-run of discrimination cases). After all, when the Supreme Court rules by means of a plurality opinion (as was true in Price Waterhouse), inferior courts should give effect to the narrowest ground upon which a majority of the Justices supporting the judgment would agree. See Marks v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109611\"><a href=\"/opinion/109611/marks-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span>, 193 (1977). The O'Connor concurrence fits this profile. Hence, we turn to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"What is required [to trigger mixed-motive analysis] is . . . direct evidence that decisionmakers placed substantial negative reliance on an illegitimate criterion in reaching their decision.\" Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 277 (O'Connor, J., concurring). Because discrimination tends more and more to operate in subtle ways, direct evidence is relatively rare; when it comes to light, however, a plaintiff can use it to demonstrate \"that an illegitimate factor played a substantial role in a particular employment decision.\" Id. at 275. It follows that plaintiffs may use the Price Waterhouse mechanism in disparate treatment cases in which they adduce direct evidence of a discriminatory animus, whereas they must proceed under the conventional McDonnell Douglas framework (commonly called \"pretext analysis\") in all other cases. See Ayala-Gerena v. Bristol Myers-Squibb Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"726050\"><a href=\"/opinion/726050/71-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1398-35-fedrserv3d-395-miguel-angel/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span>, 95 (1st Cir. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the pretext method, the plaintiff first must establish a prima facie case. See Texas Dep't of Comm'y Affairs v. Burdine, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110424\"><a href=\"/opinion/110424/texas-dept-of-community-affairs-v-burdine/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></a></span>, 252-53 (1981); McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. We shall return to the components of the prima facie case; for now, it suffices to say that this requirement is \"not onerous.\" Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253. If the plaintiff clears this modest hurdle, the burden of production -- but not the burden of persuasion -- shifts to the employer, who must articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. See St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112901\"><a href=\"/opinion/112901/st-marys-honor-center-v-hicks/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span>, 506-07 (1993); Burdine, 450 U.S. at 254-55. Once that occurs, the plaintiff must show both that the employer's \"proffered reason is a sham, and that discriminatory animus sparked [its] actions.\" Conward, 171 F.3d at 19. To this end, the full panoply of circumstantial evidence is available, including but not limited to \"statistical evidence showing disparate treatment by the employer of members of the protected class, comments by decisionmakers which denigrate [persons in the protected group], the incidence of differential treatment in the workplace, and the deployment of . . . replacements.\" Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573068\"><a href=\"/opinion/573068/samuel-mesnick-v-general-electric-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></a></span>, 824 (1st Cir. 1991) (citations omitted). The totality of the evidence then is examined \"as part of an aggregate package of proof.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plaintiff, uncertain of what discovery will yield or how a judge will react to certain proffers, may elect to proceed simultaneously on both fronts (mixed-motive and pretext), cognizant that the trial court, at an appropriate stage of the litigation, will channel the case into one format or the other. See Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 247 n.12; Thomas v. National Football League Players Ass'n, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184382\"><a href=\"/opinion/184382/thomas-valerie-v-natl-ftbl-leag-plyrs/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">198</span></a></span>, 202 (D.C. Cir. 1997). Consistent with the O'Connor concurrence, the court typically will make that determination based on the availability or unavailability of direct evidence. See Taylor v.

In a mixed-motive analysis, \"the burden of persuasion shifts from the employee to the employer, who must then affirmatively prove that it would have made the same decision even if it had not taken the protected characteristic into account.\" Ayala-Gerena, 95 F.3d at 95-96; accord Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 246 (explaining that, under a mixed-motive analysis, \"the plaintiff must persuade the factfinder on one point, and then the employer, if it wishes to prevail, must persuade it on another\"). This contrasts vividly with pretext analysis, under which the employee retains the burden of persuasion throughout. See Cumpiano v. Banco Santander P.R., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540783\"><a href=\"/opinion/540783/wilma-cumpiano-aka-wilma-cumpiano-sanchez-v-banco-santander-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 153 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

Because this case comes to us on appeal from an order granting brevis disposition, we afford de novo review. See Conward, 171 F.3d at 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As our earlier discussion indicates, direct evidence is the touchstone for mixed-motive analysis. Hence, the fate of the appellants' present contention hinges on whether they adduced direct evidence of Costa Bros.'s use of a proscribed factor (race, color, and/or national origin) in the decisional process. Answering that question is more difficult than might appear at first blush. To be sure, Justice O'Connor furnished a trenchant, universally accepted example of what is not direct evidence: stray remarks, such as \"statements by nondecisionmakers, or statements by decisionmakers unrelated to the decisional process itself.\" Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 277 (O'Connor, J., concurring). Since then, however, jurists have struggled in attempting to define the term affirmatively. This operose task not only has divided the courts of appeals but also has created a patchwork of intra-circuit conflicts. Generally speaking, three schools of thought have emerged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The \"Classic\" Position. Some courts adopt the traditional definition of \"direct evidence\" for this purpose, holding that the term signifies evidence which, if believed, suffices to prove the fact of discriminatory animus without inference, presumption, or resort to other evidence. See, e.g., Shorter v. ICG Holdings, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"158469\"><a href=\"/opinion/158469/shorter-v-icg-holdings-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1204</span></a></span>, 1207 (10th Cir. 1999); Haas v. Advo Sys., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762037\"><a href=\"/opinion/762037/ron-haas-v-advo-systems-incorporated/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">732</span></a></span>, 734 n.2 (5th Cir. 1999); EEOC v.

Loral Vought Sys. Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"715861\"><a href=\"/opinion/715861/70-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1027-68-empl-prac-dec-p-44050-ellis-e/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 40 (5th Cir. 1996). Although only the Fifth and Tenth Circuits cling consistently to this view, other tribunals have embraced it periodically. See, e.g., Carter v. Three Springs Resid'l Treatment, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749848\"><a href=\"/opinion/749848/76-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1635-72-empl-prac-dec-p-45148-11-fla-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span>, 641 (11th Cir. 1998); Troupe v.

The \"Animus Plus\" Position.  The Fourth Circuit, sitting en banc, recently defined \"direct evidence\" for this purpose as evidence, both direct and circumstantial, of conduct or statements that (1) reflect directly the alleged discriminatory animus and (2) bear squarely on the contested employment decision. See Taylor, 193 F.3d at 232. The D.C. Circuit takes the same view. See Thomas, 131 F.3d at 204. The Ninth Circuit seems headed in this direction. See Lambert v. Ackerley, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">997</span></span>, 1008-09 (9th Cir. 1999) (en banc), petition for cert. denied, ___U.S.___,120 S.Ct. 936, (U.S. 1999). The Third Circuit at one time was in the \"animus plus\" camp, see Walden v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746874\"><a href=\"/opinion/746874/74-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1761-47-fed-r-evid-serv-1158-linda-s/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span>, 513 (3d Cir. 1997), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1516</span></span> (1998), but that court is poised to revisit the question. See Hankins v. City of Philadelphia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765879\"><a href=\"/opinion/765879/no-98-1327/\"><span class=\"volume\">189</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">353</span></a></span> (3d Cir. 1999), rehearing en banc granted, opinion vacated, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765752\"><a href=\"/opinion/765752/no-98-1327/\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></a></span> (3d Cir. 1999). Two other courts of appeals have indicated occasional approval of this approach, see, e.g., Sheehan v. Donlen Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763288\"><a href=\"/opinion/763288/79-fair-emplpraccas-bna-540-75-empl-prac-dec-p-45791-regina/\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1039</span></a></span>, 1044 (7th Cir. 1999); Deneen v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749827\"><a href=\"/opinion/749827/76-fair-emplpraccas-bna-397-72-empl-prac-dec-p-45108-ruth-c/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">431</span></a></span>, 436 (8th Cir. 1998), but as the cases cited herein indicate, both of these courts have flirted with other formulations. Courts endorsing the animus plus position do not distinguish between direct and circumstantial evidence in the classic sense but, rather, emphasize that the mixed-motive trigger depends on the strength of the plaintiff's case. See, e.g., Kubicko v. Ogden Logistics Servs., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764906\"><a href=\"/opinion/764906/richard-kubicko-v-ogden-logistics-services-a-joint-venture-between-ogden/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span>, 553 (4th Cir. 1999) (emphasizing that whether a case falls under the mixed-motive or pretext rubric \"ultimately hinges on the strength of the evidence establishing discrimination\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); Thomas, 131 F.3d at 204 (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. The \"Animus\" Position. A few courts resolve the direct evidence conundrum by the simple expedient of deleting the \"plus\" from the \"animus plus\" formulation. Those courts opine that as long as the evidence (whether direct or circumstantial) is tied to the alleged discriminatory animus, it need not bear squarely on the challenged employment decision. The Second Circuit advocates this position. See, e.g., Lightfoot v. Union Carbide Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739296\"><a href=\"/opinion/739296/75-fair-emplpraccas-bna-355-71-empl-prac-dec-p-44866-46-fed-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">898</span></a></span>, 913 (2d Cir. 1997); Ostrowski, 968 F.2d at 182. The Eighth Circuit intermittently takes this stance, see, e.g., Kerns v. Capital Graphics, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764466\"><a href=\"/opinion/764466/janet-r-kerns-v-capital-graphics-inc-doing-business-as-clarinda/\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1011</span></a></span>, 1017-18 (8th Cir. 1999); Radabaugh v. Zip Feed Mills, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610655\"><a href=\"/opinion/610655/dean-radabaugh-v-zip-feed-mills-inc-tom-batcheller-don-kjelden/\"><span class=\"volume\">997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">444</span></a></span>, 449 (8th Cir. 1993), and two other cases appear to fit somewhat loosely into this category, see Wright v. Southland Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"74082\"><a href=\"/opinion/74082/wright-v-southland-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1287</span></a></span>, 1303-04 (11th Cir. 1999); Hennessy v. Penril Datacomm Networks, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"707611\"><a href=\"/opinion/707611/patricia-hennessy-v-penril-datacomm-networks-incorporated-and-richard/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1344</span></a></span>, 1348-50 (7th Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. The First Circuit's Position. To complete our survey of the legal landscape, we direct our gaze inward. Although we have dropped inconclusive hints here and there, see, e.g., Ayala-Gerena, 95 F.3d at 95-96; Smith v. F.W. Morse &amp; Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196571\"><a href=\"/opinion/196571/smith-v-fw-morse-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">413</span></a></span>, 421 (1st Cir. 1996), we have yet to choose among these conflicting approaches. Thus, the question is wide open in this circuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. The Case at Hand. This case does not require us to fill the void, and we decline to do so gratuitously. The appellants contend that two comments attributed to DaCosta -- \"I don't need minorities, and I don't need residents on this job\" and \"I don't have to hire you locals or Cape Verdean people\" -- constitute direct evidence that a proscribed factor influenced Costa Bros.'s hiring practices. The employer demurs, asserting that these are merely \"stray remarks\" and, in all events, lack sufficient probative force to constitute direct evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not share the view that DaCosta's statements must be classified as stray remarks. As we have pointed out, DaCosta was the ultimate decisionmaker, and both pronouncements pertained to the decisional process. He made the first statement when refusing to rehire Rose; because it bore directly on a challenged employment decision, it hardly qualifies as a stray remark. See, e.g., Deneen, 132 F.3d at 436; Diaz-Gandia v. Dapena-Thompson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"722531\"><a href=\"/opinion/722531/stanley-diaz-gandia-v-maria-rosa-dapena-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">609</span></a></span>, 616 (1st Cir. 1996). DaCosta uttered the second statement when cashiering Fernandez and, although this suit does not challenge Fernandes's dismissal per se, see infra note 3, we think that the comment, which in terms bears upon Costa Bros.'s repeated refusals to rehire the appellants, sufficiently implicates the decisional process to avoid classification as a stray remark. See Wichmann v. Board of Trustees, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764846\"><a href=\"/opinion/764846/theodore-f-wichmann-v-board-of-trustees-of-southern-illinois-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">791</span></a></span>, 802 (7th Cir. 1999), granted, judgement vacated by, (U.S. 1999); Thomas, 131 F.3d at 204.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the last analysis, however, this taxonomic triumph constitutes a hollow victory for the appellants. Despite the fact that these statements cannot be brushed aside as stray remarks, they are inherently ambiguous and, as such, do not directly reflect the alleged animus. The first -- \"I don't need minorities and I don't need residents on the job\" -- may be interpreted either as an admission of an exclusionary hiring practice (thus explicating the true reason for DaCosta's actions) or as a benign response to a specific inquiry reflecting DaCosta's (erroneous) perception that he no longer had to make special efforts to comply with EEO requirements. The second -- \"I don't have to hire you locals or Cape Verdean people\" -- may be interpreted either as a discriminatory explanation for DaCosta's actions or as a response to what he perceived as an unjustified attempt to impose some sort of quota system upon his company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under any of the three views we have delineated, these statements do not rise to the level of direct evidence. Courts that take the \"classic\" position have contrasted direct evidence with, inter alia, ambiguous statements, and have indicated that the latter will not suffice. See Maldonado v. U.S. Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765537\"><a href=\"/opinion/765537/jessica-maldonado-v-us-bank-and-manufacturers-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">759</span></a></span>, 763 (7th Cir. 1999); Troupe, 20 F.3d at 736-37. Courts that take either the \"animus plus\" or \"animus\" position place great emphasis on the strength of the proof of discriminatory animus. See, e.g., Fuller v. Phipps, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"706000\"><a href=\"/opinion/706000/69-fair-emplpraccas-bna-111-67-empl-prac-dec-p-43751-charles-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1137</span></a></span>, 1142-43 (4th Cir. 1995); Thomas, 131 F.3d at 204; Fields v. New York State Office of Mental Retardation &amp; Developmental Disabilities, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741739\"><a href=\"/opinion/741739/nathan-fields-v-new-york-state-office-of-mental-retardation-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">116</span></a></span>, 122 (2d Cir. 1997); Ostrowski, 968 F.2d at 182. In our judgment, inherently ambiguous statements, without more, cannot supply the strong evidence that these courts rightfully demand as a prerequisite to mixed-motive analysis. We conclude, therefore, that a statement that plausibly can be interpreted two different ways -- one discriminatory and the other benign -- does not directly reflect illegal animus and, thus, does not constitute direct evidence. See, e.g., Carter, 132 F.3d at 641 (\"We have held that statements that are open to more than one interpretation do not constitute direct evidence of racial discrimination.\"); Troupe, 20 F.3d at 736-37 (similar). Thus, DaCosta's statements do not serve to unlatch the door to the mixed-motive approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Pretext Analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that the district court appropriately selected pretext analysis as the method of choice, we next examine the court's execution of that analysis. We again afford plenary review. See Conward, 171 F.3d at 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The Prima Facie Case. Notwithstanding Costa Bros.'s tendency to conceptualize this appeal as a reduction-in-force case, the appellants' complaint squarely alleges a discriminatory failure to rehire. Because the appellants have not complained that the layoff itself was discriminatory, the employer's focus on the elements of a prima facie reduction-in-force case is misplaced.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The proper focus is on failure to rehire, and the proper source for the elements of a prima facie failure-to-rehire case is McDonnell Douglas itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under that authority, a plaintiff alleging a failure to rehire establishes his prima facie case by showing:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) that he belongs to a racial minority; (ii) that he applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants; (iii) that, despite his qualifications, he was rejected; and (iv) that, after his rejection, the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of complainant's qualifications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. Contrary to Costa Bros.'s contention, a plaintiff need not show as part of his prima facie case that the employer either recalled similarly situated non-minority employees or otherwise treated employees of different ethnic backgrounds more favorably. See Perry v. Woodward, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765849\"><a href=\"/opinion/765849/elizabeth-perry-and-cross-appellee-v-judy-woodward-individually-and-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1220</span></a></span>, 1228-29 (10th Cir. 1999); Conward, 171 F.3d at 19-20; Walker v.

The first prong is uncontroversial; all three appellants are Cape Verdean and, as such, belong to a racial minority. The second element also falls easily into place: all three performed satisfactorily as masons prior to the layoff and plainly were qualified to do the work.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the third facet of the prima facie case, the record establishes that all three appellants returned to the job site at various times after the layoff and sought reinstatement. For the most part, Costa Bros. rebuffed these efforts. The sole exception -- the time in March when DaCosta capitulated to external pressure and hired Fernandes as a laborer, only to fire him on his second day of work -- hardly suffices to tip the balance. Cf. International Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109665\"><a href=\"/opinion/109665/teamsters-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">324</span></a></span>, 341-42 (1977) (explaining that subsequent changes in corporate \"hiring and promotion policies . . . could not erase [the company's] previous illegal conduct or its obligation to afford relief to those who suffered because of it\"). This is especially so since what transpired on that occasion plausibly can be interpreted (drawing permissive inferences favorable to the appellants) as further evidence of DaCosta's discriminatory treatment of Fernandes. After all, DaCosta had resisted rehiring Fernandes for several weeks and had to be persuaded to do so by a civil rights advocate. Moreover, Ceribelli -- the Costa Bros. foreman -- forewarned Fernandes that DaCosta would be \"on [his] back,\" and the sequence of events that followed reasonably could be seen as proof of the pudding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants also fulfilled the final prima facie case requirement. In the relevant time frame (December-January), Costa Bros. had an ongoing need for masons on the Mashpee project, hiring and recalling many throughout the period. For aught that appears, the qualifications of the vast majority of these masons were much the same as the appellants' qualifications. No more is exigible. See Conward, 171 F.3d at 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Costa Bros.'s efforts to dispute this element of the prima facie case are unavailing. In the district court, it characterized its hiring practices as \"simply react[ing] to men who appeared at the right place at the right time,\" and argued that it had no need for additional help at the precise moments that the appellants inquired. On this chiaroscuro record, a jury might so find -- but it also might find this to be a self-serving fiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It may or may not be a coincidence that, of the nineteen men whom DaCosta furloughed on December 7 and 8 (the three appellants, plus Choquette, George Medeiros, Spinola, William Ceribelli, Juliao Fernandes, Victor Fernandez, Martirio Neto, Antonio Santo, Jose Silva, Artur Teles, Antonio DaSilva, Fernando DaSilva, Miguel Silva, Joseph Pimenthal, Jose Claudino, and Dinos Medeiros), all but five either were reassigned to another Costa Bros. job or recalled in mid-December.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Likewise, it may or may not be coincidental that four of the excluded five (the three appellants and Spinola) comprised the entire complement of minority employees who had toiled on the Mashpee project. Moreover, the fourteen men who were given an opportunity to work for Costa Bros. either at Mashpee or on another project in mid-December included two white masons (George Medeiros and William Ceribelli) and three white laborers (Joao Bolarinho, Fernando DaSilva, and Artur Teles) who had been hired, and then furloughed, on approximately the same dates as the appellants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Costa Bros. attempts to blunt the force of this evidence in three ways. First, it notes that George Medeiros, though recalled, only worked for four days. The fact remains, however, that he was recalled and the appellants were not. Second, Costa Bros. points out that one member of the excluded group (Choquette) was a white mason. That is true as far as it goes -- but it does not go very far: the record is devoid of evidence that Choquette applied for reinstatement at any time. Third, Costa Bros. asserts that it rehired Spinola in April 1996. We think that this fact possesses only marginal relevance here, inasmuch as Spinola's recall occurred well beyond the December-January period during which the appellants unsuccessfully sought reinstatement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the fourteen rehires just discussed, the record indicates that Costa Bros. engaged a half-dozen new workers for determinate positions during late December and January: Carlos Bolarinho (a laborer, hired on December 29); Piper (a mason, hired on January 2); Winters (a mason, hired on January 10); Joaquim Fernandes (a laborer, hired on January 18); Dan Cormier (a laborer, hired on January 22); and Luis Amaro (a laborer, hired on January 23). All were white. Costa Bros. recruited four more white males (Antonio Reboca, Joao Soares, Michael Oliveira, and Steven Downey) on various dates between January 5 and January 25. Although these four were assigned to work on the Mashpee project, we cannot accurately determine from the existing record which were masons and which were laborers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These figures make the appellants' point emphatically. They create an ample evidentiary platform for a finding that, during the relevant two-month period, Costa Bros. sought applicants possessing qualifications similar to those of the appellants for open positions. Thus, the prima facie case was fully formed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The Employer's Reason. We proceed to the next step of the McDonnell Douglas pavane: Costa Bros.'s professed reason for failing to rehire the appellants. In its response to a discovery request, Costa Bros. stated that it hired others in the pertinent time frame because it \"needed masons or laborers and the individuals [eventually hired] were available.\" It also stated that, apart from Piper and Winters, all the masons that it engaged \"were currently working or had worked for Costa Brothers.\" The employer glossed these statements in its summary judgment papers, maintaining that it \"simply reacted to men who appeared at the right place at the right time and put them to work.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Piper and Winters, Costa Bros. makes situation-specific arguments. Piper, it says, had special skills as a layout man, and Winters was recommended by Victor Fernandez, another Costa Bros. employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We assume, for argument's sake, that these reasons, in the aggregate, constitute legitimate, nondiscriminatory grounds for hiring others in lieu of recalling the appellants. Accordingly, we proceed to the third and final stage of the McDonnell Douglas inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Pretext for Discrimination. Once the employer articulates a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for a challenged employment decision, the plaintiff must be accorded a fair chance to show that the stated reason disguised a discriminatory animus. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804; Pagano v. Frank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597806\"><a href=\"/opinion/597806/michael-pagano-v-anthony-m-frank-postmaster-general-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">343</span></a></span>, 348 (1st Cir. 1993). As long as the plaintiff offers evidence of pretext, the trial court must not accept the employer's proffered reason for the adverse employment action at face value, no matter how plausible it may sound, but must proceed to the final analytic step. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804. To that end, we review the summary judgment record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the employer's situation-specific reasons. The lower court accepted without further inquiry Costa Bros.'s explanations of why it hired Piper and Winters. We are not so sanguine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That said, we cannot fault the district court's ruling vis-a-vis Piper. Costa Bros. asserts without contradiction that it needed a layout man on the job and that none of the appellants possessed this particular skill. If true, this rationale suffices to dispel any odor of unfair discrimination, see Hill v. Seaboard Coast Line R.R. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"454947\"><a href=\"/opinion/454947/39-fair-emplpraccas-1656-38-empl-prac-dec-p-35526-andrew-l-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">767</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">771</span></a></span>, 774 (11th Cir. 1985), and the appellants neither contested the need for a layout man nor claimed to possess the requisite skill set.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Winters's hiring is more problematic. The district court characterized this event as cronyism, not discrimination (and therefore lawful, though perhaps unsavory). For this proposition, it relied upon our opinion in Foster v. Dalton, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709035\"><a href=\"/opinion/709035/69-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1402-67-empl-prac-dec-p-43789-sharon-c/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1995). Foster, however, cannot carry the weight that the district court thrust upon it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Foster, the trial court concluded that cronyism, not race discrimination, had prompted a hiring decision. See id. at 55. We upheld that conclusion, ruling that \"in this case, cronyism provides a sufficient alternative explanation\" for the decision. See id. at 56. Withal, the district court made its finding not on summary judgment but after a bench trial. See id. at 54-56. The opinion does not stand for the proposition that a court, at the summary judgment stage, may accept uncritically an employer's articulation of cronyism as an explanation for its actions. Rather, the court must take the next step and determine, on whole-record review, if the evidence raises a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the proffered explanation is the real reason for the employer's decision or, conversely, a pretext for discrimination. See, e.g., Conward, 171 F.3d at 19; Mullin v. Raytheon Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"760463\"><a href=\"/opinion/760463/78-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1174-74-empl-prac-dec-p-45696-william/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">696</span></a></span>, 699 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></span> (1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At any rate, the district court's error goes well beyond its failure to probe the facts surrounding Winters's enlistment. In the circumstances of this case, the court should have cast the net of its inquiry more widely and assessed all the recalls and hirings that had transpired during the months of December and January. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804-05; Conward, 171 F.3d at 20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Costa Bros. seems to concede that, in the usual case, this would be the proper focus. Nevertheless, it maintains that the appellants directed the lower court's attention to Piper and Winters, and thus have waived the right to claim that the court should have considered a broader array of hiring decisions. We examine this line of defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fairness, the appellants did place heavy emphasis on the arrival of Piper and Winters. Yet, we cannot say that they did so to the exclusion of the broader comparative group. The appellants' complaint alleges, without limitation, that on three dates in January 1996, \"the defendant hired other outside white employees for the mason positions previously held by plaintiffs.\" The appellants followed up on this averment in the course of pretrial discovery; they sought the race and national origin of all employees who were (a) laid off on December 7, 1995, and (b) hired (or rehired) thereafter. When Costa Bros. moved for summary judgment, the appellants' opposition noted that \"[d]efendant also admits that numerous employees [who] were white and/or Portuguese were hired at the project as masons,\" thus conceptualizing the comparative group as comprising more than merely Piper and Winters. They also assailed the employer's contention that DaCosta had hired his \"own men,\" positing that this was not a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for failing to recall the appellants because this group included no minorities. Finally, at oral argument on the summary judgment motion, the appellants' counsel attempted to focus the court on the issue of pretext, urging that the \"regular crew\" and \"special skills\" explanations \"weren't the reasons that [DaCosta] wasn't hiring minorities\"; that \"when [Rose] went back to this site the place was full . . . and none of the faces that he saw on the job site when he returned there were any employees he had seen previously\"; and that \"the reasons given [by DaCosta] were false . . . . the whole place was re-employed and [Piper and Winters] weren't the only [new] people.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the appellants persistently attempted to refer the district court to a larger comparative group. The court, just as persistently, refused to countenance such a comparison. Waivers are not lightly to be inferred, and in these circumstances, we are reluctant to deprive the appellants of their day in court. Although the question is not free from doubt, we conclude that the appellants adequately preserved the argument that the proper comparative group consists of all workers recalled or hired during December and January.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to this comparison. Costa Bros. tries valiantly to head off a detailed inquiry by insisting that, in the relevant period, it hired only persons who had been part of its regular complement. Without more, this professed policy cannot justify the entry of summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Indeed, such a praxis -- in DaCosta's phrase, the exclusionary use of \"my own men\" -- cuts both ways. Common sense teaches that when a work force is lily white (or nearly so), practices that have the effect of excluding outsiders may serve to discriminate against minorities in a devastatingly effective manner. Accordingly, the very existence of such a policy sometimes constitutes evidence of discrimination. See, e.g., EEOC v. Steamship Clerks Union, Local 1066, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195936\"><a href=\"/opinion/195936/eeoc-v-local-1066/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">594</span></a></span>, 606 (1st Cir. 1995); Thomas v. Washington County Sch. Bd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548949\"><a href=\"/opinion/548949/patricia-a-thomas-v-washington-county-school-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">922</span></a></span>, 925 (4th Cir. 1990). Given the contradictions and ambiguities that permeate this record, the question of whether DaCosta's stated preference for hiring \"my own men\" is a pretext for racial discrimination is for the factfinder at trial, not for the judge on a Rule 56 motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Costa Bros. also presses a \"same actor\" argument. See LeBlanc v. Great Am. Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"654585\"><a href=\"/opinion/654585/theodore-l-leblanc-v-great-american-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">836</span></a></span>, 847 (1st Cir. 1993). It observes that Ceribelli hired Rose and Gilbert on the basis of friendship and suggests that declining to rehire them based on racial animus makes no sense. But it was DaCosta, not Ceribelli, who rebuffed Rose and Gilbert when they applied for reinstatement. A jury rationally could conclude, therefore, that, in Ceribelli's own words, he had \"only hired a few minorities because of local pressure,\" and that DaCosta -- who owned the company -- precluded any further minority hiring once that pressure subsided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having cut a passable swath through the tangle of arguments advanced by the employer, we now focus on the adequacy of the appellants' proof of pretext cum animus. We previously concluded that DaCosta's statements that (1) \"I don't need minorities, and I don't need residents on this job. I got my men,\" and (2) \"I don't have to hire you locals or Cape Verdean people\" were amenable to differing interpretations, one benign and one discriminatory. See supra Part III(B). Although this ambiguity defeated the attempt to characterize the statements as direct evidence (and thus defeated the claim that the lower court erred in refusing to engage in a mixed-motive analysis), see id., the question differs under pretext analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In that mode, an inquiring court does not ask whether the plaintiff has adduced direct evidence of discrimination, but asks instead whether the evidence presented, regardless of its character, suffices to raise a genuine issue about the pretextuality of the employer's explanation for the challenged employment decision. In the course of this latter exercise, the court, at the summary judgment stage, must interpret the evidence in the light most flattering to the nonmovant, resolving all ambiguities in that party's favor. See Conward, 171 F.3d at 18; Pagano, 983 F.2d at 347. Thus, the fact that DaCosta's comments were susceptible to conflicting interpretations helps the appellants at this juncture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To all intents and purposes, that ends the matter. The evidence that we recounted in connection with the appellants' prima facie case suffices to put the question of pretext into issue, and DaCosta's statements, taken in the light most favorable to the appellants, add the necessary element of racial animus. See Hodgens v. General Dynamics Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197958\"><a href=\"/opinion/197958/hodgens-v-general-dynamics-cor/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></a></span>, 171 (1st Cir. 1998)(citing cases). In other words, there is room on this record for a rational factfinder to infer that Costa Bros.'s failure to recall the appellants was motivated by a proscribed racial animus rather than by random availability of workers or loyalty to members of its regular crew.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more were needed -- and we doubt that it is -- the record is replete with other evidence that points to the same conclusion. For instance, Ceribelli, when asked why minority workers had not been recalled, responded that Costa Bros. \"had only hired a few minorities because of local pressure.\" In the same vein, DaCosta's repeated allusions to \"you guys\" and terms of like tenor reinforce the inference of racial animus. Then, too, the circumstances surrounding Fernandes's abortive return to work lend further support.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We glean another relevant item of proof from George Medeiros's affidavit. Medeiros, a white mason, had been laid off along with the appellants on December 7. Later that month, he inquired about reinstatement. According to Medeiros:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Ceribelli told me to call Domingos DaCosta at the company office, and inform him that I am looking for work as a bricklayer and mason, and specifically inform him that I am a Mashpee resident and am white. I did what Mr. Ceribelli asked me to, and the next day [December 15] was hired to work on the Mashpee High School Project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the appellants do not choose to catalog this statement as direct evidence of racial discrimination -- a choice on which we take no view -- we believe that it speaks volumes in a pretext analysis. We realize that a factfinder will have to pass upon Medeiros's credibility, but that is precisely the point. The evidence, taken as a whole, creates a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Costa Bros.'s explanations are canards, designed to mask a discriminatory animus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. The State-Law Claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not separately discuss the merits of the appellants' state-law claim. The McDonnell Douglas framework applies to disparate treatment claims brought under Chapter 151B, but the appellants' burden is somewhat lighter in one respect. \"While federal law requires a showing of pretext plus [racial] animus, the Massachusetts courts appear, at the third step of the pavane, to require a claimant to show only pretext.\" Mullin, 164 F.3d at 699 (citing Blare v. Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">646</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></span>, 116-17 (Mass. 1995)). We already have concluded that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether Costa Bros.'s stated reasons for its actions are a pretext for discrimination. See supra Part III(C). A fortiori, we must reach the same conclusion with respect to the appellants' state-law claim. See Brennan v. GTE Gov't Sys. Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"756418\"><a href=\"/opinion/756418/77-fair-emplpraccas-bna-430-74-empl-prac-dec-p-45627-daniel-f/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 26-27 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. In the circumstances of this case, sufficient evidence exists to permit a rational finder of fact to infer that the employer's articulated reasons for not rehiring the appellants are merely a coverup for racial discrimination. Consequently, we vacate the order granting summary judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent herewith.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vacated and remanded. Costs to appellants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  Cape Verde is a strand of islands off the west coast of Africa. Historically a Portuguese colony, it proclaimed its independence on July 5, 1975.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>  Many of the masons and laborers were of Portuguese extraction. From time to time, Costa Bros. suggests that these employees should be counted as \"minorities.\" In some contexts, persons of Portuguese descent indeed may be classified as members of a minority group. See 49 C.F.R. &#167; 26.5 (1999); see also Cone Corp. v. Florida Dep't of Transp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553296\"><a href=\"/opinion/553296/the-cone-corporation-ch-barco-contracting-co-asphalt-pavers-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">921</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1190</span></a></span>, 1193 n.10 (11th Cir. 1991). Here, however, the gravamen of the appellants' claim is that Costa Bros. discriminated against them because they were black and Cape Verdean, instead preferring white, non-Cape Verdean workers. Thus, for purposes of this case, we do not consider persons of Portuguese extraction to be \"minorities.\" Rather, we group such persons with other white workers (a grouping that emulates the taxonomy used by Costa Bros. in its EEO reports).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p>  By the same token, the appellants do not cite Fernandes's firing in March as an independent act of discrimination but, rather, treat it as further evidence of the employer's race-based animus in the December-January time frame.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p>  Although DaCosta and Ceribelli state in their respective affidavits that Fernandes \"was not a good mason,\" Costa Bros. does not directly aver that he was unqualified. In all events, Fernandes had worked as a mason for over twelve years; the company retained him until lack of heat forced job-wide layoffs without complaining about his proficiency; and it never cited poor performance as a justification for not recalling him. Given the de minimis nature of the proof required to establish a prima facie case, see Barbour v. Dynamics Research Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196245\"><a href=\"/opinion/196245/barbour-v-dynamics-research/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span>, 38 (1st Cir. 1995), and the necessity to draw all inferences in the nonmovant's favor on summary judgment, we readily conclude that Fernandes satisfied this criterion.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p>  Because the mason and laborer jobs are closely connected and the record contains some evidence of interchangeability, we conclude that the employer's hiring practices anent both positions during the pertinent period are relevant to our analysis. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804-05 (holding that evidence relevant to a showing of pretext \"includes facts as to . . . [the employer's] general policy and practice with respect to minority employment\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p>  Costa Bros. argues that Ceribelli, a Brazilian national who was the foreman's son, should be counted as a member of a minority group. The record shows, however, that Costa Bros. itself recorded persons of Brazilian extraction as Caucasians.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p>  Costa Bros. asserts for the first time on appeal that some sort of seniority principle drove its hiring decisions. See Appellee's Brief at 25 n.18. This directly contradicts the argument that it made before the district court. Moreover, the suggestion is largely undeveloped. Consequently, we ignore it. See United States v. Zannino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p>  We say \"professed policy\" because the employer's assertion stands unconfirmed. The record reveals that it recalled no fewer than three persons who were, by its own admission, not part of its regular crew; and that it hired ten more, including Piper and Winters, who had no prior experience with Costa Bros. Indeed, we are unable to tell with any degree of assurance which of the other masons and laborers could legitimately lay claim to \"regular crew\" status. For example, Costa Bros. asserts that Antonio DaSilva and Fernando DaSilva were members of its regular crew, but the record suggests that these two men, like the appellants, were hired for the first time in November 1995.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p>  In an abundance of caution, we note that although the appellants' present proffer falls shy of the direct evidence threshold, it is possible that they might adduce further evidence at trial that would warrant the district court in concluding that mixed-motive analysis is appropriate and in framing its jury instructions accordingly. See Starceski v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"696210\"><a href=\"/opinion/696210/john-d-starceski-at-no-94-3208-v-westinghouse-electric-corporation-at/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1089</span></a></span>, 1098 (3d Cir. 1995); Ostrowski, 968 F.2d at 181. Although we take no view of the likelihood of this possibility materializing, our decision today does not foreclose it.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
