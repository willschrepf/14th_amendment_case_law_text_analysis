Board of Education), 349 U.S. 294, 75 S.Ct. 753; this case was based on the so-called \"separate but equal\" doctrine announced in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 16 S. Ct. 1138, 41 L.Ed. 256. The district court treated the case as if it presented only fact issues involving no necessity for deciding the constitutionality of any provision of Louisiana law. Tureaud v. Board of Supervisors, etc., D.C., 116 F. Supp. 248. On first appeal, the majority of this Court, one judge dissenting, held that the district judge was without jurisdiction to hear and determine the application for injunction, and that a three judge court was required under Section 2281 of Title 28, United States Code. Board of Supervisors, etc. v. Tureaud, 5 Cir., 207 F.2d 807. The Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated the judgment of this Court, and remanded the case to this Court, and remanded the case to this Court for consideration in the light of the Segregation Cases decided May 17, 1954, Brown v. Board of Education, etc., 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873, and conditions that now prevail, 347 U.S. 971, 74 S.Ct. 784, 98 L.Ed. 1112; thereby, we think, necessarily holding that the matters for consideration and decision were within the jurisdiction of this Court and of the one-judge district court from which it came. This Court, therefore, remanded the case to the district court for consideration in the light of the Segregation Cases and conditions that now prevail. Though appellants insist otherwise in brief, the record does not disclose that upon remand any additional evidence was offered. The district court having theretofore made full findings of fact and conclusions of law, 116 F.Supp. 248, again restrained and enjoined the respondents, appellants, \"pending the determination of this action, from refusing on account of race or color to admit the plaintiff, and any other Negro citizen of the state similarly qualified and situated, to the Junior Division of Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College for the purpose of pursuing the combined arts and sciences and law course offered by the University.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Gebhart v.

Per Curiam: The petitions for writs of certiorari are granted. The judgments are vacated and the cases are remanded for consideration in the light of the Segregation Cases decided May 17, 1954, Brown v. Board of Education [349 U.S. at page] 483 [74 S.Ct. 686] <i>and conditions that now prevail.</i>\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mandate from the Supreme Court to this court contained the same language as the judgment of the Supreme Court. After reciting the vacation of the judgment theretofore entered by this court, the mandate contained these words:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"And it is further ordered that this cause be and same is hereby remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit for <i>consideration</i> in the light of the Seggregation Cases decided May 17, 1954, Brown v.

The District Court did not comply with that mandate, but ignored it. That Court merely heard the legal argument on the motion to reinstate the injunction, addressed obviously to the number of judges which should constitute the court, took it under advisement and sustained it without receiving or considering any evidence at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority opinion seems to sanction that procedure, citing the Gebhart case<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> as the basis therefor. I cannot follow that reasoning. If the Supreme Court had intended that appellee should be admitted to L.S.U.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> without further hearing, it would logically have reversed our judgment and entered an order reinstating the judgment of the District Court which had ordered such admission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But it did not do that. Instead, it ordered a <i>consideration</i> of appellee's case \"in the light of conditions that now prevail\". To approve what the court below did is to treat that language as if it had not been used. That could be done only upon the assumption that the most vital provision in the Supreme Court's order was the product of inadvertence. Since we used the same words in our mandate to the court below we would convict this court also of inserting words in a solemn legal document which were entirely devoid of meaning or significance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) The motion to reinstate the preliminary injunction did not assign any grounds and did not attach any affidavits or refer to any testimony which had been or was being served under the Rules of Procedure, 28 U.S.C., and contained only this language: \"Plaintiff * * * moves the court to reinstate its temporary or preliminary injunction issued herein against the defendants on September 11, 1953\".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants (appellants) filed an elaborate opposition to the granting of the motion, and the parties proceeded to argue it without any testimony at all, and the court entered an order reinstating the preliminary injunction in these words:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"This cause came on at a former date to be heard on the motion of the plaintiff to reinstate the preliminary injunction issued herein on September 11, 1953, and <i>was argued by counsel</i> for the respective parties and submitted, when the court took time to consider;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Now, on due consideration thereof, it is ordered by the court that the motion of the plaintiff to reinstate the preliminary injunction issued herein on September 11, 1953 be and the same is hereby granted.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear that the District Court did not hear any evidence and did not give consideration to, or make any finding in response to, the order and mandate of the Supreme Court and the mandate of this Court that it consider the case in the light of \"conditions that now prevail\".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority opinion mentions that the record does not reflect that appellants introduced any evidence on the motion before the District Court. Through their counsel they stated in their briefs and in oral argument before this court that they offered to introduce evidence and asked to be permitted the opportunity to introduce evidence on that subject. This statement was not denied by appellee, and there is no reason that it should be questioned. The fact is that the handling of the case by the District Court shows that it was handled as if a matter of law only was involved, no reporter was present, and none of the proceedings were taken down or transcribed. It is not conceived that the District Court could escape the duty to <i>consider</i> \"conditions that now prevail\" on so technical a ground as that mentioned in the majority opinion. The order of the Supreme Court and its mandate made it clear that it was introducing an entirely new ingredient into the case and was commanding that the District Court consider evidence with respect to it. The District Court had no jurisdiction to dispose of the case in any manner except in strict obedience to the command of the Supreme Court and of this court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the position taken in the majority opinion which implies that appellants should not be heard because they failed to introduce evidence before the District Court cannot find support in the Rules of Procedure. If the case is to be considered on so technical a basis, it is clear that the appellants were never called upon to introduce any proof because appellee, whose motion was under consideration, had introduced none.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellee was required by Rule 7(b) (1) F.R.C.P. to serve and file a \"motion which * * * shall <i>state with particularity the grounds therefor</i>\". The Rules further provide<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> that no preliminary injunction shall be issued without notice, and that affidavits shall be served five days before the hearing if the motion is to be heard upon affidavits<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>. Finally, the District Court was forbidden to issue this interlocutory injunction without setting forth the grounds thereof:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> \"* * * and in granting or refusing interlocutory injunctions the court <i>shall similarly set forth</i> the findings of fact and conclusions of law which constitute the grounds of its action\".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court, therefore, committed clear error in failing to follow the mandate which alone gave it jurisdiction, in failing to hear evidence on \"conditions that now prevail\", and in failing to obey the strict requirements of the statute that findings of fact and conclusions of law be set forth as the grounds for issuance of a preliminary injunction. This last error will be discussed further in IV, <i>infra.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The meaning and import of the Supreme Court's language commanding that the case be \"considered * * * in the light * * * of conditions now prevailing\" is made manifest by the actions taken and the language used in the Segregation Cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After contrasting the development of public education generally in the North and the South at the time the Fourteenth Amendment became effective, and pointing out that \"in the South, the movement toward free common schools, supported by general taxation, had not yet taken hold. Education of white children was largely in the hands of private groups. Education of Negroes was almost nonexistent, and practically all of the race were illiterate. In fact, any education of Negroes was forbidden by law in some states\", the Supreme Court, in its original decision in the Segregation Cases,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> stated this:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Because these are class actions, because of the wide applicability of this decision, and because of the great variety of local conditions, the formulation of decrees in these cases presents problems of considerable complexity. * * * In order that we may have the full assistance of the parties in formulating decrees, the cases will be restored to the docket, and the parties are requested to present further argument on Questions 4 and 5 previously propounded by the Court for the reargument this term. * * * The attorneys general of the states requiring or permitting segregation in public education will also be permitted to appear amici curiae * * *.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the expiration of a year and two weeks the Supreme Court rendered its second opinion<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> ordering that the courts which originally heard the cases should be given the responsibility of carrying out the principles enunciated. Here we bring together excerpts from the opinion:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Because these cases arose under different local conditions and <i>their disposition will involve a variety of local problems,</i> we requested further argument on the question of relief. * * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Full implementation of these constitutional principles may require solution of <i>varied local school problems.</i> School authorities have the primary responsibility for elucidating, assessing, and solving these problems * * *. Because of their <i>proximity to local conditions</i> and the possible need for further hearings, the courts which originally heard these cases <i>can best perform this judicial appraisal.</i> Accordingly, we believe it appropriate to remand the cases to those courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"In fashioning and effectuating the decrees, the courts will be guided by equitable principles. Traditionally, equity has been characterized by a practical flexibility in shaping its remedies and by a <i>facility for adjusting and reconciling public and private needs.</i> These cases call for the exercise of these traditional attributes of equity power.\" 349 U.S. at pages 298, 299-303, 75 S.Ct. at pages 755, 756.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Those cases and the opinions written in them are binding upon the parties to them under the factual situations involved. They deal with applicants for admission to graded schools, elementary and high. The principles enunciated, however, give guidance to other courts dealing with other cases. It was the duty of the court below to deal with this case in the light of the principles stated in these opinions as they clarified and made manifest the provisions of the mandate directing consideration by the court below of conditions now prevailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear that the court below was required to hold a hearing and ascertain the conditions \"now prevailing.\" It was not enough that the facilities provided for plaintiff, a Negro youth, were not equal to those provided for white people. There must be a further hearing to ascertain the impact of a decree upon plaintiff's rights, upon the situation now maintaining at the school he was attending at the time his suit was instituted, upon L. S. U., and upon the interests of the public generally. The holding of a proper balance between all of these rights and interests called for judicial statesmanship of the highest order. To fail to respond to that call amounted to an abandonment of the judicial function.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not sufficient to say that this case arose under the \"old so-called `separate but equal' doctrine\". So did State ex rel. Hawkins v. Board of Control of Florida,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> but the Supreme Court entered the same order in that case requiring a hearing on conditions then prevailing. Moreover, Muir v. Louisville Park Theatrical Association<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> involved whether Negroes should be admitted to theatrical performances in a public park. The Supreme Court sent that case back for consideration of the same \"conditions as they now prevail\".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear, therefore, that the purpose of the Supreme Court thus specified requires that every case involving segregation shall include as one of the questions presented for decision \"conditions prevailing\" at the time of its hearing as they relate to the plaintiff and his rights, the schools and their problems, and the public and its welfare.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is further clear that the performance of this important function, the striking of this delicate balance, was deliberately committed to courts in the respective localities, acquainted with local conditions, and alive and responsive to local problems and sentiment. Having given long consideration to the other suggested methods, the Supreme Court selected the course best suited to a sane resolution of the complex problems involved and committed the effectuation of the policies announced to the benign aegis of local action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> The District Court here made no effort to apply those teachings of the Supreme Court or to carry out the mandate of this court. It was commanded to give that consideration, and it failed to do so, and it committed error in a matter of very great importance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) We are next confronted with the question whether the court below erred in refusing to convene a Three-Judge Court pursuant to the decision of the case by this court on former appeal and the mandate requiring such action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> The majority thinks that the court below properly heard the case, without calling in two other judges, on the ground that this litigation does not involve the construction of the Constitution or any statute of the State of Louisiana, but merely the action of a Board proceeding without reliance upon the sanction of any statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If this record made that clear, I would agree with the majority position on this point. The statute<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> creating Three-Judge Courts applies, under its terms, only to intervention by a federal court in state affairs where the state official claims to be acting in obedience to the state constitution or statutes. But that statute makes it crystal clear that an injunction issued by a federal court in derogation of the statute is void and, therefore unenforceable. \"An interlocutory or permanent <i>injunction * * * restraining the action of any officer of such State</i> in the enforcement or execution of such statute * * * <i>shall not be granted</i> by any district court or judge thereof upon the ground of the unconstitutionality of such statute * * *.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A proper safeguarding of the rights of the states requires that the present proceedings be examined carefully to determine whether the factors embraced within the statutory provisions are present here. Unfortunately the record does not disclose with accuracy the true situation with respect to that crucial point. Appellee has taken the position at times that the action is one to restrain enforcement of the Louisiana Constitution, and at other times has taken the opposite position. If the action does assail steps taken by the state officials of Louisiana, acting under color of authority of its Constitution or statutes, it is too clear for argument that a Three-Judge Court must be convened and that any injunction sought to be issued without that protection to the rights of the states would be a complete nullity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court confirmed that the statute meant what it said in Stratton v.

Pending the application for an interlocutory injunction, a single judge may grant a restraining order to be enforced until the hearing of the application, but thereafter, so far as enjoining the state officers, <i>his power is exhausted.</i> The wording of the section leaves no doubt that Congress was by provisions <i>ex industria</i> seeking to make <i>interference</i> by interlocutory injunction from a federal court <i>with the enforcement of state legislation</i> regularly enacted and in course of execution, a matter of the adequate hearing and the full deliberation which the presence of three judges, one of whom should be a Circuit Justice or Judge, was likely to secure.

United States, 312 U.S. 246, 61 S.Ct. 480, 85 L.Ed. 800, a case in which the state officials threatened to engage in conduct which <i>state law could not reasonably be construed to authorize.</i>\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As stated, appellee relies upon this line of cases holding that a District Judge may look to the complaint and ascertain whether the complaint charges substantially that the statute behind the officers' action is unconstitutional; if the complaint fails to state a case of unconstitutionality, a federal question is not raised, and a single judge may dismiss the complaint. That is quite a different course of action from the one here invited where a single district judge is called upon to strike down a state statute as unconstitutional. He has no jurisdiction to do that.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) The law being thus plain, it remains but to test whether this action substantially involves an effort to prevent the enforcement by the Board of Supervisors of the Constitution or statutes of Louisiana. According to appellee's complaint, his argument before this court on the former appeal, and his argument on the present appeal, he does attack action by that Board as being under color of the Lousiana Constitution. Under the argument made by appellee in his Petition for Certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States following our former decision,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a> and a portion of the oral argument presented in this hearing, appellee is making no such attack. Under those circumstances it is likely that the factual situation can be stabilized and understood only if clarified at the hearing by the District Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily the averments of the complaint control what is involved in a civil action. \"The existence of a substantial question of constitutionality must be determined by the allegations of the bill of complaint.

This is an action for an interlocutory injunction and a permanent injunction restraining the action of officers of the State of Louisiana in the enforcement of statutes of the State of Louisiana * *.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the complaint also points out, as the constitutional provision under which the action is obviously brought, Article XII, Section 1 of the Constitution of Louisiana of 1921, LSA, providing: \"Separate free public schools shall be maintained for the education of white and colored children between the ages of six and eighteen years\". It is doubtful if the averments of the complaint demonstrate clearly that this constitutional provision applies to appellee. Nevertheless, appellee manifestly contended from the outset that it did so apply, and resisted vigorously the effort of appellants on the former appeal to induce this court to hold that, under the complaint, the provisions of 28 U.S.C.A. &#167; 2281 should be followed and a three-judge court convened for the hearing of the case. Of course, that is what we did hold on the former appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After we had held that the court below committed error in not following the prayer of the complaint and organizing a three-judge court, appellee reversed his position in his Petition for Certiorari to the Supreme Court. The entire burden of that petition and the argument presented with it was that appellee had abandoned his claim as set forth in his complaint after the District Judge had held otherwise. Here is appellee's attitude as taken before the Supreme Court of the United States in his Petition for Certiorari:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The District Judge, however, taking the view that a three judge court was not required, ordered the case set down for hearing before him sitting alone. Petitioner abandoned his claim to a hearing before a specially constituted federal court as required under Title 28 U.S.C., Section 2281, and proceeded without protest to a hearing on the motion for preliminary injunction. No proof tending to establish a claim of the unconstitutionality of segregation <i>per se</i> was submitted. Rather the evidence dealt solely with whether the educational opportunities, offerings and facilities at Southern University, the state supported institution of higher learning for Negroes, were equal or substantially equal to those available at Louisiana State University.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellee specified error in his Petition for Certiorari, claiming that this court had erred in holding that he \"had not waived and abandoned his right to a hearing before a District Court of three judges\". Within the ambit of that petition alone, the conclusion is inescapable that appellants had not acted pursuant to the Louisiana Constitution in denying appellee entrance to L.S.U., and, therefore, a three-judge court was not called for.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But, under the inconsistent positions above outlined, we are not permitted to limit our consideration to the position taken by appellee in his Petition for Certiorari. Moreover, in his printed brief before this court in the present hearing, appellee argues that the decision of the lower court ought to be affirmed because he claims, in part, that the entire state policy as fixed by the Louisiana Constitution is in violation of the federal Constitution, and thus he brings himself squarely back under the provisions of 28 U.S.C.A. &#167; 2281. This excerpt from his brief sets forth this attitude: \"There is no longer any doubt that a state policy maintaining largely segregated public educational facilities is contrary to the constitutional mandate of the Fourteenth Amendment. * * * The Supreme Court has settled the question and the lower federal courts must now follow the Supreme Court's formula.\" That position is sought to be supported by the Phillips case and the other cases listed in Note 25 supra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not possible, therefore, to determine with any degree of certainty whether the pleadings and the written statements of appellee do actually seek to stop by injunction state action on the part of appellants essaying to act under the protection of the Louisiana Constitution. We have recently given expression to the universal rule that \"`cases are generally to be tried on the proofs rather than the pleadings'\",<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a> and this brings us to the error of the court below which pervades all the others &#8212; its failure to enter findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 52(a) F.R.C.P. reads in part as follows: \"In all actions tried upon the facts without a jury or with an advisory jury, the court shall find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon and direct the entry of appropriate judgment; and in <i>granting</i> or refusing <i>interlocutory injunctions</i> the court <i>shall similarly set forth</i> the findings of fact and conclusions of law which constitute the <i>grounds of its action.</i>\" In granting the interlocutory injunction which forms the subject of this appeal, the court below did not follow the plain requirements of that rule.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a> At the very least, therefore, we should reverse its judgment and remand for compliance with this rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The findings and conclusions of the court below would have to encompass all of the issues involved in the case as presented by the pleadings. Our reversal on the former appeal was a general reversal, and the Supreme Court merely vacated that judgment. If the Supreme Court had thought that the District Court had nothing but the perfunctory duty of reinstating the injunction, it would have been simple to reverse our decision with directions that the judgment of the District Court be reinstated. But the Supreme Court did not do that. The entire case was sent back to this court and by us to the District Court, and it was the duty of that court to proceed to a full consideration of all issues, and to enter its findings and conclusions on the entire case. We expressed the general rule in Roth v. Hyer, 5 Cir., 1944, 142 F.2d 227, the eighth syllabus, reading thus:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Generally, when a case is reversed and remanded for further proceedings, it goes back to trial court on all issues as if former trial had not taken place, in absence of direction limiting new trial to particular issues\".<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present situation, of course, there is all the greater reason for findings by the District Court. The issue is a broader issue than when it was presented to the lower court before. The District Court is now called upon to consider questions of policy as well as of law, to bring to bear upon the perplexing problems of this case the thinking and the point of view of the section where the court sits; and to enter a decree representing at once justice to appellee and justice to L. S. U. and preserving the welfare and best interests of all of the citizens of the section to which the controversy belongs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It may be that appellee will stand to the position he took in his Petition for Certiorari to the Supreme Court and upon which he got the case sent back, and may amend his pleadings so as to disavow authoritatively any attack upon action of state officers based upon constitutional mandate. Such a binding declaration would dispose of at least the one problem of the three-judge court, which, without it, must remain in the case. The trial court has ample powers to require appellee to state his position with certitude.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Findings by the District Court are of unusual importance here also, because a new question of paramount importance is presented upon which the parties and the public generally are entitled to be enlightened and instructed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority pretermits all of these questions. To do so, in my opinion, is to disregard the mandate of the Supreme Court and to fail to accept and perform the responsibility which is ours.

The Supreme Court vacated the judgment of this Court, not that of the district court. We simply remanded the case to the district court for consideration in the light of the segregation cases and conditions that now prevail. The district court had already conducted a full hearing at which all of the evidence offered by either party had been received, and thereafter the court had made complete, and even elaborate, findings of fact and conclusions of law. See 116 F.Supp. 248. It is not my understanding that all of that had to be repeated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to whether a three-judge district court was required, my views were expressed in a dissenting opinion on the first appeal in this case, 207 F.2d 810, et seq. As there shown, a three-judge court is authorized only when the claim of unconstitutionality presents a substantial federal question. It has long been settled that a question of constitutionality may be plainly unsubstantial \"because `its unsoundness so clearly results from the previous decisions of this court as to foreclose the subject and leave no room for the inference that the question sought to be raised can be the subject of controversy.' Levering &amp; Garrigues Co. v. Morrin, supra [289 U.S. 103, 105]; 53 S.Ct. 549; Hannis Distilling Co. v. Baltimore, 216 U.S. 285, 288, 30 S.Ct. 326, 54 L.Ed. 482; McGilvra v. Ross, 215 U. S. 70, 80, 30 S.Ct. 27, 54 L.Ed. 95.\" Ex Parte Poresky, 290 U.S. 30, 32, 54 S.Ct. 3, 4, 78 L.Ed. 152. A federal question may become unsubstantial by virtue of an intervening Supreme Court decision, California Water Service Co. v. Redding, 304 U.S. 252, 255, 58 S.Ct. 865, 82 L.Ed. 1323. The Supreme Court has now made its meaning unmistakably clear that it had declared \"the fundamental principle that racial discrimination in public education is unconstitutional,\" and that, \"All provisions of federal, state, or local law requiring or permitting such discrimination must yield to this principle.\" Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294, 298, 75 S.Ct. 753, 755. After that decision, coupled with the earlier opinion that, \"Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal\", Gebhart v. Belton, 347 U.S. 485, 74 S.Ct. 692, it seems to me that no substantial federal question is presented as to the unconstitutionality of the provision of the Louisiana State Constitution reading:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Separate free public schools shall be maintained for the education of white and colored children between the ages of six and eighteen years.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has already passed on the question. The federal question presented is no longer \"one which requires analysis and exposition for its decision,\" and it is therefore frivolous. Milheim v. Moffat Tunnel District, 262 U.S. 710, 716, 45 S.Ct. 694, 696, 67 L.Ed. 1194.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The meaning of the general expression, \"conditions that now prevail\" is made more explicit, I think, by the subsequent opinion of the Supreme Court formulating the decrees in the Segregation Cases. Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294, 299, 300, 301, 75 S.Ct. 753. \"Conditions that now prevail\" are well known in a general way, and certainly there is no presumption that judges are less informed than other persons. The Supreme Court did not require that testimony be taken in all cases as to such conditions. Hearings of such breadth could well become interminable. A large measure of discretion, coupled with recognition of judicial knowledge, must be vested in the district judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The doctrine of \"separate but equal\" was displaced because the Supreme Court held that, \"Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.\" 347 U.S. 495, 74 S.Ct. 688. If such facilities are actually unequal in other ways in addition to being separate, then we judicially know, certainly in the case of a college as distinguished from the grade public schools, that there are no \"conditions that now prevail\" which would authorize denying equal opportunities to all students, regardless of race. Otherwise to construe the meaning of the term would be to hold that the Supreme Court placed obstacles in the path of Negro students in addition to those they already faced under the \"separate but equal\" doctrine, that it turned the clock backward instead of forward. I think that the judgment of the district court was right.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

The District Court did not comply with that mandate, but ignored it. That Court merely heard the legal argument on the motion to reinstate the injunction, addressed obviously to the number of judges which should constitute the court, took it under advisement and sustained it without receiving or considering any evidence at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority opinion seems to sanction that procedure, citing the Gebhart case<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> as the basis therefor. I cannot follow that reasoning. If the Supreme Court had intended that appellee should be admitted to L.S.U.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> without further hearing, it would logically have reversed our judgment and entered an order reinstating the judgment of the District Court which had ordered such admission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But it did not do that. Instead, it ordered a <i>consideration</i> of appellee's case \"in the light of conditions that now prevail\". To approve what the court below did is to treat that language as if it had not been used. That could be done only upon the assumption that the most vital provision in the Supreme Court's order was the product of inadvertence. Since we used the same words in our mandate to the court below we would convict this court also of inserting words in a solemn legal document which were entirely devoid of meaning or significance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) The motion to reinstate the preliminary injunction did not assign any grounds and did not attach any affidavits or refer to any testimony which had been or was being served under the Rules of Procedure, 28 U.S.C., and contained only this language: \"Plaintiff * * * moves the court to reinstate its temporary or preliminary injunction issued herein against the defendants on September 11, 1953\".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants (appellants) filed an elaborate opposition to the granting of the motion, and the parties proceeded to argue it without any testimony at all, and the court entered an order reinstating the preliminary injunction in these words:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"This cause came on at a former date to be heard on the motion of the plaintiff to reinstate the preliminary injunction issued herein on September 11, 1953, and <i>was argued by counsel</i> for the respective parties and submitted, when the court took time to consider;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Now, on due consideration thereof, it is ordered by the court that the motion of the plaintiff to reinstate the preliminary injunction issued herein on September 11, 1953 be and the same is hereby granted.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear that the District Court did not hear any evidence and did not give consideration to, or make any finding in response to, the order and mandate of the Supreme Court and the mandate of this Court that it consider the case in the light of \"conditions that now prevail\".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority opinion mentions that the record does not reflect that appellants introduced any evidence on the motion before the District Court. Through their counsel they stated in their briefs and in oral argument before this court that they offered to introduce evidence and asked to be permitted the opportunity to introduce evidence on that subject. This statement was not denied by appellee, and there is no reason that it should be questioned. The fact is that the handling of the case by the District Court shows that it was handled as if a matter of law only was involved, no reporter was present, and none of the proceedings were taken down or transcribed. It is not conceived that the District Court could escape the duty to <i>consider</i> \"conditions that now prevail\" on so technical a ground as that mentioned in the majority opinion. The order of the Supreme Court and its mandate made it clear that it was introducing an entirely new ingredient into the case and was commanding that the District Court consider evidence with respect to it. The District Court had no jurisdiction to dispose of the case in any manner except in strict obedience to the command of the Supreme Court and of this court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the position taken in the majority opinion which implies that appellants should not be heard because they failed to introduce evidence before the District Court cannot find support in the Rules of Procedure. If the case is to be considered on so technical a basis, it is clear that the appellants were never called upon to introduce any proof because appellee, whose motion was under consideration, had introduced none.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellee was required by Rule 7(b) (1) F.R.C.P. to serve and file a \"motion which * * * shall <i>state with particularity the grounds therefor</i>\". The Rules further provide<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> that no preliminary injunction shall be issued without notice, and that affidavits shall be served five days before the hearing if the motion is to be heard upon affidavits<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>. Finally, the District Court was forbidden to issue this interlocutory injunction without setting forth the grounds thereof:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> \"* * * and in granting or refusing interlocutory injunctions the court <i>shall similarly set forth</i> the findings of fact and conclusions of law which constitute the grounds of its action\".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court, therefore, committed clear error in failing to follow the mandate which alone gave it jurisdiction, in failing to hear evidence on \"conditions that now prevail\", and in failing to obey the strict requirements of the statute that findings of fact and conclusions of law be set forth as the grounds for issuance of a preliminary injunction. This last error will be discussed further in IV, <i>infra.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The meaning and import of the Supreme Court's language commanding that the case be \"considered * * * in the light * * * of conditions now prevailing\" is made manifest by the actions taken and the language used in the Segregation Cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After contrasting the development of public education generally in the North and the South at the time the Fourteenth Amendment became effective, and pointing out that \"in the South, the movement toward free common schools, supported by general taxation, had not yet taken hold.

In fact, any education of Negroes was forbidden by law in some states\", the Supreme Court, in its original decision in the Segregation Cases,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> stated this:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Because these are class actions, because of the wide applicability of this decision, and because of the great variety of local conditions, the formulation of decrees in these cases presents problems of considerable complexity. * * * In order that we may have the full assistance of the parties in formulating decrees, the cases will be restored to the docket, and the parties are requested to present further argument on Questions 4 and 5 previously propounded by the Court for the reargument this term. * * * The attorneys general of the states requiring or permitting segregation in public education will also be permitted to appear amici curiae * * *.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the expiration of a year and two weeks the Supreme Court rendered its second opinion<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> ordering that the courts which originally heard the cases should be given the responsibility of carrying out the principles enunciated. Here we bring together excerpts from the opinion:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Because these cases arose under different local conditions and <i>their disposition will involve a variety of local problems,</i> we requested further argument on the question of relief. * * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Full implementation of these constitutional principles may require solution of <i>varied local school problems.</i> School authorities have the primary responsibility for elucidating, assessing, and solving these problems * * *.

Traditionally, equity has been characterized by a practical flexibility in shaping its remedies and by a <i>facility for adjusting and reconciling public and private needs.</i> These cases call for the exercise of these traditional attributes of equity power.\" 349 U.S. at pages 298, 299-303, 75 S.Ct. at pages 755, 756.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Those cases and the opinions written in them are binding upon the parties to them under the factual situations involved. They deal with applicants for admission to graded schools, elementary and high. The principles enunciated, however, give guidance to other courts dealing with other cases. It was the duty of the court below to deal with this case in the light of the principles stated in these opinions as they clarified and made manifest the provisions of the mandate directing consideration by the court below of conditions now prevailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear that the court below was required to hold a hearing and ascertain the conditions \"now prevailing.\" It was not enough that the facilities provided for plaintiff, a Negro youth, were not equal to those provided for white people. There must be a further hearing to ascertain the impact of a decree upon plaintiff's rights, upon the situation now maintaining at the school he was attending at the time his suit was instituted, upon L. S. U., and upon the interests of the public generally. The holding of a proper balance between all of these rights and interests called for judicial statesmanship of the highest order. To fail to respond to that call amounted to an abandonment of the judicial function.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not sufficient to say that this case arose under the \"old so-called `separate but equal' doctrine\". So did State ex rel. Hawkins v. Board of Control of Florida,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> but the Supreme Court entered the same order in that case requiring a hearing on conditions then prevailing. Moreover, Muir v. Louisville Park Theatrical Association<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> involved whether Negroes should be admitted to theatrical performances in a public park. The Supreme Court sent that case back for consideration of the same \"conditions as they now prevail\".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear, therefore, that the purpose of the Supreme Court thus specified requires that every case involving segregation shall include as one of the questions presented for decision \"conditions prevailing\" at the time of its hearing as they relate to the plaintiff and his rights, the schools and their problems, and the public and its welfare.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is further clear that the performance of this important function, the striking of this delicate balance, was deliberately committed to courts in the respective localities, acquainted with local conditions, and alive and responsive to local problems and sentiment. Having given long consideration to the other suggested methods, the Supreme Court selected the course best suited to a sane resolution of the complex problems involved and committed the effectuation of the policies announced to the benign aegis of local action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> The District Court here made no effort to apply those teachings of the Supreme Court or to carry out the mandate of this court. It was commanded to give that consideration, and it failed to do so, and it committed error in a matter of very great importance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) We are next confronted with the question whether the court below erred in refusing to convene a Three-Judge Court pursuant to the decision of the case by this court on former appeal and the mandate requiring such action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> The majority thinks that the court below properly heard the case, without calling in two other judges, on the ground that this litigation does not involve the construction of the Constitution or any statute of the State of Louisiana, but merely the action of a Board proceeding without reliance upon the sanction of any statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If this record made that clear, I would agree with the majority position on this point. The statute<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> creating Three-Judge Courts applies, under its terms, only to intervention by a federal court in state affairs where the state official claims to be acting in obedience to the state constitution or statutes. But that statute makes it crystal clear that an injunction issued by a federal court in derogation of the statute is void and, therefore unenforceable. \"An interlocutory or permanent <i>injunction * * * restraining the action of any officer of such State</i> in the enforcement or execution of such statute * * * <i>shall not be granted</i> by any district court or judge thereof upon the ground of the unconstitutionality of such statute * * *.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A proper safeguarding of the rights of the states requires that the present proceedings be examined carefully to determine whether the factors embraced within the statutory provisions are present here. Unfortunately the record does not disclose with accuracy the true situation with respect to that crucial point. Appellee has taken the position at times that the action is one to restrain enforcement of the Louisiana Constitution, and at other times has taken the opposite position. If the action does assail steps taken by the state officials of Louisiana, acting under color of authority of its Constitution or statutes, it is too clear for argument that a Three-Judge Court must be convened and that any injunction sought to be issued without that protection to the rights of the states would be a complete nullity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court confirmed that the statute meant what it said in Stratton v.

That is quite a different course of action from the one here invited where a single district judge is called upon to strike down a state statute as unconstitutional. He has no jurisdiction to do that.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) The law being thus plain, it remains but to test whether this action substantially involves an effort to prevent the enforcement by the Board of Supervisors of the Constitution or statutes of Louisiana. According to appellee's complaint, his argument before this court on the former appeal, and his argument on the present appeal, he does attack action by that Board as being under color of the Lousiana Constitution. Under the argument made by appellee in his Petition for Certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States following our former decision,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a> and a portion of the oral argument presented in this hearing, appellee is making no such attack.

This is an action for an interlocutory injunction and a permanent injunction restraining the action of officers of the State of Louisiana in the enforcement of statutes of the State of Louisiana * *.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the complaint also points out, as the constitutional provision under which the action is obviously brought, Article XII, Section 1 of the Constitution of Louisiana of 1921, LSA, providing: \"Separate free public schools shall be maintained for the education of white and colored children between the ages of six and eighteen years\". It is doubtful if the averments of the complaint demonstrate clearly that this constitutional provision applies to appellee. Nevertheless, appellee manifestly contended from the outset that it did so apply, and resisted vigorously the effort of appellants on the former appeal to induce this court to hold that, under the complaint, the provisions of 28 U.S.C.A. &#167; 2281 should be followed and a three-judge court convened for the hearing of the case. Of course, that is what we did hold on the former appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After we had held that the court below committed error in not following the prayer of the complaint and organizing a three-judge court, appellee reversed his position in his Petition for Certiorari to the Supreme Court. The entire burden of that petition and the argument presented with it was that appellee had abandoned his claim as set forth in his complaint after the District Judge had held otherwise. Here is appellee's attitude as taken before the Supreme Court of the United States in his Petition for Certiorari:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The District Judge, however, taking the view that a three judge court was not required, ordered the case set down for hearing before him sitting alone. Petitioner abandoned his claim to a hearing before a specially constituted federal court as required under Title 28 U.S.C., Section 2281, and proceeded without protest to a hearing on the motion for preliminary injunction. No proof tending to establish a claim of the unconstitutionality of segregation <i>per se</i> was submitted. Rather the evidence dealt solely with whether the educational opportunities, offerings and facilities at Southern University, the state supported institution of higher learning for Negroes, were equal or substantially equal to those available at Louisiana State University.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellee specified error in his Petition for Certiorari, claiming that this court had erred in holding that he \"had not waived and abandoned his right to a hearing before a District Court of three judges\". Within the ambit of that petition alone, the conclusion is inescapable that appellants had not acted pursuant to the Louisiana Constitution in denying appellee entrance to L.S.U., and, therefore, a three-judge court was not called for.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But, under the inconsistent positions above outlined, we are not permitted to limit our consideration to the position taken by appellee in his Petition for Certiorari. Moreover, in his printed brief before this court in the present hearing, appellee argues that the decision of the lower court ought to be affirmed because he claims, in part, that the entire state policy as fixed by the Louisiana Constitution is in violation of the federal Constitution, and thus he brings himself squarely back under the provisions of 28 U.S.C.A. &#167; 2281. This excerpt from his brief sets forth this attitude: \"There is no longer any doubt that a state policy maintaining largely segregated public educational facilities is contrary to the constitutional mandate of the Fourteenth Amendment. * * * The Supreme Court has settled the question and the lower federal courts must now follow the Supreme Court's formula.\" That position is sought to be supported by the Phillips case and the other cases listed in Note 25 supra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not possible, therefore, to determine with any degree of certainty whether the pleadings and the written statements of appellee do actually seek to stop by injunction state action on the part of appellants essaying to act under the protection of the Louisiana Constitution. We have recently given expression to the universal rule that \"`cases are generally to be tried on the proofs rather than the pleadings'\",<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a> and this brings us to the error of the court below which pervades all the others &#8212; its failure to enter findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 52(a) F.R.C.P. reads in part as follows: \"In all actions tried upon the facts without a jury or with an advisory jury, the court shall find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon and direct the entry of appropriate judgment; and in <i>granting</i> or refusing <i>interlocutory injunctions</i> the court <i>shall similarly set forth</i> the findings of fact and conclusions of law which constitute the <i>grounds of its action.</i>\" In granting the interlocutory injunction which forms the subject of this appeal, the court below did not follow the plain requirements of that rule.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a> At the very least, therefore, we should reverse its judgment and remand for compliance with this rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The findings and conclusions of the court below would have to encompass all of the issues involved in the case as presented by the pleadings. Our reversal on the former appeal was a general reversal, and the Supreme Court merely vacated that judgment. If the Supreme Court had thought that the District Court had nothing but the perfunctory duty of reinstating the injunction, it would have been simple to reverse our decision with directions that the judgment of the District Court be reinstated. But the Supreme Court did not do that. The entire case was sent back to this court and by us to the District Court, and it was the duty of that court to proceed to a full consideration of all issues, and to enter its findings and conclusions on the entire case. We expressed the general rule in Roth v. Hyer, 5 Cir., 1944, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1551170\"><a href=\"/opinion/1551170/roth-v-hyer/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></a></span>, the eighth syllabus, reading thus:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Generally, when a case is reversed and remanded for further proceedings, it goes back to trial court on all issues as if former trial had not taken place, in absence of direction limiting new trial to particular issues\".<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present situation, of course, there is all the greater reason for findings by the District Court. The issue is a broader issue than when it was presented to the lower court before. The District Court is now called upon to consider questions of policy as well as of law, to bring to bear upon the perplexing problems of this case the thinking and the point of view of the section where the court sits; and to enter a decree representing at once justice to appellee and justice to L. S. U. and preserving the welfare and best interests of all of the citizens of the section to which the controversy belongs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It may be that appellee will stand to the position he took in his Petition for Certiorari to the Supreme Court and upon which he got the case sent back, and may amend his pleadings so as to disavow authoritatively any attack upon action of state officers based upon constitutional mandate. Such a binding declaration would dispose of at least the one problem of the three-judge court, which, without it, must remain in the case. The trial court has ample powers to require appellee to state his position with certitude.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Findings by the District Court are of unusual importance here also, because a new question of paramount importance is presented upon which the parties and the public generally are entitled to be enlightened and instructed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority pretermits all of these questions. To do so, in my opinion, is to disregard the mandate of the Supreme Court and to fail to accept and perform the responsibility which is ours.

If such facilities are actually unequal in other ways in addition to being separate, then we judicially know, certainly in the case of a college as distinguished from the grade public schools, that there are no \"conditions that now prevail\" which would authorize denying equal opportunities to all students, regardless of race. Otherwise to construe the meaning of the term would be to hold that the Supreme Court placed obstacles in the path of Negro students in addition to those they already faced under the \"separate but equal\" doctrine, that it turned the clock backward instead of forward.
