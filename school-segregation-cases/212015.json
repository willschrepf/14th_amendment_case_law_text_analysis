(No. 1:96-cv-\n2313-RCF), Richard C. Freeman, Judge.\n\nBefore ANDERSON and BIRCH, Circuit Judges, and PAINE*, Senior District Judge.\n\n       BIRCH, Circuit Judge:\n\n       The Dekalb County School District (the \"School District\" or \"District\"), seeks to vacate a\n\npermanent injunction prohibiting it from transferring a teacher, John Doe, who is infected with HIV,\n\nthe virus that causes AIDS. The School District wishes to transfer Doe from a classroom of children\n\nwith severe behavioral disorders, because it fears that Doe might have blood-to-blood contact with\n\none of his sometimes-violent students, thereby transmitting HIV. After conducting a bench trial, the\n\ndistrict court granted Doe a permanent injunction under the Americans with Disabilities Act\n\n(\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., blocking his transfer. The School District, however, argues\n\nthat the district court failed to make adequate findings of fact regarding the effect of Doe's illness\n\non his qualifications and that Doe has not suffered an \"adverse employment action.\" We REVERSE,\n\nVACATE the injunction, and REMAND for further proceedings.\n\n                                        I. BACKGROUND\n\n\n   *\n     Honorable James C. Paine, Senior U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of Florida,\nsitting by designation.\n\f        The School District has three distinct levels of special education programs for children with\n\nsignificant behavioral disorders. First, the District maintains \"interrelated\" classrooms for students\n\nwith mild disorders; the District \"mainstreams\" these students for most of each school day. Second,\n\nthe District has \"self-contained\" classrooms for children who are too \"disordered\" to participate in\n\nthe interrelated program. Third, the District operates \"psychoeducation\" classrooms for students\n\nwith the most severe behavioral problems. From 1992 to 1995, John Doe was a teacher at the\n\nDistrict's Shadow Rock Psychoeducational Center (\"Shadow Rock\").1\n\n        Children enrolled in the District's psychoeducation classes are often aggressive. As the\n\nDistrict established at trial, these children frequently engage in acts of violence such as biting,\n\nhitting, scratching, and kicking. Some children also attempt to bring dangerous items such as razors\n\nto school or to attack their classmates or teachers with objects such as pencils. Because of these\n\npotential dangers, psychoeducation teachers must be able to physically restrain their pupils; for\n\nexample, a psychoeducation teacher may have to \"basket hold\" several students each day. Often,\n\nthese confrontations result in injuries to teachers. Although the number of scrapes and bruises\n\nsuffered by teachers is unclear, psychoeducation teachers commonly file workman's compensation\n\nclaims for significant injuries, and, at least once, a teacher has suffered a severe bite that drew blood\n\nand required medical attention.\n\n        In February 1995, Doe told Shadow Rock's principal that he was HIV-positive, and the\n\nprincipal in turn informed other school administrative personnel. Because District officials feared\n\nthat violence and subsequent blood-to-blood contact between Doe and one of his psychoeducation\n\n\n\n   1\n   Like the district court, we have allowed the plaintiff-appellee to proceed under the\npseudonym \"John Doe\" in order to protect his privacy.\n\n                                                   2\n\fstudents might lead to transmission of HIV, the District transferred Doe to an \"interrelated\"\n\nclassroom at a different school in April 1995. The parties dispute whether this transfer was\n\n\"voluntary\"; the District emphasizes that Doe signed a transfer form, while Doe argues that he had\n\nno choice but to sign and that he hoped that by doing so he might at least get to teach a\n\n\"self-contained\" rather than an \"interrelated\" class. While the district court's finding regarding this\n\npoint is somewhat unclear, the court appears to have concluded that the transfer was involuntary.\n\nIn any case, Doe spent the months after his transfer trying to convince the District to return him to\n\nhis psychoeducation class, or, as an alternative, to assign him to a group of \"self-contained\" children.\n\n        Although Doe would prefer to teach a psychoeducational rather than an interrelated class,\n\nhis transfer does not appear to represent a demotion. Doe's salary, benefits, and seniority all remain\n\nthe same. Doe also enjoys the same relative level of prestige within the school system and the larger\n\ncommunity. In addition, while Doe lacks a certificate from the State of Georgia in interrelated\n\nteaching, his transfer does not seem likely to render obsolete his investment in his own education.\n\nAlthough Doe's teaching experience has focused on psychoeducation, he does not have a particularly\n\nspecialized educational background. Doe holds a bachelor's degree in psychology from New York\n\nUniversity and a master's degree in special education from Georgia State University.\n\n        Doe, however, does have a Georgia certificate in psychoeducational teaching but not in\n\ninterrelated instruction. To obtain an interrelated certificate, Doe would have to complete ten credit\n\nhours of coursework. In order to reduce any inconvenience this additional study might pose to Doe,\n\nthe District has allowed Doe three years to become certified and promised to pay his educational\n\nexpenses. In addition, the District has suggested that Doe might be able to count his ten hours\n\nconcerning interrelated teaching toward the continuing education total that he would have to achieve\n\n\n                                                   3\n\fin any case to retain his current certification, though this point is not clear in the current record.\n\nEven without the interrelated certificate, Doe appears qualified to teach an interrelated class, since\n\nhis interrelated pupils suffer from the same sort of disorders as his previous psychoeducational\n\nstudents—his new students are just easier to teach because they are less prone to misbehavior. As\n\nDoe concedes, his new interrelated position is less stressful. Significantly, Doe also agrees with the\n\nDistrict that he will be more marketable as an interrelated teacher (once he obtains his certificate),\n\nwith more long-term career opportunities, than he was before his transfer.\n\n       On August 1, 1995, Doe learned from the District's Executive Director of Personnel that he\n\ncould not return to a psychoeducation setting or move to a self-contained classroom because of his\n\nHIV status. On August 3, 1995, Doe therefore timely filed a discrimination charge with the federal\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") alleging that the District was discriminating\n\nagainst him on the basis of his HIV disability. After the EEOC issued Doe a right-to-sue letter, he\n\nbrought this action in the district court under both the ADA and the Vocational Rehabilitation Act\n\n(\"VRA\") 29 U.S.C. § 791 et seq.\n\n       From July 28 through July 31, 1997, the district court held a bench trial on Doe's claims. On\n\nAugust 1, 1997, the district court ruled in Doe's favor and issued a short written order containing\n\nterse findings of fact and conclusions of law. After noting that the parties agreed that Doe's HIV\n\ninfection rendered him disabled, the district court found that \"[t]he risk that plaintiff will transmit\n\nHIV to students with severe behavior disorders, including children who are prone to bite, is remote\n\nand theoretical.\" R4-59 at 2, ¶ 11. The court also found that Doe had suffered an adverse\n\nemployment action. The district court, however, made no attempt to explain the basis for its\n\nconclusion regarding the risk of HIV transmission to Doe's psychoeducation students, nor did the\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fcourt offer any rationale for its assessment that Doe's transfer was \"adverse.\"2 Whatever its\n\nunderlying reasoning, the district court issued a permanent injunction under the ADA requiring the\n\nSchool District to reinstate Doe as a psychoeducational instructor.3\n\n                                          II. DISCUSSION\n\n        In order to prevail under the ADA, Doe must prove all three elements of his prima facie case\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence.4 First, he must show that he has a disability.5 Second, he must\n\ndemonstrate that he is qualified to serve as a psychoeducation teacher, with or without some\n\nreasonable accommodation by the District, despite his disability. Third, he must show that he has\n\nsuffered an adverse employment action because of his disability (i.e., that he has suffered\n\nemployment discrimination). See Harris v. H & W Contracting Co., 102 F.3d 516, 519, 523-24\n\n(11th Cir.1996) (discussing the elements of a prima facie case under the ADA).\n\n\n\n\n   2\n    The district court did list three findings of fact elsewhere in its order that it apparently\nthought were relevant to its holding that Doe's transfer was adverse. First, the district court\nfound that \"Plaintiff is certified to teach children with behavior disorders, and teaching in this\nfield has special meaning and significance to him.\" R4-59 at 1, ¶ 11. Second, the district court\nobserved that \"Plaintiff is not certified to teach in an interrelated program.\" Id. at 2, ¶ 7. Third,\nthe district court stated that \"Plaintiff did not wish to be moved from his classroom at Shadow\nRock....\" Id. at 2, ¶ 8.\n   3\n    The district court did not separately discuss Doe's VRA claim.\n   4\n     On appeal, Doe does not argue that we should read the VRA to provide him with any cause\nof action or form of relief that is unavailable under the ADA. In fact, Doe makes no arguments at\nall premised on the VRA. We, therefore, deem Doe's VRA claim to have been abandoned, and\nwe discuss his claim as if it arose solely under the ADA. See Allstate Ins. Co. v. Swann, 27 F.3d\n1539, 1542 (11th Cir.1994) (stating that issues not raised in a party's brief are considered\nabandoned).\n   5\n   A person who is infected with HIV is \"disabled\" for purposes of the ADA, even if he has not\ndeveloped AIDS. See Bragdon v. Abbott, --- U.S. ----, 118 S.Ct. 2196, --- L.Ed.2d ---- (1998).\n\n                                                   5\n\f        The School District contends that the district court made two critical errors in applying this\n\nframework. First, the District argues that the court did not properly find or balance relevant safety\n\nfactors regarding Doe's continued qualification for a psychoeducation position, as required by\n\nSchool Bd. of Nassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 107 S.Ct. 1123, 94 L.Ed.2d 307 (1987).\n\nSecond, the District maintains that its transfer of Doe was not an \"adverse employment action.\" We\n\nreview the district court's findings of fact for clear error and its analysis of law de novo. See\n\nFed.R.Civ.P. 52(a); Simmons v. Conger, 86 F.3d 1080, 1084 (11th Cir.1996).6 We address each of\n\nthe District's contentions in turn.\n\nA. WHETHER DOE IS QUALIFIED\n\n        In Arline, the Supreme Court considered whether a woman suffering from tuberculosis was\n\notherwise qualified to be an elementary schoolteacher. See generally Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 107\n\nS.Ct. 1123 (applying the VRA). Rather than establishing some arbitrary rule regarding the relevance\n\nof contagious disease to teaching qualifications, the Court insisted that district courts undertake\n\n\"individualized inquiry\" in each case. Id. at 287, 107 S.Ct. at 1130. This inquiry must include:\n\n        (a) the nature of the risk (how the disease is transmitted), (b) the duration of the risk (how\n        long is the carrier infectious), (c) the severity of the risk (what is the potential harm to third\n        parties), and (d) the probabilities the disease will be transmitted and will cause varying\n        degrees of harm.\n\nId. at 288, 107 S.Ct. at 1131 (quoting Amicus Curiae Brief of the American Medical Association\n\nat 19). In making these findings, a district court \"normally should defer to the reasonable medical\n\njudgments of public health officials.\" Id.\n\n\n\n   6\n    The School District concedes that, if Doe is disabled, is otherwise qualified, and has suffered\nan adverse employment action, then a permanent injunction prohibiting Doe's transfer based on\nhis HIV status would be appropriate.\n\n                                                    6\n\f        Once a district court has made the necessary medical findings, it must weigh the statutory\n\ngoal of ending disability-based discrimination against any legitimate concerns regarding \"significant\n\nhealth and safety risks.\" Id. If the court finds that, on balance, a plaintiff's disability would render\n\nhim unqualified for safety reasons, then the court must consider whether the employer can\n\n\"reasonably accommodate\" the plaintiff so that he can perform \"the essential functions\" of the job\n\nin question. Id. at 1131 & 1131 n. 17, 107 S.Ct. 1123 (quoting 45 C.F.R. § 84.3(k) (1985)). Finally,\n\nwhatever the district court's legal conclusion regarding a claim of disqualification due to safety\n\nconcerns, the court must make explicit both its findings of fact and its application of the law, so as\n\nto allow meaningful appellate review. See id.\n\n        In this case, the district court found, without explanation, that Doe's HIV infection would\n\npose only a \"remote and theoretical\" risk to psychoeducational students. R4-59 at 2. Based on this\n\nsole finding and \"[c]onsidering the four factors delineated in\" Arline, the district court relied on our\n\nopinion in Martinez v. School Bd. of Hillsborough County, 861 F.2d 1502, 1506 (11th Cir.1988),\n\nto hold that Doe is qualified to be a psychoeducation teacher. R4-59 at 3.\n\n        In Martinez, a school sought to segregate a mentally retarded child with AIDS from her\n\nclassmates. Holding for the school, the district court in Martinez concluded that a \" \"remote\n\ntheoretical possibility' of transmission\" justified her total separation from other students. Martinez,\n\n861 F.2d at 1506. On appeal, we reversed because the danger of transmission did not rise to the \"\n\n\"significant' risk level\" required for the girl's exclusion from a regular classroom. Id. In reversing\n\nthe district court, however, we did not simply direct entry of judgment for the disabled plaintiff.\n\nInstead, we observed that the district court had failed to make factual findings regarding all four of\n\n\n\n\n                                                   7\n\fthe Arline factors (the district court had considered only the likelihood of transmission), and we\n\nremanded for further findings and an assessment of the overall risk. See id. at 1506-07.\n\n       In the present case, the district court has not made any factual findings that might enable us\n\nto engage in meaningful appellate review. As in Martinez and Arline, the district court has failed\n\nto explain or justify the factual determinations underlying its decision. It is not enough for the\n\ndistrict court to invoke Martinez 's phrase regarding a \" \"remote theoretical possibility' of\n\ntransmission\". Instead, the district court should explain why it believes that the risk posed by Doe\n\nis \"remote\" and should make findings of fact with respect to the Arline factors.7 Because the district\n\ncourt's factual findings are incomplete and its reasoning is unclear, we vacate the injunction and\n\nremand the case to the district court for such further proceedings as it deems necessary for entry of\n\na more explicit rationale for its decision.8\n\n\n   7\n    We do not mean to imply that we believe that Doe is not qualified. Because the district court\nhas neither made sufficient findings of fact nor explained its legal reasoning, we are not able to\nassess whether Doe is \"otherwise qualified\" for a psychoeducation position.\n   8\n    We are also concerned about the nature of the legal standards applied by the district court, as\nevidenced by its comments in the record. For example, during the School District's examination\nof a witness, the district court stated to the parties that it was confused about what should\nconstitute relevant evidence and that it believed that the legal test for whether the School District\nhad violated the ADA was simply whether the District had acted \"reasonably.\" R7 at 502.\nWhen counsel for both parties attempted to assist the court, the following exchange ensued:\n\n               PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL: Your Honor, may I interject? I don't want you to get\n               mad at me for saying this, but I just want to real quickly state for the record how\n               the issue should be framed from the legal standpoint. The issue is not whether the\n               school board acted reasonably, but rather did they make an employment decision\n               on the basis of my client's disability, and was he otherwise qualified to stay at\n               Shadow Rock or did he present a direct threat?\n\n               COURT: You can call it whatever you want to, but the bottom line is what I said.\n               Whether it's based on his qualifications or otherwise, it's whether they acted\n               reasonably.\n\n                                                  8\n\fB. WHETHER DOE'S TRANSFER CONSTITUTED AN ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTION\n\n       Under the ADA, no covered employer may discriminate against a qualified person because\n\nof his disability. See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). More specifically, no covered employer may use the\n\ndisability of an otherwise qualified person as an excuse for discrimination in hiring, promotion,\n\ndischarge, compensation, training, or \"other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.\" Id.\n\nThus, the ADA prohibits \"a broad variety of adverse employment actions, whenever those actions\n\nare taken for a prohibited reason.\" McNely v. Ocala Star-Banner Corp., 99 F.3d 1068, 1077 (11th\n\nCir.1996). Although we have never thoroughly examined what constitutes \"adversity,\" we have held\n\nthat a transfer may sometimes constitute an adverse action under the ADA, see id. at 1078.\n\n       In this case, both parties agree that the School District transferred Doe to an interrelated\n\nclassroom because of his HIV disability. The School District, however, argues that it has not\n\nunlawfully \"discriminated\" against Doe because an \"objective,\" \"reasonable\" person in Doe's\n\nposition would not have viewed the transfer as an adverse employment action. Doe, though,\n\nmaintains that an employment action may be adverse for either objective or subjective reasons. Doe\n\ntherefore contends that his transfer was adverse both because he has a deep, personal commitment\n\nto psychoeducational instruction and because he would have to undergo ten credit hours of\n\ninstruction in order to obtain certification in interrelated teaching.\n\n\n\n\n               PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL: Well, legally it's based on—\n\n               COURT: All right. You worry about that if I rule against you and you can take it\n               up to the Eleventh Circuit.\n\n       Id. at 503. We would have preferred that the district court make a greater effort to\n       ascertain the legal basis for Doe's action before it made evidentiary or other rulings.\n\n                                                   9\n\f        In its order, the district court did not explicitly adopt either an objective or subjective\n\nstandard, but instead simply stated, without explanation, that \"Plaintiff's transfer to the interrelated\n\nresource program was an adverse employment action.\" R4-59 at 3, ¶ 6. It seems likely, however,\n\nthat the district court implicitly adopted Doe's approach, since its only factual findings that might\n\nconceivably have supported this legal conclusion were that (1) Doe is not certified for interrelated\n\nteaching, (2) psychoeducation \"has special meaning and significance to him,\" and (3) his transfer\n\nwas involuntary. Id. at 1-2.9\n\n        Before assessing Doe's particular allegations, we must first determine the proper standard\n\nfor evaluating his claims. As we noted above, our circuit has not previously examined whether a\n\ncourt should view an employment action from the subjective perspective of a particular plaintiff or\n\nthe objective perspective of a \"reasonable person.\" Our court has, though, considered allegations\n\nof \"adverse employment actions\" in a variety of contexts, as have our sister circuits. See generally,\n\ne.g., H & W Contracting, 102 F.3d at 523-24 (11th Cir.1996) (discussing adverse employment action\n\nin the ADA context); Maddow v. Procter & Gamble Co., 107 F.3d 846, 852-53 (11th Cir.1997)\n\n(discussing same under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 621-\n\n634); Collins v. State of Illinois, 830 F.2d 692, 702-704 (7th Cir.1987) (discussing same under Title\n\nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.). Both the ADEA and Title VII, for\n\ninstance, use the same \"terms and conditions\" language to proscribe discriminatory employment\n\npractices. Compare ADEA, 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1), and Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a) with\n\nADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a).            Moreover, our precedents interpreting these employment\n\n\n   9\n    Although the district court gave no explanation in its order for its conclusion that the transfer\nwas adverse, it did appear to state during the trial that its decision concerning adversity would\nturn on whether it found Doe's transfer to have been voluntary or involuntary. See R8 at 605.\n\n                                                  10\n\fdiscrimination laws have often relied on the same \"adverse employment action\" concept that is an\n\nessential element of a prima facie ADA case. See, e.g., Maddow, 107 F.3d at 852-53 (ADEA);\n\nCollins, 830 F.2d at 702-04 (Title VII).10 We can assist our consideration of the adversity standard\n\nunder the ADA, therefore, by looking to the broader experience of our court and others with\n\nemployment discrimination law.\n\n        We begin our analysis of the law in this area by noting that we have found no case, in this\n\nor any other circuit, in which a court explicitly relied on the subjective preferences of a plaintiff to\n\nhold that that plaintiff had suffered an adverse employment action.11 Of course, in most employment\n\ndiscrimination cases the issue of a plaintiff's subjective preference need not arise, because the\n\nplaintiff has alleged an employment action that would appear adverse to any reasonable person.\n\nWhere a plaintiff has allegedly suffered termination, demotion, reduction in pay, loss of prestige,\n\nor diminishment of responsibilities, for example, a court normally has no cause to consider its\n\nstandard for adversity; the relevant question in such cases is whether such patently adverse actions\n\nactually took place. Cf., e.g., Eskra v. Provident Life and Accident Ins. Co., 125 F.3d 1406, 1412\n\n\n\n\n   10\n     An \"adverse employment action\" is also an element of two broad types of prima facie\ndiscrimination cases: (1) a prima facie circumstantial case, see Carter v. City of Miami, 870\nF.2d 578, 582 (11th Cir.1989), and (2) a prima facie retaliation case, see Raney v. Vinson Guard\nServ., Inc., 120 F.3d 1192, 1196 (11th Cir.1997).\n   11\n     In Collins, a panel of the Seventh Circuit did note that the plaintiff had been \"transferred\naway from a job she enjoyed.\" 830 F.2d at 704. The Collins court, however, appears to have\nbased its determination that the plaintiff had suffered an adverse employment action on its\nfinding that her employer had severely curtailed her job responsibilities. See id. Moreover, any\nintimation in Collins that a court should consider an employee's subjective preference would\nseem to have been abandoned by the Seventh Circuit in later cases such as Williams v. Bristol-\nMyers Squibb Co., 85 F.3d 270, 274 (1996) (holding that a \"purely lateral transfer\" cannot be\nadverse), which we discuss below.\n\n                                                  11\n\f(11th Cir.1997) (considering a reduction in income, but not mentioning the plaintiff's subjective\n\npreferences, in ruling that a transfer was adverse).\n\n        Recognizing this lack of precedent, Doe urges us to rely on two EEOC regulations\n\ninterpreting the ADA. See 29 C.F.R. §§ 1630.4, 1630.5 (1998). As Doe correctly notes, we defer\n\nto a federal agency's reasonable interpretation of a law that Congress has given it authority to\n\nadminister. See Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837,\n\n844-45, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2782-83, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). The EEOC's regulations, however, are\n\nof no assistance in this matter, because they do not address whether we should use an objective or\n\nsubjective test to determine whether discrimination has occurred. In 29 C.F.R. § 1630.4, the EEOC\n\nmakes clear that an employer may not \"discriminate on the basis of disability against a qualified\n\nindividual with a disability in regard to ... [a] transfer.\" The EEOC's regulation, however, does not\n\nstate whether this prohibition on discrimination encompasses both objectively and subjectively\n\nadverse actions. Section 1630.4, therefore, does not provide us with any more guidance than our\n\nown precedent establishing that a transfer may sometimes constitute an adverse employment action.\n\nSee McNely, 99 F.3d at 1078 (holding that a transfer may be an adverse employment action).\n\nSimilarly, 29 C.F.R. § 1630.5 forbids employers from limiting, segregating, or classifying an\n\nemployee \"in a way that adversely affects his or her employment opportunities,\" yet does not specify\n\nwhat constitutes an adverse effect. As to both section 1630.4 and section 1630.5, moreover, the\n\nEEOC's \"interpretive guidance\" provides no further help regarding whether we should employ an\n\nobjective or subjective standard. See generally 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, App. §§ 1630.4, 1630.5 (1998).\n\n        Having determined that we are not bound to a subjective standard, we adopt an objective\n\ntest: An ADA plaintiff must demonstrate that a reasonable person in his position would view the\n\n\n                                                 12\n\femployment action in question as adverse. In our view, this test best reflects our employment\n\ndiscrimination doctrine and precedents. First, although this court has never explicitly addressed the\n\nissue, our authorities do at least suggest an objective approach. In National Cement Co. v. Federal\n\nMine Safety and Health Review Comm'n, 27 F.3d 526 (11th Cir.1994), we considered whether a\n\ncompany had violated the Mine Act, 30 U.S.C. § 815(c), when it transferred an employee who had\n\nrefused to do what he claimed was unreasonably dangerous work. Because the employer had\n\ntransferred the plaintiff to a higher paying job, we ruled that it had not taken an unlawful \"adverse\n\naction,\" without considering whether the plaintiff might have had a subjective preference for his\n\nprevious position. See id. at 534.12 Moreover, we note that two district courts within our circuit\n\nhave ruled, in retaliation cases, that \"an employment action ... is not adverse merely because the\n\nemployee dislikes it or disagrees with it.\" Perryman v. West, 949 F.Supp. 815, 819 (M.D.Ala.1996);\n\naccord McCoy v. Macon Water Auth., 966 F.Supp. 1209, 1220 (M.D.Ga.1997). While these district\n\ncourt cases are not controlling, they are consistent with our court's previous observation that not\n\n\"every unkind act\" amounts to an adverse employment action. Wu v. Thomas, 996 F.2d 271, 273\n\nn. 3 (11th Cir.1993) (per curiam). At the same time, it seems significant that no panel of this circuit\n\nhas ever listed a plaintiff's particular subjective preference as a basis for its holding that a transfer\n\nwas adverse.13\n\n\n   12\n    Of course, we do not know whether the plaintiff in National Cement argued that his\nsubjective preference was sufficient, alone, to establish that his transfer was adverse. For this\nreason, National Cement is not controlling precedent. This same caveat applies to the various\nother suggestive authorities discussed in this opinion, since we have no way to determine\nwhether the issue of a subjective versus an objective standard was raised by the parties.\n   13\n     See generally Maddow, 107 F.3d at 852-53 (holding a transfer to be adverse); Eskra, 125\nF.3d at 1412 (same); McCabe v. Sharrett, 12 F.3d 1558, 1563-64 (11th Cir.1994) (same); Baker\nv. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 903 F.2d 1515, 1519 (11th Cir.1990) (per curiam) (same); see also\n\n                                                   13\n\f        Outside our own circuit, persuasive authority suggests even more strongly that we should\n\nuse a reasonable person standard to determine whether a plaintiff has suffered an adverse\n\nemployment action. The Seventh Circuit, in particular, has repeatedly declared that \"a purely lateral\n\ntransfer, that is, a transfer that does not involve a demotion in form or substance, cannot rise to the\n\nlevel of a materially adverse employment action.\" Williams, 85 F.3d at 274; see also Flaherty v.\n\nGas Research Inst., 31 F.3d 451, 457 (7th Cir.1994); Crady v. Liberty Nat'l Bank and Trust Co.,\n\n993 F.2d 132, 136 (7th Cir.1993); Spring v. Sheboygan Area Sch. Dist., 865 F.2d 883, 885-86 (7th\n\nCir.1989). \"Otherwise,\" the Seventh Circuit has written, \"every trivial personnel action that an\n\nirritable, chip-on-the-shoulder employee did not like would form the basis of a discrimination suit.\"\n\nWilliams, 85 F.3d at 274.14 Thus, \"not everything that makes an employee unhappy is an actionable\n\nadverse action.\" See Smart v. Ball State Univ., 89 F.3d 437, 441 (7th Cir.1996).\n\n        Several other circuits, moreover, have agreed that a truly lateral transfer cannot be adverse.\n\nIn Montandon v. Farmland Industries, for example, the Eighth Circuit found that an allegedly\n\nretaliatory transfer was not adverse because it \"did not entail a change in position, title, salary, or\n\nany other aspect of his employment ....[,][h]owever unpalatable the prospect [of the transfer] may\n\nhave been to him....\" 116 F.3d 355, 359 (8th Cir.1997); see also Harlston v. McDonnell Douglas\n\nCorp., 37 F.3d 379, 382 (8th Cir.1994). Similarly, the Sixth Circuit has held that a nurse's transfer\n\nwas not adverse because it did not entail a loss of pay, duties, or prestige, see Kocsis v. Multi-Care\n\n\n\nMcNely, 99 F.3d at 1078 (holding that an transfer can constitute an adverse employment action\nunder the ADA).\n   14\n     The Williams court also was concerned that, if purely lateral transfers were actionable, then\n\"[t]he Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, already staggering under an avalanche of\nfilings too heavy for it to cope with, would be crushed, and serious complaints would be lost\namong the trivial.\" Williams, 85 F.3d at 274.\n\n                                                  14\n\fManagement, Inc. 97 F.3d 876, 886 (6th Cir.1996), while the Ninth Circuit has written that a\n\nplaintiff's transfer amounted to \"a subjective loss of job satisfaction rather than an adverse\n\nemployment action,\" see Horn v. County of San Diego, No. 96-55610 (9th Cir.1997) (per curiam).\n\nAccord Nidds v. Schindler Elevator Corp., 113 F.3d 912, 919 n. 3 (9th Cir.1996), cert. denied, ---\n\nU.S. ----, 118 S.Ct. 369, 139 L.Ed.2d 287 (1997). At the same time, the Third Circuit has adopted\n\nSmart 's view that \"not everything that makes an employee unhappy\" constitutes unlawful\n\nretaliation. Robinson v. City of Pittsburgh, 120 F.3d 1286, 1300 (3d Cir.1997) (\"[R]etaliatory\n\nconduct must be serious and tangible enough to alter an employee's compensation, terms, conditions,\n\nor privileges of employment into ... \"adverse employment action.' \"). Thus, \"[t]he clear trend of\n\nauthority is to hold that\" a purely lateral transfer is not an adverse employment action. Ledergerber\n\nv. Stangler, 122 F.3d 1142, 1144 (8th Cir.1997).\n\n        Of course, these cases do not articulate a reasonable person standard, nor do they explicitly\n\nstand for the proposition that a court may not ever consider a plaintiff's subjective preferences in\n\ndetermining whether his transfer is \"purely lateral.\"15 Nevertheless, they are, at a minimum,\n\nconsistent with the objective standard that we expressly adopt in this opinion. As in the Eleventh\n\nCircuit, all of the cases that have found a transfer to be adverse appear to have based their\n\nconclusions on objective factors. See, e.g., de la Cruz v. New York City Human Resources Admin.\n\nDep't of Soc. Serv., 82 F.3d 16, 21 (2d Cir.1996) (transfer resulting in lessened prestige and\n\n\n   15\n     Often, in fact, these cases appear to leave the door open to adversity based on some\nsubjective preferences, through their use of language like that in Smart that \"not everything that\nmakes an employee unhappy is an actionable adverse action.\" Smart, 89 F.3d at 441 (emphasis\nadded). Unlike the hypothetical \"chip-on-the-shoulder employee\" in Williams, Doe has a\nsignificant, and deeply held, special commitment to psychoeducation for severely disordered\nchildren. Compare Williams, 85 F.3d at 274. This case, therefore, takes us a step beyond these\nauthorities.\n\n                                                 15\n\fprofessional growth); Torre v. Casio, Inc., 42 F.3d 825, 831 n. 7 (3d Cir.1994) (transfer to a\n\ndead-end job). In other words, our sister circuits have only held transfers to be adverse where the\n\ntransfers were objectively equivalent, at least to some degree, to demotions.\n\n        Beyond these precedents from our sister circuits, we can also look to related principles of\n\nemployment discrimination law to find support for the proposition that our test for adversity should\n\nbe an objective one. Under the doctrine of \"constructive discharge,\" for example, \"[t]he general rule\n\nis that if the employer deliberately makes an employee's working conditions so intolerable that the\n\nemployee is forced into an involuntary resignation, then the employer ... is as liable for any illegal\n\nconduct involved therein as if it had formally discharged the aggrieved employee.\" Young v.\n\nSouthwestern Sav. and Loan Assoc., 509 F.2d 140, 144 (5th Cir.1975). In assessing constructive\n\ndischarge claims, we do not consider a plaintiff's subjective feelings about his employer's actions.\n\nRather, we determine whether \"a reasonable person in [the plaintiff's] position would be compelled\n\nto resign.\" Steele v. Offshore Shipbuilding, Inc., 867 F.2d 1311, 1317 (11th Cir.1989); accord, e.g.,\n\nSerrano-Cruz v. DFI Puerto Rico, Inc., 109 F.3d 23, 26 (1st Cir.1997) (\"We have long applied an\n\n\"objective standard'....\"); Kelleher v. Flawn, 761 F.2d 1079, 1086 (5th Cir.1985) (\"[S]ubjective\n\nimpressions as to the desirability of one position over another cannot control our decision.\") (quoting\n\nLee v. Russell Cty. Bd. of Educ., 563 F.2d 1159, 1162 (5th Cir.1977)). Applying this doctrine, Doe\n\nmight have refused his transfer, resigned, and then sued for constructive discharge. Had he done\n\nso, however, he would have had not only to meet a high threshold of adversity (\"intolerability\");\n\nhe would also have had to rely solely on objective factors to make his case. Instead of quitting his\n\njob, though, Doe accepted the transfer and now seeks to prove that it was adverse through evidence\n\nof his personal preference for psychoeducational teaching. While our constructive discharge\n\n\n                                                  16\n\fprecedents by no means control our decision in this case, it would seem strange and inconsistent for\n\nus to apply an objective standard where a plaintiff rejects a transfer, resigns, and sues, but to apply\n\na subjective standard where a plaintiff accepts a transfer and sues. Absent some justification for\n\nsuch a dichotomy, we decline to introduce such a confusing inconsistency into the law.\n\n         At the same time, our adoption of an objective standard for claims of an adverse\n\nemployment action is consistent with our current use of objective standards regarding employers'\n\nclaims and defenses. In the ADA context, for instance, we often inquire as to whether an employer\n\nhas made a \"reasonable accommodation\" of its employee's disability. In making this determination,\n\nwe do not ask whether an employer has made all the accommodations it feels are appropriate, or\n\nwhether an employer has made all the accommodations that a disabled plaintiff desires. See Stewart\n\nv. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1285 (11th Cir.1997). Instead, we decide\n\nwhether a requested accommodation \"would impose an undue hardship on the employer.\" Id.\n\nSimilarly, we do not rely on an employer's \"feelings\" regarding a person's disability. See H & W\n\nContracting, 102 F.3d at 524. Nor do we consider the subjective but unreasonable fear that a\n\ncommunity may harbor regarding teachers with HIV. Cf. Martinez, 861 F.2d at 1505-06 (reversing\n\nan order segregating a child with AIDS from her classmates); Arline, 480 U.S. at 284, 107 S.Ct. at\n\n1129 (disregarding \"society's accumulated myths and fears about disability and disease\").16\n\n        Moreover, we have employed the adverse employment action concept as a means to avoid\n\nrequiring plaintiffs to prove the subjective, discriminatory intent of an employer. Often, a plaintiff\n\n\n\n   16\n    We also note that the Supreme Court has interpreted the \"terms, conditions, or privileges of\nemployment\" language of Title VII to require a sexual harassment plaintiff to show that her work\nenvironment is objectively hostile. See Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S.Ct.\n367, 370, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993).\n\n                                                  17\n\fclaiming unlawful employment discrimination cannot produce direct evidence of his employer's\n\nintent. See Mayfield v. Patterson Pump Co., 101 F.3d 1371, 1375 (11th Cir.1996). In order to allow\n\nplaintiffs to surmount this problem, the courts have articulated a set of elements that a plaintiff may\n\nprove to establish a circumstantial prima facie case of discrimination. See McDonnell Douglas\n\nCorp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973); Mayfield, 101 F.3d\n\nat 1375. As we explained above, one of the elements that a plaintiff must show to establish such a\n\nprima facie case is that he has suffered an adverse employment action. See Carter, 870 F.2d at 582.\n\nWere we to adopt Doe's subjective test for adversity in this case, we would create an odd situation\n\nin which a plaintiff could use the McDonnell Douglas test not only to avoid having to prove directly\n\nhis employer's discriminatory intent, but also to force his employer to either disprove the plaintiff's\n\nown subjective feelings or concede an element of the plaintiff's prima facie case.17 Though, again,\n\nthe McDonnell Douglas line of cases is not controlling, we are hesitant to introduce unnecessary\n\ninconsistency and confusion into employment discrimination law.18\n\n\n   17\n     For instance, consider a case in which a school involuntarily transferred a female teacher\nfrom a seventh grade to an eighth grade class and then placed a male in her former position.\nEven without direct evidence that the school harbored a gender-discriminatory intent, the teacher\ncould establish a prima facie circumstantial case by showing that (1) she was a member of a\nprotected class (women), (2) she was qualified to teach the seventh grade class, (3) her transfer\nwas an adverse employment action, and (4) a member of an unprotected class filled her former\nposition (the male teacher). Cf. Carter, 870 F.2d at 582. (stating the elements of a prima facie\ncircumstantial case). Under Doe's view, the teacher's subjective preference for her former\nseventh grade class would be sufficient to prove that she had suffered an adverse employment\naction, so the school would have either to produce evidence that she did not subjectively prefer\nher former position or to concede this element. Thus, the McDonnell Douglas test would excuse\nemployees from producing direct evidence of their employers' subjective intent but would\nrequire employers to produce such evidence of their employees' subjective preferences.\n   18\n    In addition to rendering one element of the McDonnell Douglas test essentially moot, a\nsubjective standard would make the law less predictable for employers. Under an objective\nstandard, an employer can expect that it will not be liable for employment discrimination if it\n\n                                                  18\n\f        Returning more specifically to the ADA context, we also note that our requirement that a\n\nplaintiff must show, as part of his prima facie case, that he has suffered an adverse employment\n\naction would be essentially meaningless if we were to utilize a subjective standard. In order for an\n\nhonest plaintiff to go to the trouble of suing his employer, he must be unhappy with some action that\n\nhis employer has taken. Given this basic fact, a subjective standard would mean that no court would\n\never seriously consider the adverse employment action prong of a prima facie ADA case—we could\n\njust assume this element to be satisfied in every case. Even if we did not assume away the adversity\n\nrequirement as a matter of course, a plaintiff could always prove this part of his case by testifying\n\nthat he was unhappy with whatever employment action had brought him into court; an employer\n\ncould rarely rebut its employee's statement of his own subjective feelings.\n\n        Finally, we believe that the standard that we articulate today will well serve the ADA's goal\n\nof eliminating discrimination on account of disability. See generally 42 U.S.C. § 12101 (\"Findings\n\nand purpose\"). By evaluating claims from the perspective of a reasonable person in the employee's\n\nposition, we will continue to interpret the ADA to prohibit a wide range of job actions based on an\n\nemployee's disabled status. Transfers that result in lesser pay, responsibilities, or prestige19 will still\n\n\n\ndoes not constrain its employees' careers. Under a subjective standard, however, an employer\ncannot anticipate which employment actions a court will find to be adverse, because it cannot\nalways know what will make its employees \"unhappy.\"\n   19\n    In at least two cases, the Seventh Circuit has stated or implied that loss of prestige did not\nmake a transfer adverse. See Flaherty, 31 F.3d at 457; Spring, 865 F.2d at 886. It is somewhat\nunclear in these cases whether the court was holding that a loss of prestige was outweighed by\nother factors, was not significant, or was irrelevant. See Flaherty, 31 F.3d at 457; Spring, 865\nF.2d at 886. Regardless, we believe that loss of prestige, either within an organization or with\nregard to the general public, is an objective factor that a court should consider as part of the\nreasonable person test. Cf. de la Cruz, 82 F.3d at 21. Beyond the loss of prestige itself (a\nreasonable if egoistic employee goal much like salary or promotion), diminishment of prestige\nmay also affect an employee's marketability, another significant objective factor.\n\n                                                    19\n\fbe \"adverse.\" See, e.g., Baker 903 F.2d at 1519 (lesser pay); Collins, 830 F.2d at 704 (lesser\n\nresponsibilities); de la Cruz, 82 F.3d at 21 (lesser prestige). So, too, will transfers that involve\n\narduous travel or that impede an employee's professional growth or advancement. See, e.g.,\n\nMaddow, 107 F.3d at 852 (travel); de la Cruz, 82 F.3d at 21 (professional growth); Torre, 42 F.3d\n\nat 831 n. 7 (advancement). In other words, our reasonable person standard will continue to protect\n\ndisabled employees from transfers that are a form of demotion or that disrupt investment in\n\neducation, training, or seniority.\n\n        Turning to the specific facts of the present case, we are unable to determine from the current\n\nrecord whether Doe has suffered an adverse transfer. As we have explained, Doe's subjective\n\npreference for a psychoeducation position is not relevant to our inquiry. Although we greatly admire\n\nDoe's commitment to teaching such tragically disordered children, we do not consider the special\n\nmeaning that he ascribes to his former job.\n\n       The question that remains, then, is whether a reasonable person in Doe's position would have\n\nviewed as adverse the requirement that Doe complete ten credit hours (over three years) to obtain\n\ncertification in interrelated teaching. To support his argument that this transfer-induced obligation\n\nis adverse, Doe cites Rodriguez v. Board of Educ. of Eastchester Union Free Sch. Dist., 620 F.2d\n\n362 (2d Cir.1980). In that Title VII case, a school district allegedly transferred a female, middle\n\nschool, art teacher to an elementary school as part of its policy of segregating female art teachers\n\ninto elementary education. See id. at 364-66. Prior to her transfer, the teacher had not only had\n\ntwenty years of experience in teaching middle school art classes but had also received a doctoral\n\ndegree in art education; her doctoral thesis was entitled \"A Model Arts Program for the Middle\n\nSchool of Eastchester School District Number 1.\" See id. After examining the school district's\n\n\n                                                 20\n\faction, the Rodriguez court concluded that the teacher had suffered an adverse transfer because\n\n\"substantially uncontradicted evidence indicated that the art programs at the elementary level were\n\nso profoundly different from those in the junior high school as to render utterly useless her twenty\n\nyears of experience and study in developing art programs for middle school children.\" Id. at 366.\n\nThis \"severe professional ... trauma,\" the court held, constituted an adverse, sex-based interference\n\nwith a condition or privilege of employment. See id.\n\n        The facts of Doe's case, however, are quite different. Unlike the plaintiff in Rodriguez, Doe's\n\ntransfer does not substantially obviate a specialized education; Doe does not have a bachelor's or\n\nhigher degree that is less applicable to interrelated education than it is to psychoeducation. Although\n\nDoe's transfer would disrupt his investment in his current Georgia certificate, his transfer from a\n\npsychoeducational to an interrelated classroom is not nearly as dramatic as Rodriguez's move from\n\na middle school to an elementary school.20 In other words, Doe may not have suffered the \"severe\n\nprofessional trauma\" evident in Rodriguez, though his transfer undoubtedly represented a \"personal\n\n\" setback.\n\n        Still, Doe does not need to show that his transfer would represent a \"severe trauma\" to a\n\nreasonable person in his position. Instead, he needs only to show that his transfer was, on the whole,\n\nobjectively adverse. Any adversity must be material; it is not enough that a transfer imposes some\n\nde minimis inconvenience or alteration of responsibilities.21 See Crady, 993 F.2d at 136. Moreover,\n\n\n   20\n    Although not mentioned in the Rodriguez opinion, such a transfer from a middle to an\nelementary school might also be thought to involve a significant loss of prestige, and perhaps\nlong-term prospects for advancement in the art education field as well.\n   21\n    It is important not to make a federal case out of a transfer that is de minimis, causing no\nobjective harm and reflecting a mere chip-on-the-shoulder complaint. However, it is equally\nimportant that the threshold for what constitutes an adverse employment action not be elevated\n\n                                                  21\n\fthe fact that an employee must learn as a result of a transfer does not mean that the transfer is per\n\nse adverse. See Williams, 85 F.3d at 274. In Williams, for example, the court held that a salesman's\n\ntransfer to a different product line was not adverse, despite the fact that he had to learn more new\n\nproducts than he would have if he had stayed put. See id. (concluding that the salesman's loss of\n\ncommission income while he learned about new products did not render his transfer adverse). As\n\nthe Williams court observed, all transfers require some learning, since they require employees to\n\nwork with new people or products and to assume new responsibilities. See id. Thus, any\n\ncoursework requirements for Doe must rise to a level that a reasonable person would deem\n\nmaterially adverse, taking into account both the pros and cons of such required education.\n\n        In sum, Doe must demonstrate that a reasonable person in his position would have found his\n\ntransfer to be adverse under all the facts and circumstances. Unfortunately, the district court has not\n\nmade sufficient findings with regard to any of these factors for us to undertake a meaningful review.\n\nTherefore, we have decided to remand the case to the district court for such proceedings as it deems\n\nnecessary for it to enter explicit findings of fact concerning the allegedly adverse nature of Doe's\n\ntransfer.22 Once having made these explicit findings, the district court should clearly explain why\n\n\n\nartificially, because an employer's action, to the extent that it is deemed not to rise to the level of\nan adverse employment action, is removed completely from any scrutiny for discrimination. In\nother words, where the cause or motivation for the employer's action was clearly its employee's\ndisability, a finding that the action does not rise to the level of an adverse employment action\nmeans that the action is not scrutinized for discrimination. An artificially high threshold for\nwhat constitutes an adverse employment action would undermine the purposes of the statute by\npermitting discriminatory actions to escape scrutiny. We believe that the purposes of the statute\nare appropriately served by requiring the fact finder to determine whether a reasonable person\nwould consider the action adverse under all the facts and circumstances.\n   22\n     The district court should make relevant subsidiary findings of fact, as well as an ultimate\nfinding of fact as to whether a reasonable person in Doe's position would have found the transfer\nto be adverse under all the facts and circumstances. Without in any way limiting the subject\n\n                                                  22\n\fit believes that a reasonable person in Doe's position would or would not have found the transfer to\n\nhave been an adverse employment action.\n\n        In determining whether Doe's transfer was adverse, the district court should not rely on its\n\ndetermination that the transfer was involuntary. In saying this, we do not mean to disturb the district\n\ncourt's finding on this issue but rather to make clear that the voluntary or involuntary nature of the\n\ntransfer is not relevant to the question of whether it was unlawfully adverse. Of course, a finding\n\nthat Doe's transfer was purely voluntary would have been dispositive in the School District's favor;\n\na transfer cannot be \"because of a disability\" if it occurred as the result of an employee's own\n\nrequest. Cf. Stewart v. Board of Trustees of the Kemper County Sch. Dist., 585 F.2d 1285, 1289 (5th\n\nCir.1978) (voluntary transfer not unlawful under Title VII); Hooper v. Maryland, No. 94-1067 (4th\n\nCir.1995); Devine v. Thalhimers, No. 92-1084 (4th Cir.1992). The fact that Doe's transfer was\n\ninvoluntary, however, does not in any way establish that it was legally adverse. Cf. Williams, 85\n\nF.3d at 274 (finding an \"involuntary\" transfer to be non-adverse). If a reasonable person in Doe's\n\nposition would have viewed the transfer as non-adverse, the district court should not consider Doe's\n\nsubjective, personal preference for his prior position.\n\n                                         III. CONCLUSION\n\n\n\n\nmatter of appropriate findings, the following would seem to be relevant: what is entailed in the\ncoursework required for certification in the new position; would such additional certification\nincrease Doe's career opportunities, and, if so, was such additional certification and resulting\nincrease in opportunities available to Doe in any event, or was this available to Doe only because\nof the transfer; whether the District's action would in effect limit Doe's opportunities in this\nschool district to the teaching of interrelated classes, and/or foreclose other opportunities, and, if\nso, whether the same would adversely affect Doe's employment opportunities or status within\neither this particular school district or the field of special education generally, see 29 C.F.R. Pt.\n1630, App. § 1630.5 (1998); and considering all of the relevant subsidiary findings, whether a\nreasonable person in Doe's position would consider the transfer to be adverse.\n\n                                                  23\n\f       We review in this case an injunction under the ADA that prohibits the School District from\n\ntransferring Doe out of the District's psychoeducation program because of his infection with HIV.\n\nTo establish a prima facie case under the ADA, Doe must prove that he has a disability; that he is\n\notherwise qualified to teach psychoeducation, with or without some reasonable accommodation;\n\nand that he has suffered an adverse employment action because of his HIV status (i.e., that the\n\nSchool District has discriminated against him because of his disability).\n\n       To determine whether Doe is qualified, the district court should have found and weighed the\n\nfour factors explained in Arline. The district court, however, failed to make explicit findings of fact\n\nregarding any dangers that Doe's illness might pose to violent psychoeducation students. In\n\naddition, the district court erred by applying a subjective standard for determining whether Doe's\n\ntransfer was adverse. Moreover, because the district court did not enter explicit findings of fact or\n\nconclusions of law with regard to those aspects of Doe's transfer that might render it objectively\n\nadverse, we believe that it would be imprudent for us to attempt to assess whether the School\n\nDistrict subjected Doe to an adverse employment action.\n\n       Therefore, we REVERSE the district court's judgment, VACATE the injunction, and\n\nREMAND the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  24\n\f",

(No. 1:96-cv-\n2313-RCF), Richard C. Freeman, Judge.\n\nBefore ANDERSON and BIRCH, Circuit Judges, and PAINE*, Senior District Judge.\n\n       BIRCH, Circuit Judge:\n\n       The Dekalb County School District (the \"School District\" or \"District\"), seeks to vacate a\n\npermanent injunction prohibiting it from transferring a teacher, John Doe, who is infected with HIV,\n\nthe virus that causes AIDS. The School District wishes to transfer Doe from a classroom of children\n\nwith severe behavioral disorders, because it fears that Doe might have blood-to-blood contact with\n\none of his sometimes-violent students, thereby transmitting HIV. After conducting a bench trial, the\n\ndistrict court granted Doe a permanent injunction under the Americans with Disabilities Act\n\n(\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., blocking his transfer. The School District, however, argues\n\nthat the district court failed to make adequate findings of fact regarding the effect of Doe's illness\n\non his qualifications and that Doe has not suffered an \"adverse employment action.\" We REVERSE,\n\nVACATE the injunction, and REMAND for further proceedings.\n\n                                        I. BACKGROUND\n\n\n   *\n     Honorable James C. Paine, Senior U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of Florida,\nsitting by designation.\n\f        The School District has three distinct levels of special education programs for children with\n\nsignificant behavioral disorders. First, the District maintains \"interrelated\" classrooms for students\n\nwith mild disorders; the District \"mainstreams\" these students for most of each school day. Second,\n\nthe District has \"self-contained\" classrooms for children who are too \"disordered\" to participate in\n\nthe interrelated program. Third, the District operates \"psychoeducation\" classrooms for students\n\nwith the most severe behavioral problems. From 1992 to 1995, John Doe was a teacher at the\n\nDistrict's Shadow Rock Psychoeducational Center (\"Shadow Rock\").1\n\n        Children enrolled in the District's psychoeducation classes are often aggressive. As the\n\nDistrict established at trial, these children frequently engage in acts of violence such as biting,\n\nhitting, scratching, and kicking. Some children also attempt to bring dangerous items such as razors\n\nto school or to attack their classmates or teachers with objects such as pencils. Because of these\n\npotential dangers, psychoeducation teachers must be able to physically restrain their pupils; for\n\nexample, a psychoeducation teacher may have to \"basket hold\" several students each day. Often,\n\nthese confrontations result in injuries to teachers. Although the number of scrapes and bruises\n\nsuffered by teachers is unclear, psychoeducation teachers commonly file workman's compensation\n\nclaims for significant injuries, and, at least once, a teacher has suffered a severe bite that drew blood\n\nand required medical attention.\n\n        In February 1995, Doe told Shadow Rock's principal that he was HIV-positive, and the\n\nprincipal in turn informed other school administrative personnel. Because District officials feared\n\nthat violence and subsequent blood-to-blood contact between Doe and one of his psychoeducation\n\n\n\n   1\n   Like the district court, we have allowed the plaintiff-appellee to proceed under the\npseudonym \"John Doe\" in order to protect his privacy.\n\n                                                   2\n\fstudents might lead to transmission of HIV, the District transferred Doe to an \"interrelated\"\n\nclassroom at a different school in April 1995. The parties dispute whether this transfer was\n\n\"voluntary\"; the District emphasizes that Doe signed a transfer form, while Doe argues that he had\n\nno choice but to sign and that he hoped that by doing so he might at least get to teach a\n\n\"self-contained\" rather than an \"interrelated\" class. While the district court's finding regarding this\n\npoint is somewhat unclear, the court appears to have concluded that the transfer was involuntary.\n\nIn any case, Doe spent the months after his transfer trying to convince the District to return him to\n\nhis psychoeducation class, or, as an alternative, to assign him to a group of \"self-contained\" children.\n\n        Although Doe would prefer to teach a psychoeducational rather than an interrelated class,\n\nhis transfer does not appear to represent a demotion. Doe's salary, benefits, and seniority all remain\n\nthe same. Doe also enjoys the same relative level of prestige within the school system and the larger\n\ncommunity. In addition, while Doe lacks a certificate from the State of Georgia in interrelated\n\nteaching, his transfer does not seem likely to render obsolete his investment in his own education.\n\nAlthough Doe's teaching experience has focused on psychoeducation, he does not have a particularly\n\nspecialized educational background. Doe holds a bachelor's degree in psychology from New York\n\nUniversity and a master's degree in special education from Georgia State University.\n\n        Doe, however, does have a Georgia certificate in psychoeducational teaching but not in\n\ninterrelated instruction. To obtain an interrelated certificate, Doe would have to complete ten credit\n\nhours of coursework. In order to reduce any inconvenience this additional study might pose to Doe,\n\nthe District has allowed Doe three years to become certified and promised to pay his educational\n\nexpenses. In addition, the District has suggested that Doe might be able to count his ten hours\n\nconcerning interrelated teaching toward the continuing education total that he would have to achieve\n\n\n                                                   3\n\fin any case to retain his current certification, though this point is not clear in the current record.\n\nEven without the interrelated certificate, Doe appears qualified to teach an interrelated class, since\n\nhis interrelated pupils suffer from the same sort of disorders as his previous psychoeducational\n\nstudents—his new students are just easier to teach because they are less prone to misbehavior. As\n\nDoe concedes, his new interrelated position is less stressful. Significantly, Doe also agrees with the\n\nDistrict that he will be more marketable as an interrelated teacher (once he obtains his certificate),\n\nwith more long-term career opportunities, than he was before his transfer.\n\n       On August 1, 1995, Doe learned from the District's Executive Director of Personnel that he\n\ncould not return to a psychoeducation setting or move to a self-contained classroom because of his\n\nHIV status. On August 3, 1995, Doe therefore timely filed a discrimination charge with the federal\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") alleging that the District was discriminating\n\nagainst him on the basis of his HIV disability. After the EEOC issued Doe a right-to-sue letter, he\n\nbrought this action in the district court under both the ADA and the Vocational Rehabilitation Act\n\n(\"VRA\") 29 U.S.C. § 791 et seq.\n\n       From July 28 through July 31, 1997, the district court held a bench trial on Doe's claims. On\n\nAugust 1, 1997, the district court ruled in Doe's favor and issued a short written order containing\n\nterse findings of fact and conclusions of law. After noting that the parties agreed that Doe's HIV\n\ninfection rendered him disabled, the district court found that \"[t]he risk that plaintiff will transmit\n\nHIV to students with severe behavior disorders, including children who are prone to bite, is remote\n\nand theoretical.\" R4-59 at 2, ¶ 11. The court also found that Doe had suffered an adverse\n\nemployment action. The district court, however, made no attempt to explain the basis for its\n\nconclusion regarding the risk of HIV transmission to Doe's psychoeducation students, nor did the\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fcourt offer any rationale for its assessment that Doe's transfer was \"adverse.\"2 Whatever its\n\nunderlying reasoning, the district court issued a permanent injunction under the ADA requiring the\n\nSchool District to reinstate Doe as a psychoeducational instructor.3\n\n                                          II. DISCUSSION\n\n        In order to prevail under the ADA, Doe must prove all three elements of his prima facie case\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence.4 First, he must show that he has a disability.5 Second, he must\n\ndemonstrate that he is qualified to serve as a psychoeducation teacher, with or without some\n\nreasonable accommodation by the District, despite his disability. Third, he must show that he has\n\nsuffered an adverse employment action because of his disability (i.e., that he has suffered\n\nemployment discrimination). See Harris v. H & W Contracting Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"731052\"><a href=\"/opinion/731052/ellen-t-harris-v-h-w-contracting-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">516</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 519, 523-24\n\n(11th Cir.1996) (discussing the elements of a prima facie case under the ADA).\n\n\n\n\n   2\n    The district court did list three findings of fact elsewhere in its order that it apparently\nthought were relevant to its holding that Doe's transfer was adverse. First, the district court\nfound that \"Plaintiff is certified to teach children with behavior disorders, and teaching in this\nfield has special meaning and significance to him.\" R4-59 at 1, ¶ 11. Second, the district court\nobserved that \"Plaintiff is not certified to teach in an interrelated program.\" Id. at 2, ¶ 7. Third,\nthe district court stated that \"Plaintiff did not wish to be moved from his classroom at Shadow\nRock....\" Id. at 2, ¶ 8.\n   3\n    The district court did not separately discuss Doe's VRA claim.\n   4\n     On appeal, Doe does not argue that we should read the VRA to provide him with any cause\nof action or form of relief that is unavailable under the ADA. In fact, Doe makes no arguments at\nall premised on the VRA. We, therefore, deem Doe's VRA claim to have been abandoned, and\nwe discuss his claim as if it arose solely under the ADA.

Rather than establishing some arbitrary rule regarding the relevance\n\nof contagious disease to teaching qualifications, the Court insisted that district courts undertake\n\n\"individualized inquiry\" in each case. Id. at 287, 107 S.Ct. at 1130. This inquiry must include:\n\n        (a) the nature of the risk (how the disease is transmitted), (b) the duration of the risk (how\n        long is the carrier infectious), (c) the severity of the risk (what is the potential harm to third\n        parties), and (d) the probabilities the disease will be transmitted and will cause varying\n        degrees of harm.\n\nId. at 288, 107 S.Ct. at 1131 (quoting Amicus Curiae Brief of the American Medical Association\n\nat 19). In making these findings, a district court \"normally should defer to the reasonable medical\n\njudgments of public health officials.\" Id.\n\n\n\n   6\n    The School District concedes that, if Doe is disabled, is otherwise qualified, and has suffered\nan adverse employment action, then a permanent injunction prohibiting Doe's transfer based on\nhis HIV status would be appropriate.\n\n                                                    6\n\f        Once a district court has made the necessary medical findings, it must weigh the statutory\n\ngoal of ending disability-based discrimination against any legitimate concerns regarding \"significant\n\nhealth and safety risks.\" Id. If the court finds that, on balance, a plaintiff's disability would render\n\nhim unqualified for safety reasons, then the court must consider whether the employer can\n\n\"reasonably accommodate\" the plaintiff so that he can perform \"the essential functions\" of the job\n\nin question.

Finally,\n\nwhatever the district court's legal conclusion regarding a claim of disqualification due to safety\n\nconcerns, the court must make explicit both its findings of fact and its application of the law, so as\n\nto allow meaningful appellate review. See id.\n\n        In this case, the district court found, without explanation, that Doe's HIV infection would\n\npose only a \"remote and theoretical\" risk to psychoeducational students. R4-59 at 2. Based on this\n\nsole finding and \"[c]onsidering the four factors delineated in\" Arline, the district court relied on our\n\nopinion in Martinez v. School Bd. of Hillsborough County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"514785\"><a href=\"/opinion/514785/eliana-martinez-by-and-through-her-next-friend-rosa-e-martinez-her/\"><span class=\"volume\">861</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1502</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1506 (11th Cir.1988),\n\nto hold that Doe is qualified to be a psychoeducation teacher. R4-59 at 3.\n\n        In Martinez, a school sought to segregate a mentally retarded child with AIDS from her\n\nclassmates. Holding for the school, the district court in Martinez concluded that a \" \"remote\n\ntheoretical possibility' of transmission\" justified her total separation from other students. Martinez,\n\n861 F.2d at 1506. On appeal, we reversed because the danger of transmission did not rise to the \"\n\n\"significant' risk level\" required for the girl's exclusion from a regular classroom. Id. In reversing\n\nthe district court, however, we did not simply direct entry of judgment for the disabled plaintiff.\n\nInstead, we observed that the district court had failed to make factual findings regarding all four of\n\n\n\n\n                                                   7\n\fthe Arline factors (the district court had considered only the likelihood of transmission), and we\n\nremanded for further findings and an assessment of the overall risk. See id. at 1506-07.\n\n       In the present case, the district court has not made any factual findings that might enable us\n\nto engage in meaningful appellate review. As in Martinez and Arline, the district court has failed\n\nto explain or justify the factual determinations underlying its decision. It is not enough for the\n\ndistrict court to invoke Martinez 's phrase regarding a \" \"remote theoretical possibility' of\n\ntransmission\". Instead, the district court should explain why it believes that the risk posed by Doe\n\nis \"remote\" and should make findings of fact with respect to the Arline factors.7 Because the district\n\ncourt's factual findings are incomplete and its reasoning is unclear, we vacate the injunction and\n\nremand the case to the district court for such further proceedings as it deems necessary for entry of\n\na more explicit rationale for its decision.8\n\n\n   7\n    We do not mean to imply that we believe that Doe is not qualified. Because the district court\nhas neither made sufficient findings of fact nor explained its legal reasoning, we are not able to\nassess whether Doe is \"otherwise qualified\" for a psychoeducation position.\n   8\n    We are also concerned about the nature of the legal standards applied by the district court, as\nevidenced by its comments in the record. For example, during the School District's examination\nof a witness, the district court stated to the parties that it was confused about what should\nconstitute relevant evidence and that it believed that the legal test for whether the School District\nhad violated the ADA was simply whether the District had acted \"reasonably.\" R7 at 502.\nWhen counsel for both parties attempted to assist the court, the following exchange ensued:\n\n               PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL: Your Honor, may I interject? I don't want you to get\n               mad at me for saying this, but I just want to real quickly state for the record how\n               the issue should be framed from the legal standpoint. The issue is not whether the\n               school board acted reasonably, but rather did they make an employment decision\n               on the basis of my client's disability, and was he otherwise qualified to stay at\n               Shadow Rock or did he present a direct threat?\n\n               COURT: You can call it whatever you want to, but the bottom line is what I said.\n               Whether it's based on his qualifications or otherwise, it's whether they acted\n               reasonably.\n\n                                                  8\n\fB. WHETHER DOE'S TRANSFER CONSTITUTED AN ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTION\n\n       Under the ADA, no covered employer may discriminate against a qualified person because\n\nof his disability. See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). More specifically, no covered employer may use the\n\ndisability of an otherwise qualified person as an excuse for discrimination in hiring, promotion,\n\ndischarge, compensation, training, or \"other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.\" Id.\n\nThus, the ADA prohibits \"a broad variety of adverse employment actions, whenever those actions\n\nare taken for a prohibited reason.\" McNely v. Ocala Star-Banner Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"728966\"><a href=\"/opinion/728966/bernard-f-mcnely-v-ocala-star-banner-corporation-a-florida-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1068</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1077 (11th\n\nCir.1996). Although we have never thoroughly examined what constitutes \"adversity,\" we have held\n\nthat a transfer may sometimes constitute an adverse action under the ADA, see id. at 1078.\n\n       In this case, both parties agree that the School District transferred Doe to an interrelated\n\nclassroom because of his HIV disability. The School District, however, argues that it has not\n\nunlawfully \"discriminated\" against Doe because an \"objective,\" \"reasonable\" person in Doe's\n\nposition would not have viewed the transfer as an adverse employment action. Doe, though,\n\nmaintains that an employment action may be adverse for either objective or subjective reasons. Doe\n\ntherefore contends that his transfer was adverse both because he has a deep, personal commitment\n\nto psychoeducational instruction and because he would have to undergo ten credit hours of\n\ninstruction in order to obtain certification in interrelated teaching.\n\n\n\n\n               PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL: Well, legally it's based on—\n\n               COURT: All right. You worry about that if I rule against you and you can take it\n               up to the Eleventh Circuit.\n\n       Id. at 503. We would have preferred that the district court make a greater effort to\n       ascertain the legal basis for Doe's action before it made evidentiary or other rulings.\n\n                                                   9\n\f        In its order, the district court did not explicitly adopt either an objective or subjective\n\nstandard, but instead simply stated, without explanation, that \"Plaintiff's transfer to the interrelated\n\nresource program was an adverse employment action.\" R4-59 at 3, ¶ 6. It seems likely, however,\n\nthat the district court implicitly adopted Doe's approach, since its only factual findings that might\n\nconceivably have supported this legal conclusion were that (1) Doe is not certified for interrelated\n\nteaching, (2) psychoeducation \"has special meaning and significance to him,\" and (3) his transfer\n\nwas involuntary. Id. at 1-2.9\n\n        Before assessing Doe's particular allegations, we must first determine the proper standard\n\nfor evaluating his claims. As we noted above, our circuit has not previously examined whether a\n\ncourt should view an employment action from the subjective perspective of a particular plaintiff or\n\nthe objective perspective of a \"reasonable person.\" Our court has, though, considered allegations\n\nof \"adverse employment actions\" in a variety of contexts, as have our sister circuits. See generally,\n\ne.g., H & W Contracting, 102 F.3d at 523-24 (11th Cir.1996) (discussing adverse employment action\n\nin the ADA context); Maddow v.

Compare ADEA, 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1), and Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a) with\n\nADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a).            Moreover, our precedents interpreting these employment\n\n\n   9\n    Although the district court gave no explanation in its order for its conclusion that the transfer\nwas adverse, it did appear to state during the trial that its decision concerning adversity would\nturn on whether it found Doe's transfer to have been voluntary or involuntary. See R8 at 605.\n\n                                                  10\n\fdiscrimination laws have often relied on the same \"adverse employment action\" concept that is an\n\nessential element of a prima facie ADA case. See, e.g., Maddow, 107 F.3d at 852-53 (ADEA);\n\nCollins, 830 F.2d at 702-04 (Title VII).10 We can assist our consideration of the adversity standard\n\nunder the ADA, therefore, by looking to the broader experience of our court and others with\n\nemployment discrimination law.\n\n        We begin our analysis of the law in this area by noting that we have found no case, in this\n\nor any other circuit, in which a court explicitly relied on the subjective preferences of a plaintiff to\n\nhold that that plaintiff had suffered an adverse employment action.11 Of course, in most employment\n\ndiscrimination cases the issue of a plaintiff's subjective preference need not arise, because the\n\nplaintiff has alleged an employment action that would appear adverse to any reasonable person.\n\nWhere a plaintiff has allegedly suffered termination, demotion, reduction in pay, loss of prestige,\n\nor diminishment of responsibilities, for example, a court normally has no cause to consider its\n\nstandard for adversity; the relevant question in such cases is whether such patently adverse actions\n\nactually took place.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984). The EEOC's regulations, however, are\n\nof no assistance in this matter, because they do not address whether we should use an objective or\n\nsubjective test to determine whether discrimination has occurred. In 29 C.F.R. § 1630.4, the EEOC\n\nmakes clear that an employer may not \"discriminate on the basis of disability against a qualified\n\nindividual with a disability in regard to ... [a] transfer.\" The EEOC's regulation, however, does not\n\nstate whether this prohibition on discrimination encompasses both objectively and subjectively\n\nadverse actions. Section 1630.4, therefore, does not provide us with any more guidance than our\n\nown precedent establishing that a transfer may sometimes constitute an adverse employment action.\n\nSee McNely, 99 F.3d at 1078 (holding that a transfer may be an adverse employment action).\n\nSimilarly, 29 C.F.R. § 1630.5 forbids employers from limiting, segregating, or classifying an\n\nemployee \"in a way that adversely affects his or her employment opportunities,\" yet does not specify\n\nwhat constitutes an adverse effect. As to both section 1630.4 and section 1630.5, moreover, the\n\nEEOC's \"interpretive guidance\" provides no further help regarding whether we should employ an\n\nobjective or subjective standard. See generally 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, App. §§ 1630.4, 1630.5 (1998).\n\n        Having determined that we are not bound to a subjective standard, we adopt an objective\n\ntest: An ADA plaintiff must demonstrate that a reasonable person in his position would view the\n\n\n                                                 12\n\femployment action in question as adverse. In our view, this test best reflects our employment\n\ndiscrimination doctrine and precedents. First, although this court has never explicitly addressed the\n\nissue, our authorities do at least suggest an objective approach. In National Cement Co. v. Federal\n\nMine Safety and Health Review Comm'n, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">526</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir.1994), we considered whether a\n\ncompany had violated the Mine Act, 30 U.S.C. § 815(c), when it transferred an employee who had\n\nrefused to do what he claimed was unreasonably dangerous work. Because the employer had\n\ntransferred the plaintiff to a higher paying job, we ruled that it had not taken an unlawful \"adverse\n\naction,\" without considering whether the plaintiff might have had a subjective preference for his\n\nprevious position. See id. at 534.12 Moreover, we note that two district courts within our circuit\n\nhave ruled, in retaliation cases, that \"an employment action ... is not adverse merely because the\n\nemployee dislikes it or disagrees with it.\" Perryman v.

For this\nreason, National Cement is not controlling precedent. This same caveat applies to the various\nother suggestive authorities discussed in this opinion, since we have no way to determine\nwhether the issue of a subjective versus an objective standard was raised by the parties.\n   13\n     See generally Maddow, 107 F.3d at 852-53 (holding a transfer to be adverse); Eskra, 125\nF.3d at 1412 (same); McCabe v.

Applying this doctrine, Doe\n\nmight have refused his transfer, resigned, and then sued for constructive discharge.

Absent some justification for\n\nsuch a dichotomy, we decline to introduce such a confusing inconsistency into the law.\n\n         At the same time, our adoption of an objective standard for claims of an adverse\n\nemployment action is consistent with our current use of objective standards regarding employers'\n\nclaims and defenses. In the ADA context, for instance, we often inquire as to whether an employer\n\nhas made a \"reasonable accommodation\" of its employee's disability. In making this determination,\n\nwe do not ask whether an employer has made all the accommodations it feels are appropriate, or\n\nwhether an employer has made all the accommodations that a disabled plaintiff desires.

See McDonnell Douglas\n\nCorp. v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1973); Mayfield, 101 F.3d\n\nat 1375. As we explained above, one of the elements that a plaintiff must show to establish such a\n\nprima facie case is that he has suffered an adverse employment action. See Carter, 870 F.2d at 582.\n\nWere we to adopt Doe's subjective test for adversity in this case, we would create an odd situation\n\nin which a plaintiff could use the McDonnell Douglas test not only to avoid having to prove directly\n\nhis employer's discriminatory intent, but also to force his employer to either disprove the plaintiff's\n\nown subjective feelings or concede an element of the plaintiff's prima facie case.17 Though, again,\n\nthe McDonnell Douglas line of cases is not controlling, we are hesitant to introduce unnecessary\n\ninconsistency and confusion into employment discrimination law.18\n\n\n   17\n     For instance, consider a case in which a school involuntarily transferred a female teacher\nfrom a seventh grade to an eighth grade class and then placed a male in her former position.\nEven without direct evidence that the school harbored a gender-discriminatory intent, the teacher\ncould establish a prima facie circumstantial case by showing that (1) she was a member of a\nprotected class (women), (2) she was qualified to teach the seventh grade class, (3) her transfer\nwas an adverse employment action, and (4) a member of an unprotected class filled her former\nposition (the male teacher). Cf. Carter, 870 F.2d at 582. (stating the elements of a prima facie\ncircumstantial case). Under Doe's view, the teacher's subjective preference for her former\nseventh grade class would be sufficient to prove that she had suffered an adverse employment\naction, so the school would have either to produce evidence that she did not subjectively prefer\nher former position or to concede this element. Thus, the McDonnell Douglas test would excuse\nemployees from producing direct evidence of their employers' subjective intent but would\nrequire employers to produce such evidence of their employees' subjective preferences.\n   18\n    In addition to rendering one element of the McDonnell Douglas test essentially moot, a\nsubjective standard would make the law less predictable for employers. Under an objective\nstandard, an employer can expect that it will not be liable for employment discrimination if it\n\n                                                  18\n\f        Returning more specifically to the ADA context, we also note that our requirement that a\n\nplaintiff must show, as part of his prima facie case, that he has suffered an adverse employment\n\naction would be essentially meaningless if we were to utilize a subjective standard. In order for an\n\nhonest plaintiff to go to the trouble of suing his employer, he must be unhappy with some action that\n\nhis employer has taken. Given this basic fact, a subjective standard would mean that no court would\n\never seriously consider the adverse employment action prong of a prima facie ADA case—we could\n\njust assume this element to be satisfied in every case. Even if we did not assume away the adversity\n\nrequirement as a matter of course, a plaintiff could always prove this part of his case by testifying\n\nthat he was unhappy with whatever employment action had brought him into court; an employer\n\ncould rarely rebut its employee's statement of his own subjective feelings.\n\n        Finally, we believe that the standard that we articulate today will well serve the ADA's goal\n\nof eliminating discrimination on account of disability. See generally 42 U.S.C. § 12101 (\"Findings\n\nand purpose\"). By evaluating claims from the perspective of a reasonable person in the employee's\n\nposition, we will continue to interpret the ADA to prohibit a wide range of job actions based on an\n\nemployee's disabled status. Transfers that result in lesser pay, responsibilities, or prestige19 will still\n\n\n\ndoes not constrain its employees' careers. Under a subjective standard, however, an employer\ncannot anticipate which employment actions a court will find to be adverse, because it cannot\nalways know what will make its employees \"unhappy.\"\n   19\n    In at least two cases, the Seventh Circuit has stated or implied that loss of prestige did not\nmake a transfer adverse. See Flaherty, 31 F.3d at 457; Spring, 865 F.2d at 886. It is somewhat\nunclear in these cases whether the court was holding that a loss of prestige was outweighed by\nother factors, was not significant, or was irrelevant. See Flaherty, 31 F.3d at 457; Spring, 865\nF.2d at 886. Regardless, we believe that loss of prestige, either within an organization or with\nregard to the general public, is an objective factor that a court should consider as part of the\nreasonable person test. Cf. de la Cruz, 82 F.3d at 21. Beyond the loss of prestige itself (a\nreasonable if egoistic employee goal much like salary or promotion), diminishment of prestige\nmay also affect an employee's marketability, another significant objective factor.\n\n                                                    19\n\fbe \"adverse.\" See, e.g., Baker 903 F.2d at 1519 (lesser pay); Collins, 830 F.2d at 704 (lesser\n\nresponsibilities); de la Cruz, 82 F.3d at 21 (lesser prestige). So, too, will transfers that involve\n\narduous travel or that impede an employee's professional growth or advancement. See, e.g.,\n\nMaddow, 107 F.3d at 852 (travel); de la Cruz, 82 F.3d at 21 (professional growth); Torre, 42 F.3d\n\nat 831 n. 7 (advancement). In other words, our reasonable person standard will continue to protect\n\ndisabled employees from transfers that are a form of demotion or that disrupt investment in\n\neducation, training, or seniority.\n\n        Turning to the specific facts of the present case, we are unable to determine from the current\n\nrecord whether Doe has suffered an adverse transfer. As we have explained, Doe's subjective\n\npreference for a psychoeducation position is not relevant to our inquiry. Although we greatly admire\n\nDoe's commitment to teaching such tragically disordered children, we do not consider the special\n\nmeaning that he ascribes to his former job.\n\n       The question that remains, then, is whether a reasonable person in Doe's position would have\n\nviewed as adverse the requirement that Doe complete ten credit hours (over three years) to obtain\n\ncertification in interrelated teaching. To support his argument that this transfer-induced obligation\n\nis adverse, Doe cites Rodriguez v. Board of Educ. of Eastchester Union Free Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"377811\"><a href=\"/opinion/377811/22-fair-emplpraccas-1259-23-empl-prac-dec-p-30921-carmen-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">620</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir.1980). In that Title VII case, a school district allegedly transferred a female, middle\n\nschool, art teacher to an elementary school as part of its policy of segregating female art teachers\n\ninto elementary education. See id. at 364-66. Prior to her transfer, the teacher had not only had\n\ntwenty years of experience in teaching middle school art classes but had also received a doctoral\n\ndegree in art education; her doctoral thesis was entitled \"A Model Arts Program for the Middle\n\nSchool of Eastchester School District Number 1.\" See id. After examining the school district's\n\n\n                                                 20\n\faction, the Rodriguez court concluded that the teacher had suffered an adverse transfer because\n\n\"substantially uncontradicted evidence indicated that the art programs at the elementary level were\n\nso profoundly different from those in the junior high school as to render utterly useless her twenty\n\nyears of experience and study in developing art programs for middle school children.\" Id. at 366.\n\nThis \"severe professional ... trauma,\" the court held, constituted an adverse, sex-based interference\n\nwith a condition or privilege of employment. See id.\n\n        The facts of Doe's case, however, are quite different. Unlike the plaintiff in Rodriguez, Doe's\n\ntransfer does not substantially obviate a specialized education; Doe does not have a bachelor's or\n\nhigher degree that is less applicable to interrelated education than it is to psychoeducation. Although\n\nDoe's transfer would disrupt his investment in his current Georgia certificate, his transfer from a\n\npsychoeducational to an interrelated classroom is not nearly as dramatic as Rodriguez's move from\n\na middle school to an elementary school.20 In other words, Doe may not have suffered the \"severe\n\nprofessional trauma\" evident in Rodriguez, though his transfer undoubtedly represented a \"personal\n\n\" setback.\n\n        Still, Doe does not need to show that his transfer would represent a \"severe trauma\" to a\n\nreasonable person in his position. Instead, he needs only to show that his transfer was, on the whole,\n\nobjectively adverse. Any adversity must be material; it is not enough that a transfer imposes some\n\nde minimis inconvenience or alteration of responsibilities.21 See Crady, 993 F.2d at 136. Moreover,\n\n\n   20\n    Although not mentioned in the Rodriguez opinion, such a transfer from a middle to an\nelementary school might also be thought to involve a significant loss of prestige, and perhaps\nlong-term prospects for advancement in the art education field as well.\n   21\n    It is important not to make a federal case out of a transfer that is de minimis, causing no\nobjective harm and reflecting a mere chip-on-the-shoulder complaint. However, it is equally\nimportant that the threshold for what constitutes an adverse employment action not be elevated\n\n                                                  21\n\fthe fact that an employee must learn as a result of a transfer does not mean that the transfer is per\n\nse adverse. See Williams, 85 F.3d at 274. In Williams, for example, the court held that a salesman's\n\ntransfer to a different product line was not adverse, despite the fact that he had to learn more new\n\nproducts than he would have if he had stayed put. See id. (concluding that the salesman's loss of\n\ncommission income while he learned about new products did not render his transfer adverse). As\n\nthe Williams court observed, all transfers require some learning, since they require employees to\n\nwork with new people or products and to assume new responsibilities. See id. Thus, any\n\ncoursework requirements for Doe must rise to a level that a reasonable person would deem\n\nmaterially adverse, taking into account both the pros and cons of such required education.\n\n        In sum, Doe must demonstrate that a reasonable person in his position would have found his\n\ntransfer to be adverse under all the facts and circumstances. Unfortunately, the district court has not\n\nmade sufficient findings with regard to any of these factors for us to undertake a meaningful review.\n\nTherefore, we have decided to remand the case to the district court for such proceedings as it deems\n\nnecessary for it to enter explicit findings of fact concerning the allegedly adverse nature of Doe's\n\ntransfer.22 Once having made these explicit findings, the district court should clearly explain why\n\n\n\nartificially, because an employer's action, to the extent that it is deemed not to rise to the level of\nan adverse employment action, is removed completely from any scrutiny for discrimination. In\nother words, where the cause or motivation for the employer's action was clearly its employee's\ndisability, a finding that the action does not rise to the level of an adverse employment action\nmeans that the action is not scrutinized for discrimination. An artificially high threshold for\nwhat constitutes an adverse employment action would undermine the purposes of the statute by\npermitting discriminatory actions to escape scrutiny. We believe that the purposes of the statute\nare appropriately served by requiring the fact finder to determine whether a reasonable person\nwould consider the action adverse under all the facts and circumstances.\n   22\n     The district court should make relevant subsidiary findings of fact, as well as an ultimate\nfinding of fact as to whether a reasonable person in Doe's position would have found the transfer\nto be adverse under all the facts and circumstances. Without in any way limiting the subject\n\n                                                  22\n\fit believes that a reasonable person in Doe's position would or would not have found the transfer to\n\nhave been an adverse employment action.\n\n        In determining whether Doe's transfer was adverse, the district court should not rely on its\n\ndetermination that the transfer was involuntary. In saying this, we do not mean to disturb the district\n\ncourt's finding on this issue but rather to make clear that the voluntary or involuntary nature of the\n\ntransfer is not relevant to the question of whether it was unlawfully adverse. Of course, a finding\n\nthat Doe's transfer was purely voluntary would have been dispositive in the School District's favor;\n\na transfer cannot be \"because of a disability\" if it occurred as the result of an employee's own\n\nrequest.

Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"360402\"><a href=\"/opinion/360402/18-fair-emplpraccas-1526-18-empl-prac-dec-p-8718-eugene-frank/\"><span class=\"volume\">585</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1285</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1289 (5th\n\nCir.1978) (voluntary transfer not unlawful under Title VII); Hooper v.

The fact that Doe's transfer was\n\ninvoluntary, however, does not in any way establish that it was legally adverse. Cf. Williams, 85\n\nF.3d at 274 (finding an \"involuntary\" transfer to be non-adverse). If a reasonable person in Doe's\n\nposition would have viewed the transfer as non-adverse, the district court should not consider Doe's\n\nsubjective, personal preference for his prior position.\n\n                                         III. CONCLUSION\n\n\n\n\nmatter of appropriate findings, the following would seem to be relevant: what is entailed in the\ncoursework required for certification in the new position; would such additional certification\nincrease Doe's career opportunities, and, if so, was such additional certification and resulting\nincrease in opportunities available to Doe in any event, or was this available to Doe only because\nof the transfer; whether the District's action would in effect limit Doe's opportunities in this\nschool district to the teaching of interrelated classes, and/or foreclose other opportunities, and, if\nso, whether the same would adversely affect Doe's employment opportunities or status within\neither this particular school district or the field of special education generally, see 29 C.F.R. Pt.\n1630, App. § 1630.5 (1998); and considering all of the relevant subsidiary findings, whether a\nreasonable person in Doe's position would consider the transfer to be adverse.\n\n                                                  23\n\f       We review in this case an injunction under the ADA that prohibits the School District from\n\ntransferring Doe out of the District's psychoeducation program because of his infection with HIV.\n\nTo establish a prima facie case under the ADA, Doe must prove that he has a disability; that he is\n\notherwise qualified to teach psychoeducation, with or without some reasonable accommodation;\n\nand that he has suffered an adverse employment action because of his HIV status (i.e., that the\n\nSchool District has discriminated against him because of his disability).\n\n       To determine whether Doe is qualified, the district court should have found and weighed the\n\nfour factors explained in Arline. The district court, however, failed to make explicit findings of fact\n\nregarding any dangers that Doe's illness might pose to violent psychoeducation students. In\n\naddition, the district court erred by applying a subjective standard for determining whether Doe's\n\ntransfer was adverse. Moreover, because the district court did not enter explicit findings of fact or\n\nconclusions of law with regard to those aspects of Doe's transfer that might render it objectively\n\nadverse, we believe that it would be imprudent for us to attempt to assess whether the School\n\nDistrict subjected Doe to an adverse employment action.\n\n       Therefore, we REVERSE the district court's judgment, VACATE the injunction, and\n\nREMAND the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  24\n\f</pre>",
