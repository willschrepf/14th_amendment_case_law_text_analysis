Holding that potential remedies existed in the Indiana Declaratory Judgment Act, IND.

Serrano, 454 U.S. 1, 3, 102 S.Ct. 18, 19, 70 L.Ed.2d 1 (1981) citing Ex parte Royall, 117 U.S. 241, 6 S.Ct. 734, 29 L.Ed. 868 (1886), when the district court dismissed Harris' petition it was less than clear whether Indiana provided judicial review of individual decisions of the state prison disciplinary system.  While in both Riner v. Raines, 274 Ind. 113, 409 N.E.2d 575 (1980) and Adams v. Duckworth, 274 Ind. 503, 412 N.E.2d 789 (1980) the Indiana Supreme Court made exceedingly clear that there was no constitutionally protected due process right to judicial review of the evidence presented to prison disciplinary boards to determine whether it was sufficient to support the decision reached, it remained less than clear whether the Indiana Court would also deny judicial review of alleged procedural errors made in connection with disciplinary proceedings.  One year later in Bates v. State, 426 N.E.2d 404 (Ind.1981) the Indiana Supreme Court, citing Riner and Adams, slightly clarified their opinion by summarily dismissing a complaint challenging both the evidentiary and procedural adequacy of the disciplinary hearing of a pre-trial detainee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 7, 1988, exactly three months after the district court ordered the dismissal of Harris' petition, in Hasty v. Broglin, 531 N.E.2d 200, (Ind.1988), the Indiana Supreme Court resolved the issue by definitively deciding that there was no constitutionally protected right to judicial review of individual decisions of the prison disciplinary system.  Since the petitioner in Hasty alleged only that \"the disciplinary procedures of the Westville Correctional Center violated his constitutional rights,\" Id.  (emphasis added), we are certain that Indiana courts now decline to review any individual decisions of the prison disciplinary system.  Id. at 201.    Since we are equally certain that a habeas corpus petition is the proper procedural vehicle to challenge a loss of good-time credits and a demotion in Time Earned Credits, Jackson v. Carlson, 707 F.2d 943, 946, (7th Cir.1983), we reverse the district court's dismissal of the petition for failure to exhaust available state court remedies and remand the case for consideration on the merits.
