SMITH, Circuit Judge:\n\n       This appeal follows a bench trial and judgment for the defendant insur-\ners on the claims of Seahawk Liquidating Trust (“Seahawk”) for payment of\ninsurance proceeds. There is no error, so we affirm.\n\n                                                I.\n       Seahawk 1 operated a fleet of drilling rigs, one of which was the\nJ/U SEAHAWK 3000 (the “Rig”), a three-legged, mat-supported jack-up drill-\ning rig with 375-foot legs used to perform drilling contracts in the Gulf of Mex-\nico beginning in 1974. 2 In February 2010, while moving between drilling loca-\ntions, the Rig encountered severe weather and jacked up out of the water for\nseveral days to avoid the harsh seas. Despite those efforts, the rough seas still\ncaused the legs to become misaligned.\n\n       Between February and April, Seahawk repaired the hydraulic-jacking\nsystem on several occasions, actions that were consistent with the Rig’s his-\ntory: It had had consistent wear-and-tear problems with, and required repairs\nto, its hydraulic-jacking system for more than twenty years. In April, the Rig\ntraveled to perform a drilling contract for Hilcorp Drilling Company (“Hil-\ncorp”), but Seahawk still did not know that the legs were misaligned. The Rig\n\n\n\n       1Seahawk Drilling, Inc. filed for bankruptcy, and its trustee pursued these claims\nagainst Lloyds. We refer to both as “Seahawk.”\n       2 A jack-up drilling rig drills for oil offshore at exploratory and developmental wells.\nThese rigs must be towed between drilling locations. Mat-supported jack-up rigs have a hull\nthat usually floats on the surface and connects to three or four legs that attach to a mat that\nmust be extended to the sea floor to raise the hull out of the water in order for the rig to drill.\nA hydraulic-jacking system extends the legs and mat down and elevates the hull using a\nmechanism by which pins that are attached to the hull enter the legs, push the legs down,\ncome out of the legs, re-enter, and push down again. The hydraulic-jacking system repeats\nthis process until the hull reaches the necessary height.\n                                                2\n\f    Case: 15-30324     Document: 00513347548     Page: 3   Date Filed: 01/19/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 15-30324\nfailed to jack up to a sufficient height to perform the Hilcorp contract because\nof other problems with the hydraulic-jacking system, leading Hilcorp to request\nthat Seahawk provide a replacement rig, which it did at a cost of $1,092,000.\n\n      Though Seahawk brought in a replacement, the Rig became stuck for\nseveral days at the Hilcorp location after an incident during the jacking-down\nprocess caused further damage to the hydraulic-jacking system. That incident\nrequired temporary repairs to the jacking system while the Rig was stuck and\nfurther such repairs once it successfully jacked down and moved to a dry dock.\nAt some point in May, while the Rig was in dry dock, Seahawk learned the legs\nwere misaligned but did not fix them because doing so would be too expensive.\n\n      After that dry-dock period, the Rig departed in early July to perform\nanother drilling contract, which it completed in calm weather, though the crew\nused an unorthodox method to jack it up—the Rig essentially jacked up one\nside of the hull at a time, rather than jacking up the entire hull uniformly.\nSeahawk’s expert, Crane Zumwalt, testified that the crew developed that pro-\ncedure to compensate for the misaligned legs and that the Rig always suc-\nceeded in jacking up if—as with this drilling contract—the weather and seas\nwere calm.\n\n      On July 21, 2010, the weather and seas were not calm as the Rig arrived\nto perform a drilling contract at East Cameron Island. In those conditions, the\nRig’s operating manual forbade its crew from jacking it into or out of the water,\nbut the crew attempted to jack it out of the water nonetheless. The hydraulic-\njacking system became disengaged when the Rig attempted to jack up, causing\nthe hull to slide down the legs and float in the sea. The crew, before evacuating,\nattempted to jack the Rig back up to no avail, and the Rig floated in the rough\nseas, sustaining further damage, for nearly thirty hours. Zumwalt testified\nthat the Rig would have been able to jack up—and jack back up after sliding\n\n                                        3\n\f     Case: 15-30324       Document: 00513347548         Page: 4    Date Filed: 01/19/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 15-30324\ndown—without incident if the weather had been calm.\n\n       After the July 21 storm, the Rig went to dry dock for further repairs until\nDecember 2010. The repairs again focused on the hydraulic-jacking system\ninstead of the misaligned legs; Seahawk never repaired the legs. While the Rig\nwas in dry dock, Seahawk submitted a claim to the insurers to cover the cost\nof repairs, alleged to be $16,969,860. The insurers rejected the claim.\n\n                                             II.\n       Seahawk sued the insurers for proceeds covering the physical damage to\nthe Rig and the loss on the Hilcorp contract. Seahawk’s insurance policy (the\n“Policy”) 3 included several key provisions:\n   • The general-coverage provision: “This insurance is against all risks of\n     direct physical loss of or physical damage to the property insured, subject\n     to the terms, conditions, and exclusions contained herein . . . . This In-\n     surance covers all the hull and machinery of the drilling unit(s) . . . .”\n   • The $10,000,000-deductible provision: “For the purpose of this [Deducti-\n     ble] Clause, each occurrence shall be treated separately, but it is agreed\n     that a sequence of losses or damages arising from the same occurrence\n     shall be treated as one occurrence.”\n   • The wear-and-tear exclusion: “There shall be no recovery under this In-\n     surance in respect of . . . [the] Cost of repairing or replacing any part\n     which may be lost, damaged or condemned solely due to . . . wear and\n     tear . . . .”\n   • The loss-of-contract provision (the “Contract Provision”): “[C]overage\n     hereunder shall include the loss of charter hire resulting from the ter-\n     mination and/or cancellation of [Seahawk’s] drilling contract(s) caused\n     by the insured drilling units being unable to operate following a claim\n     recoverable under [the general-coverage provision] if the deductible were\n     nil.”\n\n\n       3Each incident took place during one of two separate policy periods; one ended and\nthe other began on June 30, 2010. The content of the policies is identical; Swiss Re Interna-\ntional SE was an underwriter of the first policy only, and Hudson Specialty Insurance Com-\npany, Navigators Insurance Company, New York Marine & General Insurance Company,\nand Torus Insurance were underwriters on the second policy only.\n                                             4\n\f     Case: 15-30324      Document: 00513347548        Page: 5     Date Filed: 01/19/2016\n\n\n\n                                     No. 15-30324\n      Seahawk sought to recover the nearly $17 million for repairs made\nbetween February and December 2010. After a three-day bench trial, the dis-\ntrict court determined that the insurers had properly rejected the claim\nbecause they found that there were two occurrences, meaning two $10 million\ndeductibles had to be met, so Seahawk could recover nothing. 4 There were two\noccurrences, the court reasoned, because the sequence of losses (i.e., the dam-\nages and subsequent repairs) between February and July was proximately\ncaused by the February storm, but the sequence of losses after the July storm\nwas proximately caused by that latter storm. There were two separate proxi-\nmate causes of two different series of losses, so there were two occurrences.\n\n      Seahawk also sought to recover under the Contract Provision. It main-\ntained that the misalignment of the legs caused the Rig to be unable to operate\nand thereby occasioned the loss of the Hilcorp contract; the misalignment was\ncaused by a severe weather event and would have been recoverable if the\ndeductible were nil; thus, the loss on the Hilcorp contract was recoverable.\n\n       The district court found, to the contrary, that the misaligned legs (a the-\noretically covered loss) at most contributed to the defective hydraulic-jacking\nsystem (an excluded loss, as it was caused by wear-and-tear) in causing the\nloss of the contract. That finding required that the court apply the concurrent-\ncause doctrine.\n\n                                           III.\n       The Policy provides that it is governed by Texas law, under which the\ninterpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law, which we review\nde novo. Ran-Nan Inc. v. Gen. Accident Ins. Co. of Am., 252 F.3d 738, 739 (5th\n\n\n\n      4 The parties stipulated after trial that Seahawk could not recover if there was more\nthan one occurrence.\n                                            5\n\f     Case: 15-30324      Document: 00513347548         Page: 6    Date Filed: 01/19/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 15-30324\nCir. 2001). The parties agree that Texas substantive law applies. We review\nany underlying factual findings for clear error. Theriot v. United States, 245\nF.3d 388, 394–95 (5th Cir. 1998). A factual finding, such as a causation deter-\nmination, is clearly erroneous only “when the appellate court, viewing the evi-\ndence in its entirety, is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake\nhas been made.” Manderson v. Chet Morrison Contractors, Inc., 666 F.3d 373,\n376 (5th Cir. 2012). “Re-stated, our court may not find clear error if the district\ncourt’s finding is plausible in light of the record as a whole, even if this court\nwould have weighed the evidence differently.”              Id. at 376–77 (alterations\nomitted).\n\n                                            IV.\n       Because there were two occurrences, the district court properly denied\nSeahawk’s claim for the cost of repairs between February and December 2010.\nThat court’s proximate-cause analysis was the correct legal standard for deter-\nmining the number of occurrences, and the court did not clearly err in finding\nthat the February storm was not the proximate cause of the sequence of losses\nfollowing the July storm.\n\n                                            A.\n       Under Texas law, we must construe the Policy according to the general\nrules of contract construction to give effect to the intent. Gilbert Tex. Constr.,\nL.P. v. Underwriters at Lloyd’s London, 327 S.W.3d 118, 126 (Tex. 2010). 5 We\nbegin with the policy language, giving the terms their “ordinary and generally-\naccepted meaning unless the policy shows the words are meant in a technical\nor different sense.” Id. When an issue of state law is unclear, a federal court\n\n\n\n       5 Our decisions often refer to Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s as “Lloyd’s.” In their\nbriefs, however, these parties use “Lloyds.”\n                                             6\n\f     Case: 15-30324      Document: 00513347548        Page: 7    Date Filed: 01/19/2016\n\n\n\n                                     No. 15-30324\nmust make an “Erie guess” as to what the state’s highest court would decide. 6\n\n      Seahawk’s first claim turns entirely on the meaning of “occurrence,”\nwhich, according to its ordinary and generally-accepted meaning, is “some-\nthing that occurs” 7 or “something that takes place; esp: something that hap-\npens unexpectedly and without design.” 8 The parties appear not to contest\nthat the February storm was an occurrence; under that ordinary meaning, the\nJuly storm would appear to be an occurrence too.\n\n      Seahawk, however, contends that the Policy gives “occurrence” a techni-\ncal meaning by defining it to include “a sequence of losses or damages arising\nfrom the same occurrence.” The February storm, according to Seahawk, was\nan occurrence that damaged the Rig’s legs and was a but-for cause of the\ndamages suffered after the July storm because the damaged legs slowed down\nthe jacking-up process. Because the Rig’s damaged legs contributed to the\ndamages after the July storm, Seahawk characterizes all of the losses between\nFebruary and December as “arising from the same [February] occurrence.”\n\n      The insurers maintain, to the contrary, that any damages after the July\nstorm arose from that storm, not the February storm. Like the district court,\nthe insurers interpret the phrase “arising from” to require that the occurrence\nbe the proximate cause of the “sequence of losses or damages.” Thus, even if\nthe February storm damaged the legs and thereby contributed to the losses\nafter July, the July storm would be the proximate cause of—and the occurrence\ngiving rise to—the sequence of losses thereafter.\n\n      The real issue, then, is how to interpret the term “arising from” when\n\n\n      6Farm Credit Bank v. Guidry, 110 F.3d 1147, 1149 (5th Cir. 1997), overruled on other\ngrounds by Canfield v. Orso (In re Orso), 283 F.3d 686 (5th Cir. 2002).\n      7   “Occurrence,” WEBSTER’S NINTH NEW COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY (1984).\n      8   “Occurrence,” WEBSTER’S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY (1986).\n                                            7\n\f     Case: 15-30324        Document: 00513347548           Page: 8     Date Filed: 01/19/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 15-30324\nused to determine the number of occurrences under the Policy. Seahawk\nclaims the term requires only a causal link between the occurrence and sub-\nsequent losses because Texas law construes “arising from” broadly in favor of\ncoverage. The Texas Supreme Court has stated that “arise out of” requires\n“simply a causal connection or relation, which is interpreted to mean that there\nis but for causation, though not necessarily direct or proximate causation.” 9\nBut the court broadly interpreted “arising from”—or relied on cases broadly\ninterpreting that term—only in different contexts in which a broad interpre-\ntation would increase coverage. 10 The court seems not to have addressed the\nterm when used to determine the number of occurrences, so we must make an\nErie guess as to how the court would interpret “arising from” in this context.\n\n       For two reasons, that court likely would adopt the proximate-cause anal-\nysis applied by the district court. First, as the insurers point out, interpreting\n“arising from” broadly to require only a causal link when determining the num-\nber of occurrences can expand coverage in one case while contracting it in\nanother. For example, Seahawk desires a recognition of only one occurrence\nto avoid the application of multiple deductibles—a broad construction would\nincrease coverage. But in another case with identical facts but a slightly dif-\nferent insurance policy, an insured may desire multiple occurrences to avoid\n\n\n\n       9 Utica Nat’l Ins. Co. of Tex. v. Am. Indem. Co., 141 S.W.3d 198, 203 (Tex. 2004). We\ninterpret identically the terms “arising out of” and “arising from.” Am. States. Ins. Co. v.\nBailey, 133 F.3d 363, 370 n.7 (5th Cir. 1998).\n       10 See, e.g., Utica Nat’l Ins., 141 S.W.3d at 203 (interpreting “arising out of” broadly to\nreduce the scope of a policy’s exclusionary provision); Mid-Century Ins. Co. of Tex. v. Lindsey,\n997 S.W.2d 153, 156–59 (Tex. 1999) (broadly interpreting the term “arise out of” with regard\nto the use of a motor vehicle to cover the accidental discharge of a weapon after an attempt\nto enter the vehicle); Amerisure Ins. Co. v. Navigators Ins. Co., 611 F.3d 299, 312–13 (5th Cir.\n2010) (interpreting “arise out of” broadly to find that a conditional exclusion did not apply);\nRed Ball Motor Freight, Inc. v. Emp’rs Mut. Liab. Ins. Co. of Wis., 189 F.2d 374, 378 (5th Cir.\n1951) (interpreting “arising out of” the use of a truck broadly to provide coverage for damages\nfrom the driver’s negligent refueling).\n                                                8\n\f     Case: 15-30324       Document: 00513347548          Page: 9     Date Filed: 01/19/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 15-30324\nthe application of a single policy limit—a narrow construction would increase\ncoverage. Although Texas favors broadly construing policies to provide for cov-\nerage, there is no reason to predict―given the conflicting effects on\ncoverage―that the Texas Supreme Court would broadly construe “arising\nfrom” in this context.\n\n       Second, the proximate-cause analysis is at least implicitly consistent\nwith our and Texas’s precedent.            Three cases in particular illustrate this\npoint. 11 In each, the policy defined an occurrence as losses “arising out of” a\nsingle event or continuous exposure to a condition. And, in each, the court\nignored a but-for cause and focused on the direct, immediate, and proximate\ncause of the losses to determine the number of occurrences.\n\n       In Goose Creek, an arsonist set fire to two schools in the same school\ndistrict. Although the same arsonist was the but-for cause of both fires, the\nfires occurred several blocks and at least two hours apart, and neither caused\nthe other. The school district claimed there was one occurrence and thus one\ndeductible. According to the court, though, there were two occurrences because\nthe “two fires [were] distinguishable in space and time [and] one did not cause\nthe other.” Goose Creek, 658 S.W.2d at 341. Though the fires were traced back\nto the same but-for cause, there were two occurrences because the damages\ndirectly arose from two separate fires.\n\n       In U.E. Texas, nineteen buildings in an apartment complex suffered\ndamage from plumbing leaks. Hoping to pay one deductible, the owner con-\ntended there was only one occurrence because the leaks allegedly arose from\n\n\n\n       11 Goose Creek Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Cont’l Cas.

Tex., 332 F.3d\nat 278—the individual leaks—to conclude there were nineteen occurrences:\n\n         To point to the installation of the pipes as a single event which gave\n      rise to the damage to the nineteen buildings proves too much. Of course\n      it is true that had the plumbing system never been installed the leaks\n      would not have occurred. In this sense, it is true that the leaks which\n      independently damaged the nineteen buildings arose from the same\n      event. However, to look this far back would render any damage to the\n      complex occurring at any time related to the plumbing as arising from\n      the same event.\nId.\n        In H.E. Butt, one employee sexually abused two children in the same\nbathroom at the same grocery store but on different occasions. Hoping to limit\nliability under its self-insurance, the insured claimed there was only one occur-\nrence because both incidents arose from its negligent supervision of the em-\nployee. The court said that “[t]he question under Texas law becomes whether\nHEB’s negligent employment relationship with its pedophilic employee, rather\nthan the two acts of sexual abuse, ‘caused’ the injuries to the two children and\ngave rise to HEB’s liability.” H.E. Butt, 150 F.3d at 530. Although negligent\nsupervision plainly was a but-for cause of the children’s injuries, there would\nbe no injury or exposure to liability without the intervening sexual abuse. Id.\nat 531. There were two occurrences because\n      [w]hile a single occurrence may result in multiple injuries to multiple\n      parties over a period of time . . . [,] if one cause is interrupted and\n      replaced by another intervening cause, the chain of causation is broken\n      and more than one occurrence has taken place. Here, it is clear that\n      each child’s injuries are independent and caused by the separate acts of\n      sexual abuse.\nId. at 534 (alterations in original) (emphasis added) (internal citations\n                                    10\n\f    Case: 15-30324        Document: 00513347548          Page: 11     Date Filed: 01/19/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 15-30324\nomitted). 12    The court discounted a but-for cause and explicitly used the\nproximate-cause analysis to determine the number of occurrences.\n\n       The proper conclusion here follows naturally from the three above-cited\ndecisions: When an occurrence is technically defined to include a series of\nlosses arising from the same event, it includes only those losses proximately\ncaused by that event. The Policy defines an occurrence as a series of losses\n“arising from” the same occurrence and thereby incorporates the proximate-\ncause analysis. 13 Thus, the district court applied the correct legal standard in\ndetermining the number of occurrences by analyzing whether the February\nstorm was the proximate cause—not just a contributing or but-for cause—of\nthe sequence of losses between February and December 2010.\n\n                                              B.\n       The task remains to review the district court’s factual finding that the\nJuly storm—rather than the February storm—was the proximate cause of the\nsequence of losses after July. Again, we review the district court’s causation\ndeterminations only for clear error and uphold the same if plausible in light of\nthe record as whole. Manderson, 666 F.3d at 376–77.\n\n\n       12 The court relied on Appalachian Insurance Co. v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., 676\nF.2d 56, 61 (3d Cir. 1982), which held that to determine the number of occurrences “the court\nasks if there was but one proximate, uninterrupted, and continuing cause which resulted in\nall of the injuries and damage.” (Alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.)\n       13 Seahawk points to All Metals, Inc. v. Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Co., No. 3-09-\nCV-0846-BD, 2010 WL 3027045, at *1 (N.D. Tex. 2010), for the proposition that we none-\ntheless might broadly interpret “arising from.” All Metals does not support Seahawk’s argu-\nment, because the policy there defined “occurrence” to include all damages at least indirectly\nstemming from the same event. By explicitly defining “occurrence” to include indirect causes,\nthe parties had rejected the proximate-cause analysis. Cf. Fed. Ins. Co. v. Bock, 382 S.W.2d\n305, 307 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1964, writ ref’d n.r.e.) (“A proper definition of direct loss\nis loss proximately caused by the peril insured against.” (emphasis added)); Utica Nat’l, 141\nS.W.3d at 203 (equating direct causation with proximate causation). Unlike the parties in\nAll Metals, Seahawk and the insurers did not expressly reject the proximate-cause analysis,\nso we apply it.\n                                              11\n\f   Case: 15-30324    Document: 00513347548      Page: 12   Date Filed: 01/19/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 15-30324\n      The court noted that a proximate cause is “that cause which in a natural\nand continuous sequence unbroken by any new and intervening cause, pro-\nduces a loss, and without which the loss would not have occurred.” Bock,\n382 S.W.2d at 307. There was significant evidence to support the determina-\ntion that the July storm, not the February storm, was the proximate cause of\nthe sequence of losses after July. Zumwalt testified that the misaligned legs,\ncaused by the February storm, did not prevent the Rig from jacking up in calm\nweather—testimony that was further bolstered by the Rig’s successful comple-\ntion of a contract in calm weather in early July despite its misaligned legs.\nMoreover, Zumwalt testified that the Rig continued to jack up without incident\nfor at least three and one-half years after the events at issue, despite Sea-\nhawk’s never having repaired the legs. The evidence also showed that the\nweather was severe on July 21 before the crew attempted to jack up in violation\nof the operating manual. Finally, the court noted that five months elapsed\nbetween the February and July storms, and Seahawk knew of the misaligned\nlegs for at least two months before the July storm yet did not repair them.\n\n      We cannot say that, given this evidence, the court clearly erred by find-\ning the February storm alone, “in a natural and continuous sequence unbroken\nby any new and intervening cause,” would not have produced the sequence of\nlosses after the July storm. See id. The July storm was thus an intervening\nand proximate cause of the losses.\n\n                                      V.\n      The district court did not err in rejecting Seahawk’s claim under the Con-\ntract Provision. The concurrent-cause doctrine applies, and Seahawk could not\nrecover because it failed to comply with the requirements of that doctrine.\n\n      Under Texas law, the concurrent-cause doctrine applies any time “cov-\nered and non-covered perils combine to create a loss” and limits an insured’s\n                                      12\n\f    Case: 15-30324      Document: 00513347548       Page: 13    Date Filed: 01/19/2016\n\n\n\n                                    No. 15-30324\nrecovery to the “portion of the damage caused solely by the covered peril(s).”\nWallis v. United Servs. Auto. Ass’n, 2 S.W.3d 300, 302–03 (Tex. App.―San\nAntonio 1999, pet. denied). The doctrine is “a rule which embodies the basic\nprinciple that insureds are entitled to recover only that which is covered under\ntheir policy . . . .” Id. at 303. Therefore, “[i]t is essential that the insured\nproduce evidence which will afford a reasonable basis for estimating . . . the\nproportionate part of damage caused by a risk covered by the insurance policy.”\nTravelers Indem. Co. v. McKillip, 469 S.W.2d 160, 163 (Tex. 1971). “[A]n in-\nsured’s . . . burden of proof on allocation . . . is central to the claim for coverage.”\nWallis, 2 S.W.3d at 303. “Where a loss, however, is caused by a covered peril\nand an excluded peril that are independent causes of the loss, the insurer is\nliable.” Guar. Nat’l Ins. Co. v. N. River Ins. Co., 909 F.2d 133, 137 (5th Cir.\n1990) (emphasis added). Thus, the concurrent-cause doctrine applies to limit\nrecovery only when the loss is caused by two concurrent causes instead of two\nindependent causes.\n\n      The district court made a factual finding that the misaligned legs (a cov-\nered peril) at most combined with the defective hydraulic-jacking system (an\nexcluded peril) 14 to cause the loss of the Hilcorp contract. We review that fac-\ntual finding only for clear error, Manderson, 666 F.3d at 376–77, and conclude\nthere was sufficient evidence to support it. For example, Hilcorp requested\nthat Seahawk replace the Rig specifically because malfunctions with the\nhydraulic-jacking system were visible; Hilcorp, apparently, did not notice the\nmisaligned legs. Further, Zumwalt testified that nobody at Seahawk even\nknew the legs were misaligned at this point and that the Rig had experienced\nproblems with its hydraulic-jacking system continuously for over twenty years.\n\n\n\n      14Seahawk does not challenge the finding that the hydraulic-jacking system’s prob-\nlems were caused by wear-and-tear and were thus excluded from coverage.\n                                          13\n\f   Case: 15-30324     Document: 00513347548      Page: 14   Date Filed: 01/19/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 15-30324\nAdditionally, the court noted that the Rig continued to complete drilling con-\ntracts over the next three and one-half years without Seahawk’s ever repairing\nits misaligned legs. Given that evidence, the court did not clearly err by finding\nthe misaligned legs were at most a contributing cause—and certainly not an\nindependent cause—of the loss of the Hilcorp contract.\n\n      Seahawk advances several unpersuasive theories that even if the mis-\naligned legs and defective hydraulic-jacking system combined to cause the loss\nof the contract, the concurrent-cause doctrine should not apply. First, accord-\ning to Seahawk, the doctrine should not apply because the Contract Provision\ndoes not explicitly invoke it. That is a non-starter, because the concurrent-\ncause doctrine applies whenever a policy delineates covered and excluded per-\nils and such perils combine to cause a loss.\n\n      Second, Seahawk avers that the loss of a contract is different from physi-\ncal damages to which the doctrine typically applies. That notion, for which no\ncaselaw is cited, overlooks the fact that the Contract Provision requires that\nthe loss of contract be the result of physical damages that are recoverable\nunder the general-coverage provision. It would be entirely consistent with the\nconcurrent-cause doctrine for Seahawk to prove what proportion of the physi-\ncal damages that led to the loss of contract are attributable to a covered peril\nand for the insurers to pay out the Contract Provision according to that\nproportion.\n\n      Finally, Seahawk avers that the concurrent-cause doctrine would re-\nquire it to prove a claim “payable” under the Policy’s general coverage provision\nrather than one “recoverable . . . if the deductible were nil.” Seahawk contends\nthat all it must show to recover is some theoretically covered physical damage\nthat contributed to a loss of contract. Seahawk elides the principle that com-\npliance with the concurrent-cause doctrine, under Texas law, is a prerequisite\n\n                                       14\n\f    Case: 15-30324       Document: 00513347548          Page: 15     Date Filed: 01/19/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 15-30324\nto any recovery whatsoever. See Wallis, 2 S.W.3d at 303 (noting that allocation\nof damages is central to the insured’s claim). When, as here, a covered peril\nand excluded peril combine to cause a loss, no amount of damages is even recov-\nerable 15—let alone payable—until the insured complies with the concurrent-\ncause doctrine. Id. at 302–03 (“[T]he insured is entitled to recover only that\nportion of the damage caused solely by the covered peril(s).” (emphasis added)).\nThe district court properly applied the concurrent-cause doctrine to the Con-\ntract Provision.\n\n       The final point, that Seahawk did not meet its burden under the\nconcurrent-cause doctrine, is without controversy. Seahawk presented no evi-\ndence to segregate the damage attributable solely to the misaligned legs (the\ncovered peril) as compared to the defective hydraulic-jacking system (the\nexcluded peril). “Although [an insured] is not required to establish the amount\nof his damages with mathematical precision, there must be some reasonable\nbasis upon which the [fact finder’s] finding rests.” Id. at 304. Seahawk failed\nto meet its burden under the concurrent-cause doctrine because it presented\nno evidence to apportion damages between covered and excluded perils, so the\ndistrict court properly denied the claim under the Contract Provision.\n\n       AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n       15See BRYAN A. GARNER, DICTIONARY OF LEGAL USAGE 758 (3d ed. 2011) (“recoverable\n= compensable. . . . ‘capable of being legally obtained.’”). Seahawk’s reference to California\nInsurance Guarantee Association v. Liemsakul, 193 Cal. App. 3d 433 (Cal. Ct. App. 1987),\ndoes not change this conclusion; it stands for the uncontroversial proposition that “recovera-\nble” means “recovery that might have been possible” rather than that which is “actually\nrecovered.” Agreeing as we do with that proposition, a claim for damages under Texas law,\nwhere a covered peril and excluded peril combine to cause the loss, is not even recoverable\nunless and until the insured complies with the concurrent-cause doctrine.\n                                             15\n\f",

SMITH, Circuit Judge:\n\n       This appeal follows a bench trial and judgment for the defendant insur-\ners on the claims of Seahawk Liquidating Trust (“Seahawk”) for payment of\ninsurance proceeds. There is no error, so we affirm.\n\n                                                I.\n       Seahawk 1 operated a fleet of drilling rigs, one of which was the\nJ/U SEAHAWK 3000 (the “Rig”), a three-legged, mat-supported jack-up drill-\ning rig with 375-foot legs used to perform drilling contracts in the Gulf of Mex-\nico beginning in 1974. 2 In February 2010, while moving between drilling loca-\ntions, the Rig encountered severe weather and jacked up out of the water for\nseveral days to avoid the harsh seas. Despite those efforts, the rough seas still\ncaused the legs to become misaligned.\n\n       Between February and April, Seahawk repaired the hydraulic-jacking\nsystem on several occasions, actions that were consistent with the Rig’s his-\ntory: It had had consistent wear-and-tear problems with, and required repairs\nto, its hydraulic-jacking system for more than twenty years. In April, the Rig\ntraveled to perform a drilling contract for Hilcorp Drilling Company (“Hil-\ncorp”), but Seahawk still did not know that the legs were misaligned. The Rig\n\n\n\n       1Seahawk Drilling, Inc. filed for bankruptcy, and its trustee pursued these claims\nagainst Lloyds. We refer to both as “Seahawk.”\n       2 A jack-up drilling rig drills for oil offshore at exploratory and developmental wells.\nThese rigs must be towed between drilling locations. Mat-supported jack-up rigs have a hull\nthat usually floats on the surface and connects to three or four legs that attach to a mat that\nmust be extended to the sea floor to raise the hull out of the water in order for the rig to drill.\nA hydraulic-jacking system extends the legs and mat down and elevates the hull using a\nmechanism by which pins that are attached to the hull enter the legs, push the legs down,\ncome out of the legs, re-enter, and push down again. The hydraulic-jacking system repeats\nthis process until the hull reaches the necessary height.\n                                                2\n\f    Case: 15-30324     Document: 00513347548     Page: 3   Date Filed: 01/19/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 15-30324\nfailed to jack up to a sufficient height to perform the Hilcorp contract because\nof other problems with the hydraulic-jacking system, leading Hilcorp to request\nthat Seahawk provide a replacement rig, which it did at a cost of $1,092,000.\n\n      Though Seahawk brought in a replacement, the Rig became stuck for\nseveral days at the Hilcorp location after an incident during the jacking-down\nprocess caused further damage to the hydraulic-jacking system. That incident\nrequired temporary repairs to the jacking system while the Rig was stuck and\nfurther such repairs once it successfully jacked down and moved to a dry dock.\nAt some point in May, while the Rig was in dry dock, Seahawk learned the legs\nwere misaligned but did not fix them because doing so would be too expensive.\n\n      After that dry-dock period, the Rig departed in early July to perform\nanother drilling contract, which it completed in calm weather, though the crew\nused an unorthodox method to jack it up—the Rig essentially jacked up one\nside of the hull at a time, rather than jacking up the entire hull uniformly.\nSeahawk’s expert, Crane Zumwalt, testified that the crew developed that pro-\ncedure to compensate for the misaligned legs and that the Rig always suc-\nceeded in jacking up if—as with this drilling contract—the weather and seas\nwere calm.\n\n      On July 21, 2010, the weather and seas were not calm as the Rig arrived\nto perform a drilling contract at East Cameron Island. In those conditions, the\nRig’s operating manual forbade its crew from jacking it into or out of the water,\nbut the crew attempted to jack it out of the water nonetheless. The hydraulic-\njacking system became disengaged when the Rig attempted to jack up, causing\nthe hull to slide down the legs and float in the sea. The crew, before evacuating,\nattempted to jack the Rig back up to no avail, and the Rig floated in the rough\nseas, sustaining further damage, for nearly thirty hours. Zumwalt testified\nthat the Rig would have been able to jack up—and jack back up after sliding\n\n                                        3\n\f     Case: 15-30324       Document: 00513347548         Page: 4    Date Filed: 01/19/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 15-30324\ndown—without incident if the weather had been calm.\n\n       After the July 21 storm, the Rig went to dry dock for further repairs until\nDecember 2010. The repairs again focused on the hydraulic-jacking system\ninstead of the misaligned legs; Seahawk never repaired the legs. While the Rig\nwas in dry dock, Seahawk submitted a claim to the insurers to cover the cost\nof repairs, alleged to be $16,969,860. The insurers rejected the claim.\n\n                                             II.\n       Seahawk sued the insurers for proceeds covering the physical damage to\nthe Rig and the loss on the Hilcorp contract. Seahawk’s insurance policy (the\n“Policy”) 3 included several key provisions:\n   • The general-coverage provision: “This insurance is against all risks of\n     direct physical loss of or physical damage to the property insured, subject\n     to the terms, conditions, and exclusions contained herein . . . . This In-\n     surance covers all the hull and machinery of the drilling unit(s) . . . .”\n   • The $10,000,000-deductible provision: “For the purpose of this [Deducti-\n     ble] Clause, each occurrence shall be treated separately, but it is agreed\n     that a sequence of losses or damages arising from the same occurrence\n     shall be treated as one occurrence.”\n   • The wear-and-tear exclusion: “There shall be no recovery under this In-\n     surance in respect of . . . [the] Cost of repairing or replacing any part\n     which may be lost, damaged or condemned solely due to . . . wear and\n     tear . . . .”\n   • The loss-of-contract provision (the “Contract Provision”): “[C]overage\n     hereunder shall include the loss of charter hire resulting from the ter-\n     mination and/or cancellation of [Seahawk’s] drilling contract(s) caused\n     by the insured drilling units being unable to operate following a claim\n     recoverable under [the general-coverage provision] if the deductible were\n     nil.”\n\n\n       3Each incident took place during one of two separate policy periods; one ended and\nthe other began on June 30, 2010. The content of the policies is identical; Swiss Re Interna-\ntional SE was an underwriter of the first policy only, and Hudson Specialty Insurance Com-\npany, Navigators Insurance Company, New York Marine & General Insurance Company,\nand Torus Insurance were underwriters on the second policy only.\n                                             4\n\f     Case: 15-30324      Document: 00513347548        Page: 5     Date Filed: 01/19/2016\n\n\n\n                                     No. 15-30324\n      Seahawk sought to recover the nearly $17 million for repairs made\nbetween February and December 2010. After a three-day bench trial, the dis-\ntrict court determined that the insurers had properly rejected the claim\nbecause they found that there were two occurrences, meaning two $10 million\ndeductibles had to be met, so Seahawk could recover nothing. 4 There were two\noccurrences, the court reasoned, because the sequence of losses (i.e., the dam-\nages and subsequent repairs) between February and July was proximately\ncaused by the February storm, but the sequence of losses after the July storm\nwas proximately caused by that latter storm. There were two separate proxi-\nmate causes of two different series of losses, so there were two occurrences.\n\n      Seahawk also sought to recover under the Contract Provision. It main-\ntained that the misalignment of the legs caused the Rig to be unable to operate\nand thereby occasioned the loss of the Hilcorp contract; the misalignment was\ncaused by a severe weather event and would have been recoverable if the\ndeductible were nil; thus, the loss on the Hilcorp contract was recoverable.\n\n       The district court found, to the contrary, that the misaligned legs (a the-\noretically covered loss) at most contributed to the defective hydraulic-jacking\nsystem (an excluded loss, as it was caused by wear-and-tear) in causing the\nloss of the contract.

Because the Rig’s damaged legs contributed to the\ndamages after the July storm, Seahawk characterizes all of the losses between\nFebruary and December as “arising from the same [February] occurrence.”\n\n      The insurers maintain, to the contrary, that any damages after the July\nstorm arose from that storm, not the February storm. Like the district court,\nthe insurers interpret the phrase “arising from” to require that the occurrence\nbe the proximate cause of the “sequence of losses or damages.” Thus, even if\nthe February storm damaged the legs and thereby contributed to the losses\nafter July, the July storm would be the proximate cause of—and the occurrence\ngiving rise to—the sequence of losses thereafter.\n\n      The real issue, then, is how to interpret the term “arising from” when\n\n\n      6Farm Credit Bank v.

Seahawk\nclaims the term requires only a causal link between the occurrence and sub-\nsequent losses because Texas law construes “arising from” broadly in favor of\ncoverage. The Texas Supreme Court has stated that “arise out of” requires\n“simply a causal connection or relation, which is interpreted to mean that there\nis but for causation, though not necessarily direct or proximate causation.” 9\nBut the court broadly interpreted “arising from”—or relied on cases broadly\ninterpreting that term—only in different contexts in which a broad interpre-\ntation would increase coverage. 10 The court seems not to have addressed the\nterm when used to determine the number of occurrences, so we must make an\nErie guess as to how the court would interpret “arising from” in this context.\n\n       For two reasons, that court likely would adopt the proximate-cause anal-\nysis applied by the district court. First, as the insurers point out, interpreting\n“arising from” broadly to require only a causal link when determining the num-\nber of occurrences can expand coverage in one case while contracting it in\nanother. For example, Seahawk desires a recognition of only one occurrence\nto avoid the application of multiple deductibles—a broad construction would\nincrease coverage.

There was significant evidence to support the determina-\ntion that the July storm, not the February storm, was the proximate cause of\nthe sequence of losses after July. Zumwalt testified that the misaligned legs,\ncaused by the February storm, did not prevent the Rig from jacking up in calm\nweather—testimony that was further bolstered by the Rig’s successful comple-\ntion of a contract in calm weather in early July despite its misaligned legs.\nMoreover, Zumwalt testified that the Rig continued to jack up without incident\nfor at least three and one-half years after the events at issue, despite Sea-\nhawk’s never having repaired the legs. The evidence also showed that the\nweather was severe on July 21 before the crew attempted to jack up in violation\nof the operating manual. Finally, the court noted that five months elapsed\nbetween the February and July storms, and Seahawk knew of the misaligned\nlegs for at least two months before the July storm yet did not repair them.\n\n      We cannot say that, given this evidence, the court clearly erred by find-\ning the February storm alone, “in a natural and continuous sequence unbroken\nby any new and intervening cause,” would not have produced the sequence of\nlosses after the July storm.

Thus, the concurrent-cause doctrine applies to limit\nrecovery only when the loss is caused by two concurrent causes instead of two\nindependent causes.\n\n      The district court made a factual finding that the misaligned legs (a cov-\nered peril) at most combined with the defective hydraulic-jacking system (an\nexcluded peril) 14 to cause the loss of the Hilcorp contract. We review that fac-\ntual finding only for clear error, Manderson, 666 F.3d at 376–77, and conclude\nthere was sufficient evidence to support it. For example, Hilcorp requested\nthat Seahawk replace the Rig specifically because malfunctions with the\nhydraulic-jacking system were visible; Hilcorp, apparently, did not notice the\nmisaligned legs. Further, Zumwalt testified that nobody at Seahawk even\nknew the legs were misaligned at this point and that the Rig had experienced\nproblems with its hydraulic-jacking system continuously for over twenty years.\n\n\n\n      14Seahawk does not challenge the finding that the hydraulic-jacking system’s prob-\nlems were caused by wear-and-tear and were thus excluded from coverage.\n                                          13\n\f   Case: 15-30324     Document: 00513347548      Page: 14   Date Filed: 01/19/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 15-30324\nAdditionally, the court noted that the Rig continued to complete drilling con-\ntracts over the next three and one-half years without Seahawk’s ever repairing\nits misaligned legs. Given that evidence, the court did not clearly err by finding\nthe misaligned legs were at most a contributing cause—and certainly not an\nindependent cause—of the loss of the Hilcorp contract.\n\n      Seahawk advances several unpersuasive theories that even if the mis-\naligned legs and defective hydraulic-jacking system combined to cause the loss\nof the contract, the concurrent-cause doctrine should not apply. First, accord-\ning to Seahawk, the doctrine should not apply because the Contract Provision\ndoes not explicitly invoke it. That is a non-starter, because the concurrent-\ncause doctrine applies whenever a policy delineates covered and excluded per-\nils and such perils combine to cause a loss.\n\n      Second, Seahawk avers that the loss of a contract is different from physi-\ncal damages to which the doctrine typically applies. That notion, for which no\ncaselaw is cited, overlooks the fact that the Contract Provision requires that\nthe loss of contract be the result of physical damages that are recoverable\nunder the general-coverage provision. It would be entirely consistent with the\nconcurrent-cause doctrine for Seahawk to prove what proportion of the physi-\ncal damages that led to the loss of contract are attributable to a covered peril\nand for the insurers to pay out the Contract Provision according to that\nproportion.\n\n      Finally, Seahawk avers that the concurrent-cause doctrine would re-\nquire it to prove a claim “payable” under the Policy’s general coverage provision\nrather than one “recoverable . . . if the deductible were nil.” Seahawk contends\nthat all it must show to recover is some theoretically covered physical damage\nthat contributed to a loss of contract. Seahawk elides the principle that com-\npliance with the concurrent-cause doctrine, under Texas law, is a prerequisite\n\n                                       14\n\f    Case: 15-30324       Document: 00513347548          Page: 15     Date Filed: 01/19/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 15-30324\nto any recovery whatsoever. See Wallis, 2 S.W.3d at 303 (noting that allocation\nof damages is central to the insured’s claim). When, as here, a covered peril\nand excluded peril combine to cause a loss, no amount of damages is even recov-\nerable 15—let alone payable—until the insured complies with the concurrent-\ncause doctrine. Id. at 302–03 (“[T]he insured is entitled to recover only that\nportion of the damage caused solely by the covered peril(s).” (emphasis added)).\nThe district court properly applied the concurrent-cause doctrine to the Con-\ntract Provision.\n\n       The final point, that Seahawk did not meet its burden under the\nconcurrent-cause doctrine, is without controversy. Seahawk presented no evi-\ndence to segregate the damage attributable solely to the misaligned legs (the\ncovered peril) as compared to the defective hydraulic-jacking system (the\nexcluded peril). “Although [an insured] is not required to establish the amount\nof his damages with mathematical precision, there must be some reasonable\nbasis upon which the [fact finder’s] finding rests.” Id. at 304. Seahawk failed\nto meet its burden under the concurrent-cause doctrine because it presented\nno evidence to apportion damages between covered and excluded perils, so the\ndistrict court properly denied the claim under the Contract Provision.\n\n       AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n       15See BRYAN A. GARNER, DICTIONARY OF LEGAL USAGE 758 (3d ed. 2011) (“recoverable\n= compensable. . . . ‘capable of being legally obtained.’”). Seahawk’s reference to California\nInsurance Guarantee Association v.

App. 1987),\ndoes not change this conclusion; it stands for the uncontroversial proposition that “recovera-\nble” means “recovery that might have been possible” rather than that which is “actually\nrecovered.” Agreeing as we do with that proposition, a claim for damages under Texas law,\nwhere a covered peril and excluded peril combine to cause the loss, is not even recoverable\nunless and until the insured complies with the concurrent-cause doctrine.\n                                             15\n\f</pre>",
