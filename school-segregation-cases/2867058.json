The district\n\ngranted Rutgers' motion for summary judgment and dismissed Professor San Filippo's\n\n          On appeal, San Filippo, with support from the Rutgers Council of American\n\nAssociation of University Professors Chapters (\"Rutgers AAUP\") as amicus, challenge\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment in Rutgers' favor:   (1) on San Filippo's\n\nthat he was dismissed in retaliation for the exercise of his first amendment rights\n\n(2) on San Filippo's claim that Rutgers violated his right to procedural due proces\n\nbecause the panel that recommended his dismissal had, according to San Filippo, a\n\nfinancial incentive to recommend dismissal.\n\n          Part I of this opinion outlines the factual background and procedural his\n\nthis case.   Part II analyzes the legal issues posed by San Filippo's first amendmen\n\nclaim.   Part III addresses San Filippo's due process claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fI.        Factual background and procedural history\n\n          Because San Filippo appeals from the district court's grant of Rutgers' m\n\nfor summary judgment, the following factual recital accepts as true all evidence pr\n\nby non-movant San Filippo, with all reasonable inferences drawn in his favor.\n\n          On November 25, 1985, Dean Tilden Edelstein told San Filippo and his Rutg\n\nAAUP counsellor, Wells Keddie,0 of allegations that San Filippo had harassed, explo\n\nand attempted to exploit visiting scholars from the People's Republic of China.      On\n\nJanuary 6, 1986, Dean Edelstein sent San Filippo a letter stating the complaints ag\n\nhim.   As required by one of the University's dismissal regulations, advice about wh\n\ndismissal proceedings should be commenced was sought from two groups of San Filippo\n\nfaculty peers and three academic officers of the University.   On February 14, 1986,\n\ntenured faculty members of the chemistry department passed a resolution concluding\n\nthe charges against San Filippo, if proven, represented grounds for dismissal.    Aft\n\nAppointments and Promotion Committee, the University Provost, and the Chief Academi\n\nOfficer concurred in the sentiment expressed in that resolution, Rutgers University\n\nPresident Edward Bloustein wrote a letter to San Filippo, dated October 1, 1986, in\n\nhe described the formal charges against San Filippo.   President Bloustein further\n\nindicated that, if San Filippo did not make a timely request for a hearing, Preside\n\nBloustein would recommend to the University's Board of Governors that San Filippo b\ndismissed based on the charges outlined in the letter.\n\n          San Filippo exercised his right to a hearing before a panel of five facul\n\npeers (the \"Senate Panel\") which, after a forty-six day hearing, concluded that San\n\nFilippo had committed almost all of the offenses charged.   In a forty-four page rep\n\nissued on December 21, 1987, the Senate Panel recommended that San Filippo be strip\n\n0\n The Rutgers AAUP is the recognized agent for collective bargaining under state law\nRutgers University faculty members, including Professor San Filippo.

The Board of Governors unanimously\n\nconcluded in its sixty-page opinion that the Senate Panel's findings were supported\n\nevidence.    On May 13, 1988, the Board of Governors voted to dismiss San Filippo on\n\nbasis of nine charges of misconduct.    One member of the seven-member Board --Walter\n\nWechsler -- voted against dismissal because he believed that the sanction was too s\n\nWechsler has not been named as a defendant.\n\n            San Filippo filed the instant action on June 13, 1988. He alleges, among\n\nthings, that disciplinary proceedings were initiated against him and that he was di\n\nin retaliation for the numerous (1) grievances and lawsuits he had instituted, and\n\ncomplaints he had voiced, against Rutgers University and various University officia\n\nbetween 1977 and 1986 -- activities that he contends are protected by the first ame\n\n\n\nA.          San Filippo's alleged protected activities\n\n            In 1977, San Filippo wrote a letter to the then chemistry department chai\n\nProfessor Sidney Toby, complaining about dangerous conditions in the chemistry\n\nlaboratories, conditions that had been described by the New Jersey Department of He\n\n\"generally unsatisfactory.\"    In 1979, in response to a newspaper reporter's questio\n\nconcerning a student's collapse due to noxious fumes during a chemistry experiment,\n\nFilippo stated -- as reported by the newspaper on January 30, 1979 --that undergrad\nstudents were being subjected to a \"health hazard and an absolute danger\" and that\n\n\"minimum safety requirements are not being met.\"    San Filippo was berated by the th\n\ndepartment chairman, Professor Joseph Potenza, and by an administrator for making t\n\ncomments.    San Filippo's comments led to the creation of an American Association of\n\nUniversity Professors - University Safety Committee.\n\n            In 1977 and 1978, San Filippo testified before a grand jury regarding an\ninvestigation into the manufacture of illegal drugs in the chemistry laboratories.\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\fPotenza criticized San Filippo for his \"disloyalty\" and for \"washing the department\n\ndirty linen in public.\"\n\n          In 1983-84, San Filippo became embroiled in a dispute over what he descri\n\nan effort by members of the chemistry department's instruments committee to obtain\n\nfunding for a mass spectrometer by misrepresenting the department's need for such a\n\ninstrument.   San Filippo threatened to tell the federal funding agency the truth ab\n\ndepartment's needs.   The committee members wrote a memorandum to Potenza, as depart\n\nchairman, protesting San Filippo's threats to undermine their efforts to obtain a m\n\nspectrometer.   Potenza told San Filippo that he intended to place the memorandum in\n\nFilippo's personnel file.   San Filippo contacted the United States Attorney's offic\n\nregarding this action against him, and an Assistant United States Attorney told San\n\nFilippo that such an action would be characterized as an effort to obstruct justice\n\nSan Filippo told Potenza what the government lawyer had said, Potenza had the lette\n\nreprimand removed from San Filippo's personnel file.\n\n          Between 1979 and 1986, San Filippo complained about certain financial\n\nirregularities in the chemistry department, particularly efforts to divert funds fr\n\nFilippo's federal grants.   In October 1985, San Filippo objected to a proposal by t\n\ndepartment chairman, Professor Robert Boikess, to impose a \"shop user's fee,\" which\n\nFilippo characterized as illegal double billing of chemistry department members.\n\n          In 1981, the chemistry department declined to recommend San Filippo for\npromotion to full professorship.    San Filippo filed a grievance in 1982, contending\n\nhe had been denied promotion through manipulation of his promotion packet.   While t\n\ngrievance was pending, the chemistry department recommended that San Filippo be pro\n\nto full professor, effective July 1984.   Although the grievance committee ultimatel\n\nagreed with San Filippo that he should have been promoted, the University took the\nposition that the issue was moot.   In September 1985, San Filippo filed a lawsuit i\n\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\fcourt in which he contended that he was entitled to have his promotion effective Ju\n\n1982. That suit is still pending.\n\n            In 1984, San Filippo grieved the fact that he had been denied a merit sal\n\nincrease.    The University rejected San Filippo's grievance, and he filed for non-bi\n\narbitration. The first hearings in the arbitration occurred in October 1985. On Sep\n\n10, 1986, Boikess testified for the University. Regarding this event, the arbitrato\n\ncommented in his decision dated December 26, 1986:\n               Little things are often very revealing. A transcript does not conve\n          full flavor of what transpires in the hearing room. Boikess was called o\n          last day of the hearing. He brought his own lawyer with him (Mr. Peirano\n\n                 San Filippo cordially greeted him before he took the stand. Boikess\n            not acknowledge the greeting and refused to acknowledge grievant's presen\n            the room.\n\n                 During his testimony, Boikess kept referring to grievant's \"self-\n            nomination\" [for the merit salary award]. His tone of voice was so caust\n            it sparked an inquiry from me. (The inference to be drawn by the tone of\n            employed was that a \"self-nomination\" was somehow less worthy).\n\n                 I specifically asked Boikess why he emphasized \"self-nomination.\" B\n            danced around the issue and did not really answer my question. It became\n            obvious that he would not answer, so I gave up. Further, the tenor and t\n            his testimony revealed his near-total contempt for San Filippo.\n\n                 I note in passing that most of the persons being considered were sel\n            nominated. The [merit salary award procedure] specifically provides for\n\n                 One would have to be a block of wood to fail to notice Dr. Boikess'\n            complete distaste for Joe San Filippo.\n\n\n(A.1155 n.21).    The arbitrator sustained San Filippo's complaint. He further noted\n\nopinion:\n\n\n            San Filippo testified, without contradiction, that he was criticized by\n            administration officials for talking to the school newspaper about unsafe\n            conditions in the laboratories. [San Filippo] was chairman of the Safety\n            Committee at the time. A student took ill. [San Filippo] was accused of\n            \"disloyal.\" Putting aside the serious first amendment issues the episode\n            (Pickering v. Board of Education, 391 U.S. 563), it seems to me that the\n            to the health of the students outweighs any possible harm to the reputati\n\n\n                                              7\n\f          those in authority that disclosure of lab conditions might have created.\n          Further, there is a difference to [sic] loyalty to the institution and th\n          purposes it is supposed to serve and fealty to the individuals who may, a\n          given moment, occupy positions of higher authority in the organization.\n          is more important in the scheme of things: bruised feelings because the\n          is tough and demanding or personal safety? . . .\n\n          While not directly at issue, there was some unsettling evidence that [Dr.\n          Filippo's] promotion packet had been surreptitiously removed and unfavora\n          material secretly inserted. [Dr. San Filippo] had to bring successful gr\n          action to rectify the situation. It would appear that someone was willing\n          to extra-ordinary lengths to deny [Dr. San Filippo] professional advantag\n          That kind of conduct is similar to what happened to [Dr. San Filippo] in\n          [merit salary award] review.\n\n          [Dr. San Filippo's] nomination was clearly judged under separate \"San Fil\n          rules\" that were applicable to no one else.\n\n          . . . .   I know a pipe job when I see one.\n\n\n(A.1161 n.29).\n\n          In November 1985, Dr. San Filippo brought a libel action in state court a\n\nthree administrators who accused San Filippo of deliberately falsifying time report\n\nrelating to one of his technical assistants.\n\n          Finally, San Filippo brought a lawsuit in state court against the Univers\n\nMarch 1986 complaining about, among other things, the University's decision to proh\n\nwithout a hearing of any kind -- graduate student assistance in San Filippo's resea\nprogram, because of the accusations against San Filippo.\n\n\n\nB.        The charges and proceedings against San Filippo\n\n          As explained above, on October 1, 1986, President Bloustein brought forma\n\nwritten charges against San Filippo. After a hearing before the Senate Panel, which\n\nrecommended dismissal,\n\nthe Board of Governors, which reviewed the findings of the Senate Panel for suffici\n\nthe evidence, concurred in the Senate Panel's findings sustaining the following cha\n\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\f          Charge 1: Your treatment of scholars visiting from the People's Republic\n          China and a Chinese Teaching Assistant violated the standards of professi\n          ethics required by all faculty members. More specifically, your treatmen\n          respect to these individuals, as set forth more fully in the attached doc\n          is as follows:\n\n          a. You took advantage of your professorial position and exploited Mr. He\n          Gao and Mr. Changhe Xiao, both visiting scholars from the People's Republ\n          China, by directing them or leading them to believe that they had no choi\n          to perform domestic work for you, such as garden work and indoor and outd\n          cleaning work during the period May through July 1985.0\n\n          c. You exploited Messrs. Gao and Xiao by representing that they would be\n          provided health benefits coverage and that you would deduct $700.00 from\n          salary to be paid each of them in order to cover the costs of such benefi\n          Despite deducting such sums, you did not provide coverage to either Mr. G\n          Mr. Xiao.\n\n          d. During the period of time that the above-named visiting Chinese schol\n          were at Rutgers, you threatened and harassed those individuals by repeate\n          stating that you would send them back to China and by directing abusive l\n          toward them.\n\n          e. On or about March 31, 1986, you interrupted without sufficient cause\n          laboratory class being conducted by Teaching Assistant, Zong Ping Chen.\n          continued that incident by treating her in an unprofessional, threatening\n          abusive manner, within the hearing of other individuals, including her st\n\n          Charge 2: On or about July 8, 1985, you directed Mr. Changhe Xiao, who h\n          injured himself while doing maintenance work at your house, to identify h\n          as Mr. Peng Zhou in Middlesex Hospital in order to have Mr. Xiao covered\n          Peng Zhou's medical insurance.\n\n          Charge 3: You encouraged and permitted individuals working under your di\n          and supervision to submit false time reports and to make inappropriate ch\n          against certain University accounts. Specifically:0\n\n          b. Ms. Marilyn Brownawell, who works directly under your supervision, su\n          time reports for the week ending August 17, 1984. She reported and was p\n          40 hours of work for that period, charged against the Chemistry Departmen\n          mass spectrometer account, even though you knew that she did not perform\n          work related to the mass spectrometer or indeed any compensable work for\n          of any kind during that period.0\n\n0\n The Senate Panel found that charge 1(b) was unproven, and the Board concurred in t\ndetermination.\n0\n The Senate Panel did not sustain charge 3(a), and the Board concurred in this\ndetermination.\n0\n Charge 3(c) was not sustained by the Panel, and the Board concurred in this\ndetermination.\n\n\n                                            9\n\f          Charge 4: You violated professional and academic standards and exploited\n          foreign visitors to the University by bringing to the University as post-\n          doctoral fellows Chinese scholars you knew did not have appropriate crede\n          and by charging stipends of such individuals, who did not possess doctora\n          degrees, to your NSF grant as post-doctoral fellows. Subsequently you sup\n          these individuals for admission to the graduate program in Chemistry, a f\n          which clearly established that they did not have the credentials to be po\n          doctoral fellows.0\n\n          Charge 5: During Fall 1985, you submitted an application for admission t\n          graduate program, including letters of reference, on behalf of Mr. Peng Z\n          one of the individuals referred to in #4 above. One of the letters of ref\n          submitted by you purportedly was written and signed by Liu Guozhi. In fa\n          that letter was not prepared by Liu Guozhi, and you had knowledge of the\n          and did not make it known when you submitted the letter.\n\n          Charge 6: On December 16, 1985, Professor Robert Boikess, Chair of your\n          department, specifically instructed you not to permit Mr. Peng Zhou, Mr.\n          Yuan Guo, or any other graduate student except those already associated w\n          your research group, to work in your laboratory, pending investigation of\n          allegations of exploitation and harassment lodged against you by visiting\n          Chinese scholars. Despite these specific instructions, you subsequently\n          permitted Cong-Yuan Guo, Zhen-min He, and Peng Zhou to perform work in yo\n          laboratory.\n\n\nIn the Board's opinion, the Board specifically found that the conduct described in\n\nsustained charges 1(a), 1(d) and 1(e) was a serious enough breach of the role of fa\n\nmember that, even if those were the only sustained charges, there would be sufficie\n\ncause for dismissal.   Accordingly, on May 13, 1988, the Board directed that San Fil\n\ndismissed from the University.\n\n          Board member Wechsler agreed with his colleagues' findings but felt that\ndismissal was too severe a sanction: \"Because this punishment is clearly out of pro\n\nto his alleged wrongdoing, and quite possibly tainted by a long history of animus,\n\nrespectfully dissent.\"   (A.322).\n\n\n\nC.        The procedural history of this case\n\n0\n The Senate Panel sustained this charge in regard to Mr. Peng Zhou, but not in rega\nMr. Cong-Yuan Guo. The Board concurred in both determinations.\n\n\n                                             10\n\f          On June 13, 1988, San Filippo filed this suit against the University and\n\nBoard members who voted in favor of his dismissal.   San Filippo sued under ยง1983 an\n\nlaw, alleging that the dismissal violated his speech, petition, equal protection, a\n\nprocess rights under the United States and New Jersey Constitutions, and violated h\n\ncommon law contract rights.\n\n          Following the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment on a number of\n\nthe district court granted San Filippo's motion for partial summary judgment on his\n\nthat the regulations pursuant to which he was dismissed were void for vagueness.    S\n\nFilippo v. Bongiovanni, 743 F. Supp. 327 (D.N.J. 1990).   The void-for-vagueness iss\n\ncertified for interlocutory appeal to this court; we reversed and remanded the case\n\nfurther proceedings.   San Filippo v. Bongiovanni, 961 F.2d 1125, 1139-40 (3d Cir. 1\n\nAfter the Supreme Court denied San Filippo's petition for certiorari, San Filippo v\n\nBongiovanni, 113 S. Ct. 305 (1992), the district court referred the remaining summa\n\njudgment motions to a magistrate judge.\n\n          In his Report and Recommendation, the magistrate judge recommended that s\n\njudgment be granted in defendants' favor on San Filippo's procedural due process cl\n\non his state law claims, but that summary judgment be denied on San Filippo's first\n\namendment/equal protection claim.0   Regarding the first amendment claim, the magist\n\njudge first explained that this circuit uses a three-part test to assess a public\nemployee's claim of retaliation for having engaged in a protected activity. First,\n\nplaintiff must show that he engaged in a protected activity.   Second, plaintiff mus\n\nthat the protected activity was a substantial factor motivating the dismissal decis\n\nFinally, defendant may defeat plaintiff's claim by demonstrating that the same acti\n\n\n\n\n0\n The parties agree that the analysis is the same under the first amendment and equa\nprotection claims. From this point, we refer to these claims as the first amendmen\nclaim.\n\n\n                                             11\n\fwould have taken place even in the absence of the protected conduct.0   See Holder v\n\nof Allentown, 987 F.2d 188, 194 (3d. Cir. 1993); Czurlanis v. Albanese, 721 F.2d 98\n\n(3d Cir. 1983) (citing Mt. Healthy City School Dist. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 283-87\n\n(1977)).\n\n           With respect to the first prong of this test, the magistrate judge conclu\n\nthat, unlike speech generally -- which is protected under the first amendment only\n\naddresses a matter of public concern -- San Filippo's lawsuits and grievances were\n\nactivities protected under the petition clause of the first amendment regardless of\n\nwhether they addressed matters of public concern.   The magistrate judge then noted\n\nfact-finder could reasonably infer that San Filippo's protected conduct was a subst\n\nfactor motivating the decision to dismiss him from the University.   Finally, the\n\nmagistrate judge recommended that San Filippo be given the chance to conduct additi\n\ndiscovery in order to rebut Rutgers' claim that San Filippo would have been dismiss\n\nin the absence of his protected activities. Because the magistrate judge believed t\n\ndefendants had not yet made relevant discovery material available to San Filippo, t\n\nmagistrate judge recommended that summary judgment be denied under Rule 56(f) of th\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.0\n\n\n\n\n0\n The burden of persuasion shifts to Rutgers with respect to the third prong of this\nIn this respect, the retaliatory discharge test differs from the Title VII rule\nestablished in Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248 (1981), an\nreaffirmed in St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks, 113 S. Ct. 2742 (1993), where the b\nof persuasion remains on the plaintiff even after he or she has proved a prima faci\nand the employer need only articulate -- not prove -- a non-discriminatory reason f\nactions.\n0\n          Rule 56(f) states in relevant part:\n\n           Should it appear from the affidavit of a party opposing the motion that t\n           party cannot for reasons stated present by affidavit facts essential to j\n           the party's opposition, the court may refuse the application for judgment\n           order a continuance to permit . . . discovery to be had or may make such\n           order as is just.\n\n\n                                             12\n\f           San Filippo did not object to the magistrate judge's recommendation that\n\nbe granted summary judgment on the state law claims.   Accordingly, in an opinion da\n\nSeptember 28, 1993, the district court accepted those recommendations and granted R\n\nsummary judgment on those claims.   San Filippo objected to the magistrate judge's\n\nrecommendation that Rutgers be granted summary judgment on his due process claim, a\n\nargued that he was entitled to summary judgment on that claim or at least to furthe\n\ndiscovery.   Rutgers objected to the magistrate judge's recommendation that summary\n\njudgment on San Filippo's first amendment claim be denied.\n\n          The district court adopted the magistrate judge's recommendation that sum\n\njudgment be granted on San Filippo's due process claim, but rejected the magistrate\n\njudge's recommendation that summary judgment be denied on San Filippo's first amend\n\nclaim.   With respect to the first amendment claim, the district court first disagre\n\nthe magistrate judge's conclusion that San Filippo's lawsuits and grievances were\n\nactivities protected under the first amendment petition clause regardless of whethe\n\naddressed a matter of public concern.   Instead, the district court held that lawsui\n\ngrievances, like speech generally, are protected activities under the first amendme\n\nif they address matters of public concern.\n\n          The district court concluded that some of San Filippo's speech addressed\n\nof public concern and was therefore protected under the first amendment.   The distr\ncourt also concluded that a fact-finder could reasonably infer that San Filippo's\n\nprotected conduct was a substantial factor motivating his dismissal.   However, the\n\ndistrict court held that there was no basis in the record from which a fact-finder\n\nreasonably conclude that San Filippo was dismissed because of his protected conduct\n\nrather than because of the misconduct described in the charges brought against him.\n\nMoreover, the district court rejected the magistrate judge's recommendation that a\non the summary judgment motion be delayed until after San Filippo had had an opport\n\nto conduct additional discovery, and instead held that San Filippo had received all\n\n\n                                             13\n\fdiscovery to which he was entitled.    Accordingly, the district court held that Rutg\n\nentitled to summary judgment on San Filippo's first amendment claim as well as on h\n\nprocess and state law claims, and dismissed San Filippo's complaint in its entirety\n\n            On appeal, San Filippo argues that the district court's order granting Ru\n\nsummary judgment on his first amendment claim should be vacated because the distric\n\nerred, (a) in granting Rutgers' motion for summary judgment without affording him a\n\nopportunity to take additional discovery, and (b) on the merits.    San Filippo also\n\ncontends that the district court's order granting Rutgers summary judgment on his d\n\nprocess claim should be vacated because there remains a material issue of fact rega\n\nthe question whether the Senate Panel had a pecuniary interest in the outcome of th\n\nproceedings against San Filippo, and because he was entitled to additional discover\n\n\nII.         San Filippo's first amendment claim\n\n            San Filippo first contends that the district court erred in denying his r\n\nmade pursuant to Rule 56(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,0 that the dist\n\ncourt delay its ruling on Rutgers' summary judgment motion until after he had time\n\nconduct further discovery.    San Filippo made various discovery requests on Septembe\n\n1989; Rutgers asked to have until November 7 to respond.    On November 24, San Filip\n\nwrote a 20-page letter to Rutgers pointing out inadequacies in Rutgers' response.\nNovember 29, Rutgers moved for summary judgment and the requested information was n\n\nsupplied.    San Filippo submitted a Rule 56(f) affidavit in support of its oppositio\n\nRutgers' motion for summary judgment.    The magistrate judge recommended that the ru\n\nthe summary judgment motion be deferred until after San Filippo had an opportunity\n\nadditional discovery.\n\n\n\n\n0\nThe text of this rule is quoted at note 8, supra.\n\n                                              14\n\f          The district court rejected the magistrate judge's conclusion that summar\n\njudgment should not be granted until San Filippo had an opportunity to discover add\n\ninformation. The court explained that San Filippo argued that \"he must see the reco\n\nother faculty persons similarly situated (i.e., persons who have been known to comm\n\nwere accused of committing, similar offenses, but against whom no sanctions, or not\n\nsevere a sanction was imposed).\"     Opinion at 42 (internal quotation omitted).   The\n\nrejected San Filippo's argument for two reasons.     First, the court concluded that \"\n\nmembers 'similarly situated' to plaintiff are those faculty members against whom fo\n\ncharges have been filed as to conduct which could lead to dismissal under the Unive\n\nregulations.\"   Opinion at 42-43.    The court explained that San Filippo received all\n\ninformation on June 9, 1989, pursuant to Rutgers' compliance with section I.1 of a\n\nStipulation dated May 19, 1989.     Second, the court concluded:\n\n\n          These [nine] charges together caused plaintiff's dismissal and it is only\n          tenured faculty member who had \"been known to commit\" or was \"accused of\n          committing\" offenses of the kind, number, and scope taken together with w\n          plaintiff is truly \"similarly situated.\" No one suggests that such a per\n          exists.\n\n\nOpinion at 44-45 (emphasis in original).     For these two reasons, the court conclude\n\nSan Filippo had received all of the discovery to which he was entitled.     See Opinio\n46.\n\n          San Filippo, with support from the Rutgers AAUP, argues that the district\n\nabused its discretion in denying San Filippo's request for a Rule 56(f) continuance\n\nUnder Contractors Assoc. v. City of Philadelphia, 945 F.2d 1260 (3d Cir. 1991), whe\n\nRule 56(f) motion should be granted \"depends, in part, on 'what particular informat\n\nsought; how, if uncovered, it would preclude summary judgment; and why it has not b\n\npreviously obtained.'\"    Id. at 1266 (quoting Lunderstadt v. Colafella, 885 F.2d 66,\nCir. 1989)).    A district court has discretion in acting on Rule 56(f) motions. See\n\n\n\n                                               15\n\f1267.    However, where relevant information sought is in the hands of the moving par\n\ndistrict court should grant a Rule 56(f) motion almost as a matter of course unless\n\ninformation is otherwise available to the non-movant.\"    Id.\n\n            In Contractors Assoc., the district court granted Contractors Association\n\nEastern Philadelphia and other trade associations summary judgment on their claim t\n\nPhiladelphia's public contract minority set-aside law violated the equal protection\n\nof the fourteenth amendment.    On appeal, United Minority Associates Enterprises arg\n\nthat the district court --to which Minority Associates had submitted a Rule 56(f)\n\naffidavit along with their opposition to summary judgment -- erred by granting the\n\njudgment motion without giving Minority Associates an opportunity to pursue discove\n\nthe existence of discrimination in the Philadelphia construction market that could\n\nvarious set-asides.   We held that the district court abused its discretion by not g\n\na continuance before ruling on the summary judgment motion.     See Contractors Assoc.\n\nF.2d at 1268.\n\n            In addressing the first part of the Contractors Assoc. test -- what infor\n\nis sought and how it would preclude summary judgment -- San Filippo and the Rutgers\n\nargue that the district court's definition of \"similarly situated\" was too narrow.\n\nagree.    Among other things, San Filippo argues that, but for his protected activity\n\nwould not have been charged at all.    To limit his discovery to individuals who were\nfact brought up on similar charges is, therefore, not adequately responsive to San\n\nFilippo's needs.    Nor should San Filippo be limited to discovery of individuals who\n\ncommitted nine charges of comparable seriousness yet were not disciplined.     The Sup\n\nCourt explained in McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., 427 U.S. 273, 283 n.11 (\n\n\n           [P]recise equivalence in culpability between employees is not the questio\n           we indicated in [McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 804 (197\n           allegation that other \"employees involved in acts against [the employer]\n           comparable seriousness . . . were nevertheless retained . . .\" is adequat\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\f          plead an inferential case that the employer's reliance on his discharged\n          employee's misconduct as grounds for terminating him was merely a pretext\n\n\nSanta Fe, 427 U.S. at 283 n.11 (emphasis and omissions in Santa Fe).\n\n           In analogous fashion, this court, in Bennun v. Rutgers State University,\n\nF.2d 154 (3d Cir. 1991), rejected a contention that the district court had erred in\n\ncomparing the defendant University's decision not to tenure the plaintiff professor\n\nthe University's decision to tenure another professor who had higher ratings than t\n\nplaintiff in two categories -- teaching effectiveness and general usefulness.   See\n\n178.   We reasoned that to preclude such a comparison \"would change 'similarly situa\n\n'identically situated.'\" Id.    Although \"[t]he propriety of such a comparison is cas\n\nspecific,\" there is a \"broad sweep of relevancy.\"   Id. Admittedly, the district cou\n\nand should impose limits on discovery that is calculated to lead to the unearthing\n\nmarginally relevant evidence.   Nonetheless, the limits imposed here were too severe\n\n          The Board indicated in its opinion that it viewed charges 1(a), 1(d) and\n\nthe most serious charges against San Filippo, meriting his dismissal even if the ot\n\ncharges were not sustained.    San Filippo accordingly should be permitted to discove\n\nwhether the University knew of other employees who committed one or more offenses o\n\ncomparable or greater seriousness yet did not discipline these employees, or impose\nsanctions far less severe than dismissal.   Although the district court's suggestion\n\nSan Filippo was disciplined because of a combination of misdeeds rather than for an\n\nsingle misdeed is plausible, this type of evaluation is one that should generally b\n\nto the fact-finder.   Because the information San Filippo sought in discovery was of\n\nsort that might prevent the entry of summary judgment and was under the control of\n\nRutgers, we conclude that it was an abuse of discretion to deny San Filippo's Rule\n\n\n\n\n                                              17\n\fmotion.    Accordingly, we will vacate the district court's grant of summary judgment\n\nFilippo's first amendment claim and remand for further discovery.0\n\n           Even without further discovery, there is sufficient evidence in the recor\n\nwhich a fact-finder could conclude that, in the absence of his protected activities\n\nFilippo would not have been dismissed based on the conduct described in the charges\n\nagainst him.    First, Dean Edelstein was interviewed by the local New Brunswick news\n\nThe Home News, shortly after San Filippo was dismissed.    The paper reported:   \"'If\n\nFilippo] had behaved better earlier in terms of his relations with his colleagues,'\n\nTilden Edelstein, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, San Filippo might have\n\ntreated differently. . . .    'But San Filippo persisted in being \"Joe the Warrior,\"'\n\nEdelstein said.\" (A.606).    A fact-finder could reasonably infer that the \"war\" to w\n\nDean Edelstein referred encompassed the protected complaints San Filippo had made o\n\nyears.    In addition, Walter Wechsler, the member of the Board of Governors who diss\n\nfrom the decision to dismiss San Filippo, stated that \"the punishment is clearly ou\n\nproportion to his alleged wrongdoing, and quite possibly tainted by a long history\n\nanimus.\"    (A.322).\n\n           San Filippo also has presented evidence that other faculty members had co\n\ninfractions of comparable seriousness yet had not been punished.     For example, Prof\n\nRichard Hartwick of the chemistry department testified before the Senate Panel that\nhad two students pitch hay for him on his farm.    Another professor, George Muha, te\n\nthat, as a student, he had helped his faculty advisor move from one place to anothe\n\nProfessor Muha also testified that he had some of his own students work with him in\n\nphotography lab, and that foreign students he had invited to his house at Thanksgiv\n\n\n0\n With respect to the second part of the Contractors Assoc. test -- why the informat\nnot previously obtained --Rutgers argues that the May 19, 1989 Stipulation preclude\nfurther discovery. This argument is unpersuasive. We agree with the district cour\nconclusion that the Stipulation did not necessarily foreclose additional discovery.\n\n\n\n                                              18\n\fdomestic chores including yard work for him.    Based on this evidence, a fact-finder\n\nreasonably find that San Filippo would not have been dismissed in the absence of hi\n\nprotected activities.   Accordingly, even if the denial of the Rule 56(f) motion wer\n\nerroneous, we would vacate the grant of summary judgment.\n\n          In light of our decision to vacate the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment on San Filippo's first amendment claim, we need to address certain other i\n\nthat are relevant to the course of proceedings on remand.\n\nA.       Protected activity\n\n          As explained above, one who alleges retaliatory discharge from government\n\nemployment must establish that the conduct which triggered the discharge was protec\n\nunder the first amendment.    Where the alleged retaliation is based on expressive co\n\nconstituting speech, a court must first determine whether or not the speech can be\n\ncharacterized as addressing a \"matter of public concern,\" for a governmental employ\n\nmakes public complaints about problems not of \"public concern\" has no first amendme\n\nimmunity against employer discipline.    Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 147 (1983).0\n\nSan Filippo's expressive conduct was not limited to speech.    It included the filing\n\nof lawsuits, and also of grievances under a collective bargaining agreement, agains\n\n\n\n\n0\n A public employer is not precluded altogether from dismissing an employer for spee\naddressing a matter of public concern. Rather, a public employer may dismiss an em\nfor speech addressing a matter of public concern if the state's interest, as an emp\nin promoting the efficiency of its operations outweighs the employee's interest, as\ncitizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern. Connick, 461 U.S. at 142.\nbalancing test comes into play only if the public employer concedes that it dismiss\nemployee because of the employee's protected speech but contends that it was justif\ndoing so. Rutgers denies that it dismissed San Filippo for his protected activitie\naccordingly, the balancing test has no application in the case at bar.\n          The court decides, as a matter of law, whether the speech at issue addres\nmatter of public concern and whether the state's interest in efficiency outweighed\nemployee's interest in commenting on matters of public concern. See Holder v. City\nAllentown, 987 F.2d 188, 195 n.2 (3d Cir. 1993).\n\n\n                                               19\n\fUniversity and University officials -- activities that implicate the petition claus\n\nrather than the free speech clause, of the first amendment.0\n\n          The magistrate judge concluded that San Filippo's activities implicating\n\npetition clause were protected by the first amendment regardless of whether the \"pe\n\nat issue addressed a matter of public concern.      The district court disagreed, and h\n\nthat, to qualify for first amendment protection, San Filippo's \"petition\" activitie\n\nmeet the Connick \"public concern\" threshold.    Although the district court concluded\n\nsome of San Filippo's speech addressed matters of public concern,0 the court conclu\n\nthat his lawsuits and grievances did not meet that threshold.\n\n          On appeal, San Filippo and the Rutgers AAUP recognize that the right to\n\npetition, like freedom of speech, is not absolute.     They argue that San Filippo's l\n\nand grievances were protected first amendment activities, regardless of content, un\n\nthey were baseless.   Rutgers contends that the district court correctly held that S\n\nFilippo's lawsuits and grievances were protected under the petition clause only if\n\naddressed matters of public concern.0\n\n0\nThe first amendment states in relevant part:\n\n          Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of t\n          press, or of the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petiti\n          Government for a redress of grievances.\n\nUnited States Constitution, Amend. 1.\n0\n The district court concluded that the following items of speech addressed matters\npublic concern: (1) San Filippo's 1979 statement in a school newspaper criticizing\nRutgers for inadequate ventilation in the chemistry labs; (2) San Filippo's testimo\n1977 and 1978, before a grand jury, regarding an investigation into the manufacture\nillegal drugs in Rutgers' laboratories; (3) San Filippo's criticisms, in 1983-84, o\nfaculty peers' attempt to secure funding for a mass spectrometer by deceiving feder\nfunding agencies; and (4) San Filippo's disputes between 1979 and 1986 with senior\nof his department over their efforts to obtain \"inappropriate percentages\" of his f\ngrants.\n0\n The district court's conclusion that San Filippo engaged in some protected activit\nnot make this dispute academic. San Filippo wants, (a) the fact-finder to be instr\nthat dismissal in retaliation for any or all of his lawsuits and grievances constit\nfirst amendment violation, and (b) to argue to the fact-finder that the close proxi\n\n\n                                               20\n\f            In Bradley v. Pittsburgh Bd. of Educ., 913 F.2d 1064 (3d Cir. 1990), we\n\nexpressly declined to reach the question whether a public employee is protected und\n\npetition clause against retaliation for having filed a petition addressing solely a\n\nof private concern.    See id. at 1076.   We now will address that question.\n\n            Although the Supreme Court has not discussed the scope of the constitutio\n\nright to petition in the context of an allegedly retaliatory discharge of a public\n\nemployee, the Court has had occasion to consider the scope of that right in other\n\ncontexts.\n\n            In Eastern R.R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U\n\n(1961), the Court addressed the question whether a publicity campaign by railroads\n\nintended to encourage legislation and law enforcement practices disadvantageous to\n\ntrucking industry violated the Sherman Act.    First, the Court took note of the esta\n\nprinciple that, if a restraint of trade is caused by otherwise valid governmental a\n\nthere is no Sherman Act violation.   See id. at 135-36.   Then, the Court went on to\n\nthat the Sherman Act does not prohibit two or more persons from working together in\n\nattempt to persuade the government to take a particular action that would restrain\n\nSee id. at 136.   The Court based its decision upon two grounds.     First, the Court r\n\nthat nothing in the legislative history of the Sherman Act indicated an intent to r\n\npolitical activity by narrowing the channels through which citizens communicate wit\ngoverning officials.   See id. at 137.    The Court then added:\n\n\n            Secondly, and of at least equal significance, such a   construction of the\n            Act would raise important constitutional questions.    The right of petitio\n            one of the freedoms protected by the Bill of Rights,   and we cannot, of co\n            lightly impute to Congress an intent to invade these   freedoms.\n\n\n\n\ntime between his 1985 lawsuits and the decision to file formal charges against him\nsupports an inference of retaliation.\n\n\n                                               21\n\fId. at 138.   Moreover, the Court rejected the contention that there was a Sherman A\n\nviolation because the railroads' purpose was to destroy the truckers as competitors\n\n\n          There may be situations in which a publicity campaign, ostensibly directe\n          toward influencing governmental action, is a mere sham to cover what is a\n          nothing more than an attempt to interfere directly with the business\n          relationships of a competitor and the application of the Sherman Act woul\n          justified. But this is certainly not the case here. No one denied that\n          railroads were making a genuine effort to influence legislation and law\n          enforcement practices.\n\n\nId. at 144.   Accord, United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 670 (1965).0\n\n          In California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508 (19\n\nthe Court developed the \"mere sham\" exception to petition clause protection suggest\n\nthe Noerr dictum.   Competitors of highway carriers regularly brought administrative\n\njudicial proceedings to challenge the carriers' applications for operating rights.\n\nhighway carriers filed a complaint alleging that their competitors conspired to mon\n\ntrade by instituting actions before administrative agencies and courts to defeat th\n\ncarriers' applications to acquire operating rights.     See id. at 509.     The complaint\n\nfurther alleged that the competitors instituted the proceedings to oppose the carri\n\napplications without regard to the merits of the cases, in an effort to prevent the\n\ncarriers from having meaningful access to the agencies and courts.        See id. at 511.\n\nSupreme Court held that the district court improperly dismissed the complaint for f\n\nto state a claim under the antitrust laws.     The Court first reiterated the holding\n\nNoerr that \"no cause of action [is] alleged insofar as it [is] predicated upon mere\n\nattempts to influence the Legislative Branch for the passage of laws or the Executi\n\nBranch for their enforcement.\"   Id. at 510.    The Court further stated:\n\n0\n In Pennington, coal operators and a labor union had approached the Secretary of La\nthe Tennessee Valley Association regarding the minimum wage for contractors selling\nto the TVA. The Court reaffirmed the holding of Noerr that \"[j]oint efforts to inf\npublic officials do not violate the antitrust laws even though intended to eliminat\ncompetition.\" 381 U.S. at 670.\n\n\n                                               22\n\f           The same philosophy governs the approach of citizens   or groups of them to\n           administrative agencies (which are both creatures of   the legislature, and\n           of the executive) and to courts, the third branch of   Government. The rig\n           access to the courts is indeed but one aspect of the   right of petition.\n\n                We conclude that it would be destructive of rights of association an\n           petition to hold that groups with common interests may not, without viola\n           the antitrust laws, use the channels and procedures of state and federal\n           agencies and courts to advocate their causes and points of view respectin\n           resolution of their business and economic interests vis-a-vis their compe\n\n\nId. at 510-11 (citations omitted).   Nonetheless, the Court held that the conduct de\n\nin the carriers' complaint fell within the \"sham\" litigation exception described in\n\nand thus stated a claim under the antitrust laws.\n\n           The unprotected status of \"sham litigation\" was again recognized in Bill\n\nJohnson's Restaurants Inc. v. NLRB, 461 U.S. 731 (1983), in which the Court announc\n\n\"baseless litigation is not immunized by the First Amendment right to petition.\"    I\n\n743.   In Bill Johnson's Restaurants, a waitress who was fired filed an unfair labor\n\npractice charge. She and other waitresses also picketed the restaurant, which in tu\n\nfiled a complaint in state court seeking both damages and an injunction against the\n\npicketing.   The waitress then filed a second charge with the Board, alleging that t\n\nrestaurant had filed the state action in retaliation for her exercise of rights und\n\nNational Labor Relations Act and seeking to have the restaurant's state action enjo\n\nThe Board issued a cease-and-desist order to halt the allegedly retaliatory state c\n\nlawsuit, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.\n\n           The issue before the Supreme Court was whether, under section 8 of the NL\n\nBoard may issue a cease-and-desist order to halt a state court suit solely upon a s\n\nthat the suit was filed for a retaliatory purpose, or whether the suit must also la\n\nmerit.   The Court recognized that the Board's position -- that the suit need only b\n\nfor a retaliatory purpose -- found support in the broad remedial provisions of the\n\nHowever, the Court concluded:\n\n\n                                             23\n\f          There are weighty countervailing considerations . . . that militate again\n          allowing the Board to condemn the filing of a suit as an unfair labor pra\n          and to enjoin its prosecution. In California Motor Transport, we recogni\n          that the right of access to the courts is an aspect of the First Amendmen\n          to petition the Government for redress of grievances. Accordingly, we co\n          the antitrust laws as not prohibiting the filing of a lawsuit, regardless\n          plaintiff's anticompetitive intent or purpose in doing so, unless the sui\n          \"mere sham\" filed for harassment purposes. We should be sensitive to the\n          First Amendment values in construing the NLRA in the present context.\n\n\nId. at 741 (citations omitted).   The Court held that suits lacking a reasonable bas\n\nnot fall within the scope of first amendment protection.   The Court explained:\n\n\n          The first amendment interests involved in private litigation -- compensat\n          violated rights and interests, the psychological benefits of vindication,\n          airing of disputed facts -- are not advanced when the litigation is based\n          intentional falsehoods or on knowingly frivolous claims. Furthermore, si\n          sham litigation by definition does not involve a bona fide grievance, it\n          not come within the first amendment right to petition.\n\n\nId. at 743 (internal quotation omitted).   Accordingly, the Court concluded that it\n\nenjoinable labor practice under ยง8 of the NLRA to file a baseless lawsuit with the\n\nof retaliating against an employee for the exercise of rights protected by the NLRA\n\nid.0\n\n          In both Smith v.

Local 30,\nF.2d 118 (3d Cir. 1991), this court held that the district court properly denied th\nNLRB's request that the court enjoin a pending lawsuit brought by a labor union for\nof contract. We explained that two factors must be present before an injunction ag\ncivil lawsuit may issue: the plaintiff must have an improper motive for bringing th\nand the suit must have no reasonable basis. See Hoeber, 939 F.2d at 126.\n\n\n                                            24\n\fIn Knight, a state statute required public employers to respond to union representa\n\nbut not to individual employees.    In both cases, the Court held that there was no p\n\nclause violation.    The Knight Court, which described the challenged conduct as the\n\nconverse of conduct challenged in Smith, rejected the employees' claim that \"they h\n\nright to force officers of the State acting in an official policy-making capacity t\n\nlisten to them in a particular formal setting.\"    Knight, 465 U.S. at 282.\n\n          Most recently, in McDonald v. Smith, 472 U.S. 479 (1985), the Court addre\n\nthe question whether the petition clause provides absolute immunity to a defendant\n\nwith defaming the plaintiff in a letter about the plaintiff written to the Presiden\n\nthe United States.    Smith, an unsuccessful aspirant for appointment as United State\n\nAttorney, brought a libel suit against McDonald, alleging that McDonald had written\n\nletters to Ronald Reagan -- the first when Mr. Reagan was President-elect, the seco\n\nmonth after his inauguration --accusing Smith of, among other things, fraud, extort\n\nand civil rights violations.    The Court held that the petition clause does not prov\n\nabsolute immunity in that context; rather, a petitioner whose communications are\n\ndefamatory may be answerable in libel if he is shown to have acted with malice, as\n\nin New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964).    In reaching this conclusio\n\nCourt observed:\n\n\n          The right to petition is cut from the same cloth as the other guarantees\n          First] Amendment, and is an assurance of a particular freedom of expressi\n          . .\n\n          To accept petitioner's claim of absolute immunity would elevate the Petit\n          Clause to special First Amendment status. The Petition Clause, however,\n          inspired by the same ideals of liberty and democracy that gave us the fre\n          to speak, publish, and assemble. These First Amendment rights are insepa\n          and there is no sound basis for granting greater constitutional protectio\n          statements made in a petition to the President than other First Amendment\n          expressions.\n\n\nMcDonald, 472 U.S. at 482, 485 (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n                                              25\n\f            As the arguments advanced in the briefs in the case at bar make clear, th\n\nSupreme Court cases we have just canvassed, while long on nuance, do not yield an e\n\nidentified single common denominator.\n\n            San Filippo and the Rutgers AAUP would have us regard San Filippo's petit\n\nactivities protected under the first amendment unless those petitions were \"mere sh\n\n\"baseless litigation.\"    They stress that none of the very narrow limitations the Su\n\nCourt has placed on the right to petition involves an examination of the content of\n\npetition.    They also argue that the petitions at issue in Noerr and Pennington did\n\naddress matters of public concern, and therefore those cases implicitly rejected th\n\nproposition that petitioning is protected under the first amendment only if the pet\n\naddresses a matter of public concern.    The Rutgers AAUP contends that \"there is eve\n\nreason that the lines drawn around the right to petition in public employment be th\n\nas those drawn for selfish petitioners everywhere.\"    That is, the Rutgers AAUP woul\n\nus define the contours of the right to petition without consideration of the contex\n\nwhich that right is exercised.\n\n            In contrast, Rutgers argues -- we think persuasively --that \"[t]he nature\n\nlimitation upon the petition right depends upon context.\"    Rutgers contends that th\n\nSupreme Court cases analyzing the extent of the petition right in the antitrust, la\n\nand libel contexts are not necessarily instructive in the case at bar, which concer\nability of a government employer to dismiss an employee for filing lawsuits and gri\n\nagainst the employer.    This argument that the scope of the petition right depends u\n\ncontext in which the right is exercised is particularly persuasive because the scop\n\nthe free speech right -- a right that, like the petition right, is stated in unqual\n\nterms in the first amendment --depends on the context in which that right is exerci\n\n0\n San Filippo and the Rutgers AAUP rely upon cases from contexts other than public\nemployment/retaliatory discharge in support of the argument that a lawsuit is prote\nregardless of content -- unless it is baseless. Most significantly, San Filippo co\nthat our decision in Hoeber on behalf of the NLRB v. Local 30, 939 F.2d 118 (3d Cir\n\n\n                                              26\n\f          That the scope of the right to petition depends upon context does not, ho\n\nmandate the further conclusion that the \"public concern\" threshold of Connick shoul\n\nthe right to petition in the context of a government employer's ability to discipli\n\npublic employee.   The general question posed by the case at bar is whether --\n\nnotwithstanding the dicta from McDonald quoted above -- there are contexts in which\n\npetition clause protects values additional to those protected by the speech clause.\n\n          McDonald is a case in which the petition clause protects no value that is\n\nprotected by the speech clause. The petition at issue in McDonald was a letter to t\n\nPresident. Smith and Knight instruct that not every communication which the writer\n\ndenominates a \"petition\" imposes on the government agency or official addressed an\n\nobligation to respond.   See Knight, 465 U.S. at 285; Smith, 441 U.S. at 465.    Accor\n\nit is difficult to distinguish in any meaningful way between words contained in a l\n\nto the President and words contained in, for example, an advertisement appearing in\n\nNew York Times.\n\nThis difficulty presumably was the underpinning of the McDonald Court's holding tha\n\nMcDonald's words about a public figure should not be immunized simply because they\n\nappeared in a letter characterized as a \"petition.\"   Moreover, the reasons for hold\n\n\nforecloses Rutgers' position. As explained in note 16, supra, in Hoeber we held,\nfollowing Bill Johnson's Restaurants, Inc. v. NLRB, 461 U.S. 731 (1983), that a cou\nnot enjoin a pending lawsuit as an unfair labor practice unless the plaintiff had a\nimproper motive for bringing the suit and the suit had no reasonable basis. See Ho\n939 F.2d at 126. San Filippo argues that, because the breach of contract lawsuit a\nin Hoeber appeared to address only matters of private concern, the case supports hi\nargument that his lawsuits and grievances addressing only matters of private concer\nprotected under the petition clause. We disagree. Because this case does not aris\nthe public employment/retaliatory discharge context, it is not on point.\n          Many other cases cited by San Filippo and the AAUP are similarly inapposi\nbecause they arise in other contexts. See, e.g., Milhouse v. Carlson, 652 F.2d 371\n(3d Cir. 1981) (disciplinary proceedings allegedly brought against a prisoner in\nretaliation for having filed a civil rights lawsuit); Goff v. Burton, 7 F.3d 734, 7\nCir. 1993) (same); Smith v. Maschner, 899 F.2d 940 (10th Cir. 1990) (same); Wright\nNewsome, 795 F.2d 964 (11th Cir. 1986) (same); Duvall v. Sharp, 905 F.2d 1188 (8th\n1990) (arrest allegedly made in retaliation for filing a civil rights lawsuit).\n\n\n                                             27\n\fthat the first amendment does not immunize maliciously defamatory falsehoods contai\n\na newspaper advertisement equally justify holding that the first amendment does not\n\nimmunize maliciously defamatory falsehoods contained in a letter to the President.\n\nis no value in a petition that seeks to influence the President by means of false\n\nstatements.   As in the context of speech, the additional requirement that malice be\n\nbefore liability may be imposed avoids overdeterrence.\n\n          The same difficulty in drawing a meaningful distinction between the speec\n\nin the petition at issue in Schalk v. Gallemore, 906 F.2d 491 (10th Cir. 1990) (per\n\ncuriam) and other employee speech underlies the holding of that case.    Schalk, a ho\n\nemployee, had hand-delivered to the hospital board members a four-page letter descr\n\nher concerns about various management practices at the hospital.    Schalk was formal\n\nreprimanded for complaining about matters unrelated to her area of responsibility.\n\nreprimand indicated that Schalk would be discharged if she made further complaints\n\nnature.   After Schalk told a board member that she wanted to meet with the board to\n\ndiscuss concerns akin to those described in her letter, she was terminated.    Schalk\n\nfiled a lawsuit alleging that she was fired for writing a letter to, and later spea\n\nwith, board members about management practices, in violation of her first amendment\n\nand petition rights.\n\n          The Tenth Circuit first held that Schalk's letter and her comments to the\nmember addressed a matter of public concern.    Id. at 496.   In a brief analysis of S\n\npetition clause claim, the court stated:   \"In the instant case, Schalk's right to p\n\nis inseparable from her right to speak.    As such, we see no reason to subject this\n\nto a different sort of analysis.\"   Id. at 498 (citing McDonald).   As in McDonald, b\n\nthe \"petition\" at issue was simply a letter imposing on the government no obligatio\n\nrespond, it was properly analyzable under the conventional Connick rubric applicabl\nspeech.\n\n\n\n\n                                               28\n\f           The case at bar is unlike Schalk in the sense that what San Filippo\n\ncharacterizes as \"petitions\" are not letters to the government-employer, but lawsui\n\ngrievances directed at the government-employer or its officials.   Submissions of th\n\npurport to invoke formal mechanisms for the redress of grievances.0   Notwithstandin\n\ndistinction, each circuit court to consider the issue has held that a public employ\n\nalleges that he or she was disciplined in retaliation for having filed a lawsuit ag\n\nhis or her employer does not state a claim under ยง1983 unless the lawsuit addressed\n\nmatter of public concern.0   Recognizing that the question is a difficult one, we fi\n\nourselves unable to subscribe to the reasoning of our sister circuits.\n\n           Of these circuits, the Seventh Circuit has addressed the issue in the mos\n\ndetail.   In Altman v. Hurst, 734 F.2d 1240 (7th Cir. 1984) (per curiam), decided be\n\nMcDonald, the Seventh Circuit held that a police officer who alleged that he was\n\nreassigned, denied overtime opportunities and otherwise harassed in retaliation for\n\na lawsuit against his employer addressing matters of private concern did not state\n\nunder ยง1983.   The court explained:\n\n\n           Several Supreme Court cases indicate that the first amendment protects a\n           person's right to seek judicial redress of grievances. See NAACP v. Butt\n           U.S. 415, 429. A close reading of these cases clearly shows that the Cou\n\n0\n Lawsuits, grievances, workers compensation claims, etc. share this feature of invo\nformal mechanism for redress of grievances against the government. We occasionally\nthe term \"lawsuit\" to encompass any device invoking a mechanism for redress of grie\nagainst the government.\n0\n See White Plains Towing Corp. v.

Madison Metropolitan Sc\nDist., 840 F.2d 412 (7th Cir. 1988):\n\n          The contention that every act of retaliation against a person who files c\n          of wrongdoing with a public agency denies freedom of speech or the right\n          petition for redress of grievances rests on the following syllogism: lit\n          is a method recognized by the Supreme Court, as in NAACP v. Button, 371 U\n          415, 429-31 (1963), for advancing ideas and seeking redress of grievances\n          retaliation against one who institutes litigation (or its condition prece\n          Title VII litigation, the lodging of charges with civil rights agencies)\n          discourages litigation; therefore such retaliation invades a First Amendm\n          right. The weakness is the first premise, which is stated too broadly.\n          litigation seeks to advance political or other ideas; litigation by the N\n          seeking to eliminate public school segregation is an example. And even w\n          litigation has private rather than public objectives, communications desi\n          acquaint individuals with their legal rights are within the scope of the\n          Amendment. But not every legal gesture -- not every legal pleading -- is\n          protected by the First Amendment. Remedies against baseless litigation d\n          violate the First Amendment's right to petition; nor do laws aimed at det\n          'far out' suits by requiring the loser to pay the winner's legal fees.\n\nId. at 419 (citations omitted). Because the court concluded that Yatvin's sex\ndiscrimination claim against her employer had purely private objectives, the court\nrejected Yatvin's claim that her employer's retaliation violated the petition claus\nat 419-20. This conclusion may, however, be regarded as dictum because the court a\nheld that Yatvin's first amendment claim was foreclosed by her failure to raise the\nbelow with sufficient particularity.

Not only is there no legal or historical precedent\n           such a stratification of first amendment freedoms, as McDonald suggests,\n           such special treatment of the right to petition would unjustly favor thos\n           through foresight or mere fortuity present their speech as a grievance ra\n           than in some other form.\n\n\nId. at 1262 (emphasis in original).    Again, affording special treatment to speech f\n\na grievance is \"unjust\" only if no independent reason exists for affording special\n\nprotection to a mechanism for redress of grievances against the government.\n\n            There is an additional argument for testing a public employee's lawsuits\n\nhis or her employer by the Connick public concern threshold not made in the Seventh\n\nCircuit cases: namely, that the governmental interests which led the Court to impos\n\npublic concern threshold on employee speech would appear to justify imposing a simi\n\nthreshold on employee lawsuits and grievances.     Under Connick, employers are able t\n\ndiscipline their employees for speech unless the speech addresses a matter of publi\n\nconcern.    The rationale for this distinction is that it represents an effort to see\nbalance between the interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon m\n\nof public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the\n\nefficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\"    Connick, 461\n\nat 142.    The Supreme Court recently elaborated on the basis for authorizing the gov\n\nas employer to exercise broader power in regulating the speech of its employees tha\n\ngovernment as sovereign may exercise in regulating the speech of the general public\n\n\n                [T]he extra power the government has in this area comes from the nat\n           the government's mission as employer. Government agencies are charged by\n           with doing particular tasks. Agencies hire employees to help do those ta\n           effectively and efficiently as possible. When someone who is paid a sala\n\n\n                                              31\n\f          that she will contribute to an agency's effective operation begins to say\n          things that detract from the agency's effective operation, the government\n          employer must have some power to restrain her. The reason the government\n          in the example given above, fire the [high-ranking] deputy [who criticize\n          state governor's legislative program] is not that this dismissal would so\n          be narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest. It is that the\n          governor and the governor's staff have a job to do, and the governor just\n          feels that a quieter subordinate would allow them to do this job more\n          efficiently.\n\n               The key to First Amendment analysis of government employment decisio\n          then, is this: The government's interest in achieving its goals as effec\n          and efficiently as possible is elevated from a relatively subordinate int\n          when it acts as sovereign to a relatively significant one when it acts as\n          employer. The government cannot restrict speech of the public at large ju\n          the name of efficiency. But where the government is employing someone fo\n          very purpose of effectively achieving its goals, such restrictions may we\n          appropriate.\n\n\nWaters v. Churchill, 62 U.S.L.W. 4397, 4401 (May 31, 1994).\n\n          We recognize that employee lawsuits and grievances against a public emplo\n\ncan, on occasion, be divisive in much the same way that employee speech can be.\n\nNonetheless, we believe that there is an independent reason -- a reason of constitu\n\ndimension -- to protect an employee lawsuit or grievance if it is of the sort that\n\nconstitutes a \"petition\" within the meaning of the first amendment.\n\n          The first amendment's petition clause imposes on the United States an obl\n\nto have at least some channel open for those who seek redress for perceived grievan\n\nThrough its incorporation of the first amendment, the fourteenth amendment's guaran\n\n\"liberty\" imposes the same obligation on the states. Smith and Knight stand only fo\n\nproposition that neither the United States nor the several states are required to\n\nrecognize as a \"petition\" whatever particular communication is so characterized by\n\nchooses to protest governmental acts or omissions.   But when government -- federal\n\nstate -- formally adopts a mechanism for redress of those grievances for which gove\n\nis allegedly accountable, it would seem to undermine the Constitution's vital purpo\nhold that one who in good faith files an arguably meritorious \"petition\" invoking t\n\n\n\n                                            32\n\fmechanism may be disciplined for such invocation by the very government that in com\n\nwith the petition clause has given the particular mechanism its constitutional impr\n\nWe do not share the Seventh Circuit's apprehension that not applying the Connick \"p\n\nconcern\" standard to retaliatory dismissal of a public employee who files a \"petiti\n\nwould constitute \"special treatment of the right to petition [that] would unjustly\n\nthose who through foresight or mere fortuity present their speech as a grievance ra\n\nthan in some other form.\"   Balk, 858 F.2d at 1262.   As applied to communications th\n\nnot petitions, the Connick rule means that a public employee who goes public -- e.g\n\nwriting to The New York Times -- with an employment dispute that is not of \"public\n\nconcern\" runs the risk of being disciplined by her public employer for undertaking\n\npublic attention to a private dispute.   But when one files a \"petition\" one is not\n\nappealing over government's head to the general citizenry:    when one files a \"petit\n\none is addressing government and asking government to fix what, allegedly, governme\n\nbroken or has failed in its duty to repair.0\n\n\n0\n Like the Seventh Circuit in Belk, our dissenting colleague draws comfort from the\nCourt's observation in McDonald that the first amendment right to petition and the\namendment \"freedoms to speak, publish and assemble . . . are inseparable\" and hence\nis no sound basis for granting greater constitutional protection to statements made\npetition to the President than other First Amendment expressions.\" 472 U.S. at 485\nit is important to note that the Court's language in McDonald was addressed to a qu\nvery different from the question presented in Belk and the case at bar. In McDonal\nquestion was whether one who was defamed in a letter was disabled from suing the le\nwriter by virtue of the fact that the letter was written to the President and thus\nbe characterized as a \"petition\" within the meaning of the first amendment. In hol\nthat the letter-writer was amenable to suit at the hands of the person defamed, und\nsame state law standards, compatible with New York Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254\nthat would have applied had the letter been written to a newspaper, the Court was n\ncalled upon the consider the question presented in the case at bar -- namely, wheth\naddressee of a \"petition\" (in McDonald, the President) could sanction the letter-wr\nfor pursuing a constitutionally charted pathway of communication with government.\n   It is also worthy of note that the letter-writer in McDonald apparently did not\nthe audience for his defamatory efforts to President Reagan. The letter-writer all\nalso saw fit to send copies of one or both of the letters to Senator Jesse Helms, t\nmembers of the House of Representatives, and the then Director of the Federal Burea\nInvestigation, William Webster, as well as then Presidential Adviser Edwin Meese.\nU.S. at 481.\n\n\n                                               33\n\f          One example of formal governmental adoption of a mechanism for redress of\n\ngrievances is entry into a collective bargaining agreement that provides for a grie\n\nprocedure. Another example of formal government adoption of such a mechanism is wai\n\nsovereign immunity from suit in the courts of that sovereign.       If government could,\n\nemployer, freely discharge an employee for the reason that the employee, in order t\n\npresent a non-sham claim against the government-employer, invoked such a mechanism,\n\npetition clause of the first amendment would, for public employees seeking to vindi\n\ntheir employee interests, be a trap for the unwary -- and a dead letter.\n\n          The petition clause of the first amendment was not intended to be a dead\n\n-- or a graceful but redundant appendage of the clauses guaranteeing freedom of spe\n\npress.   To be sure, \"the right to petition,\" as the Court noted in McDonald, \"is cu\n\nthe same cloth as the other guarantees of that Amendment. . . .\"      472 U.S. at 482.\n\nthe Court in McDonald also stressed that the right to petition \"is an assurance of\n\nparticular freedom of expression.\"      Ibid.   More to the point, the right to petition\n\npedigree independent of --and substantially more ancient -- than the freedoms of sp\n\nand press.   The Court pointed out in McDonald that \"[T]he historical roots of the P\n\nClause long antedate the Constitution.      In 1689, the Bill of Rights exacted of Will\n\nMary stated: '[I]t is the Right of the Subjects to petition the King.'      1 Wm. & Mar\n                           0\nSess. 2, ch. 2.\"   Ibid.       But of particular moment for the issue before us is that\n\n\n0\n  The remote antecedents of the right of petition trace back to Magna Carta, chapte\nwhich provides:\n\n          . . . if we or our justiciar, or our bailiffs, or any of our servants\n          shall have done wrong in any way toward any one, or shall have\n          transgressed any of the articles of peace or security; and the wrong\n          shall have been shown to four barons of the aforesaid twenty-five\n          barons, let those four barons come to us or to our justiciar, if we\n          are out of the kingdom, laying before us the transgression, and let\n          them ask that we cause that transgression to be corrected without\n          delay.\n\n\n\n                                                 34\n\fParliament, in the Bill of Rights, not only declared the right of subjects \"to peti\n\nthe King,\" but went on to provide that \"all committments [sic] and prosecutions for\n\npetitioning are illegal.\"   1 W. & M., 2d Sess., c. 2, ยง 5, 16 Dec. 1689.   The right\n\npetition and its attendant, and indispensable, immunity from \"committments and\n\nprosecutions\"0 were, in the Court's felicitous phrase, \"exacted of William and Mary\n\nMcDonald, 472 U.S. at 482, in 1689. That was precisely one hundred years before the\n\nBut of course the right lukewarmly acknowledged by King John was exercisable only b\nbarons.\n0\n The critical importance of Parliament's declaration that it was \"illegal\" to penal\nsubject \"for such petitioning\" was made plain by Blackstone in his celebrated\nCommentaries, the series of law books best known to American lawyers of the late\neighteenth and early nineteenth centuries:\n\n             If there should happen any uncommon injury, or infringement of the\n          rights before mentioned, which the ordinary course of law is too\n          defective to reach, there still remains a fourth subordinate right,\n          appertaining to every individual, namely, the right of petitioning the\n          king, or either house of parliament, for the redress of grievances.\n          In Russia we are told that the czar Peter established a law, that no\n          subject might petition the throne till he had first petitioned two\n          different ministers of state. In case he obtained justice from\n          neither, he might then present a third petition to the prince; but\n          upon pain of death, if found to be in the wrong: the consequence of\n          which was, that no one dared to offer such third petition; and\n          grievances seldom falling under the notice of the sovereign, he had\n          little opportunity to redress them. The restrictions, for some there\n          are, which are laid upon petitioning in England, are of a nature\n          extremely different; and, while they promote the spirit of peace, they\n          are no check upon that of liberty. Care only must be taken, lest,\n          under the pretence of petitioning, the subject be guilty of any riot\n          or tumult, as happened in the opening of the memorable parliament in\n          1640: and, to prevent this, it is provided by the statute 13 Car. II.\n          st. I, C. 5, that no petition to the king, or either house of\n          parliament, for any alteration in church or state, shall be signed by\n          above twenty persons, unless the matter thereof be approved by three\n          justices of the peace, or the major part of the grand jury in the\n          country; and in London by the lord mayor, aldermen, and common\n          council: nor shall any petition be presented by more than ten persons\n          at a time. But, under these regulations, it is declared by the\n          statute I W. and M. st. 2, c. 2, that the subject hath a right to\n          petition; and that all commitments and prosecutions for such\n          petitioning are illegal.\n\n1 William Blackstone, Commentaries *143.\n\n\n                                             35\n\fCongress charged with implementing America's new Constitution submitted to the stat\n\nratification, proposed amendments to that Constitution permanently establishing in\n\nAmerican law the right of petition and other fundamental rights.   There is no persu\n\nreason for the right of petition to mean less today than it was intended to mean in\n\nEngland three centuries ago.\n\n           On remand, the district court should consider which, if any, of San Filip\n\ngrievances and lawsuits constituted a \"petition,\" and whether any such \"petition\" w\n\nsham.   The mere act of filing a non-sham petition is not a constitutionally permiss\n\nground for discharge of a public employee.\n\n\n\nB.         Substantial factor\n\n           Our decision to vacate the grant of summary judgment on San Filippo's fir\n\namendment claim also requires us to consider Rutgers' argument that, contrary to th\n\ndistrict court's conclusion, it was entitled to summary judgment because San Filipp\n\ncannot show that his protected conduct \"was a substantial factor in the alleged\n\nretaliatory action.\"   Czurlanis v. Albanese, 721 F.2d 98, 103 (3d Cir. 1983).\n\n           The district court explained that courts have drawn an inference of retal\n\nbased on the nearness in time between the protected activity and a discharge.    Alth\n\nthe district court believed that no fact-finder could reasonably infer that San Fil\nprotected activities in 1977-1979 and 1983-84 were a substantial factor motivating\n\ndismissal, the court concluded that San Filippo was brought up on charges and dismi\n\n\n\n\n                                             36\n\fsufficiently soon after he made protected statements in or around 19860 to raise an\n\ninference of retaliation.0\n\n            At the outset, we disagree with the district court's view that San Filipp\n\nprotected activities in 1977-79 and 1983-84 were too far removed in time to support\n\ninference of retaliation.    Although a dismissal that occurs years after protected a\n\nmight not ordinarily support an inference of retaliation, where, as here, a plainti\n\nengages in subsequent protected activity and the plaintiff is dismissed shortly aft\n\nfinal episode of such protected activity, a fact-finder may reasonably infer that i\n\nthe aggregate of the protected activities that led to retaliatory dismissal.    This\n\ninference would be particularly strong if the plaintiff can show that the decisionm\n\nlacked a pretext on which to dismiss the plaintiff until shortly before the time of\n\ndismissal.\n\n            Rutgers argues that the temporal proximity between San Filippo's protecte\n\nactivities and the disciplinary proceedings against him cannot, by itself, support\n\ninference that the protected activity was a substantial factor in the alleged retal\n\naction.   We need not address this argument, however, because San Filippo has additi\n\nevidence to support his allegation that he was dismissed in retaliation for his pro\n\nactivity.    The evidence described above as support for San Filippo's position that\n\nwould not have been dismissed absent his protected activities -- the statements of\nEdelstein and Board of Governors member Wechsler and the evidence that other facult\n\nmembers committed infractions of comparable seriousness yet went unpunished -- equa\n\nsupport his position that his protected conduct was a substantial factor motivating\n\n0\n The court presumably was referring to San Filippo's disputes with senior members o\ndepartment over their efforts to obtain \"inappropriate percentages\" of his federal\nand particularly his complaint to the University in October, 1985 about the chemist\ndepartment's attempts to divert funds improperly from his federal grants under the\nof a \"shop-user's fee.\" See page 5, supra. San Filippo was orally informed of the\ncharges against him in November, 1985.\n0\n The activities found by the district court to address matters of public concern ar\ndescribed briefly at note 13, supra.\n\n\n                                              37\n\fdismissal.   On the basis of this evidence, we conclude that a fact-finder could rea\n\nfind that San Filippo's protected conduct was a substantial factor motivating his\n\ndismissal.\n\n          Rutgers next argues that San Filippo is inappropriately\n\nseeking to impute to the members of the Board of Governors the improper motives of\n\nresponsible for bringing charges against him.     Rutgers contends that, under Monell\n\nDepartment of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978) and St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485\n\n112, 123 (1988), the University can only be held liable if the Board members person\n\ndetermined to dismiss San Filippo on the basis of his first amendment activities or\n\nknowingly acquiesced in the decision to do so by approving both the decision and th\n\nallegedly improper basis for it.   But this, according to San Filippo, is too narrow\n\nstandard of liability: in San Filippo's view, the University should be held liable\n\nfact-finder concludes that (a) the charges against San Filippo were initiated in\n\nretaliation for the exercise of his first amendment rights and (b) the Board member\n\n\"deliberately indifferent\" to that fact.\n\n          In Monell, the Supreme Court held that, although municipalities and other\n\ngoverning bodies can be sued under 42 U.S.C. ยง1983, liability cannot be imposed on\n\nentity on a theory of vicarious liability for the torts of the entity's employees.\n\nRather, a local governing body can be held liable only for an official policy or cu\nSee Monell, 436 U.S. at 694.   A single decision by a final policy-maker, as defined\n\nstate law, may constitute official policy.   See Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, 475\n\n469, 480-81 (1986).    Rutgers argues that the Board of Governors is the only final p\n\nmaker in this case, and that the Board did not have a retaliatory motive when it vo\n\ndismiss San Filippo.\n\n          San Filippo contends that he need only show that the Board members were\n\n\"deliberately indifferent\" to the fact that he had been brought up on charges in\n\nretaliation for the exercise of his first amendment rights.     He relies on City of C\n\n                                             38\n\fOhio v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378 (1989), in which the Supreme Court held that Canton's\n\nto train police officers to give medical attention could be a basis for imposing ยง1\n\nliability if \"the failure to train amount[ed] to deliberate indifference to the rig\n\npersons with whom the police [came] into contact.\"   Id. at 388.   The Canton Court\n\nexplained that the use of the deliberate indifference standard was most consistent\n\nthe Court's \"admonition in Monell that a municipality can be liable under ยง1983 onl\n\nits policies are the 'moving force [behind] the constitutional violation.'\"   Id. at\n\n(citations omitted).\n\n            The Tenth Circuit extended Canton to a situation analogous to the case at\n\nWare v. Unified School Dist. No. 492, 902 F.2d 815 (10th Cir. 1990).   The plaintiff\n\nWare served as clerk to a school board and secretary to the superintendent of the s\n\ndistrict.   She alleged that her superintendent had recommended to the board that sh\n\ndismissed in retaliation for her protected speech, and that the board had acted wit\n\ndeliberate indifference to her first amendment rights in approving the termination.\n\nWare court rejected the board's argument that Canton be limited to its facts, and h\n\n\n                 There is evidence in the record to support Ware's claim that the Boa\n            acted with deliberate indifference to her First Amendment rights in appro\n            her termination. . . . The record contains evidence that board members k\n            about Ware's public stand on the bond issue and were informed of her beli\n            her termination was in retaliation for that stand. . . . Notwithstanding\n            above indications that the board knew [the superintendent's] recommendati\n            in retaliation for Ware's position on the bond issue, the board made no\n            independent investigation, asked [the superintendent] no questions about\n            reasons for his decision. . . . The evidence is sufficient to create a j\n            question on whether the board acted with deliberate indifference to Ware'\n            Amendment rights in approving [the superintendent's] recommendation.\n\n\nId. at 819-20.\n\n            We agree with the Tenth Circuit that its application of the deliberate\n\nindifference standard of Canton is most consistent with the \"'admonition in Monell\nmunicipality can be liable under ยง1983 only where its policies are the moving force\n\n\n\n                                              39\n\f[behind] the constitutional violation.'\"   Ware, 902 F.2d at 819 (quoting Canton, 48\n\nat 388-89) (citations omitted).   Nor is this use of the deliberate indifference sta\n\ninconsistent with City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 124 (1988) (plural\n\nopinion).   Praprotnik recognized that final decision-making power may be delegated,\n\nthat a local governing body may be held liable based upon the exercise of this dele\n\npower.   See id. at 124.   But the Court added:\n\n\n            Simply going along with discretionary decisions made by one's subordinate\n            however, is not a delegation to them of the authority to make policy. It\n            equally consistent with a presumption that the subordinates are faithfull\n            attempting to comply with the policies that are supposed to guide them.\n            would be a different matter if a particular decision by a subordinate was\n            in the form of a policy statement and expressly approved by the supervisi\n            policymaker. It would also be a different matter if a series of decision\n            subordinate official manifested a \"custom or usage\" of which the supervis\n            have been aware. . . . But the mere failure to investigate the basis of\n            subordinate's discretionary decisions does not amount to a delegation of\n            policymaking authority, especially where (as here) the wrongfulness of th\n            subordinate's decision arises from a retaliatory motive or other unstated\n            rationale.\n\nId. at 130.    In addition to holding that the \"mere failure to investigate the basis\n\nsubordinate's discretionary decisions\" does not make the subordinate a final policy\n\nthe\n\nPraprotnik Court also implicitly held that the local governing body is not liable f\n\nmere failure to investigate by the final policy-maker.\n            Our use of a \"deliberate indifference\" standard does not make the Univers\n\nliable for the Board's mere failure to investigate -- that is, the University would\n\nliable if, oblivious to the motivation behind the decision to charge San Filippo an\n\ninitiate dismissal proceedings, the Board had decided to dismiss San Filippo for wh\n\nlegitimate reasons. Such a scenario would not amount to deliberate indifference of\n\nBoard to San Filippo's first amendment rights.     The scenario described by San Filip\n\nhowever, goes beyond that of an oblivious Board failing to investigate.\n\n\n\n\n                                              40\n\f           San Filippo presented to the district court evidence that the Board had r\n\nto suspect that San Filippo's prior protected activities had been a substantial mot\n\nfactor in the decision to initiate dismissal proceedings.   As the magistrate judge\n\n\"the record is replete with evidence which indicates that the information regarding\n\nFilippo's protected activities was well known to the individual members of the Boar\n\n(A.2152 n.15).   Moreover, Wechsler's dissenting opinion discloses awareness at the\n\nof the Board of San Filippo's contention before the Senate Panel that other faculty\n\nmembers had had students perform uncompensated work for them, yet were not discipli\n\n(A.325).   Finally, the Board's opinion recognizes that San Filippo's attorney, Ira\n\nGoldberg, had argued that \"the charges brought against Professor San Filippo were\n\nfabrications based on a personal 'vendetta' against him by members of his Departmen\n\n(A.304).   As in Ware, this evidence suffices to create a question for the fact-find\n\nregarding whether the ultimate decision-maker acted with deliberate indifference to\n\nplaintiff's first amendment rights by approving the recommendation that the plainti\n\ndismissed.0\n\n\n0\n The Supreme Court's recent decision in Waters v. Churchill, 62 U.S.L.W. 4397 (May\n1994) provides additional support for our use of the Canton \"deliberate indifferenc\nstandard in the case at bar. In Waters, the Court addressed the question whether t\nConnick test should be applied to what the government employer thought the employee\nor to what the fact-finder ultimately determines was said. The Court took an inter\nposition, holding that a court should accept the employer's factual conclusions, bu\nif the employer was reasonable in arriving at those conclusions. Id. at 4401-02.\nelaborating on what would constitute reasonable conduct by an employer, the Court\nexplained:\n\n                If an employment action is based upon what an employee supposedly sa\n           a reasonable supervisor would recognize that there is a substantial likel\n           that what was actually said was protected, the manager must tread with a\n           amount of care. This need not be the care with which trials, with their\n           of evidence and procedure, are conducted. It should, however, be the car\n           a reasonable manager would use before making an employment decision --\n           discharge, suspension, reprimand, or whatever else -- of the sort involve\n           the particular case. Justice Scalia correctly points out that such care\n           normally constitutionally required unless the employee has a protected pr\n           interest in her job, but we believe that the possibility of inadvertently\n\n\n                                             41\n\fIII.      San Filippo's procedural due process claim\n\n          San Filippo also asks us to vacate the district court's grant of summary\njudgment on his procedural due process claim. San Filippo argues that his due proce\n\nrights were violated because the five members of the Senate Panel that conducted th\n\nhearings and recommended that he be dismissed were not impartial decision-makers an\n\nbecause the proceeding was tainted by the appearance of impropriety.    Specifically,\n\nFilippo alleges in his Third Amended Complaint:\n\n\n          [The] members of the panel were negotiating with the Rutgers Administrato\n          chiefly responsible for supervising the prosecution of the case for addit\n          compensation, thus giving them a financial incentive in the outcome of th\n          proceedings, in that they reasonably would believe that they would get\n          additional compensation only if their final decision was favorable to the\n          Administrator. Furthermore, all the contacts for such additional compens\n          were held in secret, thus leading to the appearance of impropriety on the\n          of the Panel.\n\n\nBoth the magistrate judge and the district court rejected San Filippo's argument th\n\nfact-finder could reasonably infer that the panel members believed they were more l\n\nto be compensated if they recommended that San Filippo be dismissed. In addition, t\n\nmagistrate judge and district court rejected San Filippo's argument that the \"secre\n\nnegotiations about compensation created an appearance of impropriety.    We agree wit\nconclusions reached by the magistrate judge and district court.\n\n          The Senate Panel was composed of five faculty members, chosen by lot afte\n\ncause and peremptory challenges, whose responsibility was to hold hearings and dete\n\n\n          punishing someone for exercising her First Amendment rights makes such ca\n          necessary.\n\nId. at 4402. By holding that the University may be held liable if a fact-finder fi\nthat the Board of Governors was deliberately indifferent to the possibility that di\nproceedings were initiated against San Filippo in retaliation for the exercise of h\nfirst amendment rights, we similarly require his employer to \"tread with a certain\nof care\" to avoid \"the possibility of inadvertently punishing someone for exercisin\nFirst Amendment rights.\"\n\n\n                                            42\n\fwhether the charges brought against San Filippo were true and constituted grounds f\n\ndismissal.    The panel had twelve meetings after it convened on December 5, 1986 and\n\nthe evidentiary hearings began.    Between March 24, 1987 and September 22, 1987, the\n\ndevoted forty-six days to evidentiary hearings.    After closing arguments, the panel\n\nanother twelve meetings before it produced a forty-four page report on December 21,\n\nThroughout the hearings, San Filippo was represented by two attorneys, Ira and Pame\n\nGoldberg, and a union counsellor provided by the Rutgers AAUP, Dr. Wells Keddie.\n\n            With the knowledge and consent of San Filippo's attorneys, Dr. Keddie, on\n\n5, 1987, sent a memorandum to the panel chair, Dr. Szatrowski, copied to San Filipp\n\nhis attorneys.    The memorandum suggested various ways to deal with time and schedul\n\nproblems:\n\n\n            I don't have a single original or good idea as to how to resolve the time\n            but there are some things which might mitigate the impact upon the commit\n            members. One of them is the course you are already pursuing, the seeking\n            some relief from normal duties while this demanding activity proceeds. I\n            to me that if the proceedings cannot be concluded by the May 15 date, it\n            be entirely appropriate to request the equivalent of Summer Session pay f\n            of you or released time for those of you (yourself) on \"summer vacation\"\n            upcoming trimester. But another possibility might well be worth consider\n            released time after this is all over to enable committee members to make\n            considerable lost time, energy, and opportunity.\n\n\nDr. Keddie also suggested that panel members \"be provided meals and accommodations.\n\n            When it became clear that the hearings would not conclude before commence\n\nSzatrowski asked San Filippo's attorney, Ira Goldberg, if he had any objection to\n\nSzatrowski asking Dr. Susan Cole, Vice President for University Administration and\n\nPersonnel, for summer compensation for the panel members.    Szatrowski and Goldberg\n\ntestified in their affidavits that Goldberg voiced no objection and wished Szatrows\n\n\"good luck.\"\n\n            When Szatrowski first requested additional compensation and/or released t\n\nthe spring of 1987, Cole denied the request because she believed that the panel mem\n\n\n                                              43\n\fwere already under an obligation to participate without extra compensation. In late\n\nspring, Szatrowski renewed the request in light of the length of the hearings and t\n\nthat certain panel members were ordinarily not required to be in attendance at Rutg\n\nover the summer.   By letters dated July 29, 1987, Cole granted the members their re\n\nextra compensation and release time.   San Filippo was not told of this decision.\n\n          Shortly after the summer increases were granted, Szatrowski asked Cole fo\n\nfurther additional compensation when it became clear that the hearings would contin\n\nthe fall. Cole testified that when Szatrowski approached her about the matter of fu\n\npayments, she \"told him when the panel was finished with its business, that we coul\n\ndiscuss the matter again.\"   Szatrowski similarly testified:\n\n\n          When I asked if this [the refusal to grant more compensation] meant that\n          regardless of the amount of additional time spent on this matter by the\n          panelists while carrying out their normal duties, there would be no furth\n          consideration for additional compensation in the future, Dr. Cole indicat\n          there would be no consideration possible until after the completion of th\n          hearings.\n\n\nUltimately, after the panel issued its final report recommending that San Filippo b\n\ndismissed, Cole recommended that the panel members receive extra compensation.\n\n          Based upon this factual scenario, San Filippo alleges that the panel memb\n\nwould have been tempted to reach an outcome in Rutgers' favor because they would ha\n\nbelieved that they were more likely to get extra compensation if they did so. We ag\n\nwith the magistrate judge and district court that there is insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport an inference that the faculty members believed that their receipt of compen\n\nwas tied to the outcome of the proceedings.   The cases cited by San Filippo are cas\n\nwhich the adjudicator had a direct financial interest in the outcome.   See, e.g., T\n\nOhio, 273 U.S. 510, 531 (1927) (mayor acting as judge shared in the fees and costs\n\nby him); Ward v. Village of Monroeville, 409 U.S. 57, 60 (1972) (mayor responsible\nvillage finances could not act as judge when fines and forfeitures provided substan\n\n\n                                              44\n\fportion of village funds).   The Supreme Court has held that the impermissible pecun\n\ninterest must be realistic and more than \"remote.\"   Marshall v. Jerrico, Inc., 446\n\n238, 250 (1980). We find no evidence in the record to support a conclusion that the\n\nmembers believed that they were more likely to be compensated if they recommended S\n\nFilippo's dismissal.\n\n          San Filippo alternatively argues that the panel members' participation in\n\nhearings while negotiating for additional compensation created an appearance of\n\nimpropriety. See Commonwealth Coatings Corp. v. Continental Casualty Co., 393 U.S.\n\n150 (1968) (arbitration panel \"not only must be unbiased but must also avoid the\n\nappearance of bias\").   Under Commonwealth Coatings, to prevail on an \"appearance of\n\nimpropriety\" due process claim, San Filippo must establish both that the events in\n\nquestion would cause one to reasonably question the panel's impartiality and that t\n\ninformation was concealed from San Filippo.   San Filippo makes much of the fact tha\n\nwas not told about the meetings between Szatrowski and Cole; however, in light of t\n\nthat Keddie suggested that Szatrowski broach the subject of extra compensation, the\n\nmeetings do not have the invidious character San Filippo suggests.\n\n          Finally, San Filippo argues that he should have had the opportunity to de\n\nSzatrowski to determine what was said in the conversations between Szatrowski and C\n\nSan Filippo contends that, although he noticed Szatrowski's deposition in August 19\ndiscovery was stayed after November 1989 when the motions for summary judgment were\n\nAs the district court noted, San Filippo has failed to explain why Szatrowski was n\n\ndeposed before August 1989 -- particularly, why he was not deposed during the summe\n\nfall of 1989 when San Filippo deposed nine other current and former officials and\n\nemployees of Rutgers.   Moreover, San Filippo does not indicate how he expects the\n\ndeposition testimony of Szatrowski to differ from the testimony found in Szatrowski\naffidavit, dated April 2, 1990. For these reasons, we conclude that the district co\n\n\n\n\n                                              45\n\fnot abuse its discretion by refusing to delay decision on the summary judgment moti\n\nuntil San Filippo had a chance to depose Szatrowski.\n\n\nIV.       Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm in part and vacate in part the order\n\ndistrict court.   We affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment in Rutger\n\nfavor on San Filippo's due process claim.   We vacate the district court's grant of\n\njudgment in Rutgers' favor on San Filippo's first amendment claim, and remand for\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                             46\n\fJoseph San Filippo, Jr. v.

I would adopt\n\nposition of the seven other circuits which hold that a public employee plaintiff wh\n\n\"petitioned\" is in no better position than one who has merely exercised free speech\n\nMajority Typescript at 37 n.19 (listing circuits).\n\n           I need not offer extended justification for my position, for the majority\n\nalready done so when describing these other circuits' views at pages 24 to 41 of it\n\nopinion. Although the majority then arrives at a conclusion in contradistinction to\n\npreceding analysis, the majority's rationale supporting its conclusion pales by com\n\nwith the reasoning of the other circuits and with the inexorable logic of McDonald\n\nSmith.   472 U.S. 479 (1985).   In a nutshell, I simply do not believe that the fact\nthe government adopts a formal redress mechanism gives one who pursues it more prot\n\nthan if the person had written a letter to the editor or made a speech.    As the Sup\n\nCourt explained in McDonald:\n          The Petition Clause . . . was inspired by the same ideals of liberty\n          and democracy that gave us the freedoms to speak, publish, and\n          assemble. These First Amendment rights are inseparable, and there is\n          no sound basis for granting greater constitutional protection to\n          statements made in a petition to the President than other First\n          Amendment expressions.\n\n\n472 U.S. at 484-85.   The same holds true when the petition is addressed to the cour\n\nto university officials.\n\n\n                                              47\n\f            In my view, the Supreme Court would be surprised to learn that, althoug\n\nresult of \"the nature of the government's mission as employer,\" a public employer (\n\nRutgers) can fire someone who \"begins to say or do things that detract from the age\n\neffective operation\" so long as the speech is on a matter of private concern, Water\n\nChurchill, 62 U.S.L.W. 4397, 4401 (May 31, 1994) (quoted in Majority Typescript at\n\nthe government cannot fire the same individual if he or she speaks after invoking a\n\nmechanism for the redress of grievances (or speaks through that forum).   Such an\n\ninterpretation of the Petition Clause, rather than making that clause a \"trap for t\n\nunwary\" as the majority contends would be the consequence of my interpretation of t\n\nClause, Majority Typescript at 44, is an invitation to the wary to formulate their\n\non matters of private concern as a lawsuit or grievance in order to avoid being\n\ndisciplined.   This would undermine the government's special role as an employer.\n\n          The majority argues that in contrast to speech on a matter of private con\n\n\"when one files a `petition' one is not appealing over government's head to the gen\n\ncitizenry: when one files a `petition' one is addressing government and asking gove\n\nto repair what government has broken, or, at least, has failed to repair.\"   Majorit\n\nTypescript at 43.   But the libelous letter to the President at issue in McDonald, 4\n\nat 484-85, took the form of an address to government rather than the general citize\n\nand yet the Court held that the letter received no greater constitutional protectio\nresult. And the fact that San Filippo's speech addressed government did not make it\n\nless disruptive of the workplace environment than if it had addressed the general p\n\nindeed, the speech may have been more disruptive because it still reached the publi\n\n(lawsuits, for example, are matters of public record) and, in addition, compelled t\n\nuniversity to respond to the lawsuits and grievances.\n\n          The majority argues that it would undermine the Constitution's purposes t\ngovernment to punish someone for invoking a mechanism to which government has given\n\nconstitutional imprimatur.\"   Majority Typescript at 42.   However, the constitutiona\n\n\n                                             48\n\fimprimatur of the Petition Clause applies equally to the letter to the President at\n\nin McDonald as to the lawsuits and grievances at issue here.   By waiving sovereign\n\nimmunity to suit or adopting grievance procedures, the government may give special\n\nstatutory/regulatory imprimatur to these mechanisms as opposed to other forms of pe\n\nsuch as letters, but it does not give them a special constitutional imprimatur.   Mo\n\nthe government has given its regulatory imprimatur to the letter at issue in McDona\n\nsetting up an office in the White House that is designed to respond to corresponden\n\nFinally, for lawsuits at least, the state's waiver of sovereign immunity is not spe\n\nto suits by public employees and thus may not be at all meant as a recognition of a\n\nemployee's right to file repeated lawsuits against his or her employer.\n\n          Nor, by adopting such petition mechanisms, does the government somehow in\n\nthe employee's interest in having free license to protest his or her employer's dec\n\nFor example, San Filippo would have had the same interest in protesting the failure\n\nchemistry department to recommend him for a full professorship if the university ha\n\nadopted a grievance procedure.   Connick declares that this interest is outweighed b\n\nuniversity's interest in regulating its work environment.\n\n          Finally, the majority's suggestion that a contrary interpretation would r\n\nthe Petition Clause a \"dead letter\" is hyperbolic.   Inter alia, the clause would st\n\nhave use when there is a \"petition,\" in lieu of more conventional speech. Moreover,\nif all petitions now constitute speech (given the broad interpretation the Supreme\n\nhas given to speech), I do not see why it matters that the guarantees overlap.

The district\n\ngranted Rutgers' motion for summary judgment and dismissed Professor San Filippo's\n\n          On appeal, San Filippo, with support from the Rutgers Council of American\n\nAssociation of University Professors Chapters (\"Rutgers AAUP\") as amicus, challenge\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment in Rutgers' favor:   (1) on San Filippo's\n\nthat he was dismissed in retaliation for the exercise of his first amendment rights\n\n(2) on San Filippo's claim that Rutgers violated his right to procedural due proces\n\nbecause the panel that recommended his dismissal had, according to San Filippo, a\n\nfinancial incentive to recommend dismissal.\n\n          Part I of this opinion outlines the factual background and procedural his\n\nthis case.   Part II analyzes the legal issues posed by San Filippo's first amendmen\n\nclaim.   Part III addresses San Filippo's due process claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fI.        Factual background and procedural history\n\n          Because San Filippo appeals from the district court's grant of Rutgers' m\n\nfor summary judgment, the following factual recital accepts as true all evidence pr\n\nby non-movant San Filippo, with all reasonable inferences drawn in his favor.\n\n          On November 25, 1985, Dean Tilden Edelstein told San Filippo and his Rutg\n\nAAUP counsellor, Wells Keddie,0 of allegations that San Filippo had harassed, explo\n\nand attempted to exploit visiting scholars from the People's Republic of China.      On\n\nJanuary 6, 1986, Dean Edelstein sent San Filippo a letter stating the complaints ag\n\nhim.   As required by one of the University's dismissal regulations, advice about wh\n\ndismissal proceedings should be commenced was sought from two groups of San Filippo\n\nfaculty peers and three academic officers of the University.   On February 14, 1986,\n\ntenured faculty members of the chemistry department passed a resolution concluding\n\nthe charges against San Filippo, if proven, represented grounds for dismissal.    Aft\n\nAppointments and Promotion Committee, the University Provost, and the Chief Academi\n\nOfficer concurred in the sentiment expressed in that resolution, Rutgers University\n\nPresident Edward Bloustein wrote a letter to San Filippo, dated October 1, 1986, in\n\nhe described the formal charges against San Filippo.   President Bloustein further\n\nindicated that, if San Filippo did not make a timely request for a hearing, Preside\n\nBloustein would recommend to the University's Board of Governors that San Filippo b\ndismissed based on the charges outlined in the letter.\n\n          San Filippo exercised his right to a hearing before a panel of five facul\n\npeers (the \"Senate Panel\") which, after a forty-six day hearing, concluded that San\n\nFilippo had committed almost all of the offenses charged.   In a forty-four page rep\n\nissued on December 21, 1987, the Senate Panel recommended that San Filippo be strip\n\n0\n The Rutgers AAUP is the recognized agent for collective bargaining under state law\nRutgers University faculty members, including Professor San Filippo.

The Board of Governors unanimously\n\nconcluded in its sixty-page opinion that the Senate Panel's findings were supported\n\nevidence.    On May 13, 1988, the Board of Governors voted to dismiss San Filippo on\n\nbasis of nine charges of misconduct.    One member of the seven-member Board --Walter\n\nWechsler -- voted against dismissal because he believed that the sanction was too s\n\nWechsler has not been named as a defendant.\n\n            San Filippo filed the instant action on June 13, 1988. He alleges, among\n\nthings, that disciplinary proceedings were initiated against him and that he was di\n\nin retaliation for the numerous (1) grievances and lawsuits he had instituted, and\n\ncomplaints he had voiced, against Rutgers University and various University officia\n\nbetween 1977 and 1986 -- activities that he contends are protected by the first ame\n\n\n\nA.          San Filippo's alleged protected activities\n\n            In 1977, San Filippo wrote a letter to the then chemistry department chai\n\nProfessor Sidney Toby, complaining about dangerous conditions in the chemistry\n\nlaboratories, conditions that had been described by the New Jersey Department of He\n\n\"generally unsatisfactory.\"    In 1979, in response to a newspaper reporter's questio\n\nconcerning a student's collapse due to noxious fumes during a chemistry experiment,\n\nFilippo stated -- as reported by the newspaper on January 30, 1979 --that undergrad\nstudents were being subjected to a \"health hazard and an absolute danger\" and that\n\n\"minimum safety requirements are not being met.\"    San Filippo was berated by the th\n\ndepartment chairman, Professor Joseph Potenza, and by an administrator for making t\n\ncomments.    San Filippo's comments led to the creation of an American Association of\n\nUniversity Professors - University Safety Committee.\n\n            In 1977 and 1978, San Filippo testified before a grand jury regarding an\ninvestigation into the manufacture of illegal drugs in the chemistry laboratories.\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\fPotenza criticized San Filippo for his \"disloyalty\" and for \"washing the department\n\ndirty linen in public.\"\n\n          In 1983-84, San Filippo became embroiled in a dispute over what he descri\n\nan effort by members of the chemistry department's instruments committee to obtain\n\nfunding for a mass spectrometer by misrepresenting the department's need for such a\n\ninstrument.   San Filippo threatened to tell the federal funding agency the truth ab\n\ndepartment's needs.   The committee members wrote a memorandum to Potenza, as depart\n\nchairman, protesting San Filippo's threats to undermine their efforts to obtain a m\n\nspectrometer.   Potenza told San Filippo that he intended to place the memorandum in\n\nFilippo's personnel file.   San Filippo contacted the United States Attorney's offic\n\nregarding this action against him, and an Assistant United States Attorney told San\n\nFilippo that such an action would be characterized as an effort to obstruct justice\n\nSan Filippo told Potenza what the government lawyer had said, Potenza had the lette\n\nreprimand removed from San Filippo's personnel file.\n\n          Between 1979 and 1986, San Filippo complained about certain financial\n\nirregularities in the chemistry department, particularly efforts to divert funds fr\n\nFilippo's federal grants.   In October 1985, San Filippo objected to a proposal by t\n\ndepartment chairman, Professor Robert Boikess, to impose a \"shop user's fee,\" which\n\nFilippo characterized as illegal double billing of chemistry department members.\n\n          In 1981, the chemistry department declined to recommend San Filippo for\npromotion to full professorship.    San Filippo filed a grievance in 1982, contending\n\nhe had been denied promotion through manipulation of his promotion packet.   While t\n\ngrievance was pending, the chemistry department recommended that San Filippo be pro\n\nto full professor, effective July 1984.   Although the grievance committee ultimatel\n\nagreed with San Filippo that he should have been promoted, the University took the\nposition that the issue was moot.   In September 1985, San Filippo filed a lawsuit i\n\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\fcourt in which he contended that he was entitled to have his promotion effective Ju\n\n1982. That suit is still pending.\n\n            In 1984, San Filippo grieved the fact that he had been denied a merit sal\n\nincrease.    The University rejected San Filippo's grievance, and he filed for non-bi\n\narbitration. The first hearings in the arbitration occurred in October 1985. On Sep\n\n10, 1986, Boikess testified for the University. Regarding this event, the arbitrato\n\ncommented in his decision dated December 26, 1986:\n               Little things are often very revealing. A transcript does not conve\n          full flavor of what transpires in the hearing room. Boikess was called o\n          last day of the hearing. He brought his own lawyer with him (Mr. Peirano\n\n                 San Filippo cordially greeted him before he took the stand. Boikess\n            not acknowledge the greeting and refused to acknowledge grievant's presen\n            the room.\n\n                 During his testimony, Boikess kept referring to grievant's \"self-\n            nomination\" [for the merit salary award]. His tone of voice was so caust\n            it sparked an inquiry from me. (The inference to be drawn by the tone of\n            employed was that a \"self-nomination\" was somehow less worthy).\n\n                 I specifically asked Boikess why he emphasized \"self-nomination.\" B\n            danced around the issue and did not really answer my question. It became\n            obvious that he would not answer, so I gave up. Further, the tenor and t\n            his testimony revealed his near-total contempt for San Filippo.\n\n                 I note in passing that most of the persons being considered were sel\n            nominated. The [merit salary award procedure] specifically provides for\n\n                 One would have to be a block of wood to fail to notice Dr. Boikess'\n            complete distaste for Joe San Filippo.\n\n\n(A.1155 n.21).    The arbitrator sustained San Filippo's complaint. He further noted\n\nopinion:\n\n\n            San Filippo testified, without contradiction, that he was criticized by\n            administration officials for talking to the school newspaper about unsafe\n            conditions in the laboratories. [San Filippo] was chairman of the Safety\n            Committee at the time. A student took ill. [San Filippo] was accused of\n            \"disloyal.\" Putting aside the serious first amendment issues the episode\n            (Pickering v.

[Dr. San Filippo] had to bring successful gr\n          action to rectify the situation. It would appear that someone was willing\n          to extra-ordinary lengths to deny [Dr. San Filippo] professional advantag\n          That kind of conduct is similar to what happened to [Dr. San Filippo] in\n          [merit salary award] review.\n\n          [Dr. San Filippo's] nomination was clearly judged under separate \"San Fil\n          rules\" that were applicable to no one else.\n\n          . . . .   I know a pipe job when I see one.\n\n\n(A.1161 n.29).\n\n          In November 1985, Dr. San Filippo brought a libel action in state court a\n\nthree administrators who accused San Filippo of deliberately falsifying time report\n\nrelating to one of his technical assistants.\n\n          Finally, San Filippo brought a lawsuit in state court against the Univers\n\nMarch 1986 complaining about, among other things, the University's decision to proh\n\nwithout a hearing of any kind -- graduate student assistance in San Filippo's resea\nprogram, because of the accusations against San Filippo.\n\n\n\nB.

More specifically, your treatmen\n          respect to these individuals, as set forth more fully in the attached doc\n          is as follows:\n\n          a. You took advantage of your professorial position and exploited Mr. He\n          Gao and Mr. Changhe Xiao, both visiting scholars from the People's Republ\n          China, by directing them or leading them to believe that they had no choi\n          to perform domestic work for you, such as garden work and indoor and outd\n          cleaning work during the period May through July 1985.0\n\n          c. You exploited Messrs. Gao and Xiao by representing that they would be\n          provided health benefits coverage and that you would deduct $700.00 from\n          salary to be paid each of them in order to cover the costs of such benefi\n          Despite deducting such sums, you did not provide coverage to either Mr. G\n          Mr. Xiao.\n\n          d. During the period of time that the above-named visiting Chinese schol\n          were at Rutgers, you threatened and harassed those individuals by repeate\n          stating that you would send them back to China and by directing abusive l\n          toward them.\n\n          e. On or about March 31, 1986, you interrupted without sufficient cause\n          laboratory class being conducted by Teaching Assistant, Zong Ping Chen.\n          continued that incident by treating her in an unprofessional, threatening\n          abusive manner, within the hearing of other individuals, including her st\n\n          Charge 2: On or about July 8, 1985, you directed Mr. Changhe Xiao, who h\n          injured himself while doing maintenance work at your house, to identify h\n          as Mr. Peng Zhou in Middlesex Hospital in order to have Mr. Xiao covered\n          Peng Zhou's medical insurance.\n\n          Charge 3: You encouraged and permitted individuals working under your di\n          and supervision to submit false time reports and to make inappropriate ch\n          against certain University accounts. Specifically:0\n\n          b. Ms. Marilyn Brownawell, who works directly under your supervision, su\n          time reports for the week ending August 17, 1984. She reported and was p\n          40 hours of work for that period, charged against the Chemistry Departmen\n          mass spectrometer account, even though you knew that she did not perform\n          work related to the mass spectrometer or indeed any compensable work for\n          of any kind during that period.0\n\n0\n The Senate Panel found that charge 1(b) was unproven, and the Board concurred in t\ndetermination.\n0\n The Senate Panel did not sustain charge 3(a), and the Board concurred in this\ndetermination.\n0\n Charge 3(c) was not sustained by the Panel, and the Board concurred in this\ndetermination.\n\n\n                                            9\n\f          Charge 4: You violated professional and academic standards and exploited\n          foreign visitors to the University by bringing to the University as post-\n          doctoral fellows Chinese scholars you knew did not have appropriate crede\n          and by charging stipends of such individuals, who did not possess doctora\n          degrees, to your NSF grant as post-doctoral fellows. Subsequently you sup\n          these individuals for admission to the graduate program in Chemistry, a f\n          which clearly established that they did not have the credentials to be po\n          doctoral fellows.0\n\n          Charge 5: During Fall 1985, you submitted an application for admission t\n          graduate program, including letters of reference, on behalf of Mr. Peng Z\n          one of the individuals referred to in #4 above. One of the letters of ref\n          submitted by you purportedly was written and signed by Liu Guozhi. In fa\n          that letter was not prepared by Liu Guozhi, and you had knowledge of the\n          and did not make it known when you submitted the letter.\n\n          Charge 6: On December 16, 1985, Professor Robert Boikess, Chair of your\n          department, specifically instructed you not to permit Mr. Peng Zhou, Mr.\n          Yuan Guo, or any other graduate student except those already associated w\n          your research group, to work in your laboratory, pending investigation of\n          allegations of exploitation and harassment lodged against you by visiting\n          Chinese scholars. Despite these specific instructions, you subsequently\n          permitted Cong-Yuan Guo, Zhen-min He, and Peng Zhou to perform work in yo\n          laboratory.\n\n\nIn the Board's opinion, the Board specifically found that the conduct described in\n\nsustained charges 1(a), 1(d) and 1(e) was a serious enough breach of the role of fa\n\nmember that, even if those were the only sustained charges, there would be sufficie\n\ncause for dismissal.   Accordingly, on May 13, 1988, the Board directed that San Fil\n\ndismissed from the University.\n\n          Board member Wechsler agreed with his colleagues' findings but felt that\ndismissal was too severe a sanction: \"Because this punishment is clearly out of pro\n\nto his alleged wrongdoing, and quite possibly tainted by a long history of animus,\n\nrespectfully dissent.\"   (A.322).\n\n\n\nC.

San Filippo sued under ยง1983 an\n\nlaw, alleging that the dismissal violated his speech, petition, equal protection, a\n\nprocess rights under the United States and New Jersey Constitutions, and violated h\n\ncommon law contract rights.\n\n          Following the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment on a number of\n\nthe district court granted San Filippo's motion for partial summary judgment on his\n\nthat the regulations pursuant to which he was dismissed were void for vagueness.

Accordingly, in an opinion da\n\nSeptember 28, 1993, the district court accepted those recommendations and granted R\n\nsummary judgment on those claims.   San Filippo objected to the magistrate judge's\n\nrecommendation that Rutgers be granted summary judgment on his due process claim, a\n\nargued that he was entitled to summary judgment on that claim or at least to furthe\n\ndiscovery.   Rutgers objected to the magistrate judge's recommendation that summary\n\njudgment on San Filippo's first amendment claim be denied.\n\n          The district court adopted the magistrate judge's recommendation that sum\n\njudgment be granted on San Filippo's due process claim, but rejected the magistrate\n\njudge's recommendation that summary judgment be denied on San Filippo's first amend\n\nclaim.   With respect to the first amendment claim, the district court first disagre\n\nthe magistrate judge's conclusion that San Filippo's lawsuits and grievances were\n\nactivities protected under the first amendment petition clause regardless of whethe\n\naddressed a matter of public concern.   Instead, the district court held that lawsui\n\ngrievances, like speech generally, are protected activities under the first amendme\n\nif they address matters of public concern.\n\n          The district court concluded that some of San Filippo's speech addressed\n\nof public concern and was therefore protected under the first amendment.   The distr\ncourt also concluded that a fact-finder could reasonably infer that San Filippo's\n\nprotected conduct was a substantial factor motivating his dismissal.   However, the\n\ndistrict court held that there was no basis in the record from which a fact-finder\n\nreasonably conclude that San Filippo was dismissed because of his protected conduct\n\nrather than because of the misconduct described in the charges brought against him.\n\nMoreover, the district court rejected the magistrate judge's recommendation that a\non the summary judgment motion be delayed until after San Filippo had had an opport\n\nto conduct additional discovery, and instead held that San Filippo had received all\n\n\n                                             13\n\fdiscovery to which he was entitled.

San Filippo also\n\ncontends that the district court's order granting Rutgers summary judgment on his d\n\nprocess claim should be vacated because there remains a material issue of fact rega\n\nthe question whether the Senate Panel had a pecuniary interest in the outcome of th\n\nproceedings against San Filippo, and because he was entitled to additional discover\n\n\nII.         San Filippo's first amendment claim\n\n            San Filippo first contends that the district court erred in denying his r\n\nmade pursuant to Rule 56(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,0 that the dist\n\ncourt delay its ruling on Rutgers' summary judgment motion until after he had time\n\nconduct further discovery.    San Filippo made various discovery requests on Septembe\n\n1989; Rutgers asked to have until November 7 to respond.    On November 24, San Filip\n\nwrote a 20-page letter to Rutgers pointing out inadequacies in Rutgers' response.\nNovember 29, Rutgers moved for summary judgment and the requested information was n\n\nsupplied.    San Filippo submitted a Rule 56(f) affidavit in support of its oppositio\n\nRutgers' motion for summary judgment.    The magistrate judge recommended that the ru\n\nthe summary judgment motion be deferred until after San Filippo had an opportunity\n\nadditional discovery.\n\n\n\n\n0\nThe text of this rule is quoted at note 8, supra.\n\n                                              14\n\f          The district court rejected the magistrate judge's conclusion that summar\n\njudgment should not be granted until San Filippo had an opportunity to discover add\n\ninformation. The court explained that San Filippo argued that \"he must see the reco\n\nother faculty persons similarly situated (i.e., persons who have been known to comm\n\nwere accused of committing, similar offenses, but against whom no sanctions, or not\n\nsevere a sanction was imposed).\"     Opinion at 42 (internal quotation omitted).   The\n\nrejected San Filippo's argument for two reasons.     First, the court concluded that \"\n\nmembers 'similarly situated' to plaintiff are those faculty members against whom fo\n\ncharges have been filed as to conduct which could lead to dismissal under the Unive\n\nregulations.\"   Opinion at 42-43.    The court explained that San Filippo received all\n\ninformation on June 9, 1989, pursuant to Rutgers' compliance with section I.1 of a\n\nStipulation dated May 19, 1989.     Second, the court concluded:\n\n\n          These [nine] charges together caused plaintiff's dismissal and it is only\n          tenured faculty member who had \"been known to commit\" or was \"accused of\n          committing\" offenses of the kind, number, and scope taken together with w\n          plaintiff is truly \"similarly situated.\" No one suggests that such a per\n          exists.\n\n\nOpinion at 44-45 (emphasis in original).

Rutgers State University,\n\nF.2d 154 (3d Cir. 1991), rejected a contention that the district court had erred in\n\ncomparing the defendant University's decision not to tenure the plaintiff professor\n\nthe University's decision to tenure another professor who had higher ratings than t\n\nplaintiff in two categories -- teaching effectiveness and general usefulness.   See\n\n178.   We reasoned that to preclude such a comparison \"would change 'similarly situa\n\n'identically situated.'\" Id.    Although \"[t]he propriety of such a comparison is cas\n\nspecific,\" there is a \"broad sweep of relevancy.\"   Id. Admittedly, the district cou\n\nand should impose limits on discovery that is calculated to lead to the unearthing\n\nmarginally relevant evidence.   Nonetheless, the limits imposed here were too severe\n\n          The Board indicated in its opinion that it viewed charges 1(a), 1(d) and\n\nthe most serious charges against San Filippo, meriting his dismissal even if the ot\n\ncharges were not sustained.    San Filippo accordingly should be permitted to discove\n\nwhether the University knew of other employees who committed one or more offenses o\n\ncomparable or greater seriousness yet did not discipline these employees, or impose\nsanctions far less severe than dismissal.   Although the district court's suggestion\n\nSan Filippo was disciplined because of a combination of misdeeds rather than for an\n\nsingle misdeed is plausible, this type of evaluation is one that should generally b\n\nto the fact-finder.   Because the information San Filippo sought in discovery was of\n\nsort that might prevent the entry of summary judgment and was under the control of\n\nRutgers, we conclude that it was an abuse of discretion to deny San Filippo's Rule\n\n\n\n\n                                              17\n\fmotion.    Accordingly, we will vacate the district court's grant of summary judgment\n\nFilippo's first amendment claim and remand for further discovery.0\n\n           Even without further discovery, there is sufficient evidence in the recor\n\nwhich a fact-finder could conclude that, in the absence of his protected activities\n\nFilippo would not have been dismissed based on the conduct described in the charges\n\nagainst him.    First, Dean Edelstein was interviewed by the local New Brunswick news\n\nThe Home News, shortly after San Filippo was dismissed.    The paper reported:   \"'If\n\nFilippo] had behaved better earlier in terms of his relations with his colleagues,'\n\nTilden Edelstein, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, San Filippo might have\n\ntreated differently. . . .    'But San Filippo persisted in being \"Joe the Warrior,\"'\n\nEdelstein said.\" (A.606).    A fact-finder could reasonably infer that the \"war\" to w\n\nDean Edelstein referred encompassed the protected complaints San Filippo had made o\n\nyears.    In addition, Walter Wechsler, the member of the Board of Governors who diss\n\nfrom the decision to dismiss San Filippo, stated that \"the punishment is clearly ou\n\nproportion to his alleged wrongdoing, and quite possibly tainted by a long history\n\nanimus.\"    (A.322).\n\n           San Filippo also has presented evidence that other faculty members had co\n\ninfractions of comparable seriousness yet had not been punished.     For example, Prof\n\nRichard Hartwick of the chemistry department testified before the Senate Panel that\nhad two students pitch hay for him on his farm.    Another professor, George Muha, te\n\nthat, as a student, he had helped his faculty advisor move from one place to anothe\n\nProfessor Muha also testified that he had some of his own students work with him in\n\nphotography lab, and that foreign students he had invited to his house at Thanksgiv\n\n\n0\n With respect to the second part of the Contractors Assoc. test -- why the informat\nnot previously obtained --Rutgers argues that the May 19, 1989 Stipulation preclude\nfurther discovery. This argument is unpersuasive. We agree with the district cour\nconclusion that the Stipulation did not necessarily foreclose additional discovery.\n\n\n\n                                              18\n\fdomestic chores including yard work for him.    Based on this evidence, a fact-finder\n\nreasonably find that San Filippo would not have been dismissed in the absence of hi\n\nprotected activities.   Accordingly, even if the denial of the Rule 56(f) motion wer\n\nerroneous, we would vacate the grant of summary judgment.\n\n          In light of our decision to vacate the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment on San Filippo's first amendment claim, we need to address certain other i\n\nthat are relevant to the course of proceedings on remand.\n\nA.       Protected activity\n\n          As explained above, one who alleges retaliatory discharge from government\n\nemployment must establish that the conduct which triggered the discharge was protec\n\nunder the first amendment.    Where the alleged retaliation is based on expressive co\n\nconstituting speech, a court must first determine whether or not the speech can be\n\ncharacterized as addressing a \"matter of public concern,\" for a governmental employ\n\nmakes public complaints about problems not of \"public concern\" has no first amendme\n\nimmunity against employer discipline.

First, the Court took note of the esta\n\nprinciple that, if a restraint of trade is caused by otherwise valid governmental a\n\nthere is no Sherman Act violation.   See id. at 135-36.

These First Amendment rights are insepa\n          and there is no sound basis for granting greater constitutional protectio\n          statements made in a petition to the President than other First Amendment\n          expressions.\n\n\nMcDonald, 472 U.S. at 482, 485 (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n                                              25\n\f            As the arguments advanced in the briefs in the case at bar make clear, th\n\nSupreme Court cases we have just canvassed, while long on nuance, do not yield an e\n\nidentified single common denominator.\n\n            San Filippo and the Rutgers AAUP would have us regard San Filippo's petit\n\nactivities protected under the first amendment unless those petitions were \"mere sh\n\n\"baseless litigation.\"    They stress that none of the very narrow limitations the Su\n\nCourt has placed on the right to petition involves an examination of the content of\n\npetition.    They also argue that the petitions at issue in Noerr and Pennington did\n\naddress matters of public concern, and therefore those cases implicitly rejected th\n\nproposition that petitioning is protected under the first amendment only if the pet\n\naddresses a matter of public concern.    The Rutgers AAUP contends that \"there is eve\n\nreason that the lines drawn around the right to petition in public employment be th\n\nas those drawn for selfish petitioners everywhere.\"    That is, the Rutgers AAUP woul\n\nus define the contours of the right to petition without consideration of the contex\n\nwhich that right is exercised.\n\n            In contrast, Rutgers argues -- we think persuasively --that \"[t]he nature\n\nlimitation upon the petition right depends upon context.\"    Rutgers contends that th\n\nSupreme Court cases analyzing the extent of the petition right in the antitrust, la\n\nand libel contexts are not necessarily instructive in the case at bar, which concer\nability of a government employer to dismiss an employee for filing lawsuits and gri\n\nagainst the employer.

The general question posed by the case at bar is whether --\n\nnotwithstanding the dicta from McDonald quoted above -- there are contexts in which\n\npetition clause protects values additional to those protected by the speech clause.\n\n          McDonald is a case in which the petition clause protects no value that is\n\nprotected by the speech clause. The petition at issue in McDonald was a letter to t\n\nPresident. Smith and Knight instruct that not every communication which the writer\n\ndenominates a \"petition\" imposes on the government agency or official addressed an\n\nobligation to respond.   See Knight, 465 U.S. at 285; Smith, 441 U.S. at 465.    Accor\n\nit is difficult to distinguish in any meaningful way between words contained in a l\n\nto the President and words contained in, for example, an advertisement appearing in\n\nNew York Times.\n\nThis difficulty presumably was the underpinning of the McDonald Court's holding tha\n\nMcDonald's words about a public figure should not be immunized simply because they\n\nappeared in a letter characterized as a \"petition.\"   Moreover, the reasons for hold\n\n\nforecloses Rutgers' position.

Button, 371 U\n          415, 429-31 (1963), for advancing ideas and seeking redress of grievances\n          retaliation against one who institutes litigation (or its condition prece\n          Title VII litigation, the lodging of charges with civil rights agencies)\n          discourages litigation; therefore such retaliation invades a First Amendm\n          right. The weakness is the first premise, which is stated too broadly.\n          litigation seeks to advance political or other ideas; litigation by the N\n          seeking to eliminate public school segregation is an example. And even w\n          litigation has private rather than public objectives, communications desi\n          acquaint individuals with their legal rights are within the scope of the\n          Amendment. But not every legal gesture -- not every legal pleading -- is\n          protected by the First Amendment. Remedies against baseless litigation d\n          violate the First Amendment's right to petition; nor do laws aimed at det\n          'far out' suits by requiring the loser to pay the winner's legal fees.\n\nId. at 419 (citations omitted). Because the court concluded that Yatvin's sex\ndiscrimination claim against her employer had purely private objectives, the court\nrejected Yatvin's claim that her employer's retaliation violated the petition claus\nat 419-20.

Not only is there no legal or historical precedent\n           such a stratification of first amendment freedoms, as McDonald suggests,\n           such special treatment of the right to petition would unjustly favor thos\n           through foresight or mere fortuity present their speech as a grievance ra\n           than in some other form.\n\n\nId. at 1262 (emphasis in original).    Again, affording special treatment to speech f\n\na grievance is \"unjust\" only if no independent reason exists for affording special\n\nprotection to a mechanism for redress of grievances against the government.\n\n            There is an additional argument for testing a public employee's lawsuits\n\nhis or her employer by the Connick public concern threshold not made in the Seventh\n\nCircuit cases: namely, that the governmental interests which led the Court to impos\n\npublic concern threshold on employee speech would appear to justify imposing a simi\n\nthreshold on employee lawsuits and grievances.     Under Connick, employers are able t\n\ndiscipline their employees for speech unless the speech addresses a matter of publi\n\nconcern.    The rationale for this distinction is that it represents an effort to see\nbalance between the interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon m\n\nof public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the\n\nefficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\"    Connick, 461\n\nat 142.    The Supreme Court recently elaborated on the basis for authorizing the gov\n\nas employer to exercise broader power in regulating the speech of its employees tha\n\ngovernment as sovereign may exercise in regulating the speech of the general public\n\n\n                [T]he extra power the government has in this area comes from the nat\n           the government's mission as employer. Government agencies are charged by\n           with doing particular tasks. Agencies hire employees to help do those ta\n           effectively and efficiently as possible. When someone who is paid a sala\n\n\n                                              31\n\f          that she will contribute to an agency's effective operation begins to say\n          things that detract from the agency's effective operation, the government\n          employer must have some power to restrain her. The reason the government\n          in the example given above, fire the [high-ranking] deputy [who criticize\n          state governor's legislative program] is not that this dismissal would so\n          be narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest. It is that the\n          governor and the governor's staff have a job to do, and the governor just\n          feels that a quieter subordinate would allow them to do this job more\n          efficiently.\n\n               The key to First Amendment analysis of government employment decisio\n          then, is this: The government's interest in achieving its goals as effec\n          and efficiently as possible is elevated from a relatively subordinate int\n          when it acts as sovereign to a relatively significant one when it acts as\n          employer. The government cannot restrict speech of the public at large ju\n          the name of efficiency. But where the government is employing someone fo\n          very purpose of effectively achieving its goals, such restrictions may we\n          appropriate.\n\n\nWaters v.

As applied to communications th\n\nnot petitions, the Connick rule means that a public employee who goes public -- e.g\n\nwriting to The New York Times -- with an employment dispute that is not of \"public\n\nconcern\" runs the risk of being disciplined by her public employer for undertaking\n\npublic attention to a private dispute.   But when one files a \"petition\" one is not\n\nappealing over government's head to the general citizenry:    when one files a \"petit\n\none is addressing government and asking government to fix what, allegedly, governme\n\nbroken or has failed in its duty to repair.0\n\n\n0\n Like the Seventh Circuit in Belk, our dissenting colleague draws comfort from the\nCourt's observation in McDonald that the first amendment right to petition and the\namendment \"freedoms to speak, publish and assemble . . . are inseparable\" and hence\nis no sound basis for granting greater constitutional protection to statements made\npetition to the President than other First Amendment expressions.\" 472 U.S. at 485\nit is important to note that the Court's language in McDonald was addressed to a qu\nvery different from the question presented in Belk and the case at bar. In McDonal\nquestion was whether one who was defamed in a letter was disabled from suing the le\nwriter by virtue of the fact that the letter was written to the President and thus\nbe characterized as a \"petition\" within the meaning of the first amendment.

The letter-writer all\nalso saw fit to send copies of one or both of the letters to Senator Jesse Helms, t\nmembers of the House of Representatives, and the then Director of the Federal Burea\nInvestigation, William Webster, as well as then Presidential Adviser Edwin Meese.\nU.S. at 481.\n\n\n                                               33\n\f          One example of formal governmental adoption of a mechanism for redress of\n\ngrievances is entry into a collective bargaining agreement that provides for a grie\n\nprocedure. Another example of formal government adoption of such a mechanism is wai\n\nsovereign immunity from suit in the courts of that sovereign.       If government could,\n\nemployer, freely discharge an employee for the reason that the employee, in order t\n\npresent a non-sham claim against the government-employer, invoked such a mechanism,\n\npetition clause of the first amendment would, for public employees seeking to vindi\n\ntheir employee interests, be a trap for the unwary -- and a dead letter.\n\n          The petition clause of the first amendment was not intended to be a dead\n\n-- or a graceful but redundant appendage of the clauses guaranteeing freedom of spe\n\npress.   To be sure, \"the right to petition,\" as the Court noted in McDonald, \"is cu\n\nthe same cloth as the other guarantees of that Amendment. . . .\"      472 U.S. at 482.\n\nthe Court in McDonald also stressed that the right to petition \"is an assurance of\n\nparticular freedom of expression.\"      Ibid.   More to the point, the right to petition\n\npedigree independent of --and substantially more ancient -- than the freedoms of sp\n\nand press.   The Court pointed out in McDonald that \"[T]he historical roots of the P\n\nClause long antedate the Constitution.      In 1689, the Bill of Rights exacted of Will\n\nMary stated: '[I]t is the Right of the Subjects to petition the King.'      1 Wm. & Mar\n                           0\nSess. 2, ch. 2.\"   Ibid.       But of particular moment for the issue before us is that\n\n\n0\n  The remote antecedents of the right of petition trace back to Magna Carta, chapte\nwhich provides:\n\n          . . . if we or our justiciar, or our bailiffs, or any of our servants\n          shall have done wrong in any way toward any one, or shall have\n          transgressed any of the articles of peace or security; and the wrong\n          shall have been shown to four barons of the aforesaid twenty-five\n          barons, let those four barons come to us or to our justiciar, if we\n          are out of the kingdom, laying before us the transgression, and let\n          them ask that we cause that transgression to be corrected without\n          delay.\n\n\n\n                                                 34\n\fParliament, in the Bill of Rights, not only declared the right of subjects \"to peti\n\nthe King,\" but went on to provide that \"all committments [sic] and prosecutions for\n\npetitioning are illegal.\"   1 W. & M., 2d Sess., c. 2, ยง 5, 16 Dec. 1689.   The right\n\npetition and its attendant, and indispensable, immunity from \"committments and\n\nprosecutions\"0 were, in the Court's felicitous phrase, \"exacted of William and Mary\n\nMcDonald, 472 U.S. at 482, in 1689. That was precisely one hundred years before the\n\nBut of course the right lukewarmly acknowledged by King John was exercisable only b\nbarons.\n0\n The critical importance of Parliament's declaration that it was \"illegal\" to penal\nsubject \"for such petitioning\" was made plain by Blackstone in his celebrated\nCommentaries, the series of law books best known to American lawyers of the late\neighteenth and early nineteenth centuries:\n\n             If there should happen any uncommon injury, or infringement of the\n          rights before mentioned, which the ordinary course of law is too\n          defective to reach, there still remains a fourth subordinate right,\n          appertaining to every individual, namely, the right of petitioning the\n          king, or either house of parliament, for the redress of grievances.\n          In Russia we are told that the czar Peter established a law, that no\n          subject might petition the throne till he had first petitioned two\n          different ministers of state. In case he obtained justice from\n          neither, he might then present a third petition to the prince; but\n          upon pain of death, if found to be in the wrong: the consequence of\n          which was, that no one dared to offer such third petition; and\n          grievances seldom falling under the notice of the sovereign, he had\n          little opportunity to redress them. The restrictions, for some there\n          are, which are laid upon petitioning in England, are of a nature\n          extremely different; and, while they promote the spirit of peace, they\n          are no check upon that of liberty. Care only must be taken, lest,\n          under the pretence of petitioning, the subject be guilty of any riot\n          or tumult, as happened in the opening of the memorable parliament in\n          1640: and, to prevent this, it is provided by the statute 13 Car. II.\n          st. I, C. 5, that no petition to the king, or either house of\n          parliament, for any alteration in church or state, shall be signed by\n          above twenty persons, unless the matter thereof be approved by three\n          justices of the peace, or the major part of the grand jury in the\n          country; and in London by the lord mayor, aldermen, and common\n          council: nor shall any petition be presented by more than ten persons\n          at a time. But, under these regulations, it is declared by the\n          statute I W. and M. st. 2, c. 2, that the subject hath a right to\n          petition; and that all commitments and prosecutions for such\n          petitioning are illegal.\n\n1 William Blackstone, Commentaries *143.\n\n\n                                             35\n\fCongress charged with implementing America's new Constitution submitted to the stat\n\nratification, proposed amendments to that Constitution permanently establishing in\n\nAmerican law the right of petition and other fundamental rights.   There is no persu\n\nreason for the right of petition to mean less today than it was intended to mean in\n\nEngland three centuries ago.\n\n           On remand, the district court should consider which, if any, of San Filip\n\ngrievances and lawsuits constituted a \"petition,\" and whether any such \"petition\" w\n\nsham.

Substantial factor\n\n           Our decision to vacate the grant of summary judgment on San Filippo's fir\n\namendment claim also requires us to consider Rutgers' argument that, contrary to th\n\ndistrict court's conclusion, it was entitled to summary judgment because San Filipp\n\ncannot show that his protected conduct \"was a substantial factor in the alleged\n\nretaliatory action.\"   Czurlanis v.

Alth\n\nthe district court believed that no fact-finder could reasonably infer that San Fil\nprotected activities in 1977-1979 and 1983-84 were a substantial factor motivating\n\ndismissal, the court concluded that San Filippo was brought up on charges and dismi\n\n\n\n\n                                             36\n\fsufficiently soon after he made protected statements in or around 19860 to raise an\n\ninference of retaliation.0\n\n            At the outset, we disagree with the district court's view that San Filipp\n\nprotected activities in 1977-79 and 1983-84 were too far removed in time to support\n\ninference of retaliation.    Although a dismissal that occurs years after protected a\n\nmight not ordinarily support an inference of retaliation, where, as here, a plainti\n\nengages in subsequent protected activity and the plaintiff is dismissed shortly aft\n\nfinal episode of such protected activity, a fact-finder may reasonably infer that i\n\nthe aggregate of the protected activities that led to retaliatory dismissal.    This\n\ninference would be particularly strong if the plaintiff can show that the decisionm\n\nlacked a pretext on which to dismiss the plaintiff until shortly before the time of\n\ndismissal.\n\n            Rutgers argues that the temporal proximity between San Filippo's protecte\n\nactivities and the disciplinary proceedings against him cannot, by itself, support\n\ninference that the protected activity was a substantial factor in the alleged retal\n\naction.   We need not address this argument, however, because San Filippo has additi\n\nevidence to support his allegation that he was dismissed in retaliation for his pro\n\nactivity.    The evidence described above as support for San Filippo's position that\n\nwould not have been dismissed absent his protected activities -- the statements of\nEdelstein and Board of Governors member Wechsler and the evidence that other facult\n\nmembers committed infractions of comparable seriousness yet went unpunished -- equa\n\nsupport his position that his protected conduct was a substantial factor motivating\n\n0\n The court presumably was referring to San Filippo's disputes with senior members o\ndepartment over their efforts to obtain \"inappropriate percentages\" of his federal\nand particularly his complaint to the University in October, 1985 about the chemist\ndepartment's attempts to divert funds improperly from his federal grants under the\nof a \"shop-user's fee.\" See page 5, supra. San Filippo was orally informed of the\ncharges against him in November, 1985.\n0\n The activities found by the district court to address matters of public concern ar\ndescribed briefly at note 13, supra.\n\n\n                                              37\n\fdismissal.   On the basis of this evidence, we conclude that a fact-finder could rea\n\nfind that San Filippo's protected conduct was a substantial factor motivating his\n\ndismissal.\n\n          Rutgers next argues that San Filippo is inappropriately\n\nseeking to impute to the members of the Board of Governors the improper motives of\n\nresponsible for bringing charges against him.

Praprotnik recognized that final decision-making power may be delegated,\n\nthat a local governing body may be held liable based upon the exercise of this dele\n\npower.   See id. at 124.   But the Court added:\n\n\n            Simply going along with discretionary decisions made by one's subordinate\n            however, is not a delegation to them of the authority to make policy. It\n            equally consistent with a presumption that the subordinates are faithfull\n            attempting to comply with the policies that are supposed to guide them.\n            would be a different matter if a particular decision by a subordinate was\n            in the form of a policy statement and expressly approved by the supervisi\n            policymaker. It would also be a different matter if a series of decision\n            subordinate official manifested a \"custom or usage\" of which the supervis\n            have been aware. . . . But the mere failure to investigate the basis of\n            subordinate's discretionary decisions does not amount to a delegation of\n            policymaking authority, especially where (as here) the wrongfulness of th\n            subordinate's decision arises from a retaliatory motive or other unstated\n            rationale.\n\nId. at 130.    In addition to holding that the \"mere failure to investigate the basis\n\nsubordinate's discretionary decisions\" does not make the subordinate a final policy\n\nthe\n\nPraprotnik Court also implicitly held that the local governing body is not liable f\n\nmere failure to investigate by the final policy-maker.\n            Our use of a \"deliberate indifference\" standard does not make the Univers\n\nliable for the Board's mere failure to investigate -- that is, the University would\n\nliable if, oblivious to the motivation behind the decision to charge San Filippo an\n\ninitiate dismissal proceedings, the Board had decided to dismiss San Filippo for wh\n\nlegitimate reasons. Such a scenario would not amount to deliberate indifference of\n\nBoard to San Filippo's first amendment rights.     The scenario described by San Filip\n\nhowever, goes beyond that of an oblivious Board failing to investigate.\n\n\n\n\n                                              40\n\f           San Filippo presented to the district court evidence that the Board had r\n\nto suspect that San Filippo's prior protected activities had been a substantial mot\n\nfactor in the decision to initiate dismissal proceedings.   As the magistrate judge\n\n\"the record is replete with evidence which indicates that the information regarding\n\nFilippo's protected activities was well known to the individual members of the Boar\n\n(A.2152 n.15).

As in Ware, this evidence suffices to create a question for the fact-find\n\nregarding whether the ultimate decision-maker acted with deliberate indifference to\n\nplaintiff's first amendment rights by approving the recommendation that the plainti\n\ndismissed.0\n\n\n0\n The Supreme Court's recent decision in Waters v.

In Waters, the Court addressed the question whether t\nConnick test should be applied to what the government employer thought the employee\nor to what the fact-finder ultimately determines was said. The Court took an inter\nposition, holding that a court should accept the employer's factual conclusions, bu\nif the employer was reasonable in arriving at those conclusions.

San Filippo's procedural due process claim\n\n          San Filippo also asks us to vacate the district court's grant of summary\njudgment on his procedural due process claim. San Filippo argues that his due proce\n\nrights were violated because the five members of the Senate Panel that conducted th\n\nhearings and recommended that he be dismissed were not impartial decision-makers an\n\nbecause the proceeding was tainted by the appearance of impropriety.    Specifically,\n\nFilippo alleges in his Third Amended Complaint:\n\n\n          [The] members of the panel were negotiating with the Rutgers Administrato\n          chiefly responsible for supervising the prosecution of the case for addit\n          compensation, thus giving them a financial incentive in the outcome of th\n          proceedings, in that they reasonably would believe that they would get\n          additional compensation only if their final decision was favorable to the\n          Administrator. Furthermore, all the contacts for such additional compens\n          were held in secret, thus leading to the appearance of impropriety on the\n          of the Panel.\n\n\nBoth the magistrate judge and the district court rejected San Filippo's argument th\n\nfact-finder could reasonably infer that the panel members believed they were more l\n\nto be compensated if they recommended that San Filippo be dismissed. In addition, t\n\nmagistrate judge and district court rejected San Filippo's argument that the \"secre\n\nnegotiations about compensation created an appearance of impropriety.    We agree wit\nconclusions reached by the magistrate judge and district court.\n\n          The Senate Panel was composed of five faculty members, chosen by lot afte\n\ncause and peremptory challenges, whose responsibility was to hold hearings and dete\n\n\n          punishing someone for exercising her First Amendment rights makes such ca\n          necessary.\n\nId. at 4402. By holding that the University may be held liable if a fact-finder fi\nthat the Board of Governors was deliberately indifferent to the possibility that di\nproceedings were initiated against San Filippo in retaliation for the exercise of h\nfirst amendment rights, we similarly require his employer to \"tread with a certain\nof care\" to avoid \"the possibility of inadvertently punishing someone for exercisin\nFirst Amendment rights.\"\n\n\n                                            42\n\fwhether the charges brought against San Filippo were true and constituted grounds f\n\ndismissal.    The panel had twelve meetings after it convened on December 5, 1986 and\n\nthe evidentiary hearings began.    Between March 24, 1987 and September 22, 1987, the\n\ndevoted forty-six days to evidentiary hearings.    After closing arguments, the panel\n\nanother twelve meetings before it produced a forty-four page report on December 21,\n\nThroughout the hearings, San Filippo was represented by two attorneys, Ira and Pame\n\nGoldberg, and a union counsellor provided by the Rutgers AAUP, Dr. Wells Keddie.\n\n            With the knowledge and consent of San Filippo's attorneys, Dr. Keddie, on\n\n5, 1987, sent a memorandum to the panel chair, Dr. Szatrowski, copied to San Filipp\n\nhis attorneys.    The memorandum suggested various ways to deal with time and schedul\n\nproblems:\n\n\n            I don't have a single original or good idea as to how to resolve the time\n            but there are some things which might mitigate the impact upon the commit\n            members. One of them is the course you are already pursuing, the seeking\n            some relief from normal duties while this demanding activity proceeds. I\n            to me that if the proceedings cannot be concluded by the May 15 date, it\n            be entirely appropriate to request the equivalent of Summer Session pay f\n            of you or released time for those of you (yourself) on \"summer vacation\"\n            upcoming trimester. But another possibility might well be worth consider\n            released time after this is all over to enable committee members to make\n            considerable lost time, energy, and opportunity.\n\n\nDr. Keddie also suggested that panel members \"be provided meals and accommodations.\n\n            When it became clear that the hearings would not conclude before commence\n\nSzatrowski asked San Filippo's attorney, Ira Goldberg, if he had any objection to\n\nSzatrowski asking Dr. Susan Cole, Vice President for University Administration and\n\nPersonnel, for summer compensation for the panel members.    Szatrowski and Goldberg\n\ntestified in their affidavits that Goldberg voiced no objection and wished Szatrows\n\n\"good luck.\"\n\n            When Szatrowski first requested additional compensation and/or released t\n\nthe spring of 1987, Cole denied the request because she believed that the panel mem\n\n\n                                              43\n\fwere already under an obligation to participate without extra compensation. In late\n\nspring, Szatrowski renewed the request in light of the length of the hearings and t\n\nthat certain panel members were ordinarily not required to be in attendance at Rutg\n\nover the summer.   By letters dated July 29, 1987, Cole granted the members their re\n\nextra compensation and release time.   San Filippo was not told of this decision.\n\n          Shortly after the summer increases were granted, Szatrowski asked Cole fo\n\nfurther additional compensation when it became clear that the hearings would contin\n\nthe fall. Cole testified that when Szatrowski approached her about the matter of fu\n\npayments, she \"told him when the panel was finished with its business, that we coul\n\ndiscuss the matter again.\"   Szatrowski similarly testified:\n\n\n          When I asked if this [the refusal to grant more compensation] meant that\n          regardless of the amount of additional time spent on this matter by the\n          panelists while carrying out their normal duties, there would be no furth\n          consideration for additional compensation in the future, Dr. Cole indicat\n          there would be no consideration possible until after the completion of th\n          hearings.\n\n\nUltimately, after the panel issued its final report recommending that San Filippo b\n\ndismissed, Cole recommended that the panel members receive extra compensation.\n\n          Based upon this factual scenario, San Filippo alleges that the panel memb\n\nwould have been tempted to reach an outcome in Rutgers' favor because they would ha\n\nbelieved that they were more likely to get extra compensation if they did so. We ag\n\nwith the magistrate judge and district court that there is insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport an inference that the faculty members believed that their receipt of compen\n\nwas tied to the outcome of the proceedings.   The cases cited by San Filippo are cas\n\nwhich the adjudicator had a direct financial interest in the outcome.

We find no evidence in the record to support a conclusion that the\n\nmembers believed that they were more likely to be compensated if they recommended S\n\nFilippo's dismissal.\n\n          San Filippo alternatively argues that the panel members' participation in\n\nhearings while negotiating for additional compensation created an appearance of\n\nimpropriety. See Commonwealth Coatings Corp. v.

Under Commonwealth Coatings, to prevail on an \"appearance of\n\nimpropriety\" due process claim, San Filippo must establish both that the events in\n\nquestion would cause one to reasonably question the panel's impartiality and that t\n\ninformation was concealed from San Filippo.   San Filippo makes much of the fact tha\n\nwas not told about the meetings between Szatrowski and Cole; however, in light of t\n\nthat Keddie suggested that Szatrowski broach the subject of extra compensation, the\n\nmeetings do not have the invidious character San Filippo suggests.\n\n          Finally, San Filippo argues that he should have had the opportunity to de\n\nSzatrowski to determine what was said in the conversations between Szatrowski and C\n\nSan Filippo contends that, although he noticed Szatrowski's deposition in August 19\ndiscovery was stayed after November 1989 when the motions for summary judgment were\n\nAs the district court noted, San Filippo has failed to explain why Szatrowski was n\n\ndeposed before August 1989 -- particularly, why he was not deposed during the summe\n\nfall of 1989 when San Filippo deposed nine other current and former officials and\n\nemployees of Rutgers.   Moreover, San Filippo does not indicate how he expects the\n\ndeposition testimony of Szatrowski to differ from the testimony found in Szatrowski\naffidavit, dated April 2, 1990. For these reasons, we conclude that the district co\n\n\n\n\n                                              45\n\fnot abuse its discretion by refusing to delay decision on the summary judgment moti\n\nuntil San Filippo had a chance to depose Szatrowski.\n\n\nIV.       Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm in part and vacate in part the order\n\ndistrict court.   We affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment in Rutger\n\nfavor on San Filippo's due process claim.   We vacate the district court's grant of\n\njudgment in Rutgers' favor on San Filippo's first amendment claim, and remand for\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                             46\n\fJoseph San Filippo, Jr. v.

As the Sup\n\nCourt explained in McDonald:\n          The Petition Clause . . . was inspired by the same ideals of liberty\n          and democracy that gave us the freedoms to speak, publish, and\n          assemble. These First Amendment rights are inseparable, and there is\n          no sound basis for granting greater constitutional protection to\n          statements made in a petition to the President than other First\n          Amendment expressions.\n\n\n472 U.S. at 484-85.
