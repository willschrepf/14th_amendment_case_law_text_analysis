The first,\nNo. B227686, is from a 2010 judgment in Lanning v. Kramer, Los Angeles County\nSuperior Court, No. SC099461. The plaintiffs are George Lanning (George L.), his wife\nNansee Lanning (Nansee L.), their son Justin Lanning (Justin L.), collectively the\nLannings, and The George and Nansee Lanning Revocable Trust, for which the trustees\nwere George L. and Nansee L. The defendants are Andrew Kramer (Andrew K.), his\nmother Rosalinda Kramer (Rosalinda K.), his son Matthew Kramer (Matthew K.),\ncollectively the Kramers, and his business, West Hollywood Center for Compassionate\nHealing, Inc. (WHCCH), doing business as The Sunset Shop, Inc.\n       The second appeal, No. B231249, is from a 2010 judgment in Kramer v. Lanning,\nLos Angeles County Superior Court, No. SC107434. The plaintiff is Andrew K. The\ndefendants are George L., Nansee L., The Lanning Family Trust, George L. and\nNansee L. as trustees, and The George and Nansee Lanning Revocable Trust, George L.\nand Nansee L. as trustees.1\n\n\n1       The Lanning Family Trust was in effect at the time the events leading to this\nlitigation began, and it was terminated during the course of the litigation between the\n\n                                             2\n\f                             FACTUAL BACKGROUND2\n\n\n       The Lanning Trust owned the commercial building and other real property\ncommonly known as the Sunset Building, at 8919-8923½ West Sunset Boulevard in West\nHollywood. The building has commercial and residential units. In September 2006,\nGeorge L. and Nansee L., as Trustees of the Lanning Trust, entered into a written lease\nwith Andrew K. for a portion of the Sunset Building, specifically 8921, 8923 and 8923½\nWest Sunset Boulevard (Premises)3 for a medical marijuana dispensary known as The\nSunset Shop (Dispensary).\n       In January 2007, Andrew K. and the Trust entered into an escrow agreement for\nAndrew K. to purchase the Sunset Building from the Lanning Trust. Andrew K. paid the\nTrust a $1 million deposit to be returned if the purchase did not close by a specified date.\nThe Lanning Trust gave Andrew K. two promissory notes, one for $600,000 and another\nfor $400,000, to secure repayment of the deposit to Andrew K. The purchase did not\nclose, and the parties cancelled the agreement.\n       In September 2007, George L. sent Andrew K. a letter offering to purchase the\nDispensary for a purchase price of $1,450,000 plus $300,000 for inventory. In November\nor December, Andrew K. and George L. with Nansee L. executed a term sheet entitled\nDeal Points as of 11/7 (Deal Points Memo). The Deal Points Memo included various\n\n\n\n\nparties. The George and Nansee Lanning Revocable Trust was formed and remained in\neffect at the time the judgments at issue herein were entered. For convenience, we refer\nto the trusts as the Lanning Trust or the Trust.\n2      Additional factual background appears in the discussion, post, in conjunction with\nthe issue on appeal to which the background relates.\n3      Andrew K. subsequently surrendered possession of the unit at 8923 West Sunset\nBoulevard in December 2007, when George L. took over the unit to serve as his\nresidence.\n\n\n                                             3\n\fdollar amounts, descriptive phrases and dates, but no sentences or paragraphs tying them\ntogether.\n       In late December 2007, George L., Nansee L. and Justin L. took over operation of\nthe Dispensary. They received all revenues from its operation. Andrew K. remained\ninvolved, and the Lannings paid him a consulting fee. On July 15, 2008, the Lannings\nmet with Andrew K. and informed him the consulting arrangement was terminated.\n       On July 17, 2008, before the Lannings arrived to open the Dispensary for business,\nAndrew K. had the locks on the Premises changed, took over the Premises and had his\nmother, Rosalinda K., his son, Matthew K., and security personnel come to the Premises.\nThe Lannings were not allowed to enter the Premises; they were confronted and warned\nto leave by members of the Kramer group. Justin L. called law enforcement for\nassistance. When the sheriff’s deputies arrived, Rosalinda K. told the deputies that the\nKramers had the right to be on the Premises and showed them a copy of the Lease. The\ndeputies declined to take further action on the basis that the dispute was a civil matter.\nMembers of the Kramer group entered the residence of George L. and took property the\nLannings used in operating the Dispensary.\n       The Lannings initiated litigation against the Kramers as more fully explained\nbelow. The Kramers subsequently initiated action against them. As a result of a\njudgment of possession entered in favor of the Lannings in one of the actions, on June 8,\n2009, the Lannings regained possession of the Premises and the Kramers and related\nbusiness entities vacated the Premises.\n\n\n                           PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n\n       The Lannings filed their complaint in Lanning v. Kramer (Super. Ct. L.A. County,\n2010, No. SC099461) on August 19, 2008 (Main Action). On September 2, 2008,\nGeorge L., as trustee for the Lanning Trust, filed an unlawful detainer action against\n\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\fAndrew K. (Lanning v. Kramer (Super. Ct. L.A. County, 2009, No. 08U02832)) (UD\nAction).\n       The Lannings filed their Second Amended Complaint (SAC) in the Main Action\non September 4, 2009. Three causes of action related to the Kramers’ conduct in retaking\nand retaining possession of the Premises from July 18, 2008 to June 8, 2009: forcible\nentry and forcible detainer of the Premises (second), trespass (third), and intentional\ninfliction of emotional distress (fourth). Five of the causes of action arose from the\nalleged agreement by Andrew K. to sell the Dispensary and its inventory to the Lannings\n(Sale Agreement). The causes of action alleged Andrew K.’s breach of the agreement to\nsell the Dispensary to the Lannings (first) and, for the period of forcible detainer,\n“intentional interference with contractual relations with the Sunset Shop’s customers”\n(fifth), “conversion of the Sunset shop and all its inventory and business equipment”\n(sixth), “an accounting of the Sunset Shop’s drug revenue” (seventh), and “a constructive\ntrust of the Lannings’ estimate of the profits of the marijuana dispensary” (eighth). The\nLannings also alleged, for the duration of the detainer period, breach of an implied-in-fact\nlease agreement against Andrew K. for rent and damage to the Premises (ninth), and\nunjust enrichment from Andrew K.’s Dispensary operation during the forcible detainer\nperiod (tenth).\n       The Lannings requested relief as follows: a sum in excess of $13,500,000 in\ngeneral damages, including, inter alia, revenues the Lannings lost from the sale of\nmedical marijuana as the result of Andrew K.’s forcible detainer and revenues Andrew K.\ncollected from the sales during forcible detainer, punitive damages for the intentional\ntorts, and attorney’s fees and costs.\n       In the UD Action, the trial court issued a judgment of possession to George L., as\ntrustee of the Lanning Trust, in April 2009. The judgment was enforced and, on June 8,\n2009, the Lannings took possession of the Premises from the Kramers.\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f       In January 2010, Andrew K. filed a motion for summary judgment in the Main\nAction seeking dismissal of the SAC. The trial court granted the motion for summary\njudgment as to the first, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth causes of action.4\n       The trial court found that the alleged Sale Agreement was void, in that the terms\nwere too uncertain and vague to be enforceable. The court continued that, even if the\nagreement were sufficiently certain, it would be unenforceable, in that it would be\nunlawful under the federal Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. §§ 812, 841(a)(1), 844).\nThe court found that the “performance of this agreement to buy/sell a marijuana\ndispensary and $300,000 worth of inventory . . . would require the transfer of possession\nof marijuana, a controlled substance . . . with the intent to distribute that” marijuana. The\ncourt noted that marijuana is identified as a “controlled substance” subject to the Act. (21\nU.S.C. §§ 802(6), (16) & 812(c), Schedule I, (c)(10).) The court stated that California’s\n“Proposition 215 does not conflict with the Controlled Substances Act because in passing\nProposition 215, California has merely exercised its state powers not to punish certain\nmarijuana offenses under state law when a doctor has recommended its use to treat a\nmedical condition.” If the dispensary sale transaction were legal under California law,\naccording to the court, that “does not change the fact [that] under federal law, any\nperson’s knowing and intentional acts ‘to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess\nwith intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance’ [such as\nmarijuana] are unlawful. 21 USC § 841(a)(1); see also 21 USC [§] 844(a).”\n       The Lannings then filed a third amended complaint (TAC) pursuant to the trial\ncourt’s grant of leave to amend, to add the Lanning Trust as a named plaintiff and remove\nthe former first, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth causes of action. The Lannings’\nremaining causes of action were for forcible entry and detainer (first), trespass (second),\n\n\n4      The parties refer to the trial court’s ruling as a partial summary judgment.\nTechnically, it was a summary adjudication of the specified causes of action. (Code Civ.\nProc., § 437c, subd. (f)(1).) We nonetheless refer to the “summary judgment” for\npurposes of this appeal.\n\n\n                                               6\n\fintentional infliction of emotional distress (third), breach of implied in fact contract (lease\nagreement) (fourth) and unjust enrichment (fifth). In paragraph 74, the Lannings\nexpanded the list of ways Andrew K. had been unjustly enriched to include (a) money\nthey paid Andrew K. prior to December 26, 2007, (b) money they paid to Andrew K.\nbetween December 26, 2007 and July 17, 2008, the period the Lannings operated the\nDispensary, and (c) the benefits Andrew K. obtained while operating the Dispensary\nduring the forcible detainer period.\n       Andrew K. moved to strike newly added portions of the TAC, except the addition\nof the Trust as a named plaintiff. After a hearing on the motion to strike, the trial court\ngranted the motion to strike as to certain additions, including but not limited to, the\nsources listed as unjustly enriching Andrew K. in paragraph 74, items (a), (b) and (c)\ninsofar as (c) sought net profits from Andrew K.’s operating the Dispensary during the\nforcible detainer period. At the hearing, the court also ruled on the Lannings’ motion for\nleave to amend to add the new portions to the TAC. The requested amendments sought,\ninter alia, restitution of purchase money paid to Andrew K. pursuant to the alleged Sale\nAgreement as well as restitution of any benefits, including net profits, obtained by\nAndrew K. from operating the Dispensary during the forcible detainer period. The trial\ncourt denied leave to amend “insofar as any claim is added which essentially revives any\npart of the contract claims which the court previously stated it would not enforce. That\nincludes the claims for rescission of the agreement to purchase the dispensary, claims for\ndamages arising from operation of the dispensary, and legal fees to resolve disputes with\nthe City of West Hollywood over the operations of the dispensary.”\n       In April 2010, Andrew K. filed suit against the Lannings, alleging they had not\nrepaid in full the two promissory notes the Lannings gave as security for the $1 million\ndeposit he paid them in seeking to purchase the Sunset Building in 2007 (Andrew Kramer\nv. George Lanning et al., 2010, L.A. Super. Ct. case No. SC107434) (Note Action).\nAndrew K. alleged the Lannings still owed him $408,000 on the second note.\n\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\f        The Main Action was tried before a jury in June 2010. In a prior proceeding, the\ncourt had found that Andrew K. committed a forcible entry and forcible detainer of the\nPremises, beginning on July 18, 2008. The jury rendered its verdict on June 23, 2010,\nfinding that Rosalinda K., Michael K. and the remaining Kramer defendants committed a\nforcible entry and forcible detainer. On this cause of action, the jury awarded damages of\n$236,613.68 against Andrew K. and $600 each against the other defendants. The jury\nfound the Kramer defendants committed a trespass and awarded damages of $23,286.75\nagainst Andrew K. and $75.88 each against the other defendants. The jury found\nAndrew K. was liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress, with damages of\n$25,000 to George L. and damages of $10,000 each to Nansee L. and Justin L. It also\nfound Rosalinda K. and Matthew K. liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress\nand assessed damages against Rosalinda K. and Matthew K. each for $1,000 for each of\nthe three Lannings.\n        The jury also found Andrew K. was entitled to a set off in the amount of his\nsecurity deposit, $23,210.87. The jury found by clear and convincing evidence that\nAndrew K., WHCCH, and The Sunset Shop, Inc. acted with malice, oppression, or fraud,\nand accordingly, the Lannings were entitled to punitive damages. However, the jury did\nnot assess any such damages.\n        The Lannings filed a motion for a new trial on damages only. The Kramers filed a\nmotion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The trial court denied both motions.\nJudgment and notice of entry of judgment were issued in the Main Action on July 16,\n2010.\n        In the Note Action, the trial court sustained the Lannings’ demurrer without leave\nto amend. On December 29, 2010, the trial court entered a judgment of dismissal of the\nNote Action.\n\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f                                        DISCUSSION\n\n\n                                               I\n                                      MAIN ACTION\n\n\nA. The Lannings’ Contentions\n       1. Summary Judgment as to the Causes of Action Related to the Alleged Sale\n       Agreement\n       The Lannings contend that the trial court erred in granting Andrew K.’s motion for\nsummary judgment as to their causes of action for breach of the alleged Sale Agreement,\nintentional interference with contractual relations, conversion, accounting and a\nconstructive trust. Specifically, the Lannings claim the trial court erred in ruling that the\nalleged Sale Agreement was unlawful pursuant to the federal Controlled Substances Act\n(21 U.S.C. §§ 812, 841(a)(1), 844), that by law, an illegal contract/transaction may not be\nthe basis of an action and, therefore, each of the causes of action was subject to summary\njudgment, given that existence of a valid sale agreement was an essential element of each\nof them.\n       We review a trial court’s grant of a summary judgment motion de novo. (Aguilar\nv. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 860.) Code of Civil Procedure\nsection 437c, subdivision (c), provides that a “motion for summary judgment shall be\ngranted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material\nfact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”\n       Initially, a moving defendant has the “burden of showing that a cause of action has\nno merit,” such as by showing “that one or more elements of the causes of action . . .\ncannot be established,” or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action. (Code\nCiv. Proc., § 437c, subds. (o), (p)(2); Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co., supra, 25 Cal.4th\nat p. 854.) If the defendant meets that burden, “the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to\nshow that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action” or\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\fas to the defense proffered by the defendant. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2);\nAguilar, supra, at p. 849.) We review the validity of the trial court’s ruling and not the\nreasons given for it by the trial court. (Byars v. SCME Mortgage Bankers, Inc. (2003)\n109 Cal.App.4th 1134, 1146.)\n       At the March 9, 2010 hearing on Andrew K.’s motion for summary judgment,\ncounsel for the Lannings began argument by addressing the issue of the illegality of the\nalleged Sale Agreement under federal law. The court then invited argument on its\ntentative conclusion that the agreement was void and unenforceable because of its\nvagueness and uncertainty as to the parties’ actual agreement.\n       The court found the alleged Sale Agreement, the Deal Points Memo, “was\nincomprehensible . . . . It might be a contract, but, at the same time, it might be a\nshopping list.” There followed brief argument by counsel that the agreement had been\npartially performed and its terms could be determined from the performance shown by\nrecords submitted as exhibits to their supporting declarations. The court found that there\nremained questions about the authenticity of the documents purported to be records of\npayments under the agreement. Ultimately, the trial court adopted its tentative decision\nas its final written decision. It found that “the contract at issue here, it is ‘so vaguely\nexpressed as to be wholly unascertainable’ and is therefore void. Civ[il] Code [section]\n1598.” It then went on to address the illegality issue, finding that, in any event, the\nagreement was illegal and unenforceable.\n       On appeal, the Lannings do not challenge the trial court’s determination that the\nalleged Sale Agreement was void for uncertainty and vagueness. The record reveals this\nwas not an inadvertent oversight, but rather the Lannings chose to challenge only the\ncourt’s determination of the agreement’s illegality. In their reply brief, for example, they\nassert that the determination the agreement was void for uncertainty and vagueness “is\ninconsequential” to their appeal. Where an appellant does not contend the trial court\nerred in making a determination, the appellant forfeits any claims concerning that\ndetermination. (Quinn v. U.S. Bank NA (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 168, 189-190; Benach v.\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\fCounty of Los Angeles (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 836, 852 [“When an appellant fails to\nraise a point . . . we treat the point as [forfeited].”].) The Lannings therefore forfeited any\nclaim of error with respect to the trial court’s determination that the alleged Sale\nAgreement was void for uncertainty and vagueness.\n       Andrew K. maintains that the trial court properly determined that the alleged Sale\nAgreement was void for uncertainty and vaguenesss, and that was a sufficient basis for\nthe court to grant his motion for summary judgment. We agree.\n       When the material facts are undisputed, as in this case, whether a contract exists is\na question of law which we independently review on appeal. (Bustamante v. Intuit, Inc.\n(2006) 141 Cal. App. 4th 199, 208.) According to Civil Code section 1550, the essential\nelements of a contract are: “1. Parties capable of contracting; [¶] 2. Their consent; [¶]\n3. A lawful object; and, [¶] 4. A sufficient cause or consideration.” “‘Under California\nlaw, a contract will be enforced if it is sufficiently definite (and this is a question of law)\nfor the court to ascertain the parties’ obligations and to determine whether those\nobligations have been performed or breached.’ [Citation.]” (Bustamante, supra, at\np. 209.) “The material factors to be ascertained from the written contract are the seller,\nthe buyer, the price to be paid, the time and manner of payment, and the property to be\ntransferred, describing it so it may be identified [Citations.]” (King v. Stanley (1948) 32\nCal.2d 584, 589, disapproved on another ground in Patel v. Liebermensch (2008) 45\nCal.4th 344, 351, fn. 4.) Civil Code section 1598 provides: “Where a contract has but a\nsingle object, and such object is unlawful, whether in whole or in part, or wholly\nimpossible of performance, or so vaguely expressed as to be wholly unascertainable, the\nentire contract is void.”\n       “‘[T]he modern trend of the law favors carrying out the parties’ intentions through\nthe enforcement of contracts and disfavors holding them unenforceable because of\nuncertainty. [Citations.]’ [Citation.]” (Amaral v. Cintas Corp. No. 2 (2008) 163\nCal.App.4th 1157, 1192.) To that end, a “contract will be enforced if it is possible to\nreach a fair and just result even if, in the process, the court is required to fill in some\n\n\n\n                                               11\n\fgaps.” (Ersa Grae Corp. v. Fluor Corp. (1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 613, 623.) Nevertheless,\n“[w]here a contract is so uncertain and indefinite that the intention of the parties in\nmaterial particulars cannot be ascertained, the contract is void and unenforceable . . . .\nUnless the court has ascertainable provisions of agreement before it, there is no contract\non which the court may act.” (Cal. Lettuce Growers v. Union Sugar Co. (1955) 45\nCal.2d 474, 481.) “To be enforceable, a promise must be definite enough that a court can\ndetermine the scope of the duty and the limits of performance must be sufficiently\ndefined to provide a rational basis for the assessment of damages.” (Ladas v. California\nState Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 770.)\n       It is undisputed that the parties never reduced the alleged Sale Agreement to the\ncustomary form of a written contract. George L. sent Andrew K. a letter entitled “‘Offer\nTo Purchase’ the Dispensary . . . for a ‘Purchase Price’ totaling $1,450,000 and for\n$300,000 for ‘Inventory.’” There is no signed acceptance of the offer by Andrew K. The\nparties acknowledge that part of their agreement was the two-page Deal Points Memo.\nTheir separate statements of undisputed facts reveals that the parties did not even agree\non what the object was of the Deal Points Memo. According to the Lannings, Andrew K.\nagreed to sell them the Dispensary. According to Andrew K., he agreed to grant them a\nlicense to operate the Dispensary, contingent upon their satisfaction of certain\nconditions.5\n       The Deal Points Memo was not in the form of a written contract and was virtually\ndevoid of complete sentences. There were dates, dollar amounts and cryptic phrases\nalongside the amounts, but no indication regarding, for example, who was required to pay\nor entitled to receive the dollar amounts, when payment was to be made or what the\npayment entitled the recipient to do or own. The memo states “300,000.00 owed for\n\n\n5       In their separate statements of undisputed facts, Andrew K. stated that the Deal\nPoints Memo was a “term-sheet . . . outlining the circumstances under which [the\nLannings] would operate the Dispensary.” The Lannings stated that it “outlined the terms\nof the sale of the Dispensary to the Lannings.”\n\n\n                                              12\n\fremainder,” with no identification of what “remainder” is intended or the person\nresponsible for payment or entitled to receive payment. There are references to “Loan\ntaken over” and “Loan Payment,” but no identification of the loan or its purpose. The\nmemo states “1,850,000.00 Total Sale for home,” but includes no description, legal or by\naddress, of the “home” or identity of the buyer or the seller. There is a handwritten note\nunder the heading “Payment Schedule” which states “$10,000/wk salary until <business>\npaid in full,” but no named recipient or even what “business” must be “paid in full.”\n       According to the Lannings, other terms of the parties’ alleged Sale Agreement\nwere implied from the conduct of the parties after they executed the Deal Points Memo.\nAs evidence of the conduct, the Lannings provided sets of handwritten documents\ndescribed as ledgers, which purportedly were evidence of their payments and debts to\nAndrew K. under the alleged Sale Agreement. However, the handwritten ledgers were\nalso so vague as to be incomprehensible as evidence of the terms and conditions of the\nalleged Sale Agreement. Each ledger set forth a brief caption, a column of dates (many\nwith no year designation), a corresponding column of dollar amounts and, in most cases,\nanother column of dollar amounts which sometimes was marked as the balance column.6\nIn some cases, there were additional columns, such as initials or what appeared to be a\nname of a particular type of medical marijuana.\n       The alleged Sale Agreement lacks clarity and is so vague as to render indiscernible\nthe elements necessary to formation of a contract, that is, the persons contracting, the\nobject of the contract, price or other consideration, time payment is due, or consent by all\nparties to any such terms and conditions necessary for the enforcement of the agreement.\n(Civ. Code, § 1550; King v. Stanley, supra, 32 Cal.2d at p. 589.) The trial court properly\ndetermined that, as a matter of law, the alleged Sale Agreement was “so uncertain and\nindefinite that the intention of the parties in material particulars cannot be ascertained”\n\n6     The captions on the handwritten ledgers were “Cash for Inventory,” “Checks Recd\nInventory,” “Inventory Fronted,” “Purchases,” “Drew Purchases,” “Cash Recd for\nBusiness,” “Business [unintelligible],” and “Loan.”\n\n\n                                             13\n\fand, as a result the agreement was void and unenforceable. (Cal. Lettuce Growers v.\nUnion Sugar Co., supra, 45 Cal.2d at p. 481.)\n       The existence of the alleged Sale Agreement was an essential element to the\nLannings’ first, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth causes of action in the SAC. Andrew K.\nmet his burden of showing that the Lannings could not establish the essential element, in\nthat the Lannings did not possess, and could not reasonably obtain, evidence needed to\nprove the existence of the alleged Sale Agreement. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subds. (o),\n(p)(2); Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co., supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp. 854-855.) The Lannings\nhave failed to meet their burden to show a triable issue of material fact exists with regard\nto the enforceability of the alleged Sale Agreement. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c,\nsubd. (p)(2); Aguilar, supra, at p. 849.) For these reasons, as a matter of law, Kramer\nwas entitled to the grant of his motion for summary judgment as to the first, fifth, sixth,\nseventh and eighth causes of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c); Kahn v. East\nSide Union High School Dist. (2003) 31 Cal.4th 990, 1002-1003.)\n       Inasmuch as the alleged Sale Agreement was in any event void for vagueness and\nuncertainty, we need not reach the Lannings’ contention that the trial court erred in\nfinding the alleged agreement was void for illegality. The result would be the same.\n\n\n       2. Preclusion of Restitution Damages for Consideration Paid for Dispensary\n       As part of the changes to the TAC, the Lannings amended their unjust enrichment\ncause of action (fifth) to seek restitution of the consideration they paid Andrew K. for the\nDispensary as well as disgorgement of Andrew K.’s profits from the Dispensary during\nthe forcible detainer period. As we noted previously, in paragraph 74 in the fifth cause of\naction, the Lannings expanded the list of ways Andrew K. had been unjustly enriched to\ninclude (a) money they paid Andrew K. prior to December 26, 2007, (b) money they paid\nAndrew K. between December 26, 2007 and July 17, 2008, the period the Lannings\noperated the Dispensary, and (c) the benefits Andrew K. obtained while operating the\nDispensary during the forcible detainer period.\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\f       The Lannings contend that the trial court erred in granting Andrew K.’s motion to\nstrike the additions. The Lannings argue that the court’s comment that restitution\ndamages were not recoverable, in that determination of them required reference to the\nvoid Sale Agreement, was not supported by the law of unjust enrichment. They cite\ncases in which some part of a contract was void as illegal, precluding damages based on\nbreach of contract, but the plaintiff was deemed entitled to equitable relief, i.e.,\nrestitution, “for any amounts he may have expended in [the] performance of the\nagreement.” (Dunkin v. Boskey (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 171, 197; see also Hernandez v.\nLopez (2009) 180 Cal.App.4th 932, 938-939 [allegations in pleading showed benefit paid\nto the defendant as consideration for the contract and were sufficient to permit restitution\nto the plaintiff].) The equitable doctrine of unjust enrichment “applies where the\nplaintiffs, while having no enforceable contract, nonetheless have conferred a benefit on\nthe defendant which the defendant has knowingly accepted under circumstances that\nmake it inequitable for the defendant to retain the benefit without paying for its value.\n[Citation.]” (Hernandez, supra, at p. 938.)\n       We turn our focus, however, to the court’s initial statement that, in prior\nproceedings on cross-motions for summary judgment, the court gave the Lannings “leave\nto amend the complaint as to the causes of action for forcible detainer, trespass, and\nunjust enrichment . . . to name the [T]rust as a plaintiff. The Lannings filed a [TAC] . . .\nin which the Lannings have done so. However, . . . the Lannings did not stop there, and\nhave added various words and phrases throughout the TAC. . . . [M]ost of the changes\n. . . are changes concomitant with the addition of a named plaintiff and update the TAC\nwith developments in this case since the SAC was filed . . . . Such amendments are\npermissible because they merely respond to the court’s reason for granting leave to\namend. . . . The Lannings have not sought, and the court did not previously grant, leave\nfor the Lannings to add any new claims for damages in the complaint . . . .” The court\nnoted that, for that reason, it was inclined to strike “[e]verything in the TAC ¶74 . . .\nexcept the language ‘Kramer, WHCCH and SSI have been unjustly enriched as a result of\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\fthe conduct alleged above by failing to pay rent to the Trust from July 18, 2008 to June 8,\n2009. In addition, Kramer, WHCCH and SSI caused over $75,000 in damage[s] to the\nunits in which the Sunset Shop operated while they forcibly detained the same.”\n       We agree that the Lannings’ additional claims for unjust enrichment went far\nbeyond the limited scope of the leave to amend to add the Trust as a named plaintiff.\n(See Patrick v. Alacer Corp. (2008)167 Cal.App.4th 995, 1015 [plaintiff’s amendment\nadding a new cause of action was permissible, in that it was within the specified scope of\nthe trial court’s grant of leave to amend]; People ex rel. Dept. of Pub. Wks. v. Clausen\n(1967) 248 Cal.App.2d 770, 785 [plaintiff may amend to name new parties where trial\ncourt expressly grants leave to do so; plaintiff may not add new parties, however, where,\nafter a demurrer is sustained, plaintiff has been granted leave to amend to state a cause of\naction].) The Lannings had not obtained leave to amend through a noticed motion for\nleave to amend before filing the TAC with the added material, as required pursuant to\nCode of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (a)(1). (Lee v. Bank of America (1994)\n27 Cal.App.4th 197, 217 and fn. 15.) Rather they sought leave to amend as a way to\noppose Andrew K.’s motion to strike.\n       The general policy of liberality in granting leave to amend does not apply where\nthe cause of action or the issues involved in it are “radically changed,” or the amendment\nwould “operate to the disadvantage or prejudice of the adverse party.” (Price v. Mason-\nMcDuffie Co. (1942) 50 Cal.App.2d 320, 325-326.) An amendment should not require a\ndefendant “to answer a wholly different legal liability or obligation from that originally\nstated.” (Klopstock v. Superior Court (1941) 17 Cal.2d 13, 20.) The trial court did not\nabuse its discretion in refusing to grant leave to amend with regard to the cause of action\n(fifth) for unjust enrichment.\n\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\f       3. Use of Andrew K.’s Special Verdict Form; Joint and Severable Liability\n       for Intentional Torts\n       The Lannings contend that the trial court erred in submitting Andrew K.’s special\nverdict form, which required the jury to specify the amount of damages attributable to\neach Kramer defendant if the jury found them liable, to the jury and in rejecting all their\nobjections. They claim that, by law, all of the Kramer defendants must be held jointly\nand separately liable for the total amount of damages assessed by the jury for the\nintentional torts. According to the Lannings, allowing such apportionment abrogated the\nprinciple of joint and several liability of all of the tortfeasors who conspire to commit the\nsame tort.\n       The Lannings cite Hughey v. Candoli (1958) 159 Cal.App.2d 231 as support for\ntheir contention, but that case also supports the use of a special verdict form allowing the\njury to state the amount of damages caused by each defendant, as Andrew K.’s form did.\nThe Hughey court stated that, generally, “‘“[w]here several persons act in concert and\ndamages result from their joint tort, each person is held for the entire damages . . . ,”’”\nand the same result applies even if persons are not acting in concert, but “‘“the results\nproduced by their acts are indivisible,”’” such as “‘“[d]eath, burning of a building or the\nsinking of a boat . . . .”’” (Id. at p. 240.) The court also stated, however, that if\n“‘“segregation as to causation can be established,”’” each tortfeasor bears “‘the burden of\nestablishing that his own wrong did not contribute to the damages, or the extent to which\nit did so.’” (Ibid.) In the instant case, the jury apparently decided that each Kramer\ndefendant met that burden and specified the damages against each defendant accordingly.\n       The facts do not support the Lannings’ claim that the torts produced indivisible\nresults requiring that defendants be held jointly and severally liable for all damages. (See\nHughey v. Candoli, supra, 159 Cal.App.2d at p. 240.) The torts were not single discrete\nevents, but rather they continued over a long period of time. For the duration of the\nforcible entry and forcible detainer, Andrew K. was present virtually every day, but\nRosalinda K. and Matthew K. were not.\n\n\n\n                                              17\n\f       As Andrew K. points out, the jury was instructed as to the indivisibility of\ndamages caused by defendants if they acted as members of a conspiracy in carrying out\nthe tortious conduct. At the Lannings’ request, the trial court instructed the jury on the\nelements required to find a conspiracy (CACI No. 3600), as well as the indivisibility of\nthe damages caused by a conspiracy (CACI No. 3601, also D-9). The court stated: “If\nyou decide that defendants join the conspiracy to commit the torts . . . , then they are\nresponsible for all acts done as part of the conspiracy, whether they occurred before or\nafter they join the conspiracy.”\n       The Lannings’ special verdict form did not request a specific finding as to\nconspiracy. The form only had one line for entry of damages. The court rejected the\nLannings’ form, reasoning that the form did not allow for the possibility of the jury\nfinding that the Kramer defendants did not act in a conspiracy and needing spaces for\nspecification of the amount of damages as to each defendant. As the Lannings observed\nin their opening brief, “[b]ecause the apportionments [in the final verdict] were different\n[for each Kramer defendant], the only conclusion that reconciles the apportionment is\nthat the jury concluded that there was no conspiracy amongst defendants.” The trial\ncourt did not err in permitting use of Andrew K.’s special verdict form.\n\n\n       4. “Tort of Another” Attorney’s Fees\n       In the TAC, the Lannings amended their prayer for attorney’s fees to include fees\nauthorized by “the ‘tort of another’ doctrine.” The jury found that Andrew K., Rosalinda\nK., and Matthew K. had committed the tort of forcible entry and forcible detainer of the\nPremises. Among other things, the evidence showed that, on the day of their forcible\nentry, Rosalinda K. and Matthew K. spoke to the sheriff’s deputies who responded to the\nLannings’ telephone call for help, and Rosalinda K. showed them a copy of the Lease\nbetween the Lannings and Andrew K. Upon seeing the Lease, a deputy said that the\nsituation appeared to be a civil matter, and the deputies left. Thereafter, the Lannings\nfiled the UD Action against Andrew K. to regain possession of the Premises. The\n\n\n\n                                             18\n\fLannings sought to recover the attorney’s fees they expended in the UD Action from\nRosalinda K. and Matthew K. as damages in the Main Action under the “tort of another”\ndoctrine. The trial court ruled that the doctrine did not apply.\n       On appeal, the Lannings claim the court erred, and the doctrine did apply. The\ngist of the Lannings’ argument is that, but for the wrongful conduct of Rosalinda K. and\nMatthew K. in representing to the sheriff’s deputies that they and Andrew K. had a legal\nright to be in possession of the Premises under the Lease, the Lannings would not have\nhad to file and prosecute the UD Action. Therefore, the Lannings assert, they are entitled\nto recover their attorney’s fees and costs in the UD Action from Rosalind K. and\nMatthew K. as damages for their wrongful conduct under the “tort of another” doctrine.\n       The general rule in tort actions is that the party who employs the attorney pays the\nattorney’s fees, in the absence of some special agreement, statutory provision, or\nexceptional circumstances. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1021; Prentice v. North Amer. Title\nGuar. Corp. (1963) 59 Cal.2d 618, 620.) The “tort of another” doctrine arises in the\nexceptional circumstances when a “person who through the tort of another has been\nrequired to act in the protection of his interests by bringing or defending an action against\na third person.” (Prentice, supra, at p. 620.) In such circumstances, the person “is\nentitled to recover compensation for the reasonably necessary loss of time, attorney’s\nfees, and other expenditures . . . suffered or incurred” in the action against the third\nperson. (Ibid.)\n       Under the “tort of another” doctrine, attorney’s fees are awarded as one element of\ndamages suffered by the plaintiff who was required to sue a third person to protect his\nrights as “the natural and proximate consequence” of the torts committed against the\nplaintiff by the defendant; the attorney’s fees are not “‘the measure and mode of\ncompensation of attorneys’” governed by Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.\n(Prentice v. North Amer. Title Guar. Corp., supra, 59 Cal.2d at p. 621; see also Gray v.\nDon Miller & Associates, Inc. (1984) 35 Cal.3d 498, 505, 507 [a plaintiff may recover\nattorney’s fees “if he is required to employ counsel to prosecute or defend an action\n\n\n\n                                              19\n\fagainst a third party because of the tort of defendant”]; Behniwal v. Mix (2005) 133\nCal.App.4th 1027, 1043.) “‘Unless the parties stipulate otherwise, a claim for attorney\nfees under the “tort of another” doctrine . . . must be pleaded and proved to the trier of\nfact. [Citations.]’” (Gorman v. Tassajara Development Corp. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th\n44, 79.)\n       Because the attorney’s fees awarded under the “tort of another” doctrine are “in\nfact an element of tort damages, nearly all of the cases which have applied the doctrine\ninvolve a clear violation of a traditional tort duty between the tortfeasor who is required\nto pay the attorney fees and the person seeking compensation for those fees. [Citations.]”\n(Sooy v. Peter (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 1305, 1310.) The “tort of another” doctrine does\nnot apply, however, “to the situation where a plaintiff has been damaged by the joint\nnegligence of codefendants.” (Gorman v. Tassajara Development Corp., supra, 178\nCal.App.4th at p. 80.) The doctrine, as set forth in Prentice v. North Amer. Title Guar.\nCorp., supra, 59 Cal.2d at pages 620 and 621, “‘was not intended to apply to one of\nseveral joint tortfeasors in order to justify additional attorney fee damages. If that were\nthe rule there is no reason why it could not be applied in every multiple tortfeasor case\nwith the plaintiff simply choosing the one with the deepest pocket as the “Prentice\ntarget.” Such a result would be a total emasculation of Code of Civil Procedure\nsection 1021 in tort cases.’” (Gorman, supra, at p. 80.)\n       The trial court properly ruled that the Lannings were not entitled to attorney’s fees\nas “tort of another” damages against Rosalinda K. and/or Matthew K. The TAC alleges\nthat “[b]ecause of the forcible entry and detainer of the Premises by Matthew Kramer,\nRosalinda Kramer and their security personnel, the Lannings were forced to retain\ncounsel and cause the Trust to commence a lawsuit [as] an unlawful detainer action\nagainst Andrew Kramer to reclaim possession of the Premises.” The Lannings did not\nplead any “tort of another” damages against Rosalinda K. and Matthew K. (Gorman v.\nTassajara Development Corp., supra, 178 Cal.App.4th at p. 79.) The TAC alleges that\nall three—Rosalinda K., Matthew K. and Andrew K.—were joint tortfeasors. (Id. at\n\n\n\n                                             20\n\fp. 80.) The Lannings did not institute the unlawful detainer action against only Andrew\nK. solely as “the natural and proximate consequence” of the torts of Rosalinda K. and\nMatthew K. (Prentice v. North Amer. Title Guar. Corp., supra, 59 Cal.2d at p. 621.)\nThus, the “tort of another” doctrine could not, and did not, apply.\n\n\n       5. The Lannings’ Motion for Retrial on Damages Only\n       The Lannings contend the trial court erred in denying their motion for a new trial\non damages only. The Lannings do not challenge any of the jury’s findings on liability.\nWhen the court denies a new trial, we “conduct an independent examination of the\nproceedings to determine whether a miscarriage of justice occurred.” (People v. Ault\n(2004) 33 Cal.4th 1250, 1261-1262, fn. omitted; Cal. Const., art. 6, § 13.)\n       First the Lannings contend that, as their foregoing claims show, the manner in\nwhich the jury answered the special verdict questions on damages is unclear and may be\nthe result of error. As we previously concluded, there was no error.\n       The Lannings also claim that retrial on the amount of punitive damages is\nwarranted, in that Andrew K. failed to provide sufficient information to allow the\nLannings’ financial expert to offer evidence of Kramer’s current net worth for the jury’s\nconsideration in determining the amount of punitive damages to award. The expert was\nScott Mowrey, a certified public accountant. He testified that he had received the 2006\nand 2007 tax returns for Andrew K., together with some supporting documents and\npartial statements from brokerage accounts. Mowrey stated the dollar amount, in his\nopinion, of Andrew K.’s net worth.\n       During the hearing on punitive damages, counsel for the Lannings never raised an\nobjection, or even mentioned, that the financial information made available to Mowrey\nwas insufficient for the purpose of assessing Andrew K.’s net worth. Counsel was not\ncaught by surprise, however; he had the opportunity to become aware of the alleged\ninsufficiency prior to the hearing. According to his declaration, the court permitted\ncounsel for the Lannings to meet with Mowrey and review the financial information\n\n\n\n                                            21\n\fprovided by Andrew K. during a break prior to the start of the hearing. By failing to\nmake a timely objection, the Lannings forfeited any error with respect to the punitive\ndamages procedure, including any failure by Andrew K. to provide sufficient financial\ninformation for the determination of his net worth. (See, e.g., City of El Monte v.\nSuperior Court (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 272, 280 [plaintiff forfeited objection to punitive\ndamages procedure by failing to object before jury was discharged].)\n       In any event, substantial evidence would support a finding that the information\nwas sufficient. When a plaintiff attacks the sufficiency of the evidence to support the\ntrier of fact’s finding, our power on appeal “‘begins and ends with the determination as to\nwhether there is any substantial evidence contradicted or uncontradicted which will\nsupport the finding of fact.’ [Citations.]” (Foreman & Clark Corp. v. Fallon (1971) 3\nCal.3d 875, 881, italics omitted.) The Lannings’ financial expert identified the evidence\nprovided to him and stated the specific dollar amount that, in his opinion, constituted\nAndrew K.’s net worth. He never mentioned that the information provided to him was,\nor even appeared to be, insufficient to allow him to render an opinion on Andrew K.’s net\nworth and counsel for Lanning never questioned him on the issue. That is sufficient for\nus to determine that there was substantial evidence to support the expert’s net worth\nopinion used by the jury in making its finding. (Ibid.)\n\n\nB. Andrew K.’s Contentions\n       1. Res Judicata Effect of the Judgment of Possession in the UD Action\n       Andrew K. contends that the jury verdict for $236,613.68 against him in the Main\nAction must be reversed, in that the judgment in the UD Action was res judicata on the\nissues of forcible entry and forcible detainer and barred trial on the issues in the Main\nAction. We disagree.\n       In both the Main Action and the UD Action, the Lannings stated causes of action\nagainst Andrew K. for forcible entry and forcible detainer. The sole remedy obtained in\n\n\n\n\n                                             22\n\fthe UD Action was a judgment of possession. The judgment of possession in the UD\nAction did not bar the trial and award on monetary damages in the Main Action.\n       The primary purpose of an unlawful detainer action (Code Civ. Proc., § 1174) is\n“‘“the recovery of the possession of the property. The recovery of rent is a mere incident\nto the main object.”’” (Balassy v. Superior Court (1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 1148, 1152.)\nThe landlord may leave recovery of monetary damages to subsequent litigation. (See\nNorthrop Corp. v. Chaparral Energy, Inc. (1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 725, 729.) The cause\nof action may be the same in two lawsuits, but remedies sought may be different, “‘one\nnot being determinative of the other.’” (Crowley v. Katleman (1994) 8 Cal.4th 666, 682.)\nIn the UD action, judgment was rendered in the forcible entry and forcible detainer cause\nof action only as to the remedy of the right of possession; the issue of damages was not\nlitigated.\n       A judgment operates as res judicata or collateral estoppel in a subsequent action\nonly as to those issues actually litigated. (Clark v. Lesher (1956) 46 Cal.2d 874, 880; 7\nWitkin, Cal. Proc. (4th ed. 1997) Judgment, § 313, p. 864, § 354, p. 915.) Hence, the\njudgment in the UD Action did not bar the trial on the issue of damages for forcible\ndetainer in the Main Action. (Northrop Corp. v. Chaparral Energy, Inc., supra, 168\nCal.App.3d at p. 729.)\n\n\n       2. Emotional Distress Verdict as to Justin L.\n       The jury awarded damages of $10,000 against Andrew K., $1,000 against\nRosalinda K. and $1,000 against Matthew K. for intentional infliction of emotional\ndistress as to Justin L. Andrew K. appeals from the trial court’s denial of his motion for\njudgment notwithstanding verdict on the cause of action. He contends the verdict must\nbe reversed, in that the law does not authorize a cause of action for second-hand\nemotional distress, i.e., Justin L.’s distress due to watching the toll that the litigation took\non his parents.\n\n\n\n\n                                               23\n\f       At the close of direct examination, counsel for the Lannings asked Justin L. to\nbriefly tell why he was asking the jury to award him damages for emotional distress.\nJustin stated: “Primarily, because to see the rapid aging of my parents throughout this\nentire litigation process—it’s beyond drained my family emotionally, financially, and\nphysically. I’ve had the burden of helping to support my family through this. And it’s\nbeen extremely difficult. Also, our quality of life has diminished considerably as a result\nof the horrific acts and . . . the malicious intent by the defendants.”\n       Prior to that brief statement, Justin had testified that, on July 18, 2008, when he\ndiscovered that none of his keys fit the lock to the gate to the Premises, two men who had\nbeen hired by Andrew K. as security personnel were standing near him. He asked them\nwhat was going on. One of them, who was about six feet four inches in height, said to\nJustin in an unfriendly manner that “we’re not going to play this guessing game.” Justin\ntestified that, at that time, he “felt fearful,” “felt a big presence over me” and “felt\nphysically scared.” He called his father, George L., “frantic, stating that our building had\nbeen taken over.” When George arrived, Rosalinda K. and Matthew K. approached, and\nGeorge and Rosalinda got into a heated argument. Four security personnel were present\nand two were videotaping the scene. Justin said that Rosalinda directed one of the\nsecurity personnel to “‘remove George L. from this Premises immediately.’” Justin felt a\nphysical confrontation was about to break out. He was concerned for George because he\nhad bladder cancer and had recently had heart surgery. Justin observed that his small 61-\nyear-old mother, Nansee L., was very nervous and was physically shaking. Justin\ntestified that he “felt scared” and “uncomfortable.” Justin said that he “felt that we were\nbeing bullied,” “there was a menacing presence” and he was “overwhelmed by the\nnumber of people that were against us.” Justin stated that he “was not sure whether or\nnot there was weapons or whatever,” due to the “large security presence and all the\npeople wearing baggy clothing.” When the Lannings first entered the Premises after the\njudgment of possession had been entered in the UD Action, Justin testified that he was\n“personally disgusted” and “felt horrified” at the condition of the Premises.\n\n\n\n                                               24\n\f          The trial court’s “power to grant a judgment notwithstanding the verdict is\nidentical to [its] power to grant a directed verdict.” (Hauter v. Zogarts (1975) 14 Cal.3d\n104, 110.) The trial court “cannot weigh the evidence [citation], or judge the credibility\nof witnesses. [Citation.] If the evidence is conflicting or if several reasonable inferences\nmay be drawn, the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict should be denied.\n[Citations.]” (Ibid.) The trial court may properly grant a motion for judgment\nnotwithstanding the verdict “‘only if it appears from the evidence, viewed in the light\nmost favorable to the party securing the verdict, that there is no substantial evidence to\nsupport the verdict. If there is any substantial evidence, or reasonable inferences to be\ndrawn therefrom, in support of the verdict, the motion should be denied.’ [Citation.]”\n(Ibid.)\n          A plaintiff may recover damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress if\nthe distress is severe, whether or not the plaintiff suffered any physical injury. (Hailey v.\nCalifornia Physicians’ Service (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 452, 476.) Emotional distress is\nsevere if it is “‘of such substantial quantity or enduring quality that no reasonable man in\na civilized society should be expected to endure it,’” including “‘any highly unpleasant\nmental reaction such as fright, grief, shame, humiliation, embarrassment, anger, chagrin,\ndisappointment or worry.’” (Ibid.) However, “[l]iability for intentional infliction of\nemotional distress ‘“does not extend to mere insults, indignities, threats, annoyances,\npetty oppressions, or other trivialities.” [Citation.]’ [Citations.]” (Hughes v. Pair (2009)\n46 Cal.4th 1035, 1051.) “A cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress\nmust allege facts showing outrageous conduct which is intentional or reckless[,] . . .\n‘exceeding all bounds usually tolerated by decent society, of a nature which is especially\ncalculated to cause, and does cause, mental distress of a very serious kind.’ [Citations.]\n. . . Further, although the law appears to be moving toward allowing recovery where\nmental distress is caused when plaintiff witnesses conduct directed toward a third person,\n‘thus far recovery is clearly limited to the most extreme cases of violent attack, where\nthere is some especial likelihood of fright or shock.’ [Citation.]” (Ochoa v. Superior\n\n\n\n                                               25\n\fCourt (1985) 39 Cal.3d 159, 165, fn. 5, italics omitted; accord, Christensen v. Superior\nCourt (1991) 54 Cal.3d 868, 904-905.) Liability for intentional infliction of emotional\ndistress requires “that the defendant’s conduct be directed primarily at the plaintiff\n[which] is a factor which distinguishes intentional infliction of emotional distress from\nthe negligent infliction of such injury,” when the defendant’s conduct is directed\nprimarily at a third person, such as the plaintiff’s child. (Christensen, supra, at p. 904.)\n       We agree with Andrew K. that the emotional distress described by Justin L. is\ninsufficient to constitute the severe emotional distress required as a matter of law for\nliability for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Andrew K. cites Hughes v. Pair,\nsupra, 46 Cal.4th 1035, in which the court affirmed a lower court’s ruling that the\ndefendant was not liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress to the plaintiff\nbased on her claim that she “suffered discomfort, worry, anxiety, upset stomach, concern,\nand agitation as the result of [the] defendant’s [sexually explicit] comments to her” in a\ntelephone call and a brief encounter with him at a museum. (Id. at pp. 1040, 1051.) In\nthe other case Andrew K. cites, Wong v. Jing (2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 1354, the plaintiff\nalleged a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress arising from the\ndefendants’ disparaging posting about her on the Internet. (Id. at p. 1361.) The plaintiff\nsubmitted a declaration stating that the Internet posting “‘was very emotionally upsetting\nto me, and has caused me to lose sleep, have stomach upset and generalized anxiety.’”\n(Id. at p. 1377.) The court concluded that the stated conditions were insufficient to\nconstitute intentional infliction of emotional distress. (Ibid.)\n       Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Justin L., he and his parents\nwere in the immediate presence of persons whom he feared were about to physically\nharm himself and/or his parents and appeared to have the ability to inflict harm. They\nwere telling Justin and his parents in a threatening manner to stay off the Premises and\nforcibly keeping them off property that the Lannings owned by blocking access. The\nconduct Justin L. described may have gone beyond “‘“mere insults, . . . threats, . . . petty\noppressions, or other trivialities.”’” (Hughes v. Pair, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 1051.) The\n\n\n\n                                              26\n\fconduct may have been “‘very emotionally upsetting’” to Justin L. and caused him to\nhave “‘generalized anxiety.’” (Wong v. Jing, supra, 189 Cal.App.4th at p. 1377.)\n       Defendants’ conduct falls short, however, of being “‘of such substantial quantity\nor enduring quality that no reasonable man in a civilized society should be expected to\nendure it.’” (Hailey v. California Physicians’ Service, supra, 158 Cal.App.4th at p. 476.)\nDefendants’ conduct was intentional, but it was not so outrageous as to “‘exceed[] all\nbounds usually tolerated by decent society.’” (Christensen v. Superior Court, supra, 54\nCal.3d at pp. 904-905.) Justin L. may have been justifiably concerned for the well-being\nof his parents. The evidence does not show that defendants engaged in an “‘“extreme\ncase[] of violent attack [on Justin’s parents], where there [was] some especial likelihood\nof fright or shock.”’” (Id. at p. 905.) In the absence of such extreme egregious conduct\ntoward his parents, Justin L. cannot recover for intentional infliction of emotional distress\nbased upon any distress, worry or concern arising from defendants’ conduct toward his\nparents. (Ibid.) We conclude that the verdict is not supported by substantial evidence\nand reasonable inferences drawn from it. The trial court erred in denying Andrew K.’s\nmotion for judgment notwithstanding verdict on Justin L.’s intentional infliction of\nemotional distress claim. (Hauter v. Zogarts, supra, 14 Cal.3d at p. 110.) The judgment\nin Justin L.’s favor based upon liability for intentional infliction of emotional distress on\nhim must be reversed and the associated damages awards against Andrew K., Rosalinda\nK. and Matthew K. must be vacated.\n\n\n                                              II\n                                     NOTE ACTION\n\n\n       Andrew K. filed the Note Action, alleging the Lannings defaulted on the\npromissory note securing the $1 million deposit he paid them toward the purchase of the\nSunset Building while the Main Action was still in progress. The complaint alleged\ncauses of action for breach of the promissory note and money had and received.\n\n\n\n                                             27\n\f       After the jury verdict in the Main Action, the Lannings filed a demurrer in the\nNote Action. The grounds for the demurrer were that Andrew K.’s claims were required\nto be pleaded as a compulsory cross-complaint in the Main Action, and because they\nwere not so pleaded, then pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 426.30,\nsubdivision (a), Andrew K. was barred from raising them in a subsequent action. On that\nbasis, the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend and subsequently\nentered a judgment of dismissal.\n       “On review from an order sustaining a demurrer, ‘we examine the complaint de\nnovo to determine whether it alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any\nlegal theory, such facts being assumed true for this purpose. [Citations.]’ [Citation.]”\n(Committee for Green Foothills v. Santa Clara County Bd. of Supervisors (2010) 48\nCal.4th 32, 42.) When a demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, “we decide\nwhether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment: if it\ncan be, the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse; if not, there has been no\nabuse of discretion and we affirm. [Citations.] The burden of proving such reasonable\npossibility is squarely on the plaintiff. [Citation.]” (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d\n311, 318.) “On appeal from dismissal following a sustained demurrer, we take as true all\nwell-pleaded factual allegations of the complaint. [Citation.]” (Haggis v. City of Los\nAngeles (2000) 22 Cal.4th 490, 495-496.)\n       In his complaint in the Note Action, Andrew K. alleged that in September 2006,\nhe entered into a lease with the Lannings for his use of a portion of the Sunset Building\nfor the Dispensary. In January 2007, he proposed to purchase the Sunset Building from\nthe Lannings and entered into an escrow agreement with them. As the agreement\nrequired, he deposited $600,000 with the Lannings, to be returned to him if he could not\nclose escrow by August 7, 2007. In return, the Lannings executed a promissory note to\nhim as security for the return of his deposit (First Note). Thereafter, the parties entered\ninto a written agreement to increase the deposit to $1 million, amend the First Note\n\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\faccordingly, and extend the date for close of escrow to October 31, 2007. Andrew K.\npaid the Lannings the additional deposit amount.\n        Andrew K. was unable to close escrow by the agreed upon date. The Lannings\nbegan repaying the First Note. As of April 19, 2008, the balance due and payable to\nAndrew K. was $408,000. The Lannings made no payment on the debt after that date.\nWhen the term of the First Note expired, Andrew K. demanded payment from the\nLannings. Rather than paying him, the Lannings gave him a promissory note for\n$408,000, “due and payable by February 28, 2009,” plus a two and a half percent penalty\n(Second Note). The Lannings never made a payment to Andrew K. under the Second\nNote. On April 1, 2010, Andrew K. filed the Note Action to recover under the Second\nNote.\n        Andrew K. contends on appeal that his causes of action based upon the promissory\nnote debt are not related to the transactions being litigated in the Main Action and,\ntherefore, the trial court erred in determining that he was required to raise the causes of\naction in a compulsory cross-complaint in the Main Action. He maintains that the failed\nSunset Building purchase giving rise to the promissory note debt is entirely separate\nfrom, and unrelated to, the dispensary business and lease transactions which are the basis\nfor the causes of action in the Main Action. We disagree.\n        Under Code of Civil Procedure section 426.30, subdivision (a), a defendant must\nallege “any related cause of action which (at the time of serving his answer to the\ncomplaint) he has against the plaintiff” in a cross-complaint and may not subsequently\nassert the related cause of action in another lawsuit. A “‘[r]elated cause of action’” is “a\ncause of action which arises out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of\ntransactions or occurrences as the cause of action which the plaintiff alleges in his\ncomplaint.” (Id., § 426.10, subd. (c).) At any time during the proceedings on the\ncomplaint, a defendant who initially fails to file such a cross-complaint may request leave\nto file the cross-complaint, and the court must grant the request if the defendant “acted in\ngood faith” in failing to file earlier. (Id., § 426.50.) With regard to the compulsory cross-\n\n\n\n                                             29\n\fcomplaint statutes (id., §§ 426.10-426.50), the California Supreme Court explained, “The\nlaw abhors a multiplicity of actions, and the obvious intent of the Legislature in enacting\nthe . . . statutes [citation] was to provide for the settlement, in a single action, of all\nconflicting claims between the parties arising out of the same transaction. [Citation.]\nThus, a party cannot by negligence or design withhold issues and litigate them in\nsuccessive actions; he may not split his demands or defenses; he may not submit his case\nin piecemeal fashion. [Citation.]” (Flickinger v. Swedlow Engineering Co. (1955) 45\nCal.2d 388, 393.)\n       The record reveals that Andrew K. recognized that the causes of action in the\nMain Action were related to those in the Note Action. In support of his motion for\nsummary judgment in the Main Action, Andrew K. submitted a separate statement of\nundisputed facts. Undisputed facts numbered 12 through 18 were the same facts he\nalleged in the Note Action. At the summary judgment hearing, Andrew K. argued that\nthe Lannings did not need to recoup any consideration they paid under the Deal Points\nMemo, because the Lannings already had received money from Andrew K. as his deposit\non the failed purchase of the Sunset Building, and they had not returned it to Andrew K.7\n       Andrew K. asserted the promissory note debt as a defense in the Main Action. In\nhis answers to both the SAC and the TAC, he asserted the promissory note debt as an\naffirmative defense to “offset” to any liability assessed against him in the Main Action.8\nIn addition, in a hearing in the Main Action, Andrew K. asserted the Note Action as the\n\n\n\n\n7      At the summary judgment hearing, Andrew K.’s counsel also orally requested the\ncourt to grant leave for “the opportunity to file a cross-complaint on the basis of the\npromissory note that has recently matured.” The court said that would have to be made\nas a written motion.\n8       Andrew K.’s answers to both the SAC and the TAC asserted as an affirmative\ndefense: “To the extent that any sums are determined to be due and owing to [the\nLannings], and any of them, by . . . Andrew Kramer, . . . Andrew Kramer is entitled to an\noffset in an amount equal to all sums due and owing to [him] by [the Lannings].”\n\n\n                                                30\n\fbasis for his request for a stay of enforcement of the monetary award in favor of the Trust\nin the Main Action.\n       Andrew K. was aware of the possible need to file a cross-complaint in the Main\nAction. In the same hearing at which he asserted the Note Action as reason to stay\nenforcement in the Main Action, the Lannings’ counsel asserted that Andrew K.’s claims\nin the Note Action were related to the Main Action and should be brought as compulsory\ncross-claims in the Main Action. That Andrew K. had considered, but rejected, the cross-\ncomplaint procedure is indicated by the response of his counsel that Andrew K. had\n“elected to pursue those claims separately.” The court denied the requested stay and said\nthat the judgment in the Main Action could possibly provide the basis for issue preclusion\nor res judicata in the Note Action.\n       Cases that Andrew K. discusses do not support his contentions. Rather they\nsupport the applicability of the compulsory cross-complaint in the instant litigation. All\nof the cases involve transactions which the court determined were sufficiently related that\nthe compulsory cross-complaint statute would bar a second lawsuit. (E.g., Hulsey v.\nKoehler (1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 1150, 1154-1156 [first action on escrow instructions and\na deposit receipt and second action on a promissory note for the purchase of a\nmotorhome]; Ranchers Bank v. Pressman (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 612, 615, 621\n[automobile agency purchase involving a promissory note to an individual in the first\naction and a financing agreement with a bank in a second action]; Sylvester v. Soulsburg\n(1967) 252 Cal.App.2d 185, 186-188, 193 [a real estate purchase contract and a chattel\nmortgage as security, with the first action for foreclosure of the chattel mortgage where\nthe defendant buyers answered by alleging fraud and trespass against the sellers and the\nsecond action by the buyers against the sellers for trespass].\n       As support for his claim that no compulsory cross-complaint was required,\nAndrew K. quotes from Align Technology, Inc. v. Tran (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 949 that,\n“‘[a]t the heart of the [logical relationship] approach’” to determining whether a cross-\ncomplaint is compulsory “‘is the question of duplication of time and effort; i.e., are any\n\n\n\n                                             31\n\ffactual or legal issues relevant to both claims? [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (Id. at p. 960.)\nAndrew K. contends that “[t]here is no overlap of relevant facts” and “no claim or\ndefense relevant to the promissory note [which is at issue in the second action] arises\nfrom the parties’ landlord-tenant relationship, nor from their relationship with respect to\noperation of the business [which are at issue in the first action].”\n       Andrew K.’s contention lacks merit, as shown by his use of the promissory note\ndebt in his claims and defenses in the Main Action. As the Align Technology court also\nstated, “Because of the liberal construction given to the [compulsory cross-complaint]\nstatute to accomplish its purpose of avoiding a multiplicity of actions, ‘transaction’ is\nconstrued broadly; it is ‘not confined to a single, isolated act or occurrence . . . but may\nembrace a series of acts or occurrences logically interrelated [citations].’ [Citation.]”\n(Align Technology, Inc. v. Tran, supra, 179 Cal.App.4th at p. 960.) The Note Action\nclearly is barred by Code of Civil Procedure sections 426.10, subdivision (c), and 426.30,\nsubdivision (a).\n       For that reason, Andrew K.’s complaint failed to state a cause of action under any\nlegal theory and the trial court properly sustained the Lannings’ demurrer. (Committee\nfor Green Foothills v. Santa Clara County Bd. of Supervisors, supra, 48 Cal.4th at p. 42.)\nIn view of the statutory bar, there is no reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured\nby amendment and, therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in sustaining the\ndemurrer without leave to amend the complaint in the Note Action. (Blank v. Kirwan,\nsupra, 39 Cal.3d at p. 318.)\n\n\n                                      DISPOSITION\n\n\n       In Lanning v.

(WHCCH), doing business as The Sunset Shop, Inc.\n       The second appeal, No. B231249, is from a 2010 judgment in Kramer v. Lanning,\nLos Angeles County Superior Court, No. SC107434. The plaintiff is Andrew K. The\ndefendants are George L., Nansee L., The Lanning Family Trust, George L. and\nNansee L. as trustees, and The George and Nansee Lanning Revocable Trust, George L.\nand Nansee L. as trustees.1\n\n\n1       The Lanning Family Trust was in effect at the time the events leading to this\nlitigation began, and it was terminated during the course of the litigation between the\n\n                                             2\n\f                             FACTUAL BACKGROUND2\n\n\n       The Lanning Trust owned the commercial building and other real property\ncommonly known as the Sunset Building, at 8919-8923½ West Sunset Boulevard in West\nHollywood. The building has commercial and residential units. In September 2006,\nGeorge L. and Nansee L., as Trustees of the Lanning Trust, entered into a written lease\nwith Andrew K. for a portion of the Sunset Building, specifically 8921, 8923 and 8923½\nWest Sunset Boulevard (Premises)3 for a medical marijuana dispensary known as The\nSunset Shop (Dispensary).\n       In January 2007, Andrew K. and the Trust entered into an escrow agreement for\nAndrew K. to purchase the Sunset Building from the Lanning Trust. Andrew K. paid the\nTrust a $1 million deposit to be returned if the purchase did not close by a specified date.\nThe Lanning Trust gave Andrew K. two promissory notes, one for $600,000 and another\nfor $400,000, to secure repayment of the deposit to Andrew K. The purchase did not\nclose, and the parties cancelled the agreement.\n       In September 2007, George L. sent Andrew K. a letter offering to purchase the\nDispensary for a purchase price of $1,450,000 plus $300,000 for inventory. In November\nor December, Andrew K. and George L. with Nansee L. executed a term sheet entitled\nDeal Points as of 11/7 (Deal Points Memo). The Deal Points Memo included various\n\n\n\n\nparties. The George and Nansee Lanning Revocable Trust was formed and remained in\neffect at the time the judgments at issue herein were entered. For convenience, we refer\nto the trusts as the Lanning Trust or the Trust.\n2      Additional factual background appears in the discussion, post, in conjunction with\nthe issue on appeal to which the background relates.\n3      Andrew K. subsequently surrendered possession of the unit at 8923 West Sunset\nBoulevard in December 2007, when George L. took over the unit to serve as his\nresidence.\n\n\n                                             3\n\fdollar amounts, descriptive phrases and dates, but no sentences or paragraphs tying them\ntogether.\n       In late December 2007, George L., Nansee L. and Justin L. took over operation of\nthe Dispensary. They received all revenues from its operation. Andrew K. remained\ninvolved, and the Lannings paid him a consulting fee. On July 15, 2008, the Lannings\nmet with Andrew K. and informed him the consulting arrangement was terminated.\n       On July 17, 2008, before the Lannings arrived to open the Dispensary for business,\nAndrew K. had the locks on the Premises changed, took over the Premises and had his\nmother, Rosalinda K., his son, Matthew K., and security personnel come to the Premises.\nThe Lannings were not allowed to enter the Premises; they were confronted and warned\nto leave by members of the Kramer group. Justin L. called law enforcement for\nassistance. When the sheriff’s deputies arrived, Rosalinda K. told the deputies that the\nKramers had the right to be on the Premises and showed them a copy of the Lease. The\ndeputies declined to take further action on the basis that the dispute was a civil matter.\nMembers of the Kramer group entered the residence of George L. and took property the\nLannings used in operating the Dispensary.\n       The Lannings initiated litigation against the Kramers as more fully explained\nbelow. The Kramers subsequently initiated action against them. As a result of a\njudgment of possession entered in favor of the Lannings in one of the actions, on June 8,\n2009, the Lannings regained possession of the Premises and the Kramers and related\nbusiness entities vacated the Premises.\n\n\n                           PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n\n       The Lannings filed their complaint in Lanning v. Kramer (Super. Ct. L.A. County,\n2010, No. SC099461) on August 19, 2008 (Main Action). On September 2, 2008,\nGeorge L., as trustee for the Lanning Trust, filed an unlawful detainer action against\n\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\fAndrew K. (Lanning v. Kramer (Super. Ct. L.A. County, 2009, No. 08U02832)) (UD\nAction).\n       The Lannings filed their Second Amended Complaint (SAC) in the Main Action\non September 4, 2009. Three causes of action related to the Kramers’ conduct in retaking\nand retaining possession of the Premises from July 18, 2008 to June 8, 2009: forcible\nentry and forcible detainer of the Premises (second), trespass (third), and intentional\ninfliction of emotional distress (fourth). Five of the causes of action arose from the\nalleged agreement by Andrew K. to sell the Dispensary and its inventory to the Lannings\n(Sale Agreement). The causes of action alleged Andrew K.’s breach of the agreement to\nsell the Dispensary to the Lannings (first) and, for the period of forcible detainer,\n“intentional interference with contractual relations with the Sunset Shop’s customers”\n(fifth), “conversion of the Sunset shop and all its inventory and business equipment”\n(sixth), “an accounting of the Sunset Shop’s drug revenue” (seventh), and “a constructive\ntrust of the Lannings’ estimate of the profits of the marijuana dispensary” (eighth). The\nLannings also alleged, for the duration of the detainer period, breach of an implied-in-fact\nlease agreement against Andrew K. for rent and damage to the Premises (ninth), and\nunjust enrichment from Andrew K.’s Dispensary operation during the forcible detainer\nperiod (tenth).\n       The Lannings requested relief as follows: a sum in excess of $13,500,000 in\ngeneral damages, including, inter alia, revenues the Lannings lost from the sale of\nmedical marijuana as the result of Andrew K.’s forcible detainer and revenues Andrew K.\ncollected from the sales during forcible detainer, punitive damages for the intentional\ntorts, and attorney’s fees and costs.\n       In the UD Action, the trial court issued a judgment of possession to George L., as\ntrustee of the Lanning Trust, in April 2009. The judgment was enforced and, on June 8,\n2009, the Lannings took possession of the Premises from the Kramers.\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f       In January 2010, Andrew K. filed a motion for summary judgment in the Main\nAction seeking dismissal of the SAC. The trial court granted the motion for summary\njudgment as to the first, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth causes of action.4\n       The trial court found that the alleged Sale Agreement was void, in that the terms\nwere too uncertain and vague to be enforceable. The court continued that, even if the\nagreement were sufficiently certain, it would be unenforceable, in that it would be\nunlawful under the federal Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. §§ 812, 841(a)(1), 844).\nThe court found that the “performance of this agreement to buy/sell a marijuana\ndispensary and $300,000 worth of inventory . . . would require the transfer of possession\nof marijuana, a controlled substance . . . with the intent to distribute that” marijuana. The\ncourt noted that marijuana is identified as a “controlled substance” subject to the Act. (21\nU.S.C. §§ 802(6), (16) & 812(c), Schedule I, (c)(10).) The court stated that California’s\n“Proposition 215 does not conflict with the Controlled Substances Act because in passing\nProposition 215, California has merely exercised its state powers not to punish certain\nmarijuana offenses under state law when a doctor has recommended its use to treat a\nmedical condition.” If the dispensary sale transaction were legal under California law,\naccording to the court, that “does not change the fact [that] under federal law, any\nperson’s knowing and intentional acts ‘to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess\nwith intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance’ [such as\nmarijuana] are unlawful. 21 USC § 841(a)(1); see also 21 USC [§] 844(a).”\n       The Lannings then filed a third amended complaint (TAC) pursuant to the trial\ncourt’s grant of leave to amend, to add the Lanning Trust as a named plaintiff and remove\nthe former first, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth causes of action. The Lannings’\nremaining causes of action were for forcible entry and detainer (first), trespass (second),\n\n\n4      The parties refer to the trial court’s ruling as a partial summary judgment.\nTechnically, it was a summary adjudication of the specified causes of action. (Code Civ.\nProc., § 437c, subd. (f)(1).) We nonetheless refer to the “summary judgment” for\npurposes of this appeal.\n\n\n                                               6\n\fintentional infliction of emotional distress (third), breach of implied in fact contract (lease\nagreement) (fourth) and unjust enrichment (fifth). In paragraph 74, the Lannings\nexpanded the list of ways Andrew K. had been unjustly enriched to include (a) money\nthey paid Andrew K. prior to December 26, 2007, (b) money they paid to Andrew K.\nbetween December 26, 2007 and July 17, 2008, the period the Lannings operated the\nDispensary, and (c) the benefits Andrew K. obtained while operating the Dispensary\nduring the forcible detainer period.\n       Andrew K. moved to strike newly added portions of the TAC, except the addition\nof the Trust as a named plaintiff. After a hearing on the motion to strike, the trial court\ngranted the motion to strike as to certain additions, including but not limited to, the\nsources listed as unjustly enriching Andrew K. in paragraph 74, items (a), (b) and (c)\ninsofar as (c) sought net profits from Andrew K.’s operating the Dispensary during the\nforcible detainer period. At the hearing, the court also ruled on the Lannings’ motion for\nleave to amend to add the new portions to the TAC. The requested amendments sought,\ninter alia, restitution of purchase money paid to Andrew K. pursuant to the alleged Sale\nAgreement as well as restitution of any benefits, including net profits, obtained by\nAndrew K. from operating the Dispensary during the forcible detainer period. The trial\ncourt denied leave to amend “insofar as any claim is added which essentially revives any\npart of the contract claims which the court previously stated it would not enforce. That\nincludes the claims for rescission of the agreement to purchase the dispensary, claims for\ndamages arising from operation of the dispensary, and legal fees to resolve disputes with\nthe City of West Hollywood over the operations of the dispensary.”\n       In April 2010, Andrew K. filed suit against the Lannings, alleging they had not\nrepaid in full the two promissory notes the Lannings gave as security for the $1 million\ndeposit he paid them in seeking to purchase the Sunset Building in 2007 (Andrew Kramer\nv. George Lanning et al., 2010, L.A. Super. Ct. case No. SC107434) (Note Action).\nAndrew K. alleged the Lannings still owed him $408,000 on the second note.\n\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\f        The Main Action was tried before a jury in June 2010. In a prior proceeding, the\ncourt had found that Andrew K. committed a forcible entry and forcible detainer of the\nPremises, beginning on July 18, 2008. The jury rendered its verdict on June 23, 2010,\nfinding that Rosalinda K., Michael K. and the remaining Kramer defendants committed a\nforcible entry and forcible detainer. On this cause of action, the jury awarded damages of\n$236,613.68 against Andrew K. and $600 each against the other defendants. The jury\nfound the Kramer defendants committed a trespass and awarded damages of $23,286.75\nagainst Andrew K. and $75.88 each against the other defendants. The jury found\nAndrew K. was liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress, with damages of\n$25,000 to George L. and damages of $10,000 each to Nansee L. and Justin L. It also\nfound Rosalinda K. and Matthew K. liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress\nand assessed damages against Rosalinda K. and Matthew K. each for $1,000 for each of\nthe three Lannings.\n        The jury also found Andrew K. was entitled to a set off in the amount of his\nsecurity deposit, $23,210.87. The jury found by clear and convincing evidence that\nAndrew K., WHCCH, and The Sunset Shop, Inc. acted with malice, oppression, or fraud,\nand accordingly, the Lannings were entitled to punitive damages. However, the jury did\nnot assess any such damages.\n        The Lannings filed a motion for a new trial on damages only. The Kramers filed a\nmotion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The trial court denied both motions.\nJudgment and notice of entry of judgment were issued in the Main Action on July 16,\n2010.\n        In the Note Action, the trial court sustained the Lannings’ demurrer without leave\nto amend. On December 29, 2010, the trial court entered a judgment of dismissal of the\nNote Action.\n\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f                                        DISCUSSION\n\n\n                                               I\n                                      MAIN ACTION\n\n\nA. The Lannings’ Contentions\n       1. Summary Judgment as to the Causes of Action Related to the Alleged Sale\n       Agreement\n       The Lannings contend that the trial court erred in granting Andrew K.’s motion for\nsummary judgment as to their causes of action for breach of the alleged Sale Agreement,\nintentional interference with contractual relations, conversion, accounting and a\nconstructive trust. Specifically, the Lannings claim the trial court erred in ruling that the\nalleged Sale Agreement was unlawful pursuant to the federal Controlled Substances Act\n(21 U.S.C. §§ 812, 841(a)(1), 844), that by law, an illegal contract/transaction may not be\nthe basis of an action and, therefore, each of the causes of action was subject to summary\njudgment, given that existence of a valid sale agreement was an essential element of each\nof them.\n       We review a trial court’s grant of a summary judgment motion de novo.

Code of Civil Procedure\nsection 437c, subdivision (c), provides that a “motion for summary judgment shall be\ngranted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material\nfact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”\n       Initially, a moving defendant has the “burden of showing that a cause of action has\nno merit,” such as by showing “that one or more elements of the causes of action . . .\ncannot be established,” or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.

The court then invited argument on its\ntentative conclusion that the agreement was void and unenforceable because of its\nvagueness and uncertainty as to the parties’ actual agreement.\n       The court found the alleged Sale Agreement, the Deal Points Memo, “was\nincomprehensible . . . . It might be a contract, but, at the same time, it might be a\nshopping list.” There followed brief argument by counsel that the agreement had been\npartially performed and its terms could be determined from the performance shown by\nrecords submitted as exhibits to their supporting declarations. The court found that there\nremained questions about the authenticity of the documents purported to be records of\npayments under the agreement. Ultimately, the trial court adopted its tentative decision\nas its final written decision. It found that “the contract at issue here, it is ‘so vaguely\nexpressed as to be wholly unascertainable’ and is therefore void. Civ[il] Code [section]\n1598.” It then went on to address the illegality issue, finding that, in any event, the\nagreement was illegal and unenforceable.\n       On appeal, the Lannings do not challenge the trial court’s determination that the\nalleged Sale Agreement was void for uncertainty and vagueness. The record reveals this\nwas not an inadvertent oversight, but rather the Lannings chose to challenge only the\ncourt’s determination of the agreement’s illegality. In their reply brief, for example, they\nassert that the determination the agreement was void for uncertainty and vagueness “is\ninconsequential” to their appeal. Where an appellant does not contend the trial court\nerred in making a determination, the appellant forfeits any claims concerning that\ndetermination. (Quinn v.

The Lannings therefore forfeited any\nclaim of error with respect to the trial court’s determination that the alleged Sale\nAgreement was void for uncertainty and vagueness.\n       Andrew K. maintains that the trial court properly determined that the alleged Sale\nAgreement was void for uncertainty and vaguenesss, and that was a sufficient basis for\nthe court to grant his motion for summary judgment.

George L. sent Andrew K. a letter entitled “‘Offer\nTo Purchase’ the Dispensary . . . for a ‘Purchase Price’ totaling $1,450,000 and for\n$300,000 for ‘Inventory.’” There is no signed acceptance of the offer by Andrew K. The\nparties acknowledge that part of their agreement was the two-page Deal Points Memo.\nTheir separate statements of undisputed facts reveals that the parties did not even agree\non what the object was of the Deal Points Memo. According to the Lannings, Andrew K.\nagreed to sell them the Dispensary. According to Andrew K., he agreed to grant them a\nlicense to operate the Dispensary, contingent upon their satisfaction of certain\nconditions.5\n       The Deal Points Memo was not in the form of a written contract and was virtually\ndevoid of complete sentences. There were dates, dollar amounts and cryptic phrases\nalongside the amounts, but no indication regarding, for example, who was required to pay\nor entitled to receive the dollar amounts, when payment was to be made or what the\npayment entitled the recipient to do or own. The memo states “300,000.00 owed for\n\n\n5       In their separate statements of undisputed facts, Andrew K. stated that the Deal\nPoints Memo was a “term-sheet . . . outlining the circumstances under which [the\nLannings] would operate the Dispensary.” The Lannings stated that it “outlined the terms\nof the sale of the Dispensary to the Lannings.”\n\n\n                                              12\n\fremainder,” with no identification of what “remainder” is intended or the person\nresponsible for payment or entitled to receive payment. There are references to “Loan\ntaken over” and “Loan Payment,” but no identification of the loan or its purpose. The\nmemo states “1,850,000.00 Total Sale for home,” but includes no description, legal or by\naddress, of the “home” or identity of the buyer or the seller. There is a handwritten note\nunder the heading “Payment Schedule” which states “$10,000/wk salary until <business>\npaid in full,” but no named recipient or even what “business” must be “paid in full.”\n       According to the Lannings, other terms of the parties’ alleged Sale Agreement\nwere implied from the conduct of the parties after they executed the Deal Points Memo.\nAs evidence of the conduct, the Lannings provided sets of handwritten documents\ndescribed as ledgers, which purportedly were evidence of their payments and debts to\nAndrew K. under the alleged Sale Agreement. However, the handwritten ledgers were\nalso so vague as to be incomprehensible as evidence of the terms and conditions of the\nalleged Sale Agreement. Each ledger set forth a brief caption, a column of dates (many\nwith no year designation), a corresponding column of dollar amounts and, in most cases,\nanother column of dollar amounts which sometimes was marked as the balance column.6\nIn some cases, there were additional columns, such as initials or what appeared to be a\nname of a particular type of medical marijuana.\n       The alleged Sale Agreement lacks clarity and is so vague as to render indiscernible\nthe elements necessary to formation of a contract, that is, the persons contracting, the\nobject of the contract, price or other consideration, time payment is due, or consent by all\nparties to any such terms and conditions necessary for the enforcement of the agreement.\n(Civ. Code, § 1550; King v. Stanley, supra, 32 Cal.2d at p. 589.) The trial court properly\ndetermined that, as a matter of law, the alleged Sale Agreement was “so uncertain and\nindefinite that the intention of the parties in material particulars cannot be ascertained”\n\n6     The captions on the handwritten ledgers were “Cash for Inventory,” “Checks Recd\nInventory,” “Inventory Fronted,” “Purchases,” “Drew Purchases,” “Cash Recd for\nBusiness,” “Business [unintelligible],” and “Loan.”\n\n\n                                             13\n\fand, as a result the agreement was void and unenforceable. (Cal. Lettuce Growers v.\nUnion Sugar Co., supra, 45 Cal.2d at p. 481.)\n       The existence of the alleged Sale Agreement was an essential element to the\nLannings’ first, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth causes of action in the SAC. Andrew K.\nmet his burden of showing that the Lannings could not establish the essential element, in\nthat the Lannings did not possess, and could not reasonably obtain, evidence needed to\nprove the existence of the alleged Sale Agreement. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subds. (o),\n(p)(2); Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co., supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp. 854-855.) The Lannings\nhave failed to meet their burden to show a triable issue of material fact exists with regard\nto the enforceability of the alleged Sale Agreement. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c,\nsubd. (p)(2); Aguilar, supra, at p. 849.) For these reasons, as a matter of law, Kramer\nwas entitled to the grant of his motion for summary judgment as to the first, fifth, sixth,\nseventh and eighth causes of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c); Kahn v. East\nSide Union High School Dist. (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2598318\"><a href=\"/opinion/2598318/kahn-v-east-side-union-high-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">990</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1002-1003.)\n       Inasmuch as the alleged Sale Agreement was in any event void for vagueness and\nuncertainty, we need not reach the Lannings’ contention that the trial court erred in\nfinding the alleged agreement was void for illegality. The result would be the same.\n\n\n       2. Preclusion of Restitution Damages for Consideration Paid for Dispensary\n       As part of the changes to the TAC, the Lannings amended their unjust enrichment\ncause of action (fifth) to seek restitution of the consideration they paid Andrew K. for the\nDispensary as well as disgorgement of Andrew K.’s profits from the Dispensary during\nthe forcible detainer period. As we noted previously, in paragraph 74 in the fifth cause of\naction, the Lannings expanded the list of ways Andrew K. had been unjustly enriched to\ninclude (a) money they paid Andrew K. prior to December 26, 2007, (b) money they paid\nAndrew K. between December 26, 2007 and July 17, 2008, the period the Lannings\noperated the Dispensary, and (c) the benefits Andrew K. obtained while operating the\nDispensary during the forcible detainer period.\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\f       The Lannings contend that the trial court erred in granting Andrew K.’s motion to\nstrike the additions. The Lannings argue that the court’s comment that restitution\ndamages were not recoverable, in that determination of them required reference to the\nvoid Sale Agreement, was not supported by the law of unjust enrichment. They cite\ncases in which some part of a contract was void as illegal, precluding damages based on\nbreach of contract, but the plaintiff was deemed entitled to equitable relief, i.e.,\nrestitution, “for any amounts he may have expended in [the] performance of the\nagreement.” (Dunkin v. Boskey (2000) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The equitable doctrine of unjust enrichment “applies where the\nplaintiffs, while having no enforceable contract, nonetheless have conferred a benefit on\nthe defendant which the defendant has knowingly accepted under circumstances that\nmake it inequitable for the defendant to retain the benefit without paying for its value.\n[Citation.]” (Hernandez, supra, at p. 938.)\n       We turn our focus, however, to the court’s initial statement that, in prior\nproceedings on cross-motions for summary judgment, the court gave the Lannings “leave\nto amend the complaint as to the causes of action for forcible detainer, trespass, and\nunjust enrichment . . . to name the [T]rust as a plaintiff. The Lannings filed a [TAC] . . .\nin which the Lannings have done so. However, . . . the Lannings did not stop there, and\nhave added various words and phrases throughout the TAC. . . . [M]ost of the changes\n. . . are changes concomitant with the addition of a named plaintiff and update the TAC\nwith developments in this case since the SAC was filed . . . . Such amendments are\npermissible because they merely respond to the court’s reason for granting leave to\namend. . . . The Lannings have not sought, and the court did not previously grant, leave\nfor the Lannings to add any new claims for damages in the complaint . . . .” The court\nnoted that, for that reason, it was inclined to strike “[e]verything in the TAC ¶74 . . .\nexcept the language ‘Kramer, WHCCH and SSI have been unjustly enriched as a result of\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\fthe conduct alleged above by failing to pay rent to the Trust from July 18, 2008 to June 8,\n2009. In addition, Kramer, WHCCH and SSI caused over $75,000 in damage[s] to the\nunits in which the Sunset Shop operated while they forcibly detained the same.”\n       We agree that the Lannings’ additional claims for unjust enrichment went far\nbeyond the limited scope of the leave to amend to add the Trust as a named plaintiff.\n(See Patrick v. Alacer Corp. (2008)167 Cal.App.4th 995, 1015 [plaintiff’s amendment\nadding a new cause of action was permissible, in that it was within the specified scope of\nthe trial court’s grant of leave to amend]; People ex rel.

The Lannings had not obtained leave to amend through a noticed motion for\nleave to amend before filing the TAC with the added material, as required pursuant to\nCode of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (a)(1). (Lee v. Bank of America (1994)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2296014\"><a href=\"/opinion/2296014/lee-v-bank-of-america-national-trust-and-savings-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rather they sought leave to amend as a way to\noppose Andrew K.’s motion to strike.\n       The general policy of liberality in granting leave to amend does not apply where\nthe cause of action or the issues involved in it are “radically changed,” or the amendment\nwould “operate to the disadvantage or prejudice of the adverse party.” (Price v. Mason-\nMcDuffie Co. (1942) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">320</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 325-326.) An amendment should not require a\ndefendant “to answer a wholly different legal liability or obligation from that originally\nstated.” (Klopstock v.

The trial court did not\nabuse its discretion in refusing to grant leave to amend with regard to the cause of action\n(fifth) for unjust enrichment.\n\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\f       3. Use of Andrew K.’s Special Verdict Form; Joint and Severable Liability\n       for Intentional Torts\n       The Lannings contend that the trial court erred in submitting Andrew K.’s special\nverdict form, which required the jury to specify the amount of damages attributable to\neach Kramer defendant if the jury found them liable, to the jury and in rejecting all their\nobjections. They claim that, by law, all of the Kramer defendants must be held jointly\nand separately liable for the total amount of damages assessed by the jury for the\nintentional torts. According to the Lannings, allowing such apportionment abrogated the\nprinciple of joint and several liability of all of the tortfeasors who conspire to commit the\nsame tort.\n       The Lannings cite Hughey v. Candoli (1958) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1267144\"><a href=\"/opinion/1267144/hughey-v-candoli/\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> as support for\ntheir contention, but that case also supports the use of a special verdict form allowing the\njury to state the amount of damages caused by each defendant, as Andrew K.’s form did.\nThe Hughey court stated that, generally, “‘“[w]here several persons act in concert and\ndamages result from their joint tort, each person is held for the entire damages . . . ,”’”\nand the same result applies even if persons are not acting in concert, but “‘“the results\nproduced by their acts are indivisible,”’” such as “‘“[d]eath, burning of a building or the\nsinking of a boat . . . .”’” (Id. at p. 240.) The court also stated, however, that if\n“‘“segregation as to causation can be established,”’” each tortfeasor bears “‘the burden of\nestablishing that his own wrong did not contribute to the damages, or the extent to which\nit did so.’” (Ibid.) In the instant case, the jury apparently decided that each Kramer\ndefendant met that burden and specified the damages against each defendant accordingly.\n       The facts do not support the Lannings’ claim that the torts produced indivisible\nresults requiring that defendants be held jointly and severally liable for all damages. (See\nHughey v. Candoli, supra, 159 Cal.App.2d at p. 240.) The torts were not single discrete\nevents, but rather they continued over a long period of time. For the duration of the\nforcible entry and forcible detainer, Andrew K. was present virtually every day, but\nRosalinda K. and Matthew K. were not.\n\n\n\n                                              17\n\f       As Andrew K. points out, the jury was instructed as to the indivisibility of\ndamages caused by defendants if they acted as members of a conspiracy in carrying out\nthe tortious conduct. At the Lannings’ request, the trial court instructed the jury on the\nelements required to find a conspiracy (CACI No. 3600), as well as the indivisibility of\nthe damages caused by a conspiracy (CACI No. 3601, also D-9). The court stated: “If\nyou decide that defendants join the conspiracy to commit the torts . . . , then they are\nresponsible for all acts done as part of the conspiracy, whether they occurred before or\nafter they join the conspiracy.”\n       The Lannings’ special verdict form did not request a specific finding as to\nconspiracy. The form only had one line for entry of damages. The court rejected the\nLannings’ form, reasoning that the form did not allow for the possibility of the jury\nfinding that the Kramer defendants did not act in a conspiracy and needing spaces for\nspecification of the amount of damages as to each defendant. As the Lannings observed\nin their opening brief, “[b]ecause the apportionments [in the final verdict] were different\n[for each Kramer defendant], the only conclusion that reconciles the apportionment is\nthat the jury concluded that there was no conspiracy amongst defendants.” The trial\ncourt did not err in permitting use of Andrew K.’s special verdict form.\n\n\n       4. “Tort of Another” Attorney’s Fees\n       In the TAC, the Lannings amended their prayer for attorney’s fees to include fees\nauthorized by “the ‘tort of another’ doctrine.” The jury found that Andrew K., Rosalinda\nK., and Matthew K. had committed the tort of forcible entry and forcible detainer of the\nPremises. Among other things, the evidence showed that, on the day of their forcible\nentry, Rosalinda K. and Matthew K. spoke to the sheriff’s deputies who responded to the\nLannings’ telephone call for help, and Rosalinda K. showed them a copy of the Lease\nbetween the Lannings and Andrew K. Upon seeing the Lease, a deputy said that the\nsituation appeared to be a civil matter, and the deputies left. Thereafter, the Lannings\nfiled the UD Action against Andrew K. to regain possession of the Premises. The\n\n\n\n                                             18\n\fLannings sought to recover the attorney’s fees they expended in the UD Action from\nRosalinda K. and Matthew K. as damages in the Main Action under the “tort of another”\ndoctrine. The trial court ruled that the doctrine did not apply.\n       On appeal, the Lannings claim the court erred, and the doctrine did apply. The\ngist of the Lannings’ argument is that, but for the wrongful conduct of Rosalinda K. and\nMatthew K. in representing to the sheriff’s deputies that they and Andrew K. had a legal\nright to be in possession of the Premises under the Lease, the Lannings would not have\nhad to file and prosecute the UD Action. Therefore, the Lannings assert, they are entitled\nto recover their attorney’s fees and costs in the UD Action from Rosalind K. and\nMatthew K. as damages for their wrongful conduct under the “tort of another” doctrine.\n       The general rule in tort actions is that the party who employs the attorney pays the\nattorney’s fees, in the absence of some special agreement, statutory provision, or\nexceptional circumstances. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1021; Prentice v. North Amer. Title\nGuar. Corp. (1963) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">618</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 620.) The “tort of another” doctrine arises in the\nexceptional circumstances when a “person who through the tort of another has been\nrequired to act in the protection of his interests by bringing or defending an action against\na third person.” (Prentice, supra, at p. 620.) In such circumstances, the person “is\nentitled to recover compensation for the reasonably necessary loss of time, attorney’s\nfees, and other expenditures . . . suffered or incurred” in the action against the third\nperson. (Ibid.)\n       Under the “tort of another” doctrine, attorney’s fees are awarded as one element of\ndamages suffered by the plaintiff who was required to sue a third person to protect his\nrights as “the natural and proximate consequence” of the torts committed against the\nplaintiff by the defendant; the attorney’s fees are not “‘the measure and mode of\ncompensation of attorneys’” governed by Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.\n(Prentice v. North Amer. Title Guar. Corp., supra, 59 Cal.2d at p. 621; see also Gray v.\nDon Miller & Associates, Inc. (1984) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1247885\"><a href=\"/opinion/1247885/gray-v-don-miller-associates-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">498</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 505, 507 [a plaintiff may recover\nattorney’s fees “if he is required to employ counsel to prosecute or defend an action\n\n\n\n                                              19\n\fagainst a third party because of the tort of defendant”]; Behniwal v.

App. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 79.)\n       Because the attorney’s fees awarded under the “tort of another” doctrine are “in\nfact an element of tort damages, nearly all of the cases which have applied the doctrine\ninvolve a clear violation of a traditional tort duty between the tortfeasor who is required\nto pay the attorney fees and the person seeking compensation for those fees. [Citations.]”\n(Sooy v. Peter (1990) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2143297\"><a href=\"/opinion/2143297/sooy-v-peter/\"><span class=\"volume\">220</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1305</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1310.) The “tort of another” doctrine does\nnot apply, however, “to the situation where a plaintiff has been damaged by the joint\nnegligence of codefendants.” (Gorman v. Tassajara Development Corp., supra, 178\nCal.App.4th at p. 80.) The doctrine, as set forth in Prentice v. North Amer. Title Guar.\nCorp., supra, 59 Cal.2d at pages 620 and 621, “‘was not intended to apply to one of\nseveral joint tortfeasors in order to justify additional attorney fee damages. If that were\nthe rule there is no reason why it could not be applied in every multiple tortfeasor case\nwith the plaintiff simply choosing the one with the deepest pocket as the “Prentice\ntarget.” Such a result would be a total emasculation of Code of Civil Procedure\nsection 1021 in tort cases.’” (Gorman, supra, at p. 80.)\n       The trial court properly ruled that the Lannings were not entitled to attorney’s fees\nas “tort of another” damages against Rosalinda K. and/or Matthew K. The TAC alleges\nthat “[b]ecause of the forcible entry and detainer of the Premises by Matthew Kramer,\nRosalinda Kramer and their security personnel, the Lannings were forced to retain\ncounsel and cause the Trust to commence a lawsuit [as] an unlawful detainer action\nagainst Andrew Kramer to reclaim possession of the Premises.” The Lannings did not\nplead any “tort of another” damages against Rosalinda K. and Matthew K. (Gorman v.\nTassajara Development Corp., supra, 178 Cal.App.4th at p. 79.) The TAC alleges that\nall three—Rosalinda K., Matthew K. and Andrew K.—were joint tortfeasors. (Id. at\n\n\n\n                                             20\n\fp. 80.) The Lannings did not institute the unlawful detainer action against only Andrew\nK. solely as “the natural and proximate consequence” of the torts of Rosalinda K. and\nMatthew K. (Prentice v. North Amer. Title Guar. Corp., supra, 59 Cal.2d at p. 621.)\nThus, the “tort of another” doctrine could not, and did not, apply.\n\n\n       5. The Lannings’ Motion for Retrial on Damages Only\n       The Lannings contend the trial court erred in denying their motion for a new trial\non damages only. The Lannings do not challenge any of the jury’s findings on liability.\nWhen the court denies a new trial, we “conduct an independent examination of the\nproceedings to determine whether a miscarriage of justice occurred.” (People v. Ault\n(2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2597585\"><a href=\"/opinion/2597585/people-v-ault/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1250</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1261-1262, fn. omitted; Cal. Const., art. 6, § 13.)\n       First the Lannings contend that, as their foregoing claims show, the manner in\nwhich the jury answered the special verdict questions on damages is unclear and may be\nthe result of error. As we previously concluded, there was no error.\n       The Lannings also claim that retrial on the amount of punitive damages is\nwarranted, in that Andrew K. failed to provide sufficient information to allow the\nLannings’ financial expert to offer evidence of Kramer’s current net worth for the jury’s\nconsideration in determining the amount of punitive damages to award. The expert was\nScott Mowrey, a certified public accountant. He testified that he had received the 2006\nand 2007 tax returns for Andrew K., together with some supporting documents and\npartial statements from brokerage accounts. Mowrey stated the dollar amount, in his\nopinion, of Andrew K.’s net worth.\n       During the hearing on punitive damages, counsel for the Lannings never raised an\nobjection, or even mentioned, that the financial information made available to Mowrey\nwas insufficient for the purpose of assessing Andrew K.’s net worth. Counsel was not\ncaught by surprise, however; he had the opportunity to become aware of the alleged\ninsufficiency prior to the hearing. According to his declaration, the court permitted\ncounsel for the Lannings to meet with Mowrey and review the financial information\n\n\n\n                                            21\n\fprovided by Andrew K. during a break prior to the start of the hearing. By failing to\nmake a timely objection, the Lannings forfeited any error with respect to the punitive\ndamages procedure, including any failure by Andrew K. to provide sufficient financial\ninformation for the determination of his net worth. (See, e.g., City of El Monte v.\nSuperior Court (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2255602\"><a href=\"/opinion/2255602/city-of-el-monte-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 280 [plaintiff forfeited objection to punitive\ndamages procedure by failing to object before jury was discharged].)\n       In any event, substantial evidence would support a finding that the information\nwas sufficient. When a plaintiff attacks the sufficiency of the evidence to support the\ntrier of fact’s finding, our power on appeal “‘begins and ends with the determination as to\nwhether there is any substantial evidence contradicted or uncontradicted which will\nsupport the finding of fact.’ [Citations.]” (Foreman & Clark Corp. v. Fallon (1971) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1158810\"><a href=\"/opinion/1158810/foreman-clark-corp-v-fallon/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">875</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 881, italics omitted.) The Lannings’ financial expert identified the evidence\nprovided to him and stated the specific dollar amount that, in his opinion, constituted\nAndrew K.’s net worth. He never mentioned that the information provided to him was,\nor even appeared to be, insufficient to allow him to render an opinion on Andrew K.’s net\nworth and counsel for Lanning never questioned him on the issue. That is sufficient for\nus to determine that there was substantial evidence to support the expert’s net worth\nopinion used by the jury in making its finding. (Ibid.)\n\n\nB. Andrew K.’s Contentions\n       1. Res Judicata Effect of the Judgment of Possession in the UD Action\n       Andrew K. contends that the jury verdict for $236,613.68 against him in the Main\nAction must be reversed, in that the judgment in the UD Action was res judicata on the\nissues of forcible entry and forcible detainer and barred trial on the issues in the Main\nAction. We disagree.\n       In both the Main Action and the UD Action, the Lannings stated causes of action\nagainst Andrew K. for forcible entry and forcible detainer. The sole remedy obtained in\n\n\n\n\n                                             22\n\fthe UD Action was a judgment of possession. The judgment of possession in the UD\nAction did not bar the trial and award on monetary damages in the Main Action.\n       The primary purpose of an unlawful detainer action (Code Civ. Proc., § 1174) is\n“‘“the recovery of the possession of the property. The recovery of rent is a mere incident\nto the main object.”’” (Balassy v. Superior Court (1986) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Emotional Distress Verdict as to Justin L.\n       The jury awarded damages of $10,000 against Andrew K., $1,000 against\nRosalinda K. and $1,000 against Matthew K. for intentional infliction of emotional\ndistress as to Justin L. Andrew K. appeals from the trial court’s denial of his motion for\njudgment notwithstanding verdict on the cause of action. He contends the verdict must\nbe reversed, in that the law does not authorize a cause of action for second-hand\nemotional distress, i.e., Justin L.’s distress due to watching the toll that the litigation took\non his parents.\n\n\n\n\n                                               23\n\f       At the close of direct examination, counsel for the Lannings asked Justin L. to\nbriefly tell why he was asking the jury to award him damages for emotional distress.\nJustin stated: “Primarily, because to see the rapid aging of my parents throughout this\nentire litigation process—it’s beyond drained my family emotionally, financially, and\nphysically. I’ve had the burden of helping to support my family through this. And it’s\nbeen extremely difficult. Also, our quality of life has diminished considerably as a result\nof the horrific acts and . . . the malicious intent by the defendants.”\n       Prior to that brief statement, Justin had testified that, on July 18, 2008, when he\ndiscovered that none of his keys fit the lock to the gate to the Premises, two men who had\nbeen hired by Andrew K. as security personnel were standing near him. He asked them\nwhat was going on. One of them, who was about six feet four inches in height, said to\nJustin in an unfriendly manner that “we’re not going to play this guessing game.” Justin\ntestified that, at that time, he “felt fearful,” “felt a big presence over me” and “felt\nphysically scared.” He called his father, George L., “frantic, stating that our building had\nbeen taken over.” When George arrived, Rosalinda K. and Matthew K. approached, and\nGeorge and Rosalinda got into a heated argument. Four security personnel were present\nand two were videotaping the scene. Justin said that Rosalinda directed one of the\nsecurity personnel to “‘remove George L. from this Premises immediately.’” Justin felt a\nphysical confrontation was about to break out. He was concerned for George because he\nhad bladder cancer and had recently had heart surgery. Justin observed that his small 61-\nyear-old mother, Nansee L., was very nervous and was physically shaking. Justin\ntestified that he “felt scared” and “uncomfortable.” Justin said that he “felt that we were\nbeing bullied,” “there was a menacing presence” and he was “overwhelmed by the\nnumber of people that were against us.” Justin stated that he “was not sure whether or\nnot there was weapons or whatever,” due to the “large security presence and all the\npeople wearing baggy clothing.” When the Lannings first entered the Premises after the\njudgment of possession had been entered in the UD Action, Justin testified that he was\n“personally disgusted” and “felt horrified” at the condition of the Premises.\n\n\n\n                                               24\n\f          The trial court’s “power to grant a judgment notwithstanding the verdict is\nidentical to [its] power to grant a directed verdict.” (Hauter v.

(Christensen, supra, at p. 904.)\n       We agree with Andrew K. that the emotional distress described by Justin L. is\ninsufficient to constitute the severe emotional distress required as a matter of law for\nliability for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Andrew K. cites Hughes v. Pair,\nsupra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2625648\"><a href=\"/opinion/2625648/hughes-v-pair/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1035</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, in which the court affirmed a lower court’s ruling that the\ndefendant was not liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress to the plaintiff\nbased on her claim that she “suffered discomfort, worry, anxiety, upset stomach, concern,\nand agitation as the result of [the] defendant’s [sexually explicit] comments to her” in a\ntelephone call and a brief encounter with him at a museum. (Id. at pp. 1040, 1051.) In\nthe other case Andrew K. cites, Wong v. Jing (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">189</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1354</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the plaintiff\nalleged a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress arising from the\ndefendants’ disparaging posting about her on the Internet. (Id. at p. 1361.) The plaintiff\nsubmitted a declaration stating that the Internet posting “‘was very emotionally upsetting\nto me, and has caused me to lose sleep, have stomach upset and generalized anxiety.’”\n(Id. at p. 1377.) The court concluded that the stated conditions were insufficient to\nconstitute intentional infliction of emotional distress. (Ibid.)\n       Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Justin L., he and his parents\nwere in the immediate presence of persons whom he feared were about to physically\nharm himself and/or his parents and appeared to have the ability to inflict harm. They\nwere telling Justin and his parents in a threatening manner to stay off the Premises and\nforcibly keeping them off property that the Lannings owned by blocking access. The\nconduct Justin L. described may have gone beyond “‘“mere insults, . . . threats, . . . petty\noppressions, or other trivialities.”’” (Hughes v. Pair, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 1051.) The\n\n\n\n                                              26\n\fconduct may have been “‘very emotionally upsetting’” to Justin L. and caused him to\nhave “‘generalized anxiety.’” (Wong v. Jing, supra, 189 Cal.App.4th at p. 1377.)\n       Defendants’ conduct falls short, however, of being “‘of such substantial quantity\nor enduring quality that no reasonable man in a civilized society should be expected to\nendure it.’” (Hailey v. California Physicians’ Service, supra, 158 Cal.App.4th at p. 476.)\nDefendants’ conduct was intentional, but it was not so outrageous as to “‘exceed[] all\nbounds usually tolerated by decent society.’” (Christensen v. Superior Court, supra, 54\nCal.3d at pp. 904-905.) Justin L. may have been justifiably concerned for the well-being\nof his parents. The evidence does not show that defendants engaged in an “‘“extreme\ncase[] of violent attack [on Justin’s parents], where there [was] some especial likelihood\nof fright or shock.”’” (Id. at p. 905.) In the absence of such extreme egregious conduct\ntoward his parents, Justin L. cannot recover for intentional infliction of emotional distress\nbased upon any distress, worry or concern arising from defendants’ conduct toward his\nparents. (Ibid.) We conclude that the verdict is not supported by substantial evidence\nand reasonable inferences drawn from it. The trial court erred in denying Andrew K.’s\nmotion for judgment notwithstanding verdict on Justin L.’s intentional infliction of\nemotional distress claim. (Hauter v. Zogarts, supra, 14 Cal.3d at p. 110.) The judgment\nin Justin L.’s favor based upon liability for intentional infliction of emotional distress on\nhim must be reversed and the associated damages awards against Andrew K., Rosalinda\nK. and Matthew K. must be vacated.\n\n\n                                              II\n                                     NOTE ACTION\n\n\n       Andrew K. filed the Note Action, alleging the Lannings defaulted on the\npromissory note securing the $1 million deposit he paid them toward the purchase of the\nSunset Building while the Main Action was still in progress.

The grounds for the demurrer were that Andrew K.’s claims were required\nto be pleaded as a compulsory cross-complaint in the Main Action, and because they\nwere not so pleaded, then pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 426.30,\nsubdivision (a), Andrew K. was barred from raising them in a subsequent action. On that\nbasis, the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend and subsequently\nentered a judgment of dismissal.\n       “On review from an order sustaining a demurrer, ‘we examine the complaint de\nnovo to determine whether it alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any\nlegal theory, such facts being assumed true for this purpose.

In January 2007, he proposed to purchase the Sunset Building from\nthe Lannings and entered into an escrow agreement with them. As the agreement\nrequired, he deposited $600,000 with the Lannings, to be returned to him if he could not\nclose escrow by August 7, 2007. In return, the Lannings executed a promissory note to\nhim as security for the return of his deposit (First Note). Thereafter, the parties entered\ninto a written agreement to increase the deposit to $1 million, amend the First Note\n\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\faccordingly, and extend the date for close of escrow to October 31, 2007. Andrew K.\npaid the Lannings the additional deposit amount.\n        Andrew K. was unable to close escrow by the agreed upon date. The Lannings\nbegan repaying the First Note. As of April 19, 2008, the balance due and payable to\nAndrew K. was $408,000. The Lannings made no payment on the debt after that date.\nWhen the term of the First Note expired, Andrew K. demanded payment from the\nLannings. Rather than paying him, the Lannings gave him a promissory note for\n$408,000, “due and payable by February 28, 2009,” plus a two and a half percent penalty\n(Second Note). The Lannings never made a payment to Andrew K. under the Second\nNote. On April 1, 2010, Andrew K. filed the Note Action to recover under the Second\nNote.\n        Andrew K. contends on appeal that his causes of action based upon the promissory\nnote debt are not related to the transactions being litigated in the Main Action and,\ntherefore, the trial court erred in determining that he was required to raise the causes of\naction in a compulsory cross-complaint in the Main Action. He maintains that the failed\nSunset Building purchase giving rise to the promissory note debt is entirely separate\nfrom, and unrelated to, the dispensary business and lease transactions which are the basis\nfor the causes of action in the Main Action. We disagree.\n        Under Code of Civil Procedure section 426.30, subdivision (a), a defendant must\nallege “any related cause of action which (at the time of serving his answer to the\ncomplaint) he has against the plaintiff” in a cross-complaint and may not subsequently\nassert the related cause of action in another lawsuit. A “‘[r]elated cause of action’” is “a\ncause of action which arises out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of\ntransactions or occurrences as the cause of action which the plaintiff alleges in his\ncomplaint.” (Id., § 426.10, subd. (c).) At any time during the proceedings on the\ncomplaint, a defendant who initially fails to file such a cross-complaint may request leave\nto file the cross-complaint, and the court must grant the request if the defendant “acted in\ngood faith” in failing to file earlier. (Id., § 426.50.)

In support of his motion for\nsummary judgment in the Main Action, Andrew K. submitted a separate statement of\nundisputed facts. Undisputed facts numbered 12 through 18 were the same facts he\nalleged in the Note Action. At the summary judgment hearing, Andrew K. argued that\nthe Lannings did not need to recoup any consideration they paid under the Deal Points\nMemo, because the Lannings already had received money from Andrew K. as his deposit\non the failed purchase of the Sunset Building, and they had not returned it to Andrew K.7\n       Andrew K. asserted the promissory note debt as a defense in the Main Action. In\nhis answers to both the SAC and the TAC, he asserted the promissory note debt as an\naffirmative defense to “offset” to any liability assessed against him in the Main Action.8\nIn addition, in a hearing in the Main Action, Andrew K. asserted the Note Action as the\n\n\n\n\n7      At the summary judgment hearing, Andrew K.’s counsel also orally requested the\ncourt to grant leave for “the opportunity to file a cross-complaint on the basis of the\npromissory note that has recently matured.” The court said that would have to be made\nas a written motion.\n8       Andrew K.’s answers to both the SAC and the TAC asserted as an affirmative\ndefense: “To the extent that any sums are determined to be due and owing to [the\nLannings], and any of them, by . . . Andrew Kramer, . . . Andrew Kramer is entitled to an\noffset in an amount equal to all sums due and owing to [him] by [the Lannings].”\n\n\n                                                30\n\fbasis for his request for a stay of enforcement of the monetary award in favor of the Trust\nin the Main Action.\n       Andrew K. was aware of the possible need to file a cross-complaint in the Main\nAction. In the same hearing at which he asserted the Note Action as reason to stay\nenforcement in the Main Action, the Lannings’ counsel asserted that Andrew K.’s claims\nin the Note Action were related to the Main Action and should be brought as compulsory\ncross-claims in the Main Action. That Andrew K. had considered, but rejected, the cross-\ncomplaint procedure is indicated by the response of his counsel that Andrew K. had\n“elected to pursue those claims separately.” The court denied the requested stay and said\nthat the judgment in the Main Action could possibly provide the basis for issue preclusion\nor res judicata in the Note Action.\n       Cases that Andrew K. discusses do not support his contentions. Rather they\nsupport the applicability of the compulsory cross-complaint in the instant litigation. All\nof the cases involve transactions which the court determined were sufficiently related that\nthe compulsory cross-complaint statute would bar a second lawsuit.

As the Align Technology court also\nstated, “Because of the liberal construction given to the [compulsory cross-complaint]\nstatute to accomplish its purpose of avoiding a multiplicity of actions, ‘transaction’ is\nconstrued broadly; it is ‘not confined to a single, isolated act or occurrence . . . but may\nembrace a series of acts or occurrences logically interrelated [citations].’ [Citation.]”\n(Align Technology, Inc. v.
