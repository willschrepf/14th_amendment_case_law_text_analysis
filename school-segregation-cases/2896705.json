Kulp (“Kulp”) at the\n\nCentre County Prison in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania on August 27, 2001. Kulp’s parents,\n\nappellants Timothy D. Kulp 1 and Carol L. Kulp, filed suit against various prison officials\n\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and state law and now appeal the November 1, 2006 order\n\nof the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania granting\n\nsummary judgment in favor of defendants 2 on all claims. We will affirm.\n\n                                               I.\n\n       Because we write only for the parties, familiarity with the facts is presumed, and\n\nwe set forth only those facts that are relevant to our analysis.3\n\n\n\n   1\n    Timothy D. Kulp appeals individually and as administrator of the Estate of Timothy\nM. Kulp.\n   2\n    Appellants conceded in the District Court that their claims against Officer Wilmer\nAndrews, Officer Eric Gates, Officer Terry McClellan, Officer Michael Shearer, and\nOfficer Scott Stefanko should be dismissed and thus only appeal the District Court’s\ndismissal of defendants Timothy Gallu, Officer David Knepp, Lieutenant James Smith,\nShannon Quick, and Lieutenant Sonia Veruete.\n   3\n    This case is the subject of a previous not precedential opinion. Kulp v. Veruette, 167\nFed. Appx. 911 (3d Cir. 2006). There, we reversed the order of the District Court\ngranting defendants’ motions to dismiss and remanded for further proceedings.\n\n                                               2\n\f       On August 25, 2001, Kulp, an 18 year-old freshman at Pennsylvania State\n\nUniversity, attended two parties at off-campus fraternity houses, where he smoked\n\nmarijuana and consumed alcoholic beverages. While walking back to campus in the early\n\nmorning hours, he decided to enter a women’s residence hall for the purpose of finding\n\nfemale companionship. Once inside, he entered at least three unlocked rooms, crawled\n\ninto bed with the sleeping female occupants, and groped them.\n\n       Campus police interviewed Kulp later that day and arrested him after he admitted\n\nentering the rooms without consent and molesting the women. He was immediately\n\narraigned on felony charges of burglary, attempted burglary, trespass, indecent assault,\n\nand harassment, and then transported to the Centre County Prison. He arrived at the\n\nprison at 2:24 a.m. on August 26, 2001 and committed suicide in his cell at approximately\n\n11:00 p.m. the next evening.\n\n       The complaint alleges that defendants knew of and disregarded facts indicating\n\nthat Kulp was particularly vulnerable to suicide and that their conduct amounted to\n\ndeliberate indifference to a serious medical need in violation of Kulp’s right to life,\n\nliberty, and property as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States\n\nConstitution. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants,\n\nconcluding that “[t]here is no evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude that\n\n[defendants] were deliberately indifferent to Kulp’s medical or mental condition or a\n\nparticular vulnerability of Kulp to commit suicide.” (App. at 42.) This timely appeal\n\n\n                                              3\n\ffollowed.\n\n                                             II.\n\n       The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343. We\n\nhave jurisdiction over the appeal from the final judgment of the District Court pursuant to\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n       We exercise plenary review of a district court’s decision to grant summary\n\njudgment. Reese Bros., Inc. v. United States, 447 F.3d 229, 232 (3d Cir. 2006). “We\n\napply the standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) and therefore may\n\naffirm the district court’s order if, when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable\n\nto the non-moving party, there is ‘no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving\n\nparty is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.’” Id. (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)).\n\n                                             III.\n\n       We have previously held that plaintiffs in prison suicide cases bear the burden of\n\nestablishing three elements: “(1) the detainee had a ‘particular vulnerability to suicide,’\n\n(2) the custodial officer or officers knew or should have known of that vulnerability, and\n\n(3) those officers ‘acted with reckless indifference’ to the detainee’s particular\n\nvulnerability.” Colburn v. Upper Darby Twp., 946 F.2d 1017, 1023 (3d Cir. 1991)\n\n(quoting Colburn v. Upper Darby Twp., 838 F.2d 663, 669 (3d Cir. 1988)). Meeting this\n\nburden is not an easy task.\n\n       While the term “reckless indifference” is not susceptible to precise definition, it is\n\n\n                                              4\n\fclear that mere negligence on the part of prison officials is insufficient to establish a claim\n\npursuant to § 1983. We have held that plaintiffs must show that suicide was a “strong\n\nlikelihood, rather than a mere possibility.” Id. at 1024. Moreover, “the risk of self-\n\ninflicted injury must be not only great, but also sufficiently apparent that a lay custodian’s\n\nfailure to appreciate it evidences an absence of any concern for the welfare of his or her\n\ncharges.” Id. at 1025 (quoting Monmouth County Corr. Inst. Inmates v. Lanzaro, 834\n\nF.2d 326, 347 (3d Cir. 1987)).\n\n       The District Court’s well-reasoned, thirty-six page opinion amply illustrates why\n\nappellants have failed to meet their burden in this case. For example, defendants\n\nrecognized that Kulp had emotional issues and placed him in administrative segregation\n\nwhere they believed it would be easier to monitor his behavior. They arranged for Kulp\n\nto meet with Shannon Quick, a counselor trained in performing suicide risk assessment,\n\nwithin five hours of his arrival at the prison. After speaking with Kulp for three-and-a-\n\nhalf hours, Quick reported to prison officials that although she believed that Kulp was\n\nhaving “passive suicidal thoughts,” 4 she did not think it was necessary to place him on\n\nsuicide watch. Defendants also arranged for Kulp to meet with Timothy Gallu, the prison\n\ncounselor. Although Gallu was not a trained suicide counselor, he concurred with\n\nQuick’s conclusion that it was not necessary to place Kulp on suicide watch.\n\n\n   4\n     Quick testified that by “passive suicidal thoughts,” she meant that Kulp was feeling\nextremely hopeless and that things could not get worse. (App. at 413.) In her opinion,\nKulp had not moved “to the next stage of having an active thought of suicide.” (Id.)\n\n                                              5\n\f       Viewing all of the record evidence in the light most favorable to appellants, we\n\nagree with the District Court that no jury could reasonably find that defendants knew or\n\nshould have known that Kulp had a particular vulnerability to commit suicide or that\n\ndefendants acted with reckless indifference to his mental condition.\n\n                                              IV.\n\n       The District Court applied the proper legal standard and adeptly explained why\n\nappellants’ claim fails as a matter of law. We will affirm for substantially the reasons set\n\nforth in the Opinion of the District Court.\n\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f",

Meeting this\n\nburden is not an easy task.\n\n       While the term “reckless indifference” is not susceptible to precise definition, it is\n\n\n                                              4\n\fclear that mere negligence on the part of prison officials is insufficient to establish a claim\n\npursuant to § 1983. We have held that plaintiffs must show that suicide was a “strong\n\nlikelihood, rather than a mere possibility.” Id. at 1024. Moreover, “the risk of self-\n\ninflicted injury must be not only great, but also sufficiently apparent that a lay custodian’s\n\nfailure to appreciate it evidences an absence of any concern for the welfare of his or her\n\ncharges.” Id. at 1025 (quoting Monmouth County Corr. Inst. Inmates v. Lanzaro, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498141\"><a href=\"/opinion/498141/monmouth-county-correctional-institutional-inmates-kevin-michael/\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">326</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 347 (3d Cir. 1987)).\n\n       The District Court’s well-reasoned, thirty-six page opinion amply illustrates why\n\nappellants have failed to meet their burden in this case. For example, defendants\n\nrecognized that Kulp had emotional issues and placed him in administrative segregation\n\nwhere they believed it would be easier to monitor his behavior. They arranged for Kulp\n\nto meet with Shannon Quick, a counselor trained in performing suicide risk assessment,\n\nwithin five hours of his arrival at the prison. After speaking with Kulp for three-and-a-\n\nhalf hours, Quick reported to prison officials that although she believed that Kulp was\n\nhaving “passive suicidal thoughts,” 4 she did not think it was necessary to place him on\n\nsuicide watch. Defendants also arranged for Kulp to meet with Timothy Gallu, the prison\n\ncounselor. Although Gallu was not a trained suicide counselor, he concurred with\n\nQuick’s conclusion that it was not necessary to place Kulp on suicide watch.\n\n\n   4\n     Quick testified that by “passive suicidal thoughts,” she meant that Kulp was feeling\nextremely hopeless and that things could not get worse. (App. at 413.) In her opinion,\nKulp had not moved “to the next stage of having an active thought of suicide.” (Id.)\n\n                                              5\n\f       Viewing all of the record evidence in the light most favorable to appellants, we\n\nagree with the District Court that no jury could reasonably find that defendants knew or\n\nshould have known that Kulp had a particular vulnerability to commit suicide or that\n\ndefendants acted with reckless indifference to his mental condition.\n\n                                              IV.\n\n       The District Court applied the proper legal standard and adeptly explained why\n\nappellants’ claim fails as a matter of law. We will affirm for substantially the reasons set\n\nforth in the Opinion of the District Court.\n\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f</pre>",
