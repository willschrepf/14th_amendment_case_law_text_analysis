Ct. No. MH034663\n____________________________________)\n\n\n        Christine Barrett is an adult who has long been diagnosed with mental\nretardation and other mental disorders, and who has lived in the community while\nbeing supported and supervised by others. Because of her increasingly violent\nbehavior, Barrett became the subject of this proceeding to civilly commit her as a\n―mentally retarded person‖ who is a ―danger‖ to herself or others. (Welf. & Inst.\nCode,1 § 6500 (section 6500).)2 The People sought placement in a secure\ntreatment facility pursuant to the statutory scheme.\n\n1       All further undesignated statutory references are to the Welfare and\nInstitutions Code.\n2      Barrett suggests that ―mental retardation‖ and closely related phrases are\noutmoded expressions for persons with subaverage cognitive and adaptive\nfunctioning, and that California courts should speak only in terms of persons who\nare ―developmentally disabled‖ or ―intellectually disabled.‖ A similar point is\nmade in the lone amicus curiae brief filed in this court, which was submitted by\nDisability Rights California on behalf of itself and other entities and individuals.\nThe terms ―mentally retarded‖ and ―mental retardation‖ appeared throughout the\n                                                          (footnote continued on next page)\n\n                                          1\n\f        Following a nonjury trial in which Barrett was represented by counsel, the\ntrial court sustained the allegations of the petition. The court ordered her\ncommitted for one year to the State Department of Developmental Services\n(Department), and otherwise approved the requested placement. The judgment\nwas affirmed on appeal. This court granted Barrett‘s petition for review.\n        We now decide whether the Court of Appeal properly rejected Barrett‘s\nclaims that she was denied due process and equal protection of the law insofar as\nthe record does not reveal the circumstances under which she was tried by the\ncourt, rather than by a jury. The statutory scheme does not expressly provide\neither for a right to jury trial or for any related requirement that an alleged\nmentally retarded person be advised of, or allowed to personally act upon, any\nsuch right. Nevertheless, the parties do not dispute that Barrett was entitled under\nlongstanding equal protection principles to a jury unless a jury was validly waived.\n        Critical here is that Barrett further insists the trial court was constitutionally\ncompelled to (1) expressly advise her that she could request a jury, and (2) obtain\nher personal waiver of a jury, before holding a bench trial and deciding all\n\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\n\nstatutory scheme when the present commitment proceedings were held and the\nfindings under review were made. To avoid confusion, we use such original\nterminology here, and cite the version of the statutory scheme applied to Barrett at\nall stages of the present case. Nonetheless, we are aware that legislative\nenactments and proposed amendments replace references to ―mental retardation‖\nunder section 6500 et seq. with such terms as ―developmental disability‖ and\n―intellectual disability.‖ (See Assem. Bill No. 1472, approved by Governor, June\n27, 2012 (2011-2012 Reg. Sess.); see also Sen. Amend. to Assem. Bill No. 2370\n(2011-2012 Reg. Sess.) June 20, 2012.) As suggested by both Barrett and Justice\nLiu‘s concurring and dissenting opinion, however, nothing in this new or pending\nlegislation appears on its face to concern either the right to jury trial or the\nancillary procedures at issue here.\n\n\n                                            2\n\fcommitment issues itself. Because the record does not show whether such\nprocedures occurred here, Barrett views the commitment order as inherently\nunsound and reversible per se. We disagree, and find no constitutional violation.\n       Barrett‘s due process and equal protection theories share the same flawed\npremise. The section 6500 procedure itself undermines Barrett‘s assumption that\npersons alleged to be mentally retarded and dangerous can necessarily decide for\nthemselves, in a knowing and intelligent manner, whether to demand a jury at their\ncommitment trials. As we explain, that process is initiated, and proceeds from the\noutset, on the basis of strong evidence that the individual facing commitment has\ncognitive and intellectual impairments that would prevent him or her from making\na meaningful decision whether to invoke, or waive, the right to a jury trial. The\nperson‘s rights and interests are nonetheless protected by the state‘s statutory\nobligation to provide counsel in section 6500 proceedings.\n       Accordingly, consistent with closely related decisions of this court, and\ngiven the mental competence issues addressed in section 6500 proceedings as\ncompared to other commitment scenarios, we conclude it is counsel who must\nmake the tactical decision whether to seek or waive a jury. To encumber the jury\ntrial right with a collateral requirement that any waiver be personally made by the\nproposed committee following a formal court advisement would serve no useful\npurpose in this context. This approach does not undermine the fairness of the\nproceedings in a due process sense, or treat dangerous mentally retarded persons\ndifferently from those with whom they are aligned for equal protection purposes.\nWe therefore will affirm the judgment.\n\n\n                               I. CASE HISTORY\n       On January 22, 2009, the district attorney, acting on the People‘s behalf,\nfiled a petition in Santa Clara County Superior Court to commit Barrett under\n                                          3\n\fsection 6500. According to the petition, Barrett lived in a private residence with\nstaff assistance. The party responsible for her care, maintenance, and support was\nthe San Andreas Regional Center (Center).3 The Center‘s service coordinator,\nBetty Crane, was the person who requested that the petition be filed.\n       The petition further alleged that Barrett was mentally retarded and\ndangerous to herself and others. On this basis, the court was asked to hold an\nevidentiary hearing and to order Barrett committed to the Department for care,\ncustody, and treatment for a period not exceeding one year. In providing reasons\nfor filing the commitment petition, the district attorney relied on ―the assessment,\nevaluations, reports and other documents‖ of the Center and the Department.\nThese materials were incorporated by reference into the petition, and were filed at\nthe same time in the form of a confidential exhibit.\n       On the day the petition was filed, the trial court set a hearing for March 9,\n2009. Pending the hearing, the court also ordered Barrett‘s interim placement\nunder the Department‘s care in a particular secure treatment facility.\n       Counsel for both parties appeared in court on March 9. Although a court\nreporter was also present, no reported proceedings occurred and no transcript was\nprepared. As noted by the Court of Appeal, the only record of the hearing is a\nprinted minute order. It indicates, in an abbreviated handwritten note, that the\nmatter was continued to April 8, 2009, at 10:00 a.m., for a two-hour hearing. The\nMarch 9 minute order contains no other substantive information.\n\n\n\n\n3      The Center is one of several regional, community-based nonprofit agencies\nfunded and regulated by the state to serve developmentally disabled persons,\npursuant to the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (LDDSA).\n(See § 4620; see also post, at p. 11, fn. 10.)\n\n\n                                          4\n\f       On April 8, the trial court began the proceeding at the scheduled time.\nBarrett and counsel for both parties were present in the courtroom. Counsel\nagreed that the previous two-hour estimate accurately reflected the total amount of\ntime needed to present evidence and try the case. The People then called Dr.\nRobert Thomas, their first and only witness, to the stand. Nothing in the reporter‘s\ntranscript indicates that any mention of trial by jury occurred.\n       Dr. Thomas was a psychologist at the Center who qualified as an expert\nwitness on mental retardation, and who had examined Barrett and reviewed her\ncase history. He testified that Barrett, then age 27, was mentally retarded. She\nhad an I.Q. in the ―50‘s to 40‘s‖ — a level deemed ―moderate‖ in the sense that it\nwas neither mild nor severe. Dr. Thomas based this conclusion, in part, on school\nrecords and psychological reports from early in Barrett‘s life, before she became a\nclient of the Center in 2001.4\n       Dr. Thomas further opined that because of cognitive deficits associated\nwith her mental retardation, Barrett had serious difficulty controlling her behavior,\nand was a danger to herself and others. This determination rested on two main\nfactors: (1) Barrett‘s incapacity ―to understand the complexity of her disorder and\nthe need for treatment,‖ and (2) her volatile and violent history, as set forth in\n―incident reports‖ compiled by the Center.5\n\n4      Dr. Thomas noted near the end of his direct examination that Barrett had\nbeen diagnosed over the years with various mental disorders in addition to mental\nretardation. They included autism, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and\nschizoaffective disorder.\n5      On cross-examination, Dr. Thomas acknowledged that other mental\ndisorders besides mental retardation can trigger aggression, including autism and\nschizophrenia. However, in Barrett‘s case, he declined to blame her violent\noutbursts either solely or primarily on any diagnosed mental disorder other than\nmental retardation. While such conditions likely interacted to affect her behavior,\n                                                            (footnote continued on next page)\n\n                                           5\n\f        Dr. Thomas explained that Barrett had lived at home with her parents until\n2001. Because of physical assaults and verbal abuse against her parents, and\nnoncompliance with her treatment plan, Barrett was placed in a residential facility,\nor group home. This facility, where Barrett stayed for five years, was well staffed\nand closely monitored. However, according to Dr. Thomas, Barrett repeatedly left\nthe premises without proper notice and supervision, and disrupted the community\nby ―threatening people‖ and acting in ―inappropriate‖ and ―self-destructive‖ ways.\nSimilar problems arose inside the facility, often triggering an emergency response\nand psychiatric hospitalization.\n        Dr. Thomas testified that, beginning in 2006, Barrett was moved into a\ncondominium that her parents owned. This arrangement was facilitated by support\nstaff trained to help persons like Barrett live independently. According to Dr.\nThomas, Barrett‘s outbursts continued. The Center documented 30 incidents in\nthe 18-month period before the hearing. Typically, Barrett became agitated about\npersonal matters, and responded by assaulting family members or staff, damaging\nproperty, and committing certain forms of self-abuse. Dr. Thomas noted that\n―furniture and pictures and all kinds of things had to be removed from her\napartment just to keep her safe.‖6\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\n\nand it was difficult to distinguish between them in that sense, the ―limited\ncognitive ability‖ associated with mental retardation played a central role in\ncausing her dangerousness. According to Dr. Thomas, it was Barrett‘s inability to\nunderstand that she was mentally disordered and needed treatment that most\nimpaired her past progress and prognosis.\n6      For example, in September 2008, Barrett was ―obsessing‖ at home about\nher hair color when she learned her mother would arrive soon. Barrett became\nupset, broke a chair and other furnishings, and was restrained by staff when she\nshowed aggression toward her mother. Barrett then locked herself in the\n                                                          (footnote continued on next page)\n\n                                          6\n\f        In light of this evidence, Dr. Thomas recommended that Barrett be\ncommitted to a particular secure treatment facility — the same one that was\nserving as interim housing at the time of the hearing. He explained that it was the\nleast restrictive placement. Barrett‘s history showed that she could not safely\nreside in either a less secure group home or an independent living situation.\n        Barrett testified as the only witness on her behalf. She did not like her\ncurrent placement because, even though the people were nice and the food was\ngood, she could not go on outings and preferred the group home. She liked her\nmedication because it calmed her, but denied being mentally disordered.\n        Following closing argument, the trial court found that, notwithstanding any\nother disorders, Barrett was mentally retarded and dangerous under section 6500,\nand that the danger she posed to herself and others was based upon, and caused by,\nher mental retardation. She was committed to the Department for one year\nbeginning on April 8, 2009, the date of the hearing. The court designated the\n\n\n\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\n\nbathroom, but became docile when the police arrived and took her to a psychiatric\nunit for evaluation. Later that month, Barrett was crying in her bedroom when she\nsuddenly emerged and punched holes in the walls. She threw a glass bowl at a\nwindow, breaking the window on the second try. Two months later, in December\n2008, Barrett refused to leave home for a mental health appointment. She\nthreatened to harm staff, destroyed property, and purposefully scratched her face\nto make it bleed. This episode triggered a 9-1-1 call and admission to a\npsychiatric unit. Finally, two incidents occurred in January 2009. First, Barrett\ncame home upset after attending church with her parents. She assaulted staff and\nwas hospitalized for emergency psychiatric care. Later that month, at the Center,\nBarrett cursed and angrily announced that she had changed her name. She\nthreatened to harm staff with a knife, and then entered the bathroom and scratched\nher arm.\n\n\n                                           7\n\fsecure treatment facility then being used as interim housing as the least restrictive\nand most appropriate placement.7\n       On appeal, Barrett focused on the lack of a jury at her commitment trial.\nBased on the premise that she had a constitutional right to a jury decision on the\nallegations of the petition, Barrett argued that due process and equal protection\nprinciples were violated insofar as the record did not show that the trial court\nadvised her of the right to a jury, or elicited a valid waiver of that right before\nholding a bench trial. She relied on two cases — both from the Third District\nCourt of Appeal — imposing these requirements in section 6500 proceedings.\n(People v. Alvas (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 1459 (Alvas); see id. at pp. 1463-1464\n[recognizing equal protection right to personal jury advisement like the one given\nto dangerous mentally ill persons under § 5302 of the Lanterman-Petris-Short\n(LPS) Act], pp. 1464-1465 [concluding that jury waiver is uninformed and invalid\nfor due process purposes absent an express personal advisement]; accord, People\nv. Bailie (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 841, 847 (Bailie) [reaffirming Alvas on equal\nprotection grounds, and declining to reexamine Alvas‘s due process analysis].)\n\n\n7      The trial court scheduled a followup hearing in July 2009, to review the\ncomplex nature of Barrett‘s diagnosed disorders, and to ensure the best placement\nand treatment options over the long term. The court contemplated that, in the\nensuing three-month period, either the Center or Barrett‘s treatment facility would\nconduct a full evaluation of her psychiatric history. No further testing was\nordered. The record contains no other information about the July 2009 hearing or\nabout any other trial court proceeding after the April 2009 commitment hearing.\nIndeed, we infer that the original commitment order ―expire[d] automatically‖ by\nits own terms one year after it was made (§ 6500), and that it therefore is\ntechnically moot. Because the issues are of recurring importance and properly\npresented by the parties, we decide the case on the merits. (See, e.g.,\nConservatorship of John L. (2010) 48 Cal.4th 131, 142, fn. 2 (John L.), and cases\ncited; Conservatorship of Hofferber (1980) 28 Cal.3d 161, 167, fn. 2 (Hofferber),\nand cases cited.)\n\n\n                                           8\n\f       Here, however, a unanimous Sixth District Court of Appeal panel rejected\nthe Third District‘s approach as an aberrant departure from settled law. The\ninstant Court of Appeal observed that except for Alvas, supra, 221 Cal.App.3d\n1459, and Bailie, supra, 144 Cal.App.4th 841, California courts have never placed\nany procedural conditions on the manner in which the defense demands or\ndeclines a jury under section 6500. This approach warranted rejection of Barrett‘s\nconstitutional claims, the court said, because her competence on jury trial matters\nwas in doubt given the nature of the issues raised under section 6500. The Court\nof Appeal further reasoned that the failure of the defense to request a jury\ngenerally waives the right, and that the apparent absence of such a request here\nprecluded a finding that a jury had been wrongly denied. The judgment was\naffirmed. Barrett sought review.\n                       II. STATUTORY BACKGROUND\n       California has no fewer than nine involuntary commitment procedures that\nmay apply to persons who have various mental problems, and who pose a threat to\ntheir own welfare or to the safety of others. Some of these laws, including section\n6500 et seq., operate in a manner largely independent of the criminal justice\nsystem. (See §§ 4825 [developmentally disabled persons under the LDDSA],\n5000 et seq. [mentally ill persons under the LPS Act].) Others apply depending on\nwhether a criminal prosecution has occurred. (See § 3000 et seq. [narcotic addicts\nwhether or not they have been convicted of crimes].) Certain accused criminals\nmay receive a mental health commitment in lieu of conviction and punishment.\n(See Pen. Code, §§ 1026-1027 [defendants acquitted by reason of insanity], 1367\net seq. [defendants found mentally incompetent].) Also, dangerously disordered\noffenders may be held upon discharge by the juvenile authorities (see Welf. &\nInst. Code, § 1800 et seq.), or after serving a prison term (see § 6600 et seq.\n\n\n                                          9\n\f[sexually violent predators]; Pen. Code, § 2960 et seq. [mentally disordered\noffenders]).\n       The statutory scheme applied here has been in effect for over 40 years.8\nThe basic rule is that ―no mentally retarded person may be committed‖ to the\nDepartment ―unless he or she is a danger to himself or herself, or others.‖\n(§ 6500.) Dangerousness includes a finding of incompetence to stand trial under\nPenal Code section 1367 et seq., for accused criminals in certain serious and\nviolent cases. (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 6500.) For mentally retarded persons under\nthe care or treatment of a state hospital or other facility when the petition is filed,\nproof of a recent overt act is not needed to find them to be a danger to themselves\nor others. (Ibid.)\n       A section 6500 proceeding commences under certain conditions. First,\ndesignated persons ―may request‖ that a petition for commitment be filed by an\n―authorized‖ official, as discussed further below. (§ 6502.)9 In general,\nindividuals allowed to make this ―request‖ are those charged with the support of\nthe mentally retarded person, are representatives of the juvenile or criminal justice\n\n8      See former section 6500.1, added by Statutes 1970, chapter 351, section 3,\npage 765, and renumbered as section 6500 and amended by Statutes 1978, chapter\n1319, section 2, page 4316; see also sections 6502-6512 (exclusive of § 6504.5),\nadded by Statutes 1967, chapter 1667, section 37, page 4107, operative July 1,\n1969.\n9      Section 6502 states, in pertinent part: ―The following persons may request\nthe person authorized to present allegations pursuant to Section 6500 to file a\npetition for commitment: [¶] (a) The parent, guardian, conservator, or other\nperson charged with the support of the mentally retarded person. [¶] (b) The\nprobation officer. [¶] (c) The Youth Authority. [¶] (d) Any person designated\nfor that purpose by the judge of the court. [¶] (e) The Director of Corrections. [¶]\n(f) The regional center director or his or her designee. [¶] The request shall state\nthe petitioner‘s reasons for supposing the person to be eligible for admission\nthereto, and shall be verified by affidavit.‖\n\n\n                                           10\n\fsystem, are designated by the court, or — as in the present case — serve as the\ndirector of a regional center, or as his or her designee. (§ 6502.)10 This provision\nappears to assume that the requesting party is familiar with the person sought to be\ncommitted, or has access to relevant information about the person‘s condition and\nhistory. Indeed, any ―request‖ made under section 6502 must document or\notherwise state ―reasons‖ for asserting that the person is eligible for commitment.\nAny request containing such information also must be ―verified by affidavit.‖\n(Ibid.)\n          Second, allegations that a person is mentally retarded and dangerous are\npresented to the superior court in petition form by either the district attorney or\ncounty counsel, as determined by the county board of supervisors. (§ 6500; see\n§ 6502.) Where a petition is filed, the court appoints the director of the regional\ncenter, or a designee, to examine the person and submit a written report.\n(§ 6504.5.)11 The report must include an evaluation of the person, as well as a\n\n10     Under the LDDSA, regional centers consist of a network of ―private\nnonprofit community agencies‖ (§ 4620, subd. (b)) with which the state, through\nthe Department, contracts to provide lifetime support directly to developmentally\ndisabled persons and their families. (Id., subd. (a); see § 4512, subd. (a) [defining\n― ‗developmental disability‘ ‖ to include mental retardation].) Regional centers\nassess clients by reviewing their diagnostic history, and providing or procuring a\nwide range of tests and evaluations. (See §§ 4642, 4643.) In each case, the center\nestablishes both a ― ‗planning team‘ ‖ (§ 4512, subd. (j)) and an ―individual\nprogram plan‖ identifying goals and needs (§ 4646). A high priority is ―direct\nservice coordination‖ (§ 4640.6, subd. (a)), in which services are obtained from\nproviders, vendors, and contractors. (See §§ 4640.7, 4647, 4648.) A regional\ncenter employee, or ― ‗service coordinator,‘ ‖ prepares individual program plans,\nsecures needed services, and provides placement and monitoring support.\n(§ 4640.6, subd. (d); see Morohoshi v. Pacific Home (2004) 34 Cal.4th 482, 487-\n488.)\n11     Section 6504.5 states, in pertinent part: ―Wherever a petition is filed [under\nsection 6500 et seq.], the court shall appoint the director of a regional center for\n                                                            (footnote continued on next page)\n\n                                           11\n\frecommendation for placement both on an interim basis pending the evidentiary\nhearing and after any commitment decision is made. (§ 6504.5, see §§ 6506,\n6509, subd. (a).) Relevant factors include the least restrictive residential option\nneeded to achieve treatment goals and maintain public safety. (§ 6504.5.) A\nseparate report along similar lines may be submitted by any developmental center\nrecommended for placement in the regional center report. (Ibid.)\n        Within a limited time after the petition is filed, the court must set an\nevidentiary hearing. (§ 6503; see § 6504 [notice of hearing].) A suitable interim\nplacement may be ordered pending the hearing, with consideration given to the\nreports and recommendations of the regional center and any developmental center\ninvolved in the case.

Thus, for persons who lack their own attorney, the court ―shall\nimmediately appoint‖ counsel to represent them. (§ 6500.)12 The court is also\ndirected to ―inquire‖ into the person‘s condition, and to thereby enhance the\navailability of evidence on this issue. (§ 6507.) Thus, the court may subpoena\nqualified physicians and psychologists to examine the person and to testify about\nhis or her ―mentality.‖ (Ibid.) The attendance of other witnesses also may be\ncompelled. (Ibid.; see § 6508 [authorizing witness fees and expenses].)\n       The requisite findings of mental retardation and dangerousness allow the\nperson to be ―committed to the [Department] for suitable treatment and\nhabilitation services.‖ (§ 6509, subd. (a).) The same statute requires selection of\nthe ―least restrictive residential placement‖ to meet these goals, identifies a range\nof available facilities (e.g., state hospitals and community care centers), and\npermits other appropriate dispositions (e.g., conditional release into the\ncommunity) that do not risk the welfare of the person or the public. (Ibid.)\nSpecific procedures guide the court in selecting an appropriate placement,\nincluding consideration of the regional center report submitted under section\n6504.5. (§ 6509, subd. (a).)\n       An order of commitment ―expire[s] automatically one year after‖ it is\nmade. (§ 6500.) Subsequent commitments for additional periods may be sought\n\n\n\n\n12     Section 6500 states, in pertinent part: ―In any proceedings conducted under\nthe authority of [section 6500 et seq.], the alleged mentally retarded person shall\nbe informed of his or her right to counsel by the court, and if the person does not\nhave an attorney for the proceedings, the court shall immediately appoint the\npublic defender or other attorney to represent him or her.‖\n\n\n                                          13\n\ffor persons who remain mentally retarded and dangerous. Recommitment\nprocedures are ―the same as with an initial petition for commitment.‖ (Ibid.)\n                                 III. DISCUSSION\n       Preliminarily, no statute by its plain terms authorizes a jury to determine\nwhether someone is mentally retarded and dangerous for purposes of a section\n6500 commitment. The lack of any jury trial provision distinguishes the statutory\nprocedures regulating section 6500 proceedings from most other involuntary\ncommitment schemes, as we discuss further below.\n       Nevertheless, here, as in the Court of Appeal, there is no dispute that\nsomeone facing commitment under section 6500 et seq. has the right to trial by\njury on the allegations of the petition. Neither party rests this premise on any\nprovision of the federal or state Constitution that directly or expressly grants the\nright to a jury in criminal or civil trials.13 Rather, they invoke a long and\nunbroken line of California appellate court cases holding or assuming — largely\non the basis of federal and state equal protection principles affecting fundamental\ninterests — that persons alleged to be mentally retarded and dangerous cannot be\ndenied a jury altogether where jury trials are granted by statute to persons alleged\nto be mentally impaired and dangerous under comparable commitment laws.\n\n\n\n\n13      See, e.g., the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution (―In all\ncriminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to . . . an impartial jury‖);\narticle I, section 16 of the California Constitution (―Trial by jury is an inviolate\nright and shall be secured to all, but in a civil cause three-fourths of the jury may\nrender a verdict. A jury may be waived in a criminal cause by the consent of both\nparties expressed in open court by the defendant and the defendant‘s counsel. In a\ncivil cause a jury may be waived by the consent of the parties expressed as\nprescribed by statute‖).\n\n\n                                          14\n\fThus, persons like Barrett ―are entitled to jury trial upon request.‖ (O‘Brien v.\nSuperior Court (1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 62, 69.)14\n       We now assess the adequacy of this basic rule, and decide whether\nadditional adjunct procedures must be followed in open court for a valid nonjury\ntrial to occur. Each of Barrett‘s theories under the due process and equal\nprotection clauses of the federal and state Constitutions is examined in turn.\nA. Due Process Claim\n       Barrett contends it is not sufficient for federal and state due process\npurposes that the courts have implied a right to trial by jury to protect the interests\nat stake in section 6500 proceedings. She claims the jury trial option needs its\nown supplemental layer of support. In other words, the decision whether to try the\ncase to the court or to a jury belongs solely to the person facing commitment, and\nit must be made personally, not through counsel. Under this view, any waiver of a\njury trial is not knowing and intelligent, and is invalid, unless the court first\nexpressly advises the person of that right. Because the record shows no such\n\n\n\n14     See People v. Wilkinson (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 543, 547; People v.\nSweeney (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 210, 217-218; Bailie, supra, 144 Cal.App.4th\n841, 844-847; Alvas, supra, 221 Cal.App.3d 1459, 1462-1463; Money v. Krall\n(1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 378, 398 (Money); In re Watson (1979) 91 Cal.App.3d\n455, 459-460; see also In re Hop (1981) 29 Cal.3d 82, 92-93 (Hop) (holding that\ndevelopmentally disabled adults who are incapable of protesting or consenting to\nhospitalization by third parties under § 4825, and who have no statutory hearing\nrights upon admission, have equal protection hearing rights that include ―jury trial\non demand,‖ consistent with jury trial statutes in other commitment schemes); see\nHop at pp. 93-94 (noting that similar constitutional jury trial rule applies in § 6500\nproceedings under O‘Brien v. Superior Court, supra, 61 Cal.App.3d 62, 68-69); In\nre Gary W. (1971) 5 Cal.3d 296, 303-308 (Gary W.) (same equal protection rule as\nto dangerously disturbed persons held for treatment upon discharge from juvenile\nsystem under § 1800 et seq., and who had no statutory jury trial right at the time).\n\n\n                                           15\n\fexpress advisement and personal waiver here, Barrett insists a structural defect in\nthe proceeding occurred, and that automatic reversal of the judgment is compelled.\n       The People reply that persons alleged to be mentally retarded should be\ntreated no differently from defendants in certain other kinds of commitment trials\nwho, because of their alleged mental impairments, lack sufficient capacity to\npersonally understand and implement the jury trial right, or to override any\ncontrary decision by counsel. Alluding to the rules generally applicable in civil\ncases, the People insist a waiver meets due process requirements where, as here,\nthe record does not show that counsel, who presumably made an informed and\ncompetent decision in this regard, requested a jury before the section 6500 trial\nbegan.15 The People have the better view.\n       This court observed long ago that section 6500 proceedings are not criminal\nin nature, and that commitment under this scheme, though involuntary, is not\npunishment. (Cramer v. Tyars (1979) 23 Cal.3d 131, 137 [denying alleged\nmentally retarded and dangerous persons an absolute right under § 6500 similar to\nthe one held by criminal defendants not to be called as a witness].) ―The sole state\n\n15      Code of Civil Procedure section 631, subdivision (a) states: ―The right to a\ntrial by jury as declared by Section 16 of Article I of the California Constitution\nshall be preserved to the parties inviolate. In civil cases, a jury may only be\nwaived pursuant to subdivision (d).‖ Under subdivision (d) of the same section,\n―[a] party waives trial by jury in any of the following ways: [¶] (1) By failing to\nappear at the trial. [¶] (2) By written consent filed with the clerk or judge. [¶] (3)\nBy oral consent, in open court, entered in the minutes. [¶] (4) By failing to\nannounce that a jury is required, at the time the cause is first set for trial, if it is set\nupon notice or stipulation, or within five days after notice of setting if it is set\nwithout notice or stipulation. [¶] (5) By failing to deposit with the clerk, or judge,\nadvance jury fees as provided in subdivision (b). [¶] (6) By failing to deposit with\nthe clerk or judge, at the beginning of the second and each succeeding day‘s\nsession, the sum provided in subdivision (c).‖ (Code Civ. Proc., § 631, subd. (d),\nitalics added.)\n\n\n                                            16\n\finterest, legislatively expressed, is the custodial care, diagnosis, treatment, and\nprotection of persons who are unable to take care of themselves and who for their\nown well being and the safety of others cannot be left adrift in the community.‖\n(Cramer v. Tyars, at p. 137.)\n       But civil commitment for any purpose can affect liberty and other vital\ninterests. (Addington v. Texas (1979) 441 U.S. 418, 425-426 (Addington); People\nv. Allen (2008) 44 Cal.4th 843, 862 (Allen).) Hence, due process safeguards apply\nwhether the proceeding concerns mentally retarded and dangerous persons (e.g.,\nHeller v. Doe (1993) 509 U.S. 312, 330-333 (Heller)), or persons suffering from\nother dangerous disorders needing care and treatment. (E.g., Addington, at\npp. 420-421, 425-427 [mental illness in the form of paranoid schizophrenia];\nMoore v. Superior Court (2010) 50 Cal.4th 802, 810, 815 (Moore) [diagnosed\nmental disorder qualifying convicted sex offender as ―sexually violent predator‖];\nJohn L., supra, 48 Cal.4th 131, 142, 150 [grave disability affecting welfare of\nmentally disordered person].)\n       Notably, the procedural safeguards required in this context are flexible\n(People v. Tilbury (1991) 54 Cal.3d 56, 68 (Tilbury)), and the quantum and quality\nof the process due depends upon the nature and purpose of the challenged\ncommitment. (John L., supra, 48 Cal.4th 131, 150.) In making this\ndetermination, the courts weigh, assess, and consider various factors affected by\nthe disputed procedure. Distilled, these considerations involve (1) the various\nprivate interests at stake, (2) any competing state or public concerns, and (3) the\npotential risk of an erroneous or unreliable outcome. (Ibid.; see Moore, supra, 50\nCal.4th 802, 819; Allen, supra, 44 Cal.4th 843, 862-863; Conservatorship of\nBen C. (2007) 40 Cal.4th 529, 538-539 (Ben C.).)\n       Barrett treats the first factor, involving her own due process interests, as\nsalient here. (See Ben C., supra, 40 Cal.4th 529, 538.) She observes, and we\n                                          17\n\fagree, that section 6500 proceedings potentially involve a significant restraint on\nliberty. Whether the requisite findings of mental retardation and dangerousness\nare made by the court or a jury, the person is ordered committed to the Department\nfor up to one year. Recommitment may be sought if the person‘s condition has not\nmaterially changed during that time. Although the least restrictive placement is\nrequired under the particular circumstances, several statutory options involve\ncustodial control. They include confinement in a secure facility to treat the\nmentally retarded person and to protect the public from the dangers that he or she\npresents. (See §§ 6500, 6509, subd. (a).) Such was the case with Barrett.\n       In addition, we have said that persons facing commitment have a\n― ‗dignitary interest‘ ‖ in being informed of the ― ‗nature, grounds, and\nconsequences‘ ‖ of the proceeding, and in presenting ― ‗their side of the story‘ ‖\nbefore a determination is made. (Allen, supra, 44 Cal.4th 843, 862; see id. at\np. 868 [identifying statutory procedures that protect due process dignitary interests\nof alleged sexually violent predators under § 6600 et seq.]; accord, Moore, supra,\n50 Cal.4th 802, 819, 824.) It bears emphasis that Barrett does not highlight this\nfactor, or identify any specific flaws in the statutory scheme in this regard. (See\n§§ 6502 [petition must be supported by verified ―request‖ from informed party,\nand must state ―reasons‖ for commitment], 6504 [notice of hearing], 6504.5\n[mental examination and written report required by regional center director or\ndesignee], 6500 [right to counsel], 6507 [availability of expert testimony and other\nwitnesses on mental retardation].)\n       As Barrett suggests, the foregoing interests have been deemed sufficiently\nfundamental to implicate certain constitutional jury trial concerns in commitment\ncases, at least in those relatively few instances in which a right to trial by jury has\nnot been legislatively prescribed. It does not follow, however, that the jury trial\noption implied by the courts in section 6500 proceedings is illusory unless\n                                          18\n\faccompanied by the ancillary procedures Barrett seeks. Nor do such procedures\nnecessarily amount to independent constitutional rights applicable in every case.\nInstead, their due process availability depends, in a particular instance, on a\ncareful balancing of the public and private interests described above.\n       In this regard, Barrett fails to consider, and we must now address, the\nspecial character of the commitment proceeding at issue. This consideration\nundermines her due process claim.\n       The controlling principles appear in our unanimous decision in People v.\nMasterson (1994) 8 Cal.4th 965 (Masterson). There, the defendant was charged\nby felony complaint with violent crimes. Before the preliminary hearing, the\nmagistrate declared a doubt as to the defendant‘s mental competence to stand trial.\n(See Pen. Code, § 1367.) The matter was sent to the superior court for a\ncompetence hearing.\n       For the hearing, a panel of 12 jurors was chosen to hear evidence and\ndecide competence. Shortly before the presentation of evidence was set to begin,\ncounsel for both sides and the defendant were present in court. However, only 11\njurors appeared. The 12th juror apparently was missing. The prosecutor and\ndefense counsel agreed that the matter could be tried by a jury consisting of the 11\npanelists in court at the time. When asked by the trial court whether he understood\nthis stipulation, the defendant made clear that he rejected its terms. He told the\ncourt that he would ― ‗rather have 12 jurors.‘ ‖ (Masterson, supra, 8 Cal.4th 965,\n967.) When asked pointblank if he objected to the stipulation allowing an 11-\nperson jury, the defendant said, ― ‗Yes.‘ ‖ (Id. at p. 968.)\n       Over the defendant‘s objection, and consistent with counsel‘s approach, the\ncompetence trial was held in front of only 11 jurors. They unanimously found the\ndefendant mentally competent. A different jury then convicted him of the charged\ncrimes. On appeal, the judgment was reversed on the ground that use of an 11-\n                                          19\n\fperson jury to decide competence over the defendant‘s personal objection\nconstituted prejudicial error. This court reversed the Court of Appeal.\n       The critical question in Masterson was whether defense counsel could\n―waive the right to a jury trial entirely,‖ even if the defendant objected.\n(Masterson, supra, 8 Cal.4th 965, 968.) If so, counsel would necessarily have the\nlesser authority, so to speak, of agreeing to a jury of fewer than the usual 12\npersons. (Id. at p. 969; see Cal. Const., art. I, § 16; Code Civ. Proc., § 220.)\n       Masterson first emphasized that in all cases, civil and criminal, ― ‗a party‘s\nattorney has general authority to control the procedural aspects of the litigation\nand, indeed, to bind the client in these matters . . . .‘ ‖ Counsel, not the client, ― ‗is\ncaptain of the ship.‘ ‖ (Masterson, supra, 8 Cal.4th 965, 969.)\n       Of course, an exception to this broad rule exists in criminal cases in which\nthe defendant has a state constitutional right to a jury trial that can only be\nexpressly and personally waived. (Masterson, supra, 8 Cal.4th 965, 969, citing\nCal. Const., art. I, § 16, & People v. Ernst (1994) 8 Cal.4th 441.) Masterson\nobserved, however, that a mental competence proceeding, though a byproduct of\nthe underlying criminal prosecution, is not itself a criminal action in which the\nstate constitutional requirement of an express personal waiver applies. Nor is it a\ncivil action. It is a ― ‗special proceeding‘ ‖ in which the right to trial by jury is\nwholly statutory. (Masterson, at p. 969; see Pen. Code, § 1369, subds. (a)-(f)\n[describing mental examinations, evidence, argument, and instructions in any\n―trial by court or jury of the question of mental competence‖].)\n       Against this backdrop, Masterson concluded that it ―need not decide‖\nwhether the statutory nature of the jury trial right in a criminal mental competence\nproceeding dictates the circumstances under which it can be waived, i.e., whether\nthere are some statutory rights that counsel may not waive on the client‘s behalf or\nover his objection. (Masterson, supra, 8 Cal.4th 965, 970.) Rather, the validity of\n                                           20\n\fcounsel‘s decision to dispense with a 12-person jury — like the larger question\nwhether to have a jury at all — rested primarily upon ―the nature of competency\nproceedings‖ and the issues addressed therein. (Id. at p. 971.)\n       Masterson then made the following key point: ―The sole purpose of a\ncompetency proceeding is to determine the defendant‘s present mental\ncompetence, i.e., whether the defendant is able to understand the nature of the\ncriminal proceedings and to assist counsel in a rational manner. [Citations.]\nBecause of this, the defendant necessarily plays a lesser personal role in the\nproceeding than in a trial of guilt. How can a person whose competence is in\ndoubt make basic decisions regarding the conduct of a proceeding to determine\nthat very question?‖ (Masterson, supra, 8 Cal.4th 965, 971.)\n       In answering this question adversely to the defendant, Masterson relied\nheavily on People v. Hill (1967) 67 Cal.2d 105 (Hill). In Hill, after both the trial\ncourt and defense counsel expressed doubt about an alleged felon‘s mental\ncompetence, a hearing was held in which the defendant received new counsel. For\nreasons not clear from record, the competence issue was tried by the court, not a\njury. The trial court found the defendant competent and he was later tried and\nconvicted of the charged crimes. Ultimately, in Hill, this court rejected the\ndefendant‘s claim that his convictions should be reversed because, in the\ncompetence proceeding, he had not personally waived a jury, or been advised\neither by the court or counsel of his right to request a jury trial.\n       As noted in Masterson, supra, 8 Cal.4th 965, 971, this court made clear in\nHill, supra, 67 Cal.2d 105, 114, that there is ―no duty in a judge‖ to advise the\ndefendant about his jury trial right in a mental competency proceeding, at least\nwhere he or she is represented by counsel. Also, Masterson observed, when the\npreliminary evidence is sufficient to trigger a mental competence hearing, ― ‗it\nshould be assumed that [the defendant] is unable to act in his own best interests.\n                                           21\n\fIn such circumstances counsel must be free to act even contrary to the express\ndesires of his client.‘ ‖ (Masterson, at p. 971, quoting Hill, at p. 115, fn. 4.)\nAccording to Masterson, it is settled that, ― ‗as a matter of tactics counsel may,\nwithout consulting defendant, waive defendant‘s statutory right to demand that a\njury decide his competence.‘ ‖ (Masterson, at p. 972, quoting People v. Samuel\n(1981) 29 Cal.3d 489, 496 [summarizing Hill].)\n       Accordingly, Masterson held that ―counsel may waive the right to a jury\ntrial in a competency proceeding, and the court need not advise the defendant of\nthat right.‖ (Masterson, supra, 8 Cal.4th 965, 972.) Hence, Masterson concluded,\nno error occurred insofar as counsel stipulated to a jury of 11 persons. It also\nmade no difference that the defendant in Masterson had personally opposed the\nstipulation in open court. In light of the initial doubts expressed about his mental\ncompetence (which the 11-person jury did not sustain), the defendant could not\n―veto‖ counsel‘s professional judgment or decisional authority in jury trial\nmatters. (Id. at p. 973.)16\n\n\n16      At one point, Masterson, supra, 8 Cal.4th 965, 972, linked its assumptions\nabout a criminal defendant‘s limited capacity to play a personal role in the\ncompetence hearing to what prior cases had called a ― ‗prima facie showing‘ ‖ of\nincompetence. More accurately, the Legislature contemplates that, in the\nunderlying criminal case, the trial court has entertained a ―doubt‖ on competence\n(Pen. Code, § 1368, subd. (a)) and/or counsel has expressed a similar ―belie[f].‖\n(Id., subd. (b).) Because due process bars any criminal defendant from being tried\nwhile mentally unsound, a competence hearing is required if ―substantial\nevidence‖ raises a ― ‗reasonable doubt‘ ‖on the issue. (People v. Lawley (2002) 27\nCal.4th 102, 131, and cases cited.) Of course, different procedures and formalities\naccompany a Welfare and Institutions Code section 6500 matter, which does not\nnecessarily arise out of, or have any connection to, a criminal case. This does not\nmean, however, that before any section 6500 trial, no substantial doubts have been\nraised about the person‘s cognitive condition, or that no evidentiary support for the\nallegations of mental retardation exists. As we shall explain, a section 6500\n                                                             (footnote continued on next page)\n\n                                           22\n\f        Not surprisingly, this court has determined that persons who are mentally\nimpaired for reasons other than those present in Masterson, supra, 8 Cal.4th 965,\nalso cannot ― ‗ ―act in [their] own best interests‖ ‘ ‖ when committed. (Id. at\np. 971.) (See, e.g., Hop, supra, 29 Cal.3d 82, 90-91 [developmentally disabled\nadult too incompetent to admit herself to a mental hospital was not competent to\nprotest or consent to hospitalization by third parties under the LDDSA, § 4825, for\npurposes of determining the voluntariness of the latter process]; Thorn v. Superior\nCourt (1970) 1 Cal.3d 666, 674-675 [persons with acute mental disorders\nrequiring involuntary 14-day treatment under the LPS Act, § 5250, lack the\ncapacity to comprehend their statutory rights, or to knowingly decide whether or\nnot to exercise them, and thus require the assistance of counsel].)\n        Similar logic applies here. No definition of mental retardation appears in\nsection 6500 or elsewhere in the statutory scheme. However, the Legislature has\nmade clear under a neighboring law, the LDDSA, that mental retardation — like\ncerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism — constitutes a ― ‗[d]evelopmental\ndisability.‘ ‖ (§ 4512, subd. (a).) As such, the condition ―originates before an\nindividual attains age 18 years, continues, or can be expected to continue,\nindefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for that individual.‖ (Ibid.)\n        More to the point, it is understood for section 6500 commitment purposes\nthat mental retardation involves ― ‗ ―significantly subaverage general intellectual\nfunctioning existing concurrently with deficits in adaptive behavior,‖ and\nappearing in the ―developmental period.‖ ‘ ‖ (Money, supra, 128 Cal.App.3d 378,\n\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\n\nproceeding begins, and commitment and placement hearings occur, based on\nverified information and mental evaluations from interested and informed parties.\n\n\n\n                                           23\n\f397, italics added [using ―generally accepted technical meaning‖ of mental\nretardation to hold § 6500 is not unconstitutionally vague]; accord, Cramer v.\nGillermina R. (1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 380, 387-388; see Heller, supra, 509 U.S.\n312, 321-325 [accepting premise of Kentucky commitment law, in dispute over\nconstitutional standard-of-proof requirements, that mental retardation is a\npermanent developmental and learning disability arising before adulthood].)\n       Of course, as Barrett suggests, a diagnosis of mental retardation can cover a\nrange of intellectual deficits and behavioral phenomena. (Money, supra, 128\nCal.App.3d 378, 397.) Still, the significant cognitive and intellectual deficits that\nthe condition entails, which appear early in life and never recede, affect the ability\nto ―make basic decisions‖ regarding the conduct of the section 6500 proceeding.\n(Masterson, supra, 8 Cal.4th 965, 971.) Such an individual thus plays a limited\n―personal role‖ in the case, and must rely on counsel to decide all tactical and\nprocedural matters, such as whether to exercise the jury trial right. (Ibid.)\n       Applying these circumstances to the due process principles discussed\nabove, we disagree with Barrett that ―the private interests at stake‖ play a\npredominant or dispositive role in the analysis. (Allen, supra, 44 Cal.4th 843,\n863.) We cannot ignore limits in a section 6500 proceeding on the person‘s ability\nto comprehend and control procedural matters, including the decision whether to\nexercise the right to a jury trial. It follows that the collateral procedures Barrett\nseeks, involving an express advisement and personal waiver, would have little\neffect on enhancing either the jury trial right itself or the vital interests it protects.\nHence, these factors do not weigh in favor of finding a constitutional violation to\nthe extent the requested procedures were not used at her commitment trial.\n       Barrett further suggests that such a conclusion violates due process because\nit improperly ―presumes‖ that a person is mentally retarded before the fact finder\nhas decided the issue. Again, we are not persuaded. As we explain, no section\n                                            24\n\f6500 proceeding is brought or pursued in an evidentiary vacuum or without\ncompetent support.\n       First, the filing of a section 6500 petition is requested by a responsible and\ninterested party (e.g., parent, conservator, correctional or probation official, or\nregional center director), who presents specific information (reasons) for\nsupposing that the person is mentally retarded and dangerous, in need of treatment,\nand eligible for commitment. The significance of this request, and its role in\nproviding a foundation for the petition and commitment process, is underscored by\nthe verification requirement. (§ 6502.) Here, the petition alleged that a request for\ncommitment was duly made by the Center, which provided Barrett with regular\ncare and support. In the process, the Center submitted assessments, evaluations,\nand reports necessary to support the allegations that Barrett was mentally retarded\nand dangerous. These documents were incorporated by reference into the petition\nand attached as an exhibit for the court‘s confidential use in the section 6500 case.\n       Second, where a section 6500 petition is filed, the trial court is entitled to a\nwritten report prepared by, or at the behest of, the director of the regional center,\nfollowing an examination of the alleged mentally retarded person. (§ 6504.5.)\nRegional centers specialize in assessing and assisting mentally retarded and other\ndevelopmentally disabled persons on an individual basis. (See ante, at p. 11,\nfn. 10.) Thus, the regional center report obviously serves as a professional pretrial\nevaluation of the person‘s history, condition, and behavior, and includes informed\nrecommendations on treatment and placement, including any interim placement\npending the hearing. According to the petition here, the Center supplied\nassessments, evaluations, and reports about Barrett in seeking to commit her as\nmentally retarded and dangerous under section 6500.\n       In light of these principles and authorities, we conclude that someone like\nBarrett, who is alleged to be mentally retarded and dangerous under section 6500,\n                                          25\n\fis not in a position to personally assert or waive the right to jury trial, to\nsufficiently comprehend the jury trial advisement, or to override the views of\ncounsel on the subject. Sole control over such tactical and procedural decisions\nrests with counsel, whether or not the client has been consulted or objects.\nMoreover, absent any requirement of a personal waiver, the person facing\ncommitment has no need for an express court advisement of the right to request a\njury trial. Thus, no fundamental interest requires us to hold that the nonjury trial\nin this case violated Barrett‘s due process rights insofar as the record does not\nshow that she personally declined a jury or was told of the right to request one.\n       We also agree with the People‘s related suggestion that the defense must\naffirmatively and timely request a jury trial, and that the apparent failure to do so,\nreflected by the lack of evidence in the record that such a request was made,\nresults in a valid and enforceable waiver. (See ante, at p. 16, fn. 15 [Code Civ.\nProc, § 631, subd. (d)].) As noted, a statutory right to counsel exists under\nWelfare and Institutions Code section 6500. Counsel is presumed competent and\ninformed as to applicable constitutional and statutory law. This presumption\nnecessarily includes the defense right to seek a jury trial in a section 6500\nproceeding, regardless of any court advisement. Counsel also can be expected,\nwhere necessary or advisable, to consult with the client about jury trial concerns.\n(See John L., supra, 48 Cal.4th 131, 154-156 [due process claim rejected on the\nbasis of similar assumptions that counsel consulted with the client in an LPS Act\nconservatorship proceeding under § 5350, and knowingly entered a binding waiver\nof any presence and trial rights by informing the court of the client‘s consent].) It\nfollows that where no defense request for a jury trial appears on the record, we can\nproperly infer that this omission and the ensuing bench trial were the product of an\ninformed tactical choice. Counsel has absolute authority to bind the client. (See\n\n\n                                           26\n\fMasterson, supra, 8 Cal.4th 965, 972-973.) No due process interest is served by\nrequiring counsel to expressly confirm any waiver of a jury trial in open court.\n       We further reject the contrary analysis in Alvas, supra, 221 Cal.App.3d\n1459, 1464-1465, on which Barrett relies. In Alvas, the Court of Appeal held that\na due process violation occurs, and that a section 6500 commitment following a\nnonjury trial is invalid, when the record fails to show that the person being\ncommitted received an express advisement and personally waived the right to a\njury trial. Alvas emphasized the need for a knowing and intelligent waiver of that\nright. In doing so, however, Alvas ignored the factors we deem most relevant —\nthe individual‘s limited ability to personally make a jury trial decision, counsel‘s\nsole authority to do so, and the lack of any need for a jury trial advisement in this\nregard. Insofar as People v. Alvas, supra, 221 Cal.App.3d 1459, is inconsistent\nwith these conclusions, it is disapproved.\n       Finally, Barrett suggests that, at the very least, only the most profound\ncognitive impairments should prevent someone undergoing a section 6500\nproceeding from being allowed to personally make the jury trial decision\nfollowing a court advisement. She seems to envision a cumbersome process in\nwhich the court holds (1) a pretrial evidentiary hearing on whether the person is so\nmentally retarded that counsel must handle all jury trial issues, and (2) a full-\nblown trial in which the fact finder (judge or jury) decides whether the person is so\nmentally retarded and dangerous as to warrant commitment.\n       However, when assessing competing due process concerns, courts are not\nblind to the ― ‗administrative burdens‘ ‖ and ―practical difficulties‖ of demanding\nnew procedures. (Moore, supra, 50 Cal.4th 802, 828, quoting Allen, supra, 44\nCal.4th 843, 867; see, e.g., Tilbury, supra, 54 Cal.3d 56, 69 [noting state‘s due\nprocess interest ―in avoiding the cost of unnecessary jury trials‖ in hearings for\n180-day outpatient placements for insanity acquittees under Pen. Code, § 1026.2].)\n                                          27\n\fNo statute guides the screening procedure suggested here, including the standards\nof mental retardation that might apply at each phase. To the extent significant\noverlap exists, we are reluctant to require duplicative hearings in the context of the\ncompact timeframe in which one-year commitments, and recommitments, occur.\n       Considering all of the relevant factors, we reject Barrett‘s due process\nchallenge to her nonjury trial. Nothing indicates that a valid waiver of her right to\ntrial by jury did not occur.\nB. Equal Protection Claim\n       Barrett argues that federal and state equal protection principles require\nsection 6500 proceedings to involve the same jury trial safeguards that apply under\nthe LPS Act to proceedings in which already confined patients who pose a\n―demonstrated danger‖ as a result of ―mental disorder or mental defect‖ may be\nretained for a further 180 days of intensive custodial treatment. (§ 5300, subds.\n(a)-(c); see § 5300 et seq. [postcertification procedures for imminently dangerous\npersons].) Specifically, under section 5302, the superior court must give an\n―advise[ment]‖ when the 180-day LPS Act proceeding begins that, among other\nthings, the patient has a statutory ―right to demand a jury trial‖ on the allegations\nof the petition. (Ibid.; see §§ 5301 [describing petition for postcertification\ntreatment], 5303 [authorizing ―requests [for] a jury trial‖ at the time of the hearing\non such petitions].)17 Barrett insists that persons who are allegedly mentally\n\n17      Section 5302 states: ―At the time of filing a petition for postcertification\ntreatment the court shall advise the person named in the petition of his right to be\nrepresented by an attorney and of his right to demand a jury trial. The court shall\nassist him in finding an attorney, or, if need be, appoint an attorney if the person is\nunable to obtain counsel. The court shall appoint the public defender or other\nattorney to represent the person named in the petition if the person is financially\nunable to provide his own attorney. The attorney shall advise the person of his\nrights in relation to the proceeding and shall represent him before the court.‖\n\n\n                                          28\n\fretarded and dangerous under section 6500 are no different for jury trial purposes\nfrom 180-day LPS Act candidates under section 5300 et seq. Relying heavily on\nthe equal protection analysis set forth in Alvas, supra, 221 Cal.App.3d 1459, 1463-\n1464, and followed by the same court in Bailie, supra, 144 Cal.App.4th 841, 844-\n847, Barrett claims no rational distinction exists between the two groups as to\ninvoluntary commitment, and no compelling reason for their disparate statutory\ntreatment on jury trial advisements.\n       Because of the fundamental interests at stake, equal protection principles\nare often invoked in civil commitment cases to ensure that the statutory scheme\napplicable to a particular class of persons has not treated them unfairly in\ncomparison with other groups with similar characteristics. (People v. McKee\n(2010) 47 Cal.4th 1172, 1199, and cases cited.) A prerequisite to a meritorious\nclaim is that individuals ―similarly situated with respect to the legitimate purpose\nof the law receive like treatment.‖ (Gary W., supra, 5 Cal.3d 296, 303; accord, In\nre Lemanuel C. (2007) 41 Cal.4th 33, 47; Cooley v. Superior Court (2002) 29\nCal.4th 228, 253.) Where two or more groups are properly distinguishable for\npurposes of the challenged law, it is immaterial if they are indistinguishable in\nother respects. (Cooley, supra, at p. 253.) Nor, absent this threshold requirement,\nis an equal protection inquiry into the justification for any legislative distinction\nnecessary. (See Gary W., at pp. 304, 306.)\n       Barrett offers no analysis of the language, history, or function of section\n5302 to facilitate the requisite constitutional comparison with jury trial procedures\nin section 6500 cases. She simply seems to assume for equal protection purposes\n— consistent with her views in the due process context — that the express\nadvisement in section 5302 is intended to ensure that dangerously disordered\npatients facing 180-day LPS Act commitments make an informed personal choice\nabout whether to exercise their right to request a jury trial under section 5303.\n                                          29\n\f         However, we need not decide the meaning or purpose of section 5302 to\nresolve whether equal protection requires a similar jury trial advisement in section\n6500 proceedings. Nor must we address the circumstances under which a 180-day\nLPS Act candidate may, either acting alone or through counsel, properly waive a\njury trial and submit to a court trial under section 5303. Assuming for argument‘s\nsake that Barrett‘s view of section 5302 is correct, and assuming further that\ndangerous mentally retarded persons and dangerous mentally disordered persons\nare similarly situated as to the existence of a basic jury trial right, nothing compels\nthe conclusion that they are also similarly situated as to the ancillary purpose that\nan express jury trial advisement, and an express personal waiver, purportedly\nserve.\n         As the People suggest, the critical factor is the distinct ―mentality‖ (§ 6507)\ncovered by the two schemes. Section 6500 et seq. governs commitments of\ndangerous mentally retarded persons, while the LPS Act is a comprehensive\nscheme for the involuntary detention, evaluation, and treatment of ―mentally ill‖\nindividuals. (Conservatorship of Susan T. (1994) 8 Cal.4th 1005, 1008\n(Susan T.).) For purposes of the LPS Act, such a mentally ill person is anyone\nwho, ―as a result of mental disorder, is a danger to others, or to himself or herself,\nor gravely disabled.‖ (§ 5150; see John L., supra, 48 Cal.4th 131, 142.)\nIntervention occurs on a limited basis through successive statutory periods which\nare initially quite brief (§ 5150 [72 hours]), and which are ―carefully calibrated‖ to\nincrease over time. (Ben C., supra, 40 Cal.4th 529, 541; see, e.g., §§ 5250 [14\ndays], 5270.15 [30 days], 5300 [180 days].) The process culminates in a one-year\nconservatorship (§ 5361) for persons who are ―gravely disabled‖ (§ 5350) as a\nresult of their mental disorders. (See § 5008, subd. (h)(1) & (2) [defining\n― ‗gravely disabled‘ ‖]; see id., subd. (h)(3) [excluding ―mentally retarded persons\nby reason of being mentally retarded alone‖].)\n                                           30\n\f       The term ―mental disorder‖ is not defined in any LPS Act provision.\n(People v. Allen (2007) 42 Cal.4th 91, 107, fn. 7.) Courts applying the LPS Act\nand similar commitment schemes have sought to fill this gap. Mental illness and\nrelated disorders are said to be conditions that may arise suddenly and, for the first\ntime, in adulthood. (Heller, supra, 509 U.S. 312, 322.) The LPS Act process\nitself assumes that the need for treatment may be temporary, and that disabling\nmental disorders may be intermittent or short-lived. (See Susan T., supra, 8\nCal.4th 1005, 1018 [―not every detention under section 5150 leads to a\nconservatorship proceeding‖].)\n       In addition, because of the complexity of human behavior, and the lack of a\nlong history in every case, mental illness and related disorders may be difficult to\ndiagnose. (Heller, supra, 509 U.S. 312, 322, citing Addington, supra, 441 U.S.\n418, 430.) Where present, however, ― ‗mental illness ―often strikes only limited\nareas of functioning, leaving other areas unimpaired, and consequently . . . many\nmentally ill persons retain the capacity to function in a competent manner.‖ ‘ ‖\n(In re Qawi (2004) 32 Cal.4th 1, 17, italics added [addressing circumstances in\nwhich mentally disordered offenders under Pen. Code, § 2960 et seq. have\nqualified rights similar to some LPS Act patients to refuse antipsychotic drugs].)\n       These characteristics suggest that the mental conditions that create\neligibility for an extended 180-day LPS Act commitment, though they include\nimminent dangerousness, do not necessarily imply incompetence or a reduced\nability to understand, and make decisions about, the conduct of the proceedings.\nHence, nothing compels the conclusion that such LPS Act patients will not benefit\nby the statutory right to a jury trial advisement set forth in section 5302. By\ncontrast, in the case of persons alleged to be mentally retarded and dangerous\nunder section 6500, the commitment process itself raises substantial doubts about\ntheir cognitive and intellectual functioning sufficient to limit the personal and\n                                          31\n\fprocedural role they play. It follows that the two groups are not similarly situated\nas to the function that Barrett implies an advisement like section 5302 serves —\ncomprehending and controlling the decision whether to request a jury trial. Thus,\nany disparate statutory treatment with respect to jury trial advisements does not\ndeprive persons like Barrett of equal protection of the law.\n       The equal protection analysis included in both People v. Alvas, supra, 221\nCal.App.3d 1459, 1463-1464, and People v. Bailie, supra, 144 Cal.App.4th 841,\n844-847, does not persuade us to reach different conclusions. In finding no valid\nbasis for any disparate statutory treatment as to jury trial advisements, both cases\nsimply assumed that section 6500 defendants are similarly situated with 180-day\nLPS Act candidates. This assumption is flawed and erroneous for reasons we have\nexplained. Hence, both Alvas and Bailie are disapproved to the extent they\nconflict with the views we have expressed.\n       We also reject a further insinuation in Barrett‘s equal protection claim. She\nsuggests that, in not expressly authorizing jury trials or requiring jury trial\nadvisements in section 6500 proceedings, even though several other commitment\nschemes include such rights, the Legislature has arbitrarily decided that alleged\nmentally retarded persons are unsuited to such protection, and has unfairly\nsubjected them to more burdensome procedures than persons facing commitment\nin almost any other circumstance. In essence, Barrett simply implies that if some\nsuch schemes include these provisions, then all must.\n       But an equal protection violation does not occur merely because different\nstatutory procedures have been included in different civil commitment schemes.\n(See Hofferber, supra, 28 Cal.3d 161, 172 [Legislature ―may adopt more than one\nprocedure for isolating, treating, and restraining dangerous persons‖].) Nothing\ncompels the state ―to choose between attacking every aspect of a problem or not\nattacking the problem at all.‖ (People v. Jennings (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 1301,\n                                           32\n\f1312-1313.) Far from having to ―solve all related ills at once‖ (People v. Cooper\n(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 815, 829), the Legislature has ―broad discretion‖ to\nproceed in an incremental and uneven manner without necessarily engaging in\narbitrary and unlawful discrimination. (People v. Ward (2005) 36 Cal.4th 186,\n217, citing McLaughlin v. Florida (1964) 379 U.S. 184, 191; Warden v. State Bar\nof California (1999) 21 Cal.4th 628, 649.)\n       Contrary to what Barrett implies, she has not been singled out for harsh and\nunfair treatment in this regard. Of the nine commitment procedures we have listed\nabove, a majority (including § 6500 et seq.) either do not reference jury trial\nmatters at all (such that a right to jury trial on request has been constitutionally\nimplied),18 or they say nothing about advisements or waivers of any jury trial right\notherwise provided therein.19 By the same token, variations in the other\n\n\n18    See section 4825, added by Statutes 1977, chapter 1252, section 550,\npage 4564, operative July 1, 1978; see also Hop, supra, 29 Cal.3d 82, 92-94.\n19      For example, in proceedings to commit narcotic addicts, whether they have\nbeen convicted of crimes (see § 3050 et seq.) or not convicted of crimes (see\n§ 3100 et seq.), section 3108 contemplates a ―written demand‖ to be ―tried by a\njury‖ under civil law, and a verdict ―by at least three-fourths of the jury.‖ (§ 3108,\nas amended by Stats. 1967, ch. 1124, § 13, p. 2970); but see People v. Thomas\n(1977) 19 Cal.3d 630, 641, 644 [holding that due process requires proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt and unanimous verdicts in § 3108 jury trials].) Another\napproach to the basic jury trial right is used to civilly commit sexually violent\npredators. (See § 6600 et seq.) Since that scheme‘s enactment in 1995, section\n6603 has stated that the defendant is ―entitled to a trial by jury‖ (§ 6603, subd.\n(a)), and that the ―attorney petitioning for commitment‖ also has ―the right to\ndemand that the trial be before a jury.‖ (Id., subd. (b); see id., subd. (e) [if neither\nparty demands a jury trial, ―the trial shall be before the court without a jury‖].)\nElsewhere, in proceedings to determine the mental competence of criminal\ndefendants, Penal Code section 1369 simply authorizes a ―trial by court or jury,‖\nand regulates the content and chronology of such trials. (See Pen. Code, former\n§ 1369, as amended by Stats. 1974, ch. 1511, § 5, p. 3318, eff. Sept. 27, 1974.)\n\n\n                                          33\n\fcommitment schemes suggest no uniform set of jury trial procedures exists or was\nwithheld from Barrett.20 There is nothing unusual or unconstitutional about the\nmanner in which these statutes have evolved over time.\n\n\n\n\n20      See sections 1801.5 (contemplating jury trials in proceedings under § 1800\net seq. to detain disordered and dangerous persons upon discharge from the\njuvenile system, unless the right to jury trial is personally waived by the person,\nafter being fully advised of the waived rights, and by the prosecuting attorney),\n5302 (requiring that in LPS Act proceedings to extend custodial treatment to 180\ndays for imminently dangerous and disordered persons, the court must advise the\nperson of the right to demand a jury trial); Penal Code, section 1026.5, subdivision\n(b)(3), (4) (providing that in proceedings to extend commitment and treatment of\ndisordered and dangerous persons found not guilty by reason of insanity in felony\ncases, the court must advise the person of the right to jury trial, and that any\nwaiver must be by both the person and the prosecuting attorney), Penal Code,\nsection 2972, subdivisions (a) and (e) (establishing that in proceedings to continue\ncommitment and treatment of mentally disordered and dangerous prisoners, the\ncourt must advise the person of the right to jury trial, and that any waiver must be\nby both the person and the district attorney).\n\n\n                                        34\n\f       For all of the foregoing reasons, Barrett has not presented a meritorious\nequal protection challenge to the statutory jury trial procedures available under\nsection 6500 compared to other commitment schemes. We decline to invalidate\nthe commitment order entered after her nonjury trial on this ground.21\n\n\n\n\n21      In separate concurring and dissenting opinions, Justices Liu and Werdegar\nlikewise approve the commitment order, but only after crafting their own\nconstitutional theory of equal protection — a theory which contravenes settled law\nand undercuts the Legislature‘s decision not to require jury trial advisements in\nsection 6500 proceedings. Justices Liu and Werdegar are aware that we have\ncorrectly applied the United States Supreme Court‘s prevailing ―rational basis‖\nstandard for analyzing the equal protection claims of mentally retarded persons.\n(Heller, supra, 509 U.S. 312, 319-321.) Nonetheless, though Justice Liu argues\notherwise, he and Justice Werdegar use the jury trial advisement statutorily\navailable to certain mentally ill patients facing extended 180-day commitments\nunder the LPS Act (see § 5302) to create a new state constitutional jury trial\nadvisement right for mentally retarded persons. Their reason for invoking the\nstate charter is to import federal authority that is outmoded in this context\n(Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc. (1985) 473 U.S. 432), and to thereby\nfind an equal protection violation under an unduly strict standard of scrutiny. (See\nid. at pp. 448, 450.) The standard they propose was, of course, superseded, and\nessentially discarded, in Heller, supra, 509 U.S. at page 321. Ironically, the views\nset forth at length in the concurring and dissenting opinions result in little real-\nworld benefit to Barrett, and, as Justice Liu appears to concede, the right to a jury\ntrial advisement for which he and Justice Werdegar advocate is largely symbolic.\nTheir analyses include the concession, either express or implicit, that Barrett was\nnot necessarily entitled to act on such a direct advisement by personally deciding\nwhether to demand a jury. Moreover, they conclude that to the extent Barrett\nreceived no such advisement, no prejudice occurred in light of undisputed\nevidence that she was both mentally retarded and dangerous. In sum, we find the\nconcurring and dissenting opinions unpersuasive, and we decline to adopt their\nviews or to modify our approach.\n\n\n\n                                         35\n\f                              IV. DISPOSITION\n      The judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed. To the extent the\nanalyses in People v. Alvas (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 1459, and People v. Bailie\n(2006) 44 Cal.App.4th 841, are inconsistent with the views expressed herein, these\ndecisions are disapproved.\n                                               BAXTER, J.\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\nCANTIL-SAKAUYE, C. J.\nKENNARD, J.\nCHIN, J.\nCORRIGAN, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                       36\n\f    CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION BY WERDEGAR, J.\n\n       I agree with the majority‘s conclusion that defendant Christine Barrett was\nentitled to have a jury decide whether the state had proven she met the statutory\nstandards for involuntary commitment under Welfare and Institutions Code\nsection 6500.1 (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 14.) But the majority‘s next step in its\nanalysis is unpersuasive: it finds that although mentally ill persons facing\ninvoluntary civil commitment under the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (§ 5000 et\nseq.) are entitled by statute to have the court advise them ―of [their] right to\ndemand a jury trial‖ (§ 5302), persons—like Barrett—who are alleged to be\nmentally retarded and a danger to themselves or others who similarly face\ninvoluntary civil commitment are not entitled to the same jury advisement. As\nJustice Liu explains in his separate opinion, the differences between mentally ill\npersons and those alleged to be mentally retarded ―do not support a categorical\ndistinction between the two groups with respect to a jury right advisement.‖\n(Conc. & dis. opn. of Liu, J., post, at p. 21.)\n       Article I, section 24 of the California Constitution provides that ―[r]ights\nguaranteed by this Constitution are not dependent on those guaranteed by the\nUnited States Constitution.‖ The California Constitution is thus a document of\nindependent force, and the people of this state are not dependent on the United\n\n\n1      All statutory references are to this code.\n\n\n\n                                            1\n\fStates Constitution as the primary source of their protection. (See, e.g., People v.\nMonge (1997) 16 Cal.4th 826, 847, 871 (dis. opn. of Werdegar, J.) [―good reasons\nexist to rely on our state Constitution even before we consider whether the federal\nConstitution applies‖].) I thus agree with the approach taken by my colleague\nJustice Liu, in his separate opinion, relying on the state equal protection guarantee\nin article I, section 7 of the California Constitution, which provides that ―[a]\nperson may not be . . . denied equal protection of the laws . . . .‖ As he explains\n(conc. & dis. opn. of Liu, J., post, at p. 44), this court‘s landmark decision in\nSerrano v. Priest (1976) 18 Cal.3d 728 made clear that our state equal protection\nclause is ―possessed of an independent vitality which, in a given case, may\ndemand an analysis different from that which would obtain if only the federal\nstandard were applicable.‖ (Id. at p. 764.)\n       A critical first step when determining whether Barrett has a state equal\nprotection right to an advisement of her jury trial right is to discern the appropriate\nequal protection standard, or level of scrutiny, applicable in the case. We recently\nexplained in Hernandez v. City of Hanford (2007) 41 Cal.4th 279, 298-299, that\nthe first level of scrutiny ― ‗ ―is the basic and conventional standard for reviewing\neconomic and social welfare legislation in which there is a ‗discrimination‘ or\ndifferentiation of treatment between classes or individuals. . . .‖ ‘ [Citation.] This\nfirst basic equal protection standard generally is referred to as the ‗rational\nrelationship‘ or ‗rational basis‘ standard.‖ But while the rational basis test under\nthe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution has been applied to\neconomic and social welfare legislation (see FCC v. Beach Communications,\nInc. (1993) 508 U.S. 307 [applying the rational basis test to uphold a portion of the\nCable Communications Policy Act of 1984]; Warden v. State Bar (1999) 21\nCal.4th 628 [applying the rational basis test to reject a challenge to exemptions\nfrom minimum continuing legal education for retired judges, state officers and\n\n                                           2\n\felected officials]), that highly deferential test is inappropriate here, where Barrett\nfaces involuntary civil commitment under section 6500. This serious curtailment\nof her personal liberty, along with the stigma that attaches upon being found both\nmentally retarded and dangerous,2 justifies a heightened standard in these\ncircumstances, and for the reasons he explains, I agree with Justice Liu that the\nstate constitutional protection of article I, section 7, in this context, should be\ninformed by the high court‘s decision in Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc.\n(1985) 473 U.S. 432. (See conc. & dis. opn. of Liu, J., post, at pp. 34-35; see\ngenerally id., pt. V.)\n       The majority justifies its decision to distinguish between persons who are\nmentally ill and those who are mentally retarded in part by suggesting that because\nBarrett is alleged to be unable to care for herself, we should assume her attorney\nwill act in her best interests (maj. opn., ante, at pp. 21-23); that due to Barrett‘s\nalleged mental deficits she would necessarily play a limited role in her defense (id.\nat p. 24); and that a personal jury advisement requirement ―would have little effect\non enhancing either the jury trial right itself or the vital interests it protects‖\n(ibid.). Such reasoning fails to acknowledge that those suffering from mental\nretardation exhibit a wide range of abilities: ―they range from those whose\ndisability is not immediately evident to those who must be constantly cared for.‖\n(Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., supra, 473 U.S. at p. 442.) More\n\n2       See, e.g., U.S. v. Davis (D.Md. 2009) 611 F.Supp.2d 472, 483 (parents\nresist having their children labeled mentally retarded ―because of the stigma\nassociated with it‖); State v. Vela (2010) 279 Neb. 94, 129 [777 N.W.2d 266, 293]\n(―We are aware that a social stigma exists with respect to the phrase ‗mental\nretardation.‘ ‖); In re Daniel D. (R.I. 2010) 9 A.3d 651, 652, fn. 1 (noting ―the\nState of Rhode Island recently has endeavored to eliminate use of the word\n‗retarded‘ and like terms in an effort to address the unfortunate stigma attached to\ndevelopmental disabilities‖).\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\fimportantly, the majority‘s reasoning fails to accord sufficient respect to the rights\nof the mentally disabled, as directed by our Legislature as a matter of state policy\nin section 4502, which states: ―Persons with developmental disabilities have the\nsame legal rights and responsibilities guaranteed all other individuals by the\nUnited States Constitution and laws and the Constitution and laws of the State of\nCalifornia.‖ The same section provides: ―It is the intent of the Legislature that\npersons with developmental disabilities shall have rights including, but not limited\nto, the following: [¶] . . . [¶] (j) A right to make choices in their own lives,\nincluding, but not limited to, where and with whom they live, their relationships\nwith people in their community, the way they spend their time, including\neducation, employment, and leisure, the pursuit of their personal future, and\nprogram planning and implementation.‖ (Ibid.)\n       Accordingly, a legal scheme in which Barrett may be forced to live in an\ninstitution, against her will and possibly for the rest of her life, without being told\nshe could have had a jury decide her fate, when the state requires a jury\nadvisement for mentally ill persons facing essentially the same type of\ncommitment (§ 5302), lacks a rational basis and thus violates Barrett‘s right to\nequal protection under the California Constitution.\n       Unlike the United States Constitution, the California Constitution specifies\nthe conditions that must be present before a judgment is reversed. Article VI,\nsection 13 of the California Constitution states: ―No judgment shall be set aside,\nor new trial granted, in any cause . . . for any error as to any matter of procedure,\nunless, after an examination of the entire cause, including the evidence, the court\nshall be of the opinion that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of\njustice.‖ Like Justice Liu, I conclude that the violation of Barrett‘s rights under\nthe state equal protection clause was harmless because it was not reasonably\nprobable she would have achieved a more favorable result had the trial court\n\n                                           4\n\finformed her of her jury trial right. (People v. Watson (1956) 46 Cal.2d 818,\n836.)3 Although I disagree with the majority‘s reasoning, I thus concur in its\nresult.\n\n                                                   WERDEGAR, J.\n\n\n\n\n3       The majority criticizes the reasoning of the separate opinions, saying it is\n―[i]ronic[],‖ ―largely symbolic,‖ and ―result[s] in little real-world benefit to\nBarrett.‖ (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 35, fn. 21.) To the contrary, although Barrett has\nnot demonstrated prejudice resulting from the trial court‘s failure to advise her of\nher jury trial right in the commitment hearing at issue here, she may be able to do\nso in the future if she is recommitted and the error recurs. Moreover, were the\nmajority to endorse, as I do, the state equal protection analysis set forth in Justice\nLiu‘s separate opinion, potential committees in the future would benefit from the\njury trial advisement, thereby fulfilling the statutory directive that such persons\nhave the ―right to make choices in their own lives, including, but not limited to,\nwhere and with whom they live.‖ (§ 4502, subd. (j).)\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\f          CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION BY LIU, J.\n\n       To most people who are thrust into a courtroom, the whir and din of the\nlegal process make for a bewildering experience. Counsel is necessary, but even\ndiligent representation does not always ensure due regard for the dignity of a\nvulnerable yet dangerous individual whose liberty is at stake.\n       In this case, a young woman, Christine Barrett, was found mentally\nretarded and dangerous by a judge, and she was ordered committed to a secure\ntreatment facility. Barrett was not charged with any crime, and the record does not\nshow any criminal history. The order of commitment was for one year, but it is\nrenewable year after year without limit. In all likelihood, the commitment\nproceeding has irreversibly altered the course of her life. And yet, there is no\nindication in the record of the proceedings that the trial court spoke directly to\nBarrett about her rights or any other substantive matter.\n       The trial court found that Barrett, in addition to having mental retardation,\nalso suffered from mental illness. If Barrett had faced prolonged involuntary\ncommitment on the basis of mental illness instead of mental retardation, she would\nhave been statutorily entitled to an advisement by the court of her right to be tried\nby a jury. Barrett contends that the Legislature‘s selectivity — requiring the\nadvisement for mentally ill persons but denying it to persons alleged to be\nmentally retarded — proceeds from the objectionable premise that persons in her\nposition are unworthy of an advisement. As stated in her opening brief, she brings\n\n\n\n                                          1\n\fan equal protection challenge to this disparate treatment on the ground that ―there\nis no justification for depriving all people identified with having an intellectual or\ndevelopmental disability from the opportunity to learn of the right to a jury trial,\nand to act on the information in accordance with their individual abilities.‖\n       I agree with Barrett. Although due process principles do not require\ninvoluntary commitment procedures to include a jury trial advisement either for\npersons who are mentally ill or for persons alleged to be mentally retarded, the\nstatutory requirement of an advisement for one but not the other is unsupported by\nany facts or findings in the record before us. It is supported only by hypothesized\ndifferences concerning the relative abilities of the two groups to understand an\nadvisement. To be sure, many potential committees who are alleged to be\nmentally retarded have disabilities that preclude any meaningful comprehension of\na jury trial advisement. But that is not true of all such persons. Applying our state\nequal protection guarantee (Cal. Const., art. I, § 7, subd. (a)) as informed by\nfederal constitutional precedent (Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc. (1985)\n473 U.S. 432 (Cleburne)), I conclude that there is no rational basis for denying\nBarrett — simply because she was alleged to be mentally retarded — the same\nadvisement and the same dignity afforded by such an advisement to which other\npersons with mental disabilities are statutorily entitled when facing prolonged\ninvoluntary commitment.\n       Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the court‘s denial of Barrett‘s\nequal protection claim. The court says I would ―create a new state constitutional\njury trial advisement right for mentally retarded persons.‖ (Maj. opn., ante, at\np. 35, fn. 21.) To be clear, my view is not that persons with mental retardation\nhave a free-standing constitutional right to an advisement. As explained below,\nmy view is that persons with mental retardation are, on the record before us,\nconstitutionally entitled to the same statutory advisement right that the Legislature\n\n                                           2\n\fhas seen fit to provide to other persons with mental disabilities. But because I\nagree with the Court of Appeal that any failure to advise was harmless under the\ncircumstances here, I concur in the court‘s affirmance of the judgment below.\n\n\n                                          I.\n       Christine Barrett was 27 years old and living in a private residence under\nthe care of the San Andreas Regional Center (Regional Center) when the district\nattorney filed a petition under Welfare and Institutions Code section 6500 to\ncommit her as a person who is ―mentally retarded‖ and ―a danger to herself and\nothers.‖ (All undesignated statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions\nCode.) The petition was filed at the request of Betty Crane, the Regional Center‘s\nservice coordinator. The district attorney requested an evidentiary hearing and an\norder that Barrett be committed to the custody of the Department of\nDevelopmental Services (Department) for up to one year. The petition\nincorporated by reference a declaration from Crane along with ―the assessment,\nevaluations, reports, and other documents‖ of the Regional Center. These were\nfiled with the superior court, and we are treating them as confidential exhibits at\nthe request of the parties. The reports attached to the petition are the only expert\nreports that appear in the record before us; no further reports were submitted by\nthe parties or obtained by the court pursuant to its authority under section 6504.5\nto order a report by the director of the regional center or the director‘s designee.\n       The petition was filed on January 22, 2009. On that date, the court set a\nhearing for March 9, 2009, and placed Barrett under the Department‘s care\npending resolution of the petition. Counsel for both parties appeared on March 9,\nand the matter was continued to April 8 for an evidentiary hearing. The only\nrecord of that hearing is a printed minute order with no substantive information. It\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\fis not clear whether Barrett was present or received any information at that time\nabout the proceeding or her rights therein.\n       The proceedings resumed on April 8, 2009, in the presence of Barrett and\ncounsel for both parties. The district attorney‘s sole witness was Dr. Robert\nThomas, a psychologist for the Regional Center. Dr. Thomas testified that Barrett\nhad been previously diagnosed with mental retardation and that she fell within the\nmoderate range of mental retardation with an estimated IQ ―[i]n the 50‘s to 40‘s.‖\nAlthough he did not conduct a formal cognitive assessment of Barrett, Dr. Thomas\nbased his opinion of Barrett‘s mental retardation on her case file, which included\nschool documents, psychological assessments, and medical documents with results\nof cognitive tests. He also based his opinion on the fact that Barrett, though\ninitially deemed ineligible for Regional Center services, was accepted for such\nservices in 2001 upon a second review of her case. Dr. Thomas said he personally\nevaluated Barrett once, during a visit to her apartment, and said he found it ―very\ndifficult to have a normal reciprocal conversation with her.‖\n       Dr. Thomas further testified that Barrett had also been diagnosed with a\nrange of psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and\nschizoaffective disorder. He said that individuals like Barrett with a dual\ndiagnosis of mental illness and mental retardation do not always receive the\ntreatment and supervision they need at the Regional Center because the staff there\nis trained to address mental retardation, not to provide psychiatric treatment.\n       In addition, Dr. Thomas testified that Barrett was a danger to herself and\nothers based on his review of 20 to 30 incident reports dating back to 2001. He\nsaid those reports included numerous accounts of violent behavior, including\nphysical assaults on Regional Center staff, destruction of property, and self-\nmutilation. Dr. Thomas also said that ―[s]he has threatened suicide and verbalized\nsuicidal thoughts‖ based on one of the incident reports. Although Dr. Thomas\n\n                                          4\n\fcould not describe the severity of each incident based on the reports, he testified\nthat Barrett had the potential to cause serious injury to herself and to others\nbecause of her inability to control her aggression.\n       When asked whether Barrett‘s mental illness or her mental retardation was\nthe cause of her dangerous behavior, Dr. Thomas said her mental retardation\nlimited her ability ―to understand the complexity of her disorder and the need for\ntreatment.‖ But he also said that given the extent of Barrett‘s mental and\ndevelopmental disorders, ―it would be very difficult to differentiate what behavior\nis attributed to what particular disorder.‖ Dr. Thomas opined that the least\nrestrictive placement for Barrett was commitment to the secure treatment facility\nwhere she had been placed pending disposition of the section 6500 petition.\n       Barrett testified on her own behalf. She spoke about her current placement,\nstating a clear preference for placement in a group home rather than the secure\nfacility. She testified that she was taking medication that left her mind ―clearer‖\nand helped her to stay calm. The record contains no indication that her attorney or\nthe court inquired into her ability to comprehend the proceedings or the rights to\nwhich she was entitled. But Barrett made clear that she wanted to make her own\nliving and medical decisions: ―[I]f I had a choice in life I‘d have a choice to have\nmy freedom and I‘d have a choice to talk to my doctor.‖\n       Based on the testimony and reports, the trial court found that Barrett was\nmentally retarded and dangerous under section 6500, and committed her to the\ncustody of the Department for one year. The court acknowledged that ―Ms.\nBarrett presents a complex situation‖ in light of ―a series of mental health\ndiagnoses, many of which seem to be overlapping depending on various times.‖\nThe court concluded that her dangerousness is ―based upon mental retardation‖\nand ―may also have an element of being based on her mental illness.‖\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\f       The record does not show that the court directly addressed Barrett at any\npoint in the proceedings to explain any rights she might have under state or federal\nlaw, including the right to trial by jury. Among other things, Barrett contends that\nthe court‘s failure to advise her of the right to demand a jury trial violates the\nprinciple of equal protection of the laws.\n                                          II.\n       California has a panoply of statutes providing for the involuntary\ncommitment of individuals who pose a threat to themselves and others. As we\nrecently observed, ―[d]ecisions by this court and the United States Supreme Court\n. . . have used the equal protection clause to police civil commitment statutes to\nensure that a particular group of civil committees is not unfairly or arbitrarily\nsubjected to greater burdens.‖ (People v. McKee (2010) 47 Cal.4th 1172, 1199\n[collecting cases].)\n       Most of California‘s civil commitment statutes apply to persons who have\nbeen accused or convicted of a crime. (See §§ 1800 et seq. [mentally disordered\noffenders discharged by juvenile authorities], 3000 et seq. [narcotics addicts],\n6600 et seq. [sexually violent predators]; Pen. Code, §§ 1026–1027 [defendants\nacquitted by reason of insanity]; Pen. Code, § 1367 [defendants found mentally\nincompetent]; Pen., Code § 2960 et seq. [mentally disordered offenders].) Only\ntwo involuntary commitment schemes — the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (LPS\nAct) (§ 5300 et seq.) and section 6500 — authorize the state to assert prolonged\ncustody over individuals through proceedings completely separate from the\njuvenile and criminal justice systems. Section 5300 authorizes the commitment of\ncertain mentally ill persons for 180 days upon a finding of dangerousness. Section\n6500 authorizes a renewable one-year commitment for persons found to be\nmentally retarded and dangerous. Neither statute requires the state to show or\ncharge criminal conduct.\n\n                                             6\n\f         In framing her equal protection claim, Barrett contrasts the procedures for a\n180-day commitment under the LPS Act with the procedures for a one-year\ncommitment under section 6500. The LPS Act expressly recognizes a right to a\njury trial (§§ 5302, 5303) and says ―the court shall advise the person named in the\npetition . . . of his right to demand a jury trial‖ (§ 5302). Section 6500, by\ncontrast, does not mention the right to a jury trial or contain any advisement\nrequirement.\n         Today‘s opinion confirms that an individual facing commitment under\nsection 6500 has the right to trial by jury. (Maj. opn., ante, at pp. 14–15.) The\ncourt endorses ―a long and unbroken line of California appellate court cases\nholding or assuming — largely on the basis of federal and state equal protection\nprinciples affecting fundamental interests — that persons alleged to be mentally\nretarded and dangerous cannot be denied a jury trial altogether where jury trials\nare granted by statute to persons alleged to be mentally impaired and dangerous\nunder comparable commitment laws.‖ (Id. at p. 14.) I join this holding of the\ncourt.\n         The question here is whether persons facing commitment under section\n6500 are also entitled, as a matter of equal protection, to the same advisement of\nthe right to trial by jury that is guaranteed to persons facing commitment under\nsection 5300. It is on this question that I disagree with the court‘s opinion.\n         Barrett additionally contends that section 5302‘s advisement requirement\nmeans that the decision to waive a jury trial must be made personally by the\nindividual facing commitment under the LPS Act and that this right to personal\nwaiver extends to section 6500 proceedings as a matter of equal protection. The\ncourt does not decide whether a right to personal waiver inheres in section 5302\n(maj. opn., ante, at p. 30), and I also see no need to decide that issue. Separate and\napart from a right to personal waiver, a jury trial advisement has important value\n\n                                           7\n\fto an individual facing involuntary commitment in at least two ways. First, an\nadvisement may prompt the individual to discuss jury trial concerns with counsel\nif she is able. Even if counsel can be expected to consult with the client about\nsuch concerns when counsel believes it is ―necessary or advisable‖ (maj. opn.,\nante, at p. 26), an advisement by the court may have the practical effect of\nempowering the individual, at her own initiative, to participate in the decision with\ncounsel. Second, an advisement conveys respect for the individual‘s\nunderstanding of and interest in a key issue — who will be the decision maker,\njudge or jury? — in a proceeding that may inalterably shape the trajectory of her\nlife. In short, an advisement recognizes the dignity and agency of the individual\nwho appears before the court.\n       In addressing Barrett‘s equal protection claim, I begin in part III below by\ndiscussing at some length the troubled history of our nation‘s and our state‘s\ntreatment of persons with mental disabilities. In part IV, I discuss the\nshortcomings of the court‘s analysis of Barrett‘s claim. In part V, I elucidate the\nproper standard of equal protection review and apply it to the statutory\nclassification at issue here.\n       As my analysis will make clear, the issue in this case is not whether people\nwho are mentally retarded generally have less cognitive ability than people who\nare mentally ill. Barrett‘s claim specifically concerns the ability to understand a\njury trial advisement and involves a specific comparison between two groups:\nmentally ill persons facing 180-day commitment under section 5300 and persons\nalleged to be mentally retarded under section 6500. In light of historic and\ncontinuing misperceptions concerning the ability of persons who are mentally\nretarded to understand and influence their own fate, I believe the requirement of a\njury trial advisement for persons facing commitment under section 5300, but not\n\n\n\n                                          8\n\ffor persons facing commitment under section 6500, does not survive equal\nprotection scrutiny.\n                                          III.\n       To fully appreciate the nature of a section 6500 proceeding and the context\nof Barrett‘s claim, it is helpful to begin with some history. Civil proceedings\nagainst individuals alleged to be mentally retarded and dangerous have long been\nthought necessary to protect society as well as the individual involved. But such\nproceedings also have a regrettably long history of abuse.\n                                           A.\n       This history is familiar to those trained in the law. For it was Justice\nHolmes‘s infamous opinion for the high court in Buck v. Bell (1927) 274 U.S. 200\nthat upheld a Virginia statute authorizing the compulsory ―sterilization of mental\ndefectives.‖ (Id. at p. 205.) That category included Carrie Buck, whom the court\ndescribed as ―a feeble-minded white woman‖ who was ―the daughter of a feeble-\nminded mother‖ and ―the mother of an illegitimate feeble-minded child.‖ (Ibid.)\nEchoing the eugenics theories popular at the time, Justice Holmes reasoned: ―We\nhave seen more than once that the public welfare may call upon the best citizens\nfor their lives. It would be strange if it could not call upon those who already sap\nthe strength of the State for these lesser sacrifices, often not felt to be such by\nthose concerned, in order to prevent our being swamped with incompetence. It is\nbetter for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for\ncrime, or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are\nmanifestly unfit from continuing their kind. The principle that sustains\ncompulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the Fallopian tubes.\n[Citation.] Three generations of imbeciles are enough.‖ (Id. at p. 207.) With the\nhigh court‘s endorsement, Virginia officials forcibly sterilized Buck along with\n8,300 other inmates of state mental institutions between 1927 and 1974, when the\n\n                                           9\n\flaw was finally repealed. (See Lombardo, Three Generations, No Imbeciles:\nEugenics, the Supreme Court, and Buck v. Bell (2008) p. 294 (Lombardo).)\n       The high court‘s eight-to-one decision in Buck v. Bell reflected then\nprevalent attitudes toward persons with mental disabilities. Twenty-five states,\nincluding Virginia, had sterilization laws in place at the time Buck v. Bell was\ndecided, and seven others followed suit by 1937. (Lombardo, supra, at p. 294; see\nibid. [citing a 1965 study finding that more than 65,000 Americans were sterilized\nunder such laws].) It is tempting to say, from our contemporary perspective, that\nsuch laws were the product of unthinking prejudice and blatant disregard for the\nrights of the individuals affected. But to their proponents, the sterilization laws\nhad a genuinely benign purpose as an alternative to civil confinement. As the\nVirginia Supreme Court explained in Buck‘s case: ―Unless sterilized by surgical\noperation, she must be kept in the custodial care of the [State Colony for\nEpileptics and Feeble-Minded] for thirty years, until she is sterilized by nature,\nduring which time she will be a charge upon the State. If sterilized under the law,\nshe could be given her liberty and secure a good home, under supervision, without\ninjury to society. Her welfare and that of society would be promoted by such\nsterilization.‖ (Buck v. Bell (Va. 1925) 130 S.E. 516, 517–518, affd. (1927) 274\nU.S. 200.)\n       Moreover, the Virginia statute was not devoid of procedural safeguards.\n(See Buck v. Bell, supra, 274 U.S. at p. 206 [noting ―the very careful provisions by\nwhich the act protects the patients from possible abuse‖].) The high court\ndescribed the statute‘s protections as follows: ―The superintendent [of the State\nColony for Epileptics and Feeble-Minded] first presents a petition to the special\nboard of directors of his hospital or colony, stating the facts and the grounds for\nhis opinion, verified by affidavit. Notice of the petition and of the time and place\nof the hearing in the institution is to be served upon the inmate, and also upon his\n\n                                          10\n\fguardian, and if there is no guardian the superintendent is to apply to the Circuit\nCourt of the County to appoint one. If the inmate is a minor notice also is to be\ngiven to his parents, if any, with a copy of the petition. The board is to see to it\nthat the inmate may attend the hearings if desired by him or his guardian. The\nevidence is all to be reduced to writing, and after the board has made its order for\nor against the operation, the superintendent, or the inmate, or his guardian, may\nappeal to the Circuit Court of the County. The Circuit Court may consider the\nrecord of the board and the evidence before it and such other admissible evidence\nas may be offered, and may affirm, revise, or reverse the order of the board and\nenter such order as it deems just. Finally any party may apply to the Supreme\nCourt of Appeals, which, if it grants the appeal, is to hear the case upon the record\nof the trial in the Circuit Court and may enter such order as it thinks the Circuit\nCourt should have entered.‖ (Id. at pp. 206–207.)\n       Although the statute did not include a right to counsel, the protections it did\nafford led the high court to conclude that ―[t]here can be no doubt that so far as\nprocedure is concerned the rights of the patient are most carefully considered.‖\n(Buck v. Bell, supra, 274 U.S. at p. 207.) And yet, careful scholars of Buck‘s life\nhave come to the conclusion that neither she nor her daughter Vivian was ―feeble-\nminded‖ at all. (See Lombardo, supra, at p. 139 [citing school records showing\nBuck ―was a normal child‖]; Brunius, Better for All the World: The Secret\nHistory of Forced Sterilization and America‘s Quest for Racial Purity (2006)\npp. 76–77 [Vivian completed four semesters of school and made the honor roll\nbefore her death at age eight]; Smith & Nelson, The Sterilization of Carrie Buck\n(1989) p. 194 [reviewing letters written by Buck after her discharge from the\nColony and concluding that ―neither mother or daughter was illiterate despite\nOliver Wendell Holmes‘ comments‖].) Instead, it appears that Buck‘s real\n―deficiency‖ was that she was an unwed mother, likely as a result of rape, and this\n\n                                          11\n\fwas a point of embarrassment and shame for Buck‘s foster parents, who filed a\npetition supporting Buck‘s sterilization. (See Lombardo, supra, at pp. 139–140;\nBrunius, supra, at pp. 51–53; Smith & Nelson, supra, at p. 5.)\n       Although the doctrinal underpinnings of Buck v. Bell have been eroded (see\nSkinner v. Oklahoma (1942) 316 U.S. 535), the case remains a cautionary tale in\ntwo respects. First, although state intervention into the lives of individuals with\nmental disabilities has often been rationalized on the ground that it is for their own\ngood or the good of society, unfounded assumptions of incapacity and a legacy of\npaternalism have resulted in serious ―depriv[ations] of . . . basic liberty‖ with\n―subtle, far-reaching and devastating effects.‖ (Skinner, at p. 541.) Second, even\nwhere such intervention is not inherently unlawful, laws directed at controlling\nindividuals with mental disabilities have been prone to overbroad application\ndespite what appear to be ―very careful provisions . . . protect[ing] the patients\nfrom possible abuse‖ (Buck v. Bell, supra, 274 U.S. at p. 206).\n                                          B.\n       California was not immune to the eugenics theories underlying the Virginia\nlegislation at issue in Buck v. Bell. Indeed, by some accounts, California was a\npioneer. During the first half of the 20th century, California‘s approach to persons\nwho were mentally ill or developmentally disabled centered on institutionalizing\nsuch individuals or otherwise isolating them from the rest of society. A broad\nrange of individuals deemed ―feeble-minded‖ or mentally deficient were subject to\nsterilization. As treatments for mental illness advanced, California made efforts to\ndifferentiate mental conditions viewed as treatable from those viewed as\nhereditary or immutable. Over time, isolation and warehousing gradually gave\nway to treatment and habilitation. In the 1960s, the Legislature enacted\nsubstantive and procedural limits on the state‘s authority to commit individuals\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\fwith mental illness. Protections for persons with mental retardation followed the\nsame general trajectory but lagged behind those afforded to the mentally ill.\n       In 1909, California became the third state in the nation to pass a\nsterilization bill. (Stats. 1909, ch. 720, § 1, pp. 1093–1094; see Stern, Eugenic\nNation: Faults and Frontiers of Better Breeding in Modern America (2005) p. 99.)\nCalifornia‘s law was ―perhaps the most expansive legislation of all state acts\npermitting sterilization.‖ (Lombardo, supra, at p. 26.) It allowed ―any inmate‖ of\nany state hospital, the California Home for the Care and Training of Feeble-\nMinded Children, or any state prison to be ―asexualized‖ whenever a panel of\nmedical officials determined ―it would be beneficial and conducive to the benefit\nof the physical, mental or moral condition‖ of that individual. (Stats. 1909,\nch. 720, § 1, p. 1093.) Although the law applied only to prisoners who had been\nimprisoned ―at least two times for some sexual offense, or at least three times for\nany other crime‖ (id. at p. 1094), it placed no substantive limits on the sterilization\nof persons deemed ―feeble-minded.‖\n       The 1909 act was repealed in 1913 and replaced with legislation applying\nto three discrete groups. Before release or discharge, inmates of state hospitals for\nthe insane ―afflicted with hereditary insanity or incurable chronic mania or\ndementia‖ could be sterilized with or without their consent at the discretion of ―the\nstate commission in lunacy . . . after a careful investigation of all the\ncircumstances of the case.‖ (Stats. 1913, ch. 363, § 1, pp. 775–776.) Recidivists\ncommitted to state prison for sexual crimes could also sterilized whenever the\nresident physician determined it would be ―to the benefit of the physical, mental or\nmoral condition‖ of the inmate. (Id., § 2, p. 776.) Finally, any ―idiot or fool‖\ncould be sterilized by the superintendent of any state hospital with the written\nconsent of a parent or appointed guardian. (Id., § 3, p. 776.) Upon written request\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\fof the parent or guardian, the operation was to be performed ―without charge.‖\n(Ibid.)\n          The 1913 law was repealed four years later and replaced with two separate\nstatutes. The first statute, enacted in May 1917, expanded the state‘s authority to\nsterilize inmates of mental hospitals before their release if they were found to be\nafflicted with hereditary mental disease, ―the various grades of feeble\nmindedness,‖ or ―perversion or marked departures from normal mentality or . . .\ndisease of a syphilitic nature.‖ (Stats. 1917, ch. 489, § 1, p. 571.) The second\nstatute, enacted in June 1917, established ―an institution to be known as the Pacific\ncolony‖ devoted to ―the care, confinement and instruction of feeble-minded and\nepileptic persons.‖ (Stats. 1917, ch. 776, § 1, p. 1623 & preamble.) The statute\ndefined ― ‗feeble-minded‘ ‖ to include persons who were ―not insane‖ but ―so\nmentally deficient that they are incapable of managing themselves and their affairs\nindependently, with ordinary prudence, or of being taught to do so, and who\nrequire supervision, control, and care, for their own welfare, or for the welfare of\nothers, or for the welfare of the community.‖ (Id., § 16, p. 1626.) The June 1917\nstatute marked the first effort by the Legislature to differentiate between persons\nclassified as ―insane‖ (mentally ill) and those classified as ―feeble-minded‖\n(mentally retarded) in the context of civil commitment.\n          The June 1917 statute created a procedure for involuntary commitment that\nlater became section 6500. ―[A]ny parent, guardian or other person charged with\nthe support of a supposedly feeble-minded person‖ could petition the court for\nadmission of the individual to the Pacific colony. (Stats. 1917, ch. 776, § 17,\np. 1626.) The petitioner had to submit a verified affidavit ―disclos[ing] his reasons\nfor supposing such person to be eligible for admission.‖ (Ibid.) Peace officers\ncould also petition for commitment, but they were required to provide written\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\fnotice of the petition to the ―parent, guardian or other person charged with such\nsupport‖ of the proposed committee, if known. (Ibid.)\n       If a person was found to be ―feeble-minded,‖ the judge could order the\nperson committed indefinitely to the Pacific colony, so long as the person had\nbeen a resident of California for at least a year. (Stats. 1917, ch. 776, § 19,\npp. 1626–1627.) The only provision for discharge or release was at the discretion\nof the institution‘s board of trustees. (Id., § 41, p. 1631.) Before discharge, the\nboard of trustees could order sterilization ―with or without the consent of the\ninmate‖ upon a recommendation of the superintendent based on ―careful\ninvestigation of all the circumstances.‖ (Id., § 42, p. 1631.) The statute declared\nthat such sterilization ―shall be lawful‖ and deemed the trustees and ―any person\nparticipating in the operation‖ immune from civil or criminal liability. (Ibid.) In\n1937, the Legislature added a provision requiring the court in a commitment\nproceeding to give ―due notice of the hearing of the petition‖ to the ―alleged\nincompetent.‖ (Stats. 1937, ch. 369, pp. 1005, 1137.)\n       During the 1950s, improved medical treatments and increased public\nawareness of the ―scandalous conditions in state mental institutions‖ gave rise to a\ndeinstitutionalization movement. (Levy & Rubenstein, The Rights of People with\nMental Disabilities (1996) p. 19 [citing Deutsch, The Shame of the States\n(1948)].) From midcentury through the 1970s, California took a series of\nimportant if halting steps that would, at one point, establish our state as a leader in\nprotecting the civil rights of persons with mental disabilities. As explained below,\nreforms applicable to persons with mental illness focused on procedural rights that\ngave such individuals the opportunity to participate in and make decisions about\ntheir care to the extent possible. By contrast, reforms applicable to persons with\nmental retardation began with substantive limits on the state‘s authority to order\n\n\n\n                                          15\n\finvoluntary commitment. Although procedural protections followed, they\ngenerally lagged behind the protections afforded to persons with mental illness.\n       The first step toward reform came in 1951, when California enacted a new\nsterilization scheme for all persons with mental disabilities under the jurisdiction\nof the Department of Mental Hygiene. (Stats. 1951, ch. 552, § 1, pp. 1706–1707.)\nFor the first time, the Legislature required written notice to the patient and his or\nher guardians of any proposed sterilization and created a procedure for individuals\nto object and seek judicial review. (Ibid.) If the patient or a family member filed\na written objection within 30 days, the department director was required to ―make\nfull inquiry into the case, and may hold a hearing.‖ (Id., p. 1707.) If the director\ndecided that the patient should be sterilized despite the patient‘s or the family‘s\nobjection, the director had to provide written notice of the decision and the right to\npetition the superior court for review. Whether due to this law or to other factors,\nthe use of sterilization in California dropped significantly. After sterilizing over\n19,000 individuals between 1909 and 1949, the state performed only 981\nprocedures between 1949 and 1959. (Lombardo, supra, at pp. 241–242.)\n       In 1965, the commitment scheme for ―feeble-minded‖ persons was\nrecodified, and the term ―feeble-minded‖ was replaced with ―mentally deficient\npersons.‖ (Stats. 1965, ch. 391, § 4, pp. 1630, 1668 [former § 5590].) Individuals\nwho were adjudged ―mentally deficient‖ and who had resided in the state for at\nleast one year could be ordered committed to the Department of Mental Hygiene\nfor placement in the Sonoma State Home or the Pacific colony. (Id., p. 1670.)\nIndividuals who had been in the state for less than one year could also be\ncommitted to the department ―for the purpose of transportation of such person to\nthe state of his legal residence.‖ (Ibid.)\n       In 1967, California enacted the LPS Act in order ―[t]o end the\ninappropriate, indefinite, and involuntary commitment of mentally disordered\n\n                                             16\n\fpersons and persons impaired by chronic alcoholism, and to eliminate legal\ndisabilities.‖ (Stats. 1967, ch. 1667, § 36, pp. 4053, 4704 [former § 5001, subd.\n(a)].) The LPS Act created a tiered scheme for involuntary commitment of\nindividuals with mental illness. Upon ―reasonable cause,‖ peace officers or other\ndesignated professionals could place an individual believed to be dangerous or\ngravely disabled into custody for 72-hour treatment and evaluation. (Id.,\npp. 4077–4078 [former § 5150].) Staff at the facility could then certify the\nindividual for an additional 14-day involuntary intensive treatment (id., pp. 4085–\n4088 [former § 5250]), subject to judicial review (id., pp. 4088–4089 [former\n§ 5275 et seq.]). After 14 days, an individual could be committed for an additional\n90 days only after a hearing to determine whether the individual presented ―an\nimminent threat of substantial physical harm to others.‖ (Id., pp. 4089–4091\n[former § 5300].) The statute required the court to appoint counsel to represent\nthe person in that hearing, and the statute required counsel to advise the proposed\ncommittee of his or her rights. (Id., p. 4090 [former § 5302].) Alternatively, an\nindividual found to be ―gravely disabled‖ could be committed through a one-year\nconservatorship. (Id., pp. 4093–4098.) Before such commitment, the individual\nhad a right to demand a jury trial. (Id., p. 4094 [former § 5350, subd. (d)].)\n       Many of the LPS Act‘s procedures for commitment of mentally ill persons\nremain in place today (see post, at p. 21), although the 90-day commitment has\nbeen extended to 180 days (see § 5300 [current]). By all accounts, the LPS Act\nwas a genuine step forward in protecting the rights of such individuals facing civil\ncommitment. ―The LPS Act has been called a ‗Magna Carta for the Mentally Ill‘\nthat ‗established the most progressive . . . commitment procedures in the\ncountry.‘ ‖ (In re Qawi (2004) 32 Cal.4th 1, 17 [quoting Assem. Subcom. on\nMental Health Services, Dilemma of Mental Commitments in California (1978)\nforeword by Assemblyman Louis Papan].)\n\n                                         17\n\f       In contrast to the commitment procedures for persons with mental illness,\nthe LPS Act simply recodified the existing commitment scheme for ―mentally\ndeficient persons,‖ moving the statute to section 6500 of the Welfare and\nInstitutions Code and replacing the phrase ―mentally deficient persons‖ with\n― ‗mentally retarded persons.‘ ‖ (Stats. 1967, ch. 1667, § 37, pp. 4107, 4134–\n4137.) Whereas the prior version of the statute applied to ―[a]ny mentally\ndeficient person,‖ the statute now provided: ―Any mentally retarded person\nrequiring hospitalization may be committed to the Department of Mental Hygiene\n. . . .‖ (Id., p. 4134 [former § 6501].) The LPS Act did not explain what\nconditions might ―requir[e] hospitalization‖; it simply provided that the court\ncould order a hospitalization commitment simply upon a finding that the person\nwas ―mentally retarded.‖ (Id., p. 4136.) The LPS Act did not give individuals\nfacing commitment under section 6500 a right to counsel.\n       As enacted in 1967, the LPS Act also recodified the sterilization procedures\nestablished in 1951, authorizing the sterilization of individuals with hereditary\nmental disease, mental retardation, and other ―[m]arked departures from normal\nmentality.‖ (Stats. 1967, ch. 1667, § 40, pp. 4146, 4155 [former § 7254].) The\nsterilization law was not repealed until 1979. (Stats. 1979, ch. 552, § 1, p. 1762.)\n       In 1970, the Legislature enacted section former 6500.1, establishing the\nfirst substantive limit on the state‘s authority to involuntarily commit individuals\nwith developmental disabilities. The act provided: ―On and after July 1, 1971, no\nmentally retarded person may be committed to the Department of Mental Hygiene\npursuant to this article, unless he is a danger to himself or others.‖ (Stats. 1970,\nch. 351, § 3, p. 765.)\n       Even as the 1970 act imposed a requirement of dangerousness as a\nsubstantive limit on the involuntary commitment of persons with mental\nretardation, a second bill passed later that year established an additional\n\n                                          18\n\fprocedural protection for persons with mental illness. In addition to providing the\nright to counsel, the Legislature beginning in 1970 required trial courts to advise\nmentally ill persons facing prolonged commitment of their right to demand a jury\ntrial. (Stats. 1970, ch. 1627, § 17, p. 3443.) This advisement requirement, now\ncodified at section 5302, is the basis of Barrett‘s equal protection claim.\n       It was not until 1975 that the Legislature provided the right to counsel in\nsection 6500 proceedings. (Stats. 1975, ch. 694, § 27, p. 1651.) The 1975 act also\nimposed a substantive time limit on commitment, providing that any order for\ncommitment would automatically expire after one year. (Ibid.) Any party\nauthorized to submit an original petition for commitment could file subsequent\npetitions for additional one-year periods of commitment, and each subsequent\npetition would follow the same procedures applicable to the original petition.\n(Ibid.) These provisions remain in place today. (See § 6500.)\n       Ten years after the LPS Act was passed, the Legislature in 1977 extended\nthe LPS Act‘s goal of ending ―inappropriate, indefinite, and involuntary\ncommitment‖ to individuals with developmental disabilities, a term defined to\ninclude mental retardation. (Stats. 1977, ch. 1167, § 1, p. 3824 [former § 5001].)\nAt the same time, the Legislature enacted the Lanterman Developmental\nDisabilities Services Act (Lanterman Act). (Stats. 1977, ch. 1252, § 550, p. 4521.)\nThe Lanterman Act expanded community-based treatment and habilitation\nservices for persons with a wide range of developmental disabilities, and it\ndeclared that ―[p]ersons with developmental disabilities have the same legal rights\nand responsibilities guaranteed all other individuals,‖ including ―[a] right to\ndignity‖ (id., pp. 4521–4522, p. 4712, codified at § 4502, subd. (b)) and, as\nprovided by a 1992 amendment, a right ―to make choices in their own lives‖\n(Stats. 1992, ch. 1011, § 3, codified at § 4502, subd. (j)). However, the Lanterman\n\n\n\n                                          19\n\fAct did not extend the LPS Act‘s full panoply of procedural and substantive\nprotections to persons facing commitment under section 6500.\n       Since 1977, a number of amendments have been made to the section 6500\nscheme. (See Stats. 1977, ch. 695, § 7, pp. 2248–2249 [providing a nonexclusive\ndefinition of ―dangerousness‖ to include incompetence to stand trial for specific\nprovisions of the Penal Code]; Stats. 1978, ch. 1319, § 1, p. 4316 [repealing\ndefinition of ―mentally retarded‖]; Stats. 1978, ch. 429, § 220, pp. 1462–1463\n[amending list of Penal Code sections related to definition of ―dangerousness‖];\nStats. 1989, ch. 897, § 47, pp. 3079–3080 [same]; Stats. 1993, ch. 610, § 33,\npp. 3433–3435 [same]; Stats. 1994, ch. 224, § 10, pp. 1791–1792 [same]; Stats.\n1996, ch. 1075, § 20, pp. 7237–7238 [same]; Assem. Bill No. 1472, approved by\nGovernor, June 27, 2012 (2011–2012 Reg. Sess.) [replacing the term ―mental\nretardation‖ and similar terms with ―developmental disability‖ and enacting\nsubstantive changes to the term of commitment].) But the basic procedures for\ninvoluntary commitment under section 6500 have remained unchanged since the\nmid-1970s. For the sake of consistency with today‘s majority opinion, I will cite\nand quote from the section 6500 scheme as it existed at the time of Barrett‘s\ncommitment proceedings. (Maj. opn., ante, at pp. 1–2, fn. 2.)\n                                          IV.\n       With this historical context, I now turn to Barrett‘s equal protection claim,\nbeginning with an examination of today‘s opinion.\n                                           A.\n       In rejecting Barrett‘s claim, the court says ―the critical factor is the distinct\n‗mentality‘ (§ 6507) covered by the two schemes.‖ (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 30.)\nThe court observes that mental disorders ―may arise suddenly and, for the first\ntime, in adulthood‖; that ―[t]he LPS Act process itself assumes that the need for\ntreatment may be temporary, and that disabling mental disorders may be\n\n                                           20\n\fintermittent or short-lived‖; and that ― ‗ ―mental illness ‗often strikes only limited\nareas of functioning, leaving other areas unimpaired, and consequently . . . many\nmentally ill persons retain the capacity to function in a competent\nmanner.‘ ‖ ‘ [Citation.]‖ (Id. at p. 31.) ―These characteristics suggest that the\nmental conditions that create eligibility for an extended 180-day LPS Act\ncommitment, though they include imminent dangerousness, do not necessarily\nimply incompetence or a reduced ability to understand, and make decisions about,\nthe conduct of the proceedings. Hence, nothing compels the conclusion that such\nLPS Act patients will not benefit by the statutory right to a jury trial advisement\nset forth in section 5302. By contrast, in the case of persons alleged to be mentally\nretarded and dangerous under section 6500, the commitment process itself raises\nsubstantial doubts about their cognitive and intellectual functioning sufficient to\nlimit the personal and procedural role they play. It follows that the two groups are\nnot similarly situated as to the function that Barrett implies an advisement like\nsection 5302 serves — comprehending and controlling the decision whether to\nrequest a jury trial. Thus, any disparate statutory treatment with respect to jury\ntrial advisements does not deprive persons like Barrett of equal protection of the\nlaw.‖ (Id. at pp. 31–32.)\n       I do not disagree that there are real differences between persons facing\ncommitment under section 5300 and persons facing commitment under section\n6500. But those differences, properly understood, do not support a categorical\ndistinction between the two groups with respect to a jury right advisement.\n       As an initial matter, even if mental disorders are often temporary,\nintermittent, or treatable with medication, it is not the case that all persons subject\nto a 180-day commitment under the LPS Act are capable, at the time of the\nproceeding, of comprehending a section 5302 advisement. Indeed, under the\ngraduated scheme of increasingly lengthy commitment set forth by the LPS Act\n\n                                          21\n\f(see §§ 5150 [initial 72-hour ―treatment and evaluation‖], 5250 [14-day\ncommitment for ―intensive treatment‖], 5270.15 [30-day commitment for\nadditional ―intensive treatment‖]), one can logically infer that many individuals\nfacing a 180-day commitment under section 5302 have mental disorders that are\nnot temporary, intermittent, or susceptible to effective treatment. The most the\ncourt can say about ―the mental conditions that create eligibility for an extended\n180-day LPS Act commitment‖ is that they ―do not necessarily imply\nincompetence or a reduced ability to understand . . . the conduct of the\nproceedings.‖ (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 31, italics added.) The implication is that at\nleast some (and probably many) potential committees under section 5300 will\nhave mental conditions that preclude comprehension of the proceedings. Those\nindividuals ―will not benefit by the statutory right to a jury trial advisement‖ (maj.\nopn., ante, at p. 31), but the trial court is required to give the advisement anyway.\n(§ 5302.)\n       Just as there are individuals facing commitment under section 5300 who\ncannot understand a jury right advisement, there are individuals facing\ncommitment under section 6500 who can. Why else would section 6500 say that\n―[i]n any proceedings conducted under the authority of this article, the alleged\nmentally retarded person shall be informed of his or her right to counsel by the\ncourt . . . ‖? And why else would section 6504 say that ―[i]n all cases the court\nshall require due notice of the hearing of the petition to be given to the alleged\nmentally retarded person‖? These provisions do not imply that all potential\nsection 6500 committees can understand an advisement. But they appear to be\npremised on the notion that a subset of potential committees can, for ―[t]he law\nneither does nor requires idle acts.‖ (Civ. Code, § 3532.) That is not to say that a\njury trial advisement is required whenever a civil commitment statute requires\nnotice of the right to counsel. It is to say that the rationale for denying a jury trial\n\n                                           22\n\fadvisement in section 6500 proceedings cannot be that persons subject to such\nproceedings are categorically incapable of comprehending the advisement.\n       As the United States Supreme Court has observed, persons who are\nclassified as mentally retarded comprise a ―large and diversified group,‖ ranging\n―from those whose disability is not immediately evident to those who must be\nconstantly cared for.‖ (Cleburne, supra, 473 U.S. at p. 442; see Wald, Principal\nPaper in The Mentally Retarded Citizen and the Law (The President‘s Committee\non Mental Retardation, 1976) p. 5 [―Retarded people, like all people, vary\nenormously in talent, aptitude, personality, achievement, and temperament. . . .\nEach person‘s capacities must be judged individually before he can be denied\nrights of citizenship or humanity.‖].) ―The American Association on Mental\nDeficiency (AAMD) has defined mental retardation as ‗ ―significantly subaverage\ngeneral intellectual functioning existing concurrently with deficits in adaptive\nbehavior and manifested during the developmental period.‖ ‘ ‖ (Cleburne, supra,\n473 U.S. at p. 443, fn. 9.) With respect to intellectual functioning, persons\ndiagnosed as mentally retarded typically have an IQ of 70 to 75 or below. (Amer.\nAssn. on Mental Retardation, Mental Retardation: Definition, Classification, and\nSystems of Supports (10th ed. 2002) pp. 57–58 (AAMR).) But among such\nindividuals, there are significant differences in cognitive abilities.\n       The AAMR guidelines specify four different degrees of mental retardation,\nfrom mild to profound. According to that classification system, an adult with an\nIQ between 50 and 70 is deemed to have ―mild‖ mental retardation. (AAMR,\nsupra, at p. 104; see also Cleburne, supra, 473 U.S. at p. 442, fn. 9.) A mildly\nmentally retarded person is ―[l]ikely to [have] some learning difficulties in\nschool,‖ but ―[m]any adults will be able to work and maintain good social\nrelationships and contribute to society.‖ (AAMR, at p. 104.) Mild mental\nretardation in adults is equivalent to a ―mental age from 9 to under 12 years.‖\n\n                                           23\n\f(Ibid.) As to what such a ―mental age‖ might mean, I note that California‘s\nhistory and social studies curriculum expects fifth-graders to be able to learn,\namong other things, ―the significance of the new Constitution of 1787, including\nthe struggles over its ratification and the reasons for the addition of the Bill of\nRights.‖ (Cal. Department of Education, History-Social Science Framework for\nCalifornia Public Schools Kindergarten Through Grade Twelve (2005) p. 73.)\nMany fifth-graders are no doubt capable of understanding the importance of trial\nby jury.\n       The vast majority of persons who are mentally retarded are classified as\nmildly retarded (see Cleburne, supra, 473 U.S. at p. 442, fn. 9), although it is\nunclear what proportion of individuals facing commitment under section 6500 are\nmildly retarded. But it must be remembered that the class of individuals denied\nthe right to advisement by section 6500 is not limited to individuals who are, in\nfact, mentally retarded. Rather, it is comprised of persons alleged to be mentally\nretarded. The statutory scheme does not presume that an individual subject to a\nsection 6500 proceeding is mentally retarded. Instead, it repeatedly refers to an\n―alleged mentally retarded person‖ (§§ 6500, 6504, 6504.5, 6505, 6506, 6507,\nitalics added), and the section 6500 proceeding is designed to determine whether a\nperson is mentally retarded and dangerous. Assuming that some potential\ncommittees are found not to be mentally retarded, the range of cognitive abilities\namong persons subject to section 6500 proceedings is even broader than the range\nof such abilities among persons found to be mentally retarded.\n       In discussing Barrett‘s due process claim, the court cites several of our\ncases for the proposition that persons who are mentally impaired are unable to act\nin their own best interests and concludes that ―[s]imilar logic applies here.‖ (Maj.\nopn., ante, at p. 23.) But none of those cases supports the categorical denial of a\njury trial advisement to persons alleged to be mentally retarded under section\n\n                                          24\n\f6500. People v. Masterson (1994) 8 Cal.4th 965 addressed waiver, not\nadvisement, of the jury trial right in the context of a criminal competence hearing,\nand unlike the process for initiating a section 6500 proceeding (see post, at pp. 26–\n28), there must be ― ‗substantial evidence‘ rais[ing] a ‗ ―reasonable doubt‖ ‘ ‖ as to\nthe defendant‘s competence before a hearing is conducted on the issue. (Maj.\nopn., ante, at p. 22, fn. 16.) In Thorn v. Superior Court (1970) 1 Cal.3d 666, 674–\n675, we observed that a mentally ill person facing involuntary 14-day treatment\nunder the LPS Act may lack the capacity to comprehend his statutory rights. Yet\nwe made that observation not as a reason to dispense with statutorily required\nadvisements (Thorn, at p. 674), but as a reason to establish additional ―procedures\n. . . which will assure that the patient‘s rights receive meaningful protection‖ (id. at\np. 675). Finally, it is true that In re Hop (1981) 29 Cal.3d 82, 90–91 recognized\nthat a ―developmentally disabled adult too incompetent to admit herself to a\nmental hospital was not competent to protest or consent to hospitalization by third\nparties under the [Lanterman Act].‖ (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 23.) But the court\nnevertheless held that such developmentally disabled individuals are, as a matter\nof equal protection, ―entitled to the same congeries of rights‖ made available to\n―proposed conservatees under the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act.‖ (In re Hop, at\np. 93.)\n                                           B.\n          Today‘s opinion says that ―the commitment process itself raises substantial\ndoubts about [potential committees‘] cognitive and intellectual functioning\nsufficient to limit the personal and procedural role they play.‖ (Maj. opn., ante, at\npp. 31-32, italics added; see id. at p. 3 [―The section 6500 procedure itself\nundermines Barrett‘s assumption that persons alleged to be mentally retarded and\ndangerous can necessarily decide for themselves, in a knowing and intelligent\nmanner, whether to demand a jury at their commitment trials.‖].) According to the\n\n                                           25\n\fcourt, the section 6500 process begins when ―a responsible and interested party‖\nrequests the filing of a section 6500 petition. (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 25.) The\nrequesting party presents ―strong evidence‖ (id. at p. 3) and ―specific information‖\n(id. at p. 25), verified by affidavit, that the individual is mentally retarded. After\nthe petition is filed, the trial court receives a ―professional pretrial evaluation‖ of\nthe individual and ―informed recommendations on treatment and placement‖ from\nthe regional center. (Id. at p. 25.) This account of the process leads the court to\nconclude that ―someone like Barrett, who is alleged to be mentally retarded and\ndangerous under section 6500, is not in a position . . . to sufficiently comprehend\nthe jury trial advisement . . . .‖ (Id. at pp. 25–26.)\n       According to the court, the process that sets in motion a section 6500\nproceeding effectively identifies persons who are in fact, or should be presumed to\nbe, not only mentally retarded but so much so that they cannot understand a jury\ntrial advisement. But, as previously noted (ante, at p. 22), such a conclusion\ndefies the essential premise underlying other advisements that a court must give in\na section 6500 proceeding. Moreover, in describing the commitment process, the\ncourt applies its own gloss instead of focusing on what the statute actually says.\n       Section 6502 requires that a request for the filing of a section 6500 petition\n―shall state the petitioner‘s reasons for supposing the person to be eligible for\n[commitment], and shall be verified by affidavit‖ — nothing more. The statute\ncontains no requirement that the reasons be ―strong‖ (maj. opn., ante, at p. 3) or\n―specific‖ (id. at p. 25), nor does it otherwise specify what quantum of evidence is\nnecessary to trigger the filing of a section 6500 petition. Further, the court\ndescribes the persons authorized to request a petition (a parent, guardian,\nconservator, probation officer, corrections official, or regional center director,\namong others) as ―responsible and interested‖ parties. (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 25.)\nThis may be true in most cases, but the statute plainly contemplates exceptions.\n\n                                           26\n\f(See §§ 6510 [―In case of the dismissal of the petition, the court may, if it\nconsiders the petition to have been filed with malicious intent, order the petitioner\nto pay the expenses in connection therewith . . . .‖], 6511 [―Any person who\nknowingly contrives to have any person adjudged to be mentally retarded under\nthe provisions of this article, unlawfully or improperly, is guilty of a\nmisdemeanor.‖].) Even apart from circumstances as fraught as Carrie Buck‘s, it is\nnot hard to imagine scenarios in which the physical, emotional, or financial costs\nof caring for a ―difficult‖ adult child or ward may result in a section 6500\ncommitment proceeding that is neither necessary nor appropriate for that\nindividual. (See Heller v. Doe (1993) 509 U.S. 312, 347 (dis. opn. of Souter, J.)\n[parents, guardians, and close family members may have interests adverse to an\nallegedly retarded person facing commitment] (Heller).) And even when the\nrequest and petition process does identify a person who is mentally retarded, it\ncannot be assumed that the person cannot comprehend a jury trial advisement.\n(Ante, at pp. 22-24.)\n       Furthermore, it is true that section 6504.5 requires the regional center to\nprovide a professional evaluation and informed recommendations to aid the trial\ncourt. But the regional center‘s report has no bearing whatsoever on who is made\nsubject to a section 6500 petition. That is because the trial court requests and\nreceives the report after the petition has already been filed. (§ 6504.5 [―Wherever\na petition is filed pursuant to this article, the court shall appoint the director of a\nregional center . . . , or the designee of the director, to examine the alleged\nmentally retarded person. [¶] Within 15 judicial days after his or her\nappointment, the regional center director or designee shall submit to the court in\nwriting a report . . . .‖].) The report does not help to establish at the time the\npetition is filed that the person alleged to be mentally retarded and dangerous is in\n\n\n\n                                           27\n\ffact a person who is ―not in a position . . . to sufficiently comprehend the jury trial\nadvisement‖ (maj. opn., ante, at p. 26).\n       In addition, although regional centers undoubtedly provide valuable\nservices to needy clients and helpful expertise to our trial courts, we have\nacknowledged that budgetary considerations place a ―subtle strain . . . on the\ncenter‘s impartial neutrality and detachment.‖ (In re Hop, supra, 29 Cal.3d at\np. 92.) The court in In re Hop unanimously observed that regional centers face\n―subtle pressure favoring hospital treatment as opposed to community placement\nof the ward. Local community placement may be difficult to locate and also\nexpensive, and its cost may be borne locally by a regional center‘s budget.\nHospital placements are funded from statewide sources.‖ (Ibid.) This concern\nprovides an additional reason to reject the court‘s unqualified confidence that a\nperson subject to a section 6500 proceeding is a person who is so cognitively\nimpaired that he or she cannot understand a jury trial advisement.\n       In sum, the distinction between persons facing commitment under section\n5300 and persons facing commitment under section 6500 is not a distinction\nbetween who can understand a jury trial advisement and who cannot. There are\nmany individuals facing commitment under section 5300 who cannot understand\nsuch an advisement, and there are many individuals facing commitment under\nsection 6500 who can. If there is a rational basis for requiring an advisement for\none group but not the other, it cannot rest on a categorical description of the\ncapabilities of one or both groups.\n                                           V.\n       A different response to Barrett‘s equal protection claim is that the\nLegislature could have differentiated between section 5300 and section 6500\nproceedings on the basis of generalizations rather than categorical claims about\nthe two groups facing commitment. The Legislature could have assumed that\n\n                                           28\n\fmost potential section 5300 committees can understand a jury trial advisement,\nwhereas most potential section 6500 committees cannot. Or the Legislature could\nhave speculated that the share of individuals capable of understanding an\nadvisement is simply greater among persons facing commitment under section\n5300 than among persons facing commitment under section 6500. In essence, this\nis a rationale based on administrative burdens. Although not every person facing\ncommitment under section 6500 is incapable of understanding an advisement, the\nLegislature could have assumed that the share of persons under section 6500 with\nthat ability, compared to the share of such persons under section 5300, is not large\nenough to justify burdening the trial courts with giving an advisement in every\ncase.\n        Further, the court posits an additional rationale for the legislative scheme:\n―Nothing compels the state ‗to choose between attacking every aspect of a\nproblem or not attacking the problem at all.‘ [Citation.] Far from having to ‗solve\nall related ills at once‘ [citation], the Legislature has ‗broad discretion‘ to proceed\nin an incremental and uneven manner without necessarily engaging in arbitrary\nand unlawful discrimination. [Citations.]‖ (Maj. opn., ante, at pp. 32–33.) The\nargument is that the Legislature may proceed ―one step at a time.‖ (Williamson v.\nLee Optical Co. (1955) 348 U.S. 483, 489 (Lee Optical).)\n        In considering the ―administrative burden‖ and ―one step at a time‖\nrationales, I begin by observing that these two justifications for legislative\nclassification are hallmarks of conventional rational basis review, a highly\ndeferential standard of equal protection review paradigmatically applicable to\nsocial and economic legislation. (E.g., FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc.\n(1993) 508 U.S. 307, 314–320 [applying ―regulatory-efficiency‖ rationale to\nuphold statutory definition of ―cable system‖] (Beach Communications); Lee\nOptical, supra, 348 U.S. at p. 489 [applying ―one step at a time‖ rationale to\n\n                                          29\n\fuphold statute that prohibited opticians, but not sellers of ready-to-wear glasses,\nfrom fitting or duplicating lenses without a prescription from an optometrist or\nophthalmologist]; American Bank & Trust Co. v. Community Hospital (1984) 36\nCal.3d 359, 374 [applying ―administrative costs‖ rationale to uphold statute\nauthorizing periodic payment procedure for some but not all medical malpractice\nvictims] (American Bank).) The ―irrelevan[ce]‖ of ―whether the conceived reason\nfor the challenged distinction actually motivated the legislature‖ is also\ncharacteristic of conventional rational basis review. (Beach Communications, at\np. 315.) The inquiry examines what the Legislature could have believed because\nthe statutory classification must be upheld ―if there is any reasonably conceivable\nstate of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.‖ (Id. at\np. 313.) The Legislature need not actually articulate its rationale, and ―a\nlegislative choice . . . may be based on rational speculation unsupported by\nevidence or empirical data.‖ (Id. at p. 315.)\n       If conventional rational basis review were applicable here, I would have no\ndifficulty upholding the distinction between section 5300 and section 6500\nproceedings in terms of jury trial advisement, because either the ―administrative\nburden‖ or the ―one step at a time‖ rationale is within the realm of rational\nlegislative speculation. The question, however, is whether conventional rational\nbasis review is the appropriate standard here. We are not dealing in this case with\na legislative classification that distinguishes among cable operators, eye care\nspecialists, or medical malpractice victims. The statutory schemes at issue here\ndraw a distinction between mentally disordered and allegedly mentally retarded\npersons subject to involuntary commitment, ensuring for one while denying to the\nother an advisement of the right to trial by jury. As I explain below, conventional\nrational basis review is not the proper standard in this context.\n\n\n\n                                           30\n\f                                           A.\n       In Cleburne, supra, 473 U.S. 432, the United States Supreme Court\nconsidered an equal protection challenge to a city ordinance that required a special\npermit for locating a group home for mentally retarded persons in a residential\nneighborhood. The high court began its analysis by examining whether mental\nretardation is a quasi-suspect classification calling for heightened scrutiny. (Id. at\np. 442.) Observing that there are ―real and undeniable differences between the\nretarded and others‖ (id. at p. 444) and that many federal and state policies\nspecifically seek to benefit and address the needs of mentally retarded persons (id.\nat pp. 443–445 [discussing various education, habilitation, and antidiscrimination\nstatutes]), the court expressed concern that ―merely requiring the legislature to\njustify its efforts‖ in the terms required by heightened scrutiny ―may lead it to\nrefrain from acting at all‖ (id. at p. 444). For this reason, among others, the court\n―refus[ed] to recognize the retarded as a quasi-suspect class‖ and instead held that\n―legislation that distinguishes between the mentally retarded and others must be\nrationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose.‖ (Id. at p. 446.) ―This\nstandard, we believe, affords government the latitude necessary both to pursue\npolicies designed to assist the retarded in realizing their full potential, and to freely\nand efficiently engage in activities that burden the retarded in what is essentially\nan incidental manner.‖ (Ibid.)\n       In applying this standard of review, the high court observed that the city\nordinance required a special permit for a group home for the mentally retarded but\nnot for many other uses, including apartment houses, multiple dwellings, boarding\nhouses, fraternity or sorority houses, dormitories, apartment hotels, hospitals,\nsanitariums, nursing homes, and private clubs. (Cleburne, supra, 473 U.S. at\np. 447.) The court then proceeded to consider several possible justifications for\nthis differential treatment. First, it noted that the Cleburne city council ―was\n\n                                           31\n\fconcerned with the negative attitude of the majority of property owners . . . , as\nwell as with the fears of elderly residents of the neighborhood.‖ (Id. at p. 448.)\nThe court rejected this rationale on the ground that ―mere negative attitudes, or\nfear, unsubstantiated by factors which are properly cognizable in a zoning\nproceeding, are not permissible bases for treating a home for the mentally retarded\ndifferently from apartment houses, multiple dwellings, and the like.‖ (Ibid.,\nquoting Palmore v. Sidoti (1984) 466 U.S. 429, 433 [―Private biases may be\noutside the reach of the law, but the law cannot, directly or indirectly, give them\neffect.‖].)\n       Second, the city council was concerned that students at a nearby middle\nschool ―might harass the occupants‖ of the group home. (Cleburne, supra, 473\nU.S. at p. 449.) The court said that ―denying a permit based on such vague,\nundifferentiated fears is again permitting some portion of the community to\nvalidate what would otherwise be an equal protection violation.‖ (Ibid.) Third, in\nresponse to the city council‘s concern that the group home would be located on a\nflood plain, the court said the possibility of a flood did not justify treating a group\nhome for the mentally retarded differently from nursing homes, sanitariums, or\nhospitals. (Ibid.) The court was similarly unpersuaded by the city council‘s\n―doubts about the legal responsibility for actions which the mentally retarded\nmight take,‖ finding it ―difficult to believe‖ that the group home ―would present\nany different or special hazard‖ than boarding or fraternity houses. (Ibid.)\n       Fourth, ―the Council was concerned with the size of the home and the\nnumber of people that would occupy it.‖ (Cleburne, supra, 473 U.S. at p. 449.)\nThe court again reasoned that it ―is not at all apparent‖ why a group home for the\nmentally retarded ―warrants a density regulation that others need not observe.‖\n(Id. at p. 450.) ―At least this record does not clarify how . . . the characteristics of\nthe intended occupants of the [group] home rationally justify denying to those\n\n                                           32\n\foccupants what would be permitted to groups occupying the same site for different\npurposes.‖ (Ibid.) Finally, the city expressed concern about ―avoiding\nconcentration of population and . . . lessening congestion of the streets‖ as well as\n―fire hazards, the serenity of the neighborhood, and the avoidance of danger to\nother residents.‖ (Ibid.) But the court said: ―These concerns obviously fail to\nexplain why apartment houses, fraternity and sorority houses, hospitals and the\nlike, may freely locate in the area without a permit.‖ (Ibid.)\n       The high court concluded that ―in our view the record does not reveal any\nrational basis for believing that the [group] home would pose any special threat to\nthe city‘s legitimate interests‖ and thus invalidated the city ordinance as applied to\nthe group home in that case. (Cleburne, supra, 473 U.S. at p. 448.) All nine\njustices in Cleburne agreed that the application of the city ordinance to require a\nspecial permit for the group home was unconstitutional. The majority opinion\nreflected the views of six justices. The other three justices would have gone\nfurther to hold that classification on the basis of mental retardation calls for\nheightened scrutiny and that the city ordinance was invalid not only as applied but\nalso on its face. (Id. at p. 478 (conc. & dis. opn. of Marshall, J.).)\n       I have presented Cleburne‘s equal protection analysis in some detail\nbecause a careful reading of it confirms what many commentators have long\nobserved: In addressing a statutory classification based on mental retardation,\nCleburne did not apply conventional rational basis review. (E.g., Tribe, American\nConstitutional Law (2d ed. 1988) §§ 16–33, p. 1615 [Cleburne ―appl[ied]\nheightened scrutiny, despite ostensible application of the minimum rationality\ntest‖]; Wilkinson, The Dual Lives of Rights: The Rhetoric and Practice of Rights\nin America (2010) 98 Cal. L.Rev. 277, 296, fn. 117 [Cleburne ―applied rational\nbasis review with bite‖]; Pettinga, Rational Basis with Bite: Intermediate Scrutiny\nby Any Other Name (1987) 62 Ind. L.J. 779, 793–796 [same].) As Justice\n\n                                           33\n\fMarshall said, ―Cleburne‘s ordinance surely would be valid under the traditional\nrational-basis test applicable to economic and commercial regulation.‖ (Cleburne,\nsupra, 473 U.S. at p. 456 (conc. & dis. opn. of Marshall, J.).) ―To be sure, the\nCourt does not label its handiwork heightened scrutiny,‖ but ―Cleburne‘s\nordinance is invalidated only after being subjected to precisely the sort of probing\ninquiry associated with heightened scrutiny.‖ (Id. at p. 458.)\n       Whatever the label, Cleburne‘s analysis has two telling features that\ndistinguish it from ordinary rational basis review. First, Cleburne repeatedly\nrejected the ―one step at a time‖ rationale for requiring only the group home for\nthe mentally retarded to obtain a special permit. There was nothing inherently\nirrational about the city‘s contention that the group home presented concerns about\nflood risks, legal liability, density, and congestion. What Cleburne found\nirrational was the city‘s failure to extend the permit requirement to other uses\nimplicating the same concerns. This analysis defies the usual deference given to\nthe legislature ―to proceed in an incremental and uneven manner without\nnecessarily engaging in arbitrary and unlawful discrimination.‖ (Maj. opn., ante,\nat p. 33.)\n       Second, Cleburne expressly noted that ―the record‖ did not support the\ncity‘s asserted justifications for treating the group home differently. (Cleburne,\nsupra, 473 U.S. at p. 448 [―[I]n our view the record does not reveal any rational\nbasis for believing that the [group] home would pose any special threat to the\ncity‘s legitimate interests . . . .‖ (italics added)]; id. at p. 450 [―At least this record\ndoes not clarify how . . . the characteristics of the intended occupants of the\n[group] home rationally justify [differential treatment].‖ (italics added)].)\nCleburne‘s insistence on record support for the city‘s proffered rationales marks a\nclear departure from the ordinary rule that ―legislative choice . . . may be based on\nrational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data.‖ (Beach\n\n                                            34\n\fCommunications, supra, 508 U.S. at p. 315.) It was not irrational to speculate that\nthe group home would present greater risks of legal liability or flood-related harms\nthan other uses of the neighborhood. Nor was it irrational for the city to argue that\n―the discrimination was really motivated by a desire to protect the mentally\nretarded from the hazards presented by the neighborhood.‖ (Cleburne, supra, 473\nU.S. at p. 455 (conc. opn. of Stevens, J.).) But the high court declined to uphold\nthe permit requirement on the basis of such rational speculation in the absence of\nrecord support.\n                                         B.\n       Since Cleburne, the high court has addressed a statutory classification\nbased on mental retardation in one other case, Heller v. Doe, supra, 509 U.S. 312\n(Heller), which involved an equal protection challenge to differences in the\nstatutory procedures for involuntary commitment of persons alleged to be mentally\nill and persons alleged to be mentally retarded. Kentucky‘s civil commitment\nstatutes required proof of mental illness beyond a reasonable doubt, but required\nproof of mental retardation only by clear and convincing evidence. (Id. at p. 315.)\nIn addition, Kentucky law authorized guardians and immediate family members,\nwhether friendly or adverse to the potential committee, to participate as parties in\ncommitment proceedings based on alleged mental retardation but not in\nproceedings based on alleged mental illness. (Ibid.) A class of persons\ninvoluntarily committed on the basis of mental retardation challenged both\nstatutory distinctions.\n       In its equal protection analysis, the high court applied rational basis review\nand described the standard at some length. (Heller, supra, 509 U.S. at pp. 319–\n321.) Quoting extensively from a broad range of cases examining social and\neconomic legislation, the court returned to the propositions that the legislature\n―need not ‗actually articulate at any time the purpose or rationale supporting its\n\n                                         35\n\fclassification‘ ‖ (id. at p. 320), that the legislature ―has no obligation to produce\nevidence to sustain the rationality of a statutory classification‖ (ibid.), and that ―a\nlegislature‘s generalizations‖ must be accepted ―even when there is an imperfect\nfit between means and ends‖ (id. at p. 321). The court‘s opinion mentioned\nCleburne once, simply noting: ―We have applied rational-basis review in previous\ncases involving the mentally retarded and the mentally ill. See Cleburne v.\nCleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U.S. 432 (1985) . . . .‖ (Heller, at p. 321.)\n       Applying conventional rational basis review, the high court reasoned that\nKentucky‘s different burdens of proof for mental illness and mental retardation\ncould be justified on several reasonably conceivable grounds: the greater\ndifficulty of diagnosing mental illness compared to diagnosing mental retardation,\nthe greater accuracy of determining dangerousness based on past behavior in the\ncase of mental retardation as opposed to mental illness, and the more invasive\ntreatment to which the mentally ill are subjected as compared to the mentally\nretarded. (Heller, supra, 509 U.S. at pp. 322–326.) Four justices dissented from\nthis part of the court‘s opinion, noting the absence of record support for any of the\nhypothesized rationales and citing numerous scientific authorities casting doubt on\nthe generalization that treatments for the mentally retarded are less invasive than\ntreatments for the mentally ill. (Id. at pp. 337–346 (dis. opn. of Souter, J.).)\n       As for Kentucky‘s different rules for participation of guardians and family\nmembers as parties in commitment proceedings, the high court said the distinction\ncould plausibly be based on a greater need for privacy among persons diagnosed\nas mentally ill and on the greater likelihood that guardians and family members\nwill have knowledge helpful to the trier of fact in the case of persons alleged to be\nmentally retarded as opposed to mentally ill. (Heller, supra, 509 U.S. at pp. 328–\n330.) On this point, three justices dissented, noting no record support for the\ncourt‘s speculative generalization concerning the privacy needs of the two groups.\n\n                                           36\n\f(Id. at pp. 346–349 & fn. 9 (dis. opn. of Souter, J.).) The dissenters also explained\nthat even if guardians and family members are more likely to have knowledge\nhelpful to the fact finder in cases of alleged mental retardation as opposed to\nalleged mental illness, ―[t]he Court simply points to no characteristic of mental\nretardation that could rationally justify‖ the participation of guardians and family\nmembers not only as witnesses but as parties — in essence, ―a second prosecutor‖\n— in one proceeding but not the other. (Id. at p. 347.)\n       It is evident, as the dissenters observed, that although ―Cleburne was the\nmost recent instance in which [the high court] addressed a classification on the\nbasis of mental disability,‖ Heller did not apply Cleburne‘s analysis yet made no\neffort to distinguish it. (Heller, supra, 509 U.S. at p. 337 (dis. opn. of Souter, J.);\nsee ibid. [―While the Court cites Cleburne once, and does not purport to overrule\nit, neither does the Court apply it, and at the end of the day Cleburne‘s status is\nleft uncertain.‖].) The closely divided court‘s unexplained departure from\nCleburne, in which all nine justices endorsed at least the level of equal protection\nscrutiny applied by the majority opinion, detracts from Heller‘s persuasive force in\ninforming the proper interpretation of the equal protection guarantee under our\nstate Constitution. (Cal. Const., art. I, § 7, subd. (a); see id., § 24 [―Rights\nguaranteed by this Constitution are not dependent on those guaranteed by the\nUnited States Constitution‖].)\n       More to the point, the primary thesis of the court‘s opinion in Heller is that\ndifferences in commitment procedures reflect real differences between mental\nillness and mental retardation as opposed to ―irrational prejudice against the\nmentally retarded‖ (Cleburne, supra, 473 U.S. at p. 450). The problem, however,\nis that the critical question of whether a classification based on mental retardation\nreflects real differences as opposed to irrational prejudice cannot be reliably\nanswered without at least the level of analysis undertaken in Cleburne. Indeed, if\n\n                                           37\n\fany reasonably conceivable state of facts could support such a classification, then\nthe permit requirement in Cleburne should have been upheld. For there are many\ngeneralizations within the realm of rational speculation that could have supported\none or several of the city‘s proffered justifications for distinguishing between\nmentally retarded persons and others. Without insisting on record facts to support\nthose generalizations, there is no way to know whether they actually reflect real\ndifferences or simply assumptions consciously or unconsciously shaped by ― ‗a\nhistory of unfair and often grotesque mistreatment‘ ‖ (id. at p. 454 (conc. opn. of\nStevens, J.)).\n       The high court‘s observation in Heller, citing Blackstone and others, that\n―differences in treatment between the mentally retarded and the mentally ill . . .\nhave long existed in Anglo-American law‖ further illustrates the point. (Heller,\nsupra, 509 U.S. at p. 326; see ibid. [―At English common law there was a ‗marked\ndistinction‘ in the treatment accorded ‗idiots‘ (the mentally retarded) and ‗lunatics‘\n(the mentally ill). [Citation.]‖].) How are we to know whether such historical\npractices were grounded in real differences or in prevailing prejudices of the sort\nthat the archaic and pejorative labels seem to imply? As Justice Souter said,\n―[s]urely the Court does not intend to suggest that the irrational and scientifically\nunsupported beliefs of pre-19th-century England can support any distinction in\ntreatment between the mentally ill and the mentally retarded today.‖ (Id. at p. 345,\nfn. 6 (dis. opn. of Souter, J.); see ibid. [―At that time, ‗lunatics‘ were ‗[s]een as\ndemonically possessed or the products of parental sin [and] were often punished or\nleft to perish.‘ [Citation.] The primary purpose of an adjudication of ‗idiocy‘\nappears to have been to ‗depriv[e] [an individual] of [his] property and its profits.‘\n[Citation.]‖].) It may well be that ―there is a commonsense distinction between\nthe mentally retarded and the mentally ill.‖ (Id. at pp. 326–327 (maj. opn.).) But\n\n\n\n                                           38\n\fcommon sense may sometimes be wrong, or it may provide no support for a\nparticular legislative classification.\n       California is among the majority of states with separate commitment\nschemes for mentally ill and mentally retarded individuals. Traditionally,\ncommitment statutes for the mentally retarded ―provided less procedural\nprotection than commitment statutes for the mentally ill and were less explicit with\nrespect to commitment criteria . . . .‖ (Melton et al., Psychological Evaluations for\nthe Courts: A Handbook for Mental Health Professionals and Lawyers (2d ed.,\n1997) p. 333 (Melton).) California‘s commitment statutes reflect the general\npattern. As discussed earlier (ante, at pp. 16–19), the LPS Act as enacted in 1967\nprovided a right to counsel for persons alleged to be mental ill, and by 1970, the\nLPS Act guaranteed such persons facing prolonged commitment the right to\ndemand a jury trial as well as an advisement of that right. By contrast, the section\n6500 scheme did not include a right to counsel for persons alleged to be mentally\nretarded until 1975, and the right to a jury trial has been secured gradually through\ncase law (see maj. opn., ante, at pp. 14–15 & fn. 14).\n       In explaining these disparities, one authority has observed that ―the law‘s\napproach to people with mental retardation, premised on the irreversibility of their\ncondition, was less solicitous of their property and person than was the case with\npeople suffering from mental illness. In addition, there may have been an\nunderlying assumption that people with mental retardation require less legal\nprotection because they are more easily identifiable than people with mental\nillness and thus are less likely to be committed arbitrarily.‖ (Melton, supra, at\np. 333.) But the same authority concludes that such distinctions are ―unjustified‖:\n―In reality, there is no reason for treating individuals differently based on their\ndiagnosis as far as the legal structure for commitment is concerned. The line\nbetween ‗mental retardation‘ and ‗normal‘ intellectual and adaptive functioning is\n\n                                          39\n\fas difficult to discern as that between ‗mental illness‘ and ‗mental health.‘ ‖\n(Ibid.)\n          I would not go so far as to suggest that there must be strict equality between\nthe commitment procedures applicable to mental illness and mental retardation.\nSuch a broad rule, whether correct or not, is not necessary to decide this case. The\nquestion here is whether a difference in procedure concerning jury trial\nadvisement can be justified on the basis of real differences between the two groups\nas opposed to some latent bias. As Cleburne recognized, that question cannot be\nanswered by simply positing any reasonably conceivable state of facts concerning\nthe two groups. Instead, the ―record [must] clarify how . . . the characteristics of\n[persons facing commitment under section 6500] rationally justify denying to\n[them]‖ the advisement to which persons facing commitment under section 5300\nare entitled. (Cleburne, supra, 473 U.S. at p. 450.)\n                                            C.\n          The evolution of public policy and scientific understanding over the past\nhalf-century has not effaced the distinction between mental illness and mental\nretardation. Instead, it has reinforced the principle implicit in Cleburne that\nunsupported generalizations about any group based on mental disability carry a\nsubstantial risk of harm. As recounted above (ante, at pp. 16–19), legal reforms\nextending civil rights and other protections to persons with mental illness have\ntended to precede similar reforms affecting persons with mental retardation. But a\nnumber of developments since the 1970s, when section 6500 largely took its\ncurrent form, have sought to counter the historic tendency to treat persons with\nmental retardation on the basis of categorical and unfounded assumptions of\ndeficits and incapacities, and instead to enable each person to realize and act on\nhis or her individual abilities.\n\n\n\n                                            40\n\f       The 1970s saw a wave of legislation advancing the rights of individuals\nwith disabilities. (See Rothstein & Irzyk, Disabilities and the Law (4th ed. 2012)\npp. 4–7, 28–29.) Congress enacted the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which\naddressed vocational rehabilitation and employment opportunities for individuals\nwith physical or mental disabilities. (Pub.L. No. 93-112 (Sept. 26, 1972) 87 Stat.\n355.) Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act requires nondiscrimination and\naffirmative action by federal employers (29 U.S.C. § 791), and section 503 of the\nact does the same for federal contractors (29 U.S.C. § 793). Section 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act — ―the most significant federal protection for individuals with\ndisabilities‖ until the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Rothstein & Irzyk,\nat p. 5) — requires nondiscrimination and reasonable accommodation by\nrecipients of federal money (29 U.S.C. § 794), including schools, public facilities,\ntransportation agencies, and health and welfare services. These requirements\nreflect Congress‘s policy of ―respect for individual dignity, personal\nresponsibility, self-determination, and pursuit of meaningful careers, based on\ninformed choice, of individuals with disabilities.‖ (29 U.S.C. § 701(c)(1).)\n       In 1975, Congress enacted the Education for All Handicapped Children\nAct, which exemplified the emerging principle of treating persons with disabilities\non the basis of individual ability: ―It is the purpose of this Act to assure that all\nhandicapped children have available to them . . . a free appropriate public\neducation which emphasizes special education and related services designed to\nmeet their unique needs . . . .‖ (Pub.L. No. 94-142, § 3 (Nov. 29, 1975) 89 Stat.\n773.) This legislation along with its successor, the Individuals with Disabilities\nEducation Act (Pub.L. No. 101-476, § 901 (Oct. 30, 1990) 104 Stat. 1103),\nestablished the entitlement of each child with a disability to an individualized\neducation program ―tailored to a child‘s unique needs [and] designed by the school\n\n\n\n                                           41\n\fdistrict in consultation with the child‘s parents.‖ (Forest Grove School Dist. v.\nT. A. (2009) 557 U.S. 230, 234, fn. 1; see 20 U.S.C. §§ 1412(a)(4), 1414(d).)\n       Also in 1975, Congress enacted the Developmentally Disabled Assistance\nand Bill of Rights Act, which called for individualized treatment and services:\n―The treatment, services, and habilitation for a person with developmental\ndisabilities should be designed to maximize the developmental potential of the\nperson and should be provided in the setting that is least restrictive of the person‘s\npersonal liberty.‖ (Pub.L. No. 94-103, § 201 (Oct. 4, 1975) 89 Stat. 486.) As a\ncondition of receiving federal funding under this law and its successor statutes,\neach state is required to adopt a plan that assures, among other things, that ―any\ndirect services provided to individuals with developmental disabilities and funded\nunder the plan will be provided in an individualized manner, consistent with the\nunique strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, and capabilities of such\nindividual.‖ (42 U.S.C. § 15024(c)(5)(G).)\n       In 1990, Congress passed the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),\nprohibiting discrimination against individuals with physical or mental disabilities.\n(Pub.L. No. 101-336 (July 26, 1990) 104 Stat. 327.) Notably, the ADA forbids\ndiscrimination based on ―an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment\nwhether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit a major life activity.‖\n(42 U.S.C. § 12102(3)(A).) The workplace nondiscrimination and reasonable\naccommodation requirements of the ADA continue Congress‘s policy of ensuring\nthat persons with disabilities are treated on the basis of their individual talents and\nabilities rather than their actual or perceived limitations. (42 U.S.C. §§ 12111(8),\n(9), 12112(b).)\n       Recent legislation has changed the language that statutes use to refer to\nindividuals with disabilities. In 2010, Congress replaced the phrase ―mental\nretardation‖ with ―intellectual disability‖ in the federal codes. (Pub.L. No. 111-\n\n                                          42\n\f256 (Oct. 5, 2010) 124 Stat. 2643.) Although such changes are sometimes\ndisparaged as acts of political correctness, a Senate report explained: ―[T]he terms\n‗mentally retarded,‘ ‗mental retardation,‘ and variations of these terms, to describe\nindividuals with intellectual disabilities are anachronistic, needlessly insensitive\nand stigmatizing, and clinically outdated. Terms to describe individuals with\nintellectual disabilities have gone through a steady evolution over the past two\ncenturies, each iteration describing those living with the condition in a pejorative\nway. At the turn of the 20th century, people who were viewed as having\nlimitations in intellectual advancement and social behavior were institutionalized.\nThe prevailing sentiment at the time being that such people could not, should not,\ninteract with people without disabilities. [¶] ‗Imbecile,‘ ‗moron,‘ ‗idiot,‘ and\n‗feeble-minded‘ are all terms which have been used to reference people with\ncognitive disabilities by the public and in our Federal statutes. Each of these terms\nfocused on perceived deficiencies to describe such individuals. The most recent\nterm — ‗mental retardation‘ — was used to characterize those with cognitive\ndisabilities as having general diminished capacities for cognitive functioning.\nPhysicians, advocates, and law makers now understand that this term does not\naccurately describe these individuals.‖ (Sen.Rep. No. 111-244, 2d Sess., p. 2\n(2010).) Just weeks ago, our Legislature similarly replaced the term ―mental\nretardation‖ and related language with ―developmental disability‖ throughout the\nsection 6500 scheme. (Assem. Bill No. 1472, approved by Governor, June 27,\n2012 (2011–2012 Reg. Sess.).)\n       All of these developments have sought to overcome the historical practice\nin our nation and our state of categorically treating persons with intellectual\ndisabilities as incapable of understanding their own circumstances or participating\nin public institutions and civic life. To be sure, there are real differences between\npersons with such disabilities and others. Such differences, however, can only be\n\n                                          43\n\fdistinguished from entrenched and possibly unfounded assumptions by insisting\non an actual, demonstrable basis — and not mere hypothesis or conjecture — for\ntreating people differently because of that disability.\n                                          D.\n       For the foregoing reasons, I would hold as a matter of state equal protection\nlaw that the Cleburne standard is the proper standard of review for evaluating\nstatutory classifications based on mental retardation. Whatever Cleburne‘s status\nmay be as a matter of federal law after Heller, we have long noted that ―our state\nequal protection provisions, while ‗substantially the equivalent of‘ the guarantees\ncontained in the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, are\npossessed of an independent vitality which, in a given case, may demand an\nanalysis different from that which would obtain if only the federal standard were\napplicable.‖ (Serrano v. Priest (1976) 18 Cal.3d 728, 764.) The independent\nvitality of our state equal protection guarantee has led this court to hold — upon\ncanvassing judicial, legislative, and other historical developments in a similar\nmanner as I have done here — that strict scrutiny applies to laws that discriminate\non the basis of sexual orientation or gender, even though federal courts review\nsuch laws under less stringent standards. (Compare In re Marriage Cases (2008)\n43 Cal.4th 757, 821–823, 843–844, and Sail’er Inn, Inc. v. Kirby (1971) 5 Cal.3d\n1, 17–20 with Romer v. Evans (1996) 517 U.S. 620, 631–635, and Mississippi\nUniv. for Women v. Hogan (1982) 458 U.S. 718, 724.) Consistent with this\ninterpretive tradition, I conclude that Cleburne‘s rational basis scrutiny applies as\na matter of state law to distinctions based on mental retardation.\n       This court‘s equal protection jurisprudence has generally applied a two-\ntiered approach that subjects challenged classifications either to strict scrutiny or\nto rational basis review. Although Cleburne applied neither strict scrutiny nor\nconventional rational basis review, I do not see much to be gained by multiplying\n\n                                          44\n\flabels to further differentiate among tiers of review. (Cf. Cleburne, supra, 473\nU.S. at p. 451 (conc. opn. of Stevens, J.) [―[O]ur cases reflect a continuum of\njudgmental responses to differing classifications which have been explained in\nopinions by terms ranging from ‗strict scrutiny‘ at one extreme to ‗rational basis‘\nat the other. I have never been persuaded that these so-called ‗standards‘\nadequately explain the decisional process.‖].) The essence of rational basis review\nis that a legislative classification ―must be rationally related to a legitimate\ngovernmental purpose.‖ (Id. at p. 446 (maj. opn.).) Like all doctrinal tests, this\ngeneral requirement acquires greater specificity through application, and\nCleburne, in my view, elucidates the proper application of rational basis review\nwhere a statutory classification is based on mental retardation as opposed to\ndistinctions among cable television facilities (Beach Communications, supra, 508\nU.S. 307), eye care professionals (Lee Optical, supra, 348 U.S. at p. 489), or tort\nvictims (American Bank, supra, 36 Cal.3d at pp. 373–374).\n       In reaching this conclusion, I am mindful of Cleburne‘s observation that\npolicies ―singling out the retarded for special treatment‖ are ―in the vast majority\nof situations . . . not only legitimate but also desirable.‖ (Cleburne, supra, 473\nU.S. at p. 444.) Unlike strict or intermediate scrutiny, the rational basis test\nrecognizes that ―[e]specially given the wide variation in the abilities and needs of\nthe retarded themselves, governmental bodies must have a certain amount of\nflexibility and freedom from judicial oversight in shaping and limiting their\nremedial efforts.‖ (Id. at p. 445.) Nevertheless, it is appropriate that Cleburne‘s\nskepticism toward unsubstantiated generalizations and legislative inconsistency\napplies equally to ―remedial‖ laws that purport to benefit individuals with\nintellectual disabilities. For if there is any lesson to be learned from this area of\nhistory, it is that the injurious character of many benignly motivated policies\nbecame apparent only after objective inquiry or scientific advancement revealed\n\n                                           45\n\ftheir unfounded premises for what they were. The officials who approved the\nsterilization of Carrie Buck, for example, seemed confident that they were doing\nso for her own good. (Ante, at p. 10.) It is possible that some policies we today\nregard as remedial will, upon finer inspection, come to be regarded tomorrow as\nunwarranted paternalism.\n       Although the court says Cleburne is ―outmoded in this context‖ (maj. opn.,\nante, at p. 35, fn. 21), other courts have continued to rely on Cleburne for its\napproach to rational basis review even after Heller. (See, e.g., Massachusetts v.\nU.S. Dept. of Health & Human Services (1st Cir. 2012) 682 F.3d 1, 10–11 [citing\nCleburne to show that ―equal protection assessments are sensitive to the\ncircumstances of the case and not dependent entirely on abstract categorizations‖];\nVision Mining, Inc. v. Gardner (Ky. 2011) 364 S.W.3d 455, 466–469 [citing\nCleburne in concluding that ―the rational basis standard, while deferential, is\ncertainly not demure‖]; Ferdon ex rel. Petrucelli v. Wis. Patients Comp. Fund\n(Wis. 2005) 701 N.W.2d 440, 461–462 [citing Cleburne in explaining that ―[t]he\nrational basis test is ‗not a toothless one‘ ‖].) In any event, even if Heller has\n―superseded‖ Cleburne (maj. opn., ante, at p. 35, fn. 21), the court provides no real\nanalysis as to why Heller and not Cleburne should frame the standard of review\nthat applies to discrimination on the basis of mental retardation under state equal\nprotection principles — even though this issue has not previously been settled by\nour court, even though article I, section 24 of the California Constitution says\nthat ―[r]ights guaranteed by this Constitution are not dependent on those\nguaranteed by the United States Constitution,‖ even though we have adopted equal\nprotection standards that are more stringent than federal standards in other areas,\nand even though the history of discrimination on the basis of mental retardation\nclearly distinguishes this kind of discrimination from ordinary economic and\nsocial legislation. Far from ―crafting [my] own constitutional theory of equal\n\n                                          46\n\fprotection‖ (maj. opn., ante, at p. 35, fn. 21), I have provided an explicit and\nreasoned explanation as to why the Cleburne approach is appropriate here, using\nthe same type of analysis that our court has used in the past when confronted with\nsimilarly novel equal protection issues. By contrast, the court simply does not\nengage this issue apart from asserting that ―we have correctly applied [Heller]‖\nand that Cleburne‘s approach is ―unduly strict‖ and thus improper here. (Maj.\nopn., ante, at p. 35, fn. 21.) We do not ordinarily decide important questions of\nconstitutional law in such a conclusory manner.\n                                          E.\n       Applying Cleburne‘s principles to the instant case, I conclude that the\nrecord reveals no rational basis for requiring courts to provide a jury trial\nadvisement to persons facing commitment under section 5300 but not to persons\nfacing commitment under section 6500. Cleburne‘s analysis forecloses reliance\non a ―one step at a time‖ rationale. If the difference in commitment procedure is\nto be sustained, it must be on the basis of a valid generalization about each group‘s\nability to understand the advisement. But there are no legislative findings or other\nfacts on record to support such a generalization.\n       There is nothing irrational about a conjecture that the proportion of\nmentally disordered persons facing a 180-day commitment under the LPS Act who\ncan understand the advisement is greater than the comparable proportion among\npersons alleged to be mentally retarded under section 6500. But it is a mere\nconjecture nonetheless. As previously discussed (ante, at pp. 21–22), a person\nfacing a 180-day commitment under section 5300 is a person actually (not\nallegedly) suffering from a mental disorder who has already undergone a 72-hour\nevaluation and treatment period (§ 5150) followed by a 14-day ―intensive\ntreatment‖ period (§ 5250) and possibly an ―additional‖ 30-day period of\n―intensive treatment‖ (§ 5270.15). Despite such treatment, such a person is\n\n                                          47\n\falleged to ―present[], as a result of mental disorder or mental defect, a\ndemonstrated danger of inflicting substantial physical harm upon others.‖\n(§ 5300.) It is a fair inference that many such individuals are so mentally\ndisordered that, even with treatment, they cannot understand a jury trial\nadvisement. Meanwhile, given the range of cognitive abilities among persons\ndiagnosed as mentally retarded and among persons merely ―alleged‖ to be\nmentally retarded under section 6500, it is a fair inference that many such\nindividuals are, with or without treatment, capable of understanding a jury trial\nadvisement. (Ante, at p. 22.) The record before us provides no factual basis to\ndetermine whether the two groups really differ with respect to ability to\nunderstand an advisement and, if so, whether the difference is large or small.\n       Moreover, although the Legislature could have believed the benefits of an\nadvisement requirement to be worth the administrative burden in section 5300\nproceedings but not in section 6500 proceedings, there are no facts or findings in\nthe record to support the rationality of such a legislative judgment. Of course,\nevery procedural requirement presents an incremental burden. But it is not\nobvious how burdensome an advisement really is, especially when considered\napart from any right to personal waiver. It is possible that a court reporter may be\nnecessary to record the advisement. But there is no need for a competency hearing\nwith respect to an advisement alone. Although some individuals will not\nunderstand an advisement, others will. If the efficiency of an advisement\nrequirement were expressed as a ratio of its benefits to its burdens, the ratio would\nremain quite large even if the magnitude of the benefits varied from group to\ngroup, so long as the magnitude of the burdens was much smaller. The lack of any\nrecord indication of how burdensome it is to provide a jury trial advisement makes\nit difficult to conclude that the statutory distinction at issue reflects considerations\n\n\n\n                                           48\n\fof administrative efficiency that merely ―burden the retarded in what is essentially\nan incidental manner‖ (Cleburne, supra, 473 U.S. at p. 446).\n       Importantly, my analysis does not suggest that the Legislature is foreclosed\nfrom adopting different commitment procedures (short of procedures implicating a\nfundamental right) based on generalizations about persons who are mentally\ndisordered and persons who are alleged to be mentally retarded. The problem in\nthis case is that such generalizations lack any factual basis in the record that would\ndispel an inference of irrational prejudice, and thus the statutory distinction is\ninvalid as presently drawn. However, the Legislature would remain free, in my\nview, to reenact the distinction if it were to articulate and provide some factual\nsupport for its classificatory rationale. (Cf. Califano v. Goldfarb (1977) 430 U.S.\n199, 221–222 & 223, fn. 9 (conc. opn. of Stevens, J.) [finding Social Security\nsurvivors‘ benefit statute invalid because Congress ―simply assumed that all\nwidows [but not widowers] should be regarded as ‗dependents,‘ ‖ but leaving open\nthe possibility that ―an actual, considered legislative choice would be sufficient to\nallow this statute to be upheld‖].) Legislative inquiry might reveal that most\npersons facing commitment under section 6500 are more than mildly retarded, that\nmost persons facing commitment under section 5300 are not cognitively impaired,\nor that an advisement requirement presents administrative burdens that are not\nimmediately obvious. When the Legislature has provided actual reasons and made\nfindings to support a classification on the basis of mental retardation, the resulting\nstatute is entitled to a high degree of deference. The Legislature may properly\nconsider the efficiency of procedures designed to commit persons with mental\ndisabilities who are dangerous to themselves or others, and a reviewing court\nshould refrain from second-guessing the Legislature‘s actual, factually supported\njudgment that a particular classification is rationally related to a legitimate\narticulated purpose.\n\n                                          49\n\f       Finally, the term ―irrational prejudice‖ (Cleburne, supra, 473 U.S. at\np. 450) merits a brief comment. When it is said that a hypothesized yet\nunsubstantiated generalization is not sufficient to negate an inference of irrational\nprejudice, I do not think a necessary or even proper implication is that the policy\nin question was born of subjective animus. I would not suggest, for example, that\nthe legislators who supported the enactment of section 6500 (or the citizens who\nelected those legislators) were motivated by ill will toward persons alleged to be\nmentally retarded. Instead, an irrational prejudice may, and most often does, arise\nfrom good-faith adherence to unexamined assumptions that reflect historic or\nprevailing attitudes. In recent decades, many legislative developments concerning\ninvoluntary commitment have perhaps reflected a widespread belief that because\nmental illness is less permanent and more treatable than mental retardation, people\nwho are mentally ill are ―closer to normal‖ than people who are mentally retarded.\nWhatever merit such a totalizing assumption may have as a general matter, it\ncannot alone — in the absence of relevant supporting facts — justify a particular\nlegislative classification without taking on the character of an irrational prejudice\nin that specific context.\n                                          F.\n       While holding that persons facing commitment under section 6500 have a\nright to a jury trial, today‘s opinion characterizes the advisement that Barrett seeks\nas an ―ancillary,‖ ―collateral,‖ or ―additional adjunct‖ procedure. (Maj. opn., ante,\nat pp. 19, 24, 15.) Potential committees have a right to counsel (§ 6500), and the\ncourt says counsel ―is presumed competent and informed as to applicable\nconstitutional and statutory law‖ and ―can be expected, where necessary or\nadvisable, to consult with the client about jury trial concerns.‖ (Maj. opn., ante, at\np. 26.) This may be a pertinent response to Barrett‘s due process claim. But it is\nno answer to her equal protection claim because one could just as easily say that\n\n                                          50\n\fthe right to counsel adequately protects the jury trial right of individuals facing\ncommitment under section 5300. Indeed, section 5302 requires a jury trial\nadvisement even as it not only provides for a right to counsel but also expressly\ninstructs that ―[t]he attorney shall advise the person of his rights in relation to the\nproceeding . . . .‖\n       It may be true that counsel generally knows best and that the option to\ndemand or waive a jury trial will typically result in the same decision whether an\nadvisement is given or not. But the importance of an advisement goes beyond its\ninstrumental value. Whether or not an advisement alters the ultimate choice to\nproceed with or without a jury, it expresses the legal system‘s respect for the\nindividual as a participant in, and not a mere object of, the commitment\nproceedings. For those who are capable of understanding it, an advisement by the\ncourt recognizes their dignity as well as their ability to comprehend and possibly\nparticipate in an important aspect of a proceeding that may adversely and\nirreversibly shape the rest of their lives. Having extended this recognition to some\npersons with mental disabilities, the Legislature must have an actual, considered\nrationale for not extending it to others.\n       In sum, the instant case implicates two sensitivities that run deep in the\nhistory of society‘s treatment of persons with intellectual disabilities. The first is\nan unfounded assumption of incapacity. As previously noted (ante, at p. 22), the\nsection 6500 scheme does not assume that all individuals facing commitment lack\nthe ability to comprehend an advisement. Nor should it assume, without\nsupporting facts, that proportionally more persons lack such ability in proceedings\nunder section 6500 than in proceedings under section 5300.\n       Second, the assumption of incapacity occurs in the context of a proceeding\nthat may result in precisely the sort of isolation and segregation that reinforces and\nperpetuates the assumption of incapacity. As Congress recognized among its\n\n                                            51\n\ffindings when it passed the ADA, ―historically, society has tended to isolate and\nsegregate individuals with disabilities, and, despite some improvements, such\nforms of discrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be serious\nand pervasive social problem . . . .‖ (42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(2).)\n       It is true that an order of commitment under section 6500 ―expire[s]\nautomatically one year after‖ it is made. (§ 6500.) But a person may be\nrecommitted year after year, without limit, through procedures that are ―the same\nas with an initial petition for commitment.‖ (Ibid.) Where a trial court finds an\nindividual to be mentally retarded — a condition that ―never recede[s]‖ (maj. opn.,\nante, at p. 24) — and where the court also finds, as it did here, that ―the danger she\nposed to herself and others was based upon, and caused by, her mental\nretardation‖ (id. at p. 7), the initial commitment proceeding and the findings made\ntherein potentially lay the groundwork for lengthy, possibly even lifetime\nconfinement. (See Melton, supra, at p. 334 [―the relatively stable nature of their\ncondition‖ means hospitalization of people with mental retardation ―could amount\nto confinement for life‖].) Before being consigned to such a fate, a person alleged\nto be mentally retarded is entitled to the same advisement, and the same respect\nand recognition, that the Legislature has seen fit to grant other persons with mental\ndisabilities who are facing prolonged commitment. That such respect and\nrecognition may be ―largely symbolic‖ (maj. opn., ante, at p. 35, fn. 21) does not\ndiminish the importance of Barrett‘s claim, for it is evident from many historic\nclaims of equality vindicated by our court and others that the principle of equal\nprotection ―often bears its fruit in those regions where symbol becomes\nsubstance.‖ (Karst, Equal Citizenship Under the Fourteenth Amendment (1977)\n91 Harv. L.Rev. 1, 6.)\n\n\n\n\n                                         52\n\f                                          VI.\n       The Court of Appeal found that even if Barrett was entitled to advisement\nand personal waiver of her jury trial right, the error was harmless in light of the\nevidence of her mental retardation and dangerousness: ―There was no dispute that\nBarrett is a person with mental retardation. And, given her recent history, as\ndocumented in the reports attached to the petition for commitment and the\ntestimony of Robert Thomas, there was substantial evidence that she is a danger to\nherself or others, even though there was no evidence that anyone, as yet, had\nsuffered actual and serious physical injury as a result of her behavior. She\nregularly assaulted others and engaged in self-mutilation and suicidal ideation.\nAnd though Barrett disputes it, there was undisputed evidence, as the trial court\nfound, that her mental retardation is a substantial factor in her inability to control\nher dangerous behavior.‖\n       I agree with the Court of Appeal that the failure to advise was not structural\nerror requiring automatic reversal. The Court of Appeal applied the harmless error\nstandard for federal constitutional error (Chapman v. California (1967) 386 U.S.\n18, 24), but ―application of a state harmless-error rule is, of course, a state\nquestion where it involves only errors of state procedure or state law‖ (id. at\np. 21). Here, even if the Legislature violated the federal as well as state equal\nprotection guarantee by failing to afford Barrett the same right to advisement\nafforded under section 5302, the error in Barrett‘s trial was the denial of a state\nstatutory right. If the Legislature were to correct the constitutional violation\ntomorrow by amending section 6500, any subsequent advisement error would be\nsubject to state harmless error analysis. The same is true today. Applying People\nv. Watson (1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836-837, I would conclude on the basis of the\nevidence that there was no reasonable probability Barrett would have achieved a\nmore favorable outcome had she been tried by a jury.\n\n                                          53\n\f       Accordingly, I join the court‘s disposition affirming the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeal. But I would hold that Barrett is entitled to advisement of her\nright to a jury trial in any future proceeding under section 6500.\n\n\n                                                  LIU, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                         54\n\fSee next page for addresses and telephone numbers for counsel who argued in Supreme Court.\n\nName of Opinion People v.

Ct. No. MH034663\n____________________________________)\n\n\n        Christine Barrett is an adult who has long been diagnosed with mental\nretardation and other mental disorders, and who has lived in the community while\nbeing supported and supervised by others. Because of her increasingly violent\nbehavior, Barrett became the subject of this proceeding to civilly commit her as a\n―mentally retarded person‖ who is a ―danger‖ to herself or others. (Welf. & Inst.\nCode,1 § 6500 (section 6500).)2 The People sought placement in a secure\ntreatment facility pursuant to the statutory scheme.\n\n1       All further undesignated statutory references are to the Welfare and\nInstitutions Code.\n2      Barrett suggests that ―mental retardation‖ and closely related phrases are\noutmoded expressions for persons with subaverage cognitive and adaptive\nfunctioning, and that California courts should speak only in terms of persons who\nare ―developmentally disabled‖ or ―intellectually disabled.‖ A similar point is\nmade in the lone amicus curiae brief filed in this court, which was submitted by\nDisability Rights California on behalf of itself and other entities and individuals.\nThe terms ―mentally retarded‖ and ―mental retardation‖ appeared throughout the\n                                                          (footnote continued on next page)\n\n                                          1\n\f        Following a nonjury trial in which Barrett was represented by counsel, the\ntrial court sustained the allegations of the petition. The court ordered her\ncommitted for one year to the State Department of Developmental Services\n(Department), and otherwise approved the requested placement. The judgment\nwas affirmed on appeal. This court granted Barrett‘s petition for review.\n        We now decide whether the Court of Appeal properly rejected Barrett‘s\nclaims that she was denied due process and equal protection of the law insofar as\nthe record does not reveal the circumstances under which she was tried by the\ncourt, rather than by a jury. The statutory scheme does not expressly provide\neither for a right to jury trial or for any related requirement that an alleged\nmentally retarded person be advised of, or allowed to personally act upon, any\nsuch right. Nevertheless, the parties do not dispute that Barrett was entitled under\nlongstanding equal protection principles to a jury unless a jury was validly waived.\n        Critical here is that Barrett further insists the trial court was constitutionally\ncompelled to (1) expressly advise her that she could request a jury, and (2) obtain\nher personal waiver of a jury, before holding a bench trial and deciding all\n\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\n\nstatutory scheme when the present commitment proceedings were held and the\nfindings under review were made. To avoid confusion, we use such original\nterminology here, and cite the version of the statutory scheme applied to Barrett at\nall stages of the present case. Nonetheless, we are aware that legislative\nenactments and proposed amendments replace references to ―mental retardation‖\nunder section 6500 et seq. with such terms as ―developmental disability‖ and\n―intellectual disability.‖ (See Assem. Bill No. 1472, approved by Governor, June\n27, 2012 (2011-2012 Reg. Sess.); see also Sen. Amend. to Assem. Bill No. 2370\n(2011-2012 Reg. Sess.) June 20, 2012.) As suggested by both Barrett and Justice\nLiu‘s concurring and dissenting opinion, however, nothing in this new or pending\nlegislation appears on its face to concern either the right to jury trial or the\nancillary procedures at issue here.\n\n\n                                            2\n\fcommitment issues itself. Because the record does not show whether such\nprocedures occurred here, Barrett views the commitment order as inherently\nunsound and reversible per se. We disagree, and find no constitutional violation.\n       Barrett‘s due process and equal protection theories share the same flawed\npremise. The section 6500 procedure itself undermines Barrett‘s assumption that\npersons alleged to be mentally retarded and dangerous can necessarily decide for\nthemselves, in a knowing and intelligent manner, whether to demand a jury at their\ncommitment trials. As we explain, that process is initiated, and proceeds from the\noutset, on the basis of strong evidence that the individual facing commitment has\ncognitive and intellectual impairments that would prevent him or her from making\na meaningful decision whether to invoke, or waive, the right to a jury trial. The\nperson‘s rights and interests are nonetheless protected by the state‘s statutory\nobligation to provide counsel in section 6500 proceedings.\n       Accordingly, consistent with closely related decisions of this court, and\ngiven the mental competence issues addressed in section 6500 proceedings as\ncompared to other commitment scenarios, we conclude it is counsel who must\nmake the tactical decision whether to seek or waive a jury. To encumber the jury\ntrial right with a collateral requirement that any waiver be personally made by the\nproposed committee following a formal court advisement would serve no useful\npurpose in this context. This approach does not undermine the fairness of the\nproceedings in a due process sense, or treat dangerous mentally retarded persons\ndifferently from those with whom they are aligned for equal protection purposes.\nWe therefore will affirm the judgment.\n\n\n                               I. CASE HISTORY\n       On January 22, 2009, the district attorney, acting on the People‘s behalf,\nfiled a petition in Santa Clara County Superior Court to commit Barrett under\n                                          3\n\fsection 6500. According to the petition, Barrett lived in a private residence with\nstaff assistance. The party responsible for her care, maintenance, and support was\nthe San Andreas Regional Center (Center).3 The Center‘s service coordinator,\nBetty Crane, was the person who requested that the petition be filed.\n       The petition further alleged that Barrett was mentally retarded and\ndangerous to herself and others. On this basis, the court was asked to hold an\nevidentiary hearing and to order Barrett committed to the Department for care,\ncustody, and treatment for a period not exceeding one year. In providing reasons\nfor filing the commitment petition, the district attorney relied on ―the assessment,\nevaluations, reports and other documents‖ of the Center and the Department.\nThese materials were incorporated by reference into the petition, and were filed at\nthe same time in the form of a confidential exhibit.\n       On the day the petition was filed, the trial court set a hearing for March 9,\n2009. Pending the hearing, the court also ordered Barrett‘s interim placement\nunder the Department‘s care in a particular secure treatment facility.\n       Counsel for both parties appeared in court on March 9. Although a court\nreporter was also present, no reported proceedings occurred and no transcript was\nprepared. As noted by the Court of Appeal, the only record of the hearing is a\nprinted minute order. It indicates, in an abbreviated handwritten note, that the\nmatter was continued to April 8, 2009, at 10:00 a.m., for a two-hour hearing. The\nMarch 9 minute order contains no other substantive information.\n\n\n\n\n3      The Center is one of several regional, community-based nonprofit agencies\nfunded and regulated by the state to serve developmentally disabled persons,\npursuant to the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (LDDSA).\n(See § 4620; see also post, at p. 11, fn. 10.)\n\n\n                                          4\n\f       On April 8, the trial court began the proceeding at the scheduled time.\nBarrett and counsel for both parties were present in the courtroom. Counsel\nagreed that the previous two-hour estimate accurately reflected the total amount of\ntime needed to present evidence and try the case. The People then called Dr.\nRobert Thomas, their first and only witness, to the stand. Nothing in the reporter‘s\ntranscript indicates that any mention of trial by jury occurred.\n       Dr. Thomas was a psychologist at the Center who qualified as an expert\nwitness on mental retardation, and who had examined Barrett and reviewed her\ncase history. He testified that Barrett, then age 27, was mentally retarded. She\nhad an I.Q. in the ―50‘s to 40‘s‖ — a level deemed ―moderate‖ in the sense that it\nwas neither mild nor severe. Dr. Thomas based this conclusion, in part, on school\nrecords and psychological reports from early in Barrett‘s life, before she became a\nclient of the Center in 2001.4\n       Dr. Thomas further opined that because of cognitive deficits associated\nwith her mental retardation, Barrett had serious difficulty controlling her behavior,\nand was a danger to herself and others. This determination rested on two main\nfactors: (1) Barrett‘s incapacity ―to understand the complexity of her disorder and\nthe need for treatment,‖ and (2) her volatile and violent history, as set forth in\n―incident reports‖ compiled by the Center.5\n\n4      Dr. Thomas noted near the end of his direct examination that Barrett had\nbeen diagnosed over the years with various mental disorders in addition to mental\nretardation. They included autism, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and\nschizoaffective disorder.\n5      On cross-examination, Dr. Thomas acknowledged that other mental\ndisorders besides mental retardation can trigger aggression, including autism and\nschizophrenia. However, in Barrett‘s case, he declined to blame her violent\noutbursts either solely or primarily on any diagnosed mental disorder other than\nmental retardation. While such conditions likely interacted to affect her behavior,\n                                                            (footnote continued on next page)\n\n                                           5\n\f        Dr. Thomas explained that Barrett had lived at home with her parents until\n2001. Because of physical assaults and verbal abuse against her parents, and\nnoncompliance with her treatment plan, Barrett was placed in a residential facility,\nor group home. This facility, where Barrett stayed for five years, was well staffed\nand closely monitored. However, according to Dr. Thomas, Barrett repeatedly left\nthe premises without proper notice and supervision, and disrupted the community\nby ―threatening people‖ and acting in ―inappropriate‖ and ―self-destructive‖ ways.\nSimilar problems arose inside the facility, often triggering an emergency response\nand psychiatric hospitalization.\n        Dr. Thomas testified that, beginning in 2006, Barrett was moved into a\ncondominium that her parents owned. This arrangement was facilitated by support\nstaff trained to help persons like Barrett live independently. According to Dr.\nThomas, Barrett‘s outbursts continued. The Center documented 30 incidents in\nthe 18-month period before the hearing. Typically, Barrett became agitated about\npersonal matters, and responded by assaulting family members or staff, damaging\nproperty, and committing certain forms of self-abuse. Dr. Thomas noted that\n―furniture and pictures and all kinds of things had to be removed from her\napartment just to keep her safe.‖6\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\n\nand it was difficult to distinguish between them in that sense, the ―limited\ncognitive ability‖ associated with mental retardation played a central role in\ncausing her dangerousness. According to Dr. Thomas, it was Barrett‘s inability to\nunderstand that she was mentally disordered and needed treatment that most\nimpaired her past progress and prognosis.\n6      For example, in September 2008, Barrett was ―obsessing‖ at home about\nher hair color when she learned her mother would arrive soon. Barrett became\nupset, broke a chair and other furnishings, and was restrained by staff when she\nshowed aggression toward her mother. Barrett then locked herself in the\n                                                          (footnote continued on next page)\n\n                                          6\n\f        In light of this evidence, Dr. Thomas recommended that Barrett be\ncommitted to a particular secure treatment facility — the same one that was\nserving as interim housing at the time of the hearing. He explained that it was the\nleast restrictive placement. Barrett‘s history showed that she could not safely\nreside in either a less secure group home or an independent living situation.\n        Barrett testified as the only witness on her behalf. She did not like her\ncurrent placement because, even though the people were nice and the food was\ngood, she could not go on outings and preferred the group home. She liked her\nmedication because it calmed her, but denied being mentally disordered.\n        Following closing argument, the trial court found that, notwithstanding any\nother disorders, Barrett was mentally retarded and dangerous under section 6500,\nand that the danger she posed to herself and others was based upon, and caused by,\nher mental retardation. She was committed to the Department for one year\nbeginning on April 8, 2009, the date of the hearing. The court designated the\n\n\n\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\n\nbathroom, but became docile when the police arrived and took her to a psychiatric\nunit for evaluation. Later that month, Barrett was crying in her bedroom when she\nsuddenly emerged and punched holes in the walls. She threw a glass bowl at a\nwindow, breaking the window on the second try. Two months later, in December\n2008, Barrett refused to leave home for a mental health appointment. She\nthreatened to harm staff, destroyed property, and purposefully scratched her face\nto make it bleed. This episode triggered a 9-1-1 call and admission to a\npsychiatric unit. Finally, two incidents occurred in January 2009. First, Barrett\ncame home upset after attending church with her parents. She assaulted staff and\nwas hospitalized for emergency psychiatric care. Later that month, at the Center,\nBarrett cursed and angrily announced that she had changed her name. She\nthreatened to harm staff with a knife, and then entered the bathroom and scratched\nher arm.\n\n\n                                           7\n\fsecure treatment facility then being used as interim housing as the least restrictive\nand most appropriate placement.7\n       On appeal, Barrett focused on the lack of a jury at her commitment trial.\nBased on the premise that she had a constitutional right to a jury decision on the\nallegations of the petition, Barrett argued that due process and equal protection\nprinciples were violated insofar as the record did not show that the trial court\nadvised her of the right to a jury, or elicited a valid waiver of that right before\nholding a bench trial. She relied on two cases — both from the Third District\nCourt of Appeal — imposing these requirements in section 6500 proceedings.\n(People v.

The court contemplated that, in the\nensuing three-month period, either the Center or Barrett‘s treatment facility would\nconduct a full evaluation of her psychiatric history. No further testing was\nordered. The record contains no other information about the July 2009 hearing or\nabout any other trial court proceeding after the April 2009 commitment hearing.\nIndeed, we infer that the original commitment order ―expire[d] automatically‖ by\nits own terms one year after it was made (§ 6500), and that it therefore is\ntechnically moot. Because the issues are of recurring importance and properly\npresented by the parties, we decide the case on the merits. (See, e.g.,\nConservatorship of John L.

This approach warranted rejection of Barrett‘s\nconstitutional claims, the court said, because her competence on jury trial matters\nwas in doubt given the nature of the issues raised under section 6500. The Court\nof Appeal further reasoned that the failure of the defense to request a jury\ngenerally waives the right, and that the apparent absence of such a request here\nprecluded a finding that a jury had been wrongly denied. The judgment was\naffirmed. Barrett sought review.\n                       II. STATUTORY BACKGROUND\n       California has no fewer than nine involuntary commitment procedures that\nmay apply to persons who have various mental problems, and who pose a threat to\ntheir own welfare or to the safety of others. Some of these laws, including section\n6500 et seq., operate in a manner largely independent of the criminal justice\nsystem. (See §§ 4825 [developmentally disabled persons under the LDDSA],\n5000 et seq. [mentally ill persons under the LPS Act].) Others apply depending on\nwhether a criminal prosecution has occurred. (See § 3000 et seq. [narcotic addicts\nwhether or not they have been convicted of crimes].) Certain accused criminals\nmay receive a mental health commitment in lieu of conviction and punishment.\n(See Pen. Code, §§ 1026-1027 [defendants acquitted by reason of insanity], 1367\net seq. [defendants found mentally incompetent].) Also, dangerously disordered\noffenders may be held upon discharge by the juvenile authorities (see Welf. &\nInst. Code, § 1800 et seq.), or after serving a prison term (see § 6600 et seq.\n\n\n                                          9\n\f[sexually violent predators]; Pen. Code, § 2960 et seq. [mentally disordered\noffenders]).\n       The statutory scheme applied here has been in effect for over 40 years.8\nThe basic rule is that ―no mentally retarded person may be committed‖ to the\nDepartment ―unless he or she is a danger to himself or herself, or others.‖\n(§ 6500.) Dangerousness includes a finding of incompetence to stand trial under\nPenal Code section 1367 et seq., for accused criminals in certain serious and\nviolent cases. (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 6500.) For mentally retarded persons under\nthe care or treatment of a state hospital or other facility when the petition is filed,\nproof of a recent overt act is not needed to find them to be a danger to themselves\nor others. (Ibid.)\n       A section 6500 proceeding commences under certain conditions. First,\ndesignated persons ―may request‖ that a petition for commitment be filed by an\n―authorized‖ official, as discussed further below. (§ 6502.)9 In general,\nindividuals allowed to make this ―request‖ are those charged with the support of\nthe mentally retarded person, are representatives of the juvenile or criminal justice\n\n8      See former section 6500.1, added by Statutes 1970, chapter 351, section 3,\npage 765, and renumbered as section 6500 and amended by Statutes 1978, chapter\n1319, section 2, page 4316; see also sections 6502-6512 (exclusive of § 6504.5),\nadded by Statutes 1967, chapter 1667, section 37, page 4107, operative July 1,\n1969.\n9      Section 6502 states, in pertinent part: ―The following persons may request\nthe person authorized to present allegations pursuant to Section 6500 to file a\npetition for commitment: [¶] (a) The parent, guardian, conservator, or other\nperson charged with the support of the mentally retarded person. [¶] (b) The\nprobation officer. [¶] (c) The Youth Authority. [¶] (d) Any person designated\nfor that purpose by the judge of the court. [¶] (e) The Director of Corrections. [¶]\n(f) The regional center director or his or her designee. [¶] The request shall state\nthe petitioner‘s reasons for supposing the person to be eligible for admission\nthereto, and shall be verified by affidavit.‖\n\n\n                                           10\n\fsystem, are designated by the court, or — as in the present case — serve as the\ndirector of a regional center, or as his or her designee. (§ 6502.)10 This provision\nappears to assume that the requesting party is familiar with the person sought to be\ncommitted, or has access to relevant information about the person‘s condition and\nhistory. Indeed, any ―request‖ made under section 6502 must document or\notherwise state ―reasons‖ for asserting that the person is eligible for commitment.\nAny request containing such information also must be ―verified by affidavit.‖\n(Ibid.)\n          Second, allegations that a person is mentally retarded and dangerous are\npresented to the superior court in petition form by either the district attorney or\ncounty counsel, as determined by the county board of supervisors. (§ 6500; see\n§ 6502.) Where a petition is filed, the court appoints the director of the regional\ncenter, or a designee, to examine the person and submit a written report.\n(§ 6504.5.)11 The report must include an evaluation of the person, as well as a\n\n10     Under the LDDSA, regional centers consist of a network of ―private\nnonprofit community agencies‖ (§ 4620, subd. (b)) with which the state, through\nthe Department, contracts to provide lifetime support directly to developmentally\ndisabled persons and their families. (Id., subd. (a); see § 4512, subd. (a) [defining\n― ‗developmental disability‘ ‖ to include mental retardation].) Regional centers\nassess clients by reviewing their diagnostic history, and providing or procuring a\nwide range of tests and evaluations. (See §§ 4642, 4643.) In each case, the center\nestablishes both a ― ‗planning team‘ ‖ (§ 4512, subd. (j)) and an ―individual\nprogram plan‖ identifying goals and needs (§ 4646). A high priority is ―direct\nservice coordination‖ (§ 4640.6, subd. (a)), in which services are obtained from\nproviders, vendors, and contractors. (See §§ 4640.7, 4647, 4648.) A regional\ncenter employee, or ― ‗service coordinator,‘ ‖ prepares individual program plans,\nsecures needed services, and provides placement and monitoring support.\n(§ 4640.6, subd. (d); see Morohoshi v. Pacific Home (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2634509\"><a href=\"/opinion/2634509/morohoshi-v-pacific-home/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">482</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 487-\n488.)\n11     Section 6504.5 states, in pertinent part: ―Wherever a petition is filed [under\nsection 6500 et seq.], the court shall appoint the director of a regional center for\n                                                            (footnote continued on next page)\n\n                                           11\n\frecommendation for placement both on an interim basis pending the evidentiary\nhearing and after any commitment decision is made. (§ 6504.5, see §§ 6506,\n6509, subd. (a).) Relevant factors include the least restrictive residential option\nneeded to achieve treatment goals and maintain public safety. (§ 6504.5.) A\nseparate report along similar lines may be submitted by any developmental center\nrecommended for placement in the regional center report. (Ibid.)\n        Within a limited time after the petition is filed, the court must set an\nevidentiary hearing. (§ 6503; see § 6504 [notice of hearing].) A suitable interim\nplacement may be ordered pending the hearing, with consideration given to the\nreports and recommendations of the regional center and any developmental center\ninvolved in the case. Again, relevant concerns include the least restrictive\narrangement that promotes treatment and protects public safety. (§ 6506.)\n\n\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\n\nthe developmentally disabled established under [section 4500 et seq.], or the\ndesignee of the director, to examine the alleged mentally retarded person.

[¶] The\n[foregoing] reports . . . shall also address suitable interim placements . . .

Thus, for persons who lack their own attorney, the court ―shall\nimmediately appoint‖ counsel to represent them. (§ 6500.)12 The court is also\ndirected to ―inquire‖ into the person‘s condition, and to thereby enhance the\navailability of evidence on this issue. (§ 6507.) Thus, the court may subpoena\nqualified physicians and psychologists to examine the person and to testify about\nhis or her ―mentality.‖ (Ibid.) The attendance of other witnesses also may be\ncompelled. (Ibid.; see § 6508 [authorizing witness fees and expenses].)\n       The requisite findings of mental retardation and dangerousness allow the\nperson to be ―committed to the [Department] for suitable treatment and\nhabilitation services.‖ (§ 6509, subd. (a).) The same statute requires selection of\nthe ―least restrictive residential placement‖ to meet these goals, identifies a range\nof available facilities (e.g., state hospitals and community care centers), and\npermits other appropriate dispositions (e.g., conditional release into the\ncommunity) that do not risk the welfare of the person or the public. (Ibid.)\nSpecific procedures guide the court in selecting an appropriate placement,\nincluding consideration of the regional center report submitted under section\n6504.5. (§ 6509, subd. (a).)\n       An order of commitment ―expire[s] automatically one year after‖ it is\nmade. (§ 6500.) Subsequent commitments for additional periods may be sought\n\n\n\n\n12     Section 6500 states, in pertinent part: ―In any proceedings conducted under\nthe authority of [section 6500 et seq.], the alleged mentally retarded person shall\nbe informed of his or her right to counsel by the court, and if the person does not\nhave an attorney for the proceedings, the court shall immediately appoint the\npublic defender or other attorney to represent him or her.‖\n\n\n                                          13\n\ffor persons who remain mentally retarded and dangerous. Recommitment\nprocedures are ―the same as with an initial petition for commitment.‖ (Ibid.)\n                                 III. DISCUSSION\n       Preliminarily, no statute by its plain terms authorizes a jury to determine\nwhether someone is mentally retarded and dangerous for purposes of a section\n6500 commitment. The lack of any jury trial provision distinguishes the statutory\nprocedures regulating section 6500 proceedings from most other involuntary\ncommitment schemes, as we discuss further below.\n       Nevertheless, here, as in the Court of Appeal, there is no dispute that\nsomeone facing commitment under section 6500 et seq. has the right to trial by\njury on the allegations of the petition. Neither party rests this premise on any\nprovision of the federal or state Constitution that directly or expressly grants the\nright to a jury in criminal or civil trials.13 Rather, they invoke a long and\nunbroken line of California appellate court cases holding or assuming — largely\non the basis of federal and state equal protection principles affecting fundamental\ninterests — that persons alleged to be mentally retarded and dangerous cannot be\ndenied a jury altogether where jury trials are granted by statute to persons alleged\nto be mentally impaired and dangerous under comparable commitment laws.\n\n\n\n\n13      See, e.g., the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution (―In all\ncriminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to . . . an impartial jury‖);\narticle I, section 16 of the California Constitution (―Trial by jury is an inviolate\nright and shall be secured to all, but in a civil cause three-fourths of the jury may\nrender a verdict. A jury may be waived in a criminal cause by the consent of both\nparties expressed in open court by the defendant and the defendant‘s counsel. In a\ncivil cause a jury may be waived by the consent of the parties expressed as\nprescribed by statute‖).\n\n\n                                          14\n\fThus, persons like Barrett ―are entitled to jury trial upon request.‖ (O‘Brien v.\nSuperior Court (1976) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2130614\"><a href=\"/opinion/2130614/obrien-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 69.)14\n       We now assess the adequacy of this basic rule, and decide whether\nadditional adjunct procedures must be followed in open court for a valid nonjury\ntrial to occur. Each of Barrett‘s theories under the due process and equal\nprotection clauses of the federal and state Constitutions is examined in turn.\nA. Due Process Claim\n       Barrett contends it is not sufficient for federal and state due process\npurposes that the courts have implied a right to trial by jury to protect the interests\nat stake in section 6500 proceedings. She claims the jury trial option needs its\nown supplemental layer of support. In other words, the decision whether to try the\ncase to the court or to a jury belongs solely to the person facing commitment, and\nit must be made personally, not through counsel. Under this view, any waiver of a\njury trial is not knowing and intelligent, and is invalid, unless the court first\nexpressly advises the person of that right. Because the record shows no such\n\n\n\n14     See People v. Wilkinson (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">185</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Alluding to the rules generally applicable in civil\ncases, the People insist a waiver meets due process requirements where, as here,\nthe record does not show that counsel, who presumably made an informed and\ncompetent decision in this regard, requested a jury before the section 6500 trial\nbegan.15 The People have the better view.\n       This court observed long ago that section 6500 proceedings are not criminal\nin nature, and that commitment under this scheme, though involuntary, is not\npunishment.

(See Ben C., supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2632539\"><a href=\"/opinion/2632539/in-re-conservatorship-of-ben-c/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">529</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 538.) She observes, and we\n                                          17\n\fagree, that section 6500 proceedings potentially involve a significant restraint on\nliberty. Whether the requisite findings of mental retardation and dangerousness\nare made by the court or a jury, the person is ordered committed to the Department\nfor up to one year. Recommitment may be sought if the person‘s condition has not\nmaterially changed during that time. Although the least restrictive placement is\nrequired under the particular circumstances, several statutory options involve\ncustodial control. They include confinement in a secure facility to treat the\nmentally retarded person and to protect the public from the dangers that he or she\npresents. (See §§ 6500, 6509, subd. (a).) Such was the case with Barrett.\n       In addition, we have said that persons facing commitment have a\n― ‗dignitary interest‘ ‖ in being informed of the ― ‗nature, grounds, and\nconsequences‘ ‖ of the proceeding, and in presenting ― ‗their side of the story‘ ‖\nbefore a determination is made. (Allen, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2584879\"><a href=\"/opinion/2584879/people-v-allen/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">843</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 862; see id. at\np. 868 [identifying statutory procedures that protect due process dignitary interests\nof alleged sexually violent predators under § 6600 et seq.]; accord, Moore, supra,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2631933\"><a href=\"/opinion/2631933/moore-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">802</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 819, 824.) It bears emphasis that Barrett does not highlight this\nfactor, or identify any specific flaws in the statutory scheme in this regard. (See\n§§ 6502 [petition must be supported by verified ―request‖ from informed party,\nand must state ―reasons‖ for commitment], 6504 [notice of hearing], 6504.5\n[mental examination and written report required by regional center director or\ndesignee], 6500 [right to counsel], 6507 [availability of expert testimony and other\nwitnesses on mental retardation].)\n       As Barrett suggests, the foregoing interests have been deemed sufficiently\nfundamental to implicate certain constitutional jury trial concerns in commitment\ncases, at least in those relatively few instances in which a right to trial by jury has\nnot been legislatively prescribed. It does not follow, however, that the jury trial\noption implied by the courts in section 6500 proceedings is illusory unless\n                                          18\n\faccompanied by the ancillary procedures Barrett seeks. Nor do such procedures\nnecessarily amount to independent constitutional rights applicable in every case.\nInstead, their due process availability depends, in a particular instance, on a\ncareful balancing of the public and private interests described above.\n       In this regard, Barrett fails to consider, and we must now address, the\nspecial character of the commitment proceeding at issue. This consideration\nundermines her due process claim.\n       The controlling principles appear in our unanimous decision in People v.\nMasterson (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2611845\"><a href=\"/opinion/2611845/people-v-masterson/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">965</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Masterson). There, the defendant was charged\nby felony complaint with violent crimes. Before the preliminary hearing, the\nmagistrate declared a doubt as to the defendant‘s mental competence to stand trial.\n(See Pen. Code, § 1367.) The matter was sent to the superior court for a\ncompetence hearing.\n       For the hearing, a panel of 12 jurors was chosen to hear evidence and\ndecide competence. Shortly before the presentation of evidence was set to begin,\ncounsel for both sides and the defendant were present in court. However, only 11\njurors appeared. The 12th juror apparently was missing. The prosecutor and\ndefense counsel agreed that the matter could be tried by a jury consisting of the 11\npanelists in court at the time. When asked by the trial court whether he understood\nthis stipulation, the defendant made clear that he rejected its terms. He told the\ncourt that he would ― ‗rather have 12 jurors.‘ ‖ (Masterson, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2611845\"><a href=\"/opinion/2611845/people-v-masterson/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">965</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n967.) When asked pointblank if he objected to the stipulation allowing an 11-\nperson jury, the defendant said, ― ‗Yes.‘ ‖ (Id. at p. 968.)\n       Over the defendant‘s objection, and consistent with counsel‘s approach, the\ncompetence trial was held in front of only 11 jurors. They unanimously found the\ndefendant mentally competent. A different jury then convicted him of the charged\ncrimes. On appeal, the judgment was reversed on the ground that use of an 11-\n                                          19\n\fperson jury to decide competence over the defendant‘s personal objection\nconstituted prejudicial error. This court reversed the Court of Appeal.\n       The critical question in Masterson was whether defense counsel could\n―waive the right to a jury trial entirely,‖ even if the defendant objected.\n(Masterson, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2611845\"><a href=\"/opinion/2611845/people-v-masterson/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">965</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 968.) If so, counsel would necessarily have the\nlesser authority, so to speak, of agreeing to a jury of fewer than the usual 12\npersons. (Id. at p. 969; see Cal. Const., art. I, § 16; Code Civ. Proc., § 220.)\n       Masterson first emphasized that in all cases, civil and criminal, ― ‗a party‘s\nattorney has general authority to control the procedural aspects of the litigation\nand, indeed, to bind the client in these matters . . . .‘ ‖ Counsel, not the client, ― ‗is\ncaptain of the ship.‘ ‖ (Masterson, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2611845\"><a href=\"/opinion/2611845/people-v-masterson/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">965</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 969.)\n       Of course, an exception to this broad rule exists in criminal cases in which\nthe defendant has a state constitutional right to a jury trial that can only be\nexpressly and personally waived. (Masterson, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2611845\"><a href=\"/opinion/2611845/people-v-masterson/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">965</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 969, citing\nCal. Const., art. I, § 16, & People v. Ernst (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1451334\"><a href=\"/opinion/1451334/people-v-ernst/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">441</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) Masterson\nobserved, however, that a mental competence proceeding, though a byproduct of\nthe underlying criminal prosecution, is not itself a criminal action in which the\nstate constitutional requirement of an express personal waiver applies. Nor is it a\ncivil action. It is a ― ‗special proceeding‘ ‖ in which the right to trial by jury is\nwholly statutory. (Masterson, at p. 969; see Pen. Code, § 1369, subds. (a)-(f)\n[describing mental examinations, evidence, argument, and instructions in any\n―trial by court or jury of the question of mental competence‖].)\n       Against this backdrop, Masterson concluded that it ―need not decide‖\nwhether the statutory nature of the jury trial right in a criminal mental competence\nproceeding dictates the circumstances under which it can be waived, i.e., whether\nthere are some statutory rights that counsel may not waive on the client‘s behalf or\nover his objection. (Masterson, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2611845\"><a href=\"/opinion/2611845/people-v-masterson/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">965</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 970.) Rather, the validity of\n                                           20\n\fcounsel‘s decision to dispense with a 12-person jury — like the larger question\nwhether to have a jury at all — rested primarily upon ―the nature of competency\nproceedings‖ and the issues addressed therein. (Id. at p. 971.)\n       Masterson then made the following key point: ―The sole purpose of a\ncompetency proceeding is to determine the defendant‘s present mental\ncompetence, i.e., whether the defendant is able to understand the nature of the\ncriminal proceedings and to assist counsel in a rational manner. [Citations.]\nBecause of this, the defendant necessarily plays a lesser personal role in the\nproceeding than in a trial of guilt. How can a person whose competence is in\ndoubt make basic decisions regarding the conduct of a proceeding to determine\nthat very question?‖ (Masterson, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2611845\"><a href=\"/opinion/2611845/people-v-masterson/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">965</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 971.)\n       In answering this question adversely to the defendant, Masterson relied\nheavily on People v. Hill (1967) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1801607\"><a href=\"/opinion/1801607/people-v-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Hill). In Hill, after both the trial\ncourt and defense counsel expressed doubt about an alleged felon‘s mental\ncompetence, a hearing was held in which the defendant received new counsel. For\nreasons not clear from record, the competence issue was tried by the court, not a\njury. The trial court found the defendant competent and he was later tried and\nconvicted of the charged crimes. Ultimately, in Hill, this court rejected the\ndefendant‘s claim that his convictions should be reversed because, in the\ncompetence proceeding, he had not personally waived a jury, or been advised\neither by the court or counsel of his right to request a jury trial.\n       As noted in Masterson, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2611845\"><a href=\"/opinion/2611845/people-v-masterson/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">965</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 971, this court made clear in\nHill, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1801607\"><a href=\"/opinion/1801607/people-v-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 114, that there is ―no duty in a judge‖ to advise the\ndefendant about his jury trial right in a mental competency proceeding, at least\nwhere he or she is represented by counsel. Also, Masterson observed, when the\npreliminary evidence is sufficient to trigger a mental competence hearing, ― ‗it\nshould be assumed that [the defendant] is unable to act in his own best interests.\n                                           21\n\fIn such circumstances counsel must be free to act even contrary to the express\ndesires of his client.‘ ‖ (Masterson, at p. 971, quoting Hill, at p. 115, fn. 4.)\nAccording to Masterson, it is settled that, ― ‗as a matter of tactics counsel may,\nwithout consulting defendant, waive defendant‘s statutory right to demand that a\njury decide his competence.‘ ‖ (Masterson, at p. 972, quoting People v. Samuel\n(1981) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1271868\"><a href=\"/opinion/1271868/people-v-samuel/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 496 [summarizing Hill].)\n       Accordingly, Masterson held that ―counsel may waive the right to a jury\ntrial in a competency proceeding, and the court need not advise the defendant of\nthat right.‖ (Masterson, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2611845\"><a href=\"/opinion/2611845/people-v-masterson/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">965</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 972.) Hence, Masterson concluded,\nno error occurred insofar as counsel stipulated to a jury of 11 persons. It also\nmade no difference that the defendant in Masterson had personally opposed the\nstipulation in open court. In light of the initial doubts expressed about his mental\ncompetence (which the 11-person jury did not sustain), the defendant could not\n―veto‖ counsel‘s professional judgment or decisional authority in jury trial\nmatters. (Id. at p. 973.)16\n\n\n16      At one point, Masterson, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2611845\"><a href=\"/opinion/2611845/people-v-masterson/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">965</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 972, linked its assumptions\nabout a criminal defendant‘s limited capacity to play a personal role in the\ncompetence hearing to what prior cases had called a ― ‗prima facie showing‘ ‖ of\nincompetence. More accurately, the Legislature contemplates that, in the\nunderlying criminal case, the trial court has entertained a ―doubt‖ on competence\n(Pen. Code, § 1368, subd. (a)) and/or counsel has expressed a similar ―belie[f].‖\n(Id., subd. (b).) Because due process bars any criminal defendant from being tried\nwhile mentally unsound, a competence hearing is required if ―substantial\nevidence‖ raises a ― ‗reasonable doubt‘ ‖on the issue. (People v. Lawley (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2585200\"><a href=\"/opinion/2585200/people-v-lawley/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 131, and cases cited.) Of course, different procedures and formalities\naccompany a Welfare and Institutions Code section 6500 matter, which does not\nnecessarily arise out of, or have any connection to, a criminal case. This does not\nmean, however, that before any section 6500 trial, no substantial doubts have been\nraised about the person‘s cognitive condition, or that no evidentiary support for the\nallegations of mental retardation exists. As we shall explain, a section 6500\n                                                             (footnote continued on next page)\n\n                                           22\n\f        Not surprisingly, this court has determined that persons who are mentally\nimpaired for reasons other than those present in Masterson, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2611845\"><a href=\"/opinion/2611845/people-v-masterson/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">965</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\nalso cannot ― ‗ ―act in [their] own best interests‖ ‘ ‖ when committed.

No definition of mental retardation appears in\nsection 6500 or elsewhere in the statutory scheme. However, the Legislature has\nmade clear under a neighboring law, the LDDSA, that mental retardation — like\ncerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism — constitutes a ― ‗[d]evelopmental\ndisability.‘ ‖ (§ 4512, subd. (a).) As such, the condition ―originates before an\nindividual attains age 18 years, continues, or can be expected to continue,\nindefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for that individual.‖ (Ibid.)\n        More to the point, it is understood for section 6500 commitment purposes\nthat mental retardation involves ― ‗ ―significantly subaverage general intellectual\nfunctioning existing concurrently with deficits in adaptive behavior,‖ and\nappearing in the ―developmental period.‖ ‘ ‖ (Money, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2159260\"><a href=\"/opinion/2159260/money-v-krall/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

(Money, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2159260\"><a href=\"/opinion/2159260/money-v-krall/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Still, the significant cognitive and intellectual deficits that\nthe condition entails, which appear early in life and never recede, affect the ability\nto ―make basic decisions‖ regarding the conduct of the section 6500 proceeding.\n(Masterson, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2611845\"><a href=\"/opinion/2611845/people-v-masterson/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">965</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 971.) Such an individual thus plays a limited\n―personal role‖ in the case, and must rely on counsel to decide all tactical and\nprocedural matters, such as whether to exercise the jury trial right. (Ibid.)\n       Applying these circumstances to the due process principles discussed\nabove, we disagree with Barrett that ―the private interests at stake‖ play a\npredominant or dispositive role in the analysis. (Allen, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2584879\"><a href=\"/opinion/2584879/people-v-allen/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">843</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n863.) We cannot ignore limits in a section 6500 proceeding on the person‘s ability\nto comprehend and control procedural matters, including the decision whether to\nexercise the right to a jury trial. It follows that the collateral procedures Barrett\nseeks, involving an express advisement and personal waiver, would have little\neffect on enhancing either the jury trial right itself or the vital interests it protects.\nHence, these factors do not weigh in favor of finding a constitutional violation to\nthe extent the requested procedures were not used at her commitment trial.\n       Barrett further suggests that such a conclusion violates due process because\nit improperly ―presumes‖ that a person is mentally retarded before the fact finder\nhas decided the issue. Again, we are not persuaded. As we explain, no section\n                                            24\n\f6500 proceeding is brought or pursued in an evidentiary vacuum or without\ncompetent support.\n       First, the filing of a section 6500 petition is requested by a responsible and\ninterested party (e.g., parent, conservator, correctional or probation official, or\nregional center director), who presents specific information (reasons) for\nsupposing that the person is mentally retarded and dangerous, in need of treatment,\nand eligible for commitment. The significance of this request, and its role in\nproviding a foundation for the petition and commitment process, is underscored by\nthe verification requirement. (§ 6502.) Here, the petition alleged that a request for\ncommitment was duly made by the Center, which provided Barrett with regular\ncare and support. In the process, the Center submitted assessments, evaluations,\nand reports necessary to support the allegations that Barrett was mentally retarded\nand dangerous. These documents were incorporated by reference into the petition\nand attached as an exhibit for the court‘s confidential use in the section 6500 case.\n       Second, where a section 6500 petition is filed, the trial court is entitled to a\nwritten report prepared by, or at the behest of, the director of the regional center,\nfollowing an examination of the alleged mentally retarded person. (§ 6504.5.)\nRegional centers specialize in assessing and assisting mentally retarded and other\ndevelopmentally disabled persons on an individual basis. (See ante, at p. 11,\nfn. 10.) Thus, the regional center report obviously serves as a professional pretrial\nevaluation of the person‘s history, condition, and behavior, and includes informed\nrecommendations on treatment and placement, including any interim placement\npending the hearing. According to the petition here, the Center supplied\nassessments, evaluations, and reports about Barrett in seeking to commit her as\nmentally retarded and dangerous under section 6500.\n       In light of these principles and authorities, we conclude that someone like\nBarrett, who is alleged to be mentally retarded and dangerous under section 6500,\n                                          25\n\fis not in a position to personally assert or waive the right to jury trial, to\nsufficiently comprehend the jury trial advisement, or to override the views of\ncounsel on the subject. Sole control over such tactical and procedural decisions\nrests with counsel, whether or not the client has been consulted or objects.\nMoreover, absent any requirement of a personal waiver, the person facing\ncommitment has no need for an express court advisement of the right to request a\njury trial. Thus, no fundamental interest requires us to hold that the nonjury trial\nin this case violated Barrett‘s due process rights insofar as the record does not\nshow that she personally declined a jury or was told of the right to request one.\n       We also agree with the People‘s related suggestion that the defense must\naffirmatively and timely request a jury trial, and that the apparent failure to do so,\nreflected by the lack of evidence in the record that such a request was made,\nresults in a valid and enforceable waiver. (See ante, at p. 16, fn. 15 [Code Civ.\nProc, § 631, subd. (d)].) As noted, a statutory right to counsel exists under\nWelfare and Institutions Code section 6500. Counsel is presumed competent and\ninformed as to applicable constitutional and statutory law. This presumption\nnecessarily includes the defense right to seek a jury trial in a section 6500\nproceeding, regardless of any court advisement. Counsel also can be expected,\nwhere necessary or advisable, to consult with the client about jury trial concerns.\n(See John L., supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">131</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 154-156 [due process claim rejected on the\nbasis of similar assumptions that counsel consulted with the client in an LPS Act\nconservatorship proceeding under § 5350, and knowingly entered a binding waiver\nof any presence and trial rights by informing the court of the client‘s consent].) It\nfollows that where no defense request for a jury trial appears on the record, we can\nproperly infer that this omission and the ensuing bench trial were the product of an\ninformed tactical choice. Counsel has absolute authority to bind the client.

Alvas emphasized the need for a knowing and intelligent waiver of that\nright. In doing so, however, Alvas ignored the factors we deem most relevant —\nthe individual‘s limited ability to personally make a jury trial decision, counsel‘s\nsole authority to do so, and the lack of any need for a jury trial advisement in this\nregard. Insofar as People v. Alvas, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2126404\"><a href=\"/opinion/2126404/people-v-alvas/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

She seems to envision a cumbersome process in\nwhich the court holds (1) a pretrial evidentiary hearing on whether the person is so\nmentally retarded that counsel must handle all jury trial issues, and (2) a full-\nblown trial in which the fact finder (judge or jury) decides whether the person is so\nmentally retarded and dangerous as to warrant commitment.\n       However, when assessing competing due process concerns, courts are not\nblind to the ― ‗administrative burdens‘ ‖ and ―practical difficulties‖ of demanding\nnew procedures.

Equal Protection Claim\n       Barrett argues that federal and state equal protection principles require\nsection 6500 proceedings to involve the same jury trial safeguards that apply under\nthe LPS Act to proceedings in which already confined patients who pose a\n―demonstrated danger‖ as a result of ―mental disorder or mental defect‖ may be\nretained for a further 180 days of intensive custodial treatment. (§ 5300, subds.\n(a)-(c); see § 5300 et seq. [postcertification procedures for imminently dangerous\npersons].) Specifically, under section 5302, the superior court must give an\n―advise[ment]‖ when the 180-day LPS Act proceeding begins that, among other\nthings, the patient has a statutory ―right to demand a jury trial‖ on the allegations\nof the petition. (Ibid.; see §§ 5301 [describing petition for postcertification\ntreatment], 5303 [authorizing ―requests [for] a jury trial‖ at the time of the hearing\non such petitions].)17 Barrett insists that persons who are allegedly mentally\n\n17      Section 5302 states: ―At the time of filing a petition for postcertification\ntreatment the court shall advise the person named in the petition of his right to be\nrepresented by an attorney and of his right to demand a jury trial. The court shall\nassist him in finding an attorney, or, if need be, appoint an attorney if the person is\nunable to obtain counsel. The court shall appoint the public defender or other\nattorney to represent the person named in the petition if the person is financially\nunable to provide his own attorney.

(People v. McKee\n(2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2591905\"><a href=\"/opinion/2591905/people-v-mckee/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1172</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1199, and cases cited.)

Where two or more groups are properly distinguishable for\npurposes of the challenged law, it is immaterial if they are indistinguishable in\nother respects. (Cooley, supra, at p. 253.) Nor, absent this threshold requirement,\nis an equal protection inquiry into the justification for any legislative distinction\nnecessary. (See Gary W., at pp. 304, 306.)\n       Barrett offers no analysis of the language, history, or function of section\n5302 to facilitate the requisite constitutional comparison with jury trial procedures\nin section 6500 cases. She simply seems to assume for equal protection purposes\n— consistent with her views in the due process context — that the express\nadvisement in section 5302 is intended to ensure that dangerously disordered\npatients facing 180-day LPS Act commitments make an informed personal choice\nabout whether to exercise their right to request a jury trial under section 5303.\n                                          29\n\f         However, we need not decide the meaning or purpose of section 5302 to\nresolve whether equal protection requires a similar jury trial advisement in section\n6500 proceedings. Nor must we address the circumstances under which a 180-day\nLPS Act candidate may, either acting alone or through counsel, properly waive a\njury trial and submit to a court trial under section 5303. Assuming for argument‘s\nsake that Barrett‘s view of section 5302 is correct, and assuming further that\ndangerous mentally retarded persons and dangerous mentally disordered persons\nare similarly situated as to the existence of a basic jury trial right, nothing compels\nthe conclusion that they are also similarly situated as to the ancillary purpose that\nan express jury trial advisement, and an express personal waiver, purportedly\nserve.\n         As the People suggest, the critical factor is the distinct ―mentality‖ (§ 6507)\ncovered by the two schemes. Section 6500 et seq. governs commitments of\ndangerous mentally retarded persons, while the LPS Act is a comprehensive\nscheme for the involuntary detention, evaluation, and treatment of ―mentally ill‖\nindividuals. (Conservatorship of Susan T. (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2611902\"><a href=\"/opinion/2611902/conservatorship-of-susan-t/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1005</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1008\n(Susan T.).) For purposes of the LPS Act, such a mentally ill person is anyone\nwho, ―as a result of mental disorder, is a danger to others, or to himself or herself,\nor gravely disabled.‖ (§ 5150; see John L., supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">131</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 142.)\nIntervention occurs on a limited basis through successive statutory periods which\nare initially quite brief (§ 5150 [72 hours]), and which are ―carefully calibrated‖ to\nincrease over time. (Ben C., supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2632539\"><a href=\"/opinion/2632539/in-re-conservatorship-of-ben-c/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">529</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 541; see, e.g., §§ 5250 [14\ndays], 5270.15 [30 days], 5300 [180 days].) The process culminates in a one-year\nconservatorship (§ 5361) for persons who are ―gravely disabled‖ (§ 5350) as a\nresult of their mental disorders. (See § 5008, subd. (h)(1) & (2) [defining\n― ‗gravely disabled‘ ‖]; see id., subd.

Courts applying the LPS Act\nand similar commitment schemes have sought to fill this gap. Mental illness and\nrelated disorders are said to be conditions that may arise suddenly and, for the first\ntime, in adulthood. (Heller, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112896\"><a href=\"/opinion/112896/heller-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 322.) The LPS Act process\nitself assumes that the need for treatment may be temporary, and that disabling\nmental disorders may be intermittent or short-lived.

(Heller, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112896\"><a href=\"/opinion/112896/heller-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 322, citing Addington, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110067\"><a href=\"/opinion/110067/addington-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">418</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 430.)

By\ncontrast, in the case of persons alleged to be mentally retarded and dangerous\nunder section 6500, the commitment process itself raises substantial doubts about\ntheir cognitive and intellectual functioning sufficient to limit the personal and\n                                          31\n\fprocedural role they play. It follows that the two groups are not similarly situated\nas to the function that Barrett implies an advisement like section 5302 serves —\ncomprehending and controlling the decision whether to request a jury trial. Thus,\nany disparate statutory treatment with respect to jury trial advisements does not\ndeprive persons like Barrett of equal protection of the law.\n       The equal protection analysis included in both People v. Alvas, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2126404\"><a href=\"/opinion/2126404/people-v-alvas/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

In finding no valid\nbasis for any disparate statutory treatment as to jury trial advisements, both cases\nsimply assumed that section 6500 defendants are similarly situated with 180-day\nLPS Act candidates. This assumption is flawed and erroneous for reasons we have\nexplained. Hence, both Alvas and Bailie are disapproved to the extent they\nconflict with the views we have expressed.\n       We also reject a further insinuation in Barrett‘s equal protection claim. She\nsuggests that, in not expressly authorizing jury trials or requiring jury trial\nadvisements in section 6500 proceedings, even though several other commitment\nschemes include such rights, the Legislature has arbitrarily decided that alleged\nmentally retarded persons are unsuited to such protection, and has unfairly\nsubjected them to more burdensome procedures than persons facing commitment\nin almost any other circumstance. In essence, Barrett simply implies that if some\nsuch schemes include these provisions, then all must.\n       But an equal protection violation does not occur merely because different\nstatutory procedures have been included in different civil commitment schemes.\n(See Hofferber, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1407561\"><a href=\"/opinion/1407561/conservatorship-of-hofferber/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 172 [Legislature ―may adopt more than one\nprocedure for isolating, treating, and restraining dangerous persons‖].)

Another\napproach to the basic jury trial right is used to civilly commit sexually violent\npredators. (See § 6600 et seq.) Since that scheme‘s enactment in 1995, section\n6603 has stated that the defendant is ―entitled to a trial by jury‖ (§ 6603, subd.\n(a)), and that the ―attorney petitioning for commitment‖ also has ―the right to\ndemand that the trial be before a jury.‖ (Id., subd. (b); see id., subd. (e) [if neither\nparty demands a jury trial, ―the trial shall be before the court without a jury‖].)\nElsewhere, in proceedings to determine the mental competence of criminal\ndefendants, Penal Code section 1369 simply authorizes a ―trial by court or jury,‖\nand regulates the content and chronology of such trials. (See Pen. Code, former\n§ 1369, as amended by Stats. 1974, ch. 1511, § 5, p. 3318, eff.

We decline to invalidate\nthe commitment order entered after her nonjury trial on this ground.21\n\n\n\n\n21      In separate concurring and dissenting opinions, Justices Liu and Werdegar\nlikewise approve the commitment order, but only after crafting their own\nconstitutional theory of equal protection — a theory which contravenes settled law\nand undercuts the Legislature‘s decision not to require jury trial advisements in\nsection 6500 proceedings. Justices Liu and Werdegar are aware that we have\ncorrectly applied the United States Supreme Court‘s prevailing ―rational basis‖\nstandard for analyzing the equal protection claims of mentally retarded persons.\n(Heller, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112896\"><a href=\"/opinion/112896/heller-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 319-321.) Nonetheless, though Justice Liu argues\notherwise, he and Justice Werdegar use the jury trial advisement statutorily\navailable to certain mentally ill patients facing extended 180-day commitments\nunder the LPS Act (see § 5302) to create a new state constitutional jury trial\nadvisement right for mentally retarded persons. Their reason for invoking the\nstate charter is to import federal authority that is outmoded in this context\n(Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc.

(See\nid. at pp. 448, 450.) The standard they propose was, of course, superseded, and\nessentially discarded, in Heller, supra, 509 U.S. at page 321. Ironically, the views\nset forth at length in the concurring and dissenting opinions result in little real-\nworld benefit to Barrett, and, as Justice Liu appears to concede, the right to a jury\ntrial advisement for which he and Justice Werdegar advocate is largely symbolic.\nTheir analyses include the concession, either express or implicit, that Barrett was\nnot necessarily entitled to act on such a direct advisement by personally deciding\nwhether to demand a jury. Moreover, they conclude that to the extent Barrett\nreceived no such advisement, no prejudice occurred in light of undisputed\nevidence that she was both mentally retarded and dangerous. In sum, we find the\nconcurring and dissenting opinions unpersuasive, and we decline to adopt their\nviews or to modify our approach.\n\n\n\n                                         35\n\f                              IV.

But the majority‘s next step in its\nanalysis is unpersuasive: it finds that although mentally ill persons facing\ninvoluntary civil commitment under the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (§ 5000 et\nseq.) are entitled by statute to have the court advise them ―of [their] right to\ndemand a jury trial‖ (§ 5302), persons—like Barrett—who are alleged to be\nmentally retarded and a danger to themselves or others who similarly face\ninvoluntary civil commitment are not entitled to the same jury advisement. As\nJustice Liu explains in his separate opinion, the differences between mentally ill\npersons and those alleged to be mentally retarded ―do not support a categorical\ndistinction between the two groups with respect to a jury right advisement.‖\n(Conc. & dis. opn. of Liu, J., post, at p. 21.)\n       Article I, section 24 of the California Constitution provides that ―[r]ights\nguaranteed by this Constitution are not dependent on those guaranteed by the\nUnited States Constitution.‖ The California Constitution is thus a document of\nindependent force, and the people of this state are not dependent on the United\n\n\n1      All statutory references are to this code.\n\n\n\n                                            1\n\fStates Constitution as the primary source of their protection.

[¶] (j) A right to make choices in their own lives,\nincluding, but not limited to, where and with whom they live, their relationships\nwith people in their community, the way they spend their time, including\neducation, employment, and leisure, the pursuit of their personal future, and\nprogram planning and implementation.‖ (Ibid.)\n       Accordingly, a legal scheme in which Barrett may be forced to live in an\ninstitution, against her will and possibly for the rest of her life, without being told\nshe could have had a jury decide her fate, when the state requires a jury\nadvisement for mentally ill persons facing essentially the same type of\ncommitment (§ 5302), lacks a rational basis and thus violates Barrett‘s right to\nequal protection under the California Constitution.\n       Unlike the United States Constitution, the California Constitution specifies\nthe conditions that must be present before a judgment is reversed. Article VI,\nsection 13 of the California Constitution states: ―No judgment shall be set aside,\nor new trial granted, in any cause . . . for any error as to any matter of procedure,\nunless, after an examination of the entire cause, including the evidence, the court\nshall be of the opinion that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of\njustice.‖ Like Justice Liu, I conclude that the violation of Barrett‘s rights under\nthe state equal protection clause was harmless because it was not reasonably\nprobable she would have achieved a more favorable result had the trial court\n\n                                           4\n\finformed her of her jury trial right.

To the contrary, although Barrett has\nnot demonstrated prejudice resulting from the trial court‘s failure to advise her of\nher jury trial right in the commitment hearing at issue here, she may be able to do\nso in the future if she is recommitted and the error recurs. Moreover, were the\nmajority to endorse, as I do, the state equal protection analysis set forth in Justice\nLiu‘s separate opinion, potential committees in the future would benefit from the\njury trial advisement, thereby fulfilling the statutory directive that such persons\nhave the ―right to make choices in their own lives, including, but not limited to,\nwhere and with whom they live.‖ (§ 4502, subd. (j).)\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\f          CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION BY LIU, J.\n\n       To most people who are thrust into a courtroom, the whir and din of the\nlegal process make for a bewildering experience. Counsel is necessary, but even\ndiligent representation does not always ensure due regard for the dignity of a\nvulnerable yet dangerous individual whose liberty is at stake.\n       In this case, a young woman, Christine Barrett, was found mentally\nretarded and dangerous by a judge, and she was ordered committed to a secure\ntreatment facility. Barrett was not charged with any crime, and the record does not\nshow any criminal history. The order of commitment was for one year, but it is\nrenewable year after year without limit. In all likelihood, the commitment\nproceeding has irreversibly altered the course of her life. And yet, there is no\nindication in the record of the proceedings that the trial court spoke directly to\nBarrett about her rights or any other substantive matter.\n       The trial court found that Barrett, in addition to having mental retardation,\nalso suffered from mental illness. If Barrett had faced prolonged involuntary\ncommitment on the basis of mental illness instead of mental retardation, she would\nhave been statutorily entitled to an advisement by the court of her right to be tried\nby a jury. Barrett contends that the Legislature‘s selectivity — requiring the\nadvisement for mentally ill persons but denying it to persons alleged to be\nmentally retarded — proceeds from the objectionable premise that persons in her\nposition are unworthy of an advisement. As stated in her opening brief, she brings\n\n\n\n                                          1\n\fan equal protection challenge to this disparate treatment on the ground that ―there\nis no justification for depriving all people identified with having an intellectual or\ndevelopmental disability from the opportunity to learn of the right to a jury trial,\nand to act on the information in accordance with their individual abilities.‖\n       I agree with Barrett. Although due process principles do not require\ninvoluntary commitment procedures to include a jury trial advisement either for\npersons who are mentally ill or for persons alleged to be mentally retarded, the\nstatutory requirement of an advisement for one but not the other is unsupported by\nany facts or findings in the record before us. It is supported only by hypothesized\ndifferences concerning the relative abilities of the two groups to understand an\nadvisement. To be sure, many potential committees who are alleged to be\nmentally retarded have disabilities that preclude any meaningful comprehension of\na jury trial advisement. But that is not true of all such persons. Applying our state\nequal protection guarantee (Cal. Const., art. I, § 7, subd. (a)) as informed by\nfederal constitutional precedent (Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc. (1985)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111507\"><a href=\"/opinion/111507/cleburne-v-cleburne-living-center-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Cleburne)), I conclude that there is no rational basis for denying\nBarrett — simply because she was alleged to be mentally retarded — the same\nadvisement and the same dignity afforded by such an advisement to which other\npersons with mental disabilities are statutorily entitled when facing prolonged\ninvoluntary commitment.\n       Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the court‘s denial of Barrett‘s\nequal protection claim. The court says I would ―create a new state constitutional\njury trial advisement right for mentally retarded persons.‖ (Maj. opn., ante, at\np. 35, fn. 21.) To be clear, my view is not that persons with mental retardation\nhave a free-standing constitutional right to an advisement. As explained below,\nmy view is that persons with mental retardation are, on the record before us,\nconstitutionally entitled to the same statutory advisement right that the Legislature\n\n                                           2\n\fhas seen fit to provide to other persons with mental disabilities. But because I\nagree with the Court of Appeal that any failure to advise was harmless under the\ncircumstances here, I concur in the court‘s affirmance of the judgment below.\n\n\n                                          I.\n       Christine Barrett was 27 years old and living in a private residence under\nthe care of the San Andreas Regional Center (Regional Center) when the district\nattorney filed a petition under Welfare and Institutions Code section 6500 to\ncommit her as a person who is ―mentally retarded‖ and ―a danger to herself and\nothers.‖ (All undesignated statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions\nCode.) The petition was filed at the request of Betty Crane, the Regional Center‘s\nservice coordinator. The district attorney requested an evidentiary hearing and an\norder that Barrett be committed to the custody of the Department of\nDevelopmental Services (Department) for up to one year. The petition\nincorporated by reference a declaration from Crane along with ―the assessment,\nevaluations, reports, and other documents‖ of the Regional Center. These were\nfiled with the superior court, and we are treating them as confidential exhibits at\nthe request of the parties. The reports attached to the petition are the only expert\nreports that appear in the record before us; no further reports were submitted by\nthe parties or obtained by the court pursuant to its authority under section 6504.5\nto order a report by the director of the regional center or the director‘s designee.\n       The petition was filed on January 22, 2009. On that date, the court set a\nhearing for March 9, 2009, and placed Barrett under the Department‘s care\npending resolution of the petition. Counsel for both parties appeared on March 9,\nand the matter was continued to April 8 for an evidentiary hearing. The only\nrecord of that hearing is a printed minute order with no substantive information. It\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\fis not clear whether Barrett was present or received any information at that time\nabout the proceeding or her rights therein.\n       The proceedings resumed on April 8, 2009, in the presence of Barrett and\ncounsel for both parties. The district attorney‘s sole witness was Dr. Robert\nThomas, a psychologist for the Regional Center. Dr. Thomas testified that Barrett\nhad been previously diagnosed with mental retardation and that she fell within the\nmoderate range of mental retardation with an estimated IQ ―[i]n the 50‘s to 40‘s.‖\nAlthough he did not conduct a formal cognitive assessment of Barrett, Dr. Thomas\nbased his opinion of Barrett‘s mental retardation on her case file, which included\nschool documents, psychological assessments, and medical documents with results\nof cognitive tests. He also based his opinion on the fact that Barrett, though\ninitially deemed ineligible for Regional Center services, was accepted for such\nservices in 2001 upon a second review of her case. Dr. Thomas said he personally\nevaluated Barrett once, during a visit to her apartment, and said he found it ―very\ndifficult to have a normal reciprocal conversation with her.‖\n       Dr. Thomas further testified that Barrett had also been diagnosed with a\nrange of psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and\nschizoaffective disorder. He said that individuals like Barrett with a dual\ndiagnosis of mental illness and mental retardation do not always receive the\ntreatment and supervision they need at the Regional Center because the staff there\nis trained to address mental retardation, not to provide psychiatric treatment.\n       In addition, Dr. Thomas testified that Barrett was a danger to herself and\nothers based on his review of 20 to 30 incident reports dating back to 2001. He\nsaid those reports included numerous accounts of violent behavior, including\nphysical assaults on Regional Center staff, destruction of property, and self-\nmutilation. Dr. Thomas also said that ―[s]he has threatened suicide and verbalized\nsuicidal thoughts‖ based on one of the incident reports. Although Dr. Thomas\n\n                                          4\n\fcould not describe the severity of each incident based on the reports, he testified\nthat Barrett had the potential to cause serious injury to herself and to others\nbecause of her inability to control her aggression.\n       When asked whether Barrett‘s mental illness or her mental retardation was\nthe cause of her dangerous behavior, Dr. Thomas said her mental retardation\nlimited her ability ―to understand the complexity of her disorder and the need for\ntreatment.‖ But he also said that given the extent of Barrett‘s mental and\ndevelopmental disorders, ―it would be very difficult to differentiate what behavior\nis attributed to what particular disorder.‖ Dr. Thomas opined that the least\nrestrictive placement for Barrett was commitment to the secure treatment facility\nwhere she had been placed pending disposition of the section 6500 petition.\n       Barrett testified on her own behalf. She spoke about her current placement,\nstating a clear preference for placement in a group home rather than the secure\nfacility. She testified that she was taking medication that left her mind ―clearer‖\nand helped her to stay calm. The record contains no indication that her attorney or\nthe court inquired into her ability to comprehend the proceedings or the rights to\nwhich she was entitled. But Barrett made clear that she wanted to make her own\nliving and medical decisions: ―[I]f I had a choice in life I‘d have a choice to have\nmy freedom and I‘d have a choice to talk to my doctor.‖\n       Based on the testimony and reports, the trial court found that Barrett was\nmentally retarded and dangerous under section 6500, and committed her to the\ncustody of the Department for one year. The court acknowledged that ―Ms.\nBarrett presents a complex situation‖ in light of ―a series of mental health\ndiagnoses, many of which seem to be overlapping depending on various times.‖\nThe court concluded that her dangerousness is ―based upon mental retardation‖\nand ―may also have an element of being based on her mental illness.‖\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\f       The record does not show that the court directly addressed Barrett at any\npoint in the proceedings to explain any rights she might have under state or federal\nlaw, including the right to trial by jury. Among other things, Barrett contends that\nthe court‘s failure to advise her of the right to demand a jury trial violates the\nprinciple of equal protection of the laws.\n                                          II.\n       California has a panoply of statutes providing for the involuntary\ncommitment of individuals who pose a threat to themselves and others. As we\nrecently observed, ―[d]ecisions by this court and the United States Supreme Court\n. . . have used the equal protection clause to police civil commitment statutes to\nensure that a particular group of civil committees is not unfairly or arbitrarily\nsubjected to greater burdens.‖ (People v. McKee (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2591905\"><a href=\"/opinion/2591905/people-v-mckee/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1172</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1199\n[collecting cases].)\n       Most of California‘s civil commitment statutes apply to persons who have\nbeen accused or convicted of a crime. (See §§ 1800 et seq. [mentally disordered\noffenders discharged by juvenile authorities], 3000 et seq. [narcotics addicts],\n6600 et seq. [sexually violent predators]; Pen. Code, §§ 1026–1027 [defendants\nacquitted by reason of insanity]; Pen. Code, § 1367 [defendants found mentally\nincompetent]; Pen., Code § 2960 et seq. [mentally disordered offenders].) Only\ntwo involuntary commitment schemes — the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (LPS\nAct) (§ 5300 et seq.) and section 6500 — authorize the state to assert prolonged\ncustody over individuals through proceedings completely separate from the\njuvenile and criminal justice systems. Section 5300 authorizes the commitment of\ncertain mentally ill persons for 180 days upon a finding of dangerousness. Section\n6500 authorizes a renewable one-year commitment for persons found to be\nmentally retarded and dangerous. Neither statute requires the state to show or\ncharge criminal conduct.\n\n                                             6\n\f         In framing her equal protection claim, Barrett contrasts the procedures for a\n180-day commitment under the LPS Act with the procedures for a one-year\ncommitment under section 6500. The LPS Act expressly recognizes a right to a\njury trial (§§ 5302, 5303) and says ―the court shall advise the person named in the\npetition . . . of his right to demand a jury trial‖ (§ 5302). Section 6500, by\ncontrast, does not mention the right to a jury trial or contain any advisement\nrequirement.\n         Today‘s opinion confirms that an individual facing commitment under\nsection 6500 has the right to trial by jury. (Maj. opn., ante, at pp. 14–15.) The\ncourt endorses ―a long and unbroken line of California appellate court cases\nholding or assuming — largely on the basis of federal and state equal protection\nprinciples affecting fundamental interests — that persons alleged to be mentally\nretarded and dangerous cannot be denied a jury trial altogether where jury trials\nare granted by statute to persons alleged to be mentally impaired and dangerous\nunder comparable commitment laws.‖ (Id. at p. 14.) I join this holding of the\ncourt.\n         The question here is whether persons facing commitment under section\n6500 are also entitled, as a matter of equal protection, to the same advisement of\nthe right to trial by jury that is guaranteed to persons facing commitment under\nsection 5300. It is on this question that I disagree with the court‘s opinion.\n         Barrett additionally contends that section 5302‘s advisement requirement\nmeans that the decision to waive a jury trial must be made personally by the\nindividual facing commitment under the LPS Act and that this right to personal\nwaiver extends to section 6500 proceedings as a matter of equal protection. The\ncourt does not decide whether a right to personal waiver inheres in section 5302\n(maj. opn., ante, at p. 30), and I also see no need to decide that issue. Separate and\napart from a right to personal waiver, a jury trial advisement has important value\n\n                                           7\n\fto an individual facing involuntary commitment in at least two ways. First, an\nadvisement may prompt the individual to discuss jury trial concerns with counsel\nif she is able. Even if counsel can be expected to consult with the client about\nsuch concerns when counsel believes it is ―necessary or advisable‖ (maj. opn.,\nante, at p. 26), an advisement by the court may have the practical effect of\nempowering the individual, at her own initiative, to participate in the decision with\ncounsel. Second, an advisement conveys respect for the individual‘s\nunderstanding of and interest in a key issue — who will be the decision maker,\njudge or jury? — in a proceeding that may inalterably shape the trajectory of her\nlife. In short, an advisement recognizes the dignity and agency of the individual\nwho appears before the court.\n       In addressing Barrett‘s equal protection claim, I begin in part III below by\ndiscussing at some length the troubled history of our nation‘s and our state‘s\ntreatment of persons with mental disabilities. In part IV, I discuss the\nshortcomings of the court‘s analysis of Barrett‘s claim. In part V, I elucidate the\nproper standard of equal protection review and apply it to the statutory\nclassification at issue here.\n       As my analysis will make clear, the issue in this case is not whether people\nwho are mentally retarded generally have less cognitive ability than people who\nare mentally ill. Barrett‘s claim specifically concerns the ability to understand a\njury trial advisement and involves a specific comparison between two groups:\nmentally ill persons facing 180-day commitment under section 5300 and persons\nalleged to be mentally retarded under section 6500. In light of historic and\ncontinuing misperceptions concerning the ability of persons who are mentally\nretarded to understand and influence their own fate, I believe the requirement of a\njury trial advisement for persons facing commitment under section 5300, but not\n\n\n\n                                          8\n\ffor persons facing commitment under section 6500, does not survive equal\nprotection scrutiny.\n                                          III.\n       To fully appreciate the nature of a section 6500 proceeding and the context\nof Barrett‘s claim, it is helpful to begin with some history. Civil proceedings\nagainst individuals alleged to be mentally retarded and dangerous have long been\nthought necessary to protect society as well as the individual involved. But such\nproceedings also have a regrettably long history of abuse.\n                                           A.\n       This history is familiar to those trained in the law. For it was Justice\nHolmes‘s infamous opinion for the high court in Buck v. Bell (1927) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101076\"><a href=\"/opinion/101076/buck-v-bell/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\nthat upheld a Virginia statute authorizing the compulsory ―sterilization of mental\ndefectives.‖ (Id. at p. 205.) That category included Carrie Buck, whom the court\ndescribed as ―a feeble-minded white woman‖ who was ―the daughter of a feeble-\nminded mother‖ and ―the mother of an illegitimate feeble-minded child.‖ (Ibid.)\nEchoing the eugenics theories popular at the time, Justice Holmes reasoned: ―We\nhave seen more than once that the public welfare may call upon the best citizens\nfor their lives. It would be strange if it could not call upon those who already sap\nthe strength of the State for these lesser sacrifices, often not felt to be such by\nthose concerned, in order to prevent our being swamped with incompetence. It is\nbetter for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for\ncrime, or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are\nmanifestly unfit from continuing their kind. The principle that sustains\ncompulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the Fallopian tubes.\n[Citation.] Three generations of imbeciles are enough.‖ (Id. at p. 207.) With the\nhigh court‘s endorsement, Virginia officials forcibly sterilized Buck along with\n8,300 other inmates of state mental institutions between 1927 and 1974, when the\n\n                                           9\n\flaw was finally repealed. (See Lombardo, Three Generations, No Imbeciles:\nEugenics, the Supreme Court, and Buck v. Bell (2008) p. 294 (Lombardo).)\n       The high court‘s eight-to-one decision in Buck v. Bell reflected then\nprevalent attitudes toward persons with mental disabilities. Twenty-five states,\nincluding Virginia, had sterilization laws in place at the time Buck v. Bell was\ndecided, and seven others followed suit by 1937. (Lombardo, supra, at p. 294; see\nibid. [citing a 1965 study finding that more than 65,000 Americans were sterilized\nunder such laws].) It is tempting to say, from our contemporary perspective, that\nsuch laws were the product of unthinking prejudice and blatant disregard for the\nrights of the individuals affected. But to their proponents, the sterilization laws\nhad a genuinely benign purpose as an alternative to civil confinement. As the\nVirginia Supreme Court explained in Buck‘s case: ―Unless sterilized by surgical\noperation, she must be kept in the custodial care of the [State Colony for\nEpileptics and Feeble-Minded] for thirty years, until she is sterilized by nature,\nduring which time she will be a charge upon the State. If sterilized under the law,\nshe could be given her liberty and secure a good home, under supervision, without\ninjury to society. Her welfare and that of society would be promoted by such\nsterilization.‖ (Buck v. Bell (Va. 1925) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">516</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 517–518, affd.

Bell, supra, 274 U.S. at p. 206 [noting ―the very careful provisions by\nwhich the act protects the patients from possible abuse‖].) The high court\ndescribed the statute‘s protections as follows: ―The superintendent [of the State\nColony for Epileptics and Feeble-Minded] first presents a petition to the special\nboard of directors of his hospital or colony, stating the facts and the grounds for\nhis opinion, verified by affidavit. Notice of the petition and of the time and place\nof the hearing in the institution is to be served upon the inmate, and also upon his\n\n                                          10\n\fguardian, and if there is no guardian the superintendent is to apply to the Circuit\nCourt of the County to appoint one. If the inmate is a minor notice also is to be\ngiven to his parents, if any, with a copy of the petition. The board is to see to it\nthat the inmate may attend the hearings if desired by him or his guardian. The\nevidence is all to be reduced to writing, and after the board has made its order for\nor against the operation, the superintendent, or the inmate, or his guardian, may\nappeal to the Circuit Court of the County. The Circuit Court may consider the\nrecord of the board and the evidence before it and such other admissible evidence\nas may be offered, and may affirm, revise, or reverse the order of the board and\nenter such order as it deems just. Finally any party may apply to the Supreme\nCourt of Appeals, which, if it grants the appeal, is to hear the case upon the record\nof the trial in the Circuit Court and may enter such order as it thinks the Circuit\nCourt should have entered.‖ (Id. at pp. 206–207.)\n       Although the statute did not include a right to counsel, the protections it did\nafford led the high court to conclude that ―[t]here can be no doubt that so far as\nprocedure is concerned the rights of the patient are most carefully considered.‖\n(Buck v. Bell, supra, 274 U.S. at p. 207.) And yet, careful scholars of Buck‘s life\nhave come to the conclusion that neither she nor her daughter Vivian was ―feeble-\nminded‖ at all. (See Lombardo, supra, at p. 139 [citing school records showing\nBuck ―was a normal child‖]; Brunius, Better for All the World: The Secret\nHistory of Forced Sterilization and America‘s Quest for Racial Purity (2006)\npp. 76–77 [Vivian completed four semesters of school and made the honor roll\nbefore her death at age eight]; Smith & Nelson, The Sterilization of Carrie Buck\n(1989) p. 194 [reviewing letters written by Buck after her discharge from the\nColony and concluding that ―neither mother or daughter was illiterate despite\nOliver Wendell Holmes‘ comments‖].) Instead, it appears that Buck‘s real\n―deficiency‖ was that she was an unwed mother, likely as a result of rape, and this\n\n                                          11\n\fwas a point of embarrassment and shame for Buck‘s foster parents, who filed a\npetition supporting Buck‘s sterilization. (See Lombardo, supra, at pp. 139–140;\nBrunius, supra, at pp. 51–53; Smith & Nelson, supra, at p. 5.)\n       Although the doctrinal underpinnings of Buck v. Bell have been eroded (see\nSkinner v. Oklahoma (1942) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103701\"><a href=\"/opinion/103701/skinner-v-oklahoma-ex-rel-williamson/\"><span class=\"volume\">316</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">535</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">), the case remains a cautionary tale in\ntwo respects. First, although state intervention into the lives of individuals with\nmental disabilities has often been rationalized on the ground that it is for their own\ngood or the good of society, unfounded assumptions of incapacity and a legacy of\npaternalism have resulted in serious ―depriv[ations] of . . . basic liberty‖ with\n―subtle, far-reaching and devastating effects.‖ (Skinner, at p. 541.) Second, even\nwhere such intervention is not inherently unlawful, laws directed at controlling\nindividuals with mental disabilities have been prone to overbroad application\ndespite what appear to be ―very careful provisions . . . protect[ing] the patients\nfrom possible abuse‖ (Buck v. Bell, supra, 274 U.S. at p. 206).\n                                          B.\n       California was not immune to the eugenics theories underlying the Virginia\nlegislation at issue in Buck v. Bell. Indeed, by some accounts, California was a\npioneer. During the first half of the 20th century, California‘s approach to persons\nwho were mentally ill or developmentally disabled centered on institutionalizing\nsuch individuals or otherwise isolating them from the rest of society. A broad\nrange of individuals deemed ―feeble-minded‖ or mentally deficient were subject to\nsterilization. As treatments for mental illness advanced, California made efforts to\ndifferentiate mental conditions viewed as treatable from those viewed as\nhereditary or immutable. Over time, isolation and warehousing gradually gave\nway to treatment and habilitation. In the 1960s, the Legislature enacted\nsubstantive and procedural limits on the state‘s authority to commit individuals\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\fwith mental illness. Protections for persons with mental retardation followed the\nsame general trajectory but lagged behind those afforded to the mentally ill.\n       In 1909, California became the third state in the nation to pass a\nsterilization bill. (Stats. 1909, ch. 720, § 1, pp. 1093–1094; see Stern, Eugenic\nNation: Faults and Frontiers of Better Breeding in Modern America (2005) p. 99.)\nCalifornia‘s law was ―perhaps the most expansive legislation of all state acts\npermitting sterilization.‖ (Lombardo, supra, at p. 26.) It allowed ―any inmate‖ of\nany state hospital, the California Home for the Care and Training of Feeble-\nMinded Children, or any state prison to be ―asexualized‖ whenever a panel of\nmedical officials determined ―it would be beneficial and conducive to the benefit\nof the physical, mental or moral condition‖ of that individual. (Stats. 1909,\nch. 720, § 1, p. 1093.) Although the law applied only to prisoners who had been\nimprisoned ―at least two times for some sexual offense, or at least three times for\nany other crime‖ (id. at p. 1094), it placed no substantive limits on the sterilization\nof persons deemed ―feeble-minded.‖\n       The 1909 act was repealed in 1913 and replaced with legislation applying\nto three discrete groups. Before release or discharge, inmates of state hospitals for\nthe insane ―afflicted with hereditary insanity or incurable chronic mania or\ndementia‖ could be sterilized with or without their consent at the discretion of ―the\nstate commission in lunacy . . . after a careful investigation of all the\ncircumstances of the case.‖ (Stats. 1913, ch. 363, § 1, pp. 775–776.) Recidivists\ncommitted to state prison for sexual crimes could also sterilized whenever the\nresident physician determined it would be ―to the benefit of the physical, mental or\nmoral condition‖ of the inmate. (Id., § 2, p. 776.) Finally, any ―idiot or fool‖\ncould be sterilized by the superintendent of any state hospital with the written\nconsent of a parent or appointed guardian. (Id., § 3, p. 776.) Upon written request\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\fof the parent or guardian, the operation was to be performed ―without charge.‖\n(Ibid.)\n          The 1913 law was repealed four years later and replaced with two separate\nstatutes. The first statute, enacted in May 1917, expanded the state‘s authority to\nsterilize inmates of mental hospitals before their release if they were found to be\nafflicted with hereditary mental disease, ―the various grades of feeble\nmindedness,‖ or ―perversion or marked departures from normal mentality or . . .\ndisease of a syphilitic nature.‖ (Stats. 1917, ch. 489, § 1, p. 571.) The second\nstatute, enacted in June 1917, established ―an institution to be known as the Pacific\ncolony‖ devoted to ―the care, confinement and instruction of feeble-minded and\nepileptic persons.‖ (Stats. 1917, ch. 776, § 1, p. 1623 & preamble.) The statute\ndefined ― ‗feeble-minded‘ ‖ to include persons who were ―not insane‖ but ―so\nmentally deficient that they are incapable of managing themselves and their affairs\nindependently, with ordinary prudence, or of being taught to do so, and who\nrequire supervision, control, and care, for their own welfare, or for the welfare of\nothers, or for the welfare of the community.‖ (Id., § 16, p. 1626.) The June 1917\nstatute marked the first effort by the Legislature to differentiate between persons\nclassified as ―insane‖ (mentally ill) and those classified as ―feeble-minded‖\n(mentally retarded) in the context of civil commitment.\n          The June 1917 statute created a procedure for involuntary commitment that\nlater became section 6500. ―[A]ny parent, guardian or other person charged with\nthe support of a supposedly feeble-minded person‖ could petition the court for\nadmission of the individual to the Pacific colony. (Stats. 1917, ch. 776, § 17,\np. 1626.) The petitioner had to submit a verified affidavit ―disclos[ing] his reasons\nfor supposing such person to be eligible for admission.‖ (Ibid.) Peace officers\ncould also petition for commitment, but they were required to provide written\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\fnotice of the petition to the ―parent, guardian or other person charged with such\nsupport‖ of the proposed committee, if known. (Ibid.)\n       If a person was found to be ―feeble-minded,‖ the judge could order the\nperson committed indefinitely to the Pacific colony, so long as the person had\nbeen a resident of California for at least a year. (Stats. 1917, ch. 776, § 19,\npp. 1626–1627.) The only provision for discharge or release was at the discretion\nof the institution‘s board of trustees. (Id., § 41, p. 1631.) Before discharge, the\nboard of trustees could order sterilization ―with or without the consent of the\ninmate‖ upon a recommendation of the superintendent based on ―careful\ninvestigation of all the circumstances.‖ (Id., § 42, p. 1631.) The statute declared\nthat such sterilization ―shall be lawful‖ and deemed the trustees and ―any person\nparticipating in the operation‖ immune from civil or criminal liability. (Ibid.) In\n1937, the Legislature added a provision requiring the court in a commitment\nproceeding to give ―due notice of the hearing of the petition‖ to the ―alleged\nincompetent.‖ (Stats. 1937, ch. 369, pp. 1005, 1137.)\n       During the 1950s, improved medical treatments and increased public\nawareness of the ―scandalous conditions in state mental institutions‖ gave rise to a\ndeinstitutionalization movement. (Levy & Rubenstein, The Rights of People with\nMental Disabilities (1996) p. 19 [citing Deutsch, The Shame of the States\n(1948)].) From midcentury through the 1970s, California took a series of\nimportant if halting steps that would, at one point, establish our state as a leader in\nprotecting the civil rights of persons with mental disabilities. As explained below,\nreforms applicable to persons with mental illness focused on procedural rights that\ngave such individuals the opportunity to participate in and make decisions about\ntheir care to the extent possible. By contrast, reforms applicable to persons with\nmental retardation began with substantive limits on the state‘s authority to order\n\n\n\n                                          15\n\finvoluntary commitment. Although procedural protections followed, they\ngenerally lagged behind the protections afforded to persons with mental illness.\n       The first step toward reform came in 1951, when California enacted a new\nsterilization scheme for all persons with mental disabilities under the jurisdiction\nof the Department of Mental Hygiene. (Stats. 1951, ch. 552, § 1, pp. 1706–1707.)\nFor the first time, the Legislature required written notice to the patient and his or\nher guardians of any proposed sterilization and created a procedure for individuals\nto object and seek judicial review. (Ibid.) If the patient or a family member filed\na written objection within 30 days, the department director was required to ―make\nfull inquiry into the case, and may hold a hearing.‖ (Id., p. 1707.) If the director\ndecided that the patient should be sterilized despite the patient‘s or the family‘s\nobjection, the director had to provide written notice of the decision and the right to\npetition the superior court for review. Whether due to this law or to other factors,\nthe use of sterilization in California dropped significantly. After sterilizing over\n19,000 individuals between 1909 and 1949, the state performed only 981\nprocedures between 1949 and 1959. (Lombardo, supra, at pp. 241–242.)\n       In 1965, the commitment scheme for ―feeble-minded‖ persons was\nrecodified, and the term ―feeble-minded‖ was replaced with ―mentally deficient\npersons.‖ (Stats. 1965, ch. 391, § 4, pp. 1630, 1668 [former § 5590].) Individuals\nwho were adjudged ―mentally deficient‖ and who had resided in the state for at\nleast one year could be ordered committed to the Department of Mental Hygiene\nfor placement in the Sonoma State Home or the Pacific colony. (Id., p. 1670.)\nIndividuals who had been in the state for less than one year could also be\ncommitted to the department ―for the purpose of transportation of such person to\nthe state of his legal residence.‖ (Ibid.)\n       In 1967, California enacted the LPS Act in order ―[t]o end the\ninappropriate, indefinite, and involuntary commitment of mentally disordered\n\n                                             16\n\fpersons and persons impaired by chronic alcoholism, and to eliminate legal\ndisabilities.‖ (Stats. 1967, ch. 1667, § 36, pp. 4053, 4704 [former § 5001, subd.\n(a)].) The LPS Act created a tiered scheme for involuntary commitment of\nindividuals with mental illness. Upon ―reasonable cause,‖ peace officers or other\ndesignated professionals could place an individual believed to be dangerous or\ngravely disabled into custody for 72-hour treatment and evaluation. (Id.,\npp. 4077–4078 [former § 5150].) Staff at the facility could then certify the\nindividual for an additional 14-day involuntary intensive treatment (id., pp. 4085–\n4088 [former § 5250]), subject to judicial review (id., pp. 4088–4089 [former\n§ 5275 et seq.]). After 14 days, an individual could be committed for an additional\n90 days only after a hearing to determine whether the individual presented ―an\nimminent threat of substantial physical harm to others.‖ (Id., pp. 4089–4091\n[former § 5300].) The statute required the court to appoint counsel to represent\nthe person in that hearing, and the statute required counsel to advise the proposed\ncommittee of his or her rights. (Id., p. 4090 [former § 5302].) Alternatively, an\nindividual found to be ―gravely disabled‖ could be committed through a one-year\nconservatorship. (Id., pp. 4093–4098.) Before such commitment, the individual\nhad a right to demand a jury trial. (Id., p. 4094 [former § 5350, subd. (d)].)\n       Many of the LPS Act‘s procedures for commitment of mentally ill persons\nremain in place today (see post, at p. 21), although the 90-day commitment has\nbeen extended to 180 days (see § 5300 [current]). By all accounts, the LPS Act\nwas a genuine step forward in protecting the rights of such individuals facing civil\ncommitment. ―The LPS Act has been called a ‗Magna Carta for the Mentally Ill‘\nthat ‗established the most progressive . . . commitment procedures in the\ncountry.‘ ‖ (In re Qawi (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2623388\"><a href=\"/opinion/2623388/in-re-qawi/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17 [quoting Assem. Subcom. on\nMental Health Services, Dilemma of Mental Commitments in California (1978)\nforeword by Assemblyman Louis Papan].)\n\n                                         17\n\f       In contrast to the commitment procedures for persons with mental illness,\nthe LPS Act simply recodified the existing commitment scheme for ―mentally\ndeficient persons,‖ moving the statute to section 6500 of the Welfare and\nInstitutions Code and replacing the phrase ―mentally deficient persons‖ with\n― ‗mentally retarded persons.‘ ‖ (Stats. 1967, ch. 1667, § 37, pp. 4107, 4134–\n4137.) Whereas the prior version of the statute applied to ―[a]ny mentally\ndeficient person,‖ the statute now provided: ―Any mentally retarded person\nrequiring hospitalization may be committed to the Department of Mental Hygiene\n. . . .‖ (Id., p. 4134 [former § 6501].) The LPS Act did not explain what\nconditions might ―requir[e] hospitalization‖; it simply provided that the court\ncould order a hospitalization commitment simply upon a finding that the person\nwas ―mentally retarded.‖ (Id., p. 4136.) The LPS Act did not give individuals\nfacing commitment under section 6500 a right to counsel.\n       As enacted in 1967, the LPS Act also recodified the sterilization procedures\nestablished in 1951, authorizing the sterilization of individuals with hereditary\nmental disease, mental retardation, and other ―[m]arked departures from normal\nmentality.‖ (Stats. 1967, ch. 1667, § 40, pp. 4146, 4155 [former § 7254].) The\nsterilization law was not repealed until 1979. (Stats. 1979, ch. 552, § 1, p. 1762.)\n       In 1970, the Legislature enacted section former 6500.1, establishing the\nfirst substantive limit on the state‘s authority to involuntarily commit individuals\nwith developmental disabilities. The act provided: ―On and after July 1, 1971, no\nmentally retarded person may be committed to the Department of Mental Hygiene\npursuant to this article, unless he is a danger to himself or others.‖ (Stats. 1970,\nch. 351, § 3, p. 765.)\n       Even as the 1970 act imposed a requirement of dangerousness as a\nsubstantive limit on the involuntary commitment of persons with mental\nretardation, a second bill passed later that year established an additional\n\n                                          18\n\fprocedural protection for persons with mental illness. In addition to providing the\nright to counsel, the Legislature beginning in 1970 required trial courts to advise\nmentally ill persons facing prolonged commitment of their right to demand a jury\ntrial. (Stats. 1970, ch. 1627, § 17, p. 3443.) This advisement requirement, now\ncodified at section 5302, is the basis of Barrett‘s equal protection claim.\n       It was not until 1975 that the Legislature provided the right to counsel in\nsection 6500 proceedings. (Stats. 1975, ch. 694, § 27, p. 1651.) The 1975 act also\nimposed a substantive time limit on commitment, providing that any order for\ncommitment would automatically expire after one year. (Ibid.) Any party\nauthorized to submit an original petition for commitment could file subsequent\npetitions for additional one-year periods of commitment, and each subsequent\npetition would follow the same procedures applicable to the original petition.\n(Ibid.) These provisions remain in place today. (See § 6500.)\n       Ten years after the LPS Act was passed, the Legislature in 1977 extended\nthe LPS Act‘s goal of ending ―inappropriate, indefinite, and involuntary\ncommitment‖ to individuals with developmental disabilities, a term defined to\ninclude mental retardation. (Stats. 1977, ch. 1167, § 1, p. 3824 [former § 5001].)\nAt the same time, the Legislature enacted the Lanterman Developmental\nDisabilities Services Act (Lanterman Act). (Stats. 1977, ch. 1252, § 550, p. 4521.)\nThe Lanterman Act expanded community-based treatment and habilitation\nservices for persons with a wide range of developmental disabilities, and it\ndeclared that ―[p]ersons with developmental disabilities have the same legal rights\nand responsibilities guaranteed all other individuals,‖ including ―[a] right to\ndignity‖ (id., pp. 4521–4522, p. 4712, codified at § 4502, subd. (b)) and, as\nprovided by a 1992 amendment, a right ―to make choices in their own lives‖\n(Stats. 1992, ch. 1011, § 3, codified at § 4502, subd. (j)). However, the Lanterman\n\n\n\n                                          19\n\fAct did not extend the LPS Act‘s full panoply of procedural and substantive\nprotections to persons facing commitment under section 6500.\n       Since 1977, a number of amendments have been made to the section 6500\nscheme. (See Stats. 1977, ch. 695, § 7, pp. 2248–2249 [providing a nonexclusive\ndefinition of ―dangerousness‖ to include incompetence to stand trial for specific\nprovisions of the Penal Code]; Stats. 1978, ch. 1319, § 1, p. 4316 [repealing\ndefinition of ―mentally retarded‖]; Stats. 1978, ch. 429, § 220, pp. 1462–1463\n[amending list of Penal Code sections related to definition of ―dangerousness‖];\nStats. 1989, ch. 897, § 47, pp. 3079–3080 [same]; Stats. 1993, ch. 610, § 33,\npp. 3433–3435 [same]; Stats. 1994, ch. 224, § 10, pp. 1791–1792 [same]; Stats.\n1996, ch. 1075, § 20, pp. 7237–7238 [same]; Assem. Bill No. 1472, approved by\nGovernor, June 27, 2012 (2011–2012 Reg. Sess.) [replacing the term ―mental\nretardation‖ and similar terms with ―developmental disability‖ and enacting\nsubstantive changes to the term of commitment].) But the basic procedures for\ninvoluntary commitment under section 6500 have remained unchanged since the\nmid-1970s. For the sake of consistency with today‘s majority opinion, I will cite\nand quote from the section 6500 scheme as it existed at the time of Barrett‘s\ncommitment proceedings. (Maj. opn., ante, at pp. 1–2, fn. 2.)\n                                          IV.\n       With this historical context, I now turn to Barrett‘s equal protection claim,\nbeginning with an examination of today‘s opinion.\n                                           A.\n       In rejecting Barrett‘s claim, the court says ―the critical factor is the distinct\n‗mentality‘ (§ 6507) covered by the two schemes.‖ (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 30.)\nThe court observes that mental disorders ―may arise suddenly and, for the first\ntime, in adulthood‖; that ―[t]he LPS Act process itself assumes that the need for\ntreatment may be temporary, and that disabling mental disorders may be\n\n                                           20\n\fintermittent or short-lived‖; and that ― ‗ ―mental illness ‗often strikes only limited\nareas of functioning, leaving other areas unimpaired, and consequently . . . many\nmentally ill persons retain the capacity to function in a competent\nmanner.‘ ‖ ‘ [Citation.]‖ (Id. at p. 31.) ―These characteristics suggest that the\nmental conditions that create eligibility for an extended 180-day LPS Act\ncommitment, though they include imminent dangerousness, do not necessarily\nimply incompetence or a reduced ability to understand, and make decisions about,\nthe conduct of the proceedings. Hence, nothing compels the conclusion that such\nLPS Act patients will not benefit by the statutory right to a jury trial advisement\nset forth in section 5302. By contrast, in the case of persons alleged to be mentally\nretarded and dangerous under section 6500, the commitment process itself raises\nsubstantial doubts about their cognitive and intellectual functioning sufficient to\nlimit the personal and procedural role they play. It follows that the two groups are\nnot similarly situated as to the function that Barrett implies an advisement like\nsection 5302 serves — comprehending and controlling the decision whether to\nrequest a jury trial. Thus, any disparate statutory treatment with respect to jury\ntrial advisements does not deprive persons like Barrett of equal protection of the\nlaw.‖ (Id. at pp. 31–32.)\n       I do not disagree that there are real differences between persons facing\ncommitment under section 5300 and persons facing commitment under section\n6500. But those differences, properly understood, do not support a categorical\ndistinction between the two groups with respect to a jury right advisement.\n       As an initial matter, even if mental disorders are often temporary,\nintermittent, or treatable with medication, it is not the case that all persons subject\nto a 180-day commitment under the LPS Act are capable, at the time of the\nproceeding, of comprehending a section 5302 advisement. Indeed, under the\ngraduated scheme of increasingly lengthy commitment set forth by the LPS Act\n\n                                          21\n\f(see §§ 5150 [initial 72-hour ―treatment and evaluation‖], 5250 [14-day\ncommitment for ―intensive treatment‖], 5270.15 [30-day commitment for\nadditional ―intensive treatment‖]), one can logically infer that many individuals\nfacing a 180-day commitment under section 5302 have mental disorders that are\nnot temporary, intermittent, or susceptible to effective treatment. The most the\ncourt can say about ―the mental conditions that create eligibility for an extended\n180-day LPS Act commitment‖ is that they ―do not necessarily imply\nincompetence or a reduced ability to understand . . . the conduct of the\nproceedings.‖ (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 31, italics added.) The implication is that at\nleast some (and probably many) potential committees under section 5300 will\nhave mental conditions that preclude comprehension of the proceedings. Those\nindividuals ―will not benefit by the statutory right to a jury trial advisement‖ (maj.\nopn., ante, at p. 31), but the trial court is required to give the advisement anyway.\n(§ 5302.)\n       Just as there are individuals facing commitment under section 5300 who\ncannot understand a jury right advisement, there are individuals facing\ncommitment under section 6500 who can. Why else would section 6500 say that\n―[i]n any proceedings conducted under the authority of this article, the alleged\nmentally retarded person shall be informed of his or her right to counsel by the\ncourt . . . ‖? And why else would section 6504 say that ―[i]n all cases the court\nshall require due notice of the hearing of the petition to be given to the alleged\nmentally retarded person‖? These provisions do not imply that all potential\nsection 6500 committees can understand an advisement. But they appear to be\npremised on the notion that a subset of potential committees can, for ―[t]he law\nneither does nor requires idle acts.‖ (Civ. Code, § 3532.) That is not to say that a\njury trial advisement is required whenever a civil commitment statute requires\nnotice of the right to counsel. It is to say that the rationale for denying a jury trial\n\n                                           22\n\fadvisement in section 6500 proceedings cannot be that persons subject to such\nproceedings are categorically incapable of comprehending the advisement.\n       As the United States Supreme Court has observed, persons who are\nclassified as mentally retarded comprise a ―large and diversified group,‖ ranging\n―from those whose disability is not immediately evident to those who must be\nconstantly cared for.‖ (Cleburne, supra, 473 U.S. at p. 442; see Wald, Principal\nPaper in The Mentally Retarded Citizen and the Law (The President‘s Committee\non Mental Retardation, 1976) p. 5 [―Retarded people, like all people, vary\nenormously in talent, aptitude, personality, achievement, and temperament. . . .\nEach person‘s capacities must be judged individually before he can be denied\nrights of citizenship or humanity.‖].) ―The American Association on Mental\nDeficiency (AAMD) has defined mental retardation as ‗ ―significantly subaverage\ngeneral intellectual functioning existing concurrently with deficits in adaptive\nbehavior and manifested during the developmental period.‖ ‘ ‖ (Cleburne, supra,\n473 U.S. at p. 443, fn. 9.) With respect to intellectual functioning, persons\ndiagnosed as mentally retarded typically have an IQ of 70 to 75 or below. (Amer.\nAssn. on Mental Retardation, Mental Retardation: Definition, Classification, and\nSystems of Supports (10th ed. 2002) pp. 57–58 (AAMR).) But among such\nindividuals, there are significant differences in cognitive abilities.\n       The AAMR guidelines specify four different degrees of mental retardation,\nfrom mild to profound. According to that classification system, an adult with an\nIQ between 50 and 70 is deemed to have ―mild‖ mental retardation. (AAMR,\nsupra, at p. 104; see also Cleburne, supra, 473 U.S. at p. 442, fn. 9.) A mildly\nmentally retarded person is ―[l]ikely to [have] some learning difficulties in\nschool,‖ but ―[m]any adults will be able to work and maintain good social\nrelationships and contribute to society.‖ (AAMR, at p. 104.) Mild mental\nretardation in adults is equivalent to a ―mental age from 9 to under 12 years.‖\n\n                                           23\n\f(Ibid.) As to what such a ―mental age‖ might mean, I note that California‘s\nhistory and social studies curriculum expects fifth-graders to be able to learn,\namong other things, ―the significance of the new Constitution of 1787, including\nthe struggles over its ratification and the reasons for the addition of the Bill of\nRights.‖ (Cal. Department of Education, History-Social Science Framework for\nCalifornia Public Schools Kindergarten Through Grade Twelve (2005) p. 73.)\nMany fifth-graders are no doubt capable of understanding the importance of trial\nby jury.\n       The vast majority of persons who are mentally retarded are classified as\nmildly retarded (see Cleburne, supra, 473 U.S. at p. 442, fn. 9), although it is\nunclear what proportion of individuals facing commitment under section 6500 are\nmildly retarded. But it must be remembered that the class of individuals denied\nthe right to advisement by section 6500 is not limited to individuals who are, in\nfact, mentally retarded. Rather, it is comprised of persons alleged to be mentally\nretarded. The statutory scheme does not presume that an individual subject to a\nsection 6500 proceeding is mentally retarded. Instead, it repeatedly refers to an\n―alleged mentally retarded person‖ (§§ 6500, 6504, 6504.5, 6505, 6506, 6507,\nitalics added), and the section 6500 proceeding is designed to determine whether a\nperson is mentally retarded and dangerous. Assuming that some potential\ncommittees are found not to be mentally retarded, the range of cognitive abilities\namong persons subject to section 6500 proceedings is even broader than the range\nof such abilities among persons found to be mentally retarded.\n       In discussing Barrett‘s due process claim, the court cites several of our\ncases for the proposition that persons who are mentally impaired are unable to act\nin their own best interests and concludes that ―[s]imilar logic applies here.‖ (Maj.\nopn., ante, at p. 23.) But none of those cases supports the categorical denial of a\njury trial advisement to persons alleged to be mentally retarded under section\n\n                                          24\n\f6500.

Finally, it is true that In re Hop (1981) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1240715\"><a href=\"/opinion/1240715/in-re-hop/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 90–91 recognized\nthat a ―developmentally disabled adult too incompetent to admit herself to a\nmental hospital was not competent to protest or consent to hospitalization by third\nparties under the [Lanterman Act].‖ (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 23.) But the court\nnevertheless held that such developmentally disabled individuals are, as a matter\nof equal protection, ―entitled to the same congeries of rights‖ made available to\n―proposed conservatees under the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act.‖ (In re Hop, at\np. 93.)\n                                           B.\n          Today‘s opinion says that ―the commitment process itself raises substantial\ndoubts about [potential committees‘] cognitive and intellectual functioning\nsufficient to limit the personal and procedural role they play.‖ (Maj. opn., ante, at\npp. 31-32, italics added; see id. at p. 3 [―The section 6500 procedure itself\nundermines Barrett‘s assumption that persons alleged to be mentally retarded and\ndangerous can necessarily decide for themselves, in a knowing and intelligent\nmanner, whether to demand a jury at their commitment trials.‖].) According to the\n\n                                           25\n\fcourt, the section 6500 process begins when ―a responsible and interested party‖\nrequests the filing of a section 6500 petition. (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 25.) The\nrequesting party presents ―strong evidence‖ (id. at p. 3) and ―specific information‖\n(id. at p. 25), verified by affidavit, that the individual is mentally retarded. After\nthe petition is filed, the trial court receives a ―professional pretrial evaluation‖ of\nthe individual and ―informed recommendations on treatment and placement‖ from\nthe regional center. (Id. at p. 25.) This account of the process leads the court to\nconclude that ―someone like Barrett, who is alleged to be mentally retarded and\ndangerous under section 6500, is not in a position . . . to sufficiently comprehend\nthe jury trial advisement . . . .‖ (Id. at pp. 25–26.)\n       According to the court, the process that sets in motion a section 6500\nproceeding effectively identifies persons who are in fact, or should be presumed to\nbe, not only mentally retarded but so much so that they cannot understand a jury\ntrial advisement. But, as previously noted (ante, at p. 22), such a conclusion\ndefies the essential premise underlying other advisements that a court must give in\na section 6500 proceeding. Moreover, in describing the commitment process, the\ncourt applies its own gloss instead of focusing on what the statute actually says.\n       Section 6502 requires that a request for the filing of a section 6500 petition\n―shall state the petitioner‘s reasons for supposing the person to be eligible for\n[commitment], and shall be verified by affidavit‖ — nothing more. The statute\ncontains no requirement that the reasons be ―strong‖ (maj. opn., ante, at p. 3) or\n―specific‖ (id. at p. 25), nor does it otherwise specify what quantum of evidence is\nnecessary to trigger the filing of a section 6500 petition. Further, the court\ndescribes the persons authorized to request a petition (a parent, guardian,\nconservator, probation officer, corrections official, or regional center director,\namong others) as ―responsible and interested‖ parties. (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 25.)\nThis may be true in most cases, but the statute plainly contemplates exceptions.\n\n                                           26\n\f(See §§ 6510 [―In case of the dismissal of the petition, the court may, if it\nconsiders the petition to have been filed with malicious intent, order the petitioner\nto pay the expenses in connection therewith . . . .‖], 6511 [―Any person who\nknowingly contrives to have any person adjudged to be mentally retarded under\nthe provisions of this article, unlawfully or improperly, is guilty of a\nmisdemeanor.‖].) Even apart from circumstances as fraught as Carrie Buck‘s, it is\nnot hard to imagine scenarios in which the physical, emotional, or financial costs\nof caring for a ―difficult‖ adult child or ward may result in a section 6500\ncommitment proceeding that is neither necessary nor appropriate for that\nindividual. (See Heller v. Doe (1993) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112896\"><a href=\"/opinion/112896/heller-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 347 (dis. opn. of Souter, J.)\n[parents, guardians, and close family members may have interests adverse to an\nallegedly retarded person facing commitment] (Heller).) And even when the\nrequest and petition process does identify a person who is mentally retarded, it\ncannot be assumed that the person cannot comprehend a jury trial advisement.\n(Ante, at pp. 22-24.)\n       Furthermore, it is true that section 6504.5 requires the regional center to\nprovide a professional evaluation and informed recommendations to aid the trial\ncourt. But the regional center‘s report has no bearing whatsoever on who is made\nsubject to a section 6500 petition. That is because the trial court requests and\nreceives the report after the petition has already been filed. (§ 6504.5 [―Wherever\na petition is filed pursuant to this article, the court shall appoint the director of a\nregional center . . . , or the designee of the director, to examine the alleged\nmentally retarded person. [¶] Within 15 judicial days after his or her\nappointment, the regional center director or designee shall submit to the court in\nwriting a report . . . .‖].) The report does not help to establish at the time the\npetition is filed that the person alleged to be mentally retarded and dangerous is in\n\n\n\n                                           27\n\ffact a person who is ―not in a position . . . to sufficiently comprehend the jury trial\nadvisement‖ (maj. opn., ante, at p. 26).\n       In addition, although regional centers undoubtedly provide valuable\nservices to needy clients and helpful expertise to our trial courts, we have\nacknowledged that budgetary considerations place a ―subtle strain . . . on the\ncenter‘s impartial neutrality and detachment.‖ (In re Hop, supra, 29 Cal.3d at\np. 92.) The court in In re Hop unanimously observed that regional centers face\n―subtle pressure favoring hospital treatment as opposed to community placement\nof the ward. Local community placement may be difficult to locate and also\nexpensive, and its cost may be borne locally by a regional center‘s budget.\nHospital placements are funded from statewide sources.‖ (Ibid.) This concern\nprovides an additional reason to reject the court‘s unqualified confidence that a\nperson subject to a section 6500 proceeding is a person who is so cognitively\nimpaired that he or she cannot understand a jury trial advisement.\n       In sum, the distinction between persons facing commitment under section\n5300 and persons facing commitment under section 6500 is not a distinction\nbetween who can understand a jury trial advisement and who cannot. There are\nmany individuals facing commitment under section 5300 who cannot understand\nsuch an advisement, and there are many individuals facing commitment under\nsection 6500 who can. If there is a rational basis for requiring an advisement for\none group but not the other, it cannot rest on a categorical description of the\ncapabilities of one or both groups.\n                                           V.\n       A different response to Barrett‘s equal protection claim is that the\nLegislature could have differentiated between section 5300 and section 6500\nproceedings on the basis of generalizations rather than categorical claims about\nthe two groups facing commitment. The Legislature could have assumed that\n\n                                           28\n\fmost potential section 5300 committees can understand a jury trial advisement,\nwhereas most potential section 6500 committees cannot. Or the Legislature could\nhave speculated that the share of individuals capable of understanding an\nadvisement is simply greater among persons facing commitment under section\n5300 than among persons facing commitment under section 6500. In essence, this\nis a rationale based on administrative burdens. Although not every person facing\ncommitment under section 6500 is incapable of understanding an advisement, the\nLegislature could have assumed that the share of persons under section 6500 with\nthat ability, compared to the share of such persons under section 5300, is not large\nenough to justify burdening the trial courts with giving an advisement in every\ncase.\n        Further, the court posits an additional rationale for the legislative scheme:\n―Nothing compels the state ‗to choose between attacking every aspect of a\nproblem or not attacking the problem at all.‘ [Citation.] Far from having to ‗solve\nall related ills at once‘ [citation], the Legislature has ‗broad discretion‘ to proceed\nin an incremental and uneven manner without necessarily engaging in arbitrary\nand unlawful discrimination. [Citations.]‖ (Maj. opn., ante, at pp. 32–33.) The\nargument is that the Legislature may proceed ―one step at a time.‖ (Williamson v.\nLee Optical Co. (1955) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105285\"><a href=\"/opinion/105285/williamson-v-lee-optical-of-okla-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 489 (Lee Optical).)\n        In considering the ―administrative burden‖ and ―one step at a time‖\nrationales, I begin by observing that these two justifications for legislative\nclassification are hallmarks of conventional rational basis review, a highly\ndeferential standard of equal protection review paradigmatically applicable to\nsocial and economic legislation. (E.g., FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc.\n(1993) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112870\"><a href=\"/opinion/112870/fcc-v-beach-communications-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 314–320 [applying ―regulatory-efficiency‖ rationale to\nuphold statutory definition of ―cable system‖] (Beach Communications); Lee\nOptical, supra, 348 U.S. at p. 489 [applying ―one step at a time‖ rationale to\n\n                                          29\n\fuphold statute that prohibited opticians, but not sellers of ready-to-wear glasses,\nfrom fitting or duplicating lenses without a prescription from an optometrist or\nophthalmologist]; American Bank & Trust Co. v.

The ―irrelevan[ce]‖ of ―whether the conceived reason\nfor the challenged distinction actually motivated the legislature‖ is also\ncharacteristic of conventional rational basis review. (Beach Communications, at\np. 315.) The inquiry examines what the Legislature could have believed because\nthe statutory classification must be upheld ―if there is any reasonably conceivable\nstate of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.‖ (Id. at\np. 313.) The Legislature need not actually articulate its rationale, and ―a\nlegislative choice . . . may be based on rational speculation unsupported by\nevidence or empirical data.‖ (Id. at p. 315.)\n       If conventional rational basis review were applicable here, I would have no\ndifficulty upholding the distinction between section 5300 and section 6500\nproceedings in terms of jury trial advisement, because either the ―administrative\nburden‖ or the ―one step at a time‖ rationale is within the realm of rational\nlegislative speculation. The question, however, is whether conventional rational\nbasis review is the appropriate standard here. We are not dealing in this case with\na legislative classification that distinguishes among cable operators, eye care\nspecialists, or medical malpractice victims. The statutory schemes at issue here\ndraw a distinction between mentally disordered and allegedly mentally retarded\npersons subject to involuntary commitment, ensuring for one while denying to the\nother an advisement of the right to trial by jury. As I explain below, conventional\nrational basis review is not the proper standard in this context.\n\n\n\n                                           30\n\f                                           A.\n       In Cleburne, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111507\"><a href=\"/opinion/111507/cleburne-v-cleburne-living-center-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the United States Supreme Court\nconsidered an equal protection challenge to a city ordinance that required a special\npermit for locating a group home for mentally retarded persons in a residential\nneighborhood.

Observing that there are ―real and undeniable differences between the\nretarded and others‖ (id. at p. 444) and that many federal and state policies\nspecifically seek to benefit and address the needs of mentally retarded persons (id.\nat pp. 443–445 [discussing various education, habilitation, and antidiscrimination\nstatutes]), the court expressed concern that ―merely requiring the legislature to\njustify its efforts‖ in the terms required by heightened scrutiny ―may lead it to\nrefrain from acting at all‖ (id. at p. 444). For this reason, among others, the court\n―refus[ed] to recognize the retarded as a quasi-suspect class‖ and instead held that\n―legislation that distinguishes between the mentally retarded and others must be\nrationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose.‖ (Id. at p. 446.) ―This\nstandard, we believe, affords government the latitude necessary both to pursue\npolicies designed to assist the retarded in realizing their full potential, and to freely\nand efficiently engage in activities that burden the retarded in what is essentially\nan incidental manner.‖ (Ibid.)\n       In applying this standard of review, the high court observed that the city\nordinance required a special permit for a group home for the mentally retarded but\nnot for many other uses, including apartment houses, multiple dwellings, boarding\nhouses, fraternity or sorority houses, dormitories, apartment hotels, hospitals,\nsanitariums, nursing homes, and private clubs. (Cleburne, supra, 473 U.S. at\np. 447.) The court then proceeded to consider several possible justifications for\nthis differential treatment. First, it noted that the Cleburne city council ―was\n\n                                           31\n\fconcerned with the negative attitude of the majority of property owners . . . , as\nwell as with the fears of elderly residents of the neighborhood.‖ (Id. at p. 448.)\nThe court rejected this rationale on the ground that ―mere negative attitudes, or\nfear, unsubstantiated by factors which are properly cognizable in a zoning\nproceeding, are not permissible bases for treating a home for the mentally retarded\ndifferently from apartment houses, multiple dwellings, and the like.‖ (Ibid.,\nquoting Palmore v. Sidoti (1984) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111160\"><a href=\"/opinion/111160/palmore-v-sidoti/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">429</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 433 [―Private biases may be\noutside the reach of the law, but the law cannot, directly or indirectly, give them\neffect.‖].)\n       Second, the city council was concerned that students at a nearby middle\nschool ―might harass the occupants‖ of the group home. (Cleburne, supra, 473\nU.S. at p. 449.) The court said that ―denying a permit based on such vague,\nundifferentiated fears is again permitting some portion of the community to\nvalidate what would otherwise be an equal protection violation.‖ (Ibid.) Third, in\nresponse to the city council‘s concern that the group home would be located on a\nflood plain, the court said the possibility of a flood did not justify treating a group\nhome for the mentally retarded differently from nursing homes, sanitariums, or\nhospitals. (Ibid.) The court was similarly unpersuaded by the city council‘s\n―doubts about the legal responsibility for actions which the mentally retarded\nmight take,‖ finding it ―difficult to believe‖ that the group home ―would present\nany different or special hazard‖ than boarding or fraternity houses. (Ibid.)\n       Fourth, ―the Council was concerned with the size of the home and the\nnumber of people that would occupy it.‖ (Cleburne, supra, 473 U.S. at p. 449.)\nThe court again reasoned that it ―is not at all apparent‖ why a group home for the\nmentally retarded ―warrants a density regulation that others need not observe.‖\n(Id. at p. 450.) ―At least this record does not clarify how . . . the characteristics of\nthe intended occupants of the [group] home rationally justify denying to those\n\n                                           32\n\foccupants what would be permitted to groups occupying the same site for different\npurposes.‖ (Ibid.) Finally, the city expressed concern about ―avoiding\nconcentration of population and . . . lessening congestion of the streets‖ as well as\n―fire hazards, the serenity of the neighborhood, and the avoidance of danger to\nother residents.‖ (Ibid.) But the court said: ―These concerns obviously fail to\nexplain why apartment houses, fraternity and sorority houses, hospitals and the\nlike, may freely locate in the area without a permit.‖ (Ibid.)\n       The high court concluded that ―in our view the record does not reveal any\nrational basis for believing that the [group] home would pose any special threat to\nthe city‘s legitimate interests‖ and thus invalidated the city ordinance as applied to\nthe group home in that case. (Cleburne, supra, 473 U.S. at p. 448.) All nine\njustices in Cleburne agreed that the application of the city ordinance to require a\nspecial permit for the group home was unconstitutional. The majority opinion\nreflected the views of six justices. The other three justices would have gone\nfurther to hold that classification on the basis of mental retardation calls for\nheightened scrutiny and that the city ordinance was invalid not only as applied but\nalso on its face. (Id. at p. 478 (conc. & dis. opn. of Marshall, J.).)\n       I have presented Cleburne‘s equal protection analysis in some detail\nbecause a careful reading of it confirms what many commentators have long\nobserved: In addressing a statutory classification based on mental retardation,\nCleburne did not apply conventional rational basis review. (E.g., Tribe, American\nConstitutional Law (2d ed. 1988) §§ 16–33, p. 1615 [Cleburne ―appl[ied]\nheightened scrutiny, despite ostensible application of the minimum rationality\ntest‖]; Wilkinson, The Dual Lives of Rights: The Rhetoric and Practice of Rights\nin America (2010) 98 Cal. L.Rev. 277, 296, fn. 117 [Cleburne ―applied rational\nbasis review with bite‖]; Pettinga, Rational Basis with Bite: Intermediate Scrutiny\nby Any Other Name (1987) 62 Ind. L.J. 779, 793–796 [same].) As Justice\n\n                                           33\n\fMarshall said, ―Cleburne‘s ordinance surely would be valid under the traditional\nrational-basis test applicable to economic and commercial regulation.‖ (Cleburne,\nsupra, 473 U.S. at p. 456 (conc. & dis. opn. of Marshall, J.).) ―To be sure, the\nCourt does not label its handiwork heightened scrutiny,‖ but ―Cleburne‘s\nordinance is invalidated only after being subjected to precisely the sort of probing\ninquiry associated with heightened scrutiny.‖ (Id. at p. 458.)\n       Whatever the label, Cleburne‘s analysis has two telling features that\ndistinguish it from ordinary rational basis review. First, Cleburne repeatedly\nrejected the ―one step at a time‖ rationale for requiring only the group home for\nthe mentally retarded to obtain a special permit. There was nothing inherently\nirrational about the city‘s contention that the group home presented concerns about\nflood risks, legal liability, density, and congestion. What Cleburne found\nirrational was the city‘s failure to extend the permit requirement to other uses\nimplicating the same concerns. This analysis defies the usual deference given to\nthe legislature ―to proceed in an incremental and uneven manner without\nnecessarily engaging in arbitrary and unlawful discrimination.‖ (Maj. opn., ante,\nat p. 33.)\n       Second, Cleburne expressly noted that ―the record‖ did not support the\ncity‘s asserted justifications for treating the group home differently. (Cleburne,\nsupra, 473 U.S. at p. 448 [―[I]n our view the record does not reveal any rational\nbasis for believing that the [group] home would pose any special threat to the\ncity‘s legitimate interests . . . .‖ (italics added)]; id. at p. 450 [―At least this record\ndoes not clarify how . . . the characteristics of the intended occupants of the\n[group] home rationally justify [differential treatment].‖ (italics added)].)\nCleburne‘s insistence on record support for the city‘s proffered rationales marks a\nclear departure from the ordinary rule that ―legislative choice . . . may be based on\nrational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data.‖ (Beach\n\n                                            34\n\fCommunications, supra, 508 U.S. at p. 315.) It was not irrational to speculate that\nthe group home would present greater risks of legal liability or flood-related harms\nthan other uses of the neighborhood. Nor was it irrational for the city to argue that\n―the discrimination was really motivated by a desire to protect the mentally\nretarded from the hazards presented by the neighborhood.‖ (Cleburne, supra, 473\nU.S. at p. 455 (conc. opn. of Stevens, J.).) But the high court declined to uphold\nthe permit requirement on the basis of such rational speculation in the absence of\nrecord support.\n                                         B.\n       Since Cleburne, the high court has addressed a statutory classification\nbased on mental retardation in one other case, Heller v. Doe, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112896\"><a href=\"/opinion/112896/heller-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Heller), which involved an equal protection challenge to differences in the\nstatutory procedures for involuntary commitment of persons alleged to be mentally\nill and persons alleged to be mentally retarded. Kentucky‘s civil commitment\nstatutes required proof of mental illness beyond a reasonable doubt, but required\nproof of mental retardation only by clear and convincing evidence. (Id. at p. 315.)\nIn addition, Kentucky law authorized guardians and immediate family members,\nwhether friendly or adverse to the potential committee, to participate as parties in\ncommitment proceedings based on alleged mental retardation but not in\nproceedings based on alleged mental illness. (Ibid.) A class of persons\ninvoluntarily committed on the basis of mental retardation challenged both\nstatutory distinctions.\n       In its equal protection analysis, the high court applied rational basis review\nand described the standard at some length. (Heller, supra, 509 U.S. at pp. 319–\n321.) Quoting extensively from a broad range of cases examining social and\neconomic legislation, the court returned to the propositions that the legislature\n―need not ‗actually articulate at any time the purpose or rationale supporting its\n\n                                         35\n\fclassification‘ ‖ (id. at p. 320), that the legislature ―has no obligation to produce\nevidence to sustain the rationality of a statutory classification‖ (ibid.), and that ―a\nlegislature‘s generalizations‖ must be accepted ―even when there is an imperfect\nfit between means and ends‖ (id. at p. 321). The court‘s opinion mentioned\nCleburne once, simply noting: ―We have applied rational-basis review in previous\ncases involving the mentally retarded and the mentally ill. See Cleburne v.\nCleburne Living Center, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111507\"><a href=\"/opinion/111507/cleburne-v-cleburne-living-center-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1985) . . . .‖ (Heller, at p. 321.)\n       Applying conventional rational basis review, the high court reasoned that\nKentucky‘s different burdens of proof for mental illness and mental retardation\ncould be justified on several reasonably conceivable grounds: the greater\ndifficulty of diagnosing mental illness compared to diagnosing mental retardation,\nthe greater accuracy of determining dangerousness based on past behavior in the\ncase of mental retardation as opposed to mental illness, and the more invasive\ntreatment to which the mentally ill are subjected as compared to the mentally\nretarded. (Heller, supra, 509 U.S. at pp. 322–326.) Four justices dissented from\nthis part of the court‘s opinion, noting the absence of record support for any of the\nhypothesized rationales and citing numerous scientific authorities casting doubt on\nthe generalization that treatments for the mentally retarded are less invasive than\ntreatments for the mentally ill. (Id. at pp. 337–346 (dis. opn. of Souter, J.).)\n       As for Kentucky‘s different rules for participation of guardians and family\nmembers as parties in commitment proceedings, the high court said the distinction\ncould plausibly be based on a greater need for privacy among persons diagnosed\nas mentally ill and on the greater likelihood that guardians and family members\nwill have knowledge helpful to the trier of fact in the case of persons alleged to be\nmentally retarded as opposed to mentally ill. (Heller, supra, 509 U.S. at pp. 328–\n330.) On this point, three justices dissented, noting no record support for the\ncourt‘s speculative generalization concerning the privacy needs of the two groups.\n\n                                           36\n\f(Id. at pp. 346–349 & fn. 9 (dis. opn. of Souter, J.).) The dissenters also explained\nthat even if guardians and family members are more likely to have knowledge\nhelpful to the fact finder in cases of alleged mental retardation as opposed to\nalleged mental illness, ―[t]he Court simply points to no characteristic of mental\nretardation that could rationally justify‖ the participation of guardians and family\nmembers not only as witnesses but as parties — in essence, ―a second prosecutor‖\n— in one proceeding but not the other. (Id. at p. 347.)\n       It is evident, as the dissenters observed, that although ―Cleburne was the\nmost recent instance in which [the high court] addressed a classification on the\nbasis of mental disability,‖ Heller did not apply Cleburne‘s analysis yet made no\neffort to distinguish it. (Heller, supra, 509 U.S. at p. 337 (dis. opn. of Souter, J.);\nsee ibid. [―While the Court cites Cleburne once, and does not purport to overrule\nit, neither does the Court apply it, and at the end of the day Cleburne‘s status is\nleft uncertain.‖].) The closely divided court‘s unexplained departure from\nCleburne, in which all nine justices endorsed at least the level of equal protection\nscrutiny applied by the majority opinion, detracts from Heller‘s persuasive force in\ninforming the proper interpretation of the equal protection guarantee under our\nstate Constitution. (Cal. Const., art. I, § 7, subd. (a); see id., § 24 [―Rights\nguaranteed by this Constitution are not dependent on those guaranteed by the\nUnited States Constitution‖].)\n       More to the point, the primary thesis of the court‘s opinion in Heller is that\ndifferences in commitment procedures reflect real differences between mental\nillness and mental retardation as opposed to ―irrational prejudice against the\nmentally retarded‖ (Cleburne, supra, 473 U.S. at p. 450). The problem, however,\nis that the critical question of whether a classification based on mental retardation\nreflects real differences as opposed to irrational prejudice cannot be reliably\nanswered without at least the level of analysis undertaken in Cleburne. Indeed, if\n\n                                           37\n\fany reasonably conceivable state of facts could support such a classification, then\nthe permit requirement in Cleburne should have been upheld. For there are many\ngeneralizations within the realm of rational speculation that could have supported\none or several of the city‘s proffered justifications for distinguishing between\nmentally retarded persons and others. Without insisting on record facts to support\nthose generalizations, there is no way to know whether they actually reflect real\ndifferences or simply assumptions consciously or unconsciously shaped by ― ‗a\nhistory of unfair and often grotesque mistreatment‘ ‖ (id. at p. 454 (conc. opn. of\nStevens, J.)).\n       The high court‘s observation in Heller, citing Blackstone and others, that\n―differences in treatment between the mentally retarded and the mentally ill . . .\nhave long existed in Anglo-American law‖ further illustrates the point. (Heller,\nsupra, 509 U.S. at p. 326; see ibid. [―At English common law there was a ‗marked\ndistinction‘ in the treatment accorded ‗idiots‘ (the mentally retarded) and ‗lunatics‘\n(the mentally ill). [Citation.]‖].) How are we to know whether such historical\npractices were grounded in real differences or in prevailing prejudices of the sort\nthat the archaic and pejorative labels seem to imply? As Justice Souter said,\n―[s]urely the Court does not intend to suggest that the irrational and scientifically\nunsupported beliefs of pre-19th-century England can support any distinction in\ntreatment between the mentally ill and the mentally retarded today.‖ (Id. at p. 345,\nfn. 6 (dis. opn. of Souter, J.); see ibid. [―At that time, ‗lunatics‘ were ‗[s]een as\ndemonically possessed or the products of parental sin [and] were often punished or\nleft to perish.‘ [Citation.] The primary purpose of an adjudication of ‗idiocy‘\nappears to have been to ‗depriv[e] [an individual] of [his] property and its profits.‘\n[Citation.]‖].) It may well be that ―there is a commonsense distinction between\nthe mentally retarded and the mentally ill.‖ (Id. at pp. 326–327 (maj. opn.).) But\n\n\n\n                                           38\n\fcommon sense may sometimes be wrong, or it may provide no support for a\nparticular legislative classification.\n       California is among the majority of states with separate commitment\nschemes for mentally ill and mentally retarded individuals. Traditionally,\ncommitment statutes for the mentally retarded ―provided less procedural\nprotection than commitment statutes for the mentally ill and were less explicit with\nrespect to commitment criteria . . . .‖ (Melton et al., Psychological Evaluations for\nthe Courts: A Handbook for Mental Health Professionals and Lawyers (2d ed.,\n1997) p. 333 (Melton).) California‘s commitment statutes reflect the general\npattern. As discussed earlier (ante, at pp. 16–19), the LPS Act as enacted in 1967\nprovided a right to counsel for persons alleged to be mental ill, and by 1970, the\nLPS Act guaranteed such persons facing prolonged commitment the right to\ndemand a jury trial as well as an advisement of that right. By contrast, the section\n6500 scheme did not include a right to counsel for persons alleged to be mentally\nretarded until 1975, and the right to a jury trial has been secured gradually through\ncase law (see maj. opn., ante, at pp. 14–15 & fn. 14).\n       In explaining these disparities, one authority has observed that ―the law‘s\napproach to people with mental retardation, premised on the irreversibility of their\ncondition, was less solicitous of their property and person than was the case with\npeople suffering from mental illness. In addition, there may have been an\nunderlying assumption that people with mental retardation require less legal\nprotection because they are more easily identifiable than people with mental\nillness and thus are less likely to be committed arbitrarily.‖ (Melton, supra, at\np. 333.) But the same authority concludes that such distinctions are ―unjustified‖:\n―In reality, there is no reason for treating individuals differently based on their\ndiagnosis as far as the legal structure for commitment is concerned. The line\nbetween ‗mental retardation‘ and ‗normal‘ intellectual and adaptive functioning is\n\n                                          39\n\fas difficult to discern as that between ‗mental illness‘ and ‗mental health.‘ ‖\n(Ibid.)\n          I would not go so far as to suggest that there must be strict equality between\nthe commitment procedures applicable to mental illness and mental retardation.\nSuch a broad rule, whether correct or not, is not necessary to decide this case. The\nquestion here is whether a difference in procedure concerning jury trial\nadvisement can be justified on the basis of real differences between the two groups\nas opposed to some latent bias. As Cleburne recognized, that question cannot be\nanswered by simply positing any reasonably conceivable state of facts concerning\nthe two groups. Instead, the ―record [must] clarify how . . . the characteristics of\n[persons facing commitment under section 6500] rationally justify denying to\n[them]‖ the advisement to which persons facing commitment under section 5300\nare entitled. (Cleburne, supra, 473 U.S. at p. 450.)\n                                            C.\n          The evolution of public policy and scientific understanding over the past\nhalf-century has not effaced the distinction between mental illness and mental\nretardation. Instead, it has reinforced the principle implicit in Cleburne that\nunsupported generalizations about any group based on mental disability carry a\nsubstantial risk of harm. As recounted above (ante, at pp. 16–19), legal reforms\nextending civil rights and other protections to persons with mental illness have\ntended to precede similar reforms affecting persons with mental retardation. But a\nnumber of developments since the 1970s, when section 6500 largely took its\ncurrent form, have sought to counter the historic tendency to treat persons with\nmental retardation on the basis of categorical and unfounded assumptions of\ndeficits and incapacities, and instead to enable each person to realize and act on\nhis or her individual abilities.\n\n\n\n                                            40\n\f       The 1970s saw a wave of legislation advancing the rights of individuals\nwith disabilities. (See Rothstein & Irzyk, Disabilities and the Law (4th ed. 2012)\npp. 4–7, 28–29.) Congress enacted the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which\naddressed vocational rehabilitation and employment opportunities for individuals\nwith physical or mental disabilities. (Pub.L. No. 93-112 (Sept. 26, 1972) 87 Stat.\n355.) Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act requires nondiscrimination and\naffirmative action by federal employers (29 U.S.C. § 791), and section 503 of the\nact does the same for federal contractors (29 U.S.C. § 793). Section 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act — ―the most significant federal protection for individuals with\ndisabilities‖ until the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Rothstein & Irzyk,\nat p. 5) — requires nondiscrimination and reasonable accommodation by\nrecipients of federal money (29 U.S.C. § 794), including schools, public facilities,\ntransportation agencies, and health and welfare services. These requirements\nreflect Congress‘s policy of ―respect for individual dignity, personal\nresponsibility, self-determination, and pursuit of meaningful careers, based on\ninformed choice, of individuals with disabilities.‖ (29 U.S.C. § 701(c)(1).)\n       In 1975, Congress enacted the Education for All Handicapped Children\nAct, which exemplified the emerging principle of treating persons with disabilities\non the basis of individual ability: ―It is the purpose of this Act to assure that all\nhandicapped children have available to them . . . a free appropriate public\neducation which emphasizes special education and related services designed to\nmeet their unique needs . . . .‖ (Pub.L. No. 94-142, § 3 (Nov. 29, 1975) 89 Stat.\n773.) This legislation along with its successor, the Individuals with Disabilities\nEducation Act (Pub.L. No. 101-476, § 901 (Oct. 30, 1990) 104 Stat. 1103),\nestablished the entitlement of each child with a disability to an individualized\neducation program ―tailored to a child‘s unique needs [and] designed by the school\n\n\n\n                                           41\n\fdistrict in consultation with the child‘s parents.‖ (Forest Grove School Dist. v.\nT. A. (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145855\"><a href=\"/opinion/145855/forest-grove-school-dist-v-t-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">557</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 234, fn. 1; see 20 U.S.C. §§ 1412(a)(4), 1414(d).)\n       Also in 1975, Congress enacted the Developmentally Disabled Assistance\nand Bill of Rights Act, which called for individualized treatment and services:\n―The treatment, services, and habilitation for a person with developmental\ndisabilities should be designed to maximize the developmental potential of the\nperson and should be provided in the setting that is least restrictive of the person‘s\npersonal liberty.‖ (Pub.L. No. 94-103, § 201 (Oct. 4, 1975) 89 Stat. 486.) As a\ncondition of receiving federal funding under this law and its successor statutes,\neach state is required to adopt a plan that assures, among other things, that ―any\ndirect services provided to individuals with developmental disabilities and funded\nunder the plan will be provided in an individualized manner, consistent with the\nunique strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, and capabilities of such\nindividual.‖ (42 U.S.C. § 15024(c)(5)(G).)\n       In 1990, Congress passed the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),\nprohibiting discrimination against individuals with physical or mental disabilities.\n(Pub.L. No. 101-336 (July 26, 1990) 104 Stat. 327.) Notably, the ADA forbids\ndiscrimination based on ―an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment\nwhether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit a major life activity.‖\n(42 U.S.C. § 12102(3)(A).) The workplace nondiscrimination and reasonable\naccommodation requirements of the ADA continue Congress‘s policy of ensuring\nthat persons with disabilities are treated on the basis of their individual talents and\nabilities rather than their actual or perceived limitations. (42 U.S.C. §§ 12111(8),\n(9), 12112(b).)\n       Recent legislation has changed the language that statutes use to refer to\nindividuals with disabilities. In 2010, Congress replaced the phrase ―mental\nretardation‖ with ―intellectual disability‖ in the federal codes. (Pub.L. No. 111-\n\n                                          42\n\f256 (Oct. 5, 2010) 124 Stat. 2643.) Although such changes are sometimes\ndisparaged as acts of political correctness, a Senate report explained: ―[T]he terms\n‗mentally retarded,‘ ‗mental retardation,‘ and variations of these terms, to describe\nindividuals with intellectual disabilities are anachronistic, needlessly insensitive\nand stigmatizing, and clinically outdated. Terms to describe individuals with\nintellectual disabilities have gone through a steady evolution over the past two\ncenturies, each iteration describing those living with the condition in a pejorative\nway. At the turn of the 20th century, people who were viewed as having\nlimitations in intellectual advancement and social behavior were institutionalized.\nThe prevailing sentiment at the time being that such people could not, should not,\ninteract with people without disabilities. [¶] ‗Imbecile,‘ ‗moron,‘ ‗idiot,‘ and\n‗feeble-minded‘ are all terms which have been used to reference people with\ncognitive disabilities by the public and in our Federal statutes. Each of these terms\nfocused on perceived deficiencies to describe such individuals. The most recent\nterm — ‗mental retardation‘ — was used to characterize those with cognitive\ndisabilities as having general diminished capacities for cognitive functioning.\nPhysicians, advocates, and law makers now understand that this term does not\naccurately describe these individuals.‖ (Sen.Rep. No. 111-244, 2d Sess., p. 2\n(2010).) Just weeks ago, our Legislature similarly replaced the term ―mental\nretardation‖ and related language with ―developmental disability‖ throughout the\nsection 6500 scheme. (Assem. Bill No. 1472, approved by Governor, June 27,\n2012 (2011–2012 Reg. Sess.).)\n       All of these developments have sought to overcome the historical practice\nin our nation and our state of categorically treating persons with intellectual\ndisabilities as incapable of understanding their own circumstances or participating\nin public institutions and civic life. To be sure, there are real differences between\npersons with such disabilities and others. Such differences, however, can only be\n\n                                          43\n\fdistinguished from entrenched and possibly unfounded assumptions by insisting\non an actual, demonstrable basis — and not mere hypothesis or conjecture — for\ntreating people differently because of that disability.\n                                          D.\n       For the foregoing reasons, I would hold as a matter of state equal protection\nlaw that the Cleburne standard is the proper standard of review for evaluating\nstatutory classifications based on mental retardation. Whatever Cleburne‘s status\nmay be as a matter of federal law after Heller, we have long noted that ―our state\nequal protection provisions, while ‗substantially the equivalent of‘ the guarantees\ncontained in the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, are\npossessed of an independent vitality which, in a given case, may demand an\nanalysis different from that which would obtain if only the federal standard were\napplicable.‖ (Serrano v.

The independent\nvitality of our state equal protection guarantee has led this court to hold — upon\ncanvassing judicial, legislative, and other historical developments in a similar\nmanner as I have done here — that strict scrutiny applies to laws that discriminate\non the basis of sexual orientation or gender, even though federal courts review\nsuch laws under less stringent standards.

Consistent with this\ninterpretive tradition, I conclude that Cleburne‘s rational basis scrutiny applies as\na matter of state law to distinctions based on mental retardation.\n       This court‘s equal protection jurisprudence has generally applied a two-\ntiered approach that subjects challenged classifications either to strict scrutiny or\nto rational basis review. Although Cleburne applied neither strict scrutiny nor\nconventional rational basis review, I do not see much to be gained by multiplying\n\n                                          44\n\flabels to further differentiate among tiers of review. (Cf. Cleburne, supra, 473\nU.S. at p. 451 (conc. opn. of Stevens, J.) [―[O]ur cases reflect a continuum of\njudgmental responses to differing classifications which have been explained in\nopinions by terms ranging from ‗strict scrutiny‘ at one extreme to ‗rational basis‘\nat the other. I have never been persuaded that these so-called ‗standards‘\nadequately explain the decisional process.‖].) The essence of rational basis review\nis that a legislative classification ―must be rationally related to a legitimate\ngovernmental purpose.‖ (Id. at p. 446 (maj. opn.).) Like all doctrinal tests, this\ngeneral requirement acquires greater specificity through application, and\nCleburne, in my view, elucidates the proper application of rational basis review\nwhere a statutory classification is based on mental retardation as opposed to\ndistinctions among cable television facilities (Beach Communications, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112870\"><a href=\"/opinion/112870/fcc-v-beach-communications-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">), eye care professionals (Lee Optical, supra, 348 U.S. at p. 489), or tort\nvictims (American Bank, supra, 36 Cal.3d at pp. 373–374).\n       In reaching this conclusion, I am mindful of Cleburne‘s observation that\npolicies ―singling out the retarded for special treatment‖ are ―in the vast majority\nof situations . . . not only legitimate but also desirable.‖ (Cleburne, supra, 473\nU.S. at p. 444.) Unlike strict or intermediate scrutiny, the rational basis test\nrecognizes that ―[e]specially given the wide variation in the abilities and needs of\nthe retarded themselves, governmental bodies must have a certain amount of\nflexibility and freedom from judicial oversight in shaping and limiting their\nremedial efforts.‖ (Id. at p. 445.) Nevertheless, it is appropriate that Cleburne‘s\nskepticism toward unsubstantiated generalizations and legislative inconsistency\napplies equally to ―remedial‖ laws that purport to benefit individuals with\nintellectual disabilities. For if there is any lesson to be learned from this area of\nhistory, it is that the injurious character of many benignly motivated policies\nbecame apparent only after objective inquiry or scientific advancement revealed\n\n                                           45\n\ftheir unfounded premises for what they were. The officials who approved the\nsterilization of Carrie Buck, for example, seemed confident that they were doing\nso for her own good. (Ante, at p. 10.) It is possible that some policies we today\nregard as remedial will, upon finer inspection, come to be regarded tomorrow as\nunwarranted paternalism.\n       Although the court says Cleburne is ―outmoded in this context‖ (maj. opn.,\nante, at p. 35, fn. 21), other courts have continued to rely on Cleburne for its\napproach to rational basis review even after Heller. (See, e.g., Massachusetts v.\nU.S. Dept. of Health & Human Services (1st Cir. 2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">682</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 10–11 [citing\nCleburne to show that ―equal protection assessments are sensitive to the\ncircumstances of the case and not dependent entirely on abstract categorizations‖];\nVision Mining, Inc. v.

In any event, even if Heller has\n―superseded‖ Cleburne (maj. opn., ante, at p. 35, fn. 21), the court provides no real\nanalysis as to why Heller and not Cleburne should frame the standard of review\nthat applies to discrimination on the basis of mental retardation under state equal\nprotection principles — even though this issue has not previously been settled by\nour court, even though article I, section 24 of the California Constitution says\nthat ―[r]ights guaranteed by this Constitution are not dependent on those\nguaranteed by the United States Constitution,‖ even though we have adopted equal\nprotection standards that are more stringent than federal standards in other areas,\nand even though the history of discrimination on the basis of mental retardation\nclearly distinguishes this kind of discrimination from ordinary economic and\nsocial legislation. Far from ―crafting [my] own constitutional theory of equal\n\n                                          46\n\fprotection‖ (maj. opn., ante, at p. 35, fn. 21), I have provided an explicit and\nreasoned explanation as to why the Cleburne approach is appropriate here, using\nthe same type of analysis that our court has used in the past when confronted with\nsimilarly novel equal protection issues. By contrast, the court simply does not\nengage this issue apart from asserting that ―we have correctly applied [Heller]‖\nand that Cleburne‘s approach is ―unduly strict‖ and thus improper here. (Maj.\nopn., ante, at p. 35, fn. 21.) We do not ordinarily decide important questions of\nconstitutional law in such a conclusory manner.\n                                          E.\n       Applying Cleburne‘s principles to the instant case, I conclude that the\nrecord reveals no rational basis for requiring courts to provide a jury trial\nadvisement to persons facing commitment under section 5300 but not to persons\nfacing commitment under section 6500. Cleburne‘s analysis forecloses reliance\non a ―one step at a time‖ rationale. If the difference in commitment procedure is\nto be sustained, it must be on the basis of a valid generalization about each group‘s\nability to understand the advisement. But there are no legislative findings or other\nfacts on record to support such a generalization.\n       There is nothing irrational about a conjecture that the proportion of\nmentally disordered persons facing a 180-day commitment under the LPS Act who\ncan understand the advisement is greater than the comparable proportion among\npersons alleged to be mentally retarded under section 6500. But it is a mere\nconjecture nonetheless. As previously discussed (ante, at pp. 21–22), a person\nfacing a 180-day commitment under section 5300 is a person actually (not\nallegedly) suffering from a mental disorder who has already undergone a 72-hour\nevaluation and treatment period (§ 5150) followed by a 14-day ―intensive\ntreatment‖ period (§ 5250) and possibly an ―additional‖ 30-day period of\n―intensive treatment‖ (§ 5270.15). Despite such treatment, such a person is\n\n                                          47\n\falleged to ―present[], as a result of mental disorder or mental defect, a\ndemonstrated danger of inflicting substantial physical harm upon others.‖\n(§ 5300.) It is a fair inference that many such individuals are so mentally\ndisordered that, even with treatment, they cannot understand a jury trial\nadvisement. Meanwhile, given the range of cognitive abilities among persons\ndiagnosed as mentally retarded and among persons merely ―alleged‖ to be\nmentally retarded under section 6500, it is a fair inference that many such\nindividuals are, with or without treatment, capable of understanding a jury trial\nadvisement. (Ante, at p. 22.) The record before us provides no factual basis to\ndetermine whether the two groups really differ with respect to ability to\nunderstand an advisement and, if so, whether the difference is large or small.\n       Moreover, although the Legislature could have believed the benefits of an\nadvisement requirement to be worth the administrative burden in section 5300\nproceedings but not in section 6500 proceedings, there are no facts or findings in\nthe record to support the rationality of such a legislative judgment. Of course,\nevery procedural requirement presents an incremental burden. But it is not\nobvious how burdensome an advisement really is, especially when considered\napart from any right to personal waiver. It is possible that a court reporter may be\nnecessary to record the advisement. But there is no need for a competency hearing\nwith respect to an advisement alone. Although some individuals will not\nunderstand an advisement, others will. If the efficiency of an advisement\nrequirement were expressed as a ratio of its benefits to its burdens, the ratio would\nremain quite large even if the magnitude of the benefits varied from group to\ngroup, so long as the magnitude of the burdens was much smaller. The lack of any\nrecord indication of how burdensome it is to provide a jury trial advisement makes\nit difficult to conclude that the statutory distinction at issue reflects considerations\n\n\n\n                                           48\n\fof administrative efficiency that merely ―burden the retarded in what is essentially\nan incidental manner‖ (Cleburne, supra, 473 U.S. at p. 446).\n       Importantly, my analysis does not suggest that the Legislature is foreclosed\nfrom adopting different commitment procedures (short of procedures implicating a\nfundamental right) based on generalizations about persons who are mentally\ndisordered and persons who are alleged to be mentally retarded. The problem in\nthis case is that such generalizations lack any factual basis in the record that would\ndispel an inference of irrational prejudice, and thus the statutory distinction is\ninvalid as presently drawn. However, the Legislature would remain free, in my\nview, to reenact the distinction if it were to articulate and provide some factual\nsupport for its classificatory rationale. (Cf. Califano v. Goldfarb (1977) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109612\"><a href=\"/opinion/109612/califano-v-goldfarb/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">199</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 221–222 & 223, fn. 9 (conc. opn. of Stevens, J.) [finding Social Security\nsurvivors‘ benefit statute invalid because Congress ―simply assumed that all\nwidows [but not widowers] should be regarded as ‗dependents,‘ ‖ but leaving open\nthe possibility that ―an actual, considered legislative choice would be sufficient to\nallow this statute to be upheld‖].) Legislative inquiry might reveal that most\npersons facing commitment under section 6500 are more than mildly retarded, that\nmost persons facing commitment under section 5300 are not cognitively impaired,\nor that an advisement requirement presents administrative burdens that are not\nimmediately obvious. When the Legislature has provided actual reasons and made\nfindings to support a classification on the basis of mental retardation, the resulting\nstatute is entitled to a high degree of deference. The Legislature may properly\nconsider the efficiency of procedures designed to commit persons with mental\ndisabilities who are dangerous to themselves or others, and a reviewing court\nshould refrain from second-guessing the Legislature‘s actual, factually supported\njudgment that a particular classification is rationally related to a legitimate\narticulated purpose.\n\n                                          49\n\f       Finally, the term ―irrational prejudice‖ (Cleburne, supra, 473 U.S. at\np. 450) merits a brief comment. When it is said that a hypothesized yet\nunsubstantiated generalization is not sufficient to negate an inference of irrational\nprejudice, I do not think a necessary or even proper implication is that the policy\nin question was born of subjective animus. I would not suggest, for example, that\nthe legislators who supported the enactment of section 6500 (or the citizens who\nelected those legislators) were motivated by ill will toward persons alleged to be\nmentally retarded. Instead, an irrational prejudice may, and most often does, arise\nfrom good-faith adherence to unexamined assumptions that reflect historic or\nprevailing attitudes. In recent decades, many legislative developments concerning\ninvoluntary commitment have perhaps reflected a widespread belief that because\nmental illness is less permanent and more treatable than mental retardation, people\nwho are mentally ill are ―closer to normal‖ than people who are mentally retarded.\nWhatever merit such a totalizing assumption may have as a general matter, it\ncannot alone — in the absence of relevant supporting facts — justify a particular\nlegislative classification without taking on the character of an irrational prejudice\nin that specific context.\n                                          F.\n       While holding that persons facing commitment under section 6500 have a\nright to a jury trial, today‘s opinion characterizes the advisement that Barrett seeks\nas an ―ancillary,‖ ―collateral,‖ or ―additional adjunct‖ procedure. (Maj. opn., ante,\nat pp. 19, 24, 15.) Potential committees have a right to counsel (§ 6500), and the\ncourt says counsel ―is presumed competent and informed as to applicable\nconstitutional and statutory law‖ and ―can be expected, where necessary or\nadvisable, to consult with the client about jury trial concerns.‖ (Maj. opn., ante, at\np. 26.) This may be a pertinent response to Barrett‘s due process claim. But it is\nno answer to her equal protection claim because one could just as easily say that\n\n                                          50\n\fthe right to counsel adequately protects the jury trial right of individuals facing\ncommitment under section 5300. Indeed, section 5302 requires a jury trial\nadvisement even as it not only provides for a right to counsel but also expressly\ninstructs that ―[t]he attorney shall advise the person of his rights in relation to the\nproceeding . . . .‖\n       It may be true that counsel generally knows best and that the option to\ndemand or waive a jury trial will typically result in the same decision whether an\nadvisement is given or not. But the importance of an advisement goes beyond its\ninstrumental value. Whether or not an advisement alters the ultimate choice to\nproceed with or without a jury, it expresses the legal system‘s respect for the\nindividual as a participant in, and not a mere object of, the commitment\nproceedings. For those who are capable of understanding it, an advisement by the\ncourt recognizes their dignity as well as their ability to comprehend and possibly\nparticipate in an important aspect of a proceeding that may adversely and\nirreversibly shape the rest of their lives. Having extended this recognition to some\npersons with mental disabilities, the Legislature must have an actual, considered\nrationale for not extending it to others.\n       In sum, the instant case implicates two sensitivities that run deep in the\nhistory of society‘s treatment of persons with intellectual disabilities. The first is\nan unfounded assumption of incapacity. As previously noted (ante, at p. 22), the\nsection 6500 scheme does not assume that all individuals facing commitment lack\nthe ability to comprehend an advisement. Nor should it assume, without\nsupporting facts, that proportionally more persons lack such ability in proceedings\nunder section 6500 than in proceedings under section 5300.\n       Second, the assumption of incapacity occurs in the context of a proceeding\nthat may result in precisely the sort of isolation and segregation that reinforces and\nperpetuates the assumption of incapacity. As Congress recognized among its\n\n                                            51\n\ffindings when it passed the ADA, ―historically, society has tended to isolate and\nsegregate individuals with disabilities, and, despite some improvements, such\nforms of discrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be serious\nand pervasive social problem . . . .‖ (42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(2).)\n       It is true that an order of commitment under section 6500 ―expire[s]\nautomatically one year after‖ it is made. (§ 6500.) But a person may be\nrecommitted year after year, without limit, through procedures that are ―the same\nas with an initial petition for commitment.‖ (Ibid.) Where a trial court finds an\nindividual to be mentally retarded — a condition that ―never recede[s]‖ (maj. opn.,\nante, at p. 24) — and where the court also finds, as it did here, that ―the danger she\nposed to herself and others was based upon, and caused by, her mental\nretardation‖ (id. at p. 7), the initial commitment proceeding and the findings made\ntherein potentially lay the groundwork for lengthy, possibly even lifetime\nconfinement. (See Melton, supra, at p. 334 [―the relatively stable nature of their\ncondition‖ means hospitalization of people with mental retardation ―could amount\nto confinement for life‖].) Before being consigned to such a fate, a person alleged\nto be mentally retarded is entitled to the same advisement, and the same respect\nand recognition, that the Legislature has seen fit to grant other persons with mental\ndisabilities who are facing prolonged commitment. That such respect and\nrecognition may be ―largely symbolic‖ (maj. opn., ante, at p. 35, fn. 21) does not\ndiminish the importance of Barrett‘s claim, for it is evident from many historic\nclaims of equality vindicated by our court and others that the principle of equal\nprotection ―often bears its fruit in those regions where symbol becomes\nsubstance.‖ (Karst, Equal Citizenship Under the Fourteenth Amendment (1977)\n91 Harv. L.Rev. 1, 6.)\n\n\n\n\n                                         52\n\f                                          VI.\n       The Court of Appeal found that even if Barrett was entitled to advisement\nand personal waiver of her jury trial right, the error was harmless in light of the\nevidence of her mental retardation and dangerousness: ―There was no dispute that\nBarrett is a person with mental retardation. And, given her recent history, as\ndocumented in the reports attached to the petition for commitment and the\ntestimony of Robert Thomas, there was substantial evidence that she is a danger to\nherself or others, even though there was no evidence that anyone, as yet, had\nsuffered actual and serious physical injury as a result of her behavior. She\nregularly assaulted others and engaged in self-mutilation and suicidal ideation.\nAnd though Barrett disputes it, there was undisputed evidence, as the trial court\nfound, that her mental retardation is a substantial factor in her inability to control\nher dangerous behavior.‖\n       I agree with the Court of Appeal that the failure to advise was not structural\nerror requiring automatic reversal. The Court of Appeal applied the harmless error\nstandard for federal constitutional error (Chapman v. California (1967) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107359\"><a href=\"/opinion/107359/chapman-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 24), but ―application of a state harmless-error rule is, of course, a state\nquestion where it involves only errors of state procedure or state law‖ (id. at\np. 21). Here, even if the Legislature violated the federal as well as state equal\nprotection guarantee by failing to afford Barrett the same right to advisement\nafforded under section 5302, the error in Barrett‘s trial was the denial of a state\nstatutory right. If the Legislature were to correct the constitutional violation\ntomorrow by amending section 6500, any subsequent advisement error would be\nsubject to state harmless error analysis.
