The Supreme Court’s decision\nin Citizens United v. FEC, 130 S. Ct. 876 (2010), is best\nknown for striking down as an unconstitutional restric-\ntion of free speech the federal law that bans corporations\nand labor unions from running campaign-related adver-\ntisements in the lead-up to an election. That holding\nlargely overshadowed another part of the decision up-\n\f2                                                     No. 11-3693\n\nholding the same law’s campaign finance disclosure\nprovisions. Those provisions require any outside entity\nor individual spending significant sums in a federal\nelection to file reports with the Federal Election Com-\nmission (FEC) identifying the person or group making\nthe expenditure, its amount, and the names of certain\ncontributors. Describing disclosure requirements as a\n“less restrictive alternative to more comprehensive reg-\nulations of speech,” the Citizens United Court wrote\nthat “prompt disclosure of expenditures can provide\nshareholders and citizens with the information needed\nto hold corporations and elected officials accountable\nfor their positions and supporters. . . . The First Amend-\nment protects political speech; and disclosure permits\ncitizens and shareholders to react to the speech of corpo-\nrate entities in a proper way.” Id. at 916. Despite this\nholding, in the aftermath of Citizens United a number\nof suits have been filed challenging federal and state\ndisclosure regulations as facially unconstitutional. Of\nthe federal courts of appeals that have decided these\ncases, every one has upheld the disclosure regulations\nagainst the facial attacks.1\n\n\n\n1\n  See National Org. for Marriage, Inc. v. Sec’y, No. 11-14193, 2012\nWL 1758607, at *1 (11th Cir. May 17, 2012) (unpublished\nopinion) (rejecting facial and as-applied challenge to Florida\ndisclosure laws); The Real Truth About Abortion, Inc. v. FEC, 681\nF.3d 544, 546 (4th Cir. 2012) (rejecting facial and as-applied\nchallenge to FEC disclosure regulations pursuant to Federal\nElection Campaign Act); Family PAC v.

Plaintiff-\nappellant Center for Individual Freedom (the Center)\nseeks to invalidate Illinois disclosure requirements on\nthe grounds that they are facially vague and overbroad\nrestrictions of speech in violation of the First and Four-\nteenth Amendments. Illinois’s disclosure law is modeled\non the federal one. It requires groups and individuals that\naccept “contributions,” make “expenditures,” or sponsor\n“electioneering communications” in excess of $3,000 to\nmake regular financial disclosures to the State Board of\nElections. See 10 ILCS 5/9-1.8. The Illinois Election Code\ndrew the key definitions of “contribution,” “expenditure,”\n\n\n\n1\n  (...continued)\n811 (9th Cir. 2012) (rejecting facial challenge to Washington\ndisclosure laws); National Org. for Marriage v. McKee, 649 F.3d 34,\n41 (1st Cir. 2011) (rejecting facial challenge to Maine disclosure\nlaws); Human Life of Wash. Inc. v. Brumsickle, 624 F.3d 990, 994-95\n(9th Cir. 2010) (rejecting facial challenge to Washington disclo-\nsure laws); see also Speechnow.org v. FEC, 599 F.3d 686, 696-98\n(D.C. Cir. 2010) (upholding federal disclosure requirements\nas applied to unincorporated nonprofit association that was\nrequired by the FEC to register as a political committee). But cf.\nSampson v. Buescher, 625 F.3d 1247, 1249 (10th Cir. 2010) (invali-\ndating Colorado campaign finance disclosure requirements\nas applied to neighborhood group that had raised less than\n$1,000 to oppose annexation); New Mexico Youth Organized v.\nHerrera, 611 F.3d 669, 671 (10th Cir. 2010) (invalidating New\nMexico disclosure requirements as applied to two nonprofit\norganizations “formed for the purpose of educating young\nNew Mexicans about issues such as healthcare, clean elections,\nthe economy and the environment”).\n\f4                                               No. 11-3693\n\nand “electioneering communication” from federal law.\nThe only substantive differences are that the Illinois\ndisclosure requirements (1) cover election activity relating\nto ballot initiatives, which have no federal analog; (2) do\nnot exempt from regulation those groups that lack the\n“major purpose” of influencing electoral campaigns; and\n(3) cover campaign-related advertisements that appear\non the Internet. The Center argues that these differences,\nand a few other terms in the Illinois statute, render\nits disclosure regime unconstitutionally vague and\noverbroad on its face.\n  To prevail in such a facial challenge, a plaintiff must\ncross a high bar. A statute is facially overbroad only\nwhen “it prohibits a substantial amount of protected\nspeech,” United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 292 (2008),\nand unconstitutionally vague only when its “deterrent\neffect on legitimate expression is . . . both real and sub-\nstantial.” Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U.S.\n50, 60 (1976) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe district court granted the state’s motion to dismiss,\nfinding that the Center could not meet these standards.\nWe affirm.\n\n\nI. Factual and Procedural Background\n  The Center is a Virginia-based § 501(c)(4) nonprofit\norganization whose stated mission is “to protect and\ndefend individual freedoms and individual rights guaran-\nteed by the U.S. Constitution.” To that end, it broad-\ncasts advertisements, maintains a website, publishes a\nweekly e-mail newsletter, produces a bi-weekly radio\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                   5\n\nshow, and engages in other forms of mass media com-\nmunications. Its tax exempt status under § 501(c)(4) is\nincompatible with partisan political activity, so the\nCenter cannot endorse candidates or urge the public to\n“vote for so-and-so.” But apart from a need to avoid\nsuch “express advocacy,” in the lingo of campaign\nfinance law, the Center and other § 501(c)(4) groups\nenjoy fairly wide latitude from the IRS. During election\nseasons, the Center runs advertisements that refer to\nthe positions of candidates or to ballot issues and call\non the audience to take actions such as contacting candi-\ndates.2\n  The Center wished to engage in similar advocacy\nduring the 2010 elections in Illinois and made plans to\naddress “legal reform and other justice-related issues” in\n\n\n2\n  In one TV spot, for instance, the Center criticized West\nVirginia Attorney General Darrell McGraw during his 2008\nreelection campaign:\n    Announcer: They say you can’t teach an old dog new tricks.\n    Twenty-eight years of controversy and Darrell McGraw\n    is at it again, spending $10 million from a settlement meant\n    to help workers and the elderly — instead, divvying it up\n    between his trial lawyer buddies and a fund only\n    controlled by McGraw. The Wheeling Intelligencer said,\n    “Legislators should have put a leash on McGraw long ago.”\n    But they say you can’t teach an old dog new tricks. Call\n    Darrell McGraw. Tell him to return the people’s money.\nDkt. No. 73; CFIF Launches Public Education Effort in W. Va.,\nYoutube, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPMwR2gMNTE\n(last visited Aug. 29, 2012).\n\f6                                               No. 11-3693\n\nadvertisements referring to incumbent officeholders\nwho were candidates. But the Center feared that Illinois’s\nnewly-amended campaign finance laws would require it\nto register as a “political committee” and to disclose\nits election-related expenditures and its significant con-\ntributors. According to the Center, its donors require\nassurances that their identities will not be disclosed, and\nthis anonymity is a condition of their support. The\nCenter says it had no choice but to forbear from its\nIllinois “issue advocacy” in 2010, so its political speech\nwas chilled by Illinois’s disclosure laws.\n  These laws are codified in Article 9 of the Illinois Elec-\ntion Code. Article 9 is long and filled with the jargon\nof contemporary U.S. campaign finance law — “election-\neering communications,” “independent expenditures,”\netc. — which we detail in Part IV of this opinion. But\nArticle 9’s basic provisions are fairly easy to summarize.\nEach political committee in Illinois must register with\nthe Board of Elections, maintain records of every con-\ntribution received and expenditure made “in connec-\ntion with” an election, 10 ILCS 5/9-7, and file a report of\nall such transactions each quarter, 10 ILCS 5/9-10(b).\nThis quarterly report must include the total sums\nof contributions received and expenditures made in\nthe covered period; accountings of the committee’s funds\non-hand and investment assets held; and the name\nand address of each contributor who gave more than\n$150 that quarter. 10 ILCS 5/9-11(a). In addition to the\nquarterly report, a political committee must disclose\nany contribution of $1,000 or more (along with the\nname and address of the contributor) within five days of\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                   7\n\nits receipt, or within two days if received 30 or fewer days\nbefore an election. 10 ILCS 5/9-10(c). For reporting viola-\ntions, the Board may issue civil fines of no more than\n$5,000 for any one group (except in the case of “willful\nand wanton” violations), or seek to enjoin violators’\ncampaign activities in state court. 10 ILCS 5/9-10.3\n   Candidates’ campaign organizations and political\nparties of course must register as political committees.\n10 ILCS 5/9-1.8(b), (c). But so too must outside groups\nand private individuals if, within any 12-month period,\nthey accept contributions or make expenditures in\nexcess of $3,000 “on behalf of or in opposition to” any\ncandidate or ballot question. 10 ILCS 5/9-1.8(d), (e). Any\nentity other than a natural person must also register as\na political committee if it makes “independent expendi-\ntures” of more than $3,000 within one year. 10 ILCS 5/9-\n8.6(b). Illinois has largely borrowed from federal law\nits definition of “electioneering communication,” which\nmeans a radio, television, or Internet broadcast that\n(1) refers to a “clearly identified” candidate, political\nparty, or ballot issue; (2) is made within two months of\na general election or one month of a primary election,\n(3) is “targeted to the relevant electorate,” and (4) is\n\n\n3\n   The Board or any political committee may also seek injunc-\ntive relief in state court to compel compliance with Board\norders or to enjoin an offending committee’s operations. 10 ILCS\n5/9-23, 5/9-24. Filing false or incomplete information in a\ncampaign finance report may also constitute a “business\noffense” under the Criminal Code punishable by criminal fine\nof up to $5,000. See 10 ILCS 5/9-26.\n\f8                                                   No. 11-3693\n\nunambiguously an “appeal to vote” for or against a\ncandidate, party, or ballot issue. 10 ILCS 5/9-1.14.4\nFunds spent on electioneering communications that are\ncoordinated with a political committee are treated as\ncontributions to that committee, while uncoordinated\nelectioneering communications are considered independ-\nent expenditures. See 10 ILCS 5/9-1.15.\n   The Center argues that five of Article 9’s definitions —\n“electioneering communications,” “political committee,”\n“contribution,” “expenditure,” and “independent expendi-\nture” — are facially vague and overbroad. In July 2010,\nthe Center brought suit against the Illinois Attorney\nGeneral and members of the Illinois State Board of Elec-\ntions in their official capacities, see Ex parte Young, 209\nU.S. 123 (1908), seeking to invalidate and enjoin Article 9’s\ndisclosure requirements as unconstitutional restrictions\nof free speech. After the district court denied the\nCenter’s motion for a preliminary injunction, 735\nF. Supp. 2d 994 (N.D. Ill. 2010), and this court denied\nits request for an injunction pending appeal, the Center’s\nappeal was dismissed by agreement without prejudice.\nIn January 2011, the Center filed an amended complaint\ncontaining the same allegations but taking into account\nchanges to Article 9 that took effect on January 1, 2011.\nThe state moved to dismiss, and the Center moved for\n\n\n4\n   Article 9 expressly excludes from this definition any “news\nstory, commentary, or editorial distributed through the\nfacilities of any legitimate news organization.” 10 ILCS 5/9-\n1.14(b)(1). The Center does not challenge the reach or applicabil-\nity of this exemption.\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                  9\n\nsummary judgment. The parties did not dispute any\nmaterial facts. The district court denied the Center’s\nmotion for summary judgment and granted the state’s\nmotion to dismiss. This appeal followed.\n\n\nII. Standing\n  We begin, as we must, with the state’s argument that\nthe Center lacks standing to bring a constitutional chal-\nlenge against Article 9. Although the state did not raise\nthis issue in the district court, standing is a jurisdictional\nrequirement that is not subject to waiver. United States\nv. Hays, 515 U.S. 737, 742 (1995); National Org. for Women,\nInc. v. Scheidler, 510 U.S. 249, 255 (1994).\n  The standing requirement of Article III is part of the\nrestriction of the federal judicial power to “Cases” and\n“Controversies.” U.S. Const. art. III, § 2; Arizona Christian\nSchool Tuition Org. v. Winn, 131 S. Ct. 1436, 1441-42 (2011).\nConstitutional standing imposes three core requirements:\n    First, the plaintiff must have suffered an “injury in\n    fact “— an invasion of a legally protected interest\n    which is (a) concrete and particularized, and\n    (b) “actual or imminent, not ‘conjectural’ or ‘hypotheti-\n    cal.’ ” Second, there must be a causal connection\n    between the injury and the conduct complained of —\n    the injury has to be “fairly . . . trace[able] to the chal-\n    lenged action of the defendant, and not . . . th[e] result\n    [of] the independent action of some third party not\n    before the court.” Third, it must be “likely,” as op-\n    posed to merely “speculative,” that the injury will\n    be “redressed by a favorable decision.”\n\f10                                                  No. 11-3693\n\nId. at 1442, quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S.\n555, 560-61 (1992).\n  On appeal, the state contends that the Center lacks\nstanding because it has neither been subject to any past\nregulation — it has not been ordered to register as a\npolitical committee, threatened with sanctions, or named\nin a Board complaint — nor “demonstrate[d] any proba-\nbility that its speech will trigger Article 9’s registration\nand reporting requirements” in the future. We construe\nthis argument as a challenge to the Center’s injury-in-\nfact showing. (The state does not question whether the\ntraceability and redressability prongs are satisfied here.)\n  It is well settled that pre-enforcement challenges to\ngovernment regulations can be Article III cases or contro-\nversies. Bandt v. Village of Winnetka, 612 F.3d 647, 649\n(7th Cir. 2010). A plaintiff “does not have to await the\nconsummation of threatened injury to obtain preventive\nrelief.” Babbitt v. United Farm Workers Nat’l Union,\n442 U.S. 289, 298 (1979), quoting Pennsylvania v. West\nVirginia, 262 U.S. 553, 593 (1923). To satisfy the in-\njury-in-fact requirement in a pre-enforcement challenge,\nthe plaintiff must show only that she faces “a realistic\ndanger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of the\nstatute’s operation or enforcement.” Id.5\n\n\n\n5\n  See also ACLU of Illinois v. Alvarez, 679 F.3d 583, 590-91 (7th\nCir. 2012) (“To satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement in a\npreenforcement action, the plaintiff must show ‘an intention\nto engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a\n                                                   (continued...)\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                       11\n\n  The injury-in-fact standard is often satisfied in pre-\nenforcement challenges to limitations on speech. The\nSupreme Court has recognized “self-censorship” as a\ndistinct “harm that can be realized even without an\nactual prosecution.” Virginia v. American Booksellers Ass’n,\n484 U.S. 383, 393 (1988).6 The chilling of protected speech\nmay thus alone qualify as a cognizable Article III\ninjury, provided the plaintiffs “have alleged an actual\nand well-founded fear that the law will be enforced\nagainst them.” Id.\n   The Center has made this showing. It has a history\nof broadcasting messages concerning public policy and\npolitical candidates across the United States. It has alleged\nthat while it wishes to engage in similar advocacy in\nIllinois, it has curtailed its speech because it fears being\n\n\n\n(...continued)\nconstitutional interest, but proscribed by a statute, and\n[that] there exists a credible threat of prosecution thereunder.’ ”),\nquoting Babbitt, 442 U.S. at 298.\n6\n   See also Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 486-87 (1965)\n(“Because of the sensitive nature of constitutionally protected\nexpression, we have not required that all of those subject to\noverbroad regulations risk prosecution to test their rights. For\nfree expression of transcendent value to all society, and not\nmerely to those exercising their rights — might be the loser. . . .\nWe have fashioned . . . exception[s] to the usual rules gov-\nerning standing . . . because of the danger of tolerating, in the\narea of First Amendment freedoms, the existence of a penal\nstatute susceptible of sweeping and improper application.”)\n(internal citations and quotation marks omitted).\n\f12                                              No. 11-3693\n\nregulated as a political committee. The Center’s President\nsubmitted an affidavit stating that but for Article 9,\nhis organization would have spoken out during the\n2010 Illinois elections using “the typical form of issue\nad,” that “[f]unding was available,” and that its “wish\nto speak in Illinois remained live.” The Center’s\nstandard issue advertisements are run during election\nseason, identify an issue of public policy, give concrete\nexamples to “illustrate the policy” using candidates\nwith whom the public is familiar, and call on the\naudience to take some “action other than voting, e.g.\ncontacting named candidates and encouraging them\nto continue or embrace the policy.” The Center’s typical\nissue ads meet enough of the statutory elements to\nqualify, at least arguably, as electioneering communica-\ntions under Illinois law, and the Center would easily\npass the $3,000 registration threshold. The Center’s self-\ncensorship was based on an objectively reasonable,\n“actual[,] and well-founded fear that the law will be\nenforced against” it. American Booksellers, 484 U.S. at 393.\n  The state asserts that Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. v.\nParadise, 138 F.3d 1183 (7th Cir. 1998), shows that the\nCenter lacks a sufficiently well-founded fear of being\nsubject to regulation. In that case, we held that the\nplaintiff did not have standing to challenge Wisconsin’s\npolitical committee registration requirements because\nsuccessive advisory opinions of the Wisconsin Attorney\nGeneral and regulations promulgated by the state\nelection board already established that the definition of\npolitical committee did not apply to groups like the\nplaintiff. Id. at 1185. These formal determinations by\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                    13\n\nthe state authorities meant that the plaintiff’s fear of\nprosecution under the law was not “objectively ‘well-\nfounded,’ ” id., quoting American Booksellers, 484 U.S. at 393,\nthat the lawsuit was an attempt “to resolve a con-\ntroversy that has not yet arisen and may never arise,”id.\nat 1187-88, and that the plaintiff therefore lacked standing.7\n  This case is quite different for there has been no\ndetermination by any Illinois official that the Center and\nother such groups do not qualify as political committees\nunder Article 9. The named defendants are the Illinois\nAttorney General and members of the Board of Elections.\nThey have not denied that the Center’s past out-of-state\n“issue ads” could qualify as electioneering communica-\ntions under the Illinois disclosure laws. Unlike Paradise,\nthere is a sufficiently realistic possibility that the Center\nwould be subject to Article 9’s registration and reporting\nrequirements if it engages in the type of political\nadvocacy it often does and wishes to in Illinois. That is\n\n\n\n7\n   Technically, the Paradise holding was on the redressability\nprong rather than the injury-in-fact prong of the standing rule.\nThe only real potential threat of injury to the plaintiff came\nfrom private actors, whom the Wisconsin statute empowered\nto bring enforcement suits in state court against unregistered\norganizations that ran illegal campaign advertising. A\npotential injury from a decision by a state court in private\nlitigation was not redressable by a federal court order\nbecause a state court is not required to accept an inferior\nfederal court’s determination that a statute is unconstitu-\ntionally overbroad. We therefore held that the third prong\nof Article III standing (redressability) was not met. Id. at 1187.\n\f14                                               No. 11-3693\n\nenough to establish that the Center has an objectively\nreasonable fear of being subject to Illinois’s registration\nand reporting requirements if it engages in its intended\nspeech, and that the Center chose to avoid those\nalleged burdens. “Such self-censorship in the face of\npossible legal repercussions suffices to show Article III\ninjury.” National Org. for Marriage v. McKee, 649 F.3d 34, 48-\n49 (1st Cir. 2011) (finding that nonprofit group had stand-\ning to challenge state disclosure laws in pre-enforce-\nment action); accord, Human Life of Wash. Inc. v. Brumsickle,\n624 F.3d 990, 1001 (9th Cir. 2010) (same). We find that\nthe Center has Article III standing to challenge the con-\nstitutionality of Illinois’s disclosure law.\n\n\nIII. Scope of Review: Facial Challenge\n  Next we must clarify the scope of the legal challenge\nbefore us. The Center describes its suit as both a facial and\nan as-applied challenge, arguing that Article 9 is uncon-\nstitutionally vague and overbroad “both facially and as\napplied to independent issue advocacy groups such\nas CFIF.” It is true that facial challenges and as-applied\nchallenges can overlap conceptually. See Doe v. Reed, 130\nS. Ct. 2811, 2817 (2010) (acknowledging that plaintiffs’\nclaim “has characteristics of both” as-applied and facial\nchallenge); Richard Fallon, As-Applied and Facial Challenges\nand Third-Party Standing, 113 Harv. L. Rev. 1321, 1341\n(2000) (“[F]acial challenges are less categorically distinct\nfrom as-applied challenges than is often thought.”). But\nthere is a difference: Where the “claim and the relief that\nwould follow . . . reach beyond the particular circum-\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                15\n\nstances of the[] plaintiffs,” “[t]hey must . . . satisfy [the]\nstandards for a facial challenge to the extent of that reach.”\nDoe v. Reed, 130 S. Ct. at 2817 (2010).\n   This is not a case where a group has actually engaged\nin a particular form of speech that is subject to regulation\nand seeks to challenge the applicability of the law to\nitself and other groups who have engaged in similar\nexpressive activity. Cf. FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life,\n551 U.S. 449 (2007) (as-applied challenge to federal statute\nbanning electioneering communications brought by\nadvocacy group that had run TV advertisements it\nbelieved would be covered by the statute if group con-\ntinued to run them during 60-day pre-election blackout\nperiod). Here, the Center has not broadcast any communi-\ncations in Illinois, so it would be impossible for this\ncourt to fashion a remedy tailored to its own particular\nspeech activities and those of similar groups, for we\nhave only a general idea of what its hypothetical broad-\ncasts would say. The Center has not laid the foundation\nfor an as-applied challenge here. We analyze its claims\nunder the standards governing facial challenges.\n  Those standards set a high bar. In reversing a decision\nstriking down a state election law in a facial challenge,\nthe Supreme Court explained:\n    Facial challenges are disfavored for several reasons.\n    Claims of facial invalidity often rest on speculation.\n    As a consequence, they raise the risk of premature\n    interpretation of statutes on the basis of factually\n    barebones records. Facial challenges also run contrary\n    to the fundamental principle of judicial restraint\n\f16                                                 No. 11-3693\n\n     that courts should neither “’anticipate a question of\n     constitutional law in advance of the necessity of\n     deciding it’ ” nor “formulate a rule of constitutional\n     law broader than is required by the precise facts to\n     which it is to be applied.” Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.S.\n     288, 347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring). Finally,\n     facial challenges threaten to short circuit the demo-\n     cratic process by preventing laws embodying the\n     will of the people from being implemented in a\n     manner consistent with the Constitution.\nWashington State Grange v. Wash. State Republican Party,\n552 U.S. 442, 450-51 (2008) (some citations, brackets, and\ninternal quotation marks omitted). In determining whether\na law is unconstitutional on its face, then, “we must\nbe careful not to go beyond the statute’s facial require-\nments and speculate about ‘hypothetical’ or ‘imaginary’\ncases.” Id. at 450, citing United States v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17,\n22 (1960). With these principles in view, we turn to the\nmerits of the Center’s facial challenge to Article 9. We\nreview de novo the district court’s treatment of the con-\nstitutional questions presented. E.g., Anderson v. Milwaukee\nCounty, 433 F.3d 975, 978 (7th Cir. 2006).\n\n\nIV. Overbreadth and Void-for-Vagueness Claims\n  The Supreme Court has recognized a particular type\nof facial challenge in the First Amendment context\nunder which a law may be struck down entirely as\nimpermissibly overbroad. Under this overbreadth\ndoctrine, “a statute is facially invalid if it prohibits a\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                     17\n\nsubstantial amount of protected speech.” United States v.\nWilliams, 553 U.S. 285, 292 (2008). The overbreadth doctrine\nis “’strong medicine’ ” that should be “employed . . . with\nhesitation, and then ‘only as a last resort.’ ” New York v.\nFerber, 458 U.S. 747, 769 (1982), quoting Broadrick v.\nOklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 613 (1973). Accordingly, courts\n“vigorously enforce[ ] the requirement that a statute’s\noverbreadth be substantial, not only in an absolute\nsense, but also relative to the statute’s plainly legitimate\nsweep.” Williams, 553 U.S. at 292.\n  Since its seminal modern campaign finance decision\nin Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 19 (1976), the Supreme\nCourt has consistently distinguished between laws that\nrestrict the amount of money a person or group can\nspend on political communication and laws that simply\nrequire disclosure of information by those who spend\nsubstantial sums on political speech affecting elections.8\n\n\n\n8\n  See, e.g., Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. 876 (striking down federal\nban on electioneering communications by corporations and\nlabor unions but upholding disclosure requirements as applied\nto such entities); McConnell v. FEC, 540 U.S. 93 (2003) (striking\ndown federal ban on political donations by minors but up-\nholding law’s disclosure provisions), overruled in part on\nother grounds, Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 913; FEC v. Massachu-\nsetts Citizens for Life, 479 U.S. 238, 262 (1986) (striking down\nrequirement that corporations set up segregated fund for\nindependent expenditures in connection with any federal\nelection as applied to nonprofit advocacy group while\npointing approvingly to “disclosure provisions” that will\n                                                    (continued...)\n\f18                                                   No. 11-3693\n\nUnlike contribution and expenditure limits, disclosure\nlaws “impose no ceiling on campaign-related activities,”\nid. at 64, and “do not prevent anyone from speaking.”\nCitizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 914, quoting McConnell v.\nFEC, 540 U.S. 93, 124 (2003), overruled in part on other\ngrounds, Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 913. Disclosure\nlaws are thus a “less restrictive alternative to more com-\nprehensive regulations of speech.” Citizens United,\n130 S. Ct. at 915. For that reason, the Court does not\nsubject disclosure requirements to the same standard of\n\n\n\n(...continued)\n“provide precisely the information necessary to monitor\nMCFL’s independent spending activity and its receipt of\ncontributions”); Citizens Against Rent Control v. City of Berkeley,\n454 U.S. 290, 298 (1981) (striking down ordinance capping\ncontributions to ballot initiative committees while noting\nthat the ordinance’s disclosure requirements were alone\nadequate to fulfill the city’s informational interest in knowing\n“whose money supports or opposes a given ballot measure”);\nFirst National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 790 n.29\n(1978) (striking down Massachusetts law prohibiting corpora-\ntions from making contributions or expenditures to influence\nthe outcome of initiatives and referenda but noting: “Identifica-\ntion of the source of advertising may be required as a means\nof disclosure, so that the people will be able to evaluate\nthe arguments to which they are being subjected.”); Buckley,\n424 U.S. at 68 (invalidating federal expenditure limits\nbut upholding disclosure requirements, which “certainly in\nmost applications appear to be the least restrictive means of\ncurbing the evils of campaign ignorance and corruption\nthat Congress found to exist”).\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                      19\n\nstrict scrutiny that applies to contribution and expendi-\nture limits but rather to “exacting scrutiny,” which\nrequires only “a ‘substantial relation’ between the dis-\nclosure requirement and a ‘sufficiently important’ gov-\nernmental interest.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 914,\nquoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 64, 66.9 We apply exacting\nscrutiny to the Center’s facial challenges to Article 9,\nexamining whether the disclosure requirements are\nsubstantially related to a sufficiently important govern-\nmental interest.\n  In this case, the state interest at stake is that of\n“provid[ing] the electorate with information as to\nwhere political campaign money comes from and how it\nis spent.” Buckley, 424 U.S. at 66 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). This “informational interest” is suf-\nficiently important to support disclosure requirements.\nSee, e.g., id. at 66-67. In Buckley, the Court recognized\nthat campaign finance disclosure was a critical tool for\nmaintaining transparency in the political marketplace:\n“In a republic where the people are sovereign, the\nability of the citizenry to make informed choices among\ncandidates for office is essential, for the identities of those\n\n\n9\n   See also Doe v. Reed, 130 S. Ct. 2811, 2818 (2010) (“We have a\nseries of precedents considering First Amendment challenges\nto disclosure requirements in the electoral context. These\nprecedents have reviewed such challenges under what has\nbeen termed ‘exacting scrutiny.’ ”); Buckley v. American Con-\nstitutional Law Foundation, Inc., 525 U.S. 182, 202 (1999) (“’exact-\ning scrutiny’ is necessary when compelled disclosure of cam-\npaign-related payments is at issue”).\n\f20                                              No. 11-3693\n\nwho are elected will inevitably shape the course that\nwe follow as a nation.” Id. at 14-15.1 0 Disclosure require-\nments advance the public’s interest in information\nby “allow[ing] voters to place each candidate in the\npolitical spectrum more precisely than is often possible\nsolely on the basis of party labels and campaign\nspeeches.” Id. at 67. By revealing “the sources of a candi-\ndate’s financial support,” disclosure laws “alert the\nvoter to the interests to which a candidate is most likely\nto be responsive and thus facilitate predictions of future\nperformance in office.” Id.\n  The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized this\ninformational interest and the unique role that disclosure\nplays in furthering it.1 1 Our court, too, has acknowledged\nthe importance of disclosure regulations in providing\n“additional information useful to the consumer” of politi-\ncal messaging. Majors v. Abell, 361 F.3d 349, 352 (7th Cir.\n2004). In Majors, we upheld an Indiana law requiring\npolitical ads to identify the persons who paid for them:\n       The avidity with which candidates for public office\n       seek endorsements is evidence (as if any were needed)\n\n\n10\n  See also Letter from James Madison to W.T. Barry (Aug. 4,\n1822), in 9 Writings of James Madison 103 (Gaillard Hunt, ed.\n1910) (“A popular Government, without popular information, or\nthe means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a Farce or a\nTragedy; or perhaps, both. Knowledge will forever govern\nignorance: And a people who means to be their own Governors,\nmust arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.”).\n11\n     See, e.g., cases cited above in note 8.\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                     21\n\n     that the identity of a candidate’s supporters — and\n     opponents — is information that the voting public\n     values highly. In areas of inquiry where logic or\n     exact observation is unavailing, a speaker’s credibility\n     often depends crucially on who he is. As Aristotle\n     said, “persuasion is achieved by the speaker’s\n     personal character when the speech is so spoken as\n     to make us think him credible. We believe good men\n     more fully and more readily than others: this is true\n     generally whatever the question is, and absolutely\n     true where exact certainty is impossible and\n     opinions are divided.”\nId., quoting Aristotle, Rhetoric, in 2 The Complete Works\nof Aristotle 2152, 2155 (Jonathan Barnes ed. 1984); see also\nAbrams v. United States, 250 U.S. 616, 630 (Holmes, J.,\ndissenting) (“Of course, the identity of the source is\nhelpful to evaluating ideas.”). We agree that this is a\nsufficiently important governmental interest to support\nIllinois’s disclosure requirements, and we proceed\nbelow under the exacting-scrutiny framework to examine\nwhether there is a substantial relation between\nIllinois’s informational interest and the features of\nArticle 9 that the Center contends are overbroad.1 2\n\n\n12\n   The state also invokes two other interests in support of Article\n9, stating that disclosure laws both prevent corruption and its\nappearance and enable enforcement of other campaign\nfinance laws, such as those imposing dollar limits on direct\ncontributions to campaigns. Buckley recognized that disclosure\nrequirements can advance these substantial interests, as\n                                                    (continued...)\n\f22                                                  No. 11-3693\n\n  Before doing so, however, we briefly describe the Cen-\nter’s alternative theory, that certain provisions of Article 9\nare unconstitutionally vague. Like the overbreadth doc-\ntrine, the void-for-vagueness doctrine protects against\nthe ills of a law that “fails to provide a person of ordinary\nintelligence fair notice of what is prohibited, or is so\nstandardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously\ndiscriminatory enforcement.” FCC v. Fox Television\nStations, Inc., 132 S. Ct. 2307, 2317 (2012), quoting\nWilliams, 553 U.S. at 304. The “vagueness doctrine ad-\ndresses at least two connected but discrete due process\nconcerns: first, that regulated parties should know what\nis required of them so they may act accordingly;\nsecond, precision and guidance are necessary so that\nthose enforcing the law do not act in an arbitrary or\ndiscriminatory way.” Id., citing Grayned v. City of\nRockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108-09 (1972). In cases where the\n“statute abuts upon sensitive areas of basic First Amend-\nment freedoms,” Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108-09 (brackets\nomitted), “rigorous adherence to those requirements is\n\n\n\n(...continued)\nwell. See 424 U.S. at 67-68 (concluding that “disclosure require-\nments deter actual corruption and avoid the appearance of\ncorruption by exposing large contributions and expenditures\nto the light of publicity” and that “recordkeeping, reporting, and\ndisclosure requirements are an essential means of gathering\nthe data necessary to detect violations of the contribution\nlimitations described above”). Because the informational\ninterest is sufficient to support Illinois’s laws, we do not\nreach whether these other interests also support Article 9.\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                    23\n\nnecessary to ensure that ambiguity does not chill pro-\ntected speech.” Fox Television Stations, 132 S. Ct. at 2317.\nEven under the heightened standard for the First Amend-\nment, though, the potential chilling effect on protected\nexpression must be both “real and substantial” to invali-\ndate a statute as void for vagueness in a facial challenge.\nErznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 216 (1975).\nIn addition, a “plaintiff who engages in some conduct\nthat is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vague-\nness of the law as applied to the conduct of others.” Village\nof Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, 455 U.S.\n489, 495 (1982).\n  In sum, both the vagueness and overbreadth questions\ninvolve the same preliminary inquiry into whether the\nstatute will have a substantial effect on constitutionally\nprotected activity: “In a facial challenge to the over-\nbreadth and vagueness of a law, a court’s first task is\nto determine whether the enactment reaches a sub-\nstantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct.”\nFlipside, 455 U.S. at 494 (footnote omitted). If it does not,\nthen under either theory the facial challenge must fail.\nIn the First Amendment context, vagueness and over-\nbreadth are two sides of the same coin, and the two sorts\nof challenges are often conceived of as “alternative and\noften overlapping” theories for relief on the same claim.\nJordan v. Pugh, 425 F.3d 820, 827 (10th Cir. 2005)\n(McConnell, J.).13\n\n\n\n13\n  See also Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 359 n.8 (1983) (“[W]e\nhave traditionally viewed vagueness and overbreadth as\n                                                   (continued...)\n\f24                                                     No. 11-3693\n\n  The Center has presented its overbreadth and\nvagueness claims as one undifferentiated argument,\nasserting that Article 9’s provisions are both “vague and\noverbroad.” This is not unusual, see Human Life, 624 F.3d\nat 1020, and does not call for criticism. This case does not\nrequire us to parse fine distinctions between the two\ntheories. Whether the argument is styled as overbreadth\nor vagueness, the central question in this facial challenge\nis whether the provisions at issue potentially reach a\n“substantial” amount of protected speech.\n  Campaign finance disclosure requirements have\nexisted at the federal level since 1910. See Campaign\nExpenses Publicity Act of 1910, Pub. L. No. 274, 36 Stat.\n822.

Shelby Cnty., 588 F.3d 372, 379 (6th Cir. 2009) (“When\na law implicates First Amendment freedoms, vagueness poses\nthe same risk as overbreadth, as vague laws may chill citizens\nfrom exercising their protected rights.”); Richard H.

Because the Supreme Court has upheld FECA’s\ndisclosure requirements, we need not invent the wheel\nin this case. Instead, we identify the ways in which Illi-\nnois’s disclosure law is broader or more vague than\nFECA and then consider whether each difference is\nconstitutionally permissible. Article 9 differs from fed-\neral disclosure provisions in two significant respects.\nFirst, Article 9 extends the disclosure of expenditures\nand contributions to ballot initiative campaigns. Second,\nArticle 9 regulates as a political committee any organiza-\ntion that exceeds the dollar-limit spending thresholds,\nwhile under federal law only those groups with the\n“major purpose” of influencing elections must register as\npolitical committees. In addition to these substan-\ntive differences, Article 9’s definitions of several key\nterms — “electioneering communication,” “expenditure,”\n“contribution,” and “independent expenditure” — differ\nslightly from their federal law analogs. We first\nanalyze the two broader questions on ballot initiatives\nand the major-purpose test before turning to the\nstatutory details.\n\n\n  A. Disclosures for Ballot Issue Campaigns\n    1. Contributions and Expenditures\n  In Illinois, individuals and groups must register as\n“ballot initiative committees” when they accept contribu-\n\f26                                                  No. 11-3693\n\ntions or make expenditures in support of or in opposition\nto any question of public policy in amounts exceeding\n$3,000 in a 12-month period. 10 ILCS 5/9-1.8(e). Federal\nlaw does not provide for ballot initiatives and referenda,\nso FECA contains no corresponding requirements. The\nissue here is whether this additional feature of Article 9’s\ndisclosure regime is substantially related to Illinois’s\ninterest in maintaining an informed electorate.\n  Educating voters is at least as important, if not more\nso, in the context of initiatives and referenda as in candi-\ndate elections. In direct democracy, where citizens are\n“responsible for taking positions on some of the day’s\nmost contentious and technical issues, ‘[v]oters act as\nlegislators,’ while ‘interest groups and individuals ad-\nvocating a measure’s defeat or passage act as lobbyists.’ ”\nHuman Life, 624 F.3d at 1006, quoting California Pro-Life\nCouncil, Inc. v. Getman, 328 F.3d 1088, 1105 (9th Cir. 2003);\nsee also Doe v. Reed, 130 S. Ct. at 2833 (Scalia, J., concurring)\n(“When a . . . voter signs a referendum petition . . ., he\nis acting as a legislator.”). In an initiative campaign,\n“average citizens are subjected to advertising blitzes of\ndistortion and half-truths and are left to figure out for\nthemselves which interest groups pose the greatest\nthreats to their self-interest.” Human Life, 624 F.3d at 1006,\nquoting David S. Broder, Democracy Derailed: Initiative\nCampaigns and the Power of Money 18 (2000). Because\nthe issues can be complex and the public debate con-\nfusing, voters’ interest in knowing the source of messages\npromoting or opposing ballot measures is especially\nsalient in such campaigns.\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                 27\n\n   Disclosure laws are substantially related to the public’s\ninterest in information during ballot initiative cam-\npaigns. Research shows that one of the most useful heuris-\ntic cues influencing voter behavior in initiatives\nand referenda is knowing who favors or opposes a mea-\nsure. See Elizabeth Garret & Daniel A. Smith, Veiled\nPolitical Actors and Campaign Disclosure Laws in Direct\nDemocracy, 4 Election L.J. 295, 296-98 (2005); Michael S.\nKang, Democratizing Direct Democracy: Restoring Voter\nCompetence Through Heuristic Cues and “Disclosure Plus”, 50\nUCLA L.

The first two groups of voters demonstrated\nsimilar voting patterns, while the third group that was com-\npletely in the dark had very different voting patterns. The\nstudy author concluded that the position of an economic group\nwith known preferences on an issue can serve as an effective\nshortcut for ordinary voters, substituting for encyclopedic\ninformation about the electoral choice.

See United States v. Harriss, 347 U.S. 612, 625 (1954).\n\n\n15\n  The McConnell Court gave examples of a few such stealthily-\nnamed groups, including “Citizens for Better Medicare,” which\n“was not a grassroots organization of citizens, as its name\nmight suggest, but was instead a platform for an association of\ndrug manufacturers.” 540 U.S. at 128.

Ct. at 2833 (Scalia, J., concurring in the judg-\nment), the State requires those who “attempt to influence\nlegislation” being considered on the ballot to disclose\na “modicum of information from those who for hire\nattempt to influence legislation or who collect or spend\nfunds for that purpose” — namely, “who is putting up\nthe money, and how much.” See Harriss, 347 U.S. at 625.\nThis “enables the electorate to make informed decisions\nand give proper weight to different speakers and mes-\nsages.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 916. Such regulation\nis substantially related to Illinois’s interest in preserving\nan informed electorate. Accord, Family PAC v. McKenna,\n685 F.3d at 811; Human Life, 624 F.3d at 1008.\n  Although the Supreme Court has not directly passed\non state disclosure requirements for ballot initiatives, it\nhas discussed such laws approvingly. See Citizens\nAgainst Rent Control v. City of Berkeley, 454 U.S. at 298\n(striking down cap on contributions but noting that law’s\ndisclosure requirements adequately fulfilled need for\ninformation in ballot measure contests); First Nat’l Bank\nof Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 792 n.32 (1978) (striking\ndown state law prohibiting corporate contributions or\nexpenditures to influence referenda: “Identification of the\nsource of advertising may be required as a means of\ndisclosure, so that the people will be able to evaluate the\narguments to which they are being subjected.”); Buckley v.\nAmerican Constitutional Law Foundation, Inc., 525 U.S. 182,\n202-03 (1999) (striking down state law requiring propo-\nnents of initiatives to report the names, addresses, and\n\f30                                                No. 11-3693\n\nearnings of all paid circulators, who had to wear name\nbadges while gathering signatures; disclosure require-\nments remained in effect to aid voters in evaluating\nmessages). These three cases strongly suggest that disclo-\nsure laws are substantially related to the state’s infor-\nmational interest in the context of ballot initiative cam-\npaigns.\n  To be sure, requiring disclosure in the ballot initiative\ncontext may burden First Amendment rights in two\nways. First, disclosure requirements may deter contribu-\ntions or expenditures by some individuals and groups\nwho would prefer to remain anonymous. See Buckley v.\nValeo, 424 U.S. at 68. Second, “disclosure requirements\ncan chill donations to an organization by exposing donors\nto retaliation.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 916; see, e.g.,\nBrown v. Socialist Workers ‘74 Campaign Comm. (Ohio), 459\nU.S. 87, 100 (1982) (First Amendment prohibits states\nfrom compelling disclosures of campaign finance infor-\nmation from minor political party where there is a “rea-\nsonable probability” that identified persons would be\nsubject to “threats, harassment, and reprisals”).\n  On the record in this facial challenge, however, we\nmust treat these burdens as modest. “[D]isclosure re-\nquirements may burden the ability to speak, but they\nimpose no ceiling on campaign-related activities, and do\nnot prevent anyone from speaking.” Citizens United,\n130 S. Ct. at 914 (citations and internal quotation marks\nomitted). The burden of public identification may\nforeclose application of disclosure laws to individual\npamphleteers, see McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm’n, 514\n\fNo. 11-3693                                               31\n\nU.S. 334 (1995), or small neighborhood groups that raise\nless than $1000, see Sampson v. Buescher, 625 F.3d 1247 (10th\nCir. 2010), for in these cases the state’s interest in dis-\nseminating such information to voters is at a low ebb. See\nMcIntyre, 514 U.S. at 348-49. Here, however, the Center\nis a far cry from the lone pamphleteer in McIntyre,\nand its broad “interest in anonymity” does not justify\ninvalidating disclosure laws in a facial challenge\nbrought by a national political advocacy organization\nthat seeks to use the mass media in Illinois to spread its\npolitical messages on a broad scale. That is exactly the\nsort of campaign-related advertising about which\nIllinois has a substantial interest in providing informa-\ntion to its public.\n  Similarly, the record in this facial challenge does\nnot support any prospect of retaliation that could bar\napplication of Article 9. In Doe v. Reed, the Supreme\nCourt upheld the constitutionality of a state law that\nallowed for public disclosure of petition signers’ names\nand addresses. The Court held that disclosure of the\nnames and addresses of petition signers would not ordi-\nnarily create a “reasonable probability” that they would\nbe harassed. 130 S. Ct. at 2820-21, quoting Buckley, 424\nU.S. at 74. The same result applies here. The Center has\n“provided us scant evidence or argument,” id. at 2821,\nbeyond bare speculation, that Article 9 would be at all\nlikely to precipitate “threats, harassment, or reprisals”\nagainst it or other similarly situated advocacy groups.\nSee Buckley, 424 U.S. at 74.\n  Article 9’s application to contributions and expenditures\nrelated to ballot initiatives is substantially related to\n\f32                                                  No. 11-3693\n\nIllinois’s strong interest in maintaining an informed\nelectorate, and this interest strongly outweighs any bur-\ndens on protected speech, at least in the absence of\nfacts that might be offered in support of a much\nnarrower as-applied challenge.1 6\n\n\n     2. Electioneering Communications on Ballot Issues\n  Article 9 also requires groups to register as ballot initia-\ntive committees when they spend more than $3,000\non electioneering communications that advocate for or\nagainst ballot issues. 10 ILCS 5/9-1.8(e). This provision\nlikewise advances the state’s interest in ensuring voters\nare informed about ballot initiatives. The Center argues\nthat the requirement imposes significant burdens on\nspeakers because the definition of electioneering com-\nmunication does not adequately distinguish ballot initia-\ntive campaign advocacy from pure issue discussion.\nThe Center’s argument relies principally on two\nSupreme Court cases — Buckley v. Valeo and FEC v. Wis-\nconsin Right to Life, Inc., 551 U.S. 449 (2007). The Buckley\nCourt upheld all of the disclosure and reporting require-\nments in FECA. To avoid the regulation of pure “issue\ndiscussion,” though, the Court placed a narrowing con-\nstruction on the term “expenditure” “to reach only\nfunds used for communications that expressly advocate\nthe election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.”\n\n\n16\n  The failure of the Center’s “broad based challenge does not\nforeclose success” on a future as-applied challenge to Article 9.\nSee Doe, 130 S. Ct. at 2821.\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                   33\n\nBuckley, 424 U.S. at 80 (footnote omitted) (emphasis\nadded). This was the genesis of a distinction Buckley\nhad earlier drawn in the context of independent ex-\npenditures between issue discussion and express advo-\ncacy. The latter, the Court said, would typically involve the\nuse of unequivocal words and phrases “such as ‘vote\nfor,’ ‘elect,’ ‘support,’ ‘cast your ballot for, ‘Smith for\nCongress,’ . . . ‘defeat,’ ‘reject’ ”— a list that has come to be\nknown as Buckley’s “magic words.” Id. at 44 n.52. For many\nyears the Court adhered to the distinction, but it repeatedly\nemphasized that “the express advocacy limitation . . . was\nthe product of statutory interpretation rather than a con-\nstitutional command.” McConnell, 540 U.S. at 191-92; see\nalso Wisconsin Right to Life, 551 U.S. at 475 n.71 (principal\nopinion of Roberts, C.J.) (reiterating that Buckley’s\n“magic words” definition “does not dictate a constitu-\ntional test” and the “express advocacy restriction was\nan endpoint of statutory interpretation, not a first\nprinciple of constitutional law”).\n  In Wisconsin Right to Life, the Supreme Court’s lead\nopinion held that the federal ban on corporate and labor\ndisbursements for campaign-related broadcasts could\nbe applied only to advertisements that were “express\nadvocacy” or its “functional equivalent.” 551 U.S. at 465,\nciting McConnell, 540 U.S. at 206. A broadcast is the\n“functional equivalent of express advocacy only if the\nad is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other\nthan as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candi-\ndate.” Id. at 469-70. While “[c]ourts need not ignore\nbasic background information that may be necessary to\nput an ad in context,” id. at 474 , “there generally should\n\f34                                               No. 11-3693\n\nbe no discovery or inquiry into the sort of contextual\nfactors” that would go to either the speaker’s “subjective”\nintent or the likely “effect” of the ad on the electorate,\nid. at 474 n.7. The Center contends that Article 9’s defini-\ntion of electioneering communication is inconsistent\nwith Buckley and Wisconsin Right to Life because it\nconsiders whether a broadcast refers to a “clearly\nidentified question of public policy that will appear on\nthe ballot.” 10 ILCS 5/9-1.14. The Center calls this “an\nintent-or-effect standard that requires a judgment as\nto how a listener will understand speech,” since the\npublic discussion of certain policy issues could be con-\nsidered discussion of a ballot question.\n  For two reasons, we disagree. First, Citizens United\nmade clear that the wooden distinction between express\nadvocacy and issue discussion does not apply in the\ndisclosure context.\n  In Citizens United, which came after Wisconsin Right to\nLife, the Court explicitly rejected the plaintiff’s attempt to\ngraft the express advocacy/issue discussion dichotomy\nonto the constitutional law of campaign finance disclo-\nsure. 130 S. Ct. at 915. The Court reaffirmed that\n  disclosure is a less restrictive alternative to more compre-\n  hensive regulations of speech. In Buckley, the Court\n  upheld a disclosure requirement for independent expen-\n  ditures even though it invalidated a provision that\n  imposed a ceiling on those expenditures. In McConnell,\n  three Justices who would have found § 441b to be\n  unconstitutional nonetheless voted to uphold BCRA’s\n  disclosure and disclaimer requirements. And the Court\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                     35\n\n     has upheld registration and disclosure requirements\n     on lobbyists, even though Congress has no power to\n     ban lobbying itself. For these reasons, we reject Citizens\n     United’s contention that the disclosure requirements\n     must be limited to speech that is the functional equiva-\n     lent of express advocacy.\nId. at 915 (citations omitted). Accordingly, mandatory\ndisclosure requirements are constitutionally permissible\neven if ads contain no direct candidate advocacy and\n“only pertain to a commercial transaction.” Id. at 915.\nWhatever the status of the express advocacy/issue dis-\ncussion distinction may be in other areas of campaign\nfinance law, Citizens United left no doubt that disclosure\nrequirements need not hew to it to survive First Amend-\nment scrutiny. With just one exception, every circuit\nthat has reviewed First Amendment challenges to dis-\nclosure requirements since Citizens United has concluded\nthat such laws may constitutionally cover more than\njust express advocacy and its functional equivalents, and\nin each case the court upheld the law.1 7\n\n\n17\n  See National Org. for Marriage, Inc. v. Sec’y, No. 11-14193, 2012\nWL 1758607, at *1 (11th Cir. May 17, 2012) (unpublished\nopinion); The Real Truth About Abortion, Inc. v. FEC, 681 F.3d 544,\n551-52 (4th Cir. 2012); National Org. for Marriage v. McKee, 649\nF.3d 34, 54-55 (1st Cir. 2011); Human Life of Wash. Inc. v.\nBrumsickle, 624 F.3d 990, 1016 (9th Cir. 2010). The exception is\nthe Tenth Circuit. In Sampson v. Buescher, 625 F.3d 1247 (10th\nCir. 2010), the court struck down disclosure requirements as\napplied to a neighborhood group that had raised less than\n                                                    (continued...)\n\f36                                                 No. 11-3693\n\n  Second, even if disclosure requirements were constitu-\ntionally applicable only to express advocacy and its\nfunctional equivalent, Illinois’s definition of “electioneer-\ning communication” is limited by language nearly\nidentical to that used in Wisconsin Right to Life to define\nthe functional equivalent of express advocacy. Compare\n10 ILCS 5/9-1.14 (the broadcast must be “susceptible to\nno reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to\nvote for or against a clearly identified candidate, . . . a\npolitical party, or a question of public policy that will\nappear on the ballot”), with Wisconsin Right to Life, 551\nU.S. at 669-70 (principal opinion) (“a court should find\nthat an ad is the functional equivalent of express\nadvocacy only if the ad is susceptible of no reasonable\ninterpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or\nagainst a specific candidate”). Moreover, Article 9’s\n\n\n(...continued)\n$1,000 to oppose annexation. In New Mexico Youth Organized\nv. Herrera, 611 F.3d 669, 677 n.4 (10th Cir. 2010), the court\ninvalidated state disclosure requirements as applied to a\nnonprofit because it believed “that for a regulation of\ncampaign related speech to be constitutional it must be unam-\nbiguously campaign related.” Herrera was decided and argued\nafter Citizens United, but briefing had been completed prior\nto the Supreme Court’s decision. The only reference to Citizens\nUnited was a brief statement in a footnote that “[a]lthough that\nopinion left many issues unresolved, we believe that require-\nment — that for a regulation of campaign related speech to be\nconstitutional it must be unambiguously campaign related\nstandard [sic] — as it pertains to this case has not been\nchanged.” Id. at 677 n.4.\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                   37\n\ndefinition tracks BCRA’s in every respect, as each is\nlimited by the same five factors: (1) by medium,1 8 (2) by\ntotal amount spent,1 9 (3) temporally,2 0 (4) geographically,2 1\nand (5) by content.2 2 Although there are some dif-\nferences with the federal statute’s definition, which we\nconsider below in Section IV.C, the point is that Article 9\nis carefully drawn to track a definition already approved\nby the Supreme Court in Wisconsin Right to Life. Even\nif disclosure requirements could reach only so far as\nexpress advocacy or its functional equivalent, on its\nface, Article 9 regulates no more than that and so is not\nfacially overbroad.\n\n\n\n18\n  Compare 2 U.S.C. § 434(f)(3)(A) (“any broadcast, cable or\nsatellite communication”), with 10 ILCS 5/9-1.14(a) (“any\nbroadcast, cable, or satellite communication, including radio,\ntelevision, or Internet communication”).\n19\n Compare 2 U.S.C. § 434(f) ($10,000 triggers reporting require-\nments), with 10 ILCS 5/9-8.6 ($3,000 triggers reporting require-\nments).\n20\n  Compare 2 U.S.C. § 434(f)(3)(A)(i)(II) (appears within 60 days\nof a general election or 30 days of a primary), with 10 ILCS 5/9-\n1.14(a)(2) (same).\n21\n  Compare 2 U.S.C. § 434(f)(3)(A)(i)(III) ( “is targeted to the\nrelevant electorate” ), with 10 ILCS 5/9-1.14(a)(3) (same).\n22\n  Compare 2 U.S.C. § 434(f)(3)(A)(i)(I) (“refers to a clearly\nidentified candidate”), with 10 ILCS 5/9-1.14(a)(1) (“refers to a\nclearly identified candidate,” “political party,” or “question\nof public policy that will appear on the ballot”) (numbering\nomitted).\n\f38                                              No. 11-3693\n\n     3. Vagueness\n  The Center’s final concern about Article 9’s regulation\nof ballot initiative activity is that it is triggered by con-\ntributions or expenditures received or made “with\nthe purpose of securing a place on the ballot for, [or]\nadvocating the defeat or passage of” any ballot initiative,\n“regardless of whether petitions have been circulated\nor filed with the appropriate office or whether the\nquestion has been adopted and certified by the\ngoverning body.” 10 ILCS 5/9-1.8(e). The Center first\nargues that the “in support of or in opposition to”\nlanguage is vague. In McConnell, however, the Court\nfound that very similar language was not unconstitu-\ntionally vague. See 540 U.S. at 170 n.64 (“The words ‘pro-\nmote,’ ‘oppose,’ ‘attack,’ and ‘support’ clearly set forth\nthe confines within which potential party speakers\nmust act in order to avoid triggering the provision. These\nwords ‘provide explicit standards for those who apply\nthem’ and ‘give the person of ordinary intelligence a\nreasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited.’ ”),\nquoting Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108-09\n(1972). This part of McConnell remains valid after Citizens\nUnited, and it forecloses the Center’s argument that\nsubsection 1.8(e)’s support/opposition language is uncon-\nstitutionally vague. Accord, National Org. for Marriage,\n649 F.3d at 62-64 (rejecting vagueness challenge to\nterms “promoting,” “support,” and “opposition”).\n  The Center also contends that the definition is vague\nbecause it could apply to advocacy on any issue that\nmight one day become the subject of a ballot initiative,\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                   39\n\nand the statute “provides no guidance . . . for determining\nwhen such a policy issue becomes a regulated ‘question\nof public policy.’ ” For example, a group might spend\n$3,000 producing an ad that denounces high sales taxes,\nonly to find six months later that a sales tax cut will be\non the ballot as an initiative. The Center argues that\nunder Article 9, that group might be found to have\nviolated the statute if it failed to register as a ballot initia-\ntive committee and make required disclosures.\n  Courts do not decide facial challenges on the basis\nof such speculative hypotheticals. As the district court\nobserved, campaign-related broadcasts are considered\nelectioneering communications only when they are made\nwithin 60 days of a general election or 30 days of a pri-\nmary, “at which point it would already be known if an\ninitiative is on the ballot.” As for expenditures that are\nnot for electioneering communications (for example,\nglossy mailers, bumper stickers, buttons, and other cam-\npaign paraphernalia), Article 9’s definition of “ballot\ninitiative committee” is quite plainly aimed at regulating\ngroups that are either campaigning in favor of or\nagainst actual ballot measures or actively advocating or\nopposing placing a specific question on the ballot. We\nhave no reason to suppose the Board would construe or\nenforce the provision more expansively, so we cannot\nsay that the definition of ballot initiative committee is\nsubstantially overbroad in relation to its plainly legitimate\nsweep, see United States v. Stevens, 130 S. Ct. 1577, 1587\n(2010), or that its “deterrent effect on legitimate expres-\nsion is . . . both real and substantial.” Young v. American\nMini Theatres, Inc., 427 U.S. 50, 60 (1976). Illinois’s regula-\n\f40                                              No. 11-3693\n\ntion of expenditures for, contributions to, and electioneer-\ning communications about ballot initiative campaigns\nis not facially overbroad or vague.\n\n\n  B. Definition of Political Committee: The “Major Purpose”\n     Test\n  The Center argues that Illinois’s disclosure requirements\nare vague and overbroad because they regulate as\npolitical committees groups that do not have as their\n“major purpose” the election of a candidate. Recall that\noutside groups are required to register as political com-\nmittees if within a 12-month period they make or receive\nmore than $3,000 worth of contributions, expenditures,\nor independent expenditures for electioneering com-\nmunications. See 10 ILCS 5/9-1.8, 5/9-8.6(b). The Center\ncontends that Supreme Court precedent strictly cabins\nregulation of political committees to organizations that\nare “under the control of a candidate” or whose\n“major purpose” is “the nomination or election of a\ncandidate.” Article 9’s political committee provision\ncovers additional entities, and thus, the Center contends,\nthe provision is fatally overbroad. We disagree.\n  Like the express advocacy/issue discussion distinction,\nthe Center’s proposed major purpose test also has its\norigins in Buckley. The Buckley Court reviewed FECA’s\nreporting requirements on political committees, which\nthe statute defined as “any committee, club, association,\nor other group of persons which receives contributions\nor makes expenditures during a calendar year in an\naggregate amount exceeding $1,000.” Buckley, 424 U.S. at\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                41\n\n79 n.105, quoting 2 U.S.C. § 431(d) (current version at\n§ 431(4)(A)). A parallel provision of FECA defined “contri-\nbution” and “expenditure” as the “use of money or other\nvaluable assets ‘for the purpose of . . . influencing’ the\nnomination or election of candidates for federal office.” Id.\nat 77, quoting 2 U.S.C. § 431(e), (f) (current version at\n§ 431(8), (9)). In the context of this definition, the Court\nconcluded that the disclosure requirements could\npresent “vagueness problems, for ‘political committee’ is\ndefined only in terms of amount of annual ‘contributions’\nand ‘expenditures,’ and could be interpreted to reach\ngroups engaged purely in issue discussion.” Id. at 79. To\navoid these line-drawing problems, the Court construed\nthe term political committee more narrowly:\n    To fulfill the purposes of the Act, [political committees]\n    need only encompass organizations that are under\n    the control of a candidate or the major purpose of which\n    is the nomination or election of a candidate. Expendi-\n    tures of candidates and of “political committees” so\n    construed can be assumed to fall within the core\n    area sought to be addressed by Congress. They are,\n    by definition, campaign related.\nId. (emphasis added). The Court has referred to this\nnarrowing construction in subsequent opinions. See, e.g.,\nMcConnell, 540 U.S. at 170 n.64; FEC v. Massachusetts\nCitizens for Life, 479 U.S. 238, 252 n.6 (1986) (plurality\nopinion). The Center draws from this the conclusion\nthat the First Amendment imposes a bright-line prohibi-\ntion against applying disclosure requirements to a\ngroup whose “major purpose” is other than the nomina-\ntion or election of candidates.\n\f42                                                   No. 11-3693\n\n  The argument reads Buckley too broadly. First, as is\nclear from the quoted portion, the “major purpose”\nlimitation, like the express advocacy/issue discussion\ndistinction, was a creature of statutory interpretation,\nnot constitutional command. See National Org. for\nMarriage, 649 F.3d at 59 (“We find no reason to believe\nthat this so-called ‘major purpose’ test, like the other\nnarrowing constructions adopted in Buckley, is anything\nmore than an artifact of the Court’s construction of a\nfederal statute.”); Human Life, 624 F.3d at 1009-10\n(“Buckley’s statement . . . does not indicate that an entity\nmust have that major purpose to be deemed constitution-\nally a political committee.”).2 3 Buckley’s limiting construc-\ntion was drawn for the statute before it, and the\nSupreme Court has never applied a “major purpose” test\nto a state’s regulation of political committees. See National\nOrg. for Marriage, 649 F.3d at 59.\n\n\n23\n   See also Vermont Right to Life Committee, Inc. v.\nSorrell, ___ F. Supp. 2d ___, 2012 WL 2370445, at *15 (D. Vt. 2012)\n(upholding Vermont campaign finance disclosure laws and\nconcluding that the “major purpose limiting construction was\nthe product of a vague statute, not of the First Amendment”).\nBut see New Mexico Youth Organized v. Herrera, 611 F.3d 669, 677-\n78 (10th Cir. 2010) (invalidating state disclosure law as\napplied to organization because it did not “satisfy the ‘major\npurpose’ test,” which “sets the lower bounds for when regula-\ntion as a political committee is constitutionally permissible”);\nNorth Carolina Right to Life, Inc. v. Leake, 525 F.3d 274 (4th Cir.\n2008) (concluding before Citizens United that state disclosure\nlaw violated the First Amendment because “an entity must\nhave ‘the major purpose’ of supporting or opposing a can-\ndidate to be designated a political committee”).\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                   43\n\n   For four reasons, we do not think this limitation\nextends to Illinois’s disclosure requirements. First, when\nBuckley was decided, political committees faced much\ngreater burdens under FECA’s 1974 amendments than\nIllinois’s disclosure requirements impose. For instance,\nFECA then included hard limits on the size of contribu-\ntions to political committees, and on how much they\ncould contribute to other political committees. See\nBuckley, 424 U.S. at 35.2 4 When regulation as a political\ncommittee entails adherence to these and other more\nburdensome requirements, there is more room to argue\nthat the major purpose test might be needed under the\nFirst Amendment than when the law imposes only dis-\nclosure obligations. For instance, the Supreme Court\nin Massachusetts Citizens for Life held that a federal law\nprohibiting corporations from making independent\nexpenditures except through segregated funds was uncon-\nstitutional as applied to a nonprofit political advocacy\norganization, but the Court expressly acknowledged\nthat the organization could be required to comply with\nFECA’s disclosure regime. See 479 U.S. at 262 (“These\n\n\n\n24\n   In Illinois’s 2009 amendments to its campaign finance law,\nthe legislature imposed hard limits on the amount political\ncommittees could accept from any one individual, entity, or\nother political committee. 10 ILCS 5/9-8.5(d). These limits\nwent into effect in January 2011 but were invalidated as uncon-\nstitutional as applied to non-candidate, non-political party\n“political action committees.” See Personal PAC v. McGuffage, ___\nF. Supp. 2d __, 2012 WL 850744 (N.D. Ill. March 13, 2012).\nThe state did not appeal.\n\f44                                              No. 11-3693\n\nreporting obligations provide precisely the information\nnecessary to monitor MCFL’s independent spending\nactivity and its receipt of contributions. The state\ninterest in disclosure therefore can be met in a manner\nless restrictive than imposing the full panoply of regula-\ntions that accompany status as a political committee\nunder the Act.”). Massachusetts Citizens for Life shows\nthat there is nothing constitutionally magical about being\nlabeled as a political committee; what matters are the\nburdens that attend the classification.\n  Second, Article 9 defines political committee more\nnarrowly than FECA by covering only groups that accept\ncontributions or make expenditures “on behalf of or in\nopposition to” a candidate or ballot initiative. This defini-\ntion is more targeted to campaign-related speech than\nFECA’s definition of contribution and expenditure,\nwhich applies to anything of value given or received\n“for the purpose of . . . influencing” an election. 2 U.S.C.\n§ 431(8), (9). Again, in McConnell, the Court held that\nsimilar language (words such as “’promote,’ ‘oppose,’\n‘attack,’ and ‘support’ ”) “provide[d] explicit standards”\nand was not vague. See 540 U.S. at 170 n.64. The Illinois\nlimit of “on behalf of or in opposition to” confines\nthe realm of regulated activity to expenditures and con-\ntributions within the core area of genuinely campaign-\nrelated transactions.\n  Third, as the First Circuit noted in upholding Maine’s\ncampaign finance disclosure law, application of the major\npurpose test would “yield perverse results.” “[A] small\ngroup with the major purpose of electing a . . . state\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                   45\n\nrepresentative that spends [$3,000] for ads could be\nrequired to register” as a political committee, while a\n“mega-group that spends $1,500,000 to defeat the same\ncandidate,” but spends far more on non-campaign-\nrelated activities, “would not have to register because\nthe defeat of that candidate could not be considered the\n[mega-group’s] major purpose.” National Org. for Marriage,\n649 F.3d at 59, quoting National Org. for Marriage v. McKee,\n723 F. Supp. 2d at 264; see also Vermont Right to Life Com-\nmittee, ___ F. Supp. 2d at __, 2012 WL 2370445, at *16\n(noting the “peculiar results” the major purpose test\nwould produce inasmuch as “a group that spends $1.5 MM\nof a total of $6 MM on promoting candidates probably\nwould not qualify, but one that spends $1500 of a total\nbudget of $2000 probably would”).\n  Fourth, limiting disclosure requirements to groups\nwith the major purpose of influencing elections would\nallow even those very groups to circumvent the law with\nease. Any organization dedicated primarily to electing\ncandidates or promoting ballot measures could easily\ndilute that major purpose by just increasing its non-\nelectioneering activities or better yet by merging\nwith a sympathetic organization that engaged in\nactivities unrelated to campaigning.2 5 It is easy to imagine\n\n\n25\n  See Human Life, 624 F.3d at 1012; North Carolina Right to Life,\n525 F.3d at 332 (Michael, J., dissenting) (warning that major-\npurpose standard “effectively encourages advocacy groups\nto circumvent the law by not creating political action\ncommittees and instead to hide their electoral advocacy from\n                                                   (continued...)\n\f46                                                  No. 11-3693\n\nhow implementing the kind of major-purpose test the\nCenter advances could devolve into an administrative\nnightmare. The First Amendment does not require a\nstate to build such an escape hatch into reasonable disclo-\nsure laws.26 The Supreme Court has frequently warned\nof the “hard lesson of circumvention” in campaign\nfinance regulation. McConnell, 540 U.S. at 165; see also\nCitizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 912; Buckley, 424 U.S. at 62. In\npolitical campaigns, it seems, “[m]oney, like water, will\nalways find an outlet.” McConnell, 540 U.S. at 224; see\ngenerally Samuel Issacharoff & Pamela S.

See Dan Eggen, Behind the Ads, Faceless\n                                                    (continued...)\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                      47\n\n\n\n27\n   (...continued)\nDonors, W ASH . P OST , Apr. 26, 2012, at A1. By one account, in the\n2010 elections less than 10% of the $75 million outside groups\nspent on electioneering communications came from entities\nthat disclosed their donors. See 2010 Outside Spending,\nby Groups, Center for Responsive Politics, http://www.\nopensecrets.org/outsidespending/summ.php?disp=O (last vis-\nited Aug. 29, 2012). And already this year, groups that do not\ndisclose their donors have spent $172 million on television,\nradio, and Internet advertising.

The reason for this blind spot is that\nFEC regulations require corporations and labor organizations\nmaking electioneering communications to report the identities\nof donors giving at least $1,000 only when the donation “was\nmade for the purpose of furthering electioneering communica-\ntions.” 11 C.F.R. § 104.20(c)(9) (emphasis added). While any\nperson or entity spending at least $10,000 on electioneering\ncommunications must disclose their spending, unions and\ncorporations need not disclose who has contributed to pay for\nthese ads, “unless the donor is dumb enough specifically to\ndirect the organization to use the money for a particular ad.”\nRichard L. Hasen, Show Me the Donors: What’s the Point of\nCampaign Finance Disclosure?

Instead, as the\nSupreme Court has instructed in applying exacting scru-\ntiny, our inquiry depends on whether there is a sub-\nstantial relation between Illinois’s interest in informing\nits electorate about who is speaking before an election\nand Article 9’s regulation of campaign-related spending\nby groups whose major purpose is not electoral politics.\nWe find that there is.\n  In Illinois, the voting “public has an interest in\nknowing who is speaking about a candidate shortly\nbefore an election,” Citizens United, 130 S.

The need for an effective and\ncomprehensive disclosure system is especially valuable\nafter Citizens United, since individuals and outside\nbusiness entities may engage in unlimited political ad-\nvertising so long as they do not coordinate tactics with\na political campaign or political party. See Citizens\nUnited, 130 S. Ct. at 916 (“A campaign finance system\nthat pairs corporate independent expenditures with\neffective disclosure has not existed before today. . . .

Transparency in campaign finance\nallows the public to weigh the “credib[ility]” of the\nspeaker and thus the “persuas[iveness]” of the message,\nand that is so “generally whatever the question is,” Aris-\ntotle, Rhetoric, in 2 The Complete Works of Aristotle 2152,\n\n\n\n28\n  See Outside Spending, Center for Responsive Politics,\nhttp://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/index.php (last\nvisited Aug. 29, 2012).\n\f50                                                 No. 11-3693\n\n2155 (Jonathan Barnes ed. 1984)., quoted in Majors v.\nAbell, 361 F.3d 349, 352 (7th Cir. 2004) (upholding state\nstatute requiring political ads to identify sponsors).\nSuch transparency helps the public hold political\nspeakers accountable for making false, manipulative, or\notherwise unseemly ads that they might otherwise run\nwith impunity. As Justice Brandeis observed, “Sunlight\nis said to be the best of disinfectants; electric light the\nmost efficient policeman.” Louis Brandeis, Other People’s\nMoney 62 (1933), quoted in Buckley, 424 U.S. at 67.\n  We conclude that Article 9’s regulation as political\ncommittees of groups that lack the major purpose of\ninfluencing elections does not condemn the disclosure\nlaw as unconstitutionally overbroad.\n\n\n  C. “Electioneering Communication”\n  In addition to its two major substantive challenges to\nArticle 9, the Center asserts that several other provi-\nsions are facially vague and overbroad. The first is the\ndefinition of “electioneering communication,” which\napplies to expenditures and contributions to determine\nwhether an entity is a regulated political committee\nthat must disclose its finances and donors. Illinois defines\n“electioneering communication” as:\n     any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication,\n     including radio, television, or Internet communication,\n     that (1) refers to a clearly identified candidate . . .,\n     clearly identified political party, or a clearly identified\n     question of public policy that will appear on the\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                   51\n\n   ballot, (2) is made within 60 days before a general\n   election . . . or 30 days before a primary election, (3) is\n   targeted to the relevant electorate, and (4) is suscepti-\n   ble to no reasonable interpretation other than as an\n   appeal to vote for or against a clearly identified candi-\n   date . . ., a political party, or a question of public\n   policy.\n10 ILCS 5/9-1.14 (some internal numbering omitted). This\ndefinition is taken almost verbatim from the federal\ndefinition that was upheld (to the extent it triggered\ndisclosure requirements) in Citizens United. Federal law\ndefines “electioneering communication” as:\n   any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication\n   which —\n       (I) refers to a clearly identified candidate for Fed-\n       eral office;\n       (II) is made within —\n              (aa) 60 days before a general . . . election candi-\n              date; or\n              (bb) 30 days before a primary . . . election . . .;\n              and\n       (III) . . . is targeted to the relevant electorate.\n       ...\n       . . . [A] communication which refers to a clearly\n       identified candidate for Federal office is “targeted\n       to the relevant electorate” if the communication\n       can be received by 50,000 or more persons —\n\f52                                                No. 11-3693\n\n        . . . in the district [or state] the candidate seeks to\n        represent . . . .\n2 U.S.C.A. § 434(f)(3)(A)-(C).\n  The Center maintains that Article 9’s definition of\n“electioneering communication” is vague and overbroad.\nThe Supreme Court has already found the federal defini-\ntion to be neither overbroad nor vague in the context of\ndisclosure requirements, see, e.g., Citizens United, 130\nS. Ct. at 916, so in assessing Article 9 we focus on the\nways in which the Illinois statute is broader or less\nprecise than the federal one and then inquire whether\neach difference is constitutionally permissible.\n  There are three differences between the federal and\nArticle 9 definitions of “electioneering communications.”\nFirst, the Illinois statute covers communications related\nto ballot measure campaigns. We determined above\nthat this element of Article 9 does not render the\nstatute vague or overbroad, see parts IV.A.2 & .3, and do\nnot repeat our analysis here. Second, Article 9 covers\n“Internet speech,” which is not regulated by the\nfederal statute. Third, Illinois does not limit the phrase\n“targeted to the relevant electorate” by reference to\nminimum audience size. We now address these last\ntwo differences.\n\n\n      1. Internet Communications\n  The Center contends that Article 9’s regulation of\ncertain Internet speech as electioneering communica-\ntions renders it unconstitutionally broad because\n\fNo. 11-3693                                             53\n\nInternet speech, in contrast to radio and television broad-\ncasts, is not confined to particular audience markets or\nmoments in time. Without firm temporal or geographic\nlimitations, the Center argues, Article 9 potentially\nsweeps in an untold amount of online speech that has\nnothing to do with Illinois elections. The Center notes\nthat “many Internet communications” — for example,\npostings on the Center’s website, emails to the Center’s\nmembership distribution lists, or messages through\nsocial networking sites — “are equally accessible from\nalmost anywhere in the world” and may even persist\nforever in cyber-space through the use of a so-called “Way-\nBack Machine” that stores web sites even after they\nhave been removed by their creators or sponsors. The\nconsequence, it suggests, is that “politically-oriented\nwebsites around the world must review their content\nbefore each Illinois election to identify and remove any\nprior posting referring to someone who now is an Illinois\ncandidate or something that now is an Illinois ballot\nquestion.” Keeping in mind that this is a facial chal-\nlenge, we are not persuaded that this prospect\ninvalidates the entire law.\n   First, requiring disclosure of genuinely campaign-\nrelated Internet communications undoubtedly advances\nIllinois’s important interest in informing its voters\nabout who is speaking before an election. In recent years,\na large and growing proportion of electioneering has\nbeen occurring online. In 2008, for the first time, “more\nthan half the voting-age population used the internet\nto connect to the political process during an election\n\f54                                                  No. 11-3693\n\ncycle.” 2 9 That portion is almost certainly higher today. By\none estimate, the two major parties’ presidential cam-\npaigns will spend $159 million more on web ads in\n2012 than in 2008 — a sevenfold increase. 3 0 Thanks to\nadvanced Internet marketing strategies, campaigns and\nother political actors have now “acquired the technical\ncapacity to target Web ads with the precision of mail or\na door-to-door canvass.” 3 1 Campaigns, parties, and advo-\ncacy groups have increasingly turned to the Internet to\nreach the electorate with campaign messages, and\nIllinois voters have just as much a stake in knowing who\nis behind such messages as when they are broadcast\nin traditional media.\n  On the other hand, we agree with the Center that\nthe potential reach of Illinois’s disclosure law could be\nproblematic if distant speakers were actually subject to\nregulation because their Internet postings inadvertently\n\n\n\n29\n  Aaron Smith, The Internet’s Role in Campaign 2008 3 (Pew\nInternet & Amer. Life Project, Apr. 2009), available at\nhttp://pewresearch.org/pubs/1192/internet-politics-campaign-\n2008.\n30\n  See Obama Outspends Romney on Online Ads, CNN\n(June 3, 2012), http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/\n03/politics/online-campaign-spending/index.html.\n\n\n31\n  Sasha Issenberg, The Creepiness Factor, S LATE (Apr. 26, 2012),\nhttp://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/victory_lab/\n2012/04/web_based_political_ads_why_they_scare_the_obama_\nand_romney_campaigns.html.\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                  55\n\nor obliquely coincided with the subjects of Illinois ballot\nmeasures. The state’s interest in informing its voters of\nthe identities, financial outlays, and funding sources of\nsuch marginal political messengers does not rise to\nthe importance the First Amendment demands. Yet the\nCenter has identified no case in which the State\nElection Board has asked out-of-state speakers to\nregister as political committees for disseminating emails,\ntweets, zombie web pages, or any other Internet com-\nmunications that merely mentioned Illinois candidates\nor discussed issues related to Illinois ballot measures.\nNor could the Board legally do so, for under Article 9\nInternet ads count as electioneering communications\nonly when they are both “targeted to the relevant\n[Illinois] electorate” and “susceptible to no reasonable\ninterpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or\nagainst a clearly identified candidate . . ., a political party,\nor a question of public policy.” 10 ILCS 5/9-1.14. The\nCenter’s notion that the Board might consider an out-of-\nstate advocacy group’s web ad generally endorsing\nlow taxes to be an unambiguous appeal to vote for a\n“ballot question to balance the Illinois budget” sounds far-\nfetched.\n   With no evidence that the Board would actually\nconstrue Article 9 in this surprising way, such remote,\nhypothetical applications do not justify invalidating\nIllinois’s disclosure provisions for facial overbreadth.\nSee Washington State Grange v. Wash. State Republican\nParty, 552 U.S. 442, 450 (2008) (“[W]e must be careful not\nto go beyond the statute’s facial requirements and specu-\nlate about ‘hypothetical’ or ‘imaginary’ cases.”), quoting\n\f56                                               No. 11-3693\n\nUnited States v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17, 22 (1960); see also\nRobert Bork, The Tempting of America 169 (1990) (“Judges\nand lawyers live on the slippery slope of analogies;\nthey are not supposed to ski it to the bottom.”). For a facial\nchallenge to prevail, a statute’s overbreadth must be\n“substantial, not only in an absolute sense, but also\nrelative to the statute’s plainly legitimate sweep.” United\nStates v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 292 (2008). Cf. Yazoo &\nMississippi Valley R.R. Co. v. Jackson Vinegar Co., 226\nU.S. 217, 220 (1912) (“How the state court may apply\n[a statute] to other cases, whether its general words may\nbe treated as more or less restrained, and how far parts\nof it may be sustained if others fail are matters upon\nwhich we need not speculate now.”). Neither the Board\nnor Illinois courts have had “occasion to construe the\nlaw in the context of actual disputes arising from the\nelectoral context, or to accord the law a limiting construc-\ntion to avoid constitutional questions.” Washington State\nGrange, 552 U.S. at 450. It would be premature for this\ncourt to presume that the Board would disregard the\nobvious limits of the statutory text and seek to\napply Article 9 in such a sweeping fashion.\n   The Center complains that it is too difficult to know\nwhen an “electioneering communication” is “made” on the\nInternet. Timing is important because of the duties that\napply during the 30-day and 60-day windows before\nelections. See 10 ILCS 5/9-1.14(a). The district court and\nthe defendants assert that a communication is “made”\non a website both when it is first posted and while\nit remains available on the website. That is a sensible\nreading, just as a physical billboard is considered a com-\n\fNo. 11-3693                                               57\n\nmunication made by the advertiser as long as it is dis-\nplayed. The Center wonders if it would still be\nresponsible for later communications (within the 30-\nday and 60-day windows) if others copy its ads and\npost them on other websites. If that happens, the Center\nwould not be “making” those later communications\nand would not be responsible for them.\n   We do not anticipate that Article 9 will restrict or chill\na substantial amount of protected speech because\nit treats certain Internet speech as electioneering com-\nmunications. On its face, this element of the statute\nis neither vague nor overbroad.\n\n\n    2. Targeted to the Relevant Electorate\n  Article 9 does not numerically define “target[ing]\nthe relevant electorate” as does FECA, which requires\nthat the communication be capable of being “received by\n50,000 or more persons.” 2 U.S.C. § 434(f)(3)(C). Illinois\nhas good reasons for omitting a number. Its elections\ninvolve much smaller electorates, and it does not have\nan agency like the Federal Communications Commission\nthat would let it monitor how large an audience a\ngiven broadcast reaches. This difference does not\ndefeat Illinois’s substantial interest in informing its elec-\ntorate for the purposes of this facial challenge. In ad-\njudicating facial challenges, federal courts do not\nassume that state officials will construe state law in the\nmost expansive way imaginable. On the contrary, it “is\nreasonable to assume . . . that a state court presented with\na state statute . . . will attempt to construe the statute\n\f58                                                No. 11-3693\n\nconsistently with constitutional requirements.” City of\nAkron v. Akron Ctr. for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U.S.\n416, 441 (1983), overruled in part on other grounds by\nPlanned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 881-83 (1992)\n(as stated in plurality opinion). We agree with the state\nthat a “reasonable, and constitutional construction of\n‘targeted to the relevant electorate’ means a broadcast\ncommunication receivable within the geographical area\nwhere potential voters on that candidate or issue live.” The\nabsence of a numeric baseline does not condemn\nthe phrase “targeted to the relevant” as facially invalid.\nArticle 9’s definition of “electioneering communications”\nis not facially vague or overbroad.\n\n\n  D. Contribution and Expenditure\n  Article 9 defines “contribution” as a “gift . . . or anything\nof value, knowingly received in connection with the\nnomination for election, election, or retention of any\ncandidate or person to or in public office or in connec-\ntion with any question of public policy.” 10 ILCS 5/9-\n1.4(A)(1). “Expenditure” means “gift of money, or\nanything of value, [made] in connection with the nomina-\ntion for election, election, or retention of any person to\nor in public office or in connection with any question\nof public policy.” 10 ILCS 5/9-1.5(A)(1). The “transfer\nof funds by a political committee to another political\ncommittee” automatically qualifies as a contribution (for\nthe transferee) and an expenditure (for the transferor).\n10 ILCS 5/9-1.5(A)(3), 5/9-1.4(A)(3). An expenditure “made\nin cooperation, consultation, or concert with another\n\fNo. 11-3693                                              59\n\npolitical committee” is considered a contribution to that\ncommittee. 10 ILCS 5/9-1.4(A)(5). The Center challenges\nthree aspects of these definitions as unconstitutionally\nvague.\n\n\n    1. In Connection With, Supporting, or Opposing\n  First, the Center argues that the requirement that a\ncontribution or expenditure be “in connection with” an\nelection or ballot initiative is “so vague and broad as to\nprovide no meaningful guidance.” By itself, the “in con-\nnection with” language would be of little help. But as\nthe district court correctly observed, the scope of the\n“contribution” and “expenditure” definitions is further\nlimited by the narrower definition of “political commit-\ntee,” which applies only to contributions or expendi-\ntures that are made “on behalf of or in opposition to a\ncandidate” (for political action committees) or made “with\nthe purpose of securing a place on the ballot for [or]\nadvocating the defeat or passage of . . . the question of\npublic policy” (for ballot initiative committees). 10 ILCS\n5/9-1.8(d), (e). The only regulatory consequence of a\ntransaction qualifying as a contribution or expenditure\nis when it triggers registration requirements for political\ncommittees, so the more circumscribed language in\nthat latter provision is what matters for the vagueness\nanalysis. Following McConnell, we concluded above that\nthe “in support of or opposition” language in the\ndefinition of “ballot initiative committee” is clear enough.\nSee part IV.A.3. The same goes for the “on behalf of or\nin opposition to a candidate” language in the definition\n\f60                                             No. 11-3693\n\nof “political action committee.” All of these definitions\n“give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable\nopportunity to know what is prohibited.” Grayned, 408\nU.S. at 108.\n\n\n     2.   Transfer of Funds from One Political Committee\n          to Another\n  Next, the Center attacks Article 9’s treatment of any\n“transfer of funds by a political committee to another\npolitical committee” as a contribution or expenditure.\nThe Center claims this provision may apply to transfers\nwith groups that qualify as political committees under\nthe statute but have not yet registered, so it requires\npeople “to judge whether a source or recipient of funds\nmay later be judged to have made a $3,000 contribution,\nexpenditure, or otherwise became a political committee.”\nThus, the Center fears, it “could find itself classified as\nan Illinois political committee depending on how regula-\ntors later assess some other group’s speech or other\nactivities that [the Center] could not have known\nabout.” This result seems highly unlikely because it over-\nlooks an important aspect of the transfer of funds provi-\nsions. A transfer counts as a contribution and expendi-\nture only if it is already between two entities that each\nqualify as political committees. See 10 ILCS 5/9-1.4(A)3\nand -1.5(A)(3). That makes sense only if they each\nalready qualify as political committees independent of the\nparticular transfer. The transfer to or from some other\nentity that is a political committee would not make the\nother entity a political committee. (Otherwise, for\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                61\n\nexample, a contractor who produced an ad attacking a\ncandidate for a political committee would itself be trans-\nformed into a political committee.) The mere possibility\nthat the Board might enforce the statute in such an\nunfair way as the Center says it fears is a good example\nof the sort of “hypothetical or imaginary” situation with\nwhich courts do not concern themselves in facial chal-\nlenges. Washington State Grange, 552 U.S. at 450. If the\nBoard sought to enforce Article 9 as the Center says it\nfears, that might well provide a strong basis for an as-\napplied challenge.\n\n\n    3. Coordinated Expenditures\n  Finally, the statute treats as a contribution any “election-\neering communication made in concert or cooperation with\nor at the request, suggestion, or knowledge of a candidate,\na political committee, or any of their agents.” 10 ILCS 5/9-\n1.4(A)(1.5) (emphases added). The Center contends that\nthe italicized words are vague because they do not\nspecify the “degree of actual agreement required.” Since\nbefore Buckley, however, FECA has provided that “ex-\npenditures made by any person in cooperation, consulta-\ntion, or concert, with, or at the request or suggestion of,\na candidate, his authorized political committees, or\ntheir agents, shall be considered to be a contribution to\nsuch candidate.” 2 U.S.C. § 441a(a)(7)(B)(i); see Buckley,\n424 U.S. at 46. With the exception of the word, “knowl-\nedge,” Article 9’s definition of coordination is no less\nclear than the federal definition, which has long passed\nmuster in the Supreme Court. See, e.g., McConnell, 540\n\f62                                              No. 11-3693\n\nU.S. at 219-23. We therefore reject the Center’s argu-\nment that the terms, “in concert or cooperation with,”\n“request,” and “suggestion,” are unconstitutionally vague.\n  As for the word “knowledge,” we agree with the Center\nthat standing alone, it would sweep in a wide range\nof expenditures as coordinated expenditures (and thus\nas indirect contributions to campaign committees). For\ninstance, if a candidate learned that an outside group\nhad produced a favorable TV ad, would the candidate\nhave “knowledge” that the electioneering communica-\ntion was made? This would not be enough to say that\nthe ad was coordinated with the campaign. Recognizing\nthis problem, the district court adopted the limiting\nconstruction that “affirmative acquiescence is required,\nnot mere after the fact knowledge that the advocacy\nhas occurred.” Although we are somewhat puzzled by\nthe phrase “affirmative acquiescence,” we think the\nmain thrust of this limiting construction is sound. Under\nthe canon of noscitur a sociis, the fact that “several items\nin a list share an attribute counsels in favor of inter-\npreting the other items as possessing that attribute as\nwell.” Beecham v. United States, 511 U.S. 368, 371 (1994).\nThus, the Illinois legislature’s placement of “knowledge”\nin a series after “request” and “suggestion” indicates\nthat we should interpret the last, more general word, to\nbe similar to its more specific neighbors. 3 2 Both “request”\n\n\n\n32\n  This construction is especially appropriate given that the\n“knowledge” requirement is omitted from an otherwise\n                                               (continued...)\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                       63\n\nand “suggest” necessarily imply actual prior communica-\ntion between the purchaser of the electioneering com-\nmunication and the candidate, committee, or an agent\nthereof. The use of the term “knowledge” is clearly in-\ntended to ensure that coordination cannot be achieved\nby a proverbial “wink and nod,” such as where the sup-\nposedly independent group gives a candidate’s cam-\npaign advance, secret notice of its planned advertising\ncampaign to attack the opponent in a particular way,\nbut without actually drawing an explicit response from\nthe candidate’s campaign.3 3\n  In the context of “request” and “suggest,” the word\n“knowledge” may fairly be construed as requiring\nadvance and non-public communication with the candi-\n\n\n\n(...continued)\nparallel provision of Article 9 defining “independent expendi-\nture.” See 10 ILCS 5/9-1.15 (defining “independent expendi-\nture” as an expenditure for electioneering communication\n“that is not made in connection, consultation, or concert with\nor at the request or suggestion of the public official or\ncandidate, . . ., political committee, . . . campaign, . . . or [any]\nagent [thereof]”).\n33\n   For example, the FEC’s regulations on coordinated expendi-\ntures state that the definition “is not satisfied if the infor-\nmation material to the creation, production, or distribu-\ntion of the communication was obtained from a publicly\navailable source,” but that “[a]greement or formal col-\nlaboration between the person paying for the communica-\ntion and the candidate . . . is not required.” 11 C.F.R.\n§ 109.21(d)(2), (e).\n\f64                                                  No. 11-3693\n\ndate or entity on whose behalf the electioneering com-\nmunication is supposedly made. Where an otherwise\nambiguous provision is readily susceptible to a limiting\nconstruction that cures the vagueness concerns, we\nshould adopt it. See Buckley, 424 U.S. at 77-78 (“Where\nthe constitutional requirement of definiteness is at\nstake, we have the further obligation to construe\nthe statute, if that can be done consistent with the legisla-\nture’s purpose, to avoid the shoals of vagueness.”). Ac-\ncordingly, we interpret “knowledge” in light of its\nadjacent terms and conclude that the coordination lan-\nguage of Article 9 is clear enough to provide a rea-\nsonably intelligent person “fair warning” of what sort\nof conduct is covered. See Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108.\n\n\n     E. Independent Expenditures\n  An “independent expenditure” is an expenditure for\nan electioneering communication or any form of express\nadvocacy that is not coordinated with a candidate\nor a campaign.34 Unlike coordinated expenditures, an\n\n\n\n34\n   Article 9 defines “independent expenditure” as “any payment,\ngift, donation, or expenditure of funds (i) by a natural person\nor political committee for the purpose of making elec-\ntioneering communications or of expressly advocating for or\nagainst the nomination for election, election, retention, or\ndefeat of a clearly identifiable public official or candidate or\nfor or against any question of public policy to be submitted to\nthe voters and (ii) that is not made in connection, consultation,\n                                                   (continued...)\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                    65\n\n“independent expenditure is not considered a contribu-\ntion to a political committee.” 10 ILCS 5/9-8.6(a). When,\nhowever, in a 12-month period a person or organization\nmakes more than $3,000 worth of independent expendi-\ntures “supporting or opposing a public official or candi-\ndate,” 10 ILCS 5/9-8.6, this triggers Article 9’s disclosure\nrequirements.35 The Center contends that the phrase\n“supporting or opposing a public official or candidate” is\nimpermissibly vague because the “supporting or op-\nposing” language is unclear, and because the provision\nappears to apply to advocacy for or against public\nofficials who are not candidates.\n\n\n\n(...continued)\nor concert with or at the request or suggestion of the public\nofficial or candidate, the public official’s or candidate’s desig-\nnated political committee or campaign, or the agent or agents\nof the public official, candidate, or political committee or\ncampaign.” 10 ILCS 5/9-1.15.\n35\n   After exceeding the threshold, any natural person making\nsuch independent expenditures “must file a written disclosure\nwith the State Board of Elections within 2 business days . . .\nidentify[ing] the natural person, the public official or candidate\nsupported or opposed, the date, amount, and nature of each\nindependent expenditure, and the natural person’s occupa-\ntion and employer.” 10 ILCS 5/9-8.6(a). “Any entity other than\na natural person that makes expenditures of any kind in an\naggregate amount exceeding $3,000 during any 12-month\nperiod supporting or opposing a public official or candidate\nmust organize as a political committee” and “report all\nsuch independent expenditures as required under” Article 9.\n10 ILCS 5/9-8.6(b), (c).\n\f66                                                No. 11-3693\n\n  First, the “supporting or opposing” language has no\neffect on the scope or substance of these independent\nexpenditure reporting requirements. Not just any unco-\nordinated campaign-related expenditure is an “independ-\nent expenditure” — only those made either (1) for “elec-\ntioneering communications” or (2) for “expressly ad-\nvocating for or against the . . . election . . . or defeat of a\nclearly identifiable public official or candidate.” 10 ILCS\n5/9-1.15. Recall that a broadcast counts as an elec-\ntioneering communication only if it “refers to a clearly\nidentified candidate” and is “susceptible to no reasonable\ninterpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or\nagainst” that candidate. 10 ILCS 5/9-1.14(a). This\nstandard — as well as the standard for express advocacy —\nis much more demanding than the requirement that ex-\npenditures merely be “supporting or opposing a public\nofficial or candidate.” When the multiple statutory terms\nand definitions are assembled, then, the “supporting or\nopposing” language is redundant and does not render\nthe definition of “independent expenditure” unconstitu-\ntionally vague or overbroad. See Human Life, 624 F.3d at\n1021 (“otherwise imprecise terms may avoid vagueness\nproblems when used in combination with terms that\nprovide sufficient clarity”), quoting Gammoh v. City of\nLa Habra, 395 F.3d 1114, 1120 (9th Cir. 2005).\n  As for the phrase “public official,” we agree with the\nCenter that a strictly literal interpretation of the provi-\nsion would include independent expenditures made for\n“expressly advocating for or against the . . . election\nor defeat of a clearly identifiable public official” who is\nnot currently a candidate, but who may run for re-election\n\fNo. 11-3693                                               67\n\nin some future year.3 6 It is clear, however, from both\nthe text of this section and Article 9 as a whole, which\nrepeatedly refers to incumbent candidates as “public\nofficials,” that the legislature intended the phrase “public\nofficial” in section 9-8.6 to mean a public official who\nis also a candidate. That is the limiting construction\nthe district court adopted, and it is a sound one. So nar-\nrowed, the provision of Article 9 imposing disclosure\nrequirements for “independent expenditures” is not\nvague or overly broad.\n\n\n                         Conclusion\n  “Whatever differences may exist about interpretations\nof the First Amendment, there is practically universal\nagreement that a major purpose of that Amendment was\nto protect the free discussion of governmental affairs.\nThis of course includes discussions of candidates, . . . and\nall such matters relating to political processes.” Mills v.\nAlabama, 384 U.S. 214, 218-19 (1966). The First Amend-\nment helps to ensure that our “constitutionally protected\n‘discussion of governmental affairs’ is an informed one.”\nGlobe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court, 457 U.S. 596, 605\n(1982), quoting Mills, 384 U.S. at 218. Campaign finance\ndisclosure requirements can advance the democratic\n\n\n36\n  It could not apply to expenditures made for “electioneering\ncommunications,” of course, because these require reference\nto a “clearly identified candidate” and an unambiguous\n“appeal to vote” for or against that candidate. 10 ILCS 5/9-\n1.14(a) (emphasis added).\n\f68                                              No. 11-3693\n\nvirtues in informed and transparent public discourse\nwithout impairing other First Amendment values.\n   Although “disclosure is a less restrictive alternative\nto more comprehensive regulations of speech,” Citizens\nUnited, 130 S. Ct. at 915, we are not unmindful of the\ncosts it may generate in foregone speech from those\nwho wish to remain anonymous, in the loss of privacy,\nand from social friction. See, e.g., McIntyre v. Ohio\nElections Comm’n, 514 U.S. 334 (1995) (striking down\nstate law requiring identification of authorship on all\ncampaign-related publications as applied to distribution\nof unsigned leaflets by individual pamphleteer); see\ngenerally Symposium, Privacy, Democracy, and Elections,\n19 Wm. & Mary Bill Rights J. 857 (2011). We also take\nthe Center at its word that its donors are so adamant\nabout remaining anonymous that subjecting it to the\nIllinois reporting requirements will deter it from\nengaging in its preferred form of public advocacy. That\nis regrettable, but it is the Center’s and its donors’ choice\nto make. As Justice Scalia has written, participation in\nthe political process takes “civic courage, without which\ndemocracy is doomed.” Doe v. Reed, 130 S. Ct. at 2837\n(Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment). While there is\nalso a “respected tradition of anonymity in the advocacy\nof political causes” in this country, see McIntyre, 514\nU.S. at 343, that tradition does not mean voters must\nremain in the dark about “who is speaking about a candi-\ndate shortly before an election.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct.\nat 915. Campaign finance disclosure laws must strike a\nbalance between protecting individual speakers from\ninvasions of privacy and harassment on the one hand,\n\fNo. 11-3693                                              69\n\nand enabling transparency and accountability in political\ncampaigns on the other. Illinois’s laws do so sufficiently\nto survive this facial challenge.\n  The judgment of the district court is A FFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n  P OSNER, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting\nin part. I agree with much in the majority opinion,\nbut several provisions of the Illinois statute seem to me\nto burden the plaintiff’s freedom of speech unduly;\nwe should invalidate them.\n  The Center for Individual Freedom is a nonprofit organi-\nzation engaged in public advocacy. It makes advertise-\nments and disseminates them in television, print, online,\nand other media; it maintains a website; and it produces\na radio show. It conducts some of its activities during\nelection campaigns, often commending to the electorate\ncandidates whom it thinks likely if elected to support\nthe policies it advocates. But it is not affiliated with and\ndoes not coordinate its activities with any candidate,\ncampaign, or political party and is thus an “independent”\nadvocacy group within the meaning of Citizens United\nv. Federal Election Commission, 130 S. Ct. 876, 910 (2010),\nand Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 45-47 and n. 53 (1976)\n(per curiam). It therefore is not subject to all the reg-\n\f70                                               No. 11-3693\n\nulations that states are allowed to impose on political\ncommittees that are affiliated with candidates, campaigns,\nor parties. A state is permitted, however, to compel\npublic disclosure of election-related activities of indep-\nendent groups, on the theory that such disclosure\nhelps the electorate evaluate candidates for public office,\nid. at 66, 81, though a state may not limit donations to\nan independent advocacy organization or the expendi-\ntures that such an organization can make, or ban its\nspeech. See SpeechNow.org v. Federal Election Commission,\n599 F.3d 686, 694-96 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (en banc).\n  Illinois regulates what it calls “political committees,” and\nthe term includes not only partisan committees but\nalso any independent organization or individual that\n“accepts contributions or makes expenditures during\nany 12-month period in an aggregate amount ex-\nceeding $3000 on behalf of or in opposition to a candidate\nor candidates for public office” or “in support of or in\nopposition to any question of public policy to be\nsubmitted to the electors,” or that “makes electioneering\ncommunications,” exceeding the monetary threshold,\nthat are “related to” a candidate or to a question of\npublic policy. 10 ILCS 5/9-1.8(d), (e). A “contribution” is\namong other things “anything of value that constitutes\nan electioneering communication made in concert or\ncooperation with or at the request, suggestion, or knowl-\nedge of a candidate, a political committee, or any of their\nagents,” or “a transfer of funds received by a political\ncommittee from another political committee.” 10 ILCS 5/9-\n1.4(A)(1.5), (3). An “expenditure” is anything of\nvalue given “in connection with the nomination for\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                71\n\nelection, election, or retention of any person to or in\npublic office,” 10 ILCS 5/9-1.5(A)(1), or “that constitutes\nan electioneering communication made in concert or\ncooperation with or at the request, suggestion, or knowl-\nedge of a candidate, a political committee, or any of\ntheir agents.” 10 ILCS 5/9-1.5(A)(2). And finally an “elec-\ntioneering communication” is any broadcast, cable,\nsatellite, or Internet communication that refers to a\n“clearly identified candidate,” “clearly identified\npolitical party,” or “clearly identified question of public\npolicy that will appear on the ballot,” provided that\nthe communication is made within 60 days before a\ngeneral election or 30 days before a primary election,\nis “targeted to the relevant electorate,” and “is sus-\nceptible to no reasonable interpretation other than as an\nappeal to vote for or against a clearly identified candi-\ndate…or a question of public policy.” 10 ILCS 5/9-1.14(a).\n  A political committee must register with the Illinois\nBoard of Elections, 10 ILCS 5/9-3(a), and file quarterly\nreports that open its finances to public scrutiny. For each\nreport must reveal “all financial activity,” as the state\nwebsite puts it (Illinois State Board of Elections, “Political\nCommittee Report Filing Forms,” http://elections.il.gov/\nCampaignDisclosure/PoliticalCommittee.aspx (visited\nAug. 23, 2012)), in the previous quarter—must reveal\nthe total contributions it received, along with all other\nreceipts, and the total expenditures it made, including\ninvestments and loans; along with the names, addresses,\nand other identifying details of donors, and of recipients\nof the committee’s expenditures. 10 ILCS 5/9-10(b), -11(a).\n\f72                                                No. 11-3693\n\n   Having to disclose the names of donors is the most\nonerous requirement that the statute imposes on a\npolitical committee because many donors don’t want to\nbe publicly identified as contributing to an organiza-\ntion engaged in public advocacy regarding issues of\npublic policy, which usually are controversial. Indeed CIF\nalleges without contradiction that its donors require\nassurances that their identities will not be disclosed, and\nthat this anonymity is a condition of their support. So CIF\nvery much does not want to be classified as a political com-\nmittee and one way to avoid that fate is to avoid any\nactivity that might, even if there is no certainty that\nit would, require CIF to register.\n   The vagueness of a number of key provisions of the\nIllinois law is therefore worrisome. A vague statute\ncan deter lawful activity. Cautious persons will want\nto avoid even a small probability of being found to\nhave violated it, and the safest way to do that is to\navoid lawful activity that is just across the line from\nthe unlawful—to create a buffer zone around the\nstatutory core, just as cautious men decide not to have\nsex with young-looking women who probably are not\nbelow the age of consent but may be. When the lawful\nactivity likely to be deterred by a vague statute is not\nextramarital sex but the exercise of free speech—a right\nat the apex of modern constitutional solicitude—a\nfinding of vagueness is apt to doom the statute. FCC v.\nFox Television Stations, Inc., 132 S. Ct. 2307, 2317-18 (2012).\nThe vague provisions in the Illinois election statute\nmay cause CIF to refrain from constitutionally protected\n\fNo. 11-3693                                              73\n\nadvocacy that the state has no power to regulate\nbecause the advocacy could not influence an election.\n  Nor can a federal court make a binding interpretation\nof a state statute, endeavoring to trim its vague provi-\nsions; if it attempts a narrowing interpretation that devi-\nates widely from the statute’s apparent meaning it is\ntaking a big risk that the state will reject the interpreta-\ntion. Stenberg v. Carhart, 530 U.S. 914, 944-45 (2000). That\nrisk will in turn operate as a deterrent to the advocacy\ngroup’s relying on the federal court’s interpretation.\nWith an election looming, advocacy groups can’t\nwait for the Supreme Court of Illinois to interpret\nall the vague provisions of the election statute in cases\ninstituted in the state court system that are likely to\ntake years to reach and be decided by the state’s highest\ncourt.\n  These are the vague provisions:\n  1. A transfer of funds from a political committee to\na political committee qualifies as a contribution re-\ngardless of amount. A political committee must report\nall receipts, not just contributions as defined by the\nstatute, see 10 ILCS 5/9-11(a)(10), and in addition must\nreport “the name and address of each political commit-\ntee from which the reporting committee received, or to\nwhich that committee made, any transfer of funds.”\n10 ILCS 5/9-11(a)(6). So if by virtue of other contributions\nor other activities CIF were to be classified as a political\ncommittee, it would have to identify any other political\ncommittees from which it received money. It might not\nknow a donor was a political committee, and that would\n\f74                                             No. 11-3693\n\nbe no defense, because the statute does not require knowl-\nedge or even suspicion that the transferor is a political\ncommittee—there is no state of mind requirement at\nall. The transferee would have to investigate the\nfinancial activity of each donor (including an individual,\nwho as a “natural person” can constitute a political com-\nmittee) to determine whether the donor was a political\ncommittee. It might be a committee that had improperly\nfailed to register; that would be no defense. Yet it would\nbe afraid to list a donor as a political committee\nunless confident that it was one, as otherwise it might\nget into trouble with the donor. Damned if it does,\ndamned if it doesn’t.\n  An unregistered entity doesn’t have to disclose its\ncontributions and expenditures, so it would rarely be\nclear whether an entity qualified as a political committee.\nVery little of the information required to determine\nthe status of a donor is public. This is an additional\nreason why advocacy groups like CIF might forgo dona-\ntions from unfamiliar donors. But by reducing the\ngroup’s resources, this cautious response to the\nvagueness of the statute would curtail its advocacy.\n  An alternative reading of the “transfer of funds” provi-\nsion is that receipt of money from a political committee\nmakes the recipient a political committee. Illinois may\nhave been concerned that interest groups would\ntransfer money in chains ending with a committee that\ndidn’t have to register; to target those chains and thus\nclose a potential loophole in the statute, the Illinois\ncourts might read the statute to reach all members of the\n\fNo. 11-3693                                               75\n\nchain. This interpretation would have an even greater\ntendency to discourage an advocacy group from\naccepting donations from unfamiliar individuals or\norganizations.\n   2. Any “electioneering communication” made with the\n“knowledge” of a candidate is an expenditure that if\nit exceeds the low statutory threshold makes the\nadvertiser a political committee. The word “knowledge”\ncan’t be interpreted to require that the advertiser have\ncommunicated with the candidate, because knowledge\ncan be acquired in other ways. My colleagues think the\nIllinois courts would interpret the word “knowledge,”\nwhich appears at the end of the sequence “request, sug-\ngestion, and knowledge,” to mean the same thing as\nthe two preceding words because it is the “more\ngeneral word.” But it’s no more general than the other\nwords; the three words are simply different from one\nanother. It’s not like a statute that refers to “automobiles,\ntrucks, tractors, motorcycles, and other motor-powered\nvehicles”; in that sequence “motor-powered vehicles” is\nindeed more general than the itemized examples, but\npresumably not intended to be so encompassing a\ncatchall as to include airplanes, since all the preceding\nterms in the sequence denote different forms of land-\nbased transportation. Cf. McBoyle v. United States, 283\nU.S. 25 (1931) (Holmes, J.).\n  So an organization that wanted to avoid crossing\nthe $3000 threshold would if cautious refrain from broad-\ncasting ads entirely, rather than just avoid coordinating\ntheir ads with the candidate.\n\f76                                            No. 11-3693\n\n  The district judge was troubled by this provision and\nto save it interpreted “knowledge” to mean “affirmative\nacquiescence.” But what does that mean? That the candi-\ndate was delighted to learn of an ad that praised him\nor a policy he was pushing?\n  3. If an “electioneering communication” is deemed to be\n“made” whenever a user accesses a website, cf. Flava\nWorks, Inc. v. Gunter, No. 11-3190, 2012 WL 3124826, at *7\n(7th Cir. Aug. 2, 2012), then even an appeal to vote that\nis posted more than 30 or 60 days before the election\n(depending on whether it is a primary or a general elec-\ntion) will constitute an expenditure that, if it exceeds\nthe modest threshold in the statute, will make the com-\nmunicator a political committee and thus require it to\nregister. A television advertiser controls the dates on\nwhich his ad is shown; but an Internet ad or web posting\nremains online and accessible until removed. The ad-\nvertiser may delete the ad from his website, but it may\nalready have been copied and posted on a hundred other\nwebsites. Should the advertiser be thought to be con-\ntinuing to make an electioneering communication by\nfailing to ensure that his ad posted during the safe\nharbor periods is no longer accessible to voters? And\nhow can he do that? On these critical questions, the\nstatute is silent. The only sure way to avoid having to\nregister as a political committee is therefore to avoid\nendorsing an Illinois candidate online at any time.\n  The Illinois courts might interpret “made” to refer only\nto the original posting of the ad. But this would open up\na loophole; the advocacy group might have posted the\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                77\n\nad shortly before the 30- or 60-day cutoff and deleted it\njust before the cutoffs, confident that the campaign\nfavored by the ad would copy it and post it so that it\nwould be seen right up to election day. Because the\nstate courts might well decide to close this loophole by\ninterpreting “made” to include the initial posting, advo-\ncacy groups would be running a legal risk by posting\nonline ads even long before the date of the election, and\nmight therefore be deterred from doing so.\n   4. Any payment “in connection with” an election (in-\ncluding payment for ads) counts as an expenditure. “In\nconnection with” could apply to communications not\nmade for the purpose of influencing the election, such as\nspeech on issues of policy that happen to be salient\nin the campaign. An advocacy group might intend\nits message to reach a wider audience. It might even\nbe advocating a position embraced by neither candidate.\nDisclosure of such a group’s finances would not be\nclosely related to the state’s interest in informing the\nelectorate about a candidate’s supporters. Yet the\nstatute may require it.\n   Speech can have all sorts of connections to an election:\nit may mention an election, describe a candidate and his\npositions, or simply refer to a policy that is at issue in the\ncampaign. A dry discussion of economic indicators\nmight be seen as being “in connection with” an election\nin which the main issue was economic policy. Because\ndisclosure requirements are not constitutionally limited\nto express advocacy for a candidate, see Citizens United\nv. Federal Election Commission, supra, 130 S. Ct. at 915,\n\f78                                             No. 11-3693\n\nthere is no telling how far Illinois’s definition reaches\ninto the realm of issue advocacy. Once again, to be sure\nof not having to register, an organization like CIF\nmight decide to avoid speaking about any policy issues\nduring election campaigns. It might go silent during\ncampaigns.\n  5. Expenditures made “in connection with” an elec-\ntion count towards the $3000 threshold for registering\nonly if they are made “on behalf of or in opposition to”\na candidate, and that might seem to take care of the\nconcerns I just expressed with respect to “in connection\nwith.” But speech supporting or opposing a policy associ-\nated with a candidate could be seen as being on behalf\nof or in opposition to that candidate, especially if the\npolicy is the candidate’s signature issue. The term thus\ndoes not clearly exclude most issue advocacy, and\ngroups such as CIF might therefore avoid speaking\non issues that could be associated with a particular candi-\ndate. Imagine a single-issue candidate: a songbird en-\nthusiast, he wants the owners of cats to be forbidden\nto allow their pets out of doors, since cats, indifferent\nto avian beauty and melody, kill birds for food and\nsport. If the humane society buys ads that declare its\npassionate support for the songbirds, isn’t there a sense\nin which it is advocating for the election of the song-\nbirds’ candidate and therefore making an expenditure on\nhis behalf and in opposition to his opponent? Or should\n“on behalf of” be interpreted to mean motivated by a\ndesire to help the candidate rather than the cause the\ncandidate supports? Who knows?\n\fNo. 11-3693                                              79\n\n  McConnell v. Federal Election Commission, 540 U.S. 93,\n170 n. 64 (2003), overruled on other grounds in Citizens\nUnited v. Federal Election Commission, supra, held that a\nfederal law that contained the words “promotes,” “sup-\nports,” “attacks,” and “opposes” was not vague; and the\nphrase “on behalf of or in opposition to” is similar. But\nthe federal law involved speech referring to particular\ncandidates and made by state political parties the\nactions of which are presumed to be coordinated with\ncandidates. The Illinois law applies to all who want to\nspeak on public issues but furnishes no clue to how\nrelated to a candidate’s position their speech must be to\ntrigger the disclosure requirements. The statute is not\nlimited to groups that coordinate their activity with a\ncandidate or expressly advocate for him. And it is not, as\nin the counterpart federal statute, 2 U.S.C. § 431(8)(A)(i),\nlimited to speech made “for the purpose of influencing”\nan election, since there is no state of mind limitation in\nthe Illinois statute, so no basis for using purposiveness\nto limit relatedness.\n   The more arbitrary the meaning that must be assigned\nto a state statute to avoid constitutional problems, the\nless confident we can be that the state courts would adopt\nit. If independent advocacy groups share these doubts,\ncaution may make them steer well clear of the statutory\nconditions for having to register as a political committee,\nwith all the burdens entailed by registration.\n  When the five vague statutory provisions that I have\nbeen discussing are considered in combination, it be-\ncomes apparent that their cumulative effect on advocacy\nby CIF and similar organizations could be considerable.\n\f80                                              No. 11-3693\n\nTo avoid the burden of registration, such groups may\ntake measures to curb their advocacy even if those mea-\nsures may not in fact (that is, in law) be required in order\nto avoid having to register. That is the vice of vague-\nness—that it causes an organization or an individual\nto give a law a wide berth, in this instance by forgoing\nconstitutionally protected speech. We should insist,\nin the name of the First Amendment, that the Illinois\nlegislature speak with greater clarity.\n\n\n\n\n                           9-10-12\n\f",

Those provisions require any outside entity\nor individual spending significant sums in a federal\nelection to file reports with the Federal Election Com-\nmission (FEC) identifying the person or group making\nthe expenditure, its amount, and the names of certain\ncontributors. Describing disclosure requirements as a\n“less restrictive alternative to more comprehensive reg-\nulations of speech,” the Citizens United Court wrote\nthat “prompt disclosure of expenditures can provide\nshareholders and citizens with the information needed\nto hold corporations and elected officials accountable\nfor their positions and supporters. . . . The First Amend-\nment protects political speech; and disclosure permits\ncitizens and shareholders to react to the speech of corpo-\nrate entities in a proper way.” Id. at 916. Despite this\nholding, in the aftermath of Citizens United a number\nof suits have been filed challenging federal and state\ndisclosure regulations as facially unconstitutional. Of\nthe federal courts of appeals that have decided these\ncases, every one has upheld the disclosure regulations\nagainst the facial attacks.1\n\n\n\n1\n  See National Org. for Marriage, Inc. v.

Plaintiff-\nappellant Center for Individual Freedom (the Center)\nseeks to invalidate Illinois disclosure requirements on\nthe grounds that they are facially vague and overbroad\nrestrictions of speech in violation of the First and Four-\nteenth Amendments.

It requires groups and individuals that\naccept “contributions,” make “expenditures,” or sponsor\n“electioneering communications” in excess of $3,000 to\nmake regular financial disclosures to the State Board of\nElections.

Factual and Procedural Background\n  The Center is a Virginia-based § 501(c)(4) nonprofit\norganization whose stated mission is “to protect and\ndefend individual freedoms and individual rights guaran-\nteed by the U.S. Constitution.” To that end, it broad-\ncasts advertisements, maintains a website, publishes a\nweekly e-mail newsletter, produces a bi-weekly radio\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                   5\n\nshow, and engages in other forms of mass media com-\nmunications. Its tax exempt status under § 501(c)(4) is\nincompatible with partisan political activity, so the\nCenter cannot endorse candidates or urge the public to\n“vote for so-and-so.” But apart from a need to avoid\nsuch “express advocacy,” in the lingo of campaign\nfinance law, the Center and other § 501(c)(4) groups\nenjoy fairly wide latitude from the IRS. During election\nseasons, the Center runs advertisements that refer to\nthe positions of candidates or to ballot issues and call\non the audience to take actions such as contacting candi-\ndates.2\n  The Center wished to engage in similar advocacy\nduring the 2010 elections in Illinois and made plans to\naddress “legal reform and other justice-related issues” in\n\n\n2\n  In one TV spot, for instance, the Center criticized West\nVirginia Attorney General Darrell McGraw during his 2008\nreelection campaign:\n    Announcer: They say you can’t teach an old dog new tricks.\n    Twenty-eight years of controversy and Darrell McGraw\n    is at it again, spending $10 million from a settlement meant\n    to help workers and the elderly — instead, divvying it up\n    between his trial lawyer buddies and a fund only\n    controlled by McGraw. The Wheeling Intelligencer said,\n    “Legislators should have put a leash on McGraw long ago.”\n    But they say you can’t teach an old dog new tricks. Call\n    Darrell McGraw. Tell him to return the people’s money.\nDkt. No. 73; CFIF Launches Public Education Effort in W. Va.,\nYoutube, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPMwR2gMNTE\n(last visited Aug. 29, 2012).\n\f6                                               No. 11-3693\n\nadvertisements referring to incumbent officeholders\nwho were candidates. But the Center feared that Illinois’s\nnewly-amended campaign finance laws would require it\nto register as a “political committee” and to disclose\nits election-related expenditures and its significant con-\ntributors. According to the Center, its donors require\nassurances that their identities will not be disclosed, and\nthis anonymity is a condition of their support. The\nCenter says it had no choice but to forbear from its\nIllinois “issue advocacy” in 2010, so its political speech\nwas chilled by Illinois’s disclosure laws.\n  These laws are codified in Article 9 of the Illinois Elec-\ntion Code. Article 9 is long and filled with the jargon\nof contemporary U.S. campaign finance law — “election-\neering communications,” “independent expenditures,”\netc. — which we detail in Part IV of this opinion. But\nArticle 9’s basic provisions are fairly easy to summarize.\nEach political committee in Illinois must register with\nthe Board of Elections, maintain records of every con-\ntribution received and expenditure made “in connec-\ntion with” an election, 10 ILCS 5/9-7, and file a report of\nall such transactions each quarter, 10 ILCS 5/9-10(b).\nThis quarterly report must include the total sums\nof contributions received and expenditures made in\nthe covered period; accountings of the committee’s funds\non-hand and investment assets held; and the name\nand address of each contributor who gave more than\n$150 that quarter. 10 ILCS 5/9-11(a). In addition to the\nquarterly report, a political committee must disclose\nany contribution of $1,000 or more (along with the\nname and address of the contributor) within five days of\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                   7\n\nits receipt, or within two days if received 30 or fewer days\nbefore an election. 10 ILCS 5/9-10(c). For reporting viola-\ntions, the Board may issue civil fines of no more than\n$5,000 for any one group (except in the case of “willful\nand wanton” violations), or seek to enjoin violators’\ncampaign activities in state court. 10 ILCS 5/9-10.3\n   Candidates’ campaign organizations and political\nparties of course must register as political committees.\n10 ILCS 5/9-1.8(b), (c). But so too must outside groups\nand private individuals if, within any 12-month period,\nthey accept contributions or make expenditures in\nexcess of $3,000 “on behalf of or in opposition to” any\ncandidate or ballot question. 10 ILCS 5/9-1.8(d), (e). Any\nentity other than a natural person must also register as\na political committee if it makes “independent expendi-\ntures” of more than $3,000 within one year. 10 ILCS 5/9-\n8.6(b). Illinois has largely borrowed from federal law\nits definition of “electioneering communication,” which\nmeans a radio, television, or Internet broadcast that\n(1) refers to a “clearly identified” candidate, political\nparty, or ballot issue; (2) is made within two months of\na general election or one month of a primary election,\n(3) is “targeted to the relevant electorate,” and (4) is\n\n\n3\n   The Board or any political committee may also seek injunc-\ntive relief in state court to compel compliance with Board\norders or to enjoin an offending committee’s operations. 10 ILCS\n5/9-23, 5/9-24. Filing false or incomplete information in a\ncampaign finance report may also constitute a “business\noffense” under the Criminal Code punishable by criminal fine\nof up to $5,000. See 10 ILCS 5/9-26.\n\f8                                                   No. 11-3693\n\nunambiguously an “appeal to vote” for or against a\ncandidate, party, or ballot issue. 10 ILCS 5/9-1.14.4\nFunds spent on electioneering communications that are\ncoordinated with a political committee are treated as\ncontributions to that committee, while uncoordinated\nelectioneering communications are considered independ-\nent expenditures. See 10 ILCS 5/9-1.15.\n   The Center argues that five of Article 9’s definitions —\n“electioneering communications,” “political committee,”\n“contribution,” “expenditure,” and “independent expendi-\nture” — are facially vague and overbroad.

The Center’s self-\ncensorship was based on an objectively reasonable,\n“actual[,] and well-founded fear that the law will be\nenforced against” it.

In that case, we held that the\nplaintiff did not have standing to challenge Wisconsin’s\npolitical committee registration requirements because\nsuccessive advisory opinions of the Wisconsin Attorney\nGeneral and regulations promulgated by the state\nelection board already established that the definition of\npolitical committee did not apply to groups like the\nplaintiff. Id. at 1185. These formal determinations by\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                    13\n\nthe state authorities meant that the plaintiff’s fear of\nprosecution under the law was not “objectively ‘well-\nfounded,’ ” id., quoting American Booksellers, 484 U.S. at 393,\nthat the lawsuit was an attempt “to resolve a con-\ntroversy that has not yet arisen and may never arise,”id.\nat 1187-88, and that the plaintiff therefore lacked standing.7\n  This case is quite different for there has been no\ndetermination by any Illinois official that the Center and\nother such groups do not qualify as political committees\nunder Article 9. The named defendants are the Illinois\nAttorney General and members of the Board of Elections.\nThey have not denied that the Center’s past out-of-state\n“issue ads” could qualify as electioneering communica-\ntions under the Illinois disclosure laws. Unlike Paradise,\nthere is a sufficiently realistic possibility that the Center\nwould be subject to Article 9’s registration and reporting\nrequirements if it engages in the type of political\nadvocacy it often does and wishes to in Illinois. That is\n\n\n\n7\n   Technically, the Paradise holding was on the redressability\nprong rather than the injury-in-fact prong of the standing rule.\nThe only real potential threat of injury to the plaintiff came\nfrom private actors, whom the Wisconsin statute empowered\nto bring enforcement suits in state court against unregistered\norganizations that ran illegal campaign advertising. A\npotential injury from a decision by a state court in private\nlitigation was not redressable by a federal court order\nbecause a state court is not required to accept an inferior\nfederal court’s determination that a statute is unconstitu-\ntionally overbroad. We therefore held that the third prong\nof Article III standing (redressability) was not met.

We find that\nthe Center has Article III standing to challenge the con-\nstitutionality of Illinois’s disclosure law.\n\n\nIII. Scope of Review: Facial Challenge\n  Next we must clarify the scope of the legal challenge\nbefore us. The Center describes its suit as both a facial and\nan as-applied challenge, arguing that Article 9 is uncon-\nstitutionally vague and overbroad “both facially and as\napplied to independent issue advocacy groups such\nas CFIF.” It is true that facial challenges and as-applied\nchallenges can overlap conceptually. See Doe v. Reed, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"150541\"><a href=\"/opinion/150541/doe-v-reed/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.

L. Rev. 1321, 1341\n(2000) (“[F]acial challenges are less categorically distinct\nfrom as-applied challenges than is often thought.”). But\nthere is a difference: Where the “claim and the relief that\nwould follow . . . reach beyond the particular circum-\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                15\n\nstances of the[] plaintiffs,” “[t]hey must . . . satisfy [the]\nstandards for a facial challenge to the extent of that reach.”\nDoe v. Reed, 130 S. Ct. at 2817 (2010).\n   This is not a case where a group has actually engaged\nin a particular form of speech that is subject to regulation\nand seeks to challenge the applicability of the law to\nitself and other groups who have engaged in similar\nexpressive activity.

Here, the Center has not broadcast any communi-\ncations in Illinois, so it would be impossible for this\ncourt to fashion a remedy tailored to its own particular\nspeech activities and those of similar groups, for we\nhave only a general idea of what its hypothetical broad-\ncasts would say. The Center has not laid the foundation\nfor an as-applied challenge here. We analyze its claims\nunder the standards governing facial challenges.\n  Those standards set a high bar. In reversing a decision\nstriking down a state election law in a facial challenge,\nthe Supreme Court explained:\n    Facial challenges are disfavored for several reasons.\n    Claims of facial invalidity often rest on speculation.\n    As a consequence, they raise the risk of premature\n    interpretation of statutes on the basis of factually\n    barebones records. Facial challenges also run contrary\n    to the fundamental principle of judicial restraint\n\f16                                                 No. 11-3693\n\n     that courts should neither “’anticipate a question of\n     constitutional law in advance of the necessity of\n     deciding it’ ” nor “formulate a rule of constitutional\n     law broader than is required by the precise facts to\n     which it is to be applied.” Ashwander v.

Overbreadth and Void-for-Vagueness Claims\n  The Supreme Court has recognized a particular type\nof facial challenge in the First Amendment context\nunder which a law may be struck down entirely as\nimpermissibly overbroad. Under this overbreadth\ndoctrine, “a statute is facially invalid if it prohibits a\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                     17\n\nsubstantial amount of protected speech.” United States v.\nWilliams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145810\"><a href=\"/opinion/145810/united-states-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">285</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 292 (2008).

Article 9 differs from fed-\neral disclosure provisions in two significant respects.\nFirst, Article 9 extends the disclosure of expenditures\nand contributions to ballot initiative campaigns. Second,\nArticle 9 regulates as a political committee any organiza-\ntion that exceeds the dollar-limit spending thresholds,\nwhile under federal law only those groups with the\n“major purpose” of influencing elections must register as\npolitical committees. In addition to these substan-\ntive differences, Article 9’s definitions of several key\nterms — “electioneering communication,” “expenditure,”\n“contribution,” and “independent expenditure” — differ\nslightly from their federal law analogs. We first\nanalyze the two broader questions on ballot initiatives\nand the major-purpose test before turning to the\nstatutory details.\n\n\n  A. Disclosures for Ballot Issue Campaigns\n    1.

Federal\nlaw does not provide for ballot initiatives and referenda,\nso FECA contains no corresponding requirements. The\nissue here is whether this additional feature of Article 9’s\ndisclosure regime is substantially related to Illinois’s\ninterest in maintaining an informed electorate.\n  Educating voters is at least as important, if not more\nso, in the context of initiatives and referenda as in candi-\ndate elections.

The Center has\n“provided us scant evidence or argument,” id. at 2821,\nbeyond bare speculation, that Article 9 would be at all\nlikely to precipitate “threats, harassment, or reprisals”\nagainst it or other similarly situated advocacy groups.\nSee Buckley, 424 U.S. at 74.\n  Article 9’s application to contributions and expenditures\nrelated to ballot initiatives is substantially related to\n\f32                                                  No. 11-3693\n\nIllinois’s strong interest in maintaining an informed\nelectorate, and this interest strongly outweighs any bur-\ndens on protected speech, at least in the absence of\nfacts that might be offered in support of a much\nnarrower as-applied challenge.1 6\n\n\n     2. Electioneering Communications on Ballot Issues\n  Article 9 also requires groups to register as ballot initia-\ntive committees when they spend more than $3,000\non electioneering communications that advocate for or\nagainst ballot issues. 10 ILCS 5/9-1.8(e). This provision\nlikewise advances the state’s interest in ensuring voters\nare informed about ballot initiatives. The Center argues\nthat the requirement imposes significant burdens on\nspeakers because the definition of electioneering com-\nmunication does not adequately distinguish ballot initia-\ntive campaign advocacy from pure issue discussion.\nThe Center’s argument relies principally on two\nSupreme Court cases — Buckley v. Valeo and FEC v. Wis-\nconsin Right to Life, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145706\"><a href=\"/opinion/145706/federal-election-comn-v-wisconsin-right-to-life-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">449</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2007). The Buckley\nCourt upheld all of the disclosure and reporting require-\nments in FECA. To avoid the regulation of pure “issue\ndiscussion,” though, the Court placed a narrowing con-\nstruction on the term “expenditure” “to reach only\nfunds used for communications that expressly advocate\nthe election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.”\n\n\n16\n  The failure of the Center’s “broad based challenge does not\nforeclose success” on a future as-applied challenge to Article 9.\nSee Doe, 130 S. Ct. at 2821.\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                   33\n\nBuckley, 424 U.S. at 80 (footnote omitted) (emphasis\nadded). This was the genesis of a distinction Buckley\nhad earlier drawn in the context of independent ex-\npenditures between issue discussion and express advo-\ncacy. The latter, the Court said, would typically involve the\nuse of unequivocal words and phrases “such as ‘vote\nfor,’ ‘elect,’ ‘support,’ ‘cast your ballot for, ‘Smith for\nCongress,’ . . . ‘defeat,’ ‘reject’ ”— a list that has come to be\nknown as Buckley’s “magic words.” Id. at 44 n.52. For many\nyears the Court adhered to the distinction, but it repeatedly\nemphasized that “the express advocacy limitation . . . was\nthe product of statutory interpretation rather than a con-\nstitutional command.” McConnell, 540 U.S. at 191-92; see\nalso Wisconsin Right to Life, 551 U.S. at 475 n.71 (principal\nopinion of Roberts, C.J.) (reiterating that Buckley’s\n“magic words” definition “does not dictate a constitu-\ntional test” and the “express advocacy restriction was\nan endpoint of statutory interpretation, not a first\nprinciple of constitutional law”).\n  In Wisconsin Right to Life, the Supreme Court’s lead\nopinion held that the federal ban on corporate and labor\ndisbursements for campaign-related broadcasts could\nbe applied only to advertisements that were “express\nadvocacy” or its “functional equivalent.” 551 U.S. at 465,\nciting McConnell, 540 U.S. at 206. A broadcast is the\n“functional equivalent of express advocacy only if the\nad is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other\nthan as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candi-\ndate.” Id. at 469-70. While “[c]ourts need not ignore\nbasic background information that may be necessary to\nput an ad in context,” id. at 474 , “there generally should\n\f34                                               No. 11-3693\n\nbe no discovery or inquiry into the sort of contextual\nfactors” that would go to either the speaker’s “subjective”\nintent or the likely “effect” of the ad on the electorate,\nid. at 474 n.7. The Center contends that Article 9’s defini-\ntion of electioneering communication is inconsistent\nwith Buckley and Wisconsin Right to Life because it\nconsiders whether a broadcast refers to a “clearly\nidentified question of public policy that will appear on\nthe ballot.” 10 ILCS 5/9-1.14. The Center calls this “an\nintent-or-effect standard that requires a judgment as\nto how a listener will understand speech,” since the\npublic discussion of certain policy issues could be con-\nsidered discussion of a ballot question.\n  For two reasons, we disagree. First, Citizens United\nmade clear that the wooden distinction between express\nadvocacy and issue discussion does not apply in the\ndisclosure context.\n  In Citizens United, which came after Wisconsin Right to\nLife, the Court explicitly rejected the plaintiff’s attempt to\ngraft the express advocacy/issue discussion dichotomy\nonto the constitutional law of campaign finance disclo-\nsure. 130 S. Ct. at 915. The Court reaffirmed that\n  disclosure is a less restrictive alternative to more compre-\n  hensive regulations of speech. In Buckley, the Court\n  upheld a disclosure requirement for independent expen-\n  ditures even though it invalidated a provision that\n  imposed a ceiling on those expenditures. In McConnell,\n  three Justices who would have found § 441b to be\n  unconstitutional nonetheless voted to uphold BCRA’s\n  disclosure and disclaimer requirements. And the Court\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                     35\n\n     has upheld registration and disclosure requirements\n     on lobbyists, even though Congress has no power to\n     ban lobbying itself. For these reasons, we reject Citizens\n     United’s contention that the disclosure requirements\n     must be limited to speech that is the functional equiva-\n     lent of express advocacy.\nId. at 915 (citations omitted). Accordingly, mandatory\ndisclosure requirements are constitutionally permissible\neven if ads contain no direct candidate advocacy and\n“only pertain to a commercial transaction.” Id. at 915.\nWhatever the status of the express advocacy/issue dis-\ncussion distinction may be in other areas of campaign\nfinance law, Citizens United left no doubt that disclosure\nrequirements need not hew to it to survive First Amend-\nment scrutiny. With just one exception, every circuit\nthat has reviewed First Amendment challenges to dis-\nclosure requirements since Citizens United has concluded\nthat such laws may constitutionally cover more than\njust express advocacy and its functional equivalents, and\nin each case the court upheld the law.1 7\n\n\n17\n  See National Org. for Marriage, Inc. v.

The Center first\nargues that the “in support of or in opposition to”\nlanguage is vague. In McConnell, however, the Court\nfound that very similar language was not unconstitu-\ntionally vague. See 540 U.S. at 170 n.64 (“The words ‘pro-\nmote,’ ‘oppose,’ ‘attack,’ and ‘support’ clearly set forth\nthe confines within which potential party speakers\nmust act in order to avoid triggering the provision.

This part of McConnell remains valid after Citizens\nUnited, and it forecloses the Center’s argument that\nsubsection 1.8(e)’s support/opposition language is uncon-\nstitutionally vague. Accord, National Org. for Marriage,\n649 F.3d at 62-64 (rejecting vagueness challenge to\nterms “promoting,” “support,” and “opposition”).\n  The Center also contends that the definition is vague\nbecause it could apply to advocacy on any issue that\nmight one day become the subject of a ballot initiative,\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                   39\n\nand the statute “provides no guidance . . . for determining\nwhen such a policy issue becomes a regulated ‘question\nof public policy.’ ” For example, a group might spend\n$3,000 producing an ad that denounces high sales taxes,\nonly to find six months later that a sales tax cut will be\non the ballot as an initiative. The Center argues that\nunder Article 9, that group might be found to have\nviolated the statute if it failed to register as a ballot initia-\ntive committee and make required disclosures.\n  Courts do not decide facial challenges on the basis\nof such speculative hypotheticals. As the district court\nobserved, campaign-related broadcasts are considered\nelectioneering communications only when they are made\nwithin 60 days of a general election or 30 days of a pri-\nmary, “at which point it would already be known if an\ninitiative is on the ballot.” As for expenditures that are\nnot for electioneering communications (for example,\nglossy mailers, bumper stickers, buttons, and other cam-\npaign paraphernalia), Article 9’s definition of “ballot\ninitiative committee” is quite plainly aimed at regulating\ngroups that are either campaigning in favor of or\nagainst actual ballot measures or actively advocating or\nopposing placing a specific question on the ballot. We\nhave no reason to suppose the Board would construe or\nenforce the provision more expansively, so we cannot\nsay that the definition of ballot initiative committee is\nsubstantially overbroad in relation to its plainly legitimate\nsweep, see United States v.

Definition of Political Committee: The “Major Purpose”\n     Test\n  The Center argues that Illinois’s disclosure requirements\nare vague and overbroad because they regulate as\npolitical committees groups that do not have as their\n“major purpose” the election of a candidate. Recall that\noutside groups are required to register as political com-\nmittees if within a 12-month period they make or receive\nmore than $3,000 worth of contributions, expenditures,\nor independent expenditures for electioneering com-\nmunications. See 10 ILCS 5/9-1.8, 5/9-8.6(b). The Center\ncontends that Supreme Court precedent strictly cabins\nregulation of political committees to organizations that\nare “under the control of a candidate” or whose\n“major purpose” is “the nomination or election of a\ncandidate.” Article 9’s political committee provision\ncovers additional entities, and thus, the Center contends,\nthe provision is fatally overbroad. We disagree.\n  Like the express advocacy/issue discussion distinction,\nthe Center’s proposed major purpose test also has its\norigins in Buckley. The Buckley Court reviewed FECA’s\nreporting requirements on political committees, which\nthe statute defined as “any committee, club, association,\nor other group of persons which receives contributions\nor makes expenditures during a calendar year in an\naggregate amount exceeding $1,000.” Buckley, 424 U.S. at\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                41\n\n79 n.105, quoting 2 U.S.C. § 431(d) (current version at\n§ 431(4)(A)). A parallel provision of FECA defined “contri-\nbution” and “expenditure” as the “use of money or other\nvaluable assets ‘for the purpose of . . . influencing’ the\nnomination or election of candidates for federal office.” Id.\nat 77, quoting 2 U.S.C. § 431(e), (f) (current version at\n§ 431(8), (9)). In the context of this definition, the Court\nconcluded that the disclosure requirements could\npresent “vagueness problems, for ‘political committee’ is\ndefined only in terms of amount of annual ‘contributions’\nand ‘expenditures,’ and could be interpreted to reach\ngroups engaged purely in issue discussion.” Id. at 79. To\navoid these line-drawing problems, the Court construed\nthe term political committee more narrowly:\n    To fulfill the purposes of the Act, [political committees]\n    need only encompass organizations that are under\n    the control of a candidate or the major purpose of which\n    is the nomination or election of a candidate. Expendi-\n    tures of candidates and of “political committees” so\n    construed can be assumed to fall within the core\n    area sought to be addressed by Congress. They are,\n    by definition, campaign related.\nId. (emphasis added). The Court has referred to this\nnarrowing construction in subsequent opinions. See, e.g.,\nMcConnell, 540 U.S. at 170 n.64; FEC v. Massachusetts\nCitizens for Life, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111782\"><a href=\"/opinion/111782/federal-election-commn-v-massachusetts-citizens-for-life-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 252 n.6 (1986) (plurality\nopinion). The Center draws from this the conclusion\nthat the First Amendment imposes a bright-line prohibi-\ntion against applying disclosure requirements to a\ngroup whose “major purpose” is other than the nomina-\ntion or election of candidates.\n\f42                                                   No. 11-3693\n\n  The argument reads Buckley too broadly. First, as is\nclear from the quoted portion, the “major purpose”\nlimitation, like the express advocacy/issue discussion\ndistinction, was a creature of statutory interpretation,\nnot constitutional command. See National Org. for\nMarriage, 649 F.3d at 59 (“We find no reason to believe\nthat this so-called ‘major purpose’ test, like the other\nnarrowing constructions adopted in Buckley, is anything\nmore than an artifact of the Court’s construction of a\nfederal statute.”); Human Life, 624 F.3d at 1009-10\n(“Buckley’s statement . . . does not indicate that an entity\nmust have that major purpose to be deemed constitution-\nally a political committee.”).2 3 Buckley’s limiting construc-\ntion was drawn for the statute before it, and the\nSupreme Court has never applied a “major purpose” test\nto a state’s regulation of political committees. See National\nOrg. for Marriage, 649 F.3d at 59.\n\n\n23\n   See also Vermont Right to Life Committee, Inc. v.\nSorrell, ___ F.

First, when\nBuckley was decided, political committees faced much\ngreater burdens under FECA’s 1974 amendments than\nIllinois’s disclosure requirements impose. For instance,\nFECA then included hard limits on the size of contribu-\ntions to political committees, and on how much they\ncould contribute to other political committees. See\nBuckley, 424 U.S. at 35.2 4 When regulation as a political\ncommittee entails adherence to these and other more\nburdensome requirements, there is more room to argue\nthat the major purpose test might be needed under the\nFirst Amendment than when the law imposes only dis-\nclosure obligations. For instance, the Supreme Court\nin Massachusetts Citizens for Life held that a federal law\nprohibiting corporations from making independent\nexpenditures except through segregated funds was uncon-\nstitutional as applied to a nonprofit political advocacy\norganization, but the Court expressly acknowledged\nthat the organization could be required to comply with\nFECA’s disclosure regime. See 479 U.S. at 262 (“These\n\n\n\n24\n   In Illinois’s 2009 amendments to its campaign finance law,\nthe legislature imposed hard limits on the amount political\ncommittees could accept from any one individual, entity, or\nother political committee. 10 ILCS 5/9-8.5(d). These limits\nwent into effect in January 2011 but were invalidated as uncon-\nstitutional as applied to non-candidate, non-political party\n“political action committees.” See Personal PAC v. McGuffage, ___\nF.

The state\ninterest in disclosure therefore can be met in a manner\nless restrictive than imposing the full panoply of regula-\ntions that accompany status as a political committee\nunder the Act.”). Massachusetts Citizens for Life shows\nthat there is nothing constitutionally magical about being\nlabeled as a political committee; what matters are the\nburdens that attend the classification.\n  Second, Article 9 defines political committee more\nnarrowly than FECA by covering only groups that accept\ncontributions or make expenditures “on behalf of or in\nopposition to” a candidate or ballot initiative. This defini-\ntion is more targeted to campaign-related speech than\nFECA’s definition of contribution and expenditure,\nwhich applies to anything of value given or received\n“for the purpose of . . . influencing” an election. 2 U.S.C.\n§ 431(8), (9). Again, in McConnell, the Court held that\nsimilar language (words such as “’promote,’ ‘oppose,’\n‘attack,’ and ‘support’ ”) “provide[d] explicit standards”\nand was not vague. See 540 U.S. at 170 n.64. The Illinois\nlimit of “on behalf of or in opposition to” confines\nthe realm of regulated activity to expenditures and con-\ntributions within the core area of genuinely campaign-\nrelated transactions.\n  Third, as the First Circuit noted in upholding Maine’s\ncampaign finance disclosure law, application of the major\npurpose test would “yield perverse results.” “[A] small\ngroup with the major purpose of electing a . . . state\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                   45\n\nrepresentative that spends [$3,000] for ads could be\nrequired to register” as a political committee, while a\n“mega-group that spends $1,500,000 to defeat the same\ncandidate,” but spends far more on non-campaign-\nrelated activities, “would not have to register because\nthe defeat of that candidate could not be considered the\n[mega-group’s] major purpose.” National Org. for Marriage,\n649 F.3d at 59, quoting National Org. for Marriage v.

The first is the\ndefinition of “electioneering communication,” which\napplies to expenditures and contributions to determine\nwhether an entity is a regulated political committee\nthat must disclose its finances and donors. Illinois defines\n“electioneering communication” as:\n     any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication,\n     including radio, television, or Internet communication,\n     that (1) refers to a clearly identified candidate . . .,\n     clearly identified political party, or a clearly identified\n     question of public policy that will appear on the\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                   51\n\n   ballot, (2) is made within 60 days before a general\n   election . . . or 30 days before a primary election, (3) is\n   targeted to the relevant electorate, and (4) is suscepti-\n   ble to no reasonable interpretation other than as an\n   appeal to vote for or against a clearly identified candi-\n   date . . ., a political party, or a question of public\n   policy.\n10 ILCS 5/9-1.14 (some internal numbering omitted). This\ndefinition is taken almost verbatim from the federal\ndefinition that was upheld (to the extent it triggered\ndisclosure requirements) in Citizens United. Federal law\ndefines “electioneering communication” as:\n   any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication\n   which —\n       (I) refers to a clearly identified candidate for Fed-\n       eral office;\n       (II) is made within —\n              (aa) 60 days before a general . . . election candi-\n              date; or\n              (bb) 30 days before a primary . . . election . . .;\n              and\n       (III) . . . is targeted to the relevant electorate.\n       ...\n       . . . [A] communication which refers to a clearly\n       identified candidate for Federal office is “targeted\n       to the relevant electorate” if the communication\n       can be received by 50,000 or more persons —\n\f52                                                No. 11-3693\n\n        . . . in the district [or state] the candidate seeks to\n        represent . . . .\n2 U.S.C.A. § 434(f)(3)(A)-(C).\n  The Center maintains that Article 9’s definition of\n“electioneering communication” is vague and overbroad.\nThe Supreme Court has already found the federal defini-\ntion to be neither overbroad nor vague in the context of\ndisclosure requirements, see, e.g., Citizens United, 130\nS. Ct. at 916, so in assessing Article 9 we focus on the\nways in which the Illinois statute is broader or less\nprecise than the federal one and then inquire whether\neach difference is constitutionally permissible.\n  There are three differences between the federal and\nArticle 9 definitions of “electioneering communications.”\nFirst, the Illinois statute covers communications related\nto ballot measure campaigns. We determined above\nthat this element of Article 9 does not render the\nstatute vague or overbroad, see parts IV.A.2 & .3, and do\nnot repeat our analysis here. Second, Article 9 covers\n“Internet speech,” which is not regulated by the\nfederal statute. Third, Illinois does not limit the phrase\n“targeted to the relevant electorate” by reference to\nminimum audience size. We now address these last\ntwo differences.\n\n\n      1. Internet Communications\n  The Center contends that Article 9’s regulation of\ncertain Internet speech as electioneering communica-\ntions renders it unconstitutionally broad because\n\fNo. 11-3693                                             53\n\nInternet speech, in contrast to radio and television broad-\ncasts, is not confined to particular audience markets or\nmoments in time. Without firm temporal or geographic\nlimitations, the Center argues, Article 9 potentially\nsweeps in an untold amount of online speech that has\nnothing to do with Illinois elections. The Center notes\nthat “many Internet communications” — for example,\npostings on the Center’s website, emails to the Center’s\nmembership distribution lists, or messages through\nsocial networking sites — “are equally accessible from\nalmost anywhere in the world” and may even persist\nforever in cyber-space through the use of a so-called “Way-\nBack Machine” that stores web sites even after they\nhave been removed by their creators or sponsors. The\nconsequence, it suggests, is that “politically-oriented\nwebsites around the world must review their content\nbefore each Illinois election to identify and remove any\nprior posting referring to someone who now is an Illinois\ncandidate or something that now is an Illinois ballot\nquestion.” Keeping in mind that this is a facial chal-\nlenge, we are not persuaded that this prospect\ninvalidates the entire law.\n   First, requiring disclosure of genuinely campaign-\nrelated Internet communications undoubtedly advances\nIllinois’s important interest in informing its voters\nabout who is speaking before an election. In recent years,\na large and growing proportion of electioneering has\nbeen occurring online. In 2008, for the first time, “more\nthan half the voting-age population used the internet\nto connect to the political process during an election\n\f54                                                  No. 11-3693\n\ncycle.” 2 9 That portion is almost certainly higher today. By\none estimate, the two major parties’ presidential cam-\npaigns will spend $159 million more on web ads in\n2012 than in 2008 — a sevenfold increase. 3 0 Thanks to\nadvanced Internet marketing strategies, campaigns and\nother political actors have now “acquired the technical\ncapacity to target Web ads with the precision of mail or\na door-to-door canvass.” 3 1 Campaigns, parties, and advo-\ncacy groups have increasingly turned to the Internet to\nreach the electorate with campaign messages, and\nIllinois voters have just as much a stake in knowing who\nis behind such messages as when they are broadcast\nin traditional media.\n  On the other hand, we agree with the Center that\nthe potential reach of Illinois’s disclosure law could be\nproblematic if distant speakers were actually subject to\nregulation because their Internet postings inadvertently\n\n\n\n29\n  Aaron Smith, The Internet’s Role in Campaign 2008 3 (Pew\nInternet & Amer.

The state’s interest in informing its voters of\nthe identities, financial outlays, and funding sources of\nsuch marginal political messengers does not rise to\nthe importance the First Amendment demands. Yet the\nCenter has identified no case in which the State\nElection Board has asked out-of-state speakers to\nregister as political committees for disseminating emails,\ntweets, zombie web pages, or any other Internet com-\nmunications that merely mentioned Illinois candidates\nor discussed issues related to Illinois ballot measures.\nNor could the Board legally do so, for under Article 9\nInternet ads count as electioneering communications\nonly when they are both “targeted to the relevant\n[Illinois] electorate” and “susceptible to no reasonable\ninterpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or\nagainst a clearly identified candidate . . ., a political party,\nor a question of public policy.” 10 ILCS 5/9-1.14. The\nCenter’s notion that the Board might consider an out-of-\nstate advocacy group’s web ad generally endorsing\nlow taxes to be an unambiguous appeal to vote for a\n“ballot question to balance the Illinois budget” sounds far-\nfetched.\n   With no evidence that the Board would actually\nconstrue Article 9 in this surprising way, such remote,\nhypothetical applications do not justify invalidating\nIllinois’s disclosure provisions for facial overbreadth.\nSee Washington State Grange v.

It would be premature for this\ncourt to presume that the Board would disregard the\nobvious limits of the statutory text and seek to\napply Article 9 in such a sweeping fashion.\n   The Center complains that it is too difficult to know\nwhen an “electioneering communication” is “made” on the\nInternet. Timing is important because of the duties that\napply during the 30-day and 60-day windows before\nelections. See 10 ILCS 5/9-1.14(a). The district court and\nthe defendants assert that a communication is “made”\non a website both when it is first posted and while\nit remains available on the website. That is a sensible\nreading, just as a physical billboard is considered a com-\n\fNo. 11-3693                                               57\n\nmunication made by the advertiser as long as it is dis-\nplayed. The Center wonders if it would still be\nresponsible for later communications (within the 30-\nday and 60-day windows) if others copy its ads and\npost them on other websites. If that happens, the Center\nwould not be “making” those later communications\nand would not be responsible for them.\n   We do not anticipate that Article 9 will restrict or chill\na substantial amount of protected speech because\nit treats certain Internet speech as electioneering com-\nmunications. On its face, this element of the statute\nis neither vague nor overbroad.\n\n\n    2. Targeted to the Relevant Electorate\n  Article 9 does not numerically define “target[ing]\nthe relevant electorate” as does FECA, which requires\nthat the communication be capable of being “received by\n50,000 or more persons.” 2 U.S.C. § 434(f)(3)(C). Illinois\nhas good reasons for omitting a number. Its elections\ninvolve much smaller electorates, and it does not have\nan agency like the Federal Communications Commission\nthat would let it monitor how large an audience a\ngiven broadcast reaches. This difference does not\ndefeat Illinois’s substantial interest in informing its elec-\ntorate for the purposes of this facial challenge. In ad-\njudicating facial challenges, federal courts do not\nassume that state officials will construe state law in the\nmost expansive way imaginable. On the contrary, it “is\nreasonable to assume . . . that a state court presented with\na state statute . . . will attempt to construe the statute\n\f58                                                No. 11-3693\n\nconsistently with constitutional requirements.” City of\nAkron v.

Contribution and Expenditure\n  Article 9 defines “contribution” as a “gift . . . or anything\nof value, knowingly received in connection with the\nnomination for election, election, or retention of any\ncandidate or person to or in public office or in connec-\ntion with any question of public policy.” 10 ILCS 5/9-\n1.4(A)(1). “Expenditure” means “gift of money, or\nanything of value, [made] in connection with the nomina-\ntion for election, election, or retention of any person to\nor in public office or in connection with any question\nof public policy.” 10 ILCS 5/9-1.5(A)(1). The “transfer\nof funds by a political committee to another political\ncommittee” automatically qualifies as a contribution (for\nthe transferee) and an expenditure (for the transferor).\n10 ILCS 5/9-1.5(A)(3), 5/9-1.4(A)(3). An expenditure “made\nin cooperation, consultation, or concert with another\n\fNo. 11-3693                                              59\n\npolitical committee” is considered a contribution to that\ncommittee. 10 ILCS 5/9-1.4(A)(5). The Center challenges\nthree aspects of these definitions as unconstitutionally\nvague.\n\n\n    1. In Connection With, Supporting, or Opposing\n  First, the Center argues that the requirement that a\ncontribution or expenditure be “in connection with” an\nelection or ballot initiative is “so vague and broad as to\nprovide no meaningful guidance.” By itself, the “in con-\nnection with” language would be of little help. But as\nthe district court correctly observed, the scope of the\n“contribution” and “expenditure” definitions is further\nlimited by the narrower definition of “political commit-\ntee,” which applies only to contributions or expendi-\ntures that are made “on behalf of or in opposition to a\ncandidate” (for political action committees) or made “with\nthe purpose of securing a place on the ballot for [or]\nadvocating the defeat or passage of . . . the question of\npublic policy” (for ballot initiative committees). 10 ILCS\n5/9-1.8(d), (e). The only regulatory consequence of a\ntransaction qualifying as a contribution or expenditure\nis when it triggers registration requirements for political\ncommittees, so the more circumscribed language in\nthat latter provision is what matters for the vagueness\nanalysis. Following McConnell, we concluded above that\nthe “in support of or opposition” language in the\ndefinition of “ballot initiative committee” is clear enough.\nSee part IV.A.3. The same goes for the “on behalf of or\nin opposition to a candidate” language in the definition\n\f60                                             No. 11-3693\n\nof “political action committee.” All of these definitions\n“give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable\nopportunity to know what is prohibited.” Grayned, 408\nU.S. at 108.\n\n\n     2.   Transfer of Funds from One Political Committee\n          to Another\n  Next, the Center attacks Article 9’s treatment of any\n“transfer of funds by a political committee to another\npolitical committee” as a contribution or expenditure.\nThe Center claims this provision may apply to transfers\nwith groups that qualify as political committees under\nthe statute but have not yet registered, so it requires\npeople “to judge whether a source or recipient of funds\nmay later be judged to have made a $3,000 contribution,\nexpenditure, or otherwise became a political committee.”\nThus, the Center fears, it “could find itself classified as\nan Illinois political committee depending on how regula-\ntors later assess some other group’s speech or other\nactivities that [the Center] could not have known\nabout.” This result seems highly unlikely because it over-\nlooks an important aspect of the transfer of funds provi-\nsions. A transfer counts as a contribution and expendi-\nture only if it is already between two entities that each\nqualify as political committees. See 10 ILCS 5/9-1.4(A)3\nand -1.5(A)(3). That makes sense only if they each\nalready qualify as political committees independent of the\nparticular transfer. The transfer to or from some other\nentity that is a political committee would not make the\nother entity a political committee. (Otherwise, for\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                61\n\nexample, a contractor who produced an ad attacking a\ncandidate for a political committee would itself be trans-\nformed into a political committee.) The mere possibility\nthat the Board might enforce the statute in such an\nunfair way as the Center says it fears is a good example\nof the sort of “hypothetical or imaginary” situation with\nwhich courts do not concern themselves in facial chal-\nlenges. Washington State Grange, 552 U.S. at 450. If the\nBoard sought to enforce Article 9 as the Center says it\nfears, that might well provide a strong basis for an as-\napplied challenge.\n\n\n    3. Coordinated Expenditures\n  Finally, the statute treats as a contribution any “election-\neering communication made in concert or cooperation with\nor at the request, suggestion, or knowledge of a candidate,\na political committee, or any of their agents.” 10 ILCS 5/9-\n1.4(A)(1.5) (emphases added). The Center contends that\nthe italicized words are vague because they do not\nspecify the “degree of actual agreement required.” Since\nbefore Buckley, however, FECA has provided that “ex-\npenditures made by any person in cooperation, consulta-\ntion, or concert, with, or at the request or suggestion of,\na candidate, his authorized political committees, or\ntheir agents, shall be considered to be a contribution to\nsuch candidate.” 2 U.S.C. § 441a(a)(7)(B)(i); see Buckley,\n424 U.S. at 46. With the exception of the word, “knowl-\nedge,” Article 9’s definition of coordination is no less\nclear than the federal definition, which has long passed\nmuster in the Supreme Court. See, e.g., McConnell, 540\n\f62                                              No. 11-3693\n\nU.S. at 219-23. We therefore reject the Center’s argu-\nment that the terms, “in concert or cooperation with,”\n“request,” and “suggestion,” are unconstitutionally vague.\n  As for the word “knowledge,” we agree with the Center\nthat standing alone, it would sweep in a wide range\nof expenditures as coordinated expenditures (and thus\nas indirect contributions to campaign committees). For\ninstance, if a candidate learned that an outside group\nhad produced a favorable TV ad, would the candidate\nhave “knowledge” that the electioneering communica-\ntion was made? This would not be enough to say that\nthe ad was coordinated with the campaign. Recognizing\nthis problem, the district court adopted the limiting\nconstruction that “affirmative acquiescence is required,\nnot mere after the fact knowledge that the advocacy\nhas occurred.” Although we are somewhat puzzled by\nthe phrase “affirmative acquiescence,” we think the\nmain thrust of this limiting construction is sound. Under\nthe canon of noscitur a sociis, the fact that “several items\nin a list share an attribute counsels in favor of inter-\npreting the other items as possessing that attribute as\nwell.” Beecham v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087963\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087963/beecham-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 371 (1994).\nThus, the Illinois legislature’s placement of “knowledge”\nin a series after “request” and “suggestion” indicates\nthat we should interpret the last, more general word, to\nbe similar to its more specific neighbors. 3 2 Both “request”\n\n\n\n32\n  This construction is especially appropriate given that the\n“knowledge” requirement is omitted from an otherwise\n                                               (continued...)\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                       63\n\nand “suggest” necessarily imply actual prior communica-\ntion between the purchaser of the electioneering com-\nmunication and the candidate, committee, or an agent\nthereof. The use of the term “knowledge” is clearly in-\ntended to ensure that coordination cannot be achieved\nby a proverbial “wink and nod,” such as where the sup-\nposedly independent group gives a candidate’s cam-\npaign advance, secret notice of its planned advertising\ncampaign to attack the opponent in a particular way,\nbut without actually drawing an explicit response from\nthe candidate’s campaign.3 3\n  In the context of “request” and “suggest,” the word\n“knowledge” may fairly be construed as requiring\nadvance and non-public communication with the candi-\n\n\n\n(...continued)\nparallel provision of Article 9 defining “independent expendi-\nture.” See 10 ILCS 5/9-1.15 (defining “independent expendi-\nture” as an expenditure for electioneering communication\n“that is not made in connection, consultation, or concert with\nor at the request or suggestion of the public official or\ncandidate, . . ., political committee, . . . campaign, . . . or [any]\nagent [thereof]”).\n33\n   For example, the FEC’s regulations on coordinated expendi-\ntures state that the definition “is not satisfied if the infor-\nmation material to the creation, production, or distribu-\ntion of the communication was obtained from a publicly\navailable source,” but that “[a]greement or formal col-\nlaboration between the person paying for the communica-\ntion and the candidate . . . is not required.” 11 C.F.R.\n§ 109.21(d)(2), (e).\n\f64                                                  No. 11-3693\n\ndate or entity on whose behalf the electioneering com-\nmunication is supposedly made. Where an otherwise\nambiguous provision is readily susceptible to a limiting\nconstruction that cures the vagueness concerns, we\nshould adopt it. See Buckley, 424 U.S. at 77-78 (“Where\nthe constitutional requirement of definiteness is at\nstake, we have the further obligation to construe\nthe statute, if that can be done consistent with the legisla-\nture’s purpose, to avoid the shoals of vagueness.”). Ac-\ncordingly, we interpret “knowledge” in light of its\nadjacent terms and conclude that the coordination lan-\nguage of Article 9 is clear enough to provide a rea-\nsonably intelligent person “fair warning” of what sort\nof conduct is covered. See Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108.\n\n\n     E. Independent Expenditures\n  An “independent expenditure” is an expenditure for\nan electioneering communication or any form of express\nadvocacy that is not coordinated with a candidate\nor a campaign.34 Unlike coordinated expenditures, an\n\n\n\n34\n   Article 9 defines “independent expenditure” as “any payment,\ngift, donation, or expenditure of funds (i) by a natural person\nor political committee for the purpose of making elec-\ntioneering communications or of expressly advocating for or\nagainst the nomination for election, election, retention, or\ndefeat of a clearly identifiable public official or candidate or\nfor or against any question of public policy to be submitted to\nthe voters and (ii) that is not made in connection, consultation,\n                                                   (continued...)\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                    65\n\n“independent expenditure is not considered a contribu-\ntion to a political committee.” 10 ILCS 5/9-8.6(a). When,\nhowever, in a 12-month period a person or organization\nmakes more than $3,000 worth of independent expendi-\ntures “supporting or opposing a public official or candi-\ndate,” 10 ILCS 5/9-8.6, this triggers Article 9’s disclosure\nrequirements.35 The Center contends that the phrase\n“supporting or opposing a public official or candidate” is\nimpermissibly vague because the “supporting or op-\nposing” language is unclear, and because the provision\nappears to apply to advocacy for or against public\nofficials who are not candidates.\n\n\n\n(...continued)\nor concert with or at the request or suggestion of the public\nofficial or candidate, the public official’s or candidate’s desig-\nnated political committee or campaign, or the agent or agents\nof the public official, candidate, or political committee or\ncampaign.” 10 ILCS 5/9-1.15.\n35\n   After exceeding the threshold, any natural person making\nsuch independent expenditures “must file a written disclosure\nwith the State Board of Elections within 2 business days . . .\nidentify[ing] the natural person, the public official or candidate\nsupported or opposed, the date, amount, and nature of each\nindependent expenditure, and the natural person’s occupa-\ntion and employer.” 10 ILCS 5/9-8.6(a). “Any entity other than\na natural person that makes expenditures of any kind in an\naggregate amount exceeding $3,000 during any 12-month\nperiod supporting or opposing a public official or candidate\nmust organize as a political committee” and “report all\nsuch independent expenditures as required under” Article 9.\n10 ILCS 5/9-8.6(b), (c).\n\f66                                                No. 11-3693\n\n  First, the “supporting or opposing” language has no\neffect on the scope or substance of these independent\nexpenditure reporting requirements. Not just any unco-\nordinated campaign-related expenditure is an “independ-\nent expenditure” — only those made either (1) for “elec-\ntioneering communications” or (2) for “expressly ad-\nvocating for or against the . . . election . . . or defeat of a\nclearly identifiable public official or candidate.” 10 ILCS\n5/9-1.15. Recall that a broadcast counts as an elec-\ntioneering communication only if it “refers to a clearly\nidentified candidate” and is “susceptible to no reasonable\ninterpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or\nagainst” that candidate. 10 ILCS 5/9-1.14(a). This\nstandard — as well as the standard for express advocacy —\nis much more demanding than the requirement that ex-\npenditures merely be “supporting or opposing a public\nofficial or candidate.” When the multiple statutory terms\nand definitions are assembled, then, the “supporting or\nopposing” language is redundant and does not render\nthe definition of “independent expenditure” unconstitu-\ntionally vague or overbroad. See Human Life, 624 F.3d at\n1021 (“otherwise imprecise terms may avoid vagueness\nproblems when used in combination with terms that\nprovide sufficient clarity”), quoting Gammoh v. City of\nLa Habra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1114</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1120 (9th Cir. 2005).\n  As for the phrase “public official,” we agree with the\nCenter that a strictly literal interpretation of the provi-\nsion would include independent expenditures made for\n“expressly advocating for or against the . . . election\nor defeat of a clearly identifiable public official” who is\nnot currently a candidate, but who may run for re-election\n\fNo. 11-3693                                               67\n\nin some future year.3 6 It is clear, however, from both\nthe text of this section and Article 9 as a whole, which\nrepeatedly refers to incumbent candidates as “public\nofficials,” that the legislature intended the phrase “public\nofficial” in section 9-8.6 to mean a public official who\nis also a candidate. That is the limiting construction\nthe district court adopted, and it is a sound one. So nar-\nrowed, the provision of Article 9 imposing disclosure\nrequirements for “independent expenditures” is not\nvague or overly broad.\n\n\n                         Conclusion\n  “Whatever differences may exist about interpretations\nof the First Amendment, there is practically universal\nagreement that a major purpose of that Amendment was\nto protect the free discussion of governmental affairs.\nThis of course includes discussions of candidates, . . . and\nall such matters relating to political processes.” Mills v.\nAlabama, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107235\"><a href=\"/opinion/107235/mills-v-alabama/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 218-19 (1966).

We also take\nthe Center at its word that its donors are so adamant\nabout remaining anonymous that subjecting it to the\nIllinois reporting requirements will deter it from\nengaging in its preferred form of public advocacy. That\nis regrettable, but it is the Center’s and its donors’ choice\nto make. As Justice Scalia has written, participation in\nthe political process takes “civic courage, without which\ndemocracy is doomed.” Doe v. Reed, 130 S. Ct. at 2837\n(Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment). While there is\nalso a “respected tradition of anonymity in the advocacy\nof political causes” in this country, see McIntyre, 514\nU.S. at 343, that tradition does not mean voters must\nremain in the dark about “who is speaking about a candi-\ndate shortly before an election.” Citizens United, 130 S.

Cir. 2010) (en banc).\n  Illinois regulates what it calls “political committees,” and\nthe term includes not only partisan committees but\nalso any independent organization or individual that\n“accepts contributions or makes expenditures during\nany 12-month period in an aggregate amount ex-\nceeding $3000 on behalf of or in opposition to a candidate\nor candidates for public office” or “in support of or in\nopposition to any question of public policy to be\nsubmitted to the electors,” or that “makes electioneering\ncommunications,” exceeding the monetary threshold,\nthat are “related to” a candidate or to a question of\npublic policy. 10 ILCS 5/9-1.8(d), (e). A “contribution” is\namong other things “anything of value that constitutes\nan electioneering communication made in concert or\ncooperation with or at the request, suggestion, or knowl-\nedge of a candidate, a political committee, or any of their\nagents,” or “a transfer of funds received by a political\ncommittee from another political committee.” 10 ILCS 5/9-\n1.4(A)(1.5), (3). An “expenditure” is anything of\nvalue given “in connection with the nomination for\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                71\n\nelection, election, or retention of any person to or in\npublic office,” 10 ILCS 5/9-1.5(A)(1), or “that constitutes\nan electioneering communication made in concert or\ncooperation with or at the request, suggestion, or knowl-\nedge of a candidate, a political committee, or any of\ntheir agents.” 10 ILCS 5/9-1.5(A)(2). And finally an “elec-\ntioneering communication” is any broadcast, cable,\nsatellite, or Internet communication that refers to a\n“clearly identified candidate,” “clearly identified\npolitical party,” or “clearly identified question of public\npolicy that will appear on the ballot,” provided that\nthe communication is made within 60 days before a\ngeneral election or 30 days before a primary election,\nis “targeted to the relevant electorate,” and “is sus-\nceptible to no reasonable interpretation other than as an\nappeal to vote for or against a clearly identified candi-\ndate…or a question of public policy.” 10 ILCS 5/9-1.14(a).\n  A political committee must register with the Illinois\nBoard of Elections, 10 ILCS 5/9-3(a), and file quarterly\nreports that open its finances to public scrutiny. For each\nreport must reveal “all financial activity,” as the state\nwebsite puts it (Illinois State Board of Elections, “Political\nCommittee Report Filing Forms,” http://elections.il.gov/\nCampaignDisclosure/PoliticalCommittee.aspx (visited\nAug. 23, 2012)), in the previous quarter—must reveal\nthe total contributions it received, along with all other\nreceipts, and the total expenditures it made, including\ninvestments and loans; along with the names, addresses,\nand other identifying details of donors, and of recipients\nof the committee’s expenditures. 10 ILCS 5/9-10(b), -11(a).\n\f72                                                No. 11-3693\n\n   Having to disclose the names of donors is the most\nonerous requirement that the statute imposes on a\npolitical committee because many donors don’t want to\nbe publicly identified as contributing to an organiza-\ntion engaged in public advocacy regarding issues of\npublic policy, which usually are controversial. Indeed CIF\nalleges without contradiction that its donors require\nassurances that their identities will not be disclosed, and\nthat this anonymity is a condition of their support. So CIF\nvery much does not want to be classified as a political com-\nmittee and one way to avoid that fate is to avoid any\nactivity that might, even if there is no certainty that\nit would, require CIF to register.\n   The vagueness of a number of key provisions of the\nIllinois law is therefore worrisome. A vague statute\ncan deter lawful activity. Cautious persons will want\nto avoid even a small probability of being found to\nhave violated it, and the safest way to do that is to\navoid lawful activity that is just across the line from\nthe unlawful—to create a buffer zone around the\nstatutory core, just as cautious men decide not to have\nsex with young-looking women who probably are not\nbelow the age of consent but may be. When the lawful\nactivity likely to be deterred by a vague statute is not\nextramarital sex but the exercise of free speech—a right\nat the apex of modern constitutional solicitude—a\nfinding of vagueness is apt to doom the statute.

Stenberg v. Carhart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118387\"><a href=\"/opinion/118387/stenberg-v-carhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">914</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 944-45 (2000). That\nrisk will in turn operate as a deterrent to the advocacy\ngroup’s relying on the federal court’s interpretation.\nWith an election looming, advocacy groups can’t\nwait for the Supreme Court of Illinois to interpret\nall the vague provisions of the election statute in cases\ninstituted in the state court system that are likely to\ntake years to reach and be decided by the state’s highest\ncourt.\n  These are the vague provisions:\n  1. A transfer of funds from a political committee to\na political committee qualifies as a contribution re-\ngardless of amount. A political committee must report\nall receipts, not just contributions as defined by the\nstatute, see 10 ILCS 5/9-11(a)(10), and in addition must\nreport “the name and address of each political commit-\ntee from which the reporting committee received, or to\nwhich that committee made, any transfer of funds.”\n10 ILCS 5/9-11(a)(6). So if by virtue of other contributions\nor other activities CIF were to be classified as a political\ncommittee, it would have to identify any other political\ncommittees from which it received money. It might not\nknow a donor was a political committee, and that would\n\f74                                             No. 11-3693\n\nbe no defense, because the statute does not require knowl-\nedge or even suspicion that the transferor is a political\ncommittee—there is no state of mind requirement at\nall. The transferee would have to investigate the\nfinancial activity of each donor (including an individual,\nwho as a “natural person” can constitute a political com-\nmittee) to determine whether the donor was a political\ncommittee. It might be a committee that had improperly\nfailed to register; that would be no defense. Yet it would\nbe afraid to list a donor as a political committee\nunless confident that it was one, as otherwise it might\nget into trouble with the donor. Damned if it does,\ndamned if it doesn’t.\n  An unregistered entity doesn’t have to disclose its\ncontributions and expenditures, so it would rarely be\nclear whether an entity qualified as a political committee.\nVery little of the information required to determine\nthe status of a donor is public. This is an additional\nreason why advocacy groups like CIF might forgo dona-\ntions from unfamiliar donors. But by reducing the\ngroup’s resources, this cautious response to the\nvagueness of the statute would curtail its advocacy.\n  An alternative reading of the “transfer of funds” provi-\nsion is that receipt of money from a political committee\nmakes the recipient a political committee. Illinois may\nhave been concerned that interest groups would\ntransfer money in chains ending with a committee that\ndidn’t have to register; to target those chains and thus\nclose a potential loophole in the statute, the Illinois\ncourts might read the statute to reach all members of the\n\fNo. 11-3693                                               75\n\nchain. This interpretation would have an even greater\ntendency to discourage an advocacy group from\naccepting donations from unfamiliar individuals or\norganizations.\n   2. Any “electioneering communication” made with the\n“knowledge” of a candidate is an expenditure that if\nit exceeds the low statutory threshold makes the\nadvertiser a political committee. The word “knowledge”\ncan’t be interpreted to require that the advertiser have\ncommunicated with the candidate, because knowledge\ncan be acquired in other ways. My colleagues think the\nIllinois courts would interpret the word “knowledge,”\nwhich appears at the end of the sequence “request, sug-\ngestion, and knowledge,” to mean the same thing as\nthe two preceding words because it is the “more\ngeneral word.” But it’s no more general than the other\nwords; the three words are simply different from one\nanother. It’s not like a statute that refers to “automobiles,\ntrucks, tractors, motorcycles, and other motor-powered\nvehicles”; in that sequence “motor-powered vehicles” is\nindeed more general than the itemized examples, but\npresumably not intended to be so encompassing a\ncatchall as to include airplanes, since all the preceding\nterms in the sequence denote different forms of land-\nbased transportation. Cf. McBoyle v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101695\"><a href=\"/opinion/101695/mcboyle-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1931) (Holmes, J.).\n  So an organization that wanted to avoid crossing\nthe $3000 threshold would if cautious refrain from broad-\ncasting ads entirely, rather than just avoid coordinating\ntheir ads with the candidate.\n\f76                                            No. 11-3693\n\n  The district judge was troubled by this provision and\nto save it interpreted “knowledge” to mean “affirmative\nacquiescence.” But what does that mean? That the candi-\ndate was delighted to learn of an ad that praised him\nor a policy he was pushing?\n  3. If an “electioneering communication” is deemed to be\n“made” whenever a user accesses a website, cf. Flava\nWorks, Inc. v. Gunter, No. 11-3190, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3124826</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7\n(7th Cir. Aug. 2, 2012), then even an appeal to vote that\nis posted more than 30 or 60 days before the election\n(depending on whether it is a primary or a general elec-\ntion) will constitute an expenditure that, if it exceeds\nthe modest threshold in the statute, will make the com-\nmunicator a political committee and thus require it to\nregister. A television advertiser controls the dates on\nwhich his ad is shown; but an Internet ad or web posting\nremains online and accessible until removed. The ad-\nvertiser may delete the ad from his website, but it may\nalready have been copied and posted on a hundred other\nwebsites. Should the advertiser be thought to be con-\ntinuing to make an electioneering communication by\nfailing to ensure that his ad posted during the safe\nharbor periods is no longer accessible to voters? And\nhow can he do that? On these critical questions, the\nstatute is silent. The only sure way to avoid having to\nregister as a political committee is therefore to avoid\nendorsing an Illinois candidate online at any time.\n  The Illinois courts might interpret “made” to refer only\nto the original posting of the ad. But this would open up\na loophole; the advocacy group might have posted the\n\fNo. 11-3693                                                77\n\nad shortly before the 30- or 60-day cutoff and deleted it\njust before the cutoffs, confident that the campaign\nfavored by the ad would copy it and post it so that it\nwould be seen right up to election day. Because the\nstate courts might well decide to close this loophole by\ninterpreting “made” to include the initial posting, advo-\ncacy groups would be running a legal risk by posting\nonline ads even long before the date of the election, and\nmight therefore be deterred from doing so.\n   4. Any payment “in connection with” an election (in-\ncluding payment for ads) counts as an expenditure. “In\nconnection with” could apply to communications not\nmade for the purpose of influencing the election, such as\nspeech on issues of policy that happen to be salient\nin the campaign. An advocacy group might intend\nits message to reach a wider audience. It might even\nbe advocating a position embraced by neither candidate.\nDisclosure of such a group’s finances would not be\nclosely related to the state’s interest in informing the\nelectorate about a candidate’s supporters. Yet the\nstatute may require it.\n   Speech can have all sorts of connections to an election:\nit may mention an election, describe a candidate and his\npositions, or simply refer to a policy that is at issue in the\ncampaign. A dry discussion of economic indicators\nmight be seen as being “in connection with” an election\nin which the main issue was economic policy. Because\ndisclosure requirements are not constitutionally limited\nto express advocacy for a candidate, see Citizens United\nv. Federal Election Commission, supra, 130 S. Ct. at 915,\n\f78                                             No. 11-3693\n\nthere is no telling how far Illinois’s definition reaches\ninto the realm of issue advocacy. Once again, to be sure\nof not having to register, an organization like CIF\nmight decide to avoid speaking about any policy issues\nduring election campaigns. It might go silent during\ncampaigns.\n  5. Expenditures made “in connection with” an elec-\ntion count towards the $3000 threshold for registering\nonly if they are made “on behalf of or in opposition to”\na candidate, and that might seem to take care of the\nconcerns I just expressed with respect to “in connection\nwith.” But speech supporting or opposing a policy associ-\nated with a candidate could be seen as being on behalf\nof or in opposition to that candidate, especially if the\npolicy is the candidate’s signature issue. The term thus\ndoes not clearly exclude most issue advocacy, and\ngroups such as CIF might therefore avoid speaking\non issues that could be associated with a particular candi-\ndate. Imagine a single-issue candidate: a songbird en-\nthusiast, he wants the owners of cats to be forbidden\nto allow their pets out of doors, since cats, indifferent\nto avian beauty and melody, kill birds for food and\nsport. If the humane society buys ads that declare its\npassionate support for the songbirds, isn’t there a sense\nin which it is advocating for the election of the song-\nbirds’ candidate and therefore making an expenditure on\nhis behalf and in opposition to his opponent? Or should\n“on behalf of” be interpreted to mean motivated by a\ndesire to help the candidate rather than the cause the\ncandidate supports? Who knows?\n\fNo. 11-3693                                              79\n\n  McConnell v. Federal Election Commission, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n170 n. 64 (2003), overruled on other grounds in Citizens\nUnited v. Federal Election Commission, supra, held that a\nfederal law that contained the words “promotes,” “sup-\nports,” “attacks,” and “opposes” was not vague; and the\nphrase “on behalf of or in opposition to” is similar. But\nthe federal law involved speech referring to particular\ncandidates and made by state political parties the\nactions of which are presumed to be coordinated with\ncandidates. The Illinois law applies to all who want to\nspeak on public issues but furnishes no clue to how\nrelated to a candidate’s position their speech must be to\ntrigger the disclosure requirements. The statute is not\nlimited to groups that coordinate their activity with a\ncandidate or expressly advocate for him. And it is not, as\nin the counterpart federal statute, 2 U.S.C. § 431(8)(A)(i),\nlimited to speech made “for the purpose of influencing”\nan election, since there is no state of mind limitation in\nthe Illinois statute, so no basis for using purposiveness\nto limit relatedness.\n   The more arbitrary the meaning that must be assigned\nto a state statute to avoid constitutional problems, the\nless confident we can be that the state courts would adopt\nit. If independent advocacy groups share these doubts,\ncaution may make them steer well clear of the statutory\nconditions for having to register as a political committee,\nwith all the burdens entailed by registration.\n  When the five vague statutory provisions that I have\nbeen discussing are considered in combination, it be-\ncomes apparent that their cumulative effect on advocacy\nby CIF and similar organizations could be considerable.\n\f80                                              No. 11-3693\n\nTo avoid the burden of registration, such groups may\ntake measures to curb their advocacy even if those mea-\nsures may not in fact (that is, in law) be required in order\nto avoid having to register. That is the vice of vague-\nness—that it causes an organization or an individual\nto give a law a wide berth, in this instance by forgoing\nconstitutionally protected speech. We should insist,\nin the name of the First Amendment, that the Illinois\nlegislature speak with greater clarity.\n\n\n\n\n                           9-10-12\n\f</pre>",
