After a jury trial and several post-trial\n\nhearings, the trial court entered a decree of divorce dividing the couple's property and\n\nestablishing custody for the couple's one minor child. By fifteen issues, Robert argues\n\fthat: the evidence did not support the jury's findings on various questions; the form in\n\nwhich certain questions were submitted to the jury was erroneous; the trial court erred in\n\nholding post-trial evidentiary hearings and entering various aspects of the divorce decree\n\nbased on the evidence presented at those hearings; and the trial court erred in refusing to\n\nfile findings of fact and conclusions of law. By six cross-issues, Monica challenges:\n\nvarious determinations by the jury and trial court concerning the characterization of\n\ncertain marital property, the prenuptial agreement, and custody; the valuation of Monica's\n\nseparate property; and the division of property as inequitably disproportionate. We\n\naffirm, in part, and reverse and remand, in part.\n\n                                     I. Background\n\n       Robert and Monica were married in 1994. Prior to the marriage, the couple\n\nsigned an \"Agreement in Contemplation of Marriage,\" in which they agreed that \"all\n\nincome or revenue . . . from the parties' separate property, as designated in . . . Schedules\n\nA and B of this agreement, be and remain the separate property of the the party whose\n\nseparate estate causes the income to be generated.\" Two documents were attached to\n\nthe agreement: one document (which although not labeled, was clearly meant to be\n\n\"Schedule A\") purported to list Robert's separate property; the other document\n\n(\"Schedule B\") purported to list Monica's separate property.\n\n       In May 2005, stating that the marriage \"has become insupportable because of\n\ndiscord or conflict of personalities . . . that destroys the legitimate ends of the marriage\n\nrelationship and prevents any reasonable expectation of reconciliation,\" Monica\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\fpetitioned for divorce. Robert counter-petitioned for divorce, citing the same grounds.1\n\n        In November 2006, the case was tried to a jury, which was questioned on:\n\ncustody of Monica and Robert's one minor child; the amount of reimbursement, if any,\n\nowed to the community estate against Robert's house in McAllen, Texas; attorneyâ€™s and\n\nad litem's fees; the value of the community property and the separate property of each\n\nspouse; the characterization as community or separate of an heirloom engagement ring\n\nand two AG Edwards accounts; and the value of the ring and the AG Edwards accounts.\n\nThe jury found that Robert and Monica should be appointed joint managing conservators\n\nand that Monica should have the \"exclusive right to designate the primary residence of\n\nthe child\" \"without regard to geographic location.\" In response to the reimbursement\n\nquestion, the jury found that $25,000 was \"the amount of the reimbursement\n\nclaim . . . proved in favor of the community estate [of Robert and Monica] against\n\n[Robert]'s residence located [in] McAllen.\" The jury awarded neither party any attorneys'\n\nfees and found that Robert and Monica were each responsible for fifty percent of the ad\n\nlitem fees.       Jury questions nine through eleven involved the characterization and\n\nvaluation of the community and separate property estates. The jury valued the heirloom\n\nring at $10,000; AG Edwards Account Number xxxx-5657-xxxx (AG Edwards #5657) at\n\n$74,000; and AG Edwards Account Number xxxx-5621-xxxx (AG Edwards #5621) at\n\n$130,000. 2       The jury characterized the heirloom ring as 100% Monica's separate\n\nproperty; AG Edwards #5657 as 80% Robert's separate property and 20% community\n\n\n        1\n           Monica also stated as grounds for divorce \"cruel treatment [by Robert] . . . that renders further\nliving together insupportable.\"\n        2\n            The valuation of the ring and two AG Edwards accounts was included in jury question eleven.\n                                                     3\n\fproperty; and AG Edwards #5621 as 100% community property. 3 The jury then valued\n\nthe community and separate estates as follows:                    $144,800 as community property;\n\n$10,000 as Monica's separate property; and $59,200 as Robert's separate property.4\n\n       After the jury trial and over the next couple of years, the trial court held a series of\n\nhearings dealing with various topics such as possession of the couple's child and the\n\ndivision of further community property that was not submitted to the jury for\n\ncharacterization and valuation. The divorce decree, which was entered on July 23,\n\n2009, therefore embodied both the jury's verdict and various findings made by the court\n\nafter trial concerning custody and the additional property.\n\n       The decree appointed Robert and Monica joint managing conservators of their\n\nchild and ordered that Monica is the conservator with the right to designate and establish\n\nthe child's primary residence without regard to geographic restriction. The decree set\n\nout Robert and Monica's rights and duties as joint managing conservators and entered\n\npossession orders for the child regarding weekends, spring break, summer, and holidays.\n\nThe decree ordered Robert to pay child support and set out the parties' responsibilities\n\nregarding various aspects of child care such as educational and health care expenses\n\nand medical notification.\n\n       Next, the decree divided the property from what the court characterized as the\n\n\"marital\" estate. The decree awarded the following \"marital\" property to Monica: the\n\njury's $25,000 reimbursement verdict; $72,400 as her portion of the community property\n\nverdict; personal property from the community estate valued at approximately $42,000; a\n\n       3\n           The characterization of the property was included in jury question ten.\n       4\n           The valuation of the community and separate estates was included in jury question nine.\n                                                      4\n\f$25,000 judgment as her portion of the community estate's personal property that was\n\nindicated to be sold5; and two Texas State Bank accounts, one International Bank of\n\nCommerce account, and two AG Edwards accounts, the values of which were not listed in\n\nthe decree.6 The decree awarded the following \"marital\" property to Robert: $72,400 as\n\nhis portion of the jury's community property verdict; personal property from the community\n\nestate valued at approximately $170,000; the remainder of the personal property\n\nindicated to be sold, which was valued at $242,707.95 after subtracting the $25,000\n\njudgment owed to Monica; two Texas State Bank accounts, the values of which were not\n\nlisted in the decree; and all of the additional accounts listed in \"Exhibit D\" to the decree,\n\nthe listed values for which accounts totaled approximately $516,000.7\n\n        The decree ordered that Robert and Monica were each fifty percent responsible for\n\nthe community estate's approximate $20,000 debt; the decree further ordered that Robert\n\nwas to reimburse Monica $968 for medical expenses incurred during the divorce and was\n\nresponsible for the balance due on the 2004 F-250 truck he was awarded as part of his\n\nportion of the community property. Finally, the decree confirmed the jury's verdict on the\n\n        5\n            The property to be sold was listed in \"Exhibit C\" to the decree and was valued at $267,707.95.\n        6\n        The \"marital\" property awarded to Monica, with values ascertainable by the decree, totaled\napproximately $164,000.\n        7\n          The value we state for Exhibit D represents the total for those accounts with definite amounts\nincluded in the exhibit. In addition, Exhibit D listed seven accounts with \"pending value[s].\" We did not\ninclude these values in our approximate total for Exhibit D. As discussed further in the opinion, it appears\nfrom the testimony and evidence that some of accounts listed in Exhibit D are closed; are not owned by\nRobert and Monica but rather by other family members; or are merely alternate account numbers for\naccounts covered by the prenuptial agreement or accounts submitted to the jury for characterization and\nvaluation.\n         The decree also awarded Robert the real property in McAllen, Texas, which the decree\ncharacterized as \"marital\" property and the value of which was not included in the decree. However, the\nparties appear to agree that the house and acreage at this address was Robert's separate property.\n       The \"marital\" property awarded to Robert, with values ascertainable by the decree, totaled\napproximately $1,001,000.\n                                                      5\n\fcouples' separate property, awarding Monica $10,000 and Robert $59,200 pursuant to\n\njury questions nine, ten, and eleven.\n\n       Robert requested that the trial court file findings of fact and conclusions of law,\n\nwhich the trial court did not do. Both Robert and Monica filed motions for new trial, which\n\nwere overruled by operation of law. This appeal followed.\n\n                 II. Submission of Reimbursement Question to Jury\n\n       By his fourth issue, Robert argues that the trial court erred in submitting question\n\nfive to the jury, which asked the jury to \"[s]tate in dollars the amount of the reimbursement\n\nclaim, if any proved in favor of the community estate.\" (Emphasis omitted.) Robert\n\nargues that because Monica did not plead a claim for reimbursement, the trial court erred\n\nin questioning the jury on this theory.\n\n       We review the trial court's submission of jury questions for an abuse of discretion.\n\nTex. Dep't of Human Servs. v. E.B., 802 S.W.2d 647, 649 (Tex. 1990). The trial court's\n\ndiscretion is subject only to the requirement that the question must control the disposition\n\nof the case, be raised by the pleadings and the evidence, and properly submit the\n\ndisputed issues for the jury's determination. Harris County v. Smith, 96 S.W.3d 230, 236\n\n(Tex. 2002); see TEX. R. CIV. P. 278.\n\n       A claim for reimbursement involves the community estate being reimbursed for the\n\nvalue of time and effort expended by either spouse to enhance the separate estate of\n\neither. See Jensen v. Jensen, 665 S.W.3d 107, 109 (Tex. 1984); see also generally TEX.\n\nFAM. CODE ANN. Â§ 3.402 (West Supp. 2011). In the \"Division of Community Property\"\n\nportion of her petition for divorce, Monica states that she \"should be awarded a\n\n\n                                             6\n\fdisproportionate share of the parties['] estate\" for, among other reasons, the \"[i]ncrease in\n\nvalue of separate property through community efforts by time, talent, labor and effort.\"\n\n       While Rule 278 requires that, for a party to obtain a requested jury\n       instruction, there must be both pleadings and evidence to support the\n       instruction, [] the rule does not mean that the pleading must be exact or\n       perfect. A pleading should contain a short statement of the cause of action\n       sufficient to give fair notice of the claim involved . . . . In the absence of\n       special exceptions, the petition is construed liberally in favor of the pleader.\n       Courts should uphold the petition as to a cause of action if it can be\n       reasonably inferred from what is specifically stated . . . .\n\nGutierrez v. People's Mgmt. of Tex. I, Ltd., 277 S.W.3d 72, 79 (Tex. App.â€”El Paso 2009,\n\npet. denied) (internal citations and quotations omitted).       Monica's pleadings, which\n\nreferenced the benefit to Robert's separate property of her \"time, talent, labor and effort,\"\n\nwere sufficient to give fair notice of her reimbursement claim. Because Robert did not\n\nfile special exceptions, the trial court was allowed to liberally construe Monica's\n\npleadings, and it did not abuse its discretion in submitting a question to the jury on\n\nreimbursement. Robert's fourth issue is overruled.\n\n                            III. Evidence of Reimbursement\n\n       By his second, third, and fifth issues, Robert challenges the evidence supporting\n\nthe jury's answer to question five on reimbursement.           Robert argues that Monica\n\npresented no evidence at trial regarding any increase to the value of Robert's house as a\n\nresult of her \"time, talent, labor, and effort.\" He further argues that the evidence relevant\n\nto reimbursement admitted at trial showed only that Monica engaged in normal\n\nmaintenance and upkeep of the house, which would not support a claim for\n\nreimbursement. For these reasons, Robert argues that the evidence supporting the\n\n$25,000 reimbursement to the community estate was both legally and factually\n\n                                              7\n\finsufficient and that the trial court erred in including the reimbursement in the divorce\n\ndecree.\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\n       The party complaining of the trial court's division of property must demonstrate\n\nfrom evidence in the record that the division was so unjust that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion. Pletcher v. Goetz, 9 S.W.3d 442, 446 (Tex. App.â€”Fort Worth 1999, pet.\n\ndenied) (op. on reh'g).    Under an abuse of discretion standard, legal and factual\n\nsufficiency are relevant factors in assessing whether the trial court abused its discretion.\n\nBeaumont Bank v. Buller, 806 S.W.2d 223, 226 (Tex. 1991). They are not independent\n\ngrounds of error. Ditraglia v. Romano, 33 S.W.3d 886, 889 (Tex. App.â€”Austin 2000, no\n\npet.); Crawford v. Hope, 898 S.W.2d 937, 940 (Tex. App.â€”Amarillo 1995, writ denied).\n\nIf there is any reasonable basis for doing so, we must presume that the trial court\n\nexercised its discretion properly. Pletcher, 9 S.W.3d at 446. We will not disturb the trial\n\ncourt's division unless the record demonstrates \"that the division was clearly the result of\n\nan abuse of discretion.\" Id. That is, we will not reverse the case unless the record\n\nclearly shows that the trial court was acting arbitrarily or unreasonably and that the trial\n\ncourt's error materially affected the just and right division of the estate. See Downer v.\n\nAquamarine Operators, Inc., 701 S.W.2d 238, 241-42 (Tex. 1985); Chavez v. Chavez,\n\n269 S.W.3d 763, 766 (Tex. App.â€”Dallas 2008, no pet.).\n\n       When an appellant attacks the legal sufficiency of an adverse finding on an issue\n\nfor which it did not have the burden of proof, the appellant must demonstrate that there is\n\nno evidence to support the adverse finding. City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802,\n\n\n                                             8\n\f810 (Tex. 2005); Croucher v. Croucher, 660 S.W.2d 55, 58 (Tex. 1983).                Such a\n\nno-evidence challenge will be sustained only if: (1) there is a complete absence of\n\nevidence of a vital fact; (2) the court is barred by rules of law or of evidence from giving\n\nweight to the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact; (3) the evidence offered to prove\n\na vital fact is no more than a mere scintilla; or (4) the evidence establishes conclusively\n\nthe opposite of a vital fact. City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 810; King Ranch, Inc. v.\n\nChapman, 118 S.W.3d 742, 751 (Tex. 2003) (quoting Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc. v.\n\nHavner, 953 S.W.2d 706, 711 (Tex. 1997)). In conducting a legal sufficiency review, we\n\nreview the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict and\n\nindulge every reasonable inference that would support it, crediting favorable evidence if\n\nreasonable jurors could and disregarding contrary evidence unless reasonable jurors\n\ncould not. Del Lago Partners, Inc. v. Smith, 307 S.W.3d 762, 770 (Tex. 2010); City of\n\nKeller, 168 S.W.3d at 822, 827.\n\n       In reviewing a factual-sufficiency challenge to a jury finding on an issue on which\n\nthe appellant did not have the burden of proof, we consider and weigh all of the evidence\n\nand set aside the verdict only if the evidence that supports the jury finding is so weak as to\n\nmake the verdict clearly wrong and manifestly unjust. Cain v. Bain, 709 S.W.2d 175, 176\n\n(Tex. 1986) (per curiam); Ins. Network of Tex. v. Kloesel, 266 S.W.3d 456, 469-70 (Tex.\n\nApp.â€”Corpus Christi 2008, pet. denied); Bay, Inc. v. Ramos, 139 S.W.3d 322, 329 (Tex.\n\nApp.â€”San Antonio 2004, pet. denied) (en banc). In a factual-sufficiency challenge, we\n\nmust examine both the evidence supporting and that contrary to the judgment. See Dow\n\nChem. Co., 46 S.W.3d at 242; Plas-Tex, Inc. v. U.S. Steel Corp., 772 S.W.2d 442, 445\n\n\n                                              9\n\f(Tex. 1989). Additionally, the jury is the sole judge of witnesses' credibility, and it may\n\nchoose to believe one witness over another; a reviewing court may not impose its own\n\nopinion to the contrary. See Golden Eagle Archery, Inc. v. Jackson, 116 S.W.3d 757,\n\n761 (Tex. 2003).\n\nB. Applicable Law\n\n       \"A right of reimbursement arises when the funds or assets of one estate are used\n\nto benefit and enhance another estate without itself receiving some benefit.\" Vallone v.\n\nVallone, 644 S.W.2d 455, 459 (Tex. 1982) (citation omitted). \"[I]t also arises when\n\ncommunity time, talent and labor are utilized to benefit and enhance a spouse's separate\n\nestate, beyond whatever care, attention, and expenditure are necessary for the proper\n\nmaintenance and preservation of the separate estate, without the community receiving\n\nadequate compensation.\" Id. The party claiming reimbursement bears the burden of\n\nestablishing the net benefit to the payee estate. Id.\n\n       Reimbursement includes \"capital improvements to property other than by incurring\n\ndebt.\" TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. Â§ 3.402(a)(8) (West Supp. 2011). \"Reimbursement for\n\nfunds expended by a marital estate for improvements to another marital estate shall be\n\nmeasured by the enhancement in value to the benefited marital estate.\" Id. Â§ 3.402(d).\n\nThe enhanced value of the separate property is determined by the difference between the\n\nfair market value before and after any improvements made by the community during the\n\nmarriage.\" Anderson v. Gilliland, 684 S.W.2d 673, 675 (Tex. 1985). The enhancement\n\nvalue is not determined by the actual costs expended by the community estate. Zeptner\n\nv. Zeptner, 111 S.W.3d 727, 737 (Tex. App.â€”Fort Worth 2003, no pet.) (citing Anderson,\n\n\n                                            10\n\f684 S.W.2d at 675) (other citations omitted).\n\nC. Analysis\n\n       At trial, Monica testified that when she and Robert moved into Robert's house\n\nshortly after the beginning of their marriage, the house was essentially a hunting cabin or\n\nlodge. She then described in detail the efforts she made during the marriage to improve\n\nthe house, including renovating the kitchen, bathrooms, bedroom, and living room. In\n\nconnection with those improvements, Monica admitted into evidence various receipts\n\nfrom furniture stores and other retailers detailing items she had purchased for the house,\n\nincluding couches, beds, dining room furniture, and playground equipment.\n\n       However, having reviewed the record, we find no testimony or other evidence at\n\ntrial about the value of the house either before or after the improvements made by\n\nMonica. And it is the enhancement to the value of the house, not the costs paid by the\n\ncommunity estate, that are the relevant and proper measurement of a reimbursement\n\nclaim. See id.; see also Vickery, 999 S.W.2d at 371. In other words, although Monica\n\ngave detailed descriptions of the improvements she made to Robert's house, her\n\ntestimony and the receipts she admitted were, alone, insufficient evidence of the\n\ndifference in market value of the house before and after the improvements, and without\n\nevidence of any increase in value, there was a complete absence of evidence of a vital\n\nfact necessary to the reimbursement claim. See City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 810; King\n\nRanch, Inc., 118 S.W.3d at 751. In short, Monica did not meet her burden to establish\n\nthe benefit of the community's efforts to Robert's separate estate. See Vallone, 644\n\nS.W.2d at 459. Thus, even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict\n\n\n                                            11\n\fand indulging every reasonable inference in favor of it, we still cannot conclude the jury's\n\n$25,000 reimbursement verdict was supported by legally sufficient evidence as there was\n\nsimply no evidence at trial supporting that dollar amount. Del Lago Partners, Inc., 307\n\nS.W.3d at 770; City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 822, 827. And because the reimbursement\n\nclaim was not supported by legally sufficient evidence, the trial court erred in awarding\n\nMonica the reimbursement verdict in the divorce decree. This $25,000 award to Monica\n\nmaterially affected the just and right division of the estate, and as such, the trial court's\n\nerror was a clear abuse of discretion. See Pletcher, 9 S.W.3d at 446; see also Chavez,\n\n269 S.W.3d at 766. Robert's second, third, and fifth issues are sustained.8\n\n                    IV. Characterization and Valuation of Stock Accounts\n\n        By his tenth, eleventh, and twelfth issues,9 Robert argues that the trial court erred\n\nin entering judgment on the jury's answers to questions ten and eleven, which asked the\n\njury to characterize two AG Edwards stock accounts as community or separate property\n\nand assign a dollar value to the accounts, respectively. By these issues, Robert argues\n\nboth that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury's answers to questions ten and\n\neleven and that \"it was improper and error for the [trial court] to enter [into the divorce\n\ndecree the] monetary amounts\" awarded by the jury \"instead of percentage values.\"\n\n        In its answer to question ten, the jury characterized the first AG Edwards\n\naccountâ€”AG Edwards #5657â€”as eighty percent Robert's separate property and twenty\n\npercent community property; the jury characterized the second AG Edwards\n        8\n           Having sustained Robert's second, third, and fifth issues on the basis of legally insufficient\nevidence of enhancement to value, we need address neither his argument that the evidence was factually\ninsufficient nor his argument that Monica's efforts in improving the house amounted only to normal\nmaintenance and upkeep. See TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1.\n        9\n            In his original brief, these issues were Robert's eleventh, thirteenth, and fifteenth issues.\n                                                       12\n\faccountâ€”AG Edwards #5621â€”as one-hundred percent community property.                     In its\n\nanswer to question eleven, the jury valued AG Edwards #5657 at $74,000, and the jury\n\nvalued AG Edwards #5621 at $130,000.\n\n       As to Robert's argument that the jury's answer to question ten is supported by\n\ninsufficient evidence, he provides no legal authority regarding the characterization of\n\nproperty in a divorce, record citations, or substantive analysis applying the law to the facts\n\nof this case. As such, this argument is inadequately briefed and waived. See TEX. R.\n\nAPP. P. 38.1(i); Graves v. Tomlinson, 329 S.W.3d 128, 162 (Tex. App.â€”Houston [14th\n\nDist.] 2010, pet. denied).\n\n       As to Robert's argument that the jury's answer to question eleven is supported by\n\ninsufficient evidence, we have reviewed the relevant evidence presented at trial.\n\nFinancial statements for the two accounts were admitted at trial as evidence. The\n\nstatement for AG Edwards #5657 showed a current value of $63,134.32; the statement\n\nshowed the initial cost for opening the account to be $73,981.93. The statement for AG\n\nEdwards #5621 showed a current value of $156,173.60; the statement showed the initial\n\ncost for opening the account to be $129,952.12. Based on the foregoing, there was\n\nclearly a basis in the evidence for the jury's verdict. The jury could have reasonably\n\nassigned a value of $74,000 to the AG Edwards #5657 account based on the costs\n\nexpended by the parties in opening the account.            Likewise, the jury could have\n\nreasonably assigned a value of $130,000 to AG Edwards #5621 based on the costs\n\nexpended in opening that account.        We therefore conclude that the evidence was\n\nsufficient to support the jury's answer to question eleven.\n\n\n                                             13\n\f       Robert's final argument is that the trial court erred in incorporating the jury's\n\nanswer to question eleven into the divorce decree because the accounts are stock\n\naccounts with fluctuating values and, therefore, it was error to enter monetary amounts as\n\nopposed to percentage values. In support of this argument, Robert cites this Court's\n\nopinion in May v. May, 716 S.W.2d 705 (Tex. App.â€”Corpus Christi 1986, no writ). But\n\nhaving reviewed May, we cannot conclude it stands for the proposition Robert implies it\n\ndoes. In May, we reviewed the trial court's division of a husband's retirement account\n\nupon divorce from his wife. Id. at 706. The Court engaged in a complicated analysis of\n\nthe mathematics used as the \"proper method of dividing future interests in retirement\n\nbenefits.\" Id. at 707-11. May does not apply to the facts of this case; it is an analysis\n\nspecific to the division of retirement benefits. In other words, May does not stand for the\n\nproposition that a divorce decree may only contain percentage ownership values for stock\n\naccounts, and in our research, we have found no other law standing for this proposition.\n\nWe are therefore not persuaded by Robert's argument in this regard.\n\n       In sum, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support the dollar amounts\n\nassigned to the stock accounts by the jury and that the trial court did not err in entering\n\nthose dollar amounts into the divorce decree. Robert's tenth, eleventh, and twelfth\n\nissues are overruled.\n\n                        V. Submission of Jury Question Nine\n\n       By his eighth issue, Robert argues that the trial court erred in submitting question\n\nnine to the jury because it differed from the applicable pattern jury charge. Question nine\n\nand the jury's answers to the question follow:\n\n\n                                            14\n\f      State in dollars the value of each of the following items:\n\n      PROPERTY VALUE\n\n      (Community Property, if any, MONICA MICHELENA AND ROBERT\n      MICHELENA)\n\n      $ ___144,800___\n\n      PROPERTY (Separate Property, if any, of MONICA MICHELENA\n\n      $ __10,000___\n\n      PROPERTY (Separate Property, if any, of ROBERT MICHELENA)\n\n      $ __59,200___\n\n      Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 278 provides that the trial court's \"[f]ailure to submit\n\na question shall not be deemed a ground for reversal of the judgment, unless its\n\nsubmission, in substantially correct wording, has been requested in writing and tendered\n\nby the party complaining of the judgment . . . .\" TEX. R. CIV. P. 278. Here, at the charge\n\nconference, although counsel for Robert objected to question nine and requested that it\n\nconform to the relevant pattern jury charge, counsel never tendered her proposed\n\nquestion to the trial court in writing. Without doing so, Robert has waived any error by\n\nthe trial court in submitting question nine, as worded, to the jury. See id.; see also\n\nGerdes v. Kennamer, 155 S.W.3d 523, 534-35 (Tex. App.â€”Corpus Christi 2004, pet.\n\ndenied). Robert's eighth issue is overruled.\n\n                           VI. Determinations Made After Jury Trial\n\n      By his thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth issues,10 Robert argues that the trial\n\ncourt erred in holding post-trial hearings in which it heard evidence related to certain\n\n      10\n           In his original brief, these issues were Robert's sixteenth, seventeenth, and nineteenth issues.\n                                                    15\n\fproperty not considered for division at the jury trial. Citing Goetz v. Goetz, Robert\n\nappears to argue that the division of the couple's property was the sole province of the\n\njury, and the trial court therefore erred in considering the post-trial evidence and entering\n\nvarious portions of the divorce decree based on that evidence. See 534 S.W.2d 716,\n\n718 (Tex. Civ. App.â€”Dallas 1976, no writ). Monica responds that it became apparent\n\nafter trial that a substantial amount of property possessed by the couple had not been\n\ndisclosed by Robert prior to trial.11 Monica responds that because Robert did not request\n\nthat this property be submitted to the jury for characterization as community or separate\n\nor for valuation, he has waived his right to complain of the trial court's characterization,\n\nvaluation, and division of the property without the jury. Monica then asserts that the trial\n\ncourt acted within its discretion to determine post-trial that the property was community\n\nproperty and divide it in a just and right manner. We agree with Monica.\n\n       As Robert posits, it is generally true that all disputed fact issues in a divorce case\n\nmust be submitted to a jury where, as was the case here, a jury is timely demanded. See\n\nid. (citations omitted). But it is also true that the \"[p]roperty possessed by either spouse\n\nduring or on dissolution of marriage is presumed to be community property\" unless\n\nproven otherwise by \"clear and convincing evidence.\"                        TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. Â§\n\n3.003(a)-(b) (West 2006). And the party attempting to rebut the community-property\n\npresumption has the burden of seeking the necessary jury questions regarding the\n\ncharacterization of the marital property. In re Marriage of Moore, 890 S.W.2d 821, 834\n\n(Tex. App.â€”Amarillo 1994, no writ) (citing W.O. Bankston Nissan, Inc. v. Walters, 754\n\n\n       11\n            This fact is not disputed by Robert and is supported by the record. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(g).\n                                                     16\n\fS.W.2d 127, 128 (Tex. 1988); Horlock v. Horlock, 614 S.W.2d 478, 480 (Tex. Civ.\n\nApp.â€”Houston [14th Dist.] 1981, writ ref'd n.r.e.)).         If the party fails to seek such\n\nquestions on the disputed property, he waives any error committed by the trial court in\n\ncharacterizing that property. See id.; see also TEX. R. CIV. P. 279 (\"Upon appeal all\n\nindependent grounds of recovery or defense not conclusively established under the\n\nevidence and no element of which is submitted or requested are waived.\" (Emphasis\n\nadded.)).\n\n        Here, it is undisputed that Robert did not request jury instructions regarding the\n\nproperty at issue in his thirteenth through fifteenth issues. It matters not that the property\n\nwas not disclosed until after trial. As discussed above, all property possessed by either\n\nspouse during the marriage is subject to the community-property presumption. Robert\n\nwas obliged to submit that property to the jury for characterization, if he so desired, and\n\nhis failure to do so waived our review of his complaints regarding the trial court's post-trial\n\ndeterminations regarding the undisclosed property. As such, we overrule his thirteenth\n\nthrough fifteenth issues to the extent they complain of the foregoing determinations by the\n\ntrial court.\n\n                     VII. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n\n        By his first issue, Robert argues that the trial court erred in refusing to file findings\n\nof fact and conclusions of law, as were requested by Robert, regarding the court's rulings\n\nin the divorce decree. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 296, 297. Assuming without deciding that the\n\ntrial court so erred, Robert has not explained to this Court how he was harmed by the trial\n\ncourt's failure to file findings and conclusions. When there are \"multiple grounds for\n\n\n                                               17\n\frecovery or multiple defenses\" in a case, \"an appellant [is] harmed\" by the trial court's\n\nfailure to file findings and conclusions because he is put \"in the position of having to guess\n\nthe trial court's reasons for rendering judgment against him.\" Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. v.\n\nLaca, 243 S.W.3d 791, 794 (Tex. App.â€”El Paso 2007, no pet.) (citations omitted). In\n\nseveral of his issues related to determinations made by the trial court after trial, Robert\n\nmakes an almost identical conclusory statement that because of the trial court's \"refus[al]\n\nto file findings of fact and conclusions of law,\" he \"has been harmed and cannot ascertain\n\nthe reasons for the ruling.\" Aside from those singular, conclusory statements, however,\n\nRobert does not explain how those rulings were based on multiple grounds for recovery or\n\notherwise identify the reason why we should presume the sort of harm he alleges. See\n\nTEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i); Liberty Mut. Fire Ins., 243 S.W.3d at 794. In short, we are not\n\npersuaded by Robert's brief that he was harmed by the trial court's refusal to file findings\n\nand conclusions. Robert's first issue is overruled.\n\n                                      VIII. Remaining Issues\n\n        While we are bound to liberally construe an appellant's brief and address his\n\nissues if possible and practicable, see TEX. R. APP. P. 38.9, where a brief almost\n\ncompletely fails to cite the appellate record or any relevant legal authority and presents no\n\nsubstantive argument, the appellate court is not obligated to make a party's argument for\n\nhim.12 See Republic Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Mex-Tex, Inc., 150 S.W.3d 423, 427 (Tex.\n\n2004); Canton-Carter v. Baylor Coll. of Med., 271 S.W.3d 928, 931 (Tex. App.â€”Houston\n\n\n        12\n          On October 3, 2011, the Court notified both parties that their briefs did not substantially comply\nwith Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 38.1 and directed the parties to file amended briefs in the case that\ncomplied with the briefing rules. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i). Robert filed his amended brief on December\n21, 2011, but three of Robert's appellate issues remain inadequately briefed.\n                                                    18\n\f[14th Dist.] 2008, no pet.); see also Johnson v. City of Dallas, No. 05-09-00365-CV, 2010\n\nWL 2491024, at *1 (Tex. App.â€”Dallas June 22, 2010, no pet.) (mem. op.) (\"Although we\n\nmust interpret this requirement [Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 38.1(i)] liberally, an\n\nissue not supported by authority is waived.\") (citation omitted). Indeed, such a course is\n\ndiscouraged as it is prohibited that we act as advocates for the interests of the parties.\n\nSee Canton-Carter, 271 S.W.3d at 931 (citing Martinez v. El Paso County, 218 S.W.3d\n\n841, 844 (Tex. App.â€”El Paso 2007, pet. stricken)) (holding that an appellate court should\n\nnot speculate as to an appellant's argument and thus stray from its role \"as a neutral\n\nadjudicator [to] become an advocate for [an appellant]\").          When a party fails to\n\nadequately brief an issue, he waives our review on appeal. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i);\n\nGraves v. Tomlinson, 329 S.W.3d 128, 162 (Tex. App.â€”Houston [14th Dist.] 2010, pet.\n\ndenied).\n\n      In his sixth issue, Robert asserts that the trial court erred in entering judgment that\n\nawarded the entire amount of the reimbursement claim (jury question five) to Monica.\n\nHowever, Robert cites to no legal authority in support of this assertion, and his argument\n\nin support of this issue consists of two to three conclusory sentences with no substantive\n\nanalysis. In his seventh and ninth issues, Robert appears to challenge the evidence\n\nsupporting the jury's answers to questions nine and ten, respectively, which involved the\n\nvaluation of the couple's separate and community property estates and the\n\ncharacterization of certain property as community or separate. But Robert does not\n\nprovide the applicable standard of review or any substantive law on the characterization\n\nor valuation of property in a divorce case. And, again, his argument in support of these\n\n\n                                            19\n\fissues consists of two or three cursory and conclusory statements. See TEX. R. APP. P.\n\n38.1(i). Absent meaningful legal analysis supported by authority and record cites, we will\n\nnot engage in a time-consuming review of the voluminous ten-day trial record in this case\n\nin order to address the merits of these issues. See Fredonia State Bank v. Gen. Am. Life\n\nIns. Co., 881 S.W.2d 279, 283 (Tex. 1994) (holding that it has never been a part of an\n\nappellate court's duties to search the record for evidence itself). These issues are\n\ntherefore inadequately briefed and waived. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i). We overrule\n\nRobert's sixth, seventh, and ninth issues.\n\n                                IX. The Cross-Appeal\n\n      By six cross-issues, Monica challenges various aspect of the divorce decree,\n\nincluding the characterization, valuation, and division of the marital property and the\n\ncustody orders.\n\nA. Characterization of Property\n\n      By two issues, Monica challenges the characterization of certain property as\n\nseparate rather than community property.\n\n      As stated previously, property possessed by either spouse during the marriage is\n\npresumed to be community property unless that presumption is overcome by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence that the property in question is the separate property of one spouse.\n\nSee TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. Â§ 3.003(a)-(b).\n\n             In order to rebut the community property presumption, the party\n      claiming separate property must trace and identify the property claimed as\n      separate property by clear and convincing evidence. Tracing involves\n      establishing the separate origin of the property through evidence showing\n      the time and means by which the spouse originally obtained possession of\n      the property. Separate property will retain its character through a series of\n\n                                             20\n\f        exchanges so long as the party asserting separate ownership can\n        overcome the presumption of community property by tracing the assets on\n        hand during the marriage back to property that, because of its time and\n        manner of acquisition, is separate in character.\n\nWalton v. Johnson, 879 S.W.2d 942, 946 (Tex. App.â€”Tyler 1994, writ denied); see also\n\nVandiver v. Vandiver, 4 S.W.3d 300, 302 (Tex. App.â€”Corpus Christi 1999, pet. denied)\n\n(\"To [rebut the community property presumption], the spouse must trace and clearly\n\nidentify the property claimed as separate property.\") (citations omitted). If the trial court\n\ndoes mischaracterize property in its division of the marital estate, the error does not\n\nrequire reversal \"unless the mischaracterization would have had more than a de minimis\n\neffect on the [] court's just and right division of the property.\" Vandiver, 4 S.W.3d at 302\n\n(citations omitted).\n\n        1. Texas State Bank Accounts\n\n        By her first cross-issue, Monica argues that the trial court abused its discretion in\n\ndetermining that three Texas State Bank accountsâ€”one with an account number ending\n\nin 602, one with an account number ending in 694, and one with a certificate of deposit\n\nnumber ending in 549â€”were Robert's separate property because Robert failed to\n\novercome the presumption that the accounts were community property by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence.13 The trial court determined that the evidence showed that the 602\n\naccount and the 549 certificate of deposit consisted of funds directly traceable to bank\n\naccounts or other properties listed in the prenuptial agreement; granted Robert's motion\n\nfor directed verdict on those accounts; and, therefore, did not submit those accounts to\n\n        13\n           It is undisputed that Robert was in possession of the three accounts during the marriage. At the\ntime of the divorce, the number 602 account had a balance of $498,366.21; the number 549 certificate of\ndeposit had a balance of $100,000; and the balance of the number 694 account was unknown.\n                                                    21\n\fthe jury for characterization and valuation.14 Monica contends that there was insufficient\n\nevidence tracing the funds in these accounts to the prenuptial accounts and properties,\n\nand as such, the trial court erred in characterizing the accounts as Robert's separate\n\nproperty. We construe Monica's first cross-issue as a challenge to the trial court's\n\ngranting of Robert's motion for directed verdict.\n\n        \"It is error to grant a directed verdict when the evidence raises any issue of\n\nmaterial fact.\" Connell v. Connell, 889 S.W.2d 534, 538 (Tex. App.â€”San Antonio 1994,\n\npet. denied) (citing Garza v. Maverick Mkt., Inc., 768 S.W.2d 273, 276 (Tex. 1989)). In\n\nreviewing the granting of a directed verdict, we indulge every reasonable inference in\n\nfavor of the proponent of the evidence and discard all contradictory evidence. Id. at\n\n538-39 (citing White v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., 651 S.W.2d 260, 262 (Tex. 1983)).\n\n\"If so viewed, the evidence amounts to more than a scintilla, i.e., more than a mere\n\nsuspicion or speculation that the fact proposition might be true, then an issue is raised.\"\n\nId. But when the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is so weak as to do no more than\n\ncreate a mere surmise or suspicion of its existence, the evidence is, in legal effect, no\n\nevidence, and it will not support a verdict or judgment. Id. (citing Seideneck v. Cal\n\nBayreuther Assoc., 451 S.W.2d 752 (Tex. 1970); Tex. City Terminal Ry. v. McLemore,\n\n225 S.W.2d 1007, 1009 (Tex. Civ. App.â€”Galveston 1949, writ ref'd n.r.e.)). In other\n        14\n          As to the number 694 account, in particular, there was evidence at trial that the account belonged\nto Robert's mother. Robert testified that he was listed on the account but that he never deposited or\nwithdrew money from the account or otherwise assisted his mother with her finances. Robert testified that\nhis mother listed him on the account because she is a widow and \"she just wants that in case anything\nhappens\" to her. This characterization of the number 694 account was not contested by Monica at trial,\nand she presented no evidence that the 694 account was either Robert's separate property or the couple's\ncommunity property. We conclude that Robert's testimony at trial, which was never contradicted by\nMonica, established that the number 694 account was an account owned by his motherâ€”it was neither his\nseparate property nor the property of the marital estate. Thus, we cannot conclude that the trial court erred\nin determining that the 694 account should not be submitted to the jury for characterization.\n                                                    22\n\fwords, an instructed verdict is proper in two instances: when there is no evidence or\n\nwhen the evidence has no probative value or force. Id.\n\n       Here, Robert points us to evidence at trial linking the funds in the 602 account and\n\nthe 549 certificate of deposit to the accounts and properties included in the prenuptial\n\nagreement. First, as to the number 602 account, there was evidence at trial that Robert\n\nand his family sold two trailer parksâ€”El Valle De Sol and Manlorsons Estatesâ€”in 1999.\n\nBoth parks were included in the prenuptial agreement as Robert's separate property.\n\nRobert's share from the sale of the trailer parks totaled somewhat less than $500,000.\n\nRobert's testimony at trial then indicated that the funds in the 602 account were generated\n\nby his proceeds from the sale of the trailer parks.\n\n       Second, as to the number 549 certificate of deposit, Robert testified at trial that it\n\nwas generated from funds in a First State Bank and Trust money market account listed in\n\nthe prenuptial agreement. Robert testified that he opened the First State Bank money\n\nmarket account in 1981 but, at some point, Texas State Bank acquired First State Bank.\n\nRobert testified that the money market account stayed the same after the acquisition,\n\nexcept that Texas State Bank added a digit to the account number. Robert then opened\n\nthe number 549 certificate of deposit with funds from the money market account. Robert\n\ntestified that no money has been withdrawn from the certificate of deposit since it was\n\nopened. We find no evidence in the record that the 549 certificate of deposit was\n\ncommunity property.\n\n       As to the number 602 account, in particular, Monica points us to evidence from trial\n\nthat community funds were commingled with the number 602 account. See Irvin v.\n\n\n                                             23\n\fParker, 139 S.W.3d 703, 708 (Tex. App.â€”Fort Worth 2004, no pet.) (citation omitted) (\"[I]f\n\nthe evidence shows that separate and community property have become so commingled\n\nas to defy re[-]segregation and identification, the community presumption prevails.\").\n\nFirst, Monica points us to evidenceâ€”namely, a series of cleared checksâ€”that she\n\ndeposited community funds in the 602 account. Second, Monica points us to evidence\n\nthat Robert took out a $40,000 loan during the marriage that he deposited into the 602\n\naccount; the record includes bank documents and testimony by Robert substantiating this\n\nfact, as well.   Because any loan taken out during the marriage is presumed to be\n\ncommunity property, Robert commingled community funds with the 602 account when he\n\ndeposited the loan into that account. See TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. Â§ 3.003(a)-(b). Finally,\n\nMonica points us to testimony by herself and Robert that Robert deposited wages from\n\nvarious jobs he held during the marriage into the 602 account.\n\n       Based on the foregoing testimony and evidence, we conclude that Robert\n\nadequately traced the 549 certificate of deposit to a money market account that was\n\nincluded in the prenuptial agreement. There is no evidence in the record that the 549\n\ncertificate of deposit was community property, and we believe Robert showed by clear\n\nand convincing evidence how he originally obtained the property and how the property\n\nretained its separate character throughout a series of exchanges during the marriage.\n\nSee Walton, 879 S.W.2d at 946; Vandiver, 4 S.W.3d at 302. There was no fact issue as\n\nto the characterization of the 549 certificate of deposit, and thus, we cannot conclude that\n\nthe trial court erred in concluding that this account was Robert's separate property,\n\ngranting Robert's directed verdict as to this account, and refusing to submit this account\n\n\n                                            24\n\fto the jury. See Connell, 889 S.W.2d at 538-39. Monica's first cross-issue is overruled\n\nas to the 549 certificate of deposit.\n\n       But with regard to the number 602 account, although there was evidence at trial\n\nthat the funds in the account originated from the sale of property listed in the prenuptial\n\nagreement, we believe the record contains more than a scintilla of evidence that\n\ncommunity funds were commingled with the account, as well. See id.; see also Irvin, 139\n\nS.W.3d at 708. As such, the evidence created a fact issue as to whether the number 602\n\naccount retained its separate character, and the trial court erred in granting Robert's\n\ndirected verdict as to this account and not submitting the account to the jury for\n\ncharacterization. See Irvin, 139 S.W.3d at 708; see also Connell, 889 S.W.2d at 538-39.\n\nMonica's first cross-issue is sustained as to the number 602 account.\n\n       2. AG Edwards Accounts\n\n       By her second cross-issue, Monica challenges the portion of the decree finding\n\nthat $144,800 was community property and $59,200 was Robert's separate property,\n\narguing that Robert failed to overcome the presumption that the entire amounts in the two\n\nAG Edwards accounts submitted to the jury were community property by tracing the\n\namounts to his separate property. Monica argues that, as a result, the jury's valuation of\n\nthe community property estate at $144,800 was against the great weight and\n\npreponderance of the evidence.\n\n       Before beginning our analysis, we note that AG Edwards #5621, first discussed\n\nabove in Part V of this opinion, was determined by the jury to be 100 percent community\n\nproperty and its entire amount ($130,000) was included in the jury's community property\n\n\n                                            25\n\fvaluation. As such, although Monica's second issue generally challenges the jury's\n\nanswers as to both accounts, we cannot construe the issue as complaining of the verdict\n\nas to the #5621 account. Rather, the relevant determination here seems to be the jury's\n\nvaluation of Robert's separate estate at $59,200, which represents eighty percent of the\n\nvalue of the #5657 account, and the remainder of the community estate at $14,800, which\n\nrepresents twenty percent of the #5657 account. We also note that by phrasing her\n\nchallenge as one concerning the \"great weight and preponderance\" of the evidence,\n\nMonica appears to challenge the factual sufficiency of the evidence, and we will treat this\n\nissue as such.\n\n       Under the heightened clear and convincing evidence standard of review applicable\n\nto this issue, when an appellate court conducts a factual sufficiency review of a separate\n\nproperty finding in a divorce proceeding, the court must conclude that the evidence is\n\nfactually insufficient if the court determines that no reasonable fact finder could form a firm\n\nbelief or conviction of the truth of its finding. See Stavinoha v. Stavinoha, 126 S.W.3d\n\n604, 609 (Tex. App.â€”Houston [14th Dist.] 2004, no pet.) (citing In re J.F.C., 96 S.W.3d\n\n256, 266-67 (Tex. 2002); In re C.H., 89 S.W.3d 17, 25 (Tex. 2002)). And if the reviewing\n\ncourt determines that the evidence is factually insufficient, the court must detail why it has\n\nreached this conclusion. Id.\n\n       It is undisputed that Robert was in possession of AG Edwards #5657 during the\n\nmarriage. In Part IV of this opinion, we determined that the $74,000 value assigned to\n\nthe #5657 account by the jury was supported by the evidence and reasonable. In\n\nsupport of her second cross-issue, Monica asserts that the only evidence at trial that AG\n\n\n                                              26\n\fEdwards #5657 was Robert's separate property was his testimony that he deposited\n\nseveral checks from the number 602 Texas State Bank accountâ€”which we previously\n\nheld was correctly determined to be Robert's separate propertyâ€”into the #5657 account.\n\nMonica asserts that \"the checks do not reflect the account number that [Robert] testified\n\nto and the total amount of the checks was far less than the account balance in said\n\naccounts at the time of the trial before the jury.\"\n\n       Having reviewed the evidence cited by Monica, we find that the cleared checks do\n\nindeed reflect deposits totaling approximately $32,000 made by Robert from the Texas\n\nState Bank 602 account into an AG Edwards account. The cleared checks do not reflect\n\nthe AG Edwards account into which the funds were deposited. However, Robert later\n\ntestified that the checks were deposited into the AG Edwards account he called his \"cash\n\naccount.\" Robert testified that he held two accounts at AG Edwardsâ€”an \"IRA\" and a\n\n\"cash account.\" Robert's testimony and the exhibits introduced at trial indicate that the\n\n\"IRA\" is AG Edwards #5657 and the \"cash account\" is AG Edwards #5621. Thus, these\n\nchecks, which were intended to evidence transfer of separate funds into the #5657\n\naccount, do not accomplish their seeming purpose. The cleared checks are, instead,\n\nevidence of separate funds deposited into the #5621 account.15 We therefore agree with\n\nMonica that the checks are no evidence of separate funds deposited into the #5657\n\naccount.\n\n       Robert points us to testimony, which he asserts amounts to sufficient evidence to\n\ntrace the funds in the #5657 account to an IRA listed in the prenuptial agreement.\n       15\n          Because the #5621 account was determined by the jury to be 100 percent community property\nand neither party challenges that characterization, we do not address whether the jury erred in so\ncharacterizing the #5621 account.\n                                                27\n\fRobert testified that the funds in the New York Life Mainstay IRA account listed in the\n\nprenuptial agreement were transferred to open the #5657 account with AG Edwards.\n\nHowever, Robert provides no documentation regarding the New York Life Mainstay\n\naccount; specifically, he provides no documentation evidencing the balance of the New\n\nYork Life Mainstay account at the time it was closed such that we can trace it to the\n\nopening balance of the #5657 account. Mock v. Mock, 216 S.W.3d 370, 373 (Tex.\n\nApp.â€”Eastland 2006, no pet.) (holding that the community property presumption\n\nprevailed where wife failed to trace the assets in the allegedly separate account with any\n\ndocumentary evidence); see also Walton, 879 S.W.2d at 946; Vandiver, 4 S.W.3d at 302.\n\nWe are therefore not persuaded that Robert's testimony, alone, amounts to sufficient\n\ntracing evidence.\n\n      In sum, absent additional evidence, we cannot conclude the jury's characterization\n\nof AG Edwards #5657 as eighty percent Robert's separate property was supported by\n\nclear and convincing evidence.      Because it was possessed by Robert during the\n\nmarriage, the account was presumed to be community property, and he bore a heavy\n\nburden to establish otherwise. See TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. Â§ 3.003(a)-(b); Walton, 879\n\nS.W.2d at 946. The cleared checks showing deposits from Robert's separate account\n\ninto an AG Edwards accountâ€”the only documentary evidence apparent in the record\n\nreflecting separate funds flowing to an AG Edwards accountâ€”were clearly not deposited\n\ninto the #5657 (the \"IRA\") account. No reasonable juror could have formed a firm belief\n\nor conviction based on this evidence alone that the #5657 account included Robert's\n\nseparate funds. In other words, Robert's testimony attempting to link the account to the\n\n\n                                           28\n\fprenuptial agreement was not enough.           We conclude that the community property\n\npresumption should have prevailed and the account should have been characterized as\n\n100 percent community property. It likewise follows from this that the jury's valuation of\n\nthe community estate at $144,800 was not supported by the evidence. With both AG\n\nEdwards accounts characterized as 100 percent community property, we conclude that\n\nthe correct community estate valuation by the jury would have been $204,000.16\n\n       Finally, we conclude that, in light of the foregoing, the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in entering a divorce decree that memorialized these characterizations and\n\nvaluations by the jury. In the final divorce decree, the trial court ordered that Monica\n\nreceive $72,400 as her portion of the community property valuation determined by the\n\njuryâ€”i.e., half of $144,800. However, the record in this case demonstrates that the jury's\n\ncharacterization of the #5657 account as partially Robert's separate property was not\n\nsupported by clear and convincing evidence. See Chavez, 269 S.W.3d at 766. And\n\nentering the decree on the basis of this unsupported characterization was an abuse of\n\ndiscretion by the trial court that materially affected the just and right division of the\n\ncommunity estate. See id. Under the evidence presented at trial, the jury should have\n\ncharacterized both AG Edwards accounts as one hundred percent community property,\n\nand the community property estate should have been valued at $204,000. Half of this\n\namount would have been $102,000â€”$29,600 more than Monica received in the decree\n\nissued by the court. Therefore, the trial court clearly abused its discretion in entering a\n\nfinal decree that: awarded Robert $59,200 as his separate property from the #5657\n\n       16\n          AG Edwards #5621 was valued by the jury at $130,000, and AG Edwards #5657 was valued at\n$74,000, both of which values we affirmed in Part V of this opinion.\n                                               29\n\faccount; and awarded Monica only $72,400 as her share of the community property.\n\nRobert was not entitled to a separate property award based on the AG Edwards account;\n\nMonica was entitled to a larger community property award, as a result; and this error by\n\nthe trial court materially affected the just and right division of the parties' estate.\n\n        Monica's second cross-issue is sustained.\n\nB. Valuation of Monica's Separate Property\n\n        By her third cross-issue, Monica challenges the portion of the decree\n\nmemorializing the jury's verdict that an heirloom ring Robert gifted her was valued at\n\n$10,000, arguing that the jury's answer as to the ring's value was against the great weight\n\nand preponderance of evidence. 17                Monica asserts that the only evidence at trial\n\nconcerning the value of the ring was Robert's testimony that the ring was worth more than\n\n$20,000.       We accept this assertion as true as it is not disputed by Robert and is\n\nsupported by the record. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(g).\n\n        Under a factual sufficiency standard, the reviewing court determines whether the\n\nverdict is so against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence as to be\n\nmanifestly unjust. See In re C.H., 89 S.W.3d 17, 25 (Tex. 2002) (citation omitted).\n\nGiven that Robert's testimony was the only evidence as to the ring's value introduced at\n\ntrial, there was no evidence supporting the jury's verdict that the ring was worth only\n\n$10,000.        In fact, the only evidence submitted as to the ring's value conclusively\n\nestablished a different verdict than the one issued by the jury. See Cadle Co. v. Ortiz,\n\n227 S.W.3d 831, 834-35 (Tex. App.â€”Corpus Christi 2007, pet. denied) (citing Ponce v.\n\n        17\n             Neither party contests the jury's characterization of the ring as 100 percent Monica's separate\nproperty.\n                                                     30\n\fSandoval, 68 S.W.3d 799, 806 (Tex. App.â€”Amarillo 2001, no pet.)). We therefore\n\nconclude that the jury's verdict that the ring was worth $10,000 was so against the great\n\nweight and preponderance of the evidence that it was manifestly unjust. And because\n\nthe jury's verdict was not supported by the evidence, the trial court clearly abused its\n\ndiscretion in entering a decree memorializing that verdict. See Chavez, 269 S.W.3d at\n\n766; Magness, 241 S.W.3d at 912. Monica's third cross-issue is sustained.\n\nC. Division of Property\n\n       By her fourth cross-issue, Monica argues that the trial court's division of the\n\ncommunity property in this case was so disproportionate as to be inequitable. Monica\n\nargues that the division was not supported by the evidence and was therefore an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n       \"In a decree of divorce . . . , the court shall order a division of the estate of the\n\nparties in a manner that the court deems just and right, having due regard for the rights of\n\neach party . . . .\" TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. Â§ 7.001 (West 2006). The trial court may order\n\nan unequal division of the community property when a reasonable basis exists for doing\n\nso. Fischer-Stoker v. Stoker, 174 S.W.3d 272, 277 (Tex. App.â€”Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n2005, pet. denied). But the division of property must not be so disproportionate as to be\n\ninequitable, and the circumstances must justify awarding more than one-half of the\n\ncommunity property to one party. See id.; see also Prague v. Prague, 190 S.W.3d 31, 41\n\n(Tex. App.â€”Dallas 2005, pet. denied). A trial court may consider the following factors in\n\nmaking a disproportionate division of property: \"(1) the spouses' capacities and abilities;\n\n(2) benefits which the party not at fault would have derived from the continuation of the\n\n\n                                            31\n\fmarriage; (3) business opportunities; (4) relative physical conditions; (5) relative financial\n\nconditions; (6) disparity of ages; (7) size of separate estates; (8) the nature of the\n\nproperty; and (9) disparity of earning capacity.\" Viera v. Viera, 331 S.W.3d 195, 203-04\n\n(Tex. App.â€”El Paso 2011, no pet.) (citing Murff v. Murff, 615 S.W.2d 696, 699 (Tex.\n\n1981)); see Zorilla v. Wahid, 83 S.W.3d 247, 252 (Tex. App.â€”Corpus Christi 2002, no\n\npet.), disapproved on other grounds, Iliff v. Iliff, 339 S.W.3d 74 (Tex. 2011).\n\n                To disturb a trial court's division of property . . . , the appellant must\n        show the trial court clearly abused its discretion by a division . . . that is\n        manifestly unjust and unfair. See Ridgell v. Ridgell, 960 S.W.2d 144, 147\n        (Tex. App.â€”Corpus Christi 1997, no pet.) (property division); [citation\n        omitted]; Kuehn v. Kuehn, 594 S.W.2d 158, 161 (Tex. App.â€”Houston [14th\n        Dist.] 1980, no writ) (property division). In making this determination, we\n        look to whether the trial court acted arbitrarily or unreasonably, without\n        reference to any guiding rules and principles. See [Worford v. Stamper,\n        801 S.W.2d 108, 109 (Tex. 1990)]. Our analysis focuses on a two-pronged\n        inquiry: (1) Did the trial court have sufficient information upon which to\n        exercise its discretion?; and (2) Did the trial court abuse its discretion by\n        causing the property division or child support order to be manifestly unjust\n        or unfair? See In re De La Pena, 999 S.W.2d 521, 527 (Tex. App.â€”El\n        Paso 1999, no pet.)[; s]ee also Zieba v. Martin, 928 S.W.2d 782, 786 (Tex.\n        App.â€”Houston [14th Dist.] 1996, no writ) (finding both legal and factual\n        sufficiency are relevant factors under the abuse of discretion standard). A\n        trial court abuses its discretion when it rules without supporting evidence.\n        [citation omitted].\n\nEvans v. Evans, 14 S.W.3d 343, 345-46 (Tex. App.â€”Houston [14th Dist.] 2000, no pet.).\n\n        As discussed in the background section above, the marital property awarded to\n\nMonica, with values ascertainable by the decree, totaled approximately $164,000. 18\n\nMonica asserts this amount represents only ten percent of the value of the marital estate.\n\n\n        18\n           This total includes the $25,000 reimbursement award, $72,400 as her portion of the community\nproperty, personal property from the community estate valued at approximately $42,000, and a $25,000\njudgment as her portion of the community estate's property that was indicated to be sold. Monica was also\nawarded three community bank accounts and two AG Edwards investment accounts, but the amount of\nfunds in those accounts was not included in the decree.\n                                                   32\n\fMonica appears to base this assertion on the following amounts awarded in the decree to\n\nRobert, which totaled approximately $1,001,000: $72,400 as his portion of the jury's\n\ncommunity property verdict; personal property from the community estate valued at\n\napproximately $170,000; the remainder of the personal property indicated to be sold,\n\nwhich was valued at $242,707.95 after subtracting the $25,000 judgment owed to\n\nMonica; and all of the accounts listed in \"Exhibit D\" of the decree, the listed values for\n\nwhich accounts totaled approximately $516,000.\n\n       We note at the outset that all of the accounts listed in Exhibit D were either closed\n\naccounts, accounts owned by other family members and not Robert and Monica, or\n\nalternate account numbers for accounts covered by the prenuptial agreement or accounts\n\nsubmitted to the jury for characterization and valuation. The evidence before the trial\n\ncourt shows that the first account on Exhibit D, a Texas State Bank account with a number\n\nending in 690 with a listed value of $105,464.06, was an account closed by Robert during\n\nthe marriage and transferred into the Texas State Bank number 602 account we\n\npreviously held to be Robert's separate property.19 The second account, a Texas State\n\nBank account with a number ending in 190, has a \"pending value,\" and the evidence\n\nbefore the trial court shows it to be the account number for a loan Robert took out for legal\n\nexpenses during the divorce proceedings. The third account, a First State Bank account\n\nwith a number ending in 090, has a \"pending value,\" and the evidence before the trial\n\ncourt shows it to be the First State Bank account included in the prenuptial agreement that\n\nwe previously concluded in Part IX.A.1 of this opinion to be the same as the Texas State\n\n\n       19\n            Monica does not address the origin of the funds in the number 690 account by this issue.\n                                                    33\n\fBank number 602 account correctly determined to be Robert's separate property. The\n\nfourth account, a First State Bank account with a number ending in 534, has a \"pending\n\nvalue,\" and no witness at trial could identify this account. The fifth account, a \"Mainstay\n\nFunds\" account with a number ending in 144, is clearly the New York Life IRA account\n\nincluded in the prenuptial agreement as Robert's separate property. The sixth account,\n\nan AG Edwards account with a number ending in 954, has a \"pending value,\" and\n\nRobert's undisputed testimony at trial identified this account as belonging to his mother.\n\nThe seventh and eighth accounts, AG Edwards accounts with numbers ending in\n\n441-007 and 441-061, have values of $52,875.03 and $45,233.94, and the evidence\n\nbefore the trial court showed these to be alternative numbers for the same AG Edwards\n\n#5657 account submitted to the jury for characterization and valuation. The ninth and\n\ntenth accounts, AG Edwards accounts with numbers ending in 784-007 and 784-061,\n\nhave \"pending values,\" and the evidence before the trial court showed these accounts to\n\nbe IRAs opened by Monica and Robert in their son's name. The eleventh and twelfth\n\naccounts, AG Edwards accounts with numbers ending in 524-007 and 524-061, have\n\nvalues of $134,810.83 and $124,979.07, respectively, and the evidence before the trial\n\ncourt showed these to be alternative numbers for the same AG Edwards #5621 account\n\nsubmitted to the jury for characterization and valuation. The thirteenth and final account\n\non Exhibit D, a New York Life Annuity with a number ending in 972, has a \"pending value,\"\n\nand is clearly the account number for a life insurance policy in Robert's name, a policy\n\nwhich is addressed nowhere in the divorce decree.\n\n       In light of the foregoing, we do not agree with Monica that Robert's share of the\n\n\n                                            34\n\fmarital property can be fairly characterized to include any of the $516,000 listed for the\n\naccounts in Exhibit D.           Subtracting that from the $1,001,000 Monica claims Robert\n\nreceived, Robert is left with a total of approximately $485,000, which represents\n\napproximately seventy-five percent of the marital estate.\n\n        As to the remainder of the division, Robert and Monica received equal shares of\n\nthe amount determined by the jury to be community propertyâ€”each received half of\n\n$144,800, or $72,400.             And for purposes of our analysis here, the various other\n\ncommunity accounts awarded to the parties without values listed in the decree do not aid\n\nus in our analysis of the rightness of the trial court's division. So, it follows that the next\n\nseemingly most disproportionate division of the property was the division of the marital\n\nestate's personal property.20 Robert received $170,000 worth of community personal\n\nproperty to keep and $242,707.95 worth of the personal property indicated to be sold, for\n\na total of approximately $413,000. By contrast, Monica received approximately $42,000\n\nworth of community personal property to keep and a $25,000 judgment as her portion of\n\nthe community property that was indicated to be sold, for a total of approximately\n\n$67,000. In short, Robert received approximately eighty-six percent of the community\n\npersonal property, and Monica received only fourteen percent.\n\n        Monica argues that this disproportionate division was inappropriate because there\n\nwas no evidence that she possessed any of the advantages considered by trial courts in\n\nawarding one party a disproportionate share of the marital estate. Rather, she asserts,\n\nthe evidence at trial showed that Robert was at fault in the break-up of the marriage; that\n\n        20\n             Neither party challenges the trial court's characterization of the personal property as community\nproperty.\n                                                      35\n\fRobert had a sizable separate estate relative to Monica; and that Robert had superior\n\nbusiness opportunities and earning capacities.                  See Viera, 331 S.W.3d at 203-04.\n\nThese factual assertions are not disputed by Robert and are supported by the record. 21\n\nSee TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(g). And Robert does not point us to any evidence that weighs in\n\nfavor of the disproportionate share of community property awarded to him in the divorce\n\ndecree.22\n\n        Thus, we conclude that the trial court's award to Robert of approximately\n\nseventy-five percent of the community property listed in the decree was not supported by\n\nthe evidence. See Evans, 14 S.W.3d at 345-46. There was no evidence that Robert\n\nwas disadvantaged by any of the factors relevant to a disproportionate division, and as\n\nsuch, no reasonable basis existed for awarding him more than one-half of the community\n\nproperty.     See Fischer-Stoker, 174 S.W.3d at 277.                    In short, the disproportionate\n\namount of community property awarded to Robert in the divorce decree was inequitable\n\nand constituted an abuse of discretion by the trial court. See id.; see also Evans, 14\n\nS.W.3d at 345-46. Monica's fourth cross-issue is sustained.\n\nD. Prenuptial Agreement\n\n        By her fifth cross-issue, Monica argues that the trial court abused its discretion in\n\nnot finding the couple's prenuptial agreement \"unconscionable as a matter of law\" in that\n\nit failed to fairly and reasonably disclose Robert's property and financial obligations.\n\n        21\n           Robert's sole argument in response to Monica's fourth cross-issue is that the trial court erred in\nholding the post-trial hearings and dividing community property without submitting those issues to the jury.\nFor the same reasons given in Part VII of this opinion, we are not persuaded by this argument.\n        22\n            See Fredonia State Bank v. Gen. Am. Life Ins. Co., 881 S.W.2d 279, 283 (Tex. 1994) (holding\nthat it has never been a part of an appellate court's duties to, itself, engage in a time-consuming review of a\nvoluminous record for evidence).\n                                                     36\n\fPremarital agreements are presumed to be enforceable. Marsh v. Marsh, 949 S.W.2d\n\n734, 739 (Tex. App.â€”Houston [14th Dist.] 1997, no writ) (citing Grossman v. Grossman,\n\n799 S.W.2d 511, 513 (Tex. App.â€”Corpus Christi 1990, no writ)).                          To rebut that\n\npresumption, the party seeking to avoid enforcement must prove either that: she signed\n\nthe agreement involuntarily; or the agreement was unconscionable when signed and the\n\nagreement failed to fairly and reasonably disclose the \"property and financial obligations\n\nof the other party.\" See TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. Â§ 4.006(a) (West 2006); see also Marsh,\n\n949 S.W.2d at 739. In reviewing whether the agreement is conscionable, courts have\n\nconsidered factors such as the maturity of the parties, their educational levels and\n\nbusiness backgrounds, their experiences with prior marriages, their respective ages, and\n\nwhether there were motivations to protect children. See Marsh, 949 S.W.2d at 741\n\n(citation omitted). \"Because disclosure forms the second prong of the test to rebut the\n\npresumption of enforceability, lack of disclosure is material only if the premarital\n\nagreement is unconscionable.\" Id. at 743; see also Fazakerly v. Fazakerly, 996 S.W.2d\n\n260, 265 (Tex. App.â€“Eastland 1999, pet. denied) (\"The issue of unconscionability must\n\nbe decided by the trial court as a matter of law before the disclosure questions are\n\naddressed.\").\n\n        Here, Monica makes no argument related to the conscionability of the\n\nagreement.23 She contends only that the agreement was unenforceable because it did\n\nnot adequately disclose Robert's property and financial obligations. Even assuming that\n\nis true, absent any argument related to the first prong of Monica's burdenâ€”i.e., proof that\n\n        23\n          Neither does Monica point us to any argument made in the trial court regarding unconscionability\naside from disclosure.\n                                                   37\n\fthe agreement was unconscionableâ€”we do not reach the disclosure question. Based\n\non the foregoing, we cannot conclude that the trial court erred in finding the prenuptial\n\nagreement enforceable. Monica's fifth cross-issue is overruled.\n\nE. Custody\n\n        By her sixth and final cross-issue, Monica argues that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in entering possession orders that substantially deviated from the family code\n\nstandard orders. Monica argues that appellant failed to overcome the presumption that\n\nthe family code's standard possession orders were in the best interest of the child.\n\n        In the spring of 2007, the trial court entered a modified temporary possession order\n\nunder which Robert was given possession of the couple's child on the first, third, and\n\nfourth weekends of the month and for forty-two days in the summer. This arrangement\n\nwas entered as the final possession order in the July 2009 final divorce decree. Having\n\nreviewed the possession order temporarily and then finally entered by the trial court, we\n\nagree with Monica that it does differ from the standard possession order contained in the\n\nfamily code. The standard possession order applicable to this case would give Robert\n\npossession of the child on the first, third, and fifth weekends of the month and for thirty\n\ndays in the summer. See TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. Â§ 153.312 (West Supp. 2011) (detailing\n\nthe standard possession order for parents who reside 100 miles apart or less).24\n\n        Monica appears to argue that Robert presented no evidence at a January 2007\n\nhearing to justify the deviation from the standard possession orders. However, Monica\n\nhas not provided this Court with a record from that hearing, so we are unable to address\n\n        24\n          Although Monica moved from McAllen, Texas to Brownsville, Texas at some point during the\ndivorce proceedings, it is not disputed that the parties have at all times lived within 100 miles of each other.\n                                                      38\n\fher arguments related to the evidence, if any, presented at that hearing. See Appleton v.\n\nAppleton, 76 S.W.3d 78, 87 (Tex. App.â€”Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, no pet.) (holding that\n\nthe burden of providing a record showing error requiring reversal is on the appellant)\n\n(citing Christiansen v. Prezelski, 782 S.W.2d 842, 843 (Tex. 1990); Budd v. Gay, 846\n\nS.W.2d 521, 523 (Tex. App.â€”Houston [14th Dist.] 1993, no writ)). Regardless, this\n\nissue ultimately addresses the final possession order entered by the trial court, so we will\n\nconsider any evidence relevant to possession cited by the parties and contained in the\n\nrecord before us.25\n\n        As Monica posits, it is true that the family code includes a rebuttable presumption\n\nthat the standard possession order \"provides reasonable minimum possession of a child\n\nfor a parent named as possessory conservator or joint managing conservator\" and \"is in\n\nthe best interest of the child.\" TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. Â§ 153.252(a)-(b) (West 2008). The\n\nparty seeking a deviation from the standard possession order has the burden to establish\n\nthat the modification is in the best interest of the child. Prause v. Wilder, 820 S.W.2d\n\n386, 387 (Tex. App.â€”Texarkana 1991, no writ). But it is within the discretion of the trial\n\ncourt to determine what is in the best interest of the child. E.C. v. Graydon, 28 S.W.3d\n\n825, 828 (Tex. App.â€”Corpus Christi 2000, no pet.); Prause, 820 S.W.2d at 387. \"[T]he\n\nstandard possession order serves as a tool for determining possession, and the court has\n        25\n            Monica attaches to her brief an affidavit detailing the proceedings on the temporary possession\norder and her opinions regarding the propriety of the temporary order. But we are unable to consider that\naffidavit as it was filed for the first time on appeal and is, therefore, not a part of the appellate record subject\nto our review. See Gulf Oil Corp. v. Southland Royalty Co., 478 S.W.2d 583, 591 (Tex. Civ. App.â€”El Paso\n1972), aff'd, 496 S.W.2d 547 (Tex. 1973) (holding that our duty, as an appellate court, is to consider only the\ntestimony adduced and the evidence tendered and/or admitted before the trial court); see also Noble\nExploration v. Nixon Drilling, 794 S.W.2d 589, 592 (Tex. App.â€”Austin 1990, no writ) (holding that\ndocuments not introduced into evidence at trial are not properly included in the record and cannot be\nconsidered on appeal); City of Galveston v. Shu, 607 S.W.2d 942, 945 (Tex. Civ. App.â€”Houston [1st Dist.]\n1980, no writ) (same).\n                                                        39\n\fthe ability to alter the terms when it is in the best interest of the child and devise a\n\npossession order that is suitable for the custody situation at issue.\" Graydon, 28 S.W.3d\n\nat 829-30. Because the trial court is in the best position to observe the demeanor and\n\npersonalities of the witnesses and can feel forces, powers, and influences that cannot be\n\ndiscerned by merely reading the record, we will not disturb the trial court's determination\n\nabsent an abuse of discretion. Id. at 829.\n\n       Here, it is undisputed by the parties that Monica moved from McAllen, Texas to\n\nBrownsville, Texas at some point during the pendency of the divorce. This increased the\n\ndistance between the parties' residences by over sixty miles. The parties appear to\n\nagree that this was the motivating factor behind the trial court's modification of the\n\ntemporary possession order, which increased the length of Robert's periods of\n\npossession and which was then finalized in the divorce decree.          Monica points to\n\nevidence at trial which she claims shows that the increase in distance between the parties\n\nwas irrelevant; she contends that the evidence at trial showed that Robert has not held a\n\nsteady job in the last nine years (i.e., his schedule is flexible) and that, since Monica\n\nmoved to Brownsville, Robert had been having lunch with the couple's child at his school\n\nthree to four times a week. Monica contends that this evidence shows that Robert\n\nshould have been able to comply with the standard orders even with the greater distance\n\ninvolved. Monica also points to evidence: that Robert did not take the couple's child to\n\nhis soccer and baseball games and birthday parties for the child's friends when he had\n\npossession; that the child had a close relationship with his grandparents and cousins and\n\nwas unable to see them because of Robert's possession on most weekends of the month;\n\n\n                                             40\n\fand of an outcry made by the couple's child involving allegedly inappropriate behavior by\n\nRobert while he was bathing the child. Monica contends that this evidence weighs\n\nagainst the trial court's order that increased possession time for Robert was in the child's\n\nbest interest.\n\n        Here, it is clear that the trial court gave great weight to the increased distance\n\nbetween the parties, which justified the greater-length periods of possession by Robert;\n\nand did not give determinative weight to the foregoing evidence cited by Monica\n\nregarding Robert's employment status, Robert's decisions and behavior during his\n\nperiods of possession, and the alleged outcry by the child in making its determination that\n\nthe best interests of the child required a variation from the standard possession orders.\n\nAnd because the trial court was in the best position to observe the demeanor of the\n\nwitnesses and otherwise judge the credibility of the evidence related to the custody\n\nsituation in this case, we will not disturb its weighing of the evidence in this case and will\n\ndefer to its discretionary determination. See id. at 829-30. In other words, there was\n\nevidence supporting a deviation from the standard possession order, and the trial court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion in entering the varying order. See id. at 829; see also\n\nPrause, 820 S.W.2d at 387. Monica's sixth cross-issue is overruled.26\n\n        26\n           In connection with the trial court's final possession order, Monica timely requested findings of fact\nfrom the court. See TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. Â§ 153.258 (West 2008) (\"[I]n all cases in which possession of a\nchild by a parent is contested and the possession of the child varies from the standard possession order, on\nwritten request . . . , the court shall state in the order the specific reasons for the variance from the standard\norder.\"). The trial court did not enter the requested findings. Monica urges that, should this Court find that\nthe evidence supporting the deviation in this case was sufficient, the proper disposition of this cross-issue\nwould be to remand the custody issue to the trial court for entry of the requested findings. However,\nMonica has not explained why she was harmed by the trial court's failure to enter the requested findings.\nSee TEX. R. APP. P. 44.1. And in any event, \"[t]he test for determining whether the complainant has\nsuffered harm [by the trial court's refusal to enter findings of fact] is whether the circumstances of the case\nwould require an appellant to guess the reason or reasons that the judge has ruled against it.\" Gray v.\nGray, 971 S.W.2d 212, 217 (Tex. App.â€“Beaumont 1998, no pet.) (citing Sheldon Pollack Corp. v. Pioneer\n                                                       41\n\f                                            X. Conclusion\n\n        Having held that the trial court abused its discretion in entering the jury's\n\nreimbursement verdict in the divorce decree, characterizing AG Edwards #5657 as\n\npartially Robert's separate property, valuing the heirloom engagement ring at only\n\n$10,000, refusing to submit the number 602 Texas State Bank Account to the jury for\n\ncharacterization, and generally dividing the community estate in an inequitable manner,\n\nwe reverse the trial court's division of property and remand this case to the trial court for a\n\nnew trial as to the number 602 account, in particular, and a new division of the estate after\n\nthe new trial and in light of the holdings in this case. We affirm the remainder of the\n\ndivorce decree.\n\n\n                                                                           NELDA V.

Here, where she appears to agree by the\nargument and analysis in her brief that the trial entered the deviating order because of the increased\ndistances between the parties' residences, Monica cannot credibly claim that she was forced to guess the\ntrial court's reasons for entry of a possession order that deviated from the standard order. We are\ntherefore not persuaded by Monica's urging that we remand this issue for findings of fact by the trial court.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    42\n\f",

After a jury trial and several post-trial\n\nhearings, the trial court entered a decree of divorce dividing the couple's property and\n\nestablishing custody for the couple's one minor child. By fifteen issues, Robert argues\n\fthat: the evidence did not support the jury's findings on various questions; the form in\n\nwhich certain questions were submitted to the jury was erroneous; the trial court erred in\n\nholding post-trial evidentiary hearings and entering various aspects of the divorce decree\n\nbased on the evidence presented at those hearings; and the trial court erred in refusing to\n\nfile findings of fact and conclusions of law. By six cross-issues, Monica challenges:\n\nvarious determinations by the jury and trial court concerning the characterization of\n\ncertain marital property, the prenuptial agreement, and custody; the valuation of Monica's\n\nseparate property; and the division of property as inequitably disproportionate. We\n\naffirm, in part, and reverse and remand, in part.\n\n                                     I. Background\n\n       Robert and Monica were married in 1994. Prior to the marriage, the couple\n\nsigned an \"Agreement in Contemplation of Marriage,\" in which they agreed that \"all\n\nincome or revenue . . . from the parties' separate property, as designated in . . . Schedules\n\nA and B of this agreement, be and remain the separate property of the the party whose\n\nseparate estate causes the income to be generated.\" Two documents were attached to\n\nthe agreement: one document (which although not labeled, was clearly meant to be\n\n\"Schedule A\") purported to list Robert's separate property; the other document\n\n(\"Schedule B\") purported to list Monica's separate property.\n\n       In May 2005, stating that the marriage \"has become insupportable because of\n\ndiscord or conflict of personalities . . . that destroys the legitimate ends of the marriage\n\nrelationship and prevents any reasonable expectation of reconciliation,\" Monica\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\fpetitioned for divorce. Robert counter-petitioned for divorce, citing the same grounds.1\n\n        In November 2006, the case was tried to a jury, which was questioned on:\n\ncustody of Monica and Robert's one minor child; the amount of reimbursement, if any,\n\nowed to the community estate against Robert's house in McAllen, Texas; attorneyâ€™s and\n\nad litem's fees; the value of the community property and the separate property of each\n\nspouse; the characterization as community or separate of an heirloom engagement ring\n\nand two AG Edwards accounts; and the value of the ring and the AG Edwards accounts.\n\nThe jury found that Robert and Monica should be appointed joint managing conservators\n\nand that Monica should have the \"exclusive right to designate the primary residence of\n\nthe child\" \"without regard to geographic location.\" In response to the reimbursement\n\nquestion, the jury found that $25,000 was \"the amount of the reimbursement\n\nclaim . . . proved in favor of the community estate [of Robert and Monica] against\n\n[Robert]'s residence located [in] McAllen.\" The jury awarded neither party any attorneys'\n\nfees and found that Robert and Monica were each responsible for fifty percent of the ad\n\nlitem fees.       Jury questions nine through eleven involved the characterization and\n\nvaluation of the community and separate property estates. The jury valued the heirloom\n\nring at $10,000; AG Edwards Account Number xxxx-5657-xxxx (AG Edwards #5657) at\n\n$74,000; and AG Edwards Account Number xxxx-5621-xxxx (AG Edwards #5621) at\n\n$130,000. 2       The jury characterized the heirloom ring as 100% Monica's separate\n\nproperty; AG Edwards #5657 as 80% Robert's separate property and 20% community\n\n\n        1\n           Monica also stated as grounds for divorce \"cruel treatment [by Robert] . . . that renders further\nliving together insupportable.\"\n        2\n            The valuation of the ring and two AG Edwards accounts was included in jury question eleven.\n                                                     3\n\fproperty; and AG Edwards #5621 as 100% community property. 3 The jury then valued\n\nthe community and separate estates as follows:                    $144,800 as community property;\n\n$10,000 as Monica's separate property; and $59,200 as Robert's separate property.4\n\n       After the jury trial and over the next couple of years, the trial court held a series of\n\nhearings dealing with various topics such as possession of the couple's child and the\n\ndivision of further community property that was not submitted to the jury for\n\ncharacterization and valuation. The divorce decree, which was entered on July 23,\n\n2009, therefore embodied both the jury's verdict and various findings made by the court\n\nafter trial concerning custody and the additional property.\n\n       The decree appointed Robert and Monica joint managing conservators of their\n\nchild and ordered that Monica is the conservator with the right to designate and establish\n\nthe child's primary residence without regard to geographic restriction. The decree set\n\nout Robert and Monica's rights and duties as joint managing conservators and entered\n\npossession orders for the child regarding weekends, spring break, summer, and holidays.\n\nThe decree ordered Robert to pay child support and set out the parties' responsibilities\n\nregarding various aspects of child care such as educational and health care expenses\n\nand medical notification.\n\n       Next, the decree divided the property from what the court characterized as the\n\n\"marital\" estate. The decree awarded the following \"marital\" property to Monica: the\n\njury's $25,000 reimbursement verdict; $72,400 as her portion of the community property\n\nverdict; personal property from the community estate valued at approximately $42,000; a\n\n       3\n           The characterization of the property was included in jury question ten.\n       4\n           The valuation of the community and separate estates was included in jury question nine.\n                                                      4\n\f$25,000 judgment as her portion of the community estate's personal property that was\n\nindicated to be sold5; and two Texas State Bank accounts, one International Bank of\n\nCommerce account, and two AG Edwards accounts, the values of which were not listed in\n\nthe decree.6 The decree awarded the following \"marital\" property to Robert: $72,400 as\n\nhis portion of the jury's community property verdict; personal property from the community\n\nestate valued at approximately $170,000; the remainder of the personal property\n\nindicated to be sold, which was valued at $242,707.95 after subtracting the $25,000\n\njudgment owed to Monica; two Texas State Bank accounts, the values of which were not\n\nlisted in the decree; and all of the additional accounts listed in \"Exhibit D\" to the decree,\n\nthe listed values for which accounts totaled approximately $516,000.7\n\n        The decree ordered that Robert and Monica were each fifty percent responsible for\n\nthe community estate's approximate $20,000 debt; the decree further ordered that Robert\n\nwas to reimburse Monica $968 for medical expenses incurred during the divorce and was\n\nresponsible for the balance due on the 2004 F-250 truck he was awarded as part of his\n\nportion of the community property. Finally, the decree confirmed the jury's verdict on the\n\n        5\n            The property to be sold was listed in \"Exhibit C\" to the decree and was valued at $267,707.95.\n        6\n        The \"marital\" property awarded to Monica, with values ascertainable by the decree, totaled\napproximately $164,000.\n        7\n          The value we state for Exhibit D represents the total for those accounts with definite amounts\nincluded in the exhibit. In addition, Exhibit D listed seven accounts with \"pending value[s].\" We did not\ninclude these values in our approximate total for Exhibit D. As discussed further in the opinion, it appears\nfrom the testimony and evidence that some of accounts listed in Exhibit D are closed; are not owned by\nRobert and Monica but rather by other family members; or are merely alternate account numbers for\naccounts covered by the prenuptial agreement or accounts submitted to the jury for characterization and\nvaluation.\n         The decree also awarded Robert the real property in McAllen, Texas, which the decree\ncharacterized as \"marital\" property and the value of which was not included in the decree. However, the\nparties appear to agree that the house and acreage at this address was Robert's separate property.\n       The \"marital\" property awarded to Robert, with values ascertainable by the decree, totaled\napproximately $1,001,000.\n                                                      5\n\fcouples' separate property, awarding Monica $10,000 and Robert $59,200 pursuant to\n\njury questions nine, ten, and eleven.\n\n       Robert requested that the trial court file findings of fact and conclusions of law,\n\nwhich the trial court did not do. Both Robert and Monica filed motions for new trial, which\n\nwere overruled by operation of law. This appeal followed.\n\n                 II. Submission of Reimbursement Question to Jury\n\n       By his fourth issue, Robert argues that the trial court erred in submitting question\n\nfive to the jury, which asked the jury to \"[s]tate in dollars the amount of the reimbursement\n\nclaim, if any proved in favor of the community estate.\" (Emphasis omitted.)

Monica's pleadings, which\n\nreferenced the benefit to Robert's separate property of her \"time, talent, labor and effort,\"\n\nwere sufficient to give fair notice of her reimbursement claim. Because Robert did not\n\nfile special exceptions, the trial court was allowed to liberally construe Monica's\n\npleadings, and it did not abuse its discretion in submitting a question to the jury on\n\nreimbursement.

Robert argues that Monica\n\npresented no evidence at trial regarding any increase to the value of Robert's house as a\n\nresult of her \"time, talent, labor, and effort.\" He further argues that the evidence relevant\n\nto reimbursement admitted at trial showed only that Monica engaged in normal\n\nmaintenance and upkeep of the house, which would not support a claim for\n\nreimbursement.

Analysis\n\n       At trial, Monica testified that when she and Robert moved into Robert's house\n\nshortly after the beginning of their marriage, the house was essentially a hunting cabin or\n\nlodge. She then described in detail the efforts she made during the marriage to improve\n\nthe house, including renovating the kitchen, bathrooms, bedroom, and living room. In\n\nconnection with those improvements, Monica admitted into evidence various receipts\n\nfrom furniture stores and other retailers detailing items she had purchased for the house,\n\nincluding couches, beds, dining room furniture, and playground equipment.\n\n       However, having reviewed the record, we find no testimony or other evidence at\n\ntrial about the value of the house either before or after the improvements made by\n\nMonica. And it is the enhancement to the value of the house, not the costs paid by the\n\ncommunity estate, that are the relevant and proper measurement of a reimbursement\n\nclaim. See id.; see also Vickery, 999 S.W.2d at 371. In other words, although Monica\n\ngave detailed descriptions of the improvements she made to Robert's house, her\n\ntestimony and the receipts she admitted were, alone, insufficient evidence of the\n\ndifference in market value of the house before and after the improvements, and without\n\nevidence of any increase in value, there was a complete absence of evidence of a vital\n\nfact necessary to the reimbursement claim. See City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 810; King\n\nRanch, Inc., 118 S.W.3d at 751. In short, Monica did not meet her burden to establish\n\nthe benefit of the community's efforts to Robert's separate estate. See Vallone, 644\n\nS.W.2d at 459. Thus, even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict\n\n\n                                            11\n\fand indulging every reasonable inference in favor of it, we still cannot conclude the jury's\n\n$25,000 reimbursement verdict was supported by legally sufficient evidence as there was\n\nsimply no evidence at trial supporting that dollar amount. Del Lago Partners, Inc., 307\n\nS.W.3d at 770; City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 822, 827. And because the reimbursement\n\nclaim was not supported by legally sufficient evidence, the trial court erred in awarding\n\nMonica the reimbursement verdict in the divorce decree. This $25,000 award to Monica\n\nmaterially affected the just and right division of the estate, and as such, the trial court's\n\nerror was a clear abuse of discretion. See Pletcher, 9 S.W.3d at 446; see also Chavez,\n\n269 S.W.3d at 766. Robert's second, third, and fifth issues are sustained.8\n\n                    IV. Characterization and Valuation of Stock Accounts\n\n        By his tenth, eleventh, and twelfth issues,9 Robert argues that the trial court erred\n\nin entering judgment on the jury's answers to questions ten and eleven, which asked the\n\njury to characterize two AG Edwards stock accounts as community or separate property\n\nand assign a dollar value to the accounts, respectively. By these issues, Robert argues\n\nboth that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury's answers to questions ten and\n\neleven and that \"it was improper and error for the [trial court] to enter [into the divorce\n\ndecree the] monetary amounts\" awarded by the jury \"instead of percentage values.\"\n\n        In its answer to question ten, the jury characterized the first AG Edwards\n\naccountâ€”AG Edwards #5657â€”as eighty percent Robert's separate property and twenty\n\npercent community property; the jury characterized the second AG Edwards\n        8\n           Having sustained Robert's second, third, and fifth issues on the basis of legally insufficient\nevidence of enhancement to value, we need address neither his argument that the evidence was factually\ninsufficient nor his argument that Monica's efforts in improving the house amounted only to normal\nmaintenance and upkeep. See TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1.\n        9\n            In his original brief, these issues were Robert's eleventh, thirteenth, and fifteenth issues.\n                                                       12\n\faccountâ€”AG Edwards #5621â€”as one-hundred percent community property.                     In its\n\nanswer to question eleven, the jury valued AG Edwards #5657 at $74,000, and the jury\n\nvalued AG Edwards #5621 at $130,000.\n\n       As to Robert's argument that the jury's answer to question ten is supported by\n\ninsufficient evidence, he provides no legal authority regarding the characterization of\n\nproperty in a divorce, record citations, or substantive analysis applying the law to the facts\n\nof this case. As such, this argument is inadequately briefed and waived. See TEX. R.\n\nAPP. P. 38.1(i); Graves v. Tomlinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2278060\"><a href=\"/opinion/2278060/graves-v-tomlinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">329</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 162 (Tex. App.â€”Houston [14th\n\nDist.] 2010, pet. denied).\n\n       As to Robert's argument that the jury's answer to question eleven is supported by\n\ninsufficient evidence, we have reviewed the relevant evidence presented at trial.\n\nFinancial statements for the two accounts were admitted at trial as evidence. The\n\nstatement for AG Edwards #5657 showed a current value of $63,134.32; the statement\n\nshowed the initial cost for opening the account to be $73,981.93. The statement for AG\n\nEdwards #5621 showed a current value of $156,173.60; the statement showed the initial\n\ncost for opening the account to be $129,952.12. Based on the foregoing, there was\n\nclearly a basis in the evidence for the jury's verdict. The jury could have reasonably\n\nassigned a value of $74,000 to the AG Edwards #5657 account based on the costs\n\nexpended by the parties in opening the account.            Likewise, the jury could have\n\nreasonably assigned a value of $130,000 to AG Edwards #5621 based on the costs\n\nexpended in opening that account.        We therefore conclude that the evidence was\n\nsufficient to support the jury's answer to question eleven.\n\n\n                                             13\n\f       Robert's final argument is that the trial court erred in incorporating the jury's\n\nanswer to question eleven into the divorce decree because the accounts are stock\n\naccounts with fluctuating values and, therefore, it was error to enter monetary amounts as\n\nopposed to percentage values. In support of this argument, Robert cites this Court's\n\nopinion in May v. May, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1776908\"><a href=\"/opinion/1776908/may-v-may/\"><span class=\"volume\">716</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. App.â€”Corpus Christi 1986, no writ). But\n\nhaving reviewed May, we cannot conclude it stands for the proposition Robert implies it\n\ndoes. In May, we reviewed the trial court's division of a husband's retirement account\n\nupon divorce from his wife. Id. at 706. The Court engaged in a complicated analysis of\n\nthe mathematics used as the \"proper method of dividing future interests in retirement\n\nbenefits.\" Id. at 707-11. May does not apply to the facts of this case; it is an analysis\n\nspecific to the division of retirement benefits. In other words, May does not stand for the\n\nproposition that a divorce decree may only contain percentage ownership values for stock\n\naccounts, and in our research, we have found no other law standing for this proposition.\n\nWe are therefore not persuaded by Robert's argument in this regard.\n\n       In sum, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support the dollar amounts\n\nassigned to the stock accounts by the jury and that the trial court did not err in entering\n\nthose dollar amounts into the divorce decree. Robert's tenth, eleventh, and twelfth\n\nissues are overruled.\n\n                        V. Submission of Jury Question Nine\n\n       By his eighth issue, Robert argues that the trial court erred in submitting question\n\nnine to the jury because it differed from the applicable pattern jury charge. Question nine\n\nand the jury's answers to the question follow:\n\n\n                                            14\n\f      State in dollars the value of each of the following items:\n\n      PROPERTY VALUE\n\n      (Community Property, if any, MONICA MICHELENA AND ROBERT\n      MICHELENA)\n\n      $ ___144,800___\n\n      PROPERTY (Separate Property, if any, of MONICA MICHELENA\n\n      $ __10,000___\n\n      PROPERTY (Separate Property, if any, of ROBERT MICHELENA)\n\n      $ __59,200___\n\n      Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 278 provides that the trial court's \"[f]ailure to submit\n\na question shall not be deemed a ground for reversal of the judgment, unless its\n\nsubmission, in substantially correct wording, has been requested in writing and tendered\n\nby the party complaining of the judgment . . . .\" TEX. R. CIV. P. 278. Here, at the charge\n\nconference, although counsel for Robert objected to question nine and requested that it\n\nconform to the relevant pattern jury charge, counsel never tendered her proposed\n\nquestion to the trial court in writing.

Citing Goetz v. Goetz, Robert\n\nappears to argue that the division of the couple's property was the sole province of the\n\njury, and the trial court therefore erred in considering the post-trial evidence and entering\n\nvarious portions of the divorce decree based on that evidence. See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2411594\"><a href=\"/opinion/2411594/goetz-v-goetz/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">716</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n718 (Tex.

Monica responds that it became apparent\n\nafter trial that a substantial amount of property possessed by the couple had not been\n\ndisclosed by Robert prior to trial.11 Monica responds that because Robert did not request\n\nthat this property be submitted to the jury for characterization as community or separate\n\nor for valuation, he has waived his right to complain of the trial court's characterization,\n\nvaluation, and division of the property without the jury. Monica then asserts that the trial\n\ncourt acted within its discretion to determine post-trial that the property was community\n\nproperty and divide it in a just and right manner. We agree with Monica.\n\n       As Robert posits, it is generally true that all disputed fact issues in a divorce case\n\nmust be submitted to a jury where, as was the case here, a jury is timely demanded. See\n\nid. (citations omitted). But it is also true that the \"[p]roperty possessed by either spouse\n\nduring or on dissolution of marriage is presumed to be community property\" unless\n\nproven otherwise by \"clear and convincing evidence.\"                        TEX.

It matters not that the property\n\nwas not disclosed until after trial. As discussed above, all property possessed by either\n\nspouse during the marriage is subject to the community-property presumption. Robert\n\nwas obliged to submit that property to the jury for characterization, if he so desired, and\n\nhis failure to do so waived our review of his complaints regarding the trial court's post-trial\n\ndeterminations regarding the undisclosed property. As such, we overrule his thirteenth\n\nthrough fifteenth issues to the extent they complain of the foregoing determinations by the\n\ntrial court.\n\n                     VII.

See TEX. R. CIV. P. 296, 297.

App.â€”El Paso 2007, no pet.) (citations omitted). In\n\nseveral of his issues related to determinations made by the trial court after trial, Robert\n\nmakes an almost identical conclusory statement that because of the trial court's \"refus[al]\n\nto file findings of fact and conclusions of law,\" he \"has been harmed and cannot ascertain\n\nthe reasons for the ruling.\" Aside from those singular, conclusory statements, however,\n\nRobert does not explain how those rulings were based on multiple grounds for recovery or\n\notherwise identify the reason why we should presume the sort of harm he alleges. See\n\nTEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i); Liberty Mut. Fire Ins., 243 S.W.3d at 794. In short, we are not\n\npersuaded by Robert's brief that he was harmed by the trial court's refusal to file findings\n\nand conclusions.

In his seventh and ninth issues, Robert appears to challenge the evidence\n\nsupporting the jury's answers to questions nine and ten, respectively, which involved the\n\nvaluation of the couple's separate and community property estates and the\n\ncharacterization of certain property as community or separate. But Robert does not\n\nprovide the applicable standard of review or any substantive law on the characterization\n\nor valuation of property in a divorce case.

The Cross-Appeal\n\n      By six cross-issues, Monica challenges various aspect of the divorce decree,\n\nincluding the characterization, valuation, and division of the marital property and the\n\ncustody orders.\n\nA. Characterization of Property\n\n      By two issues, Monica challenges the characterization of certain property as\n\nseparate rather than community property.\n\n      As stated previously, property possessed by either spouse during the marriage is\n\npresumed to be community property unless that presumption is overcome by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence that the property in question is the separate property of one spouse.\n\nSee TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. Â§ 3.003(a)-(b).\n\n             In order to rebut the community property presumption, the party\n      claiming separate property must trace and identify the property claimed as\n      separate property by clear and convincing evidence. Tracing involves\n      establishing the separate origin of the property through evidence showing\n      the time and means by which the spouse originally obtained possession of\n      the property. Separate property will retain its character through a series of\n\n                                             20\n\f        exchanges so long as the party asserting separate ownership can\n        overcome the presumption of community property by tracing the assets on\n        hand during the marriage back to property that, because of its time and\n        manner of acquisition, is separate in character.\n\nWalton v.

If the trial court\n\ndoes mischaracterize property in its division of the marital estate, the error does not\n\nrequire reversal \"unless the mischaracterization would have had more than a de minimis\n\neffect on the [] court's just and right division of the property.\" Vandiver, 4 S.W.3d at 302\n\n(citations omitted).\n\n        1. Texas State Bank Accounts\n\n        By her first cross-issue, Monica argues that the trial court abused its discretion in\n\ndetermining that three Texas State Bank accountsâ€”one with an account number ending\n\nin 602, one with an account number ending in 694, and one with a certificate of deposit\n\nnumber ending in 549â€”were Robert's separate property because Robert failed to\n\novercome the presumption that the accounts were community property by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence.13 The trial court determined that the evidence showed that the 602\n\naccount and the 549 certificate of deposit consisted of funds directly traceable to bank\n\naccounts or other properties listed in the prenuptial agreement; granted Robert's motion\n\nfor directed verdict on those accounts; and, therefore, did not submit those accounts to\n\n        13\n           It is undisputed that Robert was in possession of the three accounts during the marriage. At the\ntime of the divorce, the number 602 account had a balance of $498,366.21; the number 549 certificate of\ndeposit had a balance of $100,000; and the balance of the number 694 account was unknown.\n                                                    21\n\fthe jury for characterization and valuation.14 Monica contends that there was insufficient\n\nevidence tracing the funds in these accounts to the prenuptial accounts and properties,\n\nand as such, the trial court erred in characterizing the accounts as Robert's separate\n\nproperty. We construe Monica's first cross-issue as a challenge to the trial court's\n\ngranting of Robert's motion for directed verdict.\n\n        \"It is error to grant a directed verdict when the evidence raises any issue of\n\nmaterial fact.\" Connell v.

In other\n        14\n          As to the number 694 account, in particular, there was evidence at trial that the account belonged\nto Robert's mother. Robert testified that he was listed on the account but that he never deposited or\nwithdrew money from the account or otherwise assisted his mother with her finances. Robert testified that\nhis mother listed him on the account because she is a widow and \"she just wants that in case anything\nhappens\" to her. This characterization of the number 694 account was not contested by Monica at trial,\nand she presented no evidence that the 694 account was either Robert's separate property or the couple's\ncommunity property. We conclude that Robert's testimony at trial, which was never contradicted by\nMonica, established that the number 694 account was an account owned by his motherâ€”it was neither his\nseparate property nor the property of the marital estate. Thus, we cannot conclude that the trial court erred\nin determining that the 694 account should not be submitted to the jury for characterization.\n                                                    22\n\fwords, an instructed verdict is proper in two instances: when there is no evidence or\n\nwhen the evidence has no probative value or force. Id.\n\n       Here, Robert points us to evidence at trial linking the funds in the 602 account and\n\nthe 549 certificate of deposit to the accounts and properties included in the prenuptial\n\nagreement. First, as to the number 602 account, there was evidence at trial that Robert\n\nand his family sold two trailer parksâ€”El Valle De Sol and Manlorsons Estatesâ€”in 1999.\n\nBoth parks were included in the prenuptial agreement as Robert's separate property.\n\nRobert's share from the sale of the trailer parks totaled somewhat less than $500,000.\n\nRobert's testimony at trial then indicated that the funds in the 602 account were generated\n\nby his proceeds from the sale of the trailer parks.\n\n       Second, as to the number 549 certificate of deposit, Robert testified at trial that it\n\nwas generated from funds in a First State Bank and Trust money market account listed in\n\nthe prenuptial agreement. Robert testified that he opened the First State Bank money\n\nmarket account in 1981 but, at some point, Texas State Bank acquired First State Bank.\n\nRobert testified that the money market account stayed the same after the acquisition,\n\nexcept that Texas State Bank added a digit to the account number. Robert then opened\n\nthe number 549 certificate of deposit with funds from the money market account. Robert\n\ntestified that no money has been withdrawn from the certificate of deposit since it was\n\nopened. We find no evidence in the record that the 549 certificate of deposit was\n\ncommunity property.\n\n       As to the number 602 account, in particular, Monica points us to evidence from trial\n\nthat community funds were commingled with the number 602 account. See Irvin v.\n\n\n                                             23\n\fParker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2354555\"><a href=\"/opinion/2354555/irvin-v-parker/\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 708 (Tex.

(citation omitted) (\"[I]f\n\nthe evidence shows that separate and community property have become so commingled\n\nas to defy re[-]segregation and identification, the community presumption prevails.\").\n\nFirst, Monica points us to evidenceâ€”namely, a series of cleared checksâ€”that she\n\ndeposited community funds in the 602 account. Second, Monica points us to evidence\n\nthat Robert took out a $40,000 loan during the marriage that he deposited into the 602\n\naccount; the record includes bank documents and testimony by Robert substantiating this\n\nfact, as well.   Because any loan taken out during the marriage is presumed to be\n\ncommunity property, Robert commingled community funds with the 602 account when he\n\ndeposited the loan into that account. See TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. Â§ 3.003(a)-(b). Finally,\n\nMonica points us to testimony by herself and Robert that Robert deposited wages from\n\nvarious jobs he held during the marriage into the 602 account.\n\n       Based on the foregoing testimony and evidence, we conclude that Robert\n\nadequately traced the 549 certificate of deposit to a money market account that was\n\nincluded in the prenuptial agreement. There is no evidence in the record that the 549\n\ncertificate of deposit was community property, and we believe Robert showed by clear\n\nand convincing evidence how he originally obtained the property and how the property\n\nretained its separate character throughout a series of exchanges during the marriage.\n\nSee Walton, 879 S.W.2d at 946; Vandiver, 4 S.W.3d at 302. There was no fact issue as\n\nto the characterization of the 549 certificate of deposit, and thus, we cannot conclude that\n\nthe trial court erred in concluding that this account was Robert's separate property,\n\ngranting Robert's directed verdict as to this account, and refusing to submit this account\n\n\n                                            24\n\fto the jury.

See id.; see also Irvin, 139\n\nS.W.3d at 708. As such, the evidence created a fact issue as to whether the number 602\n\naccount retained its separate character, and the trial court erred in granting Robert's\n\ndirected verdict as to this account and not submitting the account to the jury for\n\ncharacterization. See Irvin, 139 S.W.3d at 708; see also Connell, 889 S.W.2d at 538-39.\n\nMonica's first cross-issue is sustained as to the number 602 account.\n\n       2. AG Edwards Accounts\n\n       By her second cross-issue, Monica challenges the portion of the decree finding\n\nthat $144,800 was community property and $59,200 was Robert's separate property,\n\narguing that Robert failed to overcome the presumption that the entire amounts in the two\n\nAG Edwards accounts submitted to the jury were community property by tracing the\n\namounts to his separate property. Monica argues that, as a result, the jury's valuation of\n\nthe community property estate at $144,800 was against the great weight and\n\npreponderance of the evidence.\n\n       Before beginning our analysis, we note that AG Edwards #5621, first discussed\n\nabove in Part V of this opinion, was determined by the jury to be 100 percent community\n\nproperty and its entire amount ($130,000) was included in the jury's community property\n\n\n                                            25\n\fvaluation. As such, although Monica's second issue generally challenges the jury's\n\nanswers as to both accounts, we cannot construe the issue as complaining of the verdict\n\nas to the #5621 account. Rather, the relevant determination here seems to be the jury's\n\nvaluation of Robert's separate estate at $59,200, which represents eighty percent of the\n\nvalue of the #5657 account, and the remainder of the community estate at $14,800, which\n\nrepresents twenty percent of the #5657 account. We also note that by phrasing her\n\nchallenge as one concerning the \"great weight and preponderance\" of the evidence,\n\nMonica appears to challenge the factual sufficiency of the evidence, and we will treat this\n\nissue as such.\n\n       Under the heightened clear and convincing evidence standard of review applicable\n\nto this issue, when an appellate court conducts a factual sufficiency review of a separate\n\nproperty finding in a divorce proceeding, the court must conclude that the evidence is\n\nfactually insufficient if the court determines that no reasonable fact finder could form a firm\n\nbelief or conviction of the truth of its finding.

And if the reviewing\n\ncourt determines that the evidence is factually insufficient, the court must detail why it has\n\nreached this conclusion. Id.\n\n       It is undisputed that Robert was in possession of AG Edwards #5657 during the\n\nmarriage. In Part IV of this opinion, we determined that the $74,000 value assigned to\n\nthe #5657 account by the jury was supported by the evidence and reasonable. In\n\nsupport of her second cross-issue, Monica asserts that the only evidence at trial that AG\n\n\n                                              26\n\fEdwards #5657 was Robert's separate property was his testimony that he deposited\n\nseveral checks from the number 602 Texas State Bank accountâ€”which we previously\n\nheld was correctly determined to be Robert's separate propertyâ€”into the #5657 account.\n\nMonica asserts that \"the checks do not reflect the account number that [Robert] testified\n\nto and the total amount of the checks was far less than the account balance in said\n\naccounts at the time of the trial before the jury.\"\n\n       Having reviewed the evidence cited by Monica, we find that the cleared checks do\n\nindeed reflect deposits totaling approximately $32,000 made by Robert from the Texas\n\nState Bank 602 account into an AG Edwards account. The cleared checks do not reflect\n\nthe AG Edwards account into which the funds were deposited. However, Robert later\n\ntestified that the checks were deposited into the AG Edwards account he called his \"cash\n\naccount.\" Robert testified that he held two accounts at AG Edwardsâ€”an \"IRA\" and a\n\n\"cash account.\" Robert's testimony and the exhibits introduced at trial indicate that the\n\n\"IRA\" is AG Edwards #5657 and the \"cash account\" is AG Edwards #5621. Thus, these\n\nchecks, which were intended to evidence transfer of separate funds into the #5657\n\naccount, do not accomplish their seeming purpose. The cleared checks are, instead,\n\nevidence of separate funds deposited into the #5621 account.15 We therefore agree with\n\nMonica that the checks are no evidence of separate funds deposited into the #5657\n\naccount.\n\n       Robert points us to testimony, which he asserts amounts to sufficient evidence to\n\ntrace the funds in the #5657 account to an IRA listed in the prenuptial agreement.\n       15\n          Because the #5621 account was determined by the jury to be 100 percent community property\nand neither party challenges that characterization, we do not address whether the jury erred in so\ncharacterizing the #5621 account.\n                                                27\n\fRobert testified that the funds in the New York Life Mainstay IRA account listed in the\n\nprenuptial agreement were transferred to open the #5657 account with AG Edwards.\n\nHowever, Robert provides no documentation regarding the New York Life Mainstay\n\naccount; specifically, he provides no documentation evidencing the balance of the New\n\nYork Life Mainstay account at the time it was closed such that we can trace it to the\n\nopening balance of the #5657 account.

(holding that the community property presumption\n\nprevailed where wife failed to trace the assets in the allegedly separate account with any\n\ndocumentary evidence); see also Walton, 879 S.W.2d at 946; Vandiver, 4 S.W.3d at 302.\n\nWe are therefore not persuaded that Robert's testimony, alone, amounts to sufficient\n\ntracing evidence.\n\n      In sum, absent additional evidence, we cannot conclude the jury's characterization\n\nof AG Edwards #5657 as eighty percent Robert's separate property was supported by\n\nclear and convincing evidence.      Because it was possessed by Robert during the\n\nmarriage, the account was presumed to be community property, and he bore a heavy\n\nburden to establish otherwise. See TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. Â§ 3.003(a)-(b); Walton, 879\n\nS.W.2d at 946. The cleared checks showing deposits from Robert's separate account\n\ninto an AG Edwards accountâ€”the only documentary evidence apparent in the record\n\nreflecting separate funds flowing to an AG Edwards accountâ€”were clearly not deposited\n\ninto the #5657 (the \"IRA\") account. No reasonable juror could have formed a firm belief\n\nor conviction based on this evidence alone that the #5657 account included Robert's\n\nseparate funds. In other words, Robert's testimony attempting to link the account to the\n\n\n                                           28\n\fprenuptial agreement was not enough.           We conclude that the community property\n\npresumption should have prevailed and the account should have been characterized as\n\n100 percent community property. It likewise follows from this that the jury's valuation of\n\nthe community estate at $144,800 was not supported by the evidence. With both AG\n\nEdwards accounts characterized as 100 percent community property, we conclude that\n\nthe correct community estate valuation by the jury would have been $204,000.16\n\n       Finally, we conclude that, in light of the foregoing, the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in entering a divorce decree that memorialized these characterizations and\n\nvaluations by the jury. In the final divorce decree, the trial court ordered that Monica\n\nreceive $72,400 as her portion of the community property valuation determined by the\n\njuryâ€”i.e., half of $144,800. However, the record in this case demonstrates that the jury's\n\ncharacterization of the #5657 account as partially Robert's separate property was not\n\nsupported by clear and convincing evidence. See Chavez, 269 S.W.3d at 766. And\n\nentering the decree on the basis of this unsupported characterization was an abuse of\n\ndiscretion by the trial court that materially affected the just and right division of the\n\ncommunity estate. See id. Under the evidence presented at trial, the jury should have\n\ncharacterized both AG Edwards accounts as one hundred percent community property,\n\nand the community property estate should have been valued at $204,000. Half of this\n\namount would have been $102,000â€”$29,600 more than Monica received in the decree\n\nissued by the court. Therefore, the trial court clearly abused its discretion in entering a\n\nfinal decree that: awarded Robert $59,200 as his separate property from the #5657\n\n       16\n          AG Edwards #5621 was valued by the jury at $130,000, and AG Edwards #5657 was valued at\n$74,000, both of which values we affirmed in Part V of this opinion.\n                                               29\n\faccount; and awarded Monica only $72,400 as her share of the community property.\n\nRobert was not entitled to a separate property award based on the AG Edwards account;\n\nMonica was entitled to a larger community property award, as a result; and this error by\n\nthe trial court materially affected the just and right division of the parties' estate.\n\n        Monica's second cross-issue is sustained.\n\nB. Valuation of Monica's Separate Property\n\n        By her third cross-issue, Monica challenges the portion of the decree\n\nmemorializing the jury's verdict that an heirloom ring Robert gifted her was valued at\n\n$10,000, arguing that the jury's answer as to the ring's value was against the great weight\n\nand preponderance of evidence. 17                Monica asserts that the only evidence at trial\n\nconcerning the value of the ring was Robert's testimony that the ring was worth more than\n\n$20,000.       We accept this assertion as true as it is not disputed by Robert and is\n\nsupported by the record. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(g).\n\n        Under a factual sufficiency standard, the reviewing court determines whether the\n\nverdict is so against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence as to be\n\nmanifestly unjust.

In fact, the only evidence submitted as to the ring's value conclusively\n\nestablished a different verdict than the one issued by the jury. See Cadle Co. v. Ortiz,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1753693\"><a href=\"/opinion/1753693/cadle-co-v-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">831</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 834-35 (Tex.

We therefore\n\nconclude that the jury's verdict that the ring was worth $10,000 was so against the great\n\nweight and preponderance of the evidence that it was manifestly unjust. And because\n\nthe jury's verdict was not supported by the evidence, the trial court clearly abused its\n\ndiscretion in entering a decree memorializing that verdict. See Chavez, 269 S.W.3d at\n\n766; Magness, 241 S.W.3d at 912. Monica's third cross-issue is sustained.\n\nC. Division of Property\n\n       By her fourth cross-issue, Monica argues that the trial court's division of the\n\ncommunity property in this case was so disproportionate as to be inequitable. Monica\n\nargues that the division was not supported by the evidence and was therefore an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n       \"In a decree of divorce . . . , the court shall order a division of the estate of the\n\nparties in a manner that the court deems just and right, having due regard for the rights of\n\neach party . . . .\" TEX.

Monica was also\nawarded three community bank accounts and two AG Edwards investment accounts, but the amount of\nfunds in those accounts was not included in the decree.\n                                                   32\n\fMonica appears to base this assertion on the following amounts awarded in the decree to\n\nRobert, which totaled approximately $1,001,000: $72,400 as his portion of the jury's\n\ncommunity property verdict; personal property from the community estate valued at\n\napproximately $170,000; the remainder of the personal property indicated to be sold,\n\nwhich was valued at $242,707.95 after subtracting the $25,000 judgment owed to\n\nMonica; and all of the accounts listed in \"Exhibit D\" of the decree, the listed values for\n\nwhich accounts totaled approximately $516,000.\n\n       We note at the outset that all of the accounts listed in Exhibit D were either closed\n\naccounts, accounts owned by other family members and not Robert and Monica, or\n\nalternate account numbers for accounts covered by the prenuptial agreement or accounts\n\nsubmitted to the jury for characterization and valuation. The evidence before the trial\n\ncourt shows that the first account on Exhibit D, a Texas State Bank account with a number\n\nending in 690 with a listed value of $105,464.06, was an account closed by Robert during\n\nthe marriage and transferred into the Texas State Bank number 602 account we\n\npreviously held to be Robert's separate property.19 The second account, a Texas State\n\nBank account with a number ending in 190, has a \"pending value,\" and the evidence\n\nbefore the trial court shows it to be the account number for a loan Robert took out for legal\n\nexpenses during the divorce proceedings. The third account, a First State Bank account\n\nwith a number ending in 090, has a \"pending value,\" and the evidence before the trial\n\ncourt shows it to be the First State Bank account included in the prenuptial agreement that\n\nwe previously concluded in Part IX.A.1 of this opinion to be the same as the Texas State\n\n\n       19\n            Monica does not address the origin of the funds in the number 690 account by this issue.\n                                                    33\n\fBank number 602 account correctly determined to be Robert's separate property. The\n\nfourth account, a First State Bank account with a number ending in 534, has a \"pending\n\nvalue,\" and no witness at trial could identify this account. The fifth account, a \"Mainstay\n\nFunds\" account with a number ending in 144, is clearly the New York Life IRA account\n\nincluded in the prenuptial agreement as Robert's separate property. The sixth account,\n\nan AG Edwards account with a number ending in 954, has a \"pending value,\" and\n\nRobert's undisputed testimony at trial identified this account as belonging to his mother.\n\nThe seventh and eighth accounts, AG Edwards accounts with numbers ending in\n\n441-007 and 441-061, have values of $52,875.03 and $45,233.94, and the evidence\n\nbefore the trial court showed these to be alternative numbers for the same AG Edwards\n\n#5657 account submitted to the jury for characterization and valuation. The ninth and\n\ntenth accounts, AG Edwards accounts with numbers ending in 784-007 and 784-061,\n\nhave \"pending values,\" and the evidence before the trial court showed these accounts to\n\nbe IRAs opened by Monica and Robert in their son's name. The eleventh and twelfth\n\naccounts, AG Edwards accounts with numbers ending in 524-007 and 524-061, have\n\nvalues of $134,810.83 and $124,979.07, respectively, and the evidence before the trial\n\ncourt showed these to be alternative numbers for the same AG Edwards #5621 account\n\nsubmitted to the jury for characterization and valuation. The thirteenth and final account\n\non Exhibit D, a New York Life Annuity with a number ending in 972, has a \"pending value,\"\n\nand is clearly the account number for a life insurance policy in Robert's name, a policy\n\nwhich is addressed nowhere in the divorce decree.\n\n       In light of the foregoing, we do not agree with Monica that Robert's share of the\n\n\n                                            34\n\fmarital property can be fairly characterized to include any of the $516,000 listed for the\n\naccounts in Exhibit D.           Subtracting that from the $1,001,000 Monica claims Robert\n\nreceived, Robert is left with a total of approximately $485,000, which represents\n\napproximately seventy-five percent of the marital estate.\n\n        As to the remainder of the division, Robert and Monica received equal shares of\n\nthe amount determined by the jury to be community propertyâ€”each received half of\n\n$144,800, or $72,400.             And for purposes of our analysis here, the various other\n\ncommunity accounts awarded to the parties without values listed in the decree do not aid\n\nus in our analysis of the rightness of the trial court's division. So, it follows that the next\n\nseemingly most disproportionate division of the property was the division of the marital\n\nestate's personal property.20 Robert received $170,000 worth of community personal\n\nproperty to keep and $242,707.95 worth of the personal property indicated to be sold, for\n\na total of approximately $413,000. By contrast, Monica received approximately $42,000\n\nworth of community personal property to keep and a $25,000 judgment as her portion of\n\nthe community property that was indicated to be sold, for a total of approximately\n\n$67,000. In short, Robert received approximately eighty-six percent of the community\n\npersonal property, and Monica received only fourteen percent.\n\n        Monica argues that this disproportionate division was inappropriate because there\n\nwas no evidence that she possessed any of the advantages considered by trial courts in\n\nawarding one party a disproportionate share of the marital estate. Rather, she asserts,\n\nthe evidence at trial showed that Robert was at fault in the break-up of the marriage; that\n\n        20\n             Neither party challenges the trial court's characterization of the personal property as community\nproperty.\n                                                      35\n\fRobert had a sizable separate estate relative to Monica; and that Robert had superior\n\nbusiness opportunities and earning capacities.                  See Viera, 331 S.W.3d at 203-04.\n\nThese factual assertions are not disputed by Robert and are supported by the record. 21\n\nSee TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(g). And Robert does not point us to any evidence that weighs in\n\nfavor of the disproportionate share of community property awarded to him in the divorce\n\ndecree.22\n\n        Thus, we conclude that the trial court's award to Robert of approximately\n\nseventy-five percent of the community property listed in the decree was not supported by\n\nthe evidence. See Evans, 14 S.W.3d at 345-46. There was no evidence that Robert\n\nwas disadvantaged by any of the factors relevant to a disproportionate division, and as\n\nsuch, no reasonable basis existed for awarding him more than one-half of the community\n\nproperty.     See Fischer-Stoker, 174 S.W.3d at 277.                    In short, the disproportionate\n\namount of community property awarded to Robert in the divorce decree was inequitable\n\nand constituted an abuse of discretion by the trial court. See id.; see also Evans, 14\n\nS.W.3d at 345-46. Monica's fourth cross-issue is sustained.\n\nD. Prenuptial Agreement\n\n        By her fifth cross-issue, Monica argues that the trial court abused its discretion in\n\nnot finding the couple's prenuptial agreement \"unconscionable as a matter of law\" in that\n\nit failed to fairly and reasonably disclose Robert's property and financial obligations.\n\n        21\n           Robert's sole argument in response to Monica's fourth cross-issue is that the trial court erred in\nholding the post-trial hearings and dividing community property without submitting those issues to the jury.\nFor the same reasons given in Part VII of this opinion, we are not persuaded by this argument.\n        22\n            See Fredonia State Bank v.

Based\n\non the foregoing, we cannot conclude that the trial court erred in finding the prenuptial\n\nagreement enforceable. Monica's fifth cross-issue is overruled.\n\nE. Custody\n\n        By her sixth and final cross-issue, Monica argues that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in entering possession orders that substantially deviated from the family code\n\nstandard orders. Monica argues that appellant failed to overcome the presumption that\n\nthe family code's standard possession orders were in the best interest of the child.\n\n        In the spring of 2007, the trial court entered a modified temporary possession order\n\nunder which Robert was given possession of the couple's child on the first, third, and\n\nfourth weekends of the month and for forty-two days in the summer. This arrangement\n\nwas entered as the final possession order in the July 2009 final divorce decree. Having\n\nreviewed the possession order temporarily and then finally entered by the trial court, we\n\nagree with Monica that it does differ from the standard possession order contained in the\n\nfamily code. The standard possession order applicable to this case would give Robert\n\npossession of the child on the first, third, and fifth weekends of the month and for thirty\n\ndays in the summer. See TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. Â§ 153.312 (West Supp. 2011) (detailing\n\nthe standard possession order for parents who reside 100 miles apart or less).24\n\n        Monica appears to argue that Robert presented no evidence at a January 2007\n\nhearing to justify the deviation from the standard possession orders. However, Monica\n\nhas not provided this Court with a record from that hearing, so we are unable to address\n\n        24\n          Although Monica moved from McAllen, Texas to Brownsville, Texas at some point during the\ndivorce proceedings, it is not disputed that the parties have at all times lived within 100 miles of each other.\n                                                      38\n\fher arguments related to the evidence, if any, presented at that hearing.

Because the trial court is in the best position to observe the demeanor and\n\npersonalities of the witnesses and can feel forces, powers, and influences that cannot be\n\ndiscerned by merely reading the record, we will not disturb the trial court's determination\n\nabsent an abuse of discretion. Id. at 829.\n\n       Here, it is undisputed by the parties that Monica moved from McAllen, Texas to\n\nBrownsville, Texas at some point during the pendency of the divorce. This increased the\n\ndistance between the parties' residences by over sixty miles. The parties appear to\n\nagree that this was the motivating factor behind the trial court's modification of the\n\ntemporary possession order, which increased the length of Robert's periods of\n\npossession and which was then finalized in the divorce decree.          Monica points to\n\nevidence at trial which she claims shows that the increase in distance between the parties\n\nwas irrelevant; she contends that the evidence at trial showed that Robert has not held a\n\nsteady job in the last nine years (i.e., his schedule is flexible) and that, since Monica\n\nmoved to Brownsville, Robert had been having lunch with the couple's child at his school\n\nthree to four times a week. Monica contends that this evidence shows that Robert\n\nshould have been able to comply with the standard orders even with the greater distance\n\ninvolved. Monica also points to evidence: that Robert did not take the couple's child to\n\nhis soccer and baseball games and birthday parties for the child's friends when he had\n\npossession; that the child had a close relationship with his grandparents and cousins and\n\nwas unable to see them because of Robert's possession on most weekends of the month;\n\n\n                                             40\n\fand of an outcry made by the couple's child involving allegedly inappropriate behavior by\n\nRobert while he was bathing the child. Monica contends that this evidence weighs\n\nagainst the trial court's order that increased possession time for Robert was in the child's\n\nbest interest.\n\n        Here, it is clear that the trial court gave great weight to the increased distance\n\nbetween the parties, which justified the greater-length periods of possession by Robert;\n\nand did not give determinative weight to the foregoing evidence cited by Monica\n\nregarding Robert's employment status, Robert's decisions and behavior during his\n\nperiods of possession, and the alleged outcry by the child in making its determination that\n\nthe best interests of the child required a variation from the standard possession orders.\n\nAnd because the trial court was in the best position to observe the demeanor of the\n\nwitnesses and otherwise judge the credibility of the evidence related to the custody\n\nsituation in this case, we will not disturb its weighing of the evidence in this case and will\n\ndefer to its discretionary determination. See id. at 829-30. In other words, there was\n\nevidence supporting a deviation from the standard possession order, and the trial court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion in entering the varying order. See id. at 829; see also\n\nPrause, 820 S.W.2d at 387. Monica's sixth cross-issue is overruled.26\n\n        26\n           In connection with the trial court's final possession order, Monica timely requested findings of fact\nfrom the court. See TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. Â§ 153.258 (West 2008) (\"[I]n all cases in which possession of a\nchild by a parent is contested and the possession of the child varies from the standard possession order, on\nwritten request . . . , the court shall state in the order the specific reasons for the variance from the standard\norder.\"). The trial court did not enter the requested findings. Monica urges that, should this Court find that\nthe evidence supporting the deviation in this case was sufficient, the proper disposition of this cross-issue\nwould be to remand the custody issue to the trial court for entry of the requested findings. However,\nMonica has not explained why she was harmed by the trial court's failure to enter the requested findings.\nSee TEX. R. APP. P. 44.1. And in any event, \"[t]he test for determining whether the complainant has\nsuffered harm [by the trial court's refusal to enter findings of fact] is whether the circumstances of the case\nwould require an appellant to guess the reason or reasons that the judge has ruled against it.\" Gray v.\nGray, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1573113\"><a href=\"/opinion/1573113/gray-v-gray/\"><span class=\"volume\">971</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 217 (Tex.
