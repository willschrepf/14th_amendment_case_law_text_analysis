This palpable error, in which the Court below joined, and which, because of its frequency, can scarcely be regarded as typographical, occasionally is encountered even in some legal encyclopedias. For example, in 50 Am.Jur., Statutes, &#167; 528, page 535, under the caption <i>\"Express Saving Provisions in Repealing Statutes,\"</i> we find the form \"savings\" and the form \"saving\" each used three times in the same paragraph, each time followed by the word \"clause.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since we are here dealing with statutory construction and not with bank accounts, \"saving\" is, of course, the precise word.

On the other hand, &#167; 19 of the repealing act of 1885, supra, contained the following special <i>saving</i> proviso:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"All prosecutions pending at the time of the taking effect of this act shall be continued the same as if this act had not been passed.\" With this legislative and factual situation before it, the Supreme Court of Kansas said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The question as to what should be repealed and what saved was before the legislature. They had the entire subject-matter thereof under consideration, and evidently intended to cover the entire ground; and evidently intended that nothing should be repealed except what they expressly repealed, and that nothing should be saved except what they expressly stated should be saved. They expressly saved some things; therefore it must be inferred that they intended to save no others. <i>Expressio unius est exclusio alterius.</i> The legislature evidently intended that the special saving clause which they enacted in section 19 of the act of 1885 should take the place of all others, so far as prosecutions under original section 7 were concerned; and <i>that in cases where the special saving clause could apply the general saving statute should have no operation.</i> `It is a well-settled rule of construction that specific provisions relating to a particular subject must govern in respect to that subject, as against general provisions in other parts of the law which might otherwise be broad enough to include it.' Felt v. Felt, 19 Wis. [193] 196. `It is familiar law that a later statute will operate as a repeal of a former, though it contains no express repeal, and even though its provisions are not absolutely repugnant to those of the former, whenever it is obvious that the one was intended as a substitute for the other.' [Cases cited.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"If, however, the saving clause in section 19 of the act of 1885 was not intended by the legislature to cover the entire ground, and to be a substitute for the general saving statute so far as cases like this are concerned, then the saving clause contained in section 19 of the act of 1885 has no office to perform, but is absolutely worthless, for the general saving clause would save all that it saves and very much more. Such an interpretation of the law as this would violate all proper canons of construction. It would in effect say that the legislature had done the very foolish thing of enacting a saving clause which can have no real operation at all, and can subserve no actual purpose whatever. `It is a well-settled rule that when any statute is revised, or one act framed from another, some parts being omitted, the parts omitted are not to be revived by construction, but are to be considered as annulled. To hold otherwise would be to impute to the legislature gross carelessness or ignorance, which is altogether inadmissible.' Ellis v. Paige, [1 Pick. 43] 18 Mass.

The relevant provisions of the latter are quoted below.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a> It is not at all clear that it was the legislative intent to wipe out the liability of those in the situation of appellees for unpaid taxes levied for the years 1949 through 1952, but rather that section 2(a) had another and different purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Significantly, the history of the 1953 legislation shows that section 2 of the original bill was deleted in the course of the bill's consideration. That section in unmistakable terms had forgiven and abrogated all pre-1953 taxes. Concurrently, the phrase \"and abrogating and repealing all accrued and unpaid taxes levied thereunder\" was deleted from the bill's title. Thus the legislature had before it in the original bill clear language which would have forgiven the taxes here in question. It chose, instead, to reject the language.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In material part section 2(a) of the Act as finally passed reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Section 2. Section 1 of this Act shall not be applicable to: (a) any taxes which have been levied and assessed by any municipality, school or public utility district under the provisions of Chapter 10, Session Laws of Alaska 1949, as amended, or which are levied and assessed during the current fiscal year of such municipality, school or public utility district; * * *.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of what has been said above, the section is fairly construable as intending no more than a grant to the municipalities and school and public utility districts &#8212; but not to the Territory itself &#8212; of the right to levy and collect taxes for the then current year, namely 1953, both before and after the repealing act had taken effect. There was a logical reason for granting this right to these local districts in that the legislature may well have felt it undesirable to interfere with their current fiscal programs, whether or not the levies for that year had yet been made. As so construed, section 2 (a) is readable in para materia with the General Savings Statute, above quoted, as not interfering with the collection of unpaid 1949-1952 taxes, either of the Territory or of the taxing districts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As was recognized by the trial judge but is not mentioned in the majority opinion here, it is a fundamental rule of statutory construction that general savings clauses or statutes preserve rights and liabilities which have accrued under an act repealed, and that they operate to make applicable in designated situations the law as it existed before the repeal, <i>unless such application is negatived by the express terms or clear implication of a particular repealing act.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My brothers, as I understand them, do not contend that such application is negatived by the express terms of the 1953 legislation, but rather is to be gathered by implication. To me, however, the legislation in the respects here in question is fundamentally ambiguous, both in its meaning and in the motives inspiring its enactment.

They expressly saved some things; therefore it must be inferred that they intended to save no others. <i>Expressio unius est exclusio alterius.</i> The legislature evidently intended that the special saving clause which they enacted in section 19 of the act of 1885 should take the place of all others, so far as prosecutions under original section 7 were concerned; and <i>that in cases where the special saving clause could apply the general saving statute should have no operation.</i> `It is a well-settled rule of construction that specific provisions relating to a particular subject must govern in respect to that subject, as against general provisions in other parts of the law which might otherwise be broad enough to include it.' Felt v. Felt, 19 Wis. [193] 196. `It is familiar law that a later statute will operate as a repeal of a former, though it contains no express repeal, and even though its provisions are not absolutely repugnant to those of the former, whenever it is obvious that the one was intended as a substitute for the other.'

Such an interpretation of the law as this would violate all proper canons of construction. It would in effect say that the legislature had done the very foolish thing of enacting a saving clause which can have no real operation at all, and can subserve no actual purpose whatever. `It is a well-settled rule that when any statute is revised, or one act framed from another, some parts being omitted, the parts omitted are not to be revived by construction, but are to be considered as annulled. To hold otherwise would be to impute to the legislature gross carelessness or ignorance, which is altogether inadmissible.' Ellis v.

The relevant provisions of the latter are quoted below.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a> It is not at all clear that it was the legislative intent to wipe out the liability of those in the situation of appellees for unpaid taxes levied for the years 1949 through 1952, but rather that section 2(a) had another and different purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Significantly, the history of the 1953 legislation shows that section 2 of the original bill was deleted in the course of the bill's consideration. That section in unmistakable terms had forgiven and abrogated all pre-1953 taxes. Concurrently, the phrase \"and abrogating and repealing all accrued and unpaid taxes levied thereunder\" was deleted from the bill's title. Thus the legislature had before it in the original bill clear language which would have forgiven the taxes here in question. It chose, instead, to reject the language.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In material part section 2(a) of the Act as finally passed reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Section 2. Section 1 of this Act shall not be applicable to: (a) any taxes which have been levied and assessed by any municipality, school or public utility district under the provisions of Chapter 10, Session Laws of Alaska 1949, as amended, or which are levied and assessed during the current fiscal year of such municipality, school or public utility district; * * *.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of what has been said above, the section is fairly construable as intending no more than a grant to the municipalities and school and public utility districts &#8212; but not to the Territory itself &#8212; of the right to levy and collect taxes for the then current year, namely 1953, both before and after the repealing act had taken effect. There was a logical reason for granting this right to these local districts in that the legislature may well have felt it undesirable to interfere with their current fiscal programs, whether or not the levies for that year had yet been made. As so construed, section 2 (a) is readable in para materia with the General Savings Statute, above quoted, as not interfering with the collection of unpaid 1949-1952 taxes, either of the Territory or of the taxing districts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As was recognized by the trial judge but is not mentioned in the majority opinion here, it is a fundamental rule of statutory construction that general savings clauses or statutes preserve rights and liabilities which have accrued under an act repealed, and that they operate to make applicable in designated situations the law as it existed before the repeal, <i>unless such application is negatived by the express terms or clear implication of a particular repealing act.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My brothers, as I understand them, do not contend that such application is negatived by the express terms of the 1953 legislation, but rather is to be gathered by implication. To me, however, the legislation in the respects here in question is fundamentally ambiguous, both in its meaning and in the motives inspiring its enactment. Accordingly I dissent from the majority holding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> \"Effect of repeals or amendments.
