The initial round of the litigation terminated when the Supreme Court modified our decision to remand to the district court and directed that court to make \"findings as to past and existing practice in the administration of the collective-bargaining agreements.\"    Ansonia Bd. of Educ. v.

The Board also rejected Philbrook's offer to pay a substitute teacher, rather than being docked the considerably larger amount of a day's pay, for religious observance days in excess of the three allowed.  Instead, the Board allowed Philbrook to take additional days, as required, in the form of unpaid leave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After exhausting all available administrative avenues to contest the Board's decision, Philbrook filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against the Board and the Union which alleged that the foregoing practices and policies (1) \"[have] operate[d] to deprive [Philbrook] of equal employment opportunity on account of his religion, in violation of 42 U.S.C.  [Sec.] 2000e-2(a) and (c), and defendant Union has failed to assist [Philbrook] fully in gaining relief from these unlawful practices;\"  and (2) \"have operated to deprive [Philbrook] of his right to the free exercise of his religion and have operated as an establishment of religion, in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\"    Philbrook sought both damages and injunctive relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an unpublished opinion, the district court dismissed the complaint, ruling that Philbrook \"has not been placed by the School Board or by the Union or any defendant officers thereof, in a position of violating his religion or losing his job.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, this court reversed, holding that Philbrook had established a prima facie case of religious discrimination.  We assumed that the Board's leave policy constituted a reasonable accommodation to Philbrook's religious beliefs, Philbrook, 757 F.2d at 484, but ruled that \"[w]here the employer and the employee each propose a reasonable accommodation, Title VII requires the employer to accept the proposal the employee prefers unless that accommodation causes undue hardship on the employer's conduct of his business.\"    Id.  The ruling was a gloss on 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e(j) (1988), which provides that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>The term \"religion\" includes all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief, unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably accommodate to an employee's or prospective employee's religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the district court had not addressed all the issues which we deemed relevant, we remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings.  757 F.2d at 488.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court, however, granted certiorari.  The Court addressed only the Title VII claim, observing that although Philbrook's complaint also alleged a violation of his free exercise rights under the first amendment, this court on appeal did not address the issue, and thus the Supreme Court had no occasion to do so.  Philbrook, 479 U.S. at 65 n. 4, 107 S.Ct., at 370 n. 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court framed the issue before it as \"whether the employer's proposed accommodation of [Philbrook's] religious practices comports with the statutory mandate of Sec. [2000e(j) ].\"  Id. at 68, 107 S.Ct. at 372.    The Court rejected our ruling requiring recognition of an employee preference, absent undue hardship, finding \"no basis in either the statute or its legislative history for requiring an employer to choose any particular reasonable accommodation.\"    Id. at 68, 107 S.Ct. at 372.    Rather, the Court held \"that an employer has met its obligation under Sec. [2000e(j) ] when it demonstrates that it has offered a reasonable accommodation to the employee.\"    Id. at 69, 107 S.Ct. at 372.    Accordingly, the Court concluded that the \"remaining issue in the case is whether the school board's leave policy constitutes a reasonable accommodation of Philbrook's religious beliefs.\"    Id. at 70, 107 S.Ct. at 372.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Addressing this issue, the Court said:  \"We think that the school board policy in this case, requiring respondent to take unpaid leave for holy day observance that exceeded the amount allowed by the collective-bargaining agreement, would generally be a reasonable one.\"    Id. at 70, 107 S.Ct. at 373.    The Court added, however, that \"unpaid leave is not a reasonable accommodation when paid leave is provided for all purposes except religious ones,\" because \"[a] provision for paid leave 'that is part and parcel of the employment relationship may not be doled out in a discriminatory fashion, even if the employer would be free ... not to provide the benefit at all.' \"    Id. at 71, 107 S.Ct. at 373 (quoting Hishon v. King &amp; Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 75, 104 S.Ct. 2229, 2233, 81 L.Ed.2d 59 (1984)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The Court concluded:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>Whether the policy here violates this teaching turns on factual inquiry into past and present administration of the personal business leave provisions of the collective-bargaining agreement.  The school board contends that the necessary personal business category in the agreement, like other leave provisions, defines a limited purpose leave.  Philbrook, on the other hand, asserts that the necessary personal leave category is not so limited, operating as an open-ended leave provision that may be used for a wide range of secular purposes in addition to those specifically provided for in the contract, but not for similar religious purposes.  We do not think that the record is sufficiently clear on this point for us to make the necessary factual findings, and we therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals remanding the case to the District Court.  The latter court on remand should make the necessary findings as to past and existing practice in the administration of the collective-bargaining agreements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court requested proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law from the parties before holding a hearing.  The court then issued a brief memorandum, which stated in pertinent part, \"Defendants have submitted on November 9, 1987 ... proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to which we have agreed and signed.\"    The court added, however:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We and plaintiff's counsel remain puzzled ... by the Supreme Court's direction that we should make the necessary findings as to the \"past and existing practices in the administration of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.\"    We surmise that this direction to the existing practice was based on its surmise that the Bargaining Agreement might have been changed since the date of the trial.  If so, we should be advised and accordingly will conduct future hearings on that issue if the Agreement has been changed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 4, 1989, the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing concerning the remand issue.  Despite the limitation intimated in the foregoing quotation, however, evidence was received regarding the various versions of the Agreement and their administration dating back to 1973.  Numerous personal leave request forms submitted by teachers were received in evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Testimony was provided by the current superintendent of schools for the Ansonia public school system, Robert E. Zuraw, a former superintendent, Richard F. Nicolari, and the president of the Ansonia Federation of Teachers, Josa Neves.  Zuraw, who approves leave requests, testified that \"necessary personal business\" leave may not be taken for reasons specified in the other leave provisions of the Agreement.  In addition, he continued, the stated reason \"has to be necessary, as far as being important, having some part in the persons [sic] family or personal life.\"    Accordingly, not all requests for \"necessary personal business\" leave are approved.  The \"necessary personal business\" leave day that is provided \"without approval,\" although \"at the professional staff member's discretion\" and not requiring a prior specification of its purpose, still cannot be taken for a purpose otherwise specified in the contract.  Further, the reason for taking the day is subject to inquiry after the fact to assure compliance with the Agreement.  As a general rule, teachers who wish to take a day's leave for a non-qualifying reason may do so, but are not paid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nicolari's testimony did not vary in substance from Zuraw's regarding any of the foregoing.  Nicolari stated that he would define \"necessary personal business\" to mean \"necessary and essential as opposed to frivolous and recreational.\"    Neves also confirmed Zuraw's testimony concerning the interpretation and administration of the various versions of the Agreement.  Neves further testified that paid leave had been denied on the basis of the limitations specified in the Agreement, and that some teachers, aware of those limitations, had at the outset requested unpaid leave for nonconforming leave requests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the hearing, the district court issued the further findings of fact and conclusions of law that are the subject of this appeal.  They closely parallel, but are not identical to, the findings and conclusions previously submitted by defendants and endorsed by the district court.  The key findings of fact are:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">10. \"Necessary personal business\" leave continues to be a limited purpose leave under the provisions of the current bargaining agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p>*   *   *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">13. The thrust of the restrictions on the use of the three days of \"necessary personal business\" leave is to disallow the taking of such leave by any teacher for reasons for which leave is provided under other provisions of the Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">14.

Verbatim adoption of findings prepared by prevailing parties has been criticized by the Supreme Court, see, e.g., Anderson, 470 U.S. at 571-72, 105 S.Ct. at 1510;  United States v. Marine Bancorporation, 418 U.S. 602, 615 n. 13, 94 S.Ct. 2856, 2866 n. 13, 41 L.Ed.2d 978 (1974);  United States v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., 376 U.S. 651, 656 &amp; n. 4, 84 S.Ct. 1044, 1047 &amp; n. 4, 12 L.Ed.2d 12 (1964), and by circuit courts.  See, e.g., Berger v. Iron Workers Reinforced Rodmen Local 201, 843 F.2d 1395, 1407-08 (D.C.Cir.) on rehearing, 852 F.2d 619 (D.C.Cir.1988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1105, 109 S.Ct. 3155, 104 L.Ed.2d 1018 (1989);  see also 9 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 2578, at 704-08 (1971 &amp; Supp.1990).  As we have stated, however, \"[t]his method of complying with Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a) is frowned upon, but is not necessarily fatal.\"    Dole Fresh Fruit Co. v. United Banana Co., 821 F.2d 106, 109 n. 2 (2d Cir.1987) (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the remand hearing, furthermore, the district court issued new findings.  Although these were also taken in large part from those proposed by the Board, modifications were made by the court.  The Supreme Court has observed that when a court does not \"simply adopt\" a party's proposed findings, \"the findings issued by the District Court represent the judge's own considered conclusions.  There is no reason to subject those findings to a more stringent appellate review than is called for by the applicable rules.\"    Anderson, 470 U.S. at 572-73, 105 S.Ct. at 1511.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p>B. The Findings of the District Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Philbrook contends that the district court's findings of fact did not squarely address the issue posed by the Supreme Court's remand, because \"the only limitations the district court found on the scope of personal leave were the ones that the Supreme Court had already noted when it requested further findings from the district court:  Personal leave is not permitted for uses otherwise specified in the contract.\"    Accordingly, he asks this court to set aside the factual findings of the district court and decide the case in his favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree.  Far from missing the point of the remand, the district court directed its attention to the precise issue as to which the Supreme Court required further findings.  As we view the matter, the Court was concerned whether the Agreement was essentially administered in accordance with its terms, or whether, on the contrary, \"necessary personal business\" leave \"may [in practice] be used for a wide range of secular purposes in addition to those specifically provided for in the contract, but not for similar religious purposes.\"    Philbrook, 479 U.S. at 71, 107 S.Ct. at 373.    Accordingly, a determination that the Agreement is in fact administered according to its terms addresses and settles the issue posed by the Court's remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remand record not only supported, but compelled, that conclusion.  There is no evidence in the remand record to support a finding that leave may be taken pursuant to the \"necessary personal business\" provision of the Agreement for all purposes except religious ones.  Rather, such leave may be taken for any reason deemed by the relevant administrator to fall within this general category, with the limitation that such leave may not be taken for those activities otherwise specified in another leave provision, whether religious in nature or not, or for \"[a]ny religious observance.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>   Thus, Philbrook is limited to three days of paid leave for mandated religious observance, and a colleague who is a delegate to a national veterans organization is limited to one day a year for activity in that capacity.  Neither may take any leave for such activity under the \"necessary personal business\" category, whether or not there is available unused leave in that category.  Either may take excess days for these purposes, but without pay.  The only difference is that the delegate will be charged against his leave account for the single day that he is allowed to take, should he take it, but Philbrook will not be charged for any of the three days of mandated religious observance that he may take.  See supra note 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The category of \"necessary personal business\" is, of course, somewhat nebulous, and thus requires judgment calls by the supervisors responsible for administering such leave.  No showing was made on remand, however, that in doing so, there is any general animus towards activities that are religious in nature or purpose, or that leave is denied for such activities except as specifically provided by the Agreement.  Accordingly, no case is made that religious discrimination violative of 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-2(a) and (c) (1988) has occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Apparently, despite the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 58, no separate judgment was entered following the district court's entry of findings of fact and conclusions of law adverse to Philbrook's claims on July 18, 1989.  Philbrook filed a notice of appeal \"from the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law filed July 18, 1989\" on July 21, 1989.  We nonetheless conclude that a proper appeal has been taken from a \"final decision[ ]\" of a district court within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291 (1988), thus vesting this court with appellate jurisdiction.  See Bankers Trust Co. v. Mallis, 435 U.S. 381, 98 S.Ct. 1117, 55 L.Ed.2d 357 (1978) (per curiam);  Fennell v.

Different versions of the Agreement are described at 757 F.2d 478-79, and the then-current version is set forth at id. 479 n. 2.

Nor, obviously, did the Supreme Court so read it, for the Court would hardly have remanded for findings concerning the administration of the Agreement if it deemed its very terms to require prohibited religious discrimination.  The Agreement specifies, we note, that leave may be taken for \"[i]mmediate family religious ceremony (Ordination, Vows, Bar Mitzvah, Bas Mitzvah, First Communion, Baptism),\" as well as for family and friend funeral attendance and family weddings, thus making clear that the separately specified categories of \"mandated religious observance\" and \"religious observance\" do not exhaustively cover all activities having a religious purpose</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The Board also rejected Philbrook's offer to pay a substitute teacher, rather than being docked the considerably larger amount of a day's pay, for religious observance days in excess of the three allowed.  Instead, the Board allowed Philbrook to take additional days, as required, in the form of unpaid leave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After exhausting all available administrative avenues to contest the Board's decision, Philbrook filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against the Board and the Union which alleged that the foregoing practices and policies (1) \"[have] operate[d] to deprive [Philbrook] of equal employment opportunity on account of his religion, in violation of 42 U.S.C.  [Sec.] 2000e-2(a) and (c), and defendant Union has failed to assist [Philbrook] fully in gaining relief from these unlawful practices;\"  and (2) \"have operated to deprive [Philbrook] of his right to the free exercise of his religion and have operated as an establishment of religion, in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\"    Philbrook sought both damages and injunctive relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an unpublished opinion, the district court dismissed the complaint, ruling that Philbrook \"has not been placed by the School Board or by the Union or any defendant officers thereof, in a position of violating his religion or losing his job.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, this court reversed, holding that Philbrook had established a prima facie case of religious discrimination.  We assumed that the Board's leave policy constituted a reasonable accommodation to Philbrook's religious beliefs, Philbrook, 757 F.2d at 484, but ruled that \"[w]here the employer and the employee each propose a reasonable accommodation, Title VII requires the employer to accept the proposal the employee prefers unless that accommodation causes undue hardship on the employer's conduct of his business.\"    Id.  The ruling was a gloss on 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e(j) (1988), which provides that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>The term \"religion\" includes all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief, unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably accommodate to an employee's or prospective employee's religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the district court had not addressed all the issues which we deemed relevant, we remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings.  757 F.2d at 488.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court, however, granted certiorari.  The Court addressed only the Title VII claim, observing that although Philbrook's complaint also alleged a violation of his free exercise rights under the first amendment, this court on appeal did not address the issue, and thus the Supreme Court had no occasion to do so.  Philbrook, 479 U.S. at 65 n. 4, 107 S.Ct., at 370 n. 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court framed the issue before it as \"whether the employer's proposed accommodation of [Philbrook's] religious practices comports with the statutory mandate of Sec. [2000e(j) ].\"  Id. at 68, 107 S.Ct. at 372.    The Court rejected our ruling requiring recognition of an employee preference, absent undue hardship, finding \"no basis in either the statute or its legislative history for requiring an employer to choose any particular reasonable accommodation.\"    Id. at 68, 107 S.Ct. at 372.    Rather, the Court held \"that an employer has met its obligation under Sec. [2000e(j) ] when it demonstrates that it has offered a reasonable accommodation to the employee.\"    Id. at 69, 107 S.Ct. at 372.    Accordingly, the Court concluded that the \"remaining issue in the case is whether the school board's leave policy constitutes a reasonable accommodation of Philbrook's religious beliefs.\"    Id. at 70, 107 S.Ct. at 372.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Addressing this issue, the Court said:  \"We think that the school board policy in this case, requiring respondent to take unpaid leave for holy day observance that exceeded the amount allowed by the collective-bargaining agreement, would generally be a reasonable one.\"    Id. at 70, 107 S.Ct. at 373.    The Court added, however, that \"unpaid leave is not a reasonable accommodation when paid leave is provided for all purposes except religious ones,\" because \"[a] provision for paid leave 'that is part and parcel of the employment relationship may not be doled out in a discriminatory fashion, even if the employer would be free ... not to provide the benefit at all.' \"    Id. at 71, 107 S.Ct. at 373 (quoting Hishon v.

The school board contends that the necessary personal business category in the agreement, like other leave provisions, defines a limited purpose leave.  Philbrook, on the other hand, asserts that the necessary personal leave category is not so limited, operating as an open-ended leave provision that may be used for a wide range of secular purposes in addition to those specifically provided for in the contract, but not for similar religious purposes.  We do not think that the record is sufficiently clear on this point for us to make the necessary factual findings, and we therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals remanding the case to the District Court.  The latter court on remand should make the necessary findings as to past and existing practice in the administration of the collective-bargaining agreements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court requested proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law from the parties before holding a hearing.  The court then issued a brief memorandum, which stated in pertinent part, \"Defendants have submitted on November 9, 1987 ... proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to which we have agreed and signed.\"    The court added, however:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We and plaintiff's counsel remain puzzled ... by the Supreme Court's direction that we should make the necessary findings as to the \"past and existing practices in the administration of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.\"    We surmise that this direction to the existing practice was based on its surmise that the Bargaining Agreement might have been changed since the date of the trial.  If so, we should be advised and accordingly will conduct future hearings on that issue if the Agreement has been changed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 4, 1989, the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing concerning the remand issue.  Despite the limitation intimated in the foregoing quotation, however, evidence was received regarding the various versions of the Agreement and their administration dating back to 1973.  Numerous personal leave request forms submitted by teachers were received in evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Testimony was provided by the current superintendent of schools for the Ansonia public school system, Robert E. Zuraw, a former superintendent, Richard F. Nicolari, and the president of the Ansonia Federation of Teachers, Josa Neves.  Zuraw, who approves leave requests, testified that \"necessary personal business\" leave may not be taken for reasons specified in the other leave provisions of the Agreement.  In addition, he continued, the stated reason \"has to be necessary, as far as being important, having some part in the persons [sic] family or personal life.\"    Accordingly, not all requests for \"necessary personal business\" leave are approved.  The \"necessary personal business\" leave day that is provided \"without approval,\" although \"at the professional staff member's discretion\" and not requiring a prior specification of its purpose, still cannot be taken for a purpose otherwise specified in the contract.  Further, the reason for taking the day is subject to inquiry after the fact to assure compliance with the Agreement.  As a general rule, teachers who wish to take a day's leave for a non-qualifying reason may do so, but are not paid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nicolari's testimony did not vary in substance from Zuraw's regarding any of the foregoing.  Nicolari stated that he would define \"necessary personal business\" to mean \"necessary and essential as opposed to frivolous and recreational.\"    Neves also confirmed Zuraw's testimony concerning the interpretation and administration of the various versions of the Agreement.  Neves further testified that paid leave had been denied on the basis of the limitations specified in the Agreement, and that some teachers, aware of those limitations, had at the outset requested unpaid leave for nonconforming leave requests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the hearing, the district court issued the further findings of fact and conclusions of law that are the subject of this appeal.  They closely parallel, but are not identical to, the findings and conclusions previously submitted by defendants and endorsed by the district court.  The key findings of fact are:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">10. \"Necessary personal business\" leave continues to be a limited purpose leave under the provisions of the current bargaining agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p>*   *   *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">13.

The Findings of the District Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Philbrook contends that the district court's findings of fact did not squarely address the issue posed by the Supreme Court's remand, because \"the only limitations the district court found on the scope of personal leave were the ones that the Supreme Court had already noted when it requested further findings from the district court:  Personal leave is not permitted for uses otherwise specified in the contract.\"    Accordingly, he asks this court to set aside the factual findings of the district court and decide the case in his favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree.  Far from missing the point of the remand, the district court directed its attention to the precise issue as to which the Supreme Court required further findings.  As we view the matter, the Court was concerned whether the Agreement was essentially administered in accordance with its terms, or whether, on the contrary, \"necessary personal business\" leave \"may [in practice] be used for a wide range of secular purposes in addition to those specifically provided for in the contract, but not for similar religious purposes.\"    Philbrook, 479 U.S. at 71, 107 S.Ct. at 373.    Accordingly, a determination that the Agreement is in fact administered according to its terms addresses and settles the issue posed by the Court's remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remand record not only supported, but compelled, that conclusion.  There is no evidence in the remand record to support a finding that leave may be taken pursuant to the \"necessary personal business\" provision of the Agreement for all purposes except religious ones.  Rather, such leave may be taken for any reason deemed by the relevant administrator to fall within this general category, with the limitation that such leave may not be taken for those activities otherwise specified in another leave provision, whether religious in nature or not, or for \"[a]ny religious observance.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>   Thus, Philbrook is limited to three days of paid leave for mandated religious observance, and a colleague who is a delegate to a national veterans organization is limited to one day a year for activity in that capacity.  Neither may take any leave for such activity under the \"necessary personal business\" category, whether or not there is available unused leave in that category.  Either may take excess days for these purposes, but without pay.  The only difference is that the delegate will be charged against his leave account for the single day that he is allowed to take, should he take it, but Philbrook will not be charged for any of the three days of mandated religious observance that he may take.  See supra note 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The category of \"necessary personal business\" is, of course, somewhat nebulous, and thus requires judgment calls by the supervisors responsible for administering such leave.  No showing was made on remand, however, that in doing so, there is any general animus towards activities that are religious in nature or purpose, or that leave is denied for such activities except as specifically provided by the Agreement.  Accordingly, no case is made that religious discrimination violative of 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-2(a) and (c) (1988) has occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Apparently, despite the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 58, no separate judgment was entered following the district court's entry of findings of fact and conclusions of law adverse to Philbrook's claims on July 18, 1989.  Philbrook filed a notice of appeal \"from the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law filed July 18, 1989\" on July 21, 1989.  We nonetheless conclude that a proper appeal has been taken from a \"final decision[ ]\" of a district court within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291 (1988), thus vesting this court with appellate jurisdiction.  See Bankers Trust Co. v.

Different versions of the Agreement are described at 757 F.2d 478-79, and the then-current version is set forth at id. 479 n. 2.

Nor, obviously, did the Supreme Court so read it, for the Court would hardly have remanded for findings concerning the administration of the Agreement if it deemed its very terms to require prohibited religious discrimination.  The Agreement specifies, we note, that leave may be taken for \"[i]mmediate family religious ceremony (Ordination, Vows, Bar Mitzvah, Bas Mitzvah, First Communion, Baptism),\" as well as for family and friend funeral attendance and family weddings, thus making clear that the separately specified categories of \"mandated religious observance\" and \"religious observance\" do not exhaustively cover all activities having a religious purpose</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
