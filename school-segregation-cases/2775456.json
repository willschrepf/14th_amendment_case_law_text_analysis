In two issues, Tiner contends the trial court erred in\ngranting summary judgment and dismissing her retaliation and discrimination claims. We affirm.\n\n                                           BACKGROUND\n        Tiner worked for the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) from 1986 to 1998 and\nagain from 2000 until she resigned in November 2003. During her second period of employment\nat TxDOT, Tiner and other of her coworkers had a problem with a coworker who was rude, abusive,\nand generally obnoxious. Tiner complained about the coworker’s behavior to her supervisor in May\n2003 and followed up with a written complaint on May 14, 2003. The coworker was fired in June\n2003.\n        Tiner made a further complaint when her supervisor slammed a door following an argument\nwith her. This led to a meeting attended by Tiner, her supervisor, and their regional supervisor.\nTiner alleges that, during the time between her first complaint about the coworker and her\nresignation, her supervisor stopped talking to her and ended her access to his email account. Tiner\nresigned in November 2003. In her letter of resignation, Tiner stated that she had decided to evaluate\n\fher “current goals and investigate new opportunities.”\n       In 2004, Tiner filed a complaint with the Civil Rights Division of the Texas Workforce\nCommission. In 2005, Tiner filed a lawsuit in district court alleging that she was constructively\nterminated and that she suffered discrimination based on her gender and retaliation for engaging in\na protected activity. TxDOT filed both traditional and no evidence motions for summary judgment,\nand Tiner filed a response to each motion. After a hearing, the trial court granted TxDOT’s motion\nfor summary judgment and dismissed Tiner’s claims. Tiner filed a motion for a new trial. The trial\ncourt denied that motion, and this appeal followed.\n\n\n                                       SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n       Tiner argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment against her. In her first\nissue, she argues that her complaint was timely filed. In her second issue, Tiner argues that she\npresented prima facie evidence of employment discrimination and retaliation.\nStandard of Review\n       The movant for traditional summary judgment has the burden of showing that there is no\ngenuine issue of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. TEX . R. CIV . P.\n166a(c); Nixon v. Mr. Prop. Mgmt. Co., 690 S.W.2d 546, 548 (Tex. 1985). A defendant moving\nfor summary judgment must either conclusively negate at least one essential element of the\nplaintiff’s cause of action or conclusively establish the elements of an affirmative defense.\nRandall’s Food Markets, Inc. v. Johnson, 891 S.W.2d 640, 644 (Tex. 1995). Once the movant has\nestablished a right to summary judgment, the nonmovant has the burden to respond to the motion\nfor summary judgment and to present to the trial court any issues that would preclude summary\njudgment. See City of Hous. v. Clear Creek Basin Auth., 589 S.W.2d 671, 678–79 (Tex. 1979).\n       Alternately, or in addition, after an adequate time for discovery has passed, a party without\nthe burden of proof at trial may move for a no evidence summary judgment on the ground that the\nnonmovant lacks supporting evidence for one or more essential elements of its claim. TEX . R. CIV .\nP. 166a(i). Once a no evidence motion has been filed in accordance with rule 166a(i), the burden\nshifts to the nonmovant to bring forth evidence that raises a fact issue on the challenged evidence.\nSee Ford Motor Co. v. Ridgway, 135 S.W.3d 598, 600 (Tex. 2004). We review a no evidence\n\n\n                                                   2\n\fmotion for summary judgment under the same legal sufficiency standards we use to review a directed\nverdict. King Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman, 118 S.W.3d 742, 750–51 (Tex. 2003). A no evidence\nmotion is properly granted if the nonmovant fails to bring forth more than a scintilla of probative\nevidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to an essential element of the nonmovant’s claim\non which the nonmovant would have the burden of proof at trial. Id. at 751. More than a scintilla\nof evidence exists if the evidence supporting a finding rises to a level that would enable reasonable,\nfair minded persons to differ in their conclusions. Id. Less than a scintilla of evidence exists when\nthe evidence is so weak as to do no more than create a mere surmise or suspicion of a fact, and the\nlegal effect is that there is no evidence. Id.\n        For both traditional and no evidence summary judgment motions, we review de novo the\nentire record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, indulging every reasonable inference and\nresolving any doubts against the motion. Sudan v. Sudan, 199 S.W.3d 291, 292 (Tex. 2006);\nKPMG Peat Marwick v. Harrison County Hous. Fin. Corp., 988 S.W.2d 746, 748 (Tex. 1999).\nIf the trial court’s order does not specify the grounds on which it granted summary judgment, we\naffirm the trial court’s ruling if any of the theories advanced in the motion are meritorious. State\nFarm Fire & Cas. Co. v. S.S., 858 S.W.2d 374, 380 (Tex. 1993). When a party moves for both a\ntraditional and a no evidence summary judgment, we first review the trial court’s summary judgment\nunder the no evidence standards of rule 166a(i). See Ridgway, 135 S.W.3d at 600. If the no\nevidence summary judgment was properly granted, we do not reach arguments relating to the\ntraditional motion for summary judgment. See id. at 602.\n        Our review is limited by the issues presented to the trial court. See TEX . R. CIV . P. 166a(c).\nWhen reviewing a summary judgment, courts of appeals should consider all summary judgment\ngrounds ruled on by the trial court and preserved for appellate review that are necessary for final\ndisposition of the appeal. See Cincinnati Life Ins. Co. v. Cates, 927 S.W.2d 623, 626 (Tex.1996).\nHowever, an appellate court may, in the interest of judicial economy, consider other grounds that the\nmovant preserved for review, despite the fact that the trial court did not rule on them. Id.\nApplicable Law\n        Texas law prohibits employment discrimination with respect to race, color, disability,\nreligion, sex, national origin, or age. TEX . LAB. CODE ANN . § 21.051 (Vernon 2006). This statute\nwas designed by the legislature to “provide for the execution of the policies of Title VII of the Civil\n\n                                                   3\n\fRights Act of 1964 and its subsequent amendments.” Id. § 21.001(1); see also Griggs v. Duke\nPower Co., 401 U.S. 424, 431, 91 S. Ct. 849, 853, 28 L. Ed. 2d 158 (1971). Accordingly, Texas\nstate courts turn to analogous federal statutes and cases interpreting them to guide their reading and\ninterpretation of employment discrimination statutes. See Ysleta Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Monarrez, 177\nS.W.3d 915, 917 (Tex. 2005).\n        Section 21.051 of the Labor Code provides that\n\n\n              [a]n employer commits an unlawful employment practice if because of race, color,\n              disability, religion, sex, national origin, or age the employer:\n\n              (1) fails or refuses to hire an individual, discharges an individual, or discriminates\n              in any other manner against an individual in connection with compensation or the\n              terms, conditions, or privileges of employment; or\n\n               (2) limits, segregates, or classifies an employee or applicant for employment in a\n              manner that would deprive or tend to deprive an individual of any employment\n              opportunity or adversely affect in any other manner the status of an employee.\n\n\n\nTEX . LAB. CODE ANN . § 21.051. To establish a prima facie case of gender discrimination, Tiner had\nto prove that she 1) was a member of a class protected by the act, 2) she was qualified for her\nposition, 3) she was terminated, or suffered adverse action, and 4) she was treated less favorably than\nsimilarly situated members of another class. See Ysleta, 177 S.W.3d at 918.1\n        To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, Tiner had to show that she 1) engaged in a\nprotected activity, 2) an adverse employment action occurred, and 3) there was a causal connection\nbetween participation in the protected activity and the adverse employment decision. See Thomas\nv. Clayton Williams Energy, Inc., 2 S.W.3d 734, 739 (Tex. App.–Houston [14th Dist. 1999, no\npet.); see also McCullough v. Houston County Tex., 297 F. App’x 282, 288–89 (5th Cir. 2008).\n\n\n\n        1\n           TxDOT argues, based on Meinecke v. H & R Block of Houston, 66 F.3d 77, 83 (5th Cir. 1995), that\nTiner cannot show gender discrimination because she was replaced by members of the same protected class. Tiner\nresponds, citing Septim us v. University of Houston, 399 F.3d 601, 609 (5th Cir. 2005), that she must show either\nthat she was replaced by a person outside her protected class or that another similarly situated person was treated\nmore favorably. W e note that the Texas Supreme Court has stated that the precise elements of the initial showing\nrequired by McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802–05, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 1824–25, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668\n(1973), vary depending upon the allegations. There is recent case law supporting TxDOT’s position. See Ptom ey v.\nTex. Tech Univ., 277 S.W.3d 487, 492 (Tex. App.–Amarillo 2009, pet. denied). Because Tiner suffered no adverse\nemployment action, we need not decide whether she was required to prove that she was replaced by a person from\nanother class.\n\n                                                           4\n\fAnalysis\n       TxDOT’s motion for no evidence summary judgment was properly granted because Tiner\nfailed to provide summary judgment evidence showing that there was a genuine issue of material fact\nas to whether she suffered adverse employment action. On appeal, Tiner argues that she did suffer\nadverse employment action. Specifically, she argues that her supervisor ignored her complaint about\nthe coworker, she was required to attend a meeting with her supervisor and a regional supervisor,\nher supervisor ignored her, but on one occasion got into a loud argument with her, her supervisor\nended her access to his email account, and that TxDOT constructively discharged her.\n       Whether an employee has suffered adverse employment action is often not a contested part\nof a discrimination or retaliation case. For example, in Ysleta, a case Tiner cites on this issue, the\ndefendant fired the two plaintiffs. That did not happen here. Tiner also did not suffer any of the\nmore common forms of adverse employment action in terms of being denied raises or promotions\nor being given an unfavorable evaluation. Tiner acknowledges this and argues that she was\nconstructively discharged. See Passons v. Univ. of Tex. at Austin, 969 S.W.2d 560, 562 (Tex.\nApp.–Austin 1998, no pet.) (constructive discharge serves as legal substitute for discharge element\nof prima facie case of discrimination).\n       A constructive discharge occurs when an employee makes the reasonable decision to resign\nbecause of unendurable working conditions. See Baylor Univ. v. Coley, 221 S.W.3d 599, 604–05\n(Tex. 2007) (citing Pennsylvania State Police v. Suders, 542 U.S. 129, 141, 124 S. Ct. 2342, 2351,\n159 L. Ed. 2d 204 (2004)). Tiner’s constructive discharge claim is based on the same underlying\nfacts that Tiner argues support her claim of discrimination and retaliation. Specifically, Tiner argues\nthat her decision to resign was compelled by the working conditions that included her supervisor’s\nhandling of the coworker and his treatment of her.\n        In Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Bertrand, 37 S.W.3d. 1, 9 (Tex. App.–Tyler 2000, pet. ref’d),\nwe considered a case where a manager alleged that he had been constructively discharged. In that\ncase, the worker had received unfavorable work evaluations, was asked if he wished to transfer, had\ndisciplinary procedures initiated against him, was refused permission to attend to personal matters\non his lunch break, and had a manager make derogatory comments to him. We concluded that this\nwas not evidence that the worker had been constructively discharged due to his age. Id. at 12.\n       In Bertrand, we observed that an employer must be permitted to make reasonable personnel\n\n                                                  5\n\fdecisions and that critical statements must be allowed in the form of unfavorable work evaluations.\nId. at 9. As part of the burden shifting that applies, and in a summary judgment context, a plaintiff\nmay show that seemingly ordinary business decisions are, in fact, motivated by a discriminatory\nmotive. See M. D. Anderson Hosp. & Tumor Inst. v. Willrich, 28 S.W.3d 22, 24 (Tex. 2000).\nFurthermore, to constitute a constructive discharge, the employer’s actions must have been taken\nwith the intention of forcing the employee to resign. Bertrand, 37 S.W.3d. at 9 (citing Smith v.\nGoodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 895 F.2d 467, 472 (8th Cir. 1990)).\n       Whether an employee would feel forced to resign is case and fact specific, but the following\nemployment actions are relevant, singly or in combination: 1) demotion, 2) reduction in salary, 3)\nreduction in job responsibilities, 4) reassignment to menial or degrading work, 5) reassignment to\nwork under a younger or less experienced/qualified supervisor, 6) badgering, harassment, or\nhumiliation by the employer calculated to encourage the employee’s resignation, or 7) offers of early\nretirement (or continued employment on terms less favorable than the employee’s former status).\nSee Haley v. Alliance Compressor LLC, 391 F.3d 644, 649–50 (5th Cir. 2004) (citing Brown v.\nKinney Shoe Corp., 237 F.3d 556, 566 (5th Cir. 2001)).\n       In this case, Tiner did not show that the working conditions were unbearable, or that her\nemployer was attempting to encourage her to resign. Tiner argues that the issue with the coworker\nwas handled improperly.      This was an ordinary management problem.            TxDOT began an\ninvestigation about a week after Tiner’s written complaint, and the coworker was terminated about\na month after her complaint was made. This is not evidence that TxDOT sought to compel Tiner\nto resign. The coworker’s conduct was wrong—he was abusive, threatening, and unpleasant—but\nthere is no basis to conclude that TxDOT somehow created unendurable working conditions,\nespecially when it fired him within a month of Tiner’s complaint. And there is no reasonable basis\non which to conclude that the situation with the coworker caused Tiner to resign months later.\n       Nor do the other actions of TxDOT, when viewing the record in a light most favorable to\nTiner, show that TxDOT was attempting to encourage her to resign. The evidence that her\nsupervisor got into an argument with her, ended her access to his email, and stopped talking to her\ndoes not rise to the level of conduct designed to badger, harass, or humiliate Tiner. Nor is there a\nreason to conclude that the conduct was calculated to encourage her resignation. Indeed, Tiner was\ngiven an annual job evaluation by her supervisor less than a month before she left TxDOT. The\n\n                                                 6\n\fevaluation did not identify any areas in which she needed improvement, contained no negative\ncomments at all, and was generally complimentary of her work performance.\n       The meeting with the regional supervisor likewise does not tend to show that TxDOT was\nattempting to encourage Tiner to resign. It appears that management was attempting to assuage\nTiner’s concerns following the incident with the slammed door and, more generally, her concerns\nabout her supervisor. Tiner can point to no evidence that this single meeting was badgering,\nharassing, or humiliating or that it was calculated to encourage her to resign. Indeed, the meeting\ntook place months before she resigned.          Accordingly, Tiner has not shown that she was\nconstructively discharged.\n       For essentially the same reasons, we conclude that Tiner also failed to show adverse\nemployment action or that the actions complained of were motivated by retaliation or discrimination\non the basis of her gender. For purposes of discrimination, employer liability may result from a\nrefusal to hire an individual, a discharge of an individual, or discrimination in any other manner\nagainst an individual in connection with compensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of\nemployment. See TEX . LAB. CODE ANN . § 21.051(a)(1). For retaliation, the standard can be slightly\nlower. In construing a federal antiretaliation statute, the Supreme Court held that actionable\nretaliation includes actions that a “reasonable employee” would find to be “materially adverse,”\nmeaning that it “might well have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting” a\ncomplaint. See Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 68, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 2415,\n165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2006). In Burlington, for example, the Court held that reassignment from a\nforklift job to a track laborer job along with a thirty-seven day suspension without pay supported a\nfinding of retaliation. Id., 548 U.S. at 72–73, 126 S. Ct. at 2417–18. The Court recognized that it\nwas the nature of the employment action in context that was important when evaluating such claims,\nbut that relief was not available for trivial harms. Id., 548 U.S. at 68, 126 S. Ct. at 2415.\n       The actions Tiner complains of here do not rise to this level. Contrary to her assertion that\nher complaint about a coworker was ignored, the record shows that TxDOT initiated an investigation\nand terminated the coworker the next month. Affording the required deference to Tiner’s factual\nassertions, we cannot conclude that the meeting with the regional manager, which appears to have\noccurred in July 2003, was an adverse employment action. The meeting was apparently called to\naddress Tiner’s concerns about the way the coworker situation had been handled. It was designed\n\n                                                  7\n\fto dissuade her from making further complaints, but by listening to her concerns. There is no\nevidence that Tiner was threatened or otherwise treated in a materially adverse way during this\nmeeting. On the basis of the summary judgment record, we are not persuaded that this single\nmeeting is an adverse employment action, or that it shows that TxDOT acted with a retaliatory or\ndiscriminatory motive.2\n         Tiner also argues that she was treated differently from the male coworker who was fired.\nSpecifically, she asserts that he was able to meet informally with his supervisor after she made the\noral complaint about him, whereas her meeting was more formal. There is no evidence that any\ndisparity was influenced by gender discrimination or that her supervisors were doing anything other\nthan attempting to address her concerns. And, once again, Tiner was given a favorable performance\nevaluation, and her coworker was fired. In short, this case represents a disagreement in the\nworkplace as to how to manage a difficult employee. Tiner was not satisfied with the way her\nsupervisor handled the situation. This led to a disruption in the workplace that included unnecessary\nactions by the supervisor–slamming a door–and actions the supervisor thought were necessary to\nprotect himself–limiting conversation and ending Tiner’s access to his email.\n         These actions do not rise to the level of an adverse employment action. Tiner was not fired\nor demoted, and she was not reassigned or suspended. The minor actions that did occur do not\nrepresent meaningful changes in the conditions or privileges of her employment. And furthermore,\nwe do not conclude that these actions would dissuade a reasonable worker from making or\nsupporting a protected complaint. Finally, there is no evidence that her supervisor’s actions were\nmotivated by discrimination on the basis of the fact that Tiner is a female.\n         For the foregoing reasons, we hold that Tiner did not produce more than a scintilla of\nevidence to show that she suffered adverse employment action. Accordingly, the trial court did not\nerr in granting TxDOT’s motion for no evidence summary judgment and dismissing her lawsuit.\nTiner’s second issue is overruled. Therefore, we do not consider whether her claim was timely filed,\nas she argues in her first issue, nor do we consider her arguments relating to TxDOT’s motion for\ntraditional summary judgment.\n\n\n         2\n           This is not to say that such a meeting could not be so confrontational that it could constitute retaliation or\nbe evidence of employment discrimination. W e mean to say, simply, that on the basis of the summary judgment\nevidence, there is not evidence to show that this specific meeting was an adverse employment action.\n\n                                                            8\n\f                                                      DISPOSITION\n         We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                    SAM GRIFFITH\n                                                                       Justice\n\n\n\nOpinion delivered August 19, 2009.\nPanel consisted of Worthen, C.J., Griffith, J., and Hoyle, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       (PUBLISH)\n\n\n\n\n                                                                9\n\f",

In two issues, Tiner contends the trial court erred in\ngranting summary judgment and dismissing her retaliation and discrimination claims. We affirm.\n\n                                           BACKGROUND\n        Tiner worked for the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) from 1986 to 1998 and\nagain from 2000 until she resigned in November 2003. During her second period of employment\nat TxDOT, Tiner and other of her coworkers had a problem with a coworker who was rude, abusive,\nand generally obnoxious. Tiner complained about the coworker’s behavior to her supervisor in May\n2003 and followed up with a written complaint on May 14, 2003. The coworker was fired in June\n2003.\n        Tiner made a further complaint when her supervisor slammed a door following an argument\nwith her. This led to a meeting attended by Tiner, her supervisor, and their regional supervisor.\nTiner alleges that, during the time between her first complaint about the coworker and her\nresignation, her supervisor stopped talking to her and ended her access to his email account. Tiner\nresigned in November 2003. In her letter of resignation, Tiner stated that she had decided to evaluate\n\fher “current goals and investigate new opportunities.”\n       In 2004, Tiner filed a complaint with the Civil Rights Division of the Texas Workforce\nCommission. In 2005, Tiner filed a lawsuit in district court alleging that she was constructively\nterminated and that she suffered discrimination based on her gender and retaliation for engaging in\na protected activity. TxDOT filed both traditional and no evidence motions for summary judgment,\nand Tiner filed a response to each motion. After a hearing, the trial court granted TxDOT’s motion\nfor summary judgment and dismissed Tiner’s claims. Tiner filed a motion for a new trial. The trial\ncourt denied that motion, and this appeal followed.\n\n\n                                       SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n       Tiner argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment against her. In her first\nissue, she argues that her complaint was timely filed. In her second issue, Tiner argues that she\npresented prima facie evidence of employment discrimination and retaliation.\nStandard of Review\n       The movant for traditional summary judgment has the burden of showing that there is no\ngenuine issue of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Because Tiner suffered no adverse\nemployment action, we need not decide whether she was required to prove that she was replaced by a person from\nanother class.\n\n                                                           4\n\fAnalysis\n       TxDOT’s motion for no evidence summary judgment was properly granted because Tiner\nfailed to provide summary judgment evidence showing that there was a genuine issue of material fact\nas to whether she suffered adverse employment action. On appeal, Tiner argues that she did suffer\nadverse employment action. Specifically, she argues that her supervisor ignored her complaint about\nthe coworker, she was required to attend a meeting with her supervisor and a regional supervisor,\nher supervisor ignored her, but on one occasion got into a loud argument with her, her supervisor\nended her access to his email account, and that TxDOT constructively discharged her.\n       Whether an employee has suffered adverse employment action is often not a contested part\nof a discrimination or retaliation case. For example, in Ysleta, a case Tiner cites on this issue, the\ndefendant fired the two plaintiffs. That did not happen here. Tiner also did not suffer any of the\nmore common forms of adverse employment action in terms of being denied raises or promotions\nor being given an unfavorable evaluation. Tiner acknowledges this and argues that she was\nconstructively discharged. See Passons v. Univ. of Tex. at Austin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1562734\"><a href=\"/opinion/1562734/passons-v-university-of-texas-at-austin/\"><span class=\"volume\">969</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 562 (Tex.\nApp.–Austin 1998, no pet.)

Tiner’s constructive discharge claim is based on the same underlying\nfacts that Tiner argues support her claim of discrimination and retaliation. Specifically, Tiner argues\nthat her decision to resign was compelled by the working conditions that included her supervisor’s\nhandling of the coworker and his treatment of her.\n        In Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Bertrand, 37 S.W.3d. 1, 9 (Tex. App.–Tyler 2000, pet. ref’d),\nwe considered a case where a manager alleged that he had been constructively discharged. In that\ncase, the worker had received unfavorable work evaluations, was asked if he wished to transfer, had\ndisciplinary procedures initiated against him, was refused permission to attend to personal matters\non his lunch break, and had a manager make derogatory comments to him. We concluded that this\nwas not evidence that the worker had been constructively discharged due to his age. Id. at 12.\n       In Bertrand, we observed that an employer must be permitted to make reasonable personnel\n\n                                                  5\n\fdecisions and that critical statements must be allowed in the form of unfavorable work evaluations.\nId. at 9. As part of the burden shifting that applies, and in a summary judgment context, a plaintiff\nmay show that seemingly ordinary business decisions are, in fact, motivated by a discriminatory\nmotive. See M. D. Anderson Hosp. & Tumor Inst. v. Willrich, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1755090\"><a href=\"/opinion/1755090/md-anderson-hosp-tumor-inst-v-willrich/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 24 (Tex. 2000).\nFurthermore, to constitute a constructive discharge, the employer’s actions must have been taken\nwith the intention of forcing the employee to resign.

Tiner argues that the issue with the coworker\nwas handled improperly.      This was an ordinary management problem.            TxDOT began an\ninvestigation about a week after Tiner’s written complaint, and the coworker was terminated about\na month after her complaint was made. This is not evidence that TxDOT sought to compel Tiner\nto resign. The coworker’s conduct was wrong—he was abusive, threatening, and unpleasant—but\nthere is no basis to conclude that TxDOT somehow created unendurable working conditions,\nespecially when it fired him within a month of Tiner’s complaint. And there is no reasonable basis\non which to conclude that the situation with the coworker caused Tiner to resign months later.\n       Nor do the other actions of TxDOT, when viewing the record in a light most favorable to\nTiner, show that TxDOT was attempting to encourage her to resign. The evidence that her\nsupervisor got into an argument with her, ended her access to his email, and stopped talking to her\ndoes not rise to the level of conduct designed to badger, harass, or humiliate Tiner. Nor is there a\nreason to conclude that the conduct was calculated to encourage her resignation. Indeed, Tiner was\ngiven an annual job evaluation by her supervisor less than a month before she left TxDOT. The\n\n                                                 6\n\fevaluation did not identify any areas in which she needed improvement, contained no negative\ncomments at all, and was generally complimentary of her work performance.\n       The meeting with the regional supervisor likewise does not tend to show that TxDOT was\nattempting to encourage Tiner to resign. It appears that management was attempting to assuage\nTiner’s concerns following the incident with the slammed door and, more generally, her concerns\nabout her supervisor. Tiner can point to no evidence that this single meeting was badgering,\nharassing, or humiliating or that it was calculated to encourage her to resign. Indeed, the meeting\ntook place months before she resigned.          Accordingly, Tiner has not shown that she was\nconstructively discharged.\n       For essentially the same reasons, we conclude that Tiner also failed to show adverse\nemployment action or that the actions complained of were motivated by retaliation or discrimination\non the basis of her gender. For purposes of discrimination, employer liability may result from a\nrefusal to hire an individual, a discharge of an individual, or discrimination in any other manner\nagainst an individual in connection with compensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of\nemployment. See TEX . LAB. CODE ANN . § 21.051(a)(1). For retaliation, the standard can be slightly\nlower. In construing a federal antiretaliation statute, the Supreme Court held that actionable\nretaliation includes actions that a “reasonable employee” would find to be “materially adverse,”\nmeaning that it “might well have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting” a\ncomplaint.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">345</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2006). In Burlington, for example, the Court held that reassignment from a\nforklift job to a track laborer job along with a thirty-seven day suspension without pay supported a\nfinding of retaliation. Id., 548 U.S. at 72–73, 126 S. Ct. at 2417–18. The Court recognized that it\nwas the nature of the employment action in context that was important when evaluating such claims,\nbut that relief was not available for trivial harms. Id., 548 U.S. at 68, 126 S. Ct. at 2415.\n       The actions Tiner complains of here do not rise to this level. Contrary to her assertion that\nher complaint about a coworker was ignored, the record shows that TxDOT initiated an investigation\nand terminated the coworker the next month. Affording the required deference to Tiner’s factual\nassertions, we cannot conclude that the meeting with the regional manager, which appears to have\noccurred in July 2003, was an adverse employment action. The meeting was apparently called to\naddress Tiner’s concerns about the way the coworker situation had been handled. It was designed\n\n                                                  7\n\fto dissuade her from making further complaints, but by listening to her concerns. There is no\nevidence that Tiner was threatened or otherwise treated in a materially adverse way during this\nmeeting. On the basis of the summary judgment record, we are not persuaded that this single\nmeeting is an adverse employment action, or that it shows that TxDOT acted with a retaliatory or\ndiscriminatory motive.2\n         Tiner also argues that she was treated differently from the male coworker who was fired.\nSpecifically, she asserts that he was able to meet informally with his supervisor after she made the\noral complaint about him, whereas her meeting was more formal. There is no evidence that any\ndisparity was influenced by gender discrimination or that her supervisors were doing anything other\nthan attempting to address her concerns. And, once again, Tiner was given a favorable performance\nevaluation, and her coworker was fired. In short, this case represents a disagreement in the\nworkplace as to how to manage a difficult employee. Tiner was not satisfied with the way her\nsupervisor handled the situation. This led to a disruption in the workplace that included unnecessary\nactions by the supervisor–slamming a door–and actions the supervisor thought were necessary to\nprotect himself–limiting conversation and ending Tiner’s access to his email.\n         These actions do not rise to the level of an adverse employment action. Tiner was not fired\nor demoted, and she was not reassigned or suspended. The minor actions that did occur do not\nrepresent meaningful changes in the conditions or privileges of her employment. And furthermore,\nwe do not conclude that these actions would dissuade a reasonable worker from making or\nsupporting a protected complaint. Finally, there is no evidence that her supervisor’s actions were\nmotivated by discrimination on the basis of the fact that Tiner is a female.\n         For the foregoing reasons, we hold that Tiner did not produce more than a scintilla of\nevidence to show that she suffered adverse employment action. Accordingly, the trial court did not\nerr in granting TxDOT’s motion for no evidence summary judgment and dismissing her lawsuit.\nTiner’s second issue is overruled. Therefore, we do not consider whether her claim was timely filed,\nas she argues in her first issue, nor do we consider her arguments relating to TxDOT’s motion for\ntraditional summary judgment.\n\n\n         2\n           This is not to say that such a meeting could not be so confrontational that it could constitute retaliation or\nbe evidence of employment discrimination. W e mean to say, simply, that on the basis of the summary judgment\nevidence, there is not evidence to show that this specific meeting was an adverse employment action.\n\n                                                            8\n\f                                                      DISPOSITION\n         We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                    SAM GRIFFITH\n                                                                       Justice\n\n\n\nOpinion delivered August 19, 2009.\nPanel consisted of Worthen, C.J., Griffith, J., and Hoyle, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       (PUBLISH)\n\n\n\n\n                                                                9\n\f</pre>",
