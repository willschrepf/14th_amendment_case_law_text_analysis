Specifically, he challenges the trial\n\ncourt's finding that, at the time of trial, the Chisms owed Ms. Chism's parents, Garry and\n\nShirley Will, over $220,000 for loans extended to the Chisms in 2000 and 2004. He\n\nargues that the transfers were gifts, or-if loans-were demand obligations whose\n\ncollection was time barred by the time of the dissolution trial. He also assigns error to the\n\ncourt's consideration of what he characterizes as parol evidence from his ex-wife and her\n\nmother.\n\n       We find no error or abuse of discretion and affirm.\n\fNo. 32791-4-111\nIn re Marriage of Chism\n\n\n                    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n       Todd and Nicole Chism were divorced in August 2014 following an 18-year\n\nmarriage. Among the community liabilities found by the trial court and included in the\n\nproperty distribution were two personal loans made by Garry and Shirley Will, Ms.\n\nChism's parents. One was in the amount of $160,000 and the other was in the amount of\n\n$60,961. The court ordered both liabilities to be paid by Ms. Chism.\n\n       The evidence at trial bearing on the loans consisted of the testimony of Nicole\n\nChism, Shirley Will, and Todd Chism, and on two writings and a cashier's check.\n\n       Ms. Chism and Ms. Will testified that sometime before October 28, 2000, the\n\nWills purchased an 11-acre parcel of property in Nine Mile Falls that the Chisms had\n\nidentified as a desired home site. According to Ms. Chism, \"my father and mother were\n\ngracious enough to loan us the money\" by \"purchas[ing] the property for us in their\n\nnames because we did not have the financial means to do it.\" Verbatim Report of\n\nProceedings (VRP) at 21. The Wills purchased the 11-acre parcel for $250,000.\n\n       The Chisms thereafter realized they could not get a building permit unless the\n\nproperty was in their names, so the Wills quitclaimed four acres of the parcel-the\n\nwaterfront acreage, and thereby the most valuable-at an agreed value of $160,000. Ms.\n\nChism testified that this was \"with the anticipation that when we had enough money we\n\nwould pay them back.\" Id. at 21. Ms. Chism testified that there was never any\n\ndiscussion with her parents that the transfer of the four acres was a gift. Ms. Will\n\n                                             2\n\fNo. 32791-4-111\nIn re Marriage of Chism\n\n\ntestified that in transferring the property, she did not intend to make a gift to the Chisms\n\nand that Mr. Chism \"assured us the money would be paid back as soon as they were able\n\nto.\" VRP at 228-29.\n\n       A writing was prepared and signed by the four parties, with the Chisms signing as\n\n\"borrower[s]\" and the Wills signing as \"lender[s].\" Ex. R104. It stated:\n\n       THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN TODD M. CHISM AND NICOLE C.\n       CHISM (borrower) AND GARRY A. WILL, SR. AND SHIRLEY A.\n       WILL (lender), THOUGH UNNOTARIZED, SHALL BE HELD TO BE\n       LEGAL AND BINDING BY ALL CONCERNED PARTIES.\n\n       WE, TODD AND NICOLE CHISM, IN RETURN FOR LOVE AND\n       AFFECTION HA VE RECEIVED A QUIT CLAIM DEED TO 4 ACRES\n       (PARCEL NO. 5809608) FROM GARRY AND SHIRLEY WILL. THE\n       REAL PROPERTY VALUE AT TIME OF SIGNING OF THIS\n       AGREEMENT IS DETERMINED TO BE $160,000.00.\n\n       IF THIS PROPERTY IS SOLD, THE BORROWERS AGREE THAT THE\n       $160,000.00 LOAN/GIFT SHALL BE REP AID TO LENDER WITH NO\n       INTEREST OR PENAL TIES CHARGED OR ACCRUED TO/BY\n       EITHER PARTY.\n\nId.\n\n       Ms. Will testified that the reason for the \"loan/gift\" reference in the writing was\n\n\"[b]ecause I was concerned that if something happened to my husband or myself or both\n\nof us together, I didn't want the property tied up in our estate.\" VRP at 232-33. Apart\n\nfrom that contingency, she testified she \"expected to be repaid.\" Id. at 233.\n\n       There was a small, older home located on the Wills' remaining seven acres of the\n\nNine Mile Falls property that the Chisms managed and rented on the Wills' behalf. The\n\n                                              3\n\fNo. 32791-4-III\nIn re Marriage of Chism\n\n\nChisms forwarded the $600 a month received in rent until Mr. Chism was arrested on\n\nsome criminal charges (later dismissed) and, according to Ms. Will, \"they were having a\n\nlot of financial difficulties since he wasn't working\" at the time. VRP at 235.\n\n      Mr. Chism acknowledged the Wills purchased the Nine Mile Falls property and\n\ndeeded the four acres to himself and Ms. Chism, but testified that any issue of repayment\n\n\"was just kind of lea open.\" VRP at 72. He testified he fixed up the rental home on the\n\nproperty and \"rent[ ed] that out and gave that $600 a month from rental to the Wills.\"\n\nVRP at 72-73. He also testified he had \"put a lot of money, paid taxes and insurance and\n\neverything\" on the rental house. VRP at 76. In response to his lawyer's questioning, he\n\nagreed that the value of the rental house would \"more than satisfy\" any loan. Id.\n\n       The second loan found by the trial court that Mr. Chism challenges on appeal was\n\nmade in November 2004, on investment real estate that the Wills purchased on the South\n\nHill of Spokane. Mr. Chism had identified the property, explaining at trial that he\n\nbecame aware of a gentleman who wanted to sell part of his land, so he got involved in\n\nsurveying and segregating a parcel that he acquired in \"kind of a joint venture\" with Mr.\n\nWill. VRP at 108. According to Mr. Chism, Mr. Will \"was putting up the front money\n\nand I was going to be involved in the development.\" Id. Ms. Will testified, similarly,\n\nthat she and her husband purchased the property with the understanding that Mr. Chism\n\nwould develop it and the couples would split the profit. The purchase cost was\n\n$60,960.82.\n\n                                             4\n\fI    No. 32791-4-III\n\nI    In re Marriage of Chism\n\n\nI           The November 2004 arrangement was also reflected in a writing, which said\n\nII          Garry and Shirley Will agree to loan Todd and Nicole Chism the purchase\n            cost of parcel #35262.0128 in the amount of $60,960.82. The original loan\n            amount will be repaid at a mutually agreed upon time or when the property\n            is sold or transfers ownership. The loan will be without interest but any\n            increase in property value from the original purchase price/loan amount\n            will be split equally between the parties.\n\n     Ex. Rl 12.\n\n            The witnesses agreed that as a result of a downturn in the real estate market, the\n\n     property had never been developed. Ms. Will testified that she and her husband were still\n\n     waiting to be repaid.\n\n            In 2008, the Washington State Patrol arrested Mr. Chism on charges of child\n\n     pornography, which were later proven false. The Chisms reached a substantial legal\n\n     settlement with the State as a result of the false charges, from which they received $1. 5\n\n     million in or about 2012. Ms. Will acknowledged at the time of the Chisms' dissolution\n\n     trial that she and her husband had not made demand for repayment by the Chisms of the\n\n     two loans at issue following the legal settlement, explaining that \"I didn't feel that they\n\n     were in financial condition because of the debt they had accrued during the time that he\n\n     was being investigated.\" VRP at 243.\n\n            At the time of trial, neither loan had been repaid.\n\n            At the conclusion of a several day bench trial, the trial court found, among other\n\n     matters, that the transfers in 2000 and 2004 were loans that were going to be repaid. It\n\n\n                                                   5\n\fNo. 32791-4-III\nIn re Marriage of Chism\n\n\nassigned them as liabilities to Ms. Chism in distributing the couple's assets. Mr. Chism\n\nappeals.\n\n                                        ANALYSIS\n\n       Mr. Chism challenges the trial court's findings that the transfers were loans that\n\nremained due and owing at the time of the dissolution trial. He also argues that the trial\n\ncourt improperly considered parol evidence. 1 We first address the parol evidence issue\n\nand then turn to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the trial court's findings, and\n\nwhether the findings support the court's conclusions.\n\n           I. The trial court properly considered evidence of negotiations and\n             circumstances surrounding the Wills' monetary advances in 2000\n              and 2004 and implicitly found that the parties' writings were, at\n                                 most, partially integrated\n\n       Mr. Chism argues the trial court improperly considered parol evidence. Ms.\n\nChism argues we should not entertain that argument for the first time on appeal. Both\n\nparties' arguments proceed from a misunderstanding of the limitation on parol evidence.\n\n       \"The so-called 'parol evidence rule' is not a rule of evidence. It is [a] rule of\n\npositive and substantive law.\" Brother Int'!. Corp. v. Nat'! Vacuum & Sewing Machine\n\nStores, Inc., 9 Wn. App. 154, 157, 510 P.2d 1162 (1973). It \"only applies to a writing\n\n\n\n       1\n         Mr. Chism also argues that the outcome of this appeal will collaterally estop the\nWills from relitigating whether the advances were enforceable loans because Ms. Will\nwas in privity with Ms. Chism during the divorce proceedings. Br. of Appellant at 17-20.\nSince we affirm the trial court, we need not address the issue.\n\n                                              6\n\fNo. 32791-4-III\nIn re Marriage of Chism\n\n\nintended by the parties as an 'integration' of their agreement; i.e., a writing intended as a\n\nfinal expression of the terms of the agreement.\" Emrich v. Connell, 105 Wn.2d 551, 556,\n\n716 P.2d 863 (1986). A writing may not be integrated at all, in which case parol\n\nevidence is generally admissible. Id. at n.1. Or it may be partially integrated, in which\n\ncase terms not included in the writing may be proved by extrinsic evidence insofar as\n\nthey are not inconsistent with the written terms. Id. at 556.\n\n       \"People have the right to make their agreements partly oral and partly in writing,\n\nor entirely oral or entirely in writing; and it is the court's duty to ascertain from all\n\nrelevant, extrinsic evidence, either oral or written, whether the entire agreement has been\n\nincorporated in the writing or not.\" Barber v. Rochester, 52 Wn.2d 691, 698, 328 P.2d\n\n711 (1958). Accordingly, Ms. Chism's argument that the issue ofparol evidence may not\n\nbe raised for the first time on appeal is misplaced. Even if the integration issue was not\n\nargued in the trial court and even if the court's belief about the completeness of the\n\nparties' writings was not explicitly addressed in its findings, the court necessarily decided\n\nwhether the agreement was integrated, partially or at all, in order to apply substantive\n\ncontract law.\n\n       Whether an agreement is fully or partially integrated is a question of fact. Emrich,\n\n105 Wn.2d at 556. The absence of an integration clause supports a finding that a writing\n\nis only partially integrated. MA. Mortenson Co., Inc. v. Timberline Software Corp., 140\n\nWn.2d 568, 579-80, 998 P.2d 305 (2000). Since neither of the parties' 2000 or 2004\n\n                                               7\n\fNo. 32791-4-111\nIn re Marriage of Chism\n\n\nwritings contains an integration clause, Mr. Chism's bald assertion on appeal that \"the\n\nsubject written agreements or putative financial obligations were fully integrated ... on\n\ntheir face\" is utterly lacking in foundation. Br. of Appellant at 2. At a minimum, in order\n\nto determine whether an agreement is integrated, partially or at all, \"' the court may\n\nconsider evidence of negotiations and circumstances surrounding the formation of the\n\ncontract.'\" Mortenson, 140 Wn.2d at 579 (quoting Denny's Rests., lnp. v. Sec. Union\n\nTitle Co., 71 Wn. App. 194, 202, 859 P.2d 619 (1993)).\n\n       It is Mr. Chism who contends the writings are integrated and who therefore bore\n\nthe burden of establishing integration at trial. That being the case, the absence of a\n\nfinding of fact on integration is interpreted as a finding against him on that issue.\n\nEllerman v. Centerpoint Prepress, Inc., 143 Wn.2d 514, 524, 22 P.3d 795 (2001).\n\nMoreover, it is implicit in the trial court's findings that it found the parties' writings to be\n\npartially integrated, at most, because it finds agreement on matters that are not reflected\n\nwithin the writings' four comers.\n\n       An implicit finding that the writings were at most partially integrated is supported\n\nby substantial evidence. Neither writing contains an integration clause. Both writings\n\nare minimal and appear to have been prepared by laypersons. The parties were close\n\nfamily members and therefore more likely to be comfortable with a writing that was less\n\nthan complete. And, of course, both Ms. Chism and Ms. Will testified to understandings\n\nthat are not reflected in the writings.\n\n                                               8\n\fNo. 32791-4-III\nIn re Marriage of Chism\n\n\n       Given the court's implicit finding that the writings were not fully integrated, it did\n\nnot err in relying on the testimony of the parties to fill in the gaps as to the agreements\n\nmade in 2000 and 2004.\n\n                  II. Substantial evidence supports the trial court's findings\n\n       To detennine the intent of the parties to a written agreement, courts begin with the\n\nlanguage of the agreement, giving words their ordinary meaning. Hearst Commc 'ns,\n\nInc., v. Seattle Times Co., 154 Wn.2d 493, 503-04, 115 P.3d 262 (2005). When contract\n\ninterpretation does not depend on extrinsic evidence it is a question of law to be reviewed\n\nde novo. Wash. State Major League Baseball Stadium Pub. Facilities Dist. v. Huber,\n\nHunt & Nichols-Kiewit Constr. Co., 176 Wn.2d 502, 517, 296 P .3d 821 (2013 );\n\nCosmopolitan Eng'g Grp., Inc. v. Ondeo Degremont, Inc., 159 Wn.2d 292, 298, 149 P.3d\n\n666 (2006). But when a court relies on inferences drawn from extrinsic evidence,\n\ninterpretation of a contract is a question of fact. Berg v. Hudesman, 115 Wn.2d 657, 667-\n\n68, 801 P.2d 222 (1990). In that case, the trial court's finding is reviewed for substantial\n\nevidence. Dolan v. King County, 172 Wn.2d 299, 310, 258 P.3d 20 (2011).\n\n       Where the trial court finds the existence of an oral agreement or an agreement that\n\nis partly oral, as in this case, we review whether substantial evidence supports the trial\n\ncourt's findings of the existence of the oral agreement and its terms. Ban-Co Inv. Co., v.\n\nLoveless, 22 Wn. App. 122, 131-32, 587 P.2d 567 (1978). Substantial evidence means \"a\n\nsufficient quantum of evidence in the record to persuade a reasonable person that the\n\n                                              9\n\fNo. 32791-4-111\nIn re Marriage of Chism\n\n\ndeclared premise is true.\" Wenatchee Sportsmen Ass 'n v. Chelan County, 141 Wn.2d\n\n169, 176, 4 P.3d 123 (2000).\n\n      The following findings by the trial court are relevant to the issues on appeal:\n\n      6.     The Wills, parents of Ms. Chism, had loaned the community money\n             during the course of the marriage on several occasions for business\n             arrangements.\n      7.     These loans from the Wills were documented and the money was\n             paid back to them.\n      8.     The Wills loaned $160,000.00 to the community in 2000 and there is\n             a writing to evidence that loan.\n      9.     This $160,000.00 loan was used to purchase the Walnut Springs\n             parcel that the family home was built on.\n      10.    The Wills also loaned the community $60,961.00 for the purchase of\n             the South Hill lot.\n       11.   The Court found the testimony of Ms. Will to be very credible and\n             pretty candid.\n       12.   The Wills are getting ready for retirement, have about $500,000.00\n             in their savings account to live on and are expecting to have this loan\n             money repaid.\n      13.    The Wills understandably did not demand earlier repayment on these\n             two remaining loans as the parties and the grandchildren were going\n             through significant financial hard times and emotional turmoil.\n      14.    Both the South Hill lot loan and Walnut Springs loan are valid.\n\nClerk's Papers (CP) at 72. Mr. Chism assigns error to only findings 8 through 14. The\n\ncourt's findings that the Wills had loaned the Chisms money on several other occasions\n\nthat were documented and in which the loans were always repaid are not challenged.\n\nUnchallenged factual findings are verities on appeal. In re Marriage ofRaskob, 183 Wn.\n\nApp. 503, 510, 334 P.3d 30 (2014).\n\n                                            10\n\fNo. 32791-4-III\nIn re Marriage of Chism\n\n\n          Apart from Mr. Chism's mistaken argument that parol evidence was not\n\nadmissible, we discern from his briefing only two arguments as to why findings 8\n\nthrough 14 are unsupported. The first is that \"[b]ased upon the manner and wording of\n\nthe written documents ... these two (2) separate transfers of funds could easily on their\n\nface be considered outright 'gifts' rather than loans.\" Br. of Appellant at 13.\n\n          Mr. Chism ignores the indicia \"on their face\" that the written documents could be\n\nconsidered loans. The 2000 document identifies the parties as \"borrower[ s]\" and\n\n\"lender[ s]\" and states that if the real property is sold, \"the borrowers agree that the\n\n$160,000.00 loan/gift shall be repaid to lender.\" Ex. R104. The 2004 document states\n\nthat the Wills \"agree to loan\" the Chisms $60,960.82, that \"the ... loan amount will be\n\nrepaid,\" and that \"the loan will be without interest.\" Ex. Rl 12. The trial court was\n\nentitled to consider other evidence, including Ms. Chism's and Ms. Will's testimony\n\nconcerning understandings discussed but not reflected in the writings, the Wills' financial\n\nsituation, and the parties' history that monies loaned to the Chisms by the Wills were\n\nrepaid.\n\n          As always, \"[ c]redibility determinations are for the trier of fact and cannot be\n\nreviewed on appeal.\" State v. Camarillo, 115 Wn.2d 60, 71, 794 P.2d 850 (1990). The\n\ntrial court's findings that the monies advanced were valid loans is supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\fNo. 32791-4-111\nIn re Marriage of Chism\n\n\n       Mr. Chism's only other discernible argument is that \"there was no deadline for any.\n\narguable repayment,\" making the loans \"demand notes under long-established\n\nWashington case law\" to which he argues a six-year statute of limitation applies. Br. of\n\nAppellant at 13. Generally, actions for breach of written contracts have a six-year\n\nlimitations period, RCW 4.16.040. A limitations period begins to run when the claim has\n\n\"accrued.\" RCW 4.16.005. A claim is said to accrue when a party has the right to\n\nenforce the cause of action and seek relief in the courts. Gunnier v. Yakima Heart Ctr.,\n\nInc., 134 Wn.2d 854, 859, 953 P.2d 1162 (1998). These principles apply to an action on\n\na demand loan, which is a loan agreement that does not provide for a specific time or\n\nperiod for repayment. Nilson v. Castle Rock Sch. Dist., 88 Wn. App. 627, 630, 945 P.2d\n\n765 (1997). But cf RCW 62A.3-118(b) (ten-year limitations period applies if the note is\n\na negotiable instrument and no demand has been made).\n\n       The parties' writings provided for repayment not on demand, but on\n\ncontingencies. The October 2000 agreement indicated that the $160,000 would be repaid\n\n\"if [the] property is sold.\" Ex. Rl04. If that were the parties' only agreement, an effort\n\nby the Wills to collect at an earlier time would fail, since the repayment obligation had\n\nnot yet accrued-unless the court found that the parties had not intended the debt to be\n\ncontingent, but only relied on the future sale as a convenient time for repayment. In that\n\nevent, if the future sale did not happen as contemplated, the law would require repayment\n\nto be made within a reasonable time. Noord v. Downs, 51 Wn.2d 611, 614, 320 P.2d 632\n\n                                             12\n\fNo. 32791-4-111\nIn re Marriage of Chism\n\n\n(1958); and see Annotation, Agreement Postponing Payment of Pre-Existing Debt until\n\nHappening ofSome Specific Contingency Wholly or Partially within Debtor-Promisor's.\n\nControl as Requiring Payment within a Reasonable Time, Even Though the Contingent\n\nEvent Has Not Occurred, 148 A.L.R. 1075 (1944). Of course, according to Ms. Chism's\n\nand Ms. Will's testimony, the parties had agreed that \"the money would be paid back as\n\nsoon as [the Chisms] were able to,\" and as of the time of trial, that had not yet\n\nhappened-or at least, hadn't happened more than six years earlier. VRP at 228-29. The\n\ntrial court implicitly found that the contingency for repayment was the Chisms' financial\n\nability to repay in light of its finding that the Wills did not demand earlier repayment as\n\n\"the parties and the grandchildren were going through significant financial hard times and\n\nemotional turmoil.\" CP at 72, Finding 13.\n\n       The parties' November 2004 agreement, which Mr. Chism himself characterized\n\nas a \"joint venture\" arrangement, did not call for repayment until \"a mutually agreed\n\nupon time or when the property is sold or transfers ownership.\" Ex. Rl 12. There was no\n\nevidence that any of those contingencies had occurred prior to the time of trial.\n\n       The trial court's conclusion that the loans from the Wills were valid and remained\n\nenforceable is supported by its findings. 2\n\n\n       2\n         We also point out that the trial court could have reached the same conclusion\nbased on other findings supported by the evidence. First, where a note does not provide a\ntime for repayment, an exception to construing it as a demand note exists \"when, at the\ntime of contracting, the parties contemplated delay in making the demand and where\n\n                                              13\n\fNo. 32791-4-III\nIn re Marriage of Chism\n\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n       A majority of the panel has determined this opinion will not be printed in the\n\nWashington Appellate Reports, but it will be filed for public record pursuant to RCW\n\n2.06.040.\n\n\n\n                                                   dl~,c?a:--\n                                                      c.1:\n                                                  Siddoway,\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n   rsmo,J/\n\n\n\n\n'speedy demand would violate the spirit of the contract.'\" Nilson, 88 Wn.

Specifically, he challenges the trial\n\ncourt's finding that, at the time of trial, the Chisms owed Ms. Chism's parents, Garry and\n\nShirley Will, over $220,000 for loans extended to the Chisms in 2000 and 2004. He\n\nargues that the transfers were gifts, or-if loans-were demand obligations whose\n\ncollection was time barred by the time of the dissolution trial. He also assigns error to the\n\ncourt's consideration of what he characterizes as parol evidence from his ex-wife and her\n\nmother.\n\n       We find no error or abuse of discretion and affirm.\n\fNo. 32791-4-111\nIn re Marriage of Chism\n\n\n                    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n       Todd and Nicole Chism were divorced in August 2014 following an 18-year\n\nmarriage. Among the community liabilities found by the trial court and included in the\n\nproperty distribution were two personal loans made by Garry and Shirley Will, Ms.\n\nChism's parents. One was in the amount of $160,000 and the other was in the amount of\n\n$60,961. The court ordered both liabilities to be paid by Ms. Chism.\n\n       The evidence at trial bearing on the loans consisted of the testimony of Nicole\n\nChism, Shirley Will, and Todd Chism, and on two writings and a cashier's check.\n\n       Ms. Chism and Ms. Will testified that sometime before October 28, 2000, the\n\nWills purchased an 11-acre parcel of property in Nine Mile Falls that the Chisms had\n\nidentified as a desired home site. According to Ms. Chism, \"my father and mother were\n\ngracious enough to loan us the money\" by \"purchas[ing] the property for us in their\n\nnames because we did not have the financial means to do it.\" Verbatim Report of\n\nProceedings (VRP) at 21. The Wills purchased the 11-acre parcel for $250,000.\n\n       The Chisms thereafter realized they could not get a building permit unless the\n\nproperty was in their names, so the Wills quitclaimed four acres of the parcel-the\n\nwaterfront acreage, and thereby the most valuable-at an agreed value of $160,000. Ms.\n\nChism testified that this was \"with the anticipation that when we had enough money we\n\nwould pay them back.\" Id. at 21. Ms. Chism testified that there was never any\n\ndiscussion with her parents that the transfer of the four acres was a gift. Ms. Will\n\n                                             2\n\fNo. 32791-4-111\nIn re Marriage of Chism\n\n\ntestified that in transferring the property, she did not intend to make a gift to the Chisms\n\nand that Mr. Chism \"assured us the money would be paid back as soon as they were able\n\nto.\" VRP at 228-29.\n\n       A writing was prepared and signed by the four parties, with the Chisms signing as\n\n\"borrower[s]\" and the Wills signing as \"lender[s].\" Ex. R104. It stated:\n\n       THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN TODD M. CHISM AND NICOLE C.\n       CHISM (borrower) AND GARRY A. WILL, SR. AND SHIRLEY A.\n       WILL (lender), THOUGH UNNOTARIZED, SHALL BE HELD TO BE\n       LEGAL AND BINDING BY ALL CONCERNED PARTIES.\n\n       WE, TODD AND NICOLE CHISM, IN RETURN FOR LOVE AND\n       AFFECTION HA VE RECEIVED A QUIT CLAIM DEED TO 4 ACRES\n       (PARCEL NO. 5809608) FROM GARRY AND SHIRLEY WILL. THE\n       REAL PROPERTY VALUE AT TIME OF SIGNING OF THIS\n       AGREEMENT IS DETERMINED TO BE $160,000.00.\n\n       IF THIS PROPERTY IS SOLD, THE BORROWERS AGREE THAT THE\n       $160,000.00 LOAN/GIFT SHALL BE REP AID TO LENDER WITH NO\n       INTEREST OR PENAL TIES CHARGED OR ACCRUED TO/BY\n       EITHER PARTY.\n\nId.\n\n       Ms. Will testified that the reason for the \"loan/gift\" reference in the writing was\n\n\"[b]ecause I was concerned that if something happened to my husband or myself or both\n\nof us together, I didn't want the property tied up in our estate.\" VRP at 232-33. Apart\n\nfrom that contingency, she testified she \"expected to be repaid.\" Id. at 233.\n\n       There was a small, older home located on the Wills' remaining seven acres of the\n\nNine Mile Falls property that the Chisms managed and rented on the Wills' behalf. The\n\n                                              3\n\fNo. 32791-4-III\nIn re Marriage of Chism\n\n\nChisms forwarded the $600 a month received in rent until Mr. Chism was arrested on\n\nsome criminal charges (later dismissed) and, according to Ms. Will, \"they were having a\n\nlot of financial difficulties since he wasn't working\" at the time. VRP at 235.\n\n      Mr. Chism acknowledged the Wills purchased the Nine Mile Falls property and\n\ndeeded the four acres to himself and Ms. Chism, but testified that any issue of repayment\n\n\"was just kind of lea open.\" VRP at 72. He testified he fixed up the rental home on the\n\nproperty and \"rent[ ed] that out and gave that $600 a month from rental to the Wills.\"\n\nVRP at 72-73. He also testified he had \"put a lot of money, paid taxes and insurance and\n\neverything\" on the rental house. VRP at 76. In response to his lawyer's questioning, he\n\nagreed that the value of the rental house would \"more than satisfy\" any loan. Id.\n\n       The second loan found by the trial court that Mr. Chism challenges on appeal was\n\nmade in November 2004, on investment real estate that the Wills purchased on the South\n\nHill of Spokane. Mr. Chism had identified the property, explaining at trial that he\n\nbecame aware of a gentleman who wanted to sell part of his land, so he got involved in\n\nsurveying and segregating a parcel that he acquired in \"kind of a joint venture\" with Mr.\n\nWill. VRP at 108. According to Mr. Chism, Mr. Will \"was putting up the front money\n\nand I was going to be involved in the development.\" Id. Ms. Will testified, similarly,\n\nthat she and her husband purchased the property with the understanding that Mr. Chism\n\nwould develop it and the couples would split the profit. The purchase cost was\n\n$60,960.82.\n\n                                             4\n\fI    No. 32791-4-III\n\nI    In re Marriage of Chism\n\n\nI           The November 2004 arrangement was also reflected in a writing, which said\n\nII          Garry and Shirley Will agree to loan Todd and Nicole Chism the purchase\n            cost of parcel #35262.0128 in the amount of $60,960.82. The original loan\n            amount will be repaid at a mutually agreed upon time or when the property\n            is sold or transfers ownership. The loan will be without interest but any\n            increase in property value from the original purchase price/loan amount\n            will be split equally between the parties.\n\n     Ex. Rl 12.\n\n            The witnesses agreed that as a result of a downturn in the real estate market, the\n\n     property had never been developed. Ms. Will testified that she and her husband were still\n\n     waiting to be repaid.\n\n            In 2008, the Washington State Patrol arrested Mr. Chism on charges of child\n\n     pornography, which were later proven false. The Chisms reached a substantial legal\n\n     settlement with the State as a result of the false charges, from which they received $1. 5\n\n     million in or about 2012. Ms. Will acknowledged at the time of the Chisms' dissolution\n\n     trial that she and her husband had not made demand for repayment by the Chisms of the\n\n     two loans at issue following the legal settlement, explaining that \"I didn't feel that they\n\n     were in financial condition because of the debt they had accrued during the time that he\n\n     was being investigated.\" VRP at 243.\n\n            At the time of trial, neither loan had been repaid.\n\n            At the conclusion of a several day bench trial, the trial court found, among other\n\n     matters, that the transfers in 2000 and 2004 were loans that were going to be repaid. It\n\n\n                                                   5\n\fNo. 32791-4-III\nIn re Marriage of Chism\n\n\nassigned them as liabilities to Ms. Chism in distributing the couple's assets. Mr. Chism\n\nappeals.\n\n                                        ANALYSIS\n\n       Mr. Chism challenges the trial court's findings that the transfers were loans that\n\nremained due and owing at the time of the dissolution trial. He also argues that the trial\n\ncourt improperly considered parol evidence. 1 We first address the parol evidence issue\n\nand then turn to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the trial court's findings, and\n\nwhether the findings support the court's conclusions.\n\n           I. The trial court properly considered evidence of negotiations and\n             circumstances surrounding the Wills' monetary advances in 2000\n              and 2004 and implicitly found that the parties' writings were, at\n                                 most, partially integrated\n\n       Mr. Chism argues the trial court improperly considered parol evidence. Ms.\n\nChism argues we should not entertain that argument for the first time on appeal. Both\n\nparties' arguments proceed from a misunderstanding of the limitation on parol evidence.\n\n       \"The so-called 'parol evidence rule' is not a rule of evidence. It is [a] rule of\n\npositive and substantive law.\" Brother Int'!. Corp. v. Nat'!

The Wills, parents of Ms. Chism, had loaned the community money\n             during the course of the marriage on several occasions for business\n             arrangements.\n      7.     These loans from the Wills were documented and the money was\n             paid back to them.\n      8.     The Wills loaned $160,000.00 to the community in 2000 and there is\n             a writing to evidence that loan.\n      9.     This $160,000.00 loan was used to purchase the Walnut Springs\n             parcel that the family home was built on.\n      10.    The Wills also loaned the community $60,961.00 for the purchase of\n             the South Hill lot.\n       11.   The Court found the testimony of Ms. Will to be very credible and\n             pretty candid.\n       12.   The Wills are getting ready for retirement, have about $500,000.00\n             in their savings account to live on and are expecting to have this loan\n             money repaid.\n      13.    The Wills understandably did not demand earlier repayment on these\n             two remaining loans as the parties and the grandchildren were going\n             through significant financial hard times and emotional turmoil.\n      14.    Both the South Hill lot loan and Walnut Springs loan are valid.\n\nClerk's Papers (CP) at 72. Mr. Chism assigns error to only findings 8 through 14. The\n\ncourt's findings that the Wills had loaned the Chisms money on several other occasions\n\nthat were documented and in which the loans were always repaid are not challenged.\n\nUnchallenged factual findings are verities on appeal.

The first is that \"[b]ased upon the manner and wording of\n\nthe written documents ... these two (2) separate transfers of funds could easily on their\n\nface be considered outright 'gifts' rather than loans.\" Br. of Appellant at 13.\n\n          Mr. Chism ignores the indicia \"on their face\" that the written documents could be\n\nconsidered loans. The 2000 document identifies the parties as \"borrower[ s]\" and\n\n\"lender[ s]\" and states that if the real property is sold, \"the borrowers agree that the\n\n$160,000.00 loan/gift shall be repaid to lender.\" Ex. R104. The 2004 document states\n\nthat the Wills \"agree to loan\" the Chisms $60,960.82, that \"the ... loan amount will be\n\nrepaid,\" and that \"the loan will be without interest.\" Ex. Rl 12. The trial court was\n\nentitled to consider other evidence, including Ms. Chism's and Ms. Will's testimony\n\nconcerning understandings discussed but not reflected in the writings, the Wills' financial\n\nsituation, and the parties' history that monies loaned to the Chisms by the Wills were\n\nrepaid.\n\n          As always, \"[ c]redibility determinations are for the trier of fact and cannot be\n\nreviewed on appeal.\" State v.

Br. of\n\nAppellant at 13. Generally, actions for breach of written contracts have a six-year\n\nlimitations period, RCW 4.16.040. A limitations period begins to run when the claim has\n\n\"accrued.\" RCW 4.16.005.

But cf RCW 62A.3-118(b) (ten-year limitations period applies if the note is\n\na negotiable instrument and no demand has been made).\n\n       The parties' writings provided for repayment not on demand, but on\n\ncontingencies. The October 2000 agreement indicated that the $160,000 would be repaid\n\n\"if [the] property is sold.\" Ex. Rl04. If that were the parties' only agreement, an effort\n\nby the Wills to collect at an earlier time would fail, since the repayment obligation had\n\nnot yet accrued-unless the court found that the parties had not intended the debt to be\n\ncontingent, but only relied on the future sale as a convenient time for repayment. In that\n\nevent, if the future sale did not happen as contemplated, the law would require repayment\n\nto be made within a reasonable time. Noord v.

Of course, according to Ms. Chism's\n\nand Ms. Will's testimony, the parties had agreed that \"the money would be paid back as\n\nsoon as [the Chisms] were able to,\" and as of the time of trial, that had not yet\n\nhappened-or at least, hadn't happened more than six years earlier. VRP at 228-29. The\n\ntrial court implicitly found that the contingency for repayment was the Chisms' financial\n\nability to repay in light of its finding that the Wills did not demand earlier repayment as\n\n\"the parties and the grandchildren were going through significant financial hard times and\n\nemotional turmoil.\" CP at 72, Finding 13.\n\n       The parties' November 2004 agreement, which Mr. Chism himself characterized\n\nas a \"joint venture\" arrangement, did not call for repayment until \"a mutually agreed\n\nupon time or when the property is sold or transfers ownership.\" Ex. Rl 12. There was no\n\nevidence that any of those contingencies had occurred prior to the time of trial.\n\n       The trial court's conclusion that the loans from the Wills were valid and remained\n\nenforceable is supported by its findings. 2\n\n\n       2\n         We also point out that the trial court could have reached the same conclusion\nbased on other findings supported by the evidence.
