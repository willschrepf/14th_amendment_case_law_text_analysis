(No. 94-CV-140-\n4MAC(WDO), Wilbur D. Owens, Jr., Judge.\n\nBefore HATCHETT, Chief Judge, TJOFLAT, EDMONDSON, COX, BIRCH, DUBINA, BLACK,\nCARNES and BARKETT, Circuit Judges*, and KRAVITCH** and HENDERSON, Senior Circuit\nJudges.\n\n        TJOFLAT, Circuit Judge:\n\n        Appellant, Aurelia Davis, brought this suit against the Board of Education of Monroe\n\nCounty, Georgia, (the \"Board\") and two school officials, Charles Dumas and Bill Querry, on behalf\n\nof her daughter, LaShonda Davis. The complaint alleged that the defendants violated Section 901\n\nof the Education Amendments of 1972, Pub.L. No. 92-318, 86 Stat. 235, 373 (1972) (codified as\n\namended at 20 U.S.C. § 1681 (1994)) (\"Title IX\"), and 42 U.S.C. § 19831 by failing to prevent a\n\nstudent at Hubbard Elementary School (\"Hubbard\") from sexually harassing LaShonda while she\n\nwas a student there. Appellant separately alleged that the defendants discriminated against\n\n\n\n\n   *\n    Judge R. Lanier Anderson recused himself and did not participate in this decision.\n   **\n    Senior Judge Phyllis A. Kravitch, who was a member of the en banc court which heard oral\nargument in this case, took senior status on January 1, 1997, and has elected to participate in this\ndecision pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 46(c).\n   1\n    This section provides, \"Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation,\ncustom, or usage, of any State ... subjects, or causes to be subjected, any ... person ... to the\ndeprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall\nbe liable to the party injured....\" 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (1994).\n\fLaShonda on the basis of race in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981.2 Appellant sought injunctive relief\nand $500,000 in compensatory and punitive damages.\n\n       The district court dismissed appellant's complaint in its entirety for failure to state a claim\n\nupon which relief can be granted. See Aurelia D. v. Monroe County Bd. of Educ., 862 F.Supp. 363,\n\n368 (M.D.Ga.1994); see also Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Appellant appealed the district court's\n\ndismissal of her Title IX claim against the Board,3 arguing that a school board can be held liable\n\nunder Title IX for its failure to prevent sexual harassment among students. On appeal, a divided\n\nthree-judge panel reinstated her Title IX claim against the Board. See Davis v. Monroe County Bd.\n\n\n\n   2\n    Davis actually alleged that the named defendants discriminated on the basis of race in\nviolation of \"the Education Act of 1972 and the Civil Rights Act of 1991.\" Davis was apparently\nreferring to the Education Amendments of 1972, Pub.L. No. 92-318, 86 Stat. 235 (1972), and the\nCivil Rights Act of 1991, Pub.L. No. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1071 (1991). The former act, however,\ndoes not address racial discrimination in education, and the latter act does not provide a cause of\naction for racial discrimination in education. The district court construed this portion of the\ncomplaint to allege a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981, which does provide a cause of action against\ncertain types of racial discrimination.\n   3\n    Davis did not appeal the district court's dismissal of her Title IX claim with regard to\nindividual defendants Dumas and Querry. Davis similarly did not appeal the district court's\ndismissal of her § 1981 claim. Therefore, we do not consider these claims.\n\n              With regard to Davis' § 1983 claim, the complaint seemed to allege that the\n       defendants were liable under this provision solely because they violated Title IX. Davis,\n       however, apparently argued before the district court that the defendants were liable under\n       § 1983 for infringing LaShonda's rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\n       Amendment to the United States Constitution. The district court dismissed this implied\n       claim under Rule 12(b)(6). See Aurelia D., 862 F.Supp. at 366.\n\n               Davis did not appeal the dismissal of her § 1983 claim to the extent it was based\n       on the defendants' alleged violation of Title IX. Accordingly, that claim is not before us.\n       She did, however, appeal the dismissal of her § 1983 claim to the extent it was based on\n       the defendants' alleged violation of the Due Process Clause. In addition, Davis argued\n       for the first time before the three-judge panel that the same § 1983 claim encompassed a\n       violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n               The panel rejected Davis' due-process and equal-protection arguments and\n       affirmed the dismissal of her steadily expanding § 1983 claim under 11th Cir. R. 36-1.\n       See Davis v. Monroe County Bd. of Educ., 74 F.3d 1186, 1188 (1996). Davis did not\n       petition the court to rehear this ruling en banc, and we see no reason to disturb the panel's\n       decision sua sponte. We therefore do not consider Davis' various § 1983 claims. In sum,\n       we address only Davis' Title IX claim against the Board.\n\n                                                 2\n\fof Educ., 74 F.3d 1186, 1195 (11th Cir.1996). At the Board's request, we granted rehearing en banc\n\nto consider appellant's Title IX claim,4 and we now affirm the district court's dismissal of this claim.\n\n                                                   I.\n\n                                                  A.\n\n        We review de novo the district court's dismissal of appellant's complaint for failure to state\n\na claim upon which relief can be granted. See McKusick v. City of Melbourne, 96 F.3d 478, 482\n\n(11th Cir.1996). To this end, we take as true the allegations appellant has set forth in her complaint\n\nand examine whether those allegations describe an injury for which the law provides relief. See\n\nWelch v. Laney, 57 F.3d 1004, 1008 (11th Cir.1995). We construe appellant's allegations liberally\n\nbecause the issue is not whether appellant will ultimately prevail but whether she is entitled to offer\n\nevidence to support her claims. Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 1686, 40\n\nL.Ed.2d 90 (1974). We begin by describing the allegations contained in appellant's complaint.\n\n                                                  B.\n\n       LaShonda Davis was enrolled as a fifth-grade student at Hubbard during the 1992-1993\n\nschool year. During that school year, Bill Querry was the principal of Hubbard, and Diane Fort,\n\nJoyce Pippin, and Whit Maples were teachers at the school. The complaint alleges that the Board\n\nadministered federally funded educational programs at Hubbard and supervised the school's\n\nemployees, including Principal Querry and Teachers Fort, Pippin, and Maples.\n\n       According to the complaint, a fifth-grade student named \"G.F.\" was in several of LaShonda's\n\nclasses and initially was assigned to the seat next to LaShonda in Fort's classroom. On December\n\n17, 1992, while in Fort's classroom, G.F. allegedly tried to touch LaShonda's breasts and vaginal\n\narea. G.F. also allegedly directed vulgarities at LaShonda, such as \"I want to get in bed with you\"\n\nand \"I want to feel your boobs.\" LaShonda complained to Fort. After school that day, LaShonda\n\nalso told her mother, the appellant, about G.F.'s behavior. The complaint states that G.F. engaged\n\n\n   4\n    See Davis v. Monroe County Bd. of Educ., 91 F.3d 1418 (11th Cir.1996). Granting rehearing\nen banc vacated the panel opinion by operation of law. 11th Cir. R. 35-11.\n\n                                                   3\n\fin similar (although unspecified) conduct on or about January 4, 1993,5 and again on January 20,\n\n1993. LaShonda allegedly reported both incidents to Fort and to appellant. After one of these first\n\nthree incidents, appellant called Fort, who told appellant in the course of their conversation that\n\nPrincipal Querry knew about one of the incidents.\n\n       G.F.'s misconduct continued. On February 3, 1993, G.F. allegedly placed a door-stop in his\n\npants and behaved in a sexually suggestive manner toward LaShonda during their physical education\n\nclass. LaShonda reported this incident to Maples, who was the physical education teacher. On\n\nFebruary 10, 1993, G.F. engaged in unspecified conduct similar to that of the December 17 incident\n\nin the classroom of Pippin, another of LaShonda's teachers. LaShonda notified Pippin of G.F.'s\n\nbehavior and later told appellant, who then called Pippin to discuss the incident. On March 1, 1993,\n\nG.F. directed more unspecified, offensive conduct toward LaShonda during physical education class.\n\nLaShonda reported G.F. to Maples and Pippin. An unidentified teacher allegedly told LaShonda that\n\nPrincipal Querry was not ready to listen to her complaint about G.F.\n\n       At some point around March 17, 1993, Fort allowed LaShonda to change assigned seats\n\naway from G.F. G.F., however, persisted in his unwelcome attentions. On April 12, 1993, he rubbed\n\nhis body against LaShonda in a manner she considered sexually suggestive; this incident occurred\n\nin the hallway on the way to lunch. LaShonda again complained to Fort.\n\n       Lastly, on May 19, 1993, LaShonda complained to appellant after school about more\n\nunspecified behavior by G.F. Appellant and LaShonda then paid a visit to Principal Querry to\n\ndiscuss G.F.'s conduct. At this meeting, Querry asked LaShonda why no other students had\n\ncomplained about G.F. During this meeting, Querry also told appellant, \"I guess I'll have to threaten\n\n[G.F.] a little bit harder.\" On the same day, May 19, G.F. was charged with sexual battery, a charge\n\nwhich he apparently did not deny. The complaint does not tell us who summoned the police.\n\n   5\n    The complaint actually alleges that this second instance of harassment occurred \"on or about\nJanuary 2, 1993.\" We note that January 2, 1993 was a Saturday. Presumably, there was no\nschool on Saturday, so G.F. could not have sexually harassed LaShonda at Hubbard on that day.\nFriday, January 1, 1993, was a holiday. Accordingly, we assume for appellant's benefit that the\nalleged harassment occurred on or about January 4, 1993.\n\n                                                 4\n\f       In all, the complaint describes eight separate instances of sexual harassment by G.F. These\n\neight instances of alleged harassment occurred, on average, once every twenty-two days over a\n\nsix-month period. Three instances occurred in Fort's classroom; two occurred in Maples' physical\n\neducation class; one occurred in Pippin's classroom; one occurred in a school hallway; and one\n\noccurred in an unspecified location. LaShonda reported four instances of alleged harassment to Fort,\n\ntwo to Maples, and two to Pippin. LaShonda reported the final instance of harassment, the May 19\n\nincident, to appellant and Querry. The complaint does not allege that any faculty member knew of\n\nmore than four instances of harassment, and the complaint indicates that Principal Querry learned\n\nof only one instance of harassment before his meeting with appellant and LaShonda on May 19.\n\n       The complaint does not state what action each of the teachers took upon being informed by\n\nLaShonda of G.F.'s demeaning conduct. We assume for appellant's benefit that the teachers took\n\nno action other than Fort's apparent notification of Principal Querry after one of the first three\n\ninstances of alleged harassment and Fort's decision around March 17, 1993, to move LaShonda's\n\nassigned seat away from that of G.F. We will also accept as true that Principal Querry took no\n\nmeasures against G.F. other than threatening him with disciplinary action at some point before his\n\nMay 19 meeting with appellant and her daughter. For example, we assume for appellant's benefit\n\nthat someone other than the school staff instigated the prosecution of G.F.\n\n       Appellant claims that LaShonda suffered mental anguish because of G.F.'s behavior. As\nindicia of this emotional trauma, the complaint states that LaShonda's grades dropped during the\n\n1992-1993 school year and that LaShonda wrote a suicide note in April 1993. Based on the above\n\nallegations, appellant contends that \"[t]he deliberate indifference by Defendants to the unwelcomed\n\n[sic] sexual advances of a student upon LaShonda created an intimidating, hostile, offensive and\n\nabuse [sic] school environment in violation of Title IX.\" We therefore consider whether Title IX\n\nallows a claim against a school board based on a school official's failure to remedy a known hostile\n\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fenvironment6 caused by the sexual harassment of one student by another (\"student-student sexual\n\nharassment\").\n\n                                                 II.\n\n       Title IX provides that \"[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded\n\nfrom participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any\n\neducation program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\" 20 U.S.C. § 1681 (1994).\n\nAlthough nothing in the plain language of Title IX speaks to the issue of student-student sexual\n\nharassment, several district courts have held that Title IX allows a student to sue a school board for\n\nfailing to prevent hostile-environment sexual harassment by another student.              See Doe v.\n\nLondonderry Sch. Dist., No. 95-469-JD, http://lw.bna.com/ # 0708, --- F.Supp. ---- (D. N.H. June\n\n13, 1997); Nicole M. v. Martinez Unified Sch. Dist., 964 F.Supp. 1369, 1337-78 (N.D.Cal.); Collier\n\nv. William Penn Sch. Dist., 956 F.Supp. 1209, 1213—14 (E.D.Pa.1997); Bruneau By and Through\n\nSchofield v. South Kortright Cent. Sch. Dist., 935 F.Supp. 162, 172 (N.D.N.Y.1996); Doe v.\n\nPetaluma City Sch. Dist., 830 F.Supp. 1560, 1576 (N.D.Cal.1993), rev'd on other grounds, 54 F.3d\n\n1447 (9th Cir.1995); Burrow v. Postville Community Sch. Dist., 929 F.Supp. 1193, 1205 (N.D.Iowa\n\n1996); Wright v. Mason City Community Sch. Dist., 940 F.Supp. 1412, 1419-20 (N.D.Iowa 1996);\n\nBosley v. Kearney R-1 Sch. Dist., 904 F.Supp. 1006, 1023 (W.D.Mo.1995); Oona R.-S. v. Santa\n\nRosa City Schs., 890 F.Supp. 1452, 1469 (N.D.Cal.1995); Patricia H. v. Berkeley Unified Sch. Dist.,\n\n830 F.Supp. 1288, 1293 (N.D.Cal.1993). But see Garza v. Galena Park Indep. Sch. Dist., 914\n\n\n\n   6\n    The term \"hostile environment\" sexual harassment originated in employment litigation under\n§ 703 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Pub.L. No. 88-352, 78 Stat. 241, 255 (1964) (codified at\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2 (1994)) (\"Title VII\"). Hostile-environment sexual harassment occurs\nwhenever an employee's speech or conduct creates an atmosphere that is sufficiently severe or\npervasive to alter another employee's working conditions. See Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc.,\n510 U.S. 17, 21-22, 114 S.Ct. 367, 370-71, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993). As discussed infra, n.13,\nwe conclude that Title VII standards of liability, borrowed from the employment context, do not\ncontrol our resolution of this case. Nevertheless, for purposes of our discussion of appellant's\nclaim, we construe the complaint to allege that G.F.'s speech or conduct created an atmosphere\nthat was sufficiently hostile or abusive to alter the conditions of LaShonda's learning\nenvironment.\n\n                                                  6\n\fF.Supp. 1437, 1438 (S.D.Tex.1994) (\"[A] student cannot bring a hostile environment claim under\n\nTitle IX.\").\n\n        The courts of appeals, however, have been less enthusiastic. The Fifth Circuit has held that\n\nno cause of action exists where a school board merely knew or should have known of peer sexual\n\nharassment and failed to act. See Rowinsky v. Bryan Ind. Sch. Dist., 80 F.3d 1006, 1016 (5th Cir.),\n\ncert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 165, 136 L.Ed.2d 108 (1996). Other circuits have resolved\n\ncomplaints of student-student sexual harassment without deciding whether a cause of action exists\n\nunder Title IX for this alleged harm. See, e.g., Seamons v. Snow, 84 F.3d 1226, 1232—33 (10th\n\nCir.1996) (holding that the plaintiff failed to state a valid claim for student-student sexual\n\nharassment because he failed to allege that the harassment in question was on account of his sex);\n\nMurray v. New York Univ. College of Dentistry, 57 F.3d 243, 250 (2nd Cir.1995) (holding that, even\n\nif Title IX created a private cause of action for sexual harassment by a non-employee of the school,\n\nplaintiff failed to allege that school officials knew or should have known of the harassment); Doe\n\nv. Petaluma City Sch. Dist., 54 F.3d 1447, 1452 (9th Cir.1994) (holding that a defendant school\n\ncounselor was entitled to qualified immunity against a claim that he failed to respond to known\n\nsexual harassment of the plaintiff by other students).\n\n        The Supreme Court has not squarely addressed the issue of student-student sexual\n\nharassment. In general, the Court has allowed private plaintiffs to proceed under Title IX only in\ncases that allege intentional gender discrimination by the administrators of educational institutions.\n\nAccording to the Court, plaintiffs can state a claim under Title IX by alleging that a federally funded\n\neducational institution, acting through its employees, intentionally subjected them to discrimination\n\nin its educational programs or activities. See Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 709,\n\n99 S.Ct. 1946, 1964, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). For example, where a teacher engaged a student in\n\nsexually oriented conversations, solicited dates from her, forcibly kissed her on the mouth, and thrice\n\nremoved her from another class in order to engage in coercive sexual intercourse with her in a\n\nprivate office at the school, the Court found that the school board could be held liable for his actions.\n\n\n                                                   7\n\fSee Franklin v. Gwinnett County Pub. Schs., 503 U.S. 60, 63-64, 76, 112 S.Ct. 1028, 1031, 1038,\n\n117 L.Ed.2d 208 (1992).\n\n       Neither the Supreme Court nor this court has ever found, however, that a school board can\n\nbe held liable for failing to prevent non-employees from discriminating against students on the basis\n\nof sex. Appellant does not allege that any employee of the Board intentionally discriminated against\n\nLaShonda by personally participating in G.F.'s offensive conduct toward her. Rather, appellant\n\nalleges that the Board violated Title IX by failing adequately to respond to LaShonda's complaints.\n\nNeither the Supreme Court nor this court has considered whether a Title IX plaintiff can proceed\n\nunder this theory. In short, by seeking direct liability of the Board for the wrongdoing of a student,\n\nappellant argues for an extension of liability under Title IX. We examine the legislative history of\n\nTitle IX to determine whether Congress intended this provision to reach appellant's allegations.\n\n                                                 A.\n\n       The provision now known as Title IX emerged from a flurry of bills regarding public\n\neducation. In June and July 1970, the House Subcommittee on Education of the House Committee\n\non Education and Labor, under the leadership of Representative Edith Green, held hearings on\n\ngender discrimination in federally funded educational programs. See Discrimination Against\n\nWomen: Hearings on Section 805 of H.R. 16098 Before the Special Subcomm. on Education of the\n\nHouse Comm. on Education and Labor, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970) [hereinafter House Hearings\n]. None of the testimony before Representative Green's subcommittee concerned student-student\n\nsexual harassment or related issues, such as school discipline. Instead, the subcommittee's work\n\nfocused on eliminating gender discrimination in school admissions and in the employment decisions\n\nof school administrators.\n\n       By 1970, section 703 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 already prohibited gender\n\ndiscrimination in employment. See Civil Rights Act of 1964, Pub.L. No. 88-352, § 703, 78 Stat.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\f241, 255 (1964) (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2 (1994)) (\"Title VII\").7 Title VII, however, did not\n\napply to educational institutions. See § 702, 78 Stat. at 255 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. §\n\n2000e-1 (1994)). Similarly, section 601 of the Civil Rights Act prohibited racial discrimination by\n\nall recipients of federal funding. See § 601, 78 Stat. at 252 (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 2000d (1994))\n\n(\"Title VI\").8 Title VI did not ban gender discrimination by recipients of federal funding.\n\n       To fill this gap in antidiscrimination legislation, the subcommittee drafted a proposed\n\namendment to H.R. 16098, 91st Cong. (1970). This amendment would have applied to schools the\n\nnon-discrimination requirements of Title VII and added \"sex\" to the types of discrimination banned\n\nby Title VI. See House Hearings, supra, at 1. In other words, the subcommittee's amendment was\n\ndesigned to bridge the gap between Title VII and Title VI. The amendment, however, never reached\n\nthe House floor. See North Haven Bd. of Educ. v. Bell, 456 U.S. 512, 523 n. 13, 102 S.Ct. 1912,\n\n1919, n. 13, 72 L.Ed.2d 299 (1982).\n\n       On April 6, 1971, a new education bill was introduced in the House. See H.R. 7248, 92nd\n\nCong. (1971). This bill contained a provision similar to the amendment proposed by Representative\n\nGreen's subcommittee nearly one year earlier.         Title X of H.R. 7248 prohibited gender\n\ndiscrimination in any education program or activity receiving federal financial support. H.R.Rep.\n\nNo. 92-554, at 108 (1972), reprinted in 1972 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2462, 2511-12. The House report on\n\nH.R. 7248 described this provision as a response to discriminatory admissions policies and\n\nemployment practices at federally funded schools. See id. Once again, neither the House report nor\n\nthe underlying testimony discussed student-student sexual harassment.\n\n\n\n   7\n    Title VII states, \"It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer ... to\ndiscriminate against any individual with respect to ... compensation, terms, conditions, or\nprivileges of employment, because of such individual's ... sex.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1)\n(1994).\n   8\n    Title VI provides that \"[n]o person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or\nnational origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to\ndiscrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\" 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000d (1994).\n\n                                                 9\n\f       While the House bill remained in committee, the Senate was considering a similar education\n\nbill. See S. 659, 92nd Cong. (1971). The Senate bill emerged from the Senate Committee on Labor\n\nand Public Welfare on August 3, 1971, without any antidiscrimination provision at all.\n\nConsequently, on August 5, 1971, Senator Birch Bayh introduced on the Senate floor an amendment\n\nto the committee's version of S. 659. See 117 Cong. Rec. 30,156. (1971). His amendment, like the\n\nHouse provision drafted by Representative Green's subcommittee, extended the antidiscrimination\n\nprovisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to gender discrimination by federally funded \"institutions\n\nof higher learning.\"9 See id. at 30,155. In defending his amendment, Senator Bayh did not discuss\n\nstudent-student sexual harassment, nor did he discuss school discipline. He focused on gender\n\ndiscrimination in school admissions and employment opportunities for female teachers. See id. at\n\n30,155-56. In any event, the Senate rejected Bayh's amendment as non-germane, id. at 30,415, and\n\nthe Senate passed S. 659 on August 6, 1971, without an antidiscrimination provision.\n\n       On November 3, 1971, the House began consideration of S. 659, as passed by the Senate.\n\nThe House \"amended\" the Senate bill by striking virtually the entire contents of S. 659 and replacing\n\nit with the contents of H.R. 7248, including the antidiscrimination provision. See S.Rep. No. 92-\n\n604, at 1 (1972), reprinted in 1972 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2595, 2595. The House made this change without\n\nofficial comment and passed its version of S. 659 on November 4, 1971. See 117 Cong. Rec. at\n\n30,882.\n\n       On November 24, 1971, the Senate, by unanimous consent, referred the House version of\n\nS. 659 back to the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, which proceeded to amend the House\n\nversion to conform to the original Senate version. See S.Rep. No. 92-604, at 1-2 (1972), reprinted\n\nin 1972 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2595, 2595-96.         Once again, the committee did not discuss gender\n\ndiscrimination at all, much less sexual harassment among students. On February 7, 1972, the Senate\n\n\n   9\n    Senator Bayh's first amendment provided, \"No person ... shall, on the ground of sex, ... be\nsubject to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by a public institution of\nhigher education, or any school or department of graduate education, which is a recipient of\nFederal financial assistance for any education program or activity.\" 117 Cong. Rec. at 30,156.\n\n                                                 10\n\fcommittee sent its own version of S. 659 back to the floor of the Senate. See 118 Cong. Rec. 2806\n\n(1972).\n\n          Once the bill returned to the Senate floor, Senator Bayh again introduced an amendment to\n\nadd an antidiscrimination provision.10 See id. at 5802-03. Bayh's proposal was intended to \"close[\n\n] loopholes in existing legislation relating to general education programs and employment resulting\n\nfrom those programs.\" Id. at 5803. In support of his amendment, Senator Bayh stated,\n\n          we are dealing with three basically different types of discrimination here[:] ... discrimination\n          in admission to an institution, discrimination of [sic] available services or studies within an\n          institution once students are admitted, and discrimination in employment within an\n          institution, as a member of the faculty or whatever.\n\nId. at 5812. To counter these problems, Senator Bayh proposed a provision he thought would \"cover\n\nsuch crucial aspects as admissions procedures, scholarships, and faculty employment, with limited\n\nexceptions.\" Id. at 5803. Yet again, no senator mentioned student-student sexual harassment or\n\nschool discipline.\n\n          The Senate adopted Bayh's second amendment on February 28, 1972. See 118 Cong. Rec.\n\nat 5815 (1972). Because of irreconcilable differences between the House and Senate versions of S.\n\n659, both Houses referred the bill to a conference committee. See S. Conf. Rept. No. 92-798, at 1\n\n(1972). The conference committee reported out a joint bill containing the antidiscrimination\n\nmeasure now known as Title IX. The committee, however, did not explain its reasons for including\n\nTitle IX. The conference bill passed both Houses and was signed into law on June 23, 1972. See 118\n\nCong. Rec. at 22,702. Throughout this long legislative history, the drafters of Title IX never\n\ndiscussed student-student sexual harassment or the related issue of school discipline.\n\n                                                    B.\n\n          While the legislative history of Title IX does not indicate that Congress authorized a private\n\ncause of action for studentstudent sexual harassment, the legislative history does show that Title IX\n\n\n   10\n     Senator Bayh's second amendment stated, \"No person ... shall, on the basis of sex, ... be\nsubjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial\nassistance....\" 118 Cong. Rec. at 5803.\n\n                                                    11\n\fwas enacted under the Spending Clause of Article I. See U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1.11 When\n\nCongress conditions the receipt of federal funding upon a recipient's compliance with federal\n\nstatutory directives, Congress is acting pursuant to its spending power. See Guardians Ass'n v. Civil\n\nServ. Comm'n, 463 U.S. 582, 598-99, 103 S.Ct. 3221, 3230-31, 77 L.Ed.2d 866 (1983) (opinion of\n\nWhite, J.). The legislative history of Title IX indicates that Congress intended to impose upon\n\nrecipients of federal educational assistance a requirement of non-discrimination on the basis of sex.\n\nThe Spending Clause authorized Congress to impose this condition.\n\n        Representative Green put it succinctly: \"If we are writing the law, I would say that any\n\ninstitution could be all men or all women, but my own feeling is that they do it with their own funds\n\nand not taxpayers' funds.\" Higher Education Amendments of 1971: Hearings on H.R. 32, H.R.\n\n5191, H.R. 5192, H.R. 5193, and H.R. 7248 Before the Special Subcomm. on Education of the House\n\nComm. on Education and Labor, 92nd Cong., 1st Sess. 581 (1971). Representative Green also\n\nquoted with approval President Nixon, who had stated, \"Neither the President nor the Congress nor\n\nthe conscience of the Nation can permit money which comes from all the people to be used in a way\n\nwhich discriminates against some of the people.\" 117 Cong. Rec. at 39,257 (1971) (statement of\n\nRep. Green). To Senator Bayh, the reach of Title IX was clearly restricted to federally funded\n\ninstitutions. See 118 Cong. Rec. at 5812. In support of Title IX, Senator McGovern stated, \"I urge\n\nmy colleagues to take every opportunity to prohibit Federal funding of sex discrimination.\" 117\n\nCong. Rec. at 30,158. This legislative history clearly shows that Congress intended Title IX to be\n\n\n\n\n   11\n    Section 8 of Article I provides, in part, that \"[t]he Congress shall have [the] Power To ...\nprovide for the ... general Welfare of the United States.\" U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1.\n\n                                                 12\n\fa \"typical \"contractual' spending-power provision.\"12 Guardians Ass'n, 463 U.S. at 599, 103 S.Ct.\n\nat 3231.\n\n        In addition to these indications of congressional intent, similarities between Title IX and\n\nTitle VI indicate that Title IX was enacted pursuant to the Spending Clause. As noted above, Title\n\nVI prohibits recipients of federal funding from engaging in race discrimination. In Guardians\n\nAssociation v. Civil Service Commission, at least six members of the Supreme Court agreed that\n\nTitle VI was enacted under the Spending Clause. See 463 U.S. at 598-99, 629, 638, 103 S.Ct. at\n\n3230-31, 3247, 3251; see also Lau v. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563, 568-69, 94 S.Ct. 786, 789, 39 L.Ed.2d\n\n1 (1974) (describing how a school district \"contractually agreed to comply with title VI\" when it\n\naccepted federal funding).\n\n        As Justice White quoted from the legislative history of Title VI, \"It is not a regulatory\n\nmeasure, but an exercise of the unquestioned power of the Federal Government to fix the terms on\n\nwhich Federal funds shall be disbursed.\" Guardians Ass'n, 463 U.S. at 599, 103 S.Ct. at 3231\n\n(quoting 110 Cong. Rec. 6546 (1964) (quoting Oklahoma v. Civil Serv. Comm'n, 330 U.S. 127, 143,\n\n67 S.Ct. 544, 553, 91 L.Ed. 794 (1947))) (internal quotation marks omitted). Justice White summed\n\nup the legislative philosophy behind Title VI: \"Stop the discrimination, get the money; continue\n\nthe discrimination, do not get the money.\" Guardians Ass'n, 463 U.S. at 599, 103 S.Ct. at 3231\n\n   12\n     The Supreme Court has left open the question of whether Title IX was enacted under the\nSpending Clause. See Franklin, 503 U.S. at 75 n. 8, 112 S.Ct. at 1038 n. 8. One could argue, as\ndid the petitioner in Franklin, that Title IX was enacted under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment,\nwhich provides Congress with the authority to enact legislation preventing states from\n\"deny[ing] to any person ... the equal protection of the laws.\" U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1, cl.\n4.\n\n                The Equal Protection Clause, however, only protects against action by\n        state-sponsored entities. See Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 13, 68 S.Ct. 836, 842, 92\n        L.Ed. 1161 (1948). Federal funding does not make a public school a state actor. See\n        Blackburn v. Fisk University, 443 F.2d 121, 123 (6th Cir.1971). Thus, if Title IX had\n        been enacted under the Fourteenth Amendment, then the antidiscrimination provision of\n        Title IX would not reach federally funded schools that were not state actors. We think\n        that the plain language of Title IX commands a different result: no school that receives\n        federal funding may discriminate on the basis of gender. Therefore, we conclude that\n        Title IX was enacted pursuant to a power that can reach non-state actors as well as state\n        actors—the spending power. See Rowinsky, 80 F.3d at 1013 n. 14.\n\n                                                13\n\f(quoting 110 Cong. Rec. at 1542) (internal quotation marks omitted). This interpretation matches\n\nthe plain language of Title VI, which conditions the disbursement of federal funds on the recipient's\n\nagreement not to discriminate on the basis of race. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000d (1994).\n\n       The language of Title IX is virtually identical to the language of Title VI. See 117 Cong. Rec.\n\nat 30,156 (statement of Sen. Bayh). The only differences are the substitution of the words \"on the\n\nbasis of sex\" for the words \"on the ground of race, color, or national origin\" and the insertion of the\n\nword \"educational\" in front of the words \"program or activity.\" See Grove City College v. Bell, 465\n\nU.S. 555, 586, 104 S.Ct. 1211, 1228, 79 L.Ed.2d 516 (1984) (Brennan, J., concurring in part and\n\ndissenting in part); compare 42 U.S.C. § 2000d with 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). Not surprisingly, the\n\nSupreme Court has found that \"Title IX was patterned after Title VI.\" Cannon, 441 U.S. at 694, 99\n\nS.Ct. at 1956.\n\n       The Supreme Court's study of the legislative history of Title IX has led it to conclude that\n\nthe drafters of Title IX intended that courts interpret it in the same way they have interpreted Title\n\nVI. Id. at 696, 99 S.Ct. at 1957. Therefore, we find that Title IX, like Title VI, was enacted under\n\nCongress' power to spend for the general welfare of the United States. See Rosa H. v. San Elizario\n\nIndep. Sch. Dist., 106 F.3d 648, 654 (5th Cir.1997); Lieberman v. University of Chicago, 660 F.2d\n\n1185, 1187 (7th Cir.1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 937, 102 S.Ct. 1993, 72 L.Ed.2d 456 (1982). We\n\nnow consider the implications of this finding.\n                                                 III.\n\n                                                  A.\n\n        When Congress enacts legislation pursuant to the Spending Clause, it in effect offers to form\n\na contract with potential recipients of federal funding. See Pennhurst v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17,\n\n101 S.Ct. 1531, 1540, 67 L.Ed.2d 694 (1981). Recipients who accept federal monies also accept the\n\nconditions Congress has attached to its offer. See South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 206, 107\n\nS.Ct. 2793, 2795-96, 97 L.Ed.2d 171 (1987). A prospective recipient is free to decline a grant of\n\nfederal funding. See New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 168, 112 S.Ct. 2408, 2424, 120\n\n\n                                                  14\n\fL.Ed.2d 120 (1992). Similarly, a current recipient may withdraw from a federal program and\n\ndecline further funding if it so chooses. See Guardians Ass'n, 463 U.S. at 596, 103 S.Ct. at 3229.\n\nThe freedom of recipients to decline prospectively or to terminate retrospectively a grant of federal\n\nfunding ensures that they will remain responsive to the preferences of their local constituents. See\n\nNew York, 505 U.S. at 168, 112 S.Ct. at 2424.\n\n        To ensure the voluntariness of participation in federal programs, the Supreme Court has\n\nrequired Congress to give potential recipients unambiguous notice of the conditions they are\n\nassuming when they accept federal funding. Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17, 101 S.Ct. at 1540. A\n\nspending power provision must read like a prospectus and give funding recipients a clear signal of\n\nwhat they are buying. The Court has explained, \"By insisting that Congress speak with a clear\n\nvoice, we enable the States to exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant of the consequences of\n\ntheir participation.\" Id. With regard to the case at hand, \"Congress must be unambiguous in\n\nexpressing to school districts the conditions it has attached to the receipt of federal funds.\" Canutillo\n\nIndep. Sch. Dist. v. Leija, 101 F.3d 393, 398 (5th Cir.1996), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct.\n\n2434, 138 L.Ed.2d 195 (1997).          We therefore consider whether Congress gave the Board\n\nunambiguous notice that it could be held liable for failing to stop G.F.'s harassment of LaShonda.\n\n        Appellant and the United States Department of Justice, as amicus curiae, argue that Title\n\nIX gave the Board clear notice of this form of liability. Appellant points to the Supreme Court's\ndecision in Franklin. In Franklin, the Court suggested that \"th[e] notice problem does not arise in\n\na case ... in which intentional discrimination is alleged.\" 503 U.S. at 74-75, 112 S.Ct. at 1037. The\n\nCourt stated that the plain language of Title IX imposes on schools a duty not to discriminate on the\n\nbasis of sex, and when a school teacher sexually harasses a student, that teacher is discriminating\n\non the basis of sex. Id. at 75, 112 S.Ct. at 1037. Appellant argues that a school employee is\n\nintentionally discriminating on the basis of sex when he or she fails to prevent one student from\n\n\n\n\n                                                   15\n\fsexually harassing another.13 Hence, appellant asserts that the school board here had sufficient\n\n   13\n     Appellant and the Department of Justice argue that we should use Title VII standards of\nliability to interpret Title IX. An employer is directly liable under Title VII if it is deliberately\nindifferent to peer sexual harassment in the workplace. See Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 111\nF.3d 1530, 1538-39 (11th Cir.1997) (en banc). Appellant argues that a school should also be\nliable if it is deliberately indifferent to peer sexual harassment at school.\n\n                The superficial appeal of this argument has attracted the adherence of a few\n        courts. See, e.g., Bruneau, 935 F.Supp. at 170-71. These courts have applied Title VII\n        standards of liability to Title IX cases simply because (1) Title VII and Title IX both deal\n        with sexual harassment and (2) the Supreme Court once cited a Title VII case in\n        discussing liability under Title IX, see generally Franklin, 503 U.S. at 75, 112 S.Ct. at\n        1037 (quoting Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 64, 106 S.Ct. 2399, 2404, 91\n        L.Ed.2d 49 (1986)). See Bruneau, 935 F.Supp. at 170-71.\n\n                However, the Supreme Court has never discussed student-student sexual\n        harassment or generally applied Title VII jurisprudence to Title IX cases. Perhaps for\n        this reason, some courts that have imposed Title VII-type liability under Title IX have\n        refused—without much explanation—to apply all of Title VII jurisprudence to Title IX.\n        See, e.g., Bruneau, 935 F.Supp. at 169-70 (\"[T]he Court cautions that by holding that\n        Title VII legal standards apply to an analysis of Title IX claims, the Court is not holding\n        that the entirety of Title VII jurisprudence must be applied to Title IX.\"). Other courts\n        have altogether refused to apply Title VII jurisprudence to Title IX. See, e.g., Rosa H.,\n        106 F.3d at 656 (\"Franklin 's single citation to Meritor Savings to support the Court's\n        conclusion that sexual harassment is sex discrimination does not by itself justify the\n        importation of other aspects of Title VII law into the Title IX context.\").\n\n                We decline appellant's invitation to use Title VII standards of liability to resolve\n        this Title IX case. See Doe v. Petaluma City Sch. Dist., 54 F.3d 1447, 1450-51 (9th\n        Cir.1994). First, Title VII and Title IX are worded differently. If Congress wished Title\n        IX to be interpreted like the earlier-enacted Title VII, Congress would have written Title\n        IX to read like Title VII. Congress did not. Interpreting the plain language of different\n        statutes does not automatically produce the same result simply because both statutes\n        proscribe similar behavior.\n\n                Second, Title VII was enacted under the far-reaching Commerce Clause and § 5\n        of the Fourteenth Amendment. See E.E.O.C. v. Pacific Press Publ'g Ass'n, 676 F.2d\n        1272, 1279 n. 10 (9th Cir.1982). Title IX was not, and consequently its reach is\n        narrower.\n\n                Third, the exposition of liability under Title VII depends upon agency principles.\n        See Meritor, 477 U.S. at 72, 106 S.Ct. at 2408; Faragher, 111 F.3d at 1534-36. Agency\n        principles are useless in discussing liability for student-student harassment under Title\n        IX, because students are not agents of the school board. See generally Restatement\n        (Second) of Agency § 1 (1958) (defining an agency relationship as one in which the\n        principal consents to representation by the agent and the agent consents to control by the\n        principal). Therefore, even if employers owe to employees some sort of nondelegable\n        duty to eliminate peer harassment in the workplace, see generally id. § 492 (discussing\n        employers' duty to provide reasonably safe working conditions for their employees),\n        schools owe to students no comparable duty. In short, Title VII jurisprudence does not\n\n                                                 16\n\fnotice, for purposes of the Spending Clause, that it could be held liable. We disagree.14\n        The terms of Title IX gave educational institutions notice that they must prevent their\n\nemployees from themselves engaging in intentional gender discrimination. See Franklin, 503 U.S.\n\nat 75, 112 S.Ct. at 1037. Thus, school administrators cannot deny admission to female applicants\n\nbecause of their gender. See Cannon, 441 U.S. at 709, 99 S.Ct. at 1964. School administrators\n\ncannot discriminate against teachers on account of sex. See North Haven Bd. of Educ., 456 U.S. at\n\n\n\n\n        control the outcome of this case.\n   14\n    We note that neither this court nor the Supreme Court in Franklin fully addressed the\nquestion of whether a student can state a claim under Title IX for sexual harassment by a\nteacher—much less whether a student can state a claim under Title IX for sexual harassment by\nanother student.\n\n                The defendant school board in Franklin successfully moved the district court to\n        dismiss Franklin's Title IX suit on the ground that \"compensatory relief is unavailable for\n        violations of Title IX,\" a holding which this court affirmed. Franklin v. Gwinnett County\n        Pub. Schs., 911 F.2d 617, 618 (11th Cir.1990). The school board apparently conceded on\n        appeal that the plaintiff's allegations stated a claim under Title IX. See id. at 619.\n\n                Similarly, the school board conceded before the Supreme Court that\n        teacher-student sexual harassment violated Title IX. See Brief for Respondents at 2, 7,\n        Franklin v. Gwinnett County Sch. Dist., 503 U.S. 60, 112 S.Ct. 1028, 117 L.Ed.2d 208\n        (1992). The Supreme Court granted certiorari to consider \"whether the implied right of\n        action under Title IX ... supports a claim for monetary damages.\" Franklin, 503 U.S. at\n        62-63, 112 S.Ct. at 1031. The Court emphasized that \"the question of what remedies are\n        available under a statute that provides a private right of action is \"analytically distinct'\n        from the issue of whether such a right exists in the first place.\" Id. at 65-66, 112 S.Ct. at\n        1032. In fact, the Franklin Court rejected the arguments of the United States as amicus\n        curiae precisely because those arguments concerned the existence vel non of a cause of\n        action for teacher-student sexual harassment, a question which the Court considered\n        \"irrelevant.\" Id. at 69, 112 S.Ct. at 1034.\n\n                The Franklin Court discussed the notice element of the Spending Clause solely to\n        counter the school board's argument that \"the normal presumption in favor of all\n        appropriate remedies should not apply because Title IX was enacted pursuant to\n        Congress' Spending Clause power.\" Id. at 74, 112 S.Ct. at 1037. Viewed in this light,\n        the Supreme Court's suggestion that teacher-student sexual harassment gives rise to a\n        cause of action under Title IX was arguably dicta. We assume that Franklin created a\n        cause of action for teacher-student sexual harassment under Title IX, but we are wary of\n        extending this assumed holding to student-student sexual harassment. In any event, the\n        Court's discussion of this issue does not foreclose our own consideration of whether\n        appellant has stated a claim under Title IX.\n\n                                                 17\n\f530, 102 S.Ct. at 1922-23. Teachers cannot sexually harass their students. See Franklin, 503 U.S.\n\nat 74-75, 112 S.Ct. at 1037.\n\n        The present complaint, however, does not allege that a school employee discriminated\n\nagainst LaShonda in any of the foregoing ways. The complaint does not allege, for example, that\n\nFort, Maples, Pippin, or Querry sexually harassed LaShonda. Rather, the complaint alleges that\n\nthese individuals failed to take measures sufficient to prevent a non-employee from discriminating\n\nagainst LaShonda. We do not think that the Board was on notice when it accepted federal funding\n\nthat it could be held liable in this situation.\n\n                                                  B.\n\n        First, as we have noted, nothing in the language or history of Title IX suggests that Title IX\n\nimposes liability for student-student sexual harassment.15 Second, the imposition of this form of\n\nliability would so materially affect schools' decisions whether to accept Title IX funding that it\n\nwould require an express, unequivocal disclosure by Congress. Adopting appellant's theory of\n\nliability, however, could give rise to a form of \"whipsaw\" liability, under which public schools\n\nwould face lawsuits from both the alleged harasser and the alleged victim of the harassment.\n\nMoreover, reasonable public school officials could perceive the likely number of such suits to be\n\nlarge. Because our endorsement of appellant's theory of liability would alter materially the terms\n\nof the contract between Congress and recipients of federal funding, appellant fails to state a claim\nupon which relief can be granted.\n\n        The essence of appellant's complaint is this: once a public school student complains to her\n\nteacher that a classmate has sexually harassed her, the teacher and the school board become subject\n\n   15\n     The dissent devotes a great deal of attention to whether Congress intended that Title IX\ncreate a cause of action for student-student sexual harassment. See Post, at 3372-75. We\nseriously doubt whether Congress considered this problem at all when it enacted Title IX, but, in\nany case, the dissent's heavy reliance on its conclusory analysis of the language and history of\nTitle IX is largely irrelevant. The question is not whether Congress intended to create a cause of\naction under Title IX for student-student sexual harassment but, rather, whether Congress gave\nschool boards notice of this form of liability. In the absence of any supporting legislative\nhistory, statutory construction of ambiguous language cannot support a finding of notice as\nrequired by the Spending Clause.\n\n                                                  18\n\fto the threat of liability in money damages under federal law if they can prevent the classmate from\n\nharassing again and fail to do so.16 See, e.g., Bosley, 904 F.Supp. at 1023 (\"Once a school district\n\nbecomes aware of sexual harassment, it must promptly take remedial action which is reasonably\n\ncalculated to end the harassment.\") (emphasis added). In practical terms, this means that school\n\nofficials would have to isolate an alleged harasser from other students through suspension or\n\nexpulsion.\n\n        The complaint devotes little attention to what measures the Board could have taken to avoid\n\nliability. The complaint admits that Querry and Fort tried to stop G.F.'s harassment by threatening\n\nhim and by separating him from LaShonda within Fort's classroom. Appellant clearly does not\n\nbelieve that these measures sufficed. As evidence of \"deliberate indifference,\" the complaint also\n\nalleges that the Board failed to create a school sexual harassment policy. It seems unlikely,\n\nhowever, that the mere existence of such a policy would foreclose liability under appellant's theory\n\nof the case.\n\n        Apparently, the appropriateness of the Board's remedial measures depends on whether the\n\nharassment actually ends. The complaint suggests that G.F. should have been \"suspended, kept\n\naway from LaShonda, or disciplined in [some] way\" after LaShonda complained. The Department\n\nof Justice argues broadly that a school board must take \"effective action\" in response to an allegation\n\nof harassment. We take these arguments to mean the same thing: a school board must immediately\n\nisolate an alleged harasser from other students to avoid the threat of a lawsuit under Title IX.\n\n        Physical separation of the alleged harasser from other students is the only way school boards\n\ncan ensure that they cannot be held liable for future acts of harassment. If a school official simply\n\ntells the alleged harasser, \"Don't do it again,\" and the harasser does it again, then the board becomes\n\nsusceptible to the argument that it had the power to end the harassment, but failed to do so out of\n\n   16\n     Private schools that receive federal funding would also be subject to suit under appellant's\ntheory of Title IX liability. Private school teachers and administrators, however, would not\nordinarily be subject to suit under § 1983, as would their public school counterparts, because\nthey would not ordinarily be acting under color of state law. See § 1983; see generally supra, n.\n2. Accordingly, we discuss individual liability only with respect to public school employees.\n\n                                                  19\n\f\"deliberate indifference.\" If the official merely transfers the alleged harasser to another classroom,\n\nthe board faces the threat of suit for any acts of harassment committed by him in the new\n\nclassroom—after all, the school had notice of his dangerous propensities and did not do all it could\n\nto prevent him from harassing his new classmates. Segregating the sexes into two separate programs\n\nwithin the same school would violate the spirit, if not the letter, of Title IX. Therefore, in practical\n\nterms, to avoid the threat of Title IX liability under appellant's theory of the case, a school must\n\nimmediately suspend or expel a student accused of sexual harassment.17\n\n        Appellant's standard of liability therefore creates for school boards and school officials a\n\nHobson's choice: On the one hand, if a student complains to a school official about sexual\n\nharassment, the official must suspend or expel the alleged harasser or the board will face potential\n\nliability to the victim. Moreover, if a public school official with control over the harasser finds out\n\nabout his misconduct and fails to isolate him, that official runs the risk of personal liability under\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 for depriving the victim of her Title IX rights if the harasser engages in further\n\nabuse.18 See Nicole M., 964 F.Supp. 1369, 1382; Oona R.-S., 890 F.Supp. at 1462; see also Lillard\n\nv. Shelby County Bd. of Educ., 76 F.3d 716, 723-24 (6th Cir.1996) (holding that the remedial scheme\n\nof Title IX does not preclude a section 1983 claim based on the same conduct).\n\n        On the other hand, if the public school official, presiding over a disciplinary hearing,\n\nsuspends or expels the alleged harasser, the school board may face a lawsuit alleging that the official\nacted out of bias—out of fear of suit. The right to a public education under state law is a property\n\n   17\n     This is the approach, incidentally, that some school boards have already adopted. See, e.g.,\nTamar Lewin, Kissing Cases Highlight Schools' Fears of Liability for Sexual Harassment, N.Y.\nTimes, Oct. 6, 1996, at A22, A22 (\"While the recent suspensions of two little boys for kissing\ngirls were widely seen as excessive, they highlight the confusion that is sweeping schools as\neducators grapple with a growing fear that they may be sued for failing to intervene when one\nstudent sexually harasses another.\").\n   18\n    If we were to rule in favor of appellant, Fort, Maples, Pippin, Querry, and Dumas would\narguably be entitled to qualified immunity against § 1983 liability for their actions in this case.\nSee Doe v. Petaluma City Sch. Dist., 54 F.3d 1447, 1452 (9th Cir.1995). Ruling in favor of\nappellant, however, would deprive future, similarly situated defendants of qualified immunity,\nbecause it would clearly establish a statutory right of which a reasonable school employee would\nknow.\n\n                                                  20\n\finterest protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Goss v. Lopez, 419\n\nU.S. 565, 574, 95 S.Ct. 729, 736, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 (1975). Accordingly, students facing a deprivation\n\nof this right must be afforded due process.19 Id. at 579, 95 S.Ct. at 738. A fair hearing in a fair\ntribunal is a basic requirement of due process. In re Murchison, 349 U.S. 133, 136, 75 S.Ct. 623,\n\n625, 99 L.Ed. 942 (1955). The decisionmaker who presides over the hearing must be impartial.20\n\n   19\n     If Georgia provided a procedure for challenging the impartiality of the school's\ndecisionmaker, the alleged harasser would have received all the process to which he was entitled,\nand he would have no claim under the Due Process Clause. See McKinney v. Pate, 20 F.3d\n1550, 1557 (11th Cir.1994) (en banc). Absent such a procedure, he could bring suit in federal\ncourt under § 1983, alleging that the state failed to accord him the process he was due. Whether\nthe alleged harasser repairs to state court or to federal court, however, the disruptive effect on\nschool officials, teachers, and students would be the same.\n   20\n    In his separate opinion, JUDGE CARNES insists that the requirements of the procedural\ncomponent of the Due Process Clause are met when a school disciplinarian affords a student\nfaced with suspension an \"informal\" opportunity to explain his side of the story. See Post, at\n3372-73. JUDGE CARNES' reasoning is correct, as far as it goes, but he focuses on one narrow\nsubset of cases—\"any suspension of up to ten days.\" Post at 3372.\n\n                In Goss, the Supreme Court held that, \"[a]t the very minimum, ... students facing\n        suspension and the consequent interference with a protected property interest must be\n        given some kind of notice and afforded some kind of hearing.\" Id. at 579, 95 S.Ct. at\n        738. The kind of notice and the formality of the hearing will depend, of course, on the\n        nature and severity of the deprivation the student faces: for example, \"due process\n        requires, in connection with a suspension of 10 days or less, that the student be given oral\n        or written notice of the charges against him and, if he denies them, an explanation of the\n        evidence the authorities have and an opportunity to present his side of the story.\" Id. at\n        581, 95 S.Ct. at 740 (emphasis added); see also, e.g., Board of Curators v. Horowitz, 435\n        U.S. 78, 86, 98 S.Ct. 948, 953, 55 L.Ed.2d 124 (1978) (noting that a college student's\n        dismissal for academic reasons necessitates fewer procedural protections than a dismissal\n        for disciplinary reasons).\n\n                At the end of its opinion in Goss, however, the Supreme Court stated, \"Longer\n        suspensions or expulsions for the remainder of the school term, or permanently, may\n        require more formal procedures. Nor do we put aside the possibility that in unusual\n        situations, although involving only a short suspension, something more than rudimentary\n        procedures will be required.\" Id. at 584, 95 S.Ct. at 741. The Supreme Court left open\n        the possibility that a more formal notice and hearing would be required for disciplinary\n        actions more serious than ten-day suspensions, and so shall we.\n\n                Furthermore, regardless of the nature of the notice and the quality of the hearing,\n        an individual faced with the deprivation of a property interest is entitled to an impartial\n        decisionmaker—a requirement JUDGE CARNES seems to discount. See, e.g., Nash v.\n        Auburn Univ., 812 F.2d 655, 665 (11th Cir.1987) (\"An impartial decision-maker is an\n        essential guarantee of due process.\"). JUDGE CARNES admits, for example, that a\n        public school principal would be impermissibly biased, for purposes of the Due Process\n\n                                                 21\n\fSee Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U.S. 35, 46, 95 S.Ct. 1456, 1464, 43 L.Ed.2d 712 (1975); McKinney\n\nv. Pate, 20 F.3d 1550, 1561 (11th Cir.1994) (en banc).\n\n        As we explain above, appellant's theory of the case could impose personal liability on any\n\npublic school official who learns of an allegation of harassment and fails to exercise his authority\n\nto prevent a recurrence of the harassment. Were we to adopt appellant's theory of the case,\n\ntherefore, public school officials would have a financial incentive to punish alleged student\n\nharassers. A financial incentive may render a decisionmaker impermissibly biased.21 See Gibson\n\n        Clause, if the principal \"took a bribe from [a] complaining student's parents in return for\n        suspending or expelling [an] alleged wrongdoer.\" Post, at 3373. JUDGE CARNES,\n        however, refuses to accept that a principal would be just as impermissibly biased if the\n        principal were forced to pay money to a complaining student for not suspending or\n        expelling an alleged wrongdoer. We fail to grasp the distinction.\n   21\n     On page 3373-74 of his separate opinion, JUDGE CARNES leads us through a parade of\nhorribles which, he imagines, we have created by suggesting that appellant's theory of the case\nwould potentially give public school officials an impermissible financial incentive to punish\nalleged student harassers. The dire consequences he conjures, however, will never come to pass\nprecisely because we are not adopting appellant's theory of Title IX liability. Only if we were to\nadopt her theory might public school officials face potential liability under both Title IX and the\nprocedural component of the Due Process Clause. But we do not adopt appellant's theory of\nliability.\n\n                With regard to non-school settings, JUDGE CARNES overstates our opinion and\n        then criticizes us for the breadth of our holding. He chides us for suggesting that \"[a]ll\n        federal, state, or local officials called upon to decide what to do in response to one\n        person's complaint about another would have a financial incentive to avoid a lawsuit,\n        which would disqualify them from making a decision.\" Post, at 3374. We suggest\n        nothing of the kind.\n                Nevertheless, on the merits of his critique, we suppose that all officials in such\n        situations could face lawsuits alleging impermissible bias—if none of those officials had\n        any form of immunity from suit, which, of course, they do have. Stated differently,\n        public decisionmakers have immunity from suit to protect them from the sort of bias\n        which might otherwise give rise to violations of the Due Process Clause. Judges, for\n        example, have absolute immunity from suit because \"the independent and impartial\n        exercise of judgment vital to the judiciary might be impaired by exposure to potential\n        damages liability.\" Antoine v. Byers & Anderson, Inc., 508 U.S. 429, 435, 113 S.Ct.\n        2167, 2171, 124 L.Ed.2d 391 (1993). Similar concerns motivate qualified immunity. See\n        generally Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 814, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2736, 73 L.Ed.2d 396\n        (1982) (reasoning that, without qualified immunity, \"there is the danger that fear of being\n        sued will \"dampen the ardor of all but the most resolute, or the most irresponsible [public\n        officials], in the unflinching discharge of their duties' \" (quoting Gregoire v. Biddle, 177\n        F.2d 579, 581 (2nd Cir.1949), cert. denied, 339 U.S. 949, 70 S.Ct. 803, 94 L.Ed. 1363\n        (1950)) (alterations in original)). In fact, as we discuss supra, note 18, the individual\n\n                                                 22\n\fv. Berryhill, 411 U.S. 564, 579, 93 S.Ct. 1689, 1698, 36 L.Ed.2d 488 (1973). Therefore, the\n\ndisciplinary measures required to avoid liability under Title IX could subject the school board to the\n\nthreat of suit by the disciplined harasser.22\n\n        In addition to the threat of this whipsaw liability, schools would face the virtual certainty of\n\nextensive litigation costs. These costs would include not only lawyers fees, but also the burdens\n\nassociated with the disruption of the educational process. The litigation we describe would\n\ninevitably involve teachers, students, and administrators in time-consuming discovery and trial\n\npreparation. Schools could reasonably expect to receive from Congress explicit notice of these\n\nconsequences. They did not.23\n\n\n        defendants in this case would likely be entitled to qualified immunity.\n\n                In sum, we create no new procedural due process rights, as JUDGE CARNES\n        asserts. Our opinion does not even suggest that we would have to create such rights if we\n        were to uphold appellant's theory of Title IX liability. Rather, our opinion states that this\n        form of liability is a logical extension of appellant's theory of the case, and Congress\n        gave no notice to public school boards that they would be potentially undertaking this\n        form of liability when they accepted federal funding under Title IX.\n   22\n     All of the foregoing assumes, of course, that the allegations of harassment are true. While\nwe hesitate to assume that any allegations of student-student sexual harassment are false, we do\nnot doubt that school students will be tempted into mischief by the prospect of swift punishment\nagainst any classmate whom they accuse of sexual harassment.\n\n                 Moreover, public school officials would find such false accusations difficult to\n        combat. Under Title VII standards of liability, which the appellant, the United States,\n        and the dissent seem anxious to adopt, an employer may be sued for retaliating against an\n        employee who complains about sexual harassment. See generally 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n        3(a) (1994) (\"It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer ... to\n        discriminate against any individual ... because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or\n        participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this\n        subchapter.\"). Thus, under the logical implications of appellants theory of Title IX\n        liability, a school board could face a lawsuit from the complaining student if it disciplines\n        her for bringing a vexatious complaint against a classmate. As discussed in the text, the\n        threat of lawsuits under § 1983 against the public school officials themselves would soon\n        follow.\n   23\n     Appellant and the Department of Justice draw our attention to the regulatory activities of the\nOffice of Civil Rights of the United States Department of Justice (\"OCR\"). The OCR issued\ninterim guidelines concerning schoolhouse sexual harassment on August 16, 1996. See Sexual\nHarassment Guidance: Peer Sexual Harassment, 61 Fed.Reg. 42,728 (1996). These guidelines\nissued after the alleged harassment of LaShonda. Moreover, at the time of the alleged\nharassment, the code of federal regulations did not discuss student-student sexual harassment.\n\n                                                  23\n\fSee 34 C.F.R. § 106.31 (1992). Therefore, OCR's regulations did not put the Board on official\nnotice of its potential liability for G.F.'s harassment of LaShonda.\n\n               Nevertheless, appellant and the Department of Justice urge that we defer to the\n       OCR's current interpretation of Title IX for purposes of this case. The OCR issued final\n       policy guidance on student sexual harassment on March 13, 1997. See Sexual\n       Harassment Guidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, or\n       Third Parties, 62 Fed.Reg. 12,034 (1997). In this publication, the OCR constructs a\n       labyrinth of factors and caveats which simply reinforces our conclusion that the Board\n       was not on notice that it could be held liable in the present situation.\n\n              According to the March 13 guidance, schools are liable for failing to eliminate\n\n              sexually harassing conduct (which can include unwelcome sexual advances,\n              requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct of a\n              sexual nature) ... by another student ... that is sufficiently severe, persistent, or\n              pervasive to limit a student's ability to participate in or benefit from an education\n              program or activity, or to create a hostile or abusive educational environment.\n\n       Id. at 12,038.\n\n               Because the meaning of this language may not be obvious to school officials, the\n       March 13 guidance lists several factors which should be taken into account when a\n       student is sent to the office for sexually harassing another student. Among other factors\n       and subfactors, the school official should consider the \"welcomeness\" of the conduct, the\n       age of the harasser, the age of the victim, the relationship between the parties, the degree\n       to which the conduct was sexual in nature, the duration of the conduct, the frequency of\n       the conduct involved, the degree to which the conduct affected the victim's education, the\n       pervasiveness of the conduct at the school, the location of the incident, the occurrence of\n       any similar incidents at the school, the occurrence of any incidents of gender-based but\n       non-sexual harassment, the size of the school, and the number of individuals involved in\n       the incident.\n\n               The school official should keep in mind that \"in some circumstances, nonsexual\n       conduct may take on sexual connotations and may rise to the level of sexual harassment.\"\n       Id. at 12,039. He should also remember that \"a hostile environment may exist even if\n       there is no tangible injury to the student,\" and even if the complaining student was not the\n       target of the harassment. Id. at 12,041. In addition, the official must recall that a single\n       act of student-student harassment can create a hostile environment. See id. Finally, the\n       school official must keep in mind that, if he does not kick the alleged harasser out of\n       school, and the harasser misbehaves again, the official could be personally liable if a jury\n       concludes, after the fact, that he could have done more to prevent the harasser from\n       harming his classmates.\n\n               The foregoing analysis assumes, of course, that the school official actually knew\n       of the complaint against the harasser and summoned him to the front office. According\n       to the OCR, however, the official may be liable even if he did not know about the\n       harassment: the official may cause the school to violate Title IX if he failed to exercise\n       \"due care\" in discovering the misconduct. See id. at 12,042. The foregoing does not\n       address the lawsuit that the harasser's parents will file when the school official summarily\n\n                                                24\n\f                                                 C.\n\n        School boards could reasonably believe that this form of whipsaw liability would arise in a\n\nsubstantial number of cases. According to a 1993 survey of American public school students, 65%\n\nof students in grades eight to eleven were victims of student-student sexual harassment. See\n\nAmerican Ass'n of Univ. Women Educ. Found., Hostile Hallways: The AAUW Survey on Sexual\n\nHarassment in American Schools 11 (1993) [hereinafter AAUW Survey]. Extrapolating from\n\nDepartment of Education statistics, roughly 7,784,000 public school students in grades eight through\n\neleven would consider themselves to be victims of student-student sexual harassment.24\n\nFurthermore, 59% of students (including 52% of female students) in grades eight to eleven\n\nresponded that they had sexually harassed other students. See AAUW Survey, supra, at 11-12. Thus,\n\nif this survey is accurate, around 7,177,000 public school students in grades eight to eleven, male\n\nand female, would admit to sexually harassing other students.\n\n        We do not adopt these statistics as our own definitive guide to the extent of sexual\n\nharassment in America's public schools. We draw attention to these figures only to illustrate what\n\nschool boards would have to consider in deciding whether to accept federal funding under Title IX.\n\nThe AAUW Survey could suggest to reasonable public school officials that a substantial number of\n\nlawsuits will be brought under appellant's theory of Title IX liability. Therefore, imposition of this\n\n\n\n\n        suspends him. According to appellant and the Department of Justice, the Board received\n        clear notice of this form of liability when it accepted federal funding under Title IX. We\n        think not.\n   24\n     To calculate the number of purported student victims of harassment in the nation, we\nmultiplied the percentage of victims provided by the AAUW Survey by the total number of\nstudents enrolled in public schools in grades eight to eleven during the 1992-1993 school year.\nWe obtained the enrollment statistics from the world-wide-web home page of the Department of\nEducation. See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Educ., Enrollment in Public Elementary and Secondary\nSchools, by Grade: Fall 1980 to Fall 1994 (last modified Mar. 1996) http://nces01.ed.gov/nces/\npubs/D96/D96T042.html> [hereinafter U.S. Education ]. We used the same process to calculate\nthe total number of professed student harassers in the nation.\n\n                                                 25\n\fform of liability would materially affect their decision whether to accept federal educational\n\nfunding.25\n\n        An enactment under the Spending Clause must read like a prospectus. Just as a prospectus\n\nmust unambiguously disclose all material facts to a would-be purchaser, an enactment under the\n\nSpending Clause must unambiguously disclose to would-be recipients all facts material to their\n\ndecision to accept Title IX funding. The threat of whipsaw liability in a substantial number of cases\n\nwould materially affect a Title IX recipient's decision to accept federal funding, yet Congress did\n\nnot provide unambiguous notice of this type of liability in the language or history of that statute.\n\nWe will not alter retrospectively the terms of the agreement between Congress and recipients of Title\n\nIX funding.26\n\n   25\n      In JUDGE CARNES' separate opinion, he characterizes our use of statistics as an attempt\n\"to establish that student-student sexual harassment is such a widespread and extensive problem\nthat a different holding of this case would impose massive liability upon school officials and\nboards.\" Post, at 3375. As we indicate in the text, this is not our objective at all. We cite these\nstatistics because school boards may consider them to be a valid indicator of the amount of\nlitigation that they will face. If a lawyer for the Monroe County School Board were trying to\nadvise the Board about the potential costs and benefits of accepting federal funding, would it not\nmatter to that lawyer whether accepting federal funds would give rise to a few lawsuits or\nthousands of lawsuits?\n\n                 JUDGE CARNES suggests that the AAUW Survey overstates the actual number\n        of lawsuits that could be brought under appellant's theory of Title IX liability. We agree\n        that the survey did not use the same definition of student-student sexual harassment as\n        our case law dictates, but statistical purity would arguably require a jury verdict agreeing\n        with the allegations of each student who claimed to have been harassed. In any event,\n        there are plenty of reasons for public school officials to overlook the statistical flaws in\n        the AAUW Survey when it is their own pocketbooks—not those of federal judges—that\n        are at stake.\n   26\n     As noted above, the purpose of enactments under the Spending Clause is \"to further\n[Congress's] broad policy objectives by conditioning receipt of federal moneys upon compliance\nby the recipient with federal statutory and administrative directives.\" Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448\nU.S. 448, 474, 100 S.Ct. 2758, 2772, 65 L.Ed.2d 902 (1980) (opinion of Burger, C.J.). Congress\nuses the spending power \"to induce governments and private parties to cooperate voluntarily\nwith federal policy.\" Id. If no one chooses to receive federal funds under a proposed legislative\nprogram, Congress's intent would be frustrated and its policy objectives would remain\nunfulfilled. See Rowinsky, 80 F.3d at 1013.\n\n                Prospective recipients will decline federal funding and current recipients will\n        withdraw from federal programs if the cost of legislative conditions exceeds the amount\n        of the disbursement. Federal funding represents only 7% of all revenues for public\n\n                                                 26\n\f                                                  IV.\n\n       We condemn the harm that has befallen LaShonda, a harm for which Georgia tort law may\n\nindeed provide redress. Appellant's present complaint, however, fails to state a claim under Title\n\nIX because Congress gave no clear notice to schools and teachers that they, rather than society as\n\na whole, would accept responsibility for remedying student-student sexual harassment when they\n\nchose to accept federal financial assistance under Title IX. Accordingly, the judgment of the district\n\ncourt is AFFIRMED.\n\nEDMONDSON, COX, BIRCH, DUBINA, BLACK and CARNES, Circuit Judges, concur in the\ncourt's opinion with the exception of Parts III.B and III.C.\n\n       BLACK, Circuit Judge, concurring:\n\n       I concur in the Court's judgment and, with the exception of Parts IIIB and IIIC, join in its\n\nopinion. I write separately only to respond to the dissent's contention that the Court's disposition\n\ncontravenes the \"plain meaning\" of Title IX. It is axiomatic that the statutory language is the starting\n\npoint for interpreting the meaning of a statute. Ardestani v. INS, 502 U.S. 129, 135, 112 S.Ct. 515,\n\n519, 116 L.Ed.2d 496 (1991); United States v. McLemore, 28 F.3d 1160, 1162 (11th Cir.1994). If\n\nthe statutory language is unambiguous, the courts must enforce the statute as written absent a\n\nclearly-expressed legislative intent to the contrary. United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 580, 101\n\nS.Ct. 2524, 2527, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981); Consumer Product Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc.,\n\n447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 2056, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980); RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. United\n\n\n       elementary and secondary schools in the United States. During the 1992-1993 school\n       year, for example, American schools received $17,261,252,000 from the federal\n       government out of a total budget of $247,626,168,000. See U.S. Education, supra, at\n       <D96T157.html>.\n\n               School authorities must weigh the benefit of this relatively small amount of\n       funding against not only the threat of substantial institutional and individual liability—as\n       suggested by the AAUW Survey—but also the opportunity costs of devoting to litigation\n       hours that might otherwise be spent running their schools. Because harassment of the\n       sort experienced by LaShonda is rarely observed directly by school officials, Title IX\n       claims of the sort envisioned by appellant would require the time-consuming testimony\n       of numerous student witnesses. Imposing the liability of the sort envisioned by appellant\n       could induce school boards to simply reject federal funding—in contravention of the will\n       of Congress. See Rowinsky, 80 F.3d at 1013.\n\n                                                  27\n\fStates, 955 F.2d 1457, 1460 (11th Cir.1992). On the other hand, where the statutory language is\n\nambiguous, then a court may look to legislative history in an effort to discern the intent of Congress.\n\nSee Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd. v. United States, 108 F.3d 290, 293 (11th Cir.1997); United\n\nStates ex rel. Williams v. NEC Corp., 931 F.2d 1493, 1498 (11th Cir.1991).\n\n        The present case requires us to decide whether Title IX prescribes liability for the failure of\n\na school board to prevent a student from discriminating against a classmate on the basis of sex. The\n\ntext of Title IX provides that \"[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded\n\nfrom participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any\n\neducation program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\" 20 U.S.C. § 1681 (1994). As\n\nthe dissent recognizes, \"[t]he absolute prohibition contained in the text is framed solely in terms of\n\nwho is protected.\" The statute simply does not specify what relationship, if any, the perpetrator of\n\nan underlying act of sexual harassment must have to the federally-funded educational institution to\n\ntrigger Title IX liability.\n\n        The dissent nevertheless divines from congressional silence an unambiguous endorsement\n\nof the proposition that \"[t]he identity of the perpetrator is simply irrelevant.\" Under this conception\n\nof Title IX, liability presumably would attach anytime the school board failed to prevent\n\nanyone—student, teacher, parent, neighborhood resident—from discriminating on the basis of sex\n\nto the extent that such action inhibited a student from realizing the full benefits of federally-funded\neducation. In my view, the text of Title IX permits at least equally plausible constructions that\n\nwould circumscribe liability more narrowly. Specifically, the text of Title IX may be interpreted\n\nto impose liability only when the school board or one of its agents bears direct responsibility for\n\ndiscriminating on the basis of sex, as would be the case had any of Lashonda Davis' teachers\n\nparticipated in the sexual harassment she was forced to endure. The absence of any reliable textual\n\nindication regarding which of these constructions Congress envisioned invites consideration of\n\nlegislative history and the congressional power from which the statute emanates in an effort to\n\ndiscover congressional intent. The Court's approach thus represents an entirely appropriate effort\n\n\n                                                  28\n\fto effectuate congressional will in the absence of unambiguous textual guidance, not, as the dissent\n\nappears to suggest, strident judicial refusal to enforce clearly expressed legislative intent.\n\n       CARNES, Circuit Judge, concurring:\n\n       I concur in the holding that Title IX does not create a cause of action against public school\n\nboards or officials for failure to prevent or remedy student-student sexual harassment. In my view,\n\nthat holding is correct for essentially those reasons stated in Parts I, II, III A, and IV of Judge\n\nTjoflat's opinion, and I join those parts of it, which constitute the opinion of the Court. However,\n\nfor the reasons explained below, I do not join Parts III B and C of Judge Tjoflat's opinion, which\n\nexpress only his own views.1\n\n                                                  I.\n\n       The \"Hobson's choice\" or \"whipsaw liability\" discussion in Part III B of the opinion is based\n\nupon a fundamentally erroneous premise. If school officials could be sued for failing to prevent or\n\nremedy student-student sexual harassment, that part of the opinion says, the potential liability would\n\namount to a financial incentive to punish the accused harassers, which would or could render school\n\nofficials impermissibly biased and require recusal. Of course, a student does have a property interest\n\nin a public education which is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.2\n\n   1\n    Parts I, II, III A, and IV of Judge Tjoflat's opinion constitute the opinion of the Court,\nbecause those parts are joined by six of the ten judges participating in this decision. By contrast,\nnone of the other nine judges participating in this decision have joined Parts III B and C of that\nopinion.\n   2\n    The nature and extent of the protection afforded the property interest in a public education,\nthe due process requirements attendant to its loss, depends upon the severity of the loss. In Goss\nv. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565, 95 S.Ct. 729, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 (1975), the Supreme Court held that, with\nany suspension of up to ten days, all the Due Process Clause requires is for the student to \"be\ngiven oral or written notice of the charges against him and, if he denies them, an explanation of\nthe evidence the authorities have and an opportunity to present his side of the story.\" 419 U.S. at\n581, 95 S.Ct. at 740; accord Arnold v. Board of Educ., 880 F.2d 305, 318 (11th Cir.1989). The\nSupreme Court said in Goss that \"[i]n the great majority of cases the disciplinarian may\ninformally discuss the alleged misconduct with the student minutes after it has occurred,\" and\n\"[w]e hold only that, in being given an opportunity to explain his version of the facts at this\ndiscussion, the student first be told what he is accused of doing and what the basis of the\naccusation is.\" 419 U.S. at 582, 95 S.Ct. at 740. The Court has since explained that all Goss\nrequires before a suspension is an \"informal give and take\" in order to provide the student \"the\nopportunity to characterize his conduct and put it in what he deems the proper context.\" Board\n\n                                                  29\n\fAnd, due process does require that a decision depriving the student of that property interest be made\n\nby someone who does not have a pecuniary interest in having the student suspended or expelled.\n\nTo take an extreme example, regardless of any other process afforded, due process would be violated\n\nif a principal took a bribe from the complaining student's parents in return for suspending or\n\nexpelling the alleged wrongdoer. But it is an entirely different matter to suggest, as Part III B of the\n\nopinion does, that a school official's potential liability to the complaining student if that official fails\n\nto take legally required action amounts to a \"financial incentive\" which renders that official\n\n\"impermissibly biased\" and requires recusal from deciding what action, if any, is required in the\n\ncircumstances. As authority for that novel proposition, the opinion cites only Gibson v. Berryhill,\n\n411 U.S. 564, 579, 93 S.Ct. 1689, 1698, 36 L.Ed.2d 488 (1973). The Gibson decision provides no\n\nsupport for the proposition, because it does not hold, or even imply, that an official's potential\n\nliability for failing to properly exercise decisionmaking authority constitutes a \"financial incentive\"\n\nwhich renders the official \"impermissibly biased.\"\n\n        Gibson involved a state optometry board composed exclusively of private practitioners who\n\nwere in competition with corporate employee optometrists. Those board members had a substantial\n\npecuniary interest in excluding from the market corporate employee optometrists, who accounted\n\nfor nearly half of all the practicing optometrists in the state. The Supreme Court affirmed the district\n\ncourt's holding that the private practitioner's pecuniary interest in eliminating competition\n\ndisqualified them from deciding whether the practice of optometry by corporate employees as such\n\nconstituted unprofessional conduct justifying license revocation. See 411 U.S. at 578-79, 93 S.Ct.\n\nat 1698. That holding does not support the proposition that any time an official can be sued for\n\nfailing to respond properly to a complaint that official is disqualified from making a decision about\n\nhow to respond to the complaint.\n\n\nof Curators v. Horowitz, 435 U.S. 78, 86, 98 S.Ct. 948, 953, 55 L.Ed.2d 124 (1978) (quoting\nGoss, 419 U.S. at 584, 95 S.Ct. at 741); accord, e.g., C.B. v. Driscoll, 82 F.3d 383, 386 (11th\nCir.1996) (\"The dictates of Goss are clear and extremely limited.\"). These \"rudimentary\nprecautions,\" to use the description from Goss itself, 419 U.S. at 581, 95 S.Ct. at 740, are a far\ncry from a due process tribunal hearing attendant to some property interest deprivations.\n\n                                                    30\n\f       If that suggested proposition were the law of this circuit—and thankfully it is not—no school\n\nofficial could ever discipline a student for any alleged misconduct as a result of another student's\n\ncomplaint without violating the due process rights of the disciplined student. The reason such an\n\nimposition of discipline would violate due process is that such an official would always have a\n\nfinancial incentive, under that view, to believe the complaint in order to avoid a lawsuit filed by the\n\ncomplainant. The ramifications of such a rule would extend to discipline for any type of\n\nmisconduct, because there is no principled basis on which a distinction can be drawn between\n\ndiscipline following a complaint about sexual harassment and that following a complaint about any\n\nother type of misconduct.\n\n       Nor is there any principled basis by which such an automatic disqualification rule could be\n\nconfined to school settings. It would also apply outside the Title IX context; for example, in jail\n\nand prison settings. If one prisoner complains to a jailer or warden about what some other prisoner\n\nhas done to him, under Judge Tjoflat's view that official will have a financial interest in avoiding a\n\nlawsuit from the complaining prisoner (alleging deliberate indifference), and such an interest\n\ndisqualifies the official from making any disciplinary decision about the complaint. So, not only\n\nwould the disqualification rule be automatic, it also would be universal. No one would be able to\n\ndecide any disciplinary matters in schools, in prisons, or in any other setting within the purview of\n\nthe Due Process Clause. All federal, state, or local officials called upon to decide what to do in\nresponse to one person's complaint about another would have a financial incentive to avoid a\n\nlawsuit, which would disqualify them from making a decision. That cannot be the law, and it is not\n\nthe law.\n\n       Judge Tjoflat's response to having these flaws in his reasoning pointed out is contained in\n\nfootnote 21 of his opinion, which will reward close scrutiny. First, that footnote assures us that we\n\nshould not worry about the far-reaching ramifications of the suggestion that potential liability equals\n\ndisqualifying bias, because this Court is holding that school officials have no liability under Title\n\nIX for student-student sexual harassment. Apparently forgotten is the assurance, in Part IV of the\n\n\n                                                  31\n\fopinion, that \"Georgia tort law may indeed provide redress\" for the very same conduct. If a school\n\nofficial's potential liability for not acting properly is a disqualifying financial interest, it matters not\n\nwhether that potential liability is posed by Title IX or by state tort law. The opinion does not, and\n\nlogically cannot, suggest otherwise. Instead, it adopts a head-in-the-sand approach which ignores\n\neverything but Title IX, as though that were the only potential source of liability for school officials\n\nwho are called upon to decide what to do about student-student sexual harassment complaints.\n\n        With its head comfortably in the sand, the opinion also ignores entirely the obvious\n\nimplications of its proposition for student-student disputes involving allegations of misbehavior\n\nother than sexual harassment. Part of the quotidian business of teachers and principals is resolving\n\ndisputes in which one student alleges another has threatened, hit, stolen from, or otherwise\n\nmistreated him or her. Some of those disputes pose potential liability for the teacher or principal\n\nwho fails to act. For example, a school official who fails to take appropriate action to protect a\n\nstudent from a threatened thrashing at the hands of another student may have to answer in a state\n\ncourt tort action. Under the reasoning contained in Part III B of the opinion, that potential liability\n\nwould prevent any school official from deciding what to do about such a complaint, because that\n\nofficial's potential liability to the complaining student would amount to a disqualifying financial\n\nbias. A careful reading of the opinion reveals that it fails to explain why that result would not\n\nnecessarily follow from its suggested reasoning.\n        As to settings outside the school context, footnote 21 of the opinion offers two responses to\n\nthis criticism. First, it simply denies—\"We suggest nothing of the kind\"—that its proposition about\n\npotential liability equaling disqualifying bias would have any application outside the schoolhouse.\n\nThat ipse dixit assertion has as little reasoning behind it as the proposition itself. The opinion fails\n\nto offer any reason why the automatic bias theory it suggests would not apply in non-school\n\ncontexts, because there is no reason. The right to an unbiased decision maker is a rudiment of due\n\nprocess, which is as applicable outside schools as within them.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    32\n\f        Apparently realizing that the ipse dixit approach will not shield the naked illogic of its\n\nposition from view, the opinion attempts to camouflage the problem with talk of immunity. \"Don't\n\nworry,\" we are told, officials in non-school settings have \"immunity from suit\" which removes any\n\npotential liability for failing to decide for the complaining party, and any financial incentive to favor\n\nthat party disappears along with the potential liability. The thinnest stripe of the attempted\n\ncamouflage is the opinion's reference to judicial immunity. We are not talking about judges. We\n\nare talking about the myriad of federal, state, and local non-judicial officials who are regularly called\n\nupon to decide what to do in response to one person's complaint about another. Jailers, wardens, and\n\nother corrections officials are but a few examples. These people are not judges. They do not enjoy\n\njudicial immunity.\n\n        Even so, the opinion says, there is qualified immunity. There are three problems with the\n\nassertion that the availability of qualified immunity distinguishes non-school officials from school\n\nofficials by removing any threat of lawsuit by a complaining party dissatisfied with an official's\n\nresolution of a complaint outside the school setting. First, qualified immunity is not absolute.\n\nSecond, qualified immunity does not shield officials from liability grounded on state law. Third,\n\nand most obviously, the doctrine of qualified immunity is the same for school officials as for\n\nnon-school officials. If that doctrine shields non-school officials from threat of lawsuit sufficiently\n\nto remove any disqualifying financial incentive to decide for a complainant, it does exactly the same\nfor school officials. Thus, with its talk of qualified immunity, Part III B of the opinion has\n\nsucceeded in reaching around and biting itself in the back. If what the plurality opinion says about\n\nthe due process implications of qualified immunity is true, then the opinion has disproven the very\n\nproposition it is seeking to defend.\n\n                                                   II.\n\n        Part III C of Judge Tjoflat's opinion attempts to establish that student-student sexual\n\nharassment is such a widespread and extensive problem that a different holding in this case would\n\nimpose massive liability upon school officials and boards. In its words, agreeing with appellant's\n\n\n                                                   33\n\ftheory of liability would give rise to \"thousands of lawsuits.\" Tjoflat Opinion at n.25. The factual\n\npremise of that reasoning is based entirely upon one survey report. See American Ass'n of Univ.\n\nWomen Educ. Found., Hostile Hallways: The AAUW Survey on Sexual Harassment in American\n\nSchools (1993) (hereinafter \"AAUW Survey Report \").\n\n        The AAUW Survey Report was not the subject of an evidentiary hearing in the district court,\n\nnor has it been examined in a hearing in any other court insofar as we know. Neither party to this\n\nappeal even mentioned the survey in the briefs; it was discussed only in one amicus brief. In\n\ngeneral, we should be reluctant to incorporate into our reasoning the results of a survey that has not\n\nbeen examined critically or tested in a trial or evidentiary hearing, the time-honored and proven\n\nmethods our system of justice uses to determine material facts.\n\n        Beyond the general problems with using surveys in judicial decision making, there are\n\nspecific reasons why employment of this particular survey for the purpose Judge Tjoflat uses it in\n\nPart III C of his opinion is ill-advised. That purpose, of course, is to show student-student sexual\n\nharassment is so rampant that if a cause of action existed for it the resulting flood of litigation would\n\ninundate our public school systems, or at least school officials would have a basis for fearing that\n\nresult—the basis being the survey.\n\n        The first reason we ought to be especially cautious about such a use of this particular survey\n\nis that its purported findings are, in the words of the sponsors of the survey: \"startling,\" and for\nsome \"the results will be surprising and shocking.\" Id. at 2. The reason for such descriptions is that\n\nit is difficult to believe that 65 percent of all eighth through eleventh grade students have been\n\nsexually harassed by other students, and that half of all female and male students in those grades are\n\nself-professed sexual harassers. We ought to be reluctant to accept as fact, or assume that school\n\nofficials would accept as fact, such \"surprising and shocking\" statistics based upon a single survey\n\nof only a tiny fraction of one percent of the total number of students in four grades.\n\n        Even a cursory look at the survey report gives more reason to be dubious about the opinion's\n\nuse of the report. The survey asked students how often \"[d]uring your whole school life\" has anyone\n\n\n                                                   34\n\f\"when you did not want them to\" done any of the following things, and it then provided a list of\n\nbehavior the survey defined as sexual harassment. See id. at 5. Some behavior on that list clearly\n\nconstitutes sexually harassing behavior of the most serious type. But included in the list is other\n\nbehavior that is less serious and far less likely to lead to complaints and litigation, which is what\n\nJudge Tjoflat uses the survey to predict (or posits that school boards will use it to predict). For\n\nexample, included in the survey's definitional list of sexual harassment was any instance in which\n\nanother student: \"Made sexual comments, jokes, gestures, or looks;\" or \"[s]pread sexual rumors\n\nabout you;\" or \"[s]aid you were gay or lesbian.\" Id. at 5. Remember that a single unwelcome\n\ninstance of such activity, during the student's entire school life, renders that student a victim of\n\nsexual harassment for purposes of the survey.\n\n       A student who has ever been looked at by another student in an unwelcome way perceived\n\nto be sexual is defined by the survey to be a sexual harassment victim. Any student ever called gay\n\nor lesbian is also a sexual harassment victim in the survey's view. Any time unwelcome rumors are\n\nspread about a student having any type of sexual activity (presumably including kissing) with\n\nanother student, those students are sexual harassment victims as the survey defines it. To take one\n\nfinal example of how the total incidence of \"sexual harassment\" reported overstates legally\n\nactionable incidents of sexual harassment, consider that the survey definition includes incidents in\n\nwhich someone \"[f]lashed or \"mooned' you.\" Id. At 5. Suppose that a student at a school function\n(which the survey defines to include school sporting events and field trips) \"moons\" all the students\n\nin attendance, or all those from a rival school. A single episode of that misbehavior—which is not\n\nnice and certainly should not occur, but has been known to happen—could make sexual harassment\n\nvictims, as the survey defines the term, out of scores or even hundreds of students. Yet, such an\n\nincident is extremely unlikely to result in litigation against the school.\n\n       It is also worthy of note that the survey asked students whether the behavior it defined as\n\nsexual harassment had happened to them \"[d]uring your whole school life.\" Id. at 5. Therefore, the\n\n\n\n\n                                                  35\n\f65 percent figure reflects those who have experienced that behavior at any time during any school\n\nyear of their life. It does not purport to be annual data.\n\n        Finally, Part III C of the opinion fails to point out that the survey also asked the students if\n\nany of them who had been sexually harassed, as that term was defined in the survey, had told a\n\nteacher about the experience. Only 7 percent of the sixty-five percent had. See AAUW Survey\n\nReport at 14. Whatever the reasons for not reporting such behavior to a teacher, the failure to do\n\nso in all but the rarest instances has obvious implications for the existence of causes of action against\n\nschools or the likelihood of actual litigation.\n\n        The opinion attempts to deflect criticism about misuse of the survey by suggesting that while\n\nthe opinion's author does not necessarily think that the survey is a valid indicator of how much\n\nstudent-student sexual harassment occurs, school boards might think that the survey is and reject\n\nfederal funding as a result of it. With all due respect, there is no reason to believe that school boards\n\nwould be less likely than federal judges to see the flaws in such an interpretation of the survey.\n\nSchool boards know more about what is going on in their schools than we do, and they can be\n\nexpected to critically examine any survey before using it as a basis for turning down federal funding\n\nfor their schools. Rather than hiding behind speculation about how school board officials might\n\ninterpret the survey, the opinion ought to face up to the flaws in its suggested use of the survey.\n\n        Upon its release, the sponsors of the survey stated that they were \"confident that the results\nof this survey will become a focal point on the agendas of policy makers, educators, and others\n\nconcerned with the education of America's children.\" Id. at 21. Their confidence about how the\n\nsurvey would be used might be undermined by Part III C of Judge Tjoflat's opinion. More\n\nimportantly, we are not policymakers. We do not have agendas. We ought to leave this survey to\n\nthose who do.\n\n                                                  III.\n\n        The parts of Judge Tjoflat's opinion that neither I nor any other member of the Court except\n\nits author joins, Parts III B and C, are not necessary to the opinion's essential reasoning or to the\n\n\n                                                   36\n\fholding of this case. Neither the language of Title IX nor its legislative history indicates that\n\nCongress intended to saddle school boards and officials with liability for student-student sexual\n\nharassment, and school boards had no notice that such liability would result from accepting Title IX\n\nfunds. For those reasons, I do join the holding of the Court and Parts I, II, III A, and IV of Judge\n\nTjoflat's opinion.\n\n      BARKETT, Circuit Judge, dissenting, in which HATCHETT, Chief Judge, and KRAVITCH\nand HENDERSON, Senior Circuit Judges, join:\n\n          In this case it is alleged that a fifth-grade student, Lashonda Davis, was sexually harassed\n\nfor over six months at school by another student, culminating in a sexual battery for which her\n\nharasser pled guilty in state court. It is also alleged that school officials were completely aware of\n\nthe escalating gravity of the situation and took no meaningful action to deter it. The majority holds\n\nthat no matter how egregious—or even criminal—the harassing discriminatory conduct may be, and\n\nno matter how cognizant of it supervisors may become—a teacher could observe it directly and\n\nregularly—there would be no obligation to take any action to prevent it under the very law which\n\nwas passed to eliminate sexual discrimination in our public schools. To reach this conclusion the\n\nmajority ignores the plain meaning of Title IX as well as its spirit and purpose. I suggest that under\n\nappropriate statutory analysis as well as Supreme Court precedent, Davis has stated a cause of\n\naction.\n\n          The first principle in statutory analysis requires that a statute be accorded the plain meaning\nof its text. It is well established that \"[c]ourts must assume that Congress intended the ordinary\n\nmeaning of the words it used, and absent a clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary, that\n\nlanguage is generally dispositive.\" Gonzalez v. McNary, 980 F.2d 1418, 1420 (11th Cir.1993)\n\n(internal citation omitted). The Supreme Court has emphasized that \"only the most extraordinary\n\nshowing of contrary intentions from [legislative history] would justify a limitation on the \"plain\n\nmeaning' of the statutory language.\" Garcia v. United States, 469 U.S. 70, 75, 105 S.Ct. 479, 482,\n\n83 L.Ed.2d 472 (1984). The text of Title IX provides in pertinent part:\n\n\n\n                                                    37\n\f        No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in,\n        be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or\n        activity receiving Federal financial assistance....\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). There is no ambiguity in this language. It is undisputed that the Monroe\n\nCounty School System is a recipient of federal financial assistance. It is also well established that\n\nhostile environment sexual harassment is a form of intentional discrimination which exposes one\n\nsex to disadvantageous terms or conditions to which members of the other sex are not exposed. See\n\nMeritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 64, 106 S.Ct. 2399, 2404, 91 L.Ed.2d 49 (1986);\n\nsee also Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U.S. 60, 75, 112 S.Ct. 1028, 1037-38, 117\n\nL.Ed.2d 208 (1992) (hostile environment for student created by teacher is a form of discrimination\n\ncognizable under Title IX). The absolute prohibition contained in the text is framed solely in terms\n\nof who is protected. The identity of the perpetrator is simply irrelevant under the language: \"No\n\nperson ... shall ... be excluded from participation ..., be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to\n\ndiscrimination....\" Thus, under the statute's plain language, liability hinges upon whether the grant\n\nrecipient maintained an educational environment that excluded any person from participating, denied\n\nthem benefits, or subjected them to discrimination.\n\n        Should one need to interpret the statute, it must initially be noted that Title IX was designed\n\nto protect individuals from sex discrimination by denying federal financial aid to those educational\n\ninstitutions that bear responsibility for sexually discriminatory practices. Cannon v. University of\nChicago, 441 U.S. 677, 704 & n. 36, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 1961 & n. 36, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (citing 117\n\nCong. Rec. 39252 (1971)). \"It is a strong and comprehensive measure which ... is needed if we are\n\nto provide women with solid legal protection as they seek education and training for later careers....\"\n\nId. at 704 n. 36, 99 S.Ct. at 1961 n. 36 (quoting Sen. Birch Bayh, 118 Cong. Rec. 5806-07 (1972)).\n\nThus, in interpreting Title IX, \"[t]here is no doubt that if we are to give [it] the scope that its origins\n\ndictate, we must accord it a sweep as broad as its language.\" North Haven Bd. of Educ. v. Bell, 456\n\nU.S. 512, 521, 102 S.Ct. 1912, 1918, 72 L.Ed.2d 299 (1982) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                                    38\n\f       Moreover, the Office of Civil Rights of the Department of Education, the federal agency\n\nresponsible for enforcement of Title IX, interprets the statutory language to impose liability on\n\nschool officials for permitting an educational environment of severe, persistent, or pervasive peer\n\nsexual harassment when they know or should know about it, and fail to take immediate and\n\nappropriate corrective action to remedy it. See Sexual Harassment Guidance: Harassment of\n\nStudents by School Employees, Other Students, or Third Parties, 62 Fed.Reg. 12,034, at 12,039-41\n\n(1997). The OCR's final policy guidance explains that:\n\n       a school's failure to respond to the existence of a hostile environment within its own\n       programs or activities permits an atmosphere of sexual discrimination to permeate the\n       educational program and results in discrimination prohibited by Title IX.... Thus, Title IX\n       does not make a school responsible for the actions of harassing students, but rather for its\n       own discrimination in failing to remedy it once the school has notice.\n\nId. at 12,039-40 (emphasis added).1\n\n   1\n    It is worth noting that the OCR's interpretation of Title IX as holding schools liable for\npermitting peer sexual harassment is consistent with its interpretation of Title VI of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d (1964), as holding schools liable for allowing peer racial\nharassment. This is significant because the Supreme Court has noted that \"Title IX was\npatterned after Title VI.\" Cannon, 441 U.S. at 694, 99 S.Ct. at 1956. As the majority points out,\nthe language of the two statutes is virtually identical, and the Supreme Court has held that they\nshould be interpreted in the same way. See Majority Op. at 3362-63 (citing Cannon, 441 U.S. at\n696, 99 S.Ct. at 1957-58). The OCR issued An Investigative Guidance on Racial Incidents and\nHarassment Against Students at Educational Institutions in 1994 providing, \"[T]he existence of a\nracially hostile environment that is created, encouraged, accepted, tolerated or left uncorrected\nby a recipient also constitutes different treatment on the basis of race in violation of Title VI.\"\nSee 59 Fed.Reg. 11,448, at 11,448 (1994). Furthermore, the OCR has stated that the obligation\nof school districts with notice to remedy racially hostile environments applies \"regardless of the\nidentity of the person(s) committing the harassment—a teacher, student, the grounds crew, a\ncafeteria worker, neighborhood teenagers, a visiting baseball team, a guest speaker, parents or\nothers.\" Id. at 11,450. As explained by the OCR:\n\n               Under this analysis, an alleged harasser need not be an agent or employee of the\n               recipient, because this theory of liability under Title VI is premised on a\n               recipient's general duty to provide a nondiscriminatory educational environment.\n\n       Id. at 11,449.\n\n                Additionally, it is interesting to note that shortly after the enactment of Title VI,\n       the former Fifth Circuit recognized that school officials must take steps within their\n       power to prevent racial harassment among students. In United States v. Jefferson County\n       Bd. of Educ., 380 F.2d 385 (5th Cir.1967) (en banc), which is binding precedent in this\n       circuit, see Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc),\n       the court of appeals entered a model desegregation decree which complied with \"the\n\n                                                 39\n\f       Notwithstanding the administrative interpretation of the statute, as well as its plain meaning,\n\nthe majority concludes that Congress did not intend to create a cause of action under Title IX for\n\nstudent-on-student sexual harassment based largely on an analysis of legislative history. The\n\nmajority emphasizes that \"throughout this long legislative history, the drafters of Title IX never\n\ndiscussed student-student sexual harassment....\" See Majority Op. at 3360. Assuming this to be\n\ntrue, the mere fact that student-on-student sexual harassment may not have been specifically\n\nmentioned in the Congressional debates does not mean that it was not encompassed within\n\nCongress's broad intent of preventing students from being \"subjected to discrimination\" in federally\n\nfunded educational programs. The majority suggests that it is clear that Congress was not concerned\n\nwith student-on-student sexual harassment because the legislative history focused primarily on the\n\nissues of discrimination in \"admission[s],\" \"available services or studies,\" and \"employment within\n\nan institution,\" none of which were pertinent to the claim raised in this case. See Majority Op. at\n\n3358-59, 3360. However, under this narrow view, even the cause of action under Title IX for\n\nteacher-on-student sexual harassment recognized by the Supreme Court in Franklin, 503 U.S. at 60,\n\n112 S.Ct. at 1028-29, would not be supported by the majority's view of legislative history. In\n\nFranklin the Court considered a high-school student's Title IX suit alleging that a teacher had\n\nsexually harassed and assaulted her and that school officials, who had knowledge of the misconduct,\n\nhad failed to intervene. Id. at 63-64, 112 S.Ct. at 1031-32. Surely the majority would not suggest\n\nthat the cause of action that the Supreme Court recognized in Franklin does not exist simply because\n\nit was not specifically mentioned in the legislative history. Moreover, the majority's interpretation\n\n\n       letter and spirit of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\", Jefferson County, 380 F.2d at 390. The\n       decree provided in relevant part:\n\n               Within their authority school officials are responsible for the protection of\n               persons exercising rights under or otherwise affected by this decree. They shall,\n               without delay, take appropriate action with regard to any student or staff member\n               who interferes with the successful operation of the plan. Such interference shall\n               include harassment, intimidation, threats, hostile words or acts, and similar\n               behavior.\n\n       Id. at 392.\n\n                                                 40\n\fof the statute based on legislative history would suggest that by using the unqualified words\n\n\"discrimination under any education program\" Congress only intended to cover the narrow areas of\n\nadmissions, services, and employment. This contravenes both common sense and the plain meaning\n\nof the words of the statute.\n\n        Furthermore, the majority contends that Title IX may not be construed as authorizing a cause\n\nof action for a school board's failure to remedy student-on-student sexual harassment because such\n\nan interpretation would conflict with the notice of liability requirement of the Spending Clause,\n\nwhich is the constitutional provision under which Title IX was ostensibly enacted.2 See Majority\n\nOp. at 3362, 3364-65 (citing Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17, 101\n\nS.Ct. 1531, 1539-40, 67 L.Ed.2d 694 (1981)). However, it is clear that the school board would have\n\nsufficient notice of liability based on the plain meaning of the statute, which unequivocally imposes\n\nliability on grant recipients for maintaining an educational environment in which students are\n\nsubjected to discrimination. Further, sufficient notice was provided to satisfy the Spending Clause\n\nprerequisite for a damages action under Title IX as set forth in Franklin, 503 U.S. at 74-75, 112\n\nS.Ct. at 1037-38. In Franklin the Court explained that the notice requirement for damages actions\n\nunder the Spending Clause in Title IX cases is satisfied where the alleged violation was intentional.\n\nId. The Court found that since sexual harassment constitutes intentional discrimination in violation\n\nof Title IX, the Spending Clause does not prohibit a cause of action for teacher-on-student sexual\n\nharassment under Title IX. Id. Similarly, in this case the alleged violation of Title IX was intentional\n\nbecause the school board knowingly permitted a student to be subjected to a hostile environment of\n\nsexual harassment. See, e.g., Doe v. Petaluma City Sch. Dist., 949 F.Supp. 1415, 1422, 1427\n\n(N.D.Cal.1996) (holding that hostile environment sexual harassment constitutes \"intentional\n\ndiscrimination,\" and that schools are liable under Title IX when they know or should know about\n\n   2\n    In Franklin, the Supreme Court assumed, without deciding, that Title IX was enacted\npursuant to the Spending Clause. Franklin, 503 U.S. at 75 & n. 8, 112 S.Ct. at 1037 & n. 8. It is\nalso arguable that the provision was enacted pursuant to § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. For\npurposes of this discussion, I will assume, like the majority, that the authorizing provision was\nthe Spending Clause.\n\n                                                  41\n\fstudent-on-student sexual harassment and fail to take prompt remedial action); Bruneau v. South\n\nKortright Central Sch. Dist., 935 F.Supp. 162, 172 (N.D.N.Y.1996) (recognizing that a school's\n\nfailure to take corrective action in response to hostile environment created by peers despite actual\n\nnotice of harassment subjects it to liability for intentional discrimination, and therefore to damages\n\nunder Title IX); Burrow v. Postville Community Sch. Dist., 929 F.Supp. 1193, 1205 (N.D.Iowa\n\n1996) (holding that intentional discrimination may be inferred from \"the totality of relevant\n\nevidence, including evidence of the school's failure to prevent or stop the sexual harassment despite\n\nactual knowledge of the sexually harassing behavior of students over whom the school exercised\n\nsome degree of control\"); Oona R.-S. v. Santa Rosa City Schs., 890 F.Supp. 1452, 1464, 1469\n\n(N.D.Cal.1995) (explaining that discriminatory intent can be found in \"the toleration of harassing\n\nbehavior of male students, or the failure to take adequate steps to deter or punish peer harassment\");\n\nsee also Canutillo Independent School Dist. v. Leija, 101 F.3d 393, 406 (5th Cir.1996), cert. denied,\n\n--- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 2434, 138 L.Ed.2d 195 (1997) (noting that \"when the Supreme Court referred\n\nto \"intentional discrimination' in Franklin, it was referring to any form of discrimination other than\n\ndisparate impact discrimination.\").\n\n        Finding that Title IX authorizes a cause of action for student-on-student sexual harassment,\n\nwe should then follow the lead of other courts, including the Supreme Court, in turning to Title VII\n\nprinciples to delineate the scope of the school board's duty and identify the elements of a cause of\n\naction under Title IX. In relevant part, Title VII requires an employer to take steps to assure that the\n\nworking environment of its employees is free from sexual harassment3 that is \"sufficiently severe\n\nor pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working\n\n\n\n   3\n    Sexual harassment involves unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and\nother unwelcome verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. 29 C.F.R. § 1604.11(a) (1991).\nSuch harassment constitutes actionable sex discrimination in the workplace either as \"quid pro\nquo\" sexual harassment, which conditions employment benefits upon sexual favors, or as\n\"hostile environment\" sexual harassment, which creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive\nworking environment that unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance. See\nMeritor 477 U.S. at 62, 65, 106 S.Ct. at 2403, 2404-05.\n\n                                                  42\n\fenvironment.\" Meritor, 477 U.S. at 67, 106 S.Ct. at 2405 (internal quotation marks and brackets\n\nomitted).\n\n       It is appropriate to turn to Title VII because the Supreme Court has explicitly relied on Title\n\nVII principles in explaining that sexual harassment constitutes intentional \"discrimination\" under\n\nTitle IX:\n\n       Unquestionably, Title IX placed on the Gwinnett County Public Schools the duty not to\n       discriminate on the basis of sex, and \"when a supervisor sexually harasses a subordinate\n       because of the subordinate's sex, that supervisor \"discriminate[s]' on the basis of sex.\"\n       Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 64 [106 S.Ct. 2399, 2402, 91 L.Ed.2d 49]\n       (1986). We believe the same rule should apply when a teacher sexually harasses and abuses\n       a student. Congress surely did not intend for federal moneys to be expended to support the\n       intentional actions it sought by statute to proscribe.\n\nFranklin, 503 U.S. at 74-75, 112 S.Ct. at 1037. Significantly, the Court relied on Meritor, a Title\n\nVII case, to resolve the issue.\n\n       A well established line of cases preceded the Supreme Court's decision to use Title VII\n\nprinciples in resolving a Title IX case. Prior to Franklin, courts had held that such principles are\n\napplicable in Title IX suits brought by employees of educational institutions. See, e.g., Lipsett v.\n\nUniversity of Puerto Rico, 864 F.2d 881, 897 (1st Cir.1988) (Title IX's legislative history \"strongly\n\nsuggests that Congress meant for similar substantive standards to apply under Title IX as had been\n\ndeveloped under Title VII.\"); see also Preston v. Commonwealth of Virginia ex rel. New River\n\nCommunity College, 31 F.3d 203, 207 (4th Cir.1994); Mabry v. State Bd. of Comm. Coll. & Occup.\nEduc., 813 F.2d 311, 316 n. 6 (10th Cir.1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 849, 108 S.Ct. 148, 98 L.Ed.2d\n\n104 (1987). Courts had also relied on Title VII when evaluating Title IX sexual harassment claims\n\nby students. See, e.g., Moire v. Temple Univ. Sch. of Medicine, 613 F.Supp. 1360, 1366 & n. 2\n\n(E.D.Pa.1985), aff'd, 800 F.2d 1136 (3d Cir.1986) (hostile environment sexual harassment);\n\nAlexander v.

See Oona, R.___S.___, pgs. *4-*6, --- F.3d at ---- -\n\n----. See, e.g., Bruneau, 935 F.Supp. at 172 (\"When an employer fails to act to remedy a hostile\n\nenvironment created by co-workers the employer discriminates against an individual in violation of\nTitle VII. Similarly, [this] Court finds that in the Title IX context, when an educational institution\n\nfails to take steps to remedy peer-on-peer sexual harassment, it should be held liable to the harassed\n\nstudent for that discriminatory conduct.\"); Bosley v.

Thus, the applicable case law firmly supports applying Title\n\nVII principles to delineate the scope of a school board's liability under Title IX for failure to remedy\n\nstudent-on-student sexual harassment.\n\n        Notwithstanding this abundant support for applying Title VII principles, the majority\n\ncontends that Title VII principles may not be applied in this case because \"the exposition of liability\n\nunder Title VII depends upon agency principles.\" See Majority Op. at 3363 n. 13. The majority\n\nasserts that \"[a]gency principles are useless in discussing liability for student-student harassment\n\nunder Title IX, because students are not agents of the school board.\"4 Id. This argument overlooks\n\nthe Supreme Court's caveat in Meritor that \"common law principles [of agency] may not be\n\ntransferable in all their particulars to Title VII.\" Meritor, 477 U.S. at 72, 106 S.Ct. at 2408 (emphasis\n\nadded).5 Under Meritor 's flexible approach, courts have held that an employer may be held liable\n\n   4\n    The majority also argues that Title VII case law is inapplicable to Title IX because Title IX,\nunlike Title VII, was enacted under the Spending Clause. However, the Supreme Court has\nrelied on Title VII in analyzing claims under Title VI, which also was enacted under the\nspending power. In Guardians Ass'n v. Civil Service Comm'n, 463 U.S. 582, 103 S.Ct. 3221, 77\nL.Ed.2d 866 (1983), for example, the Court found that Title VI's prohibition of discrimination\nwas \"subject to the construction given the antidiscrimination proscription of Title VII in Griggs\nv. Duke Power Co. ....\" Guardians, 463 U.S. at 592, 103 S.Ct. at 3227. The Court also adopted\nTitle VII's \"business necessity\" defense to analyze disparate impact claims in a Title VI case\ninvolving student placement. See Board of Educ. v. Harris, 444 U.S. 130, 151, 100 S.Ct. 363,\n375, 62 L.Ed.2d 275 (1979). Likewise, this court has utilized Title VII to analyze a disparate\nimpact claim under Title VI, stating that \"[t]he elements of a disparate impact claim may be\ngleaned by reference to cases decided under Title VII.\" Georgia State Conf. of Branches of\nNAACP v. Georgia, 775 F.2d 1403, 1417 (11th Cir.1985). Thus, the fact that Title VII is not a\nSpending Clause statute has not been a bar to importing its standards into Title VI, which formed\nthe template for Title IX, and therefore should not be a bar to importing its standards into Title\nIX.\n   5\n    As Judge Tjoflat has explained, \"Title VII, as interpreted in Meritor, requires employers to\ntake steps to ensure that sexual harassment does not permeate the workplace. To the extent that\nthe application of common law agency principles frustrates Title VII's goal of eliminating such\nharassment—by effectively relieving the employer of the responsibility of pursuing that\n\n                                                   45\n\funder Title VII for failing to take action to remedy a hostile environment created by non-employees,\n\nwho are certainly not agents of the employer. See, e.g., Powell v. Las Vegas Hilton Corp., 841\n\nF.Supp. 1024, 1028 (D.Nev.1992) (denying motion to dismiss blackjack dealer's claim that her\n\nemployer violated Title VII by failing to protect her from sexual harassment by gamblers at her\n\ntable, because \"an employer could be liable for the sexual harassment of employees by\n\nnon-employees, including its customers\"); Magnuson v. Peak Technical Services, Inc., 808 F.Supp.\n\n500, 512-13 (E.D.Va.1992) (holding that employers of alleged victim can be held liable for failing\n\nto take corrective action to remedy hostile environment created by non-employee); see also Henson\n\nv. City of Dundee, 682 F.2d 897, 910 (11th Cir.1982) (\"The environment in which an employee\n\nworks can be rendered offensive in an equal degree by the acts of supervisors, coworkers, or even\n\nstrangers to the workplace.\") (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted).6 The employers were\n\nheld liable in these cases by virtue of their own failure to comply with the duty of eliminating\n\ndiscrimination under Title VII—not under any theory of vicarious liability for the acts of a third\n\nparty.\n\n         Application of Title VII principles also recognizes that a student should have the same\n\nprotection in school that an employee has in the workplace.7 See Franklin, 503 U.S. at 74-75, 112\n\n\ngoal—those principles must yield.\" Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 111 F.3d 1530, 1544, 1546\nn. 2 (11th Cir.1997) (Tjoflat, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part).\n   6\n    Moreover, guidelines promulgated under Title VII recognize that an employer may be held\nliable for failing to take corrective action to remedy a hostile environment created by a third\nparty. See 29 C.F.R. § 1604.11(e) (\"An employer may also be responsible for the acts of\nnon-employees in the workplace ..., where the employer (or its agents or supervisory employees)\nknows or should have known of the conduct and fails to take immediate and appropriate\ncorrective action.\").\n   7\n    Indeed, where there are distinctions between the school environment and the workplace, they\n\"serve only to emphasize the need for zealous protection against sex discrimination in the\nschools.\" Patricia H., 830 F.Supp. at 1292-93. The ability to control and influence behavior\nexists to an even greater extent in the classroom than in the workplace, as students look to their\nteachers for guidance as well as for protection. The damage caused by sexual harassment also is\narguably greater in the classroom than in the workplace, because the harassment has a greater\nand longer lasting impact on its young victims, and institutionalizes sexual harassment as\naccepted behavior. Moreover, \"[a] nondiscriminatory environment is essential to maximum\nintellectual growth and is therefore an integral part of the educational benefits that a student\n\n                                                46\n\fS.Ct. at 1037-38. Just as a working woman should not be required to \"run a gauntlet of sexual abuse\n\nin return for the privilege of being allowed to work and make a living,\" Meritor, 477 U.S. at 67, 106\n\nS.Ct. at 2405 (internal citation omitted), a female student should not be required to run a gauntlet\n\nof sexual abuse in return for the privilege of being allowed to obtain an education. In the\n\nemployment context, women historically have not had the power to simply walk away from an\n\nenvironment that is made to be demeaning, embarrassing, and humiliating for them because of their\n\ngender. Similarly, it is virtually impossible for female students to leave their assigned schools to\n\nescape an environment where they are harassed and intimidated on the basis of their gender. Just\n\nas in the employment setting where employees are dependent on their employers to ensure\n\nworkplace equality, so too students are dependent on teachers and school officials to control the\n\neducational environment. Additionally, sexual harassment—regardless of its source—subordinates\n\ngirls in the classroom just as much as in the workforce. Although a hostile environment can be\n\ncreated by someone who supervises or otherwise has power over the victim, a hostile environment\n\ncan also be created by co-workers or fellow students who have no direct power relationship\n\nwhatsoever with the victim.8 And like Title VII, Title IX was enacted to remedy that discrimination\n\nand ensure sexual equality in public education.\n\n       Having determined that Title VII principles should guide our analysis of the scope of the\n\nschool board's liability under Title IX, I conclude that Davis's allegations sufficiently plead a cause\n\n\nreceives. A sexually abusive environment inhibits, if not prevents, the harassed student from\ndeveloping her full intellectual potential and receiving the most from the academic program.\" Id.\nat 1293 (citation omitted).\n   8\n    Numerous circuit courts, including this one, have held that an employer's failure to take\nprompt remedial action after notice of severe and pervasive sexual harassment by a co-worker is\nactionable. See, e.g., Henson v. City of Dundee, 682 F.2d 897, 905 (11th Cir.1982); see also\nDeAngelis v. El Paso Municipal Police Officers Assoc., 51 F.3d 591, 593 (5th Cir.1995);\nNichols v. Frank, 42 F.3d 503, 508 (9th Cir.1994); Carr v. Allison Gas Turbine Div. Gen.\nMotors Corp., 32 F.3d 1007, 1009 (7th Cir.1994); Karibian v. Columbia University, 14 F.3d\n773, 779 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 512 U.S. 1213, 114 S.Ct. 2693, 129 L.Ed.2d 824 (1994);\nKauffman v. Allied Signal, Inc., Autolite Div., 970 F.2d 178, 182 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 506\nU.S. 1041, 113 S.Ct. 831, 121 L.Ed.2d 701 (1992); Baker v. Weyerhaeuser Co., 903 F.2d 1342,\n1345-46 (10th Cir.1990); Hall v. Gus Construction Co., 842 F.2d 1010, 1015-16 (8th Cir.1988).\n\n                                                  47\n\fof action. The elements a plaintiff must prove to succeed in this type of sexual harassment case are:\n\n(1) that she is a member of a protected group; (2) that she was subject to unwelcome sexual\n\nharassment; (3) that the harassment was based on sex; (4) that the harassment was sufficiently\n\nsevere or pervasive so as to alter the conditions of her education and create an abusive educational\n\nenvironment; and (5) that some basis for institutional liability has been established. See Meritor,\n\n477 U.S. at 66-73, 106 S.Ct. at 2405-09; see also Harris v. Forklift Sys. Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 20-24,\n\n114 S.Ct. 367, 370-71, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993); Lipsett, 864 F.2d at 898-902; Henson, 682 F.2d\n\nat 903-05.\n\n       Assumed as true, the facts alleged in the complaint, together with all reasonable inferences\n\ntherefrom, satisfy these elements. There is no question that the allegations satisfy the first three\n\nrequirements. First, as a female, LaShonda is a member of a protected group. Second, she was\n\nsubject to unwelcome sexual harassment in the form of \"verbal and physical conduct of a sexual\n\nnature.\" 29 C.F.R. § 1604.11(a). Third, the harassment LaShonda faced clearly was on the basis\n\nof her sex.\n\n       As to the fourth requirement, I recognize that a hostile environment in an educational setting\n\nis not created by simple childish behavior or by an offensive utterance, comment, or vulgarity.\n\nRather, Title IX is violated \"[w]hen the [educational environment] is permeated with \"discriminatory\n\nintimidation, ridicule, and insult' that is \"sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of\nthe victim's [environment] and create an abusive environment,' \" Harris, 114 S.Ct. at 370, 510 U.S.\n\nat 21 (quoting Meritor, 477 U.S. at 65, 67, 106 S.Ct. at 2405-06) (internal citations omitted). In\n\ndetermining whether a plaintiff has established that an environment is hostile or abusive, a court\n\nmust be particularly concerned with (1) the frequency of the abusive conduct; (2) the conduct's\n\nseverity; (3) whether it is physically threatening or humiliating rather than merely offensive; and\n\n(4) whether it unreasonably interferes with the plaintiff's performance. Harris, 444 U.S. at 142-44,\n\n100 S.Ct. at 371. The Court has explained that these factors must be viewed both objectively and\n\nsubjectively. If the conduct is not so severe or pervasive that a reasonable person would find it\n\n\n                                                  48\n\fhostile or abusive, it is beyond Title IX's purview. Similarly, if the plaintiff does not subjectively\n\nperceive the environment to be abusive, then the conduct has not actually altered the conditions of\n\nher learning environment, and there is no Title IX violation. Id., 444 U.S. at 141-42, 100 S.Ct. at\n\n370.\n\n        In this case, the five months of alleged harassment was sufficiently severe and pervasive to\n\nhave altered the conditions of LaShonda's learning environment from both an objective and a\n\nsubjective standpoint: (1) G.F. engaged in abusive conduct toward LaShonda on at least eight\n\noccasions; (2) the conduct was sufficiently severe to result in criminal charges against G.F. to which\n\nhe pled guilty in state court; (3) the conduct, such as the groping and requests for sex, was\n\nphysically threatening and humiliating rather than merely offensive;            and (4) the conduct\n\nunreasonably interfered with LaShonda's academic performance, resulting in the substantial\n\ndeterioration of her grades and emotional health. The facts alleged go far beyond simple horseplay,\n\nchildish vulgarities, or adolescent flirting.\n\n        Finally, I believe that the fifth and final element—whether any basis for the Board's liability\n\nhas been shown, has likewise been sufficiently alleged. Under Title VII, an employer may be held\n\nliable for a hostile environment of sexual harassment created by a co-worker if \"the employer knew\n\nor should have known of the harassment in question and failed to take prompt remedial action.\"\n\nFaragher, 111 F.3d at 1538; Henson, 682 F.2d at 905; see also Meritor, 477 U.S. at 72-73, 106\nS.Ct. at 2408-09. By analogy, in this instance the school board may be held liable if it knew or\n\nshould have known of the harassment and failed to take timely remedial action. In Title VII cases,\n\nan employee can demonstrate that the employer knew of the harassment \"by showing that she\n\ncomplained to higher management of the harassment or by showing the pervasiveness of the\n\nharassment, which gives rise to the inference of knowledge or constructive knowledge.\" Henson,\n\n682 F.2d at 905. (citation omitted). In this case, Davis has alleged that she told the principal—a\n\nhigher level manager—of the harassment on several occasions. She also alleged that at least three\n\nseparate teachers, in addition to the principal, had actual and repetitive knowledge from LaShonda,\n\n\n                                                  49\n\fher mother and other students. Finally, Davis alleged that despite this knowledge, the school\n\nofficials failed to take prompt remedial action to end the harassment.9 These allegations regarding\n\ninstitutional liability, as well as the other allegations, are sufficient to establish a prima facie claim\n\nunder Title IX for sexual discrimination due to the Board's failure to take action to remedy a\n\nsexually hostile environment.\n\n        For all the foregoing reasons, I would reverse the district court's dismissal of Davis's Title\n\nIX claim against the Board.\n\n\n\n\n   9\n    The complaint also alleged that during the time of the harassment, the Board had no policy\nprohibiting the sexual harassment of students in its schools, and had not provided any policies or\ntraining to its employees on how to respond to student-on-student sexual harassment.\n\n                                                   50\n\f",

The complaint alleged that the defendants violated Section 901\n\nof the Education Amendments of 1972, Pub.L. No. 92-318, 86 Stat. 235, 373 (1972) (codified as\n\namended at 20 U.S.C. § 1681 (1994)) (\"Title IX\"), and 42 U.S.C. § 19831 by failing to prevent a\n\nstudent at Hubbard Elementary School (\"Hubbard\") from sexually harassing LaShonda while she\n\nwas a student there.

Appellant appealed the district court's\n\ndismissal of her Title IX claim against the Board,3 arguing that a school board can be held liable\n\nunder Title IX for its failure to prevent sexual harassment among students. On appeal, a divided\n\nthree-judge panel reinstated her Title IX claim against the Board. See Davis v. Monroe County Bd.\n\n\n\n   2\n    Davis actually alleged that the named defendants discriminated on the basis of race in\nviolation of \"the Education Act of 1972 and the Civil Rights Act of 1991.\" Davis was apparently\nreferring to the Education Amendments of 1972, Pub.L. No. 92-318, 86 Stat. 235 (1972), and the\nCivil Rights Act of 1991, Pub.L. No. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1071 (1991). The former act, however,\ndoes not address racial discrimination in education, and the latter act does not provide a cause of\naction for racial discrimination in education. The district court construed this portion of the\ncomplaint to allege a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981, which does provide a cause of action against\ncertain types of racial discrimination.\n   3\n    Davis did not appeal the district court's dismissal of her Title IX claim with regard to\nindividual defendants Dumas and Querry. Davis similarly did not appeal the district court's\ndismissal of her § 1981 claim. Therefore, we do not consider these claims.\n\n              With regard to Davis' § 1983 claim, the complaint seemed to allege that the\n       defendants were liable under this provision solely because they violated Title IX. Davis,\n       however, apparently argued before the district court that the defendants were liable under\n       § 1983 for infringing LaShonda's rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\n       Amendment to the United States Constitution. The district court dismissed this implied\n       claim under Rule 12(b)(6). See Aurelia D., 862 F.Supp. at 366.\n\n               Davis did not appeal the dismissal of her § 1983 claim to the extent it was based\n       on the defendants' alleged violation of Title IX. Accordingly, that claim is not before us.\n       She did, however, appeal the dismissal of her § 1983 claim to the extent it was based on\n       the defendants' alleged violation of the Due Process Clause. In addition, Davis argued\n       for the first time before the three-judge panel that the same § 1983 claim encompassed a\n       violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n               The panel rejected Davis' due-process and equal-protection arguments and\n       affirmed the dismissal of her steadily expanding § 1983 claim under 11th Cir.

We begin by describing the allegations contained in appellant's complaint.\n\n                                                  B.\n\n       LaShonda Davis was enrolled as a fifth-grade student at Hubbard during the 1992-1993\n\nschool year. During that school year, Bill Querry was the principal of Hubbard, and Diane Fort,\n\nJoyce Pippin, and Whit Maples were teachers at the school. The complaint alleges that the Board\n\nadministered federally funded educational programs at Hubbard and supervised the school's\n\nemployees, including Principal Querry and Teachers Fort, Pippin, and Maples.\n\n       According to the complaint, a fifth-grade student named \"G.F.\" was in several of LaShonda's\n\nclasses and initially was assigned to the seat next to LaShonda in Fort's classroom. On December\n\n17, 1992, while in Fort's classroom, G.F. allegedly tried to touch LaShonda's breasts and vaginal\n\narea. G.F. also allegedly directed vulgarities at LaShonda, such as \"I want to get in bed with you\"\n\nand \"I want to feel your boobs.\" LaShonda complained to Fort. After school that day, LaShonda\n\nalso told her mother, the appellant, about G.F.'s behavior. The complaint states that G.F. engaged\n\n\n   4\n    See Davis v.

Granting rehearing\nen banc vacated the panel opinion by operation of law. 11th Cir. R. 35-11.\n\n                                                   3\n\fin similar (although unspecified) conduct on or about January 4, 1993,5 and again on January 20,\n\n1993. LaShonda allegedly reported both incidents to Fort and to appellant. After one of these first\n\nthree incidents, appellant called Fort, who told appellant in the course of their conversation that\n\nPrincipal Querry knew about one of the incidents.\n\n       G.F.'s misconduct continued. On February 3, 1993, G.F. allegedly placed a door-stop in his\n\npants and behaved in a sexually suggestive manner toward LaShonda during their physical education\n\nclass. LaShonda reported this incident to Maples, who was the physical education teacher. On\n\nFebruary 10, 1993, G.F. engaged in unspecified conduct similar to that of the December 17 incident\n\nin the classroom of Pippin, another of LaShonda's teachers. LaShonda notified Pippin of G.F.'s\n\nbehavior and later told appellant, who then called Pippin to discuss the incident. On March 1, 1993,\n\nG.F. directed more unspecified, offensive conduct toward LaShonda during physical education class.\n\nLaShonda reported G.F. to Maples and Pippin. An unidentified teacher allegedly told LaShonda that\n\nPrincipal Querry was not ready to listen to her complaint about G.F.\n\n       At some point around March 17, 1993, Fort allowed LaShonda to change assigned seats\n\naway from G.F. G.F., however, persisted in his unwelcome attentions. On April 12, 1993, he rubbed\n\nhis body against LaShonda in a manner she considered sexually suggestive; this incident occurred\n\nin the hallway on the way to lunch. LaShonda again complained to Fort.\n\n       Lastly, on May 19, 1993, LaShonda complained to appellant after school about more\n\nunspecified behavior by G.F. Appellant and LaShonda then paid a visit to Principal Querry to\n\ndiscuss G.F.'s conduct. At this meeting, Querry asked LaShonda why no other students had\n\ncomplained about G.F. During this meeting, Querry also told appellant, \"I guess I'll have to threaten\n\n[G.F.] a little bit harder.\" On the same day, May 19, G.F. was charged with sexual battery, a charge\n\nwhich he apparently did not deny. The complaint does not tell us who summoned the police.\n\n   5\n    The complaint actually alleges that this second instance of harassment occurred \"on or about\nJanuary 2, 1993.\" We note that January 2, 1993 was a Saturday. Presumably, there was no\nschool on Saturday, so G.F. could not have sexually harassed LaShonda at Hubbard on that day.\nFriday, January 1, 1993, was a holiday. Accordingly, we assume for appellant's benefit that the\nalleged harassment occurred on or about January 4, 1993.\n\n                                                 4\n\f       In all, the complaint describes eight separate instances of sexual harassment by G.F. These\n\neight instances of alleged harassment occurred, on average, once every twenty-two days over a\n\nsix-month period. Three instances occurred in Fort's classroom; two occurred in Maples' physical\n\neducation class; one occurred in Pippin's classroom; one occurred in a school hallway; and one\n\noccurred in an unspecified location. LaShonda reported four instances of alleged harassment to Fort,\n\ntwo to Maples, and two to Pippin. LaShonda reported the final instance of harassment, the May 19\n\nincident, to appellant and Querry. The complaint does not allege that any faculty member knew of\n\nmore than four instances of harassment, and the complaint indicates that Principal Querry learned\n\nof only one instance of harassment before his meeting with appellant and LaShonda on May 19.\n\n       The complaint does not state what action each of the teachers took upon being informed by\n\nLaShonda of G.F.'s demeaning conduct. We assume for appellant's benefit that the teachers took\n\nno action other than Fort's apparent notification of Principal Querry after one of the first three\n\ninstances of alleged harassment and Fort's decision around March 17, 1993, to move LaShonda's\n\nassigned seat away from that of G.F. We will also accept as true that Principal Querry took no\n\nmeasures against G.F. other than threatening him with disciplinary action at some point before his\n\nMay 19 meeting with appellant and her daughter. For example, we assume for appellant's benefit\n\nthat someone other than the school staff instigated the prosecution of G.F.\n\n       Appellant claims that LaShonda suffered mental anguish because of G.F.'s behavior. As\nindicia of this emotional trauma, the complaint states that LaShonda's grades dropped during the\n\n1992-1993 school year and that LaShonda wrote a suicide note in April 1993. Based on the above\n\nallegations, appellant contends that \"[t]he deliberate indifference by Defendants to the unwelcomed\n\n[sic] sexual advances of a student upon LaShonda created an intimidating, hostile, offensive and\n\nabuse [sic] school environment in violation of Title IX.\" We therefore consider whether Title IX\n\nallows a claim against a school board based on a school official's failure to remedy a known hostile\n\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fenvironment6 caused by the sexual harassment of one student by another (\"student-student sexual\n\nharassment\").\n\n                                                 II.\n\n       Title IX provides that \"[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded\n\nfrom participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any\n\neducation program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\" 20 U.S.C. § 1681 (1994).\n\nAlthough nothing in the plain language of Title IX speaks to the issue of student-student sexual\n\nharassment, several district courts have held that Title IX allows a student to sue a school board for\n\nfailing to prevent hostile-environment sexual harassment by another student.

In general, the Court has allowed private plaintiffs to proceed under Title IX only in\ncases that allege intentional gender discrimination by the administrators of educational institutions.\n\nAccording to the Court, plaintiffs can state a claim under Title IX by alleging that a federally funded\n\neducational institution, acting through its employees, intentionally subjected them to discrimination\n\nin its educational programs or activities.

Appellant does not allege that any employee of the Board intentionally discriminated against\n\nLaShonda by personally participating in G.F.'s offensive conduct toward her. Rather, appellant\n\nalleges that the Board violated Title IX by failing adequately to respond to LaShonda's complaints.\n\nNeither the Supreme Court nor this court has considered whether a Title IX plaintiff can proceed\n\nunder this theory. In short, by seeking direct liability of the Board for the wrongdoing of a student,\n\nappellant argues for an extension of liability under Title IX. We examine the legislative history of\n\nTitle IX to determine whether Congress intended this provision to reach appellant's allegations.\n\n                                                 A.\n\n       The provision now known as Title IX emerged from a flurry of bills regarding public\n\neducation. In June and July 1970, the House Subcommittee on Education of the House Committee\n\non Education and Labor, under the leadership of Representative Edith Green, held hearings on\n\ngender discrimination in federally funded educational programs. See Discrimination Against\n\nWomen: Hearings on Section 805 of H.R. 16098 Before the Special Subcomm. on Education of the\n\nHouse Comm. on Education and Labor, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970) [hereinafter House Hearings\n]. None of the testimony before Representative Green's subcommittee concerned student-student\n\nsexual harassment or related issues, such as school discipline. Instead, the subcommittee's work\n\nfocused on eliminating gender discrimination in school admissions and in the employment decisions\n\nof school administrators.\n\n       By 1970, section 703 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 already prohibited gender\n\ndiscrimination in employment. See Civil Rights Act of 1964, Pub.L. No. 88-352, § 703, 78 Stat.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\f241, 255 (1964) (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2 (1994)) (\"Title VII\").7 Title VII, however, did not\n\napply to educational institutions. See § 702, 78 Stat. at 255 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. §\n\n2000e-1 (1994)). Similarly, section 601 of the Civil Rights Act prohibited racial discrimination by\n\nall recipients of federal funding.

(1970). This amendment would have applied to schools the\n\nnon-discrimination requirements of Title VII and added \"sex\" to the types of discrimination banned\n\nby Title VI. See House Hearings, supra, at 1. In other words, the subcommittee's amendment was\n\ndesigned to bridge the gap between Title VII and Title VI.

(1971). This bill contained a provision similar to the amendment proposed by Representative\n\nGreen's subcommittee nearly one year earlier.         Title X of H.R. 7248 prohibited gender\n\ndiscrimination in any education program or activity receiving federal financial support. H.R.Rep.\n\nNo. 92-554, at 108 (1972), reprinted in 1972 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2462, 2511-12. The House report on\n\nH.R. 7248 described this provision as a response to discriminatory admissions policies and\n\nemployment practices at federally funded schools. See id. Once again, neither the House report nor\n\nthe underlying testimony discussed student-student sexual harassment.\n\n\n\n   7\n    Title VII states, \"It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer ... to\ndiscriminate against any individual with respect to ... compensation, terms, conditions, or\nprivileges of employment, because of such individual's ... sex.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1)\n(1994).\n   8\n    Title VI provides that \"[n]o person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or\nnational origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to\ndiscrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\" 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000d (1994).\n\n                                                 9\n\f       While the House bill remained in committee, the Senate was considering a similar education\n\nbill. See S. 659, 92nd Cong. (1971). The Senate bill emerged from the Senate Committee on Labor\n\nand Public Welfare on August 3, 1971, without any antidiscrimination provision at all.\n\nConsequently, on August 5, 1971, Senator Birch Bayh introduced on the Senate floor an amendment\n\nto the committee's version of S. 659. See 117 Cong. Rec. 30,156. (1971). His amendment, like the\n\nHouse provision drafted by Representative Green's subcommittee, extended the antidiscrimination\n\nprovisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to gender discrimination by federally funded \"institutions\n\nof higher learning.\"9 See id. at 30,155. In defending his amendment, Senator Bayh did not discuss\n\nstudent-student sexual harassment, nor did he discuss school discipline. He focused on gender\n\ndiscrimination in school admissions and employment opportunities for female teachers. See id. at\n\n30,155-56. In any event, the Senate rejected Bayh's amendment as non-germane, id. at 30,415, and\n\nthe Senate passed S. 659 on August 6, 1971, without an antidiscrimination provision.\n\n       On November 3, 1971, the House began consideration of S. 659, as passed by the Senate.\n\nThe House \"amended\" the Senate bill by striking virtually the entire contents of S. 659 and replacing\n\nit with the contents of H.R. 7248, including the antidiscrimination provision. See S.Rep. No. 92-\n\n604, at 1 (1972), reprinted in 1972 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2595, 2595. The House made this change without\n\nofficial comment and passed its version of S. 659 on November 4, 1971. See 117 Cong. Rec. at\n\n30,882.\n\n       On November 24, 1971, the Senate, by unanimous consent, referred the House version of\n\nS. 659 back to the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, which proceeded to amend the House\n\nversion to conform to the original Senate version. See S.Rep. No. 92-604, at 1-2 (1972), reprinted\n\nin 1972 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2595, 2595-96.         Once again, the committee did not discuss gender\n\ndiscrimination at all, much less sexual harassment among students. On February 7, 1972, the Senate\n\n\n   9\n    Senator Bayh's first amendment provided, \"No person ... shall, on the ground of sex, ... be\nsubject to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by a public institution of\nhigher education, or any school or department of graduate education, which is a recipient of\nFederal financial assistance for any education program or activity.\" 117 Cong. Rec. at 30,156.\n\n                                                 10\n\fcommittee sent its own version of S. 659 back to the floor of the Senate. See 118 Cong. Rec. 2806\n\n(1972).\n\n          Once the bill returned to the Senate floor, Senator Bayh again introduced an amendment to\n\nadd an antidiscrimination provision.10 See id. at 5802-03. Bayh's proposal was intended to \"close[\n\n] loopholes in existing legislation relating to general education programs and employment resulting\n\nfrom those programs.\" Id. at 5803. In support of his amendment, Senator Bayh stated,\n\n          we are dealing with three basically different types of discrimination here[:] ... discrimination\n          in admission to an institution, discrimination of [sic] available services or studies within an\n          institution once students are admitted, and discrimination in employment within an\n          institution, as a member of the faculty or whatever.\n\nId. at 5812. To counter these problems, Senator Bayh proposed a provision he thought would \"cover\n\nsuch crucial aspects as admissions procedures, scholarships, and faculty employment, with limited\n\nexceptions.\" Id. at 5803. Yet again, no senator mentioned student-student sexual harassment or\n\nschool discipline.\n\n          The Senate adopted Bayh's second amendment on February 28, 1972. See 118 Cong. Rec.\n\nat 5815 (1972). Because of irreconcilable differences between the House and Senate versions of S.\n\n659, both Houses referred the bill to a conference committee. See S. Conf. Rept. No. 92-798, at 1\n\n(1972). The conference committee reported out a joint bill containing the antidiscrimination\n\nmeasure now known as Title IX. The committee, however, did not explain its reasons for including\n\nTitle IX. The conference bill passed both Houses and was signed into law on June 23, 1972. See 118\n\nCong. Rec. at 22,702. Throughout this long legislative history, the drafters of Title IX never\n\ndiscussed student-student sexual harassment or the related issue of school discipline.\n\n                                                    B.\n\n          While the legislative history of Title IX does not indicate that Congress authorized a private\n\ncause of action for studentstudent sexual harassment, the legislative history does show that Title IX\n\n\n   10\n     Senator Bayh's second amendment stated, \"No person ... shall, on the basis of sex, ... be\nsubjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial\nassistance....\" 118 Cong.

The legislative history of Title IX indicates that Congress intended to impose upon\n\nrecipients of federal educational assistance a requirement of non-discrimination on the basis of sex.\n\nThe Spending Clause authorized Congress to impose this condition.\n\n        Representative Green put it succinctly: \"If we are writing the law, I would say that any\n\ninstitution could be all men or all women, but my own feeling is that they do it with their own funds\n\nand not taxpayers' funds.\" Higher Education Amendments of 1971: Hearings on H.R. 32, H.R.\n\n5191, H.R. 5192, H.R. 5193, and H.R. 7248 Before the Special Subcomm. on Education of the House\n\nComm. on Education and Labor, 92nd Cong., 1st Sess. 581 (1971). Representative Green also\n\nquoted with approval President Nixon, who had stated, \"Neither the President nor the Congress nor\n\nthe conscience of the Nation can permit money which comes from all the people to be used in a way\n\nwhich discriminates against some of the people.\" 117 Cong. Rec. at 39,257 (1971) (statement of\n\nRep. Green). To Senator Bayh, the reach of Title IX was clearly restricted to federally funded\n\ninstitutions. See 118 Cong. Rec. at 5812. In support of Title IX, Senator McGovern stated, \"I urge\n\nmy colleagues to take every opportunity to prohibit Federal funding of sex discrimination.\" 117\n\nCong. Rec. at 30,158. This legislative history clearly shows that Congress intended Title IX to be\n\n\n\n\n   11\n    Section 8 of Article I provides, in part, that \"[t]he Congress shall have [the] Power To ...\nprovide for the ... general Welfare of the United States.\" U.S. Const. art.

As noted above, Title\n\nVI prohibits recipients of federal funding from engaging in race discrimination. In Guardians\n\nAssociation v. Civil Service Commission, at least six members of the Supreme Court agreed that\n\nTitle VI was enacted under the Spending Clause.

See Franklin, 503 U.S. at 75 n. 8, 112 S.Ct. at 1038 n. 8. One could argue, as\ndid the petitioner in Franklin, that Title IX was enacted under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment,\nwhich provides Congress with the authority to enact legislation preventing states from\n\"deny[ing] to any person ... the equal protection of the laws.\" U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1, cl.\n4.\n\n                The Equal Protection Clause, however, only protects against action by\n        state-sponsored entities. See Shelley v.

Thus, if Title IX had\n        been enacted under the Fourteenth Amendment, then the antidiscrimination provision of\n        Title IX would not reach federally funded schools that were not state actors. We think\n        that the plain language of Title IX commands a different result: no school that receives\n        federal funding may discriminate on the basis of gender. Therefore, we conclude that\n        Title IX was enacted pursuant to a power that can reach non-state actors as well as state\n        actors—the spending power. See Rowinsky, 80 F.3d at 1013 n. 14.\n\n                                                13\n\f(quoting 110 Cong. Rec. at 1542) (internal quotation marks omitted). This interpretation matches\n\nthe plain language of Title VI, which conditions the disbursement of federal funds on the recipient's\n\nagreement not to discriminate on the basis of race. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000d (1994).\n\n       The language of Title IX is virtually identical to the language of Title VI. See 117 Cong. Rec.\n\nat 30,156 (statement of Sen. Bayh). The only differences are the substitution of the words \"on the\n\nbasis of sex\" for the words \"on the ground of race, color, or national origin\" and the insertion of the\n\nword \"educational\" in front of the words \"program or activity.\" See Grove City College v.

We therefore consider whether Congress gave the Board\n\nunambiguous notice that it could be held liable for failing to stop G.F.'s harassment of LaShonda.\n\n        Appellant and the United States Department of Justice, as amicus curiae, argue that Title\n\nIX gave the Board clear notice of this form of liability. Appellant points to the Supreme Court's\ndecision in Franklin. In Franklin, the Court suggested that \"th[e] notice problem does not arise in\n\na case ... in which intentional discrimination is alleged.\" 503 U.S. at 74-75, 112 S.Ct. at 1037. The\n\nCourt stated that the plain language of Title IX imposes on schools a duty not to discriminate on the\n\nbasis of sex, and when a school teacher sexually harasses a student, that teacher is discriminating\n\non the basis of sex. Id. at 75, 112 S.Ct. at 1037. Appellant argues that a school employee is\n\nintentionally discriminating on the basis of sex when he or she fails to prevent one student from\n\n\n\n\n                                                   15\n\fsexually harassing another.13 Hence, appellant asserts that the school board here had sufficient\n\n   13\n     Appellant and the Department of Justice argue that we should use Title VII standards of\nliability to interpret Title IX. An employer is directly liable under Title VII if it is deliberately\nindifferent to peer sexual harassment in the workplace. See Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1530</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1538-39 (11th Cir.1997) (en banc). Appellant argues that a school should also be\nliable if it is deliberately indifferent to peer sexual harassment at school.\n\n                The superficial appeal of this argument has attracted the adherence of a few\n        courts. See, e.g., Bruneau, 935 F.Supp. at 170-71. These courts have applied Title VII\n        standards of liability to Title IX cases simply because (1) Title VII and Title IX both deal\n        with sexual harassment and (2) the Supreme Court once cited a Title VII case in\n        discussing liability under Title IX, see generally Franklin, 503 U.S. at 75, 112 S.Ct. at\n        1037 (quoting Meritor Savings Bank v.

See Bruneau, 935 F.Supp. at 170-71.\n\n                However, the Supreme Court has never discussed student-student sexual\n        harassment or generally applied Title VII jurisprudence to Title IX cases. Perhaps for\n        this reason, some courts that have imposed Title VII-type liability under Title IX have\n        refused—without much explanation—to apply all of Title VII jurisprudence to Title IX.\n        See, e.g., Bruneau, 935 F.Supp. at 169-70 (\"[T]he Court cautions that by holding that\n        Title VII legal standards apply to an analysis of Title IX claims, the Court is not holding\n        that the entirety of Title VII jurisprudence must be applied to Title IX.\"). Other courts\n        have altogether refused to apply Title VII jurisprudence to Title IX. See, e.g., Rosa H.,\n        106 F.3d at 656 (\"Franklin 's single citation to Meritor Savings to support the Court's\n        conclusion that sexual harassment is sex discrimination does not by itself justify the\n        importation of other aspects of Title VII law into the Title IX context.\").\n\n                We decline appellant's invitation to use Title VII standards of liability to resolve\n        this Title IX case. See Doe v. Petaluma City Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"696237\"><a href=\"/opinion/696237/jane-doe-a-minor-by-and-through-her-guardian-ad-litem-john-doe-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1447</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1450-51 (9th\n        Cir.1994). First, Title VII and Title IX are worded differently. If Congress wished Title\n        IX to be interpreted like the earlier-enacted Title VII, Congress would have written Title\n        IX to read like Title VII. Congress did not. Interpreting the plain language of different\n        statutes does not automatically produce the same result simply because both statutes\n        proscribe similar behavior.\n\n                Second, Title VII was enacted under the far-reaching Commerce Clause and § 5\n        of the Fourteenth Amendment. See E.E.O.C. v. Pacific Press Publ'g Ass'n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"403389\"><a href=\"/opinion/403389/28-fair-emplpraccas-1596-29-empl-prac-dec-p-32817-equal-employment/\"><span class=\"volume\">676</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n        <span class=\"page\">1272</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1279 n. 10 (9th Cir.1982). Title IX was not, and consequently its reach is\n        narrower.\n\n                Third, the exposition of liability under Title VII depends upon agency principles.\n        See Meritor, 477 U.S. at 72, 106 S.Ct. at 2408; Faragher, 111 F.3d at 1534-36. Agency\n        principles are useless in discussing liability for student-student harassment under Title\n        IX, because students are not agents of the school board. See generally Restatement\n        (Second) of Agency § 1 (1958) (defining an agency relationship as one in which the\n        principal consents to representation by the agent and the agent consents to control by the\n        principal). Therefore, even if employers owe to employees some sort of nondelegable\n        duty to eliminate peer harassment in the workplace, see generally id. § 492 (discussing\n        employers' duty to provide reasonably safe working conditions for their employees),\n        schools owe to students no comparable duty. In short, Title VII jurisprudence does not\n\n                                                 16\n\fnotice, for purposes of the Spending Clause, that it could be held liable. We disagree.14\n        The terms of Title IX gave educational institutions notice that they must prevent their\n\nemployees from themselves engaging in intentional gender discrimination. See Franklin, 503 U.S.\n\nat 75, 112 S.Ct. at 1037. Thus, school administrators cannot deny admission to female applicants\n\nbecause of their gender. See Cannon, 441 U.S. at 709, 99 S.Ct. at 1964. School administrators\n\ncannot discriminate against teachers on account of sex. See North Haven Bd. of Educ., 456 U.S. at\n\n\n\n\n        control the outcome of this case.\n   14\n    We note that neither this court nor the Supreme Court in Franklin fully addressed the\nquestion of whether a student can state a claim under Title IX for sexual harassment by a\nteacher—much less whether a student can state a claim under Title IX for sexual harassment by\nanother student.\n\n                The defendant school board in Franklin successfully moved the district court to\n        dismiss Franklin's Title IX suit on the ground that \"compensatory relief is unavailable for\n        violations of Title IX,\" a holding which this court affirmed.

The Supreme Court granted certiorari to consider \"whether the implied right of\n        action under Title IX ... supports a claim for monetary damages.\" Franklin, 503 U.S. at\n        62-63, 112 S.Ct. at 1031. The Court emphasized that \"the question of what remedies are\n        available under a statute that provides a private right of action is \"analytically distinct'\n        from the issue of whether such a right exists in the first place.\" Id. at 65-66, 112 S.Ct. at\n        1032. In fact, the Franklin Court rejected the arguments of the United States as amicus\n        curiae precisely because those arguments concerned the existence vel non of a cause of\n        action for teacher-student sexual harassment, a question which the Court considered\n        \"irrelevant.\" Id. at 69, 112 S.Ct. at 1034.\n\n                The Franklin Court discussed the notice element of the Spending Clause solely to\n        counter the school board's argument that \"the normal presumption in favor of all\n        appropriate remedies should not apply because Title IX was enacted pursuant to\n        Congress' Spending Clause power.\" Id. at 74, 112 S.Ct. at 1037. Viewed in this light,\n        the Supreme Court's suggestion that teacher-student sexual harassment gives rise to a\n        cause of action under Title IX was arguably dicta. We assume that Franklin created a\n        cause of action for teacher-student sexual harassment under Title IX, but we are wary of\n        extending this assumed holding to student-student sexual harassment. In any event, the\n        Court's discussion of this issue does not foreclose our own consideration of whether\n        appellant has stated a claim under Title IX.\n\n                                                 17\n\f530, 102 S.Ct. at 1922-23. Teachers cannot sexually harass their students. See Franklin, 503 U.S.\n\nat 74-75, 112 S.Ct. at 1037.\n\n        The present complaint, however, does not allege that a school employee discriminated\n\nagainst LaShonda in any of the foregoing ways. The complaint does not allege, for example, that\n\nFort, Maples, Pippin, or Querry sexually harassed LaShonda. Rather, the complaint alleges that\n\nthese individuals failed to take measures sufficient to prevent a non-employee from discriminating\n\nagainst LaShonda. We do not think that the Board was on notice when it accepted federal funding\n\nthat it could be held liable in this situation.\n\n                                                  B.\n\n        First, as we have noted, nothing in the language or history of Title IX suggests that Title IX\n\nimposes liability for student-student sexual harassment.15 Second, the imposition of this form of\n\nliability would so materially affect schools' decisions whether to accept Title IX funding that it\n\nwould require an express, unequivocal disclosure by Congress. Adopting appellant's theory of\n\nliability, however, could give rise to a form of \"whipsaw\" liability, under which public schools\n\nwould face lawsuits from both the alleged harasser and the alleged victim of the harassment.\n\nMoreover, reasonable public school officials could perceive the likely number of such suits to be\n\nlarge. Because our endorsement of appellant's theory of liability would alter materially the terms\n\nof the contract between Congress and recipients of federal funding, appellant fails to state a claim\nupon which relief can be granted.\n\n        The essence of appellant's complaint is this: once a public school student complains to her\n\nteacher that a classmate has sexually harassed her, the teacher and the school board become subject\n\n   15\n     The dissent devotes a great deal of attention to whether Congress intended that Title IX\ncreate a cause of action for student-student sexual harassment. See Post, at 3372-75. We\nseriously doubt whether Congress considered this problem at all when it enacted Title IX, but, in\nany case, the dissent's heavy reliance on its conclusory analysis of the language and history of\nTitle IX is largely irrelevant. The question is not whether Congress intended to create a cause of\naction under Title IX for student-student sexual harassment but, rather, whether Congress gave\nschool boards notice of this form of liability. In the absence of any supporting legislative\nhistory, statutory construction of ambiguous language cannot support a finding of notice as\nrequired by the Spending Clause.\n\n                                                  18\n\fto the threat of liability in money damages under federal law if they can prevent the classmate from\n\nharassing again and fail to do so.16 See, e.g., Bosley, 904 F.Supp. at 1023 (\"Once a school district\n\nbecomes aware of sexual harassment, it must promptly take remedial action which is reasonably\n\ncalculated to end the harassment.\") (emphasis added). In practical terms, this means that school\n\nofficials would have to isolate an alleged harasser from other students through suspension or\n\nexpulsion.\n\n        The complaint devotes little attention to what measures the Board could have taken to avoid\n\nliability. The complaint admits that Querry and Fort tried to stop G.F.'s harassment by threatening\n\nhim and by separating him from LaShonda within Fort's classroom. Appellant clearly does not\n\nbelieve that these measures sufficed. As evidence of \"deliberate indifference,\" the complaint also\n\nalleges that the Board failed to create a school sexual harassment policy. It seems unlikely,\n\nhowever, that the mere existence of such a policy would foreclose liability under appellant's theory\n\nof the case.\n\n        Apparently, the appropriateness of the Board's remedial measures depends on whether the\n\nharassment actually ends. The complaint suggests that G.F. should have been \"suspended, kept\n\naway from LaShonda, or disciplined in [some] way\" after LaShonda complained. The Department\n\nof Justice argues broadly that a school board must take \"effective action\" in response to an allegation\n\nof harassment. We take these arguments to mean the same thing: a school board must immediately\n\nisolate an alleged harasser from other students to avoid the threat of a lawsuit under Title IX.\n\n        Physical separation of the alleged harasser from other students is the only way school boards\n\ncan ensure that they cannot be held liable for future acts of harassment. If a school official simply\n\ntells the alleged harasser, \"Don't do it again,\" and the harasser does it again, then the board becomes\n\nsusceptible to the argument that it had the power to end the harassment, but failed to do so out of\n\n   16\n     Private schools that receive federal funding would also be subject to suit under appellant's\ntheory of Title IX liability. Private school teachers and administrators, however, would not\nordinarily be subject to suit under § 1983, as would their public school counterparts, because\nthey would not ordinarily be acting under color of state law. See § 1983; see generally supra, n.\n2. Accordingly, we discuss individual liability only with respect to public school employees.\n\n                                                  19\n\f\"deliberate indifference.\" If the official merely transfers the alleged harasser to another classroom,\n\nthe board faces the threat of suit for any acts of harassment committed by him in the new\n\nclassroom—after all, the school had notice of his dangerous propensities and did not do all it could\n\nto prevent him from harassing his new classmates. Segregating the sexes into two separate programs\n\nwithin the same school would violate the spirit, if not the letter, of Title IX. Therefore, in practical\n\nterms, to avoid the threat of Title IX liability under appellant's theory of the case, a school must\n\nimmediately suspend or expel a student accused of sexual harassment.17\n\n        Appellant's standard of liability therefore creates for school boards and school officials a\n\nHobson's choice: On the one hand, if a student complains to a school official about sexual\n\nharassment, the official must suspend or expel the alleged harasser or the board will face potential\n\nliability to the victim. Moreover, if a public school official with control over the harasser finds out\n\nabout his misconduct and fails to isolate him, that official runs the risk of personal liability under\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 for depriving the victim of her Title IX rights if the harasser engages in further\n\nabuse.18 See Nicole M., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The kind of notice and the formality of the hearing will depend, of course, on the\n        nature and severity of the deprivation the student faces: for example, \"due process\n        requires, in connection with a suspension of 10 days or less, that the student be given oral\n        or written notice of the charges against him and, if he denies them, an explanation of the\n        evidence the authorities have and an opportunity to present his side of the story.\" Id. at\n        581, 95 S.Ct. at 740 (emphasis added); see also, e.g., Board of Curators v.

Nor do we put aside the possibility that in unusual\n        situations, although involving only a short suspension, something more than rudimentary\n        procedures will be required.\" Id. at 584, 95 S.Ct. at 741.

Were we to adopt appellant's theory of the case,\n\ntherefore, public school officials would have a financial incentive to punish alleged student\n\nharassers. A financial incentive may render a decisionmaker impermissibly biased.21 See Gibson\n\n        Clause, if the principal \"took a bribe from [a] complaining student's parents in return for\n        suspending or expelling [an] alleged wrongdoer.\" Post, at 3373. JUDGE CARNES,\n        however, refuses to accept that a principal would be just as impermissibly biased if the\n        principal were forced to pay money to a complaining student for not suspending or\n        expelling an alleged wrongdoer. We fail to grasp the distinction.\n   21\n     On page 3373-74 of his separate opinion, JUDGE CARNES leads us through a parade of\nhorribles which, he imagines, we have created by suggesting that appellant's theory of the case\nwould potentially give public school officials an impermissible financial incentive to punish\nalleged student harassers. The dire consequences he conjures, however, will never come to pass\nprecisely because we are not adopting appellant's theory of Title IX liability. Only if we were to\nadopt her theory might public school officials face potential liability under both Title IX and the\nprocedural component of the Due Process Clause. But we do not adopt appellant's theory of\nliability.\n\n                With regard to non-school settings, JUDGE CARNES overstates our opinion and\n        then criticizes us for the breadth of our holding. He chides us for suggesting that \"[a]ll\n        federal, state, or local officials called upon to decide what to do in response to one\n        person's complaint about another would have a financial incentive to avoid a lawsuit,\n        which would disqualify them from making a decision.\" Post, at 3374. We suggest\n        nothing of the kind.\n                Nevertheless, on the merits of his critique, we suppose that all officials in such\n        situations could face lawsuits alleging impermissible bias—if none of those officials had\n        any form of immunity from suit, which, of course, they do have. Stated differently,\n        public decisionmakers have immunity from suit to protect them from the sort of bias\n        which might otherwise give rise to violations of the Due Process Clause. Judges, for\n        example, have absolute immunity from suit because \"the independent and impartial\n        exercise of judgment vital to the judiciary might be impaired by exposure to potential\n        damages liability.\" Antoine v.

Therefore, the\n\ndisciplinary measures required to avoid liability under Title IX could subject the school board to the\n\nthreat of suit by the disciplined harasser.22\n\n        In addition to the threat of this whipsaw liability, schools would face the virtual certainty of\n\nextensive litigation costs. These costs would include not only lawyers fees, but also the burdens\n\nassociated with the disruption of the educational process. The litigation we describe would\n\ninevitably involve teachers, students, and administrators in time-consuming discovery and trial\n\npreparation. Schools could reasonably expect to receive from Congress explicit notice of these\n\nconsequences. They did not.23\n\n\n        defendants in this case would likely be entitled to qualified immunity.\n\n                In sum, we create no new procedural due process rights, as JUDGE CARNES\n        asserts. Our opinion does not even suggest that we would have to create such rights if we\n        were to uphold appellant's theory of Title IX liability. Rather, our opinion states that this\n        form of liability is a logical extension of appellant's theory of the case, and Congress\n        gave no notice to public school boards that they would be potentially undertaking this\n        form of liability when they accepted federal funding under Title IX.\n   22\n     All of the foregoing assumes, of course, that the allegations of harassment are true. While\nwe hesitate to assume that any allegations of student-student sexual harassment are false, we do\nnot doubt that school students will be tempted into mischief by the prospect of swift punishment\nagainst any classmate whom they accuse of sexual harassment.\n\n                 Moreover, public school officials would find such false accusations difficult to\n        combat. Under Title VII standards of liability, which the appellant, the United States,\n        and the dissent seem anxious to adopt, an employer may be sued for retaliating against an\n        employee who complains about sexual harassment. See generally 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n        3(a) (1994) (\"It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer ... to\n        discriminate against any individual ... because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or\n        participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this\n        subchapter.\"). Thus, under the logical implications of appellants theory of Title IX\n        liability, a school board could face a lawsuit from the complaining student if it disciplines\n        her for bringing a vexatious complaint against a classmate. As discussed in the text, the\n        threat of lawsuits under § 1983 against the public school officials themselves would soon\n        follow.\n   23\n     Appellant and the Department of Justice draw our attention to the regulatory activities of the\nOffice of Civil Rights of the United States Department of Justice (\"OCR\"). The OCR issued\ninterim guidelines concerning schoolhouse sexual harassment on August 16, 1996. See Sexual\nHarassment Guidance: Peer Sexual Harassment, 61 Fed.Reg. 42,728 (1996). These guidelines\nissued after the alleged harassment of LaShonda. Moreover, at the time of the alleged\nharassment, the code of federal regulations did not discuss student-student sexual harassment.\n\n                                                  23\n\fSee 34 C.F.R. § 106.31 (1992). Therefore, OCR's regulations did not put the Board on official\nnotice of its potential liability for G.F.'s harassment of LaShonda.\n\n               Nevertheless, appellant and the Department of Justice urge that we defer to the\n       OCR's current interpretation of Title IX for purposes of this case. The OCR issued final\n       policy guidance on student sexual harassment on March 13, 1997. See Sexual\n       Harassment Guidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, or\n       Third Parties, 62 Fed.Reg. 12,034 (1997). In this publication, the OCR constructs a\n       labyrinth of factors and caveats which simply reinforces our conclusion that the Board\n       was not on notice that it could be held liable in the present situation.\n\n              According to the March 13 guidance, schools are liable for failing to eliminate\n\n              sexually harassing conduct (which can include unwelcome sexual advances,\n              requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct of a\n              sexual nature) ... by another student ... that is sufficiently severe, persistent, or\n              pervasive to limit a student's ability to participate in or benefit from an education\n              program or activity, or to create a hostile or abusive educational environment.\n\n       Id. at 12,038.\n\n               Because the meaning of this language may not be obvious to school officials, the\n       March 13 guidance lists several factors which should be taken into account when a\n       student is sent to the office for sexually harassing another student. Among other factors\n       and subfactors, the school official should consider the \"welcomeness\" of the conduct, the\n       age of the harasser, the age of the victim, the relationship between the parties, the degree\n       to which the conduct was sexual in nature, the duration of the conduct, the frequency of\n       the conduct involved, the degree to which the conduct affected the victim's education, the\n       pervasiveness of the conduct at the school, the location of the incident, the occurrence of\n       any similar incidents at the school, the occurrence of any incidents of gender-based but\n       non-sexual harassment, the size of the school, and the number of individuals involved in\n       the incident.\n\n               The school official should keep in mind that \"in some circumstances, nonsexual\n       conduct may take on sexual connotations and may rise to the level of sexual harassment.\"\n       Id. at 12,039. He should also remember that \"a hostile environment may exist even if\n       there is no tangible injury to the student,\" and even if the complaining student was not the\n       target of the harassment. Id. at 12,041. In addition, the official must recall that a single\n       act of student-student harassment can create a hostile environment. See id. Finally, the\n       school official must keep in mind that, if he does not kick the alleged harasser out of\n       school, and the harasser misbehaves again, the official could be personally liable if a jury\n       concludes, after the fact, that he could have done more to prevent the harasser from\n       harming his classmates.\n\n               The foregoing analysis assumes, of course, that the school official actually knew\n       of the complaint against the harasser and summoned him to the front office. According\n       to the OCR, however, the official may be liable even if he did not know about the\n       harassment: the official may cause the school to violate Title IX if he failed to exercise\n       \"due care\" in discovering the misconduct. See id. at 12,042. The foregoing does not\n       address the lawsuit that the harasser's parents will file when the school official summarily\n\n                                                24\n\f                                                 C.\n\n        School boards could reasonably believe that this form of whipsaw liability would arise in a\n\nsubstantial number of cases. According to a 1993 survey of American public school students, 65%\n\nof students in grades eight to eleven were victims of student-student sexual harassment. See\n\nAmerican Ass'n of Univ. Women Educ. Found., Hostile Hallways: The AAUW Survey on Sexual\n\nHarassment in American Schools 11 (1993) [hereinafter AAUW Survey]. Extrapolating from\n\nDepartment of Education statistics, roughly 7,784,000 public school students in grades eight through\n\neleven would consider themselves to be victims of student-student sexual harassment.24\n\nFurthermore, 59% of students (including 52% of female students) in grades eight to eleven\n\nresponded that they had sexually harassed other students. See AAUW Survey, supra, at 11-12. Thus,\n\nif this survey is accurate, around 7,177,000 public school students in grades eight to eleven, male\n\nand female, would admit to sexually harassing other students.\n\n        We do not adopt these statistics as our own definitive guide to the extent of sexual\n\nharassment in America's public schools. We draw attention to these figures only to illustrate what\n\nschool boards would have to consider in deciding whether to accept federal funding under Title IX.\n\nThe AAUW Survey could suggest to reasonable public school officials that a substantial number of\n\nlawsuits will be brought under appellant's theory of Title IX liability. Therefore, imposition of this\n\n\n\n\n        suspends him. According to appellant and the Department of Justice, the Board received\n        clear notice of this form of liability when it accepted federal funding under Title IX. We\n        think not.\n   24\n     To calculate the number of purported student victims of harassment in the nation, we\nmultiplied the percentage of victims provided by the AAUW Survey by the total number of\nstudents enrolled in public schools in grades eight to eleven during the 1992-1993 school year.\nWe obtained the enrollment statistics from the world-wide-web home page of the Department of\nEducation. See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Educ., Enrollment in Public Elementary and Secondary\nSchools, by Grade: Fall 1980 to Fall 1994 (last modified Mar. 1996) http://nces01.ed.gov/nces/\npubs/D96/D96T042.html> [hereinafter U.S. Education ]. We used the same process to calculate\nthe total number of professed student harassers in the nation.\n\n                                                 25\n\fform of liability would materially affect their decision whether to accept federal educational\n\nfunding.25\n\n        An enactment under the Spending Clause must read like a prospectus. Just as a prospectus\n\nmust unambiguously disclose all material facts to a would-be purchaser, an enactment under the\n\nSpending Clause must unambiguously disclose to would-be recipients all facts material to their\n\ndecision to accept Title IX funding. The threat of whipsaw liability in a substantial number of cases\n\nwould materially affect a Title IX recipient's decision to accept federal funding, yet Congress did\n\nnot provide unambiguous notice of this type of liability in the language or history of that statute.\n\nWe will not alter retrospectively the terms of the agreement between Congress and recipients of Title\n\nIX funding.26\n\n   25\n      In JUDGE CARNES' separate opinion, he characterizes our use of statistics as an attempt\n\"to establish that student-student sexual harassment is such a widespread and extensive problem\nthat a different holding of this case would impose massive liability upon school officials and\nboards.\" Post, at 3375. As we indicate in the text, this is not our objective at all. We cite these\nstatistics because school boards may consider them to be a valid indicator of the amount of\nlitigation that they will face. If a lawyer for the Monroe County School Board were trying to\nadvise the Board about the potential costs and benefits of accepting federal funding, would it not\nmatter to that lawyer whether accepting federal funds would give rise to a few lawsuits or\nthousands of lawsuits?\n\n                 JUDGE CARNES suggests that the AAUW Survey overstates the actual number\n        of lawsuits that could be brought under appellant's theory of Title IX liability. We agree\n        that the survey did not use the same definition of student-student sexual harassment as\n        our case law dictates, but statistical purity would arguably require a jury verdict agreeing\n        with the allegations of each student who claimed to have been harassed. In any event,\n        there are plenty of reasons for public school officials to overlook the statistical flaws in\n        the AAUW Survey when it is their own pocketbooks—not those of federal judges—that\n        are at stake.\n   26\n     As noted above, the purpose of enactments under the Spending Clause is \"to further\n[Congress's] broad policy objectives by conditioning receipt of federal moneys upon compliance\nby the recipient with federal statutory and administrative directives.\" Fullilove v.

During the 1992-1993 school\n       year, for example, American schools received $17,261,252,000 from the federal\n       government out of a total budget of $247,626,168,000.

The\n\ntext of Title IX provides that \"[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded\n\nfrom participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any\n\neducation program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\" 20 U.S.C. § 1681 (1994). As\n\nthe dissent recognizes, \"[t]he absolute prohibition contained in the text is framed solely in terms of\n\nwho is protected.\" The statute simply does not specify what relationship, if any, the perpetrator of\n\nan underlying act of sexual harassment must have to the federally-funded educational institution to\n\ntrigger Title IX liability.\n\n        The dissent nevertheless divines from congressional silence an unambiguous endorsement\n\nof the proposition that \"[t]he identity of the perpetrator is simply irrelevant.\" Under this conception\n\nof Title IX, liability presumably would attach anytime the school board failed to prevent\n\nanyone—student, teacher, parent, neighborhood resident—from discriminating on the basis of sex\n\nto the extent that such action inhibited a student from realizing the full benefits of federally-funded\neducation. In my view, the text of Title IX permits at least equally plausible constructions that\n\nwould circumscribe liability more narrowly. Specifically, the text of Title IX may be interpreted\n\nto impose liability only when the school board or one of its agents bears direct responsibility for\n\ndiscriminating on the basis of sex, as would be the case had any of Lashonda Davis' teachers\n\nparticipated in the sexual harassment she was forced to endure. The absence of any reliable textual\n\nindication regarding which of these constructions Congress envisioned invites consideration of\n\nlegislative history and the congressional power from which the statute emanates in an effort to\n\ndiscover congressional intent. The Court's approach thus represents an entirely appropriate effort\n\n\n                                                  28\n\fto effectuate congressional will in the absence of unambiguous textual guidance, not, as the dissent\n\nappears to suggest, strident judicial refusal to enforce clearly expressed legislative intent.\n\n       CARNES, Circuit Judge, concurring:\n\n       I concur in the holding that Title IX does not create a cause of action against public school\n\nboards or officials for failure to prevent or remedy student-student sexual harassment. In my view,\n\nthat holding is correct for essentially those reasons stated in Parts I, II, III A, and IV of Judge\n\nTjoflat's opinion, and I join those parts of it, which constitute the opinion of the Court. However,\n\nfor the reasons explained below, I do not join Parts III B and C of Judge Tjoflat's opinion, which\n\nexpress only his own views.1\n\n                                                  I.\n\n       The \"Hobson's choice\" or \"whipsaw liability\" discussion in Part III B of the opinion is based\n\nupon a fundamentally erroneous premise. If school officials could be sued for failing to prevent or\n\nremedy student-student sexual harassment, that part of the opinion says, the potential liability would\n\namount to a financial incentive to punish the accused harassers, which would or could render school\n\nofficials impermissibly biased and require recusal. Of course, a student does have a property interest\n\nin a public education which is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.2\n\n   1\n    Parts I, II, III A, and IV of Judge Tjoflat's opinion constitute the opinion of the Court,\nbecause those parts are joined by six of the ten judges participating in this decision. By contrast,\nnone of the other nine judges participating in this decision have joined Parts III B and C of that\nopinion.\n   2\n    The nature and extent of the protection afforded the property interest in a public education,\nthe due process requirements attendant to its loss, depends upon the severity of the loss.

The\nSupreme Court said in Goss that \"[i]n the great majority of cases the disciplinarian may\ninformally discuss the alleged misconduct with the student minutes after it has occurred,\" and\n\"[w]e hold only that, in being given an opportunity to explain his version of the facts at this\ndiscussion, the student first be told what he is accused of doing and what the basis of the\naccusation is.\" 419 U.S. at 582, 95 S.Ct. at 740.

But it is an entirely different matter to suggest, as Part III B of the\n\nopinion does, that a school official's potential liability to the complaining student if that official fails\n\nto take legally required action amounts to a \"financial incentive\" which renders that official\n\n\"impermissibly biased\" and requires recusal from deciding what action, if any, is required in the\n\ncircumstances.

The Gibson decision provides no\n\nsupport for the proposition, because it does not hold, or even imply, that an official's potential\n\nliability for failing to properly exercise decisionmaking authority constitutes a \"financial incentive\"\n\nwhich renders the official \"impermissibly biased.\"\n\n        Gibson involved a state optometry board composed exclusively of private practitioners who\n\nwere in competition with corporate employee optometrists. Those board members had a substantial\n\npecuniary interest in excluding from the market corporate employee optometrists, who accounted\n\nfor nearly half of all the practicing optometrists in the state. The Supreme Court affirmed the district\n\ncourt's holding that the private practitioner's pecuniary interest in eliminating competition\n\ndisqualified them from deciding whether the practice of optometry by corporate employees as such\n\nconstituted unprofessional conduct justifying license revocation. See 411 U.S. at 578-79, 93 S.Ct.\n\nat 1698. That holding does not support the proposition that any time an official can be sued for\n\nfailing to respond properly to a complaint that official is disqualified from making a decision about\n\nhow to respond to the complaint.\n\n\nof Curators v.

These \"rudimentary\nprecautions,\" to use the description from Goss itself, 419 U.S. at 581, 95 S.Ct. at 740, are a far\ncry from a due process tribunal hearing attendant to some property interest deprivations.\n\n                                                    30\n\f       If that suggested proposition were the law of this circuit—and thankfully it is not—no school\n\nofficial could ever discipline a student for any alleged misconduct as a result of another student's\n\ncomplaint without violating the due process rights of the disciplined student. The reason such an\n\nimposition of discipline would violate due process is that such an official would always have a\n\nfinancial incentive, under that view, to believe the complaint in order to avoid a lawsuit filed by the\n\ncomplainant. The ramifications of such a rule would extend to discipline for any type of\n\nmisconduct, because there is no principled basis on which a distinction can be drawn between\n\ndiscipline following a complaint about sexual harassment and that following a complaint about any\n\nother type of misconduct.\n\n       Nor is there any principled basis by which such an automatic disqualification rule could be\n\nconfined to school settings. It would also apply outside the Title IX context; for example, in jail\n\nand prison settings. If one prisoner complains to a jailer or warden about what some other prisoner\n\nhas done to him, under Judge Tjoflat's view that official will have a financial interest in avoiding a\n\nlawsuit from the complaining prisoner (alleging deliberate indifference), and such an interest\n\ndisqualifies the official from making any disciplinary decision about the complaint. So, not only\n\nwould the disqualification rule be automatic, it also would be universal. No one would be able to\n\ndecide any disciplinary matters in schools, in prisons, or in any other setting within the purview of\n\nthe Due Process Clause. All federal, state, or local officials called upon to decide what to do in\nresponse to one person's complaint about another would have a financial incentive to avoid a\n\nlawsuit, which would disqualify them from making a decision. That cannot be the law, and it is not\n\nthe law.\n\n       Judge Tjoflat's response to having these flaws in his reasoning pointed out is contained in\n\nfootnote 21 of his opinion, which will reward close scrutiny. First, that footnote assures us that we\n\nshould not worry about the far-reaching ramifications of the suggestion that potential liability equals\n\ndisqualifying bias, because this Court is holding that school officials have no liability under Title\n\nIX for student-student sexual harassment. Apparently forgotten is the assurance, in Part IV of the\n\n\n                                                  31\n\fopinion, that \"Georgia tort law may indeed provide redress\" for the very same conduct. If a school\n\nofficial's potential liability for not acting properly is a disqualifying financial interest, it matters not\n\nwhether that potential liability is posed by Title IX or by state tort law. The opinion does not, and\n\nlogically cannot, suggest otherwise. Instead, it adopts a head-in-the-sand approach which ignores\n\neverything but Title IX, as though that were the only potential source of liability for school officials\n\nwho are called upon to decide what to do about student-student sexual harassment complaints.\n\n        With its head comfortably in the sand, the opinion also ignores entirely the obvious\n\nimplications of its proposition for student-student disputes involving allegations of misbehavior\n\nother than sexual harassment. Part of the quotidian business of teachers and principals is resolving\n\ndisputes in which one student alleges another has threatened, hit, stolen from, or otherwise\n\nmistreated him or her. Some of those disputes pose potential liability for the teacher or principal\n\nwho fails to act. For example, a school official who fails to take appropriate action to protect a\n\nstudent from a threatened thrashing at the hands of another student may have to answer in a state\n\ncourt tort action. Under the reasoning contained in Part III B of the opinion, that potential liability\n\nwould prevent any school official from deciding what to do about such a complaint, because that\n\nofficial's potential liability to the complaining student would amount to a disqualifying financial\n\nbias. A careful reading of the opinion reveals that it fails to explain why that result would not\n\nnecessarily follow from its suggested reasoning.\n        As to settings outside the school context, footnote 21 of the opinion offers two responses to\n\nthis criticism. First, it simply denies—\"We suggest nothing of the kind\"—that its proposition about\n\npotential liability equaling disqualifying bias would have any application outside the schoolhouse.\n\nThat ipse dixit assertion has as little reasoning behind it as the proposition itself. The opinion fails\n\nto offer any reason why the automatic bias theory it suggests would not apply in non-school\n\ncontexts, because there is no reason. The right to an unbiased decision maker is a rudiment of due\n\nprocess, which is as applicable outside schools as within them.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    32\n\f        Apparently realizing that the ipse dixit approach will not shield the naked illogic of its\n\nposition from view, the opinion attempts to camouflage the problem with talk of immunity. \"Don't\n\nworry,\" we are told, officials in non-school settings have \"immunity from suit\" which removes any\n\npotential liability for failing to decide for the complaining party, and any financial incentive to favor\n\nthat party disappears along with the potential liability. The thinnest stripe of the attempted\n\ncamouflage is the opinion's reference to judicial immunity. We are not talking about judges. We\n\nare talking about the myriad of federal, state, and local non-judicial officials who are regularly called\n\nupon to decide what to do in response to one person's complaint about another. Jailers, wardens, and\n\nother corrections officials are but a few examples. These people are not judges. They do not enjoy\n\njudicial immunity.\n\n        Even so, the opinion says, there is qualified immunity. There are three problems with the\n\nassertion that the availability of qualified immunity distinguishes non-school officials from school\n\nofficials by removing any threat of lawsuit by a complaining party dissatisfied with an official's\n\nresolution of a complaint outside the school setting. First, qualified immunity is not absolute.\n\nSecond, qualified immunity does not shield officials from liability grounded on state law. Third,\n\nand most obviously, the doctrine of qualified immunity is the same for school officials as for\n\nnon-school officials. If that doctrine shields non-school officials from threat of lawsuit sufficiently\n\nto remove any disqualifying financial incentive to decide for a complainant, it does exactly the same\nfor school officials. Thus, with its talk of qualified immunity, Part III B of the opinion has\n\nsucceeded in reaching around and biting itself in the back. If what the plurality opinion says about\n\nthe due process implications of qualified immunity is true, then the opinion has disproven the very\n\nproposition it is seeking to defend.\n\n                                                   II.\n\n        Part III C of Judge Tjoflat's opinion attempts to establish that student-student sexual\n\nharassment is such a widespread and extensive problem that a different holding in this case would\n\nimpose massive liability upon school officials and boards. In its words, agreeing with appellant's\n\n\n                                                   33\n\ftheory of liability would give rise to \"thousands of lawsuits.\" Tjoflat Opinion at n.25. The factual\n\npremise of that reasoning is based entirely upon one survey report. See American Ass'n of Univ.\n\nWomen Educ. Found., Hostile Hallways: The AAUW Survey on Sexual Harassment in American\n\nSchools (1993) (hereinafter \"AAUW Survey Report \").\n\n        The AAUW Survey Report was not the subject of an evidentiary hearing in the district court,\n\nnor has it been examined in a hearing in any other court insofar as we know. Neither party to this\n\nappeal even mentioned the survey in the briefs; it was discussed only in one amicus brief. In\n\ngeneral, we should be reluctant to incorporate into our reasoning the results of a survey that has not\n\nbeen examined critically or tested in a trial or evidentiary hearing, the time-honored and proven\n\nmethods our system of justice uses to determine material facts.\n\n        Beyond the general problems with using surveys in judicial decision making, there are\n\nspecific reasons why employment of this particular survey for the purpose Judge Tjoflat uses it in\n\nPart III C of his opinion is ill-advised. That purpose, of course, is to show student-student sexual\n\nharassment is so rampant that if a cause of action existed for it the resulting flood of litigation would\n\ninundate our public school systems, or at least school officials would have a basis for fearing that\n\nresult—the basis being the survey.\n\n        The first reason we ought to be especially cautious about such a use of this particular survey\n\nis that its purported findings are, in the words of the sponsors of the survey: \"startling,\" and for\nsome \"the results will be surprising and shocking.\" Id. at 2. The reason for such descriptions is that\n\nit is difficult to believe that 65 percent of all eighth through eleventh grade students have been\n\nsexually harassed by other students, and that half of all female and male students in those grades are\n\nself-professed sexual harassers. We ought to be reluctant to accept as fact, or assume that school\n\nofficials would accept as fact, such \"surprising and shocking\" statistics based upon a single survey\n\nof only a tiny fraction of one percent of the total number of students in four grades.\n\n        Even a cursory look at the survey report gives more reason to be dubious about the opinion's\n\nuse of the report. The survey asked students how often \"[d]uring your whole school life\" has anyone\n\n\n                                                   34\n\f\"when you did not want them to\" done any of the following things, and it then provided a list of\n\nbehavior the survey defined as sexual harassment. See id. at 5. Some behavior on that list clearly\n\nconstitutes sexually harassing behavior of the most serious type. But included in the list is other\n\nbehavior that is less serious and far less likely to lead to complaints and litigation, which is what\n\nJudge Tjoflat uses the survey to predict (or posits that school boards will use it to predict). For\n\nexample, included in the survey's definitional list of sexual harassment was any instance in which\n\nanother student: \"Made sexual comments, jokes, gestures, or looks;\" or \"[s]pread sexual rumors\n\nabout you;\" or \"[s]aid you were gay or lesbian.\" Id. at 5. Remember that a single unwelcome\n\ninstance of such activity, during the student's entire school life, renders that student a victim of\n\nsexual harassment for purposes of the survey.\n\n       A student who has ever been looked at by another student in an unwelcome way perceived\n\nto be sexual is defined by the survey to be a sexual harassment victim. Any student ever called gay\n\nor lesbian is also a sexual harassment victim in the survey's view. Any time unwelcome rumors are\n\nspread about a student having any type of sexual activity (presumably including kissing) with\n\nanother student, those students are sexual harassment victims as the survey defines it. To take one\n\nfinal example of how the total incidence of \"sexual harassment\" reported overstates legally\n\nactionable incidents of sexual harassment, consider that the survey definition includes incidents in\n\nwhich someone \"[f]lashed or \"mooned' you.\" Id. At 5. Suppose that a student at a school function\n(which the survey defines to include school sporting events and field trips) \"moons\" all the students\n\nin attendance, or all those from a rival school. A single episode of that misbehavior—which is not\n\nnice and certainly should not occur, but has been known to happen—could make sexual harassment\n\nvictims, as the survey defines the term, out of scores or even hundreds of students. Yet, such an\n\nincident is extremely unlikely to result in litigation against the school.\n\n       It is also worthy of note that the survey asked students whether the behavior it defined as\n\nsexual harassment had happened to them \"[d]uring your whole school life.\" Id. at 5. Therefore, the\n\n\n\n\n                                                  35\n\f65 percent figure reflects those who have experienced that behavior at any time during any school\n\nyear of their life. It does not purport to be annual data.\n\n        Finally, Part III C of the opinion fails to point out that the survey also asked the students if\n\nany of them who had been sexually harassed, as that term was defined in the survey, had told a\n\nteacher about the experience. Only 7 percent of the sixty-five percent had. See AAUW Survey\n\nReport at 14. Whatever the reasons for not reporting such behavior to a teacher, the failure to do\n\nso in all but the rarest instances has obvious implications for the existence of causes of action against\n\nschools or the likelihood of actual litigation.\n\n        The opinion attempts to deflect criticism about misuse of the survey by suggesting that while\n\nthe opinion's author does not necessarily think that the survey is a valid indicator of how much\n\nstudent-student sexual harassment occurs, school boards might think that the survey is and reject\n\nfederal funding as a result of it. With all due respect, there is no reason to believe that school boards\n\nwould be less likely than federal judges to see the flaws in such an interpretation of the survey.\n\nSchool boards know more about what is going on in their schools than we do, and they can be\n\nexpected to critically examine any survey before using it as a basis for turning down federal funding\n\nfor their schools. Rather than hiding behind speculation about how school board officials might\n\ninterpret the survey, the opinion ought to face up to the flaws in its suggested use of the survey.\n\n        Upon its release, the sponsors of the survey stated that they were \"confident that the results\nof this survey will become a focal point on the agendas of policy makers, educators, and others\n\nconcerned with the education of America's children.\" Id. at 21. Their confidence about how the\n\nsurvey would be used might be undermined by Part III C of Judge Tjoflat's opinion. More\n\nimportantly, we are not policymakers. We do not have agendas. We ought to leave this survey to\n\nthose who do.\n\n                                                  III.\n\n        The parts of Judge Tjoflat's opinion that neither I nor any other member of the Court except\n\nits author joins, Parts III B and C, are not necessary to the opinion's essential reasoning or to the\n\n\n                                                   36\n\fholding of this case. Neither the language of Title IX nor its legislative history indicates that\n\nCongress intended to saddle school boards and officials with liability for student-student sexual\n\nharassment, and school boards had no notice that such liability would result from accepting Title IX\n\nfunds. For those reasons, I do join the holding of the Court and Parts I, II, III A, and IV of Judge\n\nTjoflat's opinion.\n\n      BARKETT, Circuit Judge, dissenting, in which HATCHETT, Chief Judge, and KRAVITCH\nand HENDERSON, Senior Circuit Judges, join:\n\n          In this case it is alleged that a fifth-grade student, Lashonda Davis, was sexually harassed\n\nfor over six months at school by another student, culminating in a sexual battery for which her\n\nharasser pled guilty in state court. It is also alleged that school officials were completely aware of\n\nthe escalating gravity of the situation and took no meaningful action to deter it. The majority holds\n\nthat no matter how egregious—or even criminal—the harassing discriminatory conduct may be, and\n\nno matter how cognizant of it supervisors may become—a teacher could observe it directly and\n\nregularly—there would be no obligation to take any action to prevent it under the very law which\n\nwas passed to eliminate sexual discrimination in our public schools. To reach this conclusion the\n\nmajority ignores the plain meaning of Title IX as well as its spirit and purpose. I suggest that under\n\nappropriate statutory analysis as well as Supreme Court precedent, Davis has stated a cause of\n\naction.\n\n          The first principle in statutory analysis requires that a statute be accorded the plain meaning\nof its text. It is well established that \"[c]ourts must assume that Congress intended the ordinary\n\nmeaning of the words it used, and absent a clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary, that\n\nlanguage is generally dispositive.\" Gonzalez v.

The identity of the perpetrator is simply irrelevant under the language: \"No\n\nperson ... shall ... be excluded from participation ..., be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to\n\ndiscrimination....\" Thus, under the statute's plain language, liability hinges upon whether the grant\n\nrecipient maintained an educational environment that excluded any person from participating, denied\n\nthem benefits, or subjected them to discrimination.\n\n        Should one need to interpret the statute, it must initially be noted that Title IX was designed\n\nto protect individuals from sex discrimination by denying federal financial aid to those educational\n\ninstitutions that bear responsibility for sexually discriminatory practices.

See Sexual Harassment Guidance: Harassment of\n\nStudents by School Employees, Other Students, or Third Parties, 62 Fed.Reg. 12,034, at 12,039-41\n\n(1997). The OCR's final policy guidance explains that:\n\n       a school's failure to respond to the existence of a hostile environment within its own\n       programs or activities permits an atmosphere of sexual discrimination to permeate the\n       educational program and results in discrimination prohibited by Title IX.... Thus, Title IX\n       does not make a school responsible for the actions of harassing students, but rather for its\n       own discrimination in failing to remedy it once the school has notice.\n\nId. at 12,039-40 (emphasis added).1\n\n   1\n    It is worth noting that the OCR's interpretation of Title IX as holding schools liable for\npermitting peer sexual harassment is consistent with its interpretation of Title VI of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d (1964), as holding schools liable for allowing peer racial\nharassment. This is significant because the Supreme Court has noted that \"Title IX was\npatterned after Title VI.\" Cannon, 441 U.S. at 694, 99 S.Ct. at 1956. As the majority points out,\nthe language of the two statutes is virtually identical, and the Supreme Court has held that they\nshould be interpreted in the same way. See Majority Op. at 3362-63 (citing Cannon, 441 U.S. at\n696, 99 S.Ct. at 1957-58). The OCR issued An Investigative Guidance on Racial Incidents and\nHarassment Against Students at Educational Institutions in 1994 providing, \"[T]he existence of a\nracially hostile environment that is created, encouraged, accepted, tolerated or left uncorrected\nby a recipient also constitutes different treatment on the basis of race in violation of Title VI.\"\nSee 59 Fed.Reg. 11,448, at 11,448 (1994). Furthermore, the OCR has stated that the obligation\nof school districts with notice to remedy racially hostile environments applies \"regardless of the\nidentity of the person(s) committing the harassment—a teacher, student, the grounds crew, a\ncafeteria worker, neighborhood teenagers, a visiting baseball team, a guest speaker, parents or\nothers.\" Id. at 11,450. As explained by the OCR:\n\n               Under this analysis, an alleged harasser need not be an agent or employee of the\n               recipient, because this theory of liability under Title VI is premised on a\n               recipient's general duty to provide a nondiscriminatory educational environment.\n\n       Id. at 11,449.\n\n                Additionally, it is interesting to note that shortly after the enactment of Title VI,\n       the former Fifth Circuit recognized that school officials must take steps within their\n       power to prevent racial harassment among students.

The\n\nmajority emphasizes that \"throughout this long legislative history, the drafters of Title IX never\n\ndiscussed student-student sexual harassment....\" See Majority Op. at 3360. Assuming this to be\n\ntrue, the mere fact that student-on-student sexual harassment may not have been specifically\n\nmentioned in the Congressional debates does not mean that it was not encompassed within\n\nCongress's broad intent of preventing students from being \"subjected to discrimination\" in federally\n\nfunded educational programs. The majority suggests that it is clear that Congress was not concerned\n\nwith student-on-student sexual harassment because the legislative history focused primarily on the\n\nissues of discrimination in \"admission[s],\" \"available services or studies,\" and \"employment within\n\nan institution,\" none of which were pertinent to the claim raised in this case. See Majority Op. at\n\n3358-59, 3360. However, under this narrow view, even the cause of action under Title IX for\n\nteacher-on-student sexual harassment recognized by the Supreme Court in Franklin, 503 U.S. at 60,\n\n112 S.Ct. at 1028-29, would not be supported by the majority's view of legislative history. In\n\nFranklin the Court considered a high-school student's Title IX suit alleging that a teacher had\n\nsexually harassed and assaulted her and that school officials, who had knowledge of the misconduct,\n\nhad failed to intervene. Id. at 63-64, 112 S.Ct. at 1031-32. Surely the majority would not suggest\n\nthat the cause of action that the Supreme Court recognized in Franklin does not exist simply because\n\nit was not specifically mentioned in the legislative history. Moreover, the majority's interpretation\n\n\n       letter and spirit of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\", Jefferson County, 380 F.2d at 390. The\n       decree provided in relevant part:\n\n               Within their authority school officials are responsible for the protection of\n               persons exercising rights under or otherwise affected by this decree. They shall,\n               without delay, take appropriate action with regard to any student or staff member\n               who interferes with the successful operation of the plan. Such interference shall\n               include harassment, intimidation, threats, hostile words or acts, and similar\n               behavior.\n\n       Id. at 392.\n\n                                                 40\n\fof the statute based on legislative history would suggest that by using the unqualified words\n\n\"discrimination under any education program\" Congress only intended to cover the narrow areas of\n\nadmissions, services, and employment. This contravenes both common sense and the plain meaning\n\nof the words of the statute.\n\n        Furthermore, the majority contends that Title IX may not be construed as authorizing a cause\n\nof action for a school board's failure to remedy student-on-student sexual harassment because such\n\nan interpretation would conflict with the notice of liability requirement of the Spending Clause,\n\nwhich is the constitutional provision under which Title IX was ostensibly enacted.2 See Majority\n\nOp. at 3362, 3364-65 (citing Pennhurst State School & Hospital v.

However, it is clear that the school board would have\n\nsufficient notice of liability based on the plain meaning of the statute, which unequivocally imposes\n\nliability on grant recipients for maintaining an educational environment in which students are\n\nsubjected to discrimination. Further, sufficient notice was provided to satisfy the Spending Clause\n\nprerequisite for a damages action under Title IX as set forth in Franklin, 503 U.S. at 74-75, 112\n\nS.Ct. at 1037-38. In Franklin the Court explained that the notice requirement for damages actions\n\nunder the Spending Clause in Title IX cases is satisfied where the alleged violation was intentional.\n\nId. The Court found that since sexual harassment constitutes intentional discrimination in violation\n\nof Title IX, the Spending Clause does not prohibit a cause of action for teacher-on-student sexual\n\nharassment under Title IX.

Thus, the applicable case law firmly supports applying Title\n\nVII principles to delineate the scope of a school board's liability under Title IX for failure to remedy\n\nstudent-on-student sexual harassment.\n\n        Notwithstanding this abundant support for applying Title VII principles, the majority\n\ncontends that Title VII principles may not be applied in this case because \"the exposition of liability\n\nunder Title VII depends upon agency principles.\" See Majority Op. at 3363 n. 13. The majority\n\nasserts that \"[a]gency principles are useless in discussing liability for student-student harassment\n\nunder Title IX, because students are not agents of the school board.\"4 Id.

The ability to control and influence behavior\nexists to an even greater extent in the classroom than in the workplace, as students look to their\nteachers for guidance as well as for protection. The damage caused by sexual harassment also is\narguably greater in the classroom than in the workplace, because the harassment has a greater\nand longer lasting impact on its young victims, and institutionalizes sexual harassment as\naccepted behavior. Moreover, \"[a] nondiscriminatory environment is essential to maximum\nintellectual growth and is therefore an integral part of the educational benefits that a student\n\n                                                46\n\fS.Ct. at 1037-38. Just as a working woman should not be required to \"run a gauntlet of sexual abuse\n\nin return for the privilege of being allowed to work and make a living,\" Meritor, 477 U.S. at 67, 106\n\nS.Ct. at 2405 (internal citation omitted), a female student should not be required to run a gauntlet\n\nof sexual abuse in return for the privilege of being allowed to obtain an education. In the\n\nemployment context, women historically have not had the power to simply walk away from an\n\nenvironment that is made to be demeaning, embarrassing, and humiliating for them because of their\n\ngender. Similarly, it is virtually impossible for female students to leave their assigned schools to\n\nescape an environment where they are harassed and intimidated on the basis of their gender. Just\n\nas in the employment setting where employees are dependent on their employers to ensure\n\nworkplace equality, so too students are dependent on teachers and school officials to control the\n\neducational environment. Additionally, sexual harassment—regardless of its source—subordinates\n\ngirls in the classroom just as much as in the workforce. Although a hostile environment can be\n\ncreated by someone who supervises or otherwise has power over the victim, a hostile environment\n\ncan also be created by co-workers or fellow students who have no direct power relationship\n\nwhatsoever with the victim.8 And like Title VII, Title IX was enacted to remedy that discrimination\n\nand ensure sexual equality in public education.\n\n       Having determined that Title VII principles should guide our analysis of the scope of the\n\nschool board's liability under Title IX, I conclude that Davis's allegations sufficiently plead a cause\n\n\nreceives.

The elements a plaintiff must prove to succeed in this type of sexual harassment case are:\n\n(1) that she is a member of a protected group; (2) that she was subject to unwelcome sexual\n\nharassment; (3) that the harassment was based on sex; (4) that the harassment was sufficiently\n\nsevere or pervasive so as to alter the conditions of her education and create an abusive educational\n\nenvironment; and (5) that some basis for institutional liability has been established.

There is no question that the allegations satisfy the first three\n\nrequirements. First, as a female, LaShonda is a member of a protected group. Second, she was\n\nsubject to unwelcome sexual harassment in the form of \"verbal and physical conduct of a sexual\n\nnature.\" 29 C.F.R. § 1604.11(a). Third, the harassment LaShonda faced clearly was on the basis\n\nof her sex.\n\n       As to the fourth requirement, I recognize that a hostile environment in an educational setting\n\nis not created by simple childish behavior or by an offensive utterance, comment, or vulgarity.\n\nRather, Title IX is violated \"[w]hen the [educational environment] is permeated with \"discriminatory\n\nintimidation, ridicule, and insult' that is \"sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of\nthe victim's [environment] and create an abusive environment,' \" Harris, 114 S.Ct. at 370, 510 U.S.\n\nat 21 (quoting Meritor, 477 U.S. at 65, 67, 106 S.Ct. at 2405-06) (internal citations omitted). In\n\ndetermining whether a plaintiff has established that an environment is hostile or abusive, a court\n\nmust be particularly concerned with (1) the frequency of the abusive conduct; (2) the conduct's\n\nseverity; (3) whether it is physically threatening or humiliating rather than merely offensive; and\n\n(4) whether it unreasonably interferes with the plaintiff's performance. Harris, 444 U.S. at 142-44,\n\n100 S.Ct. at 371. The Court has explained that these factors must be viewed both objectively and\n\nsubjectively. If the conduct is not so severe or pervasive that a reasonable person would find it\n\n\n                                                  48\n\fhostile or abusive, it is beyond Title IX's purview. Similarly, if the plaintiff does not subjectively\n\nperceive the environment to be abusive, then the conduct has not actually altered the conditions of\n\nher learning environment, and there is no Title IX violation. Id., 444 U.S. at 141-42, 100 S.Ct. at\n\n370.\n\n        In this case, the five months of alleged harassment was sufficiently severe and pervasive to\n\nhave altered the conditions of LaShonda's learning environment from both an objective and a\n\nsubjective standpoint: (1) G.F. engaged in abusive conduct toward LaShonda on at least eight\n\noccasions; (2) the conduct was sufficiently severe to result in criminal charges against G.F. to which\n\nhe pled guilty in state court; (3) the conduct, such as the groping and requests for sex, was\n\nphysically threatening and humiliating rather than merely offensive;            and (4) the conduct\n\nunreasonably interfered with LaShonda's academic performance, resulting in the substantial\n\ndeterioration of her grades and emotional health. The facts alleged go far beyond simple horseplay,\n\nchildish vulgarities, or adolescent flirting.\n\n        Finally, I believe that the fifth and final element—whether any basis for the Board's liability\n\nhas been shown, has likewise been sufficiently alleged. Under Title VII, an employer may be held\n\nliable for a hostile environment of sexual harassment created by a co-worker if \"the employer knew\n\nor should have known of the harassment in question and failed to take prompt remedial action.\"\n\nFaragher, 111 F.3d at 1538; Henson, 682 F.2d at 905; see also Meritor, 477 U.S. at 72-73, 106\nS.Ct. at 2408-09. By analogy, in this instance the school board may be held liable if it knew or\n\nshould have known of the harassment and failed to take timely remedial action. In Title VII cases,\n\nan employee can demonstrate that the employer knew of the harassment \"by showing that she\n\ncomplained to higher management of the harassment or by showing the pervasiveness of the\n\nharassment, which gives rise to the inference of knowledge or constructive knowledge.\" Henson,\n\n682 F.2d at 905. (citation omitted). In this case, Davis has alleged that she told the principal—a\n\nhigher level manager—of the harassment on several occasions. She also alleged that at least three\n\nseparate teachers, in addition to the principal, had actual and repetitive knowledge from LaShonda,\n\n\n                                                  49\n\fher mother and other students. Finally, Davis alleged that despite this knowledge, the school\n\nofficials failed to take prompt remedial action to end the harassment.9 These allegations regarding\n\ninstitutional liability, as well as the other allegations, are sufficient to establish a prima facie claim\n\nunder Title IX for sexual discrimination due to the Board's failure to take action to remedy a\n\nsexually hostile environment.\n\n        For all the foregoing reasons, I would reverse the district court's dismissal of Davis's Title\n\nIX claim against the Board.\n\n\n\n\n   9\n    The complaint also alleged that during the time of the harassment, the Board had no policy\nprohibiting the sexual harassment of students in its schools, and had not provided any policies or\ntraining to its employees on how to respond to student-on-student sexual harassment.\n\n                                                   50\n\f</pre>",
