Hightower presently attends an all-Negro public high school located a substantially greater distance from his home than the all-white high school.  A Scholastic Transfer Application required by the District was obtained and executed, seeking transfer to the all-white school on the ground that the travel resultant from assignment to the all-Negro school is costly, hazardous, inconvenient, and unnecessary in light of the proximity of the all-white school; this application was rejected.  Hightower then brought suit under 42 U.S.C. 1983 and 28 U.S.C. 1343(3), asserting that he is entitled to attend the school nearest his residence; that he is unable to do so; and that his application for transfer was denied solely because of his race.  The suit was not brought as a class action but only to enforce Hightower's individual rights.  The District filed a motion to dismiss, noting that the segregation policies and practices of the District had been previously attacked and set aside in Houston Independent School District v. Ross.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Ross was a class action brought in behalf of the Negro plaintiffs therein and 'in behalf of all other Negro minors who are similarly situated'.  It was argued below (and is again argued here) that the Ross complainants represented all Negro minors, including Hightower; that the rights asserted by Hightower in this suit were presented in Ross; that the judgment in Ross is final and binding on Hightower; and that therefore the district court is without jurisdiction of the present case.  The district court agreed and ordered the complaint dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The narrow issue before us is whether the district court had and has jurisdiction to consider this case.
