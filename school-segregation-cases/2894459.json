Factual Background1\n\n      Poway High School (“the School”) has had a history of conflict among its\n\nstudents over issues of sexual orientation. In 2003, the School permitted a student\n\ngroup called the Gay-Straight Alliance to hold a “Day of Silence” at the School\n\nwhich, in the words of an Assistant Principal, is intended to “teach tolerance of\n\nothers, particularly those of a different sexual orientation.”2 During the days\n\nsurrounding the 2003 “Day of Silence,”3 a series of incidents and altercations\n\noccurred on the school campus as a result of anti-homosexual comments that were\n\nmade by students. One such confrontation required the Principal to separate\n\nstudents physically. According to David LeMaster, a teacher at Poway, several\n\nstudents were suspended as a result of these conflicts. Moreover, a week or so\n\nafter the “Day of Silence,” a group of heterosexual students informally organized a\n\n      1\n        These background facts are based on the limited record before us which\nincludes five declarations by school officials, and declarations from Harper, his\nfather, Ron Harper, and a fellow student, Joel Rhine.\n      2\n      In his complaint, Harper alleges that he believes “the true purpose” of the\n“Day of Silence” was “to endorse, promote and encourage homosexual activity.”\n      3\n        On the “Day of Silence,” participating students wore duct tape over their\nmouths to symbolize the silencing effect of intolerance upon gays and lesbians;\nthese students would not speak in class except through a designated representative.\nSome students wore black T-shirts that said “National Day of Silence” and\ncontained a purple square with a yellow equal sign in the middle. The Gay-\nStraight Alliance, with the permission of the School, also put up several posters\npromoting awareness of harassment on the basis of sexual orientation.\n                                          3\n\f“Straight-Pride Day,” during which they wore T-shirts which displayed derogatory\n\nremarks about homosexuals. According to Assistant Principal Lynell Antrim,\n\nsome students were asked to remove the shirts and did so, while others “had an\n\naltercation and were suspended for their actions.”\n\n      Because of these conflicts in 2003, when the Gay-Straight Alliance sought to\n\nhold another “Day of Silence” in 2004, the School required the organization to\n\nconsult with the Principal to “problem solve” and find ways to reduce tensions and\n\npotential altercations. On April 21, 2004, the date of the 2004 “Day of Silence,”\n\nappellant Tyler Chase Harper wore a T-shirt to school on which “I WILL NOT\n\nACCEPT WHAT GOD HAS CONDEMNED,” was handwritten on the front and\n\n“HOMOSEXUALITY IS SHAMEFUL ‘Romans 1:27’” was handwritten on the\n\nback. There is no evidence in the record that any school staff saw Harper’s T-shirt\n\non that day.\n\n      The next day, April 22, 2004, Harper wore the same T-shirt to school, except\n\nthat the front of the shirt read “BE ASHAMED, OUR SCHOOL EMBRACED\n\nWHAT GOD HAS CONDEMNED,” while the back retained the same message as\n\nbefore, “HOMOSEXUALITY IS SHAMEFUL ‘Romans 1:27.’”4 LeMaster,\n\nHarper’s second period teacher, noticed Harper’s shirt and observed “several\n\n\n      4\n       A copy of a photograph of the T-shirt is attached as Exhibit A.\n                                         4\n\fstudents off-task talking about” the shirt. LeMaster, recalling the altercations that\n\nerupted as a result of “anti-homosexual speech” during the previous year’s “Day of\n\nSilence,” explained to Harper that he believed that the shirt was “inflammatory,”\n\nthat it violated the School’s dress code, and that it “created a negative and hostile\n\nworking environment for others.” When Harper refused to remove his shirt and\n\nasked to speak to an administrator, LeMaster gave him a dress code violation card\n\nto take to the front office.\n\n       When Harper arrived at the front office, he met Assistant Principal Antrim.\n\nShe told Harper that the “Day of Silence” was “not about the school promoting\n\nhomosexuality but rather it was a student activity trying to raise other students’\n\nawareness regarding tolerance in their judgement [sic] of others.” Antrim believed\n\nthat Harper’s shirt “was inflammatory under the circumstances and could cause\n\ndisruption in the educational setting.” Like LeMaster, she also recalled the\n\naltercations that had arisen as a result of anti-homosexual speech one year prior.\n\nAccording to her affidavit, she “discussed [with Harper] ways that he and students\n\nof his faith could bring a positive light onto this issue without the condemnation\n\nthat he displayed on his shirt.” Harper was informed that if he removed the shirt he\n\ncould return to class.\n\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\f      When Harper again refused to remove his shirt, the Principal, Scott Fisher,\n\nspoke with him, explaining his concern that the shirt was “inflammatory” and that\n\nit was the School’s “intent to avoid physical conflict on campus.” Fisher also\n\nexplained to Harper that it was not healthy for students to be addressed in such a\n\nderogatory manner. According to Fisher, Harper informed him that he had already\n\nbeen “confronted by a group of students on campus” and was “involved in a tense\n\nverbal conversation” earlier that morning.5 The Principal eventually decided that\n\nHarper could not wear his shirt on campus, a decision that, he asserts, was\n\ninfluenced by “the fact that during the previous year, there was tension on campus\n\nsurrounding the Day of Silence between certain gay and straight students.”6 Fisher\n\nproposed some alternatives to wearing the shirt, all of which Harper turned down.\n\nHarper asked two times to be suspended. Fisher “told him that [he] did not want\n\n\n      5\n       In his affidavit, Harper characterized these conversations with other\nstudents as “peaceful discussions wherein differing viewpoints were\ncommunicated.”\n      6\n         We note that conflicts over homosexuality at Poway High School have not\nbeen limited to the incidents surrounding a “Day of Silence.” Two former students\nrecently won a suit against the School for failing to protect them from students who\nharassed them because they are gay. See Dana Littlefield, Two Gay Students Were\nHarassed, Jury Finds, San Diego Union-Trib., June 9, 2005, at B2. During the\ntrial, one of the students testified that Poway “students repeatedly called him\nnames, shoved him in the hallways, threw food at him and spit on him,” and “that\nhe heard other students make disparaging remarks about gays and lesbians on a\nnearly daily basis.” Id.\n                                          6\n\fhim suspended from school, nor did [he] want him to have something in his\n\ndisciplinary record because of a stance he felt strongly about.” Instead, Fisher told\n\nHarper that he would be required to remain in the front office for the remainder of\n\nthe school day.\n\n      Harper spent the rest of the day in the school conference room doing his\n\nhomework. At some point during that day, Deputy Sheriff Norman Hubbert, who\n\nserved as the school resource officer for Poway High, came in to speak with\n\nHarper.7 The complaint alleges that Hubbert “came to interrogate” Harper to\n\n“determine if he was a dangerous student.” Hubbert, however, asserts in his\n\naffidavit that he and Harper had a “casual conversation concerning the content of\n\nthe shirt . . . the Bible and [the] scripture reference on the shirt,” and that the\n\nconversation was conducted “simpl[y out of] curiosity . . . to understand the\n\nsituation.”\n\n      Toward the end of the school day, Assistant Principal Ed Giles spoke with\n\nHarper. Giles had discovered earlier in the day that Harper attended the same\n\n\n\n      7\n       Hubbert, who is a detective with the San Diego County Sheriff, was on\ncampus that day because someone, purporting to be a parent, had called the School\nthat morning complaining about the School’s “condoning” the “Day of Silence”\nand stated that “he and several other parents had ‘had it’ and ‘would be doing\nsomething about it.’” Concerned about safety, Principal Fisher had requested\nHubbert’s presence on campus on that day.\n                                            7\n\fchurch that he had previously attended, and that he “knew [Harper’s] father\n\npersonally and had attended Biblical studies that [Harper’s] father led on Tuesday\n\nnights.” According to Giles, he went to speak with Harper “out of respect to\n\n[Harper] and his family” and “to make sure he was alright.” Giles told Harper that\n\nhe understood “where he was coming from” but wished that he could “express\n\nhimself in a more positive way.” Giles also said that he shared the same Christian\n\nfaith as Harper, but that as a school employee, he had to watch how he expressed\n\nhis beliefs and that when he came to work, he had to “leave his faith in [the] car.”\n\nGiles then asked Harper to “consider other alternatives that would be more positive\n\nand non-confrontational,” including sponsoring activities through the campus Bible\n\nClub.\n\n        After his conversation with Giles, Harper remained in the office for the last\n\nperiod of the day, after which he was instructed to proceed directly off campus.\n\nHarper was not suspended, no disciplinary record was placed in his file, and he\n\nreceived full attendance credit for the day.\n\n                               II. Procedural History\n\n        On June 2, 2004, Harper filed a lawsuit in district court against Poway\n\nUnified School District and certain named individuals in their individual and\n\nofficial capacities. Harper alleged five federal causes of action – violations of his\n\n\n                                           8\n\fright to free speech, his right to free exercise of religion, the Establishment Clause,\n\nthe Equal Protection Clause, and the Due Process Clause – and one state law claim\n\nbased on California Civil Code § 52.1, which creates a private cause of action for\n\nthe violation of individual federal and state constitutional rights. On June 22,\n\n2004, the School filed a motion to dismiss, and on July 12, 2004, Harper filed a\n\nmotion for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the school from “continuing\n\n[its] violation of the constitutional rights of Plaintiff Tyler Chase Harper.” On\n\nNovember 4, 2004, the district court granted the School’s motion to dismiss as to\n\nHarper’s equal protection, due process,8 and state law claims, but denied the\n\nmotion as to his three First Amendment claims: freedom of speech, free exercise of\n\nreligion, and establishment of religion. The district court also granted the School’s\n\nmotion to dismiss Harper’s damages claims against Poway Unified School District\n\nand the individual defendants on the ground of qualified immunity. Finally, the\n\ndistrict court denied Harper’s motion for a preliminary injunction. Harper then\n\nfiled an interlocutory appeal from the order denying the latter motion.9\n\n\n      8\n       The district court dismissed with prejudice only Harper’s due process\nchallenge.\n      9\n       We note that on November 17, 2004, thirteen days after the district court\nrendered its decision and two days prior to filing his Notice of Appeal with this\ncourt, Harper filed a First Amended Verified Complaint adding his sister, Kelsie,\n                                                                       (continued...)\n                                           9\n\f                                  III. Jurisdiction\n\n      We have jurisdiction to review the district court’s denial of the preliminary\n\ninjunction motion under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1).\n\n                        IV. Standard and Scope of Review\n\n      For a district court to grant a preliminary injunction, the moving party must\n\ndemonstrate either “(1) a combination of probable success on the merits and the\n\npossibility of irreparable harm; or (2) that serious questions are raised and the\n\nbalance of hardships tips in its favor.” A & M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 239\n\nF.3d 1004, 1013 (9th Cir. 2001). “Each of these two formulations requires an\n\nexamination of both the potential merits of the asserted claims and the harm or\n\nhardships faced by the parties.” Sammartano v. First Judicial Dist. Court, 303\n\nF.3d 959, 965 (9th Cir. 2002). “These two alternatives represent extremes of a\n\nsingle continuum, rather than two separate tests.” Sun Microsystems, Inc. v.\n\nMicrosoft Corp., 188 F.3d 1115, 1119 (9th Cir. 1999) (citation and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). Accordingly, “the greater the relative hardship to the\n\n\n\n\n      9\n        (...continued)\nwho is a freshman at Poway High School, as a plaintiff. On February 23, 2005, the\ndistrict court granted in part and denied in part the School’s motion to dismiss the\nFirst Amended Complaint. Because the amended complaint is not before this court\non appeal, we limit our review to Harper.\n                                          10\n\fmoving party, the less probability of success must be shown.” Id. (citation and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      The district court concluded, and the School concedes on appeal, that\n\nbecause Harper’s First Amendment claims survived the motion to dismiss, Harper\n\nmade the necessary showing of irreparable harm. See Sammartano, 303 F.3d at\n\n973 (internal quotation marks omitted) (“[A] party seeking preliminary injunctive\n\nrelief in a First Amendment context can establish irreparable injury sufficient to\n\nmerit the grant of relief by demonstrating the existence of a colorable First\n\nAmendment claim.”). The balance of hardships does not, however, tip in his\n\nfavor.10 Therefore, the question is whether Harper demonstrated a likelihood of\n\nsuccess on the merits as to any or all of his three First Amendment claims.\n\n      We review a district court’s grant or denial of a preliminary injunction for\n\nabuse of discretion. A & M Records, Inc., 239 F.3d at 1013. We will reverse “only\n\nwhere the district court abused its discretion or based its decision on an erroneous\n\nlegal standard or on clearly erroneous findings of fact.” El Pollo Loco, Inc. v.\n\n\n      10\n         The district court concluded that “balancing the needs of the School to\nkeep all their students safe coupled with the foreseeable vision that other students\nmay feel free to exhibit these types of expressions that would interfere with the\nwork of the school and violate the rights of others against [Harper’s] interests does\nnot tip the scales sharply in [Harper’s] favor.” As our analysis of Tinker below\nillustrates, not only does the balance of hardships not tip sharply in Harper’s favor,\nbut it does not tip in his favor at all.\n                                          11\n\fHashim, 316 F.3d 1032, 1038 (9th Cir. 2003) (citation and internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). Where, as here, the appellant does not dispute the district court’s\n\nfactual findings, we are required to determine “whether the court employed the\n\nappropriate legal standards governing the issuance of a preliminary injunction and\n\nwhether the district court correctly apprehended the law with respect to the\n\nunderlying issues in the case.” A & M Records, Inc., 239 F.3d at 1013 (internal\n\nquotation and citation omitted). The district court’s interpretation of the\n\nunderlying legal principles is subject to de novo review. Id. We may affirm the\n\ndistrict court’s order “on any ground supported by the record even if it differs from\n\nthe rationale of the district court.” Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n v. United States Army\n\nCorps of Eng’rs, 384 F.3d 1163, 1170 (9th Cir. 2004).\n\n                                     V. Analysis\n\n1.    Freedom of Speech Claim\n\n      The district court concluded that Harper failed to demonstrate a likelihood of\n\nsuccess on the merits of his claim that the School violated his First Amendment\n\nright to free speech because, under Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist.,\n\nthe evidence in the record was sufficient to permit the school officials to\n\n“reasonably . . . forecast substantial disruption of or material interference with\n\nschool activities.” 393 U.S. 503, 514 (1969). Harper contends that the district\n\n\n                                          12\n\fcourt erred in rejecting his free speech claim on three grounds: (1) his speech is\n\nprotected under the Supreme Court’s holdings in Tinker and Bethel Sch. Dist. v.\n\nFraser, 478 U.S. 675 (1986); (2) the School’s actions and policies amount to\n\nviewpoint discrimination under Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va.,\n\n515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995); and (3) the School’s dress code and speech policies are\n\noverbroad under Bd. of Airport Comm’rs of Los Angeles v. Jews for Jesus, Inc.,\n\n482 U.S. 569, 574 (1987).11 We affirm the district court’s denial of the requested\n\n      11\n         We need not rule upon the validity of the School’s dress code or other anti-\nharassment policies in order to determine whether the district court abused its\ndiscretion in denying the preliminary injunction. Harper’s motion for a\npreliminary injunction sought only to enjoin school officials “from continuing their\nviolation of the constitutional rights of Plaintiff Tyler Chase Harper.” The only\nviolation alleged was that Harper was precluded from wearing his T-shirt with its\ndemeaning message while at school. The motion did not seek to enjoin the\nenforcement of the School’s dress code or any other school policies against any\nand all students, but sought only to stop the violation of Harper’s purported\nconstitutional right to wear his T-shirt. Our affirmance of the district court order\ndoes not depend upon the existence of a valid school policy or code. Under Tinker,\nthe School is permitted to prohibit Harper’s conduct, with or without a valid anti-\nharassment or other policy, if it can demonstrate that the restriction was necessary\nto prevent either the violation of the rights of other students or substantial\ndisruption of school activities. The record is clear that even though Harper’s\nteacher and Vice Principal Antrim stated that the T-shirt violated the dress code,\nthe school officials made plain to Harper that the reason he could not wear the T-\nshirt was because of its effect upon other students and its disruptive effect upon the\neducational environment, rather than because it was prohibited by a dress code.\nThe district judge apparently concluded that the validity of the School’s anti-\nharassment policies was not before him, or that it was not necessary to decide that\nquestion, and we cannot say that his determination was unreasonable. Finally, we\n                                                                          (continued...)\n                                          13\n\fpreliminary injunction. Although we, like the district court, rely on Tinker, we rely\n\non a different provision – that schools may prohibit speech that “intrudes upon . . .\n\nthe rights of other students.” Tinker, 393 U.S. at 508.\n\n      a.     Student Speech Under Tinker\n\n       Public schools are places where impressionable young persons spend much\n\nof their time while growing up. They do so in order to receive what society hopes\n\nwill be a fair and full education – an education without which they will almost\n\ncertainly fail in later life, likely sooner rather than later. See Brown v. Bd. of Educ.,\n\n347 U.S. 483, 493 (1954) (“[I]t is doubtful that any child may reasonably be\n\nexpected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education.”). The\n\npublic school, with its free education, is the key to our democracy. See id. (stating\n\nthat public education “is the very foundation of good citizenship”). Almost all\n\n\n\n\n      11\n         (...continued)\nwould prefer not to make even a preliminary judgment as to the constitutionality of\nthe School’s dress code or anti-harassment policies without the district court first\nhaving considered the question. Of course, following remand, the district court\nmay do so at the appropriate time or upon the appropriate motion. In contrast, our\ndissenting colleague would have us engage on appeal in a sweeping examination\nab initio of the validity of a complicated series of policies – an examination that\nwould cause us to discuss prematurely a number of controversial constitutional\nissues. See dis. op. at 22-36. We see no need for such an exercise of our\njurisdiction on this appeal.\n\n\n                                           14\n\fyoung Americans attend public schools.12 During the time they do – from first\n\ngrade through twelfth – students are discovering what and who they are. Often,\n\nthey are insecure. Generally, they are vulnerable to cruel, inhuman, and prejudiced\n\ntreatment by others.\n\n      The courts have construed the First Amendment as applied to public schools\n\nin a manner that attempts to strike a balance between the free speech rights of\n\nstudents and the special need to maintain a safe, secure and effective learning\n\nenvironment. See, e.g., Tinker, 393 U.S. at 507 (balancing the need for\n\n“scrupulous protection of Constitutional freedoms of the individual” against the\n\nneed of schools to perform their proper educational function). This court has\n\nexpressly recognized the need for such balance: “States have a compelling interest\n\nin their educational system, and a balance must be met between the First\n\nAmendment rights of students and preservation of the educational process.”\n\nLaVine v. Blaine Sch. Dist., 257 F.3d 981, 988 (9th Cir. 2001). Although public\n\n\n      12\n        As of the fall of 2005, approximately eighty-eight percent of elementary\nand secondary students in the United States attended public schools. See DIGEST\nOF EDUCATION STATISTICS, 2004, NAT’L CTR. FOR EDUC. STATISTICS (2004),\navailable at http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d04/. Most of the rest attended\nreligious schools. See STEPHEN P. BROUGHMAN & KATHLEEN W. PUGH,\nCHARACTERISTICS OF PRIVATE SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES: RESULTS FROM\nTHE 2001–2002 PRIVATE SCHOOL UNIVERSE SURVEY (U.S. Department of\nEducation, National Center for Education Statistics) (2005).\n\n\n                                         15\n\fschool students do not “shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or\n\nexpression at the schoolhouse gate,” Tinker, 393 U.S. at 506, the Supreme Court\n\nhas declared that “the First Amendment rights of students in public schools are not\n\nautomatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings, and must be\n\napplied in light of the special characteristics of the school environment.”13\n\nHazelwood Sch. Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260, 266 (1988) (internal citation and\n\nquotation marks omitted). Thus, while Harper’s shirt embodies the very sort of\n\npolitical speech that would be afforded First Amendment protection outside of the\n\npublic school setting, his rights in the case before us must be determined “in light\n\nof [those] special characteristics.” Tinker, 393 U.S. at 506.\n\n      This court has identified “three distinct areas of student speech,” each of\n\nwhich is governed by different Supreme Court precedent: (1) vulgar, lewd,\n\nobscene, and plainly offensive speech which is governed by Fraser,14 (2) school-\n\n\n      13\n         Although Harper correctly points out that California law provides greater\nprotection for student speech than federal law, see Cal. Educ. Code § 48950(a), he\ndid not raise a state law claim in his preliminary injunction motion before the\ndistrict court. Nor did he question, as he does in his brief to us, the\nconstitutionality of the correlative provisions of the California Education Code that\nprovide greater protection than federal law against harassment of students on the\nbasis of sexual orientation. See Cal. Educ. Code §§ 200, 201, 220. Accordingly,\nwe do not rely on or resolve any state law questions here.\n      14\n        Because we decide Harper’s free speech claim on the basis of Tinker, we\n                                                                     (continued...)\n                                          16\n\fsponsored speech which is governed by Hazelwood,15 and (3) all other speech\n\nwhich is governed by Tinker. Chandler v. McMinnville Sch. Dist., 978 F.2d 524,\n\n529 (9th Cir. 1992) (internal citations omitted).\n\n      In Tinker, the Supreme Court confirmed a student’s right to free speech in\n\npublic schools.16 In balancing that right against the state interest in maintaining an\n\nordered and effective public education system, however, the Court declared that a\n\nstudent’s speech rights could be curtailed under two circumstances. First, a school\n\nmay regulate student speech that would “impinge upon the rights of other\n\nstudents.” Tinker, 393 U.S. at 509. Second, a school may prohibit student speech\n\nthat would result in “substantial disruption of or material interference with school\n\nactivities.” Id. at 514. Because, as we explain below, the School’s prohibition of\n\nthe wearing of the demeaning T-shirt is constitutionally permissible under the first\n\nof the Tinker prongs, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion\n\n\n\n      14\n       (...continued)\nneed not consider whether his speech was “plainly offensive” under Fraser.\n      15\n        Neither party here claims that Harper’s speech is “school-sponsored” and\nthus governed by Hazelwood.\n      16\n         In Tinker, the Supreme Court held that a public school could not ban\nstudents from wearing black armbands protesting the Vietnam war where the\n“silent, passive expression of opinion [was] unaccompanied by any disorder or\ndisturbance,” and there was no evidence that the display “colli[ded] with the rights\nof other students to be secure and to be let alone.” 393 U.S. at 508.\n                                          17\n\fin finding that Harper failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of\n\nhis free speech claim.17\n\n             i.     The Rights of Other Students\n\n      In Tinker, the Supreme Court held that public schools may restrict student\n\nspeech which “intrudes upon . . . the rights of other students” or “colli[des] with\n\nthe rights of other students to be secure and to be let alone.” 393 U.S. at 508.\n\nHarper argues that Tinker’s reference to the “rights of other students” should be\n\nconstrued narrowly to involve only circumstances in which a student’s right to be\n\nfree from direct physical confrontation is infringed. Drawing on the Fifth Circuit’s\n\nopinion in Blackwell v. Issaquena County Bd. of Ed., 363 F.2d 749, 751 (5th Cir.\n\n1966), which the Supreme Court cited in Tinker, Harper contends that because the\n\n\n      17\n         The first part of our colleague’s dissent is devoted to a discussion of\nwhether there was sufficient evidence that the wearing of Harper’s T-shirt caused\nsubstantial disruption, the Tinker prong on which the district court relied but which\nis not relevant to our holding. See dis. op. at 3-9. The last part of the dissent also\ndeals with a subject we need not and do not address: what the dissent terms the\nSchool’s “harassment policy.” Id. at 22-36; see also supra n. 11. Oddly, the\ndissent spends only a relatively minor part of its discussion on the determinative\nissue here, the impermissible intrusion on the rights of gay and lesbian students.\nId. at 13-22. Even more oddly, in its Conclusion the dissent suggests that speech\nthat is fundamentally offensive to minority students may be constitutionally limited\nand quarrels only with whether such a limitation is consistent with the wording of\nTinker. Id. at 36-37. It also suggests that the Supreme Court might properly\nmodify Tinker and validate our holding. Id. at 37. We disagree that any\nmodification of Tinker is required or desirable. All that is necessary is a fair\nreading of its plain language, as we explain in the following section.\n                                          18\n\fspeakers in Blackwell “accosted other students by pinning the buttons on them\n\neven though they did not ask for one,” a student must be physically accosted in\n\norder to have his rights infringed.\n\n      Notwithstanding the facts of Blackwell, the law does not support Harper’s\n\nargument. This court has explained that vulgar, lewd, obscene, indecent, and\n\nplainly offensive speech “by definition, may well ‘impinge[] upon the rights of\n\nother students,’” even if the speaker does not directly accost individual students\n\nwith his remarks. Chandler, 978 F.2d at 529 (quoting Tinker, 393 U.S. at 509). So\n\ntoo may other speech capable of causing psychological injury. The Tenth Circuit\n\nhas held that the “display of the Confederate flag might . . . interfere with the rights\n\nof other students to be secure and let alone,” even though there was no indication\n\nthat any student was physically accosted with the flag, aside from its general\n\ndisplay. West v. Derby Unified Sch. Dist., 206 F.3d 1358, 1366 (10th Cir. 2000).\n\nWhile “[t]he precise scope of Tinker’s ‘interference with the rights of others’\n\nlanguage is unclear,” Saxe v. State Coll. Area Sch. Dist., 240 F.3d 200, 217 (3rd\n\nCir. 2001), we unequivocally reject Harper’s overly narrow reading of the phrase.\n\n      We conclude that Harper’s wearing of his T-shirt “colli[des] with the rights\n\nof other students” in the most fundamental way. Tinker, 393 U.S. at 508. Public\n\nschool students who may be injured by verbal assaults on the basis of a core\n\n\n                                           19\n\fidentifying characteristic such as race, religion, or sexual orientation, have a right\n\nto be free from such attacks while on school campuses. As Tinker clearly states,\n\nstudents have the right to “be secure and to be let alone.” Id. Being secure\n\ninvolves not only freedom from physical assaults but from psychological attacks\n\nthat cause young people to question their self-worth and their rightful place in\n\nsociety.18 The “right to be let alone” has been recognized by the Supreme Court, of\n\ncourse, as “‘the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by\n\ncivilized men.’” Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703, 716-17 (2000) (quoting Olmstead\n\nv. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 478 (1928) (Brandeis, J., dissenting)). Indeed, the\n\n“recognizable privacy interest in avoiding unwanted communication” is perhaps\n\nmost important “when persons are ‘powerless to avoid’ it.” Id. at 716 (quoting\n\nCohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15, 21-22 (1971)). Because minors are subject to\n\nmandatory attendance requirements, the Court has emphasized “the obvious\n\nconcern on the part of parents, and school authorities acting in loco parentis, to\n\nprotect children – especially in a captive audience . . . .” Fraser, 478 U.S. at 684.\n\n\n      18\n         There is nothing in Tinker that remotely supports the dissent’s contention\nthat the rights to “be secure and to be let alone” are limited to rights such as those\nthat protect against “assault, defamation, invasion of privacy, extortion and\nblackmail.” Dis. op. at 14. Security and privacy entail far more than freedom from\nthose torts. Nor does the dissent offer any reason why the rights to security and\nprivacy do not include freedom from verbal assaults that cause psychological\ninjury to young people.\n                                          20\n\fAlthough name-calling is ordinarily protected outside the school context,\n\n“[s]tudents cannot hide behind the First Amendment to protect their ‘right’ to\n\nabuse and intimidate other students at school.” Sypniewski v. Warren Hills Reg’l\n\nBd. of Educ., 307 F.3d 243, 264 (3rd Cir. 2002).\n\n      Speech that attacks high school students who are members of minority\n\ngroups that have historically been oppressed, subjected to verbal and physical\n\nabuse, and made to feel inferior, serves to injure and intimidate them, as well as to\n\ndamage their sense of security and interfere with their opportunity to learn.19 The\n\ndemeaning of young gay and lesbian students in a school environment is\n\ndetrimental not only to their psychological health and well-being, but also to their\n\neducational development. Indeed, studies demonstrate that “academic\n\nunderachievement, truancy, and dropout are prevalent among homosexual youth\n\nand are the probable consequences of violence and verbal and physical abuse at\n\nschool.” Susanne M. Stronski Huwiler and Gary Remafedi, Adolescent\n\nHomosexuality, 33 REV. JUR. U.I.P.R. 151, 164 (1999); see also Thomas A. Mayes,\n\n\n\n      19\n        California law provides that “[a]ll pupils have the right to participate fully\nin the educational process, free from discrimination and harassment.” Cal. Educ.\nCode § 201(a). The dissent expostulates on the meaning of the term “harassment”\nand speculates as to whether the California statute may be contrary to the First\nAmendment, all of which is irrelevant here because we do not rely on the statute in\nreaching our decision.

L. REV. 67, 76-77\n\n(1994) (describing how abuse by peers causes gay youth to experience social\n\nisolation and drop out of school). In short, it is well established that attacks on\n\nstudents on the basis of their sexual orientation are harmful not only to the\n\nstudents’ health and welfare, but also to their educational performance and their\n\nultimate potential for success in life.\n\n      Those who administer our public educational institutions need not tolerate\n\nverbal assaults that may destroy the self-esteem of our most vulnerable teenagers\n\nand interfere with their educational development.20 See Muller by Muller v.\n\nJefferson Lighthouse Sch., 98 F.3d 1530, 1540 (7th Cir. 1996) (stating that\n\nelementary schools may restrict speech “that could crush a child’s sense of\n\nself-worth”); Saxe, 240 F.3d at 217 (observing that speech that “substantially\n\n\n      20\n        In fact, California schools like Poway High are required by law “to\nminimize and eliminate a hostile environment on school grounds that impairs the\naccess of pupils to equal educational opportunity.” Cal. Educ. Code § 201(f).\n                                          23\n\finterfer[es] with a student’s educational performance” may satisfy the Tinker\n\nstandard).21 To the contrary, the School had a valid and lawful basis for restricting\n\nHarper’s wearing of his T-shirt on the ground that his conduct was injurious to gay\n\nand lesbian students and interfered with their right to learn.22\n\n      The dissent claims that we should not take notice of the fact that gay\n\nstudents are harmed by derogatory messages such as Harper’s because there is no\n\n\n\n      21\n         Saxe considered the validity of a school district’s anti-harassment policy, a\nquestion we do not address here. See supra n.11. Although in its discussion of a\nprovision regarding “hostile environment,” Saxe briefly alludes to the “interference\nwith the rights of others” prong of Tinker, it appears to conflate that prong with the\n“substantial disruption” prong and to suggest, perhaps inadvertently, that injurious\nslurs may not be prohibited unless they also cause substantial disruption. See Saxe,\n240 F.3d at 217. That clearly is not the case. The two Tinker prongs are stated in\nthe alternative. See Tinker, 393 U.S. at 508. We agree, however, with Saxe’s\nconclusion that “it is certainly not enough that the speech is merely offensive to\nsome listener.” Saxe, 240 F.3d at 217.\n      22\n          As noted supra, California law explicitly recognizes the right of students\nto be free from harassment on the basis of sexual orientation. See Cal. Educ. Code\n§ 200, 201. These provisions were enacted not in a vacuum, but out of a\nrecognition on the part of the state legislature of “an urgent need to prevent and\nrespond to acts of hate violence and bias-related incidents that are occurring at an\nincreasing rate in California’s public schools.” Id. at § 201(d). We also observe\nthat federal law provides public school students some protection against\nharassment and discriminatory treatment based on sexual orientation. For\nexample, in Flores v. Morgan Hill Unified Sch. Dist., 324 F.3d 1130, 1134-35 (9th\nCir. 2003), we held that the Equal Protection Clause protects against school\ndistricts’ indifference to certain kinds of negative speech aimed at gay students.\nSee also Mayes, supra, at 643 (observing that harassment based on sexual\norientation may be actionable under Title IX as harassment based on sex).\n                                          24\n\f“evidence” that they are in fact injured by being shamed or humiliated by their\n\npeers. See dis. op. at 15-18. It is simply not a novel concept, however, that such\n\nattacks on young minority students can be harmful to their self-esteem and to their\n\nability to learn. As long ago as in Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme\n\nCourt recognized that “[a] sense of inferiority affects the motivation of a child to\n\nlearn.” 347 U.S. at 494 (internal quotation marks omitted). If a school permitted\n\nits students to wear shirts reading, “Negroes: Go Back To Africa,” no one would\n\ndoubt that the message would be harmful to young black students. So, too, in the\n\ncase of gay students, with regard to messages such as those written on Harper’s T-\n\nshirt.23 As our dissenting colleague recently concluded, “[y]ou don’t need an\n\nexpert witness to figure out” the self-evident effect of certain policies or messages.\n\nJespersen v. Harrah’s Operating Co., Inc., No. 03-15045, 2006 WL 962533, at\n\n*13 (9th Cir. April 14, 2006) (Kozinski, Circuit Judge, dissenting). Just as Judge\n\n\n      23\n          There is much literature to this effect. See supra pp. 21-23. Our dissenting\ncolleague’s notion of “evidence” appears to be rather odd. It seems to consist\nlargely of motion pictures and television shows. The dissent draws conclusions\nthat it is “not unusual in a high school classroom for students to be ‘off-task’” and\nthat politics and other subjects “are the ordinary subjects of discourse in high\nschool corridors” on the basis of our colleague’s viewing of a number of popular\nentertainment features. See dis. op. at 4 n.2 & 5 n.3. Perhaps he would prefer us to\ncite Brokeback Mountain (Paramount Pictures 2005) or The Matthew Shepard\nStory (2002), as evidence of the harmful effects of anti-gay harassment rather than\nsimply stating that which, to anyone familiar with or in any way sensitive to, the\nhistory or effect of discrimination, is a self-evident fact.\n                                          25\n\fKozinski found it to be “perfectly clear” – without the aid of any evidence in the\n\nrecord – that an employer’s makeup requirement burdened women, the fact that\n\nHarper’s demeaning statement is harmful to gay students at Poway High “hardly\n\nseem[s] like [a] question[] reasonably subject to dispute.” Id. at *12. One would\n\nthink that if we should be able to take notice of how long it takes women to put on\n\nmakeup, or that makeup is an expensive item, we can certainly take notice that it is\n\nharmful to gay teenagers to be publicly degraded and called immoral and\n\nshameful.24 Certainly, the California legislature had no difficulty in determining\n\nthat harassment on the basis of sexual orientation adversely affects the rights of\n\npublic high school students. See Cal. Educ. Code § 201(c).25\n\n      The dissent takes comfort in the fact that there is a political disagreement\n\nregarding homosexuality in this country. See dis. op. at 12. We do not deny that\n\n\n      24\n        We should point out that we are considering here whether to reverse a\ndenial of a preliminary injunction. The extent to which a self-evident proposition\nmust be established in order to avoid such a reversal under an abuse of discretion\nstandard is not necessarily the same as may be required at a trial on the merits,\nalthough we express no view on the latter question.\n      25\n        Although we do not rely on the California statute to support our holding,\nwe note that the Legislature, in the California Schools Hate Violence Reduction\nAct of 1995, declared: “Harassment on school grounds directed at an individual on\nthe basis of personal characteristics or status creates a hostile environment and\njeopardizes equal educational opportunity as guaranteed by the California\nConstitution and the United States Constitution.” Cal. Educ. Code. § 201(c)\n(emphasis added).\n                                          26\n\fthere is, just as there was a longstanding political disagreement about racial\n\nequality that reached its peak in the 1950’s and about whether religious minorities\n\nshould hold high office that lasted at least until after the 1960 presidential\n\nelection,26 or whether blacks or Jews should be permitted to attend private\n\nuniversities and prep schools, work in various industries such as banks, brokerage\n\nhouses, and Wall Street law firms, or stay at prominent resorts or hotels. Such\n\ndisagreements may justify social or political debate, but they do not justify students\n\nin high schools or elementary schools assaulting their fellow students with\n\ndemeaning statements: by calling gay students shameful, by labeling black students\n\ninferior or by wearing T-shirts saying that Jews are doomed to Hell. Perhaps our\n\ndissenting colleague believes that one can condemn homosexuality without\n\ncondemning homosexuals. If so, he is wrong. To say that homosexuality is\n\nshameful is to say, necessarily, that gays and lesbians are shameful. There are\n\nnumerous locations and opportunities available to those who wish to advance such\n\n\n\n      26\n         For example, in the late 19th century, James G. Blaine ran for President in\na campaign that is remembered for its slogan of “Rum, Romanism and Rebellion.”\nSee Richard G. Bacon, Rum, Romanism and Romer, 6 DEL. L. REV. 1, 39-40\n(2003); see also Joseph P. Viteritti, Davey's Plea: Blaine, Blair, Witters, and the\nProtection of Religious Freedom, 27 HARV. J. L. & PUB. POL’Y 299, 311 (2003)\n(citation omitted) (observing that Blaine’s campaign for the Republican\nnomination “was built around his (and the party’s) opposition to ‘Rum, Romanism,\nand Rebellion.’”).\n                                           27\n\fan argument. It is not necessary to do so by directly condemning, to their faces,\n\nyoung students trying to obtain a fair and full education in our public schools.\n\n      Our dissenting colleague also appears to believe that the fact that Harper\n\nwore his T-shirt in response to a “Day of Silence” somehow lessens the injurious\n\neffect of his act because by participating in the gay rights event, gay students\n\n“perforce acknowledge that their status is not universally admired or respected.”\n\nDis. op. at 19. This argument is completely without merit. The fact that gays, or\n\nfor that matter blacks, Jews, or Latinos, recognize that they are the subject of\n\nprejudice and are not “respected” or considered equal by some in certain public\n\nschools in this country does not mean that they are not injured when the usually\n\nunspoken prejudice turns into harmful verbal conduct. Moreover, the dissent’s\n\nassertion that gay students may prefer to see the demeaning statements contained\n\non Harper’s T-shirt rather than on bathroom walls makes even less sense. See id.\n\nThe First Amendment does not justify students launching such injurious and\n\nharmful personal attacks in either location.\n\n      What we hold in this opinion is a far cry from what the dissent suggests. We\n\ndo not hold that schools may “define civic responsibility and then ban opposing\n\npoints of view.” Id. at 10 n.7. The question of what types of assemblies schools\n\nshould or may conduct regarding controversial public issues or what types of\n\n\n                                          28\n\fspeech students may otherwise generally engage in regarding such issues is not\n\nbefore us. Different circumstances require different results. We consider here only\n\nwhether schools may prohibit the wearing of T-shirts on high school campuses and\n\nin high school classes that flaunt demeaning slogans, phrases or aphorisms relating\n\nto a core characteristic of particularly vulnerable students and that may cause them\n\nsignificant injury. We do not believe that the schools are forbidden to regulate\n\nsuch conduct. Nor, contrary to the dissent, do we believe that because a school\n\nsponsors or permits a “Day of Tolerance” or a “Day of Silence” minority students\n\nshould be required to publicly “[c]onfront[]” and “refut[e]” demeaning verbal\n\nassaults on them – that they may be left with no option other than to try to justify\n\ntheir sexual practices to the entire student body or explain to all their fellow\n\nstudents why they are not inferior or evil. Id. at 19. The First Amendment does\n\nnot require that young students be subjected to such a destructive and humiliating\n\nexperience.\n\n      In his declaration in the district court, the school principal justified his\n\nactions on the basis that “any shirt which is worn on campus which speaks in a\n\nderogatory manner towards an individual or group of individuals is not healthy for\n\nyoung people . . . .” If, by this, the principal meant that all such shirts may be\n\nbanned under Tinker, we do not agree. T-shirts proclaiming, “Young Republicans\n\n\n                                           29\n\fSuck,” or “Young Democrats Suck,” for example, may not be very civil but they\n\nwould certainly not be sufficiently damaging to the individual or the educational\n\nprocess to warrant a limitation on the wearer’s First Amendment rights. Similarly,\n\nT-shirts that denigrate the President, his administration, or his policies, or\n\notherwise invite political disagreement or debate, including debates over the war in\n\nIraq, would not fall within the “rights of others” Tinker prong.27\n\n      Although we hold that the School’s restriction of Harper’s right to carry\n\nmessages on his T-shirt was permissible under Tinker, we reaffirm the importance\n\nof preserving student speech about controversial issues generally and protecting\n\nthe bedrock principle that students “may not be confined to the expression of those\n\nsentiments that are officially approved.” Tinker, 393 U.S. at 511; see also Fraser,\n\n478 U.S. at 681 (noting students’ “freedom to advocate unpopular and\n\ncontroversial views in schools and classrooms”). It is essential that students have\n\nthe opportunity to engage in full and open political expression, both in and out of\n\nthe school environment. Engaging in controversial political speech, even when it\n\n\n      27\n         The dissent suggests that our decision might somehow allow a school to\nrestrict student T-shirts that voice strongly-worded opposition to the war in Iraq.\nSee dis. op. at 12. That is not so. Our colleague ignores the fact that our holding is\nlimited to injurious speech that strikes at a core identifying characteristic of\nstudents on the basis of their membership in a minority group. The anti-war T-\nshirts posited by the dissent constitute neither an attack on the basis of a student’s\ncore identifying characteristic nor on the basis of his minority status.\n                                           30\n\fis offensive to others, is an important right of all Americans and learning the value\n\nof such freedoms is an essential part of a public school education. Indeed, the\n\ninculcation of “the fundamental values necessary to the maintenance of a\n\ndemocratic political system” is “truly the ‘work of the schools.’” Fraser, 478 U.S.\n\nat 683 (quoting Tinker, 393 U.S. at 508). Limitations on student speech must be\n\nnarrow, and applied with sensitivity and for reasons that are consistent with the\n\nfundamental First Amendment mandate. Accordingly, we limit our holding to\n\ninstances of derogatory and injurious remarks directed at students’ minority status\n\nsuch as race, religion, and sexual orientation.28 Moreover, our decision is based\n\n\n      28\n         We do not consider here whether remarks based on gender warrant similar\ntreatment, preferring to leave that question to another time. We recognize,\nhowever, that problems of gender discrimination remain serious and that they exist\nthroughout learning institutions, from the public and religious schools to\ninstitutions of higher learning, not excluding the most prominent institutions in the\nnation.\n       Our dissenting colleague worries that offensive words directed at majority\ngroups such as Christians or whites will not be covered by our holding. See dis.\nop. at 21. There is, of course, a difference between a historically oppressed\nminority group that has been the victim of serious prejudice and discrimination and\na group that has always enjoyed a preferred social, economic and political status.\nGrowing up as a member of a minority group often carries with it psychological\nand emotional burdens not incurred by members of the majority. In any event, any\nverbal assault targeting majorities that might justify some form of action by school\nofficials is more likely to fall under the “substantial disruption” prong of Tinker or\nunder the Fraser rule permitting schools to prohibit “plainly offensive” speech.\n478 U.S. at 683; cf. Frederick v. Morse, 439 F.3d 1114, 1122 n.44 (9th Cir. 2006)\n(observing that Fraser “only enables schools to prevent the sort of vulgar, obscene,\n                                                                         (continued...)\n                                          31\n\fnot only on the type and degree of injury the speech involved causes to\n\nimpressionable young people, but on the locale in which it takes place. See Tinker,\n\n393 U.S. at 506 (student rights must be construed “in light of the special\n\ncharacteristics of the school environment”). Thus, it is limited to conduct that\n\noccurs in public high schools (and in elementary schools). As young students\n\nacquire more strength and maturity, and specifically as they reach college age, they\n\nbecome adequately equipped emotionally and intellectually to deal with the type of\n\nverbal assaults that may be prohibited during their earlier years. Accordingly, we\n\ndo not condone the use in public colleges or other public institutions of higher\n\nlearning of restrictions similar to those permitted here.\n\n      Finally, we emphasize that the School’s actions here were no more than\n\nnecessary to prevent the intrusion on the rights of other students. Aside from\n\nprohibiting the wearing of the shirt, the School did not take the additional step of\n\npunishing the speaker: Harper was not suspended from school nor was the incident\n\nmade a part of his disciplinary record.\n\n      Under the circumstances present here, we conclude that the School’s actions\n\ndid not extend beyond the scope of the restrictions permitted by Tinker, and that\n\n\n      28\n        (...continued)\nlewd or sexual speech that, specially with adolescents, readily promotes\ndisruption”)\n                                          32\n\fthe district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Harper failed to\n\ndemonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of his free speech claim.\n\n             ii.    Substantial Disruption\n\n      The district court concluded that Harper had failed to demonstrate a\n\nlikelihood of success on the merits of his free speech claim because there was\n\nsufficient evidence to permit the school officials to “reasonably . . . forecast\n\nsubstantial disruption of or material interference with school activities.” Tinker,\n\n393 U.S. at 514. In so holding, the district court relied on the declarations of\n\nPrincipal Fisher, Assistant Principal Antrim, and LeMaster which described how\n\nthe previous year’s “Day of Silence” had resulted in “volatile behavior” and\n\n“tensions between students,” including physical altercations. The court also cited\n\nLeMaster’s testimony that he had observed disruption in the class that Harper\n\nattended while wearing the T-shirt, and Principal Fisher’s testimony that Harper\n\ntold him that a “tense verbal conversation with a group of students” had already\n\ntaken place due to the T-shirt’s message.\n\n      In light of our conclusion regarding the application of the “rights of others”\n\nprong of Tinker, we have no cause to decide whether the evidence would be\n\n\n\n\n                                            33\n\fsufficient to warrant denial of a preliminary injunction under the “substantial\n\ndisruption” prong as well.29\n\n      b.     Viewpoint Discrimination\n\n      In reaching our decision that Harper may lawfully be prohibited from\n\nwearing his T-shirt, we reject his argument that the School’s action constituted\n\nimpermissible viewpoint discrimination. The government is generally prohibited\n\n      29\n         Our recent decision in Frederick v. Morse, 439 F.3d 1114 (9th Cir. 2006),\nis in no respect inconsistent with this opinion. In Frederick, we held that a public\nhigh school’s suspension of a student for displaying off campus, during the\nrunning of the Winter Olympics Torch Relay, a banner that read “Bong Hits 4\nJesus,” violated Tinker. Frederick differs from the present case in four\nfundamental ways. First and foremost, Frederick did not address the “intrudes\nupon the rights of others” prong of Tinker, the ground upon which we base our\nholding here. Rather, the only issue in Frederick was whether the other Tinker\nprong – “substantial disruption” – was applicable. Second, in Frederick we\nconcluded that the school’s actions did not meet the “substantial disruption” prong\nbecause the school officials conceded that they punished the student’s display of\nthe banner not out of “concern that it would cause disruption” but because “the\nspeech promotes a social message contrary to the one favored by the school.” Id.\nat 1117-18. Here, although in view of our holding, we need not (and do not)\nconsider the “substantial disruption” prong of Tinker, the School presented\nevidence that it restricted Harper’s wearing of the T-shirt because it expected that\nhis doing so would cause substantial disruption. Third, Frederick involved\npunishing student speech that took place “outside the classroom, across the street\nfrom the school, during a non-curricular activity that was only partially supervised\nby school officials.” Id. at 1123. By contrast, Harper wore the offending T-shirt\nnot only on campus, but inside the classroom. Finally, in the case before us, the\nSchool adopted the least restrictive means of curing the injury; it simply forbade\nthe wearing of the garment. In Frederick, in contrast, the school authorities\npunished the student harshly for the purported (but non-existent) offense by\nsuspending him for ten days. Id. at 1116.\n                                         34\n\ffrom regulating speech “when the specific motivating ideology or the opinion or\n\nperspective of the speaker is the rationale for the restriction.” Rosenberger, 515\n\nU.S. at 829. However, as the district court correctly pointed out, speech in the\n\npublic schools is not always governed by the same rules that apply in other\n\ncircumstances. See Hazelwood, 484 U.S. at 266; Fraser, 478 U.S. at 685; West,\n\n206 F.3d at 1366 (schools may ban student speech that “could well be considered a\n\nform of political speech to be afforded First Amendment protection outside the\n\neducational setting”). Indeed, the Court in Tinker held that a school may prohibit\n\nstudent speech, even if the consequence is viewpoint discrimination, if the speech\n\nviolates the rights of other students or is materially disruptive. See Tinker, 393\n\nU.S. at 511 (stating school cannot prohibit “expression of one particular opinion”\n\nunless it makes a specific showing of constitutionally valid reasons); see also\n\nPorter v. Ascension Parish Sch. Bd., 393 F.3d 608, 615 (5th Cir. 2004) (stating that\n\nTinker “applies to school regulations directed at specific student viewpoints”);\n\nMuller by Muller, 98 F.3d at 1538 (emphasis added) (observing difference between\n\nsuppressing religious speech “solely because it is religious” and suppressing\n\nspeech that is “religious and disruptive or hurtful”). Thus, pursuant to Tinker,\n\ncourts have allowed schools to ban the display of Confederate flags despite the fact\n\nthat such a ban may constitute viewpoint discrimination. See Scott, 324 F.3d at\n\n\n                                          35\n\f1248 (upholding ban on Confederate flag where school officials presented\n\nevidence of racial tensions at the school); West, 206 F.3d at 1366 (same). While\n\nthe Confederate flag may express a particular viewpoint, “[i]t is not only\n\nconstitutionally allowable for school officials” to limit the expression of racially\n\nexplosive views, “it is their duty to do so.” Scott, 324 F.3d at 1249. Because, as\n\nwe have already explained, the record demonstrates that Harper’s speech intruded\n\nupon the rights of other students, the School’s restriction is permissible under\n\nTinker, and we must reject Harper’s viewpoint discrimination claim.30\n\n      The dissent claims that although the School may have been justified in\n\nbanning discussion of the subject of sexual orientation altogether, it cannot “gag[]\n\nonly those who oppose the Day of Silence.” Dis. op. at 11. As we have explained,\n\nhowever, although Tinker does not allow schools to restrict the non-invasive, non-\n\ndisruptive expression of political viewpoints, it does permit school authorities to\n\nrestrict “one particular opinion” if the expression would “impinge upon the rights\n\n\n\n      30\n        The cases on which Harper relies to support his viewpoint discrimination\nclaim involve the entirely different question whether schools may deny student\ngroups access to school resources on the basis of their religious viewpoint. See\nLamb’s Chapel v. Ctr. Moriches Union Free Sch. Dist., 508 U.S. 384, 386-87\n(1993) (school allowed use of school facilities for private groups, but prohibited\n“meetings for religious purposes”); Prince v. Jacoby, 303 F.3d 1074, 1090 (9th\nCir. 2002) (school allowed student clubs access to school facilities but excluded\nstudent Bible club). Those cases are not relevant here.\n                                          36\n\fof other students” or substantially disrupt school activities. Tinker, 393 U.S. at\n\n509, 511. Accordingly, a school may permit students to discuss a particular subject\n\nwithout being required to allow them to launch injurious verbal assaults that\n\nintrude upon the rights of other students.\n\n      “A school need not tolerate student speech that is inconsistent with its basic\n\neducational mission, [] even though the government could not censor similar\n\nspeech outside the school.” Hazelwood Sch. Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260, 266\n\n(1988) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Part of a school’s “basic\n\neducational mission” is the inculcation of “fundamental values of habits and\n\nmanners of civility essential to a democratic society.” Fraser, 478 U.S. at 681\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). For this reason, public schools may permit,\n\nand even encourage, discussions of tolerance, equality and democracy without\n\nbeing required to provide equal time for student or other speech espousing\n\nintolerance, bigotry or hatred. As we have explained, supra pp. 28-29, because a\n\nschool sponsors a “Day of Religious Tolerance,” it need not permit its students to\n\nwear T-shirts reading, “Jews Are Christ-Killers” or “All Muslims Are Evil Doers.”\n\nSuch expressions would be “wholly inconsistent with the ‘fundamental values’ of\n\npublic school education.” Id. at 685-86. Similarly, a school that permits a “Day of\n\nRacial Tolerance,” may restrict a student from displaying a swastika or a\n\n\n                                             37\n\fConfederate Flag. See West, 206 F.3d at 1365-66. In sum, a school has the right to\n\nteach civic responsibility and tolerance as part of its basic educational mission; it\n\nneed not as a quid pro quo permit hateful and injurious speech that runs counter to\n\nthat mission.31\n\n      We again emphasize that we do not suggest that all debate as to issues\n\nrelating to tolerance or equality may be prohibited. As we have stated repeatedly,\n\nwe consider here only the question of T-shirts, banners, and other similar items\n\nbearing slogans that injure students with respect to their core characteristics. Other\n\nissues must await another day.\n\n2.    Free Exercise of Religion Claim\n\n      Harper also contends that the district court erred because he was entitled to a\n\npreliminary injunction as a result of the School’s violation of his rights under the\n\nFree Exercise Clause. He asserts that his wearing of the T-shirt was “motivated by\n\nsincerely held religious beliefs” regarding homosexuality32 and that the School\n\n\n      31\n        We note, incidentally, that the incident in question occurred on the\nday after the “Day of Silence,” and not on the day itself.\n      32\n         We do not, of course, consider whether Harper’s views are consistent with\nhis religion, nor do we ask whether his religion truly encourages homophobic\nconduct. Similarly, we do not consider whether the isolated excerpt from the New\nTestament, Romans 1:27, is representative of Christian doctrine generally. All\nsuch inquiries are beyond the judiciary’s authority. See Hernandez v. C.I.R., 490\n                                                                      (continued...)\n                                          38\n\f“punished” him for expressing them, or otherwise burdened the exercise of those\n\nviews. Additionally, Harper argues that the School “attempted to change” his\n\nreligious views and that this effort violated both the Free Exercise Clause and the\n\nEstablishment Clause.\n\n      The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment provides that Congress\n\nshall make no law “prohibiting the free exercise” of religion. U.S. Const. amend. I.\n\nThe Clause prohibits the government from “compel[ling] affirmation of religious\n\nbelief, punish[ing] the expression of religious doctrines it believes to be false,\n\nimpos[ing] special disabilities on the basis of religious views or religious status, or\n\nlend[ing] its power to one or the other side in controversies over religious authority\n\nor dogma.” Employment Div., Dep’t of Human Res. of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S.\n\n872, 877 (1990) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n      In Sherbert v. Verner, the Supreme Court held that governmental actions that\n\nsubstantially burden a religious belief or practice must be justified by a compelling\n\nstate interest and must be narrowly tailored to serve that interest. 374 U.S. 398,\n\n402-03 (1963). The Sherbert test was later largely discarded in Smith, which held\n\n\n\n      32\n        (...continued)\nU.S. 680, 699 (1989) (“It is not within the judicial ken to question the centrality of\nparticular beliefs or practices to a faith, or the validity of particular litigants’\ninterpretations of those creeds.”)\n                                          39\n\fthat the “right of free exercise does not relieve an individual of the obligation to\n\ncomply with a ‘valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the\n\nlaw proscribes (or prescribes) conduct that his religion prescribes (or proscribes).’”\n\n494 U.S. 872, 879 (1990) (citation omitted). The Court held that a neutral law of\n\ngeneral applicability need not be supported by a compelling governmental interest\n\neven though it has the incidental effect of burdening religion. See id. at 885; see\n\nalso Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 531\n\n(1993).33 The Court noted, however, that a “hybrid claim,” i.e., a claim that\n\ninvolves “not the Free Exercise Clause alone, but the Free Exercise Clause in\n\nconjunction with other constitutional protections, such as freedom of speech,”\n\nmerits application of strict scrutiny: the law or action must be narrowly tailored to\n\nadvance a compelling government interest. Smith, 494 U.S. at 881; see also Miller\n\nv. Reed, 176 F.3d 1202, 1207 (9th Cir. 1999) (same). Although it did not say so\n\nexpressly, in Smith the Court preserved the Sherbert test for use in hybrid-rights\n\ncases. In order, however, “to assert a hybrid-rights claim, a free exercise plaintiff\n\nmust make out a colorable claim that a companion right has been violated – that is,\n\n\n      33\n        “A law is one of neutrality and general applicability if it does not aim to\n‘infringe upon or restrict practices because of their religious motivation,’ and if it\ndoes not ‘in a selective manner impose burdens only on conduct motivated by\nreligious belief[.]’” San Jose Christian Coll. v. City of Morgan Hill, 360 F.3d\n1024, 1031 (9th Cir. 2004) (quoting Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 546).\n                                           40\n\fa fair probability or a likelihood, but not a certitude, of success on the merits.”\n\nMiller, 176 F.3d at 1207 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).\n\n       Harper does not contend that the School’s prohibition against his wearing\n\nhis T-shirt was motivated by other than secular reasons or that it was applied to\n\nhim because of his religious views. Nor is there anything in the record to suggest\n\nthat other students wearing T-shirts similarly demeaning of gay and lesbian\n\nmembers of the student body would be treated differently, Christians or not.34\n\nUnder Smith, Harper’s claim would surely fail. Harper asserts, however, that we\n\nshould apply Sherbert’s strict scrutiny test to his free exercise claim because his is\n\na “hybrid” claim involving the Free Exercise Clause in conjunction with other\n\nconstitutional claims.35 The School disagrees, arguing that the district court\n\nproperly applied rational basis review under Smith because its prohibition of\n\n\n\n\n      34\n       Harper does not argue that the School’s ban on his wearing the injurious\nand demeaning T-shirt was arbitrary or capricious, only that it violated the First\nAmendment rights discussed herein.\n      35\n       Although Harper refers to “other constitutional claims” and even\n“numerous constitutional claims,” the only claim that has the potential to justify his\ninvoking of “hybrid” status is the free speech claim.\n                                           41\n\fHarper’s speech involved a “valid and neutral [rule] of general applicability.”36\n\nSmith, 494 U.S. at 879.\n\n      We seriously doubt that there is “a fair probability or a likelihood” that\n\nHarper’s claim that a companion right – free speech – has been violated will\n\nsucceed on the merits, as required by Miller. 176 F.3d at 1207 (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).37 In fact, we are fairly confident that it will not, for the reasons we\n\nhave explained supra Part V.1. Nevertheless, we need not decide whether Harper’s\n\nfree exercise claim is properly deemed a “hybrid” claim, because, whether or not\n\nSherbert’s strict scrutiny test applies, Harper cannot prevail here. “Under the\n\nSherbert test, governmental actions that substantially burden a religious practice\n\n\n\n\n      36\n         The district court determined that, “without the free speech claim,\nplaintiff’s free exercise claim does not require strict scrutiny.” It then ignored the\nfree speech claim, apparently because it had already found that it was unlikely to\nsucceed. Applying rational basis review, the court concluded that the School’s\naction was rationally based on a legitimate pedagogical concern, and that Harper\nfailed to demonstrate that it was irrational or wholly arbitrary.\n      37\n         We note that the School conceded in essence that the free speech claim was\n“colorable” for purposes of Harper’s establishing “irreparable harm” – one of the\nfactors that may in combination with others justify issuance of a preliminary\ninjunction. See supra pp. 10-12. We need not consider, however, whether\n“colorable” has different meanings for purposes of irreparable harm under\nSammartano, and for purposes of a hybrid claim under Miller, as we assume here\nthat Harper’s free speech claim is colorable for the latter purpose as well.\n                                          42\n\fmust be justified by a compelling governmental interest.”38 Smith, 494 U.S. at 883.\n\nIn this case, Harper flunks the test in every respect.\n\n      Assuming that Sherbert applies, we must first consider whether the School’s\n\nactions “substantially burden” a religious practice or belief. The record simply\n\ndoes not demonstrate that the School’s restriction regarding Harper’s T-shirt\n\nimposed a substantial burden upon the free exercise of Harper’s religious beliefs.\n\nThere is no evidence that the School “compell[ed] affirmation of a repugnant\n\nbelief,” “penalize[d] or discriminate[d] against [Harper] because [he] hold[s]\n\nreligious views abhorrent to the authorities,” or “condition[ed] the availability of\n\nbenefits upon [Harper’s] willingness to violate a cardinal principle of [his]\n\nreligious faith.” Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 402, 406. Nor did the School “lend its\n\npower to one or the other side in controversies over religious authority or dogma,”\n\nor “punish the expression of religious doctrines it believes to be false.” Smith, 494\n\nU.S. at 877.\n\n\n      38\n         We have described the Sherbert test as requiring the weighing of three\nfactors: (1) how much the state action interferes with the exercise of religious\nbeliefs; (2) whether there is a compelling state interest justifying a burden on\nreligious beliefs; and (3) whether accommodating those beliefs would unduly\ninterfere with the fulfillment of the government interest. N.L.R.B. v. Hanna Boys\nCenter, 940 F.2d 1295, 1305 (9th Cir. 1991).\n\n\n\n\n                                          43\n\f      Despite Harper’s allegation that the School “punished” him for expressing\n\nhis religious views, the record demonstrates the contrary: the School did not punish\n\nHarper at all. It simply prohibited him from wearing the offensive and disruptive\n\nshirt and required him to refrain from attending class for a portion of a day, if he\n\ninsisted on continuing to wear it. Nor did the restriction imposed on Harper’s\n\nwearing of the T-shirt constitute a substantial limitation on his right to express his\n\nreligious views. No one has the right to proclaim his views at all times in all\n\nmanners in all places, regardless of the circumstances, and Harper does not contend\n\nthat his religion suggests otherwise. Harper remains free to express his views,\n\nwhatever their merits, on other occasions and in other places. The prohibition\n\nagainst the wearing of a T-shirt in school does not constitute a substantial burden\n\non the exercise of his religious beliefs.\n\n      Even if a religious creed, or an individual’s interpretation of that creed,\n\ncould be said to require its adherents to proclaim their religious views at all times\n\nand in all places, and to do so in a manner that interferes with the rights of others,\n\nthe First Amendment would not prohibit the state from banning such disruptive\n\nconduct in certain circumstances, including on a high school campus. The\n\nConstitution does not authorize one group of persons to force its religious views on\n\nothers or to compel others to abide by its precepts. Nor does it authorize\n\n\n                                            44\n\findividuals to engage in conduct, including speech, on the grounds of public\n\nschools, that is harmful to other students seeking to obtain a fair and equal\n\neducation – even if those individuals hold a sincere belief that the principles of\n\ntheir religion require them to discriminate against others, or to publicly proclaim\n\ntheir discriminatory views whenever they believe that “evil” practices are being\n\ncondoned. See Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 403 (internal quotation marks omitted)\n\n(“[E]ven when the action is in accord with one’s religious convictions, it is not\n\ntotally free from legislative restrictions.”). Schools may prohibit students and\n\nothers from disrupting the educational process or causing physical or psychological\n\ninjury to young people entrusted to their care, whatever the motivations or beliefs\n\nof those engaged in such conduct. Indeed, the state’s interest in doing so is\n\ncompelling.\n\n      Because there is no evidence that the School’s restriction on Harper’s\n\nwearing of his T-shirt substantially burdened a religious practice or belief, and\n\nbecause the School has a compelling interest in providing a proper educational\n\nenvironment for its students and because its actions were narrowly tailored to\n\nachieve that end,39 it would appear that the district court did not abuse its discretion\n\n\n      39\n       As discussed earlier, the School did no more than necessary to further its\ncompelling interest in protecting the rights of students and maintaining a healthy\n                                                                       (continued...)\n                                           45\n\fin finding that Harper failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits as\n\nto his free exercise of religion claim. Before reaching that conclusion, however,\n\nwe must deal with one final argument that Harper raises as a part of that claim.\n\nHarper asserts that the School “attempted to change” his religious views that\n\n“homosexuality is harmful to both those who practice it and the community at\n\nlarge.” Specifically, Harper alleges that the school officials’ comments that his\n\nshirt was “inflammatory,” Detective Hubbert’s questioning of him, and Assistant\n\nPrincipal Giles’ statement that he leaves his Christian faith in the car when he\n\ncomes to school, all were attempts by school authorities to change his religious\n\nviews.\n\n      The district court rejected Harper’s contention. Indeed, there is no evidence\n\nin the record that the school representatives sought to change Harper’s religious\n\nbeliefs. Harper’s complaint avers that Detective Hubbert “proposed to [Harper]\n\nthat as a member of the Christian faith, he should understand that Christianity was\n\nbased on love not hate, and that [he] should not be offensive to others.” Hubbert’s\n\nhomily did not constitute an attempt to change Harper’s religious views, simply his\n\n\n\n      39\n        (...continued)\nlearning environment. It merely prohibited Harper from wearing the T-shirt at\nschool, and did not even take the additional step of suspending or otherwise\npunishing him.\n                                         46\n\foffensive behavior; at most, it was, as the district court concluded, an “option[]\n\npresented to and left with” Harper. The statements that the message on Harper’s\n\nshirt was “inflammatory” and would be harmful to the educational environment\n\nwere merely statements of fact that represented the School’s informed judgment.\n\nMore important, like Hubbert’s statement, they were designed to affect Harper’s\n\nbehavior not his beliefs. As for Giles’ comments, his affidavit stated that he did\n\nnot tell Harper to “leave his own faith in the car,” but explained that, as a school\n\nemployee, he, Giles, had to leave his own Christian faith in the car when he came\n\nto work. While Giles’ statement might also be construed as an attempt to\n\nencourage Harper to change his conduct – to refrain, while on campus, from\n\nexpressing religious views that denigrate others – it cannot be characterized as an\n\nattempt to change his views. In fact, rather than tell Harper to change his beliefs,\n\nGiles encouraged him to join the campus Bible Club so that he could become part\n\nof an “activity that would express his [Christian] opinions in a positive way on\n\ncampus,” an activity that was wholly consistent with Harper’s religious views. The\n\nrecord thus does not support Harper’s claim that the School violated his free\n\nexercise right by “attempting to change” his religious views.\n\n      Moreover, school officials’ statements and any other school activity\n\nintended to teach Harper the virtues of tolerance constitute a proper exercise of a\n\n\n                                          47\n\fschool’s educational function, even if the message conflicts with the views of a\n\nparticular religion. A public school’s teaching of secular democratic values does\n\nnot constitute an unconstitutional attempt to influence students’ religious beliefs.\n\nRather, it simply reflects the public school’s performance of its duty to educate\n\nchildren regarding appropriate secular subjects in an appropriate secular manner.\n\nAs we have reiterated earlier, “the inculcation of fundamental values necessary to\n\nthe maintenance of a democratic political system” is “truly the ‘work of the\n\nschools.’” Fraser, 478 U.S. at 681, 683 (quoting Ambach v. Norwick, 441 U.S. 68,\n\n76-77 (1979); quoting Tinker, 393 U.S. at 508). Public schools are not limited to\n\nteaching materials that are consistent with all aspects of the views of all religions.\n\nSo long as the subject and materials are appropriate from an educational standpoint\n\nand the purpose of the instruction is secular, the school’s teaching is not subject to\n\na constitutional objection that it conflicts with a view held by members of a\n\nparticular religion. There is no evidence here that the school officials’ comments\n\nwere associated with a religious, as opposed to a secular, purpose. Their affidavits\n\ndemonstrate that the School acted in order to maintain a secure and healthy\n\nlearning environment for all its students, not to advance religion.\n\n      The Constitution does not preclude school districts from teaching the\n\nessential elements of democracy or otherwise performing their proper educational\n\n\n                                          48\n\fmission simply because some individuals or groups may assert that their religious\n\nviews are inconsistent with the lessons taught as a part of that mission.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the district court’s decision that Harper was not entitled to\n\na preliminary injunction on the basis of his free exercise claim.\n\n3.    Establishment Clause Claim\n\n      Finally, we consider the district court’s conclusion that Harper did not\n\ndemonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of his claim that the School\n\nviolated the Establishment Clause by attempting to “coerce” him into changing his\n\nreligious beliefs that “homosexuality is harmful to both those who practice it and\n\nthe community at large.”\n\n      Harper’s Establishment Clause claim as presented on appeal appears to be\n\nsimply a restatement of his Free Exercise claim. In fact, as the Supreme Court has\n\nnoted, its Establishment Clause cases “for the most part have addressed\n\ngovernmental efforts to benefit religion or particular religions,” and thus\n\nallegations of an “attempt to disfavor” a religion, such as Harper’s, are properly\n\nanalyzed under the Free Exercise Clause. Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 532 (emphasis\n\nadded). However, in the interest of thoroughness, we briefly address Harper’s\n\nclaim of “coercion” under the Establishment Clause.\n\n\n\n\n                                          49\n\f      Harper bases his claim almost entirely on the Supreme Court’s statement in\n\nLee v. Weisman, that “at a minimum, the Constitution guarantees that government\n\nmay not coerce anyone to support or participate in religion or its exercise, or\n\notherwise act in a way which ‘establishes a [state] religion or religious faith, or\n\ntends to do so.’”40 505 U.S. 577, 587 (1992) (quoting Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S.\n\n668, 678 (1984)). Here, there is no evidence that the School’s actions were based\n\non anything other than an entirely secular and legitimate aim of protecting the\n\nrights of students and promoting a tolerant and safe learning environment. There is\n\ncertainly no evidence (or even allegation) that school authorities sought to coerce\n\nor encourage Harper to participate in some other religion or to adopt some state-\n\nsupported or other religious faith. To reiterate what we explained in the “Free\n\nExercise” section of this opinion, the teaching of secular democratic values does\n\nnot violate the First Amendment, even if that teaching conflicts in some respect\n\nwith a sincerely held view that a student or his parents may attribute to the\n\nparticular religion to which they adhere.\n\n\n      40\n        The only other case upon which Harper relies for his coercion claim is\nPeloza v. Capistrano Unified Sch. Dist., in which this court observed that “[t]o\npermit [a teacher] to discuss his religious beliefs with students during school time\non school grounds would violate the Establishment Clause.” 37 F.3d 517, 522 (9th\nCir. 1994). Like Lee, the case is inapposite as it involves the entirely different\nissue of school-sanctioned religious speech which “would have the primary effect\nof advancing religion, and would entangle the school with religion.” Id.\n                                            50\n\f         Government conduct does not violate the Establishment Clause when (1) it\n\nhas a secular purpose, (2) its principal and primary effect neither advances nor\n\ninhibits religion, and (3) it does not foster excessive government entanglement in\n\nreligion. See Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 612-13 (1971). For the reasons\n\nwe have already explained, the record supports the district court’s conclusion that\n\nthe School’s actions “had a secular purpose, i.e., promoting tolerance, and not\n\nadvancing or inhibiting religion.” It is also clear from the record that the primary\n\neffect of the School’s banning of the T-shirt was not to advance or inhibit religion\n\nbut to protect and preserve the educational environment and the rights of other\n\nmembers of the student body. Nor can there be any question in this case of\n\nexcessive government entanglement in religion. Finally, as we have already\n\ndiscussed, there is no evidence in the record that school officials attempted to\n\nchange Harper’s religious beliefs. A fortiori, there is no evidence that they\n\nattempted to coerce Harper into changing his beliefs. For all the above reasons, we\n\nhold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Harper failed\n\nto demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of his Establishment Clause\n\nclaim.\n\n4.       Other Claims\n\n\n\n\n                                           51\n\f      In addition to the denial of his preliminary injunction motion, Harper asks\n\nthat we review the district court’s dismissal of his due process and equal protection\n\ncauses of action, as well as the court’s grant of qualified immunity to the individual\n\ndefendants, under the doctrine of “pendent appellate jurisdiction.” We may\n\nexercise pendent appellate jurisdiction “over rulings that are inextricably\n\nintertwined with or necessary to ensure meaningful review of decisions that are\n\nproperly before us on interlocutory appeal.” Poulos v. Caesars World, Inc., 379\n\nF.3d 654, 668 (9th Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). In order for\n\npendent issues to be “inextricably intertwined” they must either “‘(a) be so\n\nintertwined that we must decide the pendent issue in order to review the claims\n\nproperly raised on interlocutory appeal . . . or (b) resolution of the issue properly\n\nraised on interlocutory appeal necessarily resolves the pendent issue.’” Batzel v.\n\nSmith, 333 F.3d 1018, 1023 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting Cunningham v. Gates, 229\n\nF.3d 1271, 1285 (9th Cir. 2000)).\n\n      With regard to Harper’s due process cause of action, it is based on his claim\n\nthat the School’s dress code is impermissibly vague in violation of the Due Process\n\nClause. As we have already explained, see supra note 11, we need not consider the\n\nvalidity of the School’s dress code in order to rule on the preliminary injunction.\n\nAs to Harper’s equal protection contention, as presented on this appeal it is simply\n\n\n                                          52\n\fa restatement of his viewpoint discrimination claim which, for the reasons already\n\nprovided, we have rejected. Whether or not there may be other aspects to the claim\n\nwe do not know with certainty at this point in the proceedings; thus we do not\n\nreview that claim here. Accordingly, neither the due process nor equal protection\n\nclaim is one we must decide in order to resolve the issue before us, and our\n\nresolution of the issue before us does not require us to determine the merits of\n\neither claim. Whatever the merits of those claims (and we have no cause here to\n\nquestion the district court’s decision as to either), their validity or invalidity is of\n\nno consequence here. Finally, the district court’s dismissal of Harper’s damages\n\nclaims based on a finding of qualified immunity is not “inextricably intertwined”\n\nwith the denial of the preliminary injunction motion, Poulos, 379 F.3d at 668, as\n\nwe need not “decide the [qualified immunity] issue in order to review the claims\n\nproperly raised on interlocutory appeal . . . .” Batzel, 333 F.3d at 1023 (quoting\n\nCunningham v. Gates, 229 F.3d 1271, 1284 (9th Cir. 2000)).\n\n                                    VI. Conclusion\n\n       We hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the\n\npreliminary injunction. Harper failed to demonstrate that he will likely prevail on\n\nthe merits of his free speech, free exercise of religion, or establishment of religion\n\nclaims. In fact, such future success on Harper’s part is highly unlikely, given the\n\n\n                                            53\n\flegal principles discussed in this opinion. The Free Speech Clause permits public\n\nschools to restrict student speech that intrudes upon the rights of other students.\n\nInjurious speech that may be so limited is not immune from regulation simply\n\nbecause it reflects the speaker’s religious views. Accordingly, we affirm the\n\ndistrict court’s denial of Harper’s motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\nAFFIRMED; REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                          54\n\fExhibit A\n\n\n\n\n   55\n\f                                    COUNSEL\n\nRobert H.

Factual Background1\n\n      Poway High School (“the School”) has had a history of conflict among its\n\nstudents over issues of sexual orientation. In 2003, the School permitted a student\n\ngroup called the Gay-Straight Alliance to hold a “Day of Silence” at the School\n\nwhich, in the words of an Assistant Principal, is intended to “teach tolerance of\n\nothers, particularly those of a different sexual orientation.”2 During the days\n\nsurrounding the 2003 “Day of Silence,”3 a series of incidents and altercations\n\noccurred on the school campus as a result of anti-homosexual comments that were\n\nmade by students. One such confrontation required the Principal to separate\n\nstudents physically. According to David LeMaster, a teacher at Poway, several\n\nstudents were suspended as a result of these conflicts. Moreover, a week or so\n\nafter the “Day of Silence,” a group of heterosexual students informally organized a\n\n      1\n        These background facts are based on the limited record before us which\nincludes five declarations by school officials, and declarations from Harper, his\nfather, Ron Harper, and a fellow student, Joel Rhine.\n      2\n      In his complaint, Harper alleges that he believes “the true purpose” of the\n“Day of Silence” was “to endorse, promote and encourage homosexual activity.”\n      3\n        On the “Day of Silence,” participating students wore duct tape over their\nmouths to symbolize the silencing effect of intolerance upon gays and lesbians;\nthese students would not speak in class except through a designated representative.\nSome students wore black T-shirts that said “National Day of Silence” and\ncontained a purple square with a yellow equal sign in the middle. The Gay-\nStraight Alliance, with the permission of the School, also put up several posters\npromoting awareness of harassment on the basis of sexual orientation.\n                                          3\n\f“Straight-Pride Day,” during which they wore T-shirts which displayed derogatory\n\nremarks about homosexuals. According to Assistant Principal Lynell Antrim,\n\nsome students were asked to remove the shirts and did so, while others “had an\n\naltercation and were suspended for their actions.”\n\n      Because of these conflicts in 2003, when the Gay-Straight Alliance sought to\n\nhold another “Day of Silence” in 2004, the School required the organization to\n\nconsult with the Principal to “problem solve” and find ways to reduce tensions and\n\npotential altercations. On April 21, 2004, the date of the 2004 “Day of Silence,”\n\nappellant Tyler Chase Harper wore a T-shirt to school on which “I WILL NOT\n\nACCEPT WHAT GOD HAS CONDEMNED,” was handwritten on the front and\n\n“HOMOSEXUALITY IS SHAMEFUL ‘Romans 1:27’” was handwritten on the\n\nback. There is no evidence in the record that any school staff saw Harper’s T-shirt\n\non that day.\n\n      The next day, April 22, 2004, Harper wore the same T-shirt to school, except\n\nthat the front of the shirt read “BE ASHAMED, OUR SCHOOL EMBRACED\n\nWHAT GOD HAS CONDEMNED,” while the back retained the same message as\n\nbefore, “HOMOSEXUALITY IS SHAMEFUL ‘Romans 1:27.’”4 LeMaster,\n\nHarper’s second period teacher, noticed Harper’s shirt and observed “several\n\n\n      4\n       A copy of a photograph of the T-shirt is attached as Exhibit A.\n                                         4\n\fstudents off-task talking about” the shirt. LeMaster, recalling the altercations that\n\nerupted as a result of “anti-homosexual speech” during the previous year’s “Day of\n\nSilence,” explained to Harper that he believed that the shirt was “inflammatory,”\n\nthat it violated the School’s dress code, and that it “created a negative and hostile\n\nworking environment for others.” When Harper refused to remove his shirt and\n\nasked to speak to an administrator, LeMaster gave him a dress code violation card\n\nto take to the front office.\n\n       When Harper arrived at the front office, he met Assistant Principal Antrim.\n\nShe told Harper that the “Day of Silence” was “not about the school promoting\n\nhomosexuality but rather it was a student activity trying to raise other students’\n\nawareness regarding tolerance in their judgement [sic] of others.” Antrim believed\n\nthat Harper’s shirt “was inflammatory under the circumstances and could cause\n\ndisruption in the educational setting.” Like LeMaster, she also recalled the\n\naltercations that had arisen as a result of anti-homosexual speech one year prior.\n\nAccording to her affidavit, she “discussed [with Harper] ways that he and students\n\nof his faith could bring a positive light onto this issue without the condemnation\n\nthat he displayed on his shirt.” Harper was informed that if he removed the shirt he\n\ncould return to class.\n\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\f      When Harper again refused to remove his shirt, the Principal, Scott Fisher,\n\nspoke with him, explaining his concern that the shirt was “inflammatory” and that\n\nit was the School’s “intent to avoid physical conflict on campus.” Fisher also\n\nexplained to Harper that it was not healthy for students to be addressed in such a\n\nderogatory manner. According to Fisher, Harper informed him that he had already\n\nbeen “confronted by a group of students on campus” and was “involved in a tense\n\nverbal conversation” earlier that morning.5 The Principal eventually decided that\n\nHarper could not wear his shirt on campus, a decision that, he asserts, was\n\ninfluenced by “the fact that during the previous year, there was tension on campus\n\nsurrounding the Day of Silence between certain gay and straight students.”6 Fisher\n\nproposed some alternatives to wearing the shirt, all of which Harper turned down.\n\nHarper asked two times to be suspended. Fisher “told him that [he] did not want\n\n\n      5\n       In his affidavit, Harper characterized these conversations with other\nstudents as “peaceful discussions wherein differing viewpoints were\ncommunicated.”\n      6\n         We note that conflicts over homosexuality at Poway High School have not\nbeen limited to the incidents surrounding a “Day of Silence.” Two former students\nrecently won a suit against the School for failing to protect them from students who\nharassed them because they are gay. See Dana Littlefield, Two Gay Students Were\nHarassed, Jury Finds, San Diego Union-Trib., June 9, 2005, at B2. During the\ntrial, one of the students testified that Poway “students repeatedly called him\nnames, shoved him in the hallways, threw food at him and spit on him,” and “that\nhe heard other students make disparaging remarks about gays and lesbians on a\nnearly daily basis.” Id.\n                                          6\n\fhim suspended from school, nor did [he] want him to have something in his\n\ndisciplinary record because of a stance he felt strongly about.” Instead, Fisher told\n\nHarper that he would be required to remain in the front office for the remainder of\n\nthe school day.\n\n      Harper spent the rest of the day in the school conference room doing his\n\nhomework. At some point during that day, Deputy Sheriff Norman Hubbert, who\n\nserved as the school resource officer for Poway High, came in to speak with\n\nHarper.7 The complaint alleges that Hubbert “came to interrogate” Harper to\n\n“determine if he was a dangerous student.” Hubbert, however, asserts in his\n\naffidavit that he and Harper had a “casual conversation concerning the content of\n\nthe shirt . . . the Bible and [the] scripture reference on the shirt,” and that the\n\nconversation was conducted “simpl[y out of] curiosity . . . to understand the\n\nsituation.”\n\n      Toward the end of the school day, Assistant Principal Ed Giles spoke with\n\nHarper. Giles had discovered earlier in the day that Harper attended the same\n\n\n\n      7\n       Hubbert, who is a detective with the San Diego County Sheriff, was on\ncampus that day because someone, purporting to be a parent, had called the School\nthat morning complaining about the School’s “condoning” the “Day of Silence”\nand stated that “he and several other parents had ‘had it’ and ‘would be doing\nsomething about it.’” Concerned about safety, Principal Fisher had requested\nHubbert’s presence on campus on that day.\n                                            7\n\fchurch that he had previously attended, and that he “knew [Harper’s] father\n\npersonally and had attended Biblical studies that [Harper’s] father led on Tuesday\n\nnights.” According to Giles, he went to speak with Harper “out of respect to\n\n[Harper] and his family” and “to make sure he was alright.” Giles told Harper that\n\nhe understood “where he was coming from” but wished that he could “express\n\nhimself in a more positive way.” Giles also said that he shared the same Christian\n\nfaith as Harper, but that as a school employee, he had to watch how he expressed\n\nhis beliefs and that when he came to work, he had to “leave his faith in [the] car.”\n\nGiles then asked Harper to “consider other alternatives that would be more positive\n\nand non-confrontational,” including sponsoring activities through the campus Bible\n\nClub.\n\n        After his conversation with Giles, Harper remained in the office for the last\n\nperiod of the day, after which he was instructed to proceed directly off campus.\n\nHarper was not suspended, no disciplinary record was placed in his file, and he\n\nreceived full attendance credit for the day.\n\n                               II. Procedural History\n\n        On June 2, 2004, Harper filed a lawsuit in district court against Poway\n\nUnified School District and certain named individuals in their individual and\n\nofficial capacities. Harper alleged five federal causes of action – violations of his\n\n\n                                           8\n\fright to free speech, his right to free exercise of religion, the Establishment Clause,\n\nthe Equal Protection Clause, and the Due Process Clause – and one state law claim\n\nbased on California Civil Code § 52.1, which creates a private cause of action for\n\nthe violation of individual federal and state constitutional rights. On June 22,\n\n2004, the School filed a motion to dismiss, and on July 12, 2004, Harper filed a\n\nmotion for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the school from “continuing\n\n[its] violation of the constitutional rights of Plaintiff Tyler Chase Harper.” On\n\nNovember 4, 2004, the district court granted the School’s motion to dismiss as to\n\nHarper’s equal protection, due process,8 and state law claims, but denied the\n\nmotion as to his three First Amendment claims: freedom of speech, free exercise of\n\nreligion, and establishment of religion. The district court also granted the School’s\n\nmotion to dismiss Harper’s damages claims against Poway Unified School District\n\nand the individual defendants on the ground of qualified immunity. Finally, the\n\ndistrict court denied Harper’s motion for a preliminary injunction. Harper then\n\nfiled an interlocutory appeal from the order denying the latter motion.9\n\n\n      8\n       The district court dismissed with prejudice only Harper’s due process\nchallenge.\n      9\n       We note that on November 17, 2004, thirteen days after the district court\nrendered its decision and two days prior to filing his Notice of Appeal with this\ncourt, Harper filed a First Amended Verified Complaint adding his sister, Kelsie,\n                                                                       (continued...)\n                                           9\n\f                                  III.

Standard and Scope of Review\n\n      For a district court to grant a preliminary injunction, the moving party must\n\ndemonstrate either “(1) a combination of probable success on the merits and the\n\npossibility of irreparable harm; or (2) that serious questions are raised and the\n\nbalance of hardships tips in its favor.” A & M Records, Inc. v.

Harper’s motion for a\npreliminary injunction sought only to enjoin school officials “from continuing their\nviolation of the constitutional rights of Plaintiff Tyler Chase Harper.” The only\nviolation alleged was that Harper was precluded from wearing his T-shirt with its\ndemeaning message while at school. The motion did not seek to enjoin the\nenforcement of the School’s dress code or any other school policies against any\nand all students, but sought only to stop the violation of Harper’s purported\nconstitutional right to wear his T-shirt. Our affirmance of the district court order\ndoes not depend upon the existence of a valid school policy or code. Under Tinker,\nthe School is permitted to prohibit Harper’s conduct, with or without a valid anti-\nharassment or other policy, if it can demonstrate that the restriction was necessary\nto prevent either the violation of the rights of other students or substantial\ndisruption of school activities. The record is clear that even though Harper’s\nteacher and Vice Principal Antrim stated that the T-shirt violated the dress code,\nthe school officials made plain to Harper that the reason he could not wear the T-\nshirt was because of its effect upon other students and its disruptive effect upon the\neducational environment, rather than because it was prohibited by a dress code.\nThe district judge apparently concluded that the validity of the School’s anti-\nharassment policies was not before him, or that it was not necessary to decide that\nquestion, and we cannot say that his determination was unreasonable. Finally, we\n                                                                          (continued...)\n                                          13\n\fpreliminary injunction.

Student Speech Under Tinker\n\n       Public schools are places where impressionable young persons spend much\n\nof their time while growing up.

Of course, following remand, the district court\nmay do so at the appropriate time or upon the appropriate motion. In contrast, our\ndissenting colleague would have us engage on appeal in a sweeping examination\nab initio of the validity of a complicated series of policies – an examination that\nwould cause us to discuss prematurely a number of controversial constitutional\nissues.

Often,\n\nthey are insecure. Generally, they are vulnerable to cruel, inhuman, and prejudiced\n\ntreatment by others.\n\n      The courts have construed the First Amendment as applied to public schools\n\nin a manner that attempts to strike a balance between the free speech rights of\n\nstudents and the special need to maintain a safe, secure and effective learning\n\nenvironment. See, e.g., Tinker, 393 U.S. at 507 (balancing the need for\n\n“scrupulous protection of Constitutional freedoms of the individual” against the\n\nneed of schools to perform their proper educational function). This court has\n\nexpressly recognized the need for such balance: “States have a compelling interest\n\nin their educational system, and a balance must be met between the First\n\nAmendment rights of students and preservation of the educational process.”\n\nLaVine v.

Thus, while Harper’s shirt embodies the very sort of\n\npolitical speech that would be afforded First Amendment protection outside of the\n\npublic school setting, his rights in the case before us must be determined “in light\n\nof [those] special characteristics.” Tinker, 393 U.S. at 506.\n\n      This court has identified “three distinct areas of student speech,” each of\n\nwhich is governed by different Supreme Court precedent: (1) vulgar, lewd,\n\nobscene, and plainly offensive speech which is governed by Fraser,14 (2) school-\n\n\n      13\n         Although Harper correctly points out that California law provides greater\nprotection for student speech than federal law, see Cal. Educ. Code § 48950(a), he\ndid not raise a state law claim in his preliminary injunction motion before the\ndistrict court. Nor did he question, as he does in his brief to us, the\nconstitutionality of the correlative provisions of the California Education Code that\nprovide greater protection than federal law against harassment of students on the\nbasis of sexual orientation.

First, a school\n\nmay regulate student speech that would “impinge upon the rights of other\n\nstudents.” Tinker, 393 U.S. at 509. Second, a school may prohibit student speech\n\nthat would result in “substantial disruption of or material interference with school\n\nactivities.” Id. at 514. Because, as we explain below, the School’s prohibition of\n\nthe wearing of the demeaning T-shirt is constitutionally permissible under the first\n\nof the Tinker prongs, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion\n\n\n\n      14\n       (...continued)\nneed not consider whether his speech was “plainly offensive” under Fraser.\n      15\n        Neither party here claims that Harper’s speech is “school-sponsored” and\nthus governed by Hazelwood.\n      16\n         In Tinker, the Supreme Court held that a public school could not ban\nstudents from wearing black armbands protesting the Vietnam war where the\n“silent, passive expression of opinion [was] unaccompanied by any disorder or\ndisturbance,” and there was no evidence that the display “colli[ded] with the rights\nof other students to be secure and to be let alone.” 393 U.S. at 508.\n                                          17\n\fin finding that Harper failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of\n\nhis free speech claim.17\n\n             i.

See dis. op. at 3-9. The last part of the dissent also\ndeals with a subject we need not and do not address: what the dissent terms the\nSchool’s “harassment policy.” Id. at 22-36; see also supra n. 11. Oddly, the\ndissent spends only a relatively minor part of its discussion on the determinative\nissue here, the impermissible intrusion on the rights of gay and lesbian students.\nId. at 13-22. Even more oddly, in its Conclusion the dissent suggests that speech\nthat is fundamentally offensive to minority students may be constitutionally limited\nand quarrels only with whether such a limitation is consistent with the wording of\nTinker. Id. at 36-37. It also suggests that the Supreme Court might properly\nmodify Tinker and validate our holding. Id. at 37. We disagree that any\nmodification of Tinker is required or desirable. All that is necessary is a fair\nreading of its plain language, as we explain in the following section.\n                                          18\n\fspeakers in Blackwell “accosted other students by pinning the buttons on them\n\neven though they did not ask for one,” a student must be physically accosted in\n\norder to have his rights infringed.\n\n      Notwithstanding the facts of Blackwell, the law does not support Harper’s\n\nargument. This court has explained that vulgar, lewd, obscene, indecent, and\n\nplainly offensive speech “by definition, may well ‘impinge[] upon the rights of\n\nother students,’” even if the speaker does not directly accost individual students\n\nwith his remarks.

See supra n.11. Although in its discussion of a\nprovision regarding “hostile environment,” Saxe briefly alludes to the “interference\nwith the rights of others” prong of Tinker, it appears to conflate that prong with the\n“substantial disruption” prong and to suggest, perhaps inadvertently, that injurious\nslurs may not be prohibited unless they also cause substantial disruption. See Saxe,\n240 F.3d at 217. That clearly is not the case. The two Tinker prongs are stated in\nthe alternative. See Tinker, 393 U.S. at 508. We agree, however, with Saxe’s\nconclusion that “it is certainly not enough that the speech is merely offensive to\nsome listener.” Saxe, 240 F.3d at 217.\n      22\n          As noted supra, California law explicitly recognizes the right of students\nto be free from harassment on the basis of sexual orientation. See Cal. Educ. Code\n§ 200, 201. These provisions were enacted not in a vacuum, but out of a\nrecognition on the part of the state legislature of “an urgent need to prevent and\nrespond to acts of hate violence and bias-related incidents that are occurring at an\nincreasing rate in California’s public schools.” Id. at § 201(d). We also observe\nthat federal law provides public school students some protection against\nharassment and discriminatory treatment based on sexual orientation. For\nexample, in Flores v.

See dis. op. at 15-18. It is simply not a novel concept, however, that such\n\nattacks on young minority students can be harmful to their self-esteem and to their\n\nability to learn. As long ago as in Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme\n\nCourt recognized that “[a] sense of inferiority affects the motivation of a child to\n\nlearn.” 347 U.S. at 494 (internal quotation marks omitted). If a school permitted\n\nits students to wear shirts reading, “Negroes: Go Back To Africa,” no one would\n\ndoubt that the message would be harmful to young black students. So, too, in the\n\ncase of gay students, with regard to messages such as those written on Harper’s T-\n\nshirt.23 As our dissenting colleague recently concluded, “[y]ou don’t need an\n\nexpert witness to figure out” the self-evident effect of certain policies or messages.\n\nJespersen v.

April 14, 2006) (Kozinski, Circuit Judge, dissenting). Just as Judge\n\n\n      23\n          There is much literature to this effect. See supra pp. 21-23. Our dissenting\ncolleague’s notion of “evidence” appears to be rather odd. It seems to consist\nlargely of motion pictures and television shows. The dissent draws conclusions\nthat it is “not unusual in a high school classroom for students to be ‘off-task’” and\nthat politics and other subjects “are the ordinary subjects of discourse in high\nschool corridors” on the basis of our colleague’s viewing of a number of popular\nentertainment features. See dis. op. at 4 n.2 & 5 n.3. Perhaps he would prefer us to\ncite Brokeback Mountain (Paramount Pictures 2005) or The Matthew Shepard\nStory (2002), as evidence of the harmful effects of anti-gay harassment rather than\nsimply stating that which, to anyone familiar with or in any way sensitive to, the\nhistory or effect of discrimination, is a self-evident fact.\n                                          25\n\fKozinski found it to be “perfectly clear” – without the aid of any evidence in the\n\nrecord – that an employer’s makeup requirement burdened women, the fact that\n\nHarper’s demeaning statement is harmful to gay students at Poway High “hardly\n\nseem[s] like [a] question[] reasonably subject to dispute.” Id. at *12. One would\n\nthink that if we should be able to take notice of how long it takes women to put on\n\nmakeup, or that makeup is an expensive item, we can certainly take notice that it is\n\nharmful to gay teenagers to be publicly degraded and called immoral and\n\nshameful.24 Certainly, the California legislature had no difficulty in determining\n\nthat harassment on the basis of sexual orientation adversely affects the rights of\n\npublic high school students. See Cal. Educ. Code § 201(c).25\n\n      The dissent takes comfort in the fact that there is a political disagreement\n\nregarding homosexuality in this country. See dis. op. at 12. We do not deny that\n\n\n      24\n        We should point out that we are considering here whether to reverse a\ndenial of a preliminary injunction. The extent to which a self-evident proposition\nmust be established in order to avoid such a reversal under an abuse of discretion\nstandard is not necessarily the same as may be required at a trial on the merits,\nalthough we express no view on the latter question.\n      25\n        Although we do not rely on the California statute to support our holding,\nwe note that the Legislature, in the California Schools Hate Violence Reduction\nAct of 1995, declared: “Harassment on school grounds directed at an individual on\nthe basis of personal characteristics or status creates a hostile environment and\njeopardizes equal educational opportunity as guaranteed by the California\nConstitution and the United States Constitution.” Cal. Educ. Code. § 201(c)\n(emphasis added).\n                                          26\n\fthere is, just as there was a longstanding political disagreement about racial\n\nequality that reached its peak in the 1950’s and about whether religious minorities\n\nshould hold high office that lasted at least until after the 1960 presidential\n\nelection,26 or whether blacks or Jews should be permitted to attend private\n\nuniversities and prep schools, work in various industries such as banks, brokerage\n\nhouses, and Wall Street law firms, or stay at prominent resorts or hotels. Such\n\ndisagreements may justify social or political debate, but they do not justify students\n\nin high schools or elementary schools assaulting their fellow students with\n\ndemeaning statements: by calling gay students shameful, by labeling black students\n\ninferior or by wearing T-shirts saying that Jews are doomed to Hell. Perhaps our\n\ndissenting colleague believes that one can condemn homosexuality without\n\ncondemning homosexuals. If so, he is wrong. To say that homosexuality is\n\nshameful is to say, necessarily, that gays and lesbians are shameful. There are\n\nnumerous locations and opportunities available to those who wish to advance such\n\n\n\n      26\n         For example, in the late 19th century, James G. Blaine ran for President in\na campaign that is remembered for its slogan of “Rum, Romanism and Rebellion.”\nSee Richard G. Bacon, Rum, Romanism and Romer, 6 DEL. L. REV. 1, 39-40\n(2003); see also Joseph P. Viteritti, Davey's Plea: Blaine, Blair, Witters, and the\nProtection of Religious Freedom, 27 HARV. J. L. & PUB. POL’Y 299, 311 (2003)\n(citation omitted) (observing that Blaine’s campaign for the Republican\nnomination “was built around his (and the party’s) opposition to ‘Rum, Romanism,\nand Rebellion.’”).\n                                           27\n\fan argument. It is not necessary to do so by directly condemning, to their faces,\n\nyoung students trying to obtain a fair and full education in our public schools.\n\n      Our dissenting colleague also appears to believe that the fact that Harper\n\nwore his T-shirt in response to a “Day of Silence” somehow lessens the injurious\n\neffect of his act because by participating in the gay rights event, gay students\n\n“perforce acknowledge that their status is not universally admired or respected.”\n\nDis. op. at 19. This argument is completely without merit. The fact that gays, or\n\nfor that matter blacks, Jews, or Latinos, recognize that they are the subject of\n\nprejudice and are not “respected” or considered equal by some in certain public\n\nschools in this country does not mean that they are not injured when the usually\n\nunspoken prejudice turns into harmful verbal conduct. Moreover, the dissent’s\n\nassertion that gay students may prefer to see the demeaning statements contained\n\non Harper’s T-shirt rather than on bathroom walls makes even less sense. See id.\n\nThe First Amendment does not justify students launching such injurious and\n\nharmful personal attacks in either location.\n\n      What we hold in this opinion is a far cry from what the dissent suggests. We\n\ndo not hold that schools may “define civic responsibility and then ban opposing\n\npoints of view.” Id. at 10 n.7. The question of what types of assemblies schools\n\nshould or may conduct regarding controversial public issues or what types of\n\n\n                                          28\n\fspeech students may otherwise generally engage in regarding such issues is not\n\nbefore us. Different circumstances require different results. We consider here only\n\nwhether schools may prohibit the wearing of T-shirts on high school campuses and\n\nin high school classes that flaunt demeaning slogans, phrases or aphorisms relating\n\nto a core characteristic of particularly vulnerable students and that may cause them\n\nsignificant injury. We do not believe that the schools are forbidden to regulate\n\nsuch conduct. Nor, contrary to the dissent, do we believe that because a school\n\nsponsors or permits a “Day of Tolerance” or a “Day of Silence” minority students\n\nshould be required to publicly “[c]onfront[]” and “refut[e]” demeaning verbal\n\nassaults on them – that they may be left with no option other than to try to justify\n\ntheir sexual practices to the entire student body or explain to all their fellow\n\nstudents why they are not inferior or evil. Id. at 19. The First Amendment does\n\nnot require that young students be subjected to such a destructive and humiliating\n\nexperience.\n\n      In his declaration in the district court, the school principal justified his\n\nactions on the basis that “any shirt which is worn on campus which speaks in a\n\nderogatory manner towards an individual or group of individuals is not healthy for\n\nyoung people . . . .” If, by this, the principal meant that all such shirts may be\n\nbanned under Tinker, we do not agree. T-shirts proclaiming, “Young Republicans\n\n\n                                           29\n\fSuck,” or “Young Democrats Suck,” for example, may not be very civil but they\n\nwould certainly not be sufficiently damaging to the individual or the educational\n\nprocess to warrant a limitation on the wearer’s First Amendment rights. Similarly,\n\nT-shirts that denigrate the President, his administration, or his policies, or\n\notherwise invite political disagreement or debate, including debates over the war in\n\nIraq, would not fall within the “rights of others” Tinker prong.27\n\n      Although we hold that the School’s restriction of Harper’s right to carry\n\nmessages on his T-shirt was permissible under Tinker, we reaffirm the importance\n\nof preserving student speech about controversial issues generally and protecting\n\nthe bedrock principle that students “may not be confined to the expression of those\n\nsentiments that are officially approved.” Tinker, 393 U.S. at 511; see also Fraser,\n\n478 U.S. at 681 (noting students’ “freedom to advocate unpopular and\n\ncontroversial views in schools and classrooms”). It is essential that students have\n\nthe opportunity to engage in full and open political expression, both in and out of\n\nthe school environment. Engaging in controversial political speech, even when it\n\n\n      27\n         The dissent suggests that our decision might somehow allow a school to\nrestrict student T-shirts that voice strongly-worded opposition to the war in Iraq.\nSee dis. op. at 12. That is not so. Our colleague ignores the fact that our holding is\nlimited to injurious speech that strikes at a core identifying characteristic of\nstudents on the basis of their membership in a minority group. The anti-war T-\nshirts posited by the dissent constitute neither an attack on the basis of a student’s\ncore identifying characteristic nor on the basis of his minority status.\n                                           30\n\fis offensive to others, is an important right of all Americans and learning the value\n\nof such freedoms is an essential part of a public school education. Indeed, the\n\ninculcation of “the fundamental values necessary to the maintenance of a\n\ndemocratic political system” is “truly the ‘work of the schools.’” Fraser, 478 U.S.\n\nat 683 (quoting Tinker, 393 U.S. at 508). Limitations on student speech must be\n\nnarrow, and applied with sensitivity and for reasons that are consistent with the\n\nfundamental First Amendment mandate. Accordingly, we limit our holding to\n\ninstances of derogatory and injurious remarks directed at students’ minority status\n\nsuch as race, religion, and sexual orientation.28 Moreover, our decision is based\n\n\n      28\n         We do not consider here whether remarks based on gender warrant similar\ntreatment, preferring to leave that question to another time. We recognize,\nhowever, that problems of gender discrimination remain serious and that they exist\nthroughout learning institutions, from the public and religious schools to\ninstitutions of higher learning, not excluding the most prominent institutions in the\nnation.\n       Our dissenting colleague worries that offensive words directed at majority\ngroups such as Christians or whites will not be covered by our holding. See dis.\nop. at 21. There is, of course, a difference between a historically oppressed\nminority group that has been the victim of serious prejudice and discrimination and\na group that has always enjoyed a preferred social, economic and political status.\nGrowing up as a member of a minority group often carries with it psychological\nand emotional burdens not incurred by members of the majority. In any event, any\nverbal assault targeting majorities that might justify some form of action by school\nofficials is more likely to fall under the “substantial disruption” prong of Tinker or\nunder the Fraser rule permitting schools to prohibit “plainly offensive” speech.\n478 U.S. at 683; cf.

Thus, it is limited to conduct that\n\noccurs in public high schools (and in elementary schools).

Aside from\n\nprohibiting the wearing of the shirt, the School did not take the additional step of\n\npunishing the speaker: Harper was not suspended from school nor was the incident\n\nmade a part of his disciplinary record.\n\n      Under the circumstances present here, we conclude that the School’s actions\n\ndid not extend beyond the scope of the restrictions permitted by Tinker, and that\n\n\n      28\n        (...continued)\nlewd or sexual speech that, specially with adolescents, readily promotes\ndisruption”)\n                                          32\n\fthe district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Harper failed to\n\ndemonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of his free speech claim.\n\n             ii.    Substantial Disruption\n\n      The district court concluded that Harper had failed to demonstrate a\n\nlikelihood of success on the merits of his free speech claim because there was\n\nsufficient evidence to permit the school officials to “reasonably . . . forecast\n\nsubstantial disruption of or material interference with school activities.” Tinker,\n\n393 U.S. at 514. In so holding, the district court relied on the declarations of\n\nPrincipal Fisher, Assistant Principal Antrim, and LeMaster which described how\n\nthe previous year’s “Day of Silence” had resulted in “volatile behavior” and\n\n“tensions between students,” including physical altercations. The court also cited\n\nLeMaster’s testimony that he had observed disruption in the class that Harper\n\nattended while wearing the T-shirt, and Principal Fisher’s testimony that Harper\n\ntold him that a “tense verbal conversation with a group of students” had already\n\ntaken place due to the T-shirt’s message.\n\n      In light of our conclusion regarding the application of the “rights of others”\n\nprong of Tinker, we have no cause to decide whether the evidence would be\n\n\n\n\n                                            33\n\fsufficient to warrant denial of a preliminary injunction under the “substantial\n\ndisruption” prong as well.29\n\n      b.     Viewpoint Discrimination\n\n      In reaching our decision that Harper may lawfully be prohibited from\n\nwearing his T-shirt, we reject his argument that the School’s action constituted\n\nimpermissible viewpoint discrimination. The government is generally prohibited\n\n      29\n         Our recent decision in Frederick v. Morse, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793544\"><a href=\"/opinion/793544/joseph-frederick-v-deborah-morse-juneau-school-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1114</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2006),\nis in no respect inconsistent with this opinion. In Frederick, we held that a public\nhigh school’s suspension of a student for displaying off campus, during the\nrunning of the Winter Olympics Torch Relay, a banner that read “Bong Hits 4\nJesus,” violated Tinker. Frederick differs from the present case in four\nfundamental ways. First and foremost, Frederick did not address the “intrudes\nupon the rights of others” prong of Tinker, the ground upon which we base our\nholding here. Rather, the only issue in Frederick was whether the other Tinker\nprong – “substantial disruption” – was applicable. Second, in Frederick we\nconcluded that the school’s actions did not meet the “substantial disruption” prong\nbecause the school officials conceded that they punished the student’s display of\nthe banner not out of “concern that it would cause disruption” but because “the\nspeech promotes a social message contrary to the one favored by the school.” Id.\nat 1117-18. Here, although in view of our holding, we need not (and do not)\nconsider the “substantial disruption” prong of Tinker, the School presented\nevidence that it restricted Harper’s wearing of the T-shirt because it expected that\nhis doing so would cause substantial disruption. Third, Frederick involved\npunishing student speech that took place “outside the classroom, across the street\nfrom the school, during a non-curricular activity that was only partially supervised\nby school officials.” Id. at 1123. By contrast, Harper wore the offending T-shirt\nnot only on campus, but inside the classroom. Finally, in the case before us, the\nSchool adopted the least restrictive means of curing the injury; it simply forbade\nthe wearing of the garment. In Frederick, in contrast, the school authorities\npunished the student harshly for the purported (but non-existent) offense by\nsuspending him for ten days. Id. at 1116.\n                                         34\n\ffrom regulating speech “when the specific motivating ideology or the opinion or\n\nperspective of the speaker is the rationale for the restriction.” Rosenberger, 515\n\nU.S. at 829. However, as the district court correctly pointed out, speech in the\n\npublic schools is not always governed by the same rules that apply in other\n\ncircumstances. See Hazelwood, 484 U.S. at 266; Fraser, 478 U.S. at 685; West,\n\n206 F.3d at 1366 (schools may ban student speech that “could well be considered a\n\nform of political speech to be afforded First Amendment protection outside the\n\neducational setting”). Indeed, the Court in Tinker held that a school may prohibit\n\nstudent speech, even if the consequence is viewpoint discrimination, if the speech\n\nviolates the rights of other students or is materially disruptive. See Tinker, 393\n\nU.S. at 511 (stating school cannot prohibit “expression of one particular opinion”\n\nunless it makes a specific showing of constitutionally valid reasons); see also\n\nPorter v.

Thus, pursuant to Tinker,\n\ncourts have allowed schools to ban the display of Confederate flags despite the fact\n\nthat such a ban may constitute viewpoint discrimination. See Scott, 324 F.3d at\n\n\n                                          35\n\f1248 (upholding ban on Confederate flag where school officials presented\n\nevidence of racial tensions at the school); West, 206 F.3d at 1366 (same). While\n\nthe Confederate flag may express a particular viewpoint, “[i]t is not only\n\nconstitutionally allowable for school officials” to limit the expression of racially\n\nexplosive views, “it is their duty to do so.” Scott, 324 F.3d at 1249. Because, as\n\nwe have already explained, the record demonstrates that Harper’s speech intruded\n\nupon the rights of other students, the School’s restriction is permissible under\n\nTinker, and we must reject Harper’s viewpoint discrimination claim.30\n\n      The dissent claims that although the School may have been justified in\n\nbanning discussion of the subject of sexual orientation altogether, it cannot “gag[]\n\nonly those who oppose the Day of Silence.” Dis. op. at 11. As we have explained,\n\nhowever, although Tinker does not allow schools to restrict the non-invasive, non-\n\ndisruptive expression of political viewpoints, it does permit school authorities to\n\nrestrict “one particular opinion” if the expression would “impinge upon the rights\n\n\n\n      30\n        The cases on which Harper relies to support his viewpoint discrimination\nclaim involve the entirely different question whether schools may deny student\ngroups access to school resources on the basis of their religious viewpoint.

Accordingly, a school may permit students to discuss a particular subject\n\nwithout being required to allow them to launch injurious verbal assaults that\n\nintrude upon the rights of other students.\n\n      “A school need not tolerate student speech that is inconsistent with its basic\n\neducational mission, [] even though the government could not censor similar\n\nspeech outside the school.” Hazelwood Sch. Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111979\"><a href=\"/opinion/111979/hazelwood-school-dist-v-kuhlmeier/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">260</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 266\n\n(1988) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Part of a school’s “basic\n\neducational mission” is the inculcation of “fundamental values of habits and\n\nmanners of civility essential to a democratic society.” Fraser, 478 U.S. at 681\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). For this reason, public schools may permit,\n\nand even encourage, discussions of tolerance, equality and democracy without\n\nbeing required to provide equal time for student or other speech espousing\n\nintolerance, bigotry or hatred. As we have explained, supra pp. 28-29, because a\n\nschool sponsors a “Day of Religious Tolerance,” it need not permit its students to\n\nwear T-shirts reading, “Jews Are Christ-Killers” or “All Muslims Are Evil Doers.”\n\nSuch expressions would be “wholly inconsistent with the ‘fundamental values’ of\n\npublic school education.” Id. at 685-86. Similarly, a school that permits a “Day of\n\nRacial Tolerance,” may restrict a student from displaying a swastika or a\n\n\n                                             37\n\fConfederate Flag. See West, 206 F.3d at 1365-66. In sum, a school has the right to\n\nteach civic responsibility and tolerance as part of its basic educational mission; it\n\nneed not as a quid pro quo permit hateful and injurious speech that runs counter to\n\nthat mission.31\n\n      We again emphasize that we do not suggest that all debate as to issues\n\nrelating to tolerance or equality may be prohibited. As we have stated repeatedly,\n\nwe consider here only the question of T-shirts, banners, and other similar items\n\nbearing slogans that injure students with respect to their core characteristics. Other\n\nissues must await another day.\n\n2.    Free Exercise of Religion Claim\n\n      Harper also contends that the district court erred because he was entitled to a\n\npreliminary injunction as a result of the School’s violation of his rights under the\n\nFree Exercise Clause. He asserts that his wearing of the T-shirt was “motivated by\n\nsincerely held religious beliefs” regarding homosexuality32 and that the School\n\n\n      31\n        We note, incidentally, that the incident in question occurred on the\nday after the “Day of Silence,” and not on the day itself.\n      32\n         We do not, of course, consider whether Harper’s views are consistent with\nhis religion, nor do we ask whether his religion truly encourages homophobic\nconduct. Similarly, we do not consider whether the isolated excerpt from the New\nTestament, Romans 1:27, is representative of Christian doctrine generally. All\nsuch inquiries are beyond the judiciary’s authority. See Hernandez v. C.I.R., 490\n                                                                      (continued...)\n                                          38\n\f“punished” him for expressing them, or otherwise burdened the exercise of those\n\nviews. Additionally, Harper argues that the School “attempted to change” his\n\nreligious views and that this effort violated both the Free Exercise Clause and the\n\nEstablishment Clause.\n\n      The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment provides that Congress\n\nshall make no law “prohibiting the free exercise” of religion. U.S. Const. amend. I.\n\nThe Clause prohibits the government from “compel[ling] affirmation of religious\n\nbelief, punish[ing] the expression of religious doctrines it believes to be false,\n\nimpos[ing] special disabilities on the basis of religious views or religious status, or\n\nlend[ing] its power to one or the other side in controversies over religious authority\n\nor dogma.” Employment Div., Dep’t of Human Res. of Oregon v.

The Court held that a neutral law of\n\ngeneral applicability need not be supported by a compelling governmental interest\n\neven though it has the incidental effect of burdening religion.

Nor is there anything in the record to suggest\n\nthat other students wearing T-shirts similarly demeaning of gay and lesbian\n\nmembers of the student body would be treated differently, Christians or not.34\n\nUnder Smith, Harper’s claim would surely fail. Harper asserts, however, that we\n\nshould apply Sherbert’s strict scrutiny test to his free exercise claim because his is\n\na “hybrid” claim involving the Free Exercise Clause in conjunction with other\n\nconstitutional claims.35 The School disagrees, arguing that the district court\n\nproperly applied rational basis review under Smith because its prohibition of\n\n\n\n\n      34\n       Harper does not argue that the School’s ban on his wearing the injurious\nand demeaning T-shirt was arbitrary or capricious, only that it violated the First\nAmendment rights discussed herein.\n      35\n       Although Harper refers to “other constitutional claims” and even\n“numerous constitutional claims,” the only claim that has the potential to justify his\ninvoking of “hybrid” status is the free speech claim.\n                                           41\n\fHarper’s speech involved a “valid and neutral [rule] of general applicability.”36\n\nSmith, 494 U.S. at 879.\n\n      We seriously doubt that there is “a fair probability or a likelihood” that\n\nHarper’s claim that a companion right – free speech – has been violated will\n\nsucceed on the merits, as required by Miller. 176 F.3d at 1207 (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).37 In fact, we are fairly confident that it will not, for the reasons we\n\nhave explained supra Part V.1. Nevertheless, we need not decide whether Harper’s\n\nfree exercise claim is properly deemed a “hybrid” claim, because, whether or not\n\nSherbert’s strict scrutiny test applies, Harper cannot prevail here. “Under the\n\nSherbert test, governmental actions that substantially burden a religious practice\n\n\n\n\n      36\n         The district court determined that, “without the free speech claim,\nplaintiff’s free exercise claim does not require strict scrutiny.” It then ignored the\nfree speech claim, apparently because it had already found that it was unlikely to\nsucceed. Applying rational basis review, the court concluded that the School’s\naction was rationally based on a legitimate pedagogical concern, and that Harper\nfailed to demonstrate that it was irrational or wholly arbitrary.\n      37\n         We note that the School conceded in essence that the free speech claim was\n“colorable” for purposes of Harper’s establishing “irreparable harm” – one of the\nfactors that may in combination with others justify issuance of a preliminary\ninjunction. See supra pp. 10-12. We need not consider, however, whether\n“colorable” has different meanings for purposes of irreparable harm under\nSammartano, and for purposes of a hybrid claim under Miller, as we assume here\nthat Harper’s free speech claim is colorable for the latter purpose as well.\n                                          42\n\fmust be justified by a compelling governmental interest.”38 Smith, 494 U.S. at 883.\n\nIn this case, Harper flunks the test in every respect.\n\n      Assuming that Sherbert applies, we must first consider whether the School’s\n\nactions “substantially burden” a religious practice or belief. The record simply\n\ndoes not demonstrate that the School’s restriction regarding Harper’s T-shirt\n\nimposed a substantial burden upon the free exercise of Harper’s religious beliefs.\n\nThere is no evidence that the School “compell[ed] affirmation of a repugnant\n\nbelief,” “penalize[d] or discriminate[d] against [Harper] because [he] hold[s]\n\nreligious views abhorrent to the authorities,” or “condition[ed] the availability of\n\nbenefits upon [Harper’s] willingness to violate a cardinal principle of [his]\n\nreligious faith.” Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 402, 406. Nor did the School “lend its\n\npower to one or the other side in controversies over religious authority or dogma,”\n\nor “punish the expression of religious doctrines it believes to be false.” Smith, 494\n\nU.S. at 877.\n\n\n      38\n         We have described the Sherbert test as requiring the weighing of three\nfactors: (1) how much the state action interferes with the exercise of religious\nbeliefs; (2) whether there is a compelling state interest justifying a burden on\nreligious beliefs; and (3) whether accommodating those beliefs would unduly\ninterfere with the fulfillment of the government interest.

It simply prohibited him from wearing the offensive and disruptive\n\nshirt and required him to refrain from attending class for a portion of a day, if he\n\ninsisted on continuing to wear it. Nor did the restriction imposed on Harper’s\n\nwearing of the T-shirt constitute a substantial limitation on his right to express his\n\nreligious views. No one has the right to proclaim his views at all times in all\n\nmanners in all places, regardless of the circumstances, and Harper does not contend\n\nthat his religion suggests otherwise. Harper remains free to express his views,\n\nwhatever their merits, on other occasions and in other places. The prohibition\n\nagainst the wearing of a T-shirt in school does not constitute a substantial burden\n\non the exercise of his religious beliefs.\n\n      Even if a religious creed, or an individual’s interpretation of that creed,\n\ncould be said to require its adherents to proclaim their religious views at all times\n\nand in all places, and to do so in a manner that interferes with the rights of others,\n\nthe First Amendment would not prohibit the state from banning such disruptive\n\nconduct in certain circumstances, including on a high school campus. The\n\nConstitution does not authorize one group of persons to force its religious views on\n\nothers or to compel others to abide by its precepts. Nor does it authorize\n\n\n                                            44\n\findividuals to engage in conduct, including speech, on the grounds of public\n\nschools, that is harmful to other students seeking to obtain a fair and equal\n\neducation – even if those individuals hold a sincere belief that the principles of\n\ntheir religion require them to discriminate against others, or to publicly proclaim\n\ntheir discriminatory views whenever they believe that “evil” practices are being\n\ncondoned. See Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 403 (internal quotation marks omitted)\n\n(“[E]ven when the action is in accord with one’s religious convictions, it is not\n\ntotally free from legislative restrictions.”). Schools may prohibit students and\n\nothers from disrupting the educational process or causing physical or psychological\n\ninjury to young people entrusted to their care, whatever the motivations or beliefs\n\nof those engaged in such conduct. Indeed, the state’s interest in doing so is\n\ncompelling.\n\n      Because there is no evidence that the School’s restriction on Harper’s\n\nwearing of his T-shirt substantially burdened a religious practice or belief, and\n\nbecause the School has a compelling interest in providing a proper educational\n\nenvironment for its students and because its actions were narrowly tailored to\n\nachieve that end,39 it would appear that the district court did not abuse its discretion\n\n\n      39\n       As discussed earlier, the School did no more than necessary to further its\ncompelling interest in protecting the rights of students and maintaining a healthy\n                                                                       (continued...)\n                                           45\n\fin finding that Harper failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits as\n\nto his free exercise of religion claim. Before reaching that conclusion, however,\n\nwe must deal with one final argument that Harper raises as a part of that claim.\n\nHarper asserts that the School “attempted to change” his religious views that\n\n“homosexuality is harmful to both those who practice it and the community at\n\nlarge.” Specifically, Harper alleges that the school officials’ comments that his\n\nshirt was “inflammatory,” Detective Hubbert’s questioning of him, and Assistant\n\nPrincipal Giles’ statement that he leaves his Christian faith in the car when he\n\ncomes to school, all were attempts by school authorities to change his religious\n\nviews.\n\n      The district court rejected Harper’s contention. Indeed, there is no evidence\n\nin the record that the school representatives sought to change Harper’s religious\n\nbeliefs. Harper’s complaint avers that Detective Hubbert “proposed to [Harper]\n\nthat as a member of the Christian faith, he should understand that Christianity was\n\nbased on love not hate, and that [he] should not be offensive to others.” Hubbert’s\n\nhomily did not constitute an attempt to change Harper’s religious views, simply his\n\n\n\n      39\n        (...continued)\nlearning environment. It merely prohibited Harper from wearing the T-shirt at\nschool, and did not even take the additional step of suspending or otherwise\npunishing him.\n                                         46\n\foffensive behavior; at most, it was, as the district court concluded, an “option[]\n\npresented to and left with” Harper. The statements that the message on Harper’s\n\nshirt was “inflammatory” and would be harmful to the educational environment\n\nwere merely statements of fact that represented the School’s informed judgment.\n\nMore important, like Hubbert’s statement, they were designed to affect Harper’s\n\nbehavior not his beliefs. As for Giles’ comments, his affidavit stated that he did\n\nnot tell Harper to “leave his own faith in the car,” but explained that, as a school\n\nemployee, he, Giles, had to leave his own Christian faith in the car when he came\n\nto work. While Giles’ statement might also be construed as an attempt to\n\nencourage Harper to change his conduct – to refrain, while on campus, from\n\nexpressing religious views that denigrate others – it cannot be characterized as an\n\nattempt to change his views. In fact, rather than tell Harper to change his beliefs,\n\nGiles encouraged him to join the campus Bible Club so that he could become part\n\nof an “activity that would express his [Christian] opinions in a positive way on\n\ncampus,” an activity that was wholly consistent with Harper’s religious views. The\n\nrecord thus does not support Harper’s claim that the School violated his free\n\nexercise right by “attempting to change” his religious views.\n\n      Moreover, school officials’ statements and any other school activity\n\nintended to teach Harper the virtues of tolerance constitute a proper exercise of a\n\n\n                                          47\n\fschool’s educational function, even if the message conflicts with the views of a\n\nparticular religion. A public school’s teaching of secular democratic values does\n\nnot constitute an unconstitutional attempt to influence students’ religious beliefs.\n\nRather, it simply reflects the public school’s performance of its duty to educate\n\nchildren regarding appropriate secular subjects in an appropriate secular manner.\n\nAs we have reiterated earlier, “the inculcation of fundamental values necessary to\n\nthe maintenance of a democratic political system” is “truly the ‘work of the\n\nschools.’” Fraser, 478 U.S. at 681, 683 (quoting Ambach v. Norwick, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110055\"><a href=\"/opinion/110055/ambach-v-norwick/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n76-77 (1979); quoting Tinker, 393 U.S. at 508). Public schools are not limited to\n\nteaching materials that are consistent with all aspects of the views of all religions.\n\nSo long as the subject and materials are appropriate from an educational standpoint\n\nand the purpose of the instruction is secular, the school’s teaching is not subject to\n\na constitutional objection that it conflicts with a view held by members of a\n\nparticular religion. There is no evidence here that the school officials’ comments\n\nwere associated with a religious, as opposed to a secular, purpose. Their affidavits\n\ndemonstrate that the School acted in order to maintain a secure and healthy\n\nlearning environment for all its students, not to advance religion.\n\n      The Constitution does not preclude school districts from teaching the\n\nessential elements of democracy or otherwise performing their proper educational\n\n\n                                          48\n\fmission simply because some individuals or groups may assert that their religious\n\nviews are inconsistent with the lessons taught as a part of that mission.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the district court’s decision that Harper was not entitled to\n\na preliminary injunction on the basis of his free exercise claim.\n\n3.    Establishment Clause Claim\n\n      Finally, we consider the district court’s conclusion that Harper did not\n\ndemonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of his claim that the School\n\nviolated the Establishment Clause by attempting to “coerce” him into changing his\n\nreligious beliefs that “homosexuality is harmful to both those who practice it and\n\nthe community at large.”\n\n      Harper’s Establishment Clause claim as presented on appeal appears to be\n\nsimply a restatement of his Free Exercise claim. In fact, as the Supreme Court has\n\nnoted, its Establishment Clause cases “for the most part have addressed\n\ngovernmental efforts to benefit religion or particular religions,” and thus\n\nallegations of an “attempt to disfavor” a religion, such as Harper’s, are properly\n\nanalyzed under the Free Exercise Clause. Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 532 (emphasis\n\nadded). However, in the interest of thoroughness, we briefly address Harper’s\n\nclaim of “coercion” under the Establishment Clause.\n\n\n\n\n                                          49\n\f      Harper bases his claim almost entirely on the Supreme Court’s statement in\n\nLee v. Weisman, that “at a minimum, the Constitution guarantees that government\n\nmay not coerce anyone to support or participate in religion or its exercise, or\n\notherwise act in a way which ‘establishes a [state] religion or religious faith, or\n\ntends to do so.’”40 </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112779\"><a href=\"/opinion/112779/lee-v-weisman/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">577</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 587 (1992) (quoting Lynch v. Donnelly, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111113\"><a href=\"/opinion/111113/lynch-v-donnelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 678 (1984)). Here, there is no evidence that the School’s actions were based\n\non anything other than an entirely secular and legitimate aim of protecting the\n\nrights of students and promoting a tolerant and safe learning environment. There is\n\ncertainly no evidence (or even allegation) that school authorities sought to coerce\n\nor encourage Harper to participate in some other religion or to adopt some state-\n\nsupported or other religious faith. To reiterate what we explained in the “Free\n\nExercise” section of this opinion, the teaching of secular democratic values does\n\nnot violate the First Amendment, even if that teaching conflicts in some respect\n\nwith a sincerely held view that a student or his parents may attribute to the\n\nparticular religion to which they adhere.\n\n\n      40\n        The only other case upon which Harper relies for his coercion claim is\nPeloza v. Capistrano Unified Sch. Dist., in which this court observed that “[t]o\npermit [a teacher] to discuss his religious beliefs with students during school time\non school grounds would violate the Establishment Clause.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"679611\"><a href=\"/opinion/679611/john-e-peloza-v-capistrano-unified-school-district-board-of-trustees-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 522 (9th\nCir. 1994). Like Lee, the case is inapposite as it involves the entirely different\nissue of school-sanctioned religious speech which “would have the primary effect\nof advancing religion, and would entangle the school with religion.” Id.\n                                            50\n\f         Government conduct does not violate the Establishment Clause when (1) it\n\nhas a secular purpose, (2) its principal and primary effect neither advances nor\n\ninhibits religion, and (3) it does not foster excessive government entanglement in\n\nreligion. See Lemon v. Kurtzman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108380\"><a href=\"/opinion/108380/lemon-v-kurtzman/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">602</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 612-13 (1971). For the reasons\n\nwe have already explained, the record supports the district court’s conclusion that\n\nthe School’s actions “had a secular purpose, i.e., promoting tolerance, and not\n\nadvancing or inhibiting religion.” It is also clear from the record that the primary\n\neffect of the School’s banning of the T-shirt was not to advance or inhibit religion\n\nbut to protect and preserve the educational environment and the rights of other\n\nmembers of the student body. Nor can there be any question in this case of\n\nexcessive government entanglement in religion. Finally, as we have already\n\ndiscussed, there is no evidence in the record that school officials attempted to\n\nchange Harper’s religious beliefs. A fortiori, there is no evidence that they\n\nattempted to coerce Harper into changing his beliefs. For all the above reasons, we\n\nhold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Harper failed\n\nto demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of his Establishment Clause\n\nclaim.\n\n4.       Other Claims\n\n\n\n\n                                           51\n\f      In addition to the denial of his preliminary injunction motion, Harper asks\n\nthat we review the district court’s dismissal of his due process and equal protection\n\ncauses of action, as well as the court’s grant of qualified immunity to the individual\n\ndefendants, under the doctrine of “pendent appellate jurisdiction.” We may\n\nexercise pendent appellate jurisdiction “over rulings that are inextricably\n\nintertwined with or necessary to ensure meaningful review of decisions that are\n\nproperly before us on interlocutory appeal.” Poulos v. Caesars World, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787350\"><a href=\"/opinion/787350/william-h-poulos-brenda-mcelmore-larry-schreier-on-behalf-of-themselves/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">654</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 668 (9th Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). In order for\n\npendent issues to be “inextricably intertwined” they must either “‘(a) be so\n\nintertwined that we must decide the pendent issue in order to review the claims\n\nproperly raised on interlocutory appeal . . . or (b) resolution of the issue properly\n\nraised on interlocutory appeal necessarily resolves the pendent issue.’” Batzel v.\n\nSmith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782479\"><a href=\"/opinion/782479/ellen-l-batzel-a-citizen-of-the-state-of-california-v-robert-smith-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1023 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting Cunningham v. Gates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770823\"><a href=\"/opinion/770823/robert-cunningham-armand-soly-in-his-individual-capacity-as-successor-in/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1271</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1285 (9th Cir. 2000)).\n\n      With regard to Harper’s due process cause of action, it is based on his claim\n\nthat the School’s dress code is impermissibly vague in violation of the Due Process\n\nClause. As we have already explained, see supra note 11, we need not consider the\n\nvalidity of the School’s dress code in order to rule on the preliminary injunction.\n\nAs to Harper’s equal protection contention, as presented on this appeal it is simply\n\n\n                                          52\n\fa restatement of his viewpoint discrimination claim which, for the reasons already\n\nprovided, we have rejected. Whether or not there may be other aspects to the claim\n\nwe do not know with certainty at this point in the proceedings; thus we do not\n\nreview that claim here. Accordingly, neither the due process nor equal protection\n\nclaim is one we must decide in order to resolve the issue before us, and our\n\nresolution of the issue before us does not require us to determine the merits of\n\neither claim. Whatever the merits of those claims (and we have no cause here to\n\nquestion the district court’s decision as to either), their validity or invalidity is of\n\nno consequence here. Finally, the district court’s dismissal of Harper’s damages\n\nclaims based on a finding of qualified immunity is not “inextricably intertwined”\n\nwith the denial of the preliminary injunction motion, Poulos, 379 F.3d at 668, as\n\nwe need not “decide the [qualified immunity] issue in order to review the claims\n\nproperly raised on interlocutory appeal . . . .” Batzel, 333 F.3d at 1023 (quoting\n\nCunningham v. Gates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770823\"><a href=\"/opinion/770823/robert-cunningham-armand-soly-in-his-individual-capacity-as-successor-in/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1271</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1284 (9th Cir. 2000)).\n\n                                    VI. Conclusion\n\n       We hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the\n\npreliminary injunction. Harper failed to demonstrate that he will likely prevail on\n\nthe merits of his free speech, free exercise of religion, or establishment of religion\n\nclaims. In fact, such future success on Harper’s part is highly unlikely, given the\n\n\n                                            53\n\flegal principles discussed in this opinion. The Free Speech Clause permits public\n\nschools to restrict student speech that intrudes upon the rights of other students.\n\nInjurious speech that may be so limited is not immune from regulation simply\n\nbecause it reflects the speaker’s religious views. Accordingly, we affirm the\n\ndistrict court’s denial of Harper’s motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\nAFFIRMED; REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                          54\n\fExhibit A\n\n\n\n\n   55\n\f                                    COUNSEL\n\nRobert H.
