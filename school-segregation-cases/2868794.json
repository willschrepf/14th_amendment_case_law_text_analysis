S 1983. He challenges his continued\nconfinement in administrative custody, i.e., solitary\nconfinement. Shoats claims that Appellees, the\nPennsylvania Department of Corrections and Philip\nJohnson, Superintendent of SCI-Greene, have kept him in\nadministrative custody in violation of his Fourteenth\nAmendment right to procedural due process. He seeks\nimmediate release into the general prison population,\ndamages, and other relief.\n\nAlthough we hold that Shoats has a protected liberty\ninterest in being released from administrative confinement,\nwe conclude that SCI-Greene's procedures for evaluating\nwhether Shoats should remain in administrative custody\ncomported with procedural due process requirements.\nAccordingly, we will affirm.\n\nI. Factual Background\n\nIn 1970, Shoats was convicted of first degree murder for\nhis part in an attack on a Philadelphia police guardhouse.\n\n                                  2\n\fShoats participated in the attack as a member of a black\nrevolutionary group that sought to eradicate all authority.\nOne police officer was killed and another seriously wounded\nin the attack. Shoats was sentenced to life imprisonment.\nSeven years later, in September 1977, Shoats and several\nother inmates took over a cell block at the Huntingdon\nState Correctional Institution as part of an attempt to\nescape. Shoats injured several guards with a knife, and,\nalong with three other prisoners, attempted to escape from\nthe prison as planned. Two of the inmates were captured\nimmediately and a third was killed during the escape.\nShoats remained at large until he was captured in October\n1977.\n\nWhile Shoats was a fugitive, he entered the home of a\nprison guard and forced him, his wife, and theirfive year\nold son to drive him in their car to a location outside\nCokesburg, Pennsylvania. Shoats then ordered the hostages\nto enter the woods where he left them tied to a tree for\nalmost four hours. Shoats was captured, and convicted of\nescape, robbery, kidnaping and simple assault. He was\nlater transferred to Fairview State Hospital for the\ncriminally insane. In March 1979, Shoats had guns\nsmuggled in to him and escaped from that maximum\nsecurity institution, again taking a hostage. In addition to\nescape and taking hostages, Shoats also has a history of\nthreatening and assaulting his fellow inmates, and of\ncausing disruptions at the institutions in which he is\nincarcerated.\n\nPennsylvania correctional institutions have two basic\ntypes of housing, general population and restricted\nhousing. An inmate in general population may be permitted\nto be outside of his cell for lengthy periods throughout the\nday. General population inmates are permitted to have\ncontact visits at least one day per week, and may\nparticipate in educational and vocation programs, approved\ninmate organizations, and approved fund-raising projects.\n\nInmates in disciplinary and administrative custody are\nconfined in Restricted Housing Units (RHU). They are\nhoused in disciplinary custody when, following a hearing,\nthey have been found guilty of prison misconduct. The\nmaximum period that an inmate may be confined in\n\n                               3\n\fdisciplinary custody is ninety days. In contrast,\nadministrative custody is used to assure a safe and secure\nenvironment for all inmates and staff by separating those\ninmates whose presence in the general population\nconstitutes a threat to themselves, others, or the safety and\nsecurity of the institution, or who represent an escape risk.\nInmates in administrative custody are not allowed to have\nradios, televisions, telephone calls (except emergency or\nlegal), personal property except writing materials, or books\nother than legal materials and a personal religious volume.\nNon-legal visits of one per week are allowed under\nappropriate security procedures designated by the Program\nReview Committee (PRC). Pennsylvania does not provide\ninmates in administrative custody with educational\nprograms, and all meals are eaten in the inmates' cells.\n\nUnlike disciplinary custody, there is no maximum period\nof confinement in administrative custody. Rather, release\ndepends upon an evaluation of many factors. While time\nspent and behavior are to be considered, so too are\ncontinued risk, safety of others, and recommendations of\nprison personnel, including treatment staff.\n\nUnder Department of Corrections (DOC) policy, an inmate\nmust receive written notice of the reason for his placement\nin administrative custody and he is entitled to receive a\nhearing before a PRC within six days of the initial transfer\nto administrative custody. Every thirty days thereafter,\ninmates assigned to administrative custody have the\nopportunity to be personally interviewed by the PRC, which\nthen determines whether the inmate should continue to be\nmaintained in administrative custody, taking into account\na variety of factors including the safety of other inmates\nand staff, the continued public or institutional risk, and the\nrecommendation of treatment staff.\n\nIn addition to separation from the general prison\npopulation, the DOC may order that specific prisoners be\nseparated from each other and, if necessary, placed in\ndifferent institutions. The DOC may enter such orders after\nreviewing specific instances of misconduct, and determining\nthat specific separation is appropriate. As a result of such\nreview, Shoats currently has fifteen individuals from whom\nhe must be separated.\n\n                               4\n\fAs of 1989, Shoats was imprisoned at the State\nCorrectional Institution in Dallas, Pennsylvania (\"SCI-\nDallas\"), where he was placed in administrative custody. In\nNovember of that year he was transferred to the federal\npenitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas. When he returned to\nPennsylvania in June 1991, Shoats was again imprisoned\nat SCI-Dallas and again placed in administrative custody.\nIn January 1995, he was transferred to SCI-Greene, where\nhe continues to be held in administrative custody.\n\nShoats has spent an extraordinarily long period in\nadministrative custody. Nonetheless, his status has been\nsubject to PRC review every thirty days. No member of a\nPRC has ever recommended releasing Shoats from\nadministrative custody; they have universally concluded\nthat Shoats remains a significant danger to institutional\nsafety and security. These conclusions are supported by\nDOC psychological evaluations of Shoats, which\ncharacterize him as a remorseless sociopath knowledgeable\nin the workings of prisons and escape techniques, capable\nof leading other inmates in such undertakings, and inclined\nto do so. He has also been described as volatile and\nmanipulative.\n\nIn June 1998, the Secretary of the DOC asked Thomas\nJames, a special assistant to the Secretary, to conduct an\nextensive review to determine whether Shoats should\nremain in administrative custody. James recognized that\nsuch extended administrative custody was atypical for the\nprison population. He noted that Shoats' volatile nature\nand need to be separated from numerous other prisoners\nmake his situation unique. However, his review also\nconcluded that, as with other inmates who have a history\nof escape and violence against correctional officers and\nother inmates, Shoats' continued placement in\nadministrative custody is absolutely necessary.\n\nThereafter, Shoats brought this action pursuant to 42\nU.S.C. S 1983, seeking to be immediately released into the\ngeneral prison population. He also sought damages and\nother relief. He claims that the appellees, the Secretary of\nthe DOC and the Superintendent of SCI-Greene, have kept\nhim in administrative custody in violation of his Fourteenth\nAmendment right to procedural due process.\n\n                                5\n\fFollowing discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for\nsummary judgment. The District Court agreed with Shoats\nthat he possesses a protected liberty interest in obtaining\nrelease into the general population. However, adopting the\nrecommendation of the magistrate judge, the District Court\nheld that the defendants had provided Shoats with the\nprocess he was due and granted the defendants' motion for\nsummary judgment. This appeal followed.\n\nII. Discussion\n\nShoats claims that the duration of his placement in\nsolitary confinement, and the attendant hardships of such\nconfinement, require that we affirm the District Court's\nconclusion that he possesses a protected liberty interest in\nbeing released to the general prison population. He also\nclaims that Defendants did not afford him all of the process\nhe was due. The record evidence leads us to conclude that\nalthough Shoats' confinement is sufficient to trigger the\nprocedural protections of the Due Process Clause, the\nprocess provided him was sufficient to pass Constitutional\nmuster.\n\nA. Shoats' Liberty Interest\n\nIn analyzing a procedural due process claim, thefirst\nstep is to determine whether the nature of the interest is\none within the contemplation of the `liberty or property'\nlanguage of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Fuentes v.\nShevin, 407 U.S. 67 (1972). Once we determine that the\ninterest asserted is protected by the Due Process Clause,\nthe question then becomes what process is due to protect\nit. See Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 481 (1972).\n\nProtected liberty or property interests generally arise\neither from the Due Process Clause or from state-created\nstatutory entitlement. See Board of Regents v. Roth, 408\nU.S. 564, 575 (1972). In Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472\n(1995), the Supreme Court announced a new standard for\ndetermining whether prison conditions deprive a prisoner of\na liberty interest that is protected by procedural due\nprocess guarantees. Although the Court acknowledged that\nliberty interests could arise from means other than the Due\nProcess Clause itself, the Court concluded that state-\n\n                                6\n\fcreated liberty interests could arise only when a prison's\naction imposed an \"atypical and significant hardship on the\ninmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\"\n515 U.S. at 483.\n\nAt issue in Sandin was whether the plaintiff's thirty-day\ndetention in disciplinary custody in a Hawaii prison\nimpacted any protected liberty interest under the\nFourteenth Amendment. The Court concluded that the\nprisoner in Sandin did not have a protected liberty interest\nin remaining free of disciplinary detention or segregation\nbecause his thirty-day detention, although punitive,\"did\nnot exceed similar, but totally discretionary confinement in\neither duration or degree of restriction.\" Id. at 486. In\nfinding that the prisoner's thirty-day confinement in\ndisciplinary custody did not present the type of atypical,\nsignificant deprivation in which a State might conceivably\ncreate a liberty interest, the Court considered the following\ntwo factors: 1) the amount of time the prisoner was placed\ninto disciplinary segregation; and 2) whether the conditions\nof his confinement in disciplinary segregation were\nsignificantly more restrictive than those imposed upon\nother inmates in solitary confinement. Id.\n\nThe parties in this case do not dispute the fact that very\nfew Pennsylvania prisoners have been confined in\nadministrative custody for periods of eight years or more.\nBen Varner, the Superintendent who reviewed the PRC\ndecisions on Shoats, testified that to the best of his\nrecollection, approximately one percent of the inmate\npopulation at SCI-Greene has been confined in restricted\nhousing for such lengthy periods of time. (Varner Dep. at\n54-61; A145-52). Moreover, Thomas James, Special\nAssistant to DOC Commissioner Martin Horn, concedes\nthat the amount of time Shoats has already spent in\nadministrative confinement is not only atypical, but is\nindeed \"unique.\" A214-15.\n\nIn addition, the record suggests that Shoats' long-term\nconfinement has imposed a significant hardship on him in\nrelation to the ordinary incidents of prison life. Shoats has\nbeen confined in virtual isolation for almost eight years. See\nA45 (Shoats Dep.). He is confined in his cell for 23 hours a\nday, five days a week, and 24 hours a day, two days a\n\n                                7\n\fweek. Id. He eats meals by himself. Id. His sole contact is\nwith DOC officials, and has been denied contact with his\nfamily for almost eight years. Id. He is prohibited from\nparticipating in any educational, vocational, or other\norganizational activities. Id. He is prohibited from visiting\nthe library. Id. James concedes that he has never witnessed\none example of such permanent solitary confinement in his\n22 years with the DOC. See A211. Moreover, James\nexplained that he would be concerned about the\npsychological damage to an inmate after only 90 days of\nsuch confinement and would generally recommend transfer\nto the general population after 90 days as a consequence.\nSee A184-85, 188-90.\n\nBased on this record, we have no difficulty concluding\nthat eight years in administrative custody, with no prospect\nof immediate release in the near future, is \"atypical\" in\nrelation to the ordinary incidents of prison life, and that\nShoats' eight-year confinement subjects him to conditions\nthat differ significantly from \"routine\" prison conditions in\nPennsylvania state institutions.\n\nB. Shoats' Due Process Claim\n\nAlthough we hold that Shoats has a protected liberty\ninterest that has been adversely affected by his indefinite\nsegregation in administrative custody, we reject Shoats'\nargument that he has been deprived of the process he is\ndue under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nIn Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460 (1983), the Supreme\nCourt considered whether prison inmates were entitled to\ndue process before being placed in solitary confinement for\nadministrative -- rather than disciplinary -- reasons. The\nCourt expressly rejected the idea that due process required\na \"detailed adversary proceeding,\" on the ground that it\nwould not \"materially assist\" the decision to be made. Id. at\n473-74. The Court further held that in these situations, an\n\"informal, nonadversary review\" at which the prisoner has\nthe opportunity to state his views, satisfies the\nrequirements of due process:\n\n       An inmate must merely receive some notice of the\n       charges against him and an opportunity to present his\n       views to the prison official charged with deciding\n\n                               8\n\f       whether to transfer him to administrative segregation.\n       Ordinarily a written statement by the inmate will\n       accomplish this purpose, although prison\n       administrators may find it more useful to permit oral\n       presentations in cases where they believe a written\n       statement would be ineffective. So long as this occurs,\n       and the decisionmaker reviews the charges and then-\n       available evidence against the prisoner, the Due\n       Process Clause is satisfied.\n\nId. at 476.\n\nThe inmate in Hewitt received notice of the charges\nagainst him the day after his misconduct took place. Id. at\n477. Only five days after his transfer to administrative\nsegregation, a Hearing Committee reviewed the existing\nevidence against him. Id. Moreover, the inmate\nacknowledged on his misconduct form that he \"had the\nopportunity to have [his] version reported as part of the\nrecord,\" and thus had an opportunity to present a\nstatement to the Committee. Id. The Supreme Court held\nthat this proceeding plainly satisfied the Due Process\nrequirements for confinement of the inmate in\nadministrative custody. Id. Here, Shoats has been given\nexactly the same opportunities as those given to the inmate\nin Hewitt; there is therefore no question that, on its face,\nthe procedure provided to Shoats is constitutionally\nadequate.\n\nThe process provided by the Pennsylvania DOC to an\ninmate confined in administrative custody is as follows. A\nhearing is conducted by the PRC, in which the rationale for\nthe administrative custody placement is read and explained\nto the inmate. See A84. The inmate is permitted to respond\nto the rationale for administrative custody placement either\norally or in writing. Id. A Committee member then drafts a\nsummary of the inmate's statements. Id. A written\nsummary of the entire hearing is then prepared, which\nincludes the reasons relied upon by the PRC to reach its\ndecision, and a copy of this summary is given to the\ninmate. Id.\n\nAn inmate may appeal the PRC's decision to the\nSuperintendent in writing within two days of the completion\n\n                               9\n\fof the hearing,   and the decision of the Superintendent must\nbe forwarded to   the inmate within ten days of the receipt of\nthe appeal. See   A85. The inmate's right to appeal\nterminates when   he or she is released from administrative\ncustody. Id.\n\nAt least once every thirty days, those inmates assigned to\nadministrative custody have the right to be personally\ninterviewed by the PRC. Id. For those inmates not released\nfrom administrative custody following the thirty-day review,\nthe reasons for the PRC's decision are forwarded to the\nSuperintendent for his or her review. Id. If the\nSuperintendent agrees that the rationale for holding an\ninmate in administrative custody is reasonable, he or she\nnotifies the inmate accordingly. Id. If, however, the\nSuperintendent believes the inmate should be released to\nthe general population, he or she will so order it. Id.\n\nAfter an inmate is confined for ninety days in\nadministrative custody, the Superintendent must complete\na formal report to the Regional Deputy Commissioner, who\nthen reviews the recommendation of the institution to\ndetermine if any further action is necessary. Id. Further\naction may include release to the general population,\ntransfer to another facility or program, or continuation in\nadministrative custody. Id. In light of the standard set forth\nby the Supreme Court in Hewitt, we conclude that the\nPennsylvania procedures clearly comply with due process\nrequirements.\n\nThe record reflects that the procedures called for did in\nfact occur. Specific program review committee progress\nreports are included in the record, which reflect Shoats'\nchoice to appear at some, but not all, of his PRC reviews.\nThe reports reflect that Shoats raised and discussed\nvarious issues at these committee sessions, including his\ndesire for library time, complaints about the commissary\nand medical treatment, visitation rights, and other general\nmatters. In many instances, Shoats complained about the\ndenial of his release into the general population, and he\nwas advised of the prison's reasons for denying his release.\nThere is no indication that Shoats presented any\ncountervailing arguments or considerations to the review\ncommittee.\n\n                                 10\n\fShoats does not argue that he was denied the\nopportunity to respond or be heard, nor does he argue that\nthe prison authorities failed to consider favorable\ninformation or that they otherwise dealt with his case in a\nperfunctory fashion. Cf. Sourbeer v. Robinson , 791 F.2d\n1094, 1101 (3d Cir. 1986). In fact, Shoats does not contend\nthat he made any arguments, or offered any favorable\nfactual data to counter the prison's rationale for holding\nhim. Rather, Shoats argues that his continued confinement\nin administrative custody is based solely on his past crimes\nof murder, escape, kidnaping and assault, and therefore\nhas no contemporaneous justification. (Appellant's Br. at\n42-48). We disagree. Shoats is not confined to\nadministrative custody simply because he committed\ncrimes in the past, but because he is, in the considered\njudgment of all the prison professionals who have evaluated\nhim, a current threat to the security and good order of the\ninstitution, and to the safety of other people. See A238-44\n(Mistrick Dep.). This assessment is based partly on Shoats'\nconduct, but also on the prison professionals' current\nimpressions of him based on their day-to-day dealings with\nShoats over time. See, e.g., A243 (Mistrick Dep.)(\"[H]e\nrepresents a danger to the secure running of the institution\nand the safety of others\"); A115 (Varner Dep.)(\"[I]n my\nopinion, this man was still a danger\"); A169 (White Dep.)(\"I\nfelt he was still dangerous\").\n\nEven were we to conclude that Shoats' continued\nconfinement in administrative custody is based solely on\nhis past crimes, the process he received would nonetheless\npass constitutional muster, because predictions of likely\nfuture behavior based on a generally volatile criminal\ncharacter have been upheld by the Supreme Court:\n\n       In assessing the seriousness of a threat to institutional\n       security, prison administrators necessarily draw on\n       more than the specific facts surrounding a particular\n       incident; instead, they must consider the character of\n       the inmates confined in the institution, recent and\n       longstanding relations between prisoners and guards,\n       prisoners inter se, and the like. In the volatile\n       atmosphere of a prison, an inmate easily may\n       constitute an unacceptable threat to the safety of other\n\n                                11\n\f       prisoners and guards even if he himself has committed\n       no misconduct; rumor, reputation, and even more\n       imponderable factors may suffice to spark potentially\n       disastrous incidents. The judgment of prison officials in\n       this context, like that of those making parole decisions,\n       turns largely on purely subjective evaluations and on\n       predictions of future behavior.\n\nSee Hewitt, 459 U.S. at 474 (internal citations omitted).\nThus, Shoats could conceivably be held in administrative\ncustody merely because his prior crimes reasonably\nforeshadow future misconduct.\n\nShoats also claims that his confinement is the result of\nthe \"bias\" of Superintendent Varner, who reviewed his\nconfinement at SCI-Greene, first as a member of the PRC\nand later as Superintendent. (Appellant's Br. at 38-39).\nHowever, Shoats' administrative custody dates back to\n1991, long before Shoats came to SCI-Greene, and it has\ncontinued to the present, long after Varner left SCI-Greene\nin April 1998. No member of the PRC, and no\nSuperintendent, at SCI-Greene or elsewhere, has ever\nrecommended that Shoats be released to the general prison\npopulation. Thus, we hold that Shoats' \"bias\" argument is\nwithout foundation.\n\nShoats' confinement in administrative custody has been,\nin accordance with the DOC regulations, reviewed every\nmonth by the PRC and the Superintendent. Furthermore,\nShoats has been given the opportunity to present his views\npersonally at each review. See A85-86. In effect, the record\ndemonstrates that Shoats' continued placement in\nadministrative custody is supported by evidence sufficient\nto pass constitutional muster. Because Shoats has failed to\nprovide any support for his assertions that his PRC reviews\nwere constitutionally inadequate, we hold that the periodic\nreviews conducted by the PRC here comport with the\nminimum constitutional standards for due process.\n\nIII.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the district court's decision.\n\n                               12\n\fA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                               13\n\f",

S 1983. He challenges his continued\nconfinement in administrative custody, i.e., solitary\nconfinement. Shoats claims that Appellees, the\nPennsylvania Department of Corrections and Philip\nJohnson, Superintendent of SCI-Greene, have kept him in\nadministrative custody in violation of his Fourteenth\nAmendment right to procedural due process. He seeks\nimmediate release into the general prison population,\ndamages, and other relief.\n\nAlthough we hold that Shoats has a protected liberty\ninterest in being released from administrative confinement,\nwe conclude that SCI-Greene's procedures for evaluating\nwhether Shoats should remain in administrative custody\ncomported with procedural due process requirements.\nAccordingly, we will affirm.\n\nI. Factual Background\n\nIn 1970, Shoats was convicted of first degree murder for\nhis part in an attack on a Philadelphia police guardhouse.\n\n                                  2\n\fShoats participated in the attack as a member of a black\nrevolutionary group that sought to eradicate all authority.\nOne police officer was killed and another seriously wounded\nin the attack. Shoats was sentenced to life imprisonment.\nSeven years later, in September 1977, Shoats and several\nother inmates took over a cell block at the Huntingdon\nState Correctional Institution as part of an attempt to\nescape. Shoats injured several guards with a knife, and,\nalong with three other prisoners, attempted to escape from\nthe prison as planned. Two of the inmates were captured\nimmediately and a third was killed during the escape.\nShoats remained at large until he was captured in October\n1977.\n\nWhile Shoats was a fugitive, he entered the home of a\nprison guard and forced him, his wife, and theirfive year\nold son to drive him in their car to a location outside\nCokesburg, Pennsylvania. Shoats then ordered the hostages\nto enter the woods where he left them tied to a tree for\nalmost four hours. Shoats was captured, and convicted of\nescape, robbery, kidnaping and simple assault. He was\nlater transferred to Fairview State Hospital for the\ncriminally insane. In March 1979, Shoats had guns\nsmuggled in to him and escaped from that maximum\nsecurity institution, again taking a hostage. In addition to\nescape and taking hostages, Shoats also has a history of\nthreatening and assaulting his fellow inmates, and of\ncausing disruptions at the institutions in which he is\nincarcerated.\n\nPennsylvania correctional institutions have two basic\ntypes of housing, general population and restricted\nhousing. An inmate in general population may be permitted\nto be outside of his cell for lengthy periods throughout the\nday. General population inmates are permitted to have\ncontact visits at least one day per week, and may\nparticipate in educational and vocation programs, approved\ninmate organizations, and approved fund-raising projects.\n\nInmates in disciplinary and administrative custody are\nconfined in Restricted Housing Units (RHU). They are\nhoused in disciplinary custody when, following a hearing,\nthey have been found guilty of prison misconduct. The\nmaximum period that an inmate may be confined in\n\n                               3\n\fdisciplinary custody is ninety days. In contrast,\nadministrative custody is used to assure a safe and secure\nenvironment for all inmates and staff by separating those\ninmates whose presence in the general population\nconstitutes a threat to themselves, others, or the safety and\nsecurity of the institution, or who represent an escape risk.\nInmates in administrative custody are not allowed to have\nradios, televisions, telephone calls (except emergency or\nlegal), personal property except writing materials, or books\nother than legal materials and a personal religious volume.\nNon-legal visits of one per week are allowed under\nappropriate security procedures designated by the Program\nReview Committee (PRC). Pennsylvania does not provide\ninmates in administrative custody with educational\nprograms, and all meals are eaten in the inmates' cells.\n\nUnlike disciplinary custody, there is no maximum period\nof confinement in administrative custody. Rather, release\ndepends upon an evaluation of many factors. While time\nspent and behavior are to be considered, so too are\ncontinued risk, safety of others, and recommendations of\nprison personnel, including treatment staff.\n\nUnder Department of Corrections (DOC) policy, an inmate\nmust receive written notice of the reason for his placement\nin administrative custody and he is entitled to receive a\nhearing before a PRC within six days of the initial transfer\nto administrative custody. Every thirty days thereafter,\ninmates assigned to administrative custody have the\nopportunity to be personally interviewed by the PRC, which\nthen determines whether the inmate should continue to be\nmaintained in administrative custody, taking into account\na variety of factors including the safety of other inmates\nand staff, the continued public or institutional risk, and the\nrecommendation of treatment staff.\n\nIn addition to separation from the general prison\npopulation, the DOC may order that specific prisoners be\nseparated from each other and, if necessary, placed in\ndifferent institutions. The DOC may enter such orders after\nreviewing specific instances of misconduct, and determining\nthat specific separation is appropriate. As a result of such\nreview, Shoats currently has fifteen individuals from whom\nhe must be separated.\n\n                               4\n\fAs of 1989, Shoats was imprisoned at the State\nCorrectional Institution in Dallas, Pennsylvania (\"SCI-\nDallas\"), where he was placed in administrative custody. In\nNovember of that year he was transferred to the federal\npenitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas. When he returned to\nPennsylvania in June 1991, Shoats was again imprisoned\nat SCI-Dallas and again placed in administrative custody.\nIn January 1995, he was transferred to SCI-Greene, where\nhe continues to be held in administrative custody.\n\nShoats has spent an extraordinarily long period in\nadministrative custody. Nonetheless, his status has been\nsubject to PRC review every thirty days. No member of a\nPRC has ever recommended releasing Shoats from\nadministrative custody; they have universally concluded\nthat Shoats remains a significant danger to institutional\nsafety and security. These conclusions are supported by\nDOC psychological evaluations of Shoats, which\ncharacterize him as a remorseless sociopath knowledgeable\nin the workings of prisons and escape techniques, capable\nof leading other inmates in such undertakings, and inclined\nto do so. He has also been described as volatile and\nmanipulative.\n\nIn June 1998, the Secretary of the DOC asked Thomas\nJames, a special assistant to the Secretary, to conduct an\nextensive review to determine whether Shoats should\nremain in administrative custody. James recognized that\nsuch extended administrative custody was atypical for the\nprison population. He noted that Shoats' volatile nature\nand need to be separated from numerous other prisoners\nmake his situation unique. However, his review also\nconcluded that, as with other inmates who have a history\nof escape and violence against correctional officers and\nother inmates, Shoats' continued placement in\nadministrative custody is absolutely necessary.\n\nThereafter, Shoats brought this action pursuant to 42\nU.S.C. S 1983, seeking to be immediately released into the\ngeneral prison population. He also sought damages and\nother relief. He claims that the appellees, the Secretary of\nthe DOC and the Superintendent of SCI-Greene, have kept\nhim in administrative custody in violation of his Fourteenth\nAmendment right to procedural due process.\n\n                                5\n\fFollowing discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for\nsummary judgment. The District Court agreed with Shoats\nthat he possesses a protected liberty interest in obtaining\nrelease into the general population. However, adopting the\nrecommendation of the magistrate judge, the District Court\nheld that the defendants had provided Shoats with the\nprocess he was due and granted the defendants' motion for\nsummary judgment. This appeal followed.\n\nII. Discussion\n\nShoats claims that the duration of his placement in\nsolitary confinement, and the attendant hardships of such\nconfinement, require that we affirm the District Court's\nconclusion that he possesses a protected liberty interest in\nbeing released to the general prison population. He also\nclaims that Defendants did not afford him all of the process\nhe was due. The record evidence leads us to conclude that\nalthough Shoats' confinement is sufficient to trigger the\nprocedural protections of the Due Process Clause, the\nprocess provided him was sufficient to pass Constitutional\nmuster.\n\nA. Shoats' Liberty Interest\n\nIn analyzing a procedural due process claim, thefirst\nstep is to determine whether the nature of the interest is\none within the contemplation of the `liberty or property'\nlanguage of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Fuentes v.\nShevin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108568\"><a href=\"/opinion/108568/fuentes-v-shevin/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1972). Once we determine that the\ninterest asserted is protected by the Due Process Clause,\nthe question then becomes what process is due to protect\nit. See Morrissey v. Brewer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108606\"><a href=\"/opinion/108606/morrissey-v-brewer/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 481 (1972).\n\nProtected liberty or property interests generally arise\neither from the Due Process Clause or from state-created\nstatutory entitlement. See Board of Regents v. Roth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108608\"><a href=\"/opinion/108608/board-of-regents-of-state-colleges-v-roth/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 575 (1972). In Sandin v. Conner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1995), the Supreme Court announced a new standard for\ndetermining whether prison conditions deprive a prisoner of\na liberty interest that is protected by procedural due\nprocess guarantees. Although the Court acknowledged that\nliberty interests could arise from means other than the Due\nProcess Clause itself, the Court concluded that state-\n\n                                6\n\fcreated liberty interests could arise only when a prison's\naction imposed an \"atypical and significant hardship on the\ninmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\"\n515 U.S. at 483.\n\nAt issue in Sandin was whether the plaintiff's thirty-day\ndetention in disciplinary custody in a Hawaii prison\nimpacted any protected liberty interest under the\nFourteenth Amendment. The Court concluded that the\nprisoner in Sandin did not have a protected liberty interest\nin remaining free of disciplinary detention or segregation\nbecause his thirty-day detention, although punitive,\"did\nnot exceed similar, but totally discretionary confinement in\neither duration or degree of restriction.\" Id. at 486. In\nfinding that the prisoner's thirty-day confinement in\ndisciplinary custody did not present the type of atypical,\nsignificant deprivation in which a State might conceivably\ncreate a liberty interest, the Court considered the following\ntwo factors: 1) the amount of time the prisoner was placed\ninto disciplinary segregation; and 2) whether the conditions\nof his confinement in disciplinary segregation were\nsignificantly more restrictive than those imposed upon\nother inmates in solitary confinement. Id.\n\nThe parties in this case do not dispute the fact that very\nfew Pennsylvania prisoners have been confined in\nadministrative custody for periods of eight years or more.\nBen Varner, the Superintendent who reviewed the PRC\ndecisions on Shoats, testified that to the best of his\nrecollection, approximately one percent of the inmate\npopulation at SCI-Greene has been confined in restricted\nhousing for such lengthy periods of time. (Varner Dep. at\n54-61; A145-52). Moreover, Thomas James, Special\nAssistant to DOC Commissioner Martin Horn, concedes\nthat the amount of time Shoats has already spent in\nadministrative confinement is not only atypical, but is\nindeed \"unique.\" A214-15.\n\nIn addition, the record suggests that Shoats' long-term\nconfinement has imposed a significant hardship on him in\nrelation to the ordinary incidents of prison life. Shoats has\nbeen confined in virtual isolation for almost eight years. See\nA45 (Shoats Dep.). He is confined in his cell for 23 hours a\nday, five days a week, and 24 hours a day, two days a\n\n                                7\n\fweek. Id. He eats meals by himself. Id. His sole contact is\nwith DOC officials, and has been denied contact with his\nfamily for almost eight years. Id. He is prohibited from\nparticipating in any educational, vocational, or other\norganizational activities. Id. He is prohibited from visiting\nthe library. Id. James concedes that he has never witnessed\none example of such permanent solitary confinement in his\n22 years with the DOC. See A211. Moreover, James\nexplained that he would be concerned about the\npsychological damage to an inmate after only 90 days of\nsuch confinement and would generally recommend transfer\nto the general population after 90 days as a consequence.\nSee A184-85, 188-90.\n\nBased on this record, we have no difficulty concluding\nthat eight years in administrative custody, with no prospect\nof immediate release in the near future, is \"atypical\" in\nrelation to the ordinary incidents of prison life, and that\nShoats' eight-year confinement subjects him to conditions\nthat differ significantly from \"routine\" prison conditions in\nPennsylvania state institutions.\n\nB. Shoats' Due Process Claim\n\nAlthough we hold that Shoats has a protected liberty\ninterest that has been adversely affected by his indefinite\nsegregation in administrative custody, we reject Shoats'\nargument that he has been deprived of the process he is\ndue under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nIn Hewitt v. Helms, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110829\"><a href=\"/opinion/110829/hewitt-v-helms/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">460</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1983), the Supreme\nCourt considered whether prison inmates were entitled to\ndue process before being placed in solitary confinement for\nadministrative -- rather than disciplinary -- reasons. The\nCourt expressly rejected the idea that due process required\na \"detailed adversary proceeding,\" on the ground that it\nwould not \"materially assist\" the decision to be made. Id. at\n473-74. The Court further held that in these situations, an\n\"informal, nonadversary review\" at which the prisoner has\nthe opportunity to state his views, satisfies the\nrequirements of due process:\n\n       An inmate must merely receive some notice of the\n       charges against him and an opportunity to present his\n       views to the prison official charged with deciding\n\n                               8\n\f       whether to transfer him to administrative segregation.\n       Ordinarily a written statement by the inmate will\n       accomplish this purpose, although prison\n       administrators may find it more useful to permit oral\n       presentations in cases where they believe a written\n       statement would be ineffective. So long as this occurs,\n       and the decisionmaker reviews the charges and then-\n       available evidence against the prisoner, the Due\n       Process Clause is satisfied.\n\nId. at 476.\n\nThe inmate in Hewitt received notice of the charges\nagainst him the day after his misconduct took place. Id. at\n477. Only five days after his transfer to administrative\nsegregation, a Hearing Committee reviewed the existing\nevidence against him. Id. Moreover, the inmate\nacknowledged on his misconduct form that he \"had the\nopportunity to have [his] version reported as part of the\nrecord,\" and thus had an opportunity to present a\nstatement to the Committee. Id. The Supreme Court held\nthat this proceeding plainly satisfied the Due Process\nrequirements for confinement of the inmate in\nadministrative custody. Id. Here, Shoats has been given\nexactly the same opportunities as those given to the inmate\nin Hewitt; there is therefore no question that, on its face,\nthe procedure provided to Shoats is constitutionally\nadequate.\n\nThe process provided by the Pennsylvania DOC to an\ninmate confined in administrative custody is as follows. A\nhearing is conducted by the PRC, in which the rationale for\nthe administrative custody placement is read and explained\nto the inmate. See A84. The inmate is permitted to respond\nto the rationale for administrative custody placement either\norally or in writing. Id. A Committee member then drafts a\nsummary of the inmate's statements. Id. A written\nsummary of the entire hearing is then prepared, which\nincludes the reasons relied upon by the PRC to reach its\ndecision, and a copy of this summary is given to the\ninmate. Id.\n\nAn inmate may appeal the PRC's decision to the\nSuperintendent in writing within two days of the completion\n\n                               9\n\fof the hearing,   and the decision of the Superintendent must\nbe forwarded to   the inmate within ten days of the receipt of\nthe appeal. See   A85. The inmate's right to appeal\nterminates when   he or she is released from administrative\ncustody. Id.\n\nAt least once every thirty days, those inmates assigned to\nadministrative custody have the right to be personally\ninterviewed by the PRC. Id. For those inmates not released\nfrom administrative custody following the thirty-day review,\nthe reasons for the PRC's decision are forwarded to the\nSuperintendent for his or her review. Id. If the\nSuperintendent agrees that the rationale for holding an\ninmate in administrative custody is reasonable, he or she\nnotifies the inmate accordingly. Id. If, however, the\nSuperintendent believes the inmate should be released to\nthe general population, he or she will so order it. Id.\n\nAfter an inmate is confined for ninety days in\nadministrative custody, the Superintendent must complete\na formal report to the Regional Deputy Commissioner, who\nthen reviews the recommendation of the institution to\ndetermine if any further action is necessary. Id. Further\naction may include release to the general population,\ntransfer to another facility or program, or continuation in\nadministrative custody. Id. In light of the standard set forth\nby the Supreme Court in Hewitt, we conclude that the\nPennsylvania procedures clearly comply with due process\nrequirements.\n\nThe record reflects that the procedures called for did in\nfact occur. Specific program review committee progress\nreports are included in the record, which reflect Shoats'\nchoice to appear at some, but not all, of his PRC reviews.\nThe reports reflect that Shoats raised and discussed\nvarious issues at these committee sessions, including his\ndesire for library time, complaints about the commissary\nand medical treatment, visitation rights, and other general\nmatters. In many instances, Shoats complained about the\ndenial of his release into the general population, and he\nwas advised of the prison's reasons for denying his release.\nThere is no indication that Shoats presented any\ncountervailing arguments or considerations to the review\ncommittee.\n\n                                 10\n\fShoats does not argue that he was denied the\nopportunity to respond or be heard, nor does he argue that\nthe prison authorities failed to consider favorable\ninformation or that they otherwise dealt with his case in a\nperfunctory fashion. Cf. Sourbeer v. Robinson , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"470972\"><a href=\"/opinion/470972/sourbeer-gregory-s-in-no-85-5273-v-robinson-william-commissioner-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">791</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1094</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1101 (3d Cir. 1986). In fact, Shoats does not contend\nthat he made any arguments, or offered any favorable\nfactual data to counter the prison's rationale for holding\nhim. Rather, Shoats argues that his continued confinement\nin administrative custody is based solely on his past crimes\nof murder, escape, kidnaping and assault, and therefore\nhas no contemporaneous justification. (Appellant's Br. at\n42-48). We disagree. Shoats is not confined to\nadministrative custody simply because he committed\ncrimes in the past, but because he is, in the considered\njudgment of all the prison professionals who have evaluated\nhim, a current threat to the security and good order of the\ninstitution, and to the safety of other people. See A238-44\n(Mistrick Dep.). This assessment is based partly on Shoats'\nconduct, but also on the prison professionals' current\nimpressions of him based on their day-to-day dealings with\nShoats over time. See, e.g., A243 (Mistrick Dep.)(\"[H]e\nrepresents a danger to the secure running of the institution\nand the safety of others\"); A115 (Varner Dep.)(\"[I]n my\nopinion, this man was still a danger\"); A169 (White Dep.)(\"I\nfelt he was still dangerous\").\n\nEven were we to conclude that Shoats' continued\nconfinement in administrative custody is based solely on\nhis past crimes, the process he received would nonetheless\npass constitutional muster, because predictions of likely\nfuture behavior based on a generally volatile criminal\ncharacter have been upheld by the Supreme Court:\n\n       In assessing the seriousness of a threat to institutional\n       security, prison administrators necessarily draw on\n       more than the specific facts surrounding a particular\n       incident; instead, they must consider the character of\n       the inmates confined in the institution, recent and\n       longstanding relations between prisoners and guards,\n       prisoners inter se, and the like. In the volatile\n       atmosphere of a prison, an inmate easily may\n       constitute an unacceptable threat to the safety of other\n\n                                11\n\f       prisoners and guards even if he himself has committed\n       no misconduct; rumor, reputation, and even more\n       imponderable factors may suffice to spark potentially\n       disastrous incidents. The judgment of prison officials in\n       this context, like that of those making parole decisions,\n       turns largely on purely subjective evaluations and on\n       predictions of future behavior.\n\nSee Hewitt, 459 U.S. at 474 (internal citations omitted).\nThus, Shoats could conceivably be held in administrative\ncustody merely because his prior crimes reasonably\nforeshadow future misconduct.\n\nShoats also claims that his confinement is the result of\nthe \"bias\" of Superintendent Varner, who reviewed his\nconfinement at SCI-Greene, first as a member of the PRC\nand later as Superintendent. (Appellant's Br. at 38-39).\nHowever, Shoats' administrative custody dates back to\n1991, long before Shoats came to SCI-Greene, and it has\ncontinued to the present, long after Varner left SCI-Greene\nin April 1998. No member of the PRC, and no\nSuperintendent, at SCI-Greene or elsewhere, has ever\nrecommended that Shoats be released to the general prison\npopulation. Thus, we hold that Shoats' \"bias\" argument is\nwithout foundation.\n\nShoats' confinement in administrative custody has been,\nin accordance with the DOC regulations, reviewed every\nmonth by the PRC and the Superintendent. Furthermore,\nShoats has been given the opportunity to present his views\npersonally at each review. See A85-86. In effect, the record\ndemonstrates that Shoats' continued placement in\nadministrative custody is supported by evidence sufficient\nto pass constitutional muster. Because Shoats has failed to\nprovide any support for his assertions that his PRC reviews\nwere constitutionally inadequate, we hold that the periodic\nreviews conducted by the PRC here comport with the\nminimum constitutional standards for due process.\n\nIII.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the district court's decision.\n\n                               12\n\fA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                               13\n\f</pre>",
