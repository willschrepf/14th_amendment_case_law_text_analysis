Decker, IV, of The Decker Law Firm, P.A., Live Oak, and Bruce\nRobinson of Robinson, Kennon, Kendron, P.A., Stephen A. Smith, and Thomas T.\nDemas, Lake City, for Petitioner.\n\nAlbert J. Wollermann and Trudy Innes Richardson, Guilday, Schwartz, Simpson,\nWest, Hatch & Lowe, P.A., Tallahassee, for Respondents.\n\n\nOSTERHAUS, J.\n\n      The petition in this matter seeks to quash a discovery order in a wrongful\n\ndeath action. Citing the privacy provision, article I, section 23, of the Florida\n\fConstitution, and the rules of civil procedure, the personal representative of\n\nTabitha Antico’s estate (Petitioner) objects to an order entered by the trial court\n\nallowing Respondents’ expert to conduct a limited inspection of the cell phone that\n\nMs. Antico allegedly was using when an automobile accident caused her death. We\n\nconclude, however, that the order does not depart from the essential requirements\n\nof law and deny the petition.\n\n                                           I.\n\n      On September 5, 2012, a truck operated by the Respondents collided with a\n\nvehicle driven by Ms. Antico and she was killed. Six months later, the decedent’s\n\nestate filed a wrongful death action, but Respondents denied liability. Respondents\n\nasserted that the decedent was either comparatively negligent or was the sole cause\n\nof the accident because she was distracted by her iPhone. Numerous times\n\nRespondents requested data from the decedent’s cellphone, which has been kept\n\nunused by the Petitioner since shortly after the accident. And while Respondents\n\nreceived some calling and texting records from the decedent’s wireless provider,\n\nother cellphone data was not disclosed, such as use and location information,\n\ninternet website access history, email messages, and social and photo media posted\n\nand reviewed on the day of the accident.\n\n      Respondents moved for an order from the trial court permitting an expert to\n\ninspect the cellphone’s data from the day of the accident. Petitioner objected to the\n\n\n                                           2\n\fcellphone inspection citing the decedent’s privacy rights under the Florida\n\nConstitution. After a hearing, the trial court granted Respondents’ motion.\n\n      The order allowing the inspection recognized both Respondents’ discovery\n\nrights and the privacy interest asserted by the Petitioner. It stressed the relevance of\n\nthe requested information, citing cell phone records showing that the decedent had\n\nbeen texting in the minutes preceding the accident; testimony from two witnesses\n\nindicating that the decedent may have been utilizing her cell phone at the time of\n\nthe accident; and testimony from the responding troopers supporting the assertion\n\nthat the decedent was using her cell phone when the accident occurred.\n\n      The order also recognized the decedent’s privacy interests and set strict\n\nparameters for the expert’s confidential inspection. It provided that the expert\n\ncould examine the cellphone, at Respondents’ expense, in the presence of\n\nPetitioner’s counsel at an agreed date, place, and time. Petitioner’s counsel could\n\nalso video the inspection. The order enumerated the following steps to be followed\n\nby the expert:\n\n      (1) Install write-protect software to ensure no alteration of the\n          phone’s hard drive would be made during the inspection;\n\n      (2) Download a copy of the cell phone’s hard drive, making a master\n          copy, a review copy, a copy for Petitioner’s counsel;\n\n      (3) Return the cell phone to Petitioner’s counsel immediately after\n          copying the hard drive;\n\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\f       (4) Review only the data on the hard drive for the nine-hour period\n           permitted by the Court (including call records, text messages,\n           web searches, emails sent and received, uploads, downloads, data\n           changes and GPS data);\n\n       (5) Prepare a summary of the data reviewed, including type of data,\n           use of data, date/time of data, and any other information s/he\n           deems relevant.\n\n       (6) Provide the summary to Petitioner’s counsel prior to the\n           dissemination of any more specific findings. Petitioner’s counsel\n           shall have ten (10) days from service to file a Motion for\n           Protective Order or other form of objection to the release of all or\n           a portion of the data, citing grounds for each objection.\n\n       (7) If no objection is interposed by the Petitioner, then Respondents’\n           expert may release his or her findings to Respondents’ counsel.\n\nThe order suggested that the hard drive copying process would take between ten\n\nminutes and two hours. And only if Petitioner’s counsel did not object could the\n\nexpert make findings available to Respondents’ counsel.\n\n       After the court granted Respondents’ motion, Petitioner filed a timely\n\npetition for writ of certiorari.\n\n                                          II.\n\n                                         A.\n\n       As a threshold matter, a petition for writ of certiorari is the correct vehicle\n\nfor reviewing Petitioner’s privacy-related objections to the trial court’s discovery\n\norder. We have noted previously that certiorari relief involving an order\n\ncompelling discovery is available “when the order departs from the essential\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\frequirements of law, causing irreparable harm that cannot be remedied on plenary\n\nappeal.” Poston v. Wiggins, 112 So. 3d 783, 785 (Fla. 1st DCA 2013) (quoting\n\nHeekin v. Del Col, 60 So. 3d 437, 438 (Fla. 1st DCA 2011)). The irreparable harm\n\npart of this analysis is jurisdictional. Id. It is satisfied in this case because\n\nirreparable harm can be presumed where a discovery order compels production of\n\nmatters implicating privacy rights. Rasmussen v. S. Florida Blood Serv., Inc., 500\n\nSo. 2d 533, 536–37 (Fla. 1987); see also Holland v. Barfield, 35 So. 3d 953, 956\n\n(Fla. 5th DCA 2010) (having to disclose a computer hard drive and a cellphone\n\nSIM card demonstrates irreparable harm). 1 And so, Petitioner will be entitled to\n\nrelief if the order below departs from the essential requirements of law.\n\n                                         B.\n\n      Petitioner argues that the cellphone inspection order violates the decedent’s\n\nprivacy rights and doesn’t comport with the rules of civil procedure because it\n\npermits inspection of “all data” on the decedent’s cellphone. Petitioner considers\n\nthe inspection “an improper fishing expedition in a digital ocean.”\n\n      Generally speaking, Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.280 allows for the\n\ndiscovery of matters that are relevant and admissible, or reasonably calculated to\n\nlead to admissible evidence, including electronically stored information. See Fla.\n\nR. Civ. P. 1.280(b)(1), (b)(3), 1.350 (2013); see also Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.280(d)\n\n1\n  See also Riley v. California, 134 S. Ct. 2473, 2489–91 (2014) (recognizing\nprivacy interests in electronic information stored on a cellphone).\n\n                                          5\n\f(addressing limitations on the discovery of electronically stored information). But\n\nwhere personal information is involved as in this case, the trial courts’ discretion to\n\npermit discovery “must be balanced against the individual’s competing privacy\n\ninterests to prevent an undue invasion of privacy.” McEnany v. Ryan, 44 So. 3d\n\n245, 247 (Fla. 4th DCA 2010). Courts have reversed rulings for not adequately\n\naccounting for privacy interests in the inspection of electronic storage devices. See,\n\ne.g., Holland, 35 So. 3d at 955 (reversing an order allowing the inspection of a\n\ncomputer hard drive and cellphone SIM card); Menke v. Broward Cnty. Sch. Bd.,\n\n916 So. 2d 8, 12 (Fla. 4th DCA 2005) (reversing an order allowing the inspection\n\nof all computers in a household).\n\n      But, contrary to Petitioner’s argument, privacy rights do not completely\n\nforeclose the prospect of discovery of data stored on electronic devices. Rather,\n\nlimited and strictly controlled inspections of information stored on electronic\n\ndevices may be permitted. See Menke, 916 So. 2d at 11 (“[Rule 1.350 is] broad\n\nenough to encompass requests to examine [electronic information storage devices]\n\nbut only in limited and strictly controlled circumstances”); cf. Friedman v. Heart\n\nInst. of Port St. Lucie, Inc., 863 So. 2d 189, 194 (Fla. 2003) (finding that privacy\n\nrights limit compelled disclosure to that which is necessary to determine contested\n\nissues). Both Holland and Menke, for instance, would have allowed for inspections\n\nof the devices involved (computers and cellphones) if: (1) there was evidence of\n\n\n                                          6\n\fdestruction of evidence or thwarting of discovery; (2) the device likely contained\n\nthe requested information; and (3) no less intrusive means existed to obtain the\n\nrequested information. Holland 35 So. 3d at 955; Menke, 916 So. 2d at 12.\n\n                                        C.\n\n      Which brings us to this case. The record here indicates that the trial court\n\nclosely considered how to balance Respondents’ discovery rights and the\n\ndecedent’s privacy rights. The order highlighted the relevance of the cellphone’s\n\ndata to the Respondents’ defense and it set forth strict procedures controlling how\n\nthe inspection process would proceed.\n\n      The context of Respondents’ discovery request is quite important. The trial\n\ncourt didn’t allow the inspection simply because Respondents made assertions that\n\ndecedent was on her cellphone, or because the decedent happened to possess a\n\ncellphone in her car. This case does not involve an unanchored fishing expedition\n\nas Petitioner alleges. Rather, Respondents supported their motion to inspect the\n\ncellphone with specific evidence. Respondents cited cell phone records showing\n\nthat the decedent was texting just before the accident; two witnesses indicated that\n\nthe decedent may have used her cell phone at the time of the accident; and troopers\n\nresponding to the accident lent support to the conclusion that the decedent was\n\nusing her cell phone when the accident occurred. Additionally, no one has disputed\n\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\fthat the decedent’s smartphone may contain very relevant information. As\n\nRespondents put it below:\n\n      With GPS enabled phones, such as [the decedent’s] iPhone, there is a\n      very high probability that if the GPS feature were enabled, we can\n      look at the data and figure out conclusively what happened in the\n      moments leading up to the accident, i.e. whether she stopped at the\n      stop sign or not and whether she was texting, Facebooking, Tweeting,\n      or nothing at the time of the accident.\n\n      It’s long been true that “[t]he more relevant and necessary the desired\n\ninformation is to a resolution of the case, the greater the state’s interest in allowing\n\ndiscovery of the information.” S. Florida Blood Serv., Inc. v. Rasmussen, 467 So.\n\n2d 798, 803 (Fla. 3d DCA 1985), approved, 500 So. 2d 533 (Fla. 1987). And here,\n\nwe agree with the trial court that Respondents’ discovery request comports with\n\nthe rules allowing for discovery of relevant information, including information\n\nfrom devices like cellphones, see Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.280(b)(1), and that their interest\n\nin the discovery of this particular data is quite substantial.\n\n      The other side of the equation—the countervailing privacy interest involved\n\nwith the discovery of data on a cellphone—is also very important. See S. Florida\n\nBlood Serv., Inc., 467 So. 2d at 803 (recognizing the court’s obligation to\n\nminimize the impact on competing interests). But we are satisfied that the order\n\nadequately safeguards privacy interests under the circumstances here where\n\nPetitioner was given the opportunity, but advanced no alternative plan. As detailed\n\nabove, the trial court’s order strictly controls how the confidential inspection must\n\n                                            8\n\fproceed: it limits the data that the expert may review to the nine-hour period\n\nimmediately surrounding the accident; it gives Petitioner’s counsel a front-row seat\n\nto monitor the inspection process; and it allows Petitioner the opportunity to\n\ninterpose objections before Respondents can obtain any of the data. This certainly\n\nisn’t a case like Holland, for example, where the trial court’s order allowed a\n\nrespondent “to review, without limit or time frame, all of the information on [a]\n\nmobile phone SIM card without regard to [privacy rights and privileges].” Holland,\n\n35 So. 3d at 956. See also Root v. Balfour Beatty Constr., 132 So. 3d 867, 870\n\n(Fla. 2d DCA 2014) (warning against “carte blanche discovery”).\n\n      We don’t agree with Petitioner that the trial court erred by allowing\n\nRespondents’ expert to first inspect the cellphone. See, e.g., Menke, 916 So. 2d at\n\n12. Petitioner did not offer or argue to the trial court below to use its own expert. In\n\nfact, Petitioner remained silent at the hearing when the trial court openly stated its\n\nuncertainty about “who looks at [the cellphone], what they do with the\n\ninformation, who they report it to, [and] how we protect the privacy interest of the\n\nperson [and provide] a chance to object to the dissemination, . . . I haven’t got this\n\nall formed in my head yet.” Though the trial court expressly invited Petitioner “to\n\nsubmit . . . language that you think would work that protects the privacy and\n\ninterest,” the order notes that Petitioner didn’t propose “any less intrusive manner\n\nto obtain the requested data.” The trial court was left ultimately to accept the\n\n\n                                           9\n\frepresentation of Petitioner’s counsel that he was “unable to obtain some of the\n\nrequested information . . . from Plaintiff.” Under these circumstances, where\n\nPetitioner offered nothing in response to the court’s privacy concerns and open\n\ninvitation to propose a different process, we cannot conclude that the trial court\n\nerred by allowing Respondents’ expert retrieve the cellphone’s data under limited\n\nand controlled conditions.\n\n      Finally, we find no error with the order having allowed the expert to review\n\n“all data” on the cellphone for the nine-hour period surrounding the time of the\n\naccident. While Petitioner has apparently possessed the cellphone since the\n\naccident, the trial court’s order noted that she didn’t “indicate the quantity, nature\n\nor type of any information on plaintiff’s decedent’s cell phone, or if any such\n\ninformation was, in fact, privileged.” Nor did the Petitioner proffer “any less\n\nintrusive manner to obtain the requested data.” It would appear that the only way to\n\ndiscover whether the decedent used her cellphone’s integrated software at the time\n\nof the accident, or drafted a text, dialed a number, searched for contact\n\ninformation, reviewed an old message, or used any other of the smartphone’s many\n\nfeatures, is by broadly inspecting data associated with all of the cellphone’s\n\napplications. Or, at least, if an effective and superior privacy-respecting plan for\n\nsegregating inspection-permissible from -impermissible data exists, it hasn’t been\n\npresented to the court. And so, we cannot conclude that the trial court violated the\n\n\n                                         10\n\fessential requirements of law by permitting a thorough inspection of the cellphone\n\nfor the nine-hour period on the day of the accident.2\n\n                                         III.\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, the PETITION IS DENIED.\n\nLEWIS, C.J., and THOMAS, J., CONCUR.\n\n\n\n\n2\n  We needn’t resolve Respondents’ additional contention that Petitioner lacks\nstanding in this case to assert the decedent’s constitutional privacy rights. The trial\ncourt didn’t pass on this question. And, as discussed above, relief isn’t warranted\neven if we assume (as this opinion does) that Petitioner can assert the decedent’s\nprivacy rights.\n\n                                          11\n\f",

And only if Petitioner’s counsel did not object could the\n\nexpert make findings available to Respondents’ counsel.\n\n       After the court granted Respondents’ motion, Petitioner filed a timely\n\npetition for writ of certiorari.\n\n                                          II.\n\n                                         A.\n\n       As a threshold matter, a petition for writ of certiorari is the correct vehicle\n\nfor reviewing Petitioner’s privacy-related objections to the trial court’s discovery\n\norder. We have noted previously that certiorari relief involving an order\n\ncompelling discovery is available “when the order departs from the essential\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\frequirements of law, causing irreparable harm that cannot be remedied on plenary\n\nappeal.” Poston v.

See,\n\ne.g., Holland, 35 So. 3d at 955 (reversing an order allowing the inspection of a\n\ncomputer hard drive and cellphone SIM card); Menke v. Broward Cnty. Sch. Bd.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1620774\"><a href=\"/opinion/1620774/menke-v-broward-county-school-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">916</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 12 (Fla. 4th DCA 2005) (reversing an order allowing the inspection\n\nof all computers in a household).\n\n      But, contrary to Petitioner’s argument, privacy rights do not completely\n\nforeclose the prospect of discovery of data stored on electronic devices. Rather,\n\nlimited and strictly controlled inspections of information stored on electronic\n\ndevices may be permitted. See Menke, 916 So. 2d at 11 (“[Rule 1.350 is] broad\n\nenough to encompass requests to examine [electronic information storage devices]\n\nbut only in limited and strictly controlled circumstances”); cf. Friedman v.

Both Holland and Menke, for instance, would have allowed for inspections\n\nof the devices involved (computers and cellphones) if: (1) there was evidence of\n\n\n                                          6\n\fdestruction of evidence or thwarting of discovery; (2) the device likely contained\n\nthe requested information; and (3) no less intrusive means existed to obtain the\n\nrequested information. Holland 35 So. 3d at 955; Menke, 916 So. 2d at 12.\n\n                                        C.\n\n      Which brings us to this case. The record here indicates that the trial court\n\nclosely considered how to balance Respondents’ discovery rights and the\n\ndecedent’s privacy rights. The order highlighted the relevance of the cellphone’s\n\ndata to the Respondents’ defense and it set forth strict procedures controlling how\n\nthe inspection process would proceed.\n\n      The context of Respondents’ discovery request is quite important. The trial\n\ncourt didn’t allow the inspection simply because Respondents made assertions that\n\ndecedent was on her cellphone, or because the decedent happened to possess a\n\ncellphone in her car. This case does not involve an unanchored fishing expedition\n\nas Petitioner alleges. Rather, Respondents supported their motion to inspect the\n\ncellphone with specific evidence. Respondents cited cell phone records showing\n\nthat the decedent was texting just before the accident; two witnesses indicated that\n\nthe decedent may have used her cell phone at the time of the accident; and troopers\n\nresponding to the accident lent support to the conclusion that the decedent was\n\nusing her cell phone when the accident occurred. Additionally, no one has disputed\n\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\fthat the decedent’s smartphone may contain very relevant information. As\n\nRespondents put it below:\n\n      With GPS enabled phones, such as [the decedent’s] iPhone, there is a\n      very high probability that if the GPS feature were enabled, we can\n      look at the data and figure out conclusively what happened in the\n      moments leading up to the accident, i.e. whether she stopped at the\n      stop sign or not and whether she was texting, Facebooking, Tweeting,\n      or nothing at the time of the accident.\n\n      It’s long been true that “[t]he more relevant and necessary the desired\n\ninformation is to a resolution of the case, the greater the state’s interest in allowing\n\ndiscovery of the information.” S. Florida Blood Serv., Inc. v. Rasmussen, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 798, 803 (Fla. 3d DCA 1985), approved, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1708601\"><a href=\"/opinion/1708601/rasmussen-v-south-florida-blood-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">533</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla. 1987). And here,\n\nwe agree with the trial court that Respondents’ discovery request comports with\n\nthe rules allowing for discovery of relevant information, including information\n\nfrom devices like cellphones, see Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.280(b)(1), and that their interest\n\nin the discovery of this particular data is quite substantial.\n\n      The other side of the equation—the countervailing privacy interest involved\n\nwith the discovery of data on a cellphone—is also very important. See S. Florida\n\nBlood Serv., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 803 (recognizing the court’s obligation to\n\nminimize the impact on competing interests). But we are satisfied that the order\n\nadequately safeguards privacy interests under the circumstances here where\n\nPetitioner was given the opportunity, but advanced no alternative plan. As detailed\n\nabove, the trial court’s order strictly controls how the confidential inspection must\n\n                                            8\n\fproceed: it limits the data that the expert may review to the nine-hour period\n\nimmediately surrounding the accident; it gives Petitioner’s counsel a front-row seat\n\nto monitor the inspection process; and it allows Petitioner the opportunity to\n\ninterpose objections before Respondents can obtain any of the data. This certainly\n\nisn’t a case like Holland, for example, where the trial court’s order allowed a\n\nrespondent “to review, without limit or time frame, all of the information on [a]\n\nmobile phone SIM card without regard to [privacy rights and privileges].” Holland,\n\n35 So. 3d at 956. See also Root v. Balfour Beatty Constr., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">867</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 870\n\n(Fla. 2d DCA 2014) (warning against “carte blanche discovery”).\n\n      We don’t agree with Petitioner that the trial court erred by allowing\n\nRespondents’ expert to first inspect the cellphone. See, e.g., Menke, 916 So. 2d at\n\n12. Petitioner did not offer or argue to the trial court below to use its own expert. In\n\nfact, Petitioner remained silent at the hearing when the trial court openly stated its\n\nuncertainty about “who looks at [the cellphone], what they do with the\n\ninformation, who they report it to, [and] how we protect the privacy interest of the\n\nperson [and provide] a chance to object to the dissemination, . . . I haven’t got this\n\nall formed in my head yet.” Though the trial court expressly invited Petitioner “to\n\nsubmit . . . language that you think would work that protects the privacy and\n\ninterest,” the order notes that Petitioner didn’t propose “any less intrusive manner\n\nto obtain the requested data.” The trial court was left ultimately to accept the\n\n\n                                           9\n\frepresentation of Petitioner’s counsel that he was “unable to obtain some of the\n\nrequested information . . . from Plaintiff.” Under these circumstances, where\n\nPetitioner offered nothing in response to the court’s privacy concerns and open\n\ninvitation to propose a different process, we cannot conclude that the trial court\n\nerred by allowing Respondents’ expert retrieve the cellphone’s data under limited\n\nand controlled conditions.\n\n      Finally, we find no error with the order having allowed the expert to review\n\n“all data” on the cellphone for the nine-hour period surrounding the time of the\n\naccident. While Petitioner has apparently possessed the cellphone since the\n\naccident, the trial court’s order noted that she didn’t “indicate the quantity, nature\n\nor type of any information on plaintiff’s decedent’s cell phone, or if any such\n\ninformation was, in fact, privileged.” Nor did the Petitioner proffer “any less\n\nintrusive manner to obtain the requested data.” It would appear that the only way to\n\ndiscover whether the decedent used her cellphone’s integrated software at the time\n\nof the accident, or drafted a text, dialed a number, searched for contact\n\ninformation, reviewed an old message, or used any other of the smartphone’s many\n\nfeatures, is by broadly inspecting data associated with all of the cellphone’s\n\napplications. Or, at least, if an effective and superior privacy-respecting plan for\n\nsegregating inspection-permissible from -impermissible data exists, it hasn’t been\n\npresented to the court. And so, we cannot conclude that the trial court violated the\n\n\n                                         10\n\fessential requirements of law by permitting a thorough inspection of the cellphone\n\nfor the nine-hour period on the day of the accident.2\n\n                                         III.\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, the PETITION IS DENIED.\n\nLEWIS, C.J., and THOMAS, J., CONCUR.\n\n\n\n\n2\n  We needn’t resolve Respondents’ additional contention that Petitioner lacks\nstanding in this case to assert the decedent’s constitutional privacy rights. The trial\ncourt didn’t pass on this question. And, as discussed above, relief isn’t warranted\neven if we assume (as this opinion does) that Petitioner can assert the decedent’s\nprivacy rights.\n\n                                          11\n\f</pre>",
