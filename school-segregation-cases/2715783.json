Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. §§ 37.001-.011 (West 1986 &amp; Supp. 1994).  We will\r\naffirm the trial-court judgment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn appeal number 3-93-439-CV, Elaine Badouh Hale appeals a trial-court order\r\nauthorizing the guardian of Mrs. Badouh's estate to settle a lawsuit pending in Bexar County.  We\r\nwill affirm the trial-court order. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span> <center><strong>THE CONTROVERSY</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tRubylien Barber Badouh has severe end-stage Parkinson's Disease and requires\r\ncontinuous home-nursing care.  Edward Badouh, Jr. (\"Edward\") and Elaine Badouh Hale\r\n(\"Elaine\") are Mrs. Badouh's children.  For some years, Elaine managed Mrs. Badouh's estate\r\nunder a durable power of attorney.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn January 1992, Edward applied to the court below for the appointment of a\r\nperson, named in the application, as guardian of Mrs. Badouh's estate, averring that she was\r\nincompetent and unable to manage her estate.  <em>See</em> Act of May 23, 1987, 70th Leg., R.S., ch.\r\n463, § 3, 1987 Tex. Gen. Laws 2050 (Tex. Probate Code Ann. § 111, since amended).<sup> (2)</sup>  The\r\ncourt appointed Kimbel Brown to serve in that proceeding as Mrs. Badouh's attorney ad litem. \r\n<em>See </em>Act of May 23, 1989, 71st Leg., R.S., ch. 1261, § 1, 1989 Tex. Gen. Laws 5082 (Tex. Prob.\r\nCode Ann. § 113A, since repealed) (\"section 113A\").  Elaine also appeared in the cause.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tElaine and Mrs. Badouh opposed Edward's application on the ground that it was\r\nunnecessary because Mrs. Badouh's estate was already sufficiently protected because she had\r\nexecuted a \"declaration of guardian\" in the event of later incompetence.  This document, signed\r\nby Mrs. Badouh after Edward filed the application, appointed John Thomas Ragusa guardian of\r\nMrs. Badouh's estate should she become incompetent.   Edward filed a contest to the \"declaration\r\nof guardian,\" alleging Elaine had procured Mrs. Badouh's execution of the document through\r\nfraud and duress.  Additionally, Edward sued for a declaratory judgment setting aside the\r\ndeclaration of guardian, the durable power of attorney under which Elaine had acted for several\r\nyears, and a \"living will\" that Mrs. Badouh had executed earlier.  He also requested an accounting\r\nregarding transactions Elaine had made under the power of attorney, including payments to herself\r\nand her family, and judgment for any sums found owing by Elaine.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter trial, the jury found:  (1) Mrs. Badouh was currently of unsound mind, and\r\nwas of unsound mind when she executed the \"declaration of guardian\" and (2) Elaine breached \r\nfiduciary duties owed Mrs. Badouh under the power of attorney by taking funds for herself and\r\nthird parties from Mrs. Badouh's bank accounts.  The jury fixed at $157,501.50 the amount taken\r\nin violation of Elaine's fiduciary duties.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe jury failed to find:  (1) Mrs. Badouh was of unsound mind when she executed\r\nthe durable power of attorney or the living will; or (2) that Elaine unduly influenced or exerted\r\nduress on Mrs. Badouh to obtain her signature on any of the three documents.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial court rendered judgment against Elaine on the jury's verdict and appointed\r\nKimbel Brown guardian of Mrs. Badouh's estate.<sup> (3)</sup>  Elaine appeals the portion of the judgment\r\nrendered against her.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><center>STANDING OR CAPACITY TO SUE</center></strong>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn her first point of error, Elaine asserts that Edward did not have standing to\r\nmaintain claims against her.  Edward responds<sup> (4)</sup> that he sued only in a representative capacity on\r\nMrs. Badouh's behalf.  He argues, therefore, that the issue is his <em>capacity</em> to sue as Mrs. Badouh's\r\nrepresentative, not his standing as an individual.  We agree.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\"Standing\" and \"capacity\" are distinct concepts.  <em>See Develo-cepts, Inc. v. City of\r\nGalveston</em>, 668 S.W.2d 790, 793 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1984, no writ).  The doctrine\r\nof \"standing\" inquires whether a cause of action belongs to the party who asserts it.  <em>See Hunt v.\r\nBass</em>, 664 S.W.2d 323, 324 (Tex. 1984); <em>Williams v. Anderson</em>, 850 S.W.2d 281, 283 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Austin 1993, writ denied).  If the person to whom the cause of action belongs is\r\nincompetent, another person may maintain the action, in a representative capacity, on the\r\nincompetent person's behalf.     </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen a person sues as a representative for an incompetent person, the incompetent\r\nperson is the real party plaintiff.  <em>Henderson v. Shell Oil Co.</em>, 182 S.W.2d 994, 995 (Tex. 1944);\r\n<em>McGinnis v. McGinnis</em>, 267 S.W.2d 432, 435 (Tex. Civ. App.--San Antonio 1954, no writ). \r\nTherefore, <em>Mrs. Badouh</em> is the person who must have standing to bring the claims pressed in her\r\nname by Edward.  The issue with regard to Edward is whether he may lawfully act as Mrs.\r\nBadouh's representative.  We will therefore address Elaine's point of error as a complaint\r\nregarding Edward's capacity to sue as Mrs. Badouh's representative.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEdward asserts he was entitled to sue on Mrs. Badouh's behalf under former\r\nsection 113 of the Probate Code.  That statute provides as follows: </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAny person has the right to appear and contest the appointment of a particular\r\nperson as guardian, or to contest any proceeding which he deems to be injurious\r\nto the ward, or to commence any proceeding which he deems beneficial to the\r\nward.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Edward contends he was also entitled to act as Mrs. Badouh's \"next friend\" under Texas Rule of\r\nCivil Procedure 44, which provides in part:  \"[P]ersons non compos mentis who have no legal\r\nguardian may sue and be represented by `next friend'\"  Elaine acknowledges Edward sued on\r\nMrs. Badouh's behalf.<sup> (5)</sup>  She complains, however, that he did not expressly assert his\r\nrepresentative capacity in his pleadings.<sup> (6)</sup>  \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA party suing in representative capacity should expressly allege his right to sue on\r\nbehalf of the person he represents.  <em>See, e.g.</em>, <em>McGinnis</em>, 267 S.W.2d at 435; 2 <em>Texas Civil\r\nPractice</em> § 8.8, at 189 (Diane M. Allen et al. eds., 1992 ed.).  However, if a party fails to allege\r\nthe proper capacity, the omission is curable by amendment.  <em>Rainey-Mapes v. Queen Charters,\r\nInc.</em>, 729 S.W.2d 907, 911 (Tex. App.--San Antonio 1987, writ dism'd w.r.m); <em>Develo-cepts</em> <em>Inc.</em>,\r\n668 S.W.2d at 793.  Thus, a defendant who contests the plaintiff's right to recover in the capacity\r\nin which he sues must raise the issue in the trial court in a verified plea, unless the truth of such\r\nmatters appears of record.<sup> (7)</sup>  Tex. R. Civ. P. 90, 93(2); <em>Pledger v. Schoelkopf</em>, 762 S.W.2d 145,\r\n146 (Tex. 1988).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAlthough Elaine filed a verified plea in abatement, she did not contest Edward's\r\ncapacity, but asserted instead that Edward lacked <em>standing</em> to assert Mrs. Badouh's claims.  Even\r\nif we liberally construe Elaine's plea in abatement as contesting Edward's right to maintain the\r\naction in a representative capacity for Mrs. Badouh, the record does not reflect that the trial court\r\nruled on the plea.<sup> (8)</sup>  If a party does not specifically point out in writing a defect in pleading and\r\nobtain a ruling, the party is deemed to have waived the complaint.  Tex. R. Civ. P. 90; Tex. R.\r\nApp. P. 52(a); <em>Vestal v. Jackson</em>, 598 S.W.2d 724, 725 (Tex. Civ. App.--Waco 1980, no writ)\r\n(appellate court may not consider complaint regarding trial court's refusal to abate action where\r\nrecord does not reflect trial court's action on plea in abatement).  Because Elaine waived her\r\ncomplaint regarding Edward's right to sue in a representative capacity, we overrule her first point\r\nof error.      </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><center>ATTORNEY'S FEES</center></strong>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn her second point of error, Elaine contends the trial court abused its discretion\r\nby awarding Edward attorney's fees under section 37.009 of the Uniform Declaratory Judgments\r\nAct.  <em>See</em> Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 37.009 (West 1986).  She argues that the\r\ndeclaratory judgment setting aside the \"declaration of guardian\" was improper because the issues\r\nraised in that claim were already pending in the guardianship proceeding.  Elaine asserts that\r\nEdward joined the claim for declaratory relief to the claim for breach of fiduciary duty merely to\r\nsecure an award of attorney's fees.<sup> (9)</sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGenerally, the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act is not available to settle\r\ndisputes already pending before the court.  <em>BHP Petroleum Co. v. Millard</em>, 800 S.W.2d 838, 841\r\n(Tex. 1990);  <em>Texas Liquor Control Bd. v. Canyon Creek Land Corp.</em>, 456 S.W.2d 891, 895 (Tex.\r\n1970).  Texas courts apply this rule whether the claim for declaratory relief is asserted in a\r\nseparate proceeding or in the same proceeding.  <em>HECI Exploration Co. v. Clajon Gas Co.</em>, 843\r\nS.W.2d 622, 639 (Tex. App.--Austin 1992, writ denied).  A party may not couple a claim for\r\ndeclaratory relief with a damage action merely to recover attorney's fees.  <em>Hartford Casualty Ins.\r\nCo. v. Budget Rent-A-Car Sys., Inc.</em>, 796 S.W.2d 763, 772 (Tex. App.--Dallas 1990, writ denied);\r\n<em>see also HECI Exploration Co.</em>, 843 S.W.2d at 639 (holding impermissible declaratory judgment\r\ncounterclaim that presented no new controversies but served only as vehicle for recovery of\r\nattorney's fees).   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn order to preserve this complaint for appeal, however, Elaine was obliged to\r\nspecially except or otherwise raise the issue and obtain a ruling before the trial court instructed\r\nthe jury.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. Civ. P. 90; Tex. R. App. P. 52(a); <em>see also</em> <em>HECI Exploration Co.</em>, 843\r\nS.W.2d at 638; <em>Hudspeth v. Hudspeth</em>, 756 S.W.2d 29, 34 (Tex. App.--San Antonio 1988, writ\r\ndenied).<sup> (10)</sup>  Although Elaine objected to Edward's claims for declaratory relief by way of a plea\r\nin abatement and special exceptions, the record does not reflect that she obtained a ruling from\r\nthe trial judge. She has waived the complaint.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tElaine also asserts, in conclusory fashion, that the declaratory judgment action to\r\nset aside the living will and durable power of attorney amounted to a suit for an advisory opinion\r\nbecause the claims involved only a \"hypothetical future dispute based upon the occurrence of a\r\nfuture hypothetical event.\"  Elaine fails to present any argument or cite any authority regarding\r\nthis assertion.  She has thus waived it for appellate review.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. App. P. 74(f); <em>Toungate\r\nv. Bastrop Indep. Sch. Dist.</em>, 842 S.W.2d 823, 828 (Tex. App.--Austin 1992, no writ).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tElaine also contends Edward is not entitled to recover attorney's fees from Elaine\r\nbecause no controversy existed between Edward and Elaine and Edward did not prevail on the\r\ndeclaratory judgment claims.  Elaine argues the jury failed to find that any wrongful act or\r\nomission on her part caused Mrs. Badouh to execute the three documents. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSection 37.009 of the Declaratory Judgments Act provides,  \"In any proceeding\r\nunder this chapter, the court may award costs and reasonable and necessary attorney's fees <em>as are\r\nequitable and just</em>.\"  Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 37.009 (West 1986) (emphasis added). \r\nAn award or denial of attorney's fees in a declaratory judgment action lies within the discretion\r\nof the trial court.  <em>Oake v. Collin County</em>, 692 S.W.2d 454, 455 (Tex. 1985).  We will not reverse\r\nthe trial court's judgment absent a clear showing that the court abused its discretion.  <em>Id.</em>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs noted above, Elaine concedes that Edward asserted Mrs. Badouh's causes of\r\naction as her representative.  It is therefore irrelevant that no controversy existed between Elaine\r\nand Edward, in his <em>individual</em> capacity.  Moreover, the jury found Mrs. Badouh was incompetent\r\nat the time she executed the \"declaration of guardian,\" and the trial court rendered judgment\r\ndeclaring that instrument a nullity.  Although the jury failed to find Elaine acted wrongfully in\r\nobtaining Mrs. Badouh's signature on the \"declaration of guardian,\" Elaine unquestionably\r\nopposed Edward's successful effort to set it aside, and was thus an adverse party.  <em>Cf.\r\nHohenberger v. Schnitzer</em>, 235 S.W.2d 466, 469 (Tex. Civ. App.--San Antonio 1950, writ ref'd\r\nn.r.e.) (appellant was adverse party for purposes of taxing costs because he opposed judgment\r\nfavorable to appellee).  We conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding\r\nEdward judgment against Elaine for attorney's fees.  We overrule Elaine's second point of error.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center><strong>SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn her fourth and sixth points of error, Elaine contends the evidence was legally\r\nor factually insufficient to support the jury's responses to Question No. 10 and Question No. 11. \r\nIn Question No. 10, the jury found Elaine breached a fiduciary duty by taking from Mrs.\r\nBadouh's bank accounts money that Elaine paid to herself, her sons, and third parties.<sup> (11)</sup>  In\r\nQuestion No. 11, the jury determined that Elaine had taken $157,501.50 in breach of her fiduciary\r\nduties.<sup> (12)</sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn reviewing a challenge to the legal sufficiency of the evidence, we must consider\r\nonly the evidence and inferences that tend to support the finding, and disregard all evidence and\r\ninferences to the contrary.  <em>Weirich v. Weirich</em>, 833 S.W.2d 942, 945 (Tex. 1992); <em>Stafford v.\r\nStafford</em>, 726 S.W.2d 14, 16 (Tex. 1987); <em>In re King's Estate</em>, 244 S.W.2d 660, 661 (Tex. 1951). \r\nIf there is any evidence of probative force to support the finding, we must overrule the point and\r\nuphold the finding.  <em>In re King's Estate</em>, 244 S.W.2d at 661.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn reviewing a factual sufficiency point, we must consider and weigh all of the\r\nevidence that supports and that is contrary to the jury's finding.  <em>Sosa v. City of Balch Springs</em>,\r\n772 S.W.2d 71, 72 (Tex. 1989); <em>In re King's Estate</em>, 244 S.W.2d 660, 661 (Tex. 1951).  We may\r\nset aside the verdict only if it is so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to be\r\nclearly wrong and manifestly unjust.  <em>Cain v. Bain</em>, 709 S.W.2d 175, 176 (Tex. 1986) (per\r\ncuriam); <em>In re King's Estate</em>, 244 S.W.2d at 661.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn connection with Question No. 10, the trial court instructed the jury as follows: </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA \"fiduciary\" is any person who occupies a position of special confidence\r\ntowards another.  A fiduciary relationship exists between the person exercising and\r\nthe person granting a power of attorney.  In such case, the person exercising a\r\npower of attorney on behalf of another is a fiduciary who consents as a matter of\r\nlaw to have her conduct toward the other measured by a much higher standard than\r\nwith respect to persons in a merely arms length transaction.  <em>A fiduciary has a duty\r\nto make full disclosure of all material facts known to the fiduciary relating to a\r\ntransaction, and may not profit at the expense of the person owed a fiduciary duty. \r\nA person breaches fiduciary duties if she fails to disclose material relating to the\r\ntransaction or when she enters into an unfair transaction with the person to whom\r\nshe owes a fiduciary duty.  A breach of duty arising from the fiduciary relationship\r\nconstitutes fraud even though it does not involve dishonesty of purpose or intent to\r\ndeceive</em>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>(Emphasis added.)  We will summarize below the evidence relevant to the issue of whether Elaine\r\nbreached a fiduciary duty to Mrs. Badouh in light of the trial court's instructions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center><em>Review of the Evidence</em></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tCarter Casteel, an attorney, testified she had known the Badouh family for twenty\r\nyears and had drawn wills for Mr. and Mrs. Badouh.  After Mr. Badouh died, Elaine instructed\r\nCasteel to prepare a codicil to Mrs. Badouh's will which would not deduct any lifetime gifts to\r\nElaine from her inheritance, but would deduct gifts to Edward's son from Edward's share of the\r\nestate.  Casteel instead prepared the codicil in accord with Mrs. Badouh's different instructions. \r\nWhen Elaine and Mrs. Badouh came to the office for execution of the codicil, Elaine said to her\r\nmother, \"That's not what we talked about.  That's not what you told me you wanted.\"  She also\r\ntestified that Elaine completely controlled her mother and was very demanding and manipulative;\r\nmoreover, Mrs. Badouh had deteriorated physically over the last years, and seemed frail.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEdward testified as follows:  Elaine is very domineering and forceful, she screams\r\nat her mother and browbeats her; Elaine sent her two adult sons $900 per month each and paid\r\ntheir health and car insurance from Mrs. Badouh's funds; Edward's mother signed numerous\r\ndocuments because Elaine wanted her to do so; after Mrs. Badouh executed a power of attorney\r\ngiving Elaine sole authority, Mrs. Badouh's estate was rapidly depleted; Elaine spent some\r\n$300,000 on herself and her sons in the past four years; Mrs. Badouh has no money in the bank;\r\nand less than half the $700,000 deposited in Mrs. Badouh's account was spent on her care.  \tEdward stated further that Elaine paid herself $500 per week from Mrs. Badouh's\r\naccount for taking care of the latter's affairs.  He testified that Elaine made several expenditures\r\nfrom the account for Elaine's own benefit and that of her sons:  $3,300 for a trip to France;\r\n$6,000 for plastic surgery on her son's nose; and $21,000 for a failed business venture begun by\r\nElaine and her son.  Elaine paid all her bills and living expenses from her mother's account. \r\nEdward managed his mother's financial affairs until May 1991.  During that period, Elaine would\r\npick up five or six blank checks at a time and overdraw the account, leaving no money to pay\r\nMrs. Badouh's household staff.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn cross examination, Edward admitted he owes his mother $17,000 and $30,000,\r\nevidenced by his promissory notes.  He admitted he and Elaine dispute whether he or his father's\r\nestate owned certain assets.  He conceded that when he managed Mrs. Badouh's money before\r\nMay 1991, his mother agreed to give Elaine $2,000 to $2,300 per month.  He stated Elaine has\r\npaid $118,000 to attorneys from his mother's account.  When Elaine recently sold some of Mrs.\r\nBadouh's corporate stock for $60,000 in cash, $45,000 was spent within a week.  \tSeveral\r\nof Mrs. Badouh's caretakers testified.  Myrtle Josey stated Elaine frequently yelled at and tried\r\nto \"rule\" Mrs. Badouh, and that Mrs. Badouh was nervous and shaky when Elaine came to visit. \r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tErlinda Dominguez testified that she overheard Elaine telling her mother that she\r\nshould put money in Elaine's name, so if Mrs. Badouh died Elaine would not be left out; Elaine\r\nlater received $110,000 from Mrs. Badouh.  Elaine frequently argued and demanded things from\r\nher mother.  Edward left cash, for Mrs. Badouh's needs, in her wallet.  Elaine got Dominguez\r\nto take the cash from Mrs. Badouh's wallet and deposit it in Elaine's own account.  Elaine would\r\nfill out blank checks she had picked up from Edward, cash the checks, and deposit the cash in her\r\nown account.  Dominguez also testified that Elaine often shouted at her mother and demanded\r\nthings, and that Mrs. Badouh became nervous when Elaine visited.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMarisol Garcia testified she saw Elaine upset only once with her mother--after\r\nEdward had visited.  Elaine cares for her mother, but she also controlled her when she wanted. \r\nOn cross examination, Garcia admitted Edward lent her money because Elaine gave her a\r\npostdated check; she also admitted that he pressured her to testify.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMaria D. Billiot testified she had never seen Elaine dominate Mrs. Badouh, and\r\nshe saw Elaine yell at her mother only once--after Edward visited.  Billiot never saw Mrs. Badouh\r\nunhappy or upset after Elaine's visits.  Elaine told Mrs. Badouh that Edward would \"leave [Mrs.\r\nBadouh] dry\" and put her in a nursing home.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHelen Eversberg, a Badouh-family friend, testified Elaine had told her she was\r\nangry at her parents for not giving her the money she was entitled to, and she vowed to get her\r\nshare no matter how long it took.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJan Johec, a certified public accountant, testified she had reviewed Mrs. Badouh's\r\nbank statements and cancelled checks for the period January 1988 through June 1992.  Johec\r\ntestified to the following figures regarding the relevant period:  (1) Mrs. Badouh's gross receipts\r\nwere $716,622; (2) Mrs. Badouh's living expenses were $355,136; (3) payments to accountants\r\nand attorneys totalled $118,709; and (4) expenditures benefitting Elaine and her sons were\r\n$294,441.  She testified there was a \"deficit\" of $51,664.  If there had been no expenditures for\r\nElaine or attorneys, Mrs Badouh's balance would have been $251,236.  Johec projected Mrs.\r\nBadouh would not have enough money to last through 1994.  Johec categorized checks made out\r\nto \"cash\" (a total of $66,000) as Mrs. Badouh's living expenses, but if Elaine spent that money\r\non herself, it would increase the total amount benefitting Elaine.  None of the household help was\r\npaid $2,000 per month.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn cross examination, Johec admitted she did not know if the money paid to\r\nattorneys and accountants was for Elaine's benefit or Mrs. Badouh's.  She agreed that if Elaine\r\npaid herself a salary for providing nursing care to her mother, the portion designated as amounts\r\nspent for Mrs. Badouh's benefit would be larger.  She stated that her projections do not\r\nnecessarily match up to cash in the bank, and that if Mrs. Badouh lives long enough for certain\r\nloan repayments to come in, she would not be broke after all.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAlicia Bayona, one of Mrs. Badouh's caretakers, testified that Elaine never upsets\r\nMrs. Badouh.  Elaine loves her mother, and she has never seen Elaine lose her temper with her\r\nmother.  Mrs. Badouh is a strong-willed person who is not influenced by anything.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSue Ragusa, Mrs. Badouh's friend, testified that Mrs. Badouh has a strong will,\r\nand that Elaine and Mrs. Badouh get along like any mother and daughter.  She has never seen\r\nElaine pressure her mother or be cross with her.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tChristine Whitehorse testified she was Mrs. Badouh's paid companion, secretary\r\nand \"girl Friday\" for several years.  She said Elaine used blank checks for household purposes,\r\nand she never saw Elaine negotiate any blank checks without Mrs. Badouh's knowledge.  Mrs.\r\nBadouh initiated the expenditure of money on Elaine's sons.  Whitehorse never saw Elaine\r\npressure her mother to do something against her will.  \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhitehorse testified Edward was concerned about the amount of money Mrs.\r\nBadouh allowed Elaine to spend, and told his mother that if it did not stop, Mrs. Badouh would\r\nrun out of money.  Mrs. Badouh replied it was her money, and she could do what she wanted with\r\nit.  Mrs. Badouh wanted to send Elaine to France and give money to Elaine's sons.  Elaine never\r\ntold Mrs. Badouh to slow down on her spending.  It seemed as though Mrs. Badouh's money was\r\nspent half on Mrs. Badouh, and half on Elaine and her sons.  The principal source of income for\r\nElaine's sons has been Mrs. Badouh's money.  In Whitehorse's view, Mrs. Badouh gives Elaine\r\nmoney to control her.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tElaine testified her father wanted to pay for her sons' education, and her mother\r\npaid for her younger son's undergraduate education.  She and her son borrowed $21,000 from her\r\nmother to start a business, and she has repaid that money.  She spent $1,800 on the trip to France. \r\nShe stated she had no authority to sign checks until June 1991, when she and her mother put her\r\nmother's bank account in both their names.  There was a previous power of attorney in 1988\r\nauthorizing both Elaine and Edward to act for Mrs. Badouh.  She testified her older son received\r\n$750 per month when her father was alive, and this was increased to $900 per month.  Mrs.\r\nBadouh paid tuition for all of Elaine's sons, given them $900 per month each, and paid their car\r\nand medical insurance.  In addition, Mrs. Badouh paid $5,700 of Elaine's legal fees, but Elaine\r\nwill pay the rest.  Elaine received $2,350 per month from her mother through 1990, and in 1991\r\nbegan taking $500 per week for handling her mother's affairs and doing some nursing.  Elaine\r\ndisagreed that her mother would be destitute by 1994.  She felt Edward should have kept better\r\ncontrol of the checks when he did the books.  Elaine admitted that if she had known the full\r\nfinancial picture, she would have cut back on spending.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn addition to the testimony summarized above, there was an exhibit listing\r\ninformation about each check written on Mrs. Badouh's bank accounts, including the date,\r\namount, purpose, for whose benefit, and, for one bank account, the person signing the checks.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBased on the foregoing summary of the evidence, we conclude the record contains\r\nlegally and factually sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that Elaine breached her\r\nfiduciary duty to Mrs. Badouh.  \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tElaine argues there is no evidence from which the jury could have computed the\r\nsum of $157,501.50 in response to Question No. 11, because the only evidence on the issue was\r\nJohec's conclusion that Elaine spent $294,441 on herself and her sons.  Contrary to Elaine's\r\nassertion, there was an exhibit listing individually each check written on Mrs. Badouh's account. \r\nThe record reflects that during deliberations the jury requested a calculator.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs a general rule, a reviewing court will not interfere with a jury's determination\r\nof the amount of damages if there is any probative evidence to sustain the award.  <em>David McDavid\r\nPontiac, Inc. v. Nix</em>, 681 S.W.2d 831, 837 (Tex. App.--Dallas 1984, writ ref'd n.r.e.).  There\r\nneed only be some evidence that substantial loss occurred that forms a basis for the jury to\r\nestimate the amount of loss.  <em>See Carrow v. Bayliner Marine Corp.</em>, 781 S.W.2d 691, 695 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Austin 1989, no writ).  Evidence corresponding to the exact amount the jury found is not\r\nessential.  <em>Id.</em>  Although the process by which the jury arrived at the figure of $157,501.50 is\r\nunclear, we conclude the evidence is legally and factually sufficient to support the award.  We\r\noverrule Elaine's fourth and sixth points of error.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center><strong>SUBMISSION OF JURY QUESTIONS</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn her third and fifth points of error, Elaine asserts there was legally or factually\r\ninsufficient evidence to support submitting Question No. 10 and Question No. 11 to the jury. \r\nSpecifically, she complains that the questions incorrectly required the jury to evaluate Elaine's\r\nconduct beginning January 1, 1988.  Elaine contends she owed Mrs. Badouh no fiduciary duty\r\nbefore September 18, 1990, the date Mrs. Badouh executed the durable power of attorney.  She\r\nargues further that undisputed evidence establishes she had no knowledge of her appointment until\r\nten months following the date Mrs. Badouh appointed her.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFirst, we note that Elaine did not object at trial that Question No. 10 and Question\r\nNo. 11 incorrectly instructed the jury concerning the date from which they must evaluate whether\r\nElaine breached a fiduciary duty.  Thus, she has not preserved this complaint for appeal.  <em>See</em>\r\nTex. R. Civ. P. 274; Tex. R. App. P. 52(a).   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMoreover, Elaine herself testified that Mrs. Badouh had appointed both Elaine and\r\nEdward in 1988 under an earlier power of attorney.  Further, Elaine's signature appears on the\r\ndurable power of attorney that Mrs. Badouh executed September 18, 1990, and thus Elaine's\r\nassertion that she did not know of her appointment until ten months later is contrary to the\r\nevidence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe overrule Elaine's third and fifth points of error.</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span><center><strong>ATTORNEY AD LITEM FEES</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn her seventh point of error, Elaine asserts the trial court erred in taxing the\r\nattorney ad litem's<sup> (13)</sup> fees against her.  She argues the award is erroneous because the parties did\r\nnot stipulate to the reasonableness of the fee, the trial court did not submit the issue to the trier\r\nof fact, and there was no evidence that the fees were reasonable.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its final judgment, the trial court awarded the attorney ad litem a total fee of\r\n$17,000, taxing $10,500 against Mrs. Badouh's estate, and the remaining $6,500 against Elaine.<sup> (14)</sup> \r\nFormer section 113A of the Probate Code, in effect at the time of trial, provided: </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIn a proceeding under the provisions of this chapter for the appointment of a\r\nguardian, the judge shall appoint an attorney ad litem to represent the interests of\r\nthe person for whom the permanent guardianship is sought and shall allow the\r\nattorney ad litem a reasonable fee for his services to be taxed as part of the costs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Act of May 23, 1989, 71st Leg., R.S., ch. 1261, § 1, 1989 Tex.

No evidence is required to support an award of\r\nattorney's fees to a guardian ad litem or an attorney ad litem.  <em>Dover Elevator Co.</em>, 812 S.W.2d\r\nat 368; <em>Alford v.

None of the parties requested an evidentiary\r\nhearing on the reasonableness of the award.<sup> (16)</sup>  We conclude Elaine has not shown the trial court\r\nabused its discretion in setting the fee at $6,500.    </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tElaine also asserts the trial court abused its discretion by taxing against her the fees\r\nand expenses of the attorney ad litem.

(appellees, as successful parties, had right to recover\r\ncosts, and thus trial court did not abuse discretion in taxing ad litem fees against appellants).  The\r\ntrial court taxed a much larger portion of the ad litem fees against Mrs. Badouh's estate.  We fail\r\nto see how the trial court abused its discretion in assessing less than half of the attorney ad litem\r\nfees against Elaine.<sup> (17)</sup>  We overrule Elaine's seventh point of error.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center><strong>ADMISSION OF APPLICANT'S EXHIBITS</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn her eighth point of error, Elaine asserts the trial court erred in admitting into\r\nevidence Edward's exhibits numbered thirty through thirty-three.  These exhibits were prepared\r\nby Edward's expert witness Jan Johec, an accountant, and consisted of summaries of Mrs.\r\nBadouh's financial records and Johec's projections and conclusions regarding Mrs. Badouh's\r\npresent and future financial condition.<sup> (18)</sup>  At trial, Elaine objected to the admission of these exhibits\r\non the ground that Edward had not provided them in supplementation to previous discovery\r\nrequests.<sup> (19)</sup>  <em>See</em> Tex. R. Civ. P. 166b(6); 215(5).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA party who fails timely to supplement a response to a discovery request is not\r\nentitled to present the undisclosed evidence unless the trial court finds that good cause exists for\r\nhis failure.  <em>See</em> Tex.

Absence of surprise or unfairness does\r\nnot in itself satisfy the good cause exception.  <em>Sharp v. Broadway Nat'l Bank</em>, 784 S.W.2d 669,\r\n671 (Tex. 1990).  The burden of establishing good cause lies on the party offering the evidence. \r\n<em>Gee v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co.</em>, 765 S.W.2d 394, 395 (Tex. 1989); <em>James</em>, 836 S.W.2d at 241. \r\nThe trial court's determination of good cause is subject to review only for abuse of discretion. \r\n<em>Morrow v.

Johec confirmed to the\r\ncourt that she provided the report to counsel about that time.  Apparently, Elaine's deposition was\r\nrescheduled at her request for July 22nd, nineteen days before trial, at which time Edward's\r\ncounsel was able to question her about the underlying documentation for Johec's report.  Based\r\non the record, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting Johec's reports. \r\n<em>See First Interstate Bank v. Bland</em>, 810 S.W.2d 277, 288 (Tex. App.--Fort Worth 1991, no writ)\r\n(holding trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding good cause to admit photographs that\r\nhad not been taken and developed until trial). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMoreover, we note the information contained in Johec's reports and charts was\r\nessentially cumulative of other testimony and exhibits properly admitted.  Specifically, we refer\r\nto Johec's testimony, summarized above, and to Edward's Exhibit 29, which listed each check\r\nwritten on Mrs. Badouh's bank accounts, including the amount, purpose, and for whom the money\r\nwas spent, as well as listing deposits.  Thus, even if the trial court erroneously admitted the\r\nexhibits, the error was harmless.  <em>See Rainbo Baking Co. v. Stafford</em>, 787 S.W.2d 41, 42 (Tex.\r\n1990) (holding that because improperly admitted testimony was cumulative it did not cause\r\nrendition of improper judgment); <em>Gee</em>, 765 S.W.2d at 396 (stating erroneous admission of\r\nevidence cumulative of properly admitted evidence is harmless error); <em>Blonstein v.

We overrule Elaine's eighth point of error.    </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center><strong>SETTLEMENT OF THE BEXAR COUNTY LAWSUIT</strong><sup> (20)</sup></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter the trial court rendered judgment appointing Kimbel Brown guardian of Mrs.\r\nBadouh's estate, Brown filed an application for settlement of claims and sale of personal property\r\nin Comal County Court.  <em>See</em> Tex. Prob. Code Ann. §§ 342, 234.  Brown requested the court's\r\npermission to:  (1) settle a lawsuit pending in Bexar County in which Elaine and Mrs. Badouh\r\nwere the plaintiffs and Edward was the defendant; and (2) sell certain items of Mrs. Badouh's\r\npersonal property.  Elaine filed a response opposing both the settlement and the sale.  After a\r\nhearing, the court issued its order approving the settlement of the lawsuit and the sale of personal\r\nproperty.  Elaine appeals.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn a single point of error, Elaine asserts the guardian's application to settle the\r\nlawsuit was defective and the trial court therefore erred in approving it.<sup> (21)</sup>  She argues that the\r\napplication was within the scope of section 334 of the Probate Code<sup> (22)</sup> governing the sale of\r\npersonal property, and was therefore deficient in the following respects:  (1) the application was\r\nnot accompanied by a proper exhibit showing the condition of the estate; and (2) the guardian\r\nfailed to post citation.  <em>See</em> Tex. Prob. Code Ann. §§ 342, 344 (West 1980).<sup> (23)</sup>\r\n<p><span>  Brown rejoins that\r\na guardian's application to settle a lawsuit is governed by section 234 of the Probate Code, which\r\nprovides in part:<sup> (24)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tWhen a personal representative deems it for the interest of the estate, he may,\r\nupon written application to the court, and by order granting authority:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t. . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t(4) Make compromises or settlements in relation to property or claims in\r\ndispute or litigation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Tex. Prob. Code Ann. § 234(a)(4) (West 1980).  Brown therefore argues he was not required to\r\ncomply with the requirements in sections 342 and 344 for the sale of personal property.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tElaine contends that settlement of a lawsuit is a sale of personal property because\r\nsection 3(z) of the Probate Code provides:  \"`Personal property' includes interests in . . . choses\r\nin action . . . .\"  Tex. Prob. Code Ann. § 3(z) (West Supp. 1994).  Thus, she argues that\r\nsettlement of a lawsuit is the sale of a chose in action.    </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe do not agree with Elaine's contention.  A chose in action is a right to bring an\r\naction or a right to recover a debt or money.   When a person sells a chose in action, he sells title\r\nto the right, which continues to exist.  When parties settle a lawsuit, they release their claims and\r\nno one may assert them; they are extinguished.  Thus, section 334 is found in chapter eight, part\r\nfive, of the Probate Code, entitled \"Sales,\" whereas section 234 is located in part five of chapter\r\nseven, entitled \"General Powers of Personal Representatives.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause we conclude that settlement of a lawsuit is not the sale of personal\r\nproperty, Brown was not required to comply with provisions of the Probate Code pertaining to\r\nthe sale of personal property in his application to settle the lawsuit.  <em>See San Antonio Sav.

Act of Mar. 17, 1955, 54th Leg., R.S., ch. 55, § 113, 1955\r\nTex. Gen. Laws 123 (Tex. Prob. Code Ann. § 113, since repealed)\r\n(\"section 113\").  \r\n</p><p>2.       The version of section 11 of the Probate Code in effect at\r\nthe time of trial stated in part:  \"A proceeding for the\r\nappointment of a guardian shall be begun by written application\r\nfiled in the court of the county having venue thereof.  Any person\r\nmay make such application.\"\r\n</p><p>3.       Additionally, the trial court declared the durable power of\r\nattorney null and void and of no further force and effect as of the\r\ndate letters of guardianship were issued to Kimbel L. Brown. \r\n</p><p>4.       The guardian of Mrs. Badouh's estate, Kimbel Brown, is also\r\nan appellee.  He filed a brief that is almost identical to Edward's\r\nbrief.  \r\n</p><p>5.       In her brief, Elaine states:  \"From these pleadings, it is\r\nclear that Edward does not bring any of his causes of action . . .\r\nin his own behalf, but rather, brings these causes of action on\r\nbehalf of Mrs. Badouh, who prior to the date of judgment is\r\npresumed to be competent to manage her own affairs. . . .  At no\r\ntime during the proceedings has Edward asserted that these actions\r\nare brought in his own capacity . . . .\"\r\n</p><p>6.       Elaine argues that this case is similar to <em>Cozad v. Roman</em>,\r\n570 S.W.2d 558 (Tex. Civ. App.--Corpus Christi 1978, no writ).  In\r\n<em>Cozad</em>, the court held that the appellant had no standing because\r\nshe had no personal interest at stake, and yet expressly asserted\r\nthat she brought suit in her <em>individual</em> capacity, and not as a\r\nrepresentative for her mother.  <em>Id.</em> at 561.  In the present case,\r\nthe parties do not dispute that Edward brought the suit in a\r\nrepresentative capacity.\r\n</p><p>7.       A party may challenge lack of capacity to sue by special\r\nexception if such defect appears on the face of the petition.  2\r\n<em>Texas Civil Practice</em>, <em>supra</em> § 9:13, at 313.\r\n</p><p>8.       The record contains an order setting the plea in abatement\r\nfor hearing on July 10, 1992, but contains no written order or\r\nstatement of facts indicating that the trial court actually held\r\nthe hearing and ruled on the plea.  Elaine also filed special\r\nexceptions raising the issue of standing, but once again, although\r\nthe trial court set a hearing date, there is no indication that the\r\ntrial court ruled on the special exceptions.\r\n</p><p>9.       A party may not recover attorney's fees absent statutory\r\nauthorization or an agreement between the parties.  <em>Dallas Cent.\r\nAppraisal Dist. v. Seven Inv. Co.</em>, 835 S.W.2d 75, 77 (Tex. 1992). \r\nEdward was entitled to recover attorney's fees solely for the cause\r\nof action under section 37.009 of the Declaratory Judgments Act. \r\nGenerally, when a party seeks to recover attorney's fees in a case\r\ninvolving multiple causes of action, the party is required to\r\nsegregate among the various causes its request for fees.  <em>Great Am.\r\nIns. Co. v. North Austin Mun. Util. Dist. No. 1</em>, 850 S.W.2d 285,\r\n290 (Tex. App.--Austin 1993, writ requested).  Elaine does not\r\ncomplain on appeal, nor did she object in the trial court, that\r\nEdward failed to segregate his claim for attorney's fees between\r\nthe various causes of action.  <em>See Aero Energy, Inc. v. Circle C\r\nDrilling Co.</em>, 699 S.W.2d 821, 823 (Tex. 1985); <em>Murrco Agency, Inc.\r\nv. Ryan</em>, 800 S.W.2d 600, 606 (Tex. App.--Dallas 1990, no writ).    \r\n   \r\n</p><p>10.       In a non-jury case, the party must raise the issue before\r\nthe trial court signs the judgment.  Tex. R. Civ. P. 90.\r\n</p><p>11.       Question No. 10 asked:  \"Do you find from a preponderance\r\nof the evidence that Elaine Badouh Hale after January 1, 1988\r\nbreached a fiduciary duty to Mrs. Rubylien Barber Badouh by taking\r\nfor herself, her sons and third parties money from Mrs. Rubylien\r\nBarber Badouh's bank accounts?\"\r\n</p><p>12.       Question No. 11 asked:  \"What amount of money, if any, do\r\nyou find that Elaine Badouh Hale, after January 1, 1988 took for\r\nherself, her sons and third parties in violation of fiduciary\r\nduties owed to Mrs. Rubylien Barber Badouh?\"\r\n</p><p>13.       The order appointing Kimbel Brown is entitled, \"Order\r\nAppointing Attorney Ad Litem,\" although the text of the order\r\nstates that Kimbel Brown is appointed as <em>guardian</em> ad litem.  An\r\n<em>attorney</em> ad litem is an attorney appointed by the court to\r\nrepresent and advocate on behalf of a proposed ward, while a\r\n<em>guardian</em> ad litem is a person appointed by the court to represent\r\nthe best interests of a person in a guardianship proceeding.  Tex.\r\nProb. Code Ann. § 601(1), (9) (West Supp. 1994); <em>see also </em><em>Dawson v.\r\nGarcia</em>, 666 S.W.2d 254, 265 (Tex. App.--Dallas 1989, no writ)\r\n(noting guardian ad litem is not an attorney for represented\r\nperson).  None of the parties assign the confusion of terms in the\r\ntrial-court order as error, and in any event, an improper\r\ndesignation by the trial court is not fatal.  <em>See Phillips\r\nPetroleum Co. v. Welch</em>, 702 S.W.2d 672, 674 (Tex. App.--Houston\r\n[14th Dist.] 1985, writ ref'd n.r.e.); <em>Sheehan v. Southern Pac.\r\nCo.</em>, 422 S.W.2d 948, 949 (Tex. Civ. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1967,\r\nwrit ref'd n.r.e.).  Moreover, in connection with assessment and\r\ntaxing of ad litem fees, the rules are the same whether the\r\nrepresentative is a guardian ad litem or attorney ad litem.  <em>See,\r\ne.g.</em>, <em>Dover Elevator Co. v. Servellon</em>, 812 S.W.2d 366, 368 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Dallas 1991, no writ) (finding trial court's decision\r\nregarding reasonable compensation for guardian ad litem within its\r\ndiscretion); <em>Lofton v. Norman</em>, 508 S.W.2d 915, 922 (Tex. Civ.\r\nApp.--Corpus Christi 1974, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (finding award of\r\nattorney ad litem fee within sound discretion of trial court).    \r\n \r\n</p><p>14.       The attorney ad litem filed two motions requesting an award\r\nof attorney's fees.  The trial court granted the first motion in\r\nJune 1992, awarding $6,500, and the second motion in October 1992,\r\nawarding $10,500.  In its final judgment, the trial court taxed the\r\nattorney ad litem's fee through June 9th against Elaine, and the\r\namounts awarded for work after June 9th against Mrs. Badouh's\r\nestate.\r\n</p><p>15.       At least one court does not agree that no evidence is\r\nrequired to support an award of ad litem fees.  <em>See </em><em>Brown &amp; Root\r\nU.S.A., Inc. v. Trevino</em>, 802 S.W.2d 13, 14 (Tex. App.--El Paso 1990,\r\nnor writ) (stating attorney ad litem fee is question of fact to be\r\ndetermined by the trier of facts and competent evidence must\r\nsupport award).  Moreover, in <em>Alford</em>, the court noted that no\r\nevidence is required to support an ad litem fee award, but because\r\nthe parties did present evidence, the court reviewed the evidence\r\nand held the trial court had abused its discretion and reduced the\r\naward to the ad litem.  <em>Alford</em>, 794 S.W.2d at 925-26.\r\n</p><p>16.       A hearing on a motion for new trial is an appropriate forum\r\nto develop evidence regarding the reasonableness of the attorney ad\r\nlitem fee.  <em>See Simon</em>, 739 S.W.2d at 794; <em>Navistar</em>, 740 S.W.2d at\r\n6.  Although Elaine asserted that the evidence was legally and\r\nfactually insufficient to support the amount of the award in her\r\namended motion for new trial, she did not request a hearing on the\r\nmotion.</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span> \r\n<p>17.       Elaine also argues that the trial court did not state good\r\ncause for apportioning the ad litem fees against her.  The trial\r\ncourt may adjudge costs other than in accordance with rule 131 for\r\ngood cause stated on the record.  Tex. R. Civ. P. 141.  It is error\r\nfor the trial court to tax costs other than in accordance with rule\r\n131 unless it states its reasons on the record.  <em>Neal v. Ardoin</em>,\r\n594 S.W.2d 145, 147 (Tex. Civ. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1980, no\r\nwrit).  However, because Elaine was not a successful party, the\r\ntrial court did not act outside the dictates of rule 131. \r\n</p><p>18.       Exhibit 30 is a six-page historical recapitulation of Mrs.\r\nBadouh's financial activity by year, based on her financial\r\nrecords.  Johec calculated the figures for 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991,\r\nand the first six months of 1992 for the following categories:  (1)\r\nMrs. Badouh's gross receipts; (2) Mrs. Badouh's living expenses;\r\n(3) cash for expenses; (4) fees for attorneys and accountants; (5)\r\nexpenditures for Elaine and her children; and (6) Mrs. Badouh's\r\noverhead expenses.  Additionally, Johec calculated Mrs. Badouh's\r\nhistorical cash flow by year in certain categories, such as living\r\nexpenses.  There is a projected income assumption.  Johec also\r\ncalculated Mrs. Badouh's personal expenses and her actual cash\r\navailable, and provided a summary of her conclusions concerning how\r\nmuch was spent for the entire time period in various categories. \r\nExhibits 31 through 33 are large charts or diagrams of information\r\ncontained in Exhibit 30.\r\n</p><p>19.       We do not find the request for production in the record;\r\nhowever, Edward does not dispute that Elaine requested production\r\nof the documents and that he did not produce them until August 6,\r\n1992.  Trial began on August 10th.  The supplementation deadline\r\nwas 30 days before trial.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. Civ. P. 166b(6).\r\n</p><p>20.       This is an appeal from a companion case involving Elaine\r\nBadouh Hale and Kimbel Brown, whom the trial court appointed as the\r\nguardian of Mrs. Badouh's estate.  \r\n</p><p>21.       Elaine does not appeal the portion of the order approving\r\nthe sale of Mrs. Badouh's personal property.  After the court\r\nissued its order, Brown filed a report of sale, to which Elaine\r\nagain objected for the failure to post notice in accordance in\r\nsection 344 of the Probate Code.  In response, Brown filed an\r\namended supplemental application for sale of personal property, and\r\nthe clerk posted notice for ten days in accordance with section\r\n344.  Elaine filed no objections or response.  \r\n</p><p>22.       Section 334 provides:  </p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tUpon application by the personal\r\nrepresentative of the estate or by any interested\r\nperson, the court may order the sale of any\r\npersonal property of the estate . . . if the court\r\nfinds that so to do would be in the best interest\r\nof the estate . . . .  In so far as possible,\r\napplications and orders for the sale of personal\r\nproperty shall conform to the requirements\r\nhereinafter set forth for applications and orders\r\nfor the sale of real estate.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Tex. Prob. Code Ann. § 334 (West 1980). \r\n<p>23.       Although sections 342 and 344 of the Probate Code pertain\r\nto applications for the sale of real estate, applications and\r\norders for the sale of personal property shall conform to the\r\nrequirements set forth for the sale of real estate.  Tex. Prob.\r\nCode Ann. § 334 (West 1980). </p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>24.       The trial court found that the application for approval of\r\nthe sale of personal property was separate and distinct from the\r\ncourt's approval to settle the lawsuit.</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",

Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. §§ 37.001-.011 (West 1986 &amp; Supp. 1994).  We will\r\naffirm the trial-court judgment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn appeal number 3-93-439-CV, Elaine Badouh Hale appeals a trial-court order\r\nauthorizing the guardian of Mrs. Badouh's estate to settle a lawsuit pending in Bexar County.  We\r\nwill affirm the trial-court order. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span> <center><strong>THE CONTROVERSY</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tRubylien Barber Badouh has severe end-stage Parkinson's Disease and requires\r\ncontinuous home-nursing care.  Edward Badouh, Jr. (\"Edward\") and Elaine Badouh Hale\r\n(\"Elaine\") are Mrs. Badouh's children.  For some years, Elaine managed Mrs. Badouh's estate\r\nunder a durable power of attorney.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn January 1992, Edward applied to the court below for the appointment of a\r\nperson, named in the application, as guardian of Mrs. Badouh's estate, averring that she was\r\nincompetent and unable to manage her estate.  <em>See</em> Act of May 23, 1987, 70th Leg., R.S., ch.\r\n463, § 3, 1987 Tex. Gen. Laws 2050 (Tex. Probate Code Ann. § 111, since amended).<sup> (2)</sup>  The\r\ncourt appointed Kimbel Brown to serve in that proceeding as Mrs. Badouh's attorney ad litem. \r\n<em>See </em>Act of May 23, 1989, 71st Leg., R.S., ch. 1261, § 1, 1989 Tex. Gen. Laws 5082 (Tex. Prob.\r\nCode Ann. § 113A, since repealed) (\"section 113A\").  Elaine also appeared in the cause.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tElaine and Mrs. Badouh opposed Edward's application on the ground that it was\r\nunnecessary because Mrs. Badouh's estate was already sufficiently protected because she had\r\nexecuted a \"declaration of guardian\" in the event of later incompetence.  This document, signed\r\nby Mrs. Badouh after Edward filed the application, appointed John Thomas Ragusa guardian of\r\nMrs. Badouh's estate should she become incompetent.   Edward filed a contest to the \"declaration\r\nof guardian,\" alleging Elaine had procured Mrs. Badouh's execution of the document through\r\nfraud and duress.  Additionally, Edward sued for a declaratory judgment setting aside the\r\ndeclaration of guardian, the durable power of attorney under which Elaine had acted for several\r\nyears, and a \"living will\" that Mrs. Badouh had executed earlier.  He also requested an accounting\r\nregarding transactions Elaine had made under the power of attorney, including payments to herself\r\nand her family, and judgment for any sums found owing by Elaine.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter trial, the jury found:  (1) Mrs. Badouh was currently of unsound mind, and\r\nwas of unsound mind when she executed the \"declaration of guardian\" and (2) Elaine breached \r\nfiduciary duties owed Mrs. Badouh under the power of attorney by taking funds for herself and\r\nthird parties from Mrs. Badouh's bank accounts.  The jury fixed at $157,501.50 the amount taken\r\nin violation of Elaine's fiduciary duties.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe jury failed to find:  (1) Mrs. Badouh was of unsound mind when she executed\r\nthe durable power of attorney or the living will; or (2) that Elaine unduly influenced or exerted\r\nduress on Mrs. Badouh to obtain her signature on any of the three documents.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial court rendered judgment against Elaine on the jury's verdict and appointed\r\nKimbel Brown guardian of Mrs. Badouh's estate.<sup> (3)</sup>  Elaine appeals the portion of the judgment\r\nrendered against her.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong><center>STANDING OR CAPACITY TO SUE</center></strong>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn her first point of error, Elaine asserts that Edward did not have standing to\r\nmaintain claims against her.  Edward responds<sup> (4)</sup> that he sued only in a representative capacity on\r\nMrs. Badouh's behalf.  He argues, therefore, that the issue is his <em>capacity</em> to sue as Mrs. Badouh's\r\nrepresentative, not his standing as an individual.  We agree.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\"Standing\" and \"capacity\" are distinct concepts.  <em>See Develo-cepts, Inc. v. City of\r\nGalveston</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2389065\"><a href=\"/opinion/2389065/develo-cepts-inc-v-city-of-galveston/\"><span class=\"volume\">668</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">790</span></a></span>, 793 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1984, no writ).  The doctrine\r\nof \"standing\" inquires whether a cause of action belongs to the party who asserts it.  <em>See Hunt v.\r\nBass</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2446685\"><a href=\"/opinion/2446685/hunt-v-bass/\"><span class=\"volume\">664</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></a></span>, 324 (Tex. 1984); <em>Williams v.

If the person to whom the cause of action belongs is\r\nincompetent, another person may maintain the action, in a representative capacity, on the\r\nincompetent person's behalf.     </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen a person sues as a representative for an incompetent person, the incompetent\r\nperson is the real party plaintiff.  <em>Henderson v. Shell Oil Co.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3944342\"><a href=\"/opinion/4176397/henderson-v-shell-oil-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">182</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">994</span></a></span>, 995 (Tex. 1944);\r\n<em>McGinnis v.

Civ. App.--San Antonio 1954, no writ). \r\nTherefore, <em>Mrs. Badouh</em> is the person who must have standing to bring the claims pressed in her\r\nname by Edward.  The issue with regard to Edward is whether he may lawfully act as Mrs.\r\nBadouh's representative.  We will therefore address Elaine's point of error as a complaint\r\nregarding Edward's capacity to sue as Mrs. Badouh's representative.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEdward asserts he was entitled to sue on Mrs. Badouh's behalf under former\r\nsection 113 of the Probate Code.  That statute provides as follows: </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAny person has the right to appear and contest the appointment of a particular\r\nperson as guardian, or to contest any proceeding which he deems to be injurious\r\nto the ward, or to commence any proceeding which he deems beneficial to the\r\nward.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Edward contends he was also entitled to act as Mrs. Badouh's \"next friend\" under Texas Rule of\r\nCivil Procedure 44, which provides in part:  \"[P]ersons non compos mentis who have no legal\r\nguardian may sue and be represented by `next friend'\"  Elaine acknowledges Edward sued on\r\nMrs. Badouh's behalf.<sup> (5)</sup>  She complains, however, that he did not expressly assert his\r\nrepresentative capacity in his pleadings.<sup> (6)</sup>  \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA party suing in representative capacity should expressly allege his right to sue on\r\nbehalf of the person he represents.  <em>See, e.g.</em>, <em>McGinnis</em>, 267 S.W.2d at 435; 2 <em>Texas Civil\r\nPractice</em> § 8.8, at 189 (Diane M.

She has thus waived it for appellate review.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. App. P. 74(f); <em>Toungate\r\nv. Bastrop Indep. Sch.

Elaine argues the jury failed to find that any wrongful act or\r\nomission on her part caused Mrs. Badouh to execute the three documents. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSection 37.009 of the Declaratory Judgments Act provides,  \"In any proceeding\r\nunder this chapter, the court may award costs and reasonable and necessary attorney's fees <em>as are\r\nequitable and just</em>.\"  Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.

We will not reverse\r\nthe trial court's judgment absent a clear showing that the court abused its discretion.  <em>Id.</em>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs noted above, Elaine concedes that Edward asserted Mrs. Badouh's causes of\r\naction as her representative.  It is therefore irrelevant that no controversy existed between Elaine\r\nand Edward, in his <em>individual</em> capacity.  Moreover, the jury found Mrs. Badouh was incompetent\r\nat the time she executed the \"declaration of guardian,\" and the trial court rendered judgment\r\ndeclaring that instrument a nullity.  Although the jury failed to find Elaine acted wrongfully in\r\nobtaining Mrs. Badouh's signature on the \"declaration of guardian,\" Elaine unquestionably\r\nopposed Edward's successful effort to set it aside, and was thus an adverse party.  <em>Cf.\r\nHohenberger v.

We will summarize below the evidence relevant to the issue of whether Elaine\r\nbreached a fiduciary duty to Mrs. Badouh in light of the trial court's instructions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center><em>Review of the Evidence</em></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tCarter Casteel, an attorney, testified she had known the Badouh family for twenty\r\nyears and had drawn wills for Mr. and Mrs. Badouh.  After Mr. Badouh died, Elaine instructed\r\nCasteel to prepare a codicil to Mrs. Badouh's will which would not deduct any lifetime gifts to\r\nElaine from her inheritance, but would deduct gifts to Edward's son from Edward's share of the\r\nestate.  Casteel instead prepared the codicil in accord with Mrs. Badouh's different instructions. \r\nWhen Elaine and Mrs. Badouh came to the office for execution of the codicil, Elaine said to her\r\nmother, \"That's not what we talked about.  That's not what you told me you wanted.\"  She also\r\ntestified that Elaine completely controlled her mother and was very demanding and manipulative;\r\nmoreover, Mrs. Badouh had deteriorated physically over the last years, and seemed frail.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEdward testified as follows:  Elaine is very domineering and forceful, she screams\r\nat her mother and browbeats her; Elaine sent her two adult sons $900 per month each and paid\r\ntheir health and car insurance from Mrs. Badouh's funds; Edward's mother signed numerous\r\ndocuments because Elaine wanted her to do so; after Mrs. Badouh executed a power of attorney\r\ngiving Elaine sole authority, Mrs. Badouh's estate was rapidly depleted; Elaine spent some\r\n$300,000 on herself and her sons in the past four years; Mrs. Badouh has no money in the bank;\r\nand less than half the $700,000 deposited in Mrs. Badouh's account was spent on her care.  \tEdward stated further that Elaine paid herself $500 per week from Mrs. Badouh's\r\naccount for taking care of the latter's affairs.  He testified that Elaine made several expenditures\r\nfrom the account for Elaine's own benefit and that of her sons:  $3,300 for a trip to France;\r\n$6,000 for plastic surgery on her son's nose; and $21,000 for a failed business venture begun by\r\nElaine and her son.  Elaine paid all her bills and living expenses from her mother's account. \r\nEdward managed his mother's financial affairs until May 1991.  During that period, Elaine would\r\npick up five or six blank checks at a time and overdraw the account, leaving no money to pay\r\nMrs. Badouh's household staff.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn cross examination, Edward admitted he owes his mother $17,000 and $30,000,\r\nevidenced by his promissory notes.  He admitted he and Elaine dispute whether he or his father's\r\nestate owned certain assets.  He conceded that when he managed Mrs. Badouh's money before\r\nMay 1991, his mother agreed to give Elaine $2,000 to $2,300 per month.  He stated Elaine has\r\npaid $118,000 to attorneys from his mother's account.  When Elaine recently sold some of Mrs.\r\nBadouh's corporate stock for $60,000 in cash, $45,000 was spent within a week.  \tSeveral\r\nof Mrs. Badouh's caretakers testified.  Myrtle Josey stated Elaine frequently yelled at and tried\r\nto \"rule\" Mrs. Badouh, and that Mrs. Badouh was nervous and shaky when Elaine came to visit. \r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tErlinda Dominguez testified that she overheard Elaine telling her mother that she\r\nshould put money in Elaine's name, so if Mrs. Badouh died Elaine would not be left out; Elaine\r\nlater received $110,000 from Mrs. Badouh.  Elaine frequently argued and demanded things from\r\nher mother.  Edward left cash, for Mrs. Badouh's needs, in her wallet.  Elaine got Dominguez\r\nto take the cash from Mrs. Badouh's wallet and deposit it in Elaine's own account.  Elaine would\r\nfill out blank checks she had picked up from Edward, cash the checks, and deposit the cash in her\r\nown account.  Dominguez also testified that Elaine often shouted at her mother and demanded\r\nthings, and that Mrs. Badouh became nervous when Elaine visited.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMarisol Garcia testified she saw Elaine upset only once with her mother--after\r\nEdward had visited.  Elaine cares for her mother, but she also controlled her when she wanted. \r\nOn cross examination, Garcia admitted Edward lent her money because Elaine gave her a\r\npostdated check; she also admitted that he pressured her to testify.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMaria D. Billiot testified she had never seen Elaine dominate Mrs. Badouh, and\r\nshe saw Elaine yell at her mother only once--after Edward visited.  Billiot never saw Mrs. Badouh\r\nunhappy or upset after Elaine's visits.  Elaine told Mrs. Badouh that Edward would \"leave [Mrs.\r\nBadouh] dry\" and put her in a nursing home.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHelen Eversberg, a Badouh-family friend, testified Elaine had told her she was\r\nangry at her parents for not giving her the money she was entitled to, and she vowed to get her\r\nshare no matter how long it took.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJan Johec, a certified public accountant, testified she had reviewed Mrs. Badouh's\r\nbank statements and cancelled checks for the period January 1988 through June 1992.  Johec\r\ntestified to the following figures regarding the relevant period:  (1) Mrs. Badouh's gross receipts\r\nwere $716,622; (2) Mrs. Badouh's living expenses were $355,136; (3) payments to accountants\r\nand attorneys totalled $118,709; and (4) expenditures benefitting Elaine and her sons were\r\n$294,441.  She testified there was a \"deficit\" of $51,664.  If there had been no expenditures for\r\nElaine or attorneys, Mrs Badouh's balance would have been $251,236.  Johec projected Mrs.\r\nBadouh would not have enough money to last through 1994.  Johec categorized checks made out\r\nto \"cash\" (a total of $66,000) as Mrs. Badouh's living expenses, but if Elaine spent that money\r\non herself, it would increase the total amount benefitting Elaine.  None of the household help was\r\npaid $2,000 per month.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn cross examination, Johec admitted she did not know if the money paid to\r\nattorneys and accountants was for Elaine's benefit or Mrs. Badouh's.  She agreed that if Elaine\r\npaid herself a salary for providing nursing care to her mother, the portion designated as amounts\r\nspent for Mrs. Badouh's benefit would be larger.  She stated that her projections do not\r\nnecessarily match up to cash in the bank, and that if Mrs. Badouh lives long enough for certain\r\nloan repayments to come in, she would not be broke after all.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAlicia Bayona, one of Mrs. Badouh's caretakers, testified that Elaine never upsets\r\nMrs. Badouh.  Elaine loves her mother, and she has never seen Elaine lose her temper with her\r\nmother.  Mrs. Badouh is a strong-willed person who is not influenced by anything.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSue Ragusa, Mrs. Badouh's friend, testified that Mrs. Badouh has a strong will,\r\nand that Elaine and Mrs. Badouh get along like any mother and daughter.  She has never seen\r\nElaine pressure her mother or be cross with her.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tChristine Whitehorse testified she was Mrs. Badouh's paid companion, secretary\r\nand \"girl Friday\" for several years.  She said Elaine used blank checks for household purposes,\r\nand she never saw Elaine negotiate any blank checks without Mrs. Badouh's knowledge.  Mrs.\r\nBadouh initiated the expenditure of money on Elaine's sons.  Whitehorse never saw Elaine\r\npressure her mother to do something against her will.  \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhitehorse testified Edward was concerned about the amount of money Mrs.\r\nBadouh allowed Elaine to spend, and told his mother that if it did not stop, Mrs. Badouh would\r\nrun out of money.  Mrs. Badouh replied it was her money, and she could do what she wanted with\r\nit.  Mrs. Badouh wanted to send Elaine to France and give money to Elaine's sons.  Elaine never\r\ntold Mrs. Badouh to slow down on her spending.  It seemed as though Mrs. Badouh's money was\r\nspent half on Mrs. Badouh, and half on Elaine and her sons.  The principal source of income for\r\nElaine's sons has been Mrs. Badouh's money.  In Whitehorse's view, Mrs. Badouh gives Elaine\r\nmoney to control her.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tElaine testified her father wanted to pay for her sons' education, and her mother\r\npaid for her younger son's undergraduate education.  She and her son borrowed $21,000 from her\r\nmother to start a business, and she has repaid that money.  She spent $1,800 on the trip to France. \r\nShe stated she had no authority to sign checks until June 1991, when she and her mother put her\r\nmother's bank account in both their names.  There was a previous power of attorney in 1988\r\nauthorizing both Elaine and Edward to act for Mrs. Badouh.  She testified her older son received\r\n$750 per month when her father was alive, and this was increased to $900 per month.  Mrs.\r\nBadouh paid tuition for all of Elaine's sons, given them $900 per month each, and paid their car\r\nand medical insurance.  In addition, Mrs. Badouh paid $5,700 of Elaine's legal fees, but Elaine\r\nwill pay the rest.  Elaine received $2,350 per month from her mother through 1990, and in 1991\r\nbegan taking $500 per week for handling her mother's affairs and doing some nursing.  Elaine\r\ndisagreed that her mother would be destitute by 1994.  She felt Edward should have kept better\r\ncontrol of the checks when he did the books.  Elaine admitted that if she had known the full\r\nfinancial picture, she would have cut back on spending.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn addition to the testimony summarized above, there was an exhibit listing\r\ninformation about each check written on Mrs. Badouh's bank accounts, including the date,\r\namount, purpose, for whose benefit, and, for one bank account, the person signing the checks.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBased on the foregoing summary of the evidence, we conclude the record contains\r\nlegally and factually sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that Elaine breached her\r\nfiduciary duty to Mrs. Badouh.  \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tElaine argues there is no evidence from which the jury could have computed the\r\nsum of $157,501.50 in response to Question No. 11, because the only evidence on the issue was\r\nJohec's conclusion that Elaine spent $294,441 on herself and her sons.  Contrary to Elaine's\r\nassertion, there was an exhibit listing individually each check written on Mrs. Badouh's account. \r\nThe record reflects that during deliberations the jury requested a calculator.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs a general rule, a reviewing court will not interfere with a jury's determination\r\nof the amount of damages if there is any probative evidence to sustain the award.  <em>David McDavid\r\nPontiac, Inc. v.

Elaine contends she owed Mrs. Badouh no fiduciary duty\r\nbefore September 18, 1990, the date Mrs. Badouh executed the durable power of attorney.  She\r\nargues further that undisputed evidence establishes she had no knowledge of her appointment until\r\nten months following the date Mrs. Badouh appointed her.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFirst, we note that Elaine did not object at trial that Question No. 10 and Question\r\nNo. 11 incorrectly instructed the jury concerning the date from which they must evaluate whether\r\nElaine breached a fiduciary duty.  Thus, she has not preserved this complaint for appeal.  <em>See</em>\r\nTex. R. Civ. P. 274; Tex. R. App. P. 52(a).   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMoreover, Elaine herself testified that Mrs. Badouh had appointed both Elaine and\r\nEdward in 1988 under an earlier power of attorney.  Further, Elaine's signature appears on the\r\ndurable power of attorney that Mrs. Badouh executed September 18, 1990, and thus Elaine's\r\nassertion that she did not know of her appointment until ten months later is contrary to the\r\nevidence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe overrule Elaine's third and fifth points of error.</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span><center><strong>ATTORNEY AD LITEM FEES</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn her seventh point of error, Elaine asserts the trial court erred in taxing the\r\nattorney ad litem's<sup> (13)</sup> fees against her.

Prob. Code Ann. §§ 342, 234.  Brown requested the court's\r\npermission to:  (1) settle a lawsuit pending in Bexar County in which Elaine and Mrs. Badouh\r\nwere the plaintiffs and Edward was the defendant; and (2) sell certain items of Mrs. Badouh's\r\npersonal property.  Elaine filed a response opposing both the settlement and the sale.  After a\r\nhearing, the court issued its order approving the settlement of the lawsuit and the sale of personal\r\nproperty.  Elaine appeals.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn a single point of error, Elaine asserts the guardian's application to settle the\r\nlawsuit was defective and the trial court therefore erred in approving it.<sup> (21)</sup>  She argues that the\r\napplication was within the scope of section 334 of the Probate Code<sup> (22)</sup> governing the sale of\r\npersonal property, and was therefore deficient in the following respects:  (1) the application was\r\nnot accompanied by a proper exhibit showing the condition of the estate; and (2) the guardian\r\nfailed to post citation.  <em>See</em> Tex. Prob. Code Ann. §§ 342, 344 (West 1980).<sup> (23)</sup>\r\n<p><span>  Brown rejoins that\r\na guardian's application to settle a lawsuit is governed by section 234 of the Probate Code, which\r\nprovides in part:<sup> (24)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tWhen a personal representative deems it for the interest of the estate, he may,\r\nupon written application to the court, and by order granting authority:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t. . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t(4) Make compromises or settlements in relation to property or claims in\r\ndispute or litigation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Tex. Prob. Code Ann. § 234(a)(4) (West 1980).  Brown therefore argues he was not required to\r\ncomply with the requirements in sections 342 and 344 for the sale of personal property.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tElaine contends that settlement of a lawsuit is a sale of personal property because\r\nsection 3(z) of the Probate Code provides:  \"`Personal property' includes interests in . . . choses\r\nin action . . . .\"  Tex. Prob. Code Ann. § 3(z) (West Supp. 1994).  Thus, she argues that\r\nsettlement of a lawsuit is the sale of a chose in action.    </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe do not agree with Elaine's contention.  A chose in action is a right to bring an\r\naction or a right to recover a debt or money.   When a person sells a chose in action, he sells title\r\nto the right, which continues to exist.  When parties settle a lawsuit, they release their claims and\r\nno one may assert them; they are extinguished.  Thus, section 334 is found in chapter eight, part\r\nfive, of the Probate Code, entitled \"Sales,\" whereas section 234 is located in part five of chapter\r\nseven, entitled \"General Powers of Personal Representatives.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause we conclude that settlement of a lawsuit is not the sale of personal\r\nproperty, Brown was not required to comply with provisions of the Probate Code pertaining to\r\nthe sale of personal property in his application to settle the lawsuit.  <em>See San Antonio Sav.

In\r\n<em>Cozad</em>, the court held that the appellant had no standing because\r\nshe had no personal interest at stake, and yet expressly asserted\r\nthat she brought suit in her <em>individual</em> capacity, and not as a\r\nrepresentative for her mother.  <em>Id.</em> at 561.  In the present case,\r\nthe parties do not dispute that Edward brought the suit in a\r\nrepresentative capacity.\r\n</p><p>7.       A party may challenge lack of capacity to sue by special\r\nexception if such defect appears on the face of the petition.  2\r\n<em>Texas Civil Practice</em>, <em>supra</em> § 9:13, at 313.\r\n</p><p>8.       The record contains an order setting the plea in abatement\r\nfor hearing on July 10, 1992, but contains no written order or\r\nstatement of facts indicating that the trial court actually held\r\nthe hearing and ruled on the plea.  Elaine also filed special\r\nexceptions raising the issue of standing, but once again, although\r\nthe trial court set a hearing date, there is no indication that the\r\ntrial court ruled on the special exceptions.\r\n</p><p>9.       A party may not recover attorney's fees absent statutory\r\nauthorization or an agreement between the parties.  <em>Dallas Cent.\r\nAppraisal Dist. v. Seven Inv.

App.--Austin 1993, writ requested).  Elaine does not\r\ncomplain on appeal, nor did she object in the trial court, that\r\nEdward failed to segregate his claim for attorney's fees between\r\nthe various causes of action.  <em>See Aero Energy, Inc. v. Circle C\r\nDrilling Co.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2401634\"><a href=\"/opinion/2401634/aero-energy-inc-v-circle-c-drilling-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">699</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">821</span></a></span>, 823 (Tex. 1985); <em>Murrco Agency, Inc.\r\nv.

App.--Dallas 1990, no writ).    \r\n   \r\n</p><p>10.       In a non-jury case, the party must raise the issue before\r\nthe trial court signs the judgment.  Tex. R. Civ. P. 90.\r\n</p><p>11.       Question No. 10 asked:  \"Do you find from a preponderance\r\nof the evidence that Elaine Badouh Hale after January 1, 1988\r\nbreached a fiduciary duty to Mrs. Rubylien Barber Badouh by taking\r\nfor herself, her sons and third parties money from Mrs. Rubylien\r\nBarber Badouh's bank accounts?\"\r\n</p><p>12.       Question No. 11 asked:  \"What amount of money, if any, do\r\nyou find that Elaine Badouh Hale, after January 1, 1988 took for\r\nherself, her sons and third parties in violation of fiduciary\r\nduties owed to Mrs. Rubylien Barber Badouh?\"\r\n</p><p>13.       The order appointing Kimbel Brown is entitled, \"Order\r\nAppointing Attorney Ad Litem,\" although the text of the order\r\nstates that Kimbel Brown is appointed as <em>guardian</em> ad litem.  An\r\n<em>attorney</em> ad litem is an attorney appointed by the court to\r\nrepresent and advocate on behalf of a proposed ward, while a\r\n<em>guardian</em> ad litem is a person appointed by the court to represent\r\nthe best interests of a person in a guardianship proceeding.  Tex.\r\nProb. Code Ann. § 601(1), (9) (West Supp. 1994); <em>see also </em><em>Dawson v.\r\nGarcia</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1730165\"><a href=\"/opinion/1730165/dawson-v-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">666</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span>, 265 (Tex. App.--Dallas 1989, no writ)\r\n(noting guardian ad litem is not an attorney for represented\r\nperson).  None of the parties assign the confusion of terms in the\r\ntrial-court order as error, and in any event, an improper\r\ndesignation by the trial court is not fatal.  <em>See Phillips\r\nPetroleum Co. v. Welch</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1744632\"><a href=\"/opinion/1744632/phillips-petroleum-co-v-welch/\"><span class=\"volume\">702</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">672</span></a></span>, 674 (Tex.

Civ. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1967,\r\nwrit ref'd n.r.e.).  Moreover, in connection with assessment and\r\ntaxing of ad litem fees, the rules are the same whether the\r\nrepresentative is a guardian ad litem or attorney ad litem.  <em>See,\r\ne.g.</em>, <em>Dover Elevator Co. v. Servellon</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1523020\"><a href=\"/opinion/1523020/dover-elevator-co-v-servellon/\"><span class=\"volume\">812</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">366</span></a></span>, 368 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Dallas 1991, no writ) (finding trial court's decision\r\nregarding reasonable compensation for guardian ad litem within its\r\ndiscretion); <em>Lofton v.

Civ.\r\nApp.--Corpus Christi 1974, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (finding award of\r\nattorney ad litem fee within sound discretion of trial court).    \r\n \r\n</p><p>14.       The attorney ad litem filed two motions requesting an award\r\nof attorney's fees.  The trial court granted the first motion in\r\nJune 1992, awarding $6,500, and the second motion in October 1992,\r\nawarding $10,500.  In its final judgment, the trial court taxed the\r\nattorney ad litem's fee through June 9th against Elaine, and the\r\namounts awarded for work after June 9th against Mrs. Badouh's\r\nestate.\r\n</p><p>15.       At least one court does not agree that no evidence is\r\nrequired to support an award of ad litem fees.  <em>See </em><em>Brown &amp; Root\r\nU.S.A., Inc. v. Trevino</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1497269\"><a href=\"/opinion/1497269/brown-root-usa-inc-v-trevino/\"><span class=\"volume\">802</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 14 (Tex. App.--El Paso 1990,\r\nnor writ) (stating attorney ad litem fee is question of fact to be\r\ndetermined by the trier of facts and competent evidence must\r\nsupport award).  Moreover, in <em>Alford</em>, the court noted that no\r\nevidence is required to support an ad litem fee award, but because\r\nthe parties did present evidence, the court reviewed the evidence\r\nand held the trial court had abused its discretion and reduced the\r\naward to the ad litem.  <em>Alford</em>, 794 S.W.2d at 925-26.\r\n</p><p>16.       A hearing on a motion for new trial is an appropriate forum\r\nto develop evidence regarding the reasonableness of the attorney ad\r\nlitem fee.  <em>See Simon</em>, 739 S.W.2d at 794; <em>Navistar</em>, 740 S.W.2d at\r\n6.  Although Elaine asserted that the evidence was legally and\r\nfactually insufficient to support the amount of the award in her\r\namended motion for new trial, she did not request a hearing on the\r\nmotion.</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span> \r\n<p>17.       Elaine also argues that the trial court did not state good\r\ncause for apportioning the ad litem fees against her.  The trial\r\ncourt may adjudge costs other than in accordance with rule 131 for\r\ngood cause stated on the record.  Tex. R. Civ. P. 141.  It is error\r\nfor the trial court to tax costs other than in accordance with rule\r\n131 unless it states its reasons on the record.  <em>Neal v. Ardoin</em>,\r\n<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1632647\"><a href=\"/opinion/1632647/neal-v-ardoin/\"><span class=\"volume\">594</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></a></span>, 147 (Tex. Civ. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1980, no\r\nwrit).  However, because Elaine was not a successful party, the\r\ntrial court did not act outside the dictates of rule 131. \r\n</p><p>18.       Exhibit 30 is a six-page historical recapitulation of Mrs.\r\nBadouh's financial activity by year, based on her financial\r\nrecords.  Johec calculated the figures for 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991,\r\nand the first six months of 1992 for the following categories:  (1)\r\nMrs. Badouh's gross receipts; (2) Mrs. Badouh's living expenses;\r\n(3) cash for expenses; (4) fees for attorneys and accountants; (5)\r\nexpenditures for Elaine and her children; and (6) Mrs. Badouh's\r\noverhead expenses.  Additionally, Johec calculated Mrs. Badouh's\r\nhistorical cash flow by year in certain categories, such as living\r\nexpenses.  There is a projected income assumption.  Johec also\r\ncalculated Mrs. Badouh's personal expenses and her actual cash\r\navailable, and provided a summary of her conclusions concerning how\r\nmuch was spent for the entire time period in various categories. \r\nExhibits 31 through 33 are large charts or diagrams of information\r\ncontained in Exhibit 30.\r\n</p><p>19.       We do not find the request for production in the record;\r\nhowever, Edward does not dispute that Elaine requested production\r\nof the documents and that he did not produce them until August 6,\r\n1992.  Trial began on August 10th.  The supplementation deadline\r\nwas 30 days before trial.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. Civ. P. 166b(6).\r\n</p><p>20.       This is an appeal from a companion case involving Elaine\r\nBadouh Hale and Kimbel Brown, whom the trial court appointed as the\r\nguardian of Mrs. Badouh's estate.  \r\n</p><p>21.       Elaine does not appeal the portion of the order approving\r\nthe sale of Mrs. Badouh's personal property.  After the court\r\nissued its order, Brown filed a report of sale, to which Elaine\r\nagain objected for the failure to post notice in accordance in\r\nsection 344 of the Probate Code.  In response, Brown filed an\r\namended supplemental application for sale of personal property, and\r\nthe clerk posted notice for ten days in accordance with section\r\n344.  Elaine filed no objections or response.  \r\n</p><p>22.       Section 334 provides:  </p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tUpon application by the personal\r\nrepresentative of the estate or by any interested\r\nperson, the court may order the sale of any\r\npersonal property of the estate . . . if the court\r\nfinds that so to do would be in the best interest\r\nof the estate . . . .  In so far as possible,\r\napplications and orders for the sale of personal\r\nproperty shall conform to the requirements\r\nhereinafter set forth for applications and orders\r\nfor the sale of real estate.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Tex. Prob. Code Ann. § 334 (West 1980). \r\n<p>23.       Although sections 342 and 344 of the Probate Code pertain\r\nto applications for the sale of real estate, applications and\r\norders for the sale of personal property shall conform to the\r\nrequirements set forth for the sale of real estate.  Tex. Prob.\r\nCode Ann. § 334 (West 1980). </p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>24.       The trial court found that the application for approval of\r\nthe sale of personal property was separate and distinct from the\r\ncourt's approval to settle the lawsuit.</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",
