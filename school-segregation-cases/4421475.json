In 2014, Ohio enacted Senate Bills 205 and 216. Among other\nchanges to Ohio election law, they (1) required county boards of elections to reject the ballots of\nabsentee voters and provisional voters whose identification envelopes or affirmation forms,\nrespectively, contain an address or birthdate that does not perfectly match voting records;\n(2) reduced the number of post-election days for absentee voters to cure identification-envelope\nerrors, and provisional voters to present valid identification, from ten to seven; and (3) limited\nthe ways in which poll workers can assist in-person voters. The district court held that all three\nprovisions impose an undue burden on the right to vote and disparately impact minority voters.\n\n       We affirm the plaintiffs’ undue-burden claim only as it relates to the requirement\nimposed by Senate Bill 205 that in-person and mail-in absentee voters complete the address and\nbirthdate fields on the identification envelope with technical precision. We reverse the district\ncourt’s finding that the other provisions create an undue burden. We also reverse the district\ncourt’s finding that the provisions disparately impact minority voters. We affirm the district\ncourt’s other holdings.\n\nI. Background\n\n       Ohioans need not queue on Election Day to exercise the right to vote. The State accepts\nabsentee ballots by mail and, on designated early-voting days, in person. Ohio Rev. Code\n§§ 3509.01(B), 3509.05(A). A voter who declares that he or she is registered but whose name\ndoes not appear on a precinct’s list of eligible voters can cast an in-person provisional ballot on\neither an early-voting day or Election Day. Id. § 3505.181(A)(1), (B)(2).\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691              Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.                   Page 3\n\n\n        In 2014, the Ohio General Assembly enacted Senate Bills 205 (SB 205) and 216\n(SB 216), amending state election provisions that govern absentee and provisional voting. The\nlaws have been in effect since early June 2014.\n\n        A. SB 205\n\n        Any eligible voter can apply for an absentee ballot.                 Ohio Rev. Code § 3509.03.\nCompleting the application involves providing a name, signature, registration address, date of\nbirth, and a form of identification. Id. § 3509.03(A)–(E). Acceptable identification includes: a\ndriver’s license number; the last four digits of a Social Security number; or a copy of a valid\nphoto ID, valid military ID, current utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or\nother government document (excluding a registration notice) showing the voter’s name and\naddress. Id. § 3509.03(E). The same are acceptable forms of identification when casting an\nabsentee ballot. Id. § 3509.05(A). Applicants can request and receive an absentee ballot through\nthe mail by providing a mailing address. Id. § 3509.03(I).\n\n        When voting, mail-in and some in-person absentee voters must complete an\n“identification envelope” along with their ballots.1 The identification envelope contains fields\nfor the voter’s name, signature, voting residence, and birthdate. The county boards of elections\nmay preprint the voter’s name and address on the identification envelopes of mail-in voters. Id.\n§ 3509.04(B). The Secretary of State’s 2015 election manual “instruct[s]” the boards to do so in\norder to “eliminate any chance that a voter’s absentee ballot may be rejected for the sole reason”\nthat the voter failed to complete those fields. Before SB 205 went into effect, absentee ballots\ncould be rejected if the identification envelope “accompanying an absent voter’s ballot or absent\nvoter’s presidential ballot [was] insufficient,” if the signatures “d[id] not correspond with the\nperson’s registration signature,” or if the voter failed to provide identification. Ohio Rev. Code\n§ 3509.07 (2013). In 2010, the Secretary circulated a directive to the county boards of elections\nstating that the identification envelope must include a proper voter name and signature for the\ncorresponding ballot to be counted.\n\n\n\n        1\n          Some Ohio counties give early in-person voters the option to cast their ballots on a direct-recording\nelectronic-voting machine. Those who do so are not also required to complete the identification envelope.\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691                 Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.                           Page 4\n\n\n         SB 205 added two fields to that list.                It specifies that an identification envelope is\n“incomplete” without accurately filled birthdate2 and address fields.                              Ohio Rev. Code\n§ 3509.06(D)(3). An “incomplete” identification envelope results in the ballot’s rejection unless\nthe voter “provide[s] the necessary information to the board of elections in writing and on a form\nprescribed by the secretary of state.” Id. § 3509.06(D)(3)(b).\n\n         SB 205 made two other changes to Ohio election law that are at issue. When an absentee\nballot contains an error, the board of elections gives the voter notice of the additional information\nrequired for the ballot to be counted.                 SB 205 reduced the window for voters to submit\ncorrections from the ten days after Election Day to the seven days after Election Day. See ibid.\nIn addition, SB 205 prevents election officials from providing “assistance” to voters with the\nexceptions of voters who “[d]eclare[]” that they are “unable to mark” their ballot due to\n“blindness, disability, or illiteracy.” Id. § 3505.24.\n\n         B. SB 216\n\n         Provisional voters must complete a “provisional ballot affirmation” form. Ohio Rev.\nCode § 3505.182. Before the implementation of SB 216, a provisional ballot was counted if the\nvoter presented valid identification3 and the affirmation form included the voter’s name,\nsignature, and a statement of eligibility. Ohio Rev. Code § 3505.183(B)(1) (2013). The back of\nthe form contained a separate registration application. Provisional voters whose ballots were\nrejected for failure to register but who completed the application became registered for the next\nelection.\n\n         SB 216 added birthdate4 and address to the list of affirmation-form fields that provisional\nvoters must accurately complete. Ohio Rev. Code § 3505.183(B)(1)(a). The affirmation form\n\n\n         2\n          The birthdate requirement is satisfied if the voter provides a month and day of birth that match the month\nand day in the registration database, if the birthdate in the registration database is January 1, 1800, or if a majority of\nthe four-member elections board find that the voter has met the name, address, signature, and identification\nrequirements. Ohio Rev. Code § 3509.06(D)(3)(a)(iii).\n         3\n         The identification requirement for provisional voters is similar to that for absentee voters. See Ohio Rev.\nCode § 3505.18(A).\n         4\n          The birthdate requirement for provisional voters has similar exceptions to those for the requirement for\nabsentee voters. See Ohio Rev. Code § 3505.183(B)(3)(e).\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691                Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.                       Page 5\n\n\nnow doubles as a registration application, applicable to provisional voters whose ballots are\nrejected for failure to register. Id. § 3505.182(F). The bill also added the word “printed” before\n“name” in the list of affirmation-form requirements. Compare id. § 3505.183(B)(1)(a), with\nOhio Rev. Code § 3505.183(B)(1)(a) (2013).                   This appears to have clarified, rather than\nmodified, existing law. Between the 2008, 2010, and 2012 general elections, most counties\nrejected provisional ballots for failure to include a “printed” name.                      Furthermore, a 2012\ndirective from the Secretary instructed elections boards to reject provisional ballots whose\naffirmation statements lacked “the voter’s printed name.”\n\n          A provisional voter without valid identification may return to the board of elections to\ncure an otherwise complete ballot by providing a driver’s license number, state identification\ncard number, the last four digits of the individual’s Social Security number, a photo or military\nID, or a copy of a current utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or other\ngovernment document (excluding a registration notice) showing the voter’s name and address.\nOhio Rev. Code § 3505.181(B)(7)(a). SB 216 reduced the period for doing so from the ten days\nafter Election Day to the seven days after Election Day.                          Compare Ohio Rev. Code\n§ 3505.181(B)(8) (2013), with Ohio Rev. Code § 3505.181(B)(7).\n\n          C. Procedural History\n\n          In 2006, the Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless (NEOCH) and the Service\nEmployees International Union sued the Secretary to enjoin the enforcement of voter-\nidentification and provisional-ballot laws.5 Although perhaps rich source material for a prickly\ncivil-procedure hypothetical, the case’s many twists and turns are unnecessary to chronicle here.\nSuffice it to say, litigation was still proceeding in 2010 when the parties entered a consent\ndecree.\n\n          Ohio’s eighty-eight counties have four-person boards responsible for administrating local\nelections. The 2010 decree required the Secretary to inform elections boards to count the\nprovisional ballots of registered voters whose affirmation forms included an accurate name,\n\n          5\n           Within days of the plaintiffs’ filing suit, Ohio intervened as a defendant. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b). With\nthe parties’ consent, the Ohio Democratic Party (ODP) intervened as a plaintiff in 2008. Soon after, the Columbus\nCoalition for the Homeless (CCH) was added as a plaintiff.\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691                Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.                         Page 6\n\n\nverified signature, and the last four digits of the voter’s Social Security number. It also listed\ngrounds on which provisional ballots could not be rejected, including failure to “provide a date\nof birth” or “address . . . tied to a house, apartment or other dwelling [if] the voter indicated that\nhe or she resides at a non-building location.”6 The Secretary was required to give the court\nnotice of changes to the law that would “supersede” the decree.\n\n         The decree was in effect for the 2010 and 2012 elections. Although it was originally set\nto expire on June 30, 2013, the court, on the plaintiffs’ motion, extended it through the end of\n2016. In September 2014, the Secretary informed the court that SB 216’s rejection requirement\nfor imperfect birthdate and address fields, and the three-day reduction in the cure-period,\n“automatically amended” the decree.\n\n         The plaintiffs moved for leave to file a supplemental complaint. See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n15(d).       They petitioned the court to permanently enjoin the Secretary from implementing\nportions of SB 205 and SB 216. The defendants opposed. In August 2015, the court granted the\nmotion because SB 216 “ero[ded]” the consent decree’s protections and because both SB 205\nand SB 216 related to the original complaint, which challenged Ohio’s voter-identification\nrequirements more generally.\n\n         The supplemental complaint asserts ten counts: a viewpoint-discrimination claim under\nthe First and Fourteenth Amendments; claims under the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process\nClause of a fundamentally unfair voting system and violation of procedural due process; claims\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause of an undue burden, lack of uniform\nstandards, and arbitrary and disparate treatment; a claim of intentional discrimination in violation\nof the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments; and literacy-test, immaterial-error, and vote-denial\nclaims under the Voting Rights Act (VRA).\n\n         The court presided over a bench trial in March 2016. Over the course of twelve days, it\nheard the testimony of more than twenty board of elections officials from different counties, two\n\n         6\n           Ohio law requires elections boards to “examine any additional information” in addition to “determin[ing]\nwhether the individual who cast the provisional ballot is registered and eligible to vote in the applicable election” in\norder to “determine whether a provisional ballot is valid and entitled to be counted.” Ohio Rev. Code.\n§ 3505.183(B)(1)–(2). The original complaint alleged that elections boards would not “apply the same standards\nwhen . . . determining whether provisional ballots are eligible to be counted.”\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691           Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.            Page 7\n\n\nmembers of the Ohio General Assembly, the Assistant Secretary of State (who also serves as\n“head of elections”), and two members of the Ohio Association of Election Officials (OAEO),\nwhich includes members of the elections boards of every Ohio county and has equal\nrepresentation from the two major parties. In addition, the record includes declarations of\nabsentee and provisional voters whose ballots were rejected for birthdate and address errors.\nSeveral, for example, wrote the current date instead of their birthdates. One transposed the\nlocation of the digits indicating the month and day of his birth despite specific language on the\nform to the contrary because he grew up in a country that follows the date sequence used\nelsewhere in the world.\n\n       The court was also presented with opinion testimony from Dr. Jeffrey Timberlake for the\nplaintiffs, and Drs. Nolan McCarty and M.V. Hood, III, for the defendants. Because Ohio does\nnot record the race or ethnicity of its voters, Timberlake used county-level data to make\ninferences about the relationship between voter race and the use or rejection of absentee and\nprovisional ballots. He examined data from the 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014 general elections.\n\n       Timberlake divided counties into “high minority” and “low minority” groups, and\nperformed a regression assessing the correlation between a county’s percent minority and\nabsentee and provisional ballot use and rejection. Two of his models controlled for urbanicity,\nand the age, education, and income of the white population. In those models, Timberlake\nobserved “some evidence, though not very strong evidence, that absentee ballots are used more\nheavily by voters in high-minority counties.” He found “much stronger” evidence of higher rates\nof absentee-ballot rejection among African-American voters. All four elections showed higher\nuse and rejection rates of provisional ballots in higher-minority counties, even when controlling\nfor urbanicity and the three white-population characteristics.\n\n       The district court’s opinion gave “great weight” to Timberlake’s conclusions. It found\nthat the defense expert witnesses did not refute Timberlake’s report. The court next considered\nnine nonexhaustive factors from Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30 (1986), “that might be\nprobative” of a violation of Section 2 of the VRA. Id. at 36; id. at 36–37. In particular, the court\nconcluded that the evidence on the record did not support Ohio’s justifications for enacting\nSB 205 and SB 216.\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691               Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.                      Page 8\n\n\n          Ultimately, the court entered judgment for the plaintiffs on their undue-burden and vote-\ndenial claims, and for the defendants on all other counts.                     It permanently enjoined the\nenforcement of the portions of SB 205 and SB 216 that: require boards to reject the ballots of\nabsentee and provisional voters who do not accurately complete the address and birthdate fields;\nreduce the cure period to seven days; prohibit most forms of poll-worker assistance; and require\nprovisional voters to print their names on the affirmation form.\n\n          Ohio appeals the entry of judgment for the plaintiffs on the undue-burden and vote-denial\nclaims.       Additionally, it contends that the court improperly approved the supplemental\ncomplaint, that the plaintiffs should have been precluded from bringing their challenges, and that\nthey lack standing. The plaintiffs cross-appeal the entry of judgment for Ohio on the uniform-\nstandards, literacy-test, due-process, intentional-discrimination, and immaterial-error claims.\n\nII. Claim Preclusion and Standing\n\n          Ohio argues that all three plaintiffs, and the Ohio Democratic Party (ODP) at the very\nleast, are bound by the district court’s decision in Ohio Org. Collaborative v. Husted, No. 2:15-\ncv-1802, 2016 WL 3248030 (S.D. Ohio May 24, 2016). If claim preclusion prevents ODP from\nproceeding, Ohio asserts, we should next consider its argument that the remaining plaintiffs,\nNEOCH and the Columbus Coalition for the Homeless (CCH), lack standing. That one-two\npunch is too clever by half. Even if ODP were bound by Ohio Org. Collaborative (an issue on\nwhich we need not opine),7 NEOCH and CCH are not. And they have standing to bring suit.\n\n          For the first time on appeal, Ohio contends that NEOCH and CCH are precluded from\nbringing their claims because of a decision in a suit in which ODP was a party that was issued\ntwo weeks before the district-court judgment in this case. Even assuming that Ohio did not\nwaive this argument by failing to raise it before the district court, see Mun. Resale Serv.\nCustomers v. FERC, 43 F.3d 1046, 1052 n.4 (6th Cir. 1995), it is without merit. “The general\nrule” of claim preclusion “provides that when a court of competent jurisdiction has entered a\n\n\n          7\n          In August 2015, plaintiff Ohio Organizing Collaborative moved to substitute three parties in its place,\nincluding ODP, and to “drop . . . claims that overlap with those in” this case. Ohio opposed the latter motion. The\ncourt granted the substitution request but denied the motion to amend. Ohio Org. Collaborative v. Husted, No. 2:15-\ncv-1802 (S.D. Ohio Sept. 2, 2015) (opinion and order).\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691          Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.           Page 9\n\n\nfinal judgment on the merits of a cause of action, the parties to the suit and their privies are\nthereafter bound . . . ‘as to every matter which was offered and received to sustain or defeat the\nclaim or demand.’” Commissioner v. Sunnen, 333 U.S. 591, 597 (1948) (quoting Cromwell v.\nCounty of Sac, 94 U.S. 351, 352 (1876)). “[I]n certain limited circumstances,” a nonparty is\n“adequately represented by someone with the same interests who is a party.” Martin v. Wilks,\n490 U.S. 755, 762 n.2 (1989). However, “to bind litigants to a judgment rendered in an earlier\nlitigation to which they were not parties and in which they were not adequately represented”\nwould violate due process. Richards v. Jefferson County, 517 U.S. 793, 794 (1996) (citing\nHansberry v. Lee, 311 U.S. 32 (1940)).\n\n       An essential element of adequate representation is that “[t]he interests of the nonparty\nand her representative are aligned.” Amos v. PPG Indus., Inc., 699 F.3d 448, 452 (6th Cir. 2012)\n(quoting Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, 900 (2008)). Citing Amos, Ohio suggests that the\n“aligned interests” of ODP and the other plaintiffs “are shown by the fact that they co-litigated\nthis case with joint pleadings.” First Br. 58. The lax approach to nonparty preclusion implied by\nthat reasoning would unmoor the requirement of “adequacy” from the anchor of\n“representation.”   “Representative capacity must be established . . . by private or public\nappointment”—not by the assertions of a “self-appointed volunteer,” and certainly not by acting\nas co-parties in a later suit. 18A Charles Alan Wright , Arthur R. Miller & Edward H. Cooper,\nFederal Practice and Procedure § 4454 (2d ed. 2002). ODP did not represent NEOCH and\nCCH in Ohio Org. Collaborative.\n\n       Further, mere overlapping interest will not work to preclude a nonparty from litigating a\nclaim that a putative representative tried earlier. See Becherer v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner\n& Smith, Inc., 193 F.3d 415, 424 (6th Cir. 1999) (en banc) (rejecting claim of “virtual\nrepresentation” when nonparty and supposed representative lacked “legal relationship”). Nor\ndoes Ohio point to any indication that “special procedures” were put in place to protect the\ninterests of NEOCH and CCH in Ohio Org. Collaborative. Amos, 699 F.3d at 452. NEOCH and\nCCH are therefore not bound in this case by an earlier judgment against ODP.\n\n       Whether a party has standing is a legal question that appellate courts review de novo.\nShearson v. Holder, 725 F.3d 588, 592 (6th Cir. 2013). When one party has standing to bring a\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691           Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.             Page 10\n\n\nclaim, the identical claims brought by other parties to the same lawsuit are justiciable. Dep’t of\nCommerce v. U.S. House of Representatives, 525 U.S. 316, 330 (1999). Because NEOCH has\norganizational standing, we do not reach Ohio’s other arguments regarding NEOCH’s and\nCCH’s standing to bring suit.\n\n       To establish standing, a plaintiff must show a concrete and particularized injury that is\nactual or imminent, a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of, and\nlikelihood that a favorable decision will redress the injury. H.D.V.-Greektown, LLC v. City of\nDetroit, 568 F.3d 609, 616 (6th Cir. 2009). In addition to suing on behalf of its members, an\nentity may sue “on its own behalf because it has suffered a palpable injury as a result of the\ndefendants’ actions.” MX Grp., Inc. v. City of Covington, 293 F.3d 326, 332–33 (6th Cir. 2002).\n\n       Ohio points to our recent decision in Fair Elections Ohio v. Husted, 770 F.3d 456 (6th\nCir. 2014), and argues that NEOCH and CCH have suffered no injury. In that case, we held that\nan organization that had conducted voter outreach lacked standing to challenge absentee-ballot\nprocedures permitting hospitalized voters to obtain absentee ballots later than jailed voters. Id. at\n459. The bases offered to support its injury claim—instructing election volunteers who were\nalready being trained in current absentee-voting procedures and speculation that the law\ncompelled the group to divert resources—were insufficient. Id. at 459–60.\n\n       Unlike the plaintiff organization in Fair Elections that challenged then-existing voting\nlaw, NEOCH takes issue with newly enacted provisions. That distinction is not just academic.\nWhereas the Fair Election plaintiff merely exhausted “efforts and expense [in] advis[ing] others\nhow to comport with” existing law, id. at 460, NEOCH has immediate plans to mobilize its\nlimited resources to revise its voter-education and get-out-the-vote programs on account of\nSB 205 and SB 216. In the past, NEOCH focused on educating and assisting the homeless with\nmail-in voting. Given the changes ushered in by SB 205 and SB 216, NEOCH determined that\nits resources are better spent assisting the homeless in participating in early in-person voting. To\nthat end, it plans to redirect its focus for the 2016 general election by encouraging early in-\nperson voting and driving homeless voters to the polls. It reports that this will require more\nvolunteers, time, and expenditures. That is not simply the “effort and expense” associated with\nadvising voters how to “comport” with the law, ibid., but an overhaul of the get-out-the-vote\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691           Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.            Page 11\n\n\nstrategy of an organization that uses its limited resources helping homeless voters cast ballots.\nTheir injury is imminent, as well as concrete and particularized.\n\n       Standing must exist as to each claim, however, and cannot be “dispensed in gross.”\nLewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 358 n.4 (1996). But the record demonstrates that NEOCH has\nstanding for its VRA claims as well. The injury suffered by NEOCH, as noted above, is directly\nrelated to SB 205 and SB 216’s alleged impact on the opportunity to vote of the African-\nAmerican community. Because their allegations indicate that the burden would cause them to\nchange significantly their expenditures and operation and a favorable decision would redress that\ninjury, NEOCH has organizational standing here as well. Finally, with regard to the cause of\naction, the VRA permits suit by the Attorney General or aggrieved voters, see Allen v. State Bd.\nof Elections, 393 U.S. 544, 557 (1969), but the Supreme Court has permitted organizations to\nbring suit in VRA claims, see Ala. Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, 135 S. Ct. 1257 (2015).\n\nIII. Supplemental Pleadings\n\n       The district court did not abuse its discretion by granting the plaintiffs’ motion to file a\nsupplemental complaint. A district court may “permit a party to serve a supplemental pleading\nsetting out any transaction, occurrence, or event that happened after the date of the pleading to be\nsupplemented.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(d). Rule 15(d) aims “to give the court broad discretion in\nallowing a supplemental pleading.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(d) advisory committee’s note to 1963\namendment.\n\n       We review for abuse of discretion. See Spies v. Voinovich, 48 F. App’x 520, 527\n(6th Cir. 2002). A district court abuses its discretion by relying on an incorrect legal standard,\nmisapplying the correct legal standard, or judging the outcome based on clearly erroneous factual\nfindings. Paterek v. Village of Armada, 801 F.3d 630, 643 (6th Cir. 2015).\n\n       Here, the court found that the original and supplemental complaints were sufficiently\nlinked because SB 216 superseded the consent decree’s protections and because both provisions\nallegedly imposed burdens that would impede voting in similar ways as the voter-identification\nprovisions originally challenged. “In essence,” the court found, “the ‘focal points’ of both\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691              Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.                     Page 12\n\n\ncomplaints are the same: ensuring all ballots, but particularly provisional and absentee\nballots, . . . are not unfairly excluded and left uncounted due to illegal voter identification rules.”\n\n        In so concluding, the court carefully applied the correct legal standard and did not make\nclearly erroneous factual findings. The supplemental complaint revolved around new election\nlaws that affected the terms of a longstanding consent decree that resolved an even lengthier\ndispute. So, Defendants’ reliance on Leisure Caviar, 616 F.3d at 616, which addressed the issue\nof newly discovered evidence after entry of judgment, is misplaced. See First Br. 56. The\ndistrict court did not clearly err when it found that the plaintiffs’ primary grievance with both\nsets of provisions was that methods of voter identification caused elections boards to\ndisproportionately reject homeless voters’ absentee and provisional ballots. The interest of\njudicial economy, although not necessarily enough in and of itself, also militates in favor of\nallowing supplemental pleadings. When a dispute is complicated and protracted, and a new\ncomplaint the likely alternative, allowing supplemental pleadings before a court already up to\nspeed is often the most efficient course.\n\nIV. Voting Rights Act Claims\n\n        All three VRA claims are contested on appeal. Ohio appeals the judgment on the vote-\ndenial claim. The plaintiffs appeal the judgment on the literacy-test and materiality claims.\n\n        A. Vote Denial or Abridgment\n\n                 1. Legal Framework\n\n        We review the district court’s legal conclusions de novo and factual findings for clear\nerror. Lindstrom v. A-C Prod. Liab. Tr., 424 F.3d 488, 492 (6th Cir. 2005). “Under the clear-\nerror standard, we abide by the court's findings of fact unless the record ‘le[aves] [us] with the\ndefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.’” United States v. Yancy,\n725 F.3d 596, 598 (6th Cir. 2013) (alterations in original) (quoting United States v. Gardner,\n649 F.3d 437, 442 (6th Cir. 2011)).8\n\n\n        8\n          Although the dissent repeatedly classifies our review as de novo, our approach is consistent with\nestablished precedent in reversing the district court where the overall record is inconsistent with the findings.\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691               Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.                      Page 13\n\n\n        In City of Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55 (1980), the Supreme Court held that racially\nneutral state action did not fall within the ambit of VRA Section 2. Congress countered by\namending Section 2. That response “ma[d]e clear” to the Court “that a violation [of Section 2]\ncould be proved by showing discriminatory effect alone.” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 35. Section 2\nnow reads:\n\n        (a) No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or\n            procedure shall be imposed or applied by any State or political subdivision in\n            a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of\n            the United States to vote on account of race or color, or in contravention of the\n            guarantees set forth in section 10303(f)(2) of this title, as provided in\n            subsection (b).\n        (b) A violation of subsection (a) is established if, based on the totality of\n            circumstances, it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or\n            election in the State or political subdivision are not equally open to\n            participation by members of a class of citizens protected by subsection (a) in\n            that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to\n            participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.\n            The extent to which members of a protected class have been elected to office\n            in the State or political subdivision is one circumstance which may be\n            considered: Provided, That nothing in this section establishes a right to have\n            members of a protected class elected in numbers equal to their proportion in\n            the population.\n\n52 U.S.C. § 10301 (Supp. II Vol. III 2015). The statute operates as a “permanent, nationwide\nban,” Shelby County v. Holder, 133 S. Ct. 2612, 2631 (2013), on “even the most subtle forms of\ndiscrimination,” Chisom v. Roemer, 501 U.S. 380, 406 (1991) (Scalia, J., dissenting).\n\n        “The essence of a [Section] 2 claim” is the assertion that a challenged provision “interacts\nwith social and historical conditions” to cause an inequality of opportunity for racial minority\nvoters. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 47. Evaluating that allegation “requires ‘an intensely local appraisal\nof the design and impact’ of the contested electoral mechanisms.” Id. at 79 (quoting Rogers v.\nLodge, 458 U.S. 613, 622 (1982)). Section 2 claims involve either vote denial or vote dilution.\nExamining a vote-dilution claim in Gingles, the Supreme Court embraced nine nonexhaustive\nfactors as relevant in assessing “the totality of circumstances” for establishing a Section 2\n\n\nSee, e.g., Indmar Prod. Co. v. Comm’r, 444 F.3d 771, 778 (6th Cir. 2006) (“[W]hile our review is deferential, it is\nnot nugatory.”).\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691           Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.            Page 14\n\n\nviolation. Because the Court has yet to consider a Section 2 vote-denial claim after Gingles, the\nstandard for such adjudication is unsettled.\n\n       In Ohio State Conference of the NAACP v. Husted, 768 F.3d 524 (6th Cir. 2014), we\nstated the analytical framework for Section 2 vote-denial claims as a two-part test: (1) “[T]he\nchallenged ‘standard, practice, or procedure’ must impose a discriminatory burden on members\nof a protected class, meaning that members of the protected class ‘have less opportunity than\nother members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives\nof their choice,’” and (2) “that burden must in part be caused by or linked to ‘social and\nhistorical conditions’ that have or currently produce discrimination against members of the\nprotected class.” Id. at 554 (quoting 52 U.S.C. § 10301 (Supp. II Vol. III 2015) and Gingles,\n478 U.S. at 47). The Ohio State Conference panel affirmed an order preliminarily enjoining\nOhio from reducing early in-person voting for the 2014 general election. The Supreme Court\nstayed that order. Husted v. Ohio State Conference of NAACP, 135 S. Ct. 42 (2014). Because\nthe injunction applied only to the upcoming election, the panel vacated its opinion—including its\narticulation of the Section 2 vote-denial test. Ohio State Conference of the NAACP v. Husted,\nNo. 14-3877, 2014 WL 10384647 (6th Cir. Oct. 1, 2014). On remand to the district court, the\nparties reached a settlement.\n\n       Two circuits have since adopted the Ohio State Conference test. See Veasey v. Abbott,\n___ F.3d. ___, No. 14-41127, 2016 WL 3923868, at *17 (5th Cir. July 20, 2016) (en banc);\nLeague of Women Voters of N.C. v. North Carolina, 769 F.3d 224, 240 (4th Cir. 2014). The\ndistrict court used it in this case, and a recent Sixth Circuit panel found it “helpful” in\ndetermining a Section 2 vote-denial claim. Ohio Democratic Party v. Husted, ___ F.3d ___,\n2016 WL 4437605, at * 13 (6th Cir. Aug. 23, 2016) (evaluating a vote-denial claim using the\nOhio State Conference framework, with additional clarification).\n\n       Ohio argues that the two-part test goes awry in two ways. Whether the district court did\nin fact mischaracterize the test is irrelevant, however. At the very least, a successful Section 2\nclaim requires the plaintiffs to prove disparate impact. The plaintiffs failed to prove that SB 205\nand SB 216 have a disparate impact on African-American voters. Therefore, analysis of any test\nbeyond disparate impact is unnecessary.\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691                Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.                       Page 15\n\n\n                  2. SB 205 and SB 216\n\n       The district court found that “Timberlake’s data on disparities in provisional and absentee\nballot usage and rejection rates reveal that higher minority population share is correlated to\nhigher rates of absentee ballot rejection and provisional ballot usage and rejection.” Based on\nthat analysis, it concluded that SB 205 and SB 216 make “African-American voters . . . more\nlikely than white voters to have their absentee or provisional ballots rejected.” The record would\nindicate otherwise.\n\n       For starters, Timberlake’s regression analysis simply does not support the conclusion that\nSB 205’s address and birthdate perfection requirement, or its limitation on poll-worker\nassistance, disparately impact minority voters. When controlling for urbanicity and the age,\nincome, and education of the white population, Timberlake found that for every additional one\npercent minority in a county, use of absentee ballots increased by a small amount in the 2008 and\n2010 general elections—134.2 and 195.2, respectively, for every 100,000 voting-age residents—\nbut decreased by 99.5 and 96.6 ballots in the 2012 and 2014 general elections.9 He therefore\nfound that the evidence to support the conclusion that high-minority counties use absentee\nballots more heavily was “not very strong.”\n\n       Certainly additional absentee ballots are rejected on account of the perfection\nrequirement. But there is scant evidence in the record that minority voters are more likely to cast\nabsentee ballots than white voters. It would therefore be illogical to infer that rejecting absentee\nballots for failure to accurately complete address and birthdate fields disproportionately affects\nminority voters without some other evidence that minority voters are less likely to fulfill those\nrequirements. And, as discussed in more detail elsewhere, the vast majority of absentee-ballot\nrejections are for reasons other than those challenged here.\n\n       The same is true of the limits that SB 205 places on poll workers. To be sure, the\nprovision will impact the hypothetical early in-person absentee voter whose ballot would have\nbeen rejected in past elections but for now-prohibited forms of assistance. Yet the record\ncontains no evidence of how many, if any, voters received such additional “assistance.” Because\n\n       9\n           Timberlake did not separately analyze in-person absentee voting and mail-in absentee voting.\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691           Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.              Page 16\n\n\nevidence of higher minority absentee-ballot usage is weak, and the record does not indicate that\nminority voters disproportionately benefited from assistance that is now proscribed, plaintiffs\nhave not demonstrated a disparate impact.\n\n        On their other Section 2 claims, the plaintiffs fail to show that the challenged provisions\nwill have much of an impact on the right to vote at all. The district court reasoned that reducing\nthe cure period from ten to seven days would burden illiterate voters and voters for whom\ntravelling to cure their ballots presents logistical difficulties. Hypothetically speaking, a scenario\ncould exist where voters showed up in droves to correct absentee-ballot errors and to produce\nprovisional-ballot ID during those three days. But that has not been the case in Ohio. In fact, the\nsingle election-board official whose trial testimony the district court cited in support of its\nconclusion stated that in Hamilton County, Ohio’s third most populous, “very few voters” cured\ntheir ballots during that three-day window. The record contains no evidence on the number of\nabsentee or provisional voters who took advantage of the cure days eliminated by SB 205 and\nSB 216. A law cannot disparately impact minority voters if its impact is insignificant to begin\nwith.\n\n        Challenges to SB 216’s perfection requirement of provisional voters and its limitation on\npoll-worker assistance suffer from the same shortcoming.             The conclusion that SB 216\ndisproportionately impacts minority voters is not borne out in the data. For the vast majority of\nprovisional voters whose ballots are rejected, no amount of help would change the result. The\nrecord contains provisional voting data for the 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2015 general\nelections. In every one of those elections, eighty to ninety percent of provisional voters whose\nballots were rejected either had failed to register at all or voted in the wrong place. Placing a\nminor check on election workers’ interactions with in-person voters has no impact on the vast\nmajority of provisional-ballot rejections.\n\n        SB 216 has been in effect during the two most recent general elections. The provisional\nballots of 247 voters in 2014 and 373 voters in 2015 were rejected for failure to provide an\naccurate birthdate or address. Respectively, these figures represented about five and three\npercent of rejected provisional ballots—and less than one percent of all provisional ballots cast.\nWhat is more, the 2015 figure does not account for individuals whose 2014 ballots were rejected\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691           Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.              Page 17\n\n\nfor failure to register but who accurately completed the affirmation form and successfully\nregistered for the next election. Presumably, some of those voters would not have registered\notherwise, which means that SB 216 has the effect of reducing the number of ballots rejected on\nthe basis of nonregistration in future elections. That impact helps to counter the small impact\nthat SB 216 does have. Given the negligible impact of SB 216’s perfection requirement on\nballot rejection, the plaintiffs have not shown that the provision disproportionately affects\nminority voters.\n\n       B. Literacy Test\n\n       Section 4 of the VRA provides that “[n]o citizen shall be denied” the right to vote\n“because of his failure to comply with any test or device.” 52 U.S.C. § 10501(a) (Supp. II Vol.\nIII 2015). “Test or device” is defined as a requirement that, as a prerequisite to vote or register, a\nperson demonstrate the ability to “read, write, understand, or interpret any matter,” demonstrate\n“educational achievement” or “knowledge” of any subject, “possess good moral character,” or\nhave others “vouch[]” for them. Id. § 10501(b).\n\n       The district court found that § 10501 includes a private right of action before concluding\nthat the challenged provisions do not violate the statute. Even if a private right of action is\npermitted, we agree with the district court that SB 205 and SB 216 do not impose a “test or\ndevice” on Ohio voters.\n\n       The plaintiffs equate the requirement that absentee and provisional voters accurately\ncomplete address and birthdate fields with the “vague, arbitrary, hypertechnical or unnecessarily\ndifficult” tests cited by Congress as evidence of the urgent need for the VRA. H.R. Rep. No. 89-\n439, at 13 (1965). However, requiring voters’ most basic biographical and personal information\nbears no similarity to selectively enforced voting tests whose “only real function” is to “foster\nracial discrimination.” Ibid.; see also id. at 12 (citing United States v. Louisiana, 225 F. Supp.\n353, 358 (E.D. La. 1963) (three-judge panel finding a Louisiana Constitution requirement that\nregistration applicants be able to read and “give a reasonable interpretation” of any clause of the\nLouisiana or United States Constitution violated Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments), aff’d,\n380 U.S. 145 (1965)); S. Rep. 89-162, pt. III, at 11–12 (1965) (cataloging cases of\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691           Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.               Page 18\n\n\n“discriminatory misuse” of literacy tests and “good moral character” requirements).               The\naddress-and-birth-date requirements simply do not fall within the meaning of “test or device,” as\nused in the statute. 52 U.S.C. § 10501(b). To the extent that the House Report censures\n“‘perfect form’ requirements,” no such prohibition appears in the text of the statute itself.\nCompare H.R. Rep. 89-439, at 13, with 52 U.S.C. § 10501.                In these circumstances, the\nunambiguous language of the statute must prevail. See Rote v. Zel Custom Mfg. LLC, 816 F.3d\n383, 394 (6th Cir. 2016) (heeding Supreme Court’s “admonishment to courts not to add any\nunexpressed requirements to the language of the statute” (quoting Keller v. Cent. Bank of\nNigeria, 277 F.3d 811, 818 (6th Cir. 2002))).\n\n       To the extent that recording birthdate or address proves difficult for some voters, Ohio\nexplicitly permits election officials to assist those who are blind, disabled, or illiterate in marking\ntheir ballots. See Ohio Rev. Code §§ 3505.24(B), 3505.181(F). The plaintiffs’ supposition that\nthe stigma of illiteracy deters some voters from requesting assistance distracts from the focus of\nthe inquiry—state action. To fill the address and birthdate fields, voters need not “demonstrate\nthe ability” to read or write any more so than they do to otherwise complete a ballot.\n\n       C. Immaterial Error\n\n       The VRA provides that no one acting under color of law may “deny the right of any\nindividual to vote in any election because of an error or omission” on a registration application or\nvoting ballot if the error or omission “is not material” in determining whether the individual is\nqualified to vote. 52 U.S.C. § 10101(a)(2)(B) (Supp. II Vol. III 2015). A later subsection of\n§ 10101 states that when any person has deprived another of “any right or privilege secured by\nsubsection (a) . . . , the Attorney General may institute for the United States . . . a civil action or\nother proper proceeding for preventive relief.” Id. at § 10101(c).\n\n       We have held that the negative implication of Congress’s provision for enforcement by\nthe Attorney General is that the statute does not permit private rights of action. See McKay v.\nThompson, 226 F.3d 752, 756 (6th Cir. 2000). Another circuit later reached the opposite\nconclusion. See Schwier v. Cox, 340 F.3d 1284, 1294–96 (11th Cir. 2003). It reasoned, in part,\nthat the Supreme Court had found other VRA sections enforceable by private right of action\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691          Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.             Page 19\n\n\ndespite their provision for Attorney General enforcement and that before the Attorney General\nlanguage was appended to the statute, plaintiffs “could and did” bring enforcement actions under\n42 U.S.C. § 1983. Id. at 1295.\n\n       “A panel of this court may not overturn binding precedent because a published prior\npanel decision ‘remains controlling authority unless an inconsistent decision of the United States\nSupreme Court requires modification of the decision or this Court sitting en banc overrules the\nprior decision.’” United States v. Elbe, 774 F.3d 885, 891 (6th Cir. 2014) (quoting Salmi v. Sec’y\nof Health & Human Servs., 774 F.2d 685, 689 (6th Cir. 1985)). McKay v. Thompson therefore\nbinds this panel. The plaintiffs may not bring an action for a violation of § 10101(a).\n\nV. Equal-Protection Claims\n\n       Three equal-protection questions are at issue on appeal: Whether the challenged\nprovisions (1) unduly burden the right to vote; (2) result in a lack of uniform standards; and\n(3) were enacted with a discriminatory purpose. Once again, we review the district court’s legal\nconclusions de novo and factual findings for clear error.\n\n       A. Undue Burden\n\n               1. Legal Standard\n\n       The certainty that every election law places at least some burden on individual voters\ndemands that courts weigh that hindrance against the provision’s regulatory justification. On one\nhand, “voting is of the most fundamental significance under our constitutional structure.”\nIll. State Bd. of Elections v. Socialist Workers Party, 440 U.S. 173, 184 (1979). On the other,\n“[c]ommon sense, as well as constitutional law, compels the conclusion that government must\nplay an active role in structuring elections.” Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 433 (1992).\nAcknowledging this tension, the Supreme Court has articulated a “flexible standard” to apply\nwhen considering challenges to state election law:\n\n       A court . . . must weigh “the character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the\n       rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments that the plaintiff seeks\n       to vindicate” against “the precise interests put forward by the State as\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691           Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.            Page 20\n\n\n       justifications for the burden imposed by its rule,” taking into consideration “the\n       extent to which those interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff’s rights.”\n\nId. at 434 (quoting Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 789 (1983)).\n\n       In practice, the level of scrutiny into a challenged election law varies based on the\nseverity of its constraint on voting rights. “[S]evere restriction[s]” must be “narrowly drawn to\nadvance a state interest of compelling importance.” Norman v. Reed, 502 U.S. 279, 289 (1992).\nAt the other end of the spectrum, “minimally burdensome and nondiscriminatory” regulations\ninevitably result in “a less-searching examination.” Ohio Council 8 Am. Fed’n of State v.\nHusted, 814 F.3d 329, 335 (6th Cir. 2016). For regulations that “fall[] somewhere in between\nthe two extremes, ‘the burden on the plaintiffs is weighed against the state’s asserted interest and\nchosen means of pursuing it.’” Ibid. (quoting Green Party of Tenn. v. Hargett, 767 F.3d 533,\n546 (6th Cir. 2014)) (alteration omitted). As a general matter, “important regulatory interests are\ngenerally sufficient to justify reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions.” Anderson, 460 U.S. at\n788.\n\n       In striking portions of SB 205 and SB 216, the district court considered the burdens that\nthe provisions impose on NEOCH’s and CCH’s homeless and illiterate members. Zeroing in on\nthe abnormal burden experienced by a small group of voters is problematic at best, and\nprohibited at worst. In Crawford v. Marion Cty. Election Bd., 553 U.S. 181 (2008), the Supreme\nCourt upheld an Indiana voter-ID law. The plaintiffs urged the Court to consider the burden\nimposed on the “narrow class of voters” who could not afford or obtain a birth certification and\nhad to return to the circuit court clerk’s office after voting. Id. at 200 (opinion of Stevens, J.).\nThe lead opinion refrained from weighing the “special burden” faced by “a small number of\nvoters” because the evidence on the record gave “no indication of how common the problem is,”\nwhich made it impossible “to quantify . . . the magnitude of the burden.” Id. at 200, 202. A\nconcurrence rejected outright the idea of measuring the burden on a subset of voters. “[W]hat\npetitioners view as the law’s several light and heavy burdens,” it reasoned, “are no more than the\ndifferent impacts of the single burden that the law uniformly imposes on all voters.” Id. at 205\n(Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment).\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691                Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.                        Page 21\n\n\n         In any event, the district court erred by weighing Ohio’s regulatory interests against the\nburden that the challenged provisions uniquely place on homeless and illiterate voters.10 Even\nunder the controlling opinion’s more liberal approach to burden measuring, the record here is\ndevoid of quantifiable evidence from which an arbiter could gauge the frequency with which this\nnarrow class of voters has been or will become disenfranchised as a result of SB 205 and\nSB 216. We therefore consider the burden that the provisions place on all Ohio voters.\n\n                  2. SB 205 and SB 216\n\n         Address and Birthdate Requirements. Requiring boards of elections to reject the ballots\nof absentee and provisional voters who fail to accurately complete birthdate and address\nfields directly and measurably disenfranchises some voters. As discussed, see supra p. 16, in the\n2014 and 2015 general elections, 620 provisional ballots were rejected as failing to meet\nSB 216’s address and birthdate perfection requirements, out of a total of 16,942 rejections.\nAmong over 860,000 domestic civilian absentee ballots cast in 2014 and 430,000 in 2015,\n1378 ballots were rejected in 2014, and 334 in 2015, for failure to comply with the similar\nprovision in SB 205.11\n\n         Considering the number of total ballots cast in a general election in Ohio, these figures\nare small. And yet, as demonstrated through voter declarations and the testimony of board\nofficials, the formal rigidity of the challenged requirements may leave no room for elections\nboards to make their own judgments on voter eligibility. As a result, identifiable voters may be\ndisenfranchised based only on a technicality. For example, transposing the location of the month\nand year numerals of a birthdate, writing the current date by mistake, and inverting digits in an\naddress have been cited by elections boards as reasons for automatic ballot rejection.\n\n         A facial challenge to a state law fails “where the statute has a ‘plainly legitimate sweep.’”\nWash. State Grange v. Wash. State Republican Party, 552 U.S. 442, 449 (2008) (quoting\n\n         10\n               Illiterate voters may request and receive assistance in marking their ballots from nearly “any person of\nthe[ir] . . . choice,” including “two election officials of different political parties.” Ohio Rev. Code. § 3505.24.\nHomeless voters may register their address as “a shelter or other location at which the person has been a consistent\nor regular inhabitant and to which the person has the intention of returning.” Id. § 3503.02(I).\n         11\n           In addition, 633 domestic civilian absentee ballots were rejected in 2014, and 346 in 2015, because the\nvoter ID envelope “[c]ontains [i]nsufficiient [sic] [i]nformation.” Cf. Ohio Rev. Code § 3509.07(A).\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691           Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.             Page 22\n\n\nWashington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 740 n.7 (1997) (Stevens, J., concurring in the\njudgments)). For SB 216, the interest in registering provisional voters outweighs the burden of\ncompleting the address and birthdate fields. Most provisional-ballot rejections occur in Ohio\nbecause the purported voter was not registered. In 2012, a presidential-election year, over\n20,000 provisional ballots were rejected for failure to register. Ohio uses the affirmation form to\nregister the unregistered provisional voters who unsuccessfully try to cast ballots each year.\n\n       The additional fields also help elections boards positively identify provisional voters. For\ntheir ballots to be counted, provisional voters must be located in a statewide database of\nregistered voters. Predictably, entering a provisional voter’s name and the last four digits of their\nSocial Security number into the database can result in multiple hits. Birthdate and address\ninformation can narrow the plausible registered voters and assist in confirming an eligible voter’s\nright to vote (and vice versa). Ohio’s important interests in provisional-voter registration and\nidentification eclipse the small burden of accurately completing the two fields—a burden that\nactually impacts just a few hundred voters each election, an impact wholly in their own control.\n\n       However, we agree with the district court that Ohio has made no such justification for\nmandating technical precision in the address and birthdate fields of the absentee-ballot\nidentification envelope. Although the burden is small for most voters, its impact is greater than\nthat of SB 216, and none of the “precise interests put forward by” Ohio justifies it. Burdick, 504\nU.S. at 434 (citation omitted). Ohio first posits that the perfection requirement hampers “rare[]”\nattempts to cast others’ mail-in absentee ballots.       First Br. 30.     Combatting voter fraud\nperpetrated by mail is undeniably a legitimate concern. See Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 1, 4\n(2006) (per curiam). Yet some level of specificity is necessary to convert that abstraction into a\ndefinite interest for a court to weigh. The district court found that Ohio did not even “offer[]\ncombatting voter fraud” as a relevant interest. Given the lack of any coherent fraud argument\noffered at trial, that conclusion is understandable.\n\n       Moreover, Ohio’s argument collapses under scrutiny. Before SB 205, absentee voters\nhad to clear several hurdles to confirm their identity.          In addition to presenting valid\nidentification, a voter needed the signature on the envelope to match the voter’s registration\nsignature, and even then, the information in the identification envelope could be deemed\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691           Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.            Page 23\n\n\n“insufficient.” Ohio Rev. Code § 3509.07 (2013); see also id. §§ 3509.05–.06, 3511.09. Like all\nother ballots, those of absentee voters could be challenged “for cause.” Id. § 3509.07. Under\nsome circumstances, certain errors in address or birthdate could well constitute “insufficiency.”\nSB 205 altered that provision, requiring boards to reject absentee ballots that do not include an\naccurate address and birthdate for the voter.\n\n        Even Ohio recognizes that the downside of rejecting mail-in absentee ballots for address\nerrors overshadows any concern with address falsification.          Ohio statute allows, and the\nSecretary has instructed, boards of elections to complete the address field on mail-in\nidentification envelopes so that ballots are not thrown out “for th[at] sole reason.” At bottom,\nOhio’s interest revolves around the “rare” instances where a fraudster manages to swipe the\nballot of a registered absentee voter, forge the signature, and return the ballot to the board of\nelections with a copy of the voter’s identification, driver’s license number, or Social Security\nnumber, and would have gotten away scot free but for the troublesome birthdate requirement.\nWhat is more, Ohio does not explain why its interest in preventing voter fraud by mail makes it\n“necessary to burden” the plaintiffs’ voting rights. Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434 (citation omitted).\nBefore SB 205, boards were instructed to strike ballots if the identification envelope contained\n“insufficient” information and had discretion to “challenge” absent voters “for cause.” Ohio\nRev. Code § 3509.07 (2013). That provision gave boards more than sufficient flexibility to\ninvestigate birthdate errors for fraud without the heavy-handed requirement of ballot rejection on\na technicality.\n\n        At trial, the district court was not presented with a shred of evidence of mail-in absentee-\nvoter fraud. That absence of support is corroborated by ample testimony. Halfway through trial,\nthe court held a sidebar where it asked counsel for Ohio whether a fraud argument was “going to\nbe a part of the presentation of . . . [Ohio’s] case in chief, . . . experts, [or] other witnesses.”\nCounsel stated that the court “w[ould] hear testimony” about the interests motivating the passage\nof the bills, including fraud. Not only did that never materialize, but, as is apparent from the\nrecord, there is no indication of a legitimate fraud concern at all. The Assistant Secretary of\nState, responsible for managing statewide elections, affirmed upon cross-examination that the\npossibility of this particular voter fraud is “infinitesimal” and would not have been “an\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691           Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.             Page 24\n\n\nappropriate justification” for SB 205’s perfection requirement.        None of the officials who\ntestified from nearly a quarter of Ohio’s boards of elections were even asked whether requiring\nperfection on the birthdate field would combat mail-in absentee-voter fraud. At the court’s own\nprodding, several answered questions related to fraud. The few who could relate instances of\nfraud identified none relating to the specific interest now asserted. This suggests that the fraud\ninterest does not offset the burden of technical perfection on the identification envelope’s address\nand birthdate fields.\n\n       Ohio also asserts an interest in standardizing its identification-envelope requirements.\nAchieving uniform standards across eighty-eight autonomous county boards of elections is a\ncommendable goal. A court weighing that interest, however, must ask, “Standardization to what\nend?” For example, a standardized ballot may increase public confidence in the integrity of the\nelectoral process. See Crawford, 553 U.S. at 235 (Souter, J., dissenting). According to Ohio,\nSB 205’s perfection requirement “increases efficiency and predictability.” First Br. 32.\n\n       In support, Ohio cites just two pieces of evidence. During his testimony, the Assistant\nSecretary of State stated that before the implementation of SB 205, the birthdate field was “a\nrequired element on the [identification envelope, but] was not a required element for the Board to\ndetermine the validity of the ballot.” Although true, that statement does not address whether that\ndistinction was thought by anyone to make election administration less efficient. Ohio also\npoints to a report of the OAEO advising that requiring mail-in voters to complete the address and\nbirthdate fields, among other measures, would “allow election officials to more efficiently\nprocess mail-in absentee ballots.” However, that document was silent with regard to in-person\nabsentee ballots. Moreover, it was not a recommendation to reject ballots containing technical\nerrors, and so cannot support the argument that a uniform rejection standard increases efficiency.\n\n       Nor does Ohio’s interest in uniformity “make it necessary to burden” the right to vote\nwith a technical-perfection requirement. Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434 (citation omitted). Even\nbefore SB 205, Ohio law instructed boards of elections on the information to include in absentee-\nvoter identification envelopes. See Ohio Rev. Code § 3509.04(B) (2013). It would seem that the\nsimple act of amending that provision to more comprehensively describe the information that\nidentification envelopes should contain would have been a less roundabout way to uniformity—\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691               Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.                       Page 25\n\n\nand would not have needlessly disenfranchised voters. In addition, Ohio publishes a lengthy\nmanual for election officials with extensive instructions on how to apply its statutory election\nprovisions. It includes a “Reasons to Reject an Absentee Ballot” section. Ohio could include\ninstructions explaining the steps that officials should take to positively identify voters before\ndetermining that an identification envelope is sufficient or insufficient. Instead, the legislature\nenacted a measure that forces elections boards to reject some identifiable ballots. We cannot find\nthat Ohio’s stated interests outweigh the burden that the field-perfection requirement places on\nabsentee voters.\n\n        Limit on Poll-Worker Assistance. The burden imposed by demarcating the types of\nassistance that election officials may render voters is minimal. In most cases, poll-worker\nassistance will not fix the errors that result in the rejection of absentee and provisional ballots.\nAs discussed, most rejected provisional ballots were not counted because the applicant was not\nregistered at all or tried to vote in a precinct where her or she was not registered. Domestic\ncivilian absentee ballots were usually rejected just for being submitted late—sixty-three percent\nof rejected ballots in 2014 and over eighty percent in 2015. All voting requirements inevitably\nencumber some people more than others. Yet Ohio specifically ensures that voters at the greatest\nrisk of making mistakes in marking their ballots—blind, disabled, and illiterate individuals—\nreceive help if it is requested. The onus is on the voter to make the request, but that hardly\nimpinges the right to vote. Any burden is borne only by those who can but do not ask for help or\nmake easily avoidable errors in marking their ballots.\n\n        Ohio’s legitimate interest in minimizing election-official mistakes by ensuring that they\nare not overburdened and do not fill in others’ personal information justifies the limitation\nplaced on poll-worker assistance.12 Because Ohio asserts a legitimate interest, this minimally\nburdensome regulation does not amount to an unconstitutional abridgment of the right to vote.\n\n\n\n        12\n            Although not argued by Ohio on appeal, states have an important interest in managing poll-workers’\ninteraction with voters to protect ballot secrecy and prevent coercion. See, e.g., Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. 191,\n206 (1992) (plurality opinion) (“[A]ll 50 States, together with numerous other Western democracies . . . [have] a\nsecret ballot secured in part by a restricted zone around the voting compartments,” which “demonstrates that some\nrestricted zone is necessary in order to serve the States’ compelling interests in preventing voter intimidation and\nelection fraud.”).\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691           Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.            Page 26\n\n\n       Cure-Period Reduction. As discussed, on the basis of the record, reducing from ten to\nseven the number of days for correcting absentee-ballot errors and presenting provisional-ballot\nidentification imposes a trivial burden on Ohio voters. There is no evidence of the magnitude of\nthe burden and at least one board official testified that few voters even used the final three cure-\nperiod days.\n\n       That minimal burden on voting is easily outweighed by Ohio’s interest in reducing the\nadministrative strain felt by boards of elections before they begin to canvass election returns.\nThe official canvass must begin eleven to fifteen days after Election Day. Ohio Rev. Code.\n§ 3505.32(A). The possibility of unforeseeable post-election issues thrust upon boards is a\nlegitimate concern. Building in a three-day buffer between the cure period and the official\ncanvass is a common-sense solution. Although, as the district court noted, none of the board\nofficials who testified indicated that the ten-day cure period inconvenienced them, a state\ncertainly need not wait for an election issue to arise before enacting provisions to avoid it. See\nMunro v. Socialist Workers Party, 479 U.S. 189, 195–96 (1986). Federal law does require that\nvoting equipment give voters the opportunity to correct errors before their ballots are cast and\ncounted. See 52 U.S.C. § 21081(a)(1)(A)(ii) (Supp. II Vol. III 2015). But no case mandates any\nparticular length of time that states must provide after Election Day for voters to cure ballot\nerrors. Given the negligible impact of the cure-period reduction on voters, Ohio’s reasonable\nresponse to a foreseeable problem is not an undue burden.\n\n       B. Lack of Uniform Standards\n\n       A plaintiff may state an equal-protection claim by alleging that lack of statewide\nstandards results in a system that deprives citizens of the right to vote based on where they live.\nLeague of Women Voters of Ohio v. Brunner, 548 F.3d 463, 477–78 (6th Cir. 2008). The district\ncourt rejected the plaintiffs’ argument that the boards of elections used different standards in the\ntwo most recent general elections for determining whether to reject absentee and provisional\nballots that contained errors or omissions. We agree.\n\n       The plaintiffs presented uncontested evidence that, in determining whether to reject a\ngiven ballot, the practices of boards of elections can vary, and sometimes considerably. But that\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691            Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.                Page 27\n\n\ndoes not address the central question in a lack-of-uniform standards claim: whether Ohio lacks\n“adequate statewide standards for determining what is a legal vote.” Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98,\n110 (2000) (per curiam). Arguable differences in how elections boards apply uniform statewide\nstandards to the innumerable permutations of ballot irregularities, although perhaps unfortunate,\nare to be expected, just as judges in sentencing-guidelines cases apply uniform standards with\narguably different results. In fact, that flexibility is part and parcel of the right of “local entities,\nin the exercise of their expertise, [to] develop different systems for implementing elections.” Id.\nat 109. Despite differences in the local application of provisions concerning ballot rejection, the\nelections boards are guided by clear prescriptive statewide rules that apply equally to all voters.\nNor is there any indication that certain categories of provisional or absentee ballots received\n“preferential treatment.” Ne. Ohio Coal. for Homeless v. Husted, 696 F.3d 580, 598 (6th Cir.\n2012); see also Hunter v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Elections, 635 F.3d 219, 236 (6th Cir. 2011).\nThus, the district court correctly concluded that the plaintiffs did not prove arbitrary treatment.\n\n        C. Intentional Discrimination\n\n        Facially neutral laws can be motivated by invidious racial discrimination. Village of\nArlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 266 (1977). Because of the\npossibility that discriminatory intent is an underlying motivation, courts must undertake a\n“sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available.”\nIbid. Challengers need to show only that discriminatory purpose was “a motivating factor,” not\nnecessarily the law’s “dominant” or “primary” purpose. Id. at 265–66.\n\n        In Arlington Heights, the Supreme Court articulated nonexhaustive evidentiary factors to\nconsider in determining whether official action was undertaken with a discriminatory purpose.\nThose factors include:\n\n        “[T]he historical background of the decision, . . . particularly if it reveals a series\n        of official actions taken for invidious purposes”; “the specific sequence of events\n        leading up [to] the challenged decision”; “departures from the normal procedural\n        sequence”; “substantive departures, . . . particularly if the factors usually\n        considered important by the decisionmaker strongly favor a decision contrary to\n        the one reached”; and the “legislative or administrative history, . . . especially\n        where there are contemporary statements by members of the decisionmaking\n        body, minutes of its meetings, or reports.”\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691            Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.          Page 28\n\n\nSpurlock v. Fox, 716 F.3d 383, 397 (6th Cir. 2013) (quoting Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 267–\n68) (alterations omitted).\n\n          The record does not reveal that SB 205 and SB 216 were enacted with discriminatory\nintent.     As discussed, the evidence does not demonstrate that minority voters are\ndisproportionately affected by the provisions.       Nor did the legislature depart from normal\nprocedural practices when it considered the provisions for several months before their passage.\nCf. N.C. State Conference of the NAACP v. McCrory, ___ F.3d ___, Nos. 16-1468, 16-1469, 16-\n1474, 16-1529, 2016 WL 4053033, at *13 (4th Cir. July 29, 2016) (law passed with\ndiscriminatory intent in part due to legislature’s “eagerness,” after Shelby County held\nunconstitutional Section 5’s preclearance requirement, to “rush through the legislative process\nthe most restrictive voting law North Carolina has seen since the era of Jim Crow”). In fact, the\nbasic contours of SB 205 originally appeared in a report of the bipartisan OAEO.\n\n          A racially tinged statement by one legislator who allegedly asked during committee\ndebate whether the General Assembly “should . . . be making it easier for those people who take\nthe bus after church on Sunday to vote” is troubling. Cf. Ohio State Conference, 768 F.3d at 539\n(“African Americans have come to rely on Sunday voting through ‘Souls to the Polls initiatives,’\nin which churches have leveraged the transportation they already provide to and from church to\nbring voters to EIP voting locations.”). But we agree with the district court that on the whole,\nthe record does not show that the General Assembly acted with racial animus.\n\nVI. Due Process\n\n          The Due Process Clause is implicated in “exceptional” cases where a state’s voting\nsystem is “fundamentally unfair.” Warf v. Bd. of Elections, 619 F.3d 553, 559 (6th Cir. 2010)\n(quoting League of Women Voters of Ohio, 548 F.3d at 478). Fundamental unfairness may\noccur, for example, if a state uses non-uniform procedures that result in significant\ndisenfranchisement and vote dilution.

Burns, 570 F.2d 1065, 1076, 1078–79 (1st Cir. 1978). The district court rejected the plaintiffs’\nfundamental-unfairness claim, and we affirm.\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691          Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.            Page 29\n\n\n       As discussed in response to the argument that Ohio’s voting system lacks uniform\nstandards, discrepancies at the margins in how local boards of elections apply statewide\nprovisions is not unusual. Those predictable divergences impact a small number of voters and do\nnot amount to a fundamentally unfair voting system.             Nor do the technical-perfection\nrequirements that SB 205 and SB 216 impose on absentee and provisional voters rise to an\nexceptional level of unfairness comparable to grossly non-uniform procedure or significant voter\ndisenfranchisement.\n\n       We also find unconvincing the appellees’ contention that the district court denied their\nprocedural-due-process claim “without addressing its merits.” Second Br. 75. The district court\nclearly held that the alleged harm was “caused by the portions of SB[] 205 and SB 216 that\nimpose a completion requirement for the five fields, not the lack of process given when a ballot\nis rejected.” Ne. Ohio Coal. for the Homeless v. Husted, No. 2:06-CV-896, 2016 WL 3166251,\nat *43 (S.D. Ohio June 7, 2016) (emphasis added). We therefore dismiss this claim.\n\nVII. Conclusion\n\n       We AFFIRM the entry of judgment for the plaintiffs on their equal-protection undue-\nburden claim as it relates to the requirement that boards of elections reject mail-in and in-person\nabsentee ballots for failure to complete the identification envelope’s address and birthdate fields\nwith technical precision. Therefore, we AFFIRM its permanent injunction of the portions of\nSB 205 that amend Sections 3509.06(D) and 3509.07 of the Ohio Revised Code. See S.B. 205,\n130th Gen. Assemb. (Ohio 2014), at 9–12.\n\n       To be perfectly clear, this remaining injunction does not impede the legitimate interests\nof Ohio election law. The versions of Sections 3509.06(D) and 3509.07 that existed before the\nenactment of SB 205 (and that the injunction effectively reinstates) were altogether serviceable.\nNothing in our opinion prevents election officials from rejecting absentee ballots whose\nidentification envelopes contain “insufficient” information. Ohio Rev. Code. § 3509.07 (2013).\nThe Secretary can and should continue to instruct the boards of elections on implementing those\nprovisions in order to further the interest of uniformity and to provide guidance on the steps\nboards should take to identify absentee voters before deeming an identification envelope\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691            Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v.

But in doing so, it must act to further\nimportant State interests if its proposed changes burden Ohioans’ right to vote.\n\n       We deeply respect the dissent’s recounting of important parts of the racial history of our\ncountry and the struggle for voting rights, and we agree that this history may always be\nappropriately borne in mind.       However, that history does not without more determine the\noutcome of today’s litigation over voting practices and methods. The legal standards we must\nfollow are set out in the cases we discuss concerning the standards embodied in the Fourteenth\nAmendment and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. With respect to the dissent’s discussion\nregarding factual findings, this opinion does not quarrel with the district court over its recitation\nof the record or of any credibility determinations made by the district court. Rather, our holding\nis that the district court’s legal conclusions from that record are in certain parts erroneous, as set\nforth in this opinion, and in light of other parts of the record that the court did not consider.\n\n       For reasons stated, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court on the remaining\nundue-burden claims and the VRA Section 2 claims. We AFFIRM the entry of judgment for\nOhio on all other claims.\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691           Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.

KEITH, concurring in part, dissenting in part. Democracies die behind\nclosed doors. Detroit Free Press v. Ashcroft, 303 F.3d 681, 683 (6th Cir. 2002). By denying the\nmost vulnerable the right to vote, the Majority shuts minorities out of our political process.\nRather than honor the men and women whose murdered lives opened the doors of our democracy\nand secured our right to vote, the Majority has abandoned this court’s standard of review in order\nto conceal the votes of the most defenseless behind the dangerous veneers of factual findings\nlacking support and legal standards lacking precedent. I am deeply saddened and distraught by\nthe court’s deliberate decision to reverse the progress of history. I dissent.\n\n       In 2014, Ohio enacted Senate Bills 205 and 216, which (1) required county elections\nboards to reject the ballots of absentee and provisional voters whose identification envelopes or\naffirmation forms, respectively, contained an address or birthdate that did not exactly match\nvoting records; (2) reduced the number of post-election days for absentee voters to cure\nidentification-envelope errors, and the number of days for provisional voters to present valid\nidentification, from ten days to seven days; and (3) restricted the ways in which poll workers can\nhelp in-person voters. After conducting a twelve-day trial and authoring a 112-page opinion\nbrimming with sound factual findings and legal conclusions, the district court (Judge Algenon L.\nMarbley) justly held that all of the challenged provisions imposed an undue burden on the right\nto vote and violated plaintiffs’ equal protection rights.\n\n       In complete abandonment of the clearly erroneous standard of review, the Majority\ndisplaces several of the district court’s well-reasoned and supported factual findings.        The\nMajority’s decision to gut the factual findings of the district court and to advance legal standards\nwithout precedent in order to shut the most vulnerable out of the political process must be\nsubjected to the natural antiseptic of sunlight. The unfettered right to vote is the bedrock of a\nfree and democratic society—without it, such a society cannot stand. This right is fundamental.\nIt is the most valuable right a person possesses, because without it, all other rights are\nmeaningless. As history has shown time and time again, laymen and jurists alike have actively\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691                 Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.                        Page 32\n\n\nworked to deny the right to vote to minorities, in both obvious and obscure ways. The Voting\nRights Act (“VRA”),1 sought to right this wrong by allowing all citizens—unrestrained—to\nexercise their right to vote regardless of race. While the VRA and Equal Protection Clause\nsought to bring this nation forward, closer to a society free of racial discrimination, today the\nMajority’s opinion takes us several steps back. Because the Majority has completely ignored the\napplicable standard of review and has instead engaged in its own fact finding and reweighing of\nthe evidence in complete disregard for the clearly erroneous standard of review, because the\nMajority has created a legal standard in contradiction to existing case law based on a concurring\nopinion and dictum, and because the Majority has dishonored the struggle for the right of the\nmost vulnerable to vote, I dissent. I would instead affirm the district court in full.\n\n                                                BACKGROUND\n\n         A. Historical Background\n\n                    1. The Martyrdom and Struggle for Equal Protection\n\n         The Majority’s actions must be viewed in full light of their historical context. The\nmurders of countless men and women who struggled for the right to vote and equal protection\ncannot be overlooked. The utter brutality of white supremacy in its efforts to disenfranchise\npersons of color is the foundation for the tragedy that is the Majority’s effort to roll back the\nprogress of history. I will not forget. I cannot forget—indeed America cannot forget—the pain,\nsuffering, and sorrow of those who died for equal protection and for this precious right to vote.\nI add the following publicly available historical statements to humanize the struggle for the right\nto be equal participants in the democratic process. While the Majority aptly notes that these\nhistorical statements do not dictate the outcome of this case, it is imperative that we assess the\nefforts to undermine the right to vote as an historical operative that did not begin with the\nMajority’s opinion and unfortunately will not end with it.2\n\n\n         1\n             52 U.S.C.A. § 10301 et seq.\n         2\n           I give full context to the legal analysis of the issues presented in this case as well as full historical\ncontextualization of the facts. The following pictures and synopses cannot capture the full horror of those who lost\ntheir lives in the quest for equal protection and voting rights. The following is a mere fraction of the martyrs of the\nstruggle for equality. The assaults, rapes, murders, lynching, and utter travesty of the struggle for equality can never\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691               Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v.

The Election of the United States’ First Black President\n\n         Another important historical occurrence that cannot be separated from efforts to abridge\nminorities’ right to vote is the election of the United States’ First Black President. On February\n10, 2007, then-Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, an African American, announced his candidacy\nfor the United States Presidency.54 On November 4, 2008, President Obama became the first\nAfrican-American President of the United States.                    President Obama not only captured the\npresidency, but under his leadership, the Democratic party gained control of the House, the\nSenate and the White House for the first time since 1995.55 On April 4, 2011, President Obama\nannounced his reelection for the presidency.56 On November 6, 2012, President Obama was re-\nelected President of the United States.57\n\n         B. Factual Background\n\n                    1. The Parties58\n\n         Plaintiff, “The Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless” (“NEOCH”), advocates on\nbehalf of the Cleveland homeless, airing and addressing issues related to their lack of housing,\nemployment, and health care.                About seventy percent of NEOCH’s in-person homeless\napplicants are African American.               Promoting voting among its members, and among the\nhomeless county-wide, is central to NEOCH’s mission, and NEOCH’s executive director, staff,\nand volunteers expend substantial resources on voting activities in even-numbered years.\nExecutor Director Brian Davis “spends as much as 80 hours per week around the voting\n\n\n         54\n              Adam Nagourney & Jeff Zeleny, Obama Formally Enters Presidential Race, New York Times, Feb. 11,\n2007.\n         55\n              Id.\n         56\n              Chris Cillizza & Emi Kolawole, President Obama Announces Reelection Bid, Washington Post, April 4,\n2011.\n         57\n              David A. Fahrenthold, Obama Reelected As President, Washington Post, November 7, 2012.\n         58\n            The following facts are taken from the district court opinion. Ohio Coal. for the Homeless v. Husted, No.\n2:06-CV-896, 2016 WL 3166251, at *1 (S.D. Ohio June 7, 2016). As stated infra, the Majority has failed to\nestablish that any of the district court’s factual findings are clearly erroneous. By way of reference, I incorporate all\nof the district court’s factual findings in this dissent. I have highlighted many of those findings here; however, I\ndirect attention in particular to the district court’s finding regarding the Senate Factors, which I also incorporate\nherein. Husted, 2016 WL 3166251, at *24-32.\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691           Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.             Page 45\n\n\nregistration deadline on such activities, and one part-time NEOCH staff person devotes 20 hours\nper week to early voting turnout efforts.” Because of the challenged laws, NEOCH would “no\nlonger provide blank cards to its members to vote by mail, but will instead focus [on] . . . driving\npeople to the polls to vote, which will divert drivers and vehicles from doing other work on\nbehalf of the organization . . . .” This will also require more financial resources.\n\n       In describing the impact of the loss of voting to the NEOCH constituency, the district\ncourt made the following findings of fact:\n\n       Were NEOCH’s members unable to vote, their bargaining power vis-à-vis elected\n       officials would be diminished, which would in turn diminish NEOCH’s\n       effectiveness at advocating on their behalf, frustrating its mission and exposing an\n       already vulnerable population to further governmental neglect. The homeless\n       constituents of NEOCH and CCH face challenges that hinder them from asserting\n       their own rights, including mental illness and/or addiction, difficulty maintaining\n       a regular address or phone number, limited access to transportation, and illiteracy\n       or lack of education. They also find it challenging to gain entrance to courtrooms\n       and public buildings due to lack of ID, and many homeless people have a negative\n       relationship with the judicial system or hesitate to get involved in litigation to\n       assert their rights because they are more focused on meeting their immediate\n       needs.\n\nHusted, 2016 WL 3166251, at *7 (citations omitted).\n\n       Of the NEOCH homeless members who have voted in primary elections, about eight vote\nin the Democratic primary for each one who votes in the Republican primary. Id. In describing\nthe impact of SB 205 and SB 216, the district court made the following findings of fact:\n\n       [E]ight to ten percent of those living in shelters across Cuyahoga County are\n       absolutely illiterate, and the majority read at only a fourth-grade level. Davis\n       feared that the complexity of the form, along with SB 205’s provisions\n       demanding that voters fill out the required fields completely and accurately . . .\n       increased the risk of NEOCH’s members being disenfranchised. In his twenty\n       years working with the homeless, Davis has noticed that homeless persons have\n       pervasive and profound problems filling out the forms. Not being able to read or\n       fill out forms correctly is embarrassing and humiliating for many of NEOCH’s\n       members, and they hesitate to ask for help. NEOCH’s practice with other\n       government forms, such as those relating to Social Security disability and\n       Medicaid benefits, is to read the forms aloud and fill them out on the homeless\n       person’s behalf as a matter of course.\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691            Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.                 Page 46\n\n\nHusted, 2016 WL 3166251, at *7 (citations omitted).\n\n        Plaintiff, Columbus Coalition for the Homeless (“CCH”), advocates for homeless people\nin Columbus. Sixty percent of homeless people in shelters in Columbus are African American.\nBecause of the challenged laws, CCH will explain new voting requirements to homeless persons\nat meetings, publishing articles about the requirements, and train its members to educate other\nhomeless persons.\n\n        Plaintiff, Ohio Democratic Party (“ODP”), is a political party consisting of 1.2 million\nmembers; it seeks to advance the interests of the Democratic Party.59\n\n        Defendant Secretary of the State of Ohio functions as Ohio’s chief election officer. Ohio\nRev. Code §§ 3501.04, 3501.05. The State of Ohio is an Intervenor.\n\n                2. Voting in Ohio\n\n        Absentee Voting. Since 2006, all registered voters have the option to vote absentee\nwithout any excuse. To receive an absentee ballot, a voter must provide to the Board of the\ncounty in which he or she will vote an application consisting of: (1) the voter’s driver’s license\nnumber; (2) the voter’s last four digits of their social security number (“SSN-4”); and (3) an\napproved form of identification. If these requirements are met, the voter receives an absentee\nballot; if these requirements are not met, the voter is notified of the deficiency.\n\n        A voter may do “in-person absentee voting”—i.e., vote in-person at their county Board\nduring certain days and hours—or, “mail-in absentee voting.” When mailing the form to the\nBoard, the voter must sign and include in the envelope an affirmation declaring the voter is\neligible to vote, and if the voter did not provide a driver’s license number or SSN-4, the voter\nmust provide an acceptable form of identification or current state or federal documents that show\nthe name and address of the voter. If there is an error in any of the five fields, the Board mails a\nForm 11-S, specifying the type of error and informing the voter that the ballot will not be\ncounted unless certain steps are taken—namely, returning the Form 11-S by a certain time.\n\n\n        59\n        The Service Employees International Union (“SEIU”) is also a plaintiff in this matter. SEIU joined\nNEOCH in initiating the original action against the Secretary in 2006.\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691            Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.              Page 47\n\n\n        Provisional Voting. Voters who cannot confirm eligibility—and so cannot cast a regular\nballot—can complete a provisional ballot. This allows the voter to cast provisionally, “subject to\nlater verification.” This type of voting is available to several categories of voters.\n\n            3. Challenged Laws\n\n            SB 205 - changes to absentee voting procedures\n\n        SB 205 mandates that an ID envelope is considered incomplete if the voter does not fill\nout the five fields of required information (“five-fields requirement”): (1) name; (2) residence\naddress; (3) date of birth; (4) signature; and (5) some form of ID, which includes the types of\nacceptable ID required for the absentee ballot application form. If these requirements are not\nmet, the voter will receive a written notice informing them of the nature of the defect and that\nfurther information must be provided for the ballot to be counted. Before enactment of SB 205,\nthe information contained in the five fields was merely requested, not required. Pursuant to SB\n205, if the information is missing, the ballot “shall not be counted.”\n\n        The information must be provided no later than the seventh day after the election. This\nopportunity to cure—i.e., “cure period”—was longer before the enactment of SB 205; voters had\nten days rather than seven days to furnish the information.\n\n        SB 216 - changes to provisional voting procedures\n\n        Before enactment of SB 216, voters were required to provide only their names, IDs, and\nsignatures in the provisional ballot affirmation form. Pursuant to SB 216, provisional voters\nmust also provide the date of birth and current address. SB 216 also requires voters to print their\nnames on the provisional ballot envelope. Section 3505.182(F) of the provision already imposed\na “completeness requirement.” Section 3505.181(F) provides that persons filling out provisional\nballots may receive help, but only if they declare to an election official that they are unable to fill\nout the ballot due to blindness, disability, or illiteracy.\n\n                4. The Lead-Up to SB 205 and SB 216\n\n        Following the 2010 election, control of the Ohio House of Representatives switched from\nthe Democratic to the Republican Party. “Rather quickly” after that change in leadership, House\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691           Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.             Page 48\n\n\nRepublicans introduced two bills: (1) a bill to require all Ohioans to show a photo ID when\nvoting and (2) House Bill 194 (“HB 194”), an expansive election-law bill that included “a\nnumber of restrictions on voting, including the restrictions that we see in [SBs 205 and 216].”\nRepresentative Kathleen Clyde, Ohio General Assemblyperson, testified that the debate over HB\n194 was “very partisan and hostile” and “very quick.” HB 194 was ready for the Governor’s\nsignature within two months of its introduction, which Representative Clyde testified marks a\nsignificantly shorter time period than usual for the passage of legislation of such complexity.\nHusted, 2016 WL 3166251, at *13.\n\n       In August 2012, in an unprecedented move, the Ohio legislature voted to repeal HB 194\nafter hundreds of thousands of Ohioans signed petitions to place it on the ballot for a statewide\nreferendum in November 2012. Sixteen other bills proposing voting restrictions were introduced\nin the 2013-2014 General Assembly, eight of which passed. One bill was passed to shorten the\nwindow to gather signatures for referenda, which made it more difficult for citizens to put a\nreferendum on the ballot. Another bill was passed making it easier to purge voters from the\nregistration rolls. Senate Bill 238, which eliminated the first week of the early voting period,\nalso was enacted. Other bills were introduced, but not passed, which would have limited voting\nin the following ways: shortening the early voting period to 14 days; eliminating early voting\nhours; limiting the mailing of absentee ballot applications to voters and preventing the paying of\nreturn postage on absentee ballot envelopes; instituting a photo-ID requirement; and requiring\nstate universities to provide in-state tuition rates to students if they provided those students with\nID that they needed to vote.\n\n       None of the proponents of SB 205 cited voter fraud as a justification for the bill. Husted,\n2016 WL 3166251, at *13. During the floor debate of SB 205, in contrast to most proposed\nlegislation, there was no data or testimony offered about the need for the measures proposed in\nSB 205. Id. During committee debate, Representative Matt Huffman, speaking in favor of SB\n205, asked “should we really be making it easier for those people who take the bus after church\non Sunday to vote.” Id. With respect to both SB 205 and SB 216, Democratic legislators spoke\nabout their concerns that the provisional and absentee ballots of African-American voters would\nbe thrown out disproportionately. Id. at *14.\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691            Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.            Page 49\n\n\n       As to the cure period, one Board official testified that before the challenged laws went\ninto effect, voters did come in during the eighth, ninth, and tenth days of the cure period to cure\ntheir provisional and absentee ballots. Because the Board can receive absentee ballots up until\nten days after Election Day, yet the cure period is only seven days, some voters to whom the\nBoard sends a Form 11-S notifying them of their need to cure their ballot will not receive it in\ntime to do so. Id. at *17.\n\n               5. Information Requirements\n\n       The vast majority of NEOCH’s individual homeless members plan to participate in the\n2016 general election. Many of CCH’s members also plan to vote. Many of the organization’s\nmembers are illiterate, barely literate, and/or mentally ill. A CHH witness testified that without\nassistance, a homeless person could not complete the entire form and that due to the complexity\nand amount of print on the form, some homeless people would just tear it up and say, “you\nknow, to hell with it.” Forms that are, in the words of one Board official, “pretty complex,” with\n“a lot of wording, a lot of stuff crammed into” them, can confuse even educated, literate voters.\n\n               6. Prohibition Against Poll-Worker Assistance\n\n       The district court found that the prohibition against poll-worker assistance burdens\npersons with low literacy, particularly if they are embarrassed to reveal their illiteracy due to the\nstigma it entails. Plaintiffs introduced ample evidence that many of their members fall into this\ncategory and that illiteracy or low literacy levels are prevalent among the homeless. Homeless\nvoters suffer disproportionately from disabilities, including mental illness, which can also\nhamper their ability to fill out forms. About a third of the homeless individuals with whom\nNEOCH works have a mental disability, forty-five to fifty percent read at a fourth-grade level,\nand eight to ten percent are completely illiterate. They may write poorly and have handwriting\nthat is difficult to read or, due to mental illness, they struggle to focus on basic tasks without\nhelp. All of these issues combine to create difficulties for homeless voters in filling out forms\nwithout assistance like the absentee ID envelope and the provisional ballot affirmation.\nMoreover, NEOCH Executive Director Brian Davis testified that in his experience with voter\nmobilization of homeless people in 2014, Board staff members were more hesitant to engage\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691           Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.             Page 50\n\n\nwith voters and offer help when it appeared to be necessary and that homeless voters have been\nmore likely to make mistakes because of the lack of help. Secretary Husted failed to conduct any\nreview or testing of the effect of the provisional ballot affirmation or the absentee identification\nenvelope on voters with low literacy, despite a suggestion to do so from the League of Women\nVoters.     In sum, the district court concluded that many homeless people face vexing and\nprofound obstacles in exercising the basic right to vote, and the prohibition against poll-worker\nassistance is likely to exacerbate the problem.\n\n                                                  ANALYSIS\n\n          A. The Majority Applies the Wrong Standard of Review for Factual Findings\n\n          By applying the wrong standard of review, the Majority abandons its role as a court of\nappellate review and plays the role of the trier of fact. I cannot join this flawed approach.\n\n          “On an appeal from a judgment entered after a bench trial, [this court] review[s] the\ndistrict court’s . . . conclusions of law de novo.” Lindstrom v. A-C Prod. Liab. Trust, 424 F.3d\n488, 492 (6th Cir. 2005). “Mixed questions of law and fact are also subject to de novo review.”\nT. Marzetti Co. v. Roskam Baking Co., 680 F.3d 629, 633 (6th Cir. 2012) (citing Thoroughbred\nSoftware Int’l, Inc. v. Dice Corp., 488 F.3d 352, 358 (6th Cir. 2007)). A district court’s findings\nof fact are reviewed for clear error. Lindstrom, 424 F.3d at 492. “A finding of fact will only be\nclearly erroneous when, although there may be some evidence to support the finding, ‘the\nreviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake\nhas been committed.’” Roskam Baking Co., 680 F.3d at 633 (quoting United States v. Darwich,\n337 F.3d 645, 663 (6th Cir. 2003)). “If the district court’s account of the evidence is plausible in\nlight of the entire record, this court may not reverse that accounting, even if convinced that, had\nit been sitting as trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.” Id. (quoting\nHarlamert v. World Finer Foods, Inc., 489 F.3d 767, 771 (6th Cir. 2007)). “This is so even\nwhen the district court’s findings do not rest on credibility determinations, but are based instead\non physical or documentary evidence or inferences from other facts.” Id. (quoting Anderson v.\nCity of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 574 (1985)).\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691          Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.            Page 51\n\n\n       “In reviewing factual findings for clear error, ‘the reviewing court must give due regard\nto the trial court’s opportunity to judge the witnesses’ credibility.’” Calloway v. Caraco Pharm.\nLabs., Ltd., 800 F.3d 244, 251 (6th Cir. 2015) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(6)). “[This court]\ncannot find that the district court committed clear error where there are two permissible views of\nthe evidence, even if we would have weighed the evidence differently.” Id. (quoting King v.\nZamiara, 680 F.3d 686, 694 (6th Cir. 2012)).\n\n       Here, the district court took great lengths to make well reasoned and supported factual\nfindings. Indeed, the district court’s findings of facts were the product of several years of\nlitigation and a twelve-day bench trial. The findings alone span over fifty pages in length. The\nfindings are supported by statistical, empirical, and testimonial evidence after research was\nconducted regarding thousands of voters over several years of voting cycles. These findings of\nfact are critical to analyzing the claims brought pursuant to the Voting Rights Act and the Equal\nProtection Clause. Some of the most relevant findings of the district court are as follows:\n\n              Across all even-numbered election years, minorities use provisional\n               ballots more often than whites, and in presidential election years, the\n               absentee ballots and provisional ballots of minority voters are more likely\n               to be rejected than those of white voters.\n              African-Americans were hindered from participating in the political\n               process.\n              Ohio has a history of racially discriminating voting laws.\n              Racially polarized voting in Ohio is extensive.\n              There are racialized appeals in politics.\n              African-Americans are still not represented well in the most important and\n               visible elected statewide posts.\n              There is a lack of responsiveness to the particularized needs of African-\n               American voters.\n\n       Yet, the Majority largely ignores these findings and instead applies a de novo standard of\nreview. While the Majority asserts that it is not applying a de novo standard of review, careful\nreview of the Majority opinion reveals that it indeed does. For instance, the Majority took note\nof the district court’s conclusion that “African-American voters are more likely than white voters\nto have their absentee or provisional ballots rejected.” “A district court’s conclusion that a\nchallenged electoral practice has discriminatory effect is a question of fact subject to review for\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691                Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.                         Page 52\n\n\nclear error.” Ortiz v. City of Philadelphia Office of City Com’rs Voter Registration, 28 F.3d 306,\n308-09 (3rd Cir. 1994) (citing Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 79 (1986)). Yet, the Majority\ndisagreed with this factual finding merely because it sees the record differently. The Majority\nfails to demonstrate (or even assert) that the district court’s factual findings are not “plausible in\nlight of the entire record.” See Roskam Baking Co., 680 F.3d at 633 (“If the district court’s\naccount of the evidence is plausible in light of the entire record, this court may not reverse that\naccounting, even if convinced that, had it been sitting as trier of fact, it would have weighed the\nevidence differently.”) (emphasis added). The Majority did exactly what the Supreme Court has\nrepeatedly said we cannot do, “reverse the finding of the trier of fact simply because it . . . would\nhave decided the case differently.” See Anderson, 470 U.S. at 573. The clear error standard of\nreview “plainly does not entitle a reviewing court to reverse the finding of the trier of fact simply\nbecause it is convinced that it would have decided the case differently.” Id. We must be mindful\nthat because we are a court of appellate review, we do not decide factual issues de novo. See id.\n“Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder’s choice between them\ncannot be clearly erroneous.”60 Id. at 574.\n\n         Because the standard of review is the lens through which courts analyze a particular\nissue, the Majority’s application of the incorrect standard infects its entire analysis. I cannot join\nthe Majority in its blatant disregard for the standards that guide this court.\n\n         B. Because the Majority applied the wrong standard of review – engaging in a de\n            novo review of the facts – and because the district court did not clearly err in\n            finding that SB 205 and 216 disparately impacted African American voters, the\n            district court’s findings of fact and legal conclusions on Plaintiffs’ VRA claims\n            should be affirmed.\n\n         The Supreme Court has instructed that the Voting Rights Act “should be interpreted in a\nmanner that provides ‘the broadest possible scope’ in combating racial discrimination.” Chisom\n\n         60\n           Clear error review also applies “to the district court’s finding that the [regulations impose] . . . a burden\non African Americans’ right to vote in Ohio.” Ohio Democratic Party v. Husted, No. 16-3561, 2016 WL 4437605,\nat *17 (6th Cir. Aug. 23, 2016) (Stranch, J., dissenting) (citing OFA v. Husted, 697 F.3d 423, 431 (6th Cir. 2012)\n(concluding that the district court did not clearly err in finding that “early voters, who have disproportionately lower\nincomes and less education than election day voters,” were burdened by challenged regulation)). Here, the district\ncourt concluded that “demanding perfect, or near-perfect, adherence to the five-field requirement on ballots imposes\na significant burden for homeless voters, who are some of society’s most vulnerable members.” This conclusion\nshould not be disturbed absent clear error.\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691           Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.           Page 53\n\n\nv. Roemer, 501 U.S. 380, 403 (1991) (quoting Allen v. State Bd. of Elections, 393 U.S. 544, 567\n(1969)). In vote-denial cases, courts conduct a two-part analysis. See League of Women Voters\nof N.C. v. North Carolina, 769 F.3d 224, 240 (4th Cir. 2014). First, a court determines whether a\npractice or procedure has a disparate impact on a minority group. See Thornburg v. Gingles,\n478 U.S. 30, 44 (1986). Second, if it finds disparate impact, the court assesses whether the\n“electoral law, practice, or structure interacts with social and historical conditions to cause an\ninequality in the opportunities enjoyed by black and white voters to elect their preferred\nrepresentatives.” Id. at 47.      In applying the test, the court considers “the totality of\ncircumstances.” 52 U.S.C. § 10301(b).\n\n               1. Disparate Impact\n\n       Here, the district court did not commit clear error in finding “SB 205 and SB 216 have a\ndisproportionate impact on African-American voters in Ohio, creating greater risk of\ndisenfranchisement of African-Americans than whites.” Husted, 2016 WL 3166251, at *47.\nThe district court further concluded that “[t]he burdens imposed on voters by the five-field\nrequirement, the prohibition on poll-worker assistance, and the reduced cure period fall more\nheavily on African-Americans than whites.” Id.\n\n       The Majority contravenes a clearly erroneous standard of review by reweighing and\nreassessing the evidence to reach the conclusion that African American’s are not disparately\nimpacted by the new legislation. After years of litigation, a twelve-day trial, and painstakingly\ncombing the record, the district court found that Dr. Timberlake’s data on disparities in\nprovisional and absentee ballot usage and rejection rates reveal that higher minority population\nshare is correlated to higher rates of absentee ballot rejection and provisional ballot usage and\nrejection. Husted, 2016 WL 3166251, at *47. In support of its conclusion, the district court\ncited the following findings of fact:\n\n       [T]he Court credits Dr. Timberlake’s findings that: (1) in the presidential election\n       years of 2008 and 2012, where minority turnout was higher than during typical\n       midterm elections, minorities’ absentee ballots were rejected at a higher rate than\n       whites’; (2) in 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014, minorities cast provisional ballots at a\n       higher rate than whites; [This finding is also corroborated by studies upon which\n       Dr. Timberlake relied that showed that African-American voters use provisional\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691            Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.            Page 54\n\n\n        ballots at a higher rate than white voters nationwide. (See Timberlake Rebuttal\n        Rpt., P-1195 at PTF-243.)] and (3) in 2008, 2010, and 2012, minorities had\n        higher rates of rejection of provisional ballots than whites.\n\nHusted, 2016 WL 3166251, at *48 (emphasis added).\n\n        The district court therefore concluded that “because of the passage of the challenged\nlaws, African-American voters are more likely than white voters to have their absentee or\nprovisional ballots rejected.”     Id.   Despite the district court’s well-reasoned findings, the\nMajority reinterprets and reweighs the evidence to conclude that Dr. Timberlake’s findings do\nnot support the conclusion that minorities are disparately impacted by the challenged laws.\n\n        In so doing, the Majority makes much of the decrease in the use of absentee ballots in the\n2012 and 2014 elections. However, again the Majority avers where the district court directly\naddressed the argument in a manner that was not clearly erroneous. Totally disregarding the\ndistrict court’s factual determinations and explanations, the Majority discounts the district court’s\nexplanation for the decrease in absentee ballots:         “Plaintiffs presented evidence that the\ngubernatorial election was significantly less competitive in 2014 than in 2010, that overall\nturnout was lower in 2014 than 2010. Husted, 2016 WL 3166251, at *48. Given this plausible\nexplanation, the district court did not clearly err.\n\n        Further, under either standard of review, the Majority’s analysis still falls short. The\nMajority’s reasons for rejecting the district court’s factual findings are unavailing because the\nreasons suffer from at least three major analytical flaws. First, the Majority misinterprets the\nevidence. Second, the Majority fails to apply a totality of the circumstances standard. Third, the\nMajority errs in its conclusion regarding the undue burden.\n\n        First, the Majority misinterprets the evidence. For example, the Majority reasons as\nfollows:\n\n        [T]here is scant evidence in the record that minority voters are more likely to cast\n        absentee ballots than white voters. It would therefore be illogical to infer that\n        rejecting absentee ballots for failure to accurately complete address and birthdate\n        fields disproportionately affects minority voters without some other evidence that\n        minority voters are less likely to fulfill that requirement. And . . . the vast\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691            Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.               Page 55\n\n\n       majority of absentee-ballot rejections are for reasons other than those challenged\n       here.\n\n       By relying on the “scant evidence” that minority voters are more likely to cast absentee\nballots than white voters, the Majority again misses the mark. While evidence that minorities\navail of a voting practice more frequently than whites can support a Section 2 claim, it is not a\nnecessary component for such a claim; minority voters may only show that they are more likely\nto have their ballots rejected than white voters because of the new requirements, which means\nthey have “less opportunity than” white voters to exercise their right to vote. See Chisom,\n501 U.S. at 395.\n\n       Second, the Majority applies the wrong legal test by considering the impact of each\nindividual legislative change, rather than considering the disproportionate impact that the new\nOhio voting requirements have on minorities as a whole. The Majority engages in a piecemeal\nfreeze frame approach to the evidence finding that each new requirement alone in a vacuum does\nnot meet the standard for disparate impact. Even faced with evidence that minority absentee\nballots are rejected more frequently than white absentee ballots, the Majority asserts that this\ndistinction means nothing unless there is “some other evidence” that minority voters are less\nlikely to correctly fill out the birthdate and address requirements. The Majority’s requirement\nthat the plaintiff must establish the disproportionate impact of each requirement imposes too\ngreat a burden. This approach does not comport with Section 2’s mandate to consider the\n“totality of the circumstances.” Indeed, at least one circuit has cautioned against the very\napproach the Majority takes here. See League of Women Voters of North Carolina v. North\nCarolina, 769 F.3d 224, 245 (4th Cir. 2014).\n\n       In League of Women Voters, the challenged house bill contained several new “electoral\nmechanisms.”       Id. at 242.    That house bill, among other things, “imposed strict voter\nidentification requirements, cut a week off of early voting, prohibited local election boards from\nkeeping the polls open on the final Saturday afternoon before elections, and eliminated same-day\nvoter registration.” Id. at 228. The district court analyzed each challenged electoral mechanism\nseparately. Id. at 242. But the Fourth Circuit criticized the district court for “inspecting the parts\nof [the] [bill] as if they existed in a vacuum.” Id. at 242. Specifically, the district court “failed to\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691             Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.               Page 56\n\n\nconsider the sum of those parts and their cumulative effect on minority access to the ballot box.”\nId.   “Doing so is hard to square with Section 2’s mandate to look at the ‘totality of\ncircumstances.’” Id. (emphasis added) (quoting 52 U.S.C. § 10301(b)). We should be mindful\nthat “a panoply of regulations, each apparently defensible when considered alone, nevertheless\nhave the combined effect of severely restricting participation . . . .” Id. (quoting Clingman v.\nBeaver, 544 U.S. 581, 607–08 (2005) (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in the\njudgment)).      The Majority’s approach creates the incentive for state legislatures to pass\nnumerous electoral mechanisms so that courts are forced to put on blinders when it comes to\nunderstanding the combined effect of these mechanisms.\n\n          Third, the Majority errs in its conclusion regarding the undue burden. The Majority\nstates that no undue burden exists because there was no evidence that voters received additional\npoll-worker assistance before the new requirements. However, disparate impact does not require\nsuch exact mathematical quantification. It is enough that there is a high likelihood of such\nassistance being needed given the interplay of structural inequalities with the challenged\nprovisions as the district court correctly found under the governing standard. The Majority has\nnot and cannot cite any legal precedent for such exacting standards, numbers, or data—nor\nshould any be required. The Majority acknowledges that race is not recorded on ballots, but uses\nthis absence of required information to make the self-invalidating argument that finding racial\nimpact is impossible. This deft maneuver again contravenes the standard of review. Such\nreasoning and stealth of hand sets a very dangerous precedent.\n\n          I, therefore, dissent from the Majority’s finding that the district court erred in finding that\nthe Plaintiffs satisfied the first prong of their vote denial claim—disparate impact—and would\naffirm.\n\n                 2. Social and Historical Conditions\n\n          Furthermore, the district court’s findings of fact with respect to the second prong—social\nand historical conditions—were a product of the district court’s careful application of the so-\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691               Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.                       Page 57\n\n\ncalled “Senate” factors or “Gingles” factors.61 The factors from Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S.\n30, 79 (1986) “might be probative” of a Section 2 violation. See Michigan State A. Philip\nRandolph Inst. v. Johnson, No. 16-2071, 2016 WL 4376429, at *7 (6th Cir. Aug. 17, 2016). The\nfactors include:\n\n                 (1.) the extent of any history of official discrimination in the state\n                 or political subdivision that touched the right of the members of\n                 the minority group to register, to vote, or otherwise to participate\n                 in the democratic process;\n                 (2.) the extent to which voting in the elections of the state or\n                 political subdivision is racially polarized;\n                 (3.) the extent to which the state or political subdivision has used\n                 unusually large election districts, majority vote requirements, anti-\n                 single shot provisions, or other voting practices or procedures that\n                 may enhance the opportunity for discrimination against the\n                 minority group;\n                 (4.) if there is a candidate slating process, whether the members of\n                 the minority group have been denied access to that process;\n                 (5.) the extent to which members of the minority group in the state\n                 or political subdivision bear the effects of discrimination in such\n                 areas as education, employment and health, which hinder their\n                 ability to participate effectively in the political process;\n                 (6.) whether political campaigns have been characterized by overt\n                 or subtle racial appeals;\n                 (7.) the extent to which members of the minority group have been\n                 elected to public office in the jurisdiction;\n                 (8.) whether there is a significant lack of responsiveness on the part\n                 of elected officials to the particularized needs of the members of\n                 the minority group; and\n                 (9.) whether the policy underlying the state or political\n                 subdivision’s use of such voting qualification, prerequisite to\n                 voting, or standard, practice or procedure is tenuous.\n\n        61\n           “[T]he Supreme Court has also endorsed factors (“the Gingles factors”) enunciated by Congress to\ndetermine whether [disparate] impact is a product of current or historical conditions of discrimination such that it\nviolates Section 2.” Veasey v. Abbott, No. 14-41127, 2016 WL 3923868, at *17 (5th Cir. July 20, 2016); see also\nMichigan State A. Philip Randolph Inst. v. Johnson, No. 16-2071, 2016 WL 4376429, at *13, n.2 (6th Cir. Aug. 17,\n2016).\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691             Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.           Page 58\n\n\nSee Gingles, 478 U.S. at 36–37. The district court made findings on all but the fourth factor.\nI summarize below.\n\n       Analyzing factors one and three together, the district court noted the strong history of\n“Ohio’s racially discriminatory voting laws.” Although the district court noted the history of\nOhio’s racially discriminatory voting practices from several decades ago, it also discussed recent\ndiscriminatory bills passed after the 2008 election.\n\n       As to the second factor, the district court noted that exit polls from Ohio voters in the\n2012 presidential election suggest significant and substantial patterns of racially polarized\nvoting. “Approximately, 41% of white voters and 96% of African-Americans reported voting for\nPresident Barack Obama—an enormous differential.”\n\n       As to the fifth Senate factor, the district court noted the barriers faced by African\nAmericans to participation in the political process. Indeed, the district court noted that persistent\nlevels of discrimination faced by African Americans in “employment, housing, income,\neducation and health.”\n\n       As for factor six, the district court found that there are racialized appeals in politics in\nOhio. Such appeals “serve to discourage or dissuade minority voters and prospective candidates\nby reinforcing the message that they simply do not belong in the political process and/or by\nmobilizing white voters in a particular direction by playing on insidious, sometimes explicit and\nsometimes implicit, stereotypes.”        The district court further cited as examples racialized\nstatements made by public officials and referred to disparaging commercials.\n\n       Nor was the district court convinced that there was minority representation in Ohio\n(factor seven). As an example, no African American presently holds the position of Governor,\nLieutenant Governor, Attorney General, Auditor, Secretary of State, and State Treasurer.\nAfrican Americans have occupied each of these positions only five times in the history of the\nState. Until recently, and for the first time in sixty years, the Governor’s twenty-six-person\ncabinet was entirely white.\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691             Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.            Page 59\n\n\n          As to factor eight, the district court found that not many of the “socioeconomic disparities\nhave improved in recent years,” demonstrating Ohio’s lack of responsiveness to the\nparticularized needs of African-American Ohioans. Disparities in unemployment have remained\nsteady as well. Finally, as to factor nine, the district court found that Ohio’s primary justification\nfor the challenged laws at issue is that the they improve “election administration,” but those\njustifications were tenuous.\n\n          Because Ohio does not challenge any of the district court’s factual findings pursuant to\nGingles on appeal, those factual findings are binding on this panel. McElwee v. Wharton, 7 F.\nApp’x 437, 438 (6th Cir. 2001) (“The district court’s unchallenged factual findings . . . are\nbinding on this Court.”) (per curiam); see also Shields v. Reader’s Digest Ass’n, Inc., 331 F.3d\n536, 542 (6th Cir. 2003) (“[B]ecause [the] [p]laintiff has not directly challenged the district\ncourt’s factual conclusions . . . all factual controversies are deemed abandoned on appeal and the\ndistrict court’s factual findings are hereby upheld.”).\n\n          While the Majority never reaches the issue because it holds that Plaintiffs’ Section 2\nclaim fails in its infancy, a careful review of the district court’s factual findings pursuant to\nGingles reveals that the challenged practice is “caused by or linked to ‘social and historical\nconditions’ that have or currently produce discrimination against members of the protected\nclass.”    See Michigan State A. Philip Randolph Inst. v. Johnson, No. 16-2071, 2016 WL\n4376429, at *7 (6th Cir. Aug. 17, 2016) (“The essence of a § 2 claim is that a certain electoral\nlaw, practice, or structure interacts with social and historical conditions to cause an inequality in\nthe opportunities enjoyed by black and white voters to elect their preferred representatives.”\n(quoting Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 47 (1986))). Accordingly, I would affirm the\ndistrict court’s holding with respect to the Section 2 Voting Rights Act claim.\n\n          Furthermore, I would affirm the district court’s findings with respect to both prongs of\nthe vote denial claims as they apply to the restrictions on poll workers and the reduced time to\ncure. In support of its findings of vote denial on the poll worker restrictions and the reduced\ntime to cure, the district court stated the following:\n\n          Because low literacy levels are also correlated with substandard education\n          (Timberlake Tr., Vol. 5 at 73), and the Court has credited Dr. Timberlake’s\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691            Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.          Page 60\n\n\n       findings that African-Americans suffer from lower educational attainment than\n       whites in Ohio, the Court concludes that African-Americans would also suffer\n       from higher costs associated with the five-field requirement and the prohibition\n       on poll-worker assistance because they would face disproportionately more\n       challenges filling out the forms. Because African-Americans move more\n       frequently than whites, they may be more likely to be forced to vote provisionally.\n       (Id. at 67-68; see also Hood Tr., Vol. 10 at 121, 124.) They are also more likely\n       to be homeless. (Davis Tr., Vol. 4 at 186.) And because they are more likely to\n       have inflexible schedules or lack access to a car, they are more likely to be\n       burdened by a shorter cure period for absentee and provisional ballots.\n       (Timberlake Tr., Vol. 5 at 61-62.) All of these effects of discrimination against\n       African-Americans combine to create an inequality in their opportunities to\n       participate in the political process.\n\nHusted, 2016 WL 3166251, at *52.\n\n       Given these structural inequalities and the impact of the poll worker restrictions and the\nshortened cure period, the district court did not clearly err.\n\n       C. The Majority Fundamentally Misunderstands the Concept of Disparate Impact\n\n       Additionally, the Majority fundamentally misunderstands the concept of disparate\nimpact. A particular practice has a disparate impact on persons of a protected class when that\npractice has a “disproportionate” impact on the members of the protected class. See, e.g.,\nAlexander v. Local 496, Laborers’ Intern. Union, 177 F.3d 394, 419 (6th Cir. 1999) (“In a so-\ncalled ‘disparate impact’ case, the plaintiffs need not prove that the defendant intended to\ndiscriminate; instead, plaintiffs must prove that a particular [] practice, although neutral on its\nface, has caused a disproportionate adverse effect on a protected group.”) (emphasis added);\nChrisner v. Complete Auto Transit, Inc., 645 F.2d 1251, 1257 (6th Cir. 1981).\n\n       In some instances, after simply counting the number of persons affected by the new Ohio\nvoter identification laws, without making any comparisons between minority and non-minority\nvoters to assess the disproportionality of those numbers, the Majority concludes that the voting\npractices in Ohio do not have a disparate impact because only a small number of voters are\naffected by the new laws. Disproportionality, by definition, requires assessing racial disparities.\nSee Alexander, 177 F.3d at 419 (noting that “statistical evidence is not absolutely essential in\nproving a disparate impact case,” but there “must be proof of disparity using the proper standards\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691                Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.                       Page 61\n\n\nof comparison”). By relying on the sheer number of voters affected by the law in isolation,\nwithout making any relevant comparisons, the Majority fails to engage in any disparate impact\nanalysis at all. The Majority merely engaged in a counting exercise that gets us nowhere in\nterms of analyzing the discriminatory impact of a rule or practice.\n\n         Next, the Majority concludes that “[a] law cannot disparately impact minority voters if its\nimpact is insignificant to begin with.” The text of the Voting Rights Act itself proves this\nstatement to be false. Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act provides, in relevant part, that a\nviolation is established if:\n\n         . . . based on the totality of circumstances, it is shown that the political processes\n         leading to nomination or election in the State or political subdivision are not\n         equally open to participation by members of a class of citizens protected by\n         subsection (a) in that its members have less opportunity than other members of\n         the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of\n         their choice.\n\nChisom v. Roemer, 501 U.S. 380, 395 (1991) (quoting Sect. 2, Voting Rights Act). Tellingly, the\nMajority cites no legal authority for the proposition that in order for a practice to be\ndiscriminatory, its “impact” must also be “significant.” Quite simply, a violation of Section 2 of\nthe Voting Rights Act does not turn on whether people are being discriminated against in\n“significant” numbers, it turns on whether minorities have “less opportunity than” non-minorities\nto vote. See id.62 Moreover, although the ballots of minorities and the homeless may be\ninsignificant to the Majority, they are not insignificant to the basic principles of the VRA, which\ndoes not require a certain number of affected persons, but looks instead at the impact on\nminorities as compared to non-minorities.\n\n         D. The Majority Applies the Wrong Legal Standard for the Equal Protection Claim\n\n         With respect to the Equal Protection Clause claim, I agree with the Majority’s implicit\nrejection of Ohio’s argument that rational-basis review applies.                      I further agree that the\nAnderson/Burdick balancing test applies instead. But the Majority’s application of the test\n\n         62\n            Further, the impact of SB 205 and 216 was certainly significant enough for the Ohio legislature to take\naction, for legislators to invest the time and energy in getting the laws passed, in defending a claim in a twelve-day\ntrial, and absorbing the time of this court on appeal. The Majority’s claim that the impact of the new legislation is\ninsignificant is belied by reality.\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691               Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.                       Page 62\n\n\ncannot be reconciled with Sixth Circuit precedent. The Majority takes issue with the district\ncourt’s consideration of the burdens imposed by the challenged provisions on NEOCH’s and\nCCH’s homeless members. The Majority relies in part on Justice Scalia’s concurrence in\nCrawford v. Marion Cty. Election Bd., 553 U.S. 181 (2008), which states that “what petitioners\nview as the law’s several light and heavy burdens are no more than the different impacts of the\nsingle burden that the law uniformly imposes on all voters.” See Crawford, 553 U.S. at 205\n(Scalia, J. concurring in judgment) (second emphasis added). The Majority then proceeds to\n“consider the burden that the provisions place on all Ohio voters.” (Emphasis added).\n\n        The Majority’s approach is incorrect. In Crawford, a plurality of the Supreme Court held\nthat an Indiana statute that required citizens voting in person on election day or casting in person\na ballot before election day was constitutional. Crawford, 553 U.S. at 185, 204. We have\npreviously held that Justice Stevens’ opinion is controlling for Marks63 purposes, see Obama for\nAmerica v. Husted, 697 F.3d 423, 441 n.7 (6th Cir. 2012) (“OFA”), and Justice Stevens, quite\nsimply, did not make the same assertion that Justice Scalia made.                         See also Ohio State\nConference of N.A.A.C.P. v. Husted, 768 F.3d 524, 544 (6th Cir. 2014), vacated sub nom. Ohio\nState Conference of The Nat. Ass’n For The Advancement of Colored People v. Husted, No. 14-\n3877, 2014 WL 10384647 (6th Cir. Oct. 1, 2014) (“A majority of the justices in Crawford either\ndid not expressly reject or in fact endorsed the idea that a burden on only a subgroup of voters\ncould trigger balancing review under Anderson–Burdick.”).\n\n        In Crawford, a plurality of the Supreme Court acknowledged that, although for most\nvoters it is not a substantial burden to comply with a photo ID requirement, a “somewhat heavier\nburden may be placed on a limited number of persons . . . includ[ing] elderly persons born out of\nState, who may have difficulty obtaining a birth certificate[,] . . . homeless persons[,]” and\nothers. 553 U.S. at 198-99. Although the Crawford Court rejected the plaintiffs’ argument that\nthe law should be enjoined on the basis of the burden to that smaller group of voters, it did so\nbecause the record in that case did not contain evidence of the specific burdens imposed on those\nvulnerable groups. Id. at 201-02. Because the record was virtually devoid of evidence that\n\n        63\n            Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 193 (1977) (“When a fragmented Court decides a case and no\nsingle rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, the holding of the Court may be viewed as\nthat position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.”)\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691              Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.                    Page 63\n\n\nwould have allowed the Court to measure the “magnitude of the burden on this narrow class of\nvoters or the portion of the burden imposed on them that is fully justified,” id. at 200, the Court\nconsidered only the burden on all Indiana voters, which it determined was only “limited.” Id. at\n203.\n\n        That the Majority here has decided to pluck one line from Justice Scalia’s concurrence to\nidentify the appropriate legal test for analyzing Plaintiffs’ equal-protection claim, is deeply\nmisguided.     The Majority, as a result, applies the wrong standard.                 Under the Majority’s\napproach, no longer must we inquire as to how a voting regulation affects different groups of\npeople—something I thought was the cornerstone of equal-protection jurisprudence. Instead, we\nmust inquire whether a voting regulation burdens everyone, and only when it does, will that\nregulation be deemed unequal. This conclusion defies both logic and common sense.\n\n        Even if simple logic did not counsel against the Majority’s approach, then our circuit\nprecedent surely does. See OFA, 697 F.3d at 431. In OFA, the challenged regulation in effect\nreduced the number of days available for in-person voting by three days. Id. This court\nconcluded that the district court did not clearly err in finding that “early voters, who have\ndisproportionately lower incomes and less education than election day voters,” were burdened by\nthe challenged regulation. Id. Put another way, this court studied the impact of the challenged\nlaw on certain groups. See id. Quite simply, despite the Majority’s assertions that a law must\nimpact everyone for it to violate the Equal Protection Clause, Crawford does not dictate or\nmandate such an analytical framework.\n\n        In sum, I would use the Anderson/Burdick balancing test to examine whether Ohio’s\ninterests outweigh the burdens imposed on Ohioan homeless individuals64 on the basis of the\nthree new requirements: (1) the birthdate and address forms requirement; (2) the reduction in the\ncure period; and (3) the restrictions on poll-worker assistance. As to the first requirement, the\nMajority and I are in agreement that the address and birthdate forms requirement violates the\nEqual Protection Clause, even though I disagree with the Majority’s analytical approach in\n\n\n        64\n           The district court found that approximately 60% of the homeless persons in shelters in Columbus, Ohio\nare African American and approximately 70% of NEOCH’s in-person homeless applicants are African American.\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691               Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.                     Page 64\n\n\nreaching that conclusion.         Nevertheless, because the first requirement is not a point of\ncontention, I focus on the remaining two.\n\n        Reduction in cure period. The district court ruled that the reduction of the cure period,\nfor absentee voters, would be “especially burdensome for voters with low literacy who may need\nto seek assistance in reading the Form 11-S65 and filling it out before returning it to the Board.”\nThus, “[l]imiting the window in which they may cure a deficient ballot imposes a significant\nburden on homeless, impoverished, and illiterate voters.”66 Husted, 2016 WL 3166251, at *39.\nFor provisional voters, “the opportunity to cure . . . ballots is limited to providing ID that they\nfailed to provide when they voted . . . .” Id. at 18.\n\n        Ohio characterizes the limitation as an “inconvenience” that does not constitute a burden.\nOhio cites numerous testimonies indicating that few individuals avail of the cure-period in any\ncase, and further, “Plaintiffs identified no person harmed by the three-day difference.” In\nproffering an interest, Ohio states that the reduction serves to provide a “workable stopping point\nbefore election officials must begin the official canvas” eleven days after Election Day. The\ndistrict court was not persuaded by the interest. “Of the twenty-one Board officials who testified\nat trial, not one indicated that he or she had experienced any inconvenience or increased cost\nduring the pre-2014 ten-day cure period, or stated that the county Board needed extra time\nbetween the conclusion of the cure period and the start of the canvass to address any particular\nmatters.” No board official mentioned any “specific task[] that needed to be conducted between\nthe end of the cure period and the beginning of the canvass.”\n\n        Ohio contends that because the cure period was rarely used, reduction of that period was\njustified. But that argument cuts the other way—if that period was rarely used, then it would not\nmatter if the cure period remained at ten days rather than at seven days. Given that no board\nofficial testified that a “specific task” needed to be conducted before the canvas, it appears that\nOhio has not struggled to cope with a ten-day cure period. In these circumstances, Ohio has not\n\n        65\n           If there is an error in any of the five fields on an absentee ballot, the Board mails a “Form 11-S,”\nspecifying the type of error and informing the voter that the ballot will not be counted unless certain steps are\ntaken—namely, returning the Form 11-S by a certain time.\n        66\n           Notably, it is unclear what channels the homeless individuals would use to receive the Form 11-S in the\nmail in time to cure the defect because these individuals are often transient with no fixed address.\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691           Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.             Page 65\n\n\nshown that its interest outweighs the burdens imposed. See OFA, 697 F.3d at 434 (“With no\nevidence that local boards of elections have struggled to cope with early voting in the past, no\nevidence that they may struggle to do so during the November 2012 election, and faced with\nseveral of those very local boards in opposition to its claims, the State has not shown that its\nregulatory interest in smooth election administration is ‘important[.]’”). It should be noted that\ndefendant bears the burden of justification. Because the defendant failed to meet even the\nminimum threshold of that burden, the district court did not clearly err.\n\n       The Majority says that there is no need for Ohio to wait for a problem to arise in the last\nthree days of the cure period in order to act; however, that analysis misses the point. If there was\nno problem in the last three days, the action lacks any justification under any standard of review.\nLacking any justification, the district court’s findings were simply not erroneous.\n\n       Prohibition against poll-worker assistance.         We must “weigh the character and\nmagnitude of the asserted injury to the” protected rights against “the precise interests put forward\nby the State as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule.” See Burdick v. Takushi,\n504 U.S. 428, 434 (1992). The district court made careful factual findings that Plaintiffs’\nconstituents were illiterate, barely literate, or suffering from disability or mental illness, which\nlimited their ability to complete basic voting-related tasks. Although it is true that illiterate and\ndisabled workers may receive assistance in filling out the form, an official testified that “Board\nstaff members were more hesitant to engage with voters and offer help when it appeared to be\nnecessary.” Thus, in light of the district court’s crediting this testimony, the district court’s\nfinding that the limitation of poll-worker assistance was burdensome is not clearly erroneous.\nThe district court then found lacking the State’s justifications for preventing poll workers from\nassisting voters who do not affirmatively ask for help because they are illiterate or disabled.\nHusted, 2016 WL 3166251, at *39. The district court’s findings were not clearly erroneous.\n\n       A close reading of the Majority’s opinion reveals that the Majority’s calibrations are\nmisaligned. On the one hand, the Majority concludes that because there is no evidence of voter\nfraud, Ohio’s asserted interest in protecting against voter fraud does not outweigh the burden\nplaced on the voters by the address and birthdate requirements. Yet in the same breath, the\nMajority concludes that “Ohio’s legitimate interest in minimizing election-official mistakes by\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691                Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.                          Page 66\n\n\nensuring that they are not overburdened and do not fill in others’ personal information justifies\nthe limitation placed on poll-worker assistance” even though there is no evidence that the poll\nworkers were overburdened or that there were problems with others filling in personal\ninformation.67\n\n         Moreover, the Majority reiterates that the impact on voters is small and insignificant.\nHowever, the Majority fails to cite any legal precedent that mandates a certain mathematical\nquantum because none is required. Furthermore, the complete lack of sensitivity and unbridled\nprivilege with which the Majority exercises its view of the trivial is exactly what led to the\nconstitutional and statutory protections at issue in this case. Still further, as I have stated\nthroughout this dissent, the stakes of these proceedings are hardly small, insignificant, or trivial;\ninstead, the impact is worthy of countless hours of the Ohio congressional time, energy, and\nefforts in not only passing these restrictive measures, but defending them. The rush to set forth\nand pass these measures belies any claim that what is at stake is slight, minor, unimportant,\ntrifling, trivial, insignificant, inconsequential, negligible, nugatory, or infinitesimal. Similarly,\nthe Majority continues to point out that the vast Majority of challenged ballots are struck for\nreasons that do not involve SB 205 and 216; however, our inquiry is the impact on those voters\nwhose ballots SB 205 and 216 does disparately affect.\n\n         In sum, because I conclude that the burdens of the challenged laws outweigh the\ngovernment’s purported interests under the Anderson/Burdick balancing test, I would affirm the\ndistrict court’s judgment in favor of Plaintiffs with respect to the Equal Protection Clause claim.\n\n                                                 CONCLUSION\n\n         The Majority applies the wrong legal tests, misapprehends the basic concept of\ndisproportionality, and applies the wrong standard of review. Most disturbingly, the Majority\nsubstitutes its own view of the record for the carefully decided and supported factual findings of\nthe district court. As the Supreme Court has cautioned, a “reviewing court oversteps the bounds\nof its duty . . . if it undertakes to duplicate the role of the lower court.” Anderson, 470 U.S. at\n\n         67\n           While the state “need not justify its laws with ‘elaborate, empirical verification,’” Citizens for Legislative\nChoice v. Miller, 144 F.3d 916, 924 (6th Cir. 1998), the state does need to assert a real and “precise” interest against\nwhich the citizens’ right to vote must be weighed. See Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 434 (1992).\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691           Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.               Page 67\n\n\n573. “The trial judge’s major role is the determination of fact, and with experience in fulfilling\nthat role comes expertise.” Id. at 574. “[P]arties to a case on appeal have already been forced to\nconcentrate their energies and resources on persuading the trial judge that their account of the\nfacts is the correct one; requiring them to persuade three more judges at the appellate level is\nrequiring too much.” Id. at 575. Today, the Majority disregards the Supreme Court’s well-\nestablished principles and substitutes its own view of the record for the carefully decided and\nsupported factual findings of the district court.\n\n       The birth of this Nation was founded upon the radical principle that we, as a people,\nwould govern ourselves. And voting is the ultimate expression of self-government. Instead of\nmaking it easier for all persons, unrestrained and unfettered, to exercise this fundamental right to\nvote, legislators are making it harder. States are audaciously nullifying a right for which our\nancestors relentlessly fought and—in some instances—even tragically died. From that struggle\ncame the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and later, the Voting Rights\nAct. It is this court’s responsibility to enforce both the Constitution and the statute, and thereby\nsafeguard this precious right to vote. In my opinion, the Majority has failed to do just that. The\nMajority takes the position that unless a rule affects non-minorities, it does not run afoul of the\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This baffling position distorts the Equal\nProtection Clause so much so that the clause becomes unrecognizable, unenforceable, and\nfundamentally, unequal. For years, states have been (both stealthily and overtly) erecting hurdles\nto the right to vote. And the votes of those who are actually able to surmount those hurdles are\noften diluted through Gerrymandering.          These states’ actions of implementing rules and\nredrawing districts in an effort to restrict minorities’ access to the ballots is another reminder that\nhistory repeats itself. It is yet another reminder that many people hold the misguided belief that\nonly the privileged majority should be granted access to political power and adequate\nrepresentation.\n\n       With every gain in equality, there is often an equally robust and reactive retrenchment.\nWe must never forget that constant dialectical tension. For every action, there is a reaction. The\nMajority’s decision is a fateful reminder that we can never fool ourselves into believing that we\nhave arrived as a nation. Our decision today, and more decisions like this one, will undoubtedly\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691           Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.            Page 68\n\n\nshape the future of this Nation because deciding who gets to vote inevitably affects who will\nbecome our leaders—a determination that is grounded in the principles long cherished and long\npursued by our Founding Fathers. This is exactly why so many are actively seeking to etch away\nat the right to vote in assembly halls across this nation. These efforts are hardly insignificant or\nnegligible. They are, for their proponents, necessary and highly deliberate. It is my hope that\nwhen future generations look back on these decisions, they conclude that we were on the right\nside of history. But today I fear that we were not.\n\n       For these reasons, I cannot concur with my colleagues in full. In the interest of clarity, I\nwould affirm the district court and permanently enjoin the enforcement of portions of SB 205\nand 216 that: require boards to reject the ballots of absentee and provisional voters who do not\naccurately complete the address and birthdate fields; reduce the cure period to seven days;\nprohibit most forms of poll-worker assistance; and require provisional voters to print their names\non the affirmation form.\n\f",

In 2014, Ohio enacted Senate Bills 205 and 216. Among other\nchanges to Ohio election law, they (1) required county boards of elections to reject the ballots of\nabsentee voters and provisional voters whose identification envelopes or affirmation forms,\nrespectively, contain an address or birthdate that does not perfectly match voting records;\n(2) reduced the number of post-election days for absentee voters to cure identification-envelope\nerrors, and provisional voters to present valid identification, from ten to seven; and (3) limited\nthe ways in which poll workers can assist in-person voters. The district court held that all three\nprovisions impose an undue burden on the right to vote and disparately impact minority voters.\n\n       We affirm the plaintiffs’ undue-burden claim only as it relates to the requirement\nimposed by Senate Bill 205 that in-person and mail-in absentee voters complete the address and\nbirthdate fields on the identification envelope with technical precision. We reverse the district\ncourt’s finding that the other provisions create an undue burden. We also reverse the district\ncourt’s finding that the provisions disparately impact minority voters. We affirm the district\ncourt’s other holdings.\n\nI. Background\n\n       Ohioans need not queue on Election Day to exercise the right to vote. The State accepts\nabsentee ballots by mail and, on designated early-voting days, in person. Ohio Rev. Code\n§§ 3509.01(B), 3509.05(A). A voter who declares that he or she is registered but whose name\ndoes not appear on a precinct’s list of eligible voters can cast an in-person provisional ballot on\neither an early-voting day or Election Day. Id. § 3505.181(A)(1), (B)(2).\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691              Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.                   Page 3\n\n\n        In 2014, the Ohio General Assembly enacted Senate Bills 205 (SB 205) and 216\n(SB 216), amending state election provisions that govern absentee and provisional voting. The\nlaws have been in effect since early June 2014.\n\n        A. SB 205\n\n        Any eligible voter can apply for an absentee ballot.                 Ohio Rev. Code § 3509.03.\nCompleting the application involves providing a name, signature, registration address, date of\nbirth, and a form of identification. Id. § 3509.03(A)–(E). Acceptable identification includes: a\ndriver’s license number; the last four digits of a Social Security number; or a copy of a valid\nphoto ID, valid military ID, current utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or\nother government document (excluding a registration notice) showing the voter’s name and\naddress. Id. § 3509.03(E). The same are acceptable forms of identification when casting an\nabsentee ballot. Id. § 3509.05(A). Applicants can request and receive an absentee ballot through\nthe mail by providing a mailing address. Id. § 3509.03(I).\n\n        When voting, mail-in and some in-person absentee voters must complete an\n“identification envelope” along with their ballots.1 The identification envelope contains fields\nfor the voter’s name, signature, voting residence, and birthdate. The county boards of elections\nmay preprint the voter’s name and address on the identification envelopes of mail-in voters. Id.\n§ 3509.04(B). The Secretary of State’s 2015 election manual “instruct[s]” the boards to do so in\norder to “eliminate any chance that a voter’s absentee ballot may be rejected for the sole reason”\nthat the voter failed to complete those fields. Before SB 205 went into effect, absentee ballots\ncould be rejected if the identification envelope “accompanying an absent voter’s ballot or absent\nvoter’s presidential ballot [was] insufficient,” if the signatures “d[id] not correspond with the\nperson’s registration signature,” or if the voter failed to provide identification. Ohio Rev. Code\n§ 3509.07 (2013). In 2010, the Secretary circulated a directive to the county boards of elections\nstating that the identification envelope must include a proper voter name and signature for the\ncorresponding ballot to be counted.\n\n\n\n        1\n          Some Ohio counties give early in-person voters the option to cast their ballots on a direct-recording\nelectronic-voting machine. Those who do so are not also required to complete the identification envelope.\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691                 Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.                           Page 4\n\n\n         SB 205 added two fields to that list.                It specifies that an identification envelope is\n“incomplete” without accurately filled birthdate2 and address fields.                              Ohio Rev. Code\n§ 3509.06(D)(3). An “incomplete” identification envelope results in the ballot’s rejection unless\nthe voter “provide[s] the necessary information to the board of elections in writing and on a form\nprescribed by the secretary of state.” Id. § 3509.06(D)(3)(b).\n\n         SB 205 made two other changes to Ohio election law that are at issue. When an absentee\nballot contains an error, the board of elections gives the voter notice of the additional information\nrequired for the ballot to be counted.                 SB 205 reduced the window for voters to submit\ncorrections from the ten days after Election Day to the seven days after Election Day. See ibid.\nIn addition, SB 205 prevents election officials from providing “assistance” to voters with the\nexceptions of voters who “[d]eclare[]” that they are “unable to mark” their ballot due to\n“blindness, disability, or illiteracy.” Id. § 3505.24.\n\n         B. SB 216\n\n         Provisional voters must complete a “provisional ballot affirmation” form. Ohio Rev.\nCode § 3505.182. Before the implementation of SB 216, a provisional ballot was counted if the\nvoter presented valid identification3 and the affirmation form included the voter’s name,\nsignature, and a statement of eligibility. Ohio Rev. Code § 3505.183(B)(1) (2013). The back of\nthe form contained a separate registration application. Provisional voters whose ballots were\nrejected for failure to register but who completed the application became registered for the next\nelection.\n\n         SB 216 added birthdate4 and address to the list of affirmation-form fields that provisional\nvoters must accurately complete. Ohio Rev. Code § 3505.183(B)(1)(a). The affirmation form\n\n\n         2\n          The birthdate requirement is satisfied if the voter provides a month and day of birth that match the month\nand day in the registration database, if the birthdate in the registration database is January 1, 1800, or if a majority of\nthe four-member elections board find that the voter has met the name, address, signature, and identification\nrequirements. Ohio Rev. Code § 3509.06(D)(3)(a)(iii).\n         3\n         The identification requirement for provisional voters is similar to that for absentee voters. See Ohio Rev.\nCode § 3505.18(A).\n         4\n          The birthdate requirement for provisional voters has similar exceptions to those for the requirement for\nabsentee voters. See Ohio Rev. Code § 3505.183(B)(3)(e).\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691                Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.                       Page 5\n\n\nnow doubles as a registration application, applicable to provisional voters whose ballots are\nrejected for failure to register. Id. § 3505.182(F). The bill also added the word “printed” before\n“name” in the list of affirmation-form requirements. Compare id. § 3505.183(B)(1)(a), with\nOhio Rev. Code § 3505.183(B)(1)(a) (2013).                   This appears to have clarified, rather than\nmodified, existing law. Between the 2008, 2010, and 2012 general elections, most counties\nrejected provisional ballots for failure to include a “printed” name.                      Furthermore, a 2012\ndirective from the Secretary instructed elections boards to reject provisional ballots whose\naffirmation statements lacked “the voter’s printed name.”\n\n          A provisional voter without valid identification may return to the board of elections to\ncure an otherwise complete ballot by providing a driver’s license number, state identification\ncard number, the last four digits of the individual’s Social Security number, a photo or military\nID, or a copy of a current utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or other\ngovernment document (excluding a registration notice) showing the voter’s name and address.\nOhio Rev. Code § 3505.181(B)(7)(a). SB 216 reduced the period for doing so from the ten days\nafter Election Day to the seven days after Election Day.                          Compare Ohio Rev. Code\n§ 3505.181(B)(8) (2013), with Ohio Rev. Code § 3505.181(B)(7).\n\n          C. Procedural History\n\n          In 2006, the Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless (NEOCH) and the Service\nEmployees International Union sued the Secretary to enjoin the enforcement of voter-\nidentification and provisional-ballot laws.5 Although perhaps rich source material for a prickly\ncivil-procedure hypothetical, the case’s many twists and turns are unnecessary to chronicle here.\nSuffice it to say, litigation was still proceeding in 2010 when the parties entered a consent\ndecree.\n\n          Ohio’s eighty-eight counties have four-person boards responsible for administrating local\nelections. The 2010 decree required the Secretary to inform elections boards to count the\nprovisional ballots of registered voters whose affirmation forms included an accurate name,\n\n          5\n           Within days of the plaintiffs’ filing suit, Ohio intervened as a defendant. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b). With\nthe parties’ consent, the Ohio Democratic Party (ODP) intervened as a plaintiff in 2008. Soon after, the Columbus\nCoalition for the Homeless (CCH) was added as a plaintiff.\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691                Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.                         Page 6\n\n\nverified signature, and the last four digits of the voter’s Social Security number. It also listed\ngrounds on which provisional ballots could not be rejected, including failure to “provide a date\nof birth” or “address . . . tied to a house, apartment or other dwelling [if] the voter indicated that\nhe or she resides at a non-building location.”6 The Secretary was required to give the court\nnotice of changes to the law that would “supersede” the decree.\n\n         The decree was in effect for the 2010 and 2012 elections. Although it was originally set\nto expire on June 30, 2013, the court, on the plaintiffs’ motion, extended it through the end of\n2016. In September 2014, the Secretary informed the court that SB 216’s rejection requirement\nfor imperfect birthdate and address fields, and the three-day reduction in the cure-period,\n“automatically amended” the decree.\n\n         The plaintiffs moved for leave to file a supplemental complaint. See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n15(d).       They petitioned the court to permanently enjoin the Secretary from implementing\nportions of SB 205 and SB 216. The defendants opposed. In August 2015, the court granted the\nmotion because SB 216 “ero[ded]” the consent decree’s protections and because both SB 205\nand SB 216 related to the original complaint, which challenged Ohio’s voter-identification\nrequirements more generally.\n\n         The supplemental complaint asserts ten counts: a viewpoint-discrimination claim under\nthe First and Fourteenth Amendments; claims under the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process\nClause of a fundamentally unfair voting system and violation of procedural due process; claims\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause of an undue burden, lack of uniform\nstandards, and arbitrary and disparate treatment; a claim of intentional discrimination in violation\nof the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments; and literacy-test, immaterial-error, and vote-denial\nclaims under the Voting Rights Act (VRA).\n\n         The court presided over a bench trial in March 2016. Over the course of twelve days, it\nheard the testimony of more than twenty board of elections officials from different counties, two\n\n         6\n           Ohio law requires elections boards to “examine any additional information” in addition to “determin[ing]\nwhether the individual who cast the provisional ballot is registered and eligible to vote in the applicable election” in\norder to “determine whether a provisional ballot is valid and entitled to be counted.” Ohio Rev. Code.\n§ 3505.183(B)(1)–(2). The original complaint alleged that elections boards would not “apply the same standards\nwhen . . . determining whether provisional ballots are eligible to be counted.”\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691           Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.            Page 7\n\n\nmembers of the Ohio General Assembly, the Assistant Secretary of State (who also serves as\n“head of elections”), and two members of the Ohio Association of Election Officials (OAEO),\nwhich includes members of the elections boards of every Ohio county and has equal\nrepresentation from the two major parties. In addition, the record includes declarations of\nabsentee and provisional voters whose ballots were rejected for birthdate and address errors.\nSeveral, for example, wrote the current date instead of their birthdates. One transposed the\nlocation of the digits indicating the month and day of his birth despite specific language on the\nform to the contrary because he grew up in a country that follows the date sequence used\nelsewhere in the world.\n\n       The court was also presented with opinion testimony from Dr. Jeffrey Timberlake for the\nplaintiffs, and Drs. Nolan McCarty and M.V. Hood, III, for the defendants. Because Ohio does\nnot record the race or ethnicity of its voters, Timberlake used county-level data to make\ninferences about the relationship between voter race and the use or rejection of absentee and\nprovisional ballots. He examined data from the 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014 general elections.\n\n       Timberlake divided counties into “high minority” and “low minority” groups, and\nperformed a regression assessing the correlation between a county’s percent minority and\nabsentee and provisional ballot use and rejection. Two of his models controlled for urbanicity,\nand the age, education, and income of the white population. In those models, Timberlake\nobserved “some evidence, though not very strong evidence, that absentee ballots are used more\nheavily by voters in high-minority counties.” He found “much stronger” evidence of higher rates\nof absentee-ballot rejection among African-American voters. All four elections showed higher\nuse and rejection rates of provisional ballots in higher-minority counties, even when controlling\nfor urbanicity and the three white-population characteristics.\n\n       The district court’s opinion gave “great weight” to Timberlake’s conclusions. It found\nthat the defense expert witnesses did not refute Timberlake’s report. The court next considered\nnine nonexhaustive factors from Thornburg v. Gingles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111736\"><a href=\"/opinion/111736/thornburg-v-gingles/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986), “that might be\nprobative” of a violation of Section 2 of the VRA. Id. at 36; id. at 36–37. In particular, the court\nconcluded that the evidence on the record did not support Ohio’s justifications for enacting\nSB 205 and SB 216.\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691               Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.                      Page 8\n\n\n          Ultimately, the court entered judgment for the plaintiffs on their undue-burden and vote-\ndenial claims, and for the defendants on all other counts.                     It permanently enjoined the\nenforcement of the portions of SB 205 and SB 216 that: require boards to reject the ballots of\nabsentee and provisional voters who do not accurately complete the address and birthdate fields;\nreduce the cure period to seven days; prohibit most forms of poll-worker assistance; and require\nprovisional voters to print their names on the affirmation form.\n\n          Ohio appeals the entry of judgment for the plaintiffs on the undue-burden and vote-denial\nclaims.       Additionally, it contends that the court improperly approved the supplemental\ncomplaint, that the plaintiffs should have been precluded from bringing their challenges, and that\nthey lack standing. The plaintiffs cross-appeal the entry of judgment for Ohio on the uniform-\nstandards, literacy-test, due-process, intentional-discrimination, and immaterial-error claims.\n\nII. Claim Preclusion and Standing\n\n          Ohio argues that all three plaintiffs, and the Ohio Democratic Party (ODP) at the very\nleast, are bound by the district court’s decision in Ohio Org. Collaborative v. Husted, No. 2:15-\ncv-1802, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3248030</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (S.D. Ohio May 24, 2016). If claim preclusion prevents ODP from\nproceeding, Ohio asserts, we should next consider its argument that the remaining plaintiffs,\nNEOCH and the Columbus Coalition for the Homeless (CCH), lack standing. That one-two\npunch is too clever by half. Even if ODP were bound by Ohio Org. Collaborative (an issue on\nwhich we need not opine),7 NEOCH and CCH are not. And they have standing to bring suit.\n\n          For the first time on appeal, Ohio contends that NEOCH and CCH are precluded from\nbringing their claims because of a decision in a suit in which ODP was a party that was issued\ntwo weeks before the district-court judgment in this case. Even assuming that Ohio did not\nwaive this argument by failing to raise it before the district court, see Mun. Resale Serv.\nCustomers v.

Id. at 459–60.\n\n       Unlike the plaintiff organization in Fair Elections that challenged then-existing voting\nlaw, NEOCH takes issue with newly enacted provisions. That distinction is not just academic.\nWhereas the Fair Election plaintiff merely exhausted “efforts and expense [in] advis[ing] others\nhow to comport with” existing law, id. at 460, NEOCH has immediate plans to mobilize its\nlimited resources to revise its voter-education and get-out-the-vote programs on account of\nSB 205 and SB 216. In the past, NEOCH focused on educating and assisting the homeless with\nmail-in voting. Given the changes ushered in by SB 205 and SB 216, NEOCH determined that\nits resources are better spent assisting the homeless in participating in early in-person voting. To\nthat end, it plans to redirect its focus for the 2016 general election by encouraging early in-\nperson voting and driving homeless voters to the polls. It reports that this will require more\nvolunteers, time, and expenditures. That is not simply the “effort and expense” associated with\nadvising voters how to “comport” with the law, ibid., but an overhaul of the get-out-the-vote\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691           Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v.

Because their allegations indicate that the burden would cause them to\nchange significantly their expenditures and operation and a favorable decision would redress that\ninjury, NEOCH has organizational standing here as well.

Supplemental Pleadings\n\n       The district court did not abuse its discretion by granting the plaintiffs’ motion to file a\nsupplemental complaint. A district court may “permit a party to serve a supplemental pleading\nsetting out any transaction, occurrence, or event that happened after the date of the pleading to be\nsupplemented.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(d). Rule 15(d) aims “to give the court broad discretion in\nallowing a supplemental pleading.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(d) advisory committee’s note to 1963\namendment.\n\n       We review for abuse of discretion. See Spies v. Voinovich, 48 F. App’x 520, 527\n(6th Cir. 2002). A district court abuses its discretion by relying on an incorrect legal standard,\nmisapplying the correct legal standard, or judging the outcome based on clearly erroneous factual\nfindings.

Village of Armada, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">630</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 643 (6th Cir. 2015).\n\n       Here, the court found that the original and supplemental complaints were sufficiently\nlinked because SB 216 superseded the consent decree’s protections and because both provisions\nallegedly imposed burdens that would impede voting in similar ways as the voter-identification\nprovisions originally challenged. “In essence,” the court found, “the ‘focal points’ of both\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691              Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.                     Page 12\n\n\ncomplaints are the same: ensuring all ballots, but particularly provisional and absentee\nballots, . . . are not unfairly excluded and left uncounted due to illegal voter identification rules.”\n\n        In so concluding, the court carefully applied the correct legal standard and did not make\nclearly erroneous factual findings. The supplemental complaint revolved around new election\nlaws that affected the terms of a longstanding consent decree that resolved an even lengthier\ndispute. So, Defendants’ reliance on Leisure Caviar, 616 F.3d at 616, which addressed the issue\nof newly discovered evidence after entry of judgment, is misplaced. See First Br. 56. The\ndistrict court did not clearly err when it found that the plaintiffs’ primary grievance with both\nsets of provisions was that methods of voter identification caused elections boards to\ndisproportionately reject homeless voters’ absentee and provisional ballots. The interest of\njudicial economy, although not necessarily enough in and of itself, also militates in favor of\nallowing supplemental pleadings. When a dispute is complicated and protracted, and a new\ncomplaint the likely alternative, allowing supplemental pleadings before a court already up to\nspeed is often the most efficient course.\n\nIV.

Aug. 23, 2016) (evaluating a vote-denial claim using the\nOhio State Conference framework, with additional clarification).\n\n       Ohio argues that the two-part test goes awry in two ways. Whether the district court did\nin fact mischaracterize the test is irrelevant, however. At the very least, a successful Section 2\nclaim requires the plaintiffs to prove disparate impact. The plaintiffs failed to prove that SB 205\nand SB 216 have a disparate impact on African-American voters. Therefore, analysis of any test\nbeyond disparate impact is unnecessary.\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691                Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.                       Page 15\n\n\n                  2. SB 205 and SB 216\n\n       The district court found that “Timberlake’s data on disparities in provisional and absentee\nballot usage and rejection rates reveal that higher minority population share is correlated to\nhigher rates of absentee ballot rejection and provisional ballot usage and rejection.” Based on\nthat analysis, it concluded that SB 205 and SB 216 make “African-American voters . . . more\nlikely than white voters to have their absentee or provisional ballots rejected.” The record would\nindicate otherwise.\n\n       For starters, Timberlake’s regression analysis simply does not support the conclusion that\nSB 205’s address and birthdate perfection requirement, or its limitation on poll-worker\nassistance, disparately impact minority voters. When controlling for urbanicity and the age,\nincome, and education of the white population, Timberlake found that for every additional one\npercent minority in a county, use of absentee ballots increased by a small amount in the 2008 and\n2010 general elections—134.2 and 195.2, respectively, for every 100,000 voting-age residents—\nbut decreased by 99.5 and 96.6 ballots in the 2012 and 2014 general elections.9 He therefore\nfound that the evidence to support the conclusion that high-minority counties use absentee\nballots more heavily was “not very strong.”\n\n       Certainly additional absentee ballots are rejected on account of the perfection\nrequirement. But there is scant evidence in the record that minority voters are more likely to cast\nabsentee ballots than white voters. It would therefore be illogical to infer that rejecting absentee\nballots for failure to accurately complete address and birthdate fields disproportionately affects\nminority voters without some other evidence that minority voters are less likely to fulfill those\nrequirements. And, as discussed in more detail elsewhere, the vast majority of absentee-ballot\nrejections are for reasons other than those challenged here.\n\n       The same is true of the limits that SB 205 places on poll workers. To be sure, the\nprovision will impact the hypothetical early in-person absentee voter whose ballot would have\nbeen rejected in past elections but for now-prohibited forms of assistance. Yet the record\ncontains no evidence of how many, if any, voters received such additional “assistance.” Because\n\n       9\n           Timberlake did not separately analyze in-person absentee voting and mail-in absentee voting.\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691           Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.              Page 16\n\n\nevidence of higher minority absentee-ballot usage is weak, and the record does not indicate that\nminority voters disproportionately benefited from assistance that is now proscribed, plaintiffs\nhave not demonstrated a disparate impact.\n\n        On their other Section 2 claims, the plaintiffs fail to show that the challenged provisions\nwill have much of an impact on the right to vote at all. The district court reasoned that reducing\nthe cure period from ten to seven days would burden illiterate voters and voters for whom\ntravelling to cure their ballots presents logistical difficulties. Hypothetically speaking, a scenario\ncould exist where voters showed up in droves to correct absentee-ballot errors and to produce\nprovisional-ballot ID during those three days. But that has not been the case in Ohio. In fact, the\nsingle election-board official whose trial testimony the district court cited in support of its\nconclusion stated that in Hamilton County, Ohio’s third most populous, “very few voters” cured\ntheir ballots during that three-day window. The record contains no evidence on the number of\nabsentee or provisional voters who took advantage of the cure days eliminated by SB 205 and\nSB 216. A law cannot disparately impact minority voters if its impact is insignificant to begin\nwith.\n\n        Challenges to SB 216’s perfection requirement of provisional voters and its limitation on\npoll-worker assistance suffer from the same shortcoming.             The conclusion that SB 216\ndisproportionately impacts minority voters is not borne out in the data. For the vast majority of\nprovisional voters whose ballots are rejected, no amount of help would change the result. The\nrecord contains provisional voting data for the 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2015 general\nelections. In every one of those elections, eighty to ninety percent of provisional voters whose\nballots were rejected either had failed to register at all or voted in the wrong place. Placing a\nminor check on election workers’ interactions with in-person voters has no impact on the vast\nmajority of provisional-ballot rejections.\n\n        SB 216 has been in effect during the two most recent general elections. The provisional\nballots of 247 voters in 2014 and 373 voters in 2015 were rejected for failure to provide an\naccurate birthdate or address. Respectively, these figures represented about five and three\npercent of rejected provisional ballots—and less than one percent of all provisional ballots cast.\nWhat is more, the 2015 figure does not account for individuals whose 2014 ballots were rejected\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691           Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.              Page 17\n\n\nfor failure to register but who accurately completed the affirmation form and successfully\nregistered for the next election. Presumably, some of those voters would not have registered\notherwise, which means that SB 216 has the effect of reducing the number of ballots rejected on\nthe basis of nonregistration in future elections. That impact helps to counter the small impact\nthat SB 216 does have. Given the negligible impact of SB 216’s perfection requirement on\nballot rejection, the plaintiffs have not shown that the provision disproportionately affects\nminority voters.\n\n       B. Literacy Test\n\n       Section 4 of the VRA provides that “[n]o citizen shall be denied” the right to vote\n“because of his failure to comply with any test or device.” 52 U.S.C. § 10501(a) (Supp. II Vol.\nIII 2015). “Test or device” is defined as a requirement that, as a prerequisite to vote or register, a\nperson demonstrate the ability to “read, write, understand, or interpret any matter,” demonstrate\n“educational achievement” or “knowledge” of any subject, “possess good moral character,” or\nhave others “vouch[]” for them. Id. § 10501(b).\n\n       The district court found that § 10501 includes a private right of action before concluding\nthat the challenged provisions do not violate the statute. Even if a private right of action is\npermitted, we agree with the district court that SB 205 and SB 216 do not impose a “test or\ndevice” on Ohio voters.\n\n       The plaintiffs equate the requirement that absentee and provisional voters accurately\ncomplete address and birthdate fields with the “vague, arbitrary, hypertechnical or unnecessarily\ndifficult” tests cited by Congress as evidence of the urgent need for the VRA. H.R. Rep. No. 89-\n439, at 13 (1965). However, requiring voters’ most basic biographical and personal information\nbears no similarity to selectively enforced voting tests whose “only real function” is to “foster\nracial discrimination.” Ibid.; see also id. at 12 (citing United States v.

The plaintiffs’ supposition that\nthe stigma of illiteracy deters some voters from requesting assistance distracts from the focus of\nthe inquiry—state action. To fill the address and birthdate fields, voters need not “demonstrate\nthe ability” to read or write any more so than they do to otherwise complete a ballot.\n\n       C. Immaterial Error\n\n       The VRA provides that no one acting under color of law may “deny the right of any\nindividual to vote in any election because of an error or omission” on a registration application or\nvoting ballot if the error or omission “is not material” in determining whether the individual is\nqualified to vote. 52 U.S.C. § 10101(a)(2)(B) (Supp. II Vol. III 2015). A later subsection of\n§ 10101 states that when any person has deprived another of “any right or privilege secured by\nsubsection (a) . . . , the Attorney General may institute for the United States . . . a civil action or\nother proper proceeding for preventive relief.” Id. at § 10101(c).\n\n       We have held that the negative implication of Congress’s provision for enforcement by\nthe Attorney General is that the statute does not permit private rights of action. See McKay v.\nThompson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770419\"><a href=\"/opinion/770419/martin-s-mckay-united-states-of-america-intervenor-v-brook-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">752</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 756 (6th Cir. 2000).

Id. at 1295.\n\n       “A panel of this court may not overturn binding precedent because a published prior\npanel decision ‘remains controlling authority unless an inconsistent decision of the United States\nSupreme Court requires modification of the decision or this Court sitting en banc overrules the\nprior decision.’” United States v.

Equal-Protection Claims\n\n       Three equal-protection questions are at issue on appeal: Whether the challenged\nprovisions (1) unduly burden the right to vote; (2) result in a lack of uniform standards; and\n(3) were enacted with a discriminatory purpose.

As a general matter, “important regulatory interests are\ngenerally sufficient to justify reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions.” Anderson, 460 U.S. at\n788.\n\n       In striking portions of SB 205 and SB 216, the district court considered the burdens that\nthe provisions impose on NEOCH’s and CCH’s homeless and illiterate members. Zeroing in on\nthe abnormal burden experienced by a small group of voters is problematic at best, and\nprohibited at worst. In Crawford v. Marion Cty. Election Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145813\"><a href=\"/opinion/145813/crawford-v-marion-county-election-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2008), the Supreme\nCourt upheld an Indiana voter-ID law. The plaintiffs urged the Court to consider the burden\nimposed on the “narrow class of voters” who could not afford or obtain a birth certification and\nhad to return to the circuit court clerk’s office after voting. Id. at 200 (opinion of Stevens, J.).\nThe lead opinion refrained from weighing the “special burden” faced by “a small number of\nvoters” because the evidence on the record gave “no indication of how common the problem is,”\nwhich made it impossible “to quantify . . . the magnitude of the burden.” Id. at 200, 202. A\nconcurrence rejected outright the idea of measuring the burden on a subset of voters. “[W]hat\npetitioners view as the law’s several light and heavy burdens,” it reasoned, “are no more than the\ndifferent impacts of the single burden that the law uniformly imposes on all voters.” Id. at 205\n(Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment).\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691                Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.                        Page 21\n\n\n         In any event, the district court erred by weighing Ohio’s regulatory interests against the\nburden that the challenged provisions uniquely place on homeless and illiterate voters.10 Even\nunder the controlling opinion’s more liberal approach to burden measuring, the record here is\ndevoid of quantifiable evidence from which an arbiter could gauge the frequency with which this\nnarrow class of voters has been or will become disenfranchised as a result of SB 205 and\nSB 216. We therefore consider the burden that the provisions place on all Ohio voters.\n\n                  2. SB 205 and SB 216\n\n         Address and Birthdate Requirements. Requiring boards of elections to reject the ballots\nof absentee and provisional voters who fail to accurately complete birthdate and address\nfields directly and measurably disenfranchises some voters. As discussed, see supra p. 16, in the\n2014 and 2015 general elections, 620 provisional ballots were rejected as failing to meet\nSB 216’s address and birthdate perfection requirements, out of a total of 16,942 rejections.\nAmong over 860,000 domestic civilian absentee ballots cast in 2014 and 430,000 in 2015,\n1378 ballots were rejected in 2014, and 334 in 2015, for failure to comply with the similar\nprovision in SB 205.11\n\n         Considering the number of total ballots cast in a general election in Ohio, these figures\nare small. And yet, as demonstrated through voter declarations and the testimony of board\nofficials, the formal rigidity of the challenged requirements may leave no room for elections\nboards to make their own judgments on voter eligibility. As a result, identifiable voters may be\ndisenfranchised based only on a technicality. For example, transposing the location of the month\nand year numerals of a birthdate, writing the current date by mistake, and inverting digits in an\naddress have been cited by elections boards as reasons for automatic ballot rejection.\n\n         A facial challenge to a state law fails “where the statute has a ‘plainly legitimate sweep.’”\nWash.

For SB 216, the interest in registering provisional voters outweighs the burden of\ncompleting the address and birthdate fields. Most provisional-ballot rejections occur in Ohio\nbecause the purported voter was not registered. In 2012, a presidential-election year, over\n20,000 provisional ballots were rejected for failure to register. Ohio uses the affirmation form to\nregister the unregistered provisional voters who unsuccessfully try to cast ballots each year.\n\n       The additional fields also help elections boards positively identify provisional voters. For\ntheir ballots to be counted, provisional voters must be located in a statewide database of\nregistered voters. Predictably, entering a provisional voter’s name and the last four digits of their\nSocial Security number into the database can result in multiple hits. Birthdate and address\ninformation can narrow the plausible registered voters and assist in confirming an eligible voter’s\nright to vote (and vice versa). Ohio’s important interests in provisional-voter registration and\nidentification eclipse the small burden of accurately completing the two fields—a burden that\nactually impacts just a few hundred voters each election, an impact wholly in their own control.\n\n       However, we agree with the district court that Ohio has made no such justification for\nmandating technical precision in the address and birthdate fields of the absentee-ballot\nidentification envelope. Although the burden is small for most voters, its impact is greater than\nthat of SB 216, and none of the “precise interests put forward by” Ohio justifies it. Burdick, 504\nU.S. at 434 (citation omitted). Ohio first posits that the perfection requirement hampers “rare[]”\nattempts to cast others’ mail-in absentee ballots.       First Br. 30.     Combatting voter fraud\nperpetrated by mail is undeniably a legitimate concern. See Purcell v. Gonzalez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145774\"><a href=\"/opinion/145774/purcell-v-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 4\n(2006) (per curiam). Yet some level of specificity is necessary to convert that abstraction into a\ndefinite interest for a court to weigh. The district court found that Ohio did not even “offer[]\ncombatting voter fraud” as a relevant interest. Given the lack of any coherent fraud argument\noffered at trial, that conclusion is understandable.\n\n       Moreover, Ohio’s argument collapses under scrutiny. Before SB 205, absentee voters\nhad to clear several hurdles to confirm their identity.          In addition to presenting valid\nidentification, a voter needed the signature on the envelope to match the voter’s registration\nsignature, and even then, the information in the identification envelope could be deemed\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691           Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.            Page 23\n\n\n“insufficient.” Ohio Rev. Code § 3509.07 (2013); see also id. §§ 3509.05–.06, 3511.09. Like all\nother ballots, those of absentee voters could be challenged “for cause.” Id. § 3509.07. Under\nsome circumstances, certain errors in address or birthdate could well constitute “insufficiency.”\nSB 205 altered that provision, requiring boards to reject absentee ballots that do not include an\naccurate address and birthdate for the voter.\n\n        Even Ohio recognizes that the downside of rejecting mail-in absentee ballots for address\nerrors overshadows any concern with address falsification.          Ohio statute allows, and the\nSecretary has instructed, boards of elections to complete the address field on mail-in\nidentification envelopes so that ballots are not thrown out “for th[at] sole reason.” At bottom,\nOhio’s interest revolves around the “rare” instances where a fraudster manages to swipe the\nballot of a registered absentee voter, forge the signature, and return the ballot to the board of\nelections with a copy of the voter’s identification, driver’s license number, or Social Security\nnumber, and would have gotten away scot free but for the troublesome birthdate requirement.\nWhat is more, Ohio does not explain why its interest in preventing voter fraud by mail makes it\n“necessary to burden” the plaintiffs’ voting rights. Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434 (citation omitted).\nBefore SB 205, boards were instructed to strike ballots if the identification envelope contained\n“insufficient” information and had discretion to “challenge” absent voters “for cause.” Ohio\nRev. Code § 3509.07 (2013). That provision gave boards more than sufficient flexibility to\ninvestigate birthdate errors for fraud without the heavy-handed requirement of ballot rejection on\na technicality.\n\n        At trial, the district court was not presented with a shred of evidence of mail-in absentee-\nvoter fraud. That absence of support is corroborated by ample testimony. Halfway through trial,\nthe court held a sidebar where it asked counsel for Ohio whether a fraud argument was “going to\nbe a part of the presentation of . . . [Ohio’s] case in chief, . . . experts, [or] other witnesses.”\nCounsel stated that the court “w[ould] hear testimony” about the interests motivating the passage\nof the bills, including fraud. Not only did that never materialize, but, as is apparent from the\nrecord, there is no indication of a legitimate fraud concern at all. The Assistant Secretary of\nState, responsible for managing statewide elections, affirmed upon cross-examination that the\npossibility of this particular voter fraud is “infinitesimal” and would not have been “an\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691           Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.             Page 24\n\n\nappropriate justification” for SB 205’s perfection requirement.        None of the officials who\ntestified from nearly a quarter of Ohio’s boards of elections were even asked whether requiring\nperfection on the birthdate field would combat mail-in absentee-voter fraud. At the court’s own\nprodding, several answered questions related to fraud. The few who could relate instances of\nfraud identified none relating to the specific interest now asserted. This suggests that the fraud\ninterest does not offset the burden of technical perfection on the identification envelope’s address\nand birthdate fields.\n\n       Ohio also asserts an interest in standardizing its identification-envelope requirements.\nAchieving uniform standards across eighty-eight autonomous county boards of elections is a\ncommendable goal. A court weighing that interest, however, must ask, “Standardization to what\nend?” For example, a standardized ballot may increase public confidence in the integrity of the\nelectoral process. See Crawford, 553 U.S. at 235 (Souter, J., dissenting). According to Ohio,\nSB 205’s perfection requirement “increases efficiency and predictability.” First Br. 32.\n\n       In support, Ohio cites just two pieces of evidence. During his testimony, the Assistant\nSecretary of State stated that before the implementation of SB 205, the birthdate field was “a\nrequired element on the [identification envelope, but] was not a required element for the Board to\ndetermine the validity of the ballot.” Although true, that statement does not address whether that\ndistinction was thought by anyone to make election administration less efficient. Ohio also\npoints to a report of the OAEO advising that requiring mail-in voters to complete the address and\nbirthdate fields, among other measures, would “allow election officials to more efficiently\nprocess mail-in absentee ballots.” However, that document was silent with regard to in-person\nabsentee ballots. Moreover, it was not a recommendation to reject ballots containing technical\nerrors, and so cannot support the argument that a uniform rejection standard increases efficiency.\n\n       Nor does Ohio’s interest in uniformity “make it necessary to burden” the right to vote\nwith a technical-perfection requirement. Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434 (citation omitted). Even\nbefore SB 205, Ohio law instructed boards of elections on the information to include in absentee-\nvoter identification envelopes. See Ohio Rev. Code § 3509.04(B) (2013). It would seem that the\nsimple act of amending that provision to more comprehensively describe the information that\nidentification envelopes should contain would have been a less roundabout way to uniformity—\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691               Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.                       Page 25\n\n\nand would not have needlessly disenfranchised voters. In addition, Ohio publishes a lengthy\nmanual for election officials with extensive instructions on how to apply its statutory election\nprovisions. It includes a “Reasons to Reject an Absentee Ballot” section. Ohio could include\ninstructions explaining the steps that officials should take to positively identify voters before\ndetermining that an identification envelope is sufficient or insufficient. Instead, the legislature\nenacted a measure that forces elections boards to reject some identifiable ballots. We cannot find\nthat Ohio’s stated interests outweigh the burden that the field-perfection requirement places on\nabsentee voters.\n\n        Limit on Poll-Worker Assistance. The burden imposed by demarcating the types of\nassistance that election officials may render voters is minimal. In most cases, poll-worker\nassistance will not fix the errors that result in the rejection of absentee and provisional ballots.\nAs discussed, most rejected provisional ballots were not counted because the applicant was not\nregistered at all or tried to vote in a precinct where her or she was not registered. Domestic\ncivilian absentee ballots were usually rejected just for being submitted late—sixty-three percent\nof rejected ballots in 2014 and over eighty percent in 2015. All voting requirements inevitably\nencumber some people more than others. Yet Ohio specifically ensures that voters at the greatest\nrisk of making mistakes in marking their ballots—blind, disabled, and illiterate individuals—\nreceive help if it is requested. The onus is on the voter to make the request, but that hardly\nimpinges the right to vote. Any burden is borne only by those who can but do not ask for help or\nmake easily avoidable errors in marking their ballots.\n\n        Ohio’s legitimate interest in minimizing election-official mistakes by ensuring that they\nare not overburdened and do not fill in others’ personal information justifies the limitation\nplaced on poll-worker assistance.12 Because Ohio asserts a legitimate interest, this minimally\nburdensome regulation does not amount to an unconstitutional abridgment of the right to vote.\n\n\n\n        12\n            Although not argued by Ohio on appeal, states have an important interest in managing poll-workers’\ninteraction with voters to protect ballot secrecy and prevent coercion. See, e.g., Burson v. Freeman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112736\"><a href=\"/opinion/112736/burson-v-freeman/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n206 (1992) (plurality opinion) (“[A]ll 50 States, together with numerous other Western democracies . . .

Husted, et al.            Page 26\n\n\n       Cure-Period Reduction. As discussed, on the basis of the record, reducing from ten to\nseven the number of days for correcting absentee-ballot errors and presenting provisional-ballot\nidentification imposes a trivial burden on Ohio voters. There is no evidence of the magnitude of\nthe burden and at least one board official testified that few voters even used the final three cure-\nperiod days.\n\n       That minimal burden on voting is easily outweighed by Ohio’s interest in reducing the\nadministrative strain felt by boards of elections before they begin to canvass election returns.\nThe official canvass must begin eleven to fifteen days after Election Day. Ohio Rev. Code.\n§ 3505.32(A). The possibility of unforeseeable post-election issues thrust upon boards is a\nlegitimate concern. Building in a three-day buffer between the cure period and the official\ncanvass is a common-sense solution. Although, as the district court noted, none of the board\nofficials who testified indicated that the ten-day cure period inconvenienced them, a state\ncertainly need not wait for an election issue to arise before enacting provisions to avoid it. See\nMunro v. Socialist Workers Party, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111780\"><a href=\"/opinion/111780/munro-v-socialist-workers-party/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">189</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 195–96 (1986). Federal law does require that\nvoting equipment give voters the opportunity to correct errors before their ballots are cast and\ncounted. See 52 U.S.C. § 21081(a)(1)(A)(ii) (Supp. II Vol. III 2015). But no case mandates any\nparticular length of time that states must provide after Election Day for voters to cure ballot\nerrors. Given the negligible impact of the cure-period reduction on voters, Ohio’s reasonable\nresponse to a foreseeable problem is not an undue burden.\n\n       B.

Arguable differences in how elections boards apply uniform statewide\nstandards to the innumerable permutations of ballot irregularities, although perhaps unfortunate,\nare to be expected, just as judges in sentencing-guidelines cases apply uniform standards with\narguably different results. In fact, that flexibility is part and parcel of the right of “local entities,\nin the exercise of their expertise, [to] develop different systems for implementing elections.” Id.\nat 109.

Because of the\npossibility that discriminatory intent is an underlying motivation, courts must undertake a\n“sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available.”\nIbid.

Nor do the technical-perfection\nrequirements that SB 205 and SB 216 impose on absentee and provisional voters rise to an\nexceptional level of unfairness comparable to grossly non-uniform procedure or significant voter\ndisenfranchisement.\n\n       We also find unconvincing the appellees’ contention that the district court denied their\nprocedural-due-process claim “without addressing its merits.” Second Br. 75.

Conclusion\n\n       We AFFIRM the entry of judgment for the plaintiffs on their equal-protection undue-\nburden claim as it relates to the requirement that boards of elections reject mail-in and in-person\nabsentee ballots for failure to complete the identification envelope’s address and birthdate fields\nwith technical precision. Therefore, we AFFIRM its permanent injunction of the portions of\nSB 205 that amend Sections 3509.06(D) and 3509.07 of the Ohio Revised Code. See S.B. 205,\n130th Gen. Assemb. (Ohio 2014), at 9–12.\n\n       To be perfectly clear, this remaining injunction does not impede the legitimate interests\nof Ohio election law. The versions of Sections 3509.06(D) and 3509.07 that existed before the\nenactment of SB 205 (and that the injunction effectively reinstates) were altogether serviceable.\nNothing in our opinion prevents election officials from rejecting absentee ballots whose\nidentification envelopes contain “insufficient” information. Ohio Rev. Code. § 3509.07 (2013).\nThe Secretary can and should continue to instruct the boards of elections on implementing those\nprovisions in order to further the interest of uniformity and to provide guidance on the steps\nboards should take to identify absentee voters before deeming an identification envelope\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691            Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v.

But in doing so, it must act to further\nimportant State interests if its proposed changes burden Ohioans’ right to vote.\n\n       We deeply respect the dissent’s recounting of important parts of the racial history of our\ncountry and the struggle for voting rights, and we agree that this history may always be\nappropriately borne in mind.       However, that history does not without more determine the\noutcome of today’s litigation over voting practices and methods. The legal standards we must\nfollow are set out in the cases we discuss concerning the standards embodied in the Fourteenth\nAmendment and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. With respect to the dissent’s discussion\nregarding factual findings, this opinion does not quarrel with the district court over its recitation\nof the record or of any credibility determinations made by the district court. Rather, our holding\nis that the district court’s legal conclusions from that record are in certain parts erroneous, as set\nforth in this opinion, and in light of other parts of the record that the court did not consider.\n\n       For reasons stated, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court on the remaining\nundue-burden claims and the VRA Section 2 claims. We AFFIRM the entry of judgment for\nOhio on all other claims.\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691           Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.

By denying the\nmost vulnerable the right to vote, the Majority shuts minorities out of our political process.\nRather than honor the men and women whose murdered lives opened the doors of our democracy\nand secured our right to vote, the Majority has abandoned this court’s standard of review in order\nto conceal the votes of the most defenseless behind the dangerous veneers of factual findings\nlacking support and legal standards lacking precedent. I am deeply saddened and distraught by\nthe court’s deliberate decision to reverse the progress of history. I dissent.\n\n       In 2014, Ohio enacted Senate Bills 205 and 216, which (1) required county elections\nboards to reject the ballots of absentee and provisional voters whose identification envelopes or\naffirmation forms, respectively, contained an address or birthdate that did not exactly match\nvoting records; (2) reduced the number of post-election days for absentee voters to cure\nidentification-envelope errors, and the number of days for provisional voters to present valid\nidentification, from ten days to seven days; and (3) restricted the ways in which poll workers can\nhelp in-person voters. After conducting a twelve-day trial and authoring a 112-page opinion\nbrimming with sound factual findings and legal conclusions, the district court (Judge Algenon L.\nMarbley) justly held that all of the challenged provisions imposed an undue burden on the right\nto vote and violated plaintiffs’ equal protection rights.\n\n       In complete abandonment of the clearly erroneous standard of review, the Majority\ndisplaces several of the district court’s well-reasoned and supported factual findings.        The\nMajority’s decision to gut the factual findings of the district court and to advance legal standards\nwithout precedent in order to shut the most vulnerable out of the political process must be\nsubjected to the natural antiseptic of sunlight. The unfettered right to vote is the bedrock of a\nfree and democratic society—without it, such a society cannot stand. This right is fundamental.\nIt is the most valuable right a person possesses, because without it, all other rights are\nmeaningless. As history has shown time and time again, laymen and jurists alike have actively\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691                 Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.                        Page 32\n\n\nworked to deny the right to vote to minorities, in both obvious and obscure ways. The Voting\nRights Act (“VRA”),1 sought to right this wrong by allowing all citizens—unrestrained—to\nexercise their right to vote regardless of race. While the VRA and Equal Protection Clause\nsought to bring this nation forward, closer to a society free of racial discrimination, today the\nMajority’s opinion takes us several steps back. Because the Majority has completely ignored the\napplicable standard of review and has instead engaged in its own fact finding and reweighing of\nthe evidence in complete disregard for the clearly erroneous standard of review, because the\nMajority has created a legal standard in contradiction to existing case law based on a concurring\nopinion and dictum, and because the Majority has dishonored the struggle for the right of the\nmost vulnerable to vote, I dissent. I would instead affirm the district court in full.\n\n                                                BACKGROUND\n\n         A. Historical Background\n\n                    1. The Martyrdom and Struggle for Equal Protection\n\n         The Majority’s actions must be viewed in full light of their historical context. The\nmurders of countless men and women who struggled for the right to vote and equal protection\ncannot be overlooked. The utter brutality of white supremacy in its efforts to disenfranchise\npersons of color is the foundation for the tragedy that is the Majority’s effort to roll back the\nprogress of history. I will not forget. I cannot forget—indeed America cannot forget—the pain,\nsuffering, and sorrow of those who died for equal protection and for this precious right to vote.\nI add the following publicly available historical statements to humanize the struggle for the right\nto be equal participants in the democratic process. While the Majority aptly notes that these\nhistorical statements do not dictate the outcome of this case, it is imperative that we assess the\nefforts to undermine the right to vote as an historical operative that did not begin with the\nMajority’s opinion and unfortunately will not end with it.2\n\n\n         1\n             52 U.S.C.A. § 10301 et seq.\n         2\n           I give full context to the legal analysis of the issues presented in this case as well as full historical\ncontextualization of the facts. The following pictures and synopses cannot capture the full horror of those who lost\ntheir lives in the quest for equal protection and voting rights. The following is a mere fraction of the martyrs of the\nstruggle for equality.

The Election of the United States’ First Black President\n\n         Another important historical occurrence that cannot be separated from efforts to abridge\nminorities’ right to vote is the election of the United States’ First Black President. On February\n10, 2007, then-Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, an African American, announced his candidacy\nfor the United States Presidency.54 On November 4, 2008, President Obama became the first\nAfrican-American President of the United States.                    President Obama not only captured the\npresidency, but under his leadership, the Democratic party gained control of the House, the\nSenate and the White House for the first time since 1995.55 On April 4, 2011, President Obama\nannounced his reelection for the presidency.56 On November 6, 2012, President Obama was re-\nelected President of the United States.57\n\n         B. Factual Background\n\n                    1. The Parties58\n\n         Plaintiff, “The Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless” (“NEOCH”), advocates on\nbehalf of the Cleveland homeless, airing and addressing issues related to their lack of housing,\nemployment, and health care.                About seventy percent of NEOCH’s in-person homeless\napplicants are African American.               Promoting voting among its members, and among the\nhomeless county-wide, is central to NEOCH’s mission, and NEOCH’s executive director, staff,\nand volunteers expend substantial resources on voting activities in even-numbered years.\nExecutor Director Brian Davis “spends as much as 80 hours per week around the voting\n\n\n         54\n              Adam Nagourney & Jeff Zeleny, Obama Formally Enters Presidential Race, New York Times, Feb. 11,\n2007.\n         55\n              Id.\n         56\n              Chris Cillizza & Emi Kolawole, President Obama Announces Reelection Bid, Washington Post, April 4,\n2011.\n         57\n              David A.

I have highlighted many of those findings here; however, I\ndirect attention in particular to the district court’s finding regarding the Senate Factors, which I also incorporate\nherein.

The homeless\n       constituents of NEOCH and CCH face challenges that hinder them from asserting\n       their own rights, including mental illness and/or addiction, difficulty maintaining\n       a regular address or phone number, limited access to transportation, and illiteracy\n       or lack of education. They also find it challenging to gain entrance to courtrooms\n       and public buildings due to lack of ID, and many homeless people have a negative\n       relationship with the judicial system or hesitate to get involved in litigation to\n       assert their rights because they are more focused on meeting their immediate\n       needs.\n\nHusted, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3166251</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7 (citations omitted).\n\n       Of the NEOCH homeless members who have voted in primary elections, about eight vote\nin the Democratic primary for each one who votes in the Republican primary. Id. In describing\nthe impact of SB 205 and SB 216, the district court made the following findings of fact:\n\n       [E]ight to ten percent of those living in shelters across Cuyahoga County are\n       absolutely illiterate, and the majority read at only a fourth-grade level. Davis\n       feared that the complexity of the form, along with SB 205’s provisions\n       demanding that voters fill out the required fields completely and accurately . . .\n       increased the risk of NEOCH’s members being disenfranchised. In his twenty\n       years working with the homeless, Davis has noticed that homeless persons have\n       pervasive and profound problems filling out the forms. Not being able to read or\n       fill out forms correctly is embarrassing and humiliating for many of NEOCH’s\n       members, and they hesitate to ask for help. NEOCH’s practice with other\n       government forms, such as those relating to Social Security disability and\n       Medicaid benefits, is to read the forms aloud and fill them out on the homeless\n       person’s behalf as a matter of course.\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691            Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v.

Sixty percent of homeless people in shelters in Columbus are African American.\nBecause of the challenged laws, CCH will explain new voting requirements to homeless persons\nat meetings, publishing articles about the requirements, and train its members to educate other\nhomeless persons.\n\n        Plaintiff, Ohio Democratic Party (“ODP”), is a political party consisting of 1.2 million\nmembers; it seeks to advance the interests of the Democratic Party.59\n\n        Defendant Secretary of the State of Ohio functions as Ohio’s chief election officer. Ohio\nRev. Code §§ 3501.04, 3501.05. The State of Ohio is an Intervenor.\n\n                2. Voting in Ohio\n\n        Absentee Voting. Since 2006, all registered voters have the option to vote absentee\nwithout any excuse. To receive an absentee ballot, a voter must provide to the Board of the\ncounty in which he or she will vote an application consisting of: (1) the voter’s driver’s license\nnumber; (2) the voter’s last four digits of their social security number (“SSN-4”); and (3) an\napproved form of identification. If these requirements are met, the voter receives an absentee\nballot; if these requirements are not met, the voter is notified of the deficiency.\n\n        A voter may do “in-person absentee voting”—i.e., vote in-person at their county Board\nduring certain days and hours—or, “mail-in absentee voting.” When mailing the form to the\nBoard, the voter must sign and include in the envelope an affirmation declaring the voter is\neligible to vote, and if the voter did not provide a driver’s license number or SSN-4, the voter\nmust provide an acceptable form of identification or current state or federal documents that show\nthe name and address of the voter. If there is an error in any of the five fields, the Board mails a\nForm 11-S, specifying the type of error and informing the voter that the ballot will not be\ncounted unless certain steps are taken—namely, returning the Form 11-S by a certain time.\n\n\n        59\n        The Service Employees International Union (“SEIU”) is also a plaintiff in this matter. SEIU joined\nNEOCH in initiating the original action against the Secretary in 2006.\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691            Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.              Page 47\n\n\n        Provisional Voting. Voters who cannot confirm eligibility—and so cannot cast a regular\nballot—can complete a provisional ballot. This allows the voter to cast provisionally, “subject to\nlater verification.” This type of voting is available to several categories of voters.\n\n            3. Challenged Laws\n\n            SB 205 - changes to absentee voting procedures\n\n        SB 205 mandates that an ID envelope is considered incomplete if the voter does not fill\nout the five fields of required information (“five-fields requirement”): (1) name; (2) residence\naddress; (3) date of birth; (4) signature; and (5) some form of ID, which includes the types of\nacceptable ID required for the absentee ballot application form. If these requirements are not\nmet, the voter will receive a written notice informing them of the nature of the defect and that\nfurther information must be provided for the ballot to be counted. Before enactment of SB 205,\nthe information contained in the five fields was merely requested, not required. Pursuant to SB\n205, if the information is missing, the ballot “shall not be counted.”\n\n        The information must be provided no later than the seventh day after the election. This\nopportunity to cure—i.e., “cure period”—was longer before the enactment of SB 205; voters had\nten days rather than seven days to furnish the information.\n\n        SB 216 - changes to provisional voting procedures\n\n        Before enactment of SB 216, voters were required to provide only their names, IDs, and\nsignatures in the provisional ballot affirmation form. Pursuant to SB 216, provisional voters\nmust also provide the date of birth and current address. SB 216 also requires voters to print their\nnames on the provisional ballot envelope. Section 3505.182(F) of the provision already imposed\na “completeness requirement.” Section 3505.181(F) provides that persons filling out provisional\nballots may receive help, but only if they declare to an election official that they are unable to fill\nout the ballot due to blindness, disability, or illiteracy.\n\n                4. The Lead-Up to SB 205 and SB 216\n\n        Following the 2010 election, control of the Ohio House of Representatives switched from\nthe Democratic to the Republican Party. “Rather quickly” after that change in leadership, House\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691           Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.             Page 48\n\n\nRepublicans introduced two bills: (1) a bill to require all Ohioans to show a photo ID when\nvoting and (2) House Bill 194 (“HB 194”), an expansive election-law bill that included “a\nnumber of restrictions on voting, including the restrictions that we see in [SBs 205 and 216].”\nRepresentative Kathleen Clyde, Ohio General Assemblyperson, testified that the debate over HB\n194 was “very partisan and hostile” and “very quick.” HB 194 was ready for the Governor’s\nsignature within two months of its introduction, which Representative Clyde testified marks a\nsignificantly shorter time period than usual for the passage of legislation of such complexity.\nHusted, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3166251</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *13.\n\n       In August 2012, in an unprecedented move, the Ohio legislature voted to repeal HB 194\nafter hundreds of thousands of Ohioans signed petitions to place it on the ballot for a statewide\nreferendum in November 2012. Sixteen other bills proposing voting restrictions were introduced\nin the 2013-2014 General Assembly, eight of which passed. One bill was passed to shorten the\nwindow to gather signatures for referenda, which made it more difficult for citizens to put a\nreferendum on the ballot. Another bill was passed making it easier to purge voters from the\nregistration rolls. Senate Bill 238, which eliminated the first week of the early voting period,\nalso was enacted. Other bills were introduced, but not passed, which would have limited voting\nin the following ways: shortening the early voting period to 14 days; eliminating early voting\nhours; limiting the mailing of absentee ballot applications to voters and preventing the paying of\nreturn postage on absentee ballot envelopes; instituting a photo-ID requirement; and requiring\nstate universities to provide in-state tuition rates to students if they provided those students with\nID that they needed to vote.\n\n       None of the proponents of SB 205 cited voter fraud as a justification for the bill.

During the floor debate of SB 205, in contrast to most proposed\nlegislation, there was no data or testimony offered about the need for the measures proposed in\nSB 205. Id. During committee debate, Representative Matt Huffman, speaking in favor of SB\n205, asked “should we really be making it easier for those people who take the bus after church\non Sunday to vote.” Id. With respect to both SB 205 and SB 216, Democratic legislators spoke\nabout their concerns that the provisional and absentee ballots of African-American voters would\nbe thrown out disproportionately.

Page 49\n\n\n       As to the cure period, one Board official testified that before the challenged laws went\ninto effect, voters did come in during the eighth, ninth, and tenth days of the cure period to cure\ntheir provisional and absentee ballots. Because the Board can receive absentee ballots up until\nten days after Election Day, yet the cure period is only seven days, some voters to whom the\nBoard sends a Form 11-S notifying them of their need to cure their ballot will not receive it in\ntime to do so. Id. at *17.\n\n               5. Information Requirements\n\n       The vast majority of NEOCH’s individual homeless members plan to participate in the\n2016 general election. Many of CCH’s members also plan to vote. Many of the organization’s\nmembers are illiterate, barely literate, and/or mentally ill. A CHH witness testified that without\nassistance, a homeless person could not complete the entire form and that due to the complexity\nand amount of print on the form, some homeless people would just tear it up and say, “you\nknow, to hell with it.” Forms that are, in the words of one Board official, “pretty complex,” with\n“a lot of wording, a lot of stuff crammed into” them, can confuse even educated, literate voters.\n\n               6. Prohibition Against Poll-Worker Assistance\n\n       The district court found that the prohibition against poll-worker assistance burdens\npersons with low literacy, particularly if they are embarrassed to reveal their illiteracy due to the\nstigma it entails. Plaintiffs introduced ample evidence that many of their members fall into this\ncategory and that illiteracy or low literacy levels are prevalent among the homeless. Homeless\nvoters suffer disproportionately from disabilities, including mental illness, which can also\nhamper their ability to fill out forms. About a third of the homeless individuals with whom\nNEOCH works have a mental disability, forty-five to fifty percent read at a fourth-grade level,\nand eight to ten percent are completely illiterate. They may write poorly and have handwriting\nthat is difficult to read or, due to mental illness, they struggle to focus on basic tasks without\nhelp. All of these issues combine to create difficulties for homeless voters in filling out forms\nwithout assistance like the absentee ID envelope and the provisional ballot affirmation.\nMoreover, NEOCH Executive Director Brian Davis testified that in his experience with voter\nmobilization of homeless people in 2014, Board staff members were more hesitant to engage\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691           Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.             Page 50\n\n\nwith voters and offer help when it appeared to be necessary and that homeless voters have been\nmore likely to make mistakes because of the lack of help. Secretary Husted failed to conduct any\nreview or testing of the effect of the provisional ballot affirmation or the absentee identification\nenvelope on voters with low literacy, despite a suggestion to do so from the League of Women\nVoters.     In sum, the district court concluded that many homeless people face vexing and\nprofound obstacles in exercising the basic right to vote, and the prohibition against poll-worker\nassistance is likely to exacerbate the problem.\n\n                                                  ANALYSIS\n\n          A.

Indeed, the district court’s findings of facts were the product of several years of\nlitigation and a twelve-day bench trial. The findings alone span over fifty pages in length. The\nfindings are supported by statistical, empirical, and testimonial evidence after research was\nconducted regarding thousands of voters over several years of voting cycles. These findings of\nfact are critical to analyzing the claims brought pursuant to the Voting Rights Act and the Equal\nProtection Clause. Some of the most relevant findings of the district court are as follows:\n\n              Across all even-numbered election years, minorities use provisional\n               ballots more often than whites, and in presidential election years, the\n               absentee ballots and provisional ballots of minority voters are more likely\n               to be rejected than those of white voters.\n              African-Americans were hindered from participating in the political\n               process.\n              Ohio has a history of racially discriminating voting laws.\n              Racially polarized voting in Ohio is extensive.\n              There are racialized appeals in politics.\n              African-Americans are still not represented well in the most important and\n               visible elected statewide posts.\n              There is a lack of responsiveness to the particularized needs of African-\n               American voters.\n\n       Yet, the Majority largely ignores these findings and instead applies a de novo standard of\nreview. While the Majority asserts that it is not applying a de novo standard of review, careful\nreview of the Majority opinion reveals that it indeed does. For instance, the Majority took note\nof the district court’s conclusion that “African-American voters are more likely than white voters\nto have their absentee or provisional ballots rejected.” “A district court’s conclusion that a\nchallenged electoral practice has discriminatory effect is a question of fact subject to review for\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691                Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v.

Yet, the Majority\ndisagreed with this factual finding merely because it sees the record differently. The Majority\nfails to demonstrate (or even assert) that the district court’s factual findings are not “plausible in\nlight of the entire record.” See Roskam Baking Co., 680 F.3d at 633 (“If the district court’s\naccount of the evidence is plausible in light of the entire record, this court may not reverse that\naccounting, even if convinced that, had it been sitting as trier of fact, it would have weighed the\nevidence differently.”) (emphasis added). The Majority did exactly what the Supreme Court has\nrepeatedly said we cannot do, “reverse the finding of the trier of fact simply because it . . . would\nhave decided the case differently.” See Anderson, 470 U.S. at 573. The clear error standard of\nreview “plainly does not entitle a reviewing court to reverse the finding of the trier of fact simply\nbecause it is convinced that it would have decided the case differently.” Id. We must be mindful\nthat because we are a court of appellate review, we do not decide factual issues de novo. See id.\n“Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder’s choice between them\ncannot be clearly erroneous.”60 Id. at 574.\n\n         Because the standard of review is the lens through which courts analyze a particular\nissue, the Majority’s application of the incorrect standard infects its entire analysis. I cannot join\nthe Majority in its blatant disregard for the standards that guide this court.\n\n         B. Because the Majority applied the wrong standard of review – engaging in a de\n            novo review of the facts – and because the district court did not clearly err in\n            finding that SB 205 and 216 disparately impacted African American voters, the\n            district court’s findings of fact and legal conclusions on Plaintiffs’ VRA claims\n            should be affirmed.\n\n         The Supreme Court has instructed that the Voting Rights Act “should be interpreted in a\nmanner that provides ‘the broadest possible scope’ in combating racial discrimination.” Chisom\n\n         60\n           Clear error review also applies “to the district court’s finding that the [regulations impose] . . . a burden\non African Americans’ right to vote in Ohio.” Ohio Democratic Party v.

In vote-denial cases, courts conduct a two-part analysis. See League of Women Voters\nof N.C. v.

First, a court determines whether a\npractice or procedure has a disparate impact on a minority group. See Thornburg v.

Second, if it finds disparate impact, the court assesses whether the\n“electoral law, practice, or structure interacts with social and historical conditions to cause an\ninequality in the opportunities enjoyed by black and white voters to elect their preferred\nrepresentatives.” Id. at 47.      In applying the test, the court considers “the totality of\ncircumstances.” 52 U.S.C. § 10301(b).\n\n               1. Disparate Impact\n\n       Here, the district court did not commit clear error in finding “SB 205 and SB 216 have a\ndisproportionate impact on African-American voters in Ohio, creating greater risk of\ndisenfranchisement of African-Americans than whites.” Husted, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3166251</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *47.\nThe district court further concluded that “[t]he burdens imposed on voters by the five-field\nrequirement, the prohibition on poll-worker assistance, and the reduced cure period fall more\nheavily on African-Americans than whites.” Id.\n\n       The Majority contravenes a clearly erroneous standard of review by reweighing and\nreassessing the evidence to reach the conclusion that African American’s are not disparately\nimpacted by the new legislation. After years of litigation, a twelve-day trial, and painstakingly\ncombing the record, the district court found that Dr. Timberlake’s data on disparities in\nprovisional and absentee ballot usage and rejection rates reveal that higher minority population\nshare is correlated to higher rates of absentee ballot rejection and provisional ballot usage and\nrejection. Husted, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3166251</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *47. In support of its conclusion, the district court\ncited the following findings of fact:\n\n       [T]he Court credits Dr. Timberlake’s findings that: (1) in the presidential election\n       years of 2008 and 2012, where minority turnout was higher than during typical\n       midterm elections, minorities’ absentee ballots were rejected at a higher rate than\n       whites’; (2) in 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014, minorities cast provisional ballots at a\n       higher rate than whites; [This finding is also corroborated by studies upon which\n       Dr. Timberlake relied that showed that African-American voters use provisional\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691            Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.            Page 54\n\n\n        ballots at a higher rate than white voters nationwide. (See Timberlake Rebuttal\n        Rpt., P-1195 at PTF-243.)] and (3) in 2008, 2010, and 2012, minorities had\n        higher rates of rejection of provisional ballots than whites.\n\nHusted, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3166251</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *48 (emphasis added).\n\n        The district court therefore concluded that “because of the passage of the challenged\nlaws, African-American voters are more likely than white voters to have their absentee or\nprovisional ballots rejected.”     Id.   Despite the district court’s well-reasoned findings, the\nMajority reinterprets and reweighs the evidence to conclude that Dr. Timberlake’s findings do\nnot support the conclusion that minorities are disparately impacted by the challenged laws.\n\n        In so doing, the Majority makes much of the decrease in the use of absentee ballots in the\n2012 and 2014 elections. However, again the Majority avers where the district court directly\naddressed the argument in a manner that was not clearly erroneous. Totally disregarding the\ndistrict court’s factual determinations and explanations, the Majority discounts the district court’s\nexplanation for the decrease in absentee ballots:         “Plaintiffs presented evidence that the\ngubernatorial election was significantly less competitive in 2014 than in 2010, that overall\nturnout was lower in 2014 than 2010. Husted, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3166251</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *48. Given this plausible\nexplanation, the district court did not clearly err.\n\n        Further, under either standard of review, the Majority’s analysis still falls short. The\nMajority’s reasons for rejecting the district court’s factual findings are unavailing because the\nreasons suffer from at least three major analytical flaws. First, the Majority misinterprets the\nevidence. Second, the Majority fails to apply a totality of the circumstances standard. Third, the\nMajority errs in its conclusion regarding the undue burden.\n\n        First, the Majority misinterprets the evidence. For example, the Majority reasons as\nfollows:\n\n        [T]here is scant evidence in the record that minority voters are more likely to cast\n        absentee ballots than white voters. It would therefore be illogical to infer that\n        rejecting absentee ballots for failure to accurately complete address and birthdate\n        fields disproportionately affects minority voters without some other evidence that\n        minority voters are less likely to fulfill that requirement. And . . . the vast\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691            Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.               Page 55\n\n\n       majority of absentee-ballot rejections are for reasons other than those challenged\n       here.\n\n       By relying on the “scant evidence” that minority voters are more likely to cast absentee\nballots than white voters, the Majority again misses the mark. While evidence that minorities\navail of a voting practice more frequently than whites can support a Section 2 claim, it is not a\nnecessary component for such a claim; minority voters may only show that they are more likely\nto have their ballots rejected than white voters because of the new requirements, which means\nthey have “less opportunity than” white voters to exercise their right to vote. See Chisom,\n501 U.S. at 395.\n\n       Second, the Majority applies the wrong legal test by considering the impact of each\nindividual legislative change, rather than considering the disproportionate impact that the new\nOhio voting requirements have on minorities as a whole. The Majority engages in a piecemeal\nfreeze frame approach to the evidence finding that each new requirement alone in a vacuum does\nnot meet the standard for disparate impact. Even faced with evidence that minority absentee\nballots are rejected more frequently than white absentee ballots, the Majority asserts that this\ndistinction means nothing unless there is “some other evidence” that minority voters are less\nlikely to correctly fill out the birthdate and address requirements. The Majority’s requirement\nthat the plaintiff must establish the disproportionate impact of each requirement imposes too\ngreat a burden. This approach does not comport with Section 2’s mandate to consider the\n“totality of the circumstances.” Indeed, at least one circuit has cautioned against the very\napproach the Majority takes here. See League of Women Voters of North Carolina v. North\nCarolina, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">769</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 245 (4th Cir. 2014).\n\n       In League of Women Voters, the challenged house bill contained several new “electoral\nmechanisms.”       Id. at 242.    That house bill, among other things, “imposed strict voter\nidentification requirements, cut a week off of early voting, prohibited local election boards from\nkeeping the polls open on the final Saturday afternoon before elections, and eliminated same-day\nvoter registration.” Id. at 228. The district court analyzed each challenged electoral mechanism\nseparately. Id. at 242. But the Fourth Circuit criticized the district court for “inspecting the parts\nof [the] [bill] as if they existed in a vacuum.” Id. at 242. Specifically, the district court “failed to\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691             Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.               Page 56\n\n\nconsider the sum of those parts and their cumulative effect on minority access to the ballot box.”\nId.   “Doing so is hard to square with Section 2’s mandate to look at the ‘totality of\ncircumstances.’” Id. (emphasis added) (quoting 52 U.S.C. § 10301(b)). We should be mindful\nthat “a panoply of regulations, each apparently defensible when considered alone, nevertheless\nhave the combined effect of severely restricting participation . . . .” Id. (quoting Clingman v.\nBeaver, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142896\"><a href=\"/opinion/142896/clingman-v-beaver/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">581</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 607–08 (2005) (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in the\njudgment)).      The Majority’s approach creates the incentive for state legislatures to pass\nnumerous electoral mechanisms so that courts are forced to put on blinders when it comes to\nunderstanding the combined effect of these mechanisms.\n\n          Third, the Majority errs in its conclusion regarding the undue burden. The Majority\nstates that no undue burden exists because there was no evidence that voters received additional\npoll-worker assistance before the new requirements. However, disparate impact does not require\nsuch exact mathematical quantification. It is enough that there is a high likelihood of such\nassistance being needed given the interplay of structural inequalities with the challenged\nprovisions as the district court correctly found under the governing standard. The Majority has\nnot and cannot cite any legal precedent for such exacting standards, numbers, or data—nor\nshould any be required. The Majority acknowledges that race is not recorded on ballots, but uses\nthis absence of required information to make the self-invalidating argument that finding racial\nimpact is impossible. This deft maneuver again contravenes the standard of review. Such\nreasoning and stealth of hand sets a very dangerous precedent.\n\n          I, therefore, dissent from the Majority’s finding that the district court erred in finding that\nthe Plaintiffs satisfied the first prong of their vote denial claim—disparate impact—and would\naffirm.\n\n                 2.

The district court made findings on all but the fourth factor.\nI summarize below.\n\n       Analyzing factors one and three together, the district court noted the strong history of\n“Ohio’s racially discriminatory voting laws.” Although the district court noted the history of\nOhio’s racially discriminatory voting practices from several decades ago, it also discussed recent\ndiscriminatory bills passed after the 2008 election.\n\n       As to the second factor, the district court noted that exit polls from Ohio voters in the\n2012 presidential election suggest significant and substantial patterns of racially polarized\nvoting. “Approximately, 41% of white voters and 96% of African-Americans reported voting for\nPresident Barack Obama—an enormous differential.”\n\n       As to the fifth Senate factor, the district court noted the barriers faced by African\nAmericans to participation in the political process. Indeed, the district court noted that persistent\nlevels of discrimination faced by African Americans in “employment, housing, income,\neducation and health.”\n\n       As for factor six, the district court found that there are racialized appeals in politics in\nOhio. Such appeals “serve to discourage or dissuade minority voters and prospective candidates\nby reinforcing the message that they simply do not belong in the political process and/or by\nmobilizing white voters in a particular direction by playing on insidious, sometimes explicit and\nsometimes implicit, stereotypes.”        The district court further cited as examples racialized\nstatements made by public officials and referred to disparaging commercials.\n\n       Nor was the district court convinced that there was minority representation in Ohio\n(factor seven). As an example, no African American presently holds the position of Governor,\nLieutenant Governor, Attorney General, Auditor, Secretary of State, and State Treasurer.\nAfrican Americans have occupied each of these positions only five times in the history of the\nState. Until recently, and for the first time in sixty years, the Governor’s twenty-six-person\ncabinet was entirely white.\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691             Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.            Page 59\n\n\n          As to factor eight, the district court found that not many of the “socioeconomic disparities\nhave improved in recent years,” demonstrating Ohio’s lack of responsiveness to the\nparticularized needs of African-American Ohioans. Disparities in unemployment have remained\nsteady as well. Finally, as to factor nine, the district court found that Ohio’s primary justification\nfor the challenged laws at issue is that the they improve “election administration,” but those\njustifications were tenuous.\n\n          Because Ohio does not challenge any of the district court’s factual findings pursuant to\nGingles on appeal, those factual findings are binding on this panel.

Accordingly, I would affirm the\ndistrict court’s holding with respect to the Section 2 Voting Rights Act claim.\n\n          Furthermore, I would affirm the district court’s findings with respect to both prongs of\nthe vote denial claims as they apply to the restrictions on poll workers and the reduced time to\ncure. In support of its findings of vote denial on the poll worker restrictions and the reduced\ntime to cure, the district court stated the following:\n\n          Because low literacy levels are also correlated with substandard education\n          (Timberlake Tr., Vol. 5 at 73), and the Court has credited Dr. Timberlake’s\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691            Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.          Page 60\n\n\n       findings that African-Americans suffer from lower educational attainment than\n       whites in Ohio, the Court concludes that African-Americans would also suffer\n       from higher costs associated with the five-field requirement and the prohibition\n       on poll-worker assistance because they would face disproportionately more\n       challenges filling out the forms. Because African-Americans move more\n       frequently than whites, they may be more likely to be forced to vote provisionally.\n       (Id. at 67-68; see also Hood Tr., Vol. 10 at 121, 124.) They are also more likely\n       to be homeless. (Davis Tr., Vol. 4 at 186.) And because they are more likely to\n       have inflexible schedules or lack access to a car, they are more likely to be\n       burdened by a shorter cure period for absentee and provisional ballots.\n       (Timberlake Tr., Vol. 5 at 61-62.) All of these effects of discrimination against\n       African-Americans combine to create an inequality in their opportunities to\n       participate in the political process.\n\nHusted, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3166251</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *52.\n\n       Given these structural inequalities and the impact of the poll worker restrictions and the\nshortened cure period, the district court did not clearly err.\n\n       C. The Majority Fundamentally Misunderstands the Concept of Disparate Impact\n\n       Additionally, the Majority fundamentally misunderstands the concept of disparate\nimpact. A particular practice has a disparate impact on persons of a protected class when that\npractice has a “disproportionate” impact on the members of the protected class. See, e.g.,\nAlexander v. Local 496, Laborers’ Intern. Union, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764161\"><a href=\"/opinion/764161/davine-alexander-plaintiffs-appelleescross-appellants-96-3858-v-local/\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">394</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 419 (6th Cir. 1999) (“In a so-\ncalled ‘disparate impact’ case, the plaintiffs need not prove that the defendant intended to\ndiscriminate; instead, plaintiffs must prove that a particular [] practice, although neutral on its\nface, has caused a disproportionate adverse effect on a protected group.”) (emphasis added);\nChrisner v. Complete Auto Transit, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"389256\"><a href=\"/opinion/389256/25-fair-emplpraccas-484-25-empl-prac-dec-p-31669-mary-r-chrisner/\"><span class=\"volume\">645</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1251</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1257 (6th Cir. 1981).\n\n       In some instances, after simply counting the number of persons affected by the new Ohio\nvoter identification laws, without making any comparisons between minority and non-minority\nvoters to assess the disproportionality of those numbers, the Majority concludes that the voting\npractices in Ohio do not have a disparate impact because only a small number of voters are\naffected by the new laws. Disproportionality, by definition, requires assessing racial disparities.\nSee Alexander, 177 F.3d at 419 (noting that “statistical evidence is not absolutely essential in\nproving a disparate impact case,” but there “must be proof of disparity using the proper standards\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691                Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.                       Page 61\n\n\nof comparison”). By relying on the sheer number of voters affected by the law in isolation,\nwithout making any relevant comparisons, the Majority fails to engage in any disparate impact\nanalysis at all. The Majority merely engaged in a counting exercise that gets us nowhere in\nterms of analyzing the discriminatory impact of a rule or practice.\n\n         Next, the Majority concludes that “[a] law cannot disparately impact minority voters if its\nimpact is insignificant to begin with.” The text of the Voting Rights Act itself proves this\nstatement to be false. Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act provides, in relevant part, that a\nviolation is established if:\n\n         . . . based on the totality of circumstances, it is shown that the political processes\n         leading to nomination or election in the State or political subdivision are not\n         equally open to participation by members of a class of citizens protected by\n         subsection (a) in that its members have less opportunity than other members of\n         the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of\n         their choice.\n\nChisom v. Roemer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112629\"><a href=\"/opinion/112629/chisom-v-roemer/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">380</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 395 (1991) (quoting Sect. 2, Voting Rights Act). Tellingly, the\nMajority cites no legal authority for the proposition that in order for a practice to be\ndiscriminatory, its “impact” must also be “significant.” Quite simply, a violation of Section 2 of\nthe Voting Rights Act does not turn on whether people are being discriminated against in\n“significant” numbers, it turns on whether minorities have “less opportunity than” non-minorities\nto vote. See id.62 Moreover, although the ballots of minorities and the homeless may be\ninsignificant to the Majority, they are not insignificant to the basic principles of the VRA, which\ndoes not require a certain number of affected persons, but looks instead at the impact on\nminorities as compared to non-minorities.\n\n         D. The Majority Applies the Wrong Legal Standard for the Equal Protection Claim\n\n         With respect to the Equal Protection Clause claim, I agree with the Majority’s implicit\nrejection of Ohio’s argument that rational-basis review applies.                      I further agree that the\nAnderson/Burdick balancing test applies instead. But the Majority’s application of the test\n\n         62\n            Further, the impact of SB 205 and 216 was certainly significant enough for the Ohio legislature to take\naction, for legislators to invest the time and energy in getting the laws passed, in defending a claim in a twelve-day\ntrial, and absorbing the time of this court on appeal. The Majority’s claim that the impact of the new legislation is\ninsignificant is belied by reality.\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691               Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.                       Page 62\n\n\ncannot be reconciled with Sixth Circuit precedent. The Majority takes issue with the district\ncourt’s consideration of the burdens imposed by the challenged provisions on NEOCH’s and\nCCH’s homeless members. The Majority relies in part on Justice Scalia’s concurrence in\nCrawford v. Marion Cty. Election Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145813\"><a href=\"/opinion/145813/crawford-v-marion-county-election-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2008), which states that “what petitioners\nview as the law’s several light and heavy burdens are no more than the different impacts of the\nsingle burden that the law uniformly imposes on all voters.” See Crawford, 553 U.S. at 205\n(Scalia, J. concurring in judgment) (second emphasis added). The Majority then proceeds to\n“consider the burden that the provisions place on all Ohio voters.” (Emphasis added).\n\n        The Majority’s approach is incorrect. In Crawford, a plurality of the Supreme Court held\nthat an Indiana statute that required citizens voting in person on election day or casting in person\na ballot before election day was constitutional.

The Majority, as a result, applies the wrong standard.                 Under the Majority’s\napproach, no longer must we inquire as to how a voting regulation affects different groups of\npeople—something I thought was the cornerstone of equal-protection jurisprudence. Instead, we\nmust inquire whether a voting regulation burdens everyone, and only when it does, will that\nregulation be deemed unequal. This conclusion defies both logic and common sense.\n\n        Even if simple logic did not counsel against the Majority’s approach, then our circuit\nprecedent surely does. See OFA, 697 F.3d at 431. In OFA, the challenged regulation in effect\nreduced the number of days available for in-person voting by three days. Id. This court\nconcluded that the district court did not clearly err in finding that “early voters, who have\ndisproportionately lower incomes and less education than election day voters,” were burdened by\nthe challenged regulation. Id. Put another way, this court studied the impact of the challenged\nlaw on certain groups. See id. Quite simply, despite the Majority’s assertions that a law must\nimpact everyone for it to violate the Equal Protection Clause, Crawford does not dictate or\nmandate such an analytical framework.\n\n        In sum, I would use the Anderson/Burdick balancing test to examine whether Ohio’s\ninterests outweigh the burdens imposed on Ohioan homeless individuals64 on the basis of the\nthree new requirements: (1) the birthdate and address forms requirement; (2) the reduction in the\ncure period; and (3) the restrictions on poll-worker assistance. As to the first requirement, the\nMajority and I are in agreement that the address and birthdate forms requirement violates the\nEqual Protection Clause, even though I disagree with the Majority’s analytical approach in\n\n\n        64\n           The district court found that approximately 60% of the homeless persons in shelters in Columbus, Ohio\nare African American and approximately 70% of NEOCH’s in-person homeless applicants are African American.\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691               Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.                     Page 64\n\n\nreaching that conclusion.         Nevertheless, because the first requirement is not a point of\ncontention, I focus on the remaining two.\n\n        Reduction in cure period. The district court ruled that the reduction of the cure period,\nfor absentee voters, would be “especially burdensome for voters with low literacy who may need\nto seek assistance in reading the Form 11-S65 and filling it out before returning it to the Board.”\nThus, “[l]imiting the window in which they may cure a deficient ballot imposes a significant\nburden on homeless, impoverished, and illiterate voters.”66 Husted, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3166251</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *39.\nFor provisional voters, “the opportunity to cure . . . ballots is limited to providing ID that they\nfailed to provide when they voted . . . .” Id. at 18.\n\n        Ohio characterizes the limitation as an “inconvenience” that does not constitute a burden.\nOhio cites numerous testimonies indicating that few individuals avail of the cure-period in any\ncase, and further, “Plaintiffs identified no person harmed by the three-day difference.” In\nproffering an interest, Ohio states that the reduction serves to provide a “workable stopping point\nbefore election officials must begin the official canvas” eleven days after Election Day. The\ndistrict court was not persuaded by the interest. “Of the twenty-one Board officials who testified\nat trial, not one indicated that he or she had experienced any inconvenience or increased cost\nduring the pre-2014 ten-day cure period, or stated that the county Board needed extra time\nbetween the conclusion of the cure period and the start of the canvass to address any particular\nmatters.” No board official mentioned any “specific task[] that needed to be conducted between\nthe end of the cure period and the beginning of the canvass.”\n\n        Ohio contends that because the cure period was rarely used, reduction of that period was\njustified. But that argument cuts the other way—if that period was rarely used, then it would not\nmatter if the cure period remained at ten days rather than at seven days. Given that no board\nofficial testified that a “specific task” needed to be conducted before the canvas, it appears that\nOhio has not struggled to cope with a ten-day cure period. In these circumstances, Ohio has not\n\n        65\n           If there is an error in any of the five fields on an absentee ballot, the Board mails a “Form 11-S,”\nspecifying the type of error and informing the voter that the ballot will not be counted unless certain steps are\ntaken—namely, returning the Form 11-S by a certain time.\n        66\n           Notably, it is unclear what channels the homeless individuals would use to receive the Form 11-S in the\nmail in time to cure the defect because these individuals are often transient with no fixed address.\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691           Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.             Page 65\n\n\nshown that its interest outweighs the burdens imposed. See OFA, 697 F.3d at 434 (“With no\nevidence that local boards of elections have struggled to cope with early voting in the past, no\nevidence that they may struggle to do so during the November 2012 election, and faced with\nseveral of those very local boards in opposition to its claims, the State has not shown that its\nregulatory interest in smooth election administration is ‘important[.]’”). It should be noted that\ndefendant bears the burden of justification. Because the defendant failed to meet even the\nminimum threshold of that burden, the district court did not clearly err.\n\n       The Majority says that there is no need for Ohio to wait for a problem to arise in the last\nthree days of the cure period in order to act; however, that analysis misses the point. If there was\nno problem in the last three days, the action lacks any justification under any standard of review.\nLacking any justification, the district court’s findings were simply not erroneous.\n\n       Prohibition against poll-worker assistance.         We must “weigh the character and\nmagnitude of the asserted injury to the” protected rights against “the precise interests put forward\nby the State as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule.” See Burdick v. Takushi,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112743\"><a href=\"/opinion/112743/burdick-v-takushi/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">428</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 434 (1992). The district court made careful factual findings that Plaintiffs’\nconstituents were illiterate, barely literate, or suffering from disability or mental illness, which\nlimited their ability to complete basic voting-related tasks. Although it is true that illiterate and\ndisabled workers may receive assistance in filling out the form, an official testified that “Board\nstaff members were more hesitant to engage with voters and offer help when it appeared to be\nnecessary.” Thus, in light of the district court’s crediting this testimony, the district court’s\nfinding that the limitation of poll-worker assistance was burdensome is not clearly erroneous.\nThe district court then found lacking the State’s justifications for preventing poll workers from\nassisting voters who do not affirmatively ask for help because they are illiterate or disabled.\nHusted, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3166251</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *39. The district court’s findings were not clearly erroneous.\n\n       A close reading of the Majority’s opinion reveals that the Majority’s calibrations are\nmisaligned. On the one hand, the Majority concludes that because there is no evidence of voter\nfraud, Ohio’s asserted interest in protecting against voter fraud does not outweigh the burden\nplaced on the voters by the address and birthdate requirements. Yet in the same breath, the\nMajority concludes that “Ohio’s legitimate interest in minimizing election-official mistakes by\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691                Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.                          Page 66\n\n\nensuring that they are not overburdened and do not fill in others’ personal information justifies\nthe limitation placed on poll-worker assistance” even though there is no evidence that the poll\nworkers were overburdened or that there were problems with others filling in personal\ninformation.67\n\n         Moreover, the Majority reiterates that the impact on voters is small and insignificant.\nHowever, the Majority fails to cite any legal precedent that mandates a certain mathematical\nquantum because none is required. Furthermore, the complete lack of sensitivity and unbridled\nprivilege with which the Majority exercises its view of the trivial is exactly what led to the\nconstitutional and statutory protections at issue in this case. Still further, as I have stated\nthroughout this dissent, the stakes of these proceedings are hardly small, insignificant, or trivial;\ninstead, the impact is worthy of countless hours of the Ohio congressional time, energy, and\nefforts in not only passing these restrictive measures, but defending them. The rush to set forth\nand pass these measures belies any claim that what is at stake is slight, minor, unimportant,\ntrifling, trivial, insignificant, inconsequential, negligible, nugatory, or infinitesimal. Similarly,\nthe Majority continues to point out that the vast Majority of challenged ballots are struck for\nreasons that do not involve SB 205 and 216; however, our inquiry is the impact on those voters\nwhose ballots SB 205 and 216 does disparately affect.\n\n         In sum, because I conclude that the burdens of the challenged laws outweigh the\ngovernment’s purported interests under the Anderson/Burdick balancing test, I would affirm the\ndistrict court’s judgment in favor of Plaintiffs with respect to the Equal Protection Clause claim.\n\n                                                 CONCLUSION\n\n         The Majority applies the wrong legal tests, misapprehends the basic concept of\ndisproportionality, and applies the wrong standard of review. Most disturbingly, the Majority\nsubstitutes its own view of the record for the carefully decided and supported factual findings of\nthe district court. As the Supreme Court has cautioned, a “reviewing court oversteps the bounds\nof its duty . . . if it undertakes to duplicate the role of the lower court.” Anderson, 470 U.S. at\n\n         67\n           While the state “need not justify its laws with ‘elaborate, empirical verification,’” Citizens for Legislative\nChoice v. Miller, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754565\"><a href=\"/opinion/754565/citizens-for-legislative-choice-a-michigan-non-profit-corporation-michigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">916</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 924 (6th Cir. 1998), the state does need to assert a real and “precise” interest against\nwhich the citizens’ right to vote must be weighed. See Burdick v. Takushi, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112743\"><a href=\"/opinion/112743/burdick-v-takushi/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">428</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 434 (1992).\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691           Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.               Page 67\n\n\n573. “The trial judge’s major role is the determination of fact, and with experience in fulfilling\nthat role comes expertise.” Id. at 574. “[P]arties to a case on appeal have already been forced to\nconcentrate their energies and resources on persuading the trial judge that their account of the\nfacts is the correct one; requiring them to persuade three more judges at the appellate level is\nrequiring too much.” Id. at 575. Today, the Majority disregards the Supreme Court’s well-\nestablished principles and substitutes its own view of the record for the carefully decided and\nsupported factual findings of the district court.\n\n       The birth of this Nation was founded upon the radical principle that we, as a people,\nwould govern ourselves. And voting is the ultimate expression of self-government. Instead of\nmaking it easier for all persons, unrestrained and unfettered, to exercise this fundamental right to\nvote, legislators are making it harder. States are audaciously nullifying a right for which our\nancestors relentlessly fought and—in some instances—even tragically died. From that struggle\ncame the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and later, the Voting Rights\nAct. It is this court’s responsibility to enforce both the Constitution and the statute, and thereby\nsafeguard this precious right to vote. In my opinion, the Majority has failed to do just that. The\nMajority takes the position that unless a rule affects non-minorities, it does not run afoul of the\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This baffling position distorts the Equal\nProtection Clause so much so that the clause becomes unrecognizable, unenforceable, and\nfundamentally, unequal. For years, states have been (both stealthily and overtly) erecting hurdles\nto the right to vote. And the votes of those who are actually able to surmount those hurdles are\noften diluted through Gerrymandering.          These states’ actions of implementing rules and\nredrawing districts in an effort to restrict minorities’ access to the ballots is another reminder that\nhistory repeats itself. It is yet another reminder that many people hold the misguided belief that\nonly the privileged majority should be granted access to political power and adequate\nrepresentation.\n\n       With every gain in equality, there is often an equally robust and reactive retrenchment.\nWe must never forget that constant dialectical tension. For every action, there is a reaction. The\nMajority’s decision is a fateful reminder that we can never fool ourselves into believing that we\nhave arrived as a nation. Our decision today, and more decisions like this one, will undoubtedly\n\fNos. 16-3603/3691           Northeast Ohio Coalition, et al. v. Husted, et al.            Page 68\n\n\nshape the future of this Nation because deciding who gets to vote inevitably affects who will\nbecome our leaders—a determination that is grounded in the principles long cherished and long\npursued by our Founding Fathers. This is exactly why so many are actively seeking to etch away\nat the right to vote in assembly halls across this nation. These efforts are hardly insignificant or\nnegligible. They are, for their proponents, necessary and highly deliberate. It is my hope that\nwhen future generations look back on these decisions, they conclude that we were on the right\nside of history. But today I fear that we were not.\n\n       For these reasons, I cannot concur with my colleagues in full. In the interest of clarity, I\nwould affirm the district court and permanently enjoin the enforcement of portions of SB 205\nand 216 that: require boards to reject the ballots of absentee and provisional voters who do not\naccurately complete the address and birthdate fields; reduce the cure period to seven days;\nprohibit most forms of poll-worker assistance; and require provisional voters to print their names\non the affirmation form.\n\f</pre>",
