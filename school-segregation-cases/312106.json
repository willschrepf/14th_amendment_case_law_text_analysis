APPELLATE DIVISION\n________________________\n\n           Argued May 13, 2014 – Decided June 5, 2014\n\n           Before Judges Reisner, Ostrer and Carroll.\n\n           On appeal from the State of New Jersey, New\n           Jersey   Juvenile  Justice  Commission  and\n           Department of Corrections.\n\n           Laura Cohen argued the cause for appellant\n           Y.C. (Rutgers Criminal and Youth Justice\n           Clinic, attorneys; Ms. Cohen, on the brief).\n\n           Joseph   M.   Micheletti,    Deputy   Attorney\n           General, argued the cause for respondent New\n           Jersey   Juvenile   Justice   Commission   and\n           Department of Corrections (John J. Hoffman,\n           Acting Attorney General, attorney; Melissa H.\n           Raksa, Assistant Attorney General, of counsel;\n           Alex J. Zowin, Deputy Attorney General, on\n           the brief).\n\n           The opinion of the court was delivered by\n\nREISNER, P.J.A.D.\n\n    This   case    is   a    sequel   to   State    of   New   Jersey   in   the\n\nInterest of J.J., 427 N.J. Super. 541 (App. Div. 2012), in which\n\nwe invalidated the Juvenile Justice Commission's then-existing\n\fregulations for transferring juveniles to adult facilities run\n\nby the Department of Corrections (DOC), and directed the agency\n\nto adopt new regulations.        Id. at 558; see N.J.A.C. 13:91-2.1.\n\nIn   this   appeal,   Y.C.,   who    was     adjudicated       delinquent     as   a\n\njuvenile and sentenced to the custody of the Juvenile Justice\n\nCommission (JJC or agency) for a term of six years, challenges a\n\ndetermination of the JJC transferring him to an adult prison.1\n\nWe conclude that the agency's adoption of an \"interim policy\" on\n\ntransfers did not comply with our direction in J.J., or with the\n\nAdministrative   Procedures     Act       (APA),    N.J.S.A.      52:14B-4.     See\n\nN.J.S.A. 52:14B-4(d) (\"No rule hereafter adopted is valid unless\n\nadopted in substantial compliance\" with the APA).                       We remand\n\nthis matter to the JJC for a new transfer hearing, which shall\n\nbe held before the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) on an\n\nexpedited    basis.     We    also    direct       the   agency    to   adopt   new\n\nregulations within 180 days.\n\n                                      I\n\n      By way of background, in 1995, the Legislature authorized\n\nthe JJC to transfer to adult prisons certain juveniles who met\n\ncriteria set forth in the statute:\n\n            The commission and the Commissioner of the\n            Department of Corrections shall, consistent\n            with applicable State and federal standards,\n\n1\n  On October 29, 2013, we denied a stay of the transfer but\naccelerated this appeal.\n\n\n                                       2                                  A-1030-13T2\n\f            formulate a plan setting forth procedures\n            for transferring custody of any juvenile\n            incarcerated in a juvenile facility who has\n            reached the age of 16 during confinement and\n            whose continued presence in the juvenile\n            facility threatens the public safety, the\n            safety of juvenile offenders, or the ability\n            of the commission to operate the program in\n            the manner intended.\n\n            [N.J.S.A. 52:17B-175(e) (emphasis added).]\n\nThe Legislature further directed the JJC and the DOC to \"jointly\n\nadopt    regulations    pursuant    to    the   [APA],   establishing     the\n\nprocedures included in the plan.\"         Ibid.\n\n    As    we   noted   in   J.J.,   the   agencies   adopted    regulations,\n\nN.J.A.C. 13:91-2.1, that provided no procedural due process for\n\na juvenile facing transfer.         The State contended that none was\n\nrequired.      J.J., supra, 427 N.J. Super. at 543.            We disagreed,\n\nfinding that the regulation was invalid:\n\n            Because N.J.A.C. 13:91-2.1 provides no due\n            process rights to the juvenile as part of\n            the transfer process, we hold that it is\n            invalid.    It does not comply with the\n            statutory requirement that the transfer\n            procedures be \"consistent with applicable\n            state and federal standards,\" particularly\n            the juvenile's rights to due process.

XIV;   see   Greenberg   v.\n            Kimmelman, 99 N.J. 552, 568 (1985) (Article\n            I,   Paragraph   1   of    the   New   Jersey\n            Constitution \"safeguards values like those\n            encompassed by the principles of due process\n            and equal protection.\").\n\n            [Id. at 558.]\n\n\n\n\n                                      3                             A-1030-13T2\n\f       We rejected J.J.'s alternate arguments that the transfer\n\ndecision should be made by a Family Part judge, and that he\n\ncould not be transferred to an adult prison unless he had a\n\nright to a jury trial in the delinquency adjudication.                 Id. at\n\n553, 557.     However, we concluded that, \"[a]t a minimum,\" the JJC\n\nmust    provide    a    juvenile   with    the   following      due   process\n\nprotections:\n\n             [B]efore a juvenile can be transferred to\n             custody of the DOC, there must be written\n             notice of the proposed transfer and the\n             supporting   factual  basis,   an  impartial\n             decision maker, an opportunity to be heard\n             and to present opposition, some form of\n             representation, and written findings of fact\n             supporting a decision to proceed with the\n             transfer.\n\n             [Id. at 557 (footnote omitted).]\n\n       We   did   not   decide   whether   a   juvenile   was   entitled     to\n\nrepresentation by counsel, because the record was inadequate to\n\npermit us to address the issue:\n\n             The record does not reflect whether legal\n             assistance similar to \"counsel substitutes\"\n             or some other form of legal assistance is\n             available in juvenile facilities to assist\n             juveniles in opposing a transfer request.\n             In addition, it is not clear whether\n             transferred juveniles are mixed with the\n             adult population when they are transferred\n             or segregated from adult offenders albeit\n             housed in an adult prison, nor does the\n             record reflect whether or not they continue\n             to receive rehabilitative and other services\n             available to juveniles at JJC facilities.\n             Those factors would inform our consideration\n\n\n\n                                      4                               A-1030-13T2\n\f           of whether there must be representation by\n           counsel.\n\n           [Id. at 557 n.7.]\n\n    We    ordered    that   the    juvenile       be     returned    to   the   JJC's\n\ncustody, and ordered the JJC to revise its regulations before\n\nseeking to re-transfer the juvenile to DOC custody:\n\n           For the reasons set forth above, we reverse\n           the order transferring [J.J.] to the custody\n           of the DOC and order his return to the\n           custody of the JJC. The JJC shall promptly\n           revise   its  regulations   to  provide   an\n           appropriate level of due process consistent\n           with this opinion.     It may then seek to\n           transfer Jones to the custody of the DOC\n           with an appropriate hearing and procedural\n           safeguards.\n\n           [Id. at 558 (emphasis added).]\n\n    In    our   view,   the       above       language     was    unambiguous     and\n\nunequivocal.    The JJC needed to adopt revised regulations before\n\nseeking to transfer juveniles to DOC custody.                     But that did not\n\nhappen.    Instead, on August 1, 2013, the JJC adopted Policy\n\nNumber 13ED:01.30, entitled \"Transfers of Juveniles to DOC –\n\nInterim   Policy.\"      The   interim         policy,     under     which   the   JJC\n\ncontinues to operate, was not promulgated in conformity with the\n\nprocedures required by the APA.               See N.J.S.A. 52:14B-4.            Almost\n\n\n\n\n                                          5                                 A-1030-13T2\n\ftwo   years    after       J.J.     was    decided,         the       agency          still   has   not\n\nadopted regulations.2\n\n      Meanwhile, on October 18, 2013, more than a year after J.J.\n\nwas   decided,      the     JJC     transferred            Y.C.       to        an    adult   prison.\n\nPursuant to the interim policy, he received a hearing before a\n\nJJC hearing officer, but he was denied the opportunity to be\n\nrepresented        by    counsel,     even       though         he        had    an     attorney     who\n\nsought permission to appear.                 The attorney was permitted to file\n\na brief on Y.C.'s behalf, but was not allowed to be present at\n\nthe hearing.            Instead, as provided by the interim policy, Y.C.\n\nwas   represented         at   the    hearing         by        a    non-attorney,            the    JJC\n\nOmbudsman,     an       individual        whom       the    policy          describes         as    \"the\n\nindividual(s) within the Commission responsible for resolving\n\ncomplaints made by juveniles about the facility, the action or\n\ninaction      of    staff      or    any    other          matter          of    concern      to     the\n\njuvenile.\"          According        to    Y.C.,           he       had     no       opportunity      to\n\nintroduce educational and other records designed to show his\n\npositive progress while in JJC custody; only his disciplinary\n\nrecords    and      the    JJC's      institutional                 notes        were    introduced.\n\nFurther, he contends that the Ombudsman failed to present or\n\ncross-examine any witnesses or otherwise act as an independent\n\nand zealous advocate.\n\n2\n  The agency proposed new regulations on August 19, 2013, 45\nN.J.R. 1941(a), but has not adopted them.\n\n\n                                                 6                                            A-1030-13T2\n\f    The   JJC   hearing    officer     determined     that    Y.C.    should   be\n\ntransferred to DOC custody because he had incurred forty-five\n\ndisciplinary charges in the past year, and he belonged to a\n\n\"security threat group.\"         The prior charges included fighting,\n\nattempted or aiding an assault on another juvenile, and throwing\n\nbodily fluids.      Y.C. contended that he was making efforts to\n\nimprove   his   behavior   and   had       not   incurred    any   disciplinary\n\ninfractions for the past four months preceding the hearing.                    The\n\nhearing officer found that due to Y.C.'s disruptive conduct,\n\n\"his continued presence in the juvenile facility threatened the\n\nsafety\" of the JJC staff and other juvenile residents.                         The\n\nhearing   officer   also   found     that    Y.C.'s   behavior       \"undermined\n\nJJC's ability to operate the juvenile facility in a stable, safe\n\nand orderly manner,\" and his involvement in numerous serious\n\ndisciplinary infractions \"impede[d] the effective delivery of\n\nservices because of his constant non-compliant behavior.\"\n\n    The record of this appeal does not provide the information\n\nthat, in J.J., we found necessary to decide whether juveniles\n\nmust have the right to counsel in transfer hearings.                   Moreover,\n\nthere is no transcript or other contemporaneous record of what\n\n\n\n\n                                       7                                A-1030-13T2\n\foccurred at the hearing, beyond a handwritten form and a short\n\nsupplemental decision from the hearing officer.3\n\n                                    II\n\n      On   this    appeal,   Y.C.   raises     a   plethora       of   issues    in\n\nmultiple    points     and   subpoints.         Y.C.     contends      that     the\n\nOmbudsman, who was a JJC employee and not an attorney, was not\n\nan   appropriate     representative.       Analogizing   to   a    case   dealing\n\nwith transfers to mental health facilities, Vitek v. Jones, 445\n\nU.S. 480, 494-95, 100 S. Ct. 1254, 1264-65, 63 L. Ed. 2d 552,\n\n566 (1980), Y.C. argues he was entitled to representation by\n\ncounsel.    He also argues that the JJC hearing officer was not an\n\nimpartial decision-maker.       See N.J.A.C. 13:101-1.3 (disciplinary\n\nhearing officer is a JJC staff member).                  He further contends\n\nthat a juvenile court judge must make the transfer decision, an\n\n\n\n\n3\n  After this appeal was filed, Y.C. filed a motion to supplement\nthe record, largely aimed at documenting positive aspects of his\nbehavior at the JJC facility.   We denied the motion.   However,\nwe note that his motion included a certification attesting that\nsince his transfer to the DOC, he was being held in\nadministrative segregation with an adult roommate, and was not\nbeing provided with educational or other services similar to\nthose available at the JJC.      The JJC filed a certification\nattesting that DOC inmates under age twenty-one are provided\nwith educational opportunities and other services, but stating\nno facts pertaining specifically to Y.C. At most, the\ncertifications created material disputes of fact about the\nconditions afforded juvenile transferees in the adult prison\nsystem.\n\n\n\n\n                                       8                                  A-1030-13T2\n\fargument we previously rejected.               J.J., supra, 427 N.J. Super.\n\nat 557.\n\n      Y.C. contends that the interim policy is invalid because it\n\nwas not adopted as a regulation.            He argues that he could not be\n\ntransferred in the absence of the regulations we directed be\n\nadopted in J.J.       He also argues that, before he pled guilty in\n\njuvenile     court,   he   had    a    right    to   notice     that    he     might\n\neventually be transferred to an adult prison.                   He contends the\n\nJJC did not notify him, at the time he entered JJC custody, that\n\nhe   could   be   transferred     to   adult     prison    as   a   disciplinary\n\nconsequence of violating institutional rules.\n\n      Y.C.   argues    that    the    interim    policy    unduly      limits     the\n\njuvenile's right to present evidence and call witnesses at the\n\nhearing, and does not clearly define what issues the juvenile is\n\nrequired to address.          He also contends that, without access to\n\nhis own institutional records, the right to present evidence at\n\na transfer hearing is meaningless.               In a related argument, he\n\nclaims that the JJC's failure to consider a juvenile's entire\n\nrecord is improper.        And, he claims the proposed regulations go\n\nfurther than the statute in setting forth grounds for a possible\n\ntransfer.     He argues that a threat to security should be the\n\nonly acceptable grounds for a transfer.                   He asserts that the\n\napplicable proof standard for a transfer should be \"clear and\n\nconvincing\"    not    \"substantial     credible      evidence.\"        He    further\n\n\n                                        9                                   A-1030-13T2\n\fcontends    that    a    transcript   or     electronic    recording     of   the\n\nhearing    should   be    required,    and    that   the   hearing     officer's\n\nwritten statement of reasons was inadequate.               Finally, he argues\n\nthat if he can be incarcerated in adult prison, he was entitled\n\nto a jury trial before being adjudicated delinquent, an argument\n\nwe rejected in J.J.\n\n    In its response, the JJC emphasizes that Y.C. is nineteen\n\nyears old, six feet tall, weighs 190 pounds, is a member of a\n\nsecurity threat group, and was adjudicated delinquent for crimes\n\nthat if committed by an adult would have constituted first-\n\ndegree armed robbery.         The JJC claims Y.C. is violent and has\n\nassaulted   other       juveniles   while    at   the   New   Jersey   Training\n\nSchool at Jamesburg and the Juvenile Medium Security Facility at\n\nBordentown.    The JJC also contends that the procedures set forth\n\nin the interim policy were consistent with what J.J. required,\n\nand Y.C. was not entitled to any further due process.\n\n                                      III\n\n    We decline to decide the bulk of the issues Y.C. raises on\n\nthis appeal, because of the lack of an adequate factual record.\n\nMoreover, many of the procedural issues he raises are addressed\n\nby the remedy we order here, i.e., an OAL hearing at which he\n\nwill be represented by counsel.             We also note that some of the\n\nissues J.J. raises here may not be appropriate for decision in\n\nthe context of a disciplinary/transfer case.\n\n\n                                       10                               A-1030-13T2\n\f    For example, Y.C.'s argument that juveniles are entitled to\n\njury trials, may be more appropriately raised in the context of\n\nan appeal in which a juvenile has requested a jury trial and the\n\nrequest has been denied.          See, e.g., State ex rel. A.C., 424\n\nN.J. Super. 252, 253 (App. Div. 2012); but see In re C.B., 708\n\nSo. 2d 391, 400 (La. 1998) (in the absence of the right to a\n\njury trial, a statute providing for the automatic transfer of\n\nseventeen-year-old        juveniles        to      adult     prisons          was\n\nunconstitutional); Monroe v. Soliz, 939 P.2d 205, 208 (Wash.\n\n1997) (finding that juvenile transfer statute did not implicate\n\nthe jury trial right, but juveniles were entitled to due process\n\nprior to transfer).       In this case, Y.C. did not request a jury\n\ntrial in juvenile court, and he pled guilty.                Likewise, he is\n\nnot seeking to withdraw his guilty plea and, hence, this case\n\nmay not be an appropriate vehicle to decide whether he should\n\nhave been notified, prior to his plea, that he could at some\n\npoint be transferred to an adult prison.              See, e.g., State v.\n\nBellamy, 178 N.J. 127, 138-40 (2003).             Further, even if we were\n\ninclined to reconsider issues already decided in J.J., we would\n\nnot do so on this record.\n\n    We   lack    an    adequate   factual    record   to    consider    Y.C.'s\n\nchallenge   to   the    substance     of    the   interim   policy,     and     a\n\nchallenge to the agency's regulations, which have thus far only\n\nbeen proposed, must wait until the regulations are adopted.                    In\n\n\n                                      11                               A-1030-13T2\n\fordering the agency to adopt regulations within 180 days, we\n\ncontemplate that, within a reasonable time, there will be a\n\nvehicle for an appropriate challenge and a record on which to\n\nraise   many    of    the    issues      that     we     are    not       deciding     in   this\n\nappeal.\n\n      We do, however, have no hesitation in concluding that the\n\nagency violated the APA in adopting the interim policy.                                       The\n\npolicy is, in essence, a set of regulations promulgated without\n\nfollowing      the   required      APA     procedures          set       forth   in   N.J.S.A.\n\n52:14B-4.       If    the    JJC       believed    it     had       an    emergent     need   to\n\ntransfer juveniles to adult facilities, it should have adopted\n\nemergency      regulations,        because        J.J.      required        that      it    adopt\n\nregulations before conducting transfers.                            See N.J.S.A. 52:14B-\n\n4(c) (adoption of emergency regulations); Cnty. of Hudson v.\n\nDep't of Corr., 152 N.J. 60, 73 (1997).\n\n      With respect to a remedy in this case, we acknowledge that\n\ntransferring adjudicated juveniles to adult prisons implicates\n\nmultiple significant issues that cannot be decided without an\n\nappropriate record.              For example, we have held that juveniles\n\nare   not   entitled        to    jury    trials       in      juvenile      court,        partly\n\nbecause the goals of the juvenile justice system are primarily\n\nrehabilitative, as opposed to punitive as in the adult criminal\n\njustice     system,    and       the    consequences           of    an    adjudication       of\n\ndelinquency do not include a prison sentence.                              See A.C., supra,\n\n\n                                            12                                         A-1030-13T2\n\f424 N.J. Super. at 255, aff'g 426 N.J. Super. 81 (Ch. Div.\n\n2011).        Additionally,         as     Y.C.'s     counsel    points      out,     when    a\n\njuvenile decides to plead guilty in juvenile court, he or she is\n\nnot notified beforehand that the plea may ultimately result in a\n\ntransfer to an adult prison.\n\n       On     this    appeal,       Y.C.    characterizes        his       transfer    as     a\n\nmassive shift in the conditions of his confinement, and a near-\n\ncomplete deprivation of the rehabilitation opportunities he had\n\nat the JJC.           The JJC asserts that the transfer constitutes a\n\nmere       change    of     \"location      and     housing\"     which       implicates       no\n\nsignificant           due      process        concerns.         Both        sides      offer\n\nrepresentations rather than record evidence in support of their\n\narguments.\n\n       As we noted in J.J., a definitive decision on what process\n\nis due a juvenile before the JJC makes a transfer determination\n\nmay depend on the conditions in which transferred juveniles are\n\nconfined after transfer and the services made available to them.\n\nJ.J.,      supra,     427    N.J.    Super.      at   557     n.7.      Those     important\n\nconsiderations include whether transferred juveniles are housed\n\nwith       adult-sentenced      inmates;         whether      the    juveniles      receive\n\nsimilar rehabilitative services in prison as would be available\n\nin     a    JJC     facility;    and       whether     transfers       are    treated        as\n\npermanent, or whether they are treated as temporary and subject\n\nto   periodic        review,    with     transfer      back     to   the    JJC   being      an\n\n\n                                              13                                    A-1030-13T2\n\foption if the juvenile's behavior improves.                    See Monroe, supra,\n\n939 P.2d at 209 (noting that Washington State regulations permit\n\ntransfer back to a juvenile facility).\n\n     In     this    case,     the   JJC   acted   in    derogation   of    our   J.J.\n\ndecision directing the agency to adopt new regulations before\n\ntransferring juveniles to adult prisons.                      Instead, the agency\n\npromulgated a set of interim policies that were not adopted as\n\nregulations        and   do   not   satisfy     the    APA.     Although   the    JJC\n\neventually proposed new regulations, they still have not been\n\nadopted.4      As a result, the JJC has not created any factual\n\nrecord (e.g., through public comments and the agency's responses\n\nto those comments) to justify the agency's procedures or permit\n\nus to evaluate whether they pass statutory or constitutional\n\nmuster.5\n\n\n4\n  At oral argument, the JJC's counsel advised us that the agency\nhad decided to make changes to the regulations it originally\nproposed and would need to re-propose the regulations with the\nchanges.    Hence, it is premature for us to opine on the\nstandards set forth in the regulations as originally proposed,\nsince those evidently will not be the rules the agency finally\nadopts.\n5\n  We do not rule out the possibility that a challenge to the\nregulations, when they are finally adopted, could require a\nreferral to a trial court to make a complete factual record.\nSee R. 2:5-5(b); J.B. v. N.J. State Parole Bd., 433 N.J. Super.\n327, 330-31 (App. Div. 2013), certif. denied, ___ N.J. ___\n(2014).   We note, for example, that Wilkinson v. Austin, 545\nU.S. 209, 125 S. Ct. 2384, 162 L. Ed. 2d 174 (2005), concerning\nthe due process protections required before an inmate can be\ntransferred to a \"Supermax\" facility, was based on a record\n                                                    (continued)\n\n                                           14                               A-1030-13T2\n\f       The    hearing    process    conducted            by    the    JJC    in   this   case\n\nprovided an inadequate record on which to decide the serious\n\nissues    Y.C.    seeks     to   present       on       this   appeal.        The    hearing\n\nofficer was a JJC employee and thus not a neutral decision-\n\nmaker.       Although Y.C. had an attorney ready, willing and able to\n\nrepresent him, he was instead represented by the JJC Ombudsman,\n\nwho was not an attorney and was not independent of the JJC.                                 And\n\nthe proceeding was not recorded.                    Thus, even if we remanded for\n\na rehearing before the JJC, its current hearing procedures would\n\nbe insufficient to produce a record appropriate for the decision\n\nof   novel     legal    issues.         As   we     noted      in    J.J.,   those     issues\n\ninclude      whether    a   juvenile         has    a    due    process      right     to   be\n\nrepresented by counsel at a transfer hearing. J.J., supra, 427\n\nN.J.     Super.   at     557     n.7.        Because          Y.C.    has    already     been\n\ntransferred to an adult prison, his case will illustrate what\n\nhappens to transferred juveniles in practice, as opposed to in\n\ntheory.      But, as noted, we have no confidence that such a record\n\ncan be made using the JJC's in-house hearing procedures.\n\n       For all of those reasons, we order that the hearing on\n\nremand be conducted by the Office of Administrative Law rather\n\n\n\n(continued)\ncreated at \"an 8-day trial with extensive evidence, including\ntestimony from expert witnesses . . . .\" Id. at 218, 125 S. Ct.\nat 2391, 162 L. Ed. 2d at 187.\n\n\n                                             15                                      A-1030-13T2\n\fthan by a JJC hearing officer.6      At that hearing, Y.C. shall have\n\nthe right to be represented by counsel.           Both sides shall have\n\nthe right to present evidence on these issues:          the reasons why\n\nY.C. should or should not have been transferred to an adult\n\nprison, consistent with the standards set forth in the juvenile\n\ntransfer   statute,     N.J.S.A.     52:17B-175(e);     Y.C.'s        current\n\nconditions of confinement, including whether he is being housed\n\nwith adult-convicted inmates and whether he is being provided\n\nwith   rehabilitative   services     comparable    to   those    he    would\n\nreceive in a JJC facility; and whether, given his history of\n\nconduct at the adult prison, it may be appropriate to transfer\n\nhim back to a JJC facility, even if his initial transfer to an\n\nadult prison was justified.        Because this is, to some extent, a\n\n\n6\n  We find no statutory impediment to the OAL hearing such a case.\nAs an agency \"in, but not of\" the Department of Law and Public\nSafety, N.J.S.A. 52:17B-170, the JJC falls within the definition\nof \"State agency\" contained in the Administrative Procedures\nAct.    N.J.S.A. 52:14B-2.     Moreover, even an agency whose\nhearings ordinarily are not heard before the OAL may make a\n\"specific request\" that an administrative law judge (ALJ) be\nassigned to hear one or more of its contested cases.     N.J.S.A.\n52:14F-8(a).   Those agencies include, for example, the Parole\nBoard.   Ibid.   Hence, there is authority for an ALJ to hear\ncases that ordinarily would be heard by the agency itself, as\nwell as cases that involve a prison inmate or adjudicated\njuvenile, whose hearing may require special security measures.\nSee also J.E. ex rel.

See N.J.S.A.\n\n52:14B-10(c).        Consistent       with       N.J.S.A.    52:17B-175(a),           the\n\nDepartment of Corrections shall provide security during the OAL\n\nhearing,   at    whatever   facility         is     deemed    appropriate         after\n\nconsultation with the OAL.            We direct that the proceedings on\n\nremand be completed within ninety days, unless Y.C. consents to\n\nan extension of time.7          Because the appropriate proof standard\n\nmay be an issue on any further appeal, we direct that the ALJ\n\nmake alternative findings as to whether the JJC proved its case\n\nby clear and convincing evidence and, if not, whether the agency\n\nproved its case by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\n\n\n7\n  Out of deference to the agency's security concerns and based on\nour review of the evidence presented thus far, we are not\nordering that Y.C. be immediately returned to a JJC facility.\nTherefore, the proceedings on remand should be conducted\nexpeditiously. However, we do not want Y.C. to be precluded by\ntime constraints from presenting a complete defense and making a\ncomplete record.\n\n\n\n\n                                        17                                     A-1030-13T2\n\f      We direct the JJC to adopt regulations within 180 days.\n\nUntil the JJC adopts regulations, the JJC may not transfer any\n\nadjudicated juvenile from JJC custody to an adult prison without\n\nan   OAL   hearing   at    which   the    juvenile    has    the   right     to   be\n\nrepresented by counsel.            In response to our inquiry at oral\n\nargument, the JJC's attorney advised us that these types of\n\ntransfers are uncommon and that approximately five juveniles are\n\ntransferred    from       JJC   custody       to   adult    prisons   annually.\n\nTherefore, we anticipate that the interim requirements we impose\n\nin this opinion will not be unduly burdensome or a disruption to\n\nthe JJC's mission.8\n\n      Reversed and remanded.        We do not retain jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n8\n  To address a concern expressed by the JJC at oral argument, we\nemphasize that this opinion is limited to transfers of\nadjudicated juveniles from JJC custody to adult prisons.      It\ndoes not apply to adult inmate disciplinary hearings conducted\nby the Department of Corrections, transfers of adult-convicted\ninmates between DOC facilities, transfers of juveniles from one\nJJC facility to another, or routine JJC disciplinary proceedings\nwhich do not concern transferring a juvenile to an adult\nfacility.\n\n\n                                         18                                A-1030-13T2\n\f",

We remand\n\nthis matter to the JJC for a new transfer hearing, which shall\n\nbe held before the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) on an\n\nexpedited    basis.     We    also    direct       the   agency    to   adopt   new\n\nregulations within 180 days.\n\n                                      I\n\n      By way of background, in 1995, the Legislature authorized\n\nthe JJC to transfer to adult prisons certain juveniles who met\n\ncriteria set forth in the statute:\n\n            The commission and the Commissioner of the\n            Department of Corrections shall, consistent\n            with applicable State and federal standards,\n\n1\n  On October 29, 2013, we denied a stay of the transfer but\naccelerated this appeal.\n\n\n                                       2                                  A-1030-13T2\n\f            formulate a plan setting forth procedures\n            for transferring custody of any juvenile\n            incarcerated in a juvenile facility who has\n            reached the age of 16 during confinement and\n            whose continued presence in the juvenile\n            facility threatens the public safety, the\n            safety of juvenile offenders, or the ability\n            of the commission to operate the program in\n            the manner intended.\n\n            [N.J.S.A. 52:17B-175(e) (emphasis added).]\n\nThe Legislature further directed the JJC and the DOC to \"jointly\n\nadopt    regulations    pursuant    to    the   [APA],   establishing     the\n\nprocedures included in the plan.\"         Ibid.\n\n    As    we   noted   in   J.J.,   the   agencies   adopted    regulations,\n\nN.J.A.C. 13:91-2.1, that provided no procedural due process for\n\na juvenile facing transfer.         The State contended that none was\n\nrequired.      J.J., supra, 427 N.J. Super. at 543.            We disagreed,\n\nfinding that the regulation was invalid:\n\n            Because N.J.A.C. 13:91-2.1 provides no due\n            process rights to the juvenile as part of\n            the transfer process, we hold that it is\n            invalid.    It does not comply with the\n            statutory requirement that the transfer\n            procedures be \"consistent with applicable\n            state and federal standards,\" particularly\n            the juvenile's rights to due process.

The JJC needed to adopt revised regulations before\n\nseeking to transfer juveniles to DOC custody.                     But that did not\n\nhappen.    Instead, on August 1, 2013, the JJC adopted Policy\n\nNumber 13ED:01.30, entitled \"Transfers of Juveniles to DOC –\n\nInterim   Policy.\"      The   interim         policy,     under     which   the   JJC\n\ncontinues to operate, was not promulgated in conformity with the\n\nprocedures required by the APA.

The attorney was permitted to file\n\na brief on Y.C.'s behalf, but was not allowed to be present at\n\nthe hearing.            Instead, as provided by the interim policy, Y.C.\n\nwas   represented         at   the    hearing         by        a    non-attorney,            the    JJC\n\nOmbudsman,     an       individual        whom       the    policy          describes         as    \"the\n\nindividual(s) within the Commission responsible for resolving\n\ncomplaints made by juveniles about the facility, the action or\n\ninaction      of    staff      or    any    other          matter          of    concern      to     the\n\njuvenile.\"          According        to    Y.C.,           he       had     no       opportunity      to\n\nintroduce educational and other records designed to show his\n\npositive progress while in JJC custody; only his disciplinary\n\nrecords    and      the    JJC's      institutional                 notes        were    introduced.\n\nFurther, he contends that the Ombudsman failed to present or\n\ncross-examine any witnesses or otherwise act as an independent\n\nand zealous advocate.\n\n2\n  The agency proposed new regulations on August 19, 2013, 45\nN.J.R. 1941(a), but has not adopted them.\n\n\n                                                 6                                            A-1030-13T2\n\f    The   JJC   hearing    officer     determined     that    Y.C.    should   be\n\ntransferred to DOC custody because he had incurred forty-five\n\ndisciplinary charges in the past year, and he belonged to a\n\n\"security threat group.\"         The prior charges included fighting,\n\nattempted or aiding an assault on another juvenile, and throwing\n\nbodily fluids.      Y.C. contended that he was making efforts to\n\nimprove   his   behavior   and   had       not   incurred    any   disciplinary\n\ninfractions for the past four months preceding the hearing.                    The\n\nhearing officer found that due to Y.C.'s disruptive conduct,\n\n\"his continued presence in the juvenile facility threatened the\n\nsafety\" of the JJC staff and other juvenile residents.                         The\n\nhearing   officer   also   found     that    Y.C.'s   behavior       \"undermined\n\nJJC's ability to operate the juvenile facility in a stable, safe\n\nand orderly manner,\" and his involvement in numerous serious\n\ndisciplinary infractions \"impede[d] the effective delivery of\n\nservices because of his constant non-compliant behavior.\"\n\n    The record of this appeal does not provide the information\n\nthat, in J.J., we found necessary to decide whether juveniles\n\nmust have the right to counsel in transfer hearings.                   Moreover,\n\nthere is no transcript or other contemporaneous record of what\n\n\n\n\n                                       7                                A-1030-13T2\n\foccurred at the hearing, beyond a handwritten form and a short\n\nsupplemental decision from the hearing officer.3\n\n                                    II\n\n      On   this    appeal,   Y.C.   raises     a   plethora       of   issues    in\n\nmultiple    points     and   subpoints.

He also argues that the JJC hearing officer was not an\n\nimpartial decision-maker.       See N.J.A.C. 13:101-1.3 (disciplinary\n\nhearing officer is a JJC staff member).                  He further contends\n\nthat a juvenile court judge must make the transfer decision, an\n\n\n\n\n3\n  After this appeal was filed, Y.C. filed a motion to supplement\nthe record, largely aimed at documenting positive aspects of his\nbehavior at the JJC facility.   We denied the motion.   However,\nwe note that his motion included a certification attesting that\nsince his transfer to the DOC, he was being held in\nadministrative segregation with an adult roommate, and was not\nbeing provided with educational or other services similar to\nthose available at the JJC.      The JJC filed a certification\nattesting that DOC inmates under age twenty-one are provided\nwith educational opportunities and other services, but stating\nno facts pertaining specifically to Y.C. At most, the\ncertifications created material disputes of fact about the\nconditions afforded juvenile transferees in the adult prison\nsystem.\n\n\n\n\n                                       8                                  A-1030-13T2\n\fargument we previously rejected.               J.J., supra, 427 N.J. Super.\n\nat 557.\n\n      Y.C. contends that the interim policy is invalid because it\n\nwas not adopted as a regulation.            He argues that he could not be\n\ntransferred in the absence of the regulations we directed be\n\nadopted in J.J.       He also argues that, before he pled guilty in\n\njuvenile     court,   he   had    a    right    to   notice     that    he     might\n\neventually be transferred to an adult prison.                   He contends the\n\nJJC did not notify him, at the time he entered JJC custody, that\n\nhe   could   be   transferred     to   adult     prison    as   a   disciplinary\n\nconsequence of violating institutional rules.\n\n      Y.C.   argues    that    the    interim    policy    unduly      limits     the\n\njuvenile's right to present evidence and call witnesses at the\n\nhearing, and does not clearly define what issues the juvenile is\n\nrequired to address.          He also contends that, without access to\n\nhis own institutional records, the right to present evidence at\n\na transfer hearing is meaningless.               In a related argument, he\n\nclaims that the JJC's failure to consider a juvenile's entire\n\nrecord is improper.        And, he claims the proposed regulations go\n\nfurther than the statute in setting forth grounds for a possible\n\ntransfer.     He argues that a threat to security should be the\n\nonly acceptable grounds for a transfer.                   He asserts that the\n\napplicable proof standard for a transfer should be \"clear and\n\nconvincing\"    not    \"substantial     credible      evidence.\"        He    further\n\n\n                                        9                                   A-1030-13T2\n\fcontends    that    a    transcript   or     electronic    recording     of   the\n\nhearing    should   be    required,    and    that   the   hearing     officer's\n\nwritten statement of reasons was inadequate.               Finally, he argues\n\nthat if he can be incarcerated in adult prison, he was entitled\n\nto a jury trial before being adjudicated delinquent, an argument\n\nwe rejected in J.J.\n\n    In its response, the JJC emphasizes that Y.C. is nineteen\n\nyears old, six feet tall, weighs 190 pounds, is a member of a\n\nsecurity threat group, and was adjudicated delinquent for crimes\n\nthat if committed by an adult would have constituted first-\n\ndegree armed robbery.         The JJC claims Y.C. is violent and has\n\nassaulted   other       juveniles   while    at   the   New   Jersey   Training\n\nSchool at Jamesburg and the Juvenile Medium Security Facility at\n\nBordentown.    The JJC also contends that the procedures set forth\n\nin the interim policy were consistent with what J.J. required,\n\nand Y.C. was not entitled to any further due process.\n\n                                      III\n\n    We decline to decide the bulk of the issues Y.C. raises on\n\nthis appeal, because of the lack of an adequate factual record.\n\nMoreover, many of the procedural issues he raises are addressed\n\nby the remedy we order here, i.e., an OAL hearing at which he\n\nwill be represented by counsel.             We also note that some of the\n\nissues J.J. raises here may not be appropriate for decision in\n\nthe context of a disciplinary/transfer case.\n\n\n                                       10                               A-1030-13T2\n\f    For example, Y.C.'s argument that juveniles are entitled to\n\njury trials, may be more appropriately raised in the context of\n\nan appeal in which a juvenile has requested a jury trial and the\n\nrequest has been denied.

The\n\npolicy is, in essence, a set of regulations promulgated without\n\nfollowing      the   required      APA     procedures          set       forth   in   N.J.S.A.\n\n52:14B-4.       If    the    JJC       believed    it     had       an    emergent     need   to\n\ntransfer juveniles to adult facilities, it should have adopted\n\nemergency      regulations,        because        J.J.      required        that      it    adopt\n\nregulations before conducting transfers.

For example, we have held that juveniles\n\nare   not   entitled        to    jury    trials       in      juvenile      court,        partly\n\nbecause the goals of the juvenile justice system are primarily\n\nrehabilitative, as opposed to punitive as in the adult criminal\n\njustice     system,    and       the    consequences           of    an    adjudication       of\n\ndelinquency do not include a prison sentence.

Additionally,         as     Y.C.'s     counsel    points      out,     when    a\n\njuvenile decides to plead guilty in juvenile court, he or she is\n\nnot notified beforehand that the plea may ultimately result in a\n\ntransfer to an adult prison.\n\n       On     this    appeal,       Y.C.    characterizes        his       transfer    as     a\n\nmassive shift in the conditions of his confinement, and a near-\n\ncomplete deprivation of the rehabilitation opportunities he had\n\nat the JJC.           The JJC asserts that the transfer constitutes a\n\nmere       change    of     \"location      and     housing\"     which       implicates       no\n\nsignificant           due      process        concerns.         Both        sides      offer\n\nrepresentations rather than record evidence in support of their\n\narguments.\n\n       As we noted in J.J., a definitive decision on what process\n\nis due a juvenile before the JJC makes a transfer determination\n\nmay depend on the conditions in which transferred juveniles are\n\nconfined after transfer and the services made available to them.\n\nJ.J.,      supra,     427    N.J.    Super.      at   557     n.7.      Those     important\n\nconsiderations include whether transferred juveniles are housed\n\nwith       adult-sentenced      inmates;         whether      the    juveniles      receive\n\nsimilar rehabilitative services in prison as would be available\n\nin     a    JJC     facility;    and       whether     transfers       are    treated        as\n\npermanent, or whether they are treated as temporary and subject\n\nto   periodic        review,    with     transfer      back     to   the    JJC   being      an\n\n\n                                              13                                    A-1030-13T2\n\foption if the juvenile's behavior improves.                    See Monroe, supra,\n\n939 P.2d at 209 (noting that Washington State regulations permit\n\ntransfer back to a juvenile facility).\n\n     In     this    case,     the   JJC   acted   in    derogation   of    our   J.J.\n\ndecision directing the agency to adopt new regulations before\n\ntransferring juveniles to adult prisons.                      Instead, the agency\n\npromulgated a set of interim policies that were not adopted as\n\nregulations        and   do   not   satisfy     the    APA.     Although   the    JJC\n\neventually proposed new regulations, they still have not been\n\nadopted.4      As a result, the JJC has not created any factual\n\nrecord (e.g., through public comments and the agency's responses\n\nto those comments) to justify the agency's procedures or permit\n\nus to evaluate whether they pass statutory or constitutional\n\nmuster.5\n\n\n4\n  At oral argument, the JJC's counsel advised us that the agency\nhad decided to make changes to the regulations it originally\nproposed and would need to re-propose the regulations with the\nchanges.    Hence, it is premature for us to opine on the\nstandards set forth in the regulations as originally proposed,\nsince those evidently will not be the rules the agency finally\nadopts.\n5\n  We do not rule out the possibility that a challenge to the\nregulations, when they are finally adopted, could require a\nreferral to a trial court to make a complete factual record.\nSee R. 2:5-5(b); J.B. v.

The    hearing\n\nofficer was a JJC employee and thus not a neutral decision-\n\nmaker.       Although Y.C. had an attorney ready, willing and able to\n\nrepresent him, he was instead represented by the JJC Ombudsman,\n\nwho was not an attorney and was not independent of the JJC.                                 And\n\nthe proceeding was not recorded.                    Thus, even if we remanded for\n\na rehearing before the JJC, its current hearing procedures would\n\nbe insufficient to produce a record appropriate for the decision\n\nof   novel     legal    issues.         As   we     noted      in    J.J.,   those     issues\n\ninclude      whether    a   juvenile         has    a    due    process      right     to   be\n\nrepresented by counsel at a transfer hearing. J.J., supra, 427\n\nN.J.     Super.   at     557     n.7.        Because          Y.C.    has    already     been\n\ntransferred to an adult prison, his case will illustrate what\n\nhappens to transferred juveniles in practice, as opposed to in\n\ntheory.      But, as noted, we have no confidence that such a record\n\ncan be made using the JJC's in-house hearing procedures.\n\n       For all of those reasons, we order that the hearing on\n\nremand be conducted by the Office of Administrative Law rather\n\n\n\n(continued)\ncreated at \"an 8-day trial with extensive evidence, including\ntestimony from expert witnesses . . . .\" Id. at 218, 125 S.

Both sides shall have\n\nthe right to present evidence on these issues:          the reasons why\n\nY.C. should or should not have been transferred to an adult\n\nprison, consistent with the standards set forth in the juvenile\n\ntransfer   statute,     N.J.S.A.     52:17B-175(e);     Y.C.'s        current\n\nconditions of confinement, including whether he is being housed\n\nwith adult-convicted inmates and whether he is being provided\n\nwith   rehabilitative   services     comparable    to   those    he    would\n\nreceive in a JJC facility; and whether, given his history of\n\nconduct at the adult prison, it may be appropriate to transfer\n\nhim back to a JJC facility, even if his initial transfer to an\n\nadult prison was justified.        Because this is, to some extent, a\n\n\n6\n  We find no statutory impediment to the OAL hearing such a case.\nAs an agency \"in, but not of\" the Department of Law and Public\nSafety, N.J.S.A. 52:17B-170, the JJC falls within the definition\nof \"State agency\" contained in the Administrative Procedures\nAct.    N.J.S.A. 52:14B-2.     Moreover, even an agency whose\nhearings ordinarily are not heard before the OAL may make a\n\"specific request\" that an administrative law judge (ALJ) be\nassigned to hear one or more of its contested cases.     N.J.S.A.\n52:14F-8(a).   Those agencies include, for example, the Parole\nBoard.   Ibid.   Hence, there is authority for an ALJ to hear\ncases that ordinarily would be heard by the agency itself, as\nwell as cases that involve a prison inmate or adjudicated\njuvenile, whose hearing may require special security measures.\nSee also J.E. ex rel.
