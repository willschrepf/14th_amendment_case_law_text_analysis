In\n\n2002, Booth was an inmate at Philadelphia’s Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility\n\n(“CFCF”). Booth told CFCF’s Commissioner Leon King that, unless King addressed\n\nseveral outstanding grievances by January 21, 2003, he would file a civil rights suit. On\n\nJanuary 2, 2003, Booth was transferred, at his own request, to Philadelphia’s House of\n\nCorrections (“HOC”). He almost immediately filed a grievance with Rodney\n\nBrockenbrough, HOC’s Deputy Warden, informing him of the deadline imposed on King.\n\nThe week of January 9, 2003, five HOC officers (Harris, Morrison, Worsley, Terry, and\n\nStolle) conducted or became involved with a routine search of Booth’s cell. Booth\n\nconfronted one of the officers who was reading his legal mail. This confrontation led to a\n\nmisconduct charge and the confiscation of property, including religious and legal\n\nmaterial. The punishment was upheld by Administrative Hearing Officer Allison Young.\n\nUpon his release from segregation, most, but not all, of Booth’s property was returned.\n\nBooth alleges another incident where correctional officer Terry read his mail outside of\n\nhis presence.\n\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f       After exhausting his administrative remedies, Booth filed a § 1983 complaint\n\nalleging that, from August 2002 to early January 2003, the defendants denied him access\n\nto the law library and opened his mail outside of his presence, denied him medication for\n\ndiabetes, subjected him to allegedly inhumane prison conditions when he was in\n\ndisciplinary segregation, illegally searched his cell and seized his legal and religious\n\nmaterials, prohibited him from calling witnesses at his disciplinary hearing and failed to\n\nrespond to his grievances, discriminated against him based on his religious beliefs, and\n\nretaliated against him for filing grievances and for threatening to sue the defendants\n\ncivilly. After discovery was completed, the defendants filed motion for summary\n\njudgment, to which Booth responded.\n\n       In 2004, District Judge Brody granted the defendants’ motion for summary\n\njudgment as to all claims except the retaliation claim. Judge Brody ruled that, absent any\n\nevidence of actual injury, the defendants did not deprive Booth of access to the courts by\n\ndenying him access to the law library or in opening his legal mail outside of his presence.\n\nBooth’s Eighth Amendment claims were also ruled to be lacking in merit because there\n\nwas no record evidence as to deliberate indifference to Booth’s health and safety.\n\nFurthermore, Booth’s Eighth Amendment prison conditions claim failed because none of\n\nthe conditions complained of constituted serious denial of the minimally civilized\n\nmeasure of life’s necessities. Judge Brody held that Booth’s illegal search and seizure\n\nclaim failed because he has no Fourth Amendment right with respect to prison cell\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fsearches under Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517 (1984). Booth’s related Fourteenth\n\nAmendment unlawful seizure of property claim also failed because adequate post-\n\ndeprivation remedies were available to Booth. The court held that Booth’s substantive\n\ndue process claim, a conglomerate of all of his other claims, did not amount to\n\n“conscience-shocking” behavior under the Fourteenth Amendment. The court also ruled\n\nthat Booth’s fifteen-day confinement in punitive segregation following disciplinary action\n\ndid not constitute atypical and significant deprivation and thus, did not implicate any\n\nliberty interest under Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472 (1995). As for Booth’s claim of\n\ndiscrimination based on his Muslim beliefs, Judge Brody determined that Booth lacked\n\nstanding to bring the claim based on his sole factual allegation that unnamed correctional\n\nofficers confiscated kufis from other Muslim prisoners, but did not take his.\n\n       The matter was reassigned to District Judge Dalzell after Judge Brody recused\n\nherself. The defendants filed a second motion for summary judgment on the retaliation\n\nclaim, attaching additional briefing and exhibits. Judge Dalzell granted the defendants’\n\nmotion, concluding that, beyond the coincidence of timing, there was no evidence that the\n\nsearch, punishment, and confiscation of property conducted in 2002 and early 2003, were\n\nin retaliation for Booth’s letters to King and Brockenbrough. Booth timely appealed.\n\n       We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291. We exercise plenary review\n\nover the District Court’s orders granting summary judgment. See Pub. Interest Research\n\nGroup of N.J., Inc. v. Powell Duffryn Terminals, Inc., 913 F.2d 64 (3d Cir. 1990).\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fSummary judgment shall be granted when “no genuine issue [exists] as to any material\n\nfact and [when] the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 56(c). We view the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and\n\nwe draw all inferences in that party’s favor. See Reitz v. County of Bucks, 125 F.3d 139,\n\n143 (3d Cir. 1997).\n\n                                              I.\n\n       First, we will address the District Court’s denial of Booth’s motion to amend the\n\ncomplaint to add a new defendant, Captain Lowell. The proposed amended complaint\n\nalleges that Lowell violated Booth’s right to practice his religion when he disciplined\n\nBooth for calling an “Adhan” after the cell count on the evening of April 2, 2003. Booth\n\nasserts that Lowell retaliated against him for practicing his religion and for bringing a\n\nlawsuit against fellow corrections officers by placing Booth in administrative segregation\n\nfor about two weeks in April 2003.\n\n       Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows a plaintiff to amend his\n\ncomplaint once, without leave of court, “at any time before a responsive pleading is\n\nserved...” Booth filed the motion on April 8, 2003, the day he signed the pleading and\n\npresumably submitted it to the prison mail system. At the time he filed the motion to\n\namend, none of the defendants had filed responsive pleadings. Under Rule 15, Booth\n\ncould have filed the amended complaint without the District Court’s permission. Instead\n\nof allowing the amendment, however, the District Court denied Booth’s Rule 15 motion.\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\fWe conclude that the District Court erred in denying Booth’s motion, and thus, we will\n\nvacate the order denying amendment and remand for service of the amended complaint\n\nand further proceedings as to Captain Lowell.\n\n                                            II.\n\n       As for the remaining defendants, we hold that the District Court correctly granted\n\nsummary judgment on all claims, for the reasons fully explained in the District Court\n\nopinions issued in 2004 and 2005.1 Given the District Court’s comprehensive treatment\n\nof Booth’s claims, we will comment briefly only on the Eighth Amendment medical\n\ntreatment and prison conditions claims and the retaliation claim.\n\n       Booth raised three alleged violations of the Eighth Amendment in his Complaint.\n\nHe claimed that he was denied essential medicine, made to sleep in a cell with broken\n\nwindows for fifteen days in disciplinary segregation, and was verbally assaulted and\n\nthreatened by guards. With respect to the deliberate indifference to his medical needs,\n\n“[i]t is well-settled that claims of negligence or medical malpractice, without some more\n\nculpable state of mind, do not constitute ‘deliberate indifference.’” Rouse v. Plantier, 182\n\n\n\n\n       1\n          The District Court rendered its opinion on Booth’s legal mail claim before this\nCourt rendered its decision in Jones v. Brown, 461 F.3d 353 (3d Cir. 2006) (holding that\ninmates have a First Amendment privacy right in their legal mail and that an inmate\nplaintiff need not show actual injury to make out such a claim). Construing Booth’s legal\nmail claim as a First Amendment privacy right claim, we conclude that it fails on\nqualified immunity grounds for the same reasons set forth in Jones. Id. at 364. An\ninmate’s right to privacy in legal mail was not clearly established when the defendants\nopened Booth’s mail outside of his presence in 2002-2003.\n\n                                             6\n\fF.3d 192, 197 (3d Cir. 1999); see also White v. Napoleon, 897 F.2d 103, 108 (3d\n\nCir.1990) (concluding that mere medical malpractice cannot give rise to a violation of the\n\nEighth Amendment). The protections afforded prisoners by the Due Process Clause of\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment are not triggered by the mere negligence of prison officials.\n\nSee Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327 (1986). Likewise, Eighth Amendment liability\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 requires “more than ordinary lack of due care for the prisoner’s\n\ninterests or safety.” Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312, 319 (1986). Only “unnecessary and\n\nwanton infliction of pain” or “deliberate indifference to the serious medical needs” of\n\nprisoners is sufficiently egregious to rise to the level of a constitutional violation. White\n\nv. Napolean. 897 F.2d at 108-09 (quoting Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 103 (1976)).\n\nBooth alleged that after he was given an insulin shot, a guard confiscated his diabetes\n\nmedication for eight and a half hours, but left him with one packet, saying “take this one\n\npack[.] It should do.” Booth does not claim that he was actually put in danger. This\n\nconduct does not establish deliberate indifference.\n\n       Booth’s prison conditions claim also fails. The Eighth Amendment protects prison\n\ninmates from cruel and unusual punishment. See e.g., Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825\n\n(1994). However, not all deficiencies and inadequacies in prison conditions amount to a\n\nviolation of an inmate’s constitutional rights. The Eighth Amendment is violated only\n\nwhere, viewing the totality of the conditions in the prison, the inmate’s conditions of\n\nconfinement, alone or in combination, deprive him of the minimal civilized measure of\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\flife’s necessities. Tillery v. Owens, 907 F.2d 418, 426-27 (3d Cir. 1990). Here, Booth’s\n\ntemporary confinement in a cell with broken windows for fifteen days does not amount to\n\nthe kind of extreme deprivation required to make out a conditions-of-confinement claim.\n\nSee e.g., Peterkin v. Jeffes, 855 F.2d 1021, 1026-27 (3d Cir. 1988) (holding that sleeping\n\non a dirty mattress on the floor does not rise to the level of an Eighth Amendment\n\nviolation); Brookins v. Williams, 402 F.Supp.2d 508 (D.Del. 2005) (finding no\n\nconstitutional violation where, over a period of five days, a pre-trial detainee was placed\n\nin a cell with two other inmates, forced to eat near the toilet, and prohibited from\n\nexercise). Finally, absent any allegation of physical harm, the defendants’ verbal threats\n\ndo not amount to a constitutional violation. See Ivey v. Wilson, 832 F.2d 950, 954-955\n\n(6 th Cir. 1987) (holding that verbal abuse, alone, is not an Eighth Amendment violation);\n\nsee also Balliet v. Whitmire, 626 F. Supp. 219 (M.D. Pa. 1986) (holding that use of\n\nprofane and vulgar language by a state investigator during an interview is not a civil\n\nrights violation), aff’d, 800 F.2d 1130 (3d Cir. 1986) (Table).\n\n       As for the retaliation claim, we agree with the District Court that Booth has failed\n\nto provide any evidence that the parties responsible for searching his cell, confiscating his\n\nproperty, and approving the disciplinary sanction in January 2003, had any knowledge of\n\nthe grievances he filed with prison administrators. Further, the administrators neither\n\ndirected the search and seizure nor had knowledge that the search and confiscation\n\noccurred. While the timing of the incidents appears suspicious, this alone does not create\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\fa showing of retaliation. This is especially true considering that Booth has filed\n\ninnumerable grievances throughout his incarceration, making it less coincidental that an\n\nincident occurred after one of his filings.\n\n       Booth argues on appeal that Judges Brody and Dalzell exhibited bias in favor of\n\nthe defendants, and that the defendants’ second motion for summary judgment was\n\nprocedurally barred. Both judges recused themselves out of an abundance of caution.\n\nBooth does not argue, and we find no evidence on this record, that either judge actually\n\nexhibited bias against Booth or displayed an appearance of impartiality in this case, and\n\nthus, recusal under 28 U.S.C. § 455(a) was not required. In support of his procedural bar\n\nargument, Booth contends that the defendants were prohibited from filing a second\n\nmotion because their first summary judgment motion was granted in part in 2004.\n\nSummary judgment was denied as to the retaliation claim at that time. There is nothing in\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(a) that prevented the defendants from filing a second summary\n\njudgment motion on the retaliation claim where, as here, the motion contained additional\n\naffidavits or other evidence.\n\n       We have thoroughly reviewed the remaining arguments Booth makes on appeal\n\nand find them meritless. Accordingly, we will reverse the District Court’s order denying\n\nBooth’s Rule 15 motion and remand for further consideration by the District Court in\n\naccordance with this Opinion. We will affirm the judgment of the District Court in all\n\nother respects.\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\f",

In\n\n2002, Booth was an inmate at Philadelphia’s Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility\n\n(“CFCF”). Booth told CFCF’s Commissioner Leon King that, unless King addressed\n\nseveral outstanding grievances by January 21, 2003, he would file a civil rights suit. On\n\nJanuary 2, 2003, Booth was transferred, at his own request, to Philadelphia’s House of\n\nCorrections (“HOC”). He almost immediately filed a grievance with Rodney\n\nBrockenbrough, HOC’s Deputy Warden, informing him of the deadline imposed on King.\n\nThe week of January 9, 2003, five HOC officers (Harris, Morrison, Worsley, Terry, and\n\nStolle) conducted or became involved with a routine search of Booth’s cell. Booth\n\nconfronted one of the officers who was reading his legal mail. This confrontation led to a\n\nmisconduct charge and the confiscation of property, including religious and legal\n\nmaterial. The punishment was upheld by Administrative Hearing Officer Allison Young.\n\nUpon his release from segregation, most, but not all, of Booth’s property was returned.\n\nBooth alleges another incident where correctional officer Terry read his mail outside of\n\nhis presence.\n\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f       After exhausting his administrative remedies, Booth filed a § 1983 complaint\n\nalleging that, from August 2002 to early January 2003, the defendants denied him access\n\nto the law library and opened his mail outside of his presence, denied him medication for\n\ndiabetes, subjected him to allegedly inhumane prison conditions when he was in\n\ndisciplinary segregation, illegally searched his cell and seized his legal and religious\n\nmaterials, prohibited him from calling witnesses at his disciplinary hearing and failed to\n\nrespond to his grievances, discriminated against him based on his religious beliefs, and\n\nretaliated against him for filing grievances and for threatening to sue the defendants\n\ncivilly. After discovery was completed, the defendants filed motion for summary\n\njudgment, to which Booth responded.\n\n       In 2004, District Judge Brody granted the defendants’ motion for summary\n\njudgment as to all claims except the retaliation claim. Judge Brody ruled that, absent any\n\nevidence of actual injury, the defendants did not deprive Booth of access to the courts by\n\ndenying him access to the law library or in opening his legal mail outside of his presence.\n\nBooth’s Eighth Amendment claims were also ruled to be lacking in merit because there\n\nwas no record evidence as to deliberate indifference to Booth’s health and safety.\n\nFurthermore, Booth’s Eighth Amendment prison conditions claim failed because none of\n\nthe conditions complained of constituted serious denial of the minimally civilized\n\nmeasure of life’s necessities. Judge Brody held that Booth’s illegal search and seizure\n\nclaim failed because he has no Fourth Amendment right with respect to prison cell\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fsearches under Hudson v. Palmer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111252\"><a href=\"/opinion/111252/hudson-v-palmer/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984). Booth’s related Fourteenth\n\nAmendment unlawful seizure of property claim also failed because adequate post-\n\ndeprivation remedies were available to Booth. The court held that Booth’s substantive\n\ndue process claim, a conglomerate of all of his other claims, did not amount to\n\n“conscience-shocking” behavior under the Fourteenth Amendment. The court also ruled\n\nthat Booth’s fifteen-day confinement in punitive segregation following disciplinary action\n\ndid not constitute atypical and significant deprivation and thus, did not implicate any\n\nliberty interest under Sandin v. Conner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995). As for Booth’s claim of\n\ndiscrimination based on his Muslim beliefs, Judge Brody determined that Booth lacked\n\nstanding to bring the claim based on his sole factual allegation that unnamed correctional\n\nofficers confiscated kufis from other Muslim prisoners, but did not take his.\n\n       The matter was reassigned to District Judge Dalzell after Judge Brody recused\n\nherself. The defendants filed a second motion for summary judgment on the retaliation\n\nclaim, attaching additional briefing and exhibits. Judge Dalzell granted the defendants’\n\nmotion, concluding that, beyond the coincidence of timing, there was no evidence that the\n\nsearch, punishment, and confiscation of property conducted in 2002 and early 2003, were\n\nin retaliation for Booth’s letters to King and Brockenbrough. Booth timely appealed.\n\n       We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291. We exercise plenary review\n\nover the District Court’s orders granting summary judgment. See Pub. Interest Research\n\nGroup of N.J., Inc. v. Powell Duffryn Terminals, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"547478\"><a href=\"/opinion/547478/public-interest-research-group-of-new-jersey-inc-and-friends-of-the-earth/\"><span class=\"volume\">913</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1990).\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fSummary judgment shall be granted when “no genuine issue [exists] as to any material\n\nfact and [when] the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 56(c). We view the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and\n\nwe draw all inferences in that party’s favor. See Reitz v. County of Bucks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746434\"><a href=\"/opinion/746434/angeline-reitz-in-her-own-individual-capacity-as-well-as-the-of-the-estate/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n143 (3d Cir. 1997).\n\n                                              I.\n\n       First, we will address the District Court’s denial of Booth’s motion to amend the\n\ncomplaint to add a new defendant, Captain Lowell. The proposed amended complaint\n\nalleges that Lowell violated Booth’s right to practice his religion when he disciplined\n\nBooth for calling an “Adhan” after the cell count on the evening of April 2, 2003. Booth\n\nasserts that Lowell retaliated against him for practicing his religion and for bringing a\n\nlawsuit against fellow corrections officers by placing Booth in administrative segregation\n\nfor about two weeks in April 2003.\n\n       Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows a plaintiff to amend his\n\ncomplaint once, without leave of court, “at any time before a responsive pleading is\n\nserved...” Booth filed the motion on April 8, 2003, the day he signed the pleading and\n\npresumably submitted it to the prison mail system. At the time he filed the motion to\n\namend, none of the defendants had filed responsive pleadings. Under Rule 15, Booth\n\ncould have filed the amended complaint without the District Court’s permission. Instead\n\nof allowing the amendment, however, the District Court denied Booth’s Rule 15 motion.\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\fWe conclude that the District Court erred in denying Booth’s motion, and thus, we will\n\nvacate the order denying amendment and remand for service of the amended complaint\n\nand further proceedings as to Captain Lowell.\n\n                                            II.\n\n       As for the remaining defendants, we hold that the District Court correctly granted\n\nsummary judgment on all claims, for the reasons fully explained in the District Court\n\nopinions issued in 2004 and 2005.1 Given the District Court’s comprehensive treatment\n\nof Booth’s claims, we will comment briefly only on the Eighth Amendment medical\n\ntreatment and prison conditions claims and the retaliation claim.\n\n       Booth raised three alleged violations of the Eighth Amendment in his Complaint.\n\nHe claimed that he was denied essential medicine, made to sleep in a cell with broken\n\nwindows for fifteen days in disciplinary segregation, and was verbally assaulted and\n\nthreatened by guards. With respect to the deliberate indifference to his medical needs,\n\n“[i]t is well-settled that claims of negligence or medical malpractice, without some more\n\nculpable state of mind, do not constitute ‘deliberate indifference.’” Rouse v. Plantier, 182\n\n\n\n\n       1\n          The District Court rendered its opinion on Booth’s legal mail claim before this\nCourt rendered its decision in Jones v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795519\"><a href=\"/opinion/795519/ronald-c-jones-v-m-brown-internal-affairs-ofc-s-sootkoos-associate/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">353</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 2006) (holding that\ninmates have a First Amendment privacy right in their legal mail and that an inmate\nplaintiff need not show actual injury to make out such a claim). Construing Booth’s legal\nmail claim as a First Amendment privacy right claim, we conclude that it fails on\nqualified immunity grounds for the same reasons set forth in Jones. Id. at 364. An\ninmate’s right to privacy in legal mail was not clearly established when the defendants\nopened Booth’s mail outside of his presence in 2002-2003.\n\n                                             </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span>\n\f<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 197 (3d Cir. 1999); see also White v.

The protections afforded prisoners by the Due Process Clause of\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment are not triggered by the mere negligence of prison officials.\n\nSee Daniels v. Williams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111555\"><a href=\"/opinion/111555/daniels-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">327</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986). Likewise, Eighth Amendment liability\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 requires “more than ordinary lack of due care for the prisoner’s\n\ninterests or safety.” Whitley v. Albers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111610\"><a href=\"/opinion/111610/whitley-v-albers/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 319 (1986). Only “unnecessary and\n\nwanton infliction of pain” or “deliberate indifference to the serious medical needs” of\n\nprisoners is sufficiently egregious to rise to the level of a constitutional violation. White\n\nv. Napolean. 897 F.2d at 108-09 (quoting Estelle v. Gamble, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109561\"><a href=\"/opinion/109561/estelle-v-gamble/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 103 (1976)).\n\nBooth alleged that after he was given an insulin shot, a guard confiscated his diabetes\n\nmedication for eight and a half hours, but left him with one packet, saying “take this one\n\npack[.] It should do.” Booth does not claim that he was actually put in danger. This\n\nconduct does not establish deliberate indifference.\n\n       Booth’s prison conditions claim also fails. The Eighth Amendment protects prison\n\ninmates from cruel and unusual punishment. See e.g., Farmer v. Brennan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(1994). However, not all deficiencies and inadequacies in prison conditions amount to a\n\nviolation of an inmate’s constitutional rights. The Eighth Amendment is violated only\n\nwhere, viewing the totality of the conditions in the prison, the inmate’s conditions of\n\nconfinement, alone or in combination, deprive him of the minimal civilized measure of\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\flife’s necessities.

Further, the administrators neither\n\ndirected the search and seizure nor had knowledge that the search and confiscation\n\noccurred. While the timing of the incidents appears suspicious, this alone does not create\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\fa showing of retaliation. This is especially true considering that Booth has filed\n\ninnumerable grievances throughout his incarceration, making it less coincidental that an\n\nincident occurred after one of his filings.\n\n       Booth argues on appeal that Judges Brody and Dalzell exhibited bias in favor of\n\nthe defendants, and that the defendants’ second motion for summary judgment was\n\nprocedurally barred. Both judges recused themselves out of an abundance of caution.\n\nBooth does not argue, and we find no evidence on this record, that either judge actually\n\nexhibited bias against Booth or displayed an appearance of impartiality in this case, and\n\nthus, recusal under 28 U.S.C. § 455(a) was not required. In support of his procedural bar\n\nargument, Booth contends that the defendants were prohibited from filing a second\n\nmotion because their first summary judgment motion was granted in part in 2004.\n\nSummary judgment was denied as to the retaliation claim at that time. There is nothing in\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(a) that prevented the defendants from filing a second summary\n\njudgment motion on the retaliation claim where, as here, the motion contained additional\n\naffidavits or other evidence.\n\n       We have thoroughly reviewed the remaining arguments Booth makes on appeal\n\nand find them meritless. Accordingly, we will reverse the District Court’s order denying\n\nBooth’s Rule 15 motion and remand for further consideration by the District Court in\n\naccordance with this Opinion. We will affirm the judgment of the District Court in all\n\nother respects.\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\f</pre>",
