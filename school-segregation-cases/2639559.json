Ali appeals his November 26, 2013 judgment of sentence. We\n\nconclude that Ali is not entitled to relief on his trial-related claims. However,\n\nfor the reasons set forth herein, Ali is entitled to a new sentencing\n\nproceeding.     Consequently, we vacate the judgment of sentence and we\n\nremand this case for re-sentencing.\n\n       The trial court set forth the factual and procedural history of this case\n\nin its March 25, 2014 Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a) opinion as follows:\n\n       A Criminal Complaint was filed on June 30, 2012, and [Ali] was\n       ultimately charged with two counts of Corrupt Organizations [18\n       Pa.C.S. § 911]; numerous offenses under the Controlled\n       Substance, Drug, Device, and Cosmetic Act [35 P.S. § 780-113,\n       et seq.]; and two counts of criminal conspiracy [18 Pa.C.S.\n       § 903]. The events that led to these charges began on May 22,\n____________________________________________\n\n\n*\n       Retired Senior Judge assigned to the Superior Court.\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n     2012, around 11:19 a.m., when police officer Michael Breslin,\n     dressed in a t-shirt, jeans, and sneakers, went to a store at 315\n     East High Street in Pottstown, Montgomery County (hereinafter\n     “Achi Store”). Officer Breslin was given twenty dollars of U.S.\n     Currency and his purpose was to buy the drug K2 or synthetic\n     marijuana from the Achi Store.\n\n     After getting an iced tea from the cooler, Officer Breslin stood in\n     line at the cash register and observed cigars and blunts on the\n     wall behind the register, but did not see any K2. Also while\n     standing in line, Officer Breslin noticed two state lottery workers\n     installing or working on a lottery machine and [Ali] was behind\n     the cash register. When it was his turn to pay, Officer Breslin\n     asked [Ali] for a Purple Night Owl blunt and asked if [Ali] had\n     any “Kush,” which Officer Breslin knew as a brand of K2. [Ali]\n     quietly said “no I don’t” while appearing to nervously look over\n     at the state lottery worker. Upon asking if he had any type of\n     K2, [Ali] again said “No, no I don’t.” Officer Breslin purchased\n     the iced tea and Night Owl blunt and left.\n\n     Also on May 22, 2012 around noon, Officer Peter Yambrick\n     entered the Achi Store wearing facial hair, a t-shirt, khaki shorts\n     and flip-flops, with the task of purchasing K2 or synthetic\n     marijuana. Officer Yambrick retrieved a Diet Pepsi and took it to\n     the counter where the cash register is located. [Ali] was behind\n     the cash register and nobody else was in the store at that time.\n     Officer Yambrick asked [Ali] for a Great Phillies blunt, which is a\n     cigar. After [Ali] put the cigar on the counter, Officer Yambrick\n     asked him if he had any K2, to which [Ali] shifted his eyes to\n     look around the store and then responded, “Yeah. Five bucks.\n     How many do you want?” Officer Yambrick told him two. [Ali]\n     again looked around the store and reached underneath the\n     display case, put two containers of K2 on the counter, and slid\n     them toward Officer Yambrick. The officer paid for his items\n     with the pre-recorded U.S. Currency he was given and put the\n     K2 in his pocket.\n\n     After returning to the police station, another plan was developed\n     to send Officer Yambrick back to the Achi Store to see if there\n     were any surveillance cameras that would show the buying and\n     selling of K2. The officer went back to the store at 1:15 p.m.,\n     retrieved a bag of Doritos and got into the checkout line behind\n     another individual. The person in front of Officer Yambrick asked\n     for a cigar, and then a conversation developed between the\n     individual and [Ali], who was behind the counter.          Officer\n\n                                    -2-\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n     Yambrick saw [Ali] look around the store and reach under the\n     display case to retrieve K2 for the individual in front of him.\n\n     Thereafter, around 4:30 p.m. the same day, Sergeant Michael\n     Markovich was working at the Pottstown Police Department and\n     served a search warrant at the Achi Store as a result of his\n     investigations. When he arrived at the store[, Ali] was not\n     present, but his co-defendant Mohammed Himed was working.\n     Retrieved through the search warrant were: $636 laying on top\n     of the open cash register drawer and alongside the register;\n     $247 in a Dutch Masters cigar box that was located underneath\n     the counter; $540 in a Game cigar box found on a shelf\n     underneath the counter; twelve vials of synthetic marijuana\n     hanging right above the box of cash, eleven of which were\n     labeled “Dead Man” and another with the label “Hawaiian Bliss”;\n     clear sandwich bags behind the counter on a shelf; a black\n     plastic bag containing a clear plastic bag filled with green\n     vegetable matter; a marijuana grinder; a .40 caliber semi-\n     automatic handgun found on a small shelf below the counter 2; a\n     white box containing [twenty-four] vials of “Hawaiian Bliss,” or\n     Kush found inside the storage room behind the store; ten glass\n     pipes commonly used to smoke crack cocaine, being sold as\n     pens found in a cup; thirteen glass pipes commonly used to\n     smoke marijuana on a display wall behind the counter; razor\n     blades found underneath the counter; twenty more crack pipe\n     pens found in a black plastic bag underneath the counter; a\n     display rack behind the counter containing cigars, blunts, wraps\n     and rolling papers; copper mesh wires in a box labeled Chore\n     Boy copper scrubbing pads; copper wire found underneath the\n     counter; and a Verizon bill addressed to [Ali].\n        2\n           Both parties stipulated that the .40 caliber Kahr Arms\n        ZA5383 handgun with six rounds in the magazine was\n        lawfully purchased from Federal Coin Exchange in\n        Pottstown by Rafie Ali approximately one week before the\n        search warrant was executed on May 22, 2012.\n\n     [Ali] was ultimately charged with numerous crimes as a result of\n     Sergeant Markovich’s investigation.        Thereafter, a jury trial\n     commenced on June 10, 2013 and ended on June 13, 2013. The\n     jury found [Ali] guilty of the following charges: Count 1; Corrupt\n     Organizations—Association [18 Pa.C.S. § 911(b)(3)]; Count 2;\n     Corrupt Organizations [18 Pa.C.S. § 911(b)(4)]; Counts 3, 4, 5,\n     6, and 7, Possession With Intent to Deliver Synthetic\n     Cannabinoids [35 P.S. § 780-113(a)(30)]; Counts 13, 14, 15,\n\n                                    -3-\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n     16, and 17, Delivery of Paraphernalia [35 P.S. § 780-\n     113(a)(33)]; and Counts 28 and 29, Criminal Conspiracy [18\n     Pa.C.S. § 903].\n\n                               *     *     *\n\n     [At the November 26, 2013 sentencing hearing, the trial court\n     permitted the Commonwealth to introduce victim impact\n     testimony from the families of James Crawford and Rachel Witt,\n     victims of a vehicle crash that allegedly was caused by the use of\n     synthetic marijuana.]      [T]he crimes [Ali] was charged and\n     ultimately convicted of arose from an investigation that occurred\n     as a result of a fatal accident. Detective Robert Turner III was\n     called to the scene of this accident around 11:29 p.m. on May\n     21, 2012. [Fifteen]-year-old Rachel Witt and [twenty-eight]-\n     year-old James Crawford were both killed [in] the vehicle crash.\n     As part of a search warrant, Detective Turner located a bottle of\n     a brownish-green leafy substance in the back of the vehicle,\n     which was labeled “Dead Man.” This substance was confirmed\n     by the National Medical Services lab as containing AM-2201 and\n     JWH-018, also known as synthetic marijuana.\n\n     Roger Malloy was determined to be the driver of the vehicle on\n     the night of the accident and ultimately pled guilty to two counts\n     of Homicide By Vehicle while Driving Under the Influence, and\n     Accidents Involving Personal Injury or Death While Not Properly\n     Licensed. The presence of AM-2201 and delta-9-THC was found\n     in Mr. Malloy’s blood from a toxicology report taken the morning\n     after the accident.\n\n     During [Ali’s] sentencing hearing, the Commonwealth presented\n     testimony from Roger Malloy’s guilty plea, where he admitted to\n     smoking K2 before the accident and to the negative [effects\n     that] it had on him. Additionally, during [Ali’s] trial Dr. Edward\n     Barbieri described the toxic impact synthetic marijuana can have\n     on individuals, even when used in low doses. Finally, during []\n     trial the jury found [Ali] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt [as an\n     accomplice] of delivering synthetic marijuana to James Crawford\n     and Kendall Harper on May 21, 2012, both of whom were in the\n     vehicle involved in the accident that took place the same day.\n\n     [The trial] court granted the Commonwealth’s motion and\n     permitted the Commonwealth to incorporate the victim impact\n     testimony of Benjamin Witt; Lillian Mumford; and Tracy Ann\n     Witt, which they previously gave under oath at the sentencing\n     for Roger Malloy.\n\n                                   -4-\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n                                 *     *     *\n\n      On November 26, 2013, the court sentenced [Ali] to fifteen [to]\n      thirty months in a State Correctional Institution on Count 1,\n      Corrupt Organizations; another fifteen [to] thirty months . . . for\n      Count 2, Corrupt Organizations; Count 3, Possession with Intent\n      to Deliver a Controlled Substance, with a school zone\n      enhancement, not less than twelve nor more than [twenty-four]\n      months; Count 4, Possession with Intent to Deliver a Controlled\n      Substance, again with a school zone enhancement, not less than\n      twelve nor more than [twenty-four] months; Count 5, another\n      Possession with Intent to Deliver a Controlled Substance with a\n      youth enhancement, not less than twelve nor more than\n      [twenty-four] months; and for Count 6, Possession with Intent to\n      Deliver a Controlled Substance with a youth enhancement, not\n      less than [eighteen months] nor more than [thirty-six] months.\n      All sentences [were ordered] to run consecutively and the\n      remaining counts are a sentence of guilt without further penalty.\n\n      [Ali] did not file any post-sentence motions. On December 18,\n      2013, he filed a counseled Notice of Appeal [to] our Superior\n      Court.    [Ali] subsequently complied with [the trial] court’s\n      directive that he produce and serve a Concise Statement of\n      Matters Complained of on Appeal within [twenty-one] days and\n      in accordance with Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure\n      1925(b).\n\nTrial Court Opinion (“T.C.O.”), 3/25/2014, at 1-5, 10-11 (some footnotes\n\nand citations to the notes of testimony omitted). On March 25, 2014, the\n\ntrial court issued an opinion pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a).\n\n      Ali raises the following issues for our consideration:\n\n      1. Whether the Honorable Trial Court erred by applying the\n         school zone enhancement for sentencing purposes because\n         the Commonwealth did not establish that the Y.W.C.A. fell\n         within the ambit of the enhancement?\n\n      2. Whether the Honorable Trial Court erred by determining that\n         the youth enhancement applied for sentencing purposes\n         because the Commonwealth never proved that [Ali] delivered\n         drugs to a minor?\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n       3. Whether the Honorable Trial Court erred by granting the\n          Commonwealth’s motion to introduce victim impact testimony\n          from an unrelated criminal matter when said testimony was\n          irrelevant and prejudicial, and should not have been\n          considered by the court for sentencing purposes?\n\n       4. Whether the Honorable Trial Court violated [Ali’s]\n          constitutional rights by applying sentencing enhancements in\n          violation of Alleyne[1] and whether the sentence imposed\n          was an abuse of discretion?\n\n       5. Whether the Honorable Trial Court erred by preventing [Ali]\n          from publishing exhibit D-6, the laboratory report upon which\n          [Ali] relied for his understanding and belief the substance he\n          sold was legal, since D-6 was admitted into evidence?\n\n       6. Whether the Honorable Trial Court erred by precluding [Ali]\n          from introducing evidence that the handgun found at the Achi\n          store was under the control and dominion of the co-\n          defendant?\n\nBrief for Ali at 4.\n\n       Because we ultimately grant Ali a new sentencing hearing, we begin\n\nwith his trial-related claims, upon which we conclude that Ali is not entitled\n\nto relief. We start with Ali’s fifth stated claim: whether the trial court erred\n\nby prohibiting him from publishing a laboratory report to the jury, which Ali\n\nalleged caused him to believe that selling K2 was legal.\n\n       Ali testified in his own defense at trial. During his direct examination,\n\nAli testified that his co-defendant and business partner, Mohammed Himed,\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1\n       Alleyne v. United States, 133 S.Ct. 2151 (U.S. 2013).\n\n\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\ndisagreed as to whether to sell K2 in the Achi Store.2 Ali believed that the\n\nsubstance was illegal, while Himed maintained that K2, being a synthetic\n\nsubstance, was legal. To solidify his position and to convince Ali that K2 was\n\nlegal to sell, Himed produced a laboratory report from Triangle Park\n\nLaboratories, Inc., which indicated on the face of the report that Triangle\n\nPark was a DEA Registered Analytical Laboratory.         The report apparently\n\nindicated to Ali that K2 did not contain any substances that were categorized\n\nas controlled substances in Pennsylvania.         Relying upon this report, Ali\n\nbecame convinced that K2 was not illegal, and that selling K2 would not be a\n\ncrime. Ali testified that he truly believed that selling K2 was not illegal and\n\nyielded to Himed’s desire to sell the substance in the Achi Store.\n\n       Neither the authenticity nor the veracity of the laboratory report was\n\nestablished by an expert or other qualified witness.         Nonetheless, Ali’s\n\ncounsel attempted to publish the report to the jury on multiple occasions\n\nover the Commonwealth’s objections.              The trial court sustained the\n\nCommonwealth’s objections. Ali’s counsel admitted that the contents of the\n\nlaboratory report were false, and that he could not offer the document for\n\nthe truth contained therein.          Nonetheless, he argued that, because the\n\ndocument was used to show the effect that it had on Ali, the jury was\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n2\n      Khalil Jones, an employee at the Achi Store, corroborated Ali’s\ntestimony that Ali and Himed disagreed over whether to sell K2 in the Achi\nStore.\n\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nentitled to see the document itself. The trial court permitted Ali’s counsel to\n\nargue to the jury the effect that the document had on Ali, but refused to\n\npublish the document to the jury because the court considered it to be\n\ndouble hearsay if offered for the truth of the contents contained within the\n\nreport, and, perhaps more importantly, factually incorrect.\n\n        On redirect examination, Ali’s counsel asked Ali additional questions\n\nregarding the laboratory report in an attempt to demonstrate that the report\n\nappeared to be authentic and reliable such that Ali’s reliance upon it was\n\nreasonable.     Following another Commonwealth objection, the trial court\n\ninstructed the jury as follows:\n\n        Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this document which is going\n        to be offered into evidence is not being offered for the truth of\n        the matter asserted, meaning you’re never going to see this\n        document, you’re never going to be able to look at it, you’re\n        never going to be able to compare it because it’s never been\n        offered into evidence for the truth of the matter asserted. It is\n        an exception. It is being offered simply as to whether he saw a\n        document and the effect that it had upon him. This is important.\n\nNotes of Testimony (“N.T.”), 6/12/2013, at 150.\n\n        Presently, Ali argues that the jury should have been able to view the\n\ndocument and resolve any credibility disputes, a task relegated solely to the\n\njury.   Ali further maintains that it was necessary for the jury to view the\n\ndocument in order to properly assess his credibility.     Ali asserted that he\n\nsincerely believed that selling K2 was not illegal, which was exclusively\n\nbased upon his reliance on the authenticity and reliability of the report. The\n\nonly way that the jury could have determined whether Ali’s belief was\n\n                                      -8-\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nsincere was to view the document and to determine whether it appeared\n\nworthy   of   belief   on   its   face.    Additionally,   Ali   contends   that   the\n\nCommonwealth opened the door to publication by cross-examining Ali\n\nvigorously about his reliance upon the report. See Brief for Ali at 36.\n\n      We review all matters touching upon the admission of evidence,\n\nincluding the trial court’s gatekeeping function regarding what evidence a\n\njury gets to observe and handle during a trial, for an abuse of discretion.\n\nSee Commonwealth v. Brown, 52 A.3d 1139, 1197 (Pa. 2012) (citation\n\nomitted); Commonwealth v. Dupre, 866 A.2d 1089, 1102 (Pa. Super.\n\n2005). “An abuse of discretion is not merely an error of judgment, but is\n\nrather the overriding or misapplication of the law, or the exercise of\n\njudgment that is manifestly unreasonable, or the result of bias, prejudice, ill-\n\nwill or partiality, as shown by the evidence of record.” Commonwealth v.\n\nMendez, 74 A.3d 256, 260 (Pa. Super. 2013) (citation omitted), appeal\n\ndenied, 87 A.3d 319 (Pa. 2013). “[I]f in reaching a conclusion the trial court\n\nover-rides [sic] or misapplies the law, discretion is then abused and it is the\n\nduty of the appellate court to correct the error.”               Commonwealth v.\n\nWeakley, 972 A.2d 1182, 1188 (Pa. Super. 2009) (citation omitted).\n\n      Our case law is sparse concerning the standards that we must apply to\n\na trial court’s decision to prohibit a defendant from displaying to the jury a\n\nparticular exhibit.    Nonetheless, our Supreme Court has articulated the\n\nfollowing standard with regard to the items that a jury may take with it into\n\nthe deliberation room:\n\n                                          -9-\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n      The underlying reason for excluding certain items from the jury’s\n      deliberations is to prevent placing undue emphasis or credibility\n      on the material, and de-emphasizing or discrediting other items\n      not in the room with the jury. If there is a likelihood the\n      importance of the evidence will be skewed, prejudice may be\n      found; if not, there is no prejudice per se and the error is\n      harmless.\n\nCommonwealth v. Strong, 836 A.2d 884, 888 (Pa. 2003). Although not\n\ndirectly applicable, we nonetheless find the standard helpful, and we discern\n\nno meaningful basis to distinguish between publication to a jury of an exhibit\n\nand providing the jury with that exhibit during deliberations. Thus, we apply\n\nthis standard to Ali’s claim.\n\n      Here, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by prohibiting Ali from\n\npublishing the controversial laboratory report to the jury. Ali testified that\n\nhe relied upon the report to formulate his honest belief that selling K2 was\n\nnot illegal. Ali’s counsel averred that the document was not being offered as\n\nevidence for the truth of the matter contained therein, but instead to\n\ndemonstrate the effect that the report had on Ali.      However, Ali’s counsel\n\nacknowledged at trial that the contents of the report itself were false. N.T.,\n\n7/12/2013, at 84-90. In explaining why he could not verify the authenticity\n\n(or veracity, for that matter) of the report, counsel also revealed to the trial\n\ncourt that the author of the report had been indicted in New York for his role\n\nin creating the fraudulent report. Id. at 87. The danger that the jury might\n\nskew or place undue emphasis upon the contents of the report is evident.\n\nEven with a cautionary instruction, the potential for the jury to misconstrue\n\nthe document, or be misled by its falsity, simply was too high, and this\n\n                                     - 10 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\novercame whatever probative value may have attached to the document.\n\nThus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying counsel’s request\n\nto publish the report to the jury.\n\n      We also note that, even if we were to conclude that the trial court’s\n\ndecision was erroneous, such an error would have been harmless. Pursuant\n\nto the harmless error doctrine, “an error may be harmless where the\n\nproperly admitted evidence of guilt is so overwhelming and the prejudicial\n\neffect of the error is so insignificant by comparison that it is clear beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that the error could not have contributed to the verdict.”\n\nStrong, 836 A.2d at 887 (citing Commonwealth v. Story, 383 A.2d 155,\n\n162 (Pa. 1978)).\n\n      First,   during   direct,   cross,   and   redirect   examination,   Ali   was\n\nquestioned extensively about the report. Through this questioning, the jury\n\nwas apprised of the look of the report, the various markings on the report,\n\nand the lack of authenticating indicia such as a signature by the author.\n\nThus, the jurors were well-informed about the document, rendering the\n\npurported error in precluding them from handling or observing the report\n\nfirst-hand relatively inconsequential.\n\n      Second, the evidence that Ali knew that selling K2 was not legal was\n\noverwhelming, such that any alleged error by the trial court was harmless.\n\nAs noted earlier, Ali contends that the jury needed to observe the document\n\nto assess Ali’s credibility with regard to his claim that he believed that selling\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 11 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nK2 was not illegal.   However, Ali’s own actions while working at the Achi\n\nStore belied his defense.\n\n       When Officer Breslin first asked Ali for K2, there were other people in\n\nthe store. Ali responded nervously, looked at the other people in the store,\n\nand told Officer Breslin that he did not have K2 for sale.     Officer Breslin\n\nasked a second time, and, again, Ali responded quietly and nervously that\n\nhe did not have any. However, when Officer Yambrick entered the store a\n\nshort time later, no one else was inside of the store. He also asked Ali for\n\nK2. This time, Ali looked around the store and, upon seeing that they were\n\nalone, asked Officer Yambrick how much K2 he wanted.         Ali again looked\n\naround the store to make sure that they were alone, reached underneath the\n\ncounter, and produced two containers of K2. Officer Yambrick went back to\n\nthe store later that day and observed Ali selling K2 to a person in front of\n\nhim in line in the same surreptitious manner as Ali had done earlier in the\n\nday.\n\n       This evidence demonstrated that Ali knew that selling K2 was not\n\nwithin the bounds of the law. Ali did not have K2 prominently displayed on\n\nthe counter of the Achi Store as if it were just another product. Rather, he\n\nhad it hidden underneath the counter, and had a separate container there to\n\ncollect the money from those particular sales. When other people were in\n\nthe store, Ali declined to sell K2. He acted suspiciously and nervously until\n\nhe was alone with a customer. It was only then that he sold the K2. By\n\nthemselves, these actions demonstrate that Ali knew that selling K2 was not\n\n                                    - 12 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nlegal. This would render any alleged error by the trial court with regard to\n\nthe laboratory report harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n     Ali next contends that the trial court erred by excluding certain\n\nstatements that were made by co-defendant Himed regarding the possession\n\nand control of the .40 caliber gun that was found when the police executed\n\nthe search warrant on the Achi Store.       Ali legally purchased the handgun\n\napproximately one week before the search warrant was executed. However,\n\nno testimony was presented at trial to establish that Ali ever was seen in\n\nactual possession of the gun. Ali attempted to demonstrate that Himed, who\n\nacted as the head of the business, had exclusive control of the weapon. To\n\ndo so, Ali tried to ask Khalil Jones, an employee of the store, about a\n\nquestion that Jones overheard Himed asking another individual. Ali alleged\n\nat trial that Jones heard Himed asking the unknown person “can you get me\n\nbullets for the gun?” N.T., 7/12/2013, at 12.\n\n     The trial court prohibited Ali’s counsel from asking this question upon\n\nthe basis that it was inadmissible hearsay.     Presently, Ali argues that the\n\nstatement was not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted, but\n\nrather to show “the fact that Himed made the statement and Himed’s state\n\nof mind regarding his ownership and control of the gun.” Brief for Ali at 38.\n\nWe agree with Ali.     The statement was not hearsay.      However, the trial\n\ncourt’s evidentiary error was harmless.\n\n     As noted earlier, we review a trial court’s evidentiary decisions for an\n\nabuse of discretion.     See Brown, supra.        Hearsay is an out-of-court\n\n                                   - 13 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nstatement    offered   to   prove   the   truth   of   the    matter   asserted.\n\nCommonwealth v. Puskar, 740 A.2d 219, 225 (Pa. 1999). As a general\n\nrule, hearsay is inadmissible, because such evidence lacks guarantees of\n\ntrustworthiness fundamental to our jurisprudence.            Commonwealth v.\n\nDargan, 897 A.2d 496, 500 (Pa. Super. 2006) (citations omitted). The rule\n\nagainst admitting hearsay evidence stems from its presumed lack of\n\nreliability; the declarant cannot be challenged regarding the accuracy of the\n\nstatement. See Commonwealth v. Rush, 605 A.2d 792, 795 (Pa. 1992).\n\nImportantly, “[w]hen an extrajudicial statement is offered for a purpose\n\napart from proving the truth of its contents, it is not hearsay and is not\n\nexcluded under the hearsay rule.” Commonwealth v. Cassidy, 462 A.2d\n\n270, 272 (Pa. Super. 1983) (citations omitted).\n\n      Here, the statement that Ali’s counsel sought to introduce through\n\nKhalil Jones’ testimony was not hearsay, as it was not being offered for the\n\ntruth of the matter asserted. Jones purportedly would have testified that he\n\noverheard Himed ask someone, “[C]an you get me bullets for the gun?” If\n\nthis statement were offered for its truth, then Ali would have been seeking\n\nto prove that Himed actually wanted to know whether the listener could\n\nobtain bullets.   However, whether that person could do so plainly was not\n\nwhat Ali sought to establish.   Rather, he proffered the statement to show\n\nthat Himed controlled the gun, “a purpose apart” from asserting the truth of\n\nthe statement. See Cassidy, supra.\n\n\n\n\n                                    - 14 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\n      Nonetheless, beyond a reasonable doubt, the error was harmless. The\n\nevidence overwhelmingly established that, in concert with Himed, Ali sold K2\n\nfrom the Achi Store. As we discussed above, Ali evidenced awareness that\n\nselling K2 was illegal. The police officers purchased the substance directly\n\nfrom Ali.    The spoils of the search warrant revealed abundant evidence to\n\nsupport each of the charges of which Ali was convicted. Ali’s introduction of\n\nthis one statement would not have overcome the overwhelming evidence of\n\nguilt. Consequently, Ali is not entitled to relief on his trial claims.\n\n      We turn to Ali’s sentencing challenges. We begin with Ali’s third stated\n\nclaim:      that the trial court erred in permitting certain victim impact\n\ntestimony at sentencing. Ali is entitled to relief on that claim. He must be\n\nafforded a new sentencing hearing.        Having concluded as much, we must\n\nthen review Ali’s remaining claims to determine which (if any) sentencing\n\nenhancements the trial court may impose at resentencing.\n\n      At Ali’s trial, the jury learned of the tragic deaths of Rachel Witt, age\n\nfifteen, and James Crawford, age twenty-eight. On May 21, 2012, Kendall\n\nHarper, Robert Malloy, Roger Malloy, and James Crawford stopped at the\n\nAchi Store to purchase K2 synthetic marijuana, something that Harper had\n\ndone on two prior occasions.      Harper and Crawford entered the store and\n\nreturned to the car shortly thereafter in possession of K2. Undisputedly, it\n\nwas Muhammed Himed, and not Ali, who sold K2 to Harper and Crawford on\n\nthat occasion. See Brief for the Commonwealth at 6. Except for Harper, all\n\nof the individuals smoked the K2.\n\n                                      - 15 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\n      Later that evening, Roger Malloy was driving a vehicle with all of the\n\nabove-referenced individuals as passengers, including Rachel Witt, whom\n\nthey picked up after stopping at the Achi Store. Malloy wrecked the vehicle,\n\nresulting in the deaths of Witt and Crawford.        Evidence of synthetic\n\nmarijuana was found in Roger Malloy’s blood.\n\n      The jury was presented with evidence of the wreck by way of the\n\nfollowing stipulation:\n\n      [] Kendall Harper, date of birth 12-9-95, gave statements to\n      police and if called to testify would say on the evening of May\n      21st, 2012, he was with Roger Malloy, Robert Malloy and James\n      Crawford. Roger drove everyone to the Achi Store in a Lincoln\n      Continental and Kendall and James went inside the store.\n\n      When they returned to the Lincoln Continental, they drove to\n      another location and picked up Rachel Witt. Roger then drove\n      everybody to Bright Hope Villiage. While there, James Crawford\n      produced K2 and everybody smoked it except Kendall. The K2\n      was rolled up in a Dutch to smoke it. Kendall says the color of\n      the K2’s label was red and yellow and it was marked as Dead\n      Man.\n\n      Kendall has purchased K2 from the Achi store on two prior\n      occasions. Kendall described the person who sold him the K2 on\n      these occasions as being a Muslim male with long hair. Kendall\n      explained the manner in which he bought the K2 as he would\n      have to wait until the store was empty. The Muslim male took\n      the K2 from underneath the counter and it was not on display.\n\n      [] The person that sold the synthetic marijuana labeled Dead\n      Man which was sold on the evening of May 21, 2012, from the\n      store to James Crawford and Kendall Harper was not identified\n      as Rafie Ali.\n\nN.T., 6/11/2013, at 132-33.\n\n\n\n\n                                   - 16 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\n     Roger Malloy pleaded guilty to two counts of homicide by vehicle while\n\ndriving under the influence and related crimes based upon his role in Witt’s\n\nand Crawford’s deaths. See T.C.O. at 10. Despite the fact that Ali did not\n\nsell the synthetic marijuana to Harper and Crawford on the night of the\n\ncrash, at Ali’s sentencing, the trial court permitted the Commonwealth to\n\nintroduce evidence from Roger Malloy’s guilty plea hearing, including\n\nMalloy’s admission to smoking K2 before driving the vehicle and the victim\n\nimpact testimony given by members of the decedents’ families at Malloy’s\n\nguilty plea hearing.   The trial court acknowledged that the jury could not\n\nhave attributed the deaths to Ali, but nonetheless offered the following\n\nrationale for admitting and considering the victim impact testimony:\n\n     [D]uring the month of May, the sale to community members, the\n     sale to undercover officers, and sadly, the sale to Mr. Crawford,\n     Mr. Harper, that ultimately was connected to the death of Miss\n     Witt and [Mr. Crawford] . . . . Which directly led to his death is\n     being considered by the Court [sic].\n\n     Now, again, I make specific findings that there is nothing that\n     a jury—and this court had severed that case that they\n     caused the death. And there was nothing to find that.\n\n     But the Commonwealth has presented evidence in this particular\n     case that the substances found in Mr. Malloy’s system and\n     clearly the timing of exactly what happened on that tragic day,\n     that sad and tragic day that Mr. Crawford and Miss Witt lost their\n     lives at the hands of Mr. Malloy are connected.\n\n     And they’re connected to what you do, Mr. Ali, exactly what you\n     do. If you peddle death and dangerous substances, you can\n     expect something like this to happen. This is within the purview\n     of being a business owner. If you take the risk, you should\n     expect it. This is a stop and shop. This is not a sit-down store\n     where people come in and dine. It is meant to buy something\n     and go.\n\n                                   - 17 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n     And when people buy something and go in the nature of\n     convenience stores in this society, they do so by vehicle. They\n     drive up and they drive away. And if you sell them something\n     that can lead to their death, that can lead to them being\n     impaired, then this is a consequence that should be readily\n     known to you.\n\n     The sad part of it is you didn’t. I believe you simply were\n     operating for profit, you took a risk, and your risk ended up\n     contributing, leading, being connected to, whatever you want to\n     say—the Court is not finding that you caused their death\n     directly, but you certainly were connected to a series of\n     horrific events that led to unspeakable tragedy for the\n     families that this Court had to listen to during the\n     sentencing phase of Mr. Malloy’s case. So I cannot turn a\n     blind eye to it. It is simply a fact. And that was the tragic turn\n     of events that now leads to your conviction and your sentencing.\n\nN.T., 11/26/2013, at 77-78 (emphases added).         By the trial court’s own\n\nadmissions, although Ali was not directly responsible for the two deaths, the\n\ncourt considered the victim impact statements related to those deaths when\n\nsentencing Ali because the court believed that they were “connected.” For\n\nthe reasons that follow, we conclude that considering such evidence was\n\nerroneous, and constituted an abuse of discretion.\n\n     We review challenges to the admission of victim impact statements for\n\nan abuse of discretion. Commonwealth v. Flor, 998 A.2d 606, 634 (Pa.\n\n2010). Pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9738:\n\n     [I]n the trial of a defendant accused of an offense, . . . a court\n     shall not order the exclusion of any victim of the offense from\n     the trial on the basis that the victim may, during the sentencing\n     phase of the proceedings:\n\n     (1)   make a victim impact statement or present any victim\n           impact information in relation to the sentence to be\n           imposed on the defendant; or\n\n\n                                   - 18 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n     (2)    testify as to the effect of the offense on the victim or the\n            family of the victim.\n\nId. (emphasis added). The statute refers to the Crime Victim’s Act for the\n\ndefinition of a victim, which defines the term as any one of the following\n\npersons:\n\n     (1)    A direct victim.\n\n     (2)    A parent or legal guardian of a child who is a direct victim,\n            except when the parent or legal guardian of the child is the\n            alleged offender.\n\n     (3)    A minor child who is a material witness to any of the\n            following crimes and offenses under 18 Pa.C.S. (relating to\n            crimes and offenses) committed or attempted against a\n            member of the child’s family:\n\n            Chapter 25 (relating to criminal homicide)\n\n            Section 2702 (relating to aggravated assault)\n\n            Section 3121 (relating to rape)\n\n     (4)    A family member of a homicide victim, including\n            stepbrothers or stepsisters, stepchildren, stepparents or a\n            fiancé, one of whom is to be identified to receive\n            communication as provided for in this act, except where\n            the family member is the alleged offender.\n\n18 P.S. § 11.103.\n\n     “The   United   States    Supreme   Court   has   held   that   the   Eighth\n\nAmendment to the United States Constitution does not present a bar to the\n\nadmission of victim impact evidence.” Flor, 998 A.2d at 633 (citing Payne\n\nv. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 827 (1991)).           Victim impact evidence is\n\n“designed to show [] each victim’s uniqueness as a human being.” Payne,\n\n501 U.S. at 823 (citation omitted).      “Victim impact evidence is simply\n\n\n                                    - 19 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nanother form or method of informing the sentencing authority about the\n\nspecific harm caused by the crime in question.” Id. at 825.\n\n      However,    as   section   9738   makes   clear,   before   victim   impact\n\nstatements may be admitted at a sentencing hearing, there first must be an\n\nidentifiable victim of the crime for which the defendant was convicted. See\n\n42 Pa.C.S. § 9738 (“[A] court shall not order the exclusion of any victim of\n\nthe offense. . . .”). Indeed, “[w]here a defendant is convicted of a crime\n\nagainst a person, that person is considered by the law to have been a victim\n\nof the defendant’s crimes.” Commonwealth v. Smithton, 631 A.2d 1053,\n\n1057 (Pa. Super. 1993). Instantly, Ali was not convicted of a crime against\n\na person. Moreover, for the crimes of which Ali was convicted, there is no\n\nidentifiable victim to render a victim impact statement admissible.          The\n\nparties and the trial court have conceded that Ali did not sell K2 to any of\n\nthe parties involved in the wreck that resulted in the two deaths.         As the\n\nCommonwealth acknowledged, Himed, not Ali, sold the K2 to Harper and\n\nCrawford, K2 which Roger Malloy ingested before wrecking the car.            See\n\nBrief for the Commonwealth at 6.\n\n      Both the Commonwealth and the trial court rely upon the premise that\n\nthere existed a “connection” between Ali’s crimes and the ultimate deaths of\n\nWitt and Crawford.       See Brief for the Commonwealth at 23; N.T.,\n\n11/26/2013, at 77-78. Although such a connection may in fact exist, a mere\n\nlink between two distinct events is insufficient to trigger the applicability of\n\nsection 9738. The unambiguous language of the statute requires a victim to\n\n                                     - 20 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nbe identified as such before his or her victim impact statement is admissible.\n\nAdditionally, the Crime Victim’s Act requires proof of a “direct victim” and\n\nsimilarly situated individuals; it does not define a “victim” based upon the\n\nCommonwealth’s ability to string together attenuated connectors tying an\n\nindividual to indirectly-related events, tragic as those events may be.\n\n      Witt and Crawford’s deaths were tragic.     However, those individuals\n\nare not Ali’s victims under any reasonable reading of section 9738,\n\nparticularly where all parties admit that Ali did not commit the specific act\n\nthat led to the fatal wreck. We find no meaningful difference between this\n\ncase and Smithton. In Smithton, the appellant had been charged in three\n\nseparate criminal informations. In one of the cases, the appellant, who was\n\nsuffering from HIV, allegedly unlawfully entered a family’s home without\n\ntheir consent. Smithton, 631 A.2d at 1055. The owner of the home fought\n\noff the appellant with a shard of glass from a broken window through which\n\nthe appellant entered the home.       Id. at 1054.     At trial, the appellant\n\nconceded entering into the home, but argued that his entry was justified\n\nbecause he feared for his life. One of the other sets of charges arose from\n\nthe appellant’s behavior during his arrest and at the hospital after he was\n\ntransported there by the police. The final set of charges resulted from the\n\nappellant’s behavior at his arraignment for the prior two sets of charges. Id.\n\nat 1054-55.\n\n      The jury credited the appellant’s defense that he was justified in\n\nentering the home, and acquitted him of all charges relating to that incident.\n\n                                    - 21 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nThe jury convicted him of all of the other charges.                    Nonetheless, at\n\nsentencing, the trial court permitted the family residing in the home to\n\ntestify at length about how the appellant’s entry into the home affected\n\nthem and their lives, including their fears that they may have contracted HIV\n\nfrom the appellant. Id. at 1055-56.\n\n      On appeal, this Court reversed the judgment of sentence and\n\nremanded for a new sentencing hearing to be held without the victim impact\n\ntestimony. We first noted that, because the appellant was acquitted of the\n\ncharges relating to the entry into the home, the victim impact testimony was\n\nirrelevant. Id. at 1057. Essentially, we held that, due to the acquittals, the\n\nhomeowners were not victims of the alleged crime.                  We explained that\n\n“there   is,   strictly   speaking,   no     legal   authority   for   considering    the\n\n[homeowners] ‘victims’ or for considering the impact of appellant’s conduct\n\non their lives.”    Id. at 1058.      Critically, we rejected the notion that any\n\nconnection justified the admission of the victim impact testimony:                   “The\n\ncharges of which appellant was found guilty, though indirectly related by the\n\nloosely formed concatenation of events [that] transpired on the evening of\n\nappellant’s arrests, were contained in separate Criminal Informations and did\n\nnot involve the [homeowners.]” Id. We held that to admit the testimony\n\n“would give precious little meaning to the acquittal.” Id.\n\n      In describing the need to vacate the sentence, we noted that “[i]t is an\n\nabuse of discretion, as a denial of due process, for the sentencing court to\n\nconsider   irrelevant     factors   during sentencing.”          Id.   at 1056.       We\n\n                                           - 22 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nacknowledged that “[i]t is not enough that a trial court simply entertained\n\nimpermissible evidence in its deliberations.”    Id. (emphasis in original).\n\nAlthough a court “is ordinarily presumed to be capable of identifying and\n\nproperly disregarding all but the      most prejudicial and inflammatory\n\nevidence,” Commonwealth v. Penrod, 578 A.2d 486, 491 (Pa. Super.\n\n1990), a sentence must be vacated when “it reasonably appears from the\n\nrecord that the trial court relied in whole or in part upon such [an\n\nimpermissible] factor.”   Commonwealth v. Bethea, 379 A.2d 102, 106\n\n(Pa. 1977) (emphasis in original).       Citing Bethea, we concluded in\n\nSmithton that, although “[i]t is true that the trial court relied upon factors\n\nother than the [homeowners’] testimony in imposing sentence, . . . [i]t is\n\nalso irrelevant for our purposes. Where, as here, a trial court relies upon an\n\nimpermissible factor, in whole or in part, new sentencing must be\n\nafforded.” Smithton, 631 A.2d at 1058 (citing Bethea, supra; emphasis in\n\noriginal).\n\n      As in Smithton, there is no basis upon which we may conclude that\n\nWitt and Crawford were victims of the crimes of which Ali was convicted.\n\nThe charges against Ali did not implicate the fatal car accident. We reject\n\nthe trial court’s attempt to connect the relevant events in order to justify\n\nadmitting the victim impact testimony, just as we did in Smithton. The trial\n\ncourt’s own words demonstrate that the court relied to some extent upon\n\nthe victim impact testimony just as the trial court did in Smithton.     That\n\ntestimony was irrelevant, and reliance upon that evidence violated due\n\n                                    - 23 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nprocess. See Smithton, 631 A.2d at 1056. Consequently, the trial court\n\nabused its discretion, and we must vacate the judgment of sentence and\n\nremand for a new sentencing hearing at which the trial court may not\n\nconsider the victim impact testimony. See Bethea, supra.\n\n     The remainder of Ali’s issues that we will review pertain to the trial\n\ncourt’s consideration of the school zone sentencing enhancement and the\n\nenhancement for delivery of a controlled substance to a youth (“youth\n\nenhancement”)     when   calculating    where      Ali’s    offense    fell       within   the\n\nsentencing guidelines. Pursuant to 204 Pa. Code § 303.10(b)(2), the school\n\nzone enhancement compels a trial court to consider heightened guideline\n\nranges when “the court determines that the offender manufactured,\n\ndelivered or possessed with intent to deliver a controlled substance within\n\n250 feet of the real property on which is located a public or private\n\nelementary or secondary school.”        Id.     Similarly, the youth enhancement\n\nrequires the trial court to consider elevated guideline ranges in sentencing\n\nan individual when “the court determines that the offender distributed a\n\ncontrolled substance to a person or persons under the age of 18.” Id. at §\n\n303.10(b)(1).\n\n     We   begin   with   Ali’s   contention      that      the   application       of   these\n\nenhancements was unconstitutional in light of the United States Supreme\n\nCourt’s recent decision in Alleyne v. United States, 133 S.Ct. 2151 (U.S.\n\n2013).    Alleyne    challenges    implicate      the      legality   of      a    sentence.\n\nCommonwealth v. Lawrence, 99 A.3d 116, 123 (Pa. Super. 2014).                              “A\n\n                                       - 24 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nchallenge to the legality of a sentence . . . may be entertained as long as the\n\nreviewing court has jurisdiction.” Commonwealth v. Borovichka, 18 A.3d\n\n1242, 1254 n.8 (Pa. Super. 2011) (citation omitted).      “An illegal sentence\n\nmust be vacated.”     Commonwealth v. Rivera, 95 A.3d 913, 915 (Pa.\n\nSuper. 2014) (citation omitted).      “Issues relating to the legality of a\n\nsentence are questions of law. . . .      Our standard of review over such\n\nquestions is de novo and our scope of review is plenary.” Commonwealth\n\nv. Akbar, 91 A.3d 227, 238 (Pa. Super. 2014) (citations omitted).\n\n      In Commonwealth v. Miller, 102 A.3d 988 (Pa. Super. 2014), we\n\npresented the relevant portion of the Alleyne Court’s rationale as follows:\n\n      In Alleyne, the Supreme Court held that “facts that increase\n      mandatory minimum sentences must be submitted to the jury”\n      and must be found beyond a reasonable doubt. Alleyne, supra\n      at 2163. Alleyne is an extension of the Supreme Court’s line of\n      cases beginning with Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466\n      (2000). In Alleyne, the Court overruled Harris v. United\n      States, 536 U.S. 545 (2002), in which the Court had reached\n      the opposite conclusion, explaining that there is no constitutional\n      distinction between judicial fact[-]finding which raises the\n      minimum sentence and that which raises the maximum\n      sentence.\n\n         It is impossible to dissociate the floor of a sentencing\n         range from the penalty affixed to the crime. Indeed,\n         criminal statutes have long specified both the floor and\n         ceiling of sentence ranges, which is evidence that both\n         define the legally prescribed penalty.       This historical\n         practice allowed those who violated the law to know, ex\n         ante, the contours of the penalty that the legislature\n         affixed to the crime—and comports with the obvious truth\n         that the floor of a mandatory range is as relevant to\n         wrongdoers as the ceiling.       A fact that increases a\n         sentencing floor, thus, forms an essential ingredient of the\n         offense.\n\n\n                                    - 25 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n         Moreover, it is impossible to dispute that facts increasing\n         the legally prescribed floor aggravate the punishment.\n         Elevating the low-end of a sentencing range heightens the\n         loss of liberty associated with the crime: the defendant’s\n         expected punishment has increased as a result of the\n         narrowed range and the prosecution is empowered, by\n         invoking the mandatory minimum, to require the judge to\n         impose a higher punishment than he might wish. Why\n         else would Congress link an increased mandatory\n         minimum to a particular aggravating fact other than to\n         heighten the consequences for that behavior? This reality\n         demonstrates that the core crime and the fact triggering\n         the mandatory minimum sentence together constitute a\n         new, aggravated crime, each element of which must be\n         submitted to the jury.\n\n      Alleyne, [133 S.Ct.] at 2160-61 (internal quotation marks and\n      citations omitted).\n\nMiller, 102 A.3d at 994-95 (citations modified).\n\n      Alleyne has no application to the sentencing enhancements at issue in\n\nthis case.   The parameters of Alleyne are limited to the imposition of\n\nmandatory minimum sentences, i.e., where a legislature has prescribed a\n\nmandatory baseline sentence that a trial court must apply if certain\n\nconditions are met. The sentencing enhancements at issue impose no such\n\nfloor. Rather, the enhancements only direct a sentencing court to consider a\n\ndifferent range of potential minimum sentences, while preserving a trial\n\ncourt’s discretion to fashion an individual sentence. By their very character,\n\nsentencing enhancements do not share the attributes of a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence that the Supreme Court held to be elements of the\n\noffense that must be submitted to a jury. The enhancements do not bind a\n\ntrial court to any particular sentencing floor, nor do they compel a trial court\n\n\n                                     - 26 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nin any given case to impose a sentence higher than the court believes is\n\nwarranted.    They require only that a court consider a higher range of\n\npossible minimum sentences. Even then, the trial court need not sentence\n\nwithin that range; the court only must consider it. Thus, even though the\n\ntriggering facts must be found by the judge and not the jury—which is one\n\nof the elements of an Apprendi or Alleyne analysis—the enhancements\n\nthat the trial court applied in this case are not unconstitutional under\n\nAlleyne.\n\n       Ali maintains that, because both of the enhancements contain the\n\nword “shall,” the enhancements are mandatory in nature, and must fall\n\nwithin Alleyne’s holding. However, the enhancements only require the trial\n\ncourt to consider a certain range of sentences. The enhancements do not\n\nbind the trial court to impose any particular sentence, nor do they compel\n\nthe court to sentence within the specified range. Indeed, it is well-settled\n\nthat    the   sentencing    guidelines   ultimately    are   only   advisory.\n\nCommonwealth v. Griffin, 804 A.2d 1, 8 (Pa. Super. 2002).               Thus,\n\nAlleyne has no application to the enhancements.\n\n       Ali next argues that the trial court should not have applied the school\n\nzone enhancement, because the Commonwealth failed to prove that the\n\nY.W.C.A. constituted a “public or private elementary or secondary school,”\n\nwithin the meaning of subsection 303.10(b)(2). We agree with Ali.\n\n       The utilization of a sentencing enhancement concerns the trial court’s\n\napplication of the sentencing guidelines, and, therefore, implicates the\n\n                                    - 27 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\ndiscretionary aspects of Ali’s sentence.       Commonwealth v. Bowen, 612\n\nA.2d 512, 514 n.3 (Pa. Super. 1992). In Commonwealth v. Greene, 702\n\nA.2d 547 (Pa. Super. 1997), we explained an appellant’s burden when\n\nraising such a challenge, as follows:\n\n      Unlike a challenge to the legality of a sentence, there is no\n      absolute right to direct appellate review of a discretionary\n      sentencing claim. Rather, a party who desires to raise such\n      matters must petition this court for permission to appeal and\n      demonstrate that there is a substantial question that the\n      sentence is inappropriate.\n\n      In fulfilling this requirement, the party seeking to appeal must\n      include in his or her brief a concise statement of the reasons\n      relied upon in support of the petition for allowance of appeal\n      [pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 2119(f). In that statement, the appellant\n      must demonstrate that there exists a substantial question that\n      the sentence is inappropriate under the Sentencing Code.]\n\n                                  *     *       *\n\n      The determination of whether a substantial question exists must\n      be made on a case-by-case basis. It is only where an aggrieved\n      party can articulate clear reasons why the sentence issued by\n      the trial court compromises the sentencing scheme as a whole\n      that we will find a substantial question and review the decision of\n      the trial court. This [C]ourt has been inclined to find that a\n      substantial question exists where the appellant advances a\n      colorable argument that the sentencing judge’s actions were\n      either: (1) inconsistent with a specific provision of the\n      Sentencing Code; or (2) contrary to the fundamental norms\n      underlying the sentencing process.\n\nId. at 551 (citations omitted).\n\n      Ali has complied technically with Pa.R.A.P. 2119(f) by including a\n\nconcise statement in his brief. See Brief for Ali at 17. In his Rule 2119(f)\n\nstatement, Ali maintains that the trial court’s consideration of the sentencing\n\n\n\n                                      - 28 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nenhancements in this case presents a substantial question. We agree. We\n\nhave held consistently that challenges to the sentencing enhancements in\n\nthe sentencing guidelines present substantial questions justifying our review\n\nof an appellant’s discretionary aspects of a sentencing claim.           See\n\nCommonwealth v. Rhoades, 8 A.3d 912, 916 (Pa. Super. 2010);\n\nCommonwealth v. Kneller, 999 A.2d 608, 614 (Pa. Super. 2010);\n\nCommonwealth v. Hatcher, 746 A.2d 1142, 1144 (Pa. Super. 2000);\n\nGreene, 702 A.2d at 551; Bowen, 612 A.2d at 514. Thus, we grant Ali’s\n\npetition for allowance of appeal, and we will review his challenges to the\n\napplication of both the school zone and the youth sentencing enhancements.\n\n     The trial court held two sentencing proceedings in this case, staying\n\nthe first proceeding to permit the parties to consider and address the impact\n\nof Alleyne, which was newly-decided at the time, upon Ali’s sentence. At\n\nthe first sentencing hearing on October 8, 2013, Ali stipulated to a\n\nCommonwealth report that contained a summary of information, to which a\n\npolice officer would have testified had he been called, pertaining to the\n\nY.W.C.A. at issue for the school zone sentencing enhancement. The report\n\nindicated that the Y.W.C.A. was located within 250 feet of the Achi Store,\n\nthat the Y.W.C.A. operated a state-licensed early learning center with a full\n\ndaycare program that is entitled “Ready, Set, Grow,” and that the Y.W.C.A.\n\nwas in operation at the time of Ali’s crimes.     Ali also stipulated to the\n\nadmissibility and the authenticity of a photograph of the Y.W.C.A., which\n\n\n\n\n                                   - 29 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nindicated on the door of the facility that the Y.W.C.A. considered itself a pre-\n\nschool. N.T., 10/8/2013, at 9-11; N.T., 11/26/2013, at 11.\n\n       There is very little case law addressing the school zone enhancement,\n\nand none interprets the terms “public or private elementary or secondary\n\nschool.”    Consequently, we first consider two cases that have addressed\n\nwhether a daycare or a pre-school falls within the ambit of the drug-free\n\nschool zone mandatory minimum sentence that is codified at 18 Pa.C.S.\n\n§ 3617.3 Section 3617 purports to impose a mandatory minimum sentence\n\non individuals over the age of eighteen who deliver, or possess with intent to\n\ndeliver, a controlled substance “within 1,000 feet of the real property on\n\nwhich is located a public, private or parochial school or a college or\n\nuniversity or within 250 feet of the real property on which is located a\n\nrecreation center or playground or on a school bus.”       18 Pa.C.S. § 3617.\n\nHowever, even though both the mandatory minimum provision and the\n\nsentencing enhancement seek to increase penalties for drug trafficking near\n\nschool zones, the operative language in the two sections differs in such a\n\nway that the two cases interpreting the provisions do not apply to the\n\nsentencing enhancements at issue herein.\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n3\n      Section 3617 was held unconstitutional by this Court in\nCommonwealth v. Watley, 81 A.3d 108 (Pa. Super. 2013). Nonetheless,\nthe unconstitutionality of this mandatory minimum sentence has no bearing\nupon our analysis.\n\n\n\n                                          - 30 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\n      Because no case law yet has addressed whether the sentencing\n\nenhancement applies to drug offenses near daycares or pre-schools, the\n\nparties predictably have relied upon the two cases addressing the drug-free\n\nschool zone mandatory minimum sentence. The Commonwealth argues that\n\nthe Y.W.C.A. operated a pre-school, and that Commonwealth v. Lewis,\n\n885 A.2d 51 (Pa. Super. 2005), should control.      In Lewis, we interpreted\n\nthe above-quoted language from section 6317, and held that a pre-school\n\nfell squarely within that language. Id. at 58. Quoting Commonwealth v.\n\nDrummond, 775 A.2d 849, 856-57 (Pa. Super. 2001) (en banc), we noted\n\nthat, by enacting section 6317, our legislature:\n\n      not only intended to protect our children from the evils of illegal\n      drug dealing on school grounds and on school buses, but\n      additionally intended to protect our children from those same\n      evils on or near the playgrounds and recreation centers, whether\n      associated with municipal facilities, school property, or . . .\n      semiprivate apartment complexes.\n\nLewis, 885 A.2d at 57.      Thus, we held that, by incorporating such an\n\nexpansive definition, the General Assembly clearly intended to include pre-\n\nschools within the contours of section 6317. Id. at 57-58. Additionally, we\n\nexplained that “pre-school” fell within the general definition of the word\n\n“school,” which the American Heritage Dictionary defines as “[a]n institution\n\nfor the instruction of children or people under college age.”       Id. at 58\n\n(quoting American Heritage Dictionary (4th ed. 2000)).\n\n      Conversely, Ali contends that the Y.W.C.A. operated a daycare, which\n\nwe held in Commonwealth v. Dixon, 53 A.3d 839 (Pa. Super. 2012), not\n\n                                    - 31 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nto be the type of facility covered by section 6317. In Dixon, we noted, as\n\nwe did in Lewis, that the “legislature clearly intended to segregate children\n\nfrom drugs where they learn and play, and to promote that policy, it created\n\ndrug-free zones within a radius of schools, playgrounds, and recreational\n\nfacilities.”   Dixon, 53 A.3d at 844.     However, we quickly pointed out that\n\ndaycare centers are not equated to schools of any type, including pre-\n\nschools, in any other statutory scheme in Pennsylvania. Id. We also noted\n\nthat, when the General Assembly amended section 6317 in 1997, it\n\nexpanded the provision to include different types of schools that were\n\nentitled to protection, but did not include daycare or childcare facilities in the\n\nexpansion.      Id. at 845.   Moreover, we noted that, when the General\n\nAssembly enacted a provision subjecting methamphetamine laboratory\n\noperators to stricter penalties when those laboratories were near schools and\n\nrecreational facilities, it chose to include nursery schools and daycare\n\nfacilities within that provision.   Id.   We concluded that “the fact that the\n\nlegislature specifically denoted daycare centers in addition to schools\n\nundermines the . . . argument . . . that daycare facilities are schools per se\n\nfor the purpose of the drug-free school zone statute.” Id.\n\n       Furthermore, we applied the rule of lenity, as we must in criminal\n\ncases, and invoked the venerable maxim expressio unius est exclusio\n\nalterius, which establishes the principle that, “where certain things are\n\ndesignated in a statute, all omissions should be understood as exclusions.”\n\nId. at 846 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). In doing so, we\n\n                                      - 32 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nreinforced our holding that a daycare center is not a school for purposes of\n\nsection 6317, opining that “[t]he General Assembly was more than capable\n\nof drafting § 6317 to include daycare or childcare facilities within the\n\nenumerated entities.” Id. (citing Key Sav. & Loan Ass’n v. Louis John\n\nInc., 549 A.2d 988, 991 (Pa. Super. 1988) (“This Court is without authority\n\nto insert a word into a statutory provision where the legislature has failed to\n\nsupply it.”)).\n\n      Finally, we cautioned that, “[i]f the statute was interpreted as reaching\n\nevery place where children routinely learn and play, virtually every home,\n\nyard, neighborhood, street and woods would constitute a drug-free school\n\nzone and any drug offense would fall within the ambit of § 6317.” Id. We\n\nsquarely rejected such an “overly-expansive” rationale. Id.\n\n      Despite the parties’ arguments, we need not determine definitively\n\nwhether the facility operated at the Y.W.C.A. was a daycare center or a pre-\n\nschool.   It is clear that neither case is controlling, and that it is irrelevant\n\nwhether the facility is properly viewed as a daycare center or a pre-school.\n\nThe statutory language utilized in the sentencing enhancement, “public or\n\nprivate elementary or secondary school,” is much more narrow than the\n\nexpansive language used in section 6317.        Nonetheless, our discussion of\n\nthese two cases, particularly Dixon, is relevant here, because we rely upon\n\nmany of the same principles and limitations that we discussed in Dixon.\n\nUpon completing that analysis, we hold that neither a daycare facility nor a\n\n\n\n\n                                     - 33 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\npre-school falls within the clear language contained in the school zone\n\nsentencing enhancement.\n\n      In cases involving statutory interpretation, which is a matter of law,\n\nour standard of review is de novo and our scope of review is plenary.\n\nCommonwealth v. Wilson, 101 A.3d 1151, 1153 (Pa. Super. 2014) (citing\n\nCommonwealth v. Spence, 91 A.3d 44, 46 (Pa. Super. 2014)). We apply\n\nthe following principles that govern our interpretation of a statutory\n\nprovision:\n\n      When construing [provisions] utilized by the General Assembly in\n      a statute, our primary goal is “to ascertain and effectuate the\n      intention of the General Assembly.”         1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(a).\n      “Every statute shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all\n      its provisions.” Id. However, “[w]hen the words of a statute\n      are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be\n      disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.”           Id.\n      § 1921(b). “Words and phrases shall be construed according to\n      the rules of grammar and according to their common and\n      approved usage.” Id. § 1903(a). In other words, if a term is\n      clear and unambiguous, we are prohibited from assigning a\n      meaning to that term that differs from its common everyday\n      usage for the purpose of effectuating the legislature’s intent.\n      Additionally, we must remain mindful that the “General\n      Assembly does not intend a result that is absurd, impossible of\n      execution or unreasonable.” Id. § 1922(1).\n\nCommonwealth v. Cahill, 95 A.3d 298, 301 (Pa. Super. 2014).                   It is\n\naxiomatic that the plain language of a statute is the best indication of the\n\nlegislative intent that gave rise to the statute.\n\n      Words and phrases shall be construed according to the rules of\n      grammar and according to their common and approved usage;\n      but technical words and phrases and such others as have\n      acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning or are defined in\n\n\n                                      - 34 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n          this part, shall be construed according to such peculiar and\n          appropriate meaning or definition.\n\n1 Pa.C.S. § 1903(a).\n\n          As with section 6317, the school zone enhancement plainly seeks to\n\nprotect our children from the evils of illegal drug dealing on school grounds.\n\nHowever, we may not ignore the unambiguous terms used in the\n\nenhancement so as to expand the provision to include those areas or\n\nlocations that are not fairly encompassed by those terms. The enhancement\n\napplies only when the offense occurs within 250 feet of a “public or private\n\nelementary or secondary school.”         204 Pa. Code. § 303.10(b)(2).      No\n\nreasonable argument can be made that a pre-school or daycare facility is a\n\nsecondary school, so we focus our discussion upon whether either of these\n\ntwo entities fall within the common definition of an elementary school.\n\n          The American Heritage College Dictionary defines “elementary school”\n\nas “[a] school for the first four to eight years of a child’s formal education,\n\noften including kindergarten.” American Heritage College Dictionary 452 (4th\n\ned. 2002). It can also be defined more simply as “[t]he first four to eight\n\nyears of formal education.” Id. We are aware of no authoritative definition\n\nthat is any broader.     We cannot assign to the term “elementary school” a\n\nmore expansive definition when that unambiguous term’s meaning is so\n\nclear. To do so would be to disregard the statute’s language in pursuit of its\n\nspirit.\n\n\n\n\n                                      - 35 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\n      A fair reading of the definition and common understanding of\n\n“elementary school” alone precludes a pre-school or a daycare. It becomes\n\neven more true when we consider the definition of “pre-school,” a term\n\nwhich the American Heritage Dictionary defines as “[o]f, for, relating to, or\n\nbeing the early years of childhood before elementary school.” Id. at 1101\n\n(emphasis added).     The term also refers to “a school for preschoolers; a\n\nnursery school.” Id. The dictionary definitions, which provide us with the\n\nbest evidence of the common understanding attributed to certain words,\n\nseparate elementary schools and pre-schools based upon the relevant time\n\nperiod in a child’s life.   In other words, an elementary school does not\n\ninclude a pre-school, and vice-versa, because pre-school necessarily\n\nprecedes elementary school. A fortiori, if a pre-school is not included within\n\nthe term “elementary school,” neither is a daycare facility. Consequently, it\n\ndoes not matter whether the Y.W.C.A. operated a pre-school or a daycare;\n\nneither supports the application of the sentencing enhancement.\n\n      As in Dixon, we are bound both by the rule of lenity, which requires\n\nus to construe penal provisions narrowly, see 1 Pa.C.S. § 1928(b)(1), and\n\nby the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius, as referenced above.\n\nDixon, 53 A.3d at 846. Moreover, if we included these facilities within the\n\nnarrow term used in subsection 303.10(b)(2), we would inflict the harm that\n\nwe cautioned against, and resoundingly rejected, in Dixon, that “every place\n\nwhere children routinely learn and play, virtually every home, yard,\n\nneighborhood, street and woods would constitute a drug-free school zone\n\n                                    - 36 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nand any drug offense [would implicate the sentencing enhancement.]”\n\nDixon, 53 A.3d at 846. As we explained in Dixon, if the General Assembly\n\nwanted to include such facilities within the parameters of the enhancement,\n\nit was capable of doing so. It chose not to, and we lack the authority “to\n\ninsert a word into a statutory provision where the legislature has failed to\n\nsupply it.” Louis John, 549 A.2d at 991.\n\n     We hold that the term “elementary school” encompasses neither a pre-\n\nschool nor a daycare.   Therefore, the trial court erred in considering the\n\ninapplicable school zone enhancement in sentencing Ali.\n\n     Finally, we address Ali’s claim that the trial court erred in considering\n\nthe youth enhancement when fashioning Ali’s sentence. We agree with Ali\n\nthat the trial court should not have considered that enhancement.\n\n     As noted earlier, the youth enhancement requires a trial court to\n\nconsider elevated sentencing guideline ranges when “the court determines\n\nthat the offender distributed a controlled substance to a person or persons\n\nunder the age of 18.” 204 Pa. Code § 303.10(b)(1). Among the crimes for\n\nwhich Ali was convicted were two counts of possession with intent to\n\ndeliver/delivery of a controlled substance to Harper, who was under eighteen\n\non the relevant date. It bears repeating that all parties agree that Ali did\n\nnot actually sell K2 to either of these individuals on May 21, 2012, the date\n\nof the fatal accident. It also is undisputed that Ali was convicted of these\n\ncharges based upon a theory of accomplice liability.      Thus, the question\n\nbecomes whether an accomplice is an “offender” for purposes of the youth\n\n                                   - 37 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nenhancement. We hold that an accomplice is not an offender in this limited\n\ncircumstance.\n\n       Many of the same principles that we applied in our school zone\n\nenhancement analysis apply with equal force in this discussion.      We must\n\nabide by our rules of statutory construction, interpreting the unambiguous\n\nterm “offender” as used in this provision according to its common\n\nunderstanding, and without ignoring that meaning in order to effectuate the\n\nintent of the provision. See Cahill, 95 A.3d at 301; 1 Pa.C.S. § 1903(a).\n\nMoreover, we must construe the manifestly penal provision in accordance\n\nwith the rule of lenity. See 1 Pa.C.S. § 1928(b)(1). We also must bear in\n\nmind that the legislature has the ability to define and include terms\n\naccording to its will, and the absence of a term or definition creates the\n\npresumption that the term intentionally was omitted.       Dixon, 53 A.3d at\n\n846.\n\n       We have found no case law defining the term “offender” as used in the\n\nyouth enhancement.      Black’s Law Dictionary defines an “offender” as “a\n\nperson who has committed a crime.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1110 (8th ed.\n\n2004). Notably, the definition refers only to the primary actor in a crime,\n\nand not to an accomplice or a conspirator. In Pennsylvania, “[a] person is\n\nan accomplice of another person in the commission of an offense if . . . with\n\nthe intent of promoting or facilitating the commission of the offense, he . . .\n\nsolicits such other person to commit it . . . or aids or agrees or attempts to\n\naid such other person in planning or committing it.”               18 Pa.C.S.\n\n                                    - 38 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\n§ 306(c)(1)(i-ii). Hence, under the common understanding of the relevant\n\nterms and provisions, an offender and an accomplice are distinct actors. We\n\nfind no basis upon which to conclude that the usage of one term necessarily\n\nsubsumes the other.     To the contrary, the rule of lenity requires us to\n\nconstrue these terms narrowly; that is, we must conclude that the use of the\n\nword “offender” does not incorporate the concept of accomplice liability. We\n\nfind no indicia within the normal, everyday understanding of the terms or in\n\nthe body or context of the sentencing enhancement provisions that would\n\nenable us to conclude that “offender” includes a primary actor’s accomplices,\n\nas the Commonwealth urges us to do.\n\n     This conclusion is consistent with the established principle that\n\nsentencing enhancements apply only to principal crimes and not to inchoate\n\ncrimes.   Commonwealth v. Adams, 760 A.2d 33, 39 (Pa. Super. 2000)\n\n(citing Description following Guideline Text § 303.10(b) of Sentencing\n\nGuidelines Implementation Manual, 6/13/1997, 5th Ed. at 201) (recognizing\n\nthat the youth and school zone enhancements do not apply to inchoate\n\ncrimes). Although the inchoate crimes and accomplice liability differ in some\n\nways, we nonetheless find no logical basis upon which to distinguish the two\n\nin this context.   If a conspirator is not subject to enhanced sentencing\n\nguidelines for the foreseeable acts of his co-conspirator, the same must be\n\ntrue for an accomplice relative to the principal offender.   Had the General\n\nAssembly wished to include accomplices either within the term “offender” or\n\nwithin the reach of the youth enhancement, it had the authority and ability\n\n                                   - 39 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nto do so. Because it chose not to do so, we must interpret the provision to\n\nexclude accomplices.\n\n       Instantly, Ali was not the actual offender for purposes of the youth\n\nenhancement. The record is abundantly clear that Himed, not Ali, delivered\n\nthe K2 to Harper and/or Crawford on May 21, 2012. Consequently, the trial\n\ncourt erred and abused its discretion in considering the youth enhancement\n\nwhen fashioning Ali’s sentence.\n\n       In sum, we reject Ali’s trial-related claims. We also reject Ali’s claim\n\nthat   application    of    the   youth    and     school   zone    enhancements    are\n\nunconstitutional pursuant to Alleyne. However, we hold that the trial court\n\nerred by permitting the Commonwealth to introduce irrelevant victim impact\n\ntestimony     and    by    considering    the    two   sentencing    enhancements    in\n\nfashioning Ali’s sentence. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of sentence\n\nand remand for a new sentencing proceeding in accordance with this\n\nopinion.4\n\n       Judgment of sentence vacated.             Case remanded for new sentence.\n\nJurisdiction relinquished.\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n4\n      We also note that Ali also has raised a general challenge to the\ndiscretionary aspects of his sentence, in which he argues that his overall\nsentence was unreasonable and unduly excessive. See Brief for Ali at 33-\n34. Because we order a new sentence, this issue is now moot.\n\n\n\n                                          - 40 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D.

Ali appeals his November 26, 2013 judgment of sentence. We\n\nconclude that Ali is not entitled to relief on his trial-related claims. However,\n\nfor the reasons set forth herein, Ali is entitled to a new sentencing\n\nproceeding.     Consequently, we vacate the judgment of sentence and we\n\nremand this case for re-sentencing.\n\n       The trial court set forth the factual and procedural history of this case\n\nin its March 25, 2014 Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a) opinion as follows:\n\n       A Criminal Complaint was filed on June 30, 2012, and [Ali] was\n       ultimately charged with two counts of Corrupt Organizations [18\n       Pa.C.S. § 911]; numerous offenses under the Controlled\n       Substance, Drug, Device, and Cosmetic Act [35 P.S. § 780-113,\n       et seq.]; and two counts of criminal conspiracy [18 Pa.C.S.\n       § 903]. The events that led to these charges began on May 22,\n____________________________________________\n\n\n*\n       Retired Senior Judge assigned to the Superior Court.\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n     2012, around 11:19 a.m., when police officer Michael Breslin,\n     dressed in a t-shirt, jeans, and sneakers, went to a store at 315\n     East High Street in Pottstown, Montgomery County (hereinafter\n     “Achi Store”). Officer Breslin was given twenty dollars of U.S.\n     Currency and his purpose was to buy the drug K2 or synthetic\n     marijuana from the Achi Store.\n\n     After getting an iced tea from the cooler, Officer Breslin stood in\n     line at the cash register and observed cigars and blunts on the\n     wall behind the register, but did not see any K2. Also while\n     standing in line, Officer Breslin noticed two state lottery workers\n     installing or working on a lottery machine and [Ali] was behind\n     the cash register. When it was his turn to pay, Officer Breslin\n     asked [Ali] for a Purple Night Owl blunt and asked if [Ali] had\n     any “Kush,” which Officer Breslin knew as a brand of K2. [Ali]\n     quietly said “no I don’t” while appearing to nervously look over\n     at the state lottery worker. Upon asking if he had any type of\n     K2, [Ali] again said “No, no I don’t.” Officer Breslin purchased\n     the iced tea and Night Owl blunt and left.\n\n     Also on May 22, 2012 around noon, Officer Peter Yambrick\n     entered the Achi Store wearing facial hair, a t-shirt, khaki shorts\n     and flip-flops, with the task of purchasing K2 or synthetic\n     marijuana. Officer Yambrick retrieved a Diet Pepsi and took it to\n     the counter where the cash register is located. [Ali] was behind\n     the cash register and nobody else was in the store at that time.\n     Officer Yambrick asked [Ali] for a Great Phillies blunt, which is a\n     cigar. After [Ali] put the cigar on the counter, Officer Yambrick\n     asked him if he had any K2, to which [Ali] shifted his eyes to\n     look around the store and then responded, “Yeah. Five bucks.\n     How many do you want?” Officer Yambrick told him two. [Ali]\n     again looked around the store and reached underneath the\n     display case, put two containers of K2 on the counter, and slid\n     them toward Officer Yambrick. The officer paid for his items\n     with the pre-recorded U.S. Currency he was given and put the\n     K2 in his pocket.\n\n     After returning to the police station, another plan was developed\n     to send Officer Yambrick back to the Achi Store to see if there\n     were any surveillance cameras that would show the buying and\n     selling of K2. The officer went back to the store at 1:15 p.m.,\n     retrieved a bag of Doritos and got into the checkout line behind\n     another individual. The person in front of Officer Yambrick asked\n     for a cigar, and then a conversation developed between the\n     individual and [Ali], who was behind the counter.          Officer\n\n                                    -2-\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n     Yambrick saw [Ali] look around the store and reach under the\n     display case to retrieve K2 for the individual in front of him.\n\n     Thereafter, around 4:30 p.m. the same day, Sergeant Michael\n     Markovich was working at the Pottstown Police Department and\n     served a search warrant at the Achi Store as a result of his\n     investigations. When he arrived at the store[, Ali] was not\n     present, but his co-defendant Mohammed Himed was working.\n     Retrieved through the search warrant were: $636 laying on top\n     of the open cash register drawer and alongside the register;\n     $247 in a Dutch Masters cigar box that was located underneath\n     the counter; $540 in a Game cigar box found on a shelf\n     underneath the counter; twelve vials of synthetic marijuana\n     hanging right above the box of cash, eleven of which were\n     labeled “Dead Man” and another with the label “Hawaiian Bliss”;\n     clear sandwich bags behind the counter on a shelf; a black\n     plastic bag containing a clear plastic bag filled with green\n     vegetable matter; a marijuana grinder; a .40 caliber semi-\n     automatic handgun found on a small shelf below the counter 2; a\n     white box containing [twenty-four] vials of “Hawaiian Bliss,” or\n     Kush found inside the storage room behind the store; ten glass\n     pipes commonly used to smoke crack cocaine, being sold as\n     pens found in a cup; thirteen glass pipes commonly used to\n     smoke marijuana on a display wall behind the counter; razor\n     blades found underneath the counter; twenty more crack pipe\n     pens found in a black plastic bag underneath the counter; a\n     display rack behind the counter containing cigars, blunts, wraps\n     and rolling papers; copper mesh wires in a box labeled Chore\n     Boy copper scrubbing pads; copper wire found underneath the\n     counter; and a Verizon bill addressed to [Ali].\n        2\n           Both parties stipulated that the .40 caliber Kahr Arms\n        ZA5383 handgun with six rounds in the magazine was\n        lawfully purchased from Federal Coin Exchange in\n        Pottstown by Rafie Ali approximately one week before the\n        search warrant was executed on May 22, 2012.\n\n     [Ali] was ultimately charged with numerous crimes as a result of\n     Sergeant Markovich’s investigation.        Thereafter, a jury trial\n     commenced on June 10, 2013 and ended on June 13, 2013. The\n     jury found [Ali] guilty of the following charges: Count 1; Corrupt\n     Organizations—Association [18 Pa.C.S. § 911(b)(3)]; Count 2;\n     Corrupt Organizations [18 Pa.C.S. § 911(b)(4)]; Counts 3, 4, 5,\n     6, and 7, Possession With Intent to Deliver Synthetic\n     Cannabinoids [35 P.S. § 780-113(a)(30)]; Counts 13, 14, 15,\n\n                                    -3-\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n     16, and 17, Delivery of Paraphernalia [35 P.S. § 780-\n     113(a)(33)]; and Counts 28 and 29, Criminal Conspiracy [18\n     Pa.C.S. § 903].\n\n                               *     *     *\n\n     [At the November 26, 2013 sentencing hearing, the trial court\n     permitted the Commonwealth to introduce victim impact\n     testimony from the families of James Crawford and Rachel Witt,\n     victims of a vehicle crash that allegedly was caused by the use of\n     synthetic marijuana.]      [T]he crimes [Ali] was charged and\n     ultimately convicted of arose from an investigation that occurred\n     as a result of a fatal accident. Detective Robert Turner III was\n     called to the scene of this accident around 11:29 p.m. on May\n     21, 2012. [Fifteen]-year-old Rachel Witt and [twenty-eight]-\n     year-old James Crawford were both killed [in] the vehicle crash.\n     As part of a search warrant, Detective Turner located a bottle of\n     a brownish-green leafy substance in the back of the vehicle,\n     which was labeled “Dead Man.” This substance was confirmed\n     by the National Medical Services lab as containing AM-2201 and\n     JWH-018, also known as synthetic marijuana.\n\n     Roger Malloy was determined to be the driver of the vehicle on\n     the night of the accident and ultimately pled guilty to two counts\n     of Homicide By Vehicle while Driving Under the Influence, and\n     Accidents Involving Personal Injury or Death While Not Properly\n     Licensed. The presence of AM-2201 and delta-9-THC was found\n     in Mr. Malloy’s blood from a toxicology report taken the morning\n     after the accident.\n\n     During [Ali’s] sentencing hearing, the Commonwealth presented\n     testimony from Roger Malloy’s guilty plea, where he admitted to\n     smoking K2 before the accident and to the negative [effects\n     that] it had on him. Additionally, during [Ali’s] trial Dr. Edward\n     Barbieri described the toxic impact synthetic marijuana can have\n     on individuals, even when used in low doses. Finally, during []\n     trial the jury found [Ali] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt [as an\n     accomplice] of delivering synthetic marijuana to James Crawford\n     and Kendall Harper on May 21, 2012, both of whom were in the\n     vehicle involved in the accident that took place the same day.\n\n     [The trial] court granted the Commonwealth’s motion and\n     permitted the Commonwealth to incorporate the victim impact\n     testimony of Benjamin Witt; Lillian Mumford; and Tracy Ann\n     Witt, which they previously gave under oath at the sentencing\n     for Roger Malloy.\n\n                                   -4-\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n                                 *     *     *\n\n      On November 26, 2013, the court sentenced [Ali] to fifteen [to]\n      thirty months in a State Correctional Institution on Count 1,\n      Corrupt Organizations; another fifteen [to] thirty months . . . for\n      Count 2, Corrupt Organizations; Count 3, Possession with Intent\n      to Deliver a Controlled Substance, with a school zone\n      enhancement, not less than twelve nor more than [twenty-four]\n      months; Count 4, Possession with Intent to Deliver a Controlled\n      Substance, again with a school zone enhancement, not less than\n      twelve nor more than [twenty-four] months; Count 5, another\n      Possession with Intent to Deliver a Controlled Substance with a\n      youth enhancement, not less than twelve nor more than\n      [twenty-four] months; and for Count 6, Possession with Intent to\n      Deliver a Controlled Substance with a youth enhancement, not\n      less than [eighteen months] nor more than [thirty-six] months.\n      All sentences [were ordered] to run consecutively and the\n      remaining counts are a sentence of guilt without further penalty.\n\n      [Ali] did not file any post-sentence motions. On December 18,\n      2013, he filed a counseled Notice of Appeal [to] our Superior\n      Court.    [Ali] subsequently complied with [the trial] court’s\n      directive that he produce and serve a Concise Statement of\n      Matters Complained of on Appeal within [twenty-one] days and\n      in accordance with Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure\n      1925(b).\n\nTrial Court Opinion (“T.C.O.”), 3/25/2014, at 1-5, 10-11 (some footnotes\n\nand citations to the notes of testimony omitted). On March 25, 2014, the\n\ntrial court issued an opinion pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a).\n\n      Ali raises the following issues for our consideration:\n\n      1. Whether the Honorable Trial Court erred by applying the\n         school zone enhancement for sentencing purposes because\n         the Commonwealth did not establish that the Y.W.C.A. fell\n         within the ambit of the enhancement?\n\n      2. Whether the Honorable Trial Court erred by determining that\n         the youth enhancement applied for sentencing purposes\n         because the Commonwealth never proved that [Ali] delivered\n         drugs to a minor?\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n       3. Whether the Honorable Trial Court erred by granting the\n          Commonwealth’s motion to introduce victim impact testimony\n          from an unrelated criminal matter when said testimony was\n          irrelevant and prejudicial, and should not have been\n          considered by the court for sentencing purposes?\n\n       4. Whether the Honorable Trial Court violated [Ali’s]\n          constitutional rights by applying sentencing enhancements in\n          violation of Alleyne[1] and whether the sentence imposed\n          was an abuse of discretion?\n\n       5. Whether the Honorable Trial Court erred by preventing [Ali]\n          from publishing exhibit D-6, the laboratory report upon which\n          [Ali] relied for his understanding and belief the substance he\n          sold was legal, since D-6 was admitted into evidence?\n\n       6. Whether the Honorable Trial Court erred by precluding [Ali]\n          from introducing evidence that the handgun found at the Achi\n          store was under the control and dominion of the co-\n          defendant?\n\nBrief for Ali at 4.\n\n       Because we ultimately grant Ali a new sentencing hearing, we begin\n\nwith his trial-related claims, upon which we conclude that Ali is not entitled\n\nto relief. We start with Ali’s fifth stated claim: whether the trial court erred\n\nby prohibiting him from publishing a laboratory report to the jury, which Ali\n\nalleged caused him to believe that selling K2 was legal.\n\n       Ali testified in his own defense at trial. During his direct examination,\n\nAli testified that his co-defendant and business partner, Mohammed Himed,\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1\n       Alleyne v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

To solidify his position and to convince Ali that K2 was\n\nlegal to sell, Himed produced a laboratory report from Triangle Park\n\nLaboratories, Inc., which indicated on the face of the report that Triangle\n\nPark was a DEA Registered Analytical Laboratory.         The report apparently\n\nindicated to Ali that K2 did not contain any substances that were categorized\n\nas controlled substances in Pennsylvania.         Relying upon this report, Ali\n\nbecame convinced that K2 was not illegal, and that selling K2 would not be a\n\ncrime. Ali testified that he truly believed that selling K2 was not illegal and\n\nyielded to Himed’s desire to sell the substance in the Achi Store.\n\n       Neither the authenticity nor the veracity of the laboratory report was\n\nestablished by an expert or other qualified witness.         Nonetheless, Ali’s\n\ncounsel attempted to publish the report to the jury on multiple occasions\n\nover the Commonwealth’s objections.              The trial court sustained the\n\nCommonwealth’s objections. Ali’s counsel admitted that the contents of the\n\nlaboratory report were false, and that he could not offer the document for\n\nthe truth contained therein.          Nonetheless, he argued that, because the\n\ndocument was used to show the effect that it had on Ali, the jury was\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n2\n      Khalil Jones, an employee at the Achi Store, corroborated Ali’s\ntestimony that Ali and Himed disagreed over whether to sell K2 in the Achi\nStore.\n\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nentitled to see the document itself. The trial court permitted Ali’s counsel to\n\nargue to the jury the effect that the document had on Ali, but refused to\n\npublish the document to the jury because the court considered it to be\n\ndouble hearsay if offered for the truth of the contents contained within the\n\nreport, and, perhaps more importantly, factually incorrect.\n\n        On redirect examination, Ali’s counsel asked Ali additional questions\n\nregarding the laboratory report in an attempt to demonstrate that the report\n\nappeared to be authentic and reliable such that Ali’s reliance upon it was\n\nreasonable.     Following another Commonwealth objection, the trial court\n\ninstructed the jury as follows:\n\n        Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this document which is going\n        to be offered into evidence is not being offered for the truth of\n        the matter asserted, meaning you’re never going to see this\n        document, you’re never going to be able to look at it, you’re\n        never going to be able to compare it because it’s never been\n        offered into evidence for the truth of the matter asserted. It is\n        an exception. It is being offered simply as to whether he saw a\n        document and the effect that it had upon him. This is important.\n\nNotes of Testimony (“N.T.”), 6/12/2013, at 150.\n\n        Presently, Ali argues that the jury should have been able to view the\n\ndocument and resolve any credibility disputes, a task relegated solely to the\n\njury.   Ali further maintains that it was necessary for the jury to view the\n\ndocument in order to properly assess his credibility.     Ali asserted that he\n\nsincerely believed that selling K2 was not illegal, which was exclusively\n\nbased upon his reliance on the authenticity and reliability of the report. The\n\nonly way that the jury could have determined whether Ali’s belief was\n\n                                      -8-\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nsincere was to view the document and to determine whether it appeared\n\nworthy   of   belief   on   its   face.    Additionally,   Ali   contends   that   the\n\nCommonwealth opened the door to publication by cross-examining Ali\n\nvigorously about his reliance upon the report. See Brief for Ali at 36.\n\n      We review all matters touching upon the admission of evidence,\n\nincluding the trial court’s gatekeeping function regarding what evidence a\n\njury gets to observe and handle during a trial, for an abuse of discretion.\n\nSee Commonwealth v.

Nonetheless, our Supreme Court has articulated the\n\nfollowing standard with regard to the items that a jury may take with it into\n\nthe deliberation room:\n\n                                          -9-\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n      The underlying reason for excluding certain items from the jury’s\n      deliberations is to prevent placing undue emphasis or credibility\n      on the material, and de-emphasizing or discrediting other items\n      not in the room with the jury. If there is a likelihood the\n      importance of the evidence will be skewed, prejudice may be\n      found; if not, there is no prejudice per se and the error is\n      harmless.\n\nCommonwealth v. Strong, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2322922\"><a href=\"/opinion/2322922/com-v-strong/\"><span class=\"volume\">836</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">884</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 888 (Pa. 2003). Although not\n\ndirectly applicable, we nonetheless find the standard helpful, and we discern\n\nno meaningful basis to distinguish between publication to a jury of an exhibit\n\nand providing the jury with that exhibit during deliberations. Thus, we apply\n\nthis standard to Ali’s claim.\n\n      Here, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by prohibiting Ali from\n\npublishing the controversial laboratory report to the jury. Ali testified that\n\nhe relied upon the report to formulate his honest belief that selling K2 was\n\nnot illegal. Ali’s counsel averred that the document was not being offered as\n\nevidence for the truth of the matter contained therein, but instead to\n\ndemonstrate the effect that the report had on Ali.      However, Ali’s counsel\n\nacknowledged at trial that the contents of the report itself were false. N.T.,\n\n7/12/2013, at 84-90. In explaining why he could not verify the authenticity\n\n(or veracity, for that matter) of the report, counsel also revealed to the trial\n\ncourt that the author of the report had been indicted in New York for his role\n\nin creating the fraudulent report. Id. at 87. The danger that the jury might\n\nskew or place undue emphasis upon the contents of the report is evident.\n\nEven with a cautionary instruction, the potential for the jury to misconstrue\n\nthe document, or be misled by its falsity, simply was too high, and this\n\n                                     - 10 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\novercame whatever probative value may have attached to the document.\n\nThus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying counsel’s request\n\nto publish the report to the jury.\n\n      We also note that, even if we were to conclude that the trial court’s\n\ndecision was erroneous, such an error would have been harmless. Pursuant\n\nto the harmless error doctrine, “an error may be harmless where the\n\nproperly admitted evidence of guilt is so overwhelming and the prejudicial\n\neffect of the error is so insignificant by comparison that it is clear beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that the error could not have contributed to the verdict.”\n\nStrong, 836 A.2d at 887 (citing Commonwealth v. Story, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2389189\"><a href=\"/opinion/2389189/com-v-story/\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">155</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n162 (Pa. 1978)).\n\n      First,   during   direct,   cross,   and   redirect   examination,   Ali   was\n\nquestioned extensively about the report. Through this questioning, the jury\n\nwas apprised of the look of the report, the various markings on the report,\n\nand the lack of authenticating indicia such as a signature by the author.\n\nThus, the jurors were well-informed about the document, rendering the\n\npurported error in precluding them from handling or observing the report\n\nfirst-hand relatively inconsequential.\n\n      Second, the evidence that Ali knew that selling K2 was not legal was\n\noverwhelming, such that any alleged error by the trial court was harmless.\n\nAs noted earlier, Ali contends that the jury needed to observe the document\n\nto assess Ali’s credibility with regard to his claim that he believed that selling\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 11 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nK2 was not illegal.   However, Ali’s own actions while working at the Achi\n\nStore belied his defense.\n\n       When Officer Breslin first asked Ali for K2, there were other people in\n\nthe store. Ali responded nervously, looked at the other people in the store,\n\nand told Officer Breslin that he did not have K2 for sale.     Officer Breslin\n\nasked a second time, and, again, Ali responded quietly and nervously that\n\nhe did not have any. However, when Officer Yambrick entered the store a\n\nshort time later, no one else was inside of the store. He also asked Ali for\n\nK2. This time, Ali looked around the store and, upon seeing that they were\n\nalone, asked Officer Yambrick how much K2 he wanted.         Ali again looked\n\naround the store to make sure that they were alone, reached underneath the\n\ncounter, and produced two containers of K2. Officer Yambrick went back to\n\nthe store later that day and observed Ali selling K2 to a person in front of\n\nhim in line in the same surreptitious manner as Ali had done earlier in the\n\nday.\n\n       This evidence demonstrated that Ali knew that selling K2 was not\n\nwithin the bounds of the law. Ali did not have K2 prominently displayed on\n\nthe counter of the Achi Store as if it were just another product. Rather, he\n\nhad it hidden underneath the counter, and had a separate container there to\n\ncollect the money from those particular sales. When other people were in\n\nthe store, Ali declined to sell K2. He acted suspiciously and nervously until\n\nhe was alone with a customer. It was only then that he sold the K2. By\n\nthemselves, these actions demonstrate that Ali knew that selling K2 was not\n\n                                    - 12 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nlegal. This would render any alleged error by the trial court with regard to\n\nthe laboratory report harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n     Ali next contends that the trial court erred by excluding certain\n\nstatements that were made by co-defendant Himed regarding the possession\n\nand control of the .40 caliber gun that was found when the police executed\n\nthe search warrant on the Achi Store.       Ali legally purchased the handgun\n\napproximately one week before the search warrant was executed. However,\n\nno testimony was presented at trial to establish that Ali ever was seen in\n\nactual possession of the gun. Ali attempted to demonstrate that Himed, who\n\nacted as the head of the business, had exclusive control of the weapon. To\n\ndo so, Ali tried to ask Khalil Jones, an employee of the store, about a\n\nquestion that Jones overheard Himed asking another individual. Ali alleged\n\nat trial that Jones heard Himed asking the unknown person “can you get me\n\nbullets for the gun?” N.T., 7/12/2013, at 12.\n\n     The trial court prohibited Ali’s counsel from asking this question upon\n\nthe basis that it was inadmissible hearsay.     Presently, Ali argues that the\n\nstatement was not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted, but\n\nrather to show “the fact that Himed made the statement and Himed’s state\n\nof mind regarding his ownership and control of the gun.” Brief for Ali at 38.\n\nWe agree with Ali.     The statement was not hearsay.      However, the trial\n\ncourt’s evidentiary error was harmless.\n\n     As noted earlier, we review a trial court’s evidentiary decisions for an\n\nabuse of discretion.     See Brown, supra.        Hearsay is an out-of-court\n\n                                   - 13 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nstatement    offered   to   prove   the   truth   of   the    matter   asserted.\n\nCommonwealth v.

Super. 1983) (citations omitted).\n\n      Here, the statement that Ali’s counsel sought to introduce through\n\nKhalil Jones’ testimony was not hearsay, as it was not being offered for the\n\ntruth of the matter asserted. Jones purportedly would have testified that he\n\noverheard Himed ask someone, “[C]an you get me bullets for the gun?” If\n\nthis statement were offered for its truth, then Ali would have been seeking\n\nto prove that Himed actually wanted to know whether the listener could\n\nobtain bullets.   However, whether that person could do so plainly was not\n\nwhat Ali sought to establish.   Rather, he proffered the statement to show\n\nthat Himed controlled the gun, “a purpose apart” from asserting the truth of\n\nthe statement. See Cassidy, supra.\n\n\n\n\n                                    - 14 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\n      Nonetheless, beyond a reasonable doubt, the error was harmless. The\n\nevidence overwhelmingly established that, in concert with Himed, Ali sold K2\n\nfrom the Achi Store. As we discussed above, Ali evidenced awareness that\n\nselling K2 was illegal. The police officers purchased the substance directly\n\nfrom Ali.    The spoils of the search warrant revealed abundant evidence to\n\nsupport each of the charges of which Ali was convicted. Ali’s introduction of\n\nthis one statement would not have overcome the overwhelming evidence of\n\nguilt. Consequently, Ali is not entitled to relief on his trial claims.\n\n      We turn to Ali’s sentencing challenges. We begin with Ali’s third stated\n\nclaim:      that the trial court erred in permitting certain victim impact\n\ntestimony at sentencing. Ali is entitled to relief on that claim. He must be\n\nafforded a new sentencing hearing.        Having concluded as much, we must\n\nthen review Ali’s remaining claims to determine which (if any) sentencing\n\nenhancements the trial court may impose at resentencing.\n\n      At Ali’s trial, the jury learned of the tragic deaths of Rachel Witt, age\n\nfifteen, and James Crawford, age twenty-eight. On May 21, 2012, Kendall\n\nHarper, Robert Malloy, Roger Malloy, and James Crawford stopped at the\n\nAchi Store to purchase K2 synthetic marijuana, something that Harper had\n\ndone on two prior occasions.      Harper and Crawford entered the store and\n\nreturned to the car shortly thereafter in possession of K2. Undisputedly, it\n\nwas Muhammed Himed, and not Ali, who sold K2 to Harper and Crawford on\n\nthat occasion. See Brief for the Commonwealth at 6. Except for Harper, all\n\nof the individuals smoked the K2.\n\n                                      - 15 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\n      Later that evening, Roger Malloy was driving a vehicle with all of the\n\nabove-referenced individuals as passengers, including Rachel Witt, whom\n\nthey picked up after stopping at the Achi Store. Malloy wrecked the vehicle,\n\nresulting in the deaths of Witt and Crawford.        Evidence of synthetic\n\nmarijuana was found in Roger Malloy’s blood.\n\n      The jury was presented with evidence of the wreck by way of the\n\nfollowing stipulation:\n\n      [] Kendall Harper, date of birth 12-9-95, gave statements to\n      police and if called to testify would say on the evening of May\n      21st, 2012, he was with Roger Malloy, Robert Malloy and James\n      Crawford. Roger drove everyone to the Achi Store in a Lincoln\n      Continental and Kendall and James went inside the store.\n\n      When they returned to the Lincoln Continental, they drove to\n      another location and picked up Rachel Witt. Roger then drove\n      everybody to Bright Hope Villiage. While there, James Crawford\n      produced K2 and everybody smoked it except Kendall. The K2\n      was rolled up in a Dutch to smoke it. Kendall says the color of\n      the K2’s label was red and yellow and it was marked as Dead\n      Man.\n\n      Kendall has purchased K2 from the Achi store on two prior\n      occasions. Kendall described the person who sold him the K2 on\n      these occasions as being a Muslim male with long hair. Kendall\n      explained the manner in which he bought the K2 as he would\n      have to wait until the store was empty. The Muslim male took\n      the K2 from underneath the counter and it was not on display.\n\n      [] The person that sold the synthetic marijuana labeled Dead\n      Man which was sold on the evening of May 21, 2012, from the\n      store to James Crawford and Kendall Harper was not identified\n      as Rafie Ali.\n\nN.T., 6/11/2013, at 132-33.\n\n\n\n\n                                   - 16 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\n     Roger Malloy pleaded guilty to two counts of homicide by vehicle while\n\ndriving under the influence and related crimes based upon his role in Witt’s\n\nand Crawford’s deaths. See T.C.O. at 10. Despite the fact that Ali did not\n\nsell the synthetic marijuana to Harper and Crawford on the night of the\n\ncrash, at Ali’s sentencing, the trial court permitted the Commonwealth to\n\nintroduce evidence from Roger Malloy’s guilty plea hearing, including\n\nMalloy’s admission to smoking K2 before driving the vehicle and the victim\n\nimpact testimony given by members of the decedents’ families at Malloy’s\n\nguilty plea hearing.   The trial court acknowledged that the jury could not\n\nhave attributed the deaths to Ali, but nonetheless offered the following\n\nrationale for admitting and considering the victim impact testimony:\n\n     [D]uring the month of May, the sale to community members, the\n     sale to undercover officers, and sadly, the sale to Mr. Crawford,\n     Mr. Harper, that ultimately was connected to the death of Miss\n     Witt and [Mr. Crawford] . . . . Which directly led to his death is\n     being considered by the Court [sic].\n\n     Now, again, I make specific findings that there is nothing that\n     a jury—and this court had severed that case that they\n     caused the death. And there was nothing to find that.\n\n     But the Commonwealth has presented evidence in this particular\n     case that the substances found in Mr. Malloy’s system and\n     clearly the timing of exactly what happened on that tragic day,\n     that sad and tragic day that Mr. Crawford and Miss Witt lost their\n     lives at the hands of Mr. Malloy are connected.\n\n     And they’re connected to what you do, Mr. Ali, exactly what you\n     do. If you peddle death and dangerous substances, you can\n     expect something like this to happen. This is within the purview\n     of being a business owner. If you take the risk, you should\n     expect it. This is a stop and shop. This is not a sit-down store\n     where people come in and dine. It is meant to buy something\n     and go.\n\n                                   - 17 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n     And when people buy something and go in the nature of\n     convenience stores in this society, they do so by vehicle. They\n     drive up and they drive away. And if you sell them something\n     that can lead to their death, that can lead to them being\n     impaired, then this is a consequence that should be readily\n     known to you.\n\n     The sad part of it is you didn’t. I believe you simply were\n     operating for profit, you took a risk, and your risk ended up\n     contributing, leading, being connected to, whatever you want to\n     say—the Court is not finding that you caused their death\n     directly, but you certainly were connected to a series of\n     horrific events that led to unspeakable tragedy for the\n     families that this Court had to listen to during the\n     sentencing phase of Mr. Malloy’s case. So I cannot turn a\n     blind eye to it. It is simply a fact. And that was the tragic turn\n     of events that now leads to your conviction and your sentencing.\n\nN.T., 11/26/2013, at 77-78 (emphases added).         By the trial court’s own\n\nadmissions, although Ali was not directly responsible for the two deaths, the\n\ncourt considered the victim impact statements related to those deaths when\n\nsentencing Ali because the court believed that they were “connected.” For\n\nthe reasons that follow, we conclude that considering such evidence was\n\nerroneous, and constituted an abuse of discretion.\n\n     We review challenges to the admission of victim impact statements for\n\nan abuse of discretion.

Victim impact evidence is\n\n“designed to show [] each victim’s uniqueness as a human being.” Payne,\n\n501 U.S. at 823 (citation omitted).      “Victim impact evidence is simply\n\n\n                                    - 19 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nanother form or method of informing the sentencing authority about the\n\nspecific harm caused by the crime in question.” Id. at 825.\n\n      However,    as   section   9738   makes   clear,   before   victim   impact\n\nstatements may be admitted at a sentencing hearing, there first must be an\n\nidentifiable victim of the crime for which the defendant was convicted. See\n\n42 Pa.C.S. § 9738 (“[A] court shall not order the exclusion of any victim of\n\nthe offense. . . .”). Indeed, “[w]here a defendant is convicted of a crime\n\nagainst a person, that person is considered by the law to have been a victim\n\nof the defendant’s crimes.” Commonwealth v. Smithton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2328757\"><a href=\"/opinion/2328757/com-v-smithton/\"><span class=\"volume\">631</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1053</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1057 (Pa. Super. 1993). Instantly, Ali was not convicted of a crime against\n\na person. Moreover, for the crimes of which Ali was convicted, there is no\n\nidentifiable victim to render a victim impact statement admissible.          The\n\nparties and the trial court have conceded that Ali did not sell K2 to any of\n\nthe parties involved in the wreck that resulted in the two deaths.         As the\n\nCommonwealth acknowledged, Himed, not Ali, sold the K2 to Harper and\n\nCrawford, K2 which Roger Malloy ingested before wrecking the car.            See\n\nBrief for the Commonwealth at 6.\n\n      Both the Commonwealth and the trial court rely upon the premise that\n\nthere existed a “connection” between Ali’s crimes and the ultimate deaths of\n\nWitt and Crawford.       See Brief for the Commonwealth at 23; N.T.,\n\n11/26/2013, at 77-78. Although such a connection may in fact exist, a mere\n\nlink between two distinct events is insufficient to trigger the applicability of\n\nsection 9738. The unambiguous language of the statute requires a victim to\n\n                                     - 20 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nbe identified as such before his or her victim impact statement is admissible.\n\nAdditionally, the Crime Victim’s Act requires proof of a “direct victim” and\n\nsimilarly situated individuals; it does not define a “victim” based upon the\n\nCommonwealth’s ability to string together attenuated connectors tying an\n\nindividual to indirectly-related events, tragic as those events may be.\n\n      Witt and Crawford’s deaths were tragic.     However, those individuals\n\nare not Ali’s victims under any reasonable reading of section 9738,\n\nparticularly where all parties admit that Ali did not commit the specific act\n\nthat led to the fatal wreck. We find no meaningful difference between this\n\ncase and Smithton. In Smithton, the appellant had been charged in three\n\nseparate criminal informations. In one of the cases, the appellant, who was\n\nsuffering from HIV, allegedly unlawfully entered a family’s home without\n\ntheir consent. Smithton, 631 A.2d at 1055. The owner of the home fought\n\noff the appellant with a shard of glass from a broken window through which\n\nthe appellant entered the home.       Id. at 1054.     At trial, the appellant\n\nconceded entering into the home, but argued that his entry was justified\n\nbecause he feared for his life. One of the other sets of charges arose from\n\nthe appellant’s behavior during his arrest and at the hospital after he was\n\ntransported there by the police. The final set of charges resulted from the\n\nappellant’s behavior at his arraignment for the prior two sets of charges. Id.\n\nat 1054-55.\n\n      The jury credited the appellant’s defense that he was justified in\n\nentering the home, and acquitted him of all charges relating to that incident.\n\n                                    - 21 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nThe jury convicted him of all of the other charges.                    Nonetheless, at\n\nsentencing, the trial court permitted the family residing in the home to\n\ntestify at length about how the appellant’s entry into the home affected\n\nthem and their lives, including their fears that they may have contracted HIV\n\nfrom the appellant. Id. at 1055-56.\n\n      On appeal, this Court reversed the judgment of sentence and\n\nremanded for a new sentencing hearing to be held without the victim impact\n\ntestimony. We first noted that, because the appellant was acquitted of the\n\ncharges relating to the entry into the home, the victim impact testimony was\n\nirrelevant. Id. at 1057. Essentially, we held that, due to the acquittals, the\n\nhomeowners were not victims of the alleged crime.                  We explained that\n\n“there   is,   strictly   speaking,   no     legal   authority   for   considering    the\n\n[homeowners] ‘victims’ or for considering the impact of appellant’s conduct\n\non their lives.”    Id. at 1058.      Critically, we rejected the notion that any\n\nconnection justified the admission of the victim impact testimony:                   “The\n\ncharges of which appellant was found guilty, though indirectly related by the\n\nloosely formed concatenation of events [that] transpired on the evening of\n\nappellant’s arrests, were contained in separate Criminal Informations and did\n\nnot involve the [homeowners.]” Id. We held that to admit the testimony\n\n“would give precious little meaning to the acquittal.” Id.\n\n      In describing the need to vacate the sentence, we noted that “[i]t is an\n\nabuse of discretion, as a denial of due process, for the sentencing court to\n\nconsider   irrelevant     factors   during sentencing.”          Id.   at 1056.       We\n\n                                           - 22 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nacknowledged that “[i]t is not enough that a trial court simply entertained\n\nimpermissible evidence in its deliberations.”    Id. (emphasis in original).\n\nAlthough a court “is ordinarily presumed to be capable of identifying and\n\nproperly disregarding all but the      most prejudicial and inflammatory\n\nevidence,” Commonwealth v. Penrod, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">578</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">486</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 491 (Pa. Super.\n\n1990), a sentence must be vacated when “it reasonably appears from the\n\nrecord that the trial court relied in whole or in part upon such [an\n\nimpermissible] factor.”   Commonwealth v. Bethea, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1468447\"><a href=\"/opinion/1468447/com-v-bethea/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 106\n\n(Pa. 1977) (emphasis in original).       Citing Bethea, we concluded in\n\nSmithton that, although “[i]t is true that the trial court relied upon factors\n\nother than the [homeowners’] testimony in imposing sentence, . . . [i]t is\n\nalso irrelevant for our purposes. Where, as here, a trial court relies upon an\n\nimpermissible factor, in whole or in part, new sentencing must be\n\nafforded.” Smithton, 631 A.2d at 1058 (citing Bethea, supra; emphasis in\n\noriginal).\n\n      As in Smithton, there is no basis upon which we may conclude that\n\nWitt and Crawford were victims of the crimes of which Ali was convicted.\n\nThe charges against Ali did not implicate the fatal car accident. We reject\n\nthe trial court’s attempt to connect the relevant events in order to justify\n\nadmitting the victim impact testimony, just as we did in Smithton. The trial\n\ncourt’s own words demonstrate that the court relied to some extent upon\n\nthe victim impact testimony just as the trial court did in Smithton.     That\n\ntestimony was irrelevant, and reliance upon that evidence violated due\n\n                                    - 23 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nprocess. See Smithton, 631 A.2d at 1056. Consequently, the trial court\n\nabused its discretion, and we must vacate the judgment of sentence and\n\nremand for a new sentencing hearing at which the trial court may not\n\nconsider the victim impact testimony. See Bethea, supra.\n\n     The remainder of Ali’s issues that we will review pertain to the trial\n\ncourt’s consideration of the school zone sentencing enhancement and the\n\nenhancement for delivery of a controlled substance to a youth (“youth\n\nenhancement”)     when   calculating    where      Ali’s    offense    fell       within   the\n\nsentencing guidelines. Pursuant to 204 Pa. Code § 303.10(b)(2), the school\n\nzone enhancement compels a trial court to consider heightened guideline\n\nranges when “the court determines that the offender manufactured,\n\ndelivered or possessed with intent to deliver a controlled substance within\n\n250 feet of the real property on which is located a public or private\n\nelementary or secondary school.”        Id.     Similarly, the youth enhancement\n\nrequires the trial court to consider elevated guideline ranges in sentencing\n\nan individual when “the court determines that the offender distributed a\n\ncontrolled substance to a person or persons under the age of 18.” Id. at §\n\n303.10(b)(1).\n\n     We   begin   with   Ali’s   contention      that      the   application       of   these\n\nenhancements was unconstitutional in light of the United States Supreme\n\nCourt’s recent decision in Alleyne v.

Alleyne, supra\n      at 2163. Alleyne is an extension of the Supreme Court’s line of\n      cases beginning with Apprendi v. New Jersey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n      (2000). In Alleyne, the Court overruled Harris v. United\n      States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121164\"><a href=\"/opinion/121164/harris-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">545</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002), in which the Court had reached\n      the opposite conclusion, explaining that there is no constitutional\n      distinction between judicial fact[-]finding which raises the\n      minimum sentence and that which raises the maximum\n      sentence.\n\n         It is impossible to dissociate the floor of a sentencing\n         range from the penalty affixed to the crime. Indeed,\n         criminal statutes have long specified both the floor and\n         ceiling of sentence ranges, which is evidence that both\n         define the legally prescribed penalty.       This historical\n         practice allowed those who violated the law to know, ex\n         ante, the contours of the penalty that the legislature\n         affixed to the crime—and comports with the obvious truth\n         that the floor of a mandatory range is as relevant to\n         wrongdoers as the ceiling.       A fact that increases a\n         sentencing floor, thus, forms an essential ingredient of the\n         offense.\n\n\n                                    - 25 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n         Moreover, it is impossible to dispute that facts increasing\n         the legally prescribed floor aggravate the punishment.\n         Elevating the low-end of a sentencing range heightens the\n         loss of liberty associated with the crime: the defendant’s\n         expected punishment has increased as a result of the\n         narrowed range and the prosecution is empowered, by\n         invoking the mandatory minimum, to require the judge to\n         impose a higher punishment than he might wish. Why\n         else would Congress link an increased mandatory\n         minimum to a particular aggravating fact other than to\n         heighten the consequences for that behavior? This reality\n         demonstrates that the core crime and the fact triggering\n         the mandatory minimum sentence together constitute a\n         new, aggravated crime, each element of which must be\n         submitted to the jury.\n\n      Alleyne, [133 S.Ct.] at 2160-61 (internal quotation marks and\n      citations omitted).\n\nMiller, 102 A.3d at 994-95 (citations modified).\n\n      Alleyne has no application to the sentencing enhancements at issue in\n\nthis case.   The parameters of Alleyne are limited to the imposition of\n\nmandatory minimum sentences, i.e., where a legislature has prescribed a\n\nmandatory baseline sentence that a trial court must apply if certain\n\nconditions are met. The sentencing enhancements at issue impose no such\n\nfloor. Rather, the enhancements only direct a sentencing court to consider a\n\ndifferent range of potential minimum sentences, while preserving a trial\n\ncourt’s discretion to fashion an individual sentence. By their very character,\n\nsentencing enhancements do not share the attributes of a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence that the Supreme Court held to be elements of the\n\noffense that must be submitted to a jury. The enhancements do not bind a\n\ntrial court to any particular sentencing floor, nor do they compel a trial court\n\n\n                                     - 26 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nin any given case to impose a sentence higher than the court believes is\n\nwarranted.    They require only that a court consider a higher range of\n\npossible minimum sentences. Even then, the trial court need not sentence\n\nwithin that range; the court only must consider it. Thus, even though the\n\ntriggering facts must be found by the judge and not the jury—which is one\n\nof the elements of an Apprendi or Alleyne analysis—the enhancements\n\nthat the trial court applied in this case are not unconstitutional under\n\nAlleyne.\n\n       Ali maintains that, because both of the enhancements contain the\n\nword “shall,” the enhancements are mandatory in nature, and must fall\n\nwithin Alleyne’s holding. However, the enhancements only require the trial\n\ncourt to consider a certain range of sentences. The enhancements do not\n\nbind the trial court to impose any particular sentence, nor do they compel\n\nthe court to sentence within the specified range. Indeed, it is well-settled\n\nthat    the   sentencing    guidelines   ultimately    are   only   advisory.\n\nCommonwealth v. Griffin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2159772\"><a href=\"/opinion/2159772/com-v-griffin/\"><span class=\"volume\">804</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 8 (Pa.

Thus,\n\nAlleyne has no application to the enhancements.\n\n       Ali next argues that the trial court should not have applied the school\n\nzone enhancement, because the Commonwealth failed to prove that the\n\nY.W.C.A. constituted a “public or private elementary or secondary school,”\n\nwithin the meaning of subsection 303.10(b)(2). We agree with Ali.\n\n       The utilization of a sentencing enhancement concerns the trial court’s\n\napplication of the sentencing guidelines, and, therefore, implicates the\n\n                                    - 27 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\ndiscretionary aspects of Ali’s sentence.

Rather, a party who desires to raise such\n      matters must petition this court for permission to appeal and\n      demonstrate that there is a substantial question that the\n      sentence is inappropriate.\n\n      In fulfilling this requirement, the party seeking to appeal must\n      include in his or her brief a concise statement of the reasons\n      relied upon in support of the petition for allowance of appeal\n      [pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 2119(f). In that statement, the appellant\n      must demonstrate that there exists a substantial question that\n      the sentence is inappropriate under the Sentencing Code.]\n\n                                  *     *       *\n\n      The determination of whether a substantial question exists must\n      be made on a case-by-case basis. It is only where an aggrieved\n      party can articulate clear reasons why the sentence issued by\n      the trial court compromises the sentencing scheme as a whole\n      that we will find a substantial question and review the decision of\n      the trial court. This [C]ourt has been inclined to find that a\n      substantial question exists where the appellant advances a\n      colorable argument that the sentencing judge’s actions were\n      either: (1) inconsistent with a specific provision of the\n      Sentencing Code; or (2) contrary to the fundamental norms\n      underlying the sentencing process.\n\nId. at 551 (citations omitted).\n\n      Ali has complied technically with Pa.R.A.P. 2119(f) by including a\n\nconcise statement in his brief.

At\n\nthe first sentencing hearing on October 8, 2013, Ali stipulated to a\n\nCommonwealth report that contained a summary of information, to which a\n\npolice officer would have testified had he been called, pertaining to the\n\nY.W.C.A. at issue for the school zone sentencing enhancement. The report\n\nindicated that the Y.W.C.A. was located within 250 feet of the Achi Store,\n\nthat the Y.W.C.A. operated a state-licensed early learning center with a full\n\ndaycare program that is entitled “Ready, Set, Grow,” and that the Y.W.C.A.\n\nwas in operation at the time of Ali’s crimes.     Ali also stipulated to the\n\nadmissibility and the authenticity of a photograph of the Y.W.C.A., which\n\n\n\n\n                                   - 29 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nindicated on the door of the facility that the Y.W.C.A. considered itself a pre-\n\nschool. N.T., 10/8/2013, at 9-11; N.T., 11/26/2013, at 11.\n\n       There is very little case law addressing the school zone enhancement,\n\nand none interprets the terms “public or private elementary or secondary\n\nschool.”    Consequently, we first consider two cases that have addressed\n\nwhether a daycare or a pre-school falls within the ambit of the drug-free\n\nschool zone mandatory minimum sentence that is codified at 18 Pa.C.S.\n\n§ 3617.3 Section 3617 purports to impose a mandatory minimum sentence\n\non individuals over the age of eighteen who deliver, or possess with intent to\n\ndeliver, a controlled substance “within 1,000 feet of the real property on\n\nwhich is located a public, private or parochial school or a college or\n\nuniversity or within 250 feet of the real property on which is located a\n\nrecreation center or playground or on a school bus.”       18 Pa.C.S. § 3617.\n\nHowever, even though both the mandatory minimum provision and the\n\nsentencing enhancement seek to increase penalties for drug trafficking near\n\nschool zones, the operative language in the two sections differs in such a\n\nway that the two cases interpreting the provisions do not apply to the\n\nsentencing enhancements at issue herein.\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n3\n      Section 3617 was held unconstitutional by this Court in\nCommonwealth v. Watley, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">108</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Pa. Super. 2013). Nonetheless,\nthe unconstitutionality of this mandatory minimum sentence has no bearing\nupon our analysis.\n\n\n\n                                          - 30 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\n      Because no case law yet has addressed whether the sentencing\n\nenhancement applies to drug offenses near daycares or pre-schools, the\n\nparties predictably have relied upon the two cases addressing the drug-free\n\nschool zone mandatory minimum sentence. The Commonwealth argues that\n\nthe Y.W.C.A. operated a pre-school, and that Commonwealth v. Lewis,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1479352\"><a href=\"/opinion/1479352/com-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">885</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Pa.

Super. 2001) (en banc), we noted\n\nthat, by enacting section 6317, our legislature:\n\n      not only intended to protect our children from the evils of illegal\n      drug dealing on school grounds and on school buses, but\n      additionally intended to protect our children from those same\n      evils on or near the playgrounds and recreation centers, whether\n      associated with municipal facilities, school property, or . . .\n      semiprivate apartment complexes.\n\nLewis, 885 A.2d at 57.      Thus, we held that, by incorporating such an\n\nexpansive definition, the General Assembly clearly intended to include pre-\n\nschools within the contours of section 6317. Id. at 57-58. Additionally, we\n\nexplained that “pre-school” fell within the general definition of the word\n\n“school,” which the American Heritage Dictionary defines as “[a]n institution\n\nfor the instruction of children or people under college age.”       Id. at 58\n\n(quoting American Heritage Dictionary (4th ed. 2000)).\n\n      Conversely, Ali contends that the Y.W.C.A. operated a daycare, which\n\nwe held in Commonwealth v. Dixon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">839</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Pa. Super. 2012), not\n\n                                    - 31 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nto be the type of facility covered by section 6317. In Dixon, we noted, as\n\nwe did in Lewis, that the “legislature clearly intended to segregate children\n\nfrom drugs where they learn and play, and to promote that policy, it created\n\ndrug-free zones within a radius of schools, playgrounds, and recreational\n\nfacilities.”   Dixon, 53 A.3d at 844.     However, we quickly pointed out that\n\ndaycare centers are not equated to schools of any type, including pre-\n\nschools, in any other statutory scheme in Pennsylvania. Id. We also noted\n\nthat, when the General Assembly amended section 6317 in 1997, it\n\nexpanded the provision to include different types of schools that were\n\nentitled to protection, but did not include daycare or childcare facilities in the\n\nexpansion.      Id. at 845.   Moreover, we noted that, when the General\n\nAssembly enacted a provision subjecting methamphetamine laboratory\n\noperators to stricter penalties when those laboratories were near schools and\n\nrecreational facilities, it chose to include nursery schools and daycare\n\nfacilities within that provision.   Id.   We concluded that “the fact that the\n\nlegislature specifically denoted daycare centers in addition to schools\n\nundermines the . . . argument . . . that daycare facilities are schools per se\n\nfor the purpose of the drug-free school zone statute.” Id.\n\n       Furthermore, we applied the rule of lenity, as we must in criminal\n\ncases, and invoked the venerable maxim expressio unius est exclusio\n\nalterius, which establishes the principle that, “where certain things are\n\ndesignated in a statute, all omissions should be understood as exclusions.”\n\nId. at 846 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). In doing so, we\n\n                                      - 32 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nreinforced our holding that a daycare center is not a school for purposes of\n\nsection 6317, opining that “[t]he General Assembly was more than capable\n\nof drafting § 6317 to include daycare or childcare facilities within the\n\nenumerated entities.” Id. (citing Key Sav. & Loan Ass’n v. Louis John\n\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">988</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 991 (Pa. Super. 1988) (“This Court is without authority\n\nto insert a word into a statutory provision where the legislature has failed to\n\nsupply it.”)).\n\n      Finally, we cautioned that, “[i]f the statute was interpreted as reaching\n\nevery place where children routinely learn and play, virtually every home,\n\nyard, neighborhood, street and woods would constitute a drug-free school\n\nzone and any drug offense would fall within the ambit of § 6317.” Id. We\n\nsquarely rejected such an “overly-expansive” rationale. Id.\n\n      Despite the parties’ arguments, we need not determine definitively\n\nwhether the facility operated at the Y.W.C.A. was a daycare center or a pre-\n\nschool.   It is clear that neither case is controlling, and that it is irrelevant\n\nwhether the facility is properly viewed as a daycare center or a pre-school.\n\nThe statutory language utilized in the sentencing enhancement, “public or\n\nprivate elementary or secondary school,” is much more narrow than the\n\nexpansive language used in section 6317.        Nonetheless, our discussion of\n\nthese two cases, particularly Dixon, is relevant here, because we rely upon\n\nmany of the same principles and limitations that we discussed in Dixon.\n\nUpon completing that analysis, we hold that neither a daycare facility nor a\n\n\n\n\n                                     - 33 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\npre-school falls within the clear language contained in the school zone\n\nsentencing enhancement.\n\n      In cases involving statutory interpretation, which is a matter of law,\n\nour standard of review is de novo and our scope of review is plenary.\n\nCommonwealth v. Wilson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1151</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1153 (Pa. Super. 2014) (citing\n\nCommonwealth v.

Super. 2014)). We apply\n\nthe following principles that govern our interpretation of a statutory\n\nprovision:\n\n      When construing [provisions] utilized by the General Assembly in\n      a statute, our primary goal is “to ascertain and effectuate the\n      intention of the General Assembly.”         1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(a).\n      “Every statute shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all\n      its provisions.” Id. However, “[w]hen the words of a statute\n      are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be\n      disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.”           Id.\n      § 1921(b). “Words and phrases shall be construed according to\n      the rules of grammar and according to their common and\n      approved usage.” Id. § 1903(a). In other words, if a term is\n      clear and unambiguous, we are prohibited from assigning a\n      meaning to that term that differs from its common everyday\n      usage for the purpose of effectuating the legislature’s intent.\n      Additionally, we must remain mindful that the “General\n      Assembly does not intend a result that is absurd, impossible of\n      execution or unreasonable.” Id. § 1922(1).\n\nCommonwealth v. Cahill, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 301 (Pa. Super. 2014).                   It is\n\naxiomatic that the plain language of a statute is the best indication of the\n\nlegislative intent that gave rise to the statute.\n\n      Words and phrases shall be construed according to the rules of\n      grammar and according to their common and approved usage;\n      but technical words and phrases and such others as have\n      acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning or are defined in\n\n\n                                      - 34 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n          this part, shall be construed according to such peculiar and\n          appropriate meaning or definition.\n\n1 Pa.C.S. § 1903(a).\n\n          As with section 6317, the school zone enhancement plainly seeks to\n\nprotect our children from the evils of illegal drug dealing on school grounds.\n\nHowever, we may not ignore the unambiguous terms used in the\n\nenhancement so as to expand the provision to include those areas or\n\nlocations that are not fairly encompassed by those terms. The enhancement\n\napplies only when the offense occurs within 250 feet of a “public or private\n\nelementary or secondary school.”         204 Pa. Code. § 303.10(b)(2).      No\n\nreasonable argument can be made that a pre-school or daycare facility is a\n\nsecondary school, so we focus our discussion upon whether either of these\n\ntwo entities fall within the common definition of an elementary school.\n\n          The American Heritage College Dictionary defines “elementary school”\n\nas “[a] school for the first four to eight years of a child’s formal education,\n\noften including kindergarten.” American Heritage College Dictionary 452 (4th\n\ned. 2002). It can also be defined more simply as “[t]he first four to eight\n\nyears of formal education.” Id. We are aware of no authoritative definition\n\nthat is any broader.     We cannot assign to the term “elementary school” a\n\nmore expansive definition when that unambiguous term’s meaning is so\n\nclear. To do so would be to disregard the statute’s language in pursuit of its\n\nspirit.\n\n\n\n\n                                      - 35 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\n      A fair reading of the definition and common understanding of\n\n“elementary school” alone precludes a pre-school or a daycare. It becomes\n\neven more true when we consider the definition of “pre-school,” a term\n\nwhich the American Heritage Dictionary defines as “[o]f, for, relating to, or\n\nbeing the early years of childhood before elementary school.” Id. at 1101\n\n(emphasis added).     The term also refers to “a school for preschoolers; a\n\nnursery school.” Id. The dictionary definitions, which provide us with the\n\nbest evidence of the common understanding attributed to certain words,\n\nseparate elementary schools and pre-schools based upon the relevant time\n\nperiod in a child’s life.   In other words, an elementary school does not\n\ninclude a pre-school, and vice-versa, because pre-school necessarily\n\nprecedes elementary school. A fortiori, if a pre-school is not included within\n\nthe term “elementary school,” neither is a daycare facility. Consequently, it\n\ndoes not matter whether the Y.W.C.A. operated a pre-school or a daycare;\n\nneither supports the application of the sentencing enhancement.\n\n      As in Dixon, we are bound both by the rule of lenity, which requires\n\nus to construe penal provisions narrowly, see 1 Pa.C.S. § 1928(b)(1), and\n\nby the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius, as referenced above.\n\nDixon, 53 A.3d at 846. Moreover, if we included these facilities within the\n\nnarrow term used in subsection 303.10(b)(2), we would inflict the harm that\n\nwe cautioned against, and resoundingly rejected, in Dixon, that “every place\n\nwhere children routinely learn and play, virtually every home, yard,\n\nneighborhood, street and woods would constitute a drug-free school zone\n\n                                    - 36 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nand any drug offense [would implicate the sentencing enhancement.]”\n\nDixon, 53 A.3d at 846. As we explained in Dixon, if the General Assembly\n\nwanted to include such facilities within the parameters of the enhancement,\n\nit was capable of doing so. It chose not to, and we lack the authority “to\n\ninsert a word into a statutory provision where the legislature has failed to\n\nsupply it.” Louis John, 549 A.2d at 991.\n\n     We hold that the term “elementary school” encompasses neither a pre-\n\nschool nor a daycare.   Therefore, the trial court erred in considering the\n\ninapplicable school zone enhancement in sentencing Ali.\n\n     Finally, we address Ali’s claim that the trial court erred in considering\n\nthe youth enhancement when fashioning Ali’s sentence. We agree with Ali\n\nthat the trial court should not have considered that enhancement.\n\n     As noted earlier, the youth enhancement requires a trial court to\n\nconsider elevated sentencing guideline ranges when “the court determines\n\nthat the offender distributed a controlled substance to a person or persons\n\nunder the age of 18.” 204 Pa. Code § 303.10(b)(1). Among the crimes for\n\nwhich Ali was convicted were two counts of possession with intent to\n\ndeliver/delivery of a controlled substance to Harper, who was under eighteen\n\non the relevant date. It bears repeating that all parties agree that Ali did\n\nnot actually sell K2 to either of these individuals on May 21, 2012, the date\n\nof the fatal accident. It also is undisputed that Ali was convicted of these\n\ncharges based upon a theory of accomplice liability.      Thus, the question\n\nbecomes whether an accomplice is an “offender” for purposes of the youth\n\n                                   - 37 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nenhancement. We hold that an accomplice is not an offender in this limited\n\ncircumstance.\n\n       Many of the same principles that we applied in our school zone\n\nenhancement analysis apply with equal force in this discussion.      We must\n\nabide by our rules of statutory construction, interpreting the unambiguous\n\nterm “offender” as used in this provision according to its common\n\nunderstanding, and without ignoring that meaning in order to effectuate the\n\nintent of the provision. See Cahill, 95 A.3d at 301; 1 Pa.C.S. § 1903(a).\n\nMoreover, we must construe the manifestly penal provision in accordance\n\nwith the rule of lenity. See 1 Pa.C.S. § 1928(b)(1). We also must bear in\n\nmind that the legislature has the ability to define and include terms\n\naccording to its will, and the absence of a term or definition creates the\n\npresumption that the term intentionally was omitted.       Dixon, 53 A.3d at\n\n846.\n\n       We have found no case law defining the term “offender” as used in the\n\nyouth enhancement.      Black’s Law Dictionary defines an “offender” as “a\n\nperson who has committed a crime.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1110 (8th ed.\n\n2004). Notably, the definition refers only to the primary actor in a crime,\n\nand not to an accomplice or a conspirator. In Pennsylvania, “[a] person is\n\nan accomplice of another person in the commission of an offense if . . . with\n\nthe intent of promoting or facilitating the commission of the offense, he . . .\n\nsolicits such other person to commit it . . . or aids or agrees or attempts to\n\naid such other person in planning or committing it.”               18 Pa.C.S.\n\n                                    - 38 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\n§ 306(c)(1)(i-ii). Hence, under the common understanding of the relevant\n\nterms and provisions, an offender and an accomplice are distinct actors. We\n\nfind no basis upon which to conclude that the usage of one term necessarily\n\nsubsumes the other.     To the contrary, the rule of lenity requires us to\n\nconstrue these terms narrowly; that is, we must conclude that the use of the\n\nword “offender” does not incorporate the concept of accomplice liability. We\n\nfind no indicia within the normal, everyday understanding of the terms or in\n\nthe body or context of the sentencing enhancement provisions that would\n\nenable us to conclude that “offender” includes a primary actor’s accomplices,\n\nas the Commonwealth urges us to do.\n\n     This conclusion is consistent with the established principle that\n\nsentencing enhancements apply only to principal crimes and not to inchoate\n\ncrimes.   Commonwealth v. Adams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1509855\"><a href=\"/opinion/1509855/com-v-adams/\"><span class=\"volume\">760</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 39 (Pa. Super. 2000)\n\n(citing Description following Guideline Text § 303.10(b) of Sentencing\n\nGuidelines Implementation Manual, 6/13/1997, 5th Ed. at 201) (recognizing\n\nthat the youth and school zone enhancements do not apply to inchoate\n\ncrimes). Although the inchoate crimes and accomplice liability differ in some\n\nways, we nonetheless find no logical basis upon which to distinguish the two\n\nin this context.   If a conspirator is not subject to enhanced sentencing\n\nguidelines for the foreseeable acts of his co-conspirator, the same must be\n\ntrue for an accomplice relative to the principal offender.   Had the General\n\nAssembly wished to include accomplices either within the term “offender” or\n\nwithin the reach of the youth enhancement, it had the authority and ability\n\n                                   - 39 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\n\nto do so. Because it chose not to do so, we must interpret the provision to\n\nexclude accomplices.\n\n       Instantly, Ali was not the actual offender for purposes of the youth\n\nenhancement. The record is abundantly clear that Himed, not Ali, delivered\n\nthe K2 to Harper and/or Crawford on May 21, 2012. Consequently, the trial\n\ncourt erred and abused its discretion in considering the youth enhancement\n\nwhen fashioning Ali’s sentence.\n\n       In sum, we reject Ali’s trial-related claims. We also reject Ali’s claim\n\nthat   application    of    the   youth    and     school   zone    enhancements    are\n\nunconstitutional pursuant to Alleyne. However, we hold that the trial court\n\nerred by permitting the Commonwealth to introduce irrelevant victim impact\n\ntestimony     and    by    considering    the    two   sentencing    enhancements    in\n\nfashioning Ali’s sentence. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of sentence\n\nand remand for a new sentencing proceeding in accordance with this\n\nopinion.4\n\n       Judgment of sentence vacated.

See Brief for Ali at 33-\n34. Because we order a new sentence, this issue is now moot.\n\n\n\n                                          - 40 -\n\fJ-A25028-14\n\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D.
