Petitioners appeal from a final\n\ndecision     of     the    New     Jersey   Commissioner       of   Education\n\n(Commissioner) dismissing the petition. We affirm.\n\n\n\n2\n  In 1995, the State Board of Education (State Board) authorized\nthe removal of the Newark Board of Education and the creation of\nthe SOSD. Contini v. Bd. of Educ. of Newark, 286 N.J. Super. 106,\n113-14 (App. Div. 1995), certif. denied, 145 N.J. 372 (1996). On\nSeptember 13, 2017, the State Board voted to begin the process for\nreturning the Newark schools to local control.\n\n                                       2                                A-5351-14T3\n\f                                   I.\n\n     Petitioners include three individuals who are residents and\n\ntaxpayers of Newark; four students who were attending Newark public\n\nhigh schools when the petition was filed; twelve individuals who\n\nwere employed as teachers in Newark's school district at that\n\ntime; and six parents with children who were then attending the\n\nNewark    public   schools.   Petitioners   named   the   SOSD   and   Cami\n\nAnderson, who was then superintendent of the SOSD, as respondents.\n\n     In their administrative action, petitioners challenged the\n\nimplementation of the \"One Newark Plan,\" which petitioners claimed\n\nhad been developed behind closed doors and involved the district-\n\nwide restructuring of Newark's public schools. Among other things,\n\nthe plan provided for the closure of certain neighborhood schools\n\nand the leasing of the vacant school facilities to organizations\n\nfor the operation of charter schools.\n\n     In count two, petitioners allege that the plan violates the\n\nrights of Newark students to a thorough and efficient education,\n\nas guaranteed by the New Jersey Constitution. N.J. Const. art.\n\nVIII, § IV, ¶ 1. Petitioners allege that the plan would have a\n\ndisproportionate impact upon the district's African-American and\n\nHispanic students, as well as severely disadvantaged children in\n\nNewark.   Petitioners   claim   that    replacing   public   schools   with\n\n\n\n                                    3                              A-5351-14T3\n\fcharter    schools   would       leave    Newark's    \"neediest\"       students      to\n\nlanguish in schools that are failing or less successful.\n\n       In count three, petitioners claim that the \"One Newark Plan\"\n\nviolates the Charter School Program Act of 1995 (CSPA), N.J.S.A.\n\n18A:36A-1 to -18. Petitioners allege that under the plan, public\n\nschools would be converted to charter schools without compliance\n\nwith   N.J.S.A.    18A:36A-4(b).         The    statute    permits     a    currently\n\nexisting public school to become a charter school if at least\n\nfifty-one percent of the teaching staff and fifty-one percent of\n\nparents or guardians of pupils attending the school sign a petition\n\nsupporting the conversion. Ibid. Petitioners allege that the SOSD\n\nwas engaging in the \"stealth conversion\" of existing public schools\n\nby closing the schools and thereafter leasing the closed school\n\nbuildings to organizations for the operation of charter schools.\n\n       In count three, petitioners further allege that the plan\n\nviolates   the    CSPA    because    it    allows    the   SOSD   to       make   final\n\ndecisions as to the students who will be permitted to enroll in\n\ncharter    schools   on    the    basis    of   a   \"sophisticated         mathematic\n\nequation/algorithm.\" According to petitioners, such a student-\n\nselection process violates N.J.S.A. 18A:36-7 and N.J.S.A. 18A:36-\n\n8, which govern the charter-school enrollment process.\n\n       In addition, in count four, petitioners allege the plan \"falls\n\nshort of eradicating the corrosive segregated environment that\n\n                                          4                                   A-5351-14T3\n\fpervades\" the district. Petitioners assert that fifty-one percent\n\nof the students enrolled in the Newark public schools are African-\n\nAmerican; forty percent are of Hispanic origin; and about eight\n\npercent are non-Hispanic whites. Petitioners claim that children\n\nwho attend racially-segregated schools receive an education that\n\nis inferior to the education of children enrolled in predominantly-\n\nwhite suburban school districts in Essex County.\n\n     Petitioners      assert     that     the     alleged    de    facto      racial\n\nsegregation   of    the   Newark     schools      violates   the    thorough      and\n\nefficient clause of the State's Constitution, N.J. Const. art.\n\nVIII, § 4, ¶ 1, and the provision of the State Constitution that\n\nbars segregation of schools on the basis of race, color, ancestry,\n\nand national origin, N.J. Const. art. I, § 5.\n\n     In   their     request    for      relief,     petitioners      sought:        an\n\ninjunction enjoining the SOSD from further implementation of the\n\n\"One Newark Plan\"; to terminate all contracts with charter-school\n\norganizations      that   assume     control      of   closed      public     school\n\nfacilities;   a    declaration     that     the   concentration      of     African-\n\nAmerican and Hispanic children in the Newark school district is\n\nthe result of de facto segregation, in violation of the New Jersey\n\nConstitution; establishment of a plan to eliminate the alleged\n\nunconstitutional de facto segregation of the Newark schools by\n\ncreating a county-wide or region-wide school district, which would\n\n                                        5                                    A-5351-14T3\n\finclude   the   predominantly   white   Essex   County   suburban    school\n\ndistricts; and other relief.\n\n     When they filed their petition, petitioners also filed an\n\napplication for emergent relief. The Commissioner referred the\n\nmatter to the Office of Administrative Law for proceedings before\n\nan Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). Petitioners later withdrew\n\ntheir request for emergent relief. In September 2014, the ALJ\n\nconducted a case management conference and expressed her concern\n\nthat petitioners had not named certain indispensable parties,\n\nincluding the Commissioner and the State Board.\n\n     Thereafter, petitioners filed a motion to amend the petition\n\nto add the Commissioner and the State Board as respondents.\n\nHowever, in October 2014, petitioners withdrew that motion and\n\nelected to proceed only against the respondents named in the\n\npetition. Thereafter, respondents filed a motion to dismiss the\n\npetition on various grounds, and petitioners opposed the motion.\n\nIn January 2015, the ALJ heard oral argument on the motion.\n\n     On April 28, 2015, the ALJ filed an initial decision granting\n\nthe motion and dismissing the petition in its entirety. On June\n\n15, 2015, the Commissioner issued a final decision dismissing the\n\npetition for the reasons stated by the ALJ. This appeal followed.\n\n     On appeal, petitioners argue: (1) the ALJ and the Commissioner\n\nfailed to review the motion to dismiss in accordance with the\n\n                                   6                                A-5351-14T3\n\festablished standard of review; (2) the ALJ erroneously found that\n\nthe claims in counts two and three of the petition had not been\n\ntimely filed; (3) they have standing to assert the claims in the\n\npetition; (4) the \"One Newark Plan\" violates the constitutional\n\nright of Newark students to a \"thorough and efficient\" education;\n\n(5) the \"One Newark Plan\" violates the CSPA; and (6) they were not\n\nrequired   to     join    the   Commissioner,    State    Board,      or       the\n\npredominantly-white Essex County suburban school districts as\n\nindispensable     parties   with   regard   to   the   claim    of   de     facto\n\nsegregation of the Newark public schools.\n\n                                     II.\n\n     We first consider petitioners' contention that the ALJ and\n\nCommissioner failed to consider respondents' motion to dismiss\n\nunder the appropriate standard of review. Petitioners argue that\n\nthe applicable standard is either the standard for a motion for\n\ninvoluntary dismissal of civil actions under Rule 4:37-2(b), or a\n\nmotion   for    summary   decision   in    administrative      actions      under\n\nN.J.A.C. 1:1-12.5(b). We disagree.\n\n     Here, respondents filed a motion to dismiss under N.J.A.C.\n\n6A:3-1.5(g), which allows a party to file a motion to dismiss a\n\npetition in a dispute arising under the school laws in lieu of\n\nfiling an answer. The motion is comparable to a motion under Rule\n\n\n\n                                      7                                   A-5351-14T3\n\f4:6-2(e) to dismiss a complaint in a civil action for failure to\n\nstate a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n\n     When reviewing a Rule 4:6-2(e) motion, a court must determine\n\nthe adequacy of the pleading and decide whether a cause of action\n\nis \"suggested\" by the facts. Printing Mart-Morristown v. Sharp\n\nElecs. Corp., 116 N.J. 739, 746 (1989) (quoting Velantzas v.\n\nColgate-Palmolive Co., 109 N.J. 189, 192 (1988)). The court must\n\n\"search[] the complaint in depth and with liberality to ascertain\n\nwhether the fundament of a cause of action may be gleaned even\n\nfrom an obscure statement of claim, opportunity being given to\n\namend if necessary.\" Ibid. (quoting Di Cristofaro v. Laurel Grove\n\nMem'l Park, 43 N.J. Super. 244, 252 (App. Div. 1957)).\n\n     In ruling on the motion, the ALJ correctly applied the\n\nstandard for dismissal based on the failure to state a claim in\n\ndetermining: (1) whether petitioners had standing to assert the\n\nclaims in the complaint; (2) whether petitioners filed the claims\n\nin counts two and three within the time required; (3) whether\n\npetitioners stated a valid claim    that the \"One Newark Plan\"\n\nviolates N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-4(b); and (4) whether petitioners failed\n\nto name indispensable parties with regard to their claim that the\n\nplan violated the enrollment mandates for charter schools in the\n\nCSPA and the claim of de facto segregation of the Newark schools\n\non the basis of race, color, ancestry, or national origin.\n\n                                8                            A-5351-14T3\n\f     We reject petitioners' contention that the ALJ should have\n\napplied the standards set forth in Rule 4:37-2(b) when ruling on\n\nrespondents' motion to dismiss. The court rule applies at trial\n\nin civil actions after the plaintiff has presented its evidence.\n\nIbid. The rule allows the court to dismiss the complaint if, based\n\nupon a review of the facts and the law, \"the plaintiff has shown\n\nno right to relief.\" Ibid. The standard for granting such a motion\n\ndoes not apply to a motion to dismiss a petition filed with the\n\nCommissioner under N.J.A.C. 6A:3-1.5(g).\n\n     We also reject petitioners' contention that respondents'\n\nmotion to dismiss was essentially a motion for summary decision\n\nof   an   administrative   action       under   N.J.A.C.   1:1-12.5(b).\n\nPetitioners argue that under that rule, summary decision may not\n\nbe granted if there are genuine issues of material fact.\n\n     The summary decision rule does not, however, apply here.\n\nRespondents did not seek summary decision. They sought dismissal\n\nof the petition under N.J.A.C. 6A:3-1.5(g). As we have explained,\n\nthe motion was the administrative equivalent to a motion to dismiss\n\na civil action under Rule 4:6-2(e) for failure to state a claim\n\nupon which relief can be granted.\n\n     We therefore conclude that the ALJ and Commissioner applied\n\nthe correct standard in ruling on respondents' motion to dismiss.\n\n\n\n                                    9                           A-5351-14T3\n\f                               III.\n\n     We next consider petitioners' argument that the ALJ erred by\n\nfinding that the claims regarding the \"One Newark Plan\" in counts\n\ntwo and three of the petition were not filed within the time\n\nrequired by N.J.A.C. 6A:3-1.3(i). The rule provides that a petition\n\nof appeal to the Commissioner in a dispute arising under the school\n\nlaws must be filed \"no later than the 90th day from the date of\n\nreceipt of the notice of a final order, ruling, or other action\n\nby the district board of education[.]\" Ibid.\n\n     In her decision, the ALJ noted that counts two and three of\n\nthe petition challenged the SOSD's implementation of the \"One\n\nNewark Plan.\" The ALJ observed that the SOSD had announced on\n\nNovember 21, 2013, that it would be implementing the plan and the\n\nSOSD described the plan in detail. Moreover, on December 18, 2013,\n\nthe SOSD publicly announced specifics of the plan. In addition,\n\nin February 2014, the SOSD issued a pamphlet, which again discussed\n\ndetails of the plan that would be implemented.\n\n     The ALJ and the Commissioner determined that at a minimum,\n\npetitioners should have filed the claims in counts two and three\n\nwithin ninety days after the SOSD issued the pamphlet about the\n\nplan in February 2014. The record supports that determination.\n\n     It is well established that the ninety-day-limitation period\n\n\"provides a measure of repose\" and it is \"an essential element in\n\n                               10                           A-5351-14T3\n\fthe proper and efficient administration of the school laws.\" Kaprow\n\nv. Bd. of Educ. of Berkeley Twp., 131 N.J. 572, 582 (1993). \"The\n\nlimitation period gives school districts the security of knowing\n\nthat   administrative   decisions      regarding    the    operation   of    the\n\nschool cannot be challenged after ninety days.\" Ibid.\n\n       We conclude that the ALJ and Commissioner correctly found\n\nthat    petitioners   failed    to     assert   their      claims    regarding\n\nimplementation of the \"One Newark Plan\" within the time required\n\nby N.J.A.C. 6A:3-1.3(i). Therefore, the dismissal of the claims\n\nin counts two and three of the petition was proper.\n\n                                      IV.\n\n       Petitioners argue that the ALJ and Commissioner erred by\n\ndismissing the claims that the plan violated the CSPA. We disagree.\n\n       A. Closing of Schools/Leasing of Space for Charter Schools\n\n       Here,   petitioners   allege    that   the   plan   allowed     for   the\n\n\"stealth conversion\" of public schools without complying with\n\nN.J.S.A. 18A:36A-4(b). The statute provides in pertinent part that\n\na district may convert a \"currently existing public school\" to a\n\ncharter school if fifty-one percent of the school's teachers and\n\nfifty-one percent of the parents or guardians of students attending\n\nthe school sign petitions approving the change. Ibid.\n\n       Petitioners allege that under the \"One Newark Plan,\" the SOSD\n\nwas closing certain public schools and then leasing the vacant\n\n                                      11                                A-5351-14T3\n\fspace in those schools to organizations that would use the space\n\nto   operate    charter     schools.   Petitioners     maintain     that   this\n\nprovision of the plan represents an impermissible end-run around\n\nthe process in the CSPA for converting existing public schools to\n\ncharter schools.\n\n      However, as the ALJ and Commissioner recognized, a school\n\ndistrict has the discretion to close a school that the district\n\nno longer requires for the education of students. Furthermore, the\n\nSOSD also has statutory authority to lease vacant space in school\n\nbuildings to other persons or organizations. N.J.S.A. 18A:20-8.2.\n\nThe ALJ and the Commissioner correctly found that because the SOSD\n\nwas not converting a \"currently existing public school\" to a\n\ncharter school, N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-4(b) did not apply.\n\n      We will not set aside an administrative decision if it is\n\nconsistent     with   the   applicable      law,   supported   by   sufficient\n\ncredible evidence in the record, and not arbitrary, capricious,\n\nor unreasonable. Saccone v. Bd. of Trs. of Police & Firemen's Ret.\n\nSys., 219 N.J. 369, 380 (2014). The ALJ and the Commissioner's\n\ndetermination that the SOSD was not engaged in the conversion of\n\ncurrently existing public schools to charter schools is consistent\n\nwith the plain language of the statute and supported by sufficient\n\ncredible evidence in the record. The decision is not arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, or unreasonable.\n\n                                       12                              A-5351-14T3\n\f       B. Enrollment Plan for Charter Schools\n\n       Petitioners also claim that the \"One Newark Plan\" violated\n\nthe CSPA because it includes an enrollment process for charter\n\nschools that violates the requirements of the CSPA. In support of\n\nthis argument, petitioners cite N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-7, which states\n\nthat charter schools shall \"be open to all students on a space\n\navailable    basis.\"    They   also    cite   N.J.S.A.   18A:36A-8,     which\n\nprovides that charters must give preference to local students,\n\npriority to siblings, and enroll a cross section of the community's\n\nschool-age population, \"including racial and academic factors.\"\n\n       Petitioners argue that they alleged sufficient facts to show\n\nthat   the   plan's    enrollment     process   violates   the   enrollment\n\nmandates in the CSPA. The ALJ did not, however, address the merits\n\nof this claim. Instead, the ALJ decided that the claim could not\n\nbe considered because petitioners failed to name indispensable\n\nparties.\n\n       An indispensable party is one who has \"an interest inevitably\n\ninvolved in the subject matter before the court and a judgment\n\ncannot justly be made between litigants without either adjudging\n\nor necessarily affecting the absentee's interest.\" Allen B. Du\n\nMont Labs., Inc. v. Marcalus Mfg. Co., 30 N.J. 290, 298 (1959).\n\nThe ALJ stated that, \"Under this standard, it is readily apparent\n\nthat these affected charter schools have a clear stake in this\n\n                                      13                              A-5351-14T3\n\flitigation, and that the rights that petitioners seek to vindicate,\n\nwould, in part, require an order directing that the charter schools\n\ncomply with N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-7 and N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-8.\"\n\n     The ALJ determined that without the participation of the\n\nunnamed charter schools, complete relief could not be granted. The\n\nCommissioner adopted the ALJ's findings and conclusion on this\n\nissue. We conclude that the ALJ and the Commissioner correctly\n\nfound that the unnamed charter schools whose enrollment processes\n\nwere at issue were indispensable parties to the dispute.\n\n     These organizations clearly have a stake in the resolution\n\nof   the   claims     regarding      their    enrollment       plans.     Because\n\npetitioners     had      not   joined      these   organizations         in    the\n\nadministrative action, the ALJ and the Commissioner correctly\n\nfound   that   petitioners'     claim      regarding    the    charter     school\n\nenrollment     process    in   the   \"One    Newark    Plan\"    could    not     be\n\nconsidered.\n\n     We    therefore      conclude    that    in   addition      to     correctly\n\ndismissing the claims in count three as untimely, the ALJ and the\n\nCommissioner correctly determined that the claim regarding the\n\nalleged violation of N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-4(b) failed as a matter of\n\nlaw, and the claim regarding the alleged unlawful enrollment plan\n\nfor charter schools could not be considered because petitioners\n\nfailed to name indispensable parties.\n\n                                      14                                  A-5351-14T3\n\f                                   V.\n\n     Petitioners also claim that the \"One Newark Plan\" was a\n\n\"feeble attempt to address and ameliorate\" what petitioners allege\n\nis the de facto segregation of the Newark public schools on the\n\nbasis of race, color, ancestry, and national origin. Petitioners\n\nallege that such de facto segregation violates the New Jersey\n\nConstitution.\n\n     Among the other relief requested in this action, petitioners\n\nsought a remedial plan to address the alleged unconstitutional de\n\nfacto segregation of the Newark public schools. They sought a\n\nmandate   requiring   the   inclusion   of   predominantly-white     Essex\n\nCounty suburban school districts within a county-wide or regional\n\nplan \"that would effectively desegregate\" the Newark public school\n\nsystem.\n\n     The ALJ dismissed this claim because petitioners failed to\n\nname indispensable parties, specifically, the Commissioner, the\n\nState Board, and the Essex County suburban school districts that\n\nwould be affected by such a remedial order. The Commissioner\n\nadopted the ALJ's decision on this issue.\n\n     On appeal, petitioners argue that the Commissioner, State\n\nBoard, and potentially-affected suburban school districts would\n\nnot be indispensable parties until there has been a finding of\n\nunconstitutional de facto segregation of the Newark schools. We\n\n                                  15                               A-5351-14T3\n\fcannot agree. We affirm the dismissal of this claim substantially\n\nfor the reasons stated by the ALJ in her initial decision, which\n\nwas adopted by the Commissioner.\n\n     As the ALJ noted, the petition does not merely treat the\n\nCommissioner as a decision-maker. It asserts a claim against the\n\nCommissioner, alleging that the Commissioner has not met his\n\nstatutory and constitutional obligation to desegregate the Newark\n\npublic schools. Furthermore, it is well established that only the\n\nCommissioner has the power to \"cross district lines to avoid\n\n'segregation in fact.'\" Jenkins v. Morris Twp. Sch. Dist., 58 N.J.\n\n483, 501 (1971) (quoting Booker v. Bd. of Educ., 45 N.J. 161, 168\n\n(1965)). Thus, the Commissioner is an indispensable party to any\n\nclaim in which a party seeks a multi-district, remedial order\n\naddressing alleged de facto segregation of a district's schools.\n\n     We reject as entirely without merit any suggestion that the\n\nCommissioner's interest would only involve the remedy for the\n\nalleged de facto segregation of the Newark schools. Clearly, the\n\nCommissioner would have an interest in any findings of the relevant\n\nfacts, as well as determining whether a remedy is required.\n\n     Moreover,   the   potentially-affected   Essex   County   suburban\n\nschool districts also are indispensable parties to the claim of\n\nde facto segregation of the Newark schools. As we have explained,\n\npetitioners are seeking to create a regional, county-wide school\n\n                                 16                             A-5351-14T3\n\fsystem that would include the suburban school districts in Essex\n\nCounty. As the ALJ stated in her decision:\n\n           Regionalization county-wide would implicate\n           the delivery of educational services to each\n           and every public school student in Essex\n           County. A failure to join each Essex County\n           school district would plainly impede the\n           ability of these districts to protect their\n           interests. See R. 4[:]28-1(a). Moreover, any\n           order directing such desegregation would call\n           upon the neighboring districts to take the\n           steps needed to effectuate such a broad\n           ranging and monumental change in the delivery\n           of   educational   services;  to  include   a\n           potential consolidation of staff, school\n           buildings,   equipment,   and  administrative\n           services. Without the participation of these\n           districts, \"complete relief could not be\n           accorded among those already parties.\" Ibid.\n\n    We therefore conclude that the ALJ and the Commissioner\n\ncorrectly decided to dismiss the claim of de facto segregation\n\nbecause   petitioners   failed   to   name   the   Commissioner   and   the\n\naffected suburban school districts as indispensable parties. For\n\nessentially the same reasons, the State Board should also have\n\nbeen named as a party.\n\n    We note that in her decision, the ALJ found that only three\n\npetitioners had standing to raise claims that the \"One Newark\n\nPlan\" violated the right to a thorough and efficient education\n\nunder the New Jersey Constitution. These petitioners were the\n\nparents of three students who had attended public schools that\n\nwere closed under the \"One Newark Plan.\"\n\n                                  17                               A-5351-14T3\n\f     The ALJ nevertheless found that these petitioners had not\n\nalleged specific facts to show that the education of the three\n\nstudents   had    been   disrupted   or   otherwise   impaired   by     their\n\nassignments to other schools. The ALJ therefore concluded that the\n\nclaims relating to these three students were not justiciable\n\nbecause they would essentially require the Commissioner to render\n\nan advisory ruling.\n\n     In    view   of     our   decision   affirming   the   dismissal        of\n\npetitioners' claims on other grounds, we need not determine whether\n\nthe other petitioners had standing to assert claims that the \"One\n\nNewark Plan\" violates the students' rights to a thorough and\n\nefficient education, or whether the claims of the three parents\n\nfound to have standing are justiciable.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     18                               A-5351-14T3\n\f",

Petitioners   named   the   SOSD   and   Cami\n\nAnderson, who was then superintendent of the SOSD, as respondents.\n\n     In their administrative action, petitioners challenged the\n\nimplementation of the \"One Newark Plan,\" which petitioners claimed\n\nhad been developed behind closed doors and involved the district-\n\nwide restructuring of Newark's public schools. Among other things,\n\nthe plan provided for the closure of certain neighborhood schools\n\nand the leasing of the vacant school facilities to organizations\n\nfor the operation of charter schools.\n\n     In count two, petitioners allege that the plan violates the\n\nrights of Newark students to a thorough and efficient education,\n\nas guaranteed by the New Jersey Constitution. N.J. Const. art.\n\nVIII, § IV, ¶ 1. Petitioners allege that the plan would have a\n\ndisproportionate impact upon the district's African-American and\n\nHispanic students, as well as severely disadvantaged children in\n\nNewark.   Petitioners   claim   that    replacing   public   schools   with\n\n\n\n                                    3                              A-5351-14T3\n\fcharter    schools   would       leave    Newark's    \"neediest\"       students      to\n\nlanguish in schools that are failing or less successful.\n\n       In count three, petitioners claim that the \"One Newark Plan\"\n\nviolates the Charter School Program Act of 1995 (CSPA), N.J.S.A.\n\n18A:36A-1 to -18. Petitioners allege that under the plan, public\n\nschools would be converted to charter schools without compliance\n\nwith   N.J.S.A.    18A:36A-4(b).         The    statute    permits     a    currently\n\nexisting public school to become a charter school if at least\n\nfifty-one percent of the teaching staff and fifty-one percent of\n\nparents or guardians of pupils attending the school sign a petition\n\nsupporting the conversion. Ibid. Petitioners allege that the SOSD\n\nwas engaging in the \"stealth conversion\" of existing public schools\n\nby closing the schools and thereafter leasing the closed school\n\nbuildings to organizations for the operation of charter schools.\n\n       In count three, petitioners further allege that the plan\n\nviolates   the    CSPA    because    it    allows    the   SOSD   to       make   final\n\ndecisions as to the students who will be permitted to enroll in\n\ncharter    schools   on    the    basis    of   a   \"sophisticated         mathematic\n\nequation/algorithm.\" According to petitioners, such a student-\n\nselection process violates N.J.S.A. 18A:36-7 and N.J.S.A. 18A:36-\n\n8, which govern the charter-school enrollment process.\n\n       In addition, in count four, petitioners allege the plan \"falls\n\nshort of eradicating the corrosive segregated environment that\n\n                                          4                                   A-5351-14T3\n\fpervades\" the district. Petitioners assert that fifty-one percent\n\nof the students enrolled in the Newark public schools are African-\n\nAmerican; forty percent are of Hispanic origin; and about eight\n\npercent are non-Hispanic whites. Petitioners claim that children\n\nwho attend racially-segregated schools receive an education that\n\nis inferior to the education of children enrolled in predominantly-\n\nwhite suburban school districts in Essex County.\n\n     Petitioners      assert     that     the     alleged    de    facto      racial\n\nsegregation   of    the   Newark     schools      violates   the    thorough      and\n\nefficient clause of the State's Constitution, N.J. Const. art.\n\nVIII, § 4, ¶ 1, and the provision of the State Constitution that\n\nbars segregation of schools on the basis of race, color, ancestry,\n\nand national origin, N.J. Const. art. I, § 5.\n\n     In   their     request    for      relief,     petitioners      sought:        an\n\ninjunction enjoining the SOSD from further implementation of the\n\n\"One Newark Plan\"; to terminate all contracts with charter-school\n\norganizations      that   assume     control      of   closed      public     school\n\nfacilities;   a    declaration     that     the   concentration      of     African-\n\nAmerican and Hispanic children in the Newark school district is\n\nthe result of de facto segregation, in violation of the New Jersey\n\nConstitution; establishment of a plan to eliminate the alleged\n\nunconstitutional de facto segregation of the Newark schools by\n\ncreating a county-wide or region-wide school district, which would\n\n                                        5                                    A-5351-14T3\n\finclude   the   predominantly   white   Essex   County   suburban    school\n\ndistricts; and other relief.\n\n     When they filed their petition, petitioners also filed an\n\napplication for emergent relief. The Commissioner referred the\n\nmatter to the Office of Administrative Law for proceedings before\n\nan Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). Petitioners later withdrew\n\ntheir request for emergent relief. In September 2014, the ALJ\n\nconducted a case management conference and expressed her concern\n\nthat petitioners had not named certain indispensable parties,\n\nincluding the Commissioner and the State Board.\n\n     Thereafter, petitioners filed a motion to amend the petition\n\nto add the Commissioner and the State Board as respondents.\n\nHowever, in October 2014, petitioners withdrew that motion and\n\nelected to proceed only against the respondents named in the\n\npetition. Thereafter, respondents filed a motion to dismiss the\n\npetition on various grounds, and petitioners opposed the motion.\n\nIn January 2015, the ALJ heard oral argument on the motion.\n\n     On April 28, 2015, the ALJ filed an initial decision granting\n\nthe motion and dismissing the petition in its entirety. On June\n\n15, 2015, the Commissioner issued a final decision dismissing the\n\npetition for the reasons stated by the ALJ. This appeal followed.\n\n     On appeal, petitioners argue: (1) the ALJ and the Commissioner\n\nfailed to review the motion to dismiss in accordance with the\n\n                                   6                                A-5351-14T3\n\festablished standard of review; (2) the ALJ erroneously found that\n\nthe claims in counts two and three of the petition had not been\n\ntimely filed; (3) they have standing to assert the claims in the\n\npetition; (4) the \"One Newark Plan\" violates the constitutional\n\nright of Newark students to a \"thorough and efficient\" education;\n\n(5) the \"One Newark Plan\" violates the CSPA; and (6) they were not\n\nrequired   to     join    the   Commissioner,    State    Board,      or       the\n\npredominantly-white Essex County suburban school districts as\n\nindispensable     parties   with   regard   to   the   claim    of   de     facto\n\nsegregation of the Newark public schools.\n\n                                     II.\n\n     We first consider petitioners' contention that the ALJ and\n\nCommissioner failed to consider respondents' motion to dismiss\n\nunder the appropriate standard of review. Petitioners argue that\n\nthe applicable standard is either the standard for a motion for\n\ninvoluntary dismissal of civil actions under Rule 4:37-2(b), or a\n\nmotion   for    summary   decision   in    administrative      actions      under\n\nN.J.A.C. 1:1-12.5(b). We disagree.\n\n     Here, respondents filed a motion to dismiss under N.J.A.C.\n\n6A:3-1.5(g), which allows a party to file a motion to dismiss a\n\npetition in a dispute arising under the school laws in lieu of\n\nfiling an answer. The motion is comparable to a motion under Rule\n\n\n\n                                      7                                   A-5351-14T3\n\f4:6-2(e) to dismiss a complaint in a civil action for failure to\n\nstate a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n\n     When reviewing a Rule 4:6-2(e) motion, a court must determine\n\nthe adequacy of the pleading and decide whether a cause of action\n\nis \"suggested\" by the facts.

The court rule applies at trial\n\nin civil actions after the plaintiff has presented its evidence.\n\nIbid. The rule allows the court to dismiss the complaint if, based\n\nupon a review of the facts and the law, \"the plaintiff has shown\n\nno right to relief.\" Ibid. The standard for granting such a motion\n\ndoes not apply to a motion to dismiss a petition filed with the\n\nCommissioner under N.J.A.C. 6A:3-1.5(g).\n\n     We also reject petitioners' contention that respondents'\n\nmotion to dismiss was essentially a motion for summary decision\n\nof   an   administrative   action       under   N.J.A.C.   1:1-12.5(b).\n\nPetitioners argue that under that rule, summary decision may not\n\nbe granted if there are genuine issues of material fact.\n\n     The summary decision rule does not, however, apply here.\n\nRespondents did not seek summary decision. They sought dismissal\n\nof the petition under N.J.A.C. 6A:3-1.5(g). As we have explained,\n\nthe motion was the administrative equivalent to a motion to dismiss\n\na civil action under Rule 4:6-2(e) for failure to state a claim\n\nupon which relief can be granted.\n\n     We therefore conclude that the ALJ and Commissioner applied\n\nthe correct standard in ruling on respondents' motion to dismiss.\n\n\n\n                                    9                           A-5351-14T3\n\f                               III.\n\n     We next consider petitioners' argument that the ALJ erred by\n\nfinding that the claims regarding the \"One Newark Plan\" in counts\n\ntwo and three of the petition were not filed within the time\n\nrequired by N.J.A.C. 6A:3-1.3(i). The rule provides that a petition\n\nof appeal to the Commissioner in a dispute arising under the school\n\nlaws must be filed \"no later than the 90th day from the date of\n\nreceipt of the notice of a final order, ruling, or other action\n\nby the district board of education[.]\" Ibid.\n\n     In her decision, the ALJ noted that counts two and three of\n\nthe petition challenged the SOSD's implementation of the \"One\n\nNewark Plan.\" The ALJ observed that the SOSD had announced on\n\nNovember 21, 2013, that it would be implementing the plan and the\n\nSOSD described the plan in detail. Moreover, on December 18, 2013,\n\nthe SOSD publicly announced specifics of the plan. In addition,\n\nin February 2014, the SOSD issued a pamphlet, which again discussed\n\ndetails of the plan that would be implemented.\n\n     The ALJ and the Commissioner determined that at a minimum,\n\npetitioners should have filed the claims in counts two and three\n\nwithin ninety days after the SOSD issued the pamphlet about the\n\nplan in February 2014. The record supports that determination.\n\n     It is well established that the ninety-day-limitation period\n\n\"provides a measure of repose\" and it is \"an essential element in\n\n                               10                           A-5351-14T3\n\fthe proper and efficient administration of the school laws.\" Kaprow\n\nv.

Therefore, the dismissal of the claims\n\nin counts two and three of the petition was proper.\n\n                                      IV.\n\n       Petitioners argue that the ALJ and Commissioner erred by\n\ndismissing the claims that the plan violated the CSPA. We disagree.\n\n       A. Closing of Schools/Leasing of Space for Charter Schools\n\n       Here,   petitioners   allege    that   the   plan   allowed     for   the\n\n\"stealth conversion\" of public schools without complying with\n\nN.J.S.A. 18A:36A-4(b). The statute provides in pertinent part that\n\na district may convert a \"currently existing public school\" to a\n\ncharter school if fifty-one percent of the school's teachers and\n\nfifty-one percent of the parents or guardians of students attending\n\nthe school sign petitions approving the change. Ibid.\n\n       Petitioners allege that under the \"One Newark Plan,\" the SOSD\n\nwas closing certain public schools and then leasing the vacant\n\n                                      11                                A-5351-14T3\n\fspace in those schools to organizations that would use the space\n\nto   operate    charter     schools.   Petitioners     maintain     that   this\n\nprovision of the plan represents an impermissible end-run around\n\nthe process in the CSPA for converting existing public schools to\n\ncharter schools.\n\n      However, as the ALJ and Commissioner recognized, a school\n\ndistrict has the discretion to close a school that the district\n\nno longer requires for the education of students. Furthermore, the\n\nSOSD also has statutory authority to lease vacant space in school\n\nbuildings to other persons or organizations. N.J.S.A. 18A:20-8.2.\n\nThe ALJ and the Commissioner correctly found that because the SOSD\n\nwas not converting a \"currently existing public school\" to a\n\ncharter school, N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-4(b) did not apply.\n\n      We will not set aside an administrative decision if it is\n\nconsistent     with   the   applicable      law,   supported   by   sufficient\n\ncredible evidence in the record, and not arbitrary, capricious,\n\nor unreasonable.

Bd. of Trs. of Police & Firemen's Ret.\n\nSys., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">369</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 380 (2014). The ALJ and the Commissioner's\n\ndetermination that the SOSD was not engaged in the conversion of\n\ncurrently existing public schools to charter schools is consistent\n\nwith the plain language of the statute and supported by sufficient\n\ncredible evidence in the record. The decision is not arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, or unreasonable.\n\n                                       12                              A-5351-14T3\n\f       B. Enrollment Plan for Charter Schools\n\n       Petitioners also claim that the \"One Newark Plan\" violated\n\nthe CSPA because it includes an enrollment process for charter\n\nschools that violates the requirements of the CSPA. In support of\n\nthis argument, petitioners cite N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-7, which states\n\nthat charter schools shall \"be open to all students on a space\n\navailable    basis.\"    They   also    cite   N.J.S.A.   18A:36A-8,     which\n\nprovides that charters must give preference to local students,\n\npriority to siblings, and enroll a cross section of the community's\n\nschool-age population, \"including racial and academic factors.\"\n\n       Petitioners argue that they alleged sufficient facts to show\n\nthat   the   plan's    enrollment     process   violates   the   enrollment\n\nmandates in the CSPA. The ALJ did not, however, address the merits\n\nof this claim. Instead, the ALJ decided that the claim could not\n\nbe considered because petitioners failed to name indispensable\n\nparties.\n\n       An indispensable party is one who has \"an interest inevitably\n\ninvolved in the subject matter before the court and a judgment\n\ncannot justly be made between litigants without either adjudging\n\nor necessarily affecting the absentee's interest.\" Allen B. Du\n\nMont Labs., Inc. v. Marcalus Mfg. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1976606\"><a href=\"/opinion/1976606/allen-b-dumont-labs-inc-v-marcalus-mfg-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">290</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 298 (1959).\n\nThe ALJ stated that, \"Under this standard, it is readily apparent\n\nthat these affected charter schools have a clear stake in this\n\n                                      13                              A-5351-14T3\n\flitigation, and that the rights that petitioners seek to vindicate,\n\nwould, in part, require an order directing that the charter schools\n\ncomply with N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-7 and N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-8.\"\n\n     The ALJ determined that without the participation of the\n\nunnamed charter schools, complete relief could not be granted. The\n\nCommissioner adopted the ALJ's findings and conclusion on this\n\nissue. We conclude that the ALJ and the Commissioner correctly\n\nfound that the unnamed charter schools whose enrollment processes\n\nwere at issue were indispensable parties to the dispute.\n\n     These organizations clearly have a stake in the resolution\n\nof   the   claims     regarding      their    enrollment       plans.     Because\n\npetitioners     had      not   joined      these   organizations         in    the\n\nadministrative action, the ALJ and the Commissioner correctly\n\nfound   that   petitioners'     claim      regarding    the    charter     school\n\nenrollment     process    in   the   \"One    Newark    Plan\"    could    not     be\n\nconsidered.\n\n     We    therefore      conclude    that    in   addition      to     correctly\n\ndismissing the claims in count three as untimely, the ALJ and the\n\nCommissioner correctly determined that the claim regarding the\n\nalleged violation of N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-4(b) failed as a matter of\n\nlaw, and the claim regarding the alleged unlawful enrollment plan\n\nfor charter schools could not be considered because petitioners\n\nfailed to name indispensable parties.\n\n                                      14                                  A-5351-14T3\n\f                                   V.\n\n     Petitioners also claim that the \"One Newark Plan\" was a\n\n\"feeble attempt to address and ameliorate\" what petitioners allege\n\nis the de facto segregation of the Newark public schools on the\n\nbasis of race, color, ancestry, and national origin. Petitioners\n\nallege that such de facto segregation violates the New Jersey\n\nConstitution.\n\n     Among the other relief requested in this action, petitioners\n\nsought a remedial plan to address the alleged unconstitutional de\n\nfacto segregation of the Newark public schools. They sought a\n\nmandate   requiring   the   inclusion   of   predominantly-white     Essex\n\nCounty suburban school districts within a county-wide or regional\n\nplan \"that would effectively desegregate\" the Newark public school\n\nsystem.\n\n     The ALJ dismissed this claim because petitioners failed to\n\nname indispensable parties, specifically, the Commissioner, the\n\nState Board, and the Essex County suburban school districts that\n\nwould be affected by such a remedial order. The Commissioner\n\nadopted the ALJ's decision on this issue.\n\n     On appeal, petitioners argue that the Commissioner, State\n\nBoard, and potentially-affected suburban school districts would\n\nnot be indispensable parties until there has been a finding of\n\nunconstitutional de facto segregation of the Newark schools. We\n\n                                  15                               A-5351-14T3\n\fcannot agree. We affirm the dismissal of this claim substantially\n\nfor the reasons stated by the ALJ in her initial decision, which\n\nwas adopted by the Commissioner.\n\n     As the ALJ noted, the petition does not merely treat the\n\nCommissioner as a decision-maker. It asserts a claim against the\n\nCommissioner, alleging that the Commissioner has not met his\n\nstatutory and constitutional obligation to desegregate the Newark\n\npublic schools. Furthermore, it is well established that only the\n\nCommissioner has the power to \"cross district lines to avoid\n\n'segregation in fact.'\" Jenkins v. Morris Twp. Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1952973\"><a href=\"/opinion/1952973/jenkins-v-tp-of-morris-school-dist-and-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 501 (1971) (quoting Booker v.

Thus, the Commissioner is an indispensable party to any\n\nclaim in which a party seeks a multi-district, remedial order\n\naddressing alleged de facto segregation of a district's schools.\n\n     We reject as entirely without merit any suggestion that the\n\nCommissioner's interest would only involve the remedy for the\n\nalleged de facto segregation of the Newark schools. Clearly, the\n\nCommissioner would have an interest in any findings of the relevant\n\nfacts, as well as determining whether a remedy is required.\n\n     Moreover,   the   potentially-affected   Essex   County   suburban\n\nschool districts also are indispensable parties to the claim of\n\nde facto segregation of the Newark schools. As we have explained,\n\npetitioners are seeking to create a regional, county-wide school\n\n                                 16                             A-5351-14T3\n\fsystem that would include the suburban school districts in Essex\n\nCounty. As the ALJ stated in her decision:\n\n           Regionalization county-wide would implicate\n           the delivery of educational services to each\n           and every public school student in Essex\n           County. A failure to join each Essex County\n           school district would plainly impede the\n           ability of these districts to protect their\n           interests. See R. 4[:]28-1(a). Moreover, any\n           order directing such desegregation would call\n           upon the neighboring districts to take the\n           steps needed to effectuate such a broad\n           ranging and monumental change in the delivery\n           of   educational   services;  to  include   a\n           potential consolidation of staff, school\n           buildings,   equipment,   and  administrative\n           services. Without the participation of these\n           districts, \"complete relief could not be\n           accorded among those already parties.\" Ibid.\n\n    We therefore conclude that the ALJ and the Commissioner\n\ncorrectly decided to dismiss the claim of de facto segregation\n\nbecause   petitioners   failed   to   name   the   Commissioner   and   the\n\naffected suburban school districts as indispensable parties. For\n\nessentially the same reasons, the State Board should also have\n\nbeen named as a party.\n\n    We note that in her decision, the ALJ found that only three\n\npetitioners had standing to raise claims that the \"One Newark\n\nPlan\" violated the right to a thorough and efficient education\n\nunder the New Jersey Constitution. These petitioners were the\n\nparents of three students who had attended public schools that\n\nwere closed under the \"One Newark Plan.\"\n\n                                  17                               A-5351-14T3\n\f     The ALJ nevertheless found that these petitioners had not\n\nalleged specific facts to show that the education of the three\n\nstudents   had    been   disrupted   or   otherwise   impaired   by     their\n\nassignments to other schools. The ALJ therefore concluded that the\n\nclaims relating to these three students were not justiciable\n\nbecause they would essentially require the Commissioner to render\n\nan advisory ruling.\n\n     In    view   of     our   decision   affirming   the   dismissal        of\n\npetitioners' claims on other grounds, we need not determine whether\n\nthe other petitioners had standing to assert claims that the \"One\n\nNewark Plan\" violates the students' rights to a thorough and\n\nefficient education, or whether the claims of the three parents\n\nfound to have standing are justiciable.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     18                               A-5351-14T3\n\f</pre>",
