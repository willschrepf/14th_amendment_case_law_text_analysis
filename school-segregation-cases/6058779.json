INTRODUCTION\n\n       This appeal arises from a dispute between Plaintiff–Appellant Thomas Wheeler\n\nand Defendants–Appellees Allstate Insurance Company and Allstate Indemnity Company\n\n(together, “Allstate”) over the scope of coverage under a homeowners insurance policy.\n\nAfter a water pipe burst and flooded Mr. Wheeler’s cabin, he filed a claim with Allstate,\n\nseeking coverage for some (but not all) of the resulting damage. When Allstate denied the\n\nclaim, Mr. Wheeler sued for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of\n\ngood faith and fair dealing.\n\n\n       *\n         This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of\nlaw of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its\npersuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.\n\f       A magistrate judge issued an order granting Allstate’s motion for summary\n\njudgment on both claims. Mr. Wheeler now appeals, arguing the magistrate judge erred\n\nby granting summary judgment in the face of a genuine dispute of material fact. We agree\n\nand therefore reverse.\n\n                                   II.   BACKGROUND\n\n                                    A. Factual History\n\n       Mr. Wheeler owns a seasonal cabin in Duck Creek, Utah. He carried homeowners\n\ninsurance on the cabin through Allstate. In April 2011, while on a walk near the cabin, an\n\nacquaintance of Mr. Wheeler stopped at the cabin for a drink of water. No one had visited\n\nthe cabin during the preceding winter months. Once inside, the acquaintance discovered\n\nthat “water was spraying out everywhere” from a pipe under a sink in the basement, and\n\nfour or five inches of standing water covered the basement floor. The damage to the cabin\n\nwas substantial. It later would be determined that the flooding began approximately two\n\nmonths earlier, as the result of a failed valve.\n\n       Soon after the problem was discovered, Mr. Wheeler had his assistant call Allstate\n\nto report it. The Allstate representative on the call informed the assistant that, based on\n\nthe information provided, Allstate likely would not cover the loss. On April 22, 2011,\n\nAllstate sent an outside adjuster to examine the cabin. According to Mr. Wheeler’s\n\ncontractor, who met the adjuster there, the adjuster inspected the cabin for “ten minutes\n\ntops” and “took like two or three pictures and left” without inspecting the source of the\n\nwater. The adjuster’s log of the inspection notes there was “extensive mold damage\n\nthroughout” the cabin, which constituted “the main loss.” It also states the adjuster\n\n                                               2\n\finformed Mr. Wheeler’s contractor that “long-term water damage and loss was not\n\ncovered,” and indicates that the adjuster “[w]ill send out [a] denial letter and close the\n\nfile.”\n\n         Mr. Wheeler’s homeowners insurance policy (the “Policy”) contained several\n\nprovisions concerning coverage for water damage. The language relevant to this case\n\nreads as follows:\n\n         Losses We Do Not Cover Under Coverage A, Coverage B and Coverage C\n\n            A. We do not cover loss to the property described in Coverage A—\n            Dwelling Protection or Coverage B—Other Structures Protection\n            consisting of or caused by the following:\n               ....\n\n               3. Seepage, meaning continuous or repeated seepage or leakage over\n               a period of weeks, months, or years, of water, steam or fuel:\n                   a) from a plumbing . . . system; or\n                   b) from, within or around any plumbing fixtures, including, but\n                      not limited to . . . sinks or other fixtures designed for the use\n                      of water or steam.\n               ....\n\n               7. a) wear and tear, aging, marring, scratching, deterioration,\n                  inherent vice, or latent defect;\n                  b) mechanical breakdown;\n                  ....\n\n                    d) rust or other corrosion;\n                    ....\n\n                    If any of a) through h) cause the sudden and accidental escape of\n                    water or steam from a plumbing . . . system within your dwelling,\n                    we cover the direct physical damage caused by the water or\n                    steam. If loss to covered property is caused by water or steam not\n                    otherwise excluded, we will cover the cost of tearing out and\n                    replacing any part of your dwelling necessary to repair the\n                    system or appliance. This does not include damage to the\n                    defective system or appliance from which the water escaped.\n\n                                                  3\n\fFor ease of understanding, we will refer to section A.3 as “Exclusion 3”; to section A.7 as\n\n“Exclusion 7”; and to the final paragraph of section A.7 as the “Exception to Exclusion\n\n7” or the “Exception.”\n\n       On April 26, 2011, Allstate sent Mr. Wheeler a letter denying his claim; the letter\n\ncited to Exclusion 3.\n\n                                 B. Procedural History\n\n       After Allstate denied his claim, Mr. Wheeler filed a lawsuit in Utah state court,\n\nalleging that Allstate breached the insurance contract and breached the implied covenant\n\nof good faith and fair dealing. Allstate removed the case to federal court on the basis of\n\ndiversity, 28 U.S.C. § 1332, and the parties later consented to the jurisdiction of the\n\nmagistrate judge (the “trial court”), id. § 636(c)(1). After conducting some discovery,\n\nAllstate moved for summary judgment on both claims, and Mr. Wheeler moved for\n\nsummary judgment on the breach of contract claim.\n\n                        1. The Parties’ Positions in the Trial Court\n\n       On the breach of contract claim, Allstate argued it properly denied coverage under\n\nExclusion 3 of the Policy, which it claimed unambiguously excludes coverage of water\n\ndamage such as that sustained in Mr. Wheeler’s cabin. Mr. Wheeler’s response to this\n\nargument was twofold. First, he argued that Exclusion 3 does not apply here at all. In\n\nparticular, he maintained that the terms “seepage” and “leakage” are ambiguous and that\n\nit is unclear whether either term embraces the water forcefully spraying from the pipe\n\nunder his basement sink. Mr. Wheeler also argued the definition of “seepage” is\n\n\n                                              4\n\fambiguous for the additional reason that it includes the term “weeks,” which, he\n\nmaintained, the parties agreed is ambiguous in the context of Exclusion 3. Thus, Mr.\n\nWheeler took the position that Exclusion 3 is a generally ambiguous provision and\n\ntherefore should be construed in favor of coverage under the default rule.1\n\n       Alternatively, however, Mr. Wheeler argued that even if Exclusion 3 is\n\nunambiguous, and the water release in his cabin generally could be considered “seepage\n\nor leakage,” the exclusion does not apply to his specific claimed loss because that loss\n\nwas sustained within the first few days of flooding. He noted that, whatever the term\n\n“weeks” might precisely mean, his and Allstate’s experts had agreed that it must at a\n\nminimum mean 14 days. And because he claimed coverage only for damage which\n\noccurred within 13 days of the water release, the loss would not be excluded because it\n\nwas not “caused by . . . seepage or leakage over a period of weeks.” According to Mr.\n\nWheeler, his expert had “demonstrated that the amount of flooding needed to cause the\n\ndamage that [Mr. Wheeler was claiming] would have happened [in] the first three days of\n\nflooding,” and “[t]he damages were not greater because the flood continued longer than 3\n\ndays.”2 By contrast, Mr. Wheeler stressed he was not seeking to recover for damages that\n\n\n\n       1\n         Mr. Wheeler’s argument that the Policy is ambiguous was also offered to support\nhis claim that Allstate breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The\nexpert Mr. Wheeler retained to evaluate Allstate’s handling of his claim opined that\nAllstate acted in bad faith by relying on ambiguous policy language to deny coverage,\nrather than fulfilling its alleged duty to search for coverage first.\n       2\n        In his report, Mr. Wheeler’s expert stated that “standing water must be removed\nin no more than 3 days [or else] irreparable damage [will be] effected due to water\ninvading expansive or absorbing materials.” He further concluded that, here, “the water\n                                             5\n\fwere caused over a longer period of time or that “would have been exacerbated by a\n\ndelay in discovering the flood.” Thus, he asserted that, “even were [Allstate’s]\n\nunderstanding of the policy to be accepted, [Allstate’s] understanding of the policy would\n\nnot cut off liability.”\n\n       Although he maintained that, ambiguous or not, Exclusion 3 does not apply to the\n\ndamages he sought to recover, Mr. Wheeler conceded those damages still would fall\n\nwithin the reach of Exclusion 7 because the failure of the valve likely was attributable to\n\none or more of the causes listed in paragraphs (a), (b), and (d) of that provision.3 But he\n\nargued the Exception to Exclusion 7 nonetheless provided coverage because the loss he\n\nwas claiming was “direct physical damage caused by” the “sudden and accidental escape\n\nof water . . . from a plumbing . . . system.” Construing the provisions together, Mr.\n\nWheeler argued the Policy’s language and the caselaw addressed by the parties “support[]\n\nthe notion that certain damages could be caused by seepage and excluded while other\n\ndamages, arising from the same flood, could be caused by [the sudden and accidental\n\nescape of water] and be covered.”\n\n       In response, Allstate acknowledged that its expert had agreed in her deposition\n\nthat there would be coverage for damage inflicted during the first 13 days. Specifically,\n\nAllstate’s expert agreed that it is “accurate to say that any damage that would have\n\n\ndamage to walls, cabinets, and other water absorbing materials was beyond repair within\nless than [a] week.”\n       3\n        These causes are “a) wear and tear, aging, marring, scratching, deterioration,\ninherent vice, or latent defect”; “b) mechanical breakdown”; and “d) rust or other\ncorrosion.”\n                                              6\n\foccurred during the first 13 days should be covered,” but only “[i]f there was a way to\n\ndetermine [what damage occurred during the first 13 days] but there is not.” Allstate\n\nargued, however, that the “reasoning for this conclusion” was that “damage which\n\noccurred during the first 13 days . . . would not have become seepage”—and thus “would\n\nnot have implicated” Exclusion 3—if the water release had been stopped within that\n\ntimeframe. Allstate also noted that the expert had concluded there should be no coverage\n\nhere; that the various cases the parties analyzed in their discussions of Exclusion 3 and\n\nthe Exception to Exclusion 7 say nothing about discerning short-term versus long-term\n\ndamage; and that requiring an insurer to identify and separate short-term damage “would\n\nbe expensive and likely fruitless.” Allstate further contended that the Exception does not\n\napply in this case because “a continuous water loss that occurs over a 70-day period” is\n\nnot “sudden and accidental.”\n\n       On the claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,\n\nAllstate argued it did not breach the covenant because it diligently investigated, fairly\n\nevaluated, and promptly and reasonably rejected Mr. Wheeler’s insurance claim.\n\nAlternatively, Allstate claimed it cannot have breached the covenant as a matter of law\n\nbecause Mr. Wheeler’s claim was “fairly debatable.” Mr. Wheeler argued in response\n\nthat fact disputes precluded summary judgment on the implied covenant claim.\n\n                               2. The Trial Court’s Decision\n\n       The trial court considered the parties’ motions together and, after conducting a\n\nhearing, issued an order granting Allstate’s motion and denying Mr. Wheeler’s. At the\n\noutset of its written analysis, the court acknowledged that Mr. Wheeler was seeking only\n\n                                              7\n\fdamages caused during the first week of flooding and was not requesting long-term\n\ndamages, such as mold.\n\n      The trial court first concluded Exclusion 3 is unambiguous, rejecting Mr.\n\nWheeler’s contrary argument and accepting as “in line with the plain meaning of the\n\n[Policy]” Allstate’s counsel’s statement that “the only time [water damage is] not\n\ncovered, the only time [Exclusion 3] comes in is when we’re dealing with a long term\n\nloss.” (Alteration omitted.) The trial court further determined that American Concept\n\nInsurance Co. v. Jones, 935 F. Supp. 1220, 1225–27 (D. Utah 1996), which found a\n\nsimilarly worded insurance-policy provision unambiguous, supported the conclusion that\n\nExclusion 3 is not ambiguous.\n\n      Next, the court turned to Mr. Wheeler’s arguments that “the Court should construe\n\nwhat happened at his cabin” as being covered under the Exception to Exclusion 7 and\n\nthat its primary task was to determine whether the release of water here was “sudden,”\n\nwithin the meaning of the phrase “sudden and accidental.” The court concluded “there is\n\nno need as [Mr. Wheeler] suggests, to interpret whether the loss was ‘sudden’” because,\n\nfor reasons the court would “explain[] in more detail below, the Court finds [Exclusion] 3\n\nexcludes coverage of [Mr. Wheeler]’s claim and therefore [Exclusion] 7 does not apply.”\n\n      In reaching its conclusion that “the [E]xception is triggered only if no other\n\nexclusion applies,” the court relied on Marsh v. American Family Mutual Insurance Co.,\n\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\f218 P.3d 573 (Or. Ct. App. 2009).4 There, the Oregon Court of Appeals held that water\n\ndamage caused by continuous leakage over a period of at least several months, and more\n\nlikely years, was specifically excluded under a provision similar to Exclusion 3, even\n\nthough the policy provided coverage for other water damage under a provision similar to\n\nthe Exception to Exclusion 7. See id. at 574–75, 577–78. According to the trial court\n\nhere, the reasoning in Marsh aligned “with Allstate’s arguments . . . that if [Mr. Wheeler]\n\nhad discovered his loss in a more timely fashion, perhaps there would have been\n\ncoverage but because [Mr. Wheeler]’s loss was over an extended period of time, the\n\nexclusionary language precludes [Mr. Wheeler]’s recovery. Therefore, like Marsh, the\n\nexceptions do not apply.”\n\n       Finally, the trial court asserted that the fact Mr. Wheeler was “only claiming loss\n\nfor the first few days of water damage” had “no effect on the Court’s decision based upon\n\nthe facts of this case.” The court then elaborated:\n\n       Because the damage to [Mr. Wheeler]’s cabin was so extensive and was not\n       found for at least 60–70 days, it is difficult if not impossible for the Court\n       to determine exactly what amount of damage would have occurred in the\n       first few hours and days. In addition, the Court believes the interpretation\n       [Mr. Wheeler] wishes the Court to make is against the authority cited above\n       both in this District and others that found coverage to be specifically\n       excluded for long-term water damage. The policy language works to\n       preclude coverage for exactly the type of damage that occurred in this\n       case—water damage that was undiscovered or unattended for an extended\n       period of time regardless of the source.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n         It also relied on Schwartzenfeld v. Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Co., No.\n296752, 2011 WL 1565466 (Mich. Ct. App. Apr. 26, 2011) (per curiam) (unpublished),\nfor the same proposition.\n                                              9\n\fThus, the trial court determined “the [Policy] is not ambiguous[,] . . . Allstate did not\n\nbreach the [Policy] by failing to cover [Mr. Wheeler]’s loss to his cabin,” and “[Mr.\n\nWheeler] is not entitled to recovery for the loss sustained to the cabin.” Nowhere in its\n\nanalysis did the court address Mr. Wheeler’s contentions that the parties’ experts agreed\n\ndamage fully inflicted during the first 13 days is not excluded under Exclusion 3 and that,\n\neven if the Policy is unambiguous, he is entitled to recover his short-term damages\n\nbecause they were caused by leakage over a period shorter than “weeks.”\n\n       Turning briefly to the implied covenant claim, the trial court again granted\n\nsummary judgment for Allstate, based largely on its conclusion that the damages Mr.\n\nWheeler sustained were excluded under Exclusion 3. The court noted that “[t]he damage\n\nto [Mr. Wheeler]’s cabin was so extensive and by all accounts occurred over an extended\n\nperiod of time.” For that reason, the court concluded it is “reasonable that Allstate’s\n\nrepresentatives . . . acted diligently, reasonably, fairly and promptly in denying [Mr.\n\nWheeler]’s claim.”\n\n                                       *      *      *\n\n       Mr. Wheeler now appeals, and we have jurisdiction to hear it under 28 U.S.C\n\n§ 636(c)(3). “We review a grant of summary judgment de novo.” Savant Homes, Inc. v.\n\nCollins, 809 F.3d 1133, 1137 (10th Cir. 2016). Summary judgment is appropriate only\n\nwhere “the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the\n\nmovant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).\n\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\f                                    III. DISCUSSION\n\n       Mr. Wheeler argues there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the\n\nshort-term damage (i.e., damage fully inflicted in 13 days or less) to his cabin can be\n\nseparated from the long-term damage (i.e., damage not fully inflicted until 14 days or\n\nmore) and that the trial court impermissibly resolved this factual dispute itself in granting\n\nsummary judgment for Allstate. From a coverage standpoint, Mr. Wheeler asserts the\n\nseverability of damages is material because, by its terms, Exclusion 3 applies only to\n\nlong-term damage, such that short-term damage is not excluded under that provision\n\nunless it cannot reliably be established as distinct from long-term damage. And because\n\nhere he seeks to recover only short-term damages which his expert says are separable,\n\nMr. Wheeler’s position is that, contrary to the trial court’s conclusion, his damages are\n\nnot excluded. Rather, Mr. Wheeler contends, as he did below, that his short-term\n\ndamages are covered under the Exception to Exclusion 7. Mr. Wheeler also argues the\n\ntrial court erred in rejecting his implied covenant claim because its ruling on that claim\n\nwas premised on its erroneous conclusion that Exclusion 3 precludes Mr. Wheeler’s\n\nrecovery.\n\n       Allstate disagrees and argues the trial court properly granted summary judgment\n\non both claims. It concedes that the question of whether short-term damage can be\n\ndistinguished from long-term damage is a disputed issue of fact but argues that it is not\n\nmaterial and that the trial court’s finding on that issue is therefore harmless. Thus, the\n\ncentral issue on appeal is whether the severability of short- and long-term damages is\n\nmaterial and, accordingly, should have precluded summary judgment. A fact is material if\n\n                                             11\n\fit “might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.” Anderson v. Liberty\n\nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986); accord Jones v. Norton, 809 F.3d 564, 573 (10th\n\nCir. 2015).\n\n         As we explain in detail below, we agree with Mr. Wheeler that the question of\n\nwhether he can reliably prove his alleged short-term damages, as distinct from any long-\n\nterm damages, is an issue of fact that might affect the outcome of this case. It is,\n\ntherefore, material. We further agree that this factual dispute is material not just to Mr.\n\nWheeler’s breach of contract claim, but also to his breach of the implied covenant of\n\ngood faith claim. It follows, then, that the trial court erred in disposing of these claims on\n\nsummary judgment. In explaining our reasoning, we address each of Mr. Wheeler’s\n\nclaims separately, beginning with breach of contract.\n\n                                  A. Breach of Contract\n\n         To decide whether the factual dispute over the divisibility of water damages is\n\nmaterial to Mr. Wheeler’s breach of contract claim, we must determine whether the\n\nresolution of that dispute could affect the scope of coverage under the Policy. If the\n\nalleged short-term damage is not covered under the Policy, then Allstate could not have\n\nbreached the Policy by denying coverage, regardless of whether the short-term damage\n\ncan be established independently. This issue therefore turns on the proper construction of\n\nthe parties’ insurance contract, which is a question of law. MarketWest Hydrocarbon, Inc.\n\nv. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 558 F.3d 1184, 1190 (10th Cir. 2009). In this diversity case, we\n\napply the substantive law of Utah. See Barrett v. Tallon, 30 F.3d 1296, 1300 (10th Cir.\n\n1994).\n\n                                              12\n\f                                  1. Relevant Utah Law\n\n       “Under Utah law, insurance policies are construed using general contract\n\nprinciples.” Utah Power & Light Co. v. Fed. Ins. Co., 983 F.2d 1549, 1553 (10th Cir.\n\n1993). In interpreting insurance contracts, Utah courts “consider[] their meaning to a\n\nperson of ordinary intelligence and understanding, . . . in accordance with the usual and\n\nnatural meaning of the words, and in the light of existing circumstances, including the\n\npurpose of the policy.” Lopez v. United Auto. Ins. Co., 274 P.3d 897, 902 (Utah 2012)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). “Policy terms are harmonized with the policy as a\n\nwhole, and all provisions should be given effect if possible.” Utah Farm Bureau Ins. Co.\n\nv. Crook, 980 P.2d 685, 686 (Utah 1999).\n\n       “Utah courts have long held that ‘insurance policies should be construed liberally\n\nin favor of the insured . . . so as to promote and not defeat the purposes of insurance.’”\n\nFire Ins. Exch. v. Oltmanns, 285 P.3d 802, 805 (Utah Ct. App. 2012) (quoting U.S. Fid.\n\n& Guar. Co. v. Sandt, 854 P.2d 519, 521 (Utah 1993)). As a result, “ambiguous or\n\nuncertain language in an insurance contract . . . should be construed in favor of\n\ncoverage.” Sandt, 854 P.2d at 522. Courts must, however, “enforce an unambiguous\n\ncontract and may not rewrite an insurance contract if the language is clear.” Crook, 980\n\nP.2d at 687 (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted). An insurer therefore may\n\ninclude provisions barring coverage for certain losses; but even so, “provisions that limit\n\nor exclude coverage should be strictly construed against the insurer.” Oltmanns, 285 P.3d\n\nat 805 (quoting Sandt, 854 P.2d at 523). “In strictly construing exclusions, [Utah courts]\n\ngive them effect only when they use ‘language which clearly and unmistakably\n\n                                             13\n\fcommunicates to the insured the specific circumstances under which the expected\n\ncoverage will not be provided.’” Id. (quoting Crook, 980 P.2d at 686).\n\n                                      2. Application\n\n       To begin, we acknowledge that neither the Policy nor the parties’ briefing in the\n\ntrial court or on appeal is a model of clarity. This imprecision is responsible for the\n\ndivergent views of the majority, the dissent, and the trial court concerning the issues and\n\narguments advanced, as well as the meaning of the Policy itself. Although each opinion\n\nevidences a thoughtful look at the language of the Policy and the parties’ arguments, little\n\nagreement has been reached. With that backdrop, we begin by outlining the few points of\n\nconsensus.\n\n       The parties agree on the general analytical framework applicable to the question of\n\nwhether Mr. Wheeler’s claimed loss is covered under the Policy. They assume that, even\n\nif the loss does not also fall under Exclusion 3, it was caused by “wear and tear,”\n\n“mechanical breakdown,” or “rust or other corrosion,” such that it falls under\n\nExclusion 7, unless the Exception to Exclusion 7 applies. Thus, both parties organize\n\ntheir arguments around the premise that, for Mr. Wheeler’s loss to be covered under the\n\nPolicy, it must both (1) fall outside the scope of Exclusion 3 and (2) fall inside the scope\n\nof the Exception to Exclusion 7. The trial court agreed with this general framework,\n\nreasoning that it must decide, first, whether Exclusion 3 is ambiguous, and then, if it is\n\nnot, whether Mr. Wheeler’s loss falls under Exclusion 3 or, instead, the Exception to\n\nExclusion 7.\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\f       Accordingly, we will analyze Mr. Wheeler’s claim under each of these provisions\n\nin turn, discussing the trial court’s reasoning and the parties’ arguments as we go.\n\n                                       a. Exclusion 3\n\n       Under Exclusion 3 of the Policy, Allstate disclaimed responsibility for damage\n\n“consisting of or caused by . . . [s]eepage, meaning continuous or repeated seepage or\n\nleakage over a period of weeks, months, or years, of water . . . from, within or around any\n\nplumbing fixtures, including . . . sinks.”\n\n       Despite Allstate’s assertion to the contrary, Mr. Wheeler does not challenge on\n\nappeal the trial court’s conclusion that this provision is unambiguous. Rather, Mr.\n\nWheeler’s appellate position is consistent with his alternative position below that, even if\n\nExclusion 3 is deemed unambiguous, the short-term damages he is claiming do not fall\n\nwithin its reach and instead fall within the Exception to Exclusion 7. In other words, Mr.\n\nWheeler accepts the trial court’s construction of the Policy—that Exclusion 3 eliminates\n\ncoverage for damage caused by the continuous leakage of water over a period of weeks\n\nor longer, and that damage which is excluded under Exclusion 3 cannot be recovered\n\nunder the Exception to Exclusion 7. But he takes the position that this interpretation\n\nsimply does not speak to the short-term damages he seeks to recover, which are by policy\n\ndefinition not caused by seepage. Mr. Wheeler further concedes that if, as the trial court\n\nfound, it is not possible to reliably distinguish short-term damage from long-term damage\n\nto which Exclusion 3 does apply, then his short-term damages cannot be recovered. He\n\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\fclaims, however, that the trial court impermissibly made a factual finding on the\n\nseverability issue despite his expert’s testimony that severance is possible.5\n\n       Given that no party argues otherwise, we will assume for purposes of this appeal\n\nthat the language of Exclusion 3 is unambiguous. Cf. Am. Concept Ins. Co. v. Jones, 935\n\nF. Supp. 1220, 1225–26 (D. Utah 1996) (finding materially identical provision\n\nunambiguous under Utah law). What we cannot accept, however, is Allstate’s\n\nassumption, clearly implicated in its arguments here and in the trial court, that if\n\nExclusion 3 of the Policy is deemed unambiguous, Mr. Wheeler cannot recover. These\n\n\n       5\n          In the dissent’s view, the trial court determined, as an independent conclusion of\nlaw, that if a water release causes any damage that falls under the plain language of\nExclusion 3, then Exclusion 3 bars recovery of all damage associated with that water\nrelease, regardless of whether the damage was fully inflicted within a matter of days. And\nbecause Mr. Wheeler does not explicitly articulate, and then refute, that supposed\nconclusion, the dissent believes we must accept it as unchallenged and, here, dispositive.\n        But we do not see this conclusion expressed, let alone explained, anywhere in the\ntrial court’s order. To be sure, this view of the Policy would have led the trial court to the\nresult it reached, and it certainly is feasible that this conclusion, though unexpressed,\ncould have informed the reasoning the court did express. However, we think the better\nreading of the trial court’s order—one which, at the very least, we cannot penalize Mr.\nWheeler for gleaning—is that the court’s finding that the short- and long-term damages\ncould not reliably be distinguished was central to its conclusion that Mr. Wheeler’s\ndamages are barred by Exclusion 3. Indeed, every time the trial court discussed\nExclusion 3’s application it referred to “long term loss,” “loss . . . over an extended\nperiod of time,” or “long-term water damage.” Given the parties’ focus in their summary\njudgment briefing on pre- and post-“weeks” damages, and Mr. Wheeler’s argument that\nunder the plain language of the Policy his short-term damages are covered, we consider\nthe trial court’s finding as to severability essential to its conclusion that Mr. Wheeler\nsuffered only long-term damages that fall under Exclusion 3.\n        And in any event, Mr. Wheeler clearly asserts here, as he did below, that his short-\nterm damages are not barred by Exclusion 3. Thus, Mr. Wheeler advocates an\ninterpretation of a contract that runs counter to the trial court’s interpretation of the same\ncontract, squarely presenting to us a legal issue that we review de novo. Under these\ncircumstances, we disagree with the dissent’s conclusion that Mr. Wheeler has waived\nany argument critical to his ability to succeed on appeal.\n                                             16\n\fare not equivalent, interchangeable conclusions—to say that Exclusion 3 is unambiguous\n\nis not to say, automatically, that it embraces the damages Mr. Wheeler is claiming. To the\n\ncontrary, we agree with Mr. Wheeler, for the reasons set forth below, that Exclusion 3\n\ndoes not apply to his short-term damages; and even if the exclusion could be interpreted\n\notherwise, we would be bound under Utah law to construe it in Mr. Wheeler’s favor. See\n\nOltmanns, 285 P.3d at 805; cf. Fla. Dep’t of Revenue v. Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., 554\n\nU.S. 33, 41 (2008) (noting that state’s reading of a statute was “more natural” but\n\ndeclining to decide whether the statute was ambiguous because, even if it was, the\n\nambiguity must be resolved in the state’s favor).\n\n       In interpreting Exclusion 3, we construe its language from the perspective of an\n\nordinary insurance purchaser, see Sandt, 854 P.2d at 523, mindful that exclusionary\n\nprovisions except only what they clearly and unmistakably embrace, see Oltmanns, 285\n\nP.3d at 805. Exclusion 3 provides in relevant part that Allstate does not cover household\n\ndamage “caused by . . . [s]eepage, meaning continuous or repeated seepage or leakage\n\nover a period of weeks, months, or years.” This language “clearly and unmistakably\n\ncommunicates to the insured,” Crook, 980 P.2d at 686, that damage “caused by” weeks or\n\nmonths of continuous leakage is excluded, and no party disagrees. But by extension, then,\n\nit is equally plain that damage not “caused by” weeks or months of leakage—or, to\n\nphrase it differently, damage “caused by” less than weeks of leakage—is not excluded.\n\nAnd because the parties concur that “weeks,” plural, must at the very least mean two\n\nweeks, we agree with Mr. Wheeler that, by its terms, Exclusion 3 does not clearly and\n\nunmistakably apply to damage caused by less than 14 days of leakage.\n\n                                            17\n\f       Allstate’s expert insurance adjuster agreed with this interpretation. As the trial\n\ncourt stated, “in her deposition [Allstate’s expert] agreed with [Mr. Wheeler]’s counsel’s\n\nquestion that any damage that would have occurred during the first 13 days would be\n\ncovered under [Mr. Wheeler]’s policy.”\n\n       Nonetheless, Allstate maintains on appeal that Mr. Wheeler’s claimed damages are\n\nbarred under Exclusion 3. First, Allstate asserts Mr. Wheeler cannot recover the damages\n\nhe alleges were beyond repair within 13 days because Exclusion 3 “does not state that\n\ncoverage is afforded for damages that occur in the first thirteen days.” But this contention\n\nturns Utah’s rule of interpretation on its head. Under Utah law, exclusionary provisions\n\nmust explicitly define the circumstances under which coverage will be denied and are\n\n“strictly construed against the insurer.” See Oltmanns, 285 P.3d at 805 (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). Thus, mere silence in an exclusion does not bar coverage.\n\n       And Allstate’s main line of reasoning misses the central point of Mr. Wheeler’s\n\nposition. As noted above, after wrongly asserting that Mr. Wheeler is claiming\n\nExclusion 3 is ambiguous, Allstate argues Exclusion 3 is unambiguous and assumes that\n\nto reach that conclusion is to further conclude Exclusion 3 applies to all of Mr. Wheeler’s\n\ndamages. From this vantage point, Allstate contends the factual question of whether\n\nshort-term damages can be isolated and separately established, while disputed, is\n\nimmaterial. Allstate contrasts this “immaterial” factual dispute with what it describes as\n\n“the undisputed material facts” which, in Allstate’s view, properly informed the trial\n\ncourt’s conclusion that Exclusion 3 precludes coverage here. In sum, Allstate expresses\n\nits view of the exclusion’s application in this case as follows:\n\n                                             18\n\f       Exclusion [3] makes clear that the [P]olicy does not cover loss to property\n       caused by the seepage or leakage of water from a plumbing system\n       occurring over a period of weeks or months. The loss to Mr. Wheeler’s\n       cabin resulted from the leakage of water from a plumbing system . . . that\n       occurred over a period of weeks or months. Mr. Wheeler cannot, and has\n       not, disputed these material facts, or cited to a case anywhere in the country\n       to support his contention [that Exclusion 3 is ambiguous].\n\nBut while there is nothing particularly objectionable about the first of these sentences—in\n\nthat it fairly encapsulates the meaning of Exclusion 3 in general terms—the latter\n\nsentences misapprehend Mr. Wheeler’s stance as to the central dispute in this case.\n\n       Mr. Wheeler’s position is that the loss he seeks to recover, as opposed to other loss\n\nhe admits he must absorb, did not “result from” weeks or months of leakage. Allstate\n\nappears to contend that the water release here could not have caused discrete losses to\n\ndifferent components of Mr. Wheeler’s cabin, and must be treated as one cohesive loss.\n\nThat is, Allstate seemingly asserts the Policy terminates coverage when a long-term water\n\nrelease occurs, even absent a causal link between the duration of the release and the\n\ndamages claimed. But the Policy does not support this position.\n\n       By its terms, the Policy eliminates coverage for damage, so long as that damage is\n\n“caused by” any of the events listed in several enumerated exclusionary provisions, of\n\nwhich Exclusions 3 and 7 are examples. Accordingly, Exclusion 3 operates to exclude\n\nfrom coverage any damage that is caused by seepage, which, as discussed, means\n\ncontinuous leakage over a period of 14 days or longer. Here, however, Mr. Wheeler\n\nasserts the damage he seeks to recover was “complete within the first week of the\n\nflooding.” Thus, assuming this assertion is correct as a factual matter, Mr. Wheeler’s\n\nclaimed damage was not caused by leakage over a period of 14 days or longer; it was\n\n                                            19\n\fcaused by leakage over a period of less than 14 days and thus was not caused by seepage.\n\nAs such, the damage does not clearly and unmistakably fall within Exclusion 3.\n\n       Accordingly, we depart from the reasoning of the trial court. As summarized at the\n\noutset, the trial court determined that Exclusion 3 “excludes coverage of [Mr. Wheeler]’s\n\nclaim and therefore [the Exception to Exclusion 7] does not apply.” But it reached this\n\ndetermination by concluding, in step with Allstate’s approach, that Exclusion 3 is\n\nunambiguous, without explaining how it unambiguously excludes short-term damage.\n\nYet, the trial court agreed with Allstate’s counsel that the “only time [water damage is]\n\nnot covered, the only time [Exclusion 3] comes in is when we’re dealing with a long term\n\nloss.” And the premise of Mr. Wheeler’s argument is that he is not, in fact, seeking\n\nrecovery for “long term loss.” Thus, the short-term loss sought by Mr. Wheeler, if\n\ncapable of being severed from the long-term loss, actually falls outside the trial court’s\n\ninterpretation of Exclusion 3.\n\n       Nor are we persuaded by the trial court’s reliance on decisions holding that, when\n\na provision like Exclusion 3 applies, it supersedes a provision like the Exception, and\n\ncoverage is excluded. See Schwartzenfeld v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., No. 296752,\n\n2011 WL 1565466 (Mich. Ct. App. Apr. 26, 2011) (per curiam) (unpublished); Marsh v.\n\nAm. Family Mut. Ins. Co., 218 P.3d 573 (Or. Ct. App. 2009).6 According to the trial\n\ncourt, these cases’ “reasoning is in line with Allstate’s arguments . . . that if [Mr.\n\nWheeler] had discovered his loss in a more timely fashion, perhaps there would have\n\n       6\n         In their filings below and their briefs on appeal, the parties discuss a third case\nthat stands for the same proposition. See Hall v. Am. Indem. Grp., 648 So.2d 556 (Ala.\n1994).\n                                              20\n\fbeen coverage but because [Mr. Wheeler]’s loss was over an extended period of time, the\n\nexclusionary language precludes [Mr. Wheeler]’s recovery.” “Therefore,” the court\n\nstated, “the exception[] do[es] not apply.”\n\n       But this approach assumes the answer to the disputed issue here—namely, that\n\nExclusion 3 applies to Mr. Wheeler’s claimed loss. In order for the court to conclude that\n\nMr. Wheeler’s “loss was over an extended period of time” and thus barred under\n\nExclusion 3, it needed to reject Mr. Wheeler’s argument that he could meaningfully\n\ndistinguish between short-term and long-term water damage in a situation involving at\n\nleast some long-term damage. And the trial court did exactly that, stating\n\n       the Court finds [Mr. Wheeler]’s argument that they are [sic] only claiming\n       loss for the first few days of water damage to have no effect on the Court’s\n       decision based upon the facts of this case. Because the damage to [Mr.\n       Wheeler]’s cabin was so extensive and was not found for at least 60–70\n       days, it is difficult if not impossible for the Court to determine exactly what\n       amount of damage would have occurred in the first few hours and days.\n\n(Emphases added.) As even Allstate concedes, however, the separability of short- and\n\nlong-term water damage is a disputed factual question in this case: Allstate’s insurance\n\nexpert opined that there was no way to determine these damages separately, but Mr.\n\nWheeler’s mechanical and plumbing expert reported that he could, in fact, make that\n\ndetermination. Thus, this factual dispute was not “for the Court to determine” on\n\nsummary judgment.\n\n       The trial court’s reliance on authorities “that found coverage to be specifically\n\nexcluded for long-term water damage” under similar insurance provisions does not\n\nconvince us otherwise. Again, this statement assumes that Mr. Wheeler suffered only\n\n\n                                              21\n\f“long-term water damage,” which all parties agree is unambiguously precluded by\n\nExclusion 3. More importantly, however, all of the cases cited in the trial court’s order\n\n(and the parties’ briefs) involve claims for damage that was undisputedly caused by\n\nleakage over a period of weeks, months, or years. See Am. Concept, 935 F. Supp. at 1223,\n\n1226 (cracking and settling of walls and foundation caused by sustained saturation of soil\n\nbeneath home due to leak at connection in pipe that persisted for two years); Hall v. Am.\n\nIndem. Grp., 648 So.2d 556, 558–59 (Ala. 1994) (structural damage to foundation and\n\nbasement walls caused by leak that continued for years and by water pressure from burst\n\npipe, involving policy with seepage exclusion and separate exclusion for damage to\n\nfoundation from water pressure); Schwartzenfeld, 2011 WL 1565466, at *1 (water\n\ndamage to downstairs ceilings caused by years of leakage through crevice around bath\n\ntub that rotted subfloors of bathroom before showing through on ceilings); Marsh, 218\n\nP.3d at 574–75, 577 (rotted floor under shower caused by leak in shower membrane that\n\npersisted for at least months, and likely years). None involved a claim for damage caused\n\nduring the first week of leakage or an argument that such damage can be severed from the\n\nlong-term damages and therefore falls outside a provision like Exclusion 3. See Am.\n\nConcept, 935 F. Supp. at 1225–26; Hall, 648 So.2d at 558–59; Schwartzenfeld, 2011 WL\n\n1565466, at *1–3; Marsh, 218 P.3d at 574–75, 577–78. Thus, none of them supports the\n\nnotion that short-term water damage cannot be isolated and reliably proved, and none\n\nsuggests Exclusion 3 applies to the short-term loss Mr. Wheeler seeks to recover in this\n\ncase.\n\n\n\n                                            22\n\f       It is also true, as discussed, that Exclusion 3 is silent on the issue, meaning it does\n\nnot clearly and unmistakably exclude damages caused by leakage or seepage for less than\n\nweeks, month, or years. Accordingly, if Mr. Wheeler can segregate his short-term losses\n\nfrom his long-term losses, the short-term losses are not barred by the unambiguous\n\nlanguage of Exclusion 3.\n\n       It follows from this discussion that Mr. Wheeler’s asserted factual dispute affects\n\nwhether Exclusion 3 applies. We must next determine, then, whether Mr. Wheeler’s\n\nshort-term damage, if he can separately establish it, would be covered under the\n\nException to Exclusion 7.\n\n                                b. Exception to Exclusion 7\n\n       The trial court concluded Mr. Wheeler’s damages were excluded under\n\nExclusion 3 and therefore did not construe the Exception to Exclusion 7 or analyze its\n\napplication to the present facts. Nonetheless, the parties address this issue in their briefs,\n\nand we consider it to determine if we can affirm on this alternative ground.7\n\n\n       7\n          Mr. Wheeler assumed in his opening brief that the escape of water from the pipe\nin his basement was undisputedly “sudden and accidental” within the meaning of the\nException to Exclusion 7. It was only after Allstate argued to the contrary in its answer\nbrief that Mr. Wheeler, in his reply brief, provided substantive analysis on this point and\nargued that whether the water’s release was “sudden and accidental” is a disputed issue of\nfact. Although we usually choose not to consider arguments raised for the first time in a\nreply brief, Stump v. Gates, 211 F.3d 527, 533 (10th Cir. 2000), we conclude the reasons\nfor applying this discretionary rule of abstention are not present here.\n        For one, the trial court expressly declined to decide whether the escape of water in\nthis case was sudden and accidental, so there was no determination contrary to Mr.\nWheeler’s position to which a response clearly was required. But more importantly, this\nis not a situation in which the appellee has been deprived of an opportunity to respond to\na new argument or characterization of the record, or in which we need “protect[ion] . . .\nfrom publishing an erroneous opinion” with respect to the law or the facts. Id.; see also\n                                              23\n\f       There is no dispute that the damage at issue here falls within Exclusion 7 and\n\ntherefore must also be within the scope of the exception to that exclusion to be covered\n\nunder the Policy. The Exception states:\n\n       If any of a) through h) cause the sudden and accidental escape of water or\n       steam from a plumbing . . . system within your dwelling, we cover the\n       direct physical damage caused by the water or steam. If loss to covered\n       property is caused by water or steam not otherwise excluded, we will cover\n       the cost of tearing out and replacing any part of your dwelling necessary to\n       repair the system or appliance. This does not include damage to the\n       defective system or appliance from which the water escaped.\n\n(Emphases added.)\n\n       Interpreting this language, Allstate says the Exception “provides coverage for\n\nwater loss if such loss was ‘sudden and accidental,’” and argues the fact that “Mr.\n\nWheeler does not dispute that it took him [60–70] days to discover the water loss . . .\n\ncompels the conclusion that the loss was not ‘sudden and accidental.’” Allstate then\n\nreferences three cases in which this court interpreted the phrase “sudden and accidental,”\n\narguing they establish that the phrase is unambiguous and does not embrace Mr.\n\nWheeler’s loss here. See Quaker State Minit-Lube, Inc. v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co., 52\n\nF.3d 1522 (10th Cir. 1995); Anaconda Minerals Co. v. Stoller Chem. Co., 990 F.2d 1175\n\n\n\n\nid. (stating the reasons for the usual rule are to avoid “rob[bing] the appellee of the\nopportunity to demonstrate that the record does not support an appellant’s factual\nassertions and to present an analysis of the pertinent legal precedent that may compel a\ncontrary result”; and to “protect[] this court from publishing an erroneous opinion\nbecause we did not have the benefit of the appellee’s response”). The parties’ appellate\narguments on this issue are the same as the ones they made before the trial court, and Mr.\nWheeler’s reply brief discusses only the cases addressed in Allstate’s answer brief, all of\nwhich also were discussed below.\n                                            24\n\f(10th Cir. 1993); Hartford Accident & Indem. Co. v. U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co., 962 F.2d\n\n1484 (10th Cir. 1992).\n\n        Allstate is correct that, under controlling caselaw, the phrase “sudden and\n\naccidental” is unambiguous. Contrary to Allstate’s reading, however, that precedent does\n\nnot support Allstate’s position that the Exception to Exclusion 7 is inapplicable here.\n\nIndeed, one case in particular is substantially on point and firmly establishes that Mr.\n\nWheeler’s claimed loss, if provable, is covered under the Exception.\n\n        In Gridley Associates, Ltd. v. Transamerica Insurance Co., the plaintiff owned a\n\ngas station which, from November 1985 to February 1986, recorded a shortfall of\n\napproximately 12,000 gallons between the volume of gasoline actually sold and the\n\nvolume purchased and stored in the station’s underground tank. 828 P.2d 524, 524–25\n\n(Utah Ct. App. 1992). Concerned, the plaintiff hired a company in early February 1986 to\n\ninspect the station’s fuel system, and it concluded “there was a gasoline leak resulting\n\nfrom a broken pipe which connected the gasoline storage tank with the gasoline\n\n[pumps].” Id. at 525. The evidence established that “the break in the pipe was a ‘clean\n\nbreak’ that ‘would have had to have been caused by an adjustment of the area in which it\n\nis in.’” Id.\n\n        The plaintiff filed a claim with its general liability insurer for the cost of\n\nenvironmental cleanup. Id. The policy contained a pollution exclusion which disclaimed\n\ncoverage for “property damage arising out of the discharge, dispersal, release or escape\n\nof [various pollutants] into or upon land.” Id. But the exclusion contained the following\n\nexception: “this exclusion does not apply if such discharge, dispersal, release or escape is\n\n                                               25\n\fsudden and accidental.” Id. The insurer denied coverage under the exclusion, and the\n\nplaintiff sued. Id. The trial court found the insurer liable under the exception to the\n\nexclusion, and the insurer appealed. See id. at 525–26.\n\n          The sole issue on appeal was whether the gasoline leak was “sudden,” within the\n\nmeaning of the phrase “sudden and accidental.” Id. at 526. Like Allstate does here, the\n\ninsurer in Gridley maintained that the leak “was not ‘sudden’ because it continued for an\n\nextended period of time.” Id. Casting the issue as one of first impression in Utah, the\n\nUtah Court of Appeals determined that the word “sudden,” as used in the phrase “sudden\n\nand accidental,” has an unambiguous meaning. Id. at 527. Reading the terms together, the\n\ncourt concluded that for a “discharge, dispersal, release or escape” to have been “sudden\n\nand accidental,” it must have been both quick or abrupt and unexpected or unintentional.\n\nSee id.\n\n          Applying this understanding to the facts of that case, the Gridley court concluded\n\nthat the gasoline leak was “sudden and accidental” and therefore fell within the exception\n\nto the policy’s pollution exclusion. Id. The court noted that the evidence suggested the\n\nbreak in the pipe was a “clean break,” which would have “resulted in an unexpected as\n\nwell as an immediate and abrupt flow of gasoline from the severed line,” as opposed to a\n\nbreak slowly caused by corrosion “which would have resulted in a gradual drip or trickle\n\nof gasoline from the line.” Id. Critical for our purposes here, the court had this to say of\n\nthe fact that the leak persisted for a long period of time:\n\n          [The insurer]’s argument that the discharge could not possibly have been\n          “sudden” because the spill lasted for an extended period of time is without\n          merit. While the record . . . indicates that although the break in the line\n\n                                               26\n\f       occurred in approximately November 1985 and was not discovered by [the\n       plaintiff] until early February 1986, the explicit language of [the plaintiff]’s\n       policy only requires that the discharge itself be “sudden” in order to be\n       covered under the policy. The length of time that elapses before the leak is\n       discovered is irrelevant, as to the suddenness of the discharge. . . .\n       Accordingly, in the case at bar, where there was damage to a line which\n       caused an immediate spill of gasoline into the ground that remained\n       undiscovered by [the plaintiff] for some months, the discharge itself was\n       still “sudden” as contemplated by the exception to the pollution exclusion.\n\nId. at 527–28 (emphases added) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       One need only replace “gasoline” with “water” to know what Utah law prescribes\n\nin the present case. Like the exception in Gridley, the “explicit language” of which\n\nrequired that the “escape” itself be sudden and accidental, the Exception to Exclusion 7\n\nplainly focuses on the escape itself: it states that damage caused by “the sudden and\n\naccidental escape of water or steam from a plumbing . . . system” is exempt from\n\nExclusion 7. (Emphasis added.) Allstate’s argument that the loss caused by the escaped\n\nwater was not sudden and accidental is thus beside the point. Moreover, the undisputed\n\nevidence shows that the escape of water into Mr. Wheeler’s cabin began when a pipe\n\nunder the basement sink burst due to a failed valve and that the release of water was\n\n“immediate and abrupt,” rather than “a gradual drip or trickle”: when the leak was found,\n\n“water was spraying out everywhere” and the spray shot out “about 2–3 feet.” Gridley\n\nplainly instructs that, under these circumstances, the “escape of water” was “sudden and\n\naccidental” within the meaning of the Exception, regardless of whether the leak went\n\nundiscovered for 60–70 days.\n\n       The Quaker State / Anaconda / Hartford line of cases, in which this court applied\n\nUtah law to pollution provisions similar to the one in Gridley, does not suggest otherwise.\n\n                                             27\n\fIn the first of those cases, Hartford, this court noted that the Utah Supreme Court had not\n\nyet interpreted the phrase “sudden and accidental” in the context of an insurance\n\nexclusion, and that it was therefore this court’s responsibility to “give the clause the\n\ninterpretation we believe the Utah [Supreme] [C]ourt would.” 962 F.2d at 1487.\n\nUltimately, we settled on the interpretation provided by the Utah Court of Appeals in\n\nGridley. Id. at 1490. The Anaconda and Quaker State decisions subsequently employed\n\nthat interpretation, too. Quaker State, 52 F.3d at 1528; Anaconda, 990 F.2d at 1177–79.\n\n       In all three cases, this court applied the interpretation “that ‘sudden and accidental’\n\nunambiguously means ‘abrupt or quick and unexpected or unintended,’” e.g., Quaker\n\nState, 52 F.3d at 1258, to largely analogous fact patterns: plaintiffs claiming that\n\nnumerous discharges of pollution over a decade or more should be covered under\n\nexceptions to pollution exclusions in their insurance policies. E.g., id. at 1524–27. And in\n\neach case, this court determined that such discharges were not covered because, “under\n\nUtah law continuous, routine, or gradual discharges of pollutants are not ‘abrupt’ or\n\n‘quick’ and thereby not ‘sudden’ within the meaning of ‘sudden and accidental.’” Id. at\n\n1528 (citing Anaconda, 990 F.2d at 1179; Hartford, 962 F.2d at 1489, 1492).\n\n       Although the focus on “continuous” and “gradual” might otherwise have implied\n\nthat a single, lasting leak could not be “sudden and accidental,” in each case the court’s\n\nholding was premised on, and limited to, long-term, repeated discharges attendant to the\n\nroutine business operations of the plaintiffs. E.g., id. at 1528–30; Hartford, 962 F.2d at\n\n1489, 1492. Indeed, this court recently characterized Quaker State, Anaconda, and\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\fHartford as cases that hinged on “the routine commercial activities of the insured.”\n\nHeadwaters Res., Inc. v. Ill. Union Ins. Co., 770 F.3d 885, 896 (10th Cir. 2014).\n\n       And even if these cases could be read broadly to suggest leaks like the ones here\n\nand in Gridley cannot be considered “sudden and accidental” as a categorical matter, the\n\nUtah Supreme Court has subsequently foreclosed that reading. See Sharon Steel Corp. v.\n\nAetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 931 P.2d 127 (Utah 1997). In Sharon Steel, the Utah Supreme\n\nCourt expressly approved of and reaffirmed Gridley. Id. at 135. It also approved of the\n\nQuaker State line of cases, but only after characterizing the reasoning of those cases as\n\n“focused on whether the pollution was a ‘concomitant’ of regular business activity rather\n\nthan a series of unrelated accidents.” Id. at 136. Thus here, we need not parse our\n\nprecedent “to determine, as best we can, how this issue would be resolved by the Utah\n\nSupreme Court.” Quaker State, 52 F.3d at 1527. The Utah Supreme Court has spoken,\n\nand Gridley controls: because the escape here was sudden and accidental, it triggers the\n\nException to Exclusion 7, even though it remained undetected for an extended period.\n\n                                      *      *      *\n\n       We therefore conclude that, if Mr. Wheeler can prove the damages he is seeking\n\nwere caused within the first 13 days of the release, then the damages fall outside\n\nExclusion 3 and inside the Exception to Exclusion 7. In that situation, the damages would\n\nbe covered under the Policy and Allstate would have breached the Policy by denying\n\ncoverage. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Mr. Wheeler, a reasonable\n\njury could find that the short- and long-term damages are, in fact, separable. Accordingly,\n\n\n\n                                            29\n\fwe conclude there is a genuine dispute of material fact that should have precluded the\n\ntrial court’s grant of summary judgment on the breach of contract claim.\n\n           B. Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing\n\n       Having determined summary judgment was not appropriate on the breach of\n\ncontract claim, we must next consider whether summary judgment was appropriate as to\n\nthe claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The parties’\n\narguments here focus on whether Allstate in fact complied with its duty of good faith and,\n\nalternatively, whether Mr. Wheeler’s insurance claim was “fairly debatable,” such that\n\nAllstate could not have acted in bad faith in denying coverage.8 After stating the relevant\n\nlaw, we address each of these questions in turn, concluding that summary judgment was\n\nnot warranted on this claim.\n\n       Under Utah law, the implied covenant of good faith in the insurance context\n\n“contemplates, at the very least, that the insurer will diligently investigate the facts to\n\nenable it to determine whether a claim is valid, will fairly evaluate the claim, and will\n\nthereafter act promptly and reasonably in rejecting or settling the claim.” Prince v. Bear\n\nRiver Mut. Ins. Co., 56 P.3d 524, 533 (Utah 2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThese duties account for the fact that “the overriding requirement imposed by the implied\n\ncovenant is that insurers act reasonably, as an objective matter, in dealing with their\n\ninsureds.” Billings v. Union Bankers Ins. Co., 918 P.2d 461, 465 (Utah 1996). Thus, “[i]f\n\n       8\n         Allstate also asserts that the claim should fail because Mr. Wheeler’s complaint\n“only made one general allegation” in support of it. But as Mr. Wheeler notes, this case is\nat the summary judgment stage, where the parties must move beyond the pleadings. The\nrecord shows Mr. Wheeler moved well beyond “one general allegation” at the summary\njudgment stage.\n                                              30\n\fan insurer acts reasonably in denying a claim, then the insurer did not contravene the\n\ncovenant.” Prince, 56 P.3d at 533. In Utah, “[w]hether there has been a breach of good\n\nfaith and fair dealing is a factual issue, generally inappropriate for decision as a matter of\n\nlaw.” Blakely v. USAA Cas. Ins. Co., 500 F. App’x 734, 739 (10th Cir. 2012)\n\n(unpublished) (alteration in original) (quoting Oman v. Davis Sch. Dist., 194 P.3d 956,\n\n968 (Utah 2008)).\n\n       Applied here, these considerations lead us to conclude that the issue of Allstate’s\n\ncompliance with its duty of good faith is a question of fact best left for the jury. Although\n\nthe trial court’s statement that Allstate “acted diligently, reasonably, fairly and promptly\n\nin denying [Mr. Wheeler]’s claim” tracks the language used to describe insurers’ duties\n\nunder Utah law, see Prince, 56 P.3d at 533, Mr. Wheeler correctly notes that the court did\n\nnot specifically discuss the parties’ evidence on the issues of diligent investigation and\n\nfair evaluation. Rather, the trial court appears to have based its determination that\n\nAllstate’s actions were reasonable largely on its prior conclusion that Mr. Wheeler’s loss\n\nplainly falls under Exclusion 3 of the Policy. But because we have rejected that rationale,\n\nand considering the evidence in the light most favorable to Mr. Wheeler, we cannot say\n\nthat no reasonable juror could find Allstate failed to diligently investigate and fairly\n\nevaluate whether any damage in Mr. Wheeler’s cabin was covered. See Jones v. Farmers\n\nIns. Exch., 286 P.3d 301, 303–06 (Utah 2012).\n\n       To that end, Mr. Wheeler presented testimony from an insurance expert opining\n\nthat Allstate acted unreasonably in approaching Mr. Wheeler’s claim “from a position of\n\nprematurely denying coverage.” Mr. Wheeler’s evidence also showed that Allstate’s\n\n                                              31\n\finvestigating adjuster “spent ‘ten minutes tops’ at the cabin and ‘took like two or three\n\npictures and left.’” Allstate, on the other hand, presented the adjuster’s report and the\n\nrebuttal testimony of its own insurance expert, both of which support its claim that it\n\nacted reasonably. In short, the evidence concerning the reasonableness of Allstate’s\n\nactions was disputed.\n\n       That said, we must next consider whether summary judgment was nonetheless\n\nappropriate because, as Allstate argues, Mr. Wheeler’s claim was “fairly debatable.”9\n\nUnder Utah law, “when an insured’s claim is fairly debatable, the insurer is entitled to\n\ndebate it and cannot be held to have breached the implied covenant [of good faith and fair\n\ndealing] if it chooses to do so.” Billings, 918 P.2d at 465. In other words, “as long as the\n\nappropriateness of coverage was ‘fairly debatable at the time it was denied,’ an insurer\n\ndoes not breach the duty of good faith simply because a court later determines the insurer\n\nwrongly denied coverage.” Blakely, 500 F. App’x at 738 (quoting Billings, 918 P.2d\n\nat 465).\n\n       Allstate asserts that the “fairly debatable” defense bars Mr. Wheeler’s bad faith\n\nclaim because, at the very least, the evidence presented here “create[s] a factual issue as\n\nto the validity of [Mr. Wheeler]’s water loss claim.” See also Prince, 56 P.3d at 535 (“[I]f\n\nthe evidence presented creates a factual issue as to the claim’s validity, there exists a\n\ndebatable reason for denial, . . . eliminating the bad faith claim.” (alteration in original)\n\n\n\n\n       9\n        Although Allstate argued this “fairly debatable” rationale below, the trial court’s\norder did not address it.\n                                              32\n\f(internal quotation marks omitted)). But Allstate misapprehends the Utah precedent\n\naddressing the fairly-debatable defense.\n\n       In Jones v. Farmers Insurance Exchange, the Utah Supreme Court admonished\n\nthat the factual-issue-as-to-the-claim’s-validity standard for demonstrating that an\n\ninsurance claim is “fairly debatable” must be strictly applied at the summary judgment\n\nstage. See 286 P.3d at 304. Jones involved a plaintiff who submitted a claim to his insurer\n\nseeking $14,000 in dental treatment for an injury allegedly sustained in a car crash that\n\noccurred four years earlier. Id. at 302–03. The plaintiff’s dentist sent the insurer a report\n\nin which the dentist attributed the plaintiff’s injury (cracked teeth) to the car crash. Id.\n\nThe insurer, after noting that the plaintiff’s emergency-room report showed no facial\n\ntrauma at the time of the accident and that the insurer “would have expected multiple\n\nfractured teeth to cause some pain or discomfort during the 4 years,” denied the claim. Id.\n\nat 303. The plaintiff sued, and the insurer moved for summary judgment on the plaintiff’s\n\nbad faith cause of action, arguing that the plaintiff’s insurance claim was fairly debatable.\n\nId. The trial court granted the insurer’s motion, but the Utah Supreme Court reversed.\n\n       The court cautioned that the fairly-debatable defense is all but precluded on\n\nsummary judgment where the alleged factual dispute as to coverage is premised not on\n\nconflicting evidence, but on the quality of the insured’s claim, which by extension\n\nimplicates the insurer’s reasonableness in denying coverage. See id. at 304–05. In such\n\nsituations, summary judgment is proper only where “reasonable minds could not differ as\n\nto whether the insurer’s conduct measured up to the required standard of care.” Id. at 305.\n\nThe Utah Supreme Court explained that to justify application of the fairly-debatable\n\n                                              33\n\fdefense at the summary judgment stage, there must be a legitimate factual dispute on\n\nwhich coverage under the insurance policy hinges and on which the insurer actually\n\npossessed conflicting evidence when it denied the claim. See id. at 305–06. The Jones\n\ncourt identified Prince and Callioux v. Progressive Insurance Co., 745 P.2d 838 (Utah\n\nCt. App. 1987), as cases in point.\n\n       Comparing the facts of these cases to the facts here, we do not believe Mr.\n\nWheeler’s insurance claim was “fairly debatable” as a matter of law, so as to justify\n\nsummary judgment on the bad faith claim. While we agree with Allstate that coverage\n\nunder the policy hinges on a genuine dispute of fact on which the parties have submitted\n\nevidence, none of that evidence was in hand at the time the claim was denied. Thus,\n\nunlike the insurers in Prince and Callioux, both of which denied insureds’ claims after\n\nreceiving expert reports indicating there was no coverage, see Prince, 56 P.3d at 529;\n\nCallioux, 745 P.2d at 839, 842, Allstate did not have any objective evidence indicating\n\nthere was no coverage at the time it denied the claim. Thus, Jones instructs that summary\n\njudgment is not appropriate unless “reasonable minds could not differ” on whether\n\nAllstate complied with its duties of diligent investigation, fair evaluation, and reasonable\n\nand prompt disposition. 286 P.3d at 305. And as discussed above, we cannot conclude the\n\nevidence on these questions is so lopsided that they may be determined as a matter of\n\nlaw.\n\n\n\n\n                                             34\n\f                                 IV. CONCLUSION\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the trial court’s order granting summary\n\njudgment for Allstate and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                            Entered for the Court\n\n\n                                            Carolyn B. McHugh\n                                            Circuit Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                           35\n\f15-4159, Wheeler v. Allstate Insurance Company, et al.\n\nMORITZ, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n       I read Wheeler’s opening brief to raise a single challenge to the district court’s\n\nruling that the Policy doesn’t cover the short-term damage to the cabin: Wheeler\n\nasserts that the district court erred in overlooking a genuine dispute of material fact.\n\nIn support, Wheeler points to his expert’s opinion that “the water damage to walls,\n\ncabinets, and other water[-] absorbing materials was beyond repair within less than a\n\nweek.” Aplt. App. 143. And in light of this evidence, Wheeler argues, the district\n\ncourt erred when it concluded that it was impossible “to determine exactly what\n\namount of damage would have occurred in the first few hours and days” of the leak.\n\nId. at 153.\n\n       Wheeler is correct that the district court erred when it suggested a reasonable\n\njury would be unable to attribute at least some of the damage to the first 13 days of\n\nthe leak. But as I read the district court’s order, this erroneous factual finding is only\n\none of the two independent bases the district court provided for granting Allstate’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment. And while I agree with the majority that Wheeler\n\nsuccessfully challenges the first of these two independent bases for the district\n\ncourt’s ruling, I would find that Wheeler fails to acknowledge—let alone challenge—\n\nthe second.\n\n       In granting Allstate’s motion for summary judgment, the district court began\n\nby framing the question before it as whether the Policy “should cover any of the\n\ndamage to [the] cabin.” Aplt. App. 137 (emphasis added). The district court then\n\fclarified its understanding of Wheeler’s position, stating, “[Wheeler] is only seeking\n\nrelief for the [short-term] damage” to the cabin. Id. at 145. Based on this language, it\n\nis clear that the district court understood Wheeler to be arguing that Exclusion 3\n\ndoesn’t apply to damage that occurs within the first 13 days of a leak if that leak\n\nultimately persists for 14 days or more.\n\n       Critically, the district court then explicitly (and repeatedly) rejected this\n\ninterpretation of Exclusion 3 as a matter of law. For instance, the court stated that it\n\n“disagree[d] with [Wheeler’s] attempt to persuade the [c]ourt to construe the\n\nlanguage [of Exclusion 3] in a more subtle, fine-tuned manner that favors . . .\n\nrecovery and ignores the contract’s plain language.” Id. at 146. And it ruled that\n\nExclusion 3 isn’t “fairly susceptible to the interpretation [Wheeler] suggest[ed].” Id.\n\nat 148. In other words, the district court unambiguously ruled that when a leak lasts\n\n14 days or more, Exclusion 3 applies to all of the damage the leak causes—even the\n\ndamage that occurs within the first 13 days: the district court stated, “The policy\n\nlanguage works to preclude coverage for exactly the type of damage that occurred in\n\nthis case . . . .” Id. at 153.\n\n       The majority correctly points out that the district court also stated that it found\n\nit “difficult if not impossible . . . to determine exactly what amount of damage would\n\nhave occurred in the first few hours and days” of the leak. Maj. Op. 10 (quoting Aplt.\n\nApp. 153). But in my opinion, the district court made it clear that this factual finding\n\nconstituted an alternative basis for its ruling that Wheeler isn’t entitled to coverage.\n\nSee Aplt. App. 153 (reiterating that “[i]n addition” to its factual finding, the district\n\n                                             2\n\fcourt was also granting Allstate’s motion based on its independent legal conclusion\n\nthat Exclusion 3 applies to all damage—including short-term damage—that occurs\n\nwhen a leak ultimately lasts 14 days or more (emphasis added)).\n\n      Thus, I read the district court’s order to provide two independent bases for\n\ngranting Allstate’s motion for summary judgment: (1) a reasonable jury would be\n\nunable to discern what damage occurred within the first 13 days of the leak, and\n\n(2) even assuming that a reasonable jury could make such a factual finding,\n\nExclusion 3 would nevertheless unambiguously operate to preclude coverage for the\n\nshort-term damage.\n\n      But Wheeler doesn’t even acknowledge this second aspect of the district\n\ncourt’s ruling in his opening brief, let alone attempt to challenge it.1 Accordingly,\n\n\n      1\n         The majority opinion nevertheless undertakes an analysis of the district\ncourt’s legal conclusion that Exclusion 3 doesn’t apply to short-term damage when a\nleak lasts at least 14 days. For instance, the majority reasons that any damage that\noccurs within the first 13 days of such a leak isn’t “caused by leakage over a period\nof 14 days or longer.” Maj. Op. 20. And the majority addresses and attempts to\ndistinguish the cases the district court relied on in rejecting Wheeler’s assertion that\nExclusion 3 doesn’t apply to short-term damage caused by a leak that ultimately lasts\nat least 14 days. See id. at 20-23.\n       As discussed below, see infra at 5-6, I disagree with the majority’s\ninterpretation of Exclusion 3, see Maj. Op. 20. But more significantly, I disagree with\nthe majority’s decision to reach that interpretation (and to ultimately reverse the\ndistrict court’s decision) based on an analysis that doesn’t appear anywhere in\nWheeler’s opening brief. When an appellant fails to “explain what was wrong with\nthe reasoning that the district court relied on in reaching its decision,” we typically\ndecline to do that work on the appellant’s behalf. Nixon v. City & Cty. of Denver, 784\nF.3d 1364, 1366 (10th Cir. 2015) (noting that “[t]he first task of an appellant is to\nexplain to us why the district court’s decision was wrong”; affirming judgment below\nbecause “reasons that were given by the district court” for its ruling went\n“unchallenged” by appellant); see Bronson v. Swensen, 500 F.3d 1099, 1104 (10th\nCir. 2007) (noting that we routinely decline “to consider arguments that are not\n                                            3\n\feven assuming that the district court erred in finding that it would be impossible for a\n\njury to separate the short-term damage from the long-term damage, I would affirm\n\nthe district court’s order granting summary judgment to Allstate on Wheeler’s breach\n\nof contract claim. See Bones v. Honeywell Int’l, Inc., 366 F.3d 869, 877 (10th Cir.\n\n2004) (explaining that because plaintiff failed to challenge both of district court’s\n\ntwo independent grounds for granting summary judgment to defendant, court didn’t\n\nneed to address plaintiff’s challenge to first of those two independent grounds; even\n\nif plaintiff “prevail[ed] on that issue, the grant of summary judgment to [defendant]\n\nwould still stand on the alternative ground which was not appealed”).\n\n      Moreover, because Wheeler doesn’t adequately challenge the district court’s\n\nruling that Exclusion 3 applies to both the short- and long-term damage to the cabin, I\n\nwould affirm the district court’s order granting summary judgment to Allstate on\n\nWheeler’s breach of contract claim without ever asking whether Exclusion 7 also\n\napplies to defeat coverage for the short-term loss.\n\n      Alternatively, even assuming that Wheeler has adequately challenged the\n\ndistrict court’s ruling that Exclusion 3 applies to preclude coverage for the short-term\n\nloss to the cabin, I would nevertheless affirm. Exclusion 3 applies to property loss\n\n“caused by . . . [s]eepage, meaning continuous or repeated seepage or leakage [of\n\nwater] over a period of weeks, months, or years.” Aplee. App. 312-13 (emphasis\n\nadded). This language unambiguously encompasses damage that occurs at any time\n\n\nraised, or are inadequately presented”). I see no compelling reason to depart from\nthat typical practice here.\n                                            4\n\fwithin that “period of weeks, months, or years”—including, critically, the first 13 days.\n\nId. at 313.\n\n       Wheeler’s interpretation of the Policy implicitly invites us to not only read out of\n\nExclusion 3 the language “over a period of,” id., but also to read into Exclusion 3\n\nadditional language that doesn’t appear there—i.e., language indicating that Exclusion 3\n\napplies only to loss (caused by seepage or leakage) that occurs after the seepage or\n\nleakage has lasted for at least two weeks.\n\n       I would decline this invitation. Instead, because Wheeler seeks coverage for\n\nproperty loss caused by a leak that unquestionably occurred “over a period” of two\n\nweeks or more, I would hold that Exclusion 3 unambiguously applies to all of the damage\n\nthe leak caused, including the damage that occurred during the first 13 days of the multi-\n\nweek “period” during which the leak ultimately persisted. Id. (emphasis added); see\n\nQuaid v. U.S. Healthcare, Inc., 158 P.3d 525, 527 (Utah 2007) (explaining that when\n\nlanguage of exclusion is unambiguous, court will afford that language its ordinary\n\nmeaning, even if the result is to deny coverage).\n\n       Finally, because Wheeler fails to demonstrate that he was entitled to coverage,\n\nI would hold that the district court didn’t err in granting summary judgment to\n\nAllstate on Wheeler’s claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n\nSee Jones v. Farmers Ins. Exch., 286 P.3d 301, 304 (Utah 2012) (“[W]hen an\n\ninsured’s claim is fairly debatable, the insurer is entitled to debate it and cannot be\n\nheld to have breached the implied covenant [of good faith] if it chooses to do so.”\n\n(second alteration in original) (quoting Billings ex rel.

Because Wheeler fails to demonstrate that he’s\n\nentitled to coverage, the validity of his claim was necessarily “fairly debatable,” and\n\nAllstate was therefore “entitled to debate it.” Id.

INTRODUCTION\n\n       This appeal arises from a dispute between Plaintiff–Appellant Thomas Wheeler\n\nand Defendants–Appellees Allstate Insurance Company and Allstate Indemnity Company\n\n(together, “Allstate”) over the scope of coverage under a homeowners insurance policy.\n\nAfter a water pipe burst and flooded Mr. Wheeler’s cabin, he filed a claim with Allstate,\n\nseeking coverage for some (but not all) of the resulting damage. When Allstate denied the\n\nclaim, Mr. Wheeler sued for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of\n\ngood faith and fair dealing.\n\n\n       *\n         This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of\nlaw of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its\npersuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.\n\f       A magistrate judge issued an order granting Allstate’s motion for summary\n\njudgment on both claims. Mr. Wheeler now appeals, arguing the magistrate judge erred\n\nby granting summary judgment in the face of a genuine dispute of material fact. We agree\n\nand therefore reverse.\n\n                                   II.   BACKGROUND\n\n                                    A. Factual History\n\n       Mr. Wheeler owns a seasonal cabin in Duck Creek, Utah. He carried homeowners\n\ninsurance on the cabin through Allstate. In April 2011, while on a walk near the cabin, an\n\nacquaintance of Mr. Wheeler stopped at the cabin for a drink of water. No one had visited\n\nthe cabin during the preceding winter months. Once inside, the acquaintance discovered\n\nthat “water was spraying out everywhere” from a pipe under a sink in the basement, and\n\nfour or five inches of standing water covered the basement floor. The damage to the cabin\n\nwas substantial. It later would be determined that the flooding began approximately two\n\nmonths earlier, as the result of a failed valve.\n\n       Soon after the problem was discovered, Mr. Wheeler had his assistant call Allstate\n\nto report it. The Allstate representative on the call informed the assistant that, based on\n\nthe information provided, Allstate likely would not cover the loss. On April 22, 2011,\n\nAllstate sent an outside adjuster to examine the cabin. According to Mr. Wheeler’s\n\ncontractor, who met the adjuster there, the adjuster inspected the cabin for “ten minutes\n\ntops” and “took like two or three pictures and left” without inspecting the source of the\n\nwater. The adjuster’s log of the inspection notes there was “extensive mold damage\n\nthroughout” the cabin, which constituted “the main loss.” It also states the adjuster\n\n                                               2\n\finformed Mr. Wheeler’s contractor that “long-term water damage and loss was not\n\ncovered,” and indicates that the adjuster “[w]ill send out [a] denial letter and close the\n\nfile.”\n\n         Mr. Wheeler’s homeowners insurance policy (the “Policy”) contained several\n\nprovisions concerning coverage for water damage. The language relevant to this case\n\nreads as follows:\n\n         Losses We Do Not Cover Under Coverage A, Coverage B and Coverage C\n\n            A. We do not cover loss to the property described in Coverage A—\n            Dwelling Protection or Coverage B—Other Structures Protection\n            consisting of or caused by the following:\n               ....\n\n               3. Seepage, meaning continuous or repeated seepage or leakage over\n               a period of weeks, months, or years, of water, steam or fuel:\n                   a) from a plumbing . . . system; or\n                   b) from, within or around any plumbing fixtures, including, but\n                      not limited to . . . sinks or other fixtures designed for the use\n                      of water or steam.\n               ....\n\n               7. a) wear and tear, aging, marring, scratching, deterioration,\n                  inherent vice, or latent defect;\n                  b) mechanical breakdown;\n                  ....\n\n                    d) rust or other corrosion;\n                    ....\n\n                    If any of a) through h) cause the sudden and accidental escape of\n                    water or steam from a plumbing . . . system within your dwelling,\n                    we cover the direct physical damage caused by the water or\n                    steam. If loss to covered property is caused by water or steam not\n                    otherwise excluded, we will cover the cost of tearing out and\n                    replacing any part of your dwelling necessary to repair the\n                    system or appliance. This does not include damage to the\n                    defective system or appliance from which the water escaped.\n\n                                                  3\n\fFor ease of understanding, we will refer to section A.3 as “Exclusion 3”; to section A.7 as\n\n“Exclusion 7”; and to the final paragraph of section A.7 as the “Exception to Exclusion\n\n7” or the “Exception.”\n\n       On April 26, 2011, Allstate sent Mr. Wheeler a letter denying his claim; the letter\n\ncited to Exclusion 3.\n\n                                 B. Procedural History\n\n       After Allstate denied his claim, Mr. Wheeler filed a lawsuit in Utah state court,\n\nalleging that Allstate breached the insurance contract and breached the implied covenant\n\nof good faith and fair dealing. Allstate removed the case to federal court on the basis of\n\ndiversity, 28 U.S.C. § 1332, and the parties later consented to the jurisdiction of the\n\nmagistrate judge (the “trial court”), id. § 636(c)(1). After conducting some discovery,\n\nAllstate moved for summary judgment on both claims, and Mr. Wheeler moved for\n\nsummary judgment on the breach of contract claim.\n\n                        1. The Parties’ Positions in the Trial Court\n\n       On the breach of contract claim, Allstate argued it properly denied coverage under\n\nExclusion 3 of the Policy, which it claimed unambiguously excludes coverage of water\n\ndamage such as that sustained in Mr. Wheeler’s cabin. Mr. Wheeler’s response to this\n\nargument was twofold. First, he argued that Exclusion 3 does not apply here at all. In\n\nparticular, he maintained that the terms “seepage” and “leakage” are ambiguous and that\n\nit is unclear whether either term embraces the water forcefully spraying from the pipe\n\nunder his basement sink. Mr. Wheeler also argued the definition of “seepage” is\n\n\n                                              4\n\fambiguous for the additional reason that it includes the term “weeks,” which, he\n\nmaintained, the parties agreed is ambiguous in the context of Exclusion 3. Thus, Mr.\n\nWheeler took the position that Exclusion 3 is a generally ambiguous provision and\n\ntherefore should be construed in favor of coverage under the default rule.1\n\n       Alternatively, however, Mr. Wheeler argued that even if Exclusion 3 is\n\nunambiguous, and the water release in his cabin generally could be considered “seepage\n\nor leakage,” the exclusion does not apply to his specific claimed loss because that loss\n\nwas sustained within the first few days of flooding. He noted that, whatever the term\n\n“weeks” might precisely mean, his and Allstate’s experts had agreed that it must at a\n\nminimum mean 14 days. And because he claimed coverage only for damage which\n\noccurred within 13 days of the water release, the loss would not be excluded because it\n\nwas not “caused by . . . seepage or leakage over a period of weeks.” According to Mr.\n\nWheeler, his expert had “demonstrated that the amount of flooding needed to cause the\n\ndamage that [Mr. Wheeler was claiming] would have happened [in] the first three days of\n\nflooding,” and “[t]he damages were not greater because the flood continued longer than 3\n\ndays.”2 By contrast, Mr. Wheeler stressed he was not seeking to recover for damages that\n\n\n\n       1\n         Mr. Wheeler’s argument that the Policy is ambiguous was also offered to support\nhis claim that Allstate breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The\nexpert Mr. Wheeler retained to evaluate Allstate’s handling of his claim opined that\nAllstate acted in bad faith by relying on ambiguous policy language to deny coverage,\nrather than fulfilling its alleged duty to search for coverage first.\n       2\n        In his report, Mr. Wheeler’s expert stated that “standing water must be removed\nin no more than 3 days [or else] irreparable damage [will be] effected due to water\ninvading expansive or absorbing materials.” He further concluded that, here, “the water\n                                             5\n\fwere caused over a longer period of time or that “would have been exacerbated by a\n\ndelay in discovering the flood.” Thus, he asserted that, “even were [Allstate’s]\n\nunderstanding of the policy to be accepted, [Allstate’s] understanding of the policy would\n\nnot cut off liability.”\n\n       Although he maintained that, ambiguous or not, Exclusion 3 does not apply to the\n\ndamages he sought to recover, Mr. Wheeler conceded those damages still would fall\n\nwithin the reach of Exclusion 7 because the failure of the valve likely was attributable to\n\none or more of the causes listed in paragraphs (a), (b), and (d) of that provision.3 But he\n\nargued the Exception to Exclusion 7 nonetheless provided coverage because the loss he\n\nwas claiming was “direct physical damage caused by” the “sudden and accidental escape\n\nof water . . . from a plumbing . . . system.” Construing the provisions together, Mr.\n\nWheeler argued the Policy’s language and the caselaw addressed by the parties “support[]\n\nthe notion that certain damages could be caused by seepage and excluded while other\n\ndamages, arising from the same flood, could be caused by [the sudden and accidental\n\nescape of water] and be covered.”\n\n       In response, Allstate acknowledged that its expert had agreed in her deposition\n\nthat there would be coverage for damage inflicted during the first 13 days. Specifically,\n\nAllstate’s expert agreed that it is “accurate to say that any damage that would have\n\n\ndamage to walls, cabinets, and other water absorbing materials was beyond repair within\nless than [a] week.”\n       3\n        These causes are “a) wear and tear, aging, marring, scratching, deterioration,\ninherent vice, or latent defect”; “b) mechanical breakdown”; and “d) rust or other\ncorrosion.”\n                                              6\n\foccurred during the first 13 days should be covered,” but only “[i]f there was a way to\n\ndetermine [what damage occurred during the first 13 days] but there is not.” Allstate\n\nargued, however, that the “reasoning for this conclusion” was that “damage which\n\noccurred during the first 13 days . . . would not have become seepage”—and thus “would\n\nnot have implicated” Exclusion 3—if the water release had been stopped within that\n\ntimeframe. Allstate also noted that the expert had concluded there should be no coverage\n\nhere; that the various cases the parties analyzed in their discussions of Exclusion 3 and\n\nthe Exception to Exclusion 7 say nothing about discerning short-term versus long-term\n\ndamage; and that requiring an insurer to identify and separate short-term damage “would\n\nbe expensive and likely fruitless.” Allstate further contended that the Exception does not\n\napply in this case because “a continuous water loss that occurs over a 70-day period” is\n\nnot “sudden and accidental.”\n\n       On the claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,\n\nAllstate argued it did not breach the covenant because it diligently investigated, fairly\n\nevaluated, and promptly and reasonably rejected Mr. Wheeler’s insurance claim.\n\nAlternatively, Allstate claimed it cannot have breached the covenant as a matter of law\n\nbecause Mr. Wheeler’s claim was “fairly debatable.” Mr. Wheeler argued in response\n\nthat fact disputes precluded summary judgment on the implied covenant claim.\n\n                               2. The Trial Court’s Decision\n\n       The trial court considered the parties’ motions together and, after conducting a\n\nhearing, issued an order granting Allstate’s motion and denying Mr. Wheeler’s. At the\n\noutset of its written analysis, the court acknowledged that Mr. Wheeler was seeking only\n\n                                              7\n\fdamages caused during the first week of flooding and was not requesting long-term\n\ndamages, such as mold.\n\n      The trial court first concluded Exclusion 3 is unambiguous, rejecting Mr.\n\nWheeler’s contrary argument and accepting as “in line with the plain meaning of the\n\n[Policy]” Allstate’s counsel’s statement that “the only time [water damage is] not\n\ncovered, the only time [Exclusion 3] comes in is when we’re dealing with a long term\n\nloss.” (Alteration omitted.) The trial court further determined that American Concept\n\nInsurance Co. v. Jones, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2594395\"><a href=\"/opinion/2594395/american-concept-ins-co-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">935</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1220</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1225–27 (D. Utah 1996), which found a\n\nsimilarly worded insurance-policy provision unambiguous, supported the conclusion that\n\nExclusion 3 is not ambiguous.\n\n      Next, the court turned to Mr. Wheeler’s arguments that “the Court should construe\n\nwhat happened at his cabin” as being covered under the Exception to Exclusion 7 and\n\nthat its primary task was to determine whether the release of water here was “sudden,”\n\nwithin the meaning of the phrase “sudden and accidental.” The court concluded “there is\n\nno need as [Mr. Wheeler] suggests, to interpret whether the loss was ‘sudden’” because,\n\nfor reasons the court would “explain[] in more detail below, the Court finds [Exclusion] 3\n\nexcludes coverage of [Mr. Wheeler]’s claim and therefore [Exclusion] 7 does not apply.”\n\n      In reaching its conclusion that “the [E]xception is triggered only if no other\n\nexclusion applies,” the court relied on Marsh v. American Family Mutual Insurance Co.,\n\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2596981\"><a href=\"/opinion/2596981/marsh-v-american-family-mut-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">218</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Or. Ct. App. 2009).4 There, the Oregon Court of Appeals held that water\n\ndamage caused by continuous leakage over a period of at least several months, and more\n\nlikely years, was specifically excluded under a provision similar to Exclusion 3, even\n\nthough the policy provided coverage for other water damage under a provision similar to\n\nthe Exception to Exclusion 7. See id. at 574–75, 577–78. According to the trial court\n\nhere, the reasoning in Marsh aligned “with Allstate’s arguments . . . that if [Mr. Wheeler]\n\nhad discovered his loss in a more timely fashion, perhaps there would have been\n\ncoverage but because [Mr. Wheeler]’s loss was over an extended period of time, the\n\nexclusionary language precludes [Mr. Wheeler]’s recovery. Therefore, like Marsh, the\n\nexceptions do not apply.”\n\n       Finally, the trial court asserted that the fact Mr. Wheeler was “only claiming loss\n\nfor the first few days of water damage” had “no effect on the Court’s decision based upon\n\nthe facts of this case.” The court then elaborated:\n\n       Because the damage to [Mr. Wheeler]’s cabin was so extensive and was not\n       found for at least 60–70 days, it is difficult if not impossible for the Court\n       to determine exactly what amount of damage would have occurred in the\n       first few hours and days. In addition, the Court believes the interpretation\n       [Mr. Wheeler] wishes the Court to make is against the authority cited above\n       both in this District and others that found coverage to be specifically\n       excluded for long-term water damage. The policy language works to\n       preclude coverage for exactly the type of damage that occurred in this\n       case—water damage that was undiscovered or unattended for an extended\n       period of time regardless of the source.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n         It also relied on Schwartzenfeld v. Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Co., No.\n296752, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1565466</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Mich. Ct.

DISCUSSION\n\n       Mr. Wheeler argues there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the\n\nshort-term damage (i.e., damage fully inflicted in 13 days or less) to his cabin can be\n\nseparated from the long-term damage (i.e., damage not fully inflicted until 14 days or\n\nmore) and that the trial court impermissibly resolved this factual dispute itself in granting\n\nsummary judgment for Allstate. From a coverage standpoint, Mr. Wheeler asserts the\n\nseverability of damages is material because, by its terms, Exclusion 3 applies only to\n\nlong-term damage, such that short-term damage is not excluded under that provision\n\nunless it cannot reliably be established as distinct from long-term damage. And because\n\nhere he seeks to recover only short-term damages which his expert says are separable,\n\nMr. Wheeler’s position is that, contrary to the trial court’s conclusion, his damages are\n\nnot excluded. Rather, Mr. Wheeler contends, as he did below, that his short-term\n\ndamages are covered under the Exception to Exclusion 7. Mr. Wheeler also argues the\n\ntrial court erred in rejecting his implied covenant claim because its ruling on that claim\n\nwas premised on its erroneous conclusion that Exclusion 3 precludes Mr. Wheeler’s\n\nrecovery.\n\n       Allstate disagrees and argues the trial court properly granted summary judgment\n\non both claims. It concedes that the question of whether short-term damage can be\n\ndistinguished from long-term damage is a disputed issue of fact but argues that it is not\n\nmaterial and that the trial court’s finding on that issue is therefore harmless. Thus, the\n\ncentral issue on appeal is whether the severability of short- and long-term damages is\n\nmaterial and, accordingly, should have precluded summary judgment.

It is,\n\ntherefore, material. We further agree that this factual dispute is material not just to Mr.\n\nWheeler’s breach of contract claim, but also to his breach of the implied covenant of\n\ngood faith claim. It follows, then, that the trial court erred in disposing of these claims on\n\nsummary judgment. In explaining our reasoning, we address each of Mr. Wheeler’s\n\nclaims separately, beginning with breach of contract.\n\n                                  A. Breach of Contract\n\n         To decide whether the factual dispute over the divisibility of water damages is\n\nmaterial to Mr. Wheeler’s breach of contract claim, we must determine whether the\n\nresolution of that dispute could affect the scope of coverage under the Policy. If the\n\nalleged short-term damage is not covered under the Policy, then Allstate could not have\n\nbreached the Policy by denying coverage, regardless of whether the short-term damage\n\ncan be established independently.

Application\n\n       To begin, we acknowledge that neither the Policy nor the parties’ briefing in the\n\ntrial court or on appeal is a model of clarity. This imprecision is responsible for the\n\ndivergent views of the majority, the dissent, and the trial court concerning the issues and\n\narguments advanced, as well as the meaning of the Policy itself. Although each opinion\n\nevidences a thoughtful look at the language of the Policy and the parties’ arguments, little\n\nagreement has been reached. With that backdrop, we begin by outlining the few points of\n\nconsensus.\n\n       The parties agree on the general analytical framework applicable to the question of\n\nwhether Mr. Wheeler’s claimed loss is covered under the Policy. They assume that, even\n\nif the loss does not also fall under Exclusion 3, it was caused by “wear and tear,”\n\n“mechanical breakdown,” or “rust or other corrosion,” such that it falls under\n\nExclusion 7, unless the Exception to Exclusion 7 applies. Thus, both parties organize\n\ntheir arguments around the premise that, for Mr. Wheeler’s loss to be covered under the\n\nPolicy, it must both (1) fall outside the scope of Exclusion 3 and (2) fall inside the scope\n\nof the Exception to Exclusion 7. The trial court agreed with this general framework,\n\nreasoning that it must decide, first, whether Exclusion 3 is ambiguous, and then, if it is\n\nnot, whether Mr. Wheeler’s loss falls under Exclusion 3 or, instead, the Exception to\n\nExclusion 7.\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\f       Accordingly, we will analyze Mr. Wheeler’s claim under each of these provisions\n\nin turn, discussing the trial court’s reasoning and the parties’ arguments as we go.\n\n                                       a. Exclusion 3\n\n       Under Exclusion 3 of the Policy, Allstate disclaimed responsibility for damage\n\n“consisting of or caused by . . . [s]eepage, meaning continuous or repeated seepage or\n\nleakage over a period of weeks, months, or years, of water . . . from, within or around any\n\nplumbing fixtures, including . . . sinks.”\n\n       Despite Allstate’s assertion to the contrary, Mr. Wheeler does not challenge on\n\nappeal the trial court’s conclusion that this provision is unambiguous. Rather, Mr.\n\nWheeler’s appellate position is consistent with his alternative position below that, even if\n\nExclusion 3 is deemed unambiguous, the short-term damages he is claiming do not fall\n\nwithin its reach and instead fall within the Exception to Exclusion 7. In other words, Mr.\n\nWheeler accepts the trial court’s construction of the Policy—that Exclusion 3 eliminates\n\ncoverage for damage caused by the continuous leakage of water over a period of weeks\n\nor longer, and that damage which is excluded under Exclusion 3 cannot be recovered\n\nunder the Exception to Exclusion 7. But he takes the position that this interpretation\n\nsimply does not speak to the short-term damages he seeks to recover, which are by policy\n\ndefinition not caused by seepage. Mr. Wheeler further concedes that if, as the trial court\n\nfound, it is not possible to reliably distinguish short-term damage from long-term damage\n\nto which Exclusion 3 does apply, then his short-term damages cannot be recovered. He\n\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\fclaims, however, that the trial court impermissibly made a factual finding on the\n\nseverability issue despite his expert’s testimony that severance is possible.5\n\n       Given that no party argues otherwise, we will assume for purposes of this appeal\n\nthat the language of Exclusion 3 is unambiguous.

What we cannot accept, however, is Allstate’s\n\nassumption, clearly implicated in its arguments here and in the trial court, that if\n\nExclusion 3 of the Policy is deemed unambiguous, Mr. Wheeler cannot recover. These\n\n\n       5\n          In the dissent’s view, the trial court determined, as an independent conclusion of\nlaw, that if a water release causes any damage that falls under the plain language of\nExclusion 3, then Exclusion 3 bars recovery of all damage associated with that water\nrelease, regardless of whether the damage was fully inflicted within a matter of days. And\nbecause Mr. Wheeler does not explicitly articulate, and then refute, that supposed\nconclusion, the dissent believes we must accept it as unchallenged and, here, dispositive.\n        But we do not see this conclusion expressed, let alone explained, anywhere in the\ntrial court’s order. To be sure, this view of the Policy would have led the trial court to the\nresult it reached, and it certainly is feasible that this conclusion, though unexpressed,\ncould have informed the reasoning the court did express. However, we think the better\nreading of the trial court’s order—one which, at the very least, we cannot penalize Mr.\nWheeler for gleaning—is that the court’s finding that the short- and long-term damages\ncould not reliably be distinguished was central to its conclusion that Mr. Wheeler’s\ndamages are barred by Exclusion 3. Indeed, every time the trial court discussed\nExclusion 3’s application it referred to “long term loss,” “loss . . . over an extended\nperiod of time,” or “long-term water damage.” Given the parties’ focus in their summary\njudgment briefing on pre- and post-“weeks” damages, and Mr. Wheeler’s argument that\nunder the plain language of the Policy his short-term damages are covered, we consider\nthe trial court’s finding as to severability essential to its conclusion that Mr. Wheeler\nsuffered only long-term damages that fall under Exclusion 3.\n        And in any event, Mr. Wheeler clearly asserts here, as he did below, that his short-\nterm damages are not barred by Exclusion 3. Thus, Mr. Wheeler advocates an\ninterpretation of a contract that runs counter to the trial court’s interpretation of the same\ncontract, squarely presenting to us a legal issue that we review de novo. Under these\ncircumstances, we disagree with the dissent’s conclusion that Mr. Wheeler has waived\nany argument critical to his ability to succeed on appeal.\n                                             16\n\fare not equivalent, interchangeable conclusions—to say that Exclusion 3 is unambiguous\n\nis not to say, automatically, that it embraces the damages Mr. Wheeler is claiming. To the\n\ncontrary, we agree with Mr. Wheeler, for the reasons set forth below, that Exclusion 3\n\ndoes not apply to his short-term damages; and even if the exclusion could be interpreted\n\notherwise, we would be bound under Utah law to construe it in Mr. Wheeler’s favor.

Exclusion 3 provides in relevant part that Allstate does not cover household\n\ndamage “caused by . . . [s]eepage, meaning continuous or repeated seepage or leakage\n\nover a period of weeks, months, or years.” This language “clearly and unmistakably\n\ncommunicates to the insured,” Crook, 980 P.2d at 686, that damage “caused by” weeks or\n\nmonths of continuous leakage is excluded, and no party disagrees. But by extension, then,\n\nit is equally plain that damage not “caused by” weeks or months of leakage—or, to\n\nphrase it differently, damage “caused by” less than weeks of leakage—is not excluded.\n\nAnd because the parties concur that “weeks,” plural, must at the very least mean two\n\nweeks, we agree with Mr. Wheeler that, by its terms, Exclusion 3 does not clearly and\n\nunmistakably apply to damage caused by less than 14 days of leakage.\n\n                                            17\n\f       Allstate’s expert insurance adjuster agreed with this interpretation. As the trial\n\ncourt stated, “in her deposition [Allstate’s expert] agreed with [Mr. Wheeler]’s counsel’s\n\nquestion that any damage that would have occurred during the first 13 days would be\n\ncovered under [Mr. Wheeler]’s policy.”\n\n       Nonetheless, Allstate maintains on appeal that Mr. Wheeler’s claimed damages are\n\nbarred under Exclusion 3. First, Allstate asserts Mr. Wheeler cannot recover the damages\n\nhe alleges were beyond repair within 13 days because Exclusion 3 “does not state that\n\ncoverage is afforded for damages that occur in the first thirteen days.” But this contention\n\nturns Utah’s rule of interpretation on its head. Under Utah law, exclusionary provisions\n\nmust explicitly define the circumstances under which coverage will be denied and are\n\n“strictly construed against the insurer.” See Oltmanns, 285 P.3d at 805 (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). Thus, mere silence in an exclusion does not bar coverage.\n\n       And Allstate’s main line of reasoning misses the central point of Mr. Wheeler’s\n\nposition. As noted above, after wrongly asserting that Mr. Wheeler is claiming\n\nExclusion 3 is ambiguous, Allstate argues Exclusion 3 is unambiguous and assumes that\n\nto reach that conclusion is to further conclude Exclusion 3 applies to all of Mr. Wheeler’s\n\ndamages. From this vantage point, Allstate contends the factual question of whether\n\nshort-term damages can be isolated and separately established, while disputed, is\n\nimmaterial. Allstate contrasts this “immaterial” factual dispute with what it describes as\n\n“the undisputed material facts” which, in Allstate’s view, properly informed the trial\n\ncourt’s conclusion that Exclusion 3 precludes coverage here. In sum, Allstate expresses\n\nits view of the exclusion’s application in this case as follows:\n\n                                             18\n\f       Exclusion [3] makes clear that the [P]olicy does not cover loss to property\n       caused by the seepage or leakage of water from a plumbing system\n       occurring over a period of weeks or months. The loss to Mr. Wheeler’s\n       cabin resulted from the leakage of water from a plumbing system . . . that\n       occurred over a period of weeks or months. Mr. Wheeler cannot, and has\n       not, disputed these material facts, or cited to a case anywhere in the country\n       to support his contention [that Exclusion 3 is ambiguous].\n\nBut while there is nothing particularly objectionable about the first of these sentences—in\n\nthat it fairly encapsulates the meaning of Exclusion 3 in general terms—the latter\n\nsentences misapprehend Mr. Wheeler’s stance as to the central dispute in this case.\n\n       Mr. Wheeler’s position is that the loss he seeks to recover, as opposed to other loss\n\nhe admits he must absorb, did not “result from” weeks or months of leakage. Allstate\n\nappears to contend that the water release here could not have caused discrete losses to\n\ndifferent components of Mr. Wheeler’s cabin, and must be treated as one cohesive loss.\n\nThat is, Allstate seemingly asserts the Policy terminates coverage when a long-term water\n\nrelease occurs, even absent a causal link between the duration of the release and the\n\ndamages claimed. But the Policy does not support this position.\n\n       By its terms, the Policy eliminates coverage for damage, so long as that damage is\n\n“caused by” any of the events listed in several enumerated exclusionary provisions, of\n\nwhich Exclusions 3 and 7 are examples. Accordingly, Exclusion 3 operates to exclude\n\nfrom coverage any damage that is caused by seepage, which, as discussed, means\n\ncontinuous leakage over a period of 14 days or longer. Here, however, Mr. Wheeler\n\nasserts the damage he seeks to recover was “complete within the first week of the\n\nflooding.” Thus, assuming this assertion is correct as a factual matter, Mr. Wheeler’s\n\nclaimed damage was not caused by leakage over a period of 14 days or longer; it was\n\n                                            19\n\fcaused by leakage over a period of less than 14 days and thus was not caused by seepage.\n\nAs such, the damage does not clearly and unmistakably fall within Exclusion 3.\n\n       Accordingly, we depart from the reasoning of the trial court. As summarized at the\n\noutset, the trial court determined that Exclusion 3 “excludes coverage of [Mr. Wheeler]’s\n\nclaim and therefore [the Exception to Exclusion 7] does not apply.” But it reached this\n\ndetermination by concluding, in step with Allstate’s approach, that Exclusion 3 is\n\nunambiguous, without explaining how it unambiguously excludes short-term damage.\n\nYet, the trial court agreed with Allstate’s counsel that the “only time [water damage is]\n\nnot covered, the only time [Exclusion 3] comes in is when we’re dealing with a long term\n\nloss.” And the premise of Mr. Wheeler’s argument is that he is not, in fact, seeking\n\nrecovery for “long term loss.” Thus, the short-term loss sought by Mr. Wheeler, if\n\ncapable of being severed from the long-term loss, actually falls outside the trial court’s\n\ninterpretation of Exclusion 3.\n\n       Nor are we persuaded by the trial court’s reliance on decisions holding that, when\n\na provision like Exclusion 3 applies, it supersedes a provision like the Exception, and\n\ncoverage is excluded.

Because the damage to [Mr.\n       Wheeler]’s cabin was so extensive and was not found for at least 60–70\n       days, it is difficult if not impossible for the Court to determine exactly what\n       amount of damage would have occurred in the first few hours and days.\n\n(Emphases added.) As even Allstate concedes, however, the separability of short- and\n\nlong-term water damage is a disputed factual question in this case: Allstate’s insurance\n\nexpert opined that there was no way to determine these damages separately, but Mr.\n\nWheeler’s mechanical and plumbing expert reported that he could, in fact, make that\n\ndetermination. Thus, this factual dispute was not “for the Court to determine” on\n\nsummary judgment.\n\n       The trial court’s reliance on authorities “that found coverage to be specifically\n\nexcluded for long-term water damage” under similar insurance provisions does not\n\nconvince us otherwise. Again, this statement assumes that Mr. Wheeler suffered only\n\n\n                                              21\n\f“long-term water damage,” which all parties agree is unambiguously precluded by\n\nExclusion 3. More importantly, however, all of the cases cited in the trial court’s order\n\n(and the parties’ briefs) involve claims for damage that was undisputedly caused by\n\nleakage over a period of weeks, months, or years. See Am. Concept, 935 F.

Thus, none of them supports the\n\nnotion that short-term water damage cannot be isolated and reliably proved, and none\n\nsuggests Exclusion 3 applies to the short-term loss Mr. Wheeler seeks to recover in this\n\ncase.\n\n\n\n                                            22\n\f       It is also true, as discussed, that Exclusion 3 is silent on the issue, meaning it does\n\nnot clearly and unmistakably exclude damages caused by leakage or seepage for less than\n\nweeks, month, or years. Accordingly, if Mr. Wheeler can segregate his short-term losses\n\nfrom his long-term losses, the short-term losses are not barred by the unambiguous\n\nlanguage of Exclusion 3.\n\n       It follows from this discussion that Mr. Wheeler’s asserted factual dispute affects\n\nwhether Exclusion 3 applies. We must next determine, then, whether Mr. Wheeler’s\n\nshort-term damage, if he can separately establish it, would be covered under the\n\nException to Exclusion 7.\n\n                                b. Exception to Exclusion 7\n\n       The trial court concluded Mr. Wheeler’s damages were excluded under\n\nExclusion 3 and therefore did not construe the Exception to Exclusion 7 or analyze its\n\napplication to the present facts. Nonetheless, the parties address this issue in their briefs,\n\nand we consider it to determine if we can affirm on this alternative ground.7\n\n\n       7\n          Mr. Wheeler assumed in his opening brief that the escape of water from the pipe\nin his basement was undisputedly “sudden and accidental” within the meaning of the\nException to Exclusion 7. It was only after Allstate argued to the contrary in its answer\nbrief that Mr. Wheeler, in his reply brief, provided substantive analysis on this point and\nargued that whether the water’s release was “sudden and accidental” is a disputed issue of\nfact. Although we usually choose not to consider arguments raised for the first time in a\nreply brief, Stump v. Gates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"159583\"><a href=\"/opinion/159583/stump-v-gates/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 533 (10th Cir. 2000), we conclude the reasons\nfor applying this discretionary rule of abstention are not present here.\n        For one, the trial court expressly declined to decide whether the escape of water in\nthis case was sudden and accidental, so there was no determination contrary to Mr.\nWheeler’s position to which a response clearly was required. But more importantly, this\nis not a situation in which the appellee has been deprived of an opportunity to respond to\na new argument or characterization of the record, or in which we need “protect[ion] . . .\nfrom publishing an erroneous opinion” with respect to the law or the facts. Id.; see also\n                                              23\n\f       There is no dispute that the damage at issue here falls within Exclusion 7 and\n\ntherefore must also be within the scope of the exception to that exclusion to be covered\n\nunder the Policy. The Exception states:\n\n       If any of a) through h) cause the sudden and accidental escape of water or\n       steam from a plumbing . . . system within your dwelling, we cover the\n       direct physical damage caused by the water or steam. If loss to covered\n       property is caused by water or steam not otherwise excluded, we will cover\n       the cost of tearing out and replacing any part of your dwelling necessary to\n       repair the system or appliance. This does not include damage to the\n       defective system or appliance from which the water escaped.\n\n(Emphases added.)\n\n       Interpreting this language, Allstate says the Exception “provides coverage for\n\nwater loss if such loss was ‘sudden and accidental,’” and argues the fact that “Mr.\n\nWheeler does not dispute that it took him [60–70] days to discover the water loss . . .\n\ncompels the conclusion that the loss was not ‘sudden and accidental.’” Allstate then\n\nreferences three cases in which this court interpreted the phrase “sudden and accidental,”\n\narguing they establish that the phrase is unambiguous and does not embrace Mr.\n\nWheeler’s loss here.

Contrary to Allstate’s reading, however, that precedent does\n\nnot support Allstate’s position that the Exception to Exclusion 7 is inapplicable here.\n\nIndeed, one case in particular is substantially on point and firmly establishes that Mr.\n\nWheeler’s claimed loss, if provable, is covered under the Exception.\n\n        In Gridley Associates, Ltd. v. Transamerica Insurance Co., the plaintiff owned a\n\ngas station which, from November 1985 to February 1986, recorded a shortfall of\n\napproximately 12,000 gallons between the volume of gasoline actually sold and the\n\nvolume purchased and stored in the station’s underground tank. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1171482\"><a href=\"/opinion/1171482/gridley-associates-v-transamerica-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">828</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 524–25\n\n(Utah Ct. App. 1992). Concerned, the plaintiff hired a company in early February 1986 to\n\ninspect the station’s fuel system, and it concluded “there was a gasoline leak resulting\n\nfrom a broken pipe which connected the gasoline storage tank with the gasoline\n\n[pumps].” Id. at 525. The evidence established that “the break in the pipe was a ‘clean\n\nbreak’ that ‘would have had to have been caused by an adjustment of the area in which it\n\nis in.’” Id.\n\n        The plaintiff filed a claim with its general liability insurer for the cost of\n\nenvironmental cleanup. Id. The policy contained a pollution exclusion which disclaimed\n\ncoverage for “property damage arising out of the discharge, dispersal, release or escape\n\nof [various pollutants] into or upon land.” Id. But the exclusion contained the following\n\nexception: “this exclusion does not apply if such discharge, dispersal, release or escape is\n\n                                               25\n\fsudden and accidental.” Id. The insurer denied coverage under the exclusion, and the\n\nplaintiff sued. Id. The trial court found the insurer liable under the exception to the\n\nexclusion, and the insurer appealed. See id. at 525–26.\n\n          The sole issue on appeal was whether the gasoline leak was “sudden,” within the\n\nmeaning of the phrase “sudden and accidental.” Id. at 526. Like Allstate does here, the\n\ninsurer in Gridley maintained that the leak “was not ‘sudden’ because it continued for an\n\nextended period of time.” Id. Casting the issue as one of first impression in Utah, the\n\nUtah Court of Appeals determined that the word “sudden,” as used in the phrase “sudden\n\nand accidental,” has an unambiguous meaning. Id. at 527. Reading the terms together, the\n\ncourt concluded that for a “discharge, dispersal, release or escape” to have been “sudden\n\nand accidental,” it must have been both quick or abrupt and unexpected or unintentional.\n\nSee id.\n\n          Applying this understanding to the facts of that case, the Gridley court concluded\n\nthat the gasoline leak was “sudden and accidental” and therefore fell within the exception\n\nto the policy’s pollution exclusion. Id. The court noted that the evidence suggested the\n\nbreak in the pipe was a “clean break,” which would have “resulted in an unexpected as\n\nwell as an immediate and abrupt flow of gasoline from the severed line,” as opposed to a\n\nbreak slowly caused by corrosion “which would have resulted in a gradual drip or trickle\n\nof gasoline from the line.” Id. Critical for our purposes here, the court had this to say of\n\nthe fact that the leak persisted for a long period of time:\n\n          [The insurer]’s argument that the discharge could not possibly have been\n          “sudden” because the spill lasted for an extended period of time is without\n          merit. While the record . . . indicates that although the break in the line\n\n                                               26\n\f       occurred in approximately November 1985 and was not discovered by [the\n       plaintiff] until early February 1986, the explicit language of [the plaintiff]’s\n       policy only requires that the discharge itself be “sudden” in order to be\n       covered under the policy. The length of time that elapses before the leak is\n       discovered is irrelevant, as to the suddenness of the discharge. . . .\n       Accordingly, in the case at bar, where there was damage to a line which\n       caused an immediate spill of gasoline into the ground that remained\n       undiscovered by [the plaintiff] for some months, the discharge itself was\n       still “sudden” as contemplated by the exception to the pollution exclusion.\n\nId. at 527–28 (emphases added) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       One need only replace “gasoline” with “water” to know what Utah law prescribes\n\nin the present case. Like the exception in Gridley, the “explicit language” of which\n\nrequired that the “escape” itself be sudden and accidental, the Exception to Exclusion 7\n\nplainly focuses on the escape itself: it states that damage caused by “the sudden and\n\naccidental escape of water or steam from a plumbing . . . system” is exempt from\n\nExclusion 7. (Emphasis added.) Allstate’s argument that the loss caused by the escaped\n\nwater was not sudden and accidental is thus beside the point. Moreover, the undisputed\n\nevidence shows that the escape of water into Mr. Wheeler’s cabin began when a pipe\n\nunder the basement sink burst due to a failed valve and that the release of water was\n\n“immediate and abrupt,” rather than “a gradual drip or trickle”: when the leak was found,\n\n“water was spraying out everywhere” and the spray shot out “about 2–3 feet.” Gridley\n\nplainly instructs that, under these circumstances, the “escape of water” was “sudden and\n\naccidental” within the meaning of the Exception, regardless of whether the leak went\n\nundiscovered for 60–70 days.\n\n       The Quaker State / Anaconda / Hartford line of cases, in which this court applied\n\nUtah law to pollution provisions similar to the one in Gridley, does not suggest otherwise.\n\n                                             27\n\fIn the first of those cases, Hartford, this court noted that the Utah Supreme Court had not\n\nyet interpreted the phrase “sudden and accidental” in the context of an insurance\n\nexclusion, and that it was therefore this court’s responsibility to “give the clause the\n\ninterpretation we believe the Utah [Supreme] [C]ourt would.” 962 F.2d at 1487.\n\nUltimately, we settled on the interpretation provided by the Utah Court of Appeals in\n\nGridley. Id. at 1490. The Anaconda and Quaker State decisions subsequently employed\n\nthat interpretation, too. Quaker State, 52 F.3d at 1528; Anaconda, 990 F.2d at 1177–79.\n\n       In all three cases, this court applied the interpretation “that ‘sudden and accidental’\n\nunambiguously means ‘abrupt or quick and unexpected or unintended,’” e.g., Quaker\n\nState, 52 F.3d at 1258, to largely analogous fact patterns: plaintiffs claiming that\n\nnumerous discharges of pollution over a decade or more should be covered under\n\nexceptions to pollution exclusions in their insurance policies. E.g., id. at 1524–27. And in\n\neach case, this court determined that such discharges were not covered because, “under\n\nUtah law continuous, routine, or gradual discharges of pollutants are not ‘abrupt’ or\n\n‘quick’ and thereby not ‘sudden’ within the meaning of ‘sudden and accidental.’” Id. at\n\n1528 (citing Anaconda, 990 F.2d at 1179; Hartford, 962 F.2d at 1489, 1492).\n\n       Although the focus on “continuous” and “gradual” might otherwise have implied\n\nthat a single, lasting leak could not be “sudden and accidental,” in each case the court’s\n\nholding was premised on, and limited to, long-term, repeated discharges attendant to the\n\nroutine business operations of the plaintiffs. E.g., id. at 1528–30; Hartford, 962 F.2d at\n\n1489, 1492. Indeed, this court recently characterized Quaker State, Anaconda, and\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\fHartford as cases that hinged on “the routine commercial activities of the insured.”\n\nHeadwaters Res., Inc. v.

See Sharon Steel Corp. v.\n\nAetna Cas. & Sur. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1169781\"><a href=\"/opinion/1169781/sharon-steel-v-aetna-cas-and-sur/\"><span class=\"volume\">931</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">127</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Utah 1997). In Sharon Steel, the Utah Supreme\n\nCourt expressly approved of and reaffirmed Gridley. Id. at 135. It also approved of the\n\nQuaker State line of cases, but only after characterizing the reasoning of those cases as\n\n“focused on whether the pollution was a ‘concomitant’ of regular business activity rather\n\nthan a series of unrelated accidents.” Id. at 136. Thus here, we need not parse our\n\nprecedent “to determine, as best we can, how this issue would be resolved by the Utah\n\nSupreme Court.” Quaker State, 52 F.3d at 1527. The Utah Supreme Court has spoken,\n\nand Gridley controls: because the escape here was sudden and accidental, it triggers the\n\nException to Exclusion 7, even though it remained undetected for an extended period.\n\n                                      *      *      *\n\n       We therefore conclude that, if Mr. Wheeler can prove the damages he is seeking\n\nwere caused within the first 13 days of the release, then the damages fall outside\n\nExclusion 3 and inside the Exception to Exclusion 7. In that situation, the damages would\n\nbe covered under the Policy and Allstate would have breached the Policy by denying\n\ncoverage. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Mr. Wheeler, a reasonable\n\njury could find that the short- and long-term damages are, in fact, separable. Accordingly,\n\n\n\n                                            29\n\fwe conclude there is a genuine dispute of material fact that should have precluded the\n\ntrial court’s grant of summary judgment on the breach of contract claim.\n\n           B. Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing\n\n       Having determined summary judgment was not appropriate on the breach of\n\ncontract claim, we must next consider whether summary judgment was appropriate as to\n\nthe claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The parties’\n\narguments here focus on whether Allstate in fact complied with its duty of good faith and,\n\nalternatively, whether Mr. Wheeler’s insurance claim was “fairly debatable,” such that\n\nAllstate could not have acted in bad faith in denying coverage.8 After stating the relevant\n\nlaw, we address each of these questions in turn, concluding that summary judgment was\n\nnot warranted on this claim.\n\n       Under Utah law, the implied covenant of good faith in the insurance context\n\n“contemplates, at the very least, that the insurer will diligently investigate the facts to\n\nenable it to determine whether a claim is valid, will fairly evaluate the claim, and will\n\nthereafter act promptly and reasonably in rejecting or settling the claim.” Prince v.

Thus, “[i]f\n\n       8\n         Allstate also asserts that the claim should fail because Mr. Wheeler’s complaint\n“only made one general allegation” in support of it. But as Mr. Wheeler notes, this case is\nat the summary judgment stage, where the parties must move beyond the pleadings. The\nrecord shows Mr. Wheeler moved well beyond “one general allegation” at the summary\njudgment stage.\n                                              30\n\fan insurer acts reasonably in denying a claim, then the insurer did not contravene the\n\ncovenant.” Prince, 56 P.3d at 533. In Utah, “[w]hether there has been a breach of good\n\nfaith and fair dealing is a factual issue, generally inappropriate for decision as a matter of\n\nlaw.” Blakely v. USAA Cas. Ins. Co., 500 F. App’x 734, 739 (10th Cir. 2012)\n\n(unpublished) (alteration in original) (quoting Oman v. Davis Sch.

Although\n\nthe trial court’s statement that Allstate “acted diligently, reasonably, fairly and promptly\n\nin denying [Mr. Wheeler]’s claim” tracks the language used to describe insurers’ duties\n\nunder Utah law, see Prince, 56 P.3d at 533, Mr. Wheeler correctly notes that the court did\n\nnot specifically discuss the parties’ evidence on the issues of diligent investigation and\n\nfair evaluation. Rather, the trial court appears to have based its determination that\n\nAllstate’s actions were reasonable largely on its prior conclusion that Mr. Wheeler’s loss\n\nplainly falls under Exclusion 3 of the Policy. But because we have rejected that rationale,\n\nand considering the evidence in the light most favorable to Mr. Wheeler, we cannot say\n\nthat no reasonable juror could find Allstate failed to diligently investigate and fairly\n\nevaluate whether any damage in Mr. Wheeler’s cabin was covered. See Jones v. Farmers\n\nIns. Exch., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">286</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 303–06 (Utah 2012).\n\n       To that end, Mr. Wheeler presented testimony from an insurance expert opining\n\nthat Allstate acted unreasonably in approaching Mr. Wheeler’s claim “from a position of\n\nprematurely denying coverage.” Mr. Wheeler’s evidence also showed that Allstate’s\n\n                                              31\n\finvestigating adjuster “spent ‘ten minutes tops’ at the cabin and ‘took like two or three\n\npictures and left.’” Allstate, on the other hand, presented the adjuster’s report and the\n\nrebuttal testimony of its own insurance expert, both of which support its claim that it\n\nacted reasonably. In short, the evidence concerning the reasonableness of Allstate’s\n\nactions was disputed.\n\n       That said, we must next consider whether summary judgment was nonetheless\n\nappropriate because, as Allstate argues, Mr. Wheeler’s claim was “fairly debatable.”9\n\nUnder Utah law, “when an insured’s claim is fairly debatable, the insurer is entitled to\n\ndebate it and cannot be held to have breached the implied covenant [of good faith and fair\n\ndealing] if it chooses to do so.” Billings, 918 P.2d at 465. In other words, “as long as the\n\nappropriateness of coverage was ‘fairly debatable at the time it was denied,’ an insurer\n\ndoes not breach the duty of good faith simply because a court later determines the insurer\n\nwrongly denied coverage.” Blakely, 500 F. App’x at 738 (quoting Billings, 918 P.2d\n\nat 465).\n\n       Allstate asserts that the “fairly debatable” defense bars Mr. Wheeler’s bad faith\n\nclaim because, at the very least, the evidence presented here “create[s] a factual issue as\n\nto the validity of [Mr. Wheeler]’s water loss claim.” See also Prince, 56 P.3d at 535 (“[I]f\n\nthe evidence presented creates a factual issue as to the claim’s validity, there exists a\n\ndebatable reason for denial, . . . eliminating the bad faith claim.” (alteration in original)\n\n\n\n\n       9\n        Although Allstate argued this “fairly debatable” rationale below, the trial court’s\norder did not address it.\n                                              32\n\f(internal quotation marks omitted)). But Allstate misapprehends the Utah precedent\n\naddressing the fairly-debatable defense.\n\n       In Jones v. Farmers Insurance Exchange, the Utah Supreme Court admonished\n\nthat the factual-issue-as-to-the-claim’s-validity standard for demonstrating that an\n\ninsurance claim is “fairly debatable” must be strictly applied at the summary judgment\n\nstage. See 286 P.3d at 304. Jones involved a plaintiff who submitted a claim to his insurer\n\nseeking $14,000 in dental treatment for an injury allegedly sustained in a car crash that\n\noccurred four years earlier. Id. at 302–03. The plaintiff’s dentist sent the insurer a report\n\nin which the dentist attributed the plaintiff’s injury (cracked teeth) to the car crash. Id.\n\nThe insurer, after noting that the plaintiff’s emergency-room report showed no facial\n\ntrauma at the time of the accident and that the insurer “would have expected multiple\n\nfractured teeth to cause some pain or discomfort during the 4 years,” denied the claim. Id.\n\nat 303. The plaintiff sued, and the insurer moved for summary judgment on the plaintiff’s\n\nbad faith cause of action, arguing that the plaintiff’s insurance claim was fairly debatable.\n\nId. The trial court granted the insurer’s motion, but the Utah Supreme Court reversed.\n\n       The court cautioned that the fairly-debatable defense is all but precluded on\n\nsummary judgment where the alleged factual dispute as to coverage is premised not on\n\nconflicting evidence, but on the quality of the insured’s claim, which by extension\n\nimplicates the insurer’s reasonableness in denying coverage. See id. at 304–05. In such\n\nsituations, summary judgment is proper only where “reasonable minds could not differ as\n\nto whether the insurer’s conduct measured up to the required standard of care.” Id. at 305.\n\nThe Utah Supreme Court explained that to justify application of the fairly-debatable\n\n                                              33\n\fdefense at the summary judgment stage, there must be a legitimate factual dispute on\n\nwhich coverage under the insurance policy hinges and on which the insurer actually\n\npossessed conflicting evidence when it denied the claim. See id. at 305–06. The Jones\n\ncourt identified Prince and Callioux v. Progressive Insurance Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1305381\"><a href=\"/opinion/1305381/callioux-v-progressive-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">745</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">838</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Utah\n\nCt. App. 1987), as cases in point.\n\n       Comparing the facts of these cases to the facts here, we do not believe Mr.\n\nWheeler’s insurance claim was “fairly debatable” as a matter of law, so as to justify\n\nsummary judgment on the bad faith claim. While we agree with Allstate that coverage\n\nunder the policy hinges on a genuine dispute of fact on which the parties have submitted\n\nevidence, none of that evidence was in hand at the time the claim was denied. Thus,\n\nunlike the insurers in Prince and Callioux, both of which denied insureds’ claims after\n\nreceiving expert reports indicating there was no coverage, see Prince, 56 P.3d at 529;\n\nCallioux, 745 P.2d at 839, 842, Allstate did not have any objective evidence indicating\n\nthere was no coverage at the time it denied the claim. Thus, Jones instructs that summary\n\njudgment is not appropriate unless “reasonable minds could not differ” on whether\n\nAllstate complied with its duties of diligent investigation, fair evaluation, and reasonable\n\nand prompt disposition. 286 P.3d at 305. And as discussed above, we cannot conclude the\n\nevidence on these questions is so lopsided that they may be determined as a matter of\n\nlaw.\n\n\n\n\n                                             34\n\f                                 IV. CONCLUSION\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the trial court’s order granting summary\n\njudgment for Allstate and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                            Entered for the Court\n\n\n                                            Carolyn B. McHugh\n                                            Circuit Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                           35\n\f15-4159, Wheeler v. Allstate Insurance Company, et al.\n\nMORITZ, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n       I read Wheeler’s opening brief to raise a single challenge to the district court’s\n\nruling that the Policy doesn’t cover the short-term damage to the cabin: Wheeler\n\nasserts that the district court erred in overlooking a genuine dispute of material fact.\n\nIn support, Wheeler points to his expert’s opinion that “the water damage to walls,\n\ncabinets, and other water[-] absorbing materials was beyond repair within less than a\n\nweek.” Aplt. App. 143. And in light of this evidence, Wheeler argues, the district\n\ncourt erred when it concluded that it was impossible “to determine exactly what\n\namount of damage would have occurred in the first few hours and days” of the leak.\n\nId. at 153.\n\n       Wheeler is correct that the district court erred when it suggested a reasonable\n\njury would be unable to attribute at least some of the damage to the first 13 days of\n\nthe leak. But as I read the district court’s order, this erroneous factual finding is only\n\none of the two independent bases the district court provided for granting Allstate’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment. And while I agree with the majority that Wheeler\n\nsuccessfully challenges the first of these two independent bases for the district\n\ncourt’s ruling, I would find that Wheeler fails to acknowledge—let alone challenge—\n\nthe second.\n\n       In granting Allstate’s motion for summary judgment, the district court began\n\nby framing the question before it as whether the Policy “should cover any of the\n\ndamage to [the] cabin.” Aplt. App. 137 (emphasis added). The district court then\n\fclarified its understanding of Wheeler’s position, stating, “[Wheeler] is only seeking\n\nrelief for the [short-term] damage” to the cabin. Id. at 145. Based on this language, it\n\nis clear that the district court understood Wheeler to be arguing that Exclusion 3\n\ndoesn’t apply to damage that occurs within the first 13 days of a leak if that leak\n\nultimately persists for 14 days or more.\n\n       Critically, the district court then explicitly (and repeatedly) rejected this\n\ninterpretation of Exclusion 3 as a matter of law. For instance, the court stated that it\n\n“disagree[d] with [Wheeler’s] attempt to persuade the [c]ourt to construe the\n\nlanguage [of Exclusion 3] in a more subtle, fine-tuned manner that favors . . .\n\nrecovery and ignores the contract’s plain language.” Id. at 146. And it ruled that\n\nExclusion 3 isn’t “fairly susceptible to the interpretation [Wheeler] suggest[ed].” Id.\n\nat 148. In other words, the district court unambiguously ruled that when a leak lasts\n\n14 days or more, Exclusion 3 applies to all of the damage the leak causes—even the\n\ndamage that occurs within the first 13 days: the district court stated, “The policy\n\nlanguage works to preclude coverage for exactly the type of damage that occurred in\n\nthis case . . . .” Id. at 153.\n\n       The majority correctly points out that the district court also stated that it found\n\nit “difficult if not impossible . . . to determine exactly what amount of damage would\n\nhave occurred in the first few hours and days” of the leak. Maj. Op. 10 (quoting Aplt.\n\nApp. 153). But in my opinion, the district court made it clear that this factual finding\n\nconstituted an alternative basis for its ruling that Wheeler isn’t entitled to coverage.\n\nSee Aplt. App. 153 (reiterating that “[i]n addition” to its factual finding, the district\n\n                                             2\n\fcourt was also granting Allstate’s motion based on its independent legal conclusion\n\nthat Exclusion 3 applies to all damage—including short-term damage—that occurs\n\nwhen a leak ultimately lasts 14 days or more (emphasis added)).\n\n      Thus, I read the district court’s order to provide two independent bases for\n\ngranting Allstate’s motion for summary judgment: (1) a reasonable jury would be\n\nunable to discern what damage occurred within the first 13 days of the leak, and\n\n(2) even assuming that a reasonable jury could make such a factual finding,\n\nExclusion 3 would nevertheless unambiguously operate to preclude coverage for the\n\nshort-term damage.\n\n      But Wheeler doesn’t even acknowledge this second aspect of the district\n\ncourt’s ruling in his opening brief, let alone attempt to challenge it.1 Accordingly,\n\n\n      1\n         The majority opinion nevertheless undertakes an analysis of the district\ncourt’s legal conclusion that Exclusion 3 doesn’t apply to short-term damage when a\nleak lasts at least 14 days. For instance, the majority reasons that any damage that\noccurs within the first 13 days of such a leak isn’t “caused by leakage over a period\nof 14 days or longer.” Maj. Op. 20. And the majority addresses and attempts to\ndistinguish the cases the district court relied on in rejecting Wheeler’s assertion that\nExclusion 3 doesn’t apply to short-term damage caused by a leak that ultimately lasts\nat least 14 days. See id. at 20-23.\n       As discussed below, see infra at 5-6, I disagree with the majority’s\ninterpretation of Exclusion 3, see Maj. Op. 20. But more significantly, I disagree with\nthe majority’s decision to reach that interpretation (and to ultimately reverse the\ndistrict court’s decision) based on an analysis that doesn’t appear anywhere in\nWheeler’s opening brief. When an appellant fails to “explain what was wrong with\nthe reasoning that the district court relied on in reaching its decision,” we typically\ndecline to do that work on the appellant’s behalf.

Exclusion 3 applies to property loss\n\n“caused by . . . [s]eepage, meaning continuous or repeated seepage or leakage [of\n\nwater] over a period of weeks, months, or years.” Aplee. App. 312-13 (emphasis\n\nadded). This language unambiguously encompasses damage that occurs at any time\n\n\nraised, or are inadequately presented”).

Instead, because Wheeler seeks coverage for\n\nproperty loss caused by a leak that unquestionably occurred “over a period” of two\n\nweeks or more, I would hold that Exclusion 3 unambiguously applies to all of the damage\n\nthe leak caused, including the damage that occurred during the first 13 days of the multi-\n\nweek “period” during which the leak ultimately persisted.
