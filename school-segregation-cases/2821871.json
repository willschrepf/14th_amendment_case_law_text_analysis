We hope that this\r<br><br>            opinion will  bring the matter  to a close,  for a decade  of\r<br><br>            litigation about a single, narrow event is enough.\r<br><br>                                         I.\r<br><br>                 The case  began  in February  1988 when  Walter  Biggins\r<br><br>            brought suit in district  court against his former  employer,\r<br><br>            Hazen \r                 Paper \r                       Company, and its two principals, Robert Hazen, the\r<br><br>            president, and his cousin, Thomas Hazen, the treasurer.   The\r<br><br>            company \r                   is \r                      a \r                        small but successful maker of specialty papers of\r<br><br>            various \r                   kinds.  Biggins joined the company in 1977, at age 52,\r<br><br>            and \r               served \r                      as its technical director for about nine years.  He\r<br><br>            had no written employment contract.\r<br><br>                 During his employ,  Biggins developed a superior  water-\r<br><br>            based paper coating  that increased the company's sales.   He\r<br><br>            sought a  larger  salary, was  given  a small  increase,  but\r<br><br>            remained unsatisfied and sought a further increase.   Biggins\r<br><br>            later  claimed that  in 1984  Thomas Hazen  had promised  him\r<br><br>            company stock instead of a further raise; Thomas Hazen denied\r<br><br>            making any such promise.\r<br><br>                 Biggins, during  his  employ by  the company,  was  also\r<br><br>            involved \r                    in \r                       two different ventures with his sons.  When Thomas\r<br><br><br><br>                                         -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            Hazen learned of this, he sought a confidentiality  agreement\r<br><br>            from Biggins, limiting his outside activities during, and for\r<br><br>            a \r             limited \r                     time \r                         after, \r                                his employment with the company.  Biggins\r<br><br>            refused to sign, except in exchange for the stock he said had\r<br><br>            been promised.  He  was discharged in June 1986--a few  weeks\r<br><br>            before  his  rights under  the  company  pension  plan  would\r<br><br>            otherwise have vested.\r<br><br>                 Biggins then  sued  the company  and the  Hazen  cousins\r<br><br>            (collectively \"the Hazens\") in an eight-count complaint.  The\r<br><br>            first two counts charged  the Hazens with age  discrimination\r<br><br>            under the  ADEA and  interference with  pension rights  under\r<br><br>            ERISA.1  The remaining claims, of limited importance to  this\r<br><br>            appeal (except  for the  contract claim),  were for  wrongful\r<br><br>            deprivation \r                       of \r                         property, \r                                   wrongful discharge, fraud, conversion,\r<br><br>            breach of contract and  violation of the Massachusetts  Civil\r<br><br>            Rights Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, SS 11H and 11I.\r<br><br>                 In \r                   substance, Biggins claimed under the first two counts,\r<br><br>            respectively,\r                         that he had been fired on account of his age--he\r<br><br>            was \r               replaced \r                        with a younger man--and to prevent the vesting of\r<br><br>            his \r               pension. \r                         \r                        In \r                           additional counts, he also sought the value of\r<br><br>            the \r               stock \r                    allegedly \r                              promised by Thomas Hazen and the benefit of\r<br><br>            the \r               paper-coating formula and method, which Biggins claimed to\r<br><br>            own. \r                 \r                 The \r                    gravamen \r                             of \r                                the remaining counts was that he had been\r<br><br><br><br>              \r              \r               \r                \r                 \r                  \r                   \r                    \r                     \r                     1ADEA \r                          is \r                             the \r                                 Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29\r<br>            U.S.C. S  621, et seq. and  ERISA is the Employee  Retirement\r<br>            Income Security Act, 29 U.S.C. S 1001 et seq.\r<br><br>                                         -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            wrongfully \r                      discharged in violation of various rights protected\r<br><br>            under state law.\r<br><br>                 In  its verdict,  the  jury  largely  accepted  Biggins'\r<br><br>            position, apart from  his claim to ownership of the  formula,\r<br><br>            which it rejected.  On  the ADEA claim, the jury awarded  him\r<br><br>            around $560,000; the ERISA award was $100,000, later adjusted\r<br><br>            downward to  $93,000 on  appeal.   The  fraud award  for  the\r<br><br>            allegedly \r                     promised stock was about $315,000.  Biggins was also\r<br><br>            awarded just  under $267,000  for discharge  in violation  of\r<br><br>            contract.   On two other  counts, only  nominal damages  were\r<br><br>            awarded.\r<br><br>                 Because the jury found  that the age discrimination  was\r<br><br>            willful, the award on the ADEA count would normally have been\r<br><br>            doubled, \r                    see\r                        \r                       29 \r                          U.S.C. \r                                 S \r                                   626(b), but the district court granted\r<br><br>            judgment  n.o.v. in  favor  of the  Hazens  on the  issue  of\r<br><br>            willfulness. \r                         In other respects, the district court upheld the\r<br><br>            jury verdict against various post-trial motions.  We  reserve\r<br><br>            for later discussion the issue of attorney's fees, which  the\r<br><br>            district court also addressed.\r<br><br>                 On appeal, a  panel of this court affirmed the  district\r<br><br>            court \r                 with \r                     several \r                             exceptions.  Biggins v. Hazen Paper Co., 953\r<br><br>            F.2d \r                1405 \r                     (1st Cir. 1992).  Two are pertinent here: first, the\r<br><br>            panel found  that the evidence  on the  ADEA count  supported\r<br><br>            damages \r                   (before \r                          doubling) of only about $420,000, but the panel\r<br><br>            also \r                reinstated \r                          the \r                              willfulness finding and doubled the reduced\r<br><br><br><br>                                         -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            award to about $840,000.  Id. at 1416.  Second, the panel set\r<br><br>            aside the  contract  claim  verdict for  lack  of  sufficient\r<br><br>            evidence to establish a contract.  Id. at 1421-24.    \r<br><br>                 The \r                    Supreme \r                            Court then granted certiorari and vacated the\r<br><br>            panel \r                 decision on the ADEA count.  Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins,\r<br><br>            507 U.S. 604 (1993).  The Court held that the panel had  been\r<br><br>            mistaken in relying  upon the ERISA  violation to supply  the\r<br><br>            wrongful motive for the ADEA violation; it said that pensions\r<br><br>            might \r                 often \r                       correlate with age but a firing to prevent pension\r<br><br>            vesting \r                   did \r                       not itself amount to a firing based upon age.  Id.\r<br><br>            at 611-13.\r<br><br>                 The  Supreme Court  remanded the  case to  the panel  to\r<br><br>            reconsider \r                      whether the jury had sufficient evidence to find an\r<br><br>            ADEA violation once the ERISA violation was put to one  side.\r<br><br>            507 U.S. at 614.  On remand, the original panel  reconsidered\r<br><br>            the \r               ADEA \r                    claim.

The\r<br><br>            arguments  that  the remand  was  unlawful  or  unsound  were\r<br><br>            presented to the en  banc court in a petition for  rehearing,\r<br><br>            rejected \r                    there, \r                           and \r                              then \r                                   presented in a petition for certiorari\r<br><br>            which the Supreme Court denied.

See United States v. DeJesus,\r<br><br>            752 F.2d 640, 642-43 (1st Cir. 1985).\r<br><br>                 Nevertheless, it may be helpful to explain why  Biggins'\r<br><br>            arguments  relating to  authority of  the en  banc court  are\r<br><br>            mistaken. \r                      \r                     His \r                         constitutional argument amounts to this:  first,\r<br><br>            the  Seventh  Amendment  prohibits  any  federal  court  from\r<br><br>            reexamining jury findings \"otherwise . . . than according  to\r<br><br>            the \r               rules \r                     of \r                        common law\"; and second, in Biggins' view, the en\r<br><br>            banc court's new trial order overturned the jury findings  of\r<br><br>            age  discrimination--without   any  identified  legal   error\r<br><br>            committed by the district court.\r<br><br>                 This \r                     last \r                         qualification \r                                       is critical.  Where there is legal\r<br><br>            error, appeals courts often overturn jury verdicts, and order\r<br><br>            new \r               trials \r                      or even dismissal.  This occurs, for example, where\r<br><br>            evidence \r                    has \r                       been \r                            wrongly admitted, or where an instruction was\r<br><br>            mistaken,  or  even  where the  evidence  did  not  permit  a\r<br><br>            reasonable jury to reach the verdict rendered.

The court's appraisal, as noted\r<br><br>            earlier, was that the jury was potentially misled by the same\r<br><br>            error that the  Supreme Court identified  in the first  panel\r<br><br><br><br>                                         -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            decision, namely, a belief that the wrongful motive  (pension\r<br><br>            interference) that gave rise to an ERISA violation by  itself\r<br><br>            constituted \r                       wrongful motive under ADEA.  Whether or not the en\r<br><br>            banc\r                \r                court's \r                        assessment of prejudice was invincibly supported,\r<br><br>            the \r               en \r                  banc \r                       court was free under the Seventh Amendment to make\r<br><br>            that judgment.2\r<br><br>                 Biggins' \r                         other challenge to the en banc court's authority\r<br><br>            is also wide of  the mark.  He  argues that when the  Supreme\r<br><br>            Court \r                 remanded the case to this court, it precluded this court\r<br><br>            from taking  any action other than  an up-or-down vote as  to\r<br><br>            whether enough evidence remained to support the ADEA verdict.\r<br><br>            Therefore, says Biggins,  the en banc court has violated  the\r<br><br>            Supreme Court's mandate.   \r<br><br>                 Of course, a higher  court's mandate must be  respected,\r<br><br>            Sprague v. Ticonic Nat'l Bank, 307 U.S. 161, 168 (1939),  but\r<br><br>            the issue here is the scope of the mandate.  Where as  here a\r<br><br>            judgment is vacated and the matter remanded, Hazen Paper Co.,\r<br><br>            507 U.S. at 617, the lower court must undo the judgment  just\r<br><br>            vacated and  cannot normally revisit  a legal issue  actually\r<br><br>            decided \r                   by \r                      the reviewing court.  But after that, the situation\r<br><br>            is less rigid than Biggins assumes.\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>                      2The concern did not come out of the blue.  Biggins\r<br>            had relied in  his complaint upon the deprivation of  pension\r<br>            benefits \r                    as \r                       an act of age discrimination and had made the same\r<br>            argument on appeal.\r<br><br><br>                                         -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                 On remand, courts are often confronted with issues  that\r<br><br>            were never considered by the remanding court.  And\r<br><br>                           the   mandate  of   an  appellate   court\r<br>                 forecloses  the  lower  court  from   reconsidering\r<br>                 matters  determined  in  the  appellate  court,  it\r<br>                 `leaves \r                        to \r                           the [lower] court any issue not expressly\r<br>                 or \r                   impliedly \r                             disposed of on appeal.'

Whether  this judgment was right  or\r<br><br>            wrong--and we cannot revisit it--the contamination issue  had\r<br><br>            certainly not been addressed in the Supreme Court's  opinion.\r<br><br>            And when Biggins made his mandate argument on certiorari, the\r<br><br>            Supreme Court denied the petition.\r<br><br>                                        III.\r<br><br>                 The \r                    next \r                         claim of error presents the most difficult issue\r<br><br>            in the case.

Biggins claimed that the first trial  had\r<br><br>            determined \r                      that \r                           he \r                             had \r                                 been promised the stock in 1984 and that\r<br><br>            the \r               company \r                       had been found liable for fraud in withholding the\r<br><br>            stock.\r<br><br>                 The district judge rejected both in limine motions after\r<br><br>            an \r              oral \r                   hearing, expressing some doubt but concluding that the\r<br><br>            en \r              banc \r                   court had intended a full new trial on the ADEA count.\r<br><br>            The \r               judge \r                     said (and Biggins readily agreed) that it could make\r<br><br>            the new  trial an empty  gesture if the  jury were told  that\r<br><br>            Biggins \r                   was \r                       an \r                         innocent \r                                  victim who had been fired by the Hazens\r<br><br>            as  part of  an effort  to defraud  Biggins.

But the limitations  have\r<br><br>            been slowly diluted  over time and most are irrelevant  here.\r<br><br>            Nor do the Hazens dispute  that the jury verdict in favor  of\r<br><br>            Biggins at the  first trial is now  final except on the  ADEA\r<br><br>            count.\r<br><br>                 The \r                    Hazens' \r                            main argument against collateral estoppel has\r<br><br>            been \r                that \r                     the \"issues\" in the two cases were different because\r<br><br>            nothing in the first trial validly determined that the Hazens\r<br><br>            had \r               been \r                    motivated by age in firing Biggins (since the Supreme\r<br><br>            Court had vacated this claim).   This won't wash.  True,  age\r<br><br>            motivation is usually the ultimate issue under the ADEA;  but\r<br><br>            collateral estoppel is no longer limited to ultimate  issues:\r<br><br>            necessary intermediate findings can  now be used to  preclude\r<br><br>            relitigation.\r                          Grella v. Salem Five Cent Savings Bank, 42 F.3d\r<br><br>            26, 30-31 (1st Cir. 1994); Restatement (Second), Judgments  S\r<br><br>            27, comment j. (1982).\r<br><br>                 Often \r                      it \r                         is \r                           very \r                                difficult to prove that the initial trial\r<br><br>            necessarily decided an intermediate issue.  But in this  case\r<br><br>            the special verdict  form and reasonable inference  indicates\r<br><br>            that several \"facts\"  were determined by  the jury on  counts\r<br><br><br><br>                                        -11-\r                                        -11-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            other \r                 than \r                      ADEA: \r                           (1) \r                               that Biggins was fired, (2) that the stock\r<br><br>            had been promised to him, and  (3) that (in the words of  the\r<br><br>            verdict form) \"defendants wrongfully discharged plaintiff  in\r<br><br>            order to deprive plaintiff of the promised stock compensation\r<br><br>            . . . .\"\r<br><br>                 At \r                   the \r                       new \r                          trial, \r                                 the \r                                     jury was instructed that Biggins had\r<br><br>            been  fired, so that is out of  the case.  But on the  second\r<br><br>            issue Biggins says  that the Hazens relitigated the issue  of\r<br><br>            whether \r                   they \r                       had \r                           promised him stock, and that appears to be the\r<br><br>            case.   A  good  argument can  be  made that  under  standard\r<br><br>            collateral estoppel doctrine, the Hazens should not have been\r<br><br>            allowed \r                   to \r                      relitigate the issue whether \"in fact\" Thomas Hazen\r<br><br>            had promised the stock  to Biggins, a point about which  both\r<br><br>            Biggins and Hazen told largely inconsistent stories.\r<br><br>                 Yet \r                    if \r                       there \r                            was \r                                error, \r                                       we regard it as harmless.  Whether\r<br><br>            the stock was  promised has little relevance to the  question\r<br><br>            whether the  Hazens engaged in  age discrimination when  they\r<br><br>            fired Biggins.   Biggins argues that the Hazens purported  to\r<br><br>            fire him  because  he  refused to  sign  the  confidentiality\r<br><br>            agreement \r                     and \r                        therefore\r                                  \r                                  the stock promise was relevant, Biggins\r<br><br>            having \r                  offered \r                          to \r                            sign \r                                 in exchange for the promised stock.  But\r<br><br>            Biggins' \r                    refusal to sign does not vanish as a plausible motive\r<br><br>            for the  Hazens,  regardless  of whether  stock  was  wrongly\r<br><br>            withheld.\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>                                        -12-\r                                        -12-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                 Obviously  the Hazens  wanted to  relitigate the  stock-\r<br><br>            promise issue, and Biggins to foreclose relitigation, because\r<br><br>            the Hazens look  worse--from the standpoint of  character--if\r<br><br>            they were welshing on a promise and Biggins looks worse if he\r<br><br>            were making  new  demands.   But  character evidence  is  not\r<br><br>            normally admissible  to show conformity  therewith.  Fed.  R.\r<br><br>            Evid. \r                 404(a).  Thus, the permissible use of the evidence about\r<br><br>            the promise  was very limited  so far as  the ADEA claim  was\r<br><br>            concerned; properly used,  it added  useful context,  nothing\r<br><br>            more.\r<br><br>                 Turning to the third \"fact\" in issue, we reject Biggins'\r<br><br>            claim  that the jury  should have been  told that the  Hazens\r<br><br>            fraudulently discharged Biggins  to deprive  him of  promised\r<br><br>            stock. \r                   \r                   How \r                      such \r                           an \r                              instruction would be understood is unclear:\r<br><br>            the Hazens say that (by supplying a different motive) it cuts\r<br><br>            against Biggins'  current  claim that  he was  discharged  on\r<br><br>            account \r                   of \r                      age; \r                          on \r                             the \r                                 other hand, Biggins would obviously have\r<br><br>            liked the  new jury to hear  the terms \"fraud\" and  \"wrongful\r<br><br>            discharge\" as a dual motive.\r<br><br>                 The \r                    problem \r                            the \r                               jury \r                                    confronted on retrial was to sort out\r<br><br>            any age discrimination motive in the tangle of other possible\r<br><br>            motivations,  including  perceived  disloyalty,  compensation\r<br><br>            quarrels, and the like.  We think that it would badly distort\r<br><br>            matters to tell the jury  that in carrying out this task,  it\r<br><br>            must accept that the Hazens' motivation in firing Biggins was\r<br><br><br><br>                                        -13-\r                                        -13-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            wrongful or fraudulent.   The glare from such an  instruction\r<br><br>            would distort any effort to distinguish shadows or shades  in\r<br><br>            the Hazens' actual motivation.  See Fed. R. Evid. 403.4\r<br><br>                 In \r                   sum, \r                        there was no prejudicial error in this challenged\r<br><br>            refusal \r                   to \r                      apply collateral estoppel.  We thus need not decide\r<br><br>            whether, even on  the opposite assumption, it would make  any\r<br><br>            sense to reverse here.   After all, the issues have now  been\r<br><br>            relitigated, collateral estoppel  is a  doctrine of  judicial\r<br><br>            economy, \r                    and \r                        one \r                           might \r                                 wonder whether--assuming no other error-\r<br><br>            -such \r                 an \r                    objective would be served by a third trial.

There is no indication from the special verdict that  the\r<br>          first jury made a generic finding of \"loyalty.\"\r<br><br>                                        -14-\r                                        -14-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                 Biggins' \r                         strongest \r                                  claim \r                                        of error, which we do address, is\r<br><br>            that \r                the \r                    district court on retrial erred by excluding evidence\r<br><br>            of \r              his \r                  pension \r                         status \r                                and the Hazens' effort to deprive Biggins\r<br><br>            of  his unvested  pension  plan  benefits  upon  termination.\r<br><br>            Biggins \r                   says \r                       that \r                            without this information, the jury was misled\r<br><br>            by the  Hazens' effort  at the  second trial  to portray  the\r<br><br>            company \r                   as \r                      a \r                       generous \r                                employer willing to provide such benefits\r<br><br>            for Biggins.\r<br><br>                 The \r                    Hazens \r                           argue \r                                that \r                                     the attempted pension termination is\r<br><br>            irrelevant: \r                       they \r                           say \r                               that Biggins can collect only once for the\r<br><br>            wrongful  termination  of his  pension,  and  this  loss  was\r<br><br>            compensated \r                       by the earlier award on the ERISA count.  But that\r<br><br>            is  beside the point:   facts underlying  one claim could  be\r<br><br>            pertinent to  a different  claim, regardless  of whether  the\r<br><br>            former \r                  claim \r                        had been satisfied.  Still, the Hazens also argue\r<br><br>            that \r                in \r                   this \r                        instance the Supreme Court expressly decided that\r<br><br>            interference with pension vesting is not age discrimination.\r<br><br>                 Actually, \r                          the Supreme Court reserved the possibility that\r<br><br>            pension  evidence might  occasionally be  relevant where  the\r<br><br>            employer is shown consciously  to equate pension status  with\r<br><br>            age, Hazen Paper  Co., 507 U.S. at  612-613; but that is  not\r<br><br>            Biggins' argument here.  Rather, what Biggins wanted the jury\r<br><br>            to infer from  the pension interference  finding is that  the\r<br><br>            Hazens are  not as nice as they claim to be.  Again, this  is\r<br><br>            largely \r                   forbidden character evidence, although the trial court\r<br><br><br><br>                                        -15-\r                                        -15-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            has some latitude since  the evidence can also be treated  as\r<br><br>            context.\r<br><br>                 Still,  in regard  to  age discrimination,  the  Hazens'\r<br><br>            generosity vel  non  is at  best  marginally relevant.    The\r<br><br>            district  court had every  reason to worry,  in light of  the\r<br><br>            Supreme Court and en banc decisions, that undue attention  to\r<br><br>            pension termination would prompt yet another reversal.   Even\r<br><br>            if \r              some \r                   narrow \r                         path \r                              could have been followed--e.g., by limiting\r<br><br>            instructions--the district court was within its discretion in\r<br><br>            declining to do so.   See United States v. Houlihan, 92  F.3d\r<br><br>            1297 (1st Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 963 (1997).\r<br><br>                 Biggins' other claim relates to his post-verdict motion.\r<br><br>            Following the second trial, Biggins filed a motion to  reopen\r<br><br>            the adverse judgment on the contract claim, relying upon Fed.\r<br><br>            R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6), which permits the court to undo a  final\r<br><br>            judgment.    His  claim was  that  a  recent  state  decision\r<br><br>            undermined \r                      the \r                         panel's \r                                 earlier rejection of the contract claim.\r<br><br>            The district court denied the motion.\r<br><br>                 To understand this Rule 60(b) claim, one must return  to\r<br><br>            the \r               original \r                       proceedings.  In the first trial, the jury awarded\r<br><br>            Biggins \r                   about \r                        $267,000 \r                                 on his breach of contract claim; Biggins\r<br><br>            claimed that the  company's \"employee  handbook\" comprised  a\r<br><br>            contract  under  Jackson  v.  Action  for  Boston   Community\r<br><br>            Development, Inc.,  525  N.E.2d 411  (Mass. 1988),  and  that\r<br><br>            protections it afforded against discharge had been denied  to\r<br><br><br><br>                                        -16-\r                                        -16-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            him.   Jackson had  held that \"on  proper proof, a  personnel\r<br><br>            manual can be shown to form the basis of [such] an express or\r<br><br>            implied contract.\"  525 N.E.2d at 414.  \r<br><br>                 On the first  appeal, the panel  set aside the  contract\r<br><br>            claim award.  The panel noted that there was no evidence that\r<br><br>            the  handbook  had  been  incorporated  into  a  contract  by\r<br><br>            negotiation or that either Biggins or the company had treated\r<br><br>            the handbook as a contract  between them.  953 F.2d at  1423.\r<br><br>            The \r               panel \r                     held that a judgment n.o.v. should have been granted\r<br><br>            and \r               vacated \r                       the \r                          award. \r                                  \r                                  That disposition, like the several jury\r<br><br>            awards to  Biggins that were  not further  challenged by  the\r<br><br>            Hazens, became final.\r<br><br>                 In the  Rule 60(b) motion,  Biggins argued  that a  more\r<br><br>            recent decision of the state's highest court, O'Brien v.  New\r<br><br>            England Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, 664 N.E.2d 843  (Mass.\r<br><br>            1996), conflicts  with the panel's  earlier treatment of  the\r<br><br>            contract \r                    issue in 1992.  We agree that the panel's disposition\r<br><br>            of the contract  claim might have been different had  O'Brien\r<br><br>            been \r                decided \r                        earlier: \r                                 \r                                 its tone and language are more favorable\r<br><br>            to such  recoveries than Jackson.   While there is no  direct\r<br><br>            contradiction, O'Brien is  a gradual  extension of  precedent\r<br><br>            (Jackson\r                    \r                    was \r                       itself \r                              an \r                                 extension of an earlier case) typical of\r<br><br>            common-law jurisprudence.  \r<br><br>                 Yet the case law is  very hostile to using a mistake  of\r<br><br>            state \r                 law, \r                      still less a change in state common law, as grounds\r<br><br><br><br>                                        -17-\r                                        -17-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            for a motion to reopen a final judgment under Rule  60(b)(6).\r<br><br>              though                               cf. Polites v.  United\r<br><br>            States\r                 , \r                   364 \r                       U.S. 426, 433 (1960), there is good sense--as well\r<br><br>            as much precedent--to make this the rarest of possibilities.5\r            Al       the door is not quite closed, \r<br><br>            Decisions constantly  are  being  made by  judges  which,  if\r<br><br>            reassessed in light of later precedent, might have been  made\r<br><br>            differently; but a final judgment normally ends the quarrel.\r<br><br>                 Indeed, the common  law could not safely develop if  the\r<br><br>            latest \r                  evolution in doctrine became the standard for measuring\r<br><br>            previously \r                      resolved \r                              claims.  The finality of judgments protects\r<br><br>            against \r                   this \r                        kind of retroactive lawmaking.  Admittedly, there\r<br><br>            is some arbitrariness  (e.g., \"new law\"  is applied in  cases\r<br><br>            still \r                 on \r                    direct \r                          appeal); \r                                   but, by the same token, Jackson itself\r<br><br>            had not been decided  when the Hazens first handed out  their\r<br><br>            employee handbook.\r<br><br>                 Biggins says that the abuse of discretion standard under\r<br><br>            Rule 60(b) should not shield the district court in this case,\r<br><br>            since  that  court may  have  thought  itself  disabled  from\r<br><br>            reconsidering the panel's holding on the contract award.  But\r<br><br>            absent extraordinary circumstances, we would think it dubious\r<br><br>            practice \r                    to \r                       reopen a final judgment under Rule 60(b)(6) solely\r<br><br>            because of later precedent pointing in a different direction.\r<br><br><br><br>              \r              \r               \r                \r                 \r                  \r                   \r                    \r                     \r                     5Se\r                        e, e.g., Batta v.

After  that trial, the  district court in  two\r<br><br>            stages \r                  awarded Biggins a total of about $207,000 in fees (plus\r<br><br>            costs), reflecting Biggins' success on both the ADEA and  the\r<br><br>            ERISA claims. \r<br><br>                 Attorney's \r                           fees \r                               are \r                                   mandatory for the successful plaintiff\r<br><br>            under the ADEA and  permissible under ERISA, see 29 U.S.C.

No such  fees\r<br><br>            were available  for the  common-law claims  on which  Biggins\r<br><br>            recovered substantial damages, namely, fraud and discharge in\r<br><br>            violation of contract.  The award for the two federal  claims\r<br><br>            was based upon straight time and upon hourly rates not now in\r<br><br>            issue.\r<br><br>                 After   the   first   panel   opinion,   Biggins--having\r<br><br>            successfully defended his  verdicts on both federal  claims--\r<br><br>            sought an additional  award of attorney's fees and costs  for\r<br><br>            appellate work.   In March  1992, the  panel awarded  Biggins\r<br><br>            additional fees of  just under $72,000.   There followed  the\r<br><br>            Supreme Court remand of  the ADEA claim and the second  panel\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>                                        -19-\r                                        -19-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            opinion where Biggins, again successful on that claim, sought\r<br><br>            further attorney's fees in November 1993.\r<br><br>                 However, \r                         in \r                            June 1994, the en banc court vacated the ADEA\r<br><br>            award, ordering a new trial.  In a companion order, the panel\r<br><br>            declined \r                    to \r                       award any additional fees for the first appeal, as\r<br><br>            sought by Biggins,  and said that  the remainder of  Biggins'\r<br><br>            application for additional fees had been rendered moot by the\r<br><br>            en banc order.  The case then returned to the district  court\r<br><br>            where the new trial occurred in April 1996.  \r<br><br>                 After \r                      the \r                          second \r                                trial, \r                                       Biggins sought to execute judgment\r<br><br>            on \r              the \r                  prior \r                        awards of attorney's fees (just over $207,000 for\r<br><br>            the \r               first \r                     trial \r                          and \r                              almost  $72,000 for the first appeal).  The\r<br><br>            Hazens, by contrast, moved under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5)  to\r<br><br>            reopen the  judgment and reduce  the previously awarded  fees\r<br><br>            because \r                   Biggins was no longer the prevailing party on the ADEA\r<br><br>            claim. \r                   \r                   In \r                     July \r                          1996, \r                                the district court resolved the matter in\r<br><br>            a detailed memorandum, pointing  out that he was  \"intimately\r<br><br>            familiar\" with the case.\r<br><br>                 The district judge  agreed with the Hazens that the  fee\r<br><br>            award resulting  from the first  trial should be  reexamined,\r<br><br>            since \r                 one \r                     predicate (the ADEA award) had now been undone.

But the\r<br><br>            district judge  disagreed  with  the Hazens  that  a  drastic\r<br><br>            reduction was warranted.   He concluded that subtracting  the\r<br><br><br><br>                                        -20-\r                                        -20-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            ADEA claim from the first trial would not have  substantially\r<br><br>            reduced \r                   the \r                       amount of time needed to prepare and try the ERISA\r<br><br>            claim on which Biggins had conclusively prevailed.  He  ruled\r<br><br>            that  a 20  percent reduction  was warranted  and awarded  80\r<br><br>            percent of the original $207,000 figure to cover the original\r<br><br>            trial.\r<br><br>                 The \r                    district \r                             court declined to alter the panel's award of\r<br><br>            almost $72,000 for the first appeal; that appeal, it will  be\r<br><br>            remembered, had resulted in affirmance of the ADEA and  ERISA\r<br><br>            awards, \r                   but \r                       the \r                          ADEA \r                               award had later been undone.  The district\r<br><br>            court \r                 said \r                      that this court had likely considered the matter of\r<br><br>            a \r             reduction \r                       when it remanded for a new trial, and in any case,\r<br><br>            that award was the court of appeals' business.\r<br><br>                 Accordingly, \r                             the \r                                district court entered a revised judgment\r<br><br>            covering \r                    the \r                        entire attorney's fees award in both courts.  The\r<br><br>            total is about $237,700, apart  from costs.  It is from  this\r<br><br>            judgment that the  Hazens have now cross-appealed,  objecting\r<br><br>            both \r                to \r                   the \r                      modesty \r                              of \r                                 the 20 percent reduction in the district\r<br><br>            court fee and the refusal to reduce at all the amount awarded\r<br><br>            by this court for appellate work.\r<br><br>                 The district  judge's refusal to  order more  than a  20\r<br><br>            percent reduction is easily sustained.  Most of this case has\r<br><br>            focused throughout on a central event, Biggins' firing, in an\r<br><br>            effort  to  appraise  the  Hazens'  reason  or  reasons;  but\r<br><br>            motivation had to be discerned through examination of several\r<br><br><br><br>                                        -21-\r                                        -21-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            controversies\r                         that had enveloped the parties and led up to the\r<br><br>            firing, including Biggins' other ventures and claim to  stock\r<br><br>            ownership.\r<br><br>                 A \r                  trial \r                        of \r                           the firing and related background events would\r<br><br>            have been  quite extensive,  and probably  pretty similar  in\r<br><br>            contour, even  if Biggins  had brought  only one  of the  two\r<br><br>            federal \r                   claims. \r                            \r                           Indeed, \r                                   the second trial was nominally limited\r<br><br>            to  the  ADEA  claim,  but  its  duration  and  breadth  were\r<br><br>            considerable.   The commonality  of issues  has already  been\r<br><br>            noted, in the Hazens' favor, sustaining their evidence as  to\r<br><br>            background matters in the second trial.\r<br><br>                 In \r                   all \r                       events, \r                              the \r                                  Hazens make no effort to show in detail\r<br><br>            that \r                the \r                    20 \r                      percent \r                              reduction understates the time savings from\r<br><br>            (hypothetically) eliminating the  ADEA claim  from the  first\r<br><br>            trial.  Instead, they rely mainly upon doctrine, namely, that\r<br><br>            where \r<br><br>                 a plaintiff has  achieved only  partial or  limited\r<br>                 success, \r                         the \r                             product of hours reasonably expended on\r<br>                 the litigation as a whole times a reasonable hourly\r<br>                 rate may be an  excessive amount. . . . even  where\r<br>                 the plaintiff's claims were interrelated . . . .  \r<br><br>            Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 436 (1983).  \r<br><br>                 We \r                   say \r                       \"mainly\" \r                               because \r                                       the Hazens also try to make use of\r<br><br>            Biggins' earlier attempt, in resisting a remand, to  minimize\r<br><br>            the importance of the ERISA claim in the first trial.  It  is\r<br><br>            true \r                that \r                     Biggins called the claim little more than \"a blip on\r<br><br>            the screen\" but, of course, the en banc court disagreed  with\r<br><br><br><br>                                        -22-\r                                        -22-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            him.  Catching up counsel on past rhetoric is sometimes fair,\r<br><br>            but \r               not \r                   in \r                      the present situation where the  blip  argument was\r<br><br>            so clearly unsuccessful exaggeration.\r<br><br>                 This  brings us  back  to Hensley.    Of course,  it  is\r<br><br>            sometimes \r                     appropriate \r                                to \r                                   discount for failed or non-compensable\r<br><br>            claims \r                  where \r                        they \r                            cannot \r                                   be neatly segregated from a successful\r<br><br>            compensable one.  But  the district court did discount by  20\r<br><br>            percent for the failed  ADEA claim; and it took the  original\r<br><br>            $207,000 \r                    award as already reduced to account for time spent on\r<br><br>            state claims that would not have been needed for the  federal\r<br><br>            claims.  The former adjustment is obvious; and if the  latter\r<br><br>            assumption is an error, the Hazens have not shown it.\r<br><br>                 Finally, \r                         we \r                            come \r                                to \r                                   the \r                                       district court's refusal to reduce\r<br><br>            the award of almost $72,000 made by this court for the  first\r<br><br>            appeal. \r                    \r                    Biggins \r                           says \r                                that this award is no longer open because\r<br><br>            the Hazens did  not ask for  a reduction at  the time of  the\r<br><br>            remand; \r                   the \r                       Hazens say, we think with some justification, that\r<br><br>            such a reduction request would have been premature since  the\r<br><br>            possibility remained that Biggins would still prevail on  the\r<br><br>            ADEA claim at the second trial.\r<br><br>                 But this  court is not  inclined to  reopen its  earlier\r<br><br>            $72,000 award.  In theory, the Hazens have a claim that  time\r<br><br>            spent on  the first  appeal  as to  the ADEA  issue--among  a\r<br><br>            considerable number of other issues--ought to be  subtracted.\r<br><br>            But \r               one \r                   may \r                      doubt, \r                             at \r                                least here, whether much discernable cost\r<br><br><br><br>                                        -23-\r                                        -23-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            is added  by writing  more pages  in an  appellate brief,  to\r<br><br>            address one more issue with which counsel is already familiar\r<br><br>            after an extensive trial.  \r<br><br>                 In \r                   refusing \r                            to \r                              reopen \r                                     the earlier award, we also take into\r<br><br>            account two  other factors: that  the original panel  earlier\r<br><br>            refused \r                   to \r                     enlarge \r                             Biggins' award, despite his offer of further\r<br><br>            time \r                records, and that this panel has no intention of making a\r<br><br>            further  award to  Biggins  for time  he  has just  spent  in\r<br><br>            defending \r                     his \r                        attorney's \r                                   fee judgment (although it too could be\r<br><br>            the \r               subject \r                       of an award in this court's discretion).

We hope that this\r<br><br>            opinion will  bring the matter  to a close,  for a decade  of\r<br><br>            litigation about a single, narrow event is enough.\r<br><br>                                         I.\r<br><br>                 The case  began  in February  1988 when  Walter  Biggins\r<br><br>            brought suit in district  court against his former  employer,\r<br><br>            Hazen \r                 Paper \r                       Company, and its two principals, Robert Hazen, the\r<br><br>            president, and his cousin, Thomas Hazen, the treasurer.   The\r<br><br>            company \r                   is \r                      a \r                        small but successful maker of specialty papers of\r<br><br>            various \r                   kinds.  Biggins joined the company in 1977, at age 52,\r<br><br>            and \r               served \r                      as its technical director for about nine years.  He\r<br><br>            had no written employment contract.\r<br><br>                 During his employ,  Biggins developed a superior  water-\r<br><br>            based paper coating  that increased the company's sales.   He\r<br><br>            sought a  larger  salary, was  given  a small  increase,  but\r<br><br>            remained unsatisfied and sought a further increase.   Biggins\r<br><br>            later  claimed that  in 1984  Thomas Hazen  had promised  him\r<br><br>            company stock instead of a further raise; Thomas Hazen denied\r<br><br>            making any such promise.\r<br><br>                 Biggins, during  his  employ by  the company,  was  also\r<br><br>            involved \r                    in \r                       two different ventures with his sons.  When Thomas\r<br><br><br><br>                                         -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            Hazen learned of this, he sought a confidentiality  agreement\r<br><br>            from Biggins, limiting his outside activities during, and for\r<br><br>            a \r             limited \r                     time \r                         after, \r                                his employment with the company.  Biggins\r<br><br>            refused to sign, except in exchange for the stock he said had\r<br><br>            been promised.  He  was discharged in June 1986--a few  weeks\r<br><br>            before  his  rights under  the  company  pension  plan  would\r<br><br>            otherwise have vested.\r<br><br>                 Biggins then  sued  the company  and the  Hazen  cousins\r<br><br>            (collectively \"the Hazens\") in an eight-count complaint.  The\r<br><br>            first two counts charged  the Hazens with age  discrimination\r<br><br>            under the  ADEA and  interference with  pension rights  under\r<br><br>            ERISA.1  The remaining claims, of limited importance to  this\r<br><br>            appeal (except  for the  contract claim),  were for  wrongful\r<br><br>            deprivation \r                       of \r                         property, \r                                   wrongful discharge, fraud, conversion,\r<br><br>            breach of contract and  violation of the Massachusetts  Civil\r<br><br>            Rights Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, SS 11H and 11I.\r<br><br>                 In \r                   substance, Biggins claimed under the first two counts,\r<br><br>            respectively,\r                         that he had been fired on account of his age--he\r<br><br>            was \r               replaced \r                        with a younger man--and to prevent the vesting of\r<br><br>            his \r               pension. \r                         \r                        In \r                           additional counts, he also sought the value of\r<br><br>            the \r               stock \r                    allegedly \r                              promised by Thomas Hazen and the benefit of\r<br><br>            the \r               paper-coating formula and method, which Biggins claimed to\r<br><br>            own. \r                 \r                 The \r                    gravamen \r                             of \r                                the remaining counts was that he had been\r<br><br><br><br>              \r              \r               \r                \r                 \r                  \r                   \r                    \r                     \r                     1ADEA \r                          is \r                             the \r                                 Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29\r<br>            U.S.C. S  621, et seq. and  ERISA is the Employee  Retirement\r<br>            Income Security Act, 29 U.S.C. S 1001 et seq.\r<br><br>                                         -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            wrongfully \r                      discharged in violation of various rights protected\r<br><br>            under state law.\r<br><br>                 In  its verdict,  the  jury  largely  accepted  Biggins'\r<br><br>            position, apart from  his claim to ownership of the  formula,\r<br><br>            which it rejected.  On  the ADEA claim, the jury awarded  him\r<br><br>            around $560,000; the ERISA award was $100,000, later adjusted\r<br><br>            downward to  $93,000 on  appeal.   The  fraud award  for  the\r<br><br>            allegedly \r                     promised stock was about $315,000.  Biggins was also\r<br><br>            awarded just  under $267,000  for discharge  in violation  of\r<br><br>            contract.   On two other  counts, only  nominal damages  were\r<br><br>            awarded.\r<br><br>                 Because the jury found  that the age discrimination  was\r<br><br>            willful, the award on the ADEA count would normally have been\r<br><br>            doubled, \r                    see\r                        \r                       29 \r                          U.S.C. \r                                 S \r                                   626(b), but the district court granted\r<br><br>            judgment  n.o.v. in  favor  of the  Hazens  on the  issue  of\r<br><br>            willfulness. \r                         In other respects, the district court upheld the\r<br><br>            jury verdict against various post-trial motions.  We  reserve\r<br><br>            for later discussion the issue of attorney's fees, which  the\r<br><br>            district court also addressed.\r<br><br>                 On appeal, a  panel of this court affirmed the  district\r<br><br>            court \r                 with \r                     several \r                             exceptions.  Biggins v. Hazen Paper Co., 953\r<br><br>            F.2d \r                1405 \r                     (1st Cir. 1992).  Two are pertinent here: first, the\r<br><br>            panel found  that the evidence  on the  ADEA count  supported\r<br><br>            damages \r                   (before \r                          doubling) of only about $420,000, but the panel\r<br><br>            also \r                reinstated \r                          the \r                              willfulness finding and doubled the reduced\r<br><br><br><br>                                         -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            award to about $840,000.  Id. at 1416.  Second, the panel set\r<br><br>            aside the  contract  claim  verdict for  lack  of  sufficient\r<br><br>            evidence to establish a contract.  Id. at 1421-24.    \r<br><br>                 The \r                    Supreme \r                            Court then granted certiorari and vacated the\r<br><br>            panel \r                 decision on the ADEA count.  Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins,\r<br><br>            <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112844\"><a href=\"/opinion/112844/hazen-paper-co-v-biggins/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">604</span></a></span> (1993).  The Court held that the panel had  been\r<br><br>            mistaken in relying  upon the ERISA  violation to supply  the\r<br><br>            wrongful motive for the ADEA violation; it said that pensions\r<br><br>            might \r                 often \r                       correlate with age but a firing to prevent pension\r<br><br>            vesting \r                   did \r                       not itself amount to a firing based upon age.  Id.\r<br><br>            at 611-13.\r<br><br>                 The  Supreme Court  remanded the  case to  the panel  to\r<br><br>            reconsider \r                      whether the jury had sufficient evidence to find an\r<br><br>            ADEA violation once the ERISA violation was put to one  side.\r<br><br>            507 U.S. at 614.  On remand, the original panel  reconsidered\r<br><br>            the \r               ADEA \r                    claim.  In a second opinion in October 1993, it ruled\r<br><br>            that \r                even \r                     disregarding the ERISA violation, enough evidence of\r<br><br>            age  discrimination remained  to  sustain the  ADEA  verdict,\r<br><br>            reduced and then doubled as before.\r<br><br>                 The \r                    Hazens \r                           then petitioned for rehearing en banc, arguing\r<br><br>            inter \r                 alia \r                      that the panel had misconstrued a pertinent Supreme\r<br><br>            Court decision issued shortly after its remand in this  case,\r<br><br>            Hicks  v.

The jury returned a verdict for\r<br><br>            the Hazens.  \r<br><br>                 After \r                      various \r                             post-trial \r                                        motions, Biggins filed the appeal\r<br><br>            now \r               before \r                      us; a cross-appeal was filed by the Hazens relating\r<br><br>            only \r                to \r                   attorney's fees.  We begin with the attacks by Biggins\r<br><br>            upon the  en banc court's  remand for a  new trial, and  then\r<br><br>            address his claims of error in the second trial.

Where there is legal\r<br><br>            error, appeals courts often overturn jury verdicts, and order\r<br><br>            new \r               trials \r                      or even dismissal.  This occurs, for example, where\r<br><br>            evidence \r                    has \r                       been \r                            wrongly admitted, or where an instruction was\r<br><br>            mistaken,  or  even  where the  evidence  did  not  permit  a\r<br><br>            reasonable jury to reach the verdict rendered.

The court's appraisal, as noted\r<br><br>            earlier, was that the jury was potentially misled by the same\r<br><br>            error that the  Supreme Court identified  in the first  panel\r<br><br><br><br>                                         -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            decision, namely, a belief that the wrongful motive  (pension\r<br><br>            interference) that gave rise to an ERISA violation by  itself\r<br><br>            constituted \r                       wrongful motive under ADEA.  Whether or not the en\r<br><br>            banc\r                \r                court's \r                        assessment of prejudice was invincibly supported,\r<br><br>            the \r               en \r                  banc \r                       court was free under the Seventh Amendment to make\r<br><br>            that judgment.2\r<br><br>                 Biggins' \r                         other challenge to the en banc court's authority\r<br><br>            is also wide of  the mark.  He  argues that when the  Supreme\r<br><br>            Court \r                 remanded the case to this court, it precluded this court\r<br><br>            from taking  any action other than  an up-or-down vote as  to\r<br><br>            whether enough evidence remained to support the ADEA verdict.\r<br><br>            Therefore, says Biggins,  the en banc court has violated  the\r<br><br>            Supreme Court's mandate.   \r<br><br>                 Of course, a higher  court's mandate must be  respected,\r<br><br>            Sprague v.

Where as  here a\r<br><br>            judgment is vacated and the matter remanded, Hazen Paper Co.,\r<br><br>            507 U.S. at 617, the lower court must undo the judgment  just\r<br><br>            vacated and  cannot normally revisit  a legal issue  actually\r<br><br>            decided \r                   by \r                      the reviewing court.  But after that, the situation\r<br><br>            is less rigid than Biggins assumes.\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>                      2The concern did not come out of the blue.  Biggins\r<br>            had relied in  his complaint upon the deprivation of  pension\r<br>            benefits \r                    as \r                       an act of age discrimination and had made the same\r<br>            argument on appeal.\r<br><br><br>                                         -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                 On remand, courts are often confronted with issues  that\r<br><br>            were never considered by the remanding court.

Whether  this judgment was right  or\r<br><br>            wrong--and we cannot revisit it--the contamination issue  had\r<br><br>            certainly not been addressed in the Supreme Court's  opinion.\r<br><br>            And when Biggins made his mandate argument on certiorari, the\r<br><br>            Supreme Court denied the petition.\r<br><br>                                        III.\r<br><br>                 The \r                    next \r                         claim of error presents the most difficult issue\r<br><br>            in the case.

But the limitations  have\r<br><br>            been slowly diluted  over time and most are irrelevant  here.\r<br><br>            Nor do the Hazens dispute  that the jury verdict in favor  of\r<br><br>            Biggins at the  first trial is now  final except on the  ADEA\r<br><br>            count.\r<br><br>                 The \r                    Hazens' \r                            main argument against collateral estoppel has\r<br><br>            been \r                that \r                     the \"issues\" in the two cases were different because\r<br><br>            nothing in the first trial validly determined that the Hazens\r<br><br>            had \r               been \r                    motivated by age in firing Biggins (since the Supreme\r<br><br>            Court had vacated this claim).   This won't wash.  True,  age\r<br><br>            motivation is usually the ultimate issue under the ADEA;  but\r<br><br>            collateral estoppel is no longer limited to ultimate  issues:\r<br><br>            necessary intermediate findings can  now be used to  preclude\r<br><br>            relitigation.\r                          Grella v. Salem Five Cent Savings Bank, 42 F.3d\r<br><br>            26, 30-31 (1st Cir. 1994); Restatement (Second), Judgments  S\r<br><br>            27, comment j. (1982).\r<br><br>                 Often \r                      it \r                         is \r                           very \r                                difficult to prove that the initial trial\r<br><br>            necessarily decided an intermediate issue.  But in this  case\r<br><br>            the special verdict  form and reasonable inference  indicates\r<br><br>            that several \"facts\"  were determined by  the jury on  counts\r<br><br><br><br>                                        -11-\r                                        -11-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            other \r                 than \r                      ADEA: \r                           (1) \r                               that Biggins was fired, (2) that the stock\r<br><br>            had been promised to him, and  (3) that (in the words of  the\r<br><br>            verdict form) \"defendants wrongfully discharged plaintiff  in\r<br><br>            order to deprive plaintiff of the promised stock compensation\r<br><br>            . . . .\"\r<br><br>                 At \r                   the \r                       new \r                          trial, \r                                 the \r                                     jury was instructed that Biggins had\r<br><br>            been  fired, so that is out of  the case.  But on the  second\r<br><br>            issue Biggins says  that the Hazens relitigated the issue  of\r<br><br>            whether \r                   they \r                       had \r                           promised him stock, and that appears to be the\r<br><br>            case.   A  good  argument can  be  made that  under  standard\r<br><br>            collateral estoppel doctrine, the Hazens should not have been\r<br><br>            allowed \r                   to \r                      relitigate the issue whether \"in fact\" Thomas Hazen\r<br><br>            had promised the stock  to Biggins, a point about which  both\r<br><br>            Biggins and Hazen told largely inconsistent stories.\r<br><br>                 Yet \r                    if \r                       there \r                            was \r                                error, \r                                       we regard it as harmless.  Whether\r<br><br>            the stock was  promised has little relevance to the  question\r<br><br>            whether the  Hazens engaged in  age discrimination when  they\r<br><br>            fired Biggins.   Biggins argues that the Hazens purported  to\r<br><br>            fire him  because  he  refused to  sign  the  confidentiality\r<br><br>            agreement \r                     and \r                        therefore\r                                  \r                                  the stock promise was relevant, Biggins\r<br><br>            having \r                  offered \r                          to \r                            sign \r                                 in exchange for the promised stock.  But\r<br><br>            Biggins' \r                    refusal to sign does not vanish as a plausible motive\r<br><br>            for the  Hazens,  regardless  of whether  stock  was  wrongly\r<br><br>            withheld.\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>                                        -12-\r                                        -12-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                 Obviously  the Hazens  wanted to  relitigate the  stock-\r<br><br>            promise issue, and Biggins to foreclose relitigation, because\r<br><br>            the Hazens look  worse--from the standpoint of  character--if\r<br><br>            they were welshing on a promise and Biggins looks worse if he\r<br><br>            were making  new  demands.   But  character evidence  is  not\r<br><br>            normally admissible  to show conformity  therewith.  Fed.  R.\r<br><br>            Evid. \r                 404(a).  Thus, the permissible use of the evidence about\r<br><br>            the promise  was very limited  so far as  the ADEA claim  was\r<br><br>            concerned; properly used,  it added  useful context,  nothing\r<br><br>            more.\r<br><br>                 Turning to the third \"fact\" in issue, we reject Biggins'\r<br><br>            claim  that the jury  should have been  told that the  Hazens\r<br><br>            fraudulently discharged Biggins  to deprive  him of  promised\r<br><br>            stock. \r                   \r                   How \r                      such \r                           an \r                              instruction would be understood is unclear:\r<br><br>            the Hazens say that (by supplying a different motive) it cuts\r<br><br>            against Biggins'  current  claim that  he was  discharged  on\r<br><br>            account \r                   of \r                      age; \r                          on \r                             the \r                                 other hand, Biggins would obviously have\r<br><br>            liked the  new jury to hear  the terms \"fraud\" and  \"wrongful\r<br><br>            discharge\" as a dual motive.\r<br><br>                 The \r                    problem \r                            the \r                               jury \r                                    confronted on retrial was to sort out\r<br><br>            any age discrimination motive in the tangle of other possible\r<br><br>            motivations,  including  perceived  disloyalty,  compensation\r<br><br>            quarrels, and the like.  We think that it would badly distort\r<br><br>            matters to tell the jury  that in carrying out this task,  it\r<br><br>            must accept that the Hazens' motivation in firing Biggins was\r<br><br><br><br>                                        -13-\r                                        -13-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            wrongful or fraudulent.   The glare from such an  instruction\r<br><br>            would distort any effort to distinguish shadows or shades  in\r<br><br>            the Hazens' actual motivation.  See Fed. R. Evid. 403.4\r<br><br>                 In \r                   sum, \r                        there was no prejudicial error in this challenged\r<br><br>            refusal \r                   to \r                      apply collateral estoppel.  We thus need not decide\r<br><br>            whether, even on  the opposite assumption, it would make  any\r<br><br>            sense to reverse here.   After all, the issues have now  been\r<br><br>            relitigated, collateral estoppel  is a  doctrine of  judicial\r<br><br>            economy, \r                    and \r                        one \r                           might \r                                 wonder whether--assuming no other error-\r<br><br>            -such \r                 an \r                    objective would be served by a third trial.

But that\r<br><br>            is  beside the point:   facts underlying  one claim could  be\r<br><br>            pertinent to  a different  claim, regardless  of whether  the\r<br><br>            former \r                  claim \r                        had been satisfied.  Still, the Hazens also argue\r<br><br>            that \r                in \r                   this \r                        instance the Supreme Court expressly decided that\r<br><br>            interference with pension vesting is not age discrimination.\r<br><br>                 Actually, \r                          the Supreme Court reserved the possibility that\r<br><br>            pension  evidence might  occasionally be  relevant where  the\r<br><br>            employer is shown consciously  to equate pension status  with\r<br><br>            age, Hazen Paper  Co., 507 U.S. at  612-613; but that is  not\r<br><br>            Biggins' argument here.  Rather, what Biggins wanted the jury\r<br><br>            to infer from  the pension interference  finding is that  the\r<br><br>            Hazens are  not as nice as they claim to be.

The\r<br><br>            district  court had every  reason to worry,  in light of  the\r<br><br>            Supreme Court and en banc decisions, that undue attention  to\r<br><br>            pension termination would prompt yet another reversal.

Civ. P. 60(b)(6), which permits the court to undo a  final\r<br><br>            judgment.    His  claim was  that  a  recent  state  decision\r<br><br>            undermined \r                      the \r                         panel's \r                                 earlier rejection of the contract claim.\r<br><br>            The district court denied the motion.\r<br><br>                 To understand this Rule 60(b) claim, one must return  to\r<br><br>            the \r               original \r                       proceedings.  In the first trial, the jury awarded\r<br><br>            Biggins \r                   about \r                        $267,000 \r                                 on his breach of contract claim; Biggins\r<br><br>            claimed that the  company's \"employee  handbook\" comprised  a\r<br><br>            contract  under  Jackson  v.  Action  for  Boston   Community\r<br><br>            Development, Inc.,  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></span>  (Mass. 1988),  and  that\r<br><br>            protections it afforded against discharge had been denied  to\r<br><br><br><br>                                        -16-\r                                        -16-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            him.   Jackson had  held that \"on  proper proof, a  personnel\r<br><br>            manual can be shown to form the basis of [such] an express or\r<br><br>            implied contract.\"  525 N.E.2d at 414.  \r<br><br>                 On the first  appeal, the panel  set aside the  contract\r<br><br>            claim award.  The panel noted that there was no evidence that\r<br><br>            the  handbook  had  been  incorporated  into  a  contract  by\r<br><br>            negotiation or that either Biggins or the company had treated\r<br><br>            the handbook as a contract  between them.  953 F.2d at  1423.\r<br><br>            The \r               panel \r                     held that a judgment n.o.v. should have been granted\r<br><br>            and \r               vacated \r                       the \r                          award. \r                                  \r                                  That disposition, like the several jury\r<br><br>            awards to  Biggins that were  not further  challenged by  the\r<br><br>            Hazens, became final.\r<br><br>                 In the  Rule 60(b) motion,  Biggins argued  that a  more\r<br><br>            recent decision of the state's highest court, O'Brien v.  New\r<br><br>            England Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">664</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">843</span></span>  (Mass.\r<br><br>            1996), conflicts  with the panel's  earlier treatment of  the\r<br><br>            contract \r                    issue in 1992.  We agree that the panel's disposition\r<br><br>            of the contract  claim might have been different had  O'Brien\r<br><br>            been \r                decided \r                        earlier: \r                                 \r                                 its tone and language are more favorable\r<br><br>            to such  recoveries than Jackson.   While there is no  direct\r<br><br>            contradiction, O'Brien is  a gradual  extension of  precedent\r<br><br>            (Jackson\r                    \r                    was \r                       itself \r                              an \r                                 extension of an earlier case) typical of\r<br><br>            common-law jurisprudence.  \r<br><br>                 Yet the case law is  very hostile to using a mistake  of\r<br><br>            state \r                 law, \r                      still less a change in state common law, as grounds\r<br><br><br><br>                                        -17-\r                                        -17-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            for a motion to reopen a final judgment under Rule  60(b)(6).\r<br><br>              though                               cf.

The finality of judgments protects\r<br><br>            against \r                   this \r                        kind of retroactive lawmaking.  Admittedly, there\r<br><br>            is some arbitrariness  (e.g., \"new law\"  is applied in  cases\r<br><br>            still \r                 on \r                    direct \r                          appeal); \r                                   but, by the same token, Jackson itself\r<br><br>            had not been decided  when the Hazens first handed out  their\r<br><br>            employee handbook.\r<br><br>                 Biggins says that the abuse of discretion standard under\r<br><br>            Rule 60(b) should not shield the district court in this case,\r<br><br>            since  that  court may  have  thought  itself  disabled  from\r<br><br>            reconsidering the panel's holding on the contract award.

To understand the  issues\r<br><br>            requires \r                    us \r                       to retrace several steps, beginning again with the\r<br><br>            first  trial.  After  that trial, the  district court in  two\r<br><br>            stages \r                  awarded Biggins a total of about $207,000 in fees (plus\r<br><br>            costs), reflecting Biggins' success on both the ADEA and  the\r<br><br>            ERISA claims. \r<br><br>                 Attorney's \r                           fees \r                               are \r                                   mandatory for the successful plaintiff\r<br><br>            under the ADEA and  permissible under ERISA, see 29 U.S.C.  S\r<br><br>            626(b); \r                   29 \r                      U.S.C. S 1140; as to the latter, the district court\r<br><br>            exercised its discretion in favor of an award.  No such  fees\r<br><br>            were available  for the  common-law claims  on which  Biggins\r<br><br>            recovered substantial damages, namely, fraud and discharge in\r<br><br>            violation of contract.  The award for the two federal  claims\r<br><br>            was based upon straight time and upon hourly rates not now in\r<br><br>            issue.\r<br><br>                 After   the   first   panel   opinion,   Biggins--having\r<br><br>            successfully defended his  verdicts on both federal  claims--\r<br><br>            sought an additional  award of attorney's fees and costs  for\r<br><br>            appellate work.   In March  1992, the  panel awarded  Biggins\r<br><br>            additional fees of  just under $72,000.   There followed  the\r<br><br>            Supreme Court remand of  the ADEA claim and the second  panel\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>                                        -19-\r                                        -19-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            opinion where Biggins, again successful on that claim, sought\r<br><br>            further attorney's fees in November 1993.\r<br><br>                 However, \r                         in \r                            June 1994, the en banc court vacated the ADEA\r<br><br>            award, ordering a new trial.  In a companion order, the panel\r<br><br>            declined \r                    to \r                       award any additional fees for the first appeal, as\r<br><br>            sought by Biggins,  and said that  the remainder of  Biggins'\r<br><br>            application for additional fees had been rendered moot by the\r<br><br>            en banc order.  The case then returned to the district  court\r<br><br>            where the new trial occurred in April 1996.  \r<br><br>                 After \r                      the \r                          second \r                                trial, \r                                       Biggins sought to execute judgment\r<br><br>            on \r              the \r                  prior \r                        awards of attorney's fees (just over $207,000 for\r<br><br>            the \r               first \r                     trial \r                          and \r                              almost  $72,000 for the first appeal).  The\r<br><br>            Hazens, by contrast, moved under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5)  to\r<br><br>            reopen the  judgment and reduce  the previously awarded  fees\r<br><br>            because \r                   Biggins was no longer the prevailing party on the ADEA\r<br><br>            claim. \r                   \r                   In \r                     July \r                          1996, \r                                the district court resolved the matter in\r<br><br>            a detailed memorandum, pointing  out that he was  \"intimately\r<br><br>            familiar\" with the case.\r<br><br>                 The district judge  agreed with the Hazens that the  fee\r<br><br>            award resulting  from the first  trial should be  reexamined,\r<br><br>            since \r                 one \r                     predicate (the ADEA award) had now been undone.

He  ruled\r<br><br>            that  a 20  percent reduction  was warranted  and awarded  80\r<br><br>            percent of the original $207,000 figure to cover the original\r<br><br>            trial.\r<br><br>                 The \r                    district \r                             court declined to alter the panel's award of\r<br><br>            almost $72,000 for the first appeal; that appeal, it will  be\r<br><br>            remembered, had resulted in affirmance of the ADEA and  ERISA\r<br><br>            awards, \r                   but \r                       the \r                          ADEA \r                               award had later been undone.  The district\r<br><br>            court \r                 said \r                      that this court had likely considered the matter of\r<br><br>            a \r             reduction \r                       when it remanded for a new trial, and in any case,\r<br><br>            that award was the court of appeals' business.\r<br><br>                 Accordingly, \r                             the \r                                district court entered a revised judgment\r<br><br>            covering \r                    the \r                        entire attorney's fees award in both courts.  The\r<br><br>            total is about $237,700, apart  from costs.  It is from  this\r<br><br>            judgment that the  Hazens have now cross-appealed,  objecting\r<br><br>            both \r                to \r                   the \r                      modesty \r                              of \r                                 the 20 percent reduction in the district\r<br><br>            court fee and the refusal to reduce at all the amount awarded\r<br><br>            by this court for appellate work.\r<br><br>                 The district  judge's refusal to  order more  than a  20\r<br><br>            percent reduction is easily sustained.  Most of this case has\r<br><br>            focused throughout on a central event, Biggins' firing, in an\r<br><br>            effort  to  appraise  the  Hazens'  reason  or  reasons;  but\r<br><br>            motivation had to be discerned through examination of several\r<br><br><br><br>                                        -21-\r                                        -21-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            controversies\r                         that had enveloped the parties and led up to the\r<br><br>            firing, including Biggins' other ventures and claim to  stock\r<br><br>            ownership.\r<br><br>                 A \r                  trial \r                        of \r                           the firing and related background events would\r<br><br>            have been  quite extensive,  and probably  pretty similar  in\r<br><br>            contour, even  if Biggins  had brought  only one  of the  two\r<br><br>            federal \r                   claims. \r                            \r                           Indeed, \r                                   the second trial was nominally limited\r<br><br>            to  the  ADEA  claim,  but  its  duration  and  breadth  were\r<br><br>            considerable.   The commonality  of issues  has already  been\r<br><br>            noted, in the Hazens' favor, sustaining their evidence as  to\r<br><br>            background matters in the second trial.\r<br><br>                 In \r                   all \r                       events, \r                              the \r                                  Hazens make no effort to show in detail\r<br><br>            that \r                the \r                    20 \r                      percent \r                              reduction understates the time savings from\r<br><br>            (hypothetically) eliminating the  ADEA claim  from the  first\r<br><br>            trial.  Instead, they rely mainly upon doctrine, namely, that\r<br><br>            where \r<br><br>                 a plaintiff has  achieved only  partial or  limited\r<br>                 success, \r                         the \r                             product of hours reasonably expended on\r<br>                 the litigation as a whole times a reasonable hourly\r<br>                 rate may be an  excessive amount. . . . even  where\r<br>                 the plaintiff's claims were interrelated . . . .  \r<br><br>            Hensley v. Eckerhart, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110929\"><a href=\"/opinion/110929/hensley-v-eckerhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span>, 436 (1983).  \r<br><br>                 We \r                   say \r                       \"mainly\" \r                               because \r                                       the Hazens also try to make use of\r<br><br>            Biggins' earlier attempt, in resisting a remand, to  minimize\r<br><br>            the importance of the ERISA claim in the first trial.  It  is\r<br><br>            true \r                that \r                     Biggins called the claim little more than \"a blip on\r<br><br>            the screen\" but, of course, the en banc court disagreed  with\r<br><br><br><br>                                        -22-\r                                        -22-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            him.  Catching up counsel on past rhetoric is sometimes fair,\r<br><br>            but \r               not \r                   in \r                      the present situation where the  blip  argument was\r<br><br>            so clearly unsuccessful exaggeration.\r<br><br>                 This  brings us  back  to Hensley.    Of course,  it  is\r<br><br>            sometimes \r                     appropriate \r                                to \r                                   discount for failed or non-compensable\r<br><br>            claims \r                  where \r                        they \r                            cannot \r                                   be neatly segregated from a successful\r<br><br>            compensable one.  But  the district court did discount by  20\r<br><br>            percent for the failed  ADEA claim; and it took the  original\r<br><br>            $207,000 \r                    award as already reduced to account for time spent on\r<br><br>            state claims that would not have been needed for the  federal\r<br><br>            claims.  The former adjustment is obvious; and if the  latter\r<br><br>            assumption is an error, the Hazens have not shown it.\r<br><br>                 Finally, \r                         we \r                            come \r                                to \r                                   the \r                                       district court's refusal to reduce\r<br><br>            the award of almost $72,000 made by this court for the  first\r<br><br>            appeal. \r                    \r                    Biggins \r                           says \r                                that this award is no longer open because\r<br><br>            the Hazens did  not ask for  a reduction at  the time of  the\r<br><br>            remand; \r                   the \r                       Hazens say, we think with some justification, that\r<br><br>            such a reduction request would have been premature since  the\r<br><br>            possibility remained that Biggins would still prevail on  the\r<br><br>            ADEA claim at the second trial.\r<br><br>                 But this  court is not  inclined to  reopen its  earlier\r<br><br>            $72,000 award.  In theory, the Hazens have a claim that  time\r<br><br>            spent on  the first  appeal  as to  the ADEA  issue--among  a\r<br><br>            considerable number of other issues--ought to be  subtracted.\r<br><br>            But \r               one \r                   may \r                      doubt, \r                             at \r                                least here, whether much discernable cost\r<br><br><br><br>                                        -23-\r                                        -23-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            is added  by writing  more pages  in an  appellate brief,  to\r<br><br>            address one more issue with which counsel is already familiar\r<br><br>            after an extensive trial.  \r<br><br>                 In \r                   refusing \r                            to \r                              reopen \r                                     the earlier award, we also take into\r<br><br>            account two  other factors: that  the original panel  earlier\r<br><br>            refused \r                   to \r                     enlarge \r                             Biggins' award, despite his offer of further\r<br><br>            time \r                records, and that this panel has no intention of making a\r<br><br>            further  award to  Biggins  for time  he  has just  spent  in\r<br><br>            defending \r                     his \r                        attorney's \r                                   fee judgment (although it too could be\r<br><br>            the \r               subject \r                       of an award in this court's discretion).
