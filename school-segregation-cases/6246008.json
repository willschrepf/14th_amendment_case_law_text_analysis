He claims\nthat his death sentence was based on materially inaccurate evidence from the\nState’s witness, Warden Melodye Nelson. For the reasons that follow, we deny\na COA.\n\n\n\n       * Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not\nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH\nCIR. R. 47.5.4.\n\f    Case: 17-70013     Document: 00514282125    Page: 2   Date Filed: 12/21/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 17-70013\n                                       I\n      Mark Robertson was convicted and sentenced to death in 1991 for the\nmurder of Edna Brau in the course of committing a robbery in Dallas County,\nTexas. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (“TCCA”) affirmed Robertson’s\nconviction on direct review. Robertson v. State, 871 S.W.2d 701, 714 (Tex. Crim.\nApp. 1993). Robertson’s first attempts at state and federal habeas relief were\nunsuccessful; however, the TCCA ultimately granted him a new punishment\nhearing under Penry v. Johnson, 532 U.S. 782 (2001). See Robertson v. State,\nNo. AP-71,224, 2011 WL 1161381, at *1 (Tex. Crim. App. Mar. 9, 2011). At\nRobertson’s second sentencing proceeding, the State submitted multiple\nconfessions and other evidence to establish that Robertson was a future danger\nto society. The TCCA summarized the evidence as follows:\n       The State presented evidence of other offenses and bad acts,\n       including evidence that [Robertson], as a young teenager,\n       brought a gun to school and threatened to shoot other students.\n       [Robertson] had strangled cats and had stomped birds to death.\n       He had also committed armed robbery and a wide variety of\n       drug-related offenses. While he was on deferred adjudication for\n       an aggravated robbery, [Robertson] killed 7-Eleven store\n       employee Jeffrey Saunders.\n\nId. (footnotes omitted).\n      The State also relied on its witness, Warden Melodye Nelson. She\ntestified about the prison’s classification system, which ranges from G1 (least\nrestrictive) through G5 (most restrictive), and administrative segregation.\nWarden Nelson testified that an inmate convicted of capital murder who\nreceived a life sentence with the benefit of parole, or who received a sentence\nof 50 years or greater who has not served a minimum of ten years of that\nsentence, would be classified as a G3 prisoner. She further explained that once\nan inmate has served ten years of that sentence, he may be promoted to G2\nstatus. Warden Nelson testified that Robertson, who had served 18 years and\n                                       2\n\f    Case: 17-70013    Document: 00514282125     Page: 3   Date Filed: 12/21/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 17-70013\nhad only minor infractions, would be in the pool to receive the “automatic\npromotion” to G2 status. Warden Nelson testified that prison employees are\nunderpaid and the prisons are under-staffed. She also stated that she believed\nthat the year prior, the prison system was under-staffed by nearly 4,000\ncorrectional officers. She explained the prison’s system for tracking the\nwhereabouts of inmates. As to Robertson specifically, she testified to the minor\nprison infractions which Robertson violated, and she stated that the incidents\nof prison violence were more common in general population than in\nadministrative segregation or death row. After considering the evidence, the\njury sentenced Robertson to death. Id.\n      Robertson filed a motion for a new trial on the grounds that some\ntestimony from the State’s witness was false and misleading. At the motion\nhearing, the Assistant District Attorney first brought to the court’s attention\nnew information regarding certain testimony from Warden Nelson, given in a\ndifferent trial. The State also informed the court that it had turned over the\ninformation to defense counsel. Relevantly, the State informed the court that\nWarden Nelson testified in a different trial that prisoners sentenced to life\nwithout parole could be eligible for G2 prison status. After the trial, however,\nWarden Nelson learned that capital offenders who receive a life without parole\nsentence can never receive a prison status below G3. Both the prosecutor and\ndefense counsel acknowledged, on the record, that Robertson would not have\nbeen eligible for a life without parole sentence, so a rule prohibiting a life-\nsentenced inmate from receiving a less-restrictive classification did not apply\nto Robertson. After considering Robertson’s evidence, including the testimony\nfrom his expert, S.O. Woods, Jr., the court ultimately denied Robertson’s\nmotion for a new trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\f     Case: 17-70013        Document: 00514282125          Page: 4     Date Filed: 12/21/2017\n\n\n\n                                        No. 17-70013\n       On appeal, the TCCA affirmed the sentence. Id. The TCCA again denied\nRobertson’s renewed petition for state habeas relief. Ex Parte Robertson, No.\nWR-30,077-03, 2013 WL 135667 (Tex. Crim. App. Jan. 9, 2013).\n       Robertson returned to federal court and filed a petition for writ of habeas\ncorpus, which was denied. In his petition, Robertson made two claims for\nfederal habeas relief, 1 only one of which is relevant to this court: whether his\ndeath sentence was based on materially inaccurate evidence. The district court\nconstrued this claim as a Due Process claim. Robertson asserted five matters\nto which the State’s witness, Warden Nelson, had testified as grounds for relief:\n(1) Robertson would automatically enter the prison system at a G3 level\nprisoner; (2) prison personnel were underpaid and prisons were short-staffed;\n(3) there was more violence in general population than in administrative\nsegregation; (4) inmates are free to travel to and from their cells; 2 and (5)\nprisons are filled with psychopaths. Robertson, 2011 WL 1161381, at *7–10.\nRobertson relied on his expert, Woods, to prove the falsity of Warden Nelson’s\ntestimony at the hearing on his motion for a new trial. The district court\nconcluded that Robertson’s expert failed to present hard evidence or statistics\nthat contradicted Warden Nelson’s testimony on any matter. Rather, Woods\nexpressed that he disagreed with certain word choices and merely indicated\nthat he thought Warden Nelson was inaccurate. Importantly, Woods never\naccused Warden Nelson of perjury. Accordingly, the district court denied\n\n\n       1  Robertson also asserted that trial counsel failed to adequately investigate and\ndevelop mitigating evidence. The district court dismissed the claim as unexhausted and\nprocedurally barred, and alternatively, denied it for lack of merit notwithstanding any failure\nto exhaust. Robertson does not raise this issue in his motion for a COA.\n        2 The district court classified ground four, from those listed above, as: “a year ago the\n\nTexas Department of Criminal Justice was 4,000 correctional officers short.” However, the\nfourth ground the TCCA reviewed was whether inmates can come and go from their cells to\nwork. Robertson, 2011 WL 1161381, at *9. We will address the testimony regarding whether\nthe prison system was under-staffed with ground two and address the inmates’ freedom to\ntravel to and from their cells as ground four.\n                                               4\n\f    Case: 17-70013    Document: 00514282125        Page: 5   Date Filed: 12/21/2017\n\n\n\n                                    No. 17-70013\nRobertson’s claim that his sentence was based on inaccurate, material evidence\nin violation of the Constitution.\n      In addition to the five areas of concern that Robertson raised in his state\nhabeas petition, the district court recognized that Robertson asserted two\nadditional concerns: (1) Warden Nelson’s false testimony in a different trial\nthat affected her credibility in his trial—a credibility issue that was never\nraised to the jury in his trial—and (2) Warden Nelson testified to a “parade of\nhorribles”—i.e., examples of Robertson’s alleged misconduct, such as altering\na coffee pot to produce boiling water that could be used to scald a guard and\nbreaking headphone wires to transmit alleged gang behavior—with no\nevidence to support the misconduct allegations. The district court determined\nthat, as to these new allegations, “Robertson argues only that the state court’s\ndecision was unreasonable under § 2254(d).” The district court limited itself to\nthe § 2254(d) inquiry and determined that it could not consider the new\nevidence and arguments because they were not submitted to the TCCA on\nappeal. See Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.S. 170, 185 (2011) (“Provisions like §§\n2254(d)(1) and (e)(2) ensure that federal courts sitting in habeas are not an\nalternative forum for trying facts and issues which a prisoner made insufficient\neffort to pursue in state proceedings.” (internal quotations and alterations\nomitted)). Alternatively, the district court determined that Robertson’s new\nallegations lacked merit because Robertson failed to show that Warden\nNelson’s inaccurate testimony in a different trial would have affected or been\nrelevant to her testimony in Robertson’s trial. Robertson’s second new\nallegation also lacked merit, the district court held, because he failed to\nestablish that Warden Nelson’s testimony about his “parade of horribles” was\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\f     Case: 17-70013      Document: 00514282125         Page: 6    Date Filed: 12/21/2017\n\n\n\n                                      No. 17-70013\nfalse or misleading. 3 The district court therefore denied Robertson relief on his\ntwo new issues.\n       Robertson timely appealed the district court’s denial of his petition for\nwrit of habeas corpus. He seeks a COA on his second claim, relating to the\nalleged material, false information upon which his death sentence was based.\n                                            II\n       “[W]hen a habeas corpus petitioner seeks to initiate an appeal of the\ndismissal of a habeas corpus petition . . ., the right to appeal is governed by the\ncertificate of appealability (COA) requirements.” Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S.\n473, 478 (2000). Section 2253 of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct addresses appeals of denials of habeas corpus petitions and provides that\nan “appeal may not be taken” from a final order in a habeas corpus proceeding\nwithout a COA. 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(1). A COA may issue “only if the applicant\nhas made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.” 28\nU.S.C. § 2253(c)(2).\n       “Where a district court has rejected the constitutional claims on the\nmerits, the showing required to satisfy § 2253(c) is straightforward: The\npetitioner must demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district\ncourt’s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.” Slack, 529\nU.S. at 484. “When the district court denies a habeas petition on procedural\ngrounds without reaching the prisoner’s underlying constitutional claim, a\nCOA should issue when the prisoner shows, at least, that jurists of reason\nwould find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial\n\n\n\n\n       3 Robertson also takes issue with the TCCA’s characterization of these alleged\ninfractions as “minor.” The district court determined that Robertson’s complaint about the\nTCCA’s characterization failed to establish that the TCCA unreasonably determined that\nWarden Nelson’s testimony was not false or misleading; thus, Robertson’s claim lacked merit.\n                                             6\n\f    Case: 17-70013     Document: 00514282125      Page: 7   Date Filed: 12/21/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 17-70013\nof a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable\nwhether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.” Id.\n                                       III\n      Robertson asserts that the district court erred in holding that Warden\nNelson’s testimony was not false or misleading, but rather a mere\ndisagreement between experts that is not normally sufficient to demonstrate\nfalsity. “[A] conviction obtained through use of false evidence, known to be such\nby representatives of the State, must fall under the Fourteenth Amendment.”\nNapue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264, 269 (1959). “The principle that a State may not\nknowingly use false evidence, including false testimony, to obtain a tainted\nconviction . . . does not cease to apply merely because the false testimony goes\nonly to the credibility of the witness.” Id. To prove a due process violation under\nNapue, Robertson must establish that: (1) the testimony was false, (2) the\ngovernment knew the testimony was false, and (3) the testimony was material.\nSee Summers v. Dretke, 431 F.3d 861, 872 (5th Cir. 2005) (citing United States\nv. Mason, 293 F.3d 826, 828 (5th Cir. 2002)).\nA. Robertson would be classified as a G3 inmate\n      Warden Nelson testified at Robertson’s punishment trial that if\nRobertson were sentenced to life with parole, he would be classified as a G3\ninmate. However, because Robertson had served more than 10 years of the\nsentence and because he had only minor disciplinary infractions during his\ntime on death row, Robertson would “automatically be categorized as a G2 if\ngiven a life sentence.” Robertson, 2011 WL 1161381, at *7. Robertson relied on\nWoods to refute Warden Nelson’s classification during the hearing on\nRobertson’s motion for a new trial. Id. at *8. Woods, however, only indicated\nthat he “disagreed with Warden Nelson’s use of the word ‘automatic,’ stating\nthat it ‘was not a good choice of words.’” Id. Although Woods disagreed with\nWarden Nelson’s word choice, “the evidence indicate[d] that [Robertson] was\n                                        7\n\f    Case: 17-70013     Document: 00514282125     Page: 8   Date Filed: 12/21/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 17-70013\neligible for G2 status if given a life sentence.” Id. As the district court found,\nthe state court’s determinations appear to be correct. The district court\ncorrectly held that Woods’s mere disagreement with Warden Nelson’s language\nwas not enough to show that the state court unreasonably determined that\nWarden Nelson’s testimony was not false or misleading. See Boyle v. Johnson,\n93 F.3d 180, 186 (5th Cir. 1996).\nB. Prison personnel are underpaid and under-staffed\n      Warden Nelson testified that prison employees are underpaid, that there\nis rapid turnover, and that there is under-staffing to the point where one staff\nmember may be in charge of up to 150 offenders. Robertson, 2011 WL 1161381,\nat *8. In response, Woods testified that his investigation did not indicate that\nthere would have ever been one guard supervising 150 inmates as a typical\nsituation. Id. He further stated that the complexity of the prison system makes\nit nearly impossible to establish a sound guard-to-inmate ratio. Id. Because\nWoods did not present concrete evidence to refute Warden Nelson’s testimony,\nthe district court agreed with the TCCA that the jury would not have been\nmisled or misinformed by the Warden’s testimony. See id.\nC. General population is more violent than administrative segregation\n      Warden Nelson testified at trial that the general population had more\nincidents of violence than administrative segregation or death row. Id. at *9.\nAlthough Woods testified that it is “common sense” that inmates on\nadministrative segregation are more dangerous, there is a higher opportunity\nfor violent incidents in general population simply because there are more\ninmates in general population. Id. Woods ultimately “conclud[ed] that the\nwarden’s testimony did not give a false impression about the amount or nature\nof violence in prison.” Id. The district court necessarily could not have erred in\nagreeing with the TCCA that the Warden’s testimony on this issue was not\n\n\n                                        8\n\f      Case: 17-70013   Document: 00514282125    Page: 9   Date Filed: 12/21/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 17-70013\nfalse or misleading when Robertson’s own expert agreed with the Warden. See\nid.\nD. Inmates’ ability to come and go from their cells to work\n       At trial, Warden Nelson thoroughly described the process used for an\ninmate to travel from his cell to his respective job. See id. at *9–10. She\nexplained that each inmate was accounted for before leaving his cell and then\naccounted for again by his job supervisor. Id. She testified that each inmate\nwas accounted for “eight times in a 24-hour period.” Id. at *9. When Woods\ntestified on this issue, his testimony nearly mimicked that of Warden Nelson’s.\nId. at *10. The district court correctly relied on the TCCA’s determination that\nWoods’s testimony was “substantially identical to that presented by the\nwarden at trial.” Id. Accordingly, Robertson failed to establish that the jury\nrelied on inaccurate information presented by Warden Nelson.\nE. Prison filled with psychopaths\n       As the TCCA aptly summarized, defense counsel objected to a document\non relevance, arguing “that the law requires individualized punishment and\n. . . appellant can’t help it if there are a bunch of psychopaths in prison.” Id.\n(internal quotations and alteration omitted). The court sustained the defense’s\nobjection. Id. Later in Warden Nelson’s examination, the prosecution brought\nup the defense counsel’s comment about prison being filled with psychopaths.\nId. Warden Nelson stated that she remembered the characterization, and\nwhen the prosecution asked if she agreed, Warden Nelson replied, “Yes, sir.”\nId. Robertson relies on Woods’s testimony, “that it would be inaccurate to say\nthat every inmate is a psychopath,” as evidence that Warden Nelson provided\nfalse testimony. Id. But, Woods agreed “that there are probably more\npsychopaths in prison.” Id. The district court agreed with the TCCA that\nWoods’s testimony does not demonstrate that Warden Nelson’s testimony was\nfalse or misleading to the jury. Id. In fact, Woods’s testimony, that it would be\n                                       9\n\f    Case: 17-70013       Document: 00514282125         Page: 10     Date Filed: 12/21/2017\n\n\n\n                                      No. 17-70013\ninaccurate to characterize all inmates as psychopaths, is irrelevant to Warden\nNelson’s testimony—she never even offered such testimony. See id.\nAccordingly, the district court did not err in denying habeas relief on this issue.\nF. Robertson’s two new claims\n       The district court correctly noted that because Robertson failed to\npresent two of his assertions—the warden’s inaccurate testimony in a different\ntrial as evidence she was unreliable and the warden’s speculations as to his\nconduct violations—to the TCCA on direct appeal, these claims are barred from\nconsideration by the federal courts through his habeas petition. Cullen v.\nPinholster established that § 2254 “imposes a limitation on the discretion of\nfederal habeas courts to [consider] new evidence.” 563 U.S. at 185. The record\nsupports the district court’s determination that it could not consider these two\nnew grounds for relief. 4\n                                            IV\n       For the reasons explained above, Robertson failed to demonstrate that\nthe district court erred in determining that the TCCA reasonably concluded\nthat Warden Nelson’s testimony was not false or misleading. Reasonable\njurists would not find the district court’s determination debatable or wrong, see\n\n\n\n       4  The district court also considered the new claims on the merits, as alternative\ngrounds upon which to deny habeas relief. First, the district court determined that Robertson\nfailed to demonstrate how Warden Nelson’s inaccurate testimony would have been relevant\nand admissible to impeach her in Robertson’s case. Thus, the court found the claim lacked\nmerit. On appeal Robertson contends that he wanted to use her inaccurate testimony as\nevidence that she was an unreliable witness. In response, the State contends that Robertson’s\nargument fails because impeachment evidence does not form the basis for a claim of false\ntestimony. See Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154–55 (1972). We refrain from reaching\nthe merits of this argument because it was not properly raised before the state court. See\nPinholster, 563 U.S. at 185–86.\n        Second, the district court determined that Robertson did not exhibit how Warden\nNelson’s testimony regarding his disciplinary infractions was in any way false or misleading.\nHe presents no evidence to demonstrate that her testimony regarding the infractions was\ninaccurate and does not indicate where his expert, Woods, contradicted the Warden’s\ntestimony on this issue. Again, we need not reach the merits of this argument.

Crim. App. Mar. 9, 2011). At\nRobertson’s second sentencing proceeding, the State submitted multiple\nconfessions and other evidence to establish that Robertson was a future danger\nto society. The TCCA summarized the evidence as follows:\n       The State presented evidence of other offenses and bad acts,\n       including evidence that [Robertson], as a young teenager,\n       brought a gun to school and threatened to shoot other students.\n       [Robertson] had strangled cats and had stomped birds to death.\n       He had also committed armed robbery and a wide variety of\n       drug-related offenses. While he was on deferred adjudication for\n       an aggravated robbery, [Robertson] killed 7-Eleven store\n       employee Jeffrey Saunders.\n\nId. (footnotes omitted).\n      The State also relied on its witness, Warden Melodye Nelson. She\ntestified about the prison’s classification system, which ranges from G1 (least\nrestrictive) through G5 (most restrictive), and administrative segregation.\nWarden Nelson testified that an inmate convicted of capital murder who\nreceived a life sentence with the benefit of parole, or who received a sentence\nof 50 years or greater who has not served a minimum of ten years of that\nsentence, would be classified as a G3 prisoner. She further explained that once\nan inmate has served ten years of that sentence, he may be promoted to G2\nstatus. Warden Nelson testified that Robertson, who had served 18 years and\n                                       2\n\f    Case: 17-70013    Document: 00514282125     Page: 3   Date Filed: 12/21/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 17-70013\nhad only minor infractions, would be in the pool to receive the “automatic\npromotion” to G2 status. Warden Nelson testified that prison employees are\nunderpaid and the prisons are under-staffed. She also stated that she believed\nthat the year prior, the prison system was under-staffed by nearly 4,000\ncorrectional officers. She explained the prison’s system for tracking the\nwhereabouts of inmates. As to Robertson specifically, she testified to the minor\nprison infractions which Robertson violated, and she stated that the incidents\nof prison violence were more common in general population than in\nadministrative segregation or death row. After considering the evidence, the\njury sentenced Robertson to death. Id.\n      Robertson filed a motion for a new trial on the grounds that some\ntestimony from the State’s witness was false and misleading. At the motion\nhearing, the Assistant District Attorney first brought to the court’s attention\nnew information regarding certain testimony from Warden Nelson, given in a\ndifferent trial. The State also informed the court that it had turned over the\ninformation to defense counsel. Relevantly, the State informed the court that\nWarden Nelson testified in a different trial that prisoners sentenced to life\nwithout parole could be eligible for G2 prison status. After the trial, however,\nWarden Nelson learned that capital offenders who receive a life without parole\nsentence can never receive a prison status below G3. Both the prosecutor and\ndefense counsel acknowledged, on the record, that Robertson would not have\nbeen eligible for a life without parole sentence, so a rule prohibiting a life-\nsentenced inmate from receiving a less-restrictive classification did not apply\nto Robertson. After considering Robertson’s evidence, including the testimony\nfrom his expert, S.O. Woods, Jr., the court ultimately denied Robertson’s\nmotion for a new trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\f     Case: 17-70013        Document: 00514282125          Page: 4     Date Filed: 12/21/2017\n\n\n\n                                        No. 17-70013\n       On appeal, the TCCA affirmed the sentence.

Crim. App. Jan. 9, 2013).\n       Robertson returned to federal court and filed a petition for writ of habeas\ncorpus, which was denied. In his petition, Robertson made two claims for\nfederal habeas relief, 1 only one of which is relevant to this court: whether his\ndeath sentence was based on materially inaccurate evidence. The district court\nconstrued this claim as a Due Process claim. Robertson asserted five matters\nto which the State’s witness, Warden Nelson, had testified as grounds for relief:\n(1) Robertson would automatically enter the prison system at a G3 level\nprisoner; (2) prison personnel were underpaid and prisons were short-staffed;\n(3) there was more violence in general population than in administrative\nsegregation; (4) inmates are free to travel to and from their cells; 2 and (5)\nprisons are filled with psychopaths. Robertson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1161381</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7–10.\nRobertson relied on his expert, Woods, to prove the falsity of Warden Nelson’s\ntestimony at the hearing on his motion for a new trial. The district court\nconcluded that Robertson’s expert failed to present hard evidence or statistics\nthat contradicted Warden Nelson’s testimony on any matter. Rather, Woods\nexpressed that he disagreed with certain word choices and merely indicated\nthat he thought Warden Nelson was inaccurate. Importantly, Woods never\naccused Warden Nelson of perjury. Accordingly, the district court denied\n\n\n       1  Robertson also asserted that trial counsel failed to adequately investigate and\ndevelop mitigating evidence. The district court dismissed the claim as unexhausted and\nprocedurally barred, and alternatively, denied it for lack of merit notwithstanding any failure\nto exhaust. Robertson does not raise this issue in his motion for a COA.\n        2 The district court classified ground four, from those listed above, as: “a year ago the\n\nTexas Department of Criminal Justice was 4,000 correctional officers short.” However, the\nfourth ground the TCCA reviewed was whether inmates can come and go from their cells to\nwork.

We will address the testimony regarding whether\nthe prison system was under-staffed with ground two and address the inmates’ freedom to\ntravel to and from their cells as ground four.\n                                               4\n\f    Case: 17-70013    Document: 00514282125        Page: 5   Date Filed: 12/21/2017\n\n\n\n                                    No. 17-70013\nRobertson’s claim that his sentence was based on inaccurate, material evidence\nin violation of the Constitution.\n      In addition to the five areas of concern that Robertson raised in his state\nhabeas petition, the district court recognized that Robertson asserted two\nadditional concerns: (1) Warden Nelson’s false testimony in a different trial\nthat affected her credibility in his trial—a credibility issue that was never\nraised to the jury in his trial—and (2) Warden Nelson testified to a “parade of\nhorribles”—i.e., examples of Robertson’s alleged misconduct, such as altering\na coffee pot to produce boiling water that could be used to scald a guard and\nbreaking headphone wires to transmit alleged gang behavior—with no\nevidence to support the misconduct allegations. The district court determined\nthat, as to these new allegations, “Robertson argues only that the state court’s\ndecision was unreasonable under § 2254(d).” The district court limited itself to\nthe § 2254(d) inquiry and determined that it could not consider the new\nevidence and arguments because they were not submitted to the TCCA on\nappeal. See Cullen v. Pinholster, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"213842\"><a href=\"/opinion/213842/cullen-v-pinholster/\"><span class=\"volume\">563</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">170</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 185 (2011) (“Provisions like §§\n2254(d)(1) and (e)(2) ensure that federal courts sitting in habeas are not an\nalternative forum for trying facts and issues which a prisoner made insufficient\neffort to pursue in state proceedings.” (internal quotations and alterations\nomitted)). Alternatively, the district court determined that Robertson’s new\nallegations lacked merit because Robertson failed to show that Warden\nNelson’s inaccurate testimony in a different trial would have affected or been\nrelevant to her testimony in Robertson’s trial. Robertson’s second new\nallegation also lacked merit, the district court held, because he failed to\nestablish that Warden Nelson’s testimony about his “parade of horribles” was\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\f     Case: 17-70013      Document: 00514282125         Page: 6    Date Filed: 12/21/2017\n\n\n\n                                      No. 17-70013\nfalse or misleading. 3 The district court therefore denied Robertson relief on his\ntwo new issues.\n       Robertson timely appealed the district court’s denial of his petition for\nwrit of habeas corpus. He seeks a COA on his second claim, relating to the\nalleged material, false information upon which his death sentence was based.\n                                            II\n       “[W]hen a habeas corpus petitioner seeks to initiate an appeal of the\ndismissal of a habeas corpus petition . . ., the right to appeal is governed by the\ncertificate of appealability (COA) requirements.” Slack v.

Section 2253 of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct addresses appeals of denials of habeas corpus petitions and provides that\nan “appeal may not be taken” from a final order in a habeas corpus proceeding\nwithout a COA. 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(1). A COA may issue “only if the applicant\nhas made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.” 28\nU.S.C. § 2253(c)(2).\n       “Where a district court has rejected the constitutional claims on the\nmerits, the showing required to satisfy § 2253(c) is straightforward: The\npetitioner must demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district\ncourt’s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.” Slack, 529\nU.S. at 484. “When the district court denies a habeas petition on procedural\ngrounds without reaching the prisoner’s underlying constitutional claim, a\nCOA should issue when the prisoner shows, at least, that jurists of reason\nwould find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial\n\n\n\n\n       3 Robertson also takes issue with the TCCA’s characterization of these alleged\ninfractions as “minor.” The district court determined that Robertson’s complaint about the\nTCCA’s characterization failed to establish that the TCCA unreasonably determined that\nWarden Nelson’s testimony was not false or misleading; thus, Robertson’s claim lacked merit.\n                                             6\n\f    Case: 17-70013     Document: 00514282125      Page: 7   Date Filed: 12/21/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 17-70013\nof a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable\nwhether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.” Id.\n                                       III\n      Robertson asserts that the district court erred in holding that Warden\nNelson’s testimony was not false or misleading, but rather a mere\ndisagreement between experts that is not normally sufficient to demonstrate\nfalsity. “[A] conviction obtained through use of false evidence, known to be such\nby representatives of the State, must fall under the Fourteenth Amendment.”\nNapue v.

However, because Robertson had served more than 10 years of the\nsentence and because he had only minor disciplinary infractions during his\ntime on death row, Robertson would “automatically be categorized as a G2 if\ngiven a life sentence.” Robertson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1161381</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7. Robertson relied on\nWoods to refute Warden Nelson’s classification during the hearing on\nRobertson’s motion for a new trial. Id. at *8. Woods, however, only indicated\nthat he “disagreed with Warden Nelson’s use of the word ‘automatic,’ stating\nthat it ‘was not a good choice of words.’” Id. Although Woods disagreed with\nWarden Nelson’s word choice, “the evidence indicate[d] that [Robertson] was\n                                        7\n\f    Case: 17-70013     Document: 00514282125     Page: 8   Date Filed: 12/21/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 17-70013\neligible for G2 status if given a life sentence.” Id. As the district court found,\nthe state court’s determinations appear to be correct. The district court\ncorrectly held that Woods’s mere disagreement with Warden Nelson’s language\nwas not enough to show that the state court unreasonably determined that\nWarden Nelson’s testimony was not false or misleading. See Boyle v.

Prison personnel are underpaid and under-staffed\n      Warden Nelson testified that prison employees are underpaid, that there\nis rapid turnover, and that there is under-staffing to the point where one staff\nmember may be in charge of up to 150 offenders. Robertson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1161381</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\nat *8. In response, Woods testified that his investigation did not indicate that\nthere would have ever been one guard supervising 150 inmates as a typical\nsituation. Id. He further stated that the complexity of the prison system makes\nit nearly impossible to establish a sound guard-to-inmate ratio. Id. Because\nWoods did not present concrete evidence to refute Warden Nelson’s testimony,\nthe district court agreed with the TCCA that the jury would not have been\nmisled or misinformed by the Warden’s testimony. See id.\nC. General population is more violent than administrative segregation\n      Warden Nelson testified at trial that the general population had more\nincidents of violence than administrative segregation or death row. Id. at *9.\nAlthough Woods testified that it is “common sense” that inmates on\nadministrative segregation are more dangerous, there is a higher opportunity\nfor violent incidents in general population simply because there are more\ninmates in general population. Id. Woods ultimately “conclud[ed] that the\nwarden’s testimony did not give a false impression about the amount or nature\nof violence in prison.” Id. The district court necessarily could not have erred in\nagreeing with the TCCA that the Warden’s testimony on this issue was not\n\n\n                                        8\n\f      Case: 17-70013   Document: 00514282125    Page: 9   Date Filed: 12/21/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 17-70013\nfalse or misleading when Robertson’s own expert agreed with the Warden. See\nid.\nD. Inmates’ ability to come and go from their cells to work\n       At trial, Warden Nelson thoroughly described the process used for an\ninmate to travel from his cell to his respective job. See id. at *9–10. She\nexplained that each inmate was accounted for before leaving his cell and then\naccounted for again by his job supervisor. Id. She testified that each inmate\nwas accounted for “eight times in a 24-hour period.” Id. at *9. When Woods\ntestified on this issue, his testimony nearly mimicked that of Warden Nelson’s.\nId. at *10. The district court correctly relied on the TCCA’s determination that\nWoods’s testimony was “substantially identical to that presented by the\nwarden at trial.” Id. Accordingly, Robertson failed to establish that the jury\nrelied on inaccurate information presented by Warden Nelson.\nE. Prison filled with psychopaths\n       As the TCCA aptly summarized, defense counsel objected to a document\non relevance, arguing “that the law requires individualized punishment and\n. . . appellant can’t help it if there are a bunch of psychopaths in prison.” Id.\n(internal quotations and alteration omitted). The court sustained the defense’s\nobjection. Id. Later in Warden Nelson’s examination, the prosecution brought\nup the defense counsel’s comment about prison being filled with psychopaths.\nId. Warden Nelson stated that she remembered the characterization, and\nwhen the prosecution asked if she agreed, Warden Nelson replied, “Yes, sir.”\nId. Robertson relies on Woods’s testimony, “that it would be inaccurate to say\nthat every inmate is a psychopath,” as evidence that Warden Nelson provided\nfalse testimony. Id. But, Woods agreed “that there are probably more\npsychopaths in prison.” Id. The district court agreed with the TCCA that\nWoods’s testimony does not demonstrate that Warden Nelson’s testimony was\nfalse or misleading to the jury. Id. In fact, Woods’s testimony, that it would be\n                                       9\n\f    Case: 17-70013       Document: 00514282125         Page: 10     Date Filed: 12/21/2017\n\n\n\n                                      No. 17-70013\ninaccurate to characterize all inmates as psychopaths, is irrelevant to Warden\nNelson’s testimony—she never even offered such testimony. See id.\nAccordingly, the district court did not err in denying habeas relief on this issue.\nF. Robertson’s two new claims\n       The district court correctly noted that because Robertson failed to\npresent two of his assertions—the warden’s inaccurate testimony in a different\ntrial as evidence she was unreliable and the warden’s speculations as to his\nconduct violations—to the TCCA on direct appeal, these claims are barred from\nconsideration by the federal courts through his habeas petition. Cullen v.\nPinholster established that § 2254 “imposes a limitation on the discretion of\nfederal habeas courts to [consider] new evidence.” 563 U.S. at 185. The record\nsupports the district court’s determination that it could not consider these two\nnew grounds for relief. 4\n                                            IV\n       For the reasons explained above, Robertson failed to demonstrate that\nthe district court erred in determining that the TCCA reasonably concluded\nthat Warden Nelson’s testimony was not false or misleading. Reasonable\njurists would not find the district court’s determination debatable or wrong, see\n\n\n\n       4  The district court also considered the new claims on the merits, as alternative\ngrounds upon which to deny habeas relief. First, the district court determined that Robertson\nfailed to demonstrate how Warden Nelson’s inaccurate testimony would have been relevant\nand admissible to impeach her in Robertson’s case. Thus, the court found the claim lacked\nmerit. On appeal Robertson contends that he wanted to use her inaccurate testimony as\nevidence that she was an unreliable witness. In response, the State contends that Robertson’s\nargument fails because impeachment evidence does not form the basis for a claim of false\ntestimony. See Giglio v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108471\"><a href=\"/opinion/108471/giglio-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">150</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 154–55 (1972). We refrain from reaching\nthe merits of this argument because it was not properly raised before the state court. See\nPinholster, 563 U.S. at 185–86.\n        Second, the district court determined that Robertson did not exhibit how Warden\nNelson’s testimony regarding his disciplinary infractions was in any way false or misleading.\nHe presents no evidence to demonstrate that her testimony regarding the infractions was\ninaccurate and does not indicate where his expert, Woods, contradicted the Warden’s\ntestimony on this issue. Again, we need not reach the merits of this argument. See id.\n                                             10\n\f   Case: 17-70013    Document: 00514282125    Page: 11   Date Filed: 12/21/2017\n\n\n\n                               No. 17-70013\nSlack, 529 U.S. at 484, and mere disagreement between experts is insufficient\nto show that testimony is false or misleading. See Boyle, 93 F.3d at 186.\nAccordingly, Robertson’s petition for a COA is DENIED.\n\n\n\n\n                                     11\n\f</pre>",
