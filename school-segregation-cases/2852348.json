          "plain_text": "In the\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFor the Seventh Circuit\n\nNo. 99-3023\n\nShirley Hoffman,\n\nPlaintiff-Appellant,\n\nv.\n\nCaterpillar, Inc.,\n\nDefendant-Appellee.\n\nAppeal from the United States District Court\nfor the Central District of Illinois.\nNo. 98 C 1062--Joe B. McDade, Chief Judge.\n\nArgued September 6, 2000--Decided July 3, 2001\n\n\n  Before Manion, Kanne, and Diane P. Wood,\nCircuit Judges.\n\n  Kanne, Circuit Judge. Shirley Hoffman,\nwho was born without a left arm below the\nelbow, brought suit alleging that\nCaterpillar, Inc. unlawfully\ndiscriminated against her by failing to\nprovide training on two machines in\nviolation of the Americans with\nDisabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. sec.\n12101 et seq./1 Hoffman alleged both\ndisparate treatment and failure to\naccommodate claims with respect to the\nfirst machine, the high speed scanner,\nwhile she only alleged disparate\ntreatment with respect to the second, the\nmain console. Caterpillar moved for\nsummary judgment and the district court\ngranted the motion. For the reasons\nstated herein, we affirm in part but\nvacate the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment for Caterpillar on\nHoffman’s disparate treatment claim with\nrespect to the high-speed scanner.\n\nI.   History\n\n  Hoffman began working for Caterpillar’s\nOptical Services Department (\"OSD\") in\nApril 1996. The OSD provides digital\nscanning services to all of Caterpillar’s\nbusiness units by scanning documents into\nthe computer and indexing them for future\nreference. Hoffman’s primary job\nresponsibility is indexing--entering data\n\frelating to a scanned image into the\ncomputer. Her job also includes preparing\npapers to be scanned, maintaining the\ncopy machine, running the flatbed scanner\n(a low-speed scanner), and ordering\noffice supplies. Due to the fact that she\nis missing her lower left arm, Hoffman\nneeds several accommodations to perform\nher job, including a typing stand, poster\nputty to raise the function key on her\ncomputer, and a compound called tacky\nfinger to improve finger grip. It is also\nsometimes necessary for Hoffman to have\nthe items in her work area rearranged.\nAlthough Hoffman and Caterpillar dispute\nthe willingness with which Hoffman was\ninitially accommodated (she claims that\nher repeated requests for accommodation\nwere ignored until she was forced to\nbring in her own materials), it is clear\nthat she is now able to perform the\nessential functions of her job.\nCaterpillar concedes that, with the\nexception of her first three weeks on the\njob, Hoffman’s work has been average or\nbetter and that she performs her indexing\njob as fast or faster than a person with\ntwo hands.\n\n  Although Hoffman already performs all of\nthe required functions of her job, she\nhas repeatedly expressed a desire to be\ntrained on two additional pieces of\nequipment. First, Hoffman wishes to\noperate the high-speed scanner, a\nproduction machine that scans forty to\nfifty pages per minute. Operation of the\nhigh-speed scanner is a key position in\nthe OSD because the overall productivity\nof the department depends on the speed at\nwhich documents are scanned. OSD\nemployees in Hoffman’s position are not\nrequired to run the high-speed scanner;\nout of the twenty-one people in the\ndepartment as of March 1999, only seven\nare completely trained to operate it.\nCaterpillar contends that Hoffman’s lack\nof training on the high-speed scanner\ndoes not affect her compensation,\nbenefits, work hours, job title, or\nability to advance within the OSD.\nHoffman disagrees with Caterpillar’s\nclaim that the denial of training does\nnot affect her ability to advance; she\nargues that she will be a more attractive\ncandidate for promotion if she is well-\ntrained. In addition, Hoffman maintains\nthat she should be trained, regardless of\nwhether it affects her ability to\nadvance, because every other employee who\n\fhas expressed an interest in operating\nthe high-speed scanner has received the\nnecessary training to do so.\n\n   Hoffman’s supervisor and the head of\nthe OSD, Lynn Cripe, admits that he\ndenied Hoffman training on the high-speed\nscanner because she only has one hand. He\nclaims that her disability would prevent\nher from being able to properly run the\nhigh-speed scanner because two hands are\nneeded to clear paper jams and to\nstraighten documents as they exit the\nmachine. Paper jams occur frequently on\nthe high-speed scanner--sometimes four to\nfive times an hour--disrupting production\nfor anywhere from a few seconds to\nfifteen minutes depending on the severity\nof the jam. Cripe is concerned that\nHoffman would be unable to run the\nmachine, and even if she were able to\noperate it, that she would be unable to\nmaintain an acceptable speed or clear the\nfrequent paper jams without assistance.\nAlthough Cripe is not fully trained on\nthe high-speed scanner himself, his\nobservation of the machine leads him to\nbelieve that Hoffman, even if able to\nphysically run the machine, would not be\nable to keep up with the production\nstandards set for the department. Cripe\nalso believes that the configuration of\nthe high-speed scanner presents an\nobstacle to Hoffman’s running of the\nmachine because the keyboard which\ncontrols the scanner settings is located\non the left side of the machine--the side\non which Hoffman does not have a hand.\nAccording to Cripe, the settings need to\nbe changed fairly quickly during scanning\nand it would be difficult for Hoffman to\nadjust the settings while continuing to\nfeed the paper with only one arm. Cripe’s\nbelief that Hoffman would be unable to\nrun the high-speed scanner was never\nconfirmed, however, because Hoffman was\nnever given a chance to try.\n\n  Hoffman also challenges Caterpillar’s\ndecision to deny her training on another\npiece of equipment, the main console. The\nmain console is a computer that is used\nto check the accuracy of data entered for\nscanned documents. Caterpillar asserts\nthat Hoffman was denied training on the\nmain console, not because of her\ndisability, but because the main console\nis operated by individuals in the\nreviewer position and Hoffman is not\nqualified for that position because she\n\flacks the necessary communication skills.\n\n\n\nII.    Analysis\n\nA.    Standard of Review\n\n  We review de novo the district court’s\ngrant of summary judgment, drawing our\nown conclusions of law and fact from the\nrecord before us. See Amadio v. Ford\nMotor Co., 238 F.3d 919, 924 (7th Cir.\n2001). Summary judgment is proper when\n\"the pleadings, depositions, answers to\ninterrogatories, and admissions on file,\ntogether with the affidavits, if any,\nshow that there is no genuine issue as to\nany material fact and that the moving\nparty is entitled to a judgment as a\nmatter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c);\nsee also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477\nU.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L.\nEd. 2d 265 (1986). In determining whether\nthere exists any genuine issue of\nmaterial fact, we must construe all facts\nin the light most favorable to the non-\nmoving party and draw all reasonable and\njustifiable inferences in favor of that\nparty. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,\nInc., 477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S. Ct. 2505,\n91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).\n\nB. Denial of Training on the High-Speed\nScanner\n\n  Hoffman claims that Caterpillar’s denial\nof training on the high-speed scanner\nviolated the ADA. The ADA proscribes\ndiscrimination against a qualified\nindividual with a disability \"because of\nthe disability of such individual in\nregard to job application procedures, the\nhiring, advancement, or discharge of\nemployees, employee compensation, job\ntraining, and other terms, conditions,\nand privileges of employment.\" 42 U.S.C.\nsec. 12112(a). As a threshold\nrequirement, Hoffman must first establish\nthat she has a disability as defined by\nthe ADA. Disability is defined as \"(A) a\nphysical or mental impairment that\nsubstantially limits one or more of the\nmajor life activities of such individual;\n(B) a record of such an impairment; or\n(C) being regarded as having such an\nimpairment.\" 42 U.S.C. sec. 12102(2). A\nplaintiff must also demonstrate that she\nis qualified for the position in\nquestion. An individual is qualified if\n\fshe \"satisfies the pre-requisites for the\nposition\" and \"can perform the essential\nfunctions of the position held or\ndesired, with or without reasonable\naccommodation.\" Bombard v. Fort Wayne\nNewspapers, Inc., 92 F.3d 560, 563 (7th\nCir. 1996) (quoting 29 C.F.R. app. sec.\n1630.2(m)).\n\n  Once a plaintiff has established that\nshe is a qualified individual with a\ndisability, she may show discrimination\nin either of two ways: by presenting\nevidence of disparate treatment or by\nshowing a failure to accommodate. See\nSieberns v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 125\nF.3d 1019, 1021-22 (7th Cir. 1997).\nDisparate treatment claims arise from\nlanguage in the ADA prohibiting covered\nentities from \"limiting, segregating, or\nclassifying a job applicant or employee\nin a way that adversely affects the\nopportunities or status of such applicant\nor employee,\" 42 U.S.C. sec. 12112(b)(1),\nwhile failure to accommodate claims stem\nfrom language in the ADA defining\ndiscrimination in part as \"not making\nreasonable accommodations to the known\nphysical or mental limitations of an\notherwise qualified individual.\" 42\nU.S.C. sec. 12112(b)(5)(A).\n\n  A disparate treatment claim under the\nADA is similar to disparate treatment\nclaims under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. sec.\n2000e-2(a), and the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. sec.\n623(a)(1) in that the plaintiff attempts\nto show that she was treated differently\nthan other workers on the basis of a\nprotected characteristic. As with other\nfederal anti-discrimination statutes, an\nADA plaintiff may prove disparate\ntreatment either by presenting direct\nevidence of discrimination, or she may\nprove it indirectly using the McDonnell\nDouglas burden-shifting method. See\nMcDonnell Douglas v. Green, 411 U.S. 792,\n93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973).\nIn order to prevail in the absence of\ndirect evidence, a plaintiff must first\nmake out a prima facie case by showing\nthat: (1) she is disabled within the\nmeaning of the ADA; (2) she was meeting\nthe legitimate employment expectations of\nher employer; (3) she suffered an adverse\nemployment action; and (4) similarly\nsituated employees received more\nfavorable treatment. See Amadio v. Ford\nMotor Co., 238 F.3d 919, 924 (7th Cir.\n2001).\n\f  In failure to accommodate claims, unlike\ndisparate treatment claims, the McDonnell\nDouglas burden-shifting approach is not\nnecessary or appropriate. See Weigel v.\nTarget Stores, 122 F.3d 461, 464 (7th\nCir. 1997). Instead, the plaintiff, in\naddition to showing that she is a\nqualified individual with a disability,\nmust show that the employer was aware of\nher disability and still failed to\nreasonably accommodate it. See Foster v.\nArthur Andersen, LLP, 168 F.3d 1029, 1032\n(7th Cir. 1999). Reasonable\naccommodations may include:\n\n(A) making existing facilities used by\nemployees readily accessible to and\nusable by individuals with disabilities;\nand\n\n(B) job restructuring, part-time or\nmodified work schedules, reassignment to\na vacant position, acquisition or\nmodification of equipment or devices,\nappropriate adjustment or modifications\nof examinations, training materials or\npolicies, the provision of qualified\nreaders or interpreters, and other\nsimilar accommodations for individuals\nwith disabilities.\n\n42 U.S.C. sec. 12111(9).\n\n  Hoffman claims that Caterpillar’s denial\nof training on the high-speed scanner\nconstitutes both disparate treatment and\na failure to accommodate under the ADA.\nBecause Caterpillar does not challenge\nHoffman’s claim that she is a qualified\nindividual with a disability within the\nmeaning of the ADA, we turn first to\nHoffman’s disparate treatment claim.\n\n1.   Disparate Treatment\n\n  At the outset, we note that it is quite\nclear that Caterpillar is not obligated\nto train Hoffman on the high-speed\nscanner if she is not capable of running\nit. The ADA certainly does not require\nemployers to allow employees to use\nequipment that they are unable to\noperate. Nor does anything in the ADA\nmandate that Caterpillar must tolerate a\ndrop in productivity in order to allow\nHoffman to run the high-speed scanner.\nUsually, the question of an employee’s\nability to perform a specific task will\nbe decided at the outset of a disparate\n\ftreatment claim in the context of\ndetermining whether the plaintiff is\n\"qualified\" under the ADA. In situations\nsuch as this one, however, where an\nemployee can clearly perform the\nessential functions of the position but\nalleges disparate treatment as to some\nnon-essential function, the employee’s\nability to perform the task in question\nbecomes relevant at this later stage.\n\n  Viewing the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to Hoffman, we find that there\nis an issue of fact as to whether Hoffman\nwould be able to operate the high-speed\nscanner. Because \"Congress perceived that\nemployers were basing employment\ndecisions on unfounded stereotypes,\"\nSiefken v. Vill. of Arlington Heights, 65\nF.3d 664, 666 (7th Cir. 1995), the ADA\ndiscourages employment decisions \"’based\non stereotypes and generalizations\nassociated with the individual’s\ndisability rather than on the\nindividual’s actual characteristics.’\"\nHoliday v. City of Chattanooga, 206 F.3d\n637, 643 (6th Cir. 2000) (quoting EEOC v.\nPrevo’s Family Mkt., Inc., 135 F.3d 1089,\n1097 (6th Cir. 1998)). The ADA recognizes\nthat a non-disabled person’s instincts\nabout the capabilities of a disabled\nperson are often likely to be incorrect.\nTherefore, a determination that two-\nhanded people use both of their hands to\noperate the high-speed scanner, or even a\ndetermination that most one-handed people\nwould be unable to run it, should not be\nthe end of an employer’s inquiry. In this\ncase, it seems doubtful that Cripe made\nan individualized determination as to\nwhether Hoffman could operate the high-\nspeed scanner because he never gave her a\nchance to try it. Caterpillar claims that\nthe primary reason that Hoffman lacks the\ncapability to run the high-speed scanner\nis that she would be unable to\neffectively clear the frequent paper jams\nthat occur. There is evidence in the\nrecord, however, that Hoffman clears\npaper jams from the copy machine without\nassistance, and Caterpillar presents no\nevidence to suggest that clearing paper\njams from the high-speed scanner is\nsomehow different. Nor does Caterpillar\ncounter Hoffman’s claim that she could\nuse her left arm in a manner similar to\na flat hand to hold down the paper as it\nis being fed into the machine. Therefore,\ndrawing all inferences in favor of\nHoffman, we must assume that she is\n\fphysically capable of running the high-\nspeed scanner. Thus, we move on to the\nsubstance of Hoffman’s disparate\ntreatment claim.\n\n  Hoffman’s supervisor, Cripe, admits that\nhe refused Hoffman’s requests for high-\nspeed scanner training because of her\ndisability. Notwithstanding this\nadmission, the district court granted\nsummary judgment for Caterpillar. The\ncourt determined that because Hoffman\nfailed to show that the denial of\ntraining affected her compensation,\nbenefits, hours worked, job title, or\nability to advance within Caterpillar,\nshe had not shown a materially adverse\nemployment action--one of the elements of\nthe prima facie case under McDonnell\nDouglas. See Hoffman v. Caterpillar Inc.,\nNo. 98-1062 , slip op. at 7 (C.D. Ill.\nJuly 12, 1999) (citing Spencer v. AT&T\nNetwork Sys., No. 94 C 7788, 1998 WL\n397843, at *5 (N.D. Ill. July 13, 1998)\n(finding that denial of training was not\na materially adverse employment action\nbecause plaintiff’s pay, hours, job\ntitle, and quality of her\nresponsibilities were not significantly\naffected); Needy v. Vill. of Woodridge,\nNo. 96 C 5188, 1997 WL 461093 at *6 (N.D.\nIll. Aug. 8 1997) (\"[D]eprivations of\ntraining opportunities do not constitute\nan adverse employment action under Title\nVII.\")).\n\n  On appeal, Hoffman argues that, because\nshe has direct evidence of discriminatory\nintent, the district court erred in\ndetermining that she must proceed using\nthe McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting\napproach. Direct evidence is evidence\nwhich, if believed, \"will prove the\nparticular fact in question without\nreliance upon inference or presumption.\"\nPlair v. E. J. Brach & Sons, Inc., 105\nF.3d 343, 347 (7th Cir. 1997) (quotation\nomitted). In the vast majority of\ndisparate treatment claims, the plaintiff\ndoes not have direct evidence of\ndiscrimination on the basis of some\nprotected characteristic. Our cases\nestablish that making out a prima facie\ncase using the McDonnell Douglas approach\nis an alternative to showing direct\nevidence of an employer’s discriminatory\nintent. See, e.g., Beatty v. Wood, 204\nF.3d 713, 717 (7th Cir. 2000). The\npurpose of the McDonnell Douglas burden-\nshifting approach is to allow a plaintiff\n\fto raise an inference of discrimination\neven in the absence of direct evidence.\nSee Lynch v. Belden & Co., 882 F.2d 262,\n269 (7th Cir. 1989). It would be\nredundant to require a plaintiff to\nutilize the burden-shifting method to\nraise a presumption of discrimination if\nhe or she possesses direct evidence of\ndiscrimination. Our determination that\nHoffman need not use the McDonnell\nDouglas approach does not necessarily\nmean, however, that Hoffman need not show\nthat she has suffered a materially\nadverse employment action. We must\nconsider whether demonstrating a\nmaterially adverse employment action,\naside from being an element of the prima\nfacie case, is a separate substantive\nrequirement of a disparate treatment\nclaim under the ADA.\n\n  Caterpillar contends that it is clear\nthat an alleged denial of training must\nmaterially affect an individual’s employ\nment for it to be actionable. However,\nnone of the authorities that Caterpillar\ncites for the proposition that a denial\nof training must be materially adverse,\nsee Shackelford v. Deloitte & Touche,\nLLP, 190 F.3d 398, 407 (5th Cir. 1999);\nSpencer v. AT&T Network Sys., 1998 WL\n397843, at *5; Needy v. Vill. of\nWoodridge, 1997 WL 461093, at *6, with\nthe exception of Shaner v. Synthes, 204\nF.3d 494, 503 (3d Cir. 2000),/2 deal\nwith denials of job training under the\nADA; rather, they address failure to\ntrain claims under Title VII and the\nADEA. This distinction is relevant\nbecause the ADA specifically prohibits\ndiscrimination in \"regard to job\napplication procedures, the hiring,\nadvancement, or discharge of employees,\nemployee compensation, job training, and\nother terms, conditions, and privileges\nof employment,\" 42 U.S.C. sec. 12112(a)\n(emphasis added), while the parallel\nprovisions of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. sec.\n2000e-2(a), and the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. sec.\n623(a)(1) do not specifically include the\nterm \"job training\" among the prohibited\nactions. If, as Caterpillar suggests, a\nplaintiff must show that a denial of job\ntraining was materially adverse, the\ninclusion of the words \"job training\" in\nthe ADA are mere surplusage because it is\nclear that a materially adverse denial of\njob training would fall under the\nstatute’s prohibition of discrimination\nin \"other terms, conditions, and\n\fprivileges of employment.\" 42 U.S.C. sec.\n12112(a). Such a finding would violate\nthe interpretive principle that, \"every\nword or provision of a statute must, if\npossible, be given some effect.\" Cent.\nStates, Southeast & Southwest Areas\nPension Fund v. Reimer Express World\nCorp., 230 F.3d 934, 942 (7th Cir. 2000).\n\n  Although we acknowledge that several of\nour cases contain language suggesting\nthat an employee must always make a\nseparate affirmative showing of a\nmaterially adverse employment action in\nall ADA cases, see, e.g., Bekker v.\nHumana Health Plan, Inc., 229 F.3d 662,\n670 (2000);/3 Moore v. J.B. Hunt\nTransp., Inc., 221 F.3d 944, 950 (7th\nCir. 2000), none of these cases confront\nthe issue of whether an ADA plaintiff\nalleging denial of job training was also\nrequired to present evidence that the\ndenial was adverse. In addition, a close\nreading of our past employment cases\nreveals that the cases suggesting that\nplaintiffs must show an adverse\nemployment action in every case are not\ndealing with any specifically articulated\nprohibition, but rather with other\n\"terms, conditions, and privileges of\nemployment.\" See, e.g., Crady v. Liberty\nNat’l Bank & Trust Co., 993 F.2d 132, 136\n(7th Cir. 1993) (\"[A] materially adverse\nchange in the terms and conditions of\nemployment must be more disruptive than a\nmere inconvenience or an alteration of\njob responsibilities.\"); Spring v.\nSheboygan Area Sch. Dist., 865 F.2d 883,\n885 (7th Cir. 1989) (\"To establish a\nviolation of the ADEA, therefore, a\nplaintiff must prove that she suffered a\nmaterially adverse change in the terms or\nconditions of her employment.\"). We do\nnot require a plaintiff who is alleging\ndiscrimination with respect to hiring,\ndischarge, or the other enumerated\nactions to also show that the action was\nmaterially adverse.\n\n  In Hunt v. City of Markham, 219 F.3d 649\n(7th Cir. 2000), we noted that \"[t]he\nidea behind requiring proof of an adverse\nemployment action is simply that a\nstatute which forbids employment\ndiscrimination is not intended to reach\nevery bigoted act or gesture that a\nworker might encounter in the workplace.\"\nId. at 653. While we agree that Congress\ndid not intend the ADA to reach every\nbigoted act or gesture, we must believe\n\fthat Congress did intend to reach conduct\nthat it specifically prohibited in the\nstatute. Thus, with respect to employment\nactions specifically enumerated in the\nstatute, a materially adverse employment\naction is not a separate substantive\nrequirement. We agree with Hoffman that,\nbecause the ADA specifically prohibits\ndiscrimination in regard to \"job\ntraining,\" and she has direct evidence of\ndiscriminatory intent, she need not show\nthat the denial of training was\nmaterially adverse./4 See Lane v. Wal-\nMart Stores, Inc., No. Civ. CCB-99-763,\n2000 WL 1481638, at *7 n. 13 (D. Md. Aug.\n28, 2000). Hoffman is not asking for\nspecial training because of her\ndisability, on the contrary, she is\nmerely asking for the same training that\nis available to all other employees who\nrequest it. Cf. Williams v. United Ins.\nCo. of Am., No. 00-3276, 2001 WL 624868\n(7th Cir. June 7, 2001).\n\n  As a practical matter, the class of\npotential ADA plaintiffs affected by\ntoday’s holding is quite small. Direct\nevidence cases, like this one, are very\nrare in the employment discrimination\ncontext because employers are generally\nvery careful to avoid statements that\nsuggest discriminatory intent--whether\ntheir true intentions are discriminatory\nor not. Most plaintiffs only possess\nindirect evidence of discrimination, and\ntherefore must proceed using the\nMcDonnell Douglas burden-shifting method.\nEven if the plaintiff is able to make out\na prima facie case for a denial of\ntraining claim, the defendant will be\nable to avoid liability by articulating a\nlegitimate business reason for the denial\nof training.\n\n  Therefore, because the ADA specifically\nprohibits discrimination in the area of\njob training and Hoffman has direct\nevidence of discrimination, we find that\nthe district court erred in granting\nsummary judgment for the defendant on\nthis issue. In order to recover, Hoffman\nmust show that she is physically capable\nof running the high-speed scanner, but\nshe is not required to make a separate\nshowing that the denial of training was a\nmaterially adverse employment action.\nAccordingly, we will remand in order to\nallow Hoffman to attempt to prove her\ndisparate treatment claim for denial of\ntraining on the high-speed scanner.\n\f2.   Failure to Accommodate\n\n  We next turn to Hoffman’s failure to\naccommodate claim. At issue is whether\nCaterpillar must accommodate Hoffman in\norder to allow her to operate the high-\nspeed scanner if she is unable to do so\nwithout accommodation. As we noted above,\nHoffman has already been accommodated in\norder to perform the essential functions\nof her job. She now requests (assuming\nshe needs it) accommodation so that she\nmay operate the high-speed scanner--a\nnon-essential function of her position.\nWhile it is admirable that Hoffman wants\nto perform job tasks that Caterpillar\ndoes not require her to perform, \"[i]t is\nthe employer’s prerogative to choose a\nreasonable accommodation; an employer is\nnot required to provide the particular\naccommodation that an employee requests.\"\nJay v. Intermet Wagner, Inc., 233 F.3d\n1014, 1017 (7th Cir. 2000); see also\nSchmidt v. Methodist Hosp. of Ind., 89\nF.3d 342, 344 (7th Cir. 1996) (stating\nthat \"[r]easonable accommodation does not\nrequire an employer to provide literally\neverything the disabled employee\nrequests\"). Caterpillar has chosen to\naccommodate Hoffman’s disability by\nletting other employees run the high-\nspeed scanner, and; if Caterpillar is\ncorrect that Hoffman is unable to run the\nhigh-speed scanner without assistance, we\nwill not disturb Caterpillar’s chosen\nmethod of accommodation. The ADA requires\n\"an employer to make whatever\naccommodations are reasonably possible in\nthe circumstances to perform the\nfunctions essential to his position,\"\nMiranda v. Wis. Power & Light Co., 91\nF.3d 1011, 1017 (7th Cir. 1996),\nincluding removing nonessential functions\nfrom the job, see United States E.E.O.C.\nv. AIC Sec. Investigations, Ltd., 55 F.3d\n1276, 1284 (7th Cir. 1995), but nothing\nin the statute requires an employer to\naccommodate the employee so that she may\nperform any nonessential function that\nshe chooses. Nor is Caterpillar required\nto provide an accommodation if the costs\nare disproportionate to the benefits. See\nVande Zande v. State of Wis. Dept. of\nAdmin., 44 F.3d 538, 542-43 (7th Cir.\n1995) (holding that \"an employer is not\nrequired to expend enormous sums in order\nto bring about a trivial improvement in\nthe life of a disabled employee\").\nTherefore, we agree with the district\n\fcourt’s determination that Caterpillar is\nnot required to accommodate Hoffman in\nrunning the high-speed scanner if she is\nunable to operate it by herself.\n\nC. Denial of Training on the Main\nConsole\n\n  Hoffman also claims that Caterpillar\ndiscriminated against her on the basis of\nher disability by denying her training on\nthe main console. In response,\nCaterpillar maintains that operating the\nmain console is not even part of\nHoffman’s indexing position. Further,\nCaterpillar asserts that Hoffman is not\nqualified for the position that is\nresponsible for running the main console\nbecause she lacks the necessary\ncommunication and analytical skills.\n\n  Hoffman does not have direct evidence\nthat she was denied training on the main\nconsole because of her disability.\nTherefore, she must proceed by the\nMcDonnell Douglas burden-shifting method.\nSee McDonnell Douglas v. Green, 411 U.S.\n792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668\n(1973). Under McDonnell Douglas, if she\nis successful in establishing a prima\nfacie case, a rebuttable presumption of\ndiscrimination is created and the burden\nof production shifts to the defendants to\npresent evidence of a legitimate, non-\ndiscriminatory reason for the challenged\naction. See Maarouf v. Walker Mfg. Co.,\n210 F.3d 750, 752 (7th Cir. 2000).\nIfCaterpillar presents evidence of a non-\ninvidious reason for its action, the\nburden then shifts back to Hoffman to\nshow that the articulated reason is in\nfact a pretext for discrimination. See\nid.\n\n   In this case it is unclear whether\nHoffman is complaining that she should\nhave been allowed training on the main\nconsole while staying in her current\nposition or that Caterpillar’s failure to\nmove her into the reviewer position was\ndiscriminatory. We need not determine\nwhich action Hoffman is complaining of,\nhowever, because Caterpillar has\npresented a legitimate, non-\ndiscriminatory reason for its action and\nHoffman has made no effort to rebut it.\nWe will deem an issue waived where the\nargument on appeal is undeveloped and not\nsupported with pertinent authority. See\nGoren v. New Vision Intl., Inc., 156 F.3d\n\f721, 726-27 n. 2 (7th Cir. 1998).\nTherefore, we affirm the district court’s\ndetermination.\n\nIII.   Conclusion\n\n  For the foregoing reasons, the district\ncourt erred in requiring the plaintiff to\nshow that the denial of training on the\nhigh-speed scanner was a materially\nadverse employment action. Therefore, we\nVACATE the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment on Hoffman’s disparate\ntreatment claim with respect to the high-\nspeed scanner and REMAND to allow the\nplaintiff to attempt to show that she is\nentitled to recover on this claim. We\nAFFIRM the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment for Caterpillar with\nrespect to Hoffman’s failure to\naccommodate claim as well as her claim\nfor discriminatory denial of training on\nthe main console.\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n/1 In the district court, Hoffman also alleged\nviolations of the Age Discrimination in Employ-\nment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. sec. 623(a)(1). The\ndistrict court granted summary judgment for the\ndefendant on these claims and Hoffman does not\nappeal that decision here.\n\n/2 Defendant cites Shaner v. Synthes for the propo-\nsition that a plaintiff must show that the train-\ning denied to the plaintiff was necessary to the\nplaintiff’s current job in order to state a\ndisparate treatment claim under the ADA. We\ndisagree with this reading of Shaner. In Shaner,\nthe court addressed whether a particular type of\ncomputer training was necessary for plaintiff’s\nposition solely in order to determine whether\nplaintiff was similarly situated to other workers\nwho had received computer training. See Shaner,\n204 F.3d at 503. The court did not discuss\nwhether or not the denial of training was a\nmaterially adverse employment action. See id.\n\n/3 Judge Manion’s dissent cites Bekker as support\nfor the contention that ADA plaintiffs must\nalways make an affirmative showing of an adverse\nemployment action. The court in Bekker, however,\ndid not discuss the adverse action requirement\nbecause the plaintiff in that case was dis-\ncharged. The only issue in Bekker was whether\nHumana’s termination of Dr. Bekker was justified\nby its concern that she was under the influence\nof alcohol while she was on duty. See Bekker v.\nHumana Health Plan, Inc., 229 F.3d 662, 671 (7th\nCir. 2000).\n\f/4 Our holding today does not suggest that any\nemployee who is denied training of any sort will\nhave a cause of action under the ADA. An employer\nmay deny training to any employee for any reason,\nso long as that reason is not discriminatory. We\nbelieve the dissent’s example of a NASA worker\nrequesting training to be an astronaut is inappo-\nsite. Implicit in this example is the assumption\nthat the employee is neither eligible nor quali-\nfied to be an astronaut. First of all, the ADA\nonly protects employees who are qualified in\nterms of experience and ability to perform a\nparticular job. Furthermore, to prevail in a\ndenial of training claim, an employee must always\nshow that she is eligible for the training in\nquestion. See Macalara v. City of Madison, 224\nF.3d 727, 729 (7th Cir. 2000). Our holding today\neviscerates neither of these requirements. It is\nclear that Hoffman is qualified for her job, and\nthat she is eligible for the requested training.\nWe also believe that the dissent’s example at-\ntempts to blur the line between failure to train\nand failure to promote claims. The employee in\nthe NASA example is not asking for training so\nshe can perform her current job, but is actually\nasking to be placed in a different position, i.e.\nto be promoted. In Hoffman’s case, it is clear\nthat she is asking for training pertinent to the\njob she has now, not for some job she aspires to.\nMoreover, we disagree with the suggestion that\nour holding requires employers to train now and\nask questions--i.e., can the employee adequately\nperform the task at issue--later. On the con-\ntrary, our discussion in Part B.1. makes it clear\nthat an employer is not required to provide\ntraining for a task that the employee is unable\nto perform. Our decision today does not change\nthe timing of the inquiry into the employee’s\nability, it simply requires that the employer\nactually make the inquiry.\n\n\n\n\n MANION, Circuit Judge, dissenting. Although\nShirley Hoffman was born without a left arm below\nthe elbow, with certain accommodations she has\ncompetently performed her job in the Optical\nServices Department at Caterpillar. Among other\ntasks, she operates a low-speed scanner. She has\nrequested several times to be trained on the\nhigh-speed scanner but her supervisor has denied\nsuch training because she has only one hand. The\nquestion before us is whether denying her this\ntraining because she is disabled, even though it\nis clear that not being so trained will not\naffect her salary or her ability to advance, is\na violation of the ADA. Because the district\ncourt properly concluded that Hoffman did not\n\fpresent sufficient evidence to support a triable\nissue of fact that she suffered a materially\nadverse employment action, I respectfully dis-\nsent.\n\n  As a preliminary matter, under the ADA, Hoffman\nwas required to show that she suffered an adverse\nemployment action. Whether she presents direct\nevidence of disability discrimination, or pro-\nceeds under the burden-shifting method set forth\nin McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792\n(1973), she must show all three of the following\nelements to establish her disparate treatment\nclaim: (1) that she is disabled within the mean-\ning of the ADA; (2) that she is qualified to\nperform the essential functions of her job either\nwith or without reasonable accommodation; and\nthat (3) she suffered from an adverse employment\naction because of her disability. Bekker v.\nHumana Health Plan, Inc., 229 F.3d 662, 670 (7th\nCir. 2000). Thus, a plaintiff bringing a dispa-\nrate treatment claim under the ADA must always\nestablish that she suffered an adverse employment\naction. And for Hoffman to survive summary judg-\nment in this case, she must present evidence to\nsupport a genuine issue of fact that her employ-\ner’s denial of her request to be trained on the\nhigh-speed scanner and the main console was an\nadverse employment action. She has not done that,\nand the court is not enforcing that requirement.\nThe court implies that the mere denial of train-\ning is per se an adverse employment action, but\nthere is no authority for that position.\n\n  Furthermore, even though Hoffman alleged that\nshe suffered one of the categories of discrimina-\ntion specifically enumerated in 42 U.S.C. sec.\n12112(a) (i.e., denial of job training), she is\nstill required to show that the denial of train-\ning was an adverse action./1 To illustrate, take\nan extreme example. Suppose someone with Hoff-\nman’s disability works at NASA, where she has\nbeen reasonably accommodated in a job in which\nshe monitors flights. Although she did quality\nwork and was doing well in her career, she always\nwanted to see if she could qualify to be an\nastronaut; after all, other NASA employees with\nsimilar background and experience had been se-\nlected for astronaut training./2 And it would be\na notable achievement for a person with her\ncondition. So she asks her supervisor for the\nopportunity for training as an astronaut, and her\nsupervisor denies the request, saying: \"I can’t\napprove your request because you’re disabled.\"\nAccording to this court’s decision, that employee\nhas a claim under the ADA, even though she\nclearly did not suffer a materially adverse\nchange in her current career and employment\nconditions. The law does not go that far. A\ndenial of training, without more, cannot be\n\flabeled an adverse action that violates the\nADA./3\n\n   Because \"’adverse actions can come in many\nshapes and sizes,’\" Oest v. Illinois Dep’t. of\nCorrections, 240 F.3d 605, 613 (7th Cir. 2001)\n(quoting Knox v. State of Indiana, 93 F.3d 1327,\n1334 (7th Cir. 1996)), we must consider the\nparticular facts of this case to determine wheth-\ner Hoffman has suffered a materially adverse\nemployment action. She has not. The district\ncourt properly granted summary judgment because\nHoffman failed to show that the denial of her\nrequest for training was an adverse action.\nAnother piece of equipment where she wanted\ntraining, the main console, was related to an\nentirely different job. And less than one-third\nof the employees in Hoffman’s department were\nrequired to operate the high-speed scanner. Work\nat the main console and the high-speed scanner\ndiffers from the work she performs at her current\nposition. Hoffman has retained the same pay and\nposition and has lost no benefits, seniority or\nmaterial responsibilities. Moreover, Hoffman did\nnot show that her lack of training at the high-\nspeed scanner and main console prevented her from\nbeing considered for advancement opportunities.\nOperating the high-speed scanner was not a neces-\nsary step for advancement. Caterpillar also\npresented evidence that it promoted other employ-\nees who lacked such training.\n\n  Hoffman needed to show that she suffered an\nadverse action to survive summary judgment on her\ndisparate treatment claim. Simply showing that\nshe was denied job training, a category where the\nstatute specifically prohibits discrimination, is\nnot enough. Because Hoffman has not shown that\nshe suffered an adverse employment action, I\nwould affirm the district court.\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n/1 The court cites only to a footnote in Lane v.\nWal-Mart Stores, Inc., No. Civ. CCB-99-763, 2000\nWL 1481638, at *7 n. 13 (D. Md. Aug. 28, 2000),\nan opinion from the district court of Maryland,\nand that footnote cites only generally to the ADA\nstatute. See contra Atkinson v. Wiley Sanders\nTruck Lines, Inc., 45 F.Supp.2d 1288, 1294 (M.D.\nAla. 1998) (it was not an adverse employment\naction to deny an employee’s request to partici-\npate in a training course because of the employ-\nee’s disability).\n\n/2 Similar to the hypothetical NASA employee, Hoff-\nman aspires to be trained on two machines that\nher current position does not require her to\noperate. Although the court states in footnote 4\nof its decision that Hoffman is seeking training\n\f\"pertinent to the job she has now,\" the court has\nalso acknowledged throughout its decision that\n\"Hoffman already performs all of the required\nfunctions of her job\"; that \"OSD employees in\nHoffman’s position are not required to run the\nhigh-speed scanner\"; and that the high-speed\nscanner is \"a non-essential function of her\nposition.\" We also note that unlike the plaintiff\nin Williams v. United Ins. Co. of Am., 00-3276,\n2001 WL 624868 (7th Cir. June 7, 2001), Hoffman\ndoes not direct us to anything in the record that\nindicates that training on the high-speed scanner\nwas made available to all of the employees in her\ndepartment. Such training was not necessary for\npromotion or advancement, and it is undisputed\nthat less than a third of the employees in\nHoffman’s department have received such training.\n\n/3 As the court notes (Part B.2, p. 15), if Cater-\npillar is correct that Hoffman is unable to run\nthe high-speed scanner without assistance, it\nwill not disturb the decision to \"accommodate\nHoffman’s disability by letting other employees\nrun the high-speed scanner.\" But the only way\nCaterpillar can be \"correct\" is to first train\nher on the scanner and then, with training com-\npleted, determine whether she can operate it\nsatisfactorily. This could be a costly experiment\nwhen she has suffered no adverse action in her\npresent job.\n\f",

Shirley Hoffman,\nwho was born without a left arm below the\nelbow, brought suit alleging that\nCaterpillar, Inc. unlawfully\ndiscriminated against her by failing to\nprovide training on two machines in\nviolation of the Americans with\nDisabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. sec.\n12101 et seq./1 Hoffman alleged both\ndisparate treatment and failure to\naccommodate claims with respect to the\nfirst machine, the high speed scanner,\nwhile she only alleged disparate\ntreatment with respect to the second, the\nmain console. Caterpillar moved for\nsummary judgment and the district court\ngranted the motion. For the reasons\nstated herein, we affirm in part but\nvacate the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment for Caterpillar on\nHoffman’s disparate treatment claim with\nrespect to the high-speed scanner.\n\nI.   History\n\n  Hoffman began working for Caterpillar’s\nOptical Services Department (\"OSD\") in\nApril 1996. The OSD provides digital\nscanning services to all of Caterpillar’s\nbusiness units by scanning documents into\nthe computer and indexing them for future\nreference. Hoffman’s primary job\nresponsibility is indexing--entering data\n\frelating to a scanned image into the\ncomputer. Her job also includes preparing\npapers to be scanned, maintaining the\ncopy machine, running the flatbed scanner\n(a low-speed scanner), and ordering\noffice supplies. Due to the fact that she\nis missing her lower left arm, Hoffman\nneeds several accommodations to perform\nher job, including a typing stand, poster\nputty to raise the function key on her\ncomputer, and a compound called tacky\nfinger to improve finger grip. It is also\nsometimes necessary for Hoffman to have\nthe items in her work area rearranged.\nAlthough Hoffman and Caterpillar dispute\nthe willingness with which Hoffman was\ninitially accommodated (she claims that\nher repeated requests for accommodation\nwere ignored until she was forced to\nbring in her own materials), it is clear\nthat she is now able to perform the\nessential functions of her job.\nCaterpillar concedes that, with the\nexception of her first three weeks on the\njob, Hoffman’s work has been average or\nbetter and that she performs her indexing\njob as fast or faster than a person with\ntwo hands.\n\n  Although Hoffman already performs all of\nthe required functions of her job, she\nhas repeatedly expressed a desire to be\ntrained on two additional pieces of\nequipment. First, Hoffman wishes to\noperate the high-speed scanner, a\nproduction machine that scans forty to\nfifty pages per minute. Operation of the\nhigh-speed scanner is a key position in\nthe OSD because the overall productivity\nof the department depends on the speed at\nwhich documents are scanned. OSD\nemployees in Hoffman’s position are not\nrequired to run the high-speed scanner;\nout of the twenty-one people in the\ndepartment as of March 1999, only seven\nare completely trained to operate it.\nCaterpillar contends that Hoffman’s lack\nof training on the high-speed scanner\ndoes not affect her compensation,\nbenefits, work hours, job title, or\nability to advance within the OSD.\nHoffman disagrees with Caterpillar’s\nclaim that the denial of training does\nnot affect her ability to advance; she\nargues that she will be a more attractive\ncandidate for promotion if she is well-\ntrained. In addition, Hoffman maintains\nthat she should be trained, regardless of\nwhether it affects her ability to\nadvance, because every other employee who\n\fhas expressed an interest in operating\nthe high-speed scanner has received the\nnecessary training to do so.\n\n   Hoffman’s supervisor and the head of\nthe OSD, Lynn Cripe, admits that he\ndenied Hoffman training on the high-speed\nscanner because she only has one hand. He\nclaims that her disability would prevent\nher from being able to properly run the\nhigh-speed scanner because two hands are\nneeded to clear paper jams and to\nstraighten documents as they exit the\nmachine. Paper jams occur frequently on\nthe high-speed scanner--sometimes four to\nfive times an hour--disrupting production\nfor anywhere from a few seconds to\nfifteen minutes depending on the severity\nof the jam. Cripe is concerned that\nHoffman would be unable to run the\nmachine, and even if she were able to\noperate it, that she would be unable to\nmaintain an acceptable speed or clear the\nfrequent paper jams without assistance.\nAlthough Cripe is not fully trained on\nthe high-speed scanner himself, his\nobservation of the machine leads him to\nbelieve that Hoffman, even if able to\nphysically run the machine, would not be\nable to keep up with the production\nstandards set for the department. Cripe\nalso believes that the configuration of\nthe high-speed scanner presents an\nobstacle to Hoffman’s running of the\nmachine because the keyboard which\ncontrols the scanner settings is located\non the left side of the machine--the side\non which Hoffman does not have a hand.\nAccording to Cripe, the settings need to\nbe changed fairly quickly during scanning\nand it would be difficult for Hoffman to\nadjust the settings while continuing to\nfeed the paper with only one arm. Cripe’s\nbelief that Hoffman would be unable to\nrun the high-speed scanner was never\nconfirmed, however, because Hoffman was\nnever given a chance to try.\n\n  Hoffman also challenges Caterpillar’s\ndecision to deny her training on another\npiece of equipment, the main console. The\nmain console is a computer that is used\nto check the accuracy of data entered for\nscanned documents. Caterpillar asserts\nthat Hoffman was denied training on the\nmain console, not because of her\ndisability, but because the main console\nis operated by individuals in the\nreviewer position and Hoffman is not\nqualified for that position because she\n\flacks the necessary communication skills.\n\n\n\nII.    Analysis\n\nA.    Standard of Review\n\n  We review de novo the district court’s\ngrant of summary judgment, drawing our\nown conclusions of law and fact from the\nrecord before us. See Amadio v.

Denial of Training on the High-Speed\nScanner\n\n  Hoffman claims that Caterpillar’s denial\nof training on the high-speed scanner\nviolated the ADA. The ADA proscribes\ndiscrimination against a qualified\nindividual with a disability \"because of\nthe disability of such individual in\nregard to job application procedures, the\nhiring, advancement, or discharge of\nemployees, employee compensation, job\ntraining, and other terms, conditions,\nand privileges of employment.\" 42 U.S.C.\nsec. 12112(a). As a threshold\nrequirement, Hoffman must first establish\nthat she has a disability as defined by\nthe ADA. Disability is defined as \"(A) a\nphysical or mental impairment that\nsubstantially limits one or more of the\nmajor life activities of such individual;\n(B) a record of such an impairment; or\n(C) being regarded as having such an\nimpairment.\" 42 U.S.C. sec. 12102(2). A\nplaintiff must also demonstrate that she\nis qualified for the position in\nquestion. An individual is qualified if\n\fshe \"satisfies the pre-requisites for the\nposition\" and \"can perform the essential\nfunctions of the position held or\ndesired, with or without reasonable\naccommodation.\" Bombard v. Fort Wayne\nNewspapers, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"723975\"><a href=\"/opinion/723975/peter-h-bombard-v-fort-wayne-newspapers-incorporated/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 563 (7th\nCir. 1996) (quoting 29 C.F.R. app. sec.\n1630.2(m)).\n\n  Once a plaintiff has established that\nshe is a qualified individual with a\ndisability, she may show discrimination\nin either of two ways: by presenting\nevidence of disparate treatment or by\nshowing a failure to accommodate. See\nSieberns v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746764\"><a href=\"/opinion/746764/monte-k-sieberns-v-wal-mart-stores-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1019</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1021-22 (7th Cir. 1997).\nDisparate treatment claims arise from\nlanguage in the ADA prohibiting covered\nentities from \"limiting, segregating, or\nclassifying a job applicant or employee\nin a way that adversely affects the\nopportunities or status of such applicant\nor employee,\" 42 U.S.C. sec. 12112(b)(1),\nwhile failure to accommodate claims stem\nfrom language in the ADA defining\ndiscrimination in part as \"not making\nreasonable accommodations to the known\nphysical or mental limitations of an\notherwise qualified individual.\" 42\nU.S.C. sec. 12112(b)(5)(A).\n\n  A disparate treatment claim under the\nADA is similar to disparate treatment\nclaims under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. sec.\n2000e-2(a), and the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. sec.\n623(a)(1) in that the plaintiff attempts\nto show that she was treated differently\nthan other workers on the basis of a\nprotected characteristic. As with other\nfederal anti-discrimination statutes, an\nADA plaintiff may prove disparate\ntreatment either by presenting direct\nevidence of discrimination, or she may\nprove it indirectly using the McDonnell\nDouglas burden-shifting method. See\nMcDonnell Douglas v. Green, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Disparate Treatment\n\n  At the outset, we note that it is quite\nclear that Caterpillar is not obligated\nto train Hoffman on the high-speed\nscanner if she is not capable of running\nit. The ADA certainly does not require\nemployers to allow employees to use\nequipment that they are unable to\noperate. Nor does anything in the ADA\nmandate that Caterpillar must tolerate a\ndrop in productivity in order to allow\nHoffman to run the high-speed scanner.\nUsually, the question of an employee’s\nability to perform a specific task will\nbe decided at the outset of a disparate\n\ftreatment claim in the context of\ndetermining whether the plaintiff is\n\"qualified\" under the ADA. In situations\nsuch as this one, however, where an\nemployee can clearly perform the\nessential functions of the position but\nalleges disparate treatment as to some\nnon-essential function, the employee’s\nability to perform the task in question\nbecomes relevant at this later stage.\n\n  Viewing the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to Hoffman, we find that there\nis an issue of fact as to whether Hoffman\nwould be able to operate the high-speed\nscanner. Because \"Congress perceived that\nemployers were basing employment\ndecisions on unfounded stereotypes,\"\nSiefken v.

The ADA recognizes\nthat a non-disabled person’s instincts\nabout the capabilities of a disabled\nperson are often likely to be incorrect.\nTherefore, a determination that two-\nhanded people use both of their hands to\noperate the high-speed scanner, or even a\ndetermination that most one-handed people\nwould be unable to run it, should not be\nthe end of an employer’s inquiry. In this\ncase, it seems doubtful that Cripe made\nan individualized determination as to\nwhether Hoffman could operate the high-\nspeed scanner because he never gave her a\nchance to try it. Caterpillar claims that\nthe primary reason that Hoffman lacks the\ncapability to run the high-speed scanner\nis that she would be unable to\neffectively clear the frequent paper jams\nthat occur. There is evidence in the\nrecord, however, that Hoffman clears\npaper jams from the copy machine without\nassistance, and Caterpillar presents no\nevidence to suggest that clearing paper\njams from the high-speed scanner is\nsomehow different. Nor does Caterpillar\ncounter Hoffman’s claim that she could\nuse her left arm in a manner similar to\na flat hand to hold down the paper as it\nis being fed into the machine. Therefore,\ndrawing all inferences in favor of\nHoffman, we must assume that she is\n\fphysically capable of running the high-\nspeed scanner. Thus, we move on to the\nsubstance of Hoffman’s disparate\ntreatment claim.\n\n  Hoffman’s supervisor, Cripe, admits that\nhe refused Hoffman’s requests for high-\nspeed scanner training because of her\ndisability. Notwithstanding this\nadmission, the district court granted\nsummary judgment for Caterpillar. The\ncourt determined that because Hoffman\nfailed to show that the denial of\ntraining affected her compensation,\nbenefits, hours worked, job title, or\nability to advance within Caterpillar,\nshe had not shown a materially adverse\nemployment action--one of the elements of\nthe prima facie case under McDonnell\nDouglas.

It would be\nredundant to require a plaintiff to\nutilize the burden-shifting method to\nraise a presumption of discrimination if\nhe or she possesses direct evidence of\ndiscrimination.

June 7, 2001).\n\n  As a practical matter, the class of\npotential ADA plaintiffs affected by\ntoday’s holding is quite small. Direct\nevidence cases, like this one, are very\nrare in the employment discrimination\ncontext because employers are generally\nvery careful to avoid statements that\nsuggest discriminatory intent--whether\ntheir true intentions are discriminatory\nor not. Most plaintiffs only possess\nindirect evidence of discrimination, and\ntherefore must proceed using the\nMcDonnell Douglas burden-shifting method.\nEven if the plaintiff is able to make out\na prima facie case for a denial of\ntraining claim, the defendant will be\nable to avoid liability by articulating a\nlegitimate business reason for the denial\nof training.\n\n  Therefore, because the ADA specifically\nprohibits discrimination in the area of\njob training and Hoffman has direct\nevidence of discrimination, we find that\nthe district court erred in granting\nsummary judgment for the defendant on\nthis issue. In order to recover, Hoffman\nmust show that she is physically capable\nof running the high-speed scanner, but\nshe is not required to make a separate\nshowing that the denial of training was a\nmaterially adverse employment action.\nAccordingly, we will remand in order to\nallow Hoffman to attempt to prove her\ndisparate treatment claim for denial of\ntraining on the high-speed scanner.\n\f2.   Failure to Accommodate\n\n  We next turn to Hoffman’s failure to\naccommodate claim. At issue is whether\nCaterpillar must accommodate Hoffman in\norder to allow her to operate the high-\nspeed scanner if she is unable to do so\nwithout accommodation. As we noted above,\nHoffman has already been accommodated in\norder to perform the essential functions\nof her job. She now requests (assuming\nshe needs it) accommodation so that she\nmay operate the high-speed scanner--a\nnon-essential function of her position.\nWhile it is admirable that Hoffman wants\nto perform job tasks that Caterpillar\ndoes not require her to perform, \"[i]t is\nthe employer’s prerogative to choose a\nreasonable accommodation; an employer is\nnot required to provide the particular\naccommodation that an employee requests.\"\nJay v.

In response,\nCaterpillar maintains that operating the\nmain console is not even part of\nHoffman’s indexing position.

Therefore, we\nVACATE the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment on Hoffman’s disparate\ntreatment claim with respect to the high-\nspeed scanner and REMAND to allow the\nplaintiff to attempt to show that she is\nentitled to recover on this claim. We\nAFFIRM the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment for Caterpillar with\nrespect to Hoffman’s failure to\naccommodate claim as well as her claim\nfor discriminatory denial of training on\nthe main console.\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n/1 In the district court, Hoffman also alleged\nviolations of the Age Discrimination in Employ-\nment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. sec. 623(a)(1). The\ndistrict court granted summary judgment for the\ndefendant on these claims and Hoffman does not\nappeal that decision here.\n\n/2 Defendant cites Shaner v. Synthes for the propo-\nsition that a plaintiff must show that the train-\ning denied to the plaintiff was necessary to the\nplaintiff’s current job in order to state a\ndisparate treatment claim under the ADA. We\ndisagree with this reading of Shaner. In Shaner,\nthe court addressed whether a particular type of\ncomputer training was necessary for plaintiff’s\nposition solely in order to determine whether\nplaintiff was similarly situated to other workers\nwho had received computer training. See Shaner,\n204 F.3d at 503. The court did not discuss\nwhether or not the denial of training was a\nmaterially adverse employment action. See id.\n\n/3 Judge Manion’s dissent cites Bekker as support\nfor the contention that ADA plaintiffs must\nalways make an affirmative showing of an adverse\nemployment action. The court in Bekker, however,\ndid not discuss the adverse action requirement\nbecause the plaintiff in that case was dis-\ncharged. The only issue in Bekker was whether\nHumana’s termination of Dr. Bekker was justified\nby its concern that she was under the influence\nof alcohol while she was on duty. See Bekker v.\nHumana Health Plan, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770761\"><a href=\"/opinion/770761/stephanie-bekker-v-humana-health-plan-incorporated/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">662</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 671 (7th\nCir. 2000).\n\f/4 Our holding today does not suggest that any\nemployee who is denied training of any sort will\nhave a cause of action under the ADA. An employer\nmay deny training to any employee for any reason,\nso long as that reason is not discriminatory. We\nbelieve the dissent’s example of a NASA worker\nrequesting training to be an astronaut is inappo-\nsite. Implicit in this example is the assumption\nthat the employee is neither eligible nor quali-\nfied to be an astronaut. First of all, the ADA\nonly protects employees who are qualified in\nterms of experience and ability to perform a\nparticular job. Furthermore, to prevail in a\ndenial of training claim, an employee must always\nshow that she is eligible for the training in\nquestion. See Macalara v. City of Madison, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770171\"><a href=\"/opinion/770171/nikolas-malacara-v-city-of-madison-city-of-madison-water-utility/\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 729 (7th Cir. 2000). Our holding today\neviscerates neither of these requirements. It is\nclear that Hoffman is qualified for her job, and\nthat she is eligible for the requested training.\nWe also believe that the dissent’s example at-\ntempts to blur the line between failure to train\nand failure to promote claims. The employee in\nthe NASA example is not asking for training so\nshe can perform her current job, but is actually\nasking to be placed in a different position, i.e.\nto be promoted. In Hoffman’s case, it is clear\nthat she is asking for training pertinent to the\njob she has now, not for some job she aspires to.\nMoreover, we disagree with the suggestion that\nour holding requires employers to train now and\nask questions--i.e., can the employee adequately\nperform the task at issue--later. On the con-\ntrary, our discussion in Part B.1. makes it clear\nthat an employer is not required to provide\ntraining for a task that the employee is unable\nto perform. Our decision today does not change\nthe timing of the inquiry into the employee’s\nability, it simply requires that the employer\nactually make the inquiry.\n\n\n\n\n MANION, Circuit Judge, dissenting. Although\nShirley Hoffman was born without a left arm below\nthe elbow, with certain accommodations she has\ncompetently performed her job in the Optical\nServices Department at Caterpillar. Among other\ntasks, she operates a low-speed scanner. She has\nrequested several times to be trained on the\nhigh-speed scanner but her supervisor has denied\nsuch training because she has only one hand. The\nquestion before us is whether denying her this\ntraining because she is disabled, even though it\nis clear that not being so trained will not\naffect her salary or her ability to advance, is\na violation of the ADA. Because the district\ncourt properly concluded that Hoffman did not\n\fpresent sufficient evidence to support a triable\nissue of fact that she suffered a materially\nadverse employment action, I respectfully dis-\nsent.\n\n  As a preliminary matter, under the ADA, Hoffman\nwas required to show that she suffered an adverse\nemployment action. Whether she presents direct\nevidence of disability discrimination, or pro-\nceeds under the burden-shifting method set forth\nin McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1973), she must show all three of the following\nelements to establish her disparate treatment\nclaim: (1) that she is disabled within the mean-\ning of the ADA; (2) that she is qualified to\nperform the essential functions of her job either\nwith or without reasonable accommodation; and\nthat (3) she suffered from an adverse employment\naction because of her disability. Bekker v.\nHumana Health Plan, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770761\"><a href=\"/opinion/770761/stephanie-bekker-v-humana-health-plan-incorporated/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">662</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 670 (7th\nCir. 2000). Thus, a plaintiff bringing a dispa-\nrate treatment claim under the ADA must always\nestablish that she suffered an adverse employment\naction. And for Hoffman to survive summary judg-\nment in this case, she must present evidence to\nsupport a genuine issue of fact that her employ-\ner’s denial of her request to be trained on the\nhigh-speed scanner and the main console was an\nadverse employment action. She has not done that,\nand the court is not enforcing that requirement.\nThe court implies that the mere denial of train-\ning is per se an adverse employment action, but\nthere is no authority for that position.\n\n  Furthermore, even though Hoffman alleged that\nshe suffered one of the categories of discrimina-\ntion specifically enumerated in 42 U.S.C. sec.\n12112(a) (i.e., denial of job training), she is\nstill required to show that the denial of train-\ning was an adverse action./1 To illustrate, take\nan extreme example. Suppose someone with Hoff-\nman’s disability works at NASA, where she has\nbeen reasonably accommodated in a job in which\nshe monitors flights. Although she did quality\nwork and was doing well in her career, she always\nwanted to see if she could qualify to be an\nastronaut; after all, other NASA employees with\nsimilar background and experience had been se-\nlected for astronaut training./2 And it would be\na notable achievement for a person with her\ncondition. So she asks her supervisor for the\nopportunity for training as an astronaut, and her\nsupervisor denies the request, saying: \"I can’t\napprove your request because you’re disabled.\"\nAccording to this court’s decision, that employee\nhas a claim under the ADA, even though she\nclearly did not suffer a materially adverse\nchange in her current career and employment\nconditions. The law does not go that far. A\ndenial of training, without more, cannot be\n\flabeled an adverse action that violates the\nADA./3\n\n   Because \"’adverse actions can come in many\nshapes and sizes,’\" Oest v. Illinois Dep’t. of\nCorrections, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772111\"><a href=\"/opinion/772111/faye-m-oest-v-illinois-department-of-corrections/\"><span class=\"volume\">240</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">605</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 613 (7th Cir. 2001)\n(quoting Knox v. State of Indiana, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"725021\"><a href=\"/opinion/725021/71-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1519-68-empl-prac-dec-p-44268-kristi/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1327</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1334 (7th Cir. 1996)), we must consider the\nparticular facts of this case to determine wheth-\ner Hoffman has suffered a materially adverse\nemployment action. She has not. The district\ncourt properly granted summary judgment because\nHoffman failed to show that the denial of her\nrequest for training was an adverse action.\nAnother piece of equipment where she wanted\ntraining, the main console, was related to an\nentirely different job. And less than one-third\nof the employees in Hoffman’s department were\nrequired to operate the high-speed scanner. Work\nat the main console and the high-speed scanner\ndiffers from the work she performs at her current\nposition. Hoffman has retained the same pay and\nposition and has lost no benefits, seniority or\nmaterial responsibilities. Moreover, Hoffman did\nnot show that her lack of training at the high-\nspeed scanner and main console prevented her from\nbeing considered for advancement opportunities.\nOperating the high-speed scanner was not a neces-\nsary step for advancement. Caterpillar also\npresented evidence that it promoted other employ-\nees who lacked such training.\n\n  Hoffman needed to show that she suffered an\nadverse action to survive summary judgment on her\ndisparate treatment claim. Simply showing that\nshe was denied job training, a category where the\nstatute specifically prohibits discrimination, is\nnot enough. Because Hoffman has not shown that\nshe suffered an adverse employment action, I\nwould affirm the district court.\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n/1 The court cites only to a footnote in Lane v.\nWal-Mart Stores, Inc., No. Civ. CCB-99-763, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1481638</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7 n. 13 (D. Md. Aug. 28, 2000),\nan opinion from the district court of Maryland,\nand that footnote cites only generally to the ADA\nstatute. See contra Atkinson v. Wiley Sanders\nTruck Lines, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2498517\"><a href=\"/opinion/2498517/atkinson-v-wiley-sanders-truck-lines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1288</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1294 (M.D.\nAla. 1998) (it was not an adverse employment\naction to deny an employee’s request to partici-\npate in a training course because of the employ-\nee’s disability).\n\n/2 Similar to the hypothetical NASA employee, Hoff-\nman aspires to be trained on two machines that\nher current position does not require her to\noperate. Although the court states in footnote 4\nof its decision that Hoffman is seeking training\n\f\"pertinent to the job she has now,\" the court has\nalso acknowledged throughout its decision that\n\"Hoffman already performs all of the required\nfunctions of her job\"; that \"OSD employees in\nHoffman’s position are not required to run the\nhigh-speed scanner\"; and that the high-speed\nscanner is \"a non-essential function of her\nposition.\" We also note that unlike the plaintiff\nin Williams v. United Ins. Co. of Am., 00-3276,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2001</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">624868</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. June 7, 2001), Hoffman\ndoes not direct us to anything in the record that\nindicates that training on the high-speed scanner\nwas made available to all of the employees in her\ndepartment. Such training was not necessary for\npromotion or advancement, and it is undisputed\nthat less than a third of the employees in\nHoffman’s department have received such training.\n\n/3 As the court notes (Part B.2, p. 15), if Cater-\npillar is correct that Hoffman is unable to run\nthe high-speed scanner without assistance, it\nwill not disturb the decision to \"accommodate\nHoffman’s disability by letting other employees\nrun the high-speed scanner.\" But the only way\nCaterpillar can be \"correct\" is to first train\nher on the scanner and then, with training com-\npleted, determine whether she can operate it\nsatisfactorily. This could be a costly experiment\nwhen she has suffered no adverse action in her\npresent job.\n\f</pre>",
