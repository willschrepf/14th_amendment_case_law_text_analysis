INTRODUCTION\n        The Sarpy County District Court dissolved the marriage between Dena M. Araujo and\nDavid R. Araujo. A decree was entered from which Dena has appealed and assigned numerous\nerrors related to parenting time and other contact with the children, child support, property, debts,\ncontempt, military retirement pay, alimony, and guardian ad litem (GAL) and attorney fees. We\naffirm the decree as modified herein.\n                                       II. BACKGROUND\n       Dena and David were married in June 1997; both were 32 years of age at that time. They\nhad four children, namely: Tyler (born 1997), Zachary (born 1999), Dylan (born 2001), and Natalie\n(born 2004). David had been in the Marine Corps as a computer programmer for four years, and\n\n\n\n                                                -1-\n\fthen joined the Air Force as an accountant. He then transferred and worked in space administration\nand operations until his retirement in 2006. After that, he worked with a company called SAIC at\nStrategic Command headquarters doing planning and operations. Dena attended 3½ years of\ncollege, but did not obtain a degree. She speaks English and Swedish, and has worked as a\nchiropractic assistant, worked in a department store at a cosmetics counter, and worked for a\ncompany organizing events in different places. At the time of trial, she was working as a “para”\nfor special education students earning $11.27 per hour.\n        In 2006, David was diagnosed with a sphincter of oddi dysfunction. According to David,\nthis was “an unfortunate side effect” of having his gallbladder removed in 2005. At the time of his\ngallbladder surgery, he was diagnosed with pancreatitis. In 2009, David had a pancreatic attack\nthat put him in the hospital for a month; he lost significant weight and was unable to work for a\ncouple of months. David’s pancreatitis kept getting worse; there were times he could do things and\ntimes he could not.\n        In May 2013, Dena filed a complaint for legal separation. The following month, David\nfiled an answer and “counter-complaint” for dissolution of the marriage. Dena asked for sole legal\nand physical custody of the children, and while David pled he was the fit and proper person to\nhave legal and physical custody of the children, his prayer asked that he and Dena be granted legal\nand physical custody. Each asked for child support and an equitable division of their assets and\ndebts. Dena also asked for the parties to share medical and childcare expenses. Dena requested\nthat David’s parenting time be supervised, that a GAL be appointed for the children, and that David\nbe ordered to undergo a psychological evaluation. Dena also asked for spousal support. David\nrequested a non-hypothecation order restraining both parties from certain actions related to their\nreal and personal property, except in the usual course of business or for the necessities of life.\n        In June 2013, David went to visit his brother in Utah and reconnected with a past friend,\nKimberli Doxey. By July, David and Kimberli had discussed Kimberli moving to Nebraska to help\nDavid after a surgery he had planned in December. By the end of 2013, David rented a home for\nKimberli and two of her children, Andrew Doxey (age 25) and Bridger Doxey (age 15). According\nto Kimberli, Andrew quit his job in Utah to help her provide 24-hour care for David.\n        In December 2013, David had surgery to remove his pancreas, spleen, and part of his\nstomach. Complications from surgery caused stomach fluid to leak into his abdominal cavity and\nit caused him to have a seizure and go into a coma. He was in a coma for about two weeks; he was\nhospitalized from December 2013 until February 2014. From February to July 2014, David tried\nto work about 14 hours per week, but the pain in his abdomen was excruciating. Eating caused the\nmost pain. David has a feeding tube 24 hours a day, and as a result of losing his pancreas, he is\ndiabetic and on insulin. It is difficult for him to stand more than 10 minutes; he cannot stand\nwithout a cane as he “just get[s] too shaky. [His] muscles just won’t let [him].” David’s last day\nof work was July 31, 2014; he cannot work due to his physical limitations.\n        Trial was held on August 18 and 19, and October 1 and 2, 2015. David and four other\nwitnesses testified on his behalf. Dena and one other witness testified on her behalf. The district\ncourt issued findings dated November 19, 2015, and entered a decree of dissolution on February\n4, 2016, with the court’s findings attached and incorporated into the decree. Dena was awarded\ncustody of the children subject to David’s graduated and “therapeutic” parenting schedule. The\nschedule begins with bi-monthly therapeutic parenting time for five months and increases\n\n\n                                               -2-\n\fthereafter until after 11 months when David would have parenting time every other weekend from\n8 a.m. on Saturday until 5 p.m. on Sunday. Holiday parenting time was also scheduled. David was\nordered to pay $1,535 per month in child support, maintain the children on his Tri-Care health\ninsurance plan, and pay 60-percent of nonreimbursed healthcare expenses incurred by the children\nafter the first $480 per child has been paid by Dena. Dena was awarded the marital residence and\n“$270.00 of [David’s] net disposable military pension.” Property and debts were divided, the right\nto claim the children for tax purposes was equally divided between the parties, neither party was\nawarded alimony, and each party was ordered to pay their own attorney fees and costs. The parties\nwere ordered to pay the GAL fee of $1,726.73, with each to pay 50-percent of that fee. Dena was\nordered to pay a property equalization amount of $9,528.77 within 180 days of entry of the decree.\n        Dena timely appealed.\n                                 III. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n         Dena assigns, reordered, that the district court erred: (1) by awarding David parenting time\nthat was not in the best interests of the children; (2) by failing to prohibit the Doxey family from\nhaving contact with the children; (3) by calculating the child support incorrectly; (4) by not\nawarding Dena all four tax exemptions for 2015; (5) by failing to find David in contempt or\notherwise ruling on pending contempt actions filed by Dena; (6) by failing to give Dena full credit\nfor temporary order arrears; (7) in its division of the marital estate by (a) miscalculating the equity\nin the marital residence, (b) miscalculating the division of household goods and gifts, (c) including\na $4,500 loan as a marital debt, and (d) determining the 2012 tax debt was a marital debt; (8) by\nfailing to include standard provisions in the decree to protect Dena’s interests in David’s military\nretirement pay; (9) by failing to award alimony to Dena; and (10) by failing to equitably divide the\nGAL fees and failing to order David to pay any of Dena’s attorney fees.\n                                  IV. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n        In actions for dissolution of marriage, an appellate court reviews the case de novo on the\nrecord to determine whether there has been an abuse of discretion by the trial judge. Coufal v.\nCoufal, 291 Neb. 378, 866 N.W.2d 74 (2015). This standard of review applies to the trial court’s\ndeterminations regarding custody, child support, the division of property, alimony, and attorney\nfees. Id.\n        Child custody and parenting time determinations are matters initially entrusted to the\ndiscretion of the trial court, and although reviewed de novo on the record, the trial court’s\ndetermination will normally be affirmed absent an abuse of discretion. See State on behalf of\nMaddox S. v. Matthew E., 23 Neb. App. 500, 873 N.W.2d 208 (2016).\n        An abuse of discretion occurs when a trial court bases its decision upon reasons that are\nuntenable or unreasonable or if its action is clearly against justice or conscience, reason, and\nevidence. Id. A judicial abuse of discretion requires that the reasons or rulings of the trial court be\nclearly untenable insofar as they unfairly deprive a litigant of a substantial right and a just result.\nId.\n        In child custody cases, where the credible evidence is in conflict on a material issue of fact,\nthe appellate court considers, and may give weight to, the fact that the trial judge heard and\nobserved the witnesses and accepted one version of the facts rather than another. Id.\n\n\n                                                 -3-\n\f                                           V. ANALYSIS\n                             1. PARENTING TIME AWARDED TO DAVID\n        The district court found that both Dena and David were fit and proper persons to have the\ncare, custody, and control of their minor children, but that it was in the best interests of the minor\nchildren that custody be awarded to Dena, subject to David’s graduated and “therapeutic”\nparenting schedule. The schedule begins with bi-monthly therapeutic parenting time for five\nmonths and increases thereafter until after 11 months when David would have parenting time every\nother weekend from 8 a.m. on Saturday until 5 p.m. on Sunday. Holiday parenting time was also\nscheduled.\n        Dena argues that the amount of parenting time awarded to David “is far in excess of that\nwhich he is physically capable of exercising at this time, not in line with the recommendation of\nthe expert witness, and not in the best interests of the minor children.” Brief for appellant at 16.\nDena claims that David’s “physical health is a real problem,” and the family’s therapist, Traci\nPenrod-McCormick, “clearly indicated that it would not be in the best interests of the children to\nextend visitation longer than 3-4 hours at a time.” Brief for appellant at 16.\n        Penrod-McCormick has been the family’s therapist since July 2013; she was agreed upon\nby the parties and the GAL. She received a master’s degree in social work in 2004, and is a licensed\nclinical social worker and a licensed independent mental health practitioner in Nebraska. Children\nand families have been the focus of Penrod-McCormick’s professional and clinical experience.\nShe saw just the children “maybe one or two times a month.” In September or October 2013, she\nstarted sessions with the children and David, and according to Penrod-McCormick, David had\n“about twelve” therapeutic visits with the children since that time until mid-August 2015.\n        Penrod-McCormick said the children “function fine in their daily lives and at school.” She\nhas discussed “having visitation with their father,” and in the beginning “it became pretty volatile,\nlots of anger came out, and [she] didn’t think [they] were making a lot of progress at that point.”\nThe children were frustrated, “feeling as though their father wasn’t understanding where they were\ncoming from emotionally, and then his response to that, they became upset.” According to\nPenrod-McCormick, David would “say he was sorry and he loved them. And then he would say,\nbut you have to think about how I feel. You have to think about [sic] from my perspective.”\nPenrod-McCormick thought this made it difficult for the children “to feel like [David] was hearing\nthem.” She did not believe there had been any progress made in the relationship between David\nand the children since they started therapy two years prior. She described their relationship as\n“[s]uperficial.” She explained:\n                 Dad is always very open about how he loves them and wants to see them. He’s very\n        open, but it doesn’t go any further than that. The kids will talk about what’s going on at\n        school. They’ll talk about their sporting events. But it doesn’t go any further than that.\n                 ....\n                 [David] attends, he asks questions, he asks how they are, asks how they’re doing,\n        but it’s never - you know, there have been times where, like the kids have said, you say\n        you’re going to come but you don’t come. But then that turns into, but I’m sick and you\n        have to realize that I’m sick, and I can’t do this because I’m sick, but - and it just becomes\n        a circle of - and kind of a rabbit hole of everybody going all these different ways and there’s\n\n\n                                                 -4-\n\f       no resolution, so - but, for the most part, it’s just, how are things, how is it going, this is\n       how I’m doing in this, this is how soccer is going, and that’s it.\n\n       Going forward, she suggested continued therapy with David and her, “[a]nd then . . .\nmoving into some visitation I think is fine.” However, Penrod-McCormick was concerned about\nlong periods of parenting time, such as 6 to 8 hours of extended time or overnights, stating:\n               I’ve heard over and over from everybody how sick [David] is, and at this point I\n       am not in a place where I believe that he can emotionally and physically support these\n       children outside of - in these long times, these long periods of time. There’s four active\n       children that not only are busy but are active and intellectual.\n\nPenrod-McCormick said she was fine with 3 to 4 hours on a Saturday and Sunday, “[b]ut outside\nof that, I think it’s too much.” She also said David\n         needs to be able to put his adult feelings aside and focus on the needs of - emotional needs\n         of his children and attend to those, work through his adult stuff on his own, but his primary\n         focus needs to be on his kids’ emotional needs in relation to getting them together. So\n         accept that they’re angry, and instead of trying to constantly say, yeah, but, and make\n         excuses for it, accept that they’re angry. Honor that anger and say, how can we move\n         forward.\n\nPenrod-McCormick said she talked to David about this, “maybe even a year ago,” but there had\nbeen no progress on this.\n        David argues that while he “has limitations that may not be experienced by other parents,\nthey do not prevent him from acting as a father.” Brief for appellee at 13-14. David testified that\nduring his parenting time with the children in 2013 (prior to the mandated therapeutic visitation),\nhe took the children for ice cream and fries, they went on walks, went fishing, played games on\nthe Wii, and watched movies. “The parties’ children are ages 11-18 (at the time of trial), and are\nold enough to assist in the procurement of their needs.” Brief for appellee at 14. David testified\nthat “[i]f there was no court involved, it is my opinion that [Dena] would take the children and\nmake sure they never saw me again.”\n        Keeping the evidence and the court’s findings in mind, we now consider the legal principles\ngoverning parenting time matters. The trial court has discretion to set a reasonable parenting time\nschedule. Thompson v. Thompson, 24 Neb. App. 349, 887 N.W.2d 52 (2016). The determination\nof reasonableness is to be made on a case-by-case basis. Id. Parenting time relates to continuing\nand fostering the normal parental relationship of the noncustodial parent. Id. See, also, Fine v.\nFine, 261 Neb. 836, 626 N.W.2d 526 (2001); Walters v. Walters, 12 Neb. App. 340, 673 N.W.2d\n585 (2004). The best interests of the children are the primary and paramount considerations in\ndetermining and modifying visitation rights. Thompson, supra. The best interests inquiry has its\nfoundation in both statutory and case law.\n        Neb. Rev. Stat. 43-2923(6) (Reissue 2016) provides that in determining custody and\nparenting arrangements:\n        [T]he court shall consider the best interests of the minor child, which shall include, but not\n        be limited to, consideration of . . . :\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f               (a) The relationship of the minor child to each parent prior to the commencement\n       of the action or any subsequent hearing;\n               (b) The desires and wishes of the minor child, if of an age of comprehension but\n       regardless of chronological age, when such desires and wishes are based on sound\n       reasoning;\n               (c) The general health, welfare, and social behavior of the minor child;\n               (d) Credible evidence of abuse inflicted on any family or household member . . . ;\n       and\n               (e) Credible evidence of child abuse or neglect or domestic intimate partner\n       abuse. . . .\n\n        Other pertinent factors include the moral fitness of the child’s parents, including sexual\nconduct; respective environments offered by each parent; the age, sex, and health of the child and\nparents; the effect on the child as a result of continuing or disrupting an existing relationship; the\nattitude and stability of each parent’s character; and parental capacity to provide physical care and\nsatisfy educational needs of the child. Robb v. Robb, 268 Neb. 694, 687 N.W.2d 195 (2004).\n        Based on the evidence, the court’s findings, and the foregoing legal principles, we cannot\nsay that the district court abused its discretion in the parenting time awarded to David.\n                                          2. DOXEY FAMILY\n        Clearly, Dena does not think much of David’s girlfriend, Kimberli. Kimberli had filed a\nprotection order against Dena for stalking Kimberli’s children, and Dena says “the allegations were\nso unfounded that the case was dismissed after [Kimberli’s] testimony and without [Dena] having\nto even put forth a defense.” Brief for appellant at 20. Dena also expressed concern about\nKimberli’s adult son, Andrew, who Dena believed, but was unable to prove, was involved in a\njuvenile case of a sexual nature. Based upon alleged inconsistent statements from David and\nKimberli’s testimony on this issue, Dena claims, “It is obvious [Kimberli] did not tell the truth and\nthat makes her even more dangerous to the Araujo children. She is someone willing to defy court\norders[,] . . . file protection orders without any legal or factual basis, and lie under oath in court.”\nBrief for appellant at 21.\n        David argues that “Dena has provided no concrete, direct evidence as to the supposed\nallegations against Andrew,” and that she “continues to assert allegations of a sexual nature, but\nfailed to bring forth any evidence that such an event occurred.” Brief for appellee at 17. “Dena’s\nopposing testimony and belief that Kimberli lied regarding the supposed allegations against\nAndrew, does not automatically make the allegations true.” Id. Furthermore, “[i]t is evident from\nDena’s testimony that she does nothing to help foster a relationship between her children and their\nfather or Kimberli.” Id. at 18. When asked if she told the children that David’s live-in girlfriend is\nsomeone with whom they should not have a relationship, Dena responded:\n                   The kids hate Kim. They despise her. . . . You know, they’re very bright kids, and\n        they’ve been fortunate enough to grow up around families where the children live with\n        both of their parents and they know this is wrong. I don’t need to spell it out for them. It’s\n        wrong. They’re Christians. They know right from wrong.\n\n\n\n                                                 -6-\n\f        Penrod-McCormick testified that the children are angry with Kimberli’s “presence,” and\nthere have been interactions between her and the children “that have upset the children, and at this\npoint they stated they are not comfortable being around her nor do they want to have contact with\nher.” The children “do not want to be in the presence of the Doxey family at all.” On\ncross-examination, Penrod-McCormick was asked how many times the children had been around\nKimberli. Penrod-McCormick said “I know for sure the two younger kids during one visitation.”\n        David argues that the trial court weighed the evidence and testimony presented and\ndetermined that no limitation on visitation was necessary and, therefore, did not provide one. We\nagree with David’s summation. Based on the evidence presented, the district court’s failure to\nprohibit the Doxey family from having contact with the parties’ children was not an abuse of\ndiscretion.\n                                        3. CHILD SUPPORT\n        Commencing December 1, 2015, David was ordered to pay $1,535 per month in child\nsupport for four children, which reduced to $1,309 per month when only three children remained\nas minors, $1,137 per month for two children, and $781 per month when only one child remained\na minor. Dena contends the district court adopted a child support calculation which did not comport\nto the evidence presented at trial, wrongly assigned incomes to each party, and wrongly credited\nDavid for monthly health care premiums related to the children.\n                                        (a) David’s Income\n         Regarding income, Dena claims that exhibit 7 (offered by David) shows two primary\nsources of income received each month: Veterans Affairs (VA) disability of $3,776 per month (not\ntaxed) and military retirement pay of $1,676 per month (taxed). The child support worksheet\nincorporated into the decree shows $3,700 in non-taxable income and $985.33 in taxable monthly\nincome. Dena argues that the non-taxable VA disability should reflect the full $3,776 per month,\nand with regard to the military retirement pay, that amount should have been $1,406 (this accounts\nfor the $270 per month awarded to Dena from David’s military retirement pay). Dena believes the\ndistrict court relied upon exhibit 22, which she claims contains incorrect information.\n         Exhibit 7 actually shows that David’s gross military retirement pay is $2,053 per month,\nand after “SBP Costs” and federal and state income tax deductions, his net pay is $1,676.82. In his\nbrief, David acknowledges the court’s error, and agrees that his net retirement pay amount (after\naccounting for the $270 in military retirement pay awarded to Dena) should have been $1,406\n($1,676 minus $270).\n         As for David’s non-taxable disability pay, Exhibit 7 contains a letter from the VA, showing\nthat David was entitled to a monthly payment of $3,712.87 because he was a Veteran with five\ndependents. Dena’s assertion that David’s VA disability is $3,776 per month comes from a bank\nstatement in exhibit 7 showing a deposit of $3,776 into David’s bank account in May 2015.\nAccording to David’s testimony, the extra amount of the deposit above the $3,712.87 can be\nattributed to money he received from donated leave; he testified that at the time of trial that money\nfrom donated leave is no longer available to him. We cannot say that the court’s use of $3,700 for\nDavid’s VA disability was an abuse of discretion (especially since, as noted below, the district\ncourt also attributed a lower hourly wage to Dena’s employment).\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\f       Having reviewed the record, we find that David’s total monthly income includes $3,700\nfrom non-taxable disability, and $2,053 in gross military retirement pay. From his gross military\nretirement pay, federal and state income taxes will be deducted, as will the “SBP Costs” which\nwere not challenged by Dena. As will be discussed later in this opinion, the district court\nincorrectly calculated the military retirement pay awarded to Dena; under our later modification,\nDena is awarded $363 per month from David’s military retirement pay. Accordingly, in our child\nsupport calculation, David will also receive a credit for the $363 in military retirement pay awarded\nto Dena. We will modify the child support worksheet accordingly, as discussed in more detail later.\n                                         (b) Dena’s Income\n         The district court attributed a total monthly income of $3,705 to Dena. The court used “a\n3-year average for trust distribution, and a percentage split of [David’s] military pension of\n$270.00 owed to [Dena] in determining gross income.” As will be discussed later, the 3-year\naverage for the trust distribution from 2013 to 2015 was $18,000 ($1,500 per month). Using the\nnumbers above, the district court necessarily attributed $1,935 per month to Dena’s income from\nemployment; this is the same amount David attributed to Dena’s employment income in his\nproposed child support calculation (exhibit 22). Although David said the $1,935 per month income\nwas calculated using $11.25 per hour for a 40-hour workweek, by our calculation $1,935 per month\nequates to $11.16 per hour, 40 hours per week, 52 weeks per year.\n         With regard to Dena’s income, she claims the $44,460 per year ($3,705 per month) in\nincome that the district court attributed to her was “well above what the evidence suggests.” Brief\nfor appellant at 24. She earns $11 per hour and works “about 30 hours per week, 42 weeks out of\nthe year.” Id. According to her testimony, at the time of trial, she was working as a “para” for\nspecial education students earning $11.27 per hour. Dena testified that in Spring 2014, she was\nworking 32.5 hours per week. There was no other testimony regarding the number of hours per\nweek she worked, nor the number of weeks per year. However, she did testify that she is able to\ndrop her daughter off at school and pick her up at the end of the day, and if the children have a day\noff, so does Dena; this suggests a school day schedule. When asked if she had applications out for\nother employment, Dena said, “No. This . . . is the perfect job,” because it allowed her to have the\nsame schedule as her children.\n         David argues that Dena has the ability to work year-round, but has voluntarily opted out.\nDena testified that she can “work summer school” but did not do so in either 2014 or 2015. In\n2014, she was preparing for trial, which “was supposed to be the court date at that point.” And, “I\nneeded to prepare myself for this. There have been a lot of lies told, and I needed to have a set-up\nto -- to demonstrate the truth.” David argues that “[u]nder the Child Support Guidelines, it is\ncompletely within the discretion of the trial court to impute a wage to Dena that comports with her\ncapacity to earn,” and he should not be penalized for her choice to remain at home. Brief for\nappellee at 20.\n         In general, child support payments should be set according to the Nebraska Child Support\nGuidelines. Freeman v. Groskopf, 286 Neb. 713, 838 N.W.2d 300 (2013). The guidelines provide\nthat “[i]f applicable, earning capacity may be considered in lieu of a parent’s actual, present income\nand may include factors such as work history, education, occupational skills, and job opportunities.\nEarning capacity is not limited to wage-earning capacity, but includes moneys available from all\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\fsources.” Freeman, 286 Neb. at 721, 838 N.W.2d at 307. See, also, Neb. Ct. R. § 4-204 (rev. 2016).\nUse of earning capacity to calculate child support is useful “when it appears that the parent is\ncapable of earning more income than is presently being earned.” Freeman, 286 Neb. at 721, 838\nN.W.2d at 307.\n         Dena testified that she earns $11.27 per hour, and by choice does not work full-time. In\naddition, she was not looking for different employment because she liked having the same schedule\nas her children. As stated previously, it appears that the district court attributed $1,935 per month\nto Dena’s income from employment; the same amount David attributed to Dena’s employment\nincome in his proposed child support calculation (exhibit 22). This monthly amount equates to\n$11.16 per hour, 40 hours per work, 52 weeks per year. Based on our review of the record, we\ncannot say that the district court abused its discretion in attributing such earning capacity to Dena.\n         Dena also acknowledges attribution of $270 (now modified to $363) in income per month\nas a result of the award from David’s military retirement, but challenges the court’s use of a 3-year\naverage for her trust distribution. Dena testified that she receives an annual payout from her\nfather’s estate. She claims the only evidence of her inheritance distributions is found in exhibit 24,\nwhich shows a 3-year average for 2013-2015 of $18,000 per year ($1,500 per month), and “there\nis no evidence to the contrary.” Brief for appellant at 24. See, also, Nebraska Child Support\nGuidelines, worksheet 1 (fifth footnote) (income may be averaged in the event of substantial\nfluctuations of annual earnings); Gress v. Gress, 274 Neb. 686, 743 N.W.2d 67 (2007) (3-year\naverage to be used when averaging income). Dena also argues that the inheritance should not be\nattributed as income for child support purposes, and “leave[s] this for this Court to decide.” Id.\nWith regard to Dena’s inheritance, David argues that it was properly considered by the court as a\nsource of funds for purposes of child support because the court must consider income derived from\nall sources.\n         For purposes of calculating child support, the court must consider the total monthly income,\nwhich is “income of both parties derived from all sources, except all means-tested public assistance\nbenefits which includes any earned income tax credit and payments received for children of prior\nmarriages.” § 4-204 (emphasis supplied). This includes trust distributions. See Hughes v. Hughes,\n14 Neb. App. 229, 706 N.W.2d 569 (2005) (for purposes of child support, husband’s income\nincluded income generated from his mother’s trust). See, also, Marcovitz v. Rogers, 267 Neb. 456,\n675 N.W.2d 132 (2004) (profits generated from real estate development entities, in which ex-wife\nhad inherited ownership interest, constituted “income” for purposes of calculating child support).\nAccordingly, the district court properly included Dena’s trust distributions when determining her\nincome; as she noted, the 3-year average for 2013 to 2015 was $18,000 ($1,500 per month), which\nappears to be the amount used by the district court.\n         Having reviewed the record, we find that Dena’s total monthly income includes $1,935\nfrom employment, $363 from David’s military retirement pay, and $1,500 from trust distributions;\na total of $3,798. We will modify the child support worksheet accordingly, as discussed in more\ndetail later.\n                                    (c) Health Insurance Credit\n       As to the $93 per month health insurance premium credit given to David, Dena argues that\nDavid testified at previous hearings that his monthly cost for himself and the children was $45.\n\n\n                                                -9-\n\fDena says the only exhibit offered to show health premium costs was exhibit 23, and it reflects a\npast due amount of $46.32. She also says “[i]t is unknown as to why Exhibit 23 shows the current\namount due of $92.64, but it is exactly 2x the amount past due which cannot be an accident.” Brief\nfor appellant at 26. At trial, David testified that his health insurance premium cost was $138 per\nmonth. But in his brief he argues that the court can easily surmise from exhibit 23 that the monthly\ncost for the health insurance premium is $93. We have reviewed exhibit 23, a UnitedHealthcare\nStatement dated January 12, 2015, and it shows the total amount due as $138.96; this included\n$46.32 (past due) plus $92.64 (current due). Exhibit 23 was the only documentary evidence of the\nhealth insurance premium presented to the district court, and it was the district court’s decision to\nattribute $93 per month to the health insurance premium; this was not an abuse of discretion.\nFurthermore, because this is the only documentary evidence in the record regarding the premium,\nwe cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in awarding the entire amount as a credit\nin the child support worksheet.\n                                (d) New Child Support Calculation\n        Based on the foregoing, we have modified the child support calculation and attached the\nworksheet to this opinion as appendix A. In our calculation, Dena was attributed a total monthly\nincome of $3,798. David was attributed a total monthly income of $2,053 from his military\nretirement pay, and tax-exempt income of $3,700 from his VA disability. David was also given\n“Other Deductions” totaling $497.62 ($363 for military retirement pay awarded to Dena and\n$134.62 for “SBP Costs” which were not challenged by Dena), and a health insurance premium\ncredit of $93. Finally, because the district court ordered that each party was entitled to claim two\nminor children for dependency and exemption benefits, our calculation includes three exemptions\nfor each party (the party, plus two children).\n        Pursuant to the new calculation, David’s child support obligation is $1,642 per month for\nfour children; $1,400 per month for three children; $1,219 per month for two children; and when\nonly one child remains a minor, David shall pay $844 per month. We modify the decree\naccordingly.\n                                    (e) Order for Direct Payment\n        Dena also contends that the court should have ordered that child support payments be\ndirectly paid from David’s VA disability, if such a direct payment is allowed. David contends that\nDena never presented this issue to the trial court and that “‘an issue not properly presented to and\npassed upon by the trial court may not be raised on appeal.’” Brief for appellee at 22 (quoting\nGebhardt v. Gebhardt, 16 Neb. App. 565, 575, 746 N.W.2d 707, 715 (2008)). We agree with\nDavid that Dena has not preserved the issue for appeal.\n                                            (f) Plain Error\n        Although not assigned or argued by the parties, we note an issue of plain error. Plain error\nis error plainly evident from the record and of such a nature that to leave it uncorrected would\nresult in damage to the integrity, reputation, or fairness of the judicial process. Sickler v. Sickler,\n293 Neb. 521, 878 N.W.2d 549 (2016).\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 10 -\n\f        In the decree, the district court ordered that the uninsured/nonreimbursed healthcare\nexpenses incurred on behalf of the minor children were to be allocated as follows: “thirty percent\n(30%) to be paid by [Dena] and sixty percent (60%) to be paid by [David].” However, the district\ncourt’s allocation of expenses does not equal 100-percent. The discrepancy was raised at the\nmotion for new trial, but not raised in the briefs on appeal. Accordingly, finding plain error, we\nmodify the decree so that the uninsured/nonreimbursed healthcare expenses incurred on behalf of\nthe minor children are allocated 40-percent to Dena and 60-percent to David. This is in line with\neach parent’s respective percent share of the child support obligation. See Neb. Ct. R. § 4-215 (rev.\n2011).\n                                        4. TAX EXEMPTIONS\n        Dena argues that the trial court erred by not awarding her all four exemptions for 2015,\nbecause David claimed all four children in 2013 and two children in 2014 (despite the court\nawarding all four exemptions to Dena for 2014). David argues that the tax exemption issue was\nclearly within the purview of the trial court to determine. Upon our de novo review, we cannot say\nthat the district court abused its discretion in awarding Dena only two, rather than all four,\ndependency exemptions for 2015.\n                              5. CONTEMPT ACTIONS FILED BY DENA\n        Dena argues, “The Court erred by not finding [David] in contempt for failure to pay child\nsupport as alleged and as supported by the evidence adduced at trial. Actually, the Court made no\nactual finding as to the show cause issues, but such are deemed to have been denied absent a ruling\nto the contrary.” Brief for appellant at 36. According to Dena, two contempt actions were filed in\nthis case: the first contempt action was filed on September 9, 2014, for failure to pay child support,\nand it was “basically merged with the second contempt action” filed on July 20, 2015, based upon\na continued failure to pay child support. Brief for appellant at 37. She contends that the district\ncourt only needed to rule on the second action. (Neither the September 2014 nor the July 2015\npleadings appear in our record.) Dena claims that over a 24-month period from July 2013 through\nJune 2015, David paid only $36,800 of the $52,000 owed in child support. She acknowledges that\nDavid paid an additional $3,300 just before trial, but even so, he still “underpaid $13,000 in child\nsupport during the period of time related to either or both of the show cause actions.” Brief for\nappellant at 37. Dena states that David had the income, but he chose not to pay the child support\nowed.\n        Dena contends that the contempt filings also raised David’s failure to make house payments\nas ordered. According to Dena, “David chose to pay his new debts related to the Doxey family, his\nnew life, and the debts related to his new house, instead of paying the Court ordered debts for the\nAraujo family.” Brief for appellant at 38.\n        David argues that “[t]here is nothing in the record to indicate that Dena preserved her\nargument for appeal regarding any alleged contempt of David. Additionally, there is nothing in the\nrecord before this court which would contemplate grounds for appeal, regarding contempt[.]” Brief\nfor appellee at 28.\n        As stated previously, our record does not contain any pleadings regarding an application(s)\nfor contempt. However, the contempt action(s) were mentioned at various hearings in September\n\n\n                                                - 11 -\n\fand November 2014 and in May 2015. It appears that the contempt action(s) were continued to the\ndate of trial. And the record from the trial reflects that the contempt action(s) were to be heard at\nthe same time as trial. The February 2016 divorce decree does not address the contempt action(s),\nand no other order disposing of the contempt action(s) appears in our record. Accordingly, while\nthe decree itself was a final appealable order, we do not have jurisdiction over the contempt\nactions(s) because we lack a final appealable order of such action(s). See Belitz v. Belitz, 21 Neb.\nApp. 716, 842 N.W.2d 613 (2014) (application to modify custody and application for an order to\nshow cause regarding contempt were two separate pleadings and presented separate issues even\nthough heard at same time; one sought new relief, the other sought to enforce relief previously\ngranted; each needed to be timely appealed). See, also, Michael B. v. Donna M., 11 Neb. App. 346,\n652 N.W.2d 618 (2002), overruled on other grounds, Smeal Fire Apparatus Co. v. Kreikemeier,\n279 Neb. 661, 782 N.W.2d 848 (2010).\n                            6. CREDIT FOR TEMPORARY ORDER ARREARS\n        Dena says that while the district court did include child support arrearages of $9,132 “in\nthe balance sheet,” it failed to factor in “the arrears for missed house payments (ordered in lieu of\nalimony) into the balance sheet.” Brief for appellant at 28. We note that the “balance sheet” does\nnot specifically state that the arrears included were for child support.\n        Dena claims David made no house payments from December 2014 through November\n2015 when the court entered “its tentative findings in the case (11 months) or for the 14 months\nbetween the times the payments were reinstated and the Decree was entered by the Court thereby\nterminating the provisions of the temporary order.” Id. Based on monthly house payments of\n$1,418 (exhibit 16), Dena claims the court failed to preserve the $15,598 (11 months) or the\n$19,852 (14 months) David was previously ordered to pay her under the temporary order. Dena\ncontends the court should have done one of two things: (1) included the house payment arrears in\nthe balance sheet for the marital estate, or (2) preserved such arrearage from the temporary order\nso that Dena could bring the issue in the form of a show cause action against David in the future.\n        As stated previously, David’s failure to make mortgage payments was the subject of the\ncontempt actions(s). Although the contempt actions(s) were heard at the same time as trial, the\nFebruary 2016 divorce decree does not address the contempt action(s); nor does the decree\nspecifically address the mortgage arrears. Because no other order disposing of the contempt\naction(s) appears in our record, we do not have jurisdiction over the contempt actions(s) because\nwe lack a final appealable order of such action(s). See Belitz, supra. See, also, Michael B., supra.\n                                  7. DIVISION OF MARITAL ESTATE\n        In a divorce action, the purpose of a property division is to distribute the marital assets\nequitably between the parties. Stanosheck v. Jeanette, 294 Neb. 138, 881 N.W.2d 599 (2016).\nEquitable property division under Neb. Rev. Stat. § 42-365 (Reissue 2016) is a three-step process.\nStanosheck, supra. The first step is to classify the parties’ property as marital or nonmarital. Id.\nThe second step is to value the marital assets and marital liabilities of the parties. Id. The third step\nis to calculate and divide the net marital estate between the parties. Id. The ultimate test in\ndetermining the appropriateness of a property division is fairness and reasonableness as\ndetermined by the facts of each case. Id. See, also, Liming v. Liming, 272 Neb. 534, 547, 723\n\n\n                                                 - 12 -\n\fN.W.2d 89, 99 (2006) (“Although the division of property is not subject to a precise mathematical\nformula, the general rule is to award a spouse one-third to one-half of the marital estate, the polestar\nbeing fairness and reasonableness as determined by the facts of each case.”).\n        The date on which a court values the marital estate should be rationally related to the\nproperty composing the marital estate. Brozek v. Brozek, 292 Neb. 681, 874 N.W.2d 17 (2016).\n        Generally, all property accumulated and acquired by either spouse during a marriage is part\nof the marital estate. Brozek, supra. Exceptions include property that a spouse acquired before the\nmarriage, or by gift or inheritance. Id. Setting aside nonmarital property is simple if the spouse\npossesses the original asset, but can be problematic if the original asset no longer exists. Id.\nSeparate property becomes marital property by commingling if it is inextricably mixed with\nmarital property or with the separate property of the other spouse. Id. If the separate property\nremains segregated or is traceable into its product, commingling does not occur. Id. The burden of\nproof rests with the party claiming that property is nonmarital. Id.\n                                    (a) Marital Residence Equity\n         The district court awarded Dena the marital residence and attributed $41,112.54 in equity\nto it; she claims the equity should have only been $37,593 (a difference of $3,519.54). To arrive\nat its equity value, Dena claims the court erroneously relied upon David’s proffered balance on the\nmortgage as of April 30, 2014, which was nearly a year after David had vacated the residence.\nDena says the home was valued at $242,000 (appraised value from exhibit 27) and the amount\nowed at the time of separation was $204,407, so the equity was $37,593. She says that exhibit 16\nshows the home mortgage balance to be $203,707 as of August 7, 2013. She then suggests the\nstatements reflect the unpaid principal balance was decreasing by $350 per month with each\npayment. “Therefore, to determine the unpaid principal balance as of the date of separation, the\nCourt simply needed to multiply $350 to the number of months between the date of separation and\nthe date of the August statement (2 months) and then add that amount to the amount of unpaid\nprincipal balance on the August statement to determine that the unpaid principal balance in June\n2013 was approximately $204,407.00 ($203,707.00 + $700.00).” Brief for appellant at 30.\n         David argues that “it is important for the court to note that during the parties’ separation,\nDavid was still making some mortgage payments for the marital home - payments that would allow\nthe amount of equity on behalf of Dena to rise.” Brief for appellee at 25. He claims “[i]t is\nreasonable and within the Court’s discretion to consider payments made by David toward the\nmarital home when dividing the assets.” Id. He points out that Dena states the difference between\nthe amount of equity calculated by the trial court and the amount that should have been used was\n$3,519.54. But, citing to exhibit 16, David states that the payments he made on the mortgage after\nseparation total at least $7,089.75.\n         “There is no ‘hard and fast’ rule concerning valuation dates so long as the selected date\nbears a rational relationship to the property to be divided, and the selected date is reviewed for an\nabuse of discretion.” Myhra v. Myhra, 16 Neb. App. 920, 928, 756 N.W.2d 528, 538 (2008). The\ndistrict court’s decree does not specifically state how it reached the equity value of the marital\nhome. But an equity value of $41,112.54, would mean a home mortgage of $200,887.46; this\namount coincides with the unpaid principal balance in the mortgage statement dated April 30, 2014\n(exhibit 18, page 5). Exhibit 16, page 8, shows that the unpaid principal balance as of December\n\n\n                                                 - 13 -\n\f23, 2013, was $202,305. Exhibit 16 also shows that David paid the mortgage due through\nDecember. Because David was making the mortgage payments on the residence through\nDecember, the equity should follow. Therefore, the equity in the home should have been calculated\nat $39,695 ($242,000 appraised value - $202,305 unpaid balance in December 2013). Upon our\nde novo review, we find that the court overvalued the home equity by $1,417.54.\n                            (b) Division of Household Goods and Gifts\n         The court attributed a value of $4,019 to Dena for household goods awarded to her, and a\nvalue of $525 awarded to David. Dena claims the court “made no less than 6 mistakes in its\ninclusion of multiple assets which should not have been considered marital assets.” Brief for\nappellant at 30. She claims a sofa and loveseat ($425 value) were delivered and paid for post-\nseparation. David claims the sofa and loveseat were ordered before separation, and that Dena did\nnot prove the asset was nonmarital. He acknowledges the conflicting testimony of the parties and\nstates that in such cases it is for the trial court to make a judgment.\n        Dena claims that a $30 mixer was premarital and two bedroom sets ($325 value) were\npurchased with inherited money. However, David claims she did not meet her burden of proving\nthat the items were nonmarital.\n        Dena claims that multiple items (valued at $620) were gifted to the children and yet\ncredited to her in the division of debts and assets. She also claims a sauna was not included in the\ndivision of debts and assets; she claims the sauna was gifted to her, but that David sold it around\nthe time of the divorce for $500 and used the money for his own purposes. David argues that\nDena’s claims are unsubstantiated.\n        After our de novo review of the record, we find that Dena did not meet her burden to prove\nthat any of the foregoing items should have been considered nonmarital property. See Brozek v.\nBrozek, 292 Neb. 681, 874 N.W.2d 17 (2016).\n                                      (c) SAC Loan ($4,500)\n         A “SAC Federal Credit Union” debt of $4,500 was determined to be marital and was\nassigned to David. Dena argues that “[t]here was very little if any credible evidence offered to\nsupport the notion that this was a marital debt.” Brief for appellant at 32-33. She says the only\nevidence of the loan is found in exhibit 18 which shows David took out a loan for $4,500 sometime\nprior to June 2013. “There was no evidence to support [Dena] having any idea that such Loan\nexisted or what the purpose and use was” for the loan. Brief for appellant at 33. She argues it could\nhave been used for a motorcycle deemed nonmarital, or to pay attorney fees or child support, and\nfurther, it is unknown into which bank account the loan was deposited. She claims David gave\nthree different answers when questioned about the loan, and there was no evidence “as to which\nanswer was correct - vehicle, motorcycle hobby or personal reasons.” Id.\n         David argues the loan was incurred during the time of the marriage and is therefore\nconsidered a marital debt unless proven otherwise by Dena, and she did not prove otherwise. He\ntestified that Dena knew about the loan, which was for his hobby of building and restoring\nmotorcycles, something in which even the children participated.\n         Based upon our de novo review of the record, we cannot say that the district court abused\nits discretion when it determined that the debt was marital property and included it in the marital\n\n\n                                               - 14 -\n\festate. See Bergmeier v. Bergmeier, 296 Neb. 440, 894 N.W.2d 266 (2017). We find no error with\nrespect to this portion of the district court’s decree.\n                                         (d) 2012 Tax Debt\n        The district court determined that a 2012 tax debt of $2,365 was marital debt, and assigned\nthat debt to David. Dena argues that there was insufficient evidence to support that this was a\nmarital debt. Further, to the extent it could be justified as a marital debt, then the 2012 tax refund\nof $2,138 should have been a marital asset. David claimed the refund went into a joint account,\nbut Dena claims “[n]o such deposit appears in the joint account statements” and Dena claimed she\ndid not receive any of this refund.\n        David testified that the tax bill ($2,365) was outstanding at the time of separation, but that\nhe had paid the bill prior to trial. He further testified that the outstanding bill was for a joint tax\nreturn. He testified that the parties historically amended their tax returns once Dena started\nreceiving checks from her father.\n        After a de novo review of the record, we cannot say that the district court abused its\ndiscretion in determining that the 2012 tax debt was marital.\n                                      (e) Equalization Payment\n       The only adjustment we made to the court’s “balance sheet” is with regard to the equity in\nthe marital residence, which we determined was $39,695 instead of $41,112.54; a difference of\n$1,417.54. Because the district court divided the marital estate 50/50, Dena’s equalization payment\nmust be reduced by $708.77 ($1,417.54 ÷ 2). Her new equalization payment to David is $8,820\nand the decree is modified accordingly.\n                                     8. MILITARY RETIREMENT\n        The decree states: “[Dena] is awarded $270.00 of [David’s] net disposable military\npension. The payment thereof shall commence on the first day of the month following the entry of\nthe Decree of Dissolution of Marriage.” Although the decree does not specifically state that Dena\nis awarded $270 “per month,” we read the decree to award a monthly payment; and the parties do\nnot dispute that the award was for $270 “per month.”\n        Dena argues that a percentage of the military retirement pay should have been awarded\nrather than a set amount, and that by not using “the coverture method,” she will not receive cost\nof living increases or other such benefits. Brief for appellant at 39. Dena requests that the matter\nbe remanded to the court “to determine how many months [David] was in the military and how\nmany of those months overlapped with the marriage of the parties in order for the Court to\ndetermine what percentage of the retirement should be awarded to both [Dena] and [David].” Id.\nHowever, David argues that Dena does not cite to any proof that she presented this issue to the\ntrial court, and “[h]er failure to present issues she now wants to complain about, renders them void\nfor consideration on appeal.” Brief for appellee at 29.\n        David is correct that Dena never specifically asked the district court to use the coverture\nformula when determining Dena’s share of David’s military retirement pay. At trial, however,\nDavid raised the issue. David’s attorney stated, “I just wanted to put to [sic] the record the\ncoverture formula.” Thereafter, between the attorney’s questions and David’s answers, the record\n\n\n\n                                                - 15 -\n\freveals that David had 248 months of total military service, of which 108 months were served\nwhile married to Dena. The coverture formula can be used when a portion of a retirement pension\nhas been earned by one spouse during the marriage, with other portions being earned before and/or\nafter the marriage. The coverture formula takes the number of months of service earned while\nmarried and divides that by the total number of months of service. See Bergmeier v. Bergmeier,\n296 Neb. 440, 894 N.W.2d 266 (2017). In this case, 108 months divided by 248 months results in\n43.54 percent of David’s retirement pay being considered marital. If Dena was awarded one-half\nof that, she would receive 21.63 percent of David’s net monthly retirement pay, which at the time\nof trial was $1,676.82. This would result in Dena receiving $362.70 per month, if a fixed amount\nwas awarded.\n         However, instead of $362.70 per month being awarded to Dena, the district court ordered\na fixed amount of $270 per month. The court provided no explanation for how that figure was\ndetermined. In our de novo review of the record, we conclude that the court’s figure appears to\nhave been derived from exhibit 22, which was offered by David. That exhibit indicates that David’s\nmonthly military retirement pay is $1,256, an amount we know is not correct in light of our review\nof David’s income earlier in this opinion. We have previously determined that David’s net monthly\nretirement pay is $1,676.82. Exhibit 22 also reflects that Dena’s portion of the military retirement\nis an “[a]nticipated 21.55 percent,” which is about one-half of the 43.54 percent we determined\nabove to be the marital portion of David’s retirement pay. If the district court relied upon that net\nmonthly benefit amount ($1,256) and percentage (which appears to derive from the coverture\nformula), the resulting amount for Dena’s share would be $270.66. Therefore, we conclude the\ndistrict court arrived at the fixed amount of $270 per month by relying on an inaccurate monthly\nmilitary retirement figure set forth in exhibit 22. Accordingly, because David’s net monthly\nretirement pay is actually $1,676.82, we find plain error in the fixed dollar amount awarded, and\nmodify the fixed monthly amount from $270 to $363 per month ($1,676.82 × 21.63 percent =\n$362.70). Although Dena argues that the court should have simply awarded a percentage rather\nthan a fixed amount so that she can receive cost of living adjustments, she does not point to any\nevidence in the record where this request was made to the district court. And our review of the\nfederal law applicable to dividing military retirement pay indicates that a court can order either a\npercentage or a fixed monthly amount, with the latter excluded from receiving cost of living\nadjustments. See 10 U.S.C.A. § 1408(a)(2) and (4) (2010 & Cum. Supp. 2017). Since the district\ncourt could award either option, and Dena failed to put on evidence as to why a percentage award\nwas more appropriate than a fixed amount under the circumstances of this case, we cannot say the\ndistrict court abused its discretion in choosing a fixed award over a percentage award. Accordingly,\nwe modify only the amount of the award as noted above.\n         Additionally, Dena says the decree fails to address the survivor benefit plan (SBP) “which\nis presently available to [Dena] pursuant to the original election made upon [David’s] retirement\nwhile the parties were still married.” Brief for appellant at 38. She claims that David could change\nhis election at any time, and could remove Dena and “insert his new wife as the beneficiary of the\nSBP[.]” Brief for appellant at 39. “The Court should have specifically ordered that the SBP benefit\nis awarded to [Dena] and that [David] has no right to change such election if such option is\navailable to him or may become available to him in the future.” Id.\n\n\n\n                                               - 16 -\n\f         David argues that “[a]t no time prior to this appeal did Dena argue that David should\npreserve the original [SBP] election made on his retirement plan during the parties’ marriage.”\nBrief for appellee at 29. And “[n]owhere in Dena’s brief does she cite to any proof that she\npresented to the trial court the [SBP] election issue[.]” Id.\n         David is correct that Dena never raised the SBP election issue to the district court. Further,\nDena has provided us with no case law in her brief showing us that she is definitively entitled to\nthe SBP election. Because this issue was not presented to or ruled on by the district court, we will\nnot consider the issue in this appeal. See Hargesheimer v. Gale, 294 Neb. 123, 881 N.W.2d 589\n(2016) (appellate court will not consider issue on appeal that was not presented to or passed upon\nby trial court).\n                                             9. ALIMONY\n        David was ordered to pay the home mortgage of approximately $1,400 per month in lieu\nof temporary alimony. The temporary order filed on August 26, 2013, ordered David to pay the\nmortgage payment and the basic utilities on the marital residence occupied by Dena; although this\norder did not say such payment was “in lieu of alimony,” a complete reading of the record shows\nthat was the intent of the mortgage payment. As noted previously in this opinion, David did pay\nthe mortgage through December 2013, but has made no payments since that time (his mortgage\nobligation was apparently suspended from January through November 2014).\n        Dena says she “was a stay-at-home mother by agreement of the parties for nearly 20 years\nand she has very limited employment marketability and no post high school degrees with which\nshe can depend upon to obtain employment or make a living good enough to independently provide\nfor herself and her four children.” Brief for appellant at 40. Although noting David’s 100-percent\ndisability might weigh against alimony presently, she suggests the district court erred by “not\nfinding that an alimony award of $1 at least be awarded to [Dena] so that a modification action\ncould be filed in the future if a material change in circumstances exists to merit such modification.”\nId.\n        David claims that the district court did not abuse its discretion because he is on a fixed\nincome due to disability, whereas Dena has the ability to engage in gainful employment and has\noutside sources of income, including a large inheritance. He argues that to require him “to provide\nfor an able-bodied, working adult is not equitable in these circumstances.” Brief for appellee at 31.\n        In considering alimony, a court should weigh four factors: (1) the circumstances of the\nparties, (2) the duration of the marriage, (3) the history of contributions to the marriage, and (4)\nthe ability of the party seeking support to engage in gainful employment without interfering with\nthe interests of any minor children in the custody of each party. Brozek v. Brozek, 292 Neb. 681,\n874 N.W.2d 17 (2016). In addition to the specific criteria listed in § 42-365, a court should consider\nthe income and earning capacity of each party and the general equities. Brozek, supra.\n        The statutory criteria for dividing property and awarding alimony overlap, but the two\nserve different purposes and courts should consider them separately. Id. The purpose of a property\ndivision is to distribute the marital assets equitably between the parties. Id. The purpose of alimony\nis to provide for the continued maintenance or support of one party by the other when the relative\neconomic circumstances and the other criteria enumerated in § 42-365 make it appropriate. Brozek,\nsupra.\n\n\n                                                - 17 -\n\f        The evidence in the record supports the district court’s decision to deny an alimony award.\nDavid has significant health issues and, as noted by Dena, he is 100-percent disabled. We recognize\nthat Dena was a stay-at-home mother for a number of years. However, at the time of the divorce\nhearing, the parties’ youngest child was almost 11 years old and Dena was working as a “para” for\nspecial education students earning $11.27 per hour; she had the opportunities to work during the\nsummers, but chose not to do so. Additionally, Dena had significant inheritance monies. See\nBauerle v. Bauerle, 263 Neb. 881, 644 N.W.2d 128 (2002) (when entering decree for alimony,\ncourt may take into account all property owned by parties at time of decree, whether accumulated\nby joint efforts or acquired by inheritance). After a de novo review of the record and considering\nthe circumstances of this case, we conclude that the denial of alimony was not an abuse of\ndiscretion.\n                                   10. GAL AND ATTORNEY FEES\n        The court ordered Dena and David to each pay one-half the $1,726.73 GAL fee. Dena says\nher income is “substantially lower” than David’s income, and further, “the need for a GAL was\ndirectly related to [David’s] failure to maintain a regular relationship with his children and attempts\nto reintegrate him with the children.” Brief for appellant at 41. Dena also claims she did not want\nto have the GAL in court during trial, but that David asked him to be present, thereby adding to\nthe GAL’s expenses. Dena argues that the court should have ordered David to pay all of the GAL’s\nfees, or for each party to pay in proportion to their current incomes (approximately one-third by\nDena, two-thirds by David). David argues that despite Dena’s claims that the GAL was secured as\na result of his actions, the GAL was appointed subsequent to Dena’s request for the appointment;\ntherefore, the court correctly and properly split the GAL fees equally between the parties. Under\nthe circumstances of this case, the district court did not abuse its discretion in ordering each party\nto pay 50-percent of the GAL fees. See Smith v. Smith, 222 Neb. 752, 386 N.W.2d 873 (1986)\n(allowance, amount, and allocation of guardian ad litem fee is matter within initial discretion of a\ntrial court, involves consideration of equities and circumstances of particular case, and will not be\nset aside on appeal in absence of an abuse of discretion by trial court).\n        As for attorney fees, Dena claims that David: failed to pay child support for long periods\nof time; failed to pay the house payment; failed to answer discovery; caused multiple contempt\nactions and motions to compel to be filed; refused to pay uncovered medical expenses; “lied to the\nCourt about his income being reduced” and that he lost his job, “all the while continuing to collect\na full six-figure salary until just a few months prior to the trial”; and refused to pay therapy\nexpenses. Brief for appellant at 42. These “actions/inactions” by David “significantly increased\nattorney fees” for Dena, and therefore, she argues that the court erred by not ordering David to pay\na reasonable amount in attorney fees to her.\n        David argues that “Dena mischaracterizes the evidence regarding David’s participation in\nthese proceedings,” and that he “participated despite suffering many health related issues.” Brief\nfor appellee at 32. Further, “[t]here is no indication that David acted frivolously in these\nproceedings and he should not be required to bear the burden of both parties’ attorneys where Dena\nhas been equally involved in many of the issues the parties have faced over the last several years.”\nId.\n\n\n\n                                                - 18 -\n\f        A uniform course of procedure exists in Nebraska for the award of attorney fees in\ndissolution cases. Brozek v. Brozek, 292 Neb. 681, 874 N.W.2d 17 (2016). A dissolution court\nshould consider the nature of the case, the amount involved in the controversy, the services actually\nperformed, the results obtained, the length of time required for preparation and presentation of the\ncase, the novelty and difficulty of the questions raised, and the customary charges of the bar for\nsimilar services. Id. After reviewing the relevant factors, we conclude that the district court did not\nabuse its discretion by declining to award Dena attorney fees in the decree.\n                                        VI. CONCLUSION\n        For the reasons stated above, we find that the district court overvalued the equity in the\nmarital residence by $1,417.54. As a result of the adjustment, Dena’s equalization payment to\nDavid should be $8,820, and we modify the decree accordingly. We further modify the decree so\nthat child support is consistent with the worksheet attached to this opinion. Additionally, finding\nplain error, we modify the decree so that (1) the uninsured/nonreimbursed healthcare expenses\nincurred on behalf of the minor children are allocated 40 percent to Dena and 60 percent to David;\nand (2) Dena’s share of David’s military retirement pay shall be $363 per month. We affirm the\nremainder of the decree.\n                                                                           AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 19 -\n\f                                                  APPENDIX A\n\nNebraska Child Support Calculator\n\n\n\n                                             Case Name: Araujo v.

INTRODUCTION\n        The Sarpy County District Court dissolved the marriage between Dena M. Araujo and\nDavid R. Araujo. A decree was entered from which Dena has appealed and assigned numerous\nerrors related to parenting time and other contact with the children, child support, property, debts,\ncontempt, military retirement pay, alimony, and guardian ad litem (GAL) and attorney fees. We\naffirm the decree as modified herein.\n                                       II. BACKGROUND\n       Dena and David were married in June 1997; both were 32 years of age at that time. They\nhad four children, namely: Tyler (born 1997), Zachary (born 1999), Dylan (born 2001), and Natalie\n(born 2004). David had been in the Marine Corps as a computer programmer for four years, and\n\n\n\n                                                -1-\n\fthen joined the Air Force as an accountant. He then transferred and worked in space administration\nand operations until his retirement in 2006. After that, he worked with a company called SAIC at\nStrategic Command headquarters doing planning and operations. Dena attended 3½ years of\ncollege, but did not obtain a degree. She speaks English and Swedish, and has worked as a\nchiropractic assistant, worked in a department store at a cosmetics counter, and worked for a\ncompany organizing events in different places. At the time of trial, she was working as a “para”\nfor special education students earning $11.27 per hour.\n        In 2006, David was diagnosed with a sphincter of oddi dysfunction. According to David,\nthis was “an unfortunate side effect” of having his gallbladder removed in 2005. At the time of his\ngallbladder surgery, he was diagnosed with pancreatitis. In 2009, David had a pancreatic attack\nthat put him in the hospital for a month; he lost significant weight and was unable to work for a\ncouple of months. David’s pancreatitis kept getting worse; there were times he could do things and\ntimes he could not.\n        In May 2013, Dena filed a complaint for legal separation. The following month, David\nfiled an answer and “counter-complaint” for dissolution of the marriage. Dena asked for sole legal\nand physical custody of the children, and while David pled he was the fit and proper person to\nhave legal and physical custody of the children, his prayer asked that he and Dena be granted legal\nand physical custody. Each asked for child support and an equitable division of their assets and\ndebts. Dena also asked for the parties to share medical and childcare expenses. Dena requested\nthat David’s parenting time be supervised, that a GAL be appointed for the children, and that David\nbe ordered to undergo a psychological evaluation. Dena also asked for spousal support. David\nrequested a non-hypothecation order restraining both parties from certain actions related to their\nreal and personal property, except in the usual course of business or for the necessities of life.\n        In June 2013, David went to visit his brother in Utah and reconnected with a past friend,\nKimberli Doxey. By July, David and Kimberli had discussed Kimberli moving to Nebraska to help\nDavid after a surgery he had planned in December. By the end of 2013, David rented a home for\nKimberli and two of her children, Andrew Doxey (age 25) and Bridger Doxey (age 15). According\nto Kimberli, Andrew quit his job in Utah to help her provide 24-hour care for David.\n        In December 2013, David had surgery to remove his pancreas, spleen, and part of his\nstomach. Complications from surgery caused stomach fluid to leak into his abdominal cavity and\nit caused him to have a seizure and go into a coma. He was in a coma for about two weeks; he was\nhospitalized from December 2013 until February 2014. From February to July 2014, David tried\nto work about 14 hours per week, but the pain in his abdomen was excruciating. Eating caused the\nmost pain. David has a feeding tube 24 hours a day, and as a result of losing his pancreas, he is\ndiabetic and on insulin. It is difficult for him to stand more than 10 minutes; he cannot stand\nwithout a cane as he “just get[s] too shaky. [His] muscles just won’t let [him].” David’s last day\nof work was July 31, 2014; he cannot work due to his physical limitations.\n        Trial was held on August 18 and 19, and October 1 and 2, 2015. David and four other\nwitnesses testified on his behalf. Dena and one other witness testified on her behalf. The district\ncourt issued findings dated November 19, 2015, and entered a decree of dissolution on February\n4, 2016, with the court’s findings attached and incorporated into the decree. Dena was awarded\ncustody of the children subject to David’s graduated and “therapeutic” parenting schedule. The\nschedule begins with bi-monthly therapeutic parenting time for five months and increases\n\n\n                                               -2-\n\fthereafter until after 11 months when David would have parenting time every other weekend from\n8 a.m. on Saturday until 5 p.m. on Sunday. Holiday parenting time was also scheduled. David was\nordered to pay $1,535 per month in child support, maintain the children on his Tri-Care health\ninsurance plan, and pay 60-percent of nonreimbursed healthcare expenses incurred by the children\nafter the first $480 per child has been paid by Dena. Dena was awarded the marital residence and\n“$270.00 of [David’s] net disposable military pension.” Property and debts were divided, the right\nto claim the children for tax purposes was equally divided between the parties, neither party was\nawarded alimony, and each party was ordered to pay their own attorney fees and costs. The parties\nwere ordered to pay the GAL fee of $1,726.73, with each to pay 50-percent of that fee. Dena was\nordered to pay a property equalization amount of $9,528.77 within 180 days of entry of the decree.\n        Dena timely appealed.\n                                 III. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n         Dena assigns, reordered, that the district court erred: (1) by awarding David parenting time\nthat was not in the best interests of the children; (2) by failing to prohibit the Doxey family from\nhaving contact with the children; (3) by calculating the child support incorrectly; (4) by not\nawarding Dena all four tax exemptions for 2015; (5) by failing to find David in contempt or\notherwise ruling on pending contempt actions filed by Dena; (6) by failing to give Dena full credit\nfor temporary order arrears; (7) in its division of the marital estate by (a) miscalculating the equity\nin the marital residence, (b) miscalculating the division of household goods and gifts, (c) including\na $4,500 loan as a marital debt, and (d) determining the 2012 tax debt was a marital debt; (8) by\nfailing to include standard provisions in the decree to protect Dena’s interests in David’s military\nretirement pay; (9) by failing to award alimony to Dena; and (10) by failing to equitably divide the\nGAL fees and failing to order David to pay any of Dena’s attorney fees.\n                                  IV. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n        In actions for dissolution of marriage, an appellate court reviews the case de novo on the\nrecord to determine whether there has been an abuse of discretion by the trial judge. Coufal v.\nCoufal, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">291</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Neb.</span> <span class=\"page\">378</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">866</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2015). This standard of review applies to the trial court’s\ndeterminations regarding custody, child support, the division of property, alimony, and attorney\nfees. Id.\n        Child custody and parenting time determinations are matters initially entrusted to the\ndiscretion of the trial court, and although reviewed de novo on the record, the trial court’s\ndetermination will normally be affirmed absent an abuse of discretion. See State on behalf of\nMaddox S. v. Matthew E., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Neb. Ct. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">500</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2016).\n        An abuse of discretion occurs when a trial court bases its decision upon reasons that are\nuntenable or unreasonable or if its action is clearly against justice or conscience, reason, and\nevidence. Id. A judicial abuse of discretion requires that the reasons or rulings of the trial court be\nclearly untenable insofar as they unfairly deprive a litigant of a substantial right and a just result.\nId.\n        In child custody cases, where the credible evidence is in conflict on a material issue of fact,\nthe appellate court considers, and may give weight to, the fact that the trial judge heard and\nobserved the witnesses and accepted one version of the facts rather than another. Id.\n\n\n                                                 -3-\n\f                                           V. ANALYSIS\n                             1. PARENTING TIME AWARDED TO DAVID\n        The district court found that both Dena and David were fit and proper persons to have the\ncare, custody, and control of their minor children, but that it was in the best interests of the minor\nchildren that custody be awarded to Dena, subject to David’s graduated and “therapeutic”\nparenting schedule. The schedule begins with bi-monthly therapeutic parenting time for five\nmonths and increases thereafter until after 11 months when David would have parenting time every\nother weekend from 8 a.m. on Saturday until 5 p.m. on Sunday. Holiday parenting time was also\nscheduled.\n        Dena argues that the amount of parenting time awarded to David “is far in excess of that\nwhich he is physically capable of exercising at this time, not in line with the recommendation of\nthe expert witness, and not in the best interests of the minor children.” Brief for appellant at 16.\nDena claims that David’s “physical health is a real problem,” and the family’s therapist, Traci\nPenrod-McCormick, “clearly indicated that it would not be in the best interests of the children to\nextend visitation longer than 3-4 hours at a time.” Brief for appellant at 16.\n        Penrod-McCormick has been the family’s therapist since July 2013; she was agreed upon\nby the parties and the GAL. She received a master’s degree in social work in 2004, and is a licensed\nclinical social worker and a licensed independent mental health practitioner in Nebraska. Children\nand families have been the focus of Penrod-McCormick’s professional and clinical experience.\nShe saw just the children “maybe one or two times a month.” In September or October 2013, she\nstarted sessions with the children and David, and according to Penrod-McCormick, David had\n“about twelve” therapeutic visits with the children since that time until mid-August 2015.\n        Penrod-McCormick said the children “function fine in their daily lives and at school.” She\nhas discussed “having visitation with their father,” and in the beginning “it became pretty volatile,\nlots of anger came out, and [she] didn’t think [they] were making a lot of progress at that point.”\nThe children were frustrated, “feeling as though their father wasn’t understanding where they were\ncoming from emotionally, and then his response to that, they became upset.” According to\nPenrod-McCormick, David would “say he was sorry and he loved them. And then he would say,\nbut you have to think about how I feel. You have to think about [sic] from my perspective.”\nPenrod-McCormick thought this made it difficult for the children “to feel like [David] was hearing\nthem.” She did not believe there had been any progress made in the relationship between David\nand the children since they started therapy two years prior. She described their relationship as\n“[s]uperficial.” She explained:\n                 Dad is always very open about how he loves them and wants to see them. He’s very\n        open, but it doesn’t go any further than that. The kids will talk about what’s going on at\n        school. They’ll talk about their sporting events. But it doesn’t go any further than that.\n                 ....\n                 [David] attends, he asks questions, he asks how they are, asks how they’re doing,\n        but it’s never - you know, there have been times where, like the kids have said, you say\n        you’re going to come but you don’t come. But then that turns into, but I’m sick and you\n        have to realize that I’m sick, and I can’t do this because I’m sick, but - and it just becomes\n        a circle of - and kind of a rabbit hole of everybody going all these different ways and there’s\n\n\n                                                 -4-\n\f       no resolution, so - but, for the most part, it’s just, how are things, how is it going, this is\n       how I’m doing in this, this is how soccer is going, and that’s it.\n\n       Going forward, she suggested continued therapy with David and her, “[a]nd then . . .\nmoving into some visitation I think is fine.” However, Penrod-McCormick was concerned about\nlong periods of parenting time, such as 6 to 8 hours of extended time or overnights, stating:\n               I’ve heard over and over from everybody how sick [David] is, and at this point I\n       am not in a place where I believe that he can emotionally and physically support these\n       children outside of - in these long times, these long periods of time. There’s four active\n       children that not only are busy but are active and intellectual.\n\nPenrod-McCormick said she was fine with 3 to 4 hours on a Saturday and Sunday, “[b]ut outside\nof that, I think it’s too much.” She also said David\n         needs to be able to put his adult feelings aside and focus on the needs of - emotional needs\n         of his children and attend to those, work through his adult stuff on his own, but his primary\n         focus needs to be on his kids’ emotional needs in relation to getting them together. So\n         accept that they’re angry, and instead of trying to constantly say, yeah, but, and make\n         excuses for it, accept that they’re angry. Honor that anger and say, how can we move\n         forward.\n\nPenrod-McCormick said she talked to David about this, “maybe even a year ago,” but there had\nbeen no progress on this.\n        David argues that while he “has limitations that may not be experienced by other parents,\nthey do not prevent him from acting as a father.” Brief for appellee at 13-14. David testified that\nduring his parenting time with the children in 2013 (prior to the mandated therapeutic visitation),\nhe took the children for ice cream and fries, they went on walks, went fishing, played games on\nthe Wii, and watched movies. “The parties’ children are ages 11-18 (at the time of trial), and are\nold enough to assist in the procurement of their needs.” Brief for appellee at 14. David testified\nthat “[i]f there was no court involved, it is my opinion that [Dena] would take the children and\nmake sure they never saw me again.”\n        Keeping the evidence and the court’s findings in mind, we now consider the legal principles\ngoverning parenting time matters. The trial court has discretion to set a reasonable parenting time\nschedule. Thompson v. Thompson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Neb. Ct.

The best interests of the children are the primary and paramount considerations in\ndetermining and modifying visitation rights. Thompson, supra. The best interests inquiry has its\nfoundation in both statutory and case law.\n        Neb. Rev. Stat. 43-2923(6) (Reissue 2016) provides that in determining custody and\nparenting arrangements:\n        [T]he court shall consider the best interests of the minor child, which shall include, but not\n        be limited to, consideration of . . . :\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f               (a) The relationship of the minor child to each parent prior to the commencement\n       of the action or any subsequent hearing;\n               (b) The desires and wishes of the minor child, if of an age of comprehension but\n       regardless of chronological age, when such desires and wishes are based on sound\n       reasoning;\n               (c) The general health, welfare, and social behavior of the minor child;\n               (d) Credible evidence of abuse inflicted on any family or household member . . . ;\n       and\n               (e) Credible evidence of child abuse or neglect or domestic intimate partner\n       abuse. . . .\n\n        Other pertinent factors include the moral fitness of the child’s parents, including sexual\nconduct; respective environments offered by each parent; the age, sex, and health of the child and\nparents; the effect on the child as a result of continuing or disrupting an existing relationship; the\nattitude and stability of each parent’s character; and parental capacity to provide physical care and\nsatisfy educational needs of the child.

DOXEY FAMILY\n        Clearly, Dena does not think much of David’s girlfriend, Kimberli. Kimberli had filed a\nprotection order against Dena for stalking Kimberli’s children, and Dena says “the allegations were\nso unfounded that the case was dismissed after [Kimberli’s] testimony and without [Dena] having\nto even put forth a defense.” Brief for appellant at 20. Dena also expressed concern about\nKimberli’s adult son, Andrew, who Dena believed, but was unable to prove, was involved in a\njuvenile case of a sexual nature. Based upon alleged inconsistent statements from David and\nKimberli’s testimony on this issue, Dena claims, “It is obvious [Kimberli] did not tell the truth and\nthat makes her even more dangerous to the Araujo children. She is someone willing to defy court\norders[,] . . . file protection orders without any legal or factual basis, and lie under oath in court.”\nBrief for appellant at 21.\n        David argues that “Dena has provided no concrete, direct evidence as to the supposed\nallegations against Andrew,” and that she “continues to assert allegations of a sexual nature, but\nfailed to bring forth any evidence that such an event occurred.” Brief for appellee at 17. “Dena’s\nopposing testimony and belief that Kimberli lied regarding the supposed allegations against\nAndrew, does not automatically make the allegations true.” Id. Furthermore, “[i]t is evident from\nDena’s testimony that she does nothing to help foster a relationship between her children and their\nfather or Kimberli.” Id. at 18. When asked if she told the children that David’s live-in girlfriend is\nsomeone with whom they should not have a relationship, Dena responded:\n                   The kids hate Kim. They despise her. . . . You know, they’re very bright kids, and\n        they’ve been fortunate enough to grow up around families where the children live with\n        both of their parents and they know this is wrong. I don’t need to spell it out for them. It’s\n        wrong. They’re Christians. They know right from wrong.\n\n\n\n                                                 -6-\n\f        Penrod-McCormick testified that the children are angry with Kimberli’s “presence,” and\nthere have been interactions between her and the children “that have upset the children, and at this\npoint they stated they are not comfortable being around her nor do they want to have contact with\nher.” The children “do not want to be in the presence of the Doxey family at all.” On\ncross-examination, Penrod-McCormick was asked how many times the children had been around\nKimberli. Penrod-McCormick said “I know for sure the two younger kids during one visitation.”\n        David argues that the trial court weighed the evidence and testimony presented and\ndetermined that no limitation on visitation was necessary and, therefore, did not provide one. We\nagree with David’s summation. Based on the evidence presented, the district court’s failure to\nprohibit the Doxey family from having contact with the parties’ children was not an abuse of\ndiscretion.\n                                        3. CHILD SUPPORT\n        Commencing December 1, 2015, David was ordered to pay $1,535 per month in child\nsupport for four children, which reduced to $1,309 per month when only three children remained\nas minors, $1,137 per month for two children, and $781 per month when only one child remained\na minor. Dena contends the district court adopted a child support calculation which did not comport\nto the evidence presented at trial, wrongly assigned incomes to each party, and wrongly credited\nDavid for monthly health care premiums related to the children.\n                                        (a) David’s Income\n         Regarding income, Dena claims that exhibit 7 (offered by David) shows two primary\nsources of income received each month: Veterans Affairs (VA) disability of $3,776 per month (not\ntaxed) and military retirement pay of $1,676 per month (taxed). The child support worksheet\nincorporated into the decree shows $3,700 in non-taxable income and $985.33 in taxable monthly\nincome. Dena argues that the non-taxable VA disability should reflect the full $3,776 per month,\nand with regard to the military retirement pay, that amount should have been $1,406 (this accounts\nfor the $270 per month awarded to Dena from David’s military retirement pay). Dena believes the\ndistrict court relied upon exhibit 22, which she claims contains incorrect information.\n         Exhibit 7 actually shows that David’s gross military retirement pay is $2,053 per month,\nand after “SBP Costs” and federal and state income tax deductions, his net pay is $1,676.82. In his\nbrief, David acknowledges the court’s error, and agrees that his net retirement pay amount (after\naccounting for the $270 in military retirement pay awarded to Dena) should have been $1,406\n($1,676 minus $270).\n         As for David’s non-taxable disability pay, Exhibit 7 contains a letter from the VA, showing\nthat David was entitled to a monthly payment of $3,712.87 because he was a Veteran with five\ndependents. Dena’s assertion that David’s VA disability is $3,776 per month comes from a bank\nstatement in exhibit 7 showing a deposit of $3,776 into David’s bank account in May 2015.\nAccording to David’s testimony, the extra amount of the deposit above the $3,712.87 can be\nattributed to money he received from donated leave; he testified that at the time of trial that money\nfrom donated leave is no longer available to him. We cannot say that the court’s use of $3,700 for\nDavid’s VA disability was an abuse of discretion (especially since, as noted below, the district\ncourt also attributed a lower hourly wage to Dena’s employment).\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\f       Having reviewed the record, we find that David’s total monthly income includes $3,700\nfrom non-taxable disability, and $2,053 in gross military retirement pay. From his gross military\nretirement pay, federal and state income taxes will be deducted, as will the “SBP Costs” which\nwere not challenged by Dena. As will be discussed later in this opinion, the district court\nincorrectly calculated the military retirement pay awarded to Dena; under our later modification,\nDena is awarded $363 per month from David’s military retirement pay. Accordingly, in our child\nsupport calculation, David will also receive a credit for the $363 in military retirement pay awarded\nto Dena. We will modify the child support worksheet accordingly, as discussed in more detail later.\n                                         (b) Dena’s Income\n         The district court attributed a total monthly income of $3,705 to Dena. The court used “a\n3-year average for trust distribution, and a percentage split of [David’s] military pension of\n$270.00 owed to [Dena] in determining gross income.” As will be discussed later, the 3-year\naverage for the trust distribution from 2013 to 2015 was $18,000 ($1,500 per month). Using the\nnumbers above, the district court necessarily attributed $1,935 per month to Dena’s income from\nemployment; this is the same amount David attributed to Dena’s employment income in his\nproposed child support calculation (exhibit 22). Although David said the $1,935 per month income\nwas calculated using $11.25 per hour for a 40-hour workweek, by our calculation $1,935 per month\nequates to $11.16 per hour, 40 hours per week, 52 weeks per year.\n         With regard to Dena’s income, she claims the $44,460 per year ($3,705 per month) in\nincome that the district court attributed to her was “well above what the evidence suggests.” Brief\nfor appellant at 24. She earns $11 per hour and works “about 30 hours per week, 42 weeks out of\nthe year.” Id. According to her testimony, at the time of trial, she was working as a “para” for\nspecial education students earning $11.27 per hour. Dena testified that in Spring 2014, she was\nworking 32.5 hours per week. There was no other testimony regarding the number of hours per\nweek she worked, nor the number of weeks per year. However, she did testify that she is able to\ndrop her daughter off at school and pick her up at the end of the day, and if the children have a day\noff, so does Dena; this suggests a school day schedule. When asked if she had applications out for\nother employment, Dena said, “No. This . . . is the perfect job,” because it allowed her to have the\nsame schedule as her children.\n         David argues that Dena has the ability to work year-round, but has voluntarily opted out.\nDena testified that she can “work summer school” but did not do so in either 2014 or 2015. In\n2014, she was preparing for trial, which “was supposed to be the court date at that point.” And, “I\nneeded to prepare myself for this. There have been a lot of lies told, and I needed to have a set-up\nto -- to demonstrate the truth.” David argues that “[u]nder the Child Support Guidelines, it is\ncompletely within the discretion of the trial court to impute a wage to Dena that comports with her\ncapacity to earn,” and he should not be penalized for her choice to remain at home. Brief for\nappellee at 20.\n         In general, child support payments should be set according to the Nebraska Child Support\nGuidelines. Freeman v. Groskopf, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">286</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Neb.</span> <span class=\"page\">713</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2013). The guidelines provide\nthat “[i]f applicable, earning capacity may be considered in lieu of a parent’s actual, present income\nand may include factors such as work history, education, occupational skills, and job opportunities.\nEarning capacity is not limited to wage-earning capacity, but includes moneys available from all\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\fsources.” Freeman, 286 Neb. at 721, 838 N.W.2d at 307. See, also, Neb. Ct. R. § 4-204 (rev. 2016).\nUse of earning capacity to calculate child support is useful “when it appears that the parent is\ncapable of earning more income than is presently being earned.” Freeman, 286 Neb. at 721, 838\nN.W.2d at 307.\n         Dena testified that she earns $11.27 per hour, and by choice does not work full-time. In\naddition, she was not looking for different employment because she liked having the same schedule\nas her children. As stated previously, it appears that the district court attributed $1,935 per month\nto Dena’s income from employment; the same amount David attributed to Dena’s employment\nincome in his proposed child support calculation (exhibit 22). This monthly amount equates to\n$11.16 per hour, 40 hours per work, 52 weeks per year. Based on our review of the record, we\ncannot say that the district court abused its discretion in attributing such earning capacity to Dena.\n         Dena also acknowledges attribution of $270 (now modified to $363) in income per month\nas a result of the award from David’s military retirement, but challenges the court’s use of a 3-year\naverage for her trust distribution. Dena testified that she receives an annual payout from her\nfather’s estate. She claims the only evidence of her inheritance distributions is found in exhibit 24,\nwhich shows a 3-year average for 2013-2015 of $18,000 per year ($1,500 per month), and “there\nis no evidence to the contrary.” Brief for appellant at 24.

Dena also argues that the inheritance should not be\nattributed as income for child support purposes, and “leave[s] this for this Court to decide.” Id.\nWith regard to Dena’s inheritance, David argues that it was properly considered by the court as a\nsource of funds for purposes of child support because the court must consider income derived from\nall sources.\n         For purposes of calculating child support, the court must consider the total monthly income,\nwhich is “income of both parties derived from all sources, except all means-tested public assistance\nbenefits which includes any earned income tax credit and payments received for children of prior\nmarriages.” § 4-204 (emphasis supplied). This includes trust distributions. See Hughes v. Hughes,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Neb. Ct.

We will modify the child support worksheet accordingly, as discussed in more\ndetail later.\n                                    (c) Health Insurance Credit\n       As to the $93 per month health insurance premium credit given to David, Dena argues that\nDavid testified at previous hearings that his monthly cost for himself and the children was $45.\n\n\n                                                -9-\n\fDena says the only exhibit offered to show health premium costs was exhibit 23, and it reflects a\npast due amount of $46.32. She also says “[i]t is unknown as to why Exhibit 23 shows the current\namount due of $92.64, but it is exactly 2x the amount past due which cannot be an accident.” Brief\nfor appellant at 26. At trial, David testified that his health insurance premium cost was $138 per\nmonth. But in his brief he argues that the court can easily surmise from exhibit 23 that the monthly\ncost for the health insurance premium is $93. We have reviewed exhibit 23, a UnitedHealthcare\nStatement dated January 12, 2015, and it shows the total amount due as $138.96; this included\n$46.32 (past due) plus $92.64 (current due). Exhibit 23 was the only documentary evidence of the\nhealth insurance premium presented to the district court, and it was the district court’s decision to\nattribute $93 per month to the health insurance premium; this was not an abuse of discretion.\nFurthermore, because this is the only documentary evidence in the record regarding the premium,\nwe cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in awarding the entire amount as a credit\nin the child support worksheet.\n                                (d) New Child Support Calculation\n        Based on the foregoing, we have modified the child support calculation and attached the\nworksheet to this opinion as appendix A. In our calculation, Dena was attributed a total monthly\nincome of $3,798. David was attributed a total monthly income of $2,053 from his military\nretirement pay, and tax-exempt income of $3,700 from his VA disability. David was also given\n“Other Deductions” totaling $497.62 ($363 for military retirement pay awarded to Dena and\n$134.62 for “SBP Costs” which were not challenged by Dena), and a health insurance premium\ncredit of $93. Finally, because the district court ordered that each party was entitled to claim two\nminor children for dependency and exemption benefits, our calculation includes three exemptions\nfor each party (the party, plus two children).\n        Pursuant to the new calculation, David’s child support obligation is $1,642 per month for\nfour children; $1,400 per month for three children; $1,219 per month for two children; and when\nonly one child remains a minor, David shall pay $844 per month. We modify the decree\naccordingly.\n                                    (e) Order for Direct Payment\n        Dena also contends that the court should have ordered that child support payments be\ndirectly paid from David’s VA disability, if such a direct payment is allowed. David contends that\nDena never presented this issue to the trial court and that “‘an issue not properly presented to and\npassed upon by the trial court may not be raised on appeal.’” Brief for appellee at 22 (quoting\nGebhardt v.

The discrepancy was raised at the\nmotion for new trial, but not raised in the briefs on appeal. Accordingly, finding plain error, we\nmodify the decree so that the uninsured/nonreimbursed healthcare expenses incurred on behalf of\nthe minor children are allocated 40-percent to Dena and 60-percent to David. This is in line with\neach parent’s respective percent share of the child support obligation. See Neb. Ct. R. § 4-215 (rev.\n2011).\n                                        4. TAX EXEMPTIONS\n        Dena argues that the trial court erred by not awarding her all four exemptions for 2015,\nbecause David claimed all four children in 2013 and two children in 2014 (despite the court\nawarding all four exemptions to Dena for 2014). David argues that the tax exemption issue was\nclearly within the purview of the trial court to determine. Upon our de novo review, we cannot say\nthat the district court abused its discretion in awarding Dena only two, rather than all four,\ndependency exemptions for 2015.\n                              5. CONTEMPT ACTIONS FILED BY DENA\n        Dena argues, “The Court erred by not finding [David] in contempt for failure to pay child\nsupport as alleged and as supported by the evidence adduced at trial. Actually, the Court made no\nactual finding as to the show cause issues, but such are deemed to have been denied absent a ruling\nto the contrary.” Brief for appellant at 36. According to Dena, two contempt actions were filed in\nthis case: the first contempt action was filed on September 9, 2014, for failure to pay child support,\nand it was “basically merged with the second contempt action” filed on July 20, 2015, based upon\na continued failure to pay child support. Brief for appellant at 37. She contends that the district\ncourt only needed to rule on the second action. (Neither the September 2014 nor the July 2015\npleadings appear in our record.) Dena claims that over a 24-month period from July 2013 through\nJune 2015, David paid only $36,800 of the $52,000 owed in child support. She acknowledges that\nDavid paid an additional $3,300 just before trial, but even so, he still “underpaid $13,000 in child\nsupport during the period of time related to either or both of the show cause actions.” Brief for\nappellant at 37. Dena states that David had the income, but he chose not to pay the child support\nowed.\n        Dena contends that the contempt filings also raised David’s failure to make house payments\nas ordered. According to Dena, “David chose to pay his new debts related to the Doxey family, his\nnew life, and the debts related to his new house, instead of paying the Court ordered debts for the\nAraujo family.” Brief for appellant at 38.\n        David argues that “[t]here is nothing in the record to indicate that Dena preserved her\nargument for appeal regarding any alleged contempt of David. Additionally, there is nothing in the\nrecord before this court which would contemplate grounds for appeal, regarding contempt[.]” Brief\nfor appellee at 28.\n        As stated previously, our record does not contain any pleadings regarding an application(s)\nfor contempt. However, the contempt action(s) were mentioned at various hearings in September\n\n\n                                                - 11 -\n\fand November 2014 and in May 2015. It appears that the contempt action(s) were continued to the\ndate of trial. And the record from the trial reflects that the contempt action(s) were to be heard at\nthe same time as trial. The February 2016 divorce decree does not address the contempt action(s),\nand no other order disposing of the contempt action(s) appears in our record.

CREDIT FOR TEMPORARY ORDER ARREARS\n        Dena says that while the district court did include child support arrearages of $9,132 “in\nthe balance sheet,” it failed to factor in “the arrears for missed house payments (ordered in lieu of\nalimony) into the balance sheet.” Brief for appellant at 28. We note that the “balance sheet” does\nnot specifically state that the arrears included were for child support.\n        Dena claims David made no house payments from December 2014 through November\n2015 when the court entered “its tentative findings in the case (11 months) or for the 14 months\nbetween the times the payments were reinstated and the Decree was entered by the Court thereby\nterminating the provisions of the temporary order.” Id. Based on monthly house payments of\n$1,418 (exhibit 16), Dena claims the court failed to preserve the $15,598 (11 months) or the\n$19,852 (14 months) David was previously ordered to pay her under the temporary order. Dena\ncontends the court should have done one of two things: (1) included the house payment arrears in\nthe balance sheet for the marital estate, or (2) preserved such arrearage from the temporary order\nso that Dena could bring the issue in the form of a show cause action against David in the future.\n        As stated previously, David’s failure to make mortgage payments was the subject of the\ncontempt actions(s). Although the contempt actions(s) were heard at the same time as trial, the\nFebruary 2016 divorce decree does not address the contempt action(s); nor does the decree\nspecifically address the mortgage arrears. Because no other order disposing of the contempt\naction(s) appears in our record, we do not have jurisdiction over the contempt actions(s) because\nwe lack a final appealable order of such action(s).

Setting aside nonmarital property is simple if the spouse\npossesses the original asset, but can be problematic if the original asset no longer exists.

Id.\n                                    (a) Marital Residence Equity\n         The district court awarded Dena the marital residence and attributed $41,112.54 in equity\nto it; she claims the equity should have only been $37,593 (a difference of $3,519.54). To arrive\nat its equity value, Dena claims the court erroneously relied upon David’s proffered balance on the\nmortgage as of April 30, 2014, which was nearly a year after David had vacated the residence.\nDena says the home was valued at $242,000 (appraised value from exhibit 27) and the amount\nowed at the time of separation was $204,407, so the equity was $37,593. She says that exhibit 16\nshows the home mortgage balance to be $203,707 as of August 7, 2013. She then suggests the\nstatements reflect the unpaid principal balance was decreasing by $350 per month with each\npayment. “Therefore, to determine the unpaid principal balance as of the date of separation, the\nCourt simply needed to multiply $350 to the number of months between the date of separation and\nthe date of the August statement (2 months) and then add that amount to the amount of unpaid\nprincipal balance on the August statement to determine that the unpaid principal balance in June\n2013 was approximately $204,407.00 ($203,707.00 + $700.00).” Brief for appellant at 30.\n         David argues that “it is important for the court to note that during the parties’ separation,\nDavid was still making some mortgage payments for the marital home - payments that would allow\nthe amount of equity on behalf of Dena to rise.” Brief for appellee at 25. He claims “[i]t is\nreasonable and within the Court’s discretion to consider payments made by David toward the\nmarital home when dividing the assets.” Id. He points out that Dena states the difference between\nthe amount of equity calculated by the trial court and the amount that should have been used was\n$3,519.54. But, citing to exhibit 16, David states that the payments he made on the mortgage after\nseparation total at least $7,089.75.\n         “There is no ‘hard and fast’ rule concerning valuation dates so long as the selected date\nbears a rational relationship to the property to be divided, and the selected date is reviewed for an\nabuse of discretion.” Myhra v.

The\ndistrict court’s decree does not specifically state how it reached the equity value of the marital\nhome. But an equity value of $41,112.54, would mean a home mortgage of $200,887.46; this\namount coincides with the unpaid principal balance in the mortgage statement dated April 30, 2014\n(exhibit 18, page 5). Exhibit 16, page 8, shows that the unpaid principal balance as of December\n\n\n                                                 - 13 -\n\f23, 2013, was $202,305. Exhibit 16 also shows that David paid the mortgage due through\nDecember. Because David was making the mortgage payments on the residence through\nDecember, the equity should follow. Therefore, the equity in the home should have been calculated\nat $39,695 ($242,000 appraised value - $202,305 unpaid balance in December 2013). Upon our\nde novo review, we find that the court overvalued the home equity by $1,417.54.\n                            (b) Division of Household Goods and Gifts\n         The court attributed a value of $4,019 to Dena for household goods awarded to her, and a\nvalue of $525 awarded to David. Dena claims the court “made no less than 6 mistakes in its\ninclusion of multiple assets which should not have been considered marital assets.” Brief for\nappellant at 30. She claims a sofa and loveseat ($425 value) were delivered and paid for post-\nseparation. David claims the sofa and loveseat were ordered before separation, and that Dena did\nnot prove the asset was nonmarital. He acknowledges the conflicting testimony of the parties and\nstates that in such cases it is for the trial court to make a judgment.\n        Dena claims that a $30 mixer was premarital and two bedroom sets ($325 value) were\npurchased with inherited money. However, David claims she did not meet her burden of proving\nthat the items were nonmarital.\n        Dena claims that multiple items (valued at $620) were gifted to the children and yet\ncredited to her in the division of debts and assets. She also claims a sauna was not included in the\ndivision of debts and assets; she claims the sauna was gifted to her, but that David sold it around\nthe time of the divorce for $500 and used the money for his own purposes. David argues that\nDena’s claims are unsubstantiated.\n        After our de novo review of the record, we find that Dena did not meet her burden to prove\nthat any of the foregoing items should have been considered nonmarital property.

Dena argues that “[t]here was very little if any credible evidence offered to\nsupport the notion that this was a marital debt.” Brief for appellant at 32-33. She says the only\nevidence of the loan is found in exhibit 18 which shows David took out a loan for $4,500 sometime\nprior to June 2013. “There was no evidence to support [Dena] having any idea that such Loan\nexisted or what the purpose and use was” for the loan. Brief for appellant at 33. She argues it could\nhave been used for a motorcycle deemed nonmarital, or to pay attorney fees or child support, and\nfurther, it is unknown into which bank account the loan was deposited. She claims David gave\nthree different answers when questioned about the loan, and there was no evidence “as to which\nanswer was correct - vehicle, motorcycle hobby or personal reasons.” Id.\n         David argues the loan was incurred during the time of the marriage and is therefore\nconsidered a marital debt unless proven otherwise by Dena, and she did not prove otherwise. He\ntestified that Dena knew about the loan, which was for his hobby of building and restoring\nmotorcycles, something in which even the children participated.\n         Based upon our de novo review of the record, we cannot say that the district court abused\nits discretion when it determined that the debt was marital property and included it in the marital\n\n\n                                               - 14 -\n\festate.

We find no error with\nrespect to this portion of the district court’s decree.\n                                         (d) 2012 Tax Debt\n        The district court determined that a 2012 tax debt of $2,365 was marital debt, and assigned\nthat debt to David. Dena argues that there was insufficient evidence to support that this was a\nmarital debt. Further, to the extent it could be justified as a marital debt, then the 2012 tax refund\nof $2,138 should have been a marital asset. David claimed the refund went into a joint account,\nbut Dena claims “[n]o such deposit appears in the joint account statements” and Dena claimed she\ndid not receive any of this refund.\n        David testified that the tax bill ($2,365) was outstanding at the time of separation, but that\nhe had paid the bill prior to trial. He further testified that the outstanding bill was for a joint tax\nreturn. He testified that the parties historically amended their tax returns once Dena started\nreceiving checks from her father.\n        After a de novo review of the record, we cannot say that the district court abused its\ndiscretion in determining that the 2012 tax debt was marital.\n                                      (e) Equalization Payment\n       The only adjustment we made to the court’s “balance sheet” is with regard to the equity in\nthe marital residence, which we determined was $39,695 instead of $41,112.54; a difference of\n$1,417.54. Because the district court divided the marital estate 50/50, Dena’s equalization payment\nmust be reduced by $708.77 ($1,417.54 ÷ 2). Her new equalization payment to David is $8,820\nand the decree is modified accordingly.\n                                     8. MILITARY RETIREMENT\n        The decree states: “[Dena] is awarded $270.00 of [David’s] net disposable military\npension. The payment thereof shall commence on the first day of the month following the entry of\nthe Decree of Dissolution of Marriage.” Although the decree does not specifically state that Dena\nis awarded $270 “per month,” we read the decree to award a monthly payment; and the parties do\nnot dispute that the award was for $270 “per month.”\n        Dena argues that a percentage of the military retirement pay should have been awarded\nrather than a set amount, and that by not using “the coverture method,” she will not receive cost\nof living increases or other such benefits. Brief for appellant at 39. Dena requests that the matter\nbe remanded to the court “to determine how many months [David] was in the military and how\nmany of those months overlapped with the marriage of the parties in order for the Court to\ndetermine what percentage of the retirement should be awarded to both [Dena] and [David].” Id.\nHowever, David argues that Dena does not cite to any proof that she presented this issue to the\ntrial court, and “[h]er failure to present issues she now wants to complain about, renders them void\nfor consideration on appeal.” Brief for appellee at 29.\n        David is correct that Dena never specifically asked the district court to use the coverture\nformula when determining Dena’s share of David’s military retirement pay. At trial, however,\nDavid raised the issue. David’s attorney stated, “I just wanted to put to [sic] the record the\ncoverture formula.” Thereafter, between the attorney’s questions and David’s answers, the record\n\n\n\n                                                - 15 -\n\freveals that David had 248 months of total military service, of which 108 months were served\nwhile married to Dena. The coverture formula can be used when a portion of a retirement pension\nhas been earned by one spouse during the marriage, with other portions being earned before and/or\nafter the marriage. The coverture formula takes the number of months of service earned while\nmarried and divides that by the total number of months of service. See Bergmeier v. Bergmeier,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4184354\"><a href=\"/opinion/4407101/bergmeier-v-bergmeier/\"><span class=\"volume\">296</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Neb.</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">894</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2017). In this case, 108 months divided by 248 months results in\n43.54 percent of David’s retirement pay being considered marital. If Dena was awarded one-half\nof that, she would receive 21.63 percent of David’s net monthly retirement pay, which at the time\nof trial was $1,676.82. This would result in Dena receiving $362.70 per month, if a fixed amount\nwas awarded.\n         However, instead of $362.70 per month being awarded to Dena, the district court ordered\na fixed amount of $270 per month. The court provided no explanation for how that figure was\ndetermined. In our de novo review of the record, we conclude that the court’s figure appears to\nhave been derived from exhibit 22, which was offered by David. That exhibit indicates that David’s\nmonthly military retirement pay is $1,256, an amount we know is not correct in light of our review\nof David’s income earlier in this opinion. We have previously determined that David’s net monthly\nretirement pay is $1,676.82. Exhibit 22 also reflects that Dena’s portion of the military retirement\nis an “[a]nticipated 21.55 percent,” which is about one-half of the 43.54 percent we determined\nabove to be the marital portion of David’s retirement pay. If the district court relied upon that net\nmonthly benefit amount ($1,256) and percentage (which appears to derive from the coverture\nformula), the resulting amount for Dena’s share would be $270.66. Therefore, we conclude the\ndistrict court arrived at the fixed amount of $270 per month by relying on an inaccurate monthly\nmilitary retirement figure set forth in exhibit 22. Accordingly, because David’s net monthly\nretirement pay is actually $1,676.82, we find plain error in the fixed dollar amount awarded, and\nmodify the fixed monthly amount from $270 to $363 per month ($1,676.82 × 21.63 percent =\n$362.70). Although Dena argues that the court should have simply awarded a percentage rather\nthan a fixed amount so that she can receive cost of living adjustments, she does not point to any\nevidence in the record where this request was made to the district court. And our review of the\nfederal law applicable to dividing military retirement pay indicates that a court can order either a\npercentage or a fixed monthly amount, with the latter excluded from receiving cost of living\nadjustments. See 10 U.S.C.A. § 1408(a)(2) and (4) (2010 & Cum. Supp. 2017). Since the district\ncourt could award either option, and Dena failed to put on evidence as to why a percentage award\nwas more appropriate than a fixed amount under the circumstances of this case, we cannot say the\ndistrict court abused its discretion in choosing a fixed award over a percentage award. Accordingly,\nwe modify only the amount of the award as noted above.\n         Additionally, Dena says the decree fails to address the survivor benefit plan (SBP) “which\nis presently available to [Dena] pursuant to the original election made upon [David’s] retirement\nwhile the parties were still married.” Brief for appellant at 38. She claims that David could change\nhis election at any time, and could remove Dena and “insert his new wife as the beneficiary of the\nSBP[.]” Brief for appellant at 39. “The Court should have specifically ordered that the SBP benefit\nis awarded to [Dena] and that [David] has no right to change such election if such option is\navailable to him or may become available to him in the future.” Id.\n\n\n\n                                               - 16 -\n\f         David argues that “[a]t no time prior to this appeal did Dena argue that David should\npreserve the original [SBP] election made on his retirement plan during the parties’ marriage.”\nBrief for appellee at 29. And “[n]owhere in Dena’s brief does she cite to any proof that she\npresented to the trial court the [SBP] election issue[.]” Id.\n         David is correct that Dena never raised the SBP election issue to the district court. Further,\nDena has provided us with no case law in her brief showing us that she is definitively entitled to\nthe SBP election. Because this issue was not presented to or ruled on by the district court, we will\nnot consider the issue in this appeal. See Hargesheimer v. Gale, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4014061\"><a href=\"/opinion/4236800/hargesheimer-v-gale/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Neb.</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">881</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">589</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(2016) (appellate court will not consider issue on appeal that was not presented to or passed upon\nby trial court).\n                                             9. ALIMONY\n        David was ordered to pay the home mortgage of approximately $1,400 per month in lieu\nof temporary alimony. The temporary order filed on August 26, 2013, ordered David to pay the\nmortgage payment and the basic utilities on the marital residence occupied by Dena; although this\norder did not say such payment was “in lieu of alimony,” a complete reading of the record shows\nthat was the intent of the mortgage payment. As noted previously in this opinion, David did pay\nthe mortgage through December 2013, but has made no payments since that time (his mortgage\nobligation was apparently suspended from January through November 2014).\n        Dena says she “was a stay-at-home mother by agreement of the parties for nearly 20 years\nand she has very limited employment marketability and no post high school degrees with which\nshe can depend upon to obtain employment or make a living good enough to independently provide\nfor herself and her four children.” Brief for appellant at 40. Although noting David’s 100-percent\ndisability might weigh against alimony presently, she suggests the district court erred by “not\nfinding that an alimony award of $1 at least be awarded to [Dena] so that a modification action\ncould be filed in the future if a material change in circumstances exists to merit such modification.”\nId.\n        David claims that the district court did not abuse its discretion because he is on a fixed\nincome due to disability, whereas Dena has the ability to engage in gainful employment and has\noutside sources of income, including a large inheritance. He argues that to require him “to provide\nfor an able-bodied, working adult is not equitable in these circumstances.” Brief for appellee at 31.\n        In considering alimony, a court should weigh four factors: (1) the circumstances of the\nparties, (2) the duration of the marriage, (3) the history of contributions to the marriage, and (4)\nthe ability of the party seeking support to engage in gainful employment without interfering with\nthe interests of any minor children in the custody of each party.

In addition to the specific criteria listed in § 42-365, a court should consider\nthe income and earning capacity of each party and the general equities. Brozek, supra.\n        The statutory criteria for dividing property and awarding alimony overlap, but the two\nserve different purposes and courts should consider them separately. Id. The purpose of a property\ndivision is to distribute the marital assets equitably between the parties. Id. The purpose of alimony\nis to provide for the continued maintenance or support of one party by the other when the relative\neconomic circumstances and the other criteria enumerated in § 42-365 make it appropriate. Brozek,\nsupra.\n\n\n                                                - 17 -\n\f        The evidence in the record supports the district court’s decision to deny an alimony award.\nDavid has significant health issues and, as noted by Dena, he is 100-percent disabled. We recognize\nthat Dena was a stay-at-home mother for a number of years. However, at the time of the divorce\nhearing, the parties’ youngest child was almost 11 years old and Dena was working as a “para” for\nspecial education students earning $11.27 per hour; she had the opportunities to work during the\nsummers, but chose not to do so. Additionally, Dena had significant inheritance monies. See\nBauerle v. Bauerle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1851951\"><a href=\"/opinion/1851951/bauerle-v-bauerle/\"><span class=\"volume\">263</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Neb.</span> <span class=\"page\">881</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1851951\"><a href=\"/opinion/1851951/bauerle-v-bauerle/\"><span class=\"volume\">644</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002) (when entering decree for alimony,\ncourt may take into account all property owned by parties at time of decree, whether accumulated\nby joint efforts or acquired by inheritance). After a de novo review of the record and considering\nthe circumstances of this case, we conclude that the denial of alimony was not an abuse of\ndiscretion.\n                                   10. GAL AND ATTORNEY FEES\n        The court ordered Dena and David to each pay one-half the $1,726.73 GAL fee. Dena says\nher income is “substantially lower” than David’s income, and further, “the need for a GAL was\ndirectly related to [David’s] failure to maintain a regular relationship with his children and attempts\nto reintegrate him with the children.” Brief for appellant at 41. Dena also claims she did not want\nto have the GAL in court during trial, but that David asked him to be present, thereby adding to\nthe GAL’s expenses. Dena argues that the court should have ordered David to pay all of the GAL’s\nfees, or for each party to pay in proportion to their current incomes (approximately one-third by\nDena, two-thirds by David). David argues that despite Dena’s claims that the GAL was secured as\na result of his actions, the GAL was appointed subsequent to Dena’s request for the appointment;\ntherefore, the court correctly and properly split the GAL fees equally between the parties. Under\nthe circumstances of this case, the district court did not abuse its discretion in ordering each party\nto pay 50-percent of the GAL fees. See Smith v.

Brief for appellant at 42. These “actions/inactions” by David “significantly increased\nattorney fees” for Dena, and therefore, she argues that the court erred by not ordering David to pay\na reasonable amount in attorney fees to her.\n        David argues that “Dena mischaracterizes the evidence regarding David’s participation in\nthese proceedings,” and that he “participated despite suffering many health related issues.” Brief\nfor appellee at 32. Further, “[t]here is no indication that David acted frivolously in these\nproceedings and he should not be required to bear the burden of both parties’ attorneys where Dena\nhas been equally involved in many of the issues the parties have faced over the last several years.”\nId.\n\n\n\n                                                - 18 -\n\f        A uniform course of procedure exists in Nebraska for the award of attorney fees in\ndissolution cases.

A dissolution court\nshould consider the nature of the case, the amount involved in the controversy, the services actually\nperformed, the results obtained, the length of time required for preparation and presentation of the\ncase, the novelty and difficulty of the questions raised, and the customary charges of the bar for\nsimilar services. Id. After reviewing the relevant factors, we conclude that the district court did not\nabuse its discretion by declining to award Dena attorney fees in the decree.\n                                        VI. CONCLUSION\n        For the reasons stated above, we find that the district court overvalued the equity in the\nmarital residence by $1,417.54. As a result of the adjustment, Dena’s equalization payment to\nDavid should be $8,820, and we modify the decree accordingly. We further modify the decree so\nthat child support is consistent with the worksheet attached to this opinion. Additionally, finding\nplain error, we modify the decree so that (1) the uninsured/nonreimbursed healthcare expenses\nincurred on behalf of the minor children are allocated 40 percent to Dena and 60 percent to David;\nand (2) Dena’s share of David’s military retirement pay shall be $363 per month.
