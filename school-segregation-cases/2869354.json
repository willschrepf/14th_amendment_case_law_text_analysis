Because there is no evidence that the acts\nin question are expressive, we hold that the Free Speech\nClause does not apply. We further hold, however, that the\nBorough’s selective enforcement of its ordinance likely\nviolated the Free Exercise Clause. Because the other\nrequirements for injunctive relief are satisfied, we reverse\nand direct the District Court to issue a preliminary\ninjunction.\n\nI. Background\n\nAn ordinance in the Borough of Tenafly, which\nencompasses 4.4 square miles and has a population of\n13,806,1 provides in pertinent part: \"No person shall place\nany sign or advertisement, or other matter upon any pole,\ntree, curbstone, sidewalk or elsewhere, in any public street\nor public place, excepting such as may be authorized by\nthis or any other ordinance of the Borough.\" Tenafly, N.J.,\nOrdinance 691 Article VIII(7) (1954).2 Although Ordinance\n691 does not allow Borough officials to make exceptions on\na case-by-case basis, in practice they have often done so.\nHouse number signs nailed to utility poles in plain view are\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. See Borough of Tenafly, About Tenafly, at http://www.tenaflynj.org/\nabout.htm (last visited September 20, 2002).\n\n2. Our description of the facts is based on our independent review of the\nrecord because, as explained in more detail below, the First Amendment\nbars us from deferring to the District Court’s factual findings unless they\ninvolve witness credibility. See Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian &\nBisexual Group of Boston, 515 U.S. 557, 567 (1995).\n\n                                4\n\n\nfrequently left in place. Local churches are tacitly allowed to\n\fpost permanent directional signs bearing crosses on\nmunicipal property. Lost animal signs and other private\npostings often remain undisturbed by Borough officials.\nOrange ribbons were affixed to utility poles \"for a lengthy\nperiod of time\" by supporters of the local high school during\na protracted controversy over school regionalization, but\nBorough officials made no effort to remove them. Every\nyear, officials in the small community permit the local\nChamber of Commerce to affix holiday displays to the\nBorough’s utility poles for approximately six weeks during\nthe Christmas holiday season. Red ribbons, wreaths, and\nseasonal holiday lights are attached to the Borough’s utility\npoles as part of these displays.\n\nThe plaintiffs in this case are Orthodox Jewish residents\nof Tenafly3 whose faith forbids them from pushing or\ncarrying objects outside their homes on the Sabbath or\nYom Kippur.4 In accordance with a religious convention\npracticed by Orthodox Jews for over two thousand years,\nhowever, the plaintiffs believe they may engage in such\nactivities outside their homes on the Sabbath within an\neruv, a ceremonial demarcation of an area. Tenafly Eruv\nAss’n, Inc. v. Borough of Tenafly, 155 F. Supp. 2d 142, 146\n(D.N.J. 2001). An eruv extends the space within which\npushing and carrying is permitted on the Sabbath beyond\nthe boundaries of the home, thereby enabling, for example,\nthe plaintiffs to push baby strollers and wheelchairs, and\ncarry canes and walkers, when traveling between home and\nsynagogue. Without an eruv Orthodox Jews who have small\nchildren or are disabled typically cannot attend synagogue\non the Sabbath.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. Tenafly Eruv Association, Inc. (\"TEAI\") is an organization formed to\npromote the creation of an eruv in Tenafly. Chaim Book, Yosifa Book,\nand Stefanie Dardik Gotlieb live in Tenafly. At the time of briefing in this\nappeal, Stephen Brenner was not a Tenafly resident, but was building a\nhouse in Tenafly and planned to move there once it was completed. For\nsimplicity, we refer to TEAI and the individual plaintiffs collectively as\n\"the plaintiffs\" throughout this opinion.\n\n4. For simplicity, we refer throughout the remainder of our opinion only\nto the Sabbath.\n\n                                5\n\n\nCenturies ago, an eruv would be built using ropes and\nwooden poles. Today, Orthodox Jews can construct an eruv\nby attaching lechis--thin black strips made of the same\nhard plastic material as, and nearly identical to, the\ncoverings on ordinary ground wires--vertically along utility\npoles. Along with preexisting horizontal overhead utility\nlines, the lechis designate an eruv’s boundaries.5 Unless one\nknows which black plastic strips are lechis and which are\nutility wires, it is \"absolutely impossible\" to distinguish the\ntwo. Id. at 149. Throughout this litigation, the plaintiffs\nhave maintained that an eruv (as well as each constituent\nlechi) is \"not a religious symbol,\" but rather is an item with\n\"religious significance.\" Id. at 148.\n\fOn June 1, 1999, Erez Gotlieb and Gary Osen, two\nOrthodox Jews who are not parties to this case, met with\nTenafly Mayor Ann Moscovitz to discuss creating an eruv in\nthe Borough. Gotlieb and Osen met with Moscovitz because\nunder Orthodox Jewish law an eruv is not valid unless a\ncivil official with jurisdiction over the circumscribed area\nissues a ceremonial proclamation \"renting\" the area for a\nnominal fee (e.g., one dollar). The Mayor said she lacked\nauthority to issue the requested proclamation, but agreed\nto bring the matter to the attention of the Borough Council,\nthe Borough’s legislative branch.6 She did not mention\nOrdinance 691 or suggest that affixing lechis to utility poles\nmight violate any other ordinance.\n\nAt the next Council meeting, on July 8, 1999, the\nCouncil and approximately thirty Tenafly residents debated\nwhether the Borough should grant the proclamation. Many\nof those present expressed vehement objections prompted\nby their fear that an eruv would encourage Orthodox Jews\nto move to Tenafly. A Council member whom the District\nCourt was unable to identify noted \"a concern that the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. Many major cities across the United States--such as Washington,\nD.C., New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Baltimore, Atlanta,\nand Cincinnati--have one or more eruvs. Both the White House and the\nUnited States Supreme Court are within the boundaries of an eruv.\n\n6. Six Council members compose the Borough’s legislative branch. The\nMayor does not participate in lawmaking unless the Council is\ndeadlocked, in which case she casts the tie-breaking vote.\n\n                                6\n\n\nOrthodoxy would take over\" Tenafly. Id. at 151-52. One\nCouncil member voiced his \"serious concern\" that \"Ultra-\nOrthodox\" Jews might \"stone[ ] cars that drive down the\nstreets on the Sabbath.\" Id. at 153-54. The Borough\nAttorney participated in the debate. Neither he nor anyone\nelse mentioned Ordinance 691 or indicated that attaching\nlechis to utility poles might be unlawful.\n\nThe Council decided to demand a formal, written\nproposal before voting on whether to issue the\nproclamation. Mayor Moscovitz advised Gotlieb and Osen,\nwho did not attend the meeting, that the Council was\nunlikely to grant their request for a proclamation, but\ninvited them to submit a formal application. Frustrated by\nthe Borough’s reticence, in August 1999 TEAI asked Bergen\nCounty Executive William P. Schuber, whose jurisdiction\nincludes Tenafly, to issue the ceremonial proclamation\nnecessary to validate the eruv. On December 15, 1999, he\ndid so. The constitutionality of this action is not challenged\nin this case, and neither Schuber nor any other Bergen\nCounty official is a party.\n\nVerizon, the local telephone company, owns the utility\npoles in Tenafly, though the poles are located on the\n\fBorough’s property.7 In April 2000, the plaintiffs asked\nVerizon for permission to attach lechis to its utility poles.\nThe plaintiffs said in a sworn statement, which the District\nCourt found \"credible,\" that they did not believe any\nmunicipal ordinance prohibited them from doing so, and\nthus that they did not need the Council’s permission. Id. at\n155. After the plaintiffs informed Verizon about the\nproclamation, they say, the company’s in-house counsel\nresearched whether municipal approval was required and\nadvised the plaintiffs that it was not.\n\nIn June 2000 Cablevision, holder of the local cable\ntelevision franchise, volunteered to help the plaintiffs affix\nlechis to Verizon’s utility poles as a community service.\nWith the help of Cablevision personnel and equipment, an\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. When some of the events pertinent to this case occurred, the company\nnow known as Verizon was named Bell Atlantic Telephone Company.\n155 F. Supp. 2d at 154-55. For convenience we refer to it as Verizon\nthroughout.\n\n                                7\n\n\neruv was completed in Tenafly sometime in September 2000.8\nThe plaintiffs represent, and the Borough does not disagree,\nthat only private funds have supported the eruv and that\nno municipal assistance of any kind will be needed to\nmaintain it.\n\nBorough officials apparently did not learn that an eruv\nwas being erected in Tenafly until late August 2000. Mayor\nMoscovitz and Councilman Charles Lipson met with two\nlocal Jewish leaders on September 14, 2000, to discuss the\nmatter. One of the Jewish leaders perceived some of the\nMayor’s remarks as derogatory toward Orthodox Jews, and\nthe meeting was unproductive. Twelve days later, Borough\nAdministrator Joseph DiGiacomo, acting at the Mayor’s\nbehest, asked Cablevision why it helped attach the lechis\nwithout the Borough’s permission. According to DiGiacomo,\nthe company told him that \"a Rabbi\" had advised it that\nTEAI had the necessary government approval. Id. at 158.\nOn October 10, 2000, Mayor Moscovitz and the Council\ndirected the Borough Administrator to ask Cablevision to\nremove the lechis from the utility poles\"as soon as\npossible.\" Id.\n\nOn October 23, 2000, Cablevision wrote to the plaintiffs\nand informed them that the Borough instructed it to take\ndown the lechis. Cablevision said it would begin complying\nwith the Borough’s order within three days unless the\nplaintiffs demonstrated they had municipal approval.\nCounsel for the plaintiffs subsequently negotiated from the\nBorough a thirty-day reprieve to give TEAI an opportunity\nto apply for permission from the Council to maintain the\neruv. The letter setting out this agreement, sent by the\nplaintiffs’ counsel to Borough Attorney Walter Lesnevich,\nstates in part: \"I also appreciate your advice that the\nBorough has no specific ordinance covering this matter or\n\fany particular format for the Eruv Association to follow in\nsubmitting its request.\" Id. at 159. By the beginning of\nNovember 2000, neither Lesnevich nor any other Borough\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. According to the District Court, a map of Tenafly, which does not\nappear in the appellate record, \"suggests\" that the eruv enables the\nplaintiffs to push and carry objects in 35-40% of the Borough. 155 F.\nSupp. 2d at 149.\n\n                                8\n\n\nofficial had raised the possibility that Ordinance 691 or\nanother ordinance might be relevant to the dispute over the\nlechis.\n\nOn November 7, 2000, the plaintiffs filed their application\nwith the Borough, asking the Council not to remove or\norder the removal of the lechis. On November 21, 2000, the\nCouncil decided to hold two hearings to allow members of\nthe public to comment on the plaintiffs’ proposal. The\nCouncil scheduled the first hearing for November 28, 2000,\nand the second for December 12, 2000. Fifty-four members\nof the public, including plaintiff Chaim Book and other eruv\nproponents, spoke at the two hearings. The speakers were\nevenly divided between supporters and opponents of the\neruv. During the hearings, Council members did not\nexpress their views until the conclusion of the December 12\nhearing. At that hearing, just before the Council voted on\nthe plaintiffs’ application, one Councilman stated that \"[t]o\nthe best of my knowledge,\" the Borough had \"no ordinance,\nno resolution that says that you cannot hang something\nfrom a utility pole.\" Mayor Moscovitz responded by saying\n\"[t]here is an ordinance,\" and Lesnevich then described\nOrdinance 691. This exchange was apparently the first time\nthat Borough officials mentioned Ordinance 691 with\nregard to the lechis.\n\nShortly after Lesnevich brought Ordinance 691 to the\nCouncil members’ attention, the Council voted 5-0 to force\nthe plaintiffs to remove the lechis.9 The next day, the\nBorough ordered Cablevision to take the lechis off the utility\npoles \"as soon as possible.\" 155 F. Supp. 2d at 163. The\nplaintiffs responded by suing in the District Court on\nDecember 15, 2000, alleging violations of the First and\nFourteenth Amendments, 42 U.S.C. SS 1983 and 1985, and\nthe Fair Housing Act (\"FHA\"), 42 U.S.C. S 3604(a), and\nseeking an injunction barring the Borough from interfering\nwith the eruv.10\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9. One Council member was not present and thus did not vote.\n\n10. The plaintiffs did not allege an Equal Protection Clause violation. In\naddition, though not relevant to this appeal, the plaintiffs sought\ncompensatory damages and attorneys’ fees.\n\n                                9\n\fPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b), the\nDistrict Court issued a temporary restraining order\nprecluding the Borough from disturbing the eruv . Consent\norders extended the duration of the restraint until the\nCourt ruled on the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary\ninjunction. After the parties completed limited discovery,\nthe Court held an evidentiary hearing that spanned four\ndays, received additional affidavits, and heard oral\narguments. On August 10, 2001, the Court issued an\nopinion denying the plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief\non the ground that they are not reasonably likely to\nsucceed on the merits of any of their claims.\n\nThe District Court’s discussion began with the plaintiffs’\nclaim that the Borough violated the First Amendment’s Free\nSpeech Clause. The Court concluded (albeit without citing\nour decision in Troster v. Pennsylvania State Department of\nCorrections, 65 F.3d 1086 (3d Cir. 1995)) that the act of\naffixing lechis to utility poles is \"symbolic speech.\" 155 F.\nSupp. 2d at 173. Next the Court determined that the\nBorough’s utility poles are a nonpublic forum, and that the\nBorough did not discriminate against the plaintiffs’ religious\nviewpoint when it ordered the lechis removed. Id. at 174-80.\nThe Court acknowledged that the Borough had expressly or\ntacitly permitted various facial violations of Ordinance 691,11\nsuch as the holiday displays and church directional signs.\nBut it distinguished the lechis, reasoning that the other\nmaterials affixed to the utility poles served commercial or\nfunctional purposes, were not religious in nature, and were\nnot intended to be attached permanently. Id. at 176-78.\nOther items frequently affixed to utility poles in violation of\nOrdinance 691, such as the lost animal signs and\npermanently attached house numbers, did not show\ndiscriminatory enforcement because the Borough said it\nmade efforts to remove some of them after the plaintiffs\nsued. Id. at 177-78. As for the orange ribbons, the Court\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11. The Borough submitted a copy of a separate ordinance that prohibits\nposting signs on utility poles. The Borough has not suggested, either to\nthe District Court or to our Court, that its decision to remove the lechis\nwas based on that ordinance. Instead, it has maintained throughout this\nlitigation that its decision was based only on Ordinance 691. See, e.g.,\n155 F. Supp. 2d at 159-60.\n\n                                10\n\n\nstated that, notwithstanding Mayor Moscovitz’s testimony\nand other evidence in the record, it \"lack[ed] sufficient\ninformation\" to find that the Borough knew about and\ntacitly approved them. Id. at 177. The Court concluded that\nthe Borough’s application of the ordinance did not\ndiscriminate against the plaintiffs’ religious viewpoint, and\nthus their free speech claim could not succeed. Id. at 180.\n\nThe District Court also rejected the plaintiffs’ claim that\nthe Borough violated the First Amendment’s Free Exercise\nClause. Id. at 180-86. The Court disagreed with the\n\fplaintiffs’ position that the objective effect of the Borough’s\ndecision was to discriminate against religiously motivated\nactivity. It noted that, under Lyng v. Northwest Indian\nCemetery Protective Ass’n, 485 U.S. 439 (1988), the\nBorough can deny access to utility poles on its land for a\nreligion-neutral reason even if doing so imposes an\n\"incidental\" burden on Orthodox Jews’ ability to practice\ntheir religion. 155 F. Supp. 2d at 180-81. The Court\nreasoned that because the Borough ordered the lechis\ntaken down pursuant to Ordinance 691, \"a pre-existing,\nneutral law of general applicability,\" the issue was\ncontrolled by the Supreme Court’s ruling in Employment\nDivision v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), rather than by its\nsubsequent decision in Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye,\nInc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520 (1993). 155 F. Supp.\n2d at 181. The Court did not consider whether its earlier\nconclusion that Borough officials chose not to enforce\nOrdinance 691 with respect to some secularly motivated\ncommercial and functional postings, see id. at 177-80,\naffected the free exercise analysis. Under Smith , the District\nCourt reasoned, the Borough Council’s decision to enforce\nOrdinance 691 against the eruv had an objectively neutral\neffect that did not implicate the Free Exercise Clause. Id.\n\nThe Court thought, however, that the Council members’\nimproper subjective motivations nonetheless necessitated\nstrict scrutiny under Lukumi. Id. at 183. It found that,\nwhile the Council members had no religious animosity, they\nacted because of the \"constitutionally impermissible\" fear\nthat the eruv would facilitate the formation of an insular\nOrthodox Jewish \"community within a community\" in\nTenafly. Id. at 182-83. Nevertheless, no Free Exercise\n\n                                11\n\n\nClause violation occurred because the Council members’\ndecision was \"narrowly tailored to further their interest in\navoiding the appearance of an Establishment Clause\nconcern.\" Id. at 184 n.26 (emphasis added).\n\nFinally, the Court held that the plaintiffs lack standing to\nsue under the FHA because the Borough did not \"make\nunavailable or deny\" housing within the meaning of the\nrelevant provision, 42 U.S.C. S 3604(a). Id. at 186-90. Every\ncase finding a violation of S 3604(a), the District Court\nnoted, involved conduct that \"directly affected the\navailability of housing,\" whereas the plaintiffs seek a \"non-\nhousing use of municipal property.\" Id. at 187.\n\nThe Court concluded that, because the plaintiffs were not\nreasonably likely to succeed on any of their claims,\ninjunctive relief was not appropriate. The plaintiffs timely\nappealed, giving us jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\nS 1292(a)(1),12 and we granted their request for an\ninjunction prohibiting removal of the lechis pending our\ndecision. Tenafly Eruv Ass’n, Inc. v. Borough of Tenafly, No.\n01-3301 (3d Cir. Sept. 19, 2001) (order).\n\nII. Standard of Review\n\fWe review the District Court’s ultimate decision to deny\na preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion. See Dam\nThings from Denmark, a/k/a Troll Co. ApS, v. Russ Berrie &\nCo., 290 F.3d 548, 556 (3d Cir. 2002); St. Thomas-St. John\nHotel & Tourism Ass’n, Inc. v. Virgin Islands, 218 F.3d 232,\n235 (3d Cir. 2000). But \"‘any determination that is a\nprerequisite to the issuance of an injunction . . . is reviewed\naccording to the standard applicable to that particular\ndetermination.\"’ Southco, Inc. v. Kanebridge Corp., 258 F.3d\n148, 150-51 (3d Cir. 2001) (quoting Am. Tel. & Tel. Co. v.\nWinback and Conserve Program, Inc., 42 F.3d 1421, 1427\n(3d Cir. 1994)). Thus \"we exercise plenary review over the\nDistrict Court’s conclusions of law and its application of the\nlaw to the facts.\"’ Id. at 151 (quoting Duraco Prods., Inc. v.\nJoy Plastic Enters., Ltd., 40 F.3d 1431, 1438 (3d Cir.\n1994)).\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n12. The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. SS 1331 and\n1343.\n\n                                12\n\n\nOrdinarily we will not disturb the factual findings\nsupporting the disposition of a preliminary injunction\nmotion in the absence of clear error. See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n52(a); Novartis Consumer Health, Inc. v. Johnson & Johnson-\nMerck Consumer Pharm. Co., 290 F.3d 578, 586 (3d Cir.\n2002); S. Camden Citizens in Action v. N.J. Dep’t of Envtl.\nProtection, 274 F.3d 771, 777 (3d Cir. 2001). This case,\nhowever, involves First Amendment claims, and \"the\nreaches of the First Amendment are ultimately defined by\nthe facts it is held to embrace.\" Hurley v. Irish-American\nGay, Lesbian & Bisexual Group of Boston, 515 U.S. 557,\n567 (1995). Therefore, we have \"a constitutional duty to\nconduct an independent examination of the record as a\nwhole,\" and we cannot defer to the District Court’s factual\nfindings unless they concern witnesses’ credibility. Id.; Bose\nCorp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U.S.\n485, 499, 510-11 (1984); Christ’s Bride Ministries, Inc. v.\nSoutheastern Pa. Transp. Auth., 148 F.3d 242, 247 (3d Cir.\n1998). Accordingly, we examine independently the facts in\nthe record and \"draw our own inferences\" from them.\nChrist’s Bride, 148 F.3d at 247.\n\nIII. Discussion\n\nFour factors governed the District Court’s decision\nwhether to issue a preliminary injunction barring the\nBorough from removing the eruv. To obtain an injunction,\nthe plaintiffs had to demonstrate (1) that they are\nreasonably likely to prevail eventually in the litigation and\n(2) that they are likely to suffer irreparable injury without\nrelief. See S. Camden Citizens, 274 F.3d at 777; Adams v.\nFreedom Forge Corp., 204 F.3d 475, 484 (3d Cir. 2000). If\nthese two threshold showings are made the District Court\nthen considers, to the extent relevant, (3) whether an\ninjunction would harm the Borough more than denying\n\frelief would harm the plaintiffs and (4) whether granting\nrelief would serve the public interest. See S. Camden\nCitizens, 274 F.3d at 777; Freedom Forge, 204 F.3d at 484.\nBecause the District Court ended its analysis after\nconcluding that the plaintiffs did not show that their claims\nare reasonably likely to succeed, see 155 F. Supp. 2d at\n171, 191, our discussion focuses on that factor. Disposing\n\n                                13\n\n\nof the plaintiffs’ FHA claim in the margin,13 we will first\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13. We can dispense quickly with the plaintiffs’ contention that they have\na valid FHA claim. One necessary element of a cause of action under the\nFHA is that the plaintiffs must be \"aggrieved person[s],\" 42 U.S.C.\nS 3613(a)(1)(A), which in this context means victims of \"a discriminatory\nhousing practice,\" id. S 3602, that\"make[s] unavailable or den[ies]\"\nhousing to them based on their religion. Id.S 3604(a). Some of the\nplaintiffs lived in the Borough before the eruv was established. 155 F.\nSupp. 2d at 188. Therefore, while the plaintiffs claim that the Borough\nwants to remove the eruv to discourage Orthodox Jews from moving into\ntown, they do not claim that removing the eruv would make housing\nwithin the Borough \"unavailable\" to them. Instead, they argue that\nremoving the eruv would make their living in the Borough much less\ndesirable. But they concede that the Borough’s decision did not directly\naffect anyone’s current or future home. To our knowledge, no court has\nstretched the \"make unavailable or deny\" language of S 3604(a) to\nencompass actions that both (1) do not actually make it more difficult (as\nopposed to less desirable) to obtain housing and (2) do not directly\nregulate or zone housing or activities within the home. See, e.g., LeBlanc-\nSternberg v. Fletcher, 67 F.3d 412, 424 (2d Cir. 1995) (stating that the\npertinent language \"has been interpreted to reach a wide variety of\ndiscriminatory housing practices, including discriminatory zoning\nrestrictions\"); South-Suburban Hous. Ctr. v. Greater S. Suburban Bd. of\nRealtors, 935 F.2d 868, 882 (7th Cir. 1991) (stating that the relevant\nlanguage of S 3604(a) applies to \"actions by individuals or governmental\nunits which directly affect the availability of housing\") (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). We believe that expanding S 3604(a) as the plaintiffs\nsuggest is unwarranted, as it would \"create an FHA claim in every\ncircumstance where a religious group is denied a request to use\nmunicipal property to make an area more appealing for the private\npractice of their religion,\" even if the municipal action has nothing to do\nwith housing. 155 F. Supp. 2d at 189.\n\nWe note, however, that we do not agree with the Borough’s contention\n--and the District Court’s acquiescence, if its use of the word \"standing\"\nwas meant to signify a perceived lack of subject-matter jurisdiction over\nthe plaintiffs’ FHA claim--that the issue is jurisdictional. When the\npresence or absence of a cause of action depends on how statutory\nlanguage is interpreted (as the plaintiffs’ FHA claim does), the absence of\na valid statutory cause of action does not preclude jurisdiction unless\nthe claim is frivolous or a transparent attempt to manufacture federal-\ncourt jurisdiction where none existed. See Verizon Md., Inc. v. Pub. Serv.\nComm’n of Md., 122 S. Ct. 1753, 1758-59 (2002); Steel Co. v. Citizens for\na Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 89 (1998); Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 682-\n85 (1946). Because the plaintiffs’ FHA claim is neither, we have\n\n                                14\n\fconsider the plaintiffs’ free speech claim and then discuss\ntheir free exercise claim.14\n\nA. The Free Speech Claim\n\nThe First Amendment’s Free Speech Clause provides that\n\"Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of\nspeech.\" U.S. Const. amend. I. \"Speech\" is not construed\nliterally, or even limited to the use of words. Constitutional\nprotection is afforded not only to speaking and writing, but\nalso to some nonverbal acts of communication, viz.,\n\"expressive conduct\" (or \"symbolic speech\"). Affixing lechis\nto utility poles does not involve the use of words, so the\nplaintiffs’ behavior is protected by the Free Speech Clause\nonly if it constitutes expressive conduct.15\n_________________________________________________________________\n\njurisdiction to consider it. See Growth Horizons, Inc. v. Delaware County,\n983 F.2d 1277, 1280-84 (3d Cir. 1993) (holding that district court’s\ndetermination that defendant did not \"make unavailable or deny\"\nhousing under S 3604(f) was \"a judgment on the merits rather than a\njurisdictional decision\" because the plaintiff’s claim, though ultimately\nunsuccessful, was not frivolous).\n\n14. Citing Elber v. City of Newark, 256 A.2d 44 (N.J. 1969), the plaintiffs\nattempt to raise a claim under New Jersey law. Presumably because the\nplaintiffs did not include this claim in their complaint, the District Court\ndid not discuss it. We shall do likewise.\n\n15. The Borough failed to contend in its brief that the act of affixing\nlechis to utility poles is not \"speech\" within the meaning of the First\nAmendment. Ordinarily we avoid addressing issues not raised in a\nparty’s opening brief. See, e.g., Kirschbaum v. WRGSB Associates, 243\nF.3d 145, 151 n.1 (3d Cir. 2001). However, \"[w]hen an issue or claim is\nproperly before the court, the court is not limited to the particular legal\ntheories advanced by the parties, but rather retains the independent\npower to identify and apply the proper construction of governing law.\"\nKamen v. Kemper Fin. Servs., Inc., 500 U.S. 90, 99 (1991). Thus we \"may\nconsider an issue ‘antecedent to . . . and ultimately dispositive of ’ the\ndispute before [us], even an issue the parties fail to identify and brief.\"\nUnited Nat’l Bank v. Indep. Ins. Agents, 508 U.S. 439, 447 (1993)\n(quoting Arcadia v. Ohio Power Co., 498 U.S. 73, 77 (1990)) (omission in\noriginal). Whether the Free Speech Clause applies is a threshold question\nnecessary to a proper analysis of the parties’ arguments. Therefore, we\nrequested that the parties provide supplemental memoranda on the\nissue, at which time the Borough initiated its argument that no\nprotected expression is involved here.\n\n                                15\n\n\nConduct is protected by the First Amendment when\"the\nnature of [the] activity, combined with the factual context\nand environment in which it was undertaken,\" shows that\nthe \"activity was sufficiently imbued with elements of\ncommunication to fall within the [First Amendment’s]\nscope.\" Spence v. Washington, 418 U.S. 405, 409-10 (1974);\nTroster v. Pa. State Dep’t of Corrections, 65 F.3d 1086, 1090\n\f(3d Cir. 1995). Context is crucial to evaluating an\nexpressive conduct claim because \"the context may give\nmeaning to the symbol\" or act in question. Spence, 418\nU.S. at 410.\n\nUntil 1995, the Supreme Court determined whether\nspeech is \"sufficiently imbued with elements of\ncommunication\" by asking \"whether ‘[a]n intent to convey a\nparticularized message was present, and [whether] in the\nsurrounding circumstances the likelihood was great that\nthe message would be understood by those who viewed it.\"’\nTexas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 404 (1989) (quoting\nSpence, 418 U.S. at 410-11). Applying this two-prong test\n(the \"Spence-Johnson test\"), the Supreme Court held that\nthe First Amendment shelters certain forms of nonverbal\ncommunication. For instance, Johnson held that burning\nan American flag as part of a demonstration against the\nReagan Administration’s policies that coincided with the\n1984 Republican Party convention was \"speech\" because its\n\"expressive, overtly political nature\" was\"both intentional\nand overwhelmingly apparent\" to the protestors’ audience.\n491 U.S. at 399, 406. Similarly, Spence held that attaching\na peace symbol to an American flag and displaying the\n\"peace flag\" upside down was protected expression. The\nactor \"testified that he put a peace symbol on the flag and\ndisplayed it to public view as a protest against the invasion\nof Cambodia and the killings at Kent State University,\nevents which occurred a few days prior to his arrest,\" and\n\"it would have been difficult for the great majority of\ncitizens to miss the drift of appellant’s point at the time\nthat he made it.\" 418 U.S. at 408, 410. Additional types of\nnonverbal communication have also been deemed\nconstitutionally protected. See, e.g., Schacht v. United\nStates, 398 U.S. 58, 62-63 (1970) (wearing United States\nmilitary uniforms as part of theatrical presentation\nopposing Vietnam War); Tinker v. Des Moines Indep.\n\n                                16\n\n\nCommunity Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 505-06 (1969)\n(wearing black armband at school to protest Vietnam War);\nW. Va. Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 632 (1943)\n(saluting the American flag to show allegiance to the United\nStates); Stromberg v. California, 283 U.S. 359, 369 (1931)\n(displaying red flag to express opposition to organized\ngovernment). In other cases, the Court assumed, without\ndeciding, that the nonverbal political demonstrations at\nissue implicated the First Amendment. Clark v. Community\nfor Creative Non-Violence, 468 U.S. 288, 293 (1984)\n(sleeping in a public park in front of the White House and\non the Washington Mall, in the middle of winter, to protest\nhomelessness); United States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 376\n(1968) (burning Selective Service registration certificate on\ncourthouse steps to protest war).16\n\nThe Supreme Court’s unanimous 1995 opinion, Hurley v.\nIrish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston,\n515 U.S. 557 (1995), modified somewhat the test for\ndetermining when conduct constitutes \"speech.\" In Hurley,\n\fa group of gays, lesbians, and bisexuals of Irish ancestry\nsued under a state public accommodations law barring\ndiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in an\nattempt to gain admission to a private St. Patrick’s Day\nparade in which an array of disparate groups participated.\nWhile the parade organizers asserted their First\nAmendment right to shape the content of their speech, the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n16. Some Justices have viewed other examples of nonverbal political\nprotest as sufficiently communicative to receive First Amendment\nprotection. See Brown v. Louisiana, 383 U.S. 131, 142 (1966) (plurality\nopinion) (finding that black citizens who silently assembled in public\nlibrary to protest segregated public facilities engaged in expressive\nconduct); Garner v. Louisiana, 368 U.S. 157, 201 (1961) (Harlan, J.,\nconcurring in the judgment) (concluding that black persons who sat at\n\"white\" lunch counters to protest segregated dining facilities were\nengaging in symbolic speech and that their disturbing-the-peace\nconvictions, which the majority reversed on insufficient evidence\ngrounds, violated the First Amendment). In addition, the Supreme Court\nrecently recognized a symbolic speech claim in a different context. See\nCity of Erie v. Pap’s A.M., 529 U.S. 277, 289 (2000) (plurality opinion)\n(stating summarily that nude erotic dancing is \"expressive conduct,\"\nthough \"it falls only within the outer ambit of the First Amendment’s\nprotection\").\n\n                                17\n\n\nplaintiffs maintained that the organizers had no First\nAmendment interest because their lack of selectivity in\naccepting participants made it impossible for spectators to\ndiscern a specific message. Rejecting the plaintiffs’\ncontention, the Supreme Court explained that \"a narrow,\nsuccinctly articulable message is not a condition of\nconstitutional protection, which if confined to expressions\nconveying a ‘particularized message,’ would never reach the\nunquestionably shielded painting of Jackson Pollak, music\nof Arnold Schoenberg, or Jabberwocky verse of Lewis\nCarroll.\"17 Id. at 569 (quoting Spence, 418 U.S. at 411).\n\nBy establishing that \"a private speaker does not forfeit\nconstitutional protection simply by combining multifarious\nvoices, or by failing to edit their themes to isolate an exact\nmessage as the exclusive subject matter of the speech,\"\nHurley eliminated the \"particularized message\" aspect of the\nSpence-Johnson test. Id. at 569-70. The Hurley Court had\nno need to formulate a new test, however, because--unlike\nconduct that is not normally communicative--parades are\ninherently expressive. Id. at 568 (\"Parades are thus a form\nof expression, not just motion, and the inherent\nexpressiveness of marching to make a point explains our\ncases involving protest marches.\"). Thus Hurley left open\nhow courts should evaluate symbolic speech claims.\n\nBefore Hurley, we treated the Spence-Johnson factors as\nprerequisites for conduct to be deemed expressive. See\nSteirer by Steirer v. Bethlehem Area Sch. Dist., 987 F.2d\n989, 995, 997 (3d Cir. 1993) (holding that participating in\ncommunity service is not expressive conduct). But after\n\fHurley, our decision in Troster v. Pennsylvania State\nDepartment of Corrections, 65 F.3d 1086 (3d Cir. 1995),\nconcluded that Spence (and, implicitly, Johnson as well) set\nsignposts rather than requirements, and that its two factors\ncan no longer be viewed as the only criteria. See id. at 1090\n& n.1. Because Spence \"contained no language of\nnecessity,\" we adopted the following standard: conduct is\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n17. The Hurley Court proceeded to hold that applying the public\naccommodations law to force the parade organizers to include the\nplaintiffs violated the organizers’ First Amendment right to select the\ncomponents of their message. Id. at 579.\n\n                                18\n\n\nexpressive if, \"considering ‘the nature of[the] activity,\ncombined with the factual context and environment in\nwhich it was undertaken,’ we are led to the conclusion that\nthe ‘activity was sufficiently imbued with elements of\ncommunication to fall within the scope of the First and\nFourteenth Amendments.\"’18Id. at 1090 (quoting Spence,\n418 U.S. at 409-10) (alteration in original). We emphasized\nthat this \"is a fact-sensitive, context-dependent inquiry,\"\nand that the putative speaker bears the burden of proving\nthat his or her conduct is expressive. Id.\n\nWe then applied this formulation to reject a state\ncorrections officer’s claim that a regulation mandating that\neach corrections officer wear an American flag patch on his\nuniform’s right shirt-sleeve, with the star field facing his\nrear, violated the First Amendment by compelling him to\nengage in expressive conduct. Id. at 1088. The officer\nbelieved that compulsory display debases the flag and that\n\"displaying the flag with its star field to the rear signifies\ncowardice and retreat from the principles for which the flag\nstands.\" Id. Though we recognized the strength of the\nofficer’s convictions, we determined that he did not show\nthat the act of wearing a flag patch was sufficiently\ncommunicative to receive First Amendment protection, as\nhe did not present \"evidence to support his otherwise bare\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n18. Outside our Circuit, courts continue to view the Spence-Johnson test\nas the governing standard for determining whether conduct constitutes\nprotected expression. See, e.g., Gun Owners’ Action League, Inc. v. Swift,\n284 F.3d 198, 211 (1st Cir. 2002); Littlefield v. Forney Indep. Sch. Dist.,\n268 F.3d 275, 283 (5th Cir. 2001); Hutchins v. District of Columbia, 188\nF.3d 531, 548 (D.C. Cir. 1999); Colacurcio v. City of Kent, 163 F.3d 545,\n549 n.1 (9th Cir. 1998); Stephenson v. Davenport Cmty. Sch. Dist., 110\nF.3d 1303, 1307 n.4 (8th Cir. 1997); United States v. Lewis, 2002 WL\n31055185, *8 (S.D. W. Va. Sept. 11, 2002); Daly v. Harris, 215 F. Supp.\n2d 1098, 1108 (D. Haw. 2002); Isaacs ex rel.

Supp. 192, 195 (S.D.N.Y. 1995); Gallo v. County of Sonoma, 120 Cal.\nRptr. 2d 550, 569 (Cal. Ct. App. 2002), State v. Machholz, 574 N.W.2d\n415, 419-20 (Minn. 1998); Binkowski v. State, 731 A.2d 64, 70 (N.J.\nSuper. Ct. App. Div. 1999); State v. Janssen, 580 N.W.2d 260, 266 n.11\n\f(Wis. 1998); State v. Berrill, 474 S.E.2d 508, 516 (W. Va. 1996).\n\n                                19\n\n\nassertion that the flag patch regulation compels expressive\nconduct.\" Id. at 1091 n.4.\n\nOur discussion in Troster focused on two inquiries. First,\nwe examined whether the officer intended subjectively (i.e.,\nactually intended) for his conduct to communicate to\npersons whom he expected to observe it (i.e., his intended\naudience). We determined that there was no proof that his\nconduct was \"demonstrative of an attitude or belief\" or that\nhe \"actually assert[ed] anything to anyone.\" Id. at 1091-92.\nSecond, we considered whether observers understood the\nmessage the officer intended his conduct to convey. The\nrecord contained no evidence that \"observers would likely\nunderstand the patch or the wearer to be telling them\nanything about the wearers’ beliefs\" or \"that the flag patch\non the correctional officers’ uniform will relay any message\n(ideological or otherwise) to anyone.\" Id. at 1091-92\n(emphases in original). Therefore, the officer’s compelled\nspeech claim failed because he did not show that the\nconduct in which he was forced to engage was expressive.\n\nOur emphasis in Troster on the putative speaker’s burden\nof proving that his conduct is \"sufficiently imbued with\nelements of communication\" is important to our resolution\nof the plaintiffs’ expressive conduct claim in this case. If the\nputative speaker’s burden were \"limited to ‘the\nadvancement of a plausible contention’ that [his or her]\nconduct is expressive\"--a view espoused by a plurality of\nthe D.C. Circuit but rejected by the Supreme Court in Clark\n--the result \"would be to create a rule that all conduct is\npresumptively expressive.\" Clark, 468 U.S. at 293 n.5. Such\na rule would be inconsistent with the Supreme Court’s\nrepeated admonition that \"[w]e cannot accept the view that\nan apparently limitless variety of conduct can be labeled\n‘speech.\"’ O’Brien, 391 U.S. at 376; see also Johnson, 491\nU.S. at 404; Spence, 418 U.S. at 409. Therefore, as we\nstressed in Troster, 65 F.3d at 1091-92, and as the\nSupreme Court held in Clark, \"it is the obligation of the\nperson desiring to engage in assertedly expressive conduct\nto demonstrate that the First Amendment even applies.\"\nClark, 468 U.S. at 293 n.5.\n\nWith this background as context, we conclude that the\nplaintiffs have not met their burden of showing that affixing\n\n                                20\n\n\nlechis to utility poles is \"sufficiently imbued with elements\nof communication\" to be deemed expressive conduct. The\nrecord indicates that the lechis were attached for the benefit\nof other Orthodox Jews, not the general public. Therefore,\nif the plaintiffs’ conduct is expressive, their intended\naudience is other Orthodox Jews. But the plaintiffs have\nnot introduced evidence that the lechis are meant to\n\fdemonstrate a belief or assert anything to Orthodox Jews or\nthat Orthodox Jews \"likely understand\" the eruv \"to be\ntelling them anything,\" i.e., that they discern \"any message\n(ideological or otherwise)\" from the lechis .19 Troster, 65 F.3d\nat 1091 (emphases in original). Instead, on the record\nbefore us, it appears that the eruv serves a purely\nfunctional, non-communicative purpose indistinguishable,\nfor free speech purposes, from that of a fence surrounding\na yard or a wall surrounding a building.\n\nRather than \"actually assert[ing] anything to anyone,\" id.\nat 1092, it seems that the eruv simply demarcates the\nspace within which certain activities otherwise forbidden on\nthe Sabbath are allowed. Plaintiff Chaim Book described\nthe eruv as a \"boundary\" that \"requires physical\ndemarcation,\" a function historically achieved by\"rop[ing]\nan area off.\" Similarly, at oral argument counsel for the\nplaintiffs told us that the lechis \"replace[ ] the pole[s] that\nwould be used prior to the time there were telephone poles\"\nto designate the eruv’s boundaries. While the plaintiffs\ndescribe the eruv in functional terms, explaining that it\nestablishes an area within which Orthodox Jews may\nengage in certain otherwise impermissible activities, they\noffer no evidence that it communicates anything. The only\nevidence the plaintiffs introduced with respect to the\nreligious significance of the eruv was the affidavit of Rabbi\nHershel Schachter of Yeshiva University, an expert on\nOrthodox Jewish law. Rabbi Schachter explained that the\neruv enables couples with young children and persons who\nuse wheelchairs to attend synagogue on the Sabbath. He\ndid not, however, suggest that the Orthodox Jews who affix\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n19. As we stated above, see supra note 15, it appears that until we\nrequested briefing on the issue the parties merely assumed that the\nlechis are protected by the First Amendment.\n\n                                21\n\n\nlechis intend to send any message thereby, or that the eruv\nconveys any message to Orthodox Jews.\n\nFurther, there is no evidence that Orthodox Jews receive\na message or ascertain the eruv’s boundaries by looking at\nthe lechis. To the contrary, Rabbi Howard Jachter, speaking\non behalf of the TEAI, said that \"most Orthodox Jews do\nnot . . . would not know how to make an eruv, wouldn’t see\nwhere the eruv is, how it is. A rabbi wouldn’t know how it\nis.\" Even plaintiff Chaim Book, who is obviously familiar\nwith the eruv’s boundaries and the lechis’ locations, said, \"I,\nwho know some of the poles have lechis, have a hard time\nrecognizing the lechi on the pole by just looking at it.\" In\naddition, plaintiffs’ complaint states that \"the eruv is not a\nreligious symbol.\" Thus there is no evidence contradicting\nthe Borough’s assertion at oral argument--which the\nplaintiffs did not dispute--that Orthodox Jews learn the\neruv’s boundaries by word of mouth from the persons\ncharged with erecting and inspecting it.\n\fEven if the plaintiffs had introduced evidence that the\nlechis serve a boundary function, that would be insufficient\nto prove they are \"sufficiently imbued with elements of\ncommunication to fall within the scope of the First and\nFourteenth Amendments.\" Troster, 65 F.3d at 1090\n(internal quotation marks omitted). All boundary lines\ndelineate the realms within which certain activities are or\nare not allowed. For instance, the invisible boundary\nbetween Nevada and Utah separates an area where\ngambling is legal from one where it is not. A homeowner’s\nfence demarcates where his neighbor’s garden must stop.\nThe walls of a synagogue delineate the space where\ncongregational worship takes place. But geographical\nboundary lines, fences, and walls are simply not protected\nexpression in the absence of evidence that some\"attitude\nor belief,\" Troster, 65 F.3d at 1091, is conveyed or received\nfrom them. Cf. Dallas v. Stanglin, 490 U.S. 19, 25 (1989)\n(\"It is possible to find some kernel of expression in almost\nevery activity a person undertakes--for example, walking\ndown the street or meeting one’s friends at a shopping mall\n--but such a kernel is not sufficient to bring the activity\nwithin the protection of the First Amendment.\"); Pro v.\nDonatucci, 81 F.3d 1283, 1293 (3d Cir. 1996) (Roth, J.,\n\n                                22\n\n\ndissenting) (noting that \"expression and communication are\nthe crucial attributes of speech,\" that \"[n]owhere is this\nstress on expression and communication more clear than\nin the Court’s approach to speech that falls outside the\ntraditional domain of the spoken or written word,\" and that\n\"[t]he classic examples of conduct-as-speech all contain\npatently expressive messages.\"). Otherwise, the act of\nconstructing houses of worship would implicate the Free\nSpeech Clause, whereas courts consistently analyze the\nconstitutionality of zoning regulations limiting such\nconstruction under the Free Exercise Clause, not the Free\nSpeech Clause. See, e.g., City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S.\n507, 534 (1997); Messiah Baptist Church v. County of\nJefferson, 859 F.2d 820, 823-26 (10th Cir. 1988);\nLakewood, Ohio Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Inc.\nv. City of Lakewood, 699 F.2d 303, 307-08 (6th Cir. 1983);\nChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. Jefferson\nCounty, 741 F. Supp. 1522, 1527-34 (N.D. Ala. 1990); cf.\nCongregation Kol Ami v. Abington Township, 2002 WL\n31312280 (3d Cir. Oct. 16, 2002). Moreover, if solely the\nact of erecting a wall separating the interior of a building\nfrom the secular world constituted \"speech,\" every religious\ngroup that wanted to challenge a zoning regulation\npreventing them from constructing a house of worship\ncould raise a \"hybrid\" rights claim triggering strict scrutiny,\nsee Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 881-82\n(1990),20 a notion so astonishing that we are unaware of\nany court--or even any law review article--that has\nsuggested it.\n\nPlaintiffs maintain that, although the eruv is functional,\nit is also expressive, just as the 18-foot Chanukah menorah\n_________________________________________________________________\n\f20. As explained in more detail below, Smith held that the Free Exercise\nClause offers no protection when a neutral, generally applicable law\nincidentally burdens religious practice, with a possible exception for\n\"hybrid\" rights situations in which both the right to free exercise of\nreligion and another constitutional right are implicated. 494 U.S. at 879,\n881-82. If the law imposing the burden on religious freedom is either not\nneutral or not generally applicable, however, it violates the First\nAmendment unless it satisfies strict scrutiny (i.e., unless it is narrowly\ntailored to advance a compelling government interest). See Church of the\nLukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 546 (1993).\n\n                                23\n\n\nin Allegheny County v. Greater Pittsburgh ACLU , 492 U.S.\n573 (1989), was expressive even though the functional\npurpose of menorahs is to hold candles. To the extent that\nthe plaintiffs’ point is that functionality and expression are\n\"not mutually exclusive,\" we do not disagree; things\nordinarily used for functional purposes can be used for\ncommunicative purposes as well. Name.Space, Inc. v.\nNetwork Solutions, Inc., 202 F.3d 573, 586 (2d Cir. 2000)\n(concluding that Internet domain names are ordinarily\nfunctional, but can be expressive if they contain a message,\ne.g., \".jones_for_president\"). But there is no evidence that\nthe eruv is an example of such overlapping purposes,\nwhereas there was ample evidence to that effect in\nAllegheny. As part of a holiday display that stood at the\nentrance to a government building and included a 45-foot\nChristmas tree, the 18-foot menorah was both intended\nand understood to express \"a recognition that Christmas is\nnot the only traditional way of observing the winter-holiday\nseason\" and \"an acknowledgment of Chanukah as a\ncontemporaneous alternative tradition.\" Allegheny, 492 U.S.\nat 617-18.\n\nIn sharp contrast here, there is no evidence that\nOrthodox Jews intend or understand the eruv to\ncommunicate any idea or message. Rather, the evidence\nshows that the eruv--like a fence around a house or the\nwalls forming a synagogue--serves the purely functional\npurpose of delineating an area within which certain\nactivities are permitted.\n\nWe also reject the plaintiffs’ contention that the eruv may\nbe deemed expressive simply because some residents of\nTenafly who are not Orthodox Jews discern various\nunintended messages emanating from it, notwithstanding\nthat these persons would not be intended recipients even if\nthe lechis were meant to send a message. To accept this\nposition would mean that whether conduct is expressive\ndepends entirely on how observers perceive it--even if the\nactor had no communicative intent, and even if the actor\ndisapproves of the message (or messages) discerned by the\nobservers. See Troster, 65 F.3d at 1092 (noting the\ndifference between an observer’s independent inference\nfrom an actor’s behavior and an observer’s receipt of a\n\n                                24\n\fnonverbal message intentionally sent by the actor); Peter\nMeijes Tiersma, Nonverbal Communication and the Freedom\nof \"Speech\", 1993 Wis. L. Rev. 1525, 1553, 1561-62 (stating\nthat nonverbal conduct is expressive only if it involves \"a\nconscious transfer of information,\" i.e.,\"an attempt to\ncommunicate\" by the actor).\n\nFinally, we cannot accept the plaintiffs’ argument that, by\nanalogy to the protection afforded newsracks, the eruv is\nprotected under the First Amendment. Relying on City of\nLakewood v. Plain Dealer Publ’g Co., 486 U.S. 750 (1988),\nthe plaintiffs insist that, just as newsracks facilitate the\ndistribution of newspapers, the eruv facilitates religious\nworship.21 But City of Lakewood did not treat newsracks as\nprotected based on the sweeping rationale that they\nfacilitate speech, but rather because they are inextricably\nintertwined with speech. Id. at 768 (\"The actual ‘activity’ at\nissue here is the circulation of newspapers, which is\nconstitutionally protected.\"). Unlike a newsrack, which\nfacilitates the paradigm of communication (the sale of\nnewspapers), there is no evidence that the eruv is\ninextricably linked to a communicative activity. Instead, the\nrecord shows that the eruv exists solely to designate the\nboundaries within which Orthodox Jews can engage in\ncertain activities on the Sabbath. Therefore, City of\nLakewood does not support the plaintiffs’ position that the\nnon-communicative act of delineating an area constitutes\nprotected expression.\n\nIn sum, as in Troster, the plaintiffs offer nothing more\nthan a \"bare assertion\" that their conduct is expressive.22\n65 F.3d at 1091 n.4. Because this does not satisfy the\nplaintiffs’ burden of proof, their free speech claim fails.23\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n21. City of Lakewood, the Supreme Court sustained a facial challenge to\nan ordinance granting the mayor \"unfettered discretion\" to grant or deny\npermits to place newsracks on public property. 486 U.S. at 772.\n\n22. Our holding is limited to the record in this case and does not\nnecessarily preclude the possibility that a party in another case might\nintroduce evidence showing that attaching lechis to utility poles is\nconduct protected by the Free Speech Clause.\n\n23. Accordingly, the plaintiffs cannot assert a\"hybrid rights\" claim under\nthe Free Exercise Clause. See infra note 26.\n\n                                25\n\n\nB. The Free Exercise Claim\n\n1. Determining the appropriate level of scrutiny\n\nThe Free Exercise Clause, which binds the Borough\npursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment, see Cantwell v.\nConnecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 303 (1940), provides that\n\"Congress shall make no law . . . prohibiting the free\n\fexercise [of religion].\" U.S. Const. amend. I. Depending on\nthe nature of the challenged law or government action, a\nfree exercise claim can prompt either strict scrutiny or\nrational basis review.24\n\nIf a law is \"neutral\" and \"generally applicable,\" and\nburdens religious conduct only incidentally, the Free\nExercise Clause offers no protection. Employment Div. v.\nSmith, 494 U.S. 872, 879 (1990).25 Smith held that the Free\nExercise Clause did not require a state to exempt the\ningestion of peyote during a Native American Church\nceremony from its neutral, generally applicable prohibition\non using that drug. Id. at 882. On the other hand, if the\nlaw is not neutral (i.e., if it discriminates against religiously\nmotivated conduct) or is not generally applicable (i.e., if it\nproscribes particular conduct only or primarily when\nreligiously motivated), strict scrutiny applies and the\nburden on religious conduct violates the Free Exercise\nClause unless it is narrowly tailored to advance a\ncompelling government interest.26Church of the Lukumi\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n24. To survive strict scrutiny, a challenged government action must be\nnarrowly tailored to advance a compelling government interest, whereas\nrational basis review requires merely that the action be rationally related\nto a legitimate government objective. As explained below, an intermediate\nlevel of scrutiny may apply in the public employment context.\n\n25. Smith involved a criminal law, but its rule also applies in the context\nof non-criminal laws and regulations. See Church of the Lukumi Babalu\nAye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 531 (1993); Fraternal Order of\nPolice v. City of Newark, 170 F.3d 359, 363-64 (3d Cir. 1999).\n\n26. Strict scrutiny may also apply when a neutral, generally applicable\nlaw incidentally burdens rights protected by \"the Free Exercise Clause in\nconjunction with other constitutional protections, such as freedom of\nspeech and of the press, or the rights of parents . . . to direct the\neducation of their children,\" Smith, 494 U.S. at 881 (citations omitted),\nbut the plaintiffs do not assert such a \"hybrid rights\" claim.\n\n                                26\n\n\nBabalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 532, 542\n(1993).\n\nFurther, the Free Exercise Clause’s mandate of neutrality\ntoward religion prohibits government from \"deciding that\nsecular motivations are more important than religious\nmotivations.\" Fraternal Order of Police v. City of Newark,\n170 F.3d 359, 365 (3d Cir. 1999). Accordingly, in situations\nwhere government officials exercise discretion in applying a\nfacially neutral law, so that whether they enforce the law\ndepends on their evaluation of the reasons underlying a\nviolator’s conduct, they contravene the neutrality\nrequirement if they exempt some secularly motivated\nconduct but not comparable religiously motivated conduct.\nSee Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 537; Smith, 494 U.S. at 884;\nBowen v. Roy, 476 U.S. 693, 708 (1986) (plurality opinion);\nFraternal Order of Police, 170 F.3d at 364-65. Thus in\n\fLukumi the Supreme Court invalidated an ordinance\n\"punishing ‘[w]hoever . . . unnecessarily . . . kills any\nanimal,’ \" where state and local officials interpreted the\nordinance to ban animal sacrifices during Santeria religious\nceremonies, but to exempt secular activities such as\nhunting, slaughtering animals for food, and even using live\nrabbits to train greyhounds. 508 U.S. at 537 (alteration in\noriginal). The officials’ selective application of the ordinance\n\"devalue[d] religious reasons for killing by judging them to\nbe of lesser import than nonreligious reasons,\" causing\nreligiously motivated conduct to be \"singled out for\ndiscriminatory treatment.\" Id. at 537-38. Therefore, strict\nscrutiny applied, and the ordinance failed that test because\nits \"proffered objectives [were] not pursued with respect to\nanalogous non-religious conduct.\" Id. at 546.\n\nBecause the ordinance in Lukumi gave officials discretion\nto consider \"the particular justification\" for each violation,\nit \"represent[ed] a system of ‘individualized governmental\nassessment of the reasons for the relevant conduct,’ \"\ntriggering under Smith strict scrutiny of the ordinance’s\napplication to religiously motivated conduct. Id. at 537\n(quoting Smith, 494 U.S. at 884). In Fraternal Order of\nPolice, we held that the neutrality principle applies with\nequal force when government creates categorical, as\nopposed to individualized, exceptions for secularly\n\n                                27\n\n\nmotivated conduct. 170 F.3d at 365. A city’s police\ndepartment applied its no-beard policy, which was designed\nto promote uniform appearance, to allow medical\nexemptions but deny similar exemptions to two Sunni\nMuslim officers whose faith required them to grow beards.\nId. at 360-61, 366. Selective enforcement of this nature, we\nsaid, exemplified the Supreme Court’s concern in Smith and\nLukumi about \"the prospect of the government’s deciding\nthat secular motivations are more important than religious\nmotivations.\" Id. at 365. It showed that the police\ndepartment \"made a value judgment that secular (i.e.,\nmedical) motivations for wearing a beard are important\nenough to overcome its general interest in uniformity but\nthat religious motivations are not.\" Id. at 366. Therefore,\nthe enforcement of the policy against the Sunni Muslim\nofficers was \"sufficiently suggestive of discriminatory intent\n. . . to trigger heightened scrutiny under Smith and Lukumi.\"27\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n27. Smith and Lukumi state unambiguously that strict scrutiny applies\nwhen government discriminates against religiously motivated conduct.\nSee Smith, 494 U.S. at 884; Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 546. However, our\ndecision in Fraternal Order of Police applied only \"heightened\" or\n\"intermediate\" scrutiny, under which the challenged government action\nmust be substantially related (rather than narrowly tailored) to\npromoting an important (rather than compelling) government interest.\nWe did so because First Amendment rights are limited in the public\nemployment context by a government’s need to function efficiently. See,\ne.g., United States v. Nat’l Employees Treasury Union, 513 U.S. 454, 465\n(1995); Pickering v. Bd. of Educ., 391 U.S. 563, 568 (1968). In any event,\n\fwe determined that the police department’s discriminatory value\njudgment failed even intermediate scrutiny. Fraternal Order of Police, 170\nF.3d at 365-66 & n.7.\n\nWe note that, in contrast to our decision in Fraternal Order of Police,\ntwo other circuit courts have stated that the Free Exercise Clause offers\nno protection when a statute or policy contains broad, objectively defined\nexceptions not entailing subjective, individualized consideration. See\nSwanson v. Guthrie v. Indep. Sch. Dist. No. I-L, 135 F.3d 694, 701 (10th\nCir. 1998) (stating that school district’s excepting fifth-year seniors and\nspecial education students from \"no-part-time-attendance\" policy did not\nrequire strict scrutiny of refusal to allow Christian home-schooled\nstudent to attend part-time); Am. Friends Serv. Comm. v. Thornburgh,\n951 F.2d 957, 961 (9th Cir. 1991) (determining that exceptions in\nstatute regulating immigrant hiring for independent contractors,\nhousehold employees, and employees hired before November 1986 did\nnot trigger strict scrutiny of denial of religiously motivated exemption\nrequest because the statutory exceptions \"exclude entire, objectively-\ndefined categories of employees from the scope of the statute\").\n\n                                28\n\n\nId. at 365. The Sunni Muslim officers’ beards posed no\ngreater threat to uniform appearance than did the beards\nworn by officers with medical conditions. Id. at 366. Thus\nthe police department’s policy was void under \"any degree\nof heightened scrutiny.\" Id. at 367.\n\nSmith, Lukumi, and Fraternal Order of Police point the\nway to the appropriate level of scrutiny in this case. On its\nface, Ordinance 691 is neutral and generally applicable.\nBut \"[o]fficial action that targets religious conduct for\ndistinctive treatment cannot be shielded [from\nconstitutional attack] by mere compliance with the\nrequirement of facial neutrality.\" Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 534.\nWe must look beyond the text of the ordinance and\nexamine whether the Borough enforces it on a religion-\nneutral basis, as \"the effect of a law in its real operation is\nstrong evidence of its object.\" Id. at 535.\n\nBecause Ordinance 691 is neutral and generally\napplicable on its face, if the Borough had enforced it\nuniformly, Smith would control and the plaintiffs’ claim\nwould accordingly fail. The Borough insists it has done so,\nbut the record shows otherwise. Indeed, the Borough has\ntacitly or expressly granted exemptions from the\nordinance’s unyielding language for various secular and\nreligious--though never Orthodox Jewish--purposes. Cf.\nFowler v. Rhode Island, 345 U.S. 67, 69 (1953) (holding\nthat city violated Free Exercise Clause by enforcing\nordinance banning meetings in park against Jehovah’s\nWitnesses but exempting other religious groups).\n\nFrom the drab house numbers and lost animal signs to\nthe more obtrusive holiday displays, church directional\nsigns, and orange ribbons--the last of which the District\nCourt erroneously deemed irrelevant to the constitutional\nanalysis28--the Borough has allowed private citizens to affix\n_________________________________________________________________\n\f28. Pursuant to our \"constitutional duty to conduct an independent\nexamination of the record as a whole,\" Hurley , 515 U.S. at 567, we\nbelieve there is ample evidence in the record showing that orange\nribbons were attached to the Borough’s utility poles for \"a lengthy period\nof time\" and that Borough officials knew about them but made no effort\nto remove them. A594-95 (Mayor Moscovitz Test.); see also A277\n(statement of Tenafly resident Lee Rosenbaum that\"[s]urely, a town that\nbrandished orange ribbons tied to almost every pole in town for what I\nthink was several years can tolerate some unobtrusive markers\").\n\n                                29\n\n\nvarious materials to its utility poles. Apart from their\nreligious nature, the lechis are comparable to the postings\nthe Borough has left in place. If anything, the lechis are\nless of a problem because they are so unobtrusive; even\nobservant Jews are often unable to distinguish them from\nordinary utility wires. While the Borough alleges that the\nlechis are different because the plaintiffs intend them to be\n\"permanent,\" house numbers nailed to utility poles are\nlikewise intended to be permanent. And although the\nBorough insists that the lechis’ religious nature justifies its\ndecision to remove them, this is precisely the sort of\nreasoning that Lukumi and Fraternal Order of Police forbid.\n\nWe believe that the Borough’s selective, discretionary\napplication of Ordinance 691 against the lechis violates the\nneutrality principle of Lukumi and Fraternal Order of Police\nbecause it \"devalues\" Orthodox Jewish reasons for posting\nitems on utility poles by \"judging them to be of lesser\nimport than nonreligious reasons,\" and thus \"single[s] out\"\nthe plaintiffs’ religiously motivated conduct for\ndiscriminatory treatment. Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 537;\nFraternal Order of Police, 170 F.3d at 364-65. 29 Just as the\nexemptions for secularly motivated killings in Lukumi\nindicated that the city was discriminating against Santeria\nanimal sacrifice, and just as the medical exemption in\nFraternal Order of Police indicated that the police\ndepartment was discriminating against religiously\nmotivated requests to grow beards, the Borough’s\ninvocation of the often-dormant Ordinance 691 against\nconduct motivated by Orthodox Jewish beliefs is\n\"sufficiently suggestive of discriminatory intent,\" Fraternal\nOrder of Police, 170 F.3d at 365, that we must apply strict\nscrutiny. See Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 546.30\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n29. We note, however, that we reject the plaintiffs’ contention that the\nFree Exercise Clause bars the Borough from distinguishing between the\nlechis and the plastic-covered wires attached to utility poles by telephone\nand cable television companies. Because utility poles exist to facilitate\ntelecommunications, utility wires are obviously unlike any of the other\nmaterials the Borough has allowed people to affix to the poles.\n\n30. Whereas First Amendment rights are necessarily limited in the public\nemployment context, see Nat’l Employees Treasury Union, 513 U.S. at\n\n                                30\n\fThe Borough nonetheless contends that three aspects of\nthis case--the plaintiffs’ use of government property, the\nlack of a \"substantial burden\" on the plaintiffs’ religious\nfreedom, and the \"optional\" nature of the eruv--place it\noutside the framework of Lukumi and Fraternal Order of\nPolice, and thus preclude us from applying strict scrutiny\neven though the Borough has discriminated against\nconduct motivated by Orthodox Jewish beliefs.\n\nFirst, the Borough insists that, because the utility poles\nare on its land, this case is governed by Lyng v. Northwest\nIndian Cemetery Protective Ass’n, 485 U.S. 439 (1988),\nwhich held that the Free Exercise Clause did not prevent\nthe federal government from implementing a decision,\nbased on religion-neutral criteria, to construct a road and\nallow timber harvesting on 17,000 acres of national forest\nland traditionally used by Native Americans for religious\npractices. Id. at 447-53; see also Bowen v. Roy, 476 U.S.\n693, 699-701, 708 (1986) (holding that Free Exercise\nClause did not require government to grant religious\nexemption from generally applicable, religion-neutral\nstatutory requirement that welfare recipients furnish their\nSocial Security numbers where no individualized\nexemptions were allowed). According to the Borough, the\ncontrolling principle is that \"‘the Free Exercise Clause is\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n465, our case, unlike Fraternal Order of Police , involves purely private\nconduct. Thus Smith and Lukumi obligate us to apply strict scrutiny. See\nsupra note 27.\n\nWe note that, in determining the appropriate standard to apply, we do\nnot believe it necessary to consider the subjective motivations of the\nCouncil members who voted to remove the eruv. Lukumi and Fraternal\nOrder of Police inferred discriminatory purpose from the objective effects\nof the selective exemptions at issue without examining the responsible\nofficials’ motives. See Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 537-38; Fraternal Order of\nPolice, 170 F.3d at 364-66; see also Laurence H. Tribe, American\nConstitutional Law S 5-16, at 956 (3d ed. 2000) (\"Under Smith, a law that\nis not neutral or that is not generally applicable can violate the Free\nExercise Clause without regard to the motives of those who enacted the\nmeasure.\"). Likewise, the objective effects of the Borough’s enforcement\nof Ordinance 691 are sufficient for us to conclude that it is not being\napplied neutrally against the eruv.\n\n                                31\n\n\nwritten in terms of what the government cannot do to the\nindividual, not in terms of what the individual can exact\nfrom the government.\"’ Northwest Indian Cemetery, 485\nU.S. at 451 (1988) (quoting Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 412\n(Douglas, J., concurring)); Roy, 476 U.S. at 700.\n\nContrary to the Borough’s position, however, the\nprinciple of Lukumi and Fraternal Order of Police--that\ngovernment cannot discriminate between religiously\nmotivated conduct and comparable secularly motivated\n\fconduct in a manner that devalues religious reasons for\nacting--applies not only when a coercive law or regulation\nprohibits religious conduct, but also when government\ndenies religious adherents access to publicly available\nmoney or property. See Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398,\n404-05 (1963) (holding that Free Exercise Clause prohibits\nstate from devaluing religious reasons for seeking\nunemployment benefits); Davey v. Locke, 299 F.3d 748,\n753-54 (9th Cir. 2002) (holding that Free Exercise Clause\nbars state from making college scholarships contingent on\nrecipients not majoring in theology); cf. Rosenberger v.\nRector & Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. at 831-35\n(holding that Free Speech Clause precludes state university\nthat pays student publications’ printing costs from denying\nfunding based on publication’s religious viewpoint).\n\nIn contrast, the principle of Northwest Indian Cemetery\napplies only when a person of faith asks for special, not\nequal, treatment in the context of a religion-neutral policy.\nSee Adams v. Comm’r of Internal Revenue, 170 F.3d 173,\n181 & n.10 (3d Cir. 1999) (rejecting argument that\n\"uniform and facially neutral\" penalty for\"a conscious,\nintentional failure\" to file taxes could not be applied to\nreligious objector); Swanson v. Guthrie Indep. Sch. Dist. No.\nI-L, 135 F.3d 694, 701-02 (10th Cir. 1998) (rejecting claim\nthat school district must grant religiously motivated request\nfor individualized exemption from no-part-time-attendance\npolicy where no individualized exemptions were granted). It\ndoes not apply when government discriminates against\nreligiously motivated conduct in allocating \"the rights,\nbenefits, and privileges enjoyed by other citizens.\"\nNorthwest Indian Cemetery, 485 U.S. at 449.\n\n                                32\n\n\nIn this case, the plaintiffs are not asking for preferential\ntreatment. Instead, they ask only that the Borough not\ninvoke an ordinance from which others are effectively\nexempt to deny plaintiffs access to its utility poles simply\nbecause they want to use the poles for a religious purpose.\nCf. Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 273 n.13 (1981) (\"This\ncase is different from the cases in which religious groups\nclaim that the denial of facilities not available to other\ngroups deprives them of their rights under the Free\nExercise Clause.\") (emphasis in original); Davey, 299 F.3d\nat 757-58 (\"This is not a case where a person claims that\ndenial of a financial benefit which is not available to others\ndeprives him of his free exercise rights.\"). Therefore, Lukumi\nand Fraternal Order of Police, not Northwest Indian\nCemetary, control our disposition.\n\nSecond, the Borough maintains that strict scrutiny\nshould not apply because the plaintiffs have not shown that\nthe removal of the eruv would substantially burden their\nreligious practice. Under Smith and Lukumi, however, there\nis no substantial burden requirement when government\ndiscriminates against religious conduct. See Lukumi, 508\nU.S. at 531-47 (finding Free Exercise Clause violation\nwithout considering whether a substantial burden on\n\freligious freedom existed); Fraternal Order of Police, 170\nF.3d at 364-67 (same); Brown v. Borough of Mahaffey, 35\nF.3d 846, 849-50 (3d Cir. 1994) (\"Applying such a burden\ntest to non-neutral government actions would make petty\nharassment of religious institutions and exercise immune\nfrom the protection of the First Amendment.\"). Instead, the\nplaintiffs need to show only \"a sufficient interest in the case\nto meet the normal requirement of constitutional standing,\"\nHartmann v. Stone, 68 F.3d 973, 979 n.4 (6th Cir. 1995)\n(rejecting substantial burden requirement), and their\ninability to attend synagogue on the Sabbath without the\neruv easily suffices.\n\nMoreover, Smith admonished courts not to engage in the\nsort of inquiry the Borough demands. The Supreme Court\nexplained that \"[j]udging the centrality of different religious\npractices\" violates the principle that \"courts must not\npresume to determine the place of a particular belief in a\nreligion.\" Smith, 494 U.S. at 887; see also DeHart v. Horn,\n\n                                33\n\n\n227 F.3d 47, 56 (3d Cir. 2000) (en banc) (same). Evaluating\nthe extent of a burden on religious practice is equally\nimpermissible, the Smith Court said, because it entails a\nforbidden inquiry into religious doctrine. \"‘Constitutionally\nsignificant burden’ would seem to be ‘centrality’ under\nanother name,\" and \"inquiry into ‘severe impact’ is no\ndifferent from inquiry into centrality.\"31 Smith, 494 U.S. at\n887 n.4; see also Northwest Indian Cemetery, 485 U.S. at\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n31. Notwithstanding the Supreme Court’s admonition in Smith against\njudicial inquiries into the centrality of religious practices, a number of\ncircuit courts persist in imposing a substantial burden requirement in\nvarious contexts. See, e.g., Levitan v. Ashcroft, 281 F.3d 1313, 1320\n(D.C. Cir. 2002) (stating in prison context that free exercise plaintiff\nmust demonstrate that the challenged law burdens\"a central tenet or\nimportant practice of [his] religion\"); Am. Family Ass’n, Inc. v. City and\nCounty of San Francisco, 277 F.3d 1114, 1124 (9th Cir. 2002) (noting\nthat Ninth Circuit continues to demand that a plaintiff show substantial\nburden in challenges to government actions that are not \"regulatory,\nproscriptive or compulsory,\" though the more recent decision in Davey v.\nLocke, discussed above, did not impose this requirement); Altman v.\nMinn. Dep’t of Corrections, 251 F.3d 1199, 1204 (8th Cir. 2001)\n(\"Government significantly burdens the exercise of religion if it\nsignificantly constrains conduct or expression that manifests a central\ntenet of a person’s religious beliefs, meaningfully curtails the ability to\nexpress adherence to a particular faith, or denies reasonable\nopportunities to engage in fundamental religious activities.\"); Altman v.\nBedford Cent. Sch. Dist., 245 F.3d 49, 79 (2d Cir. 2001) (stating, contrary\nto Smith and Lukumi and without citing either opinion, that substantial\nburden test applies when neutral law incidentally impinges on religious\nexercise); Strout v. Albanese, 178 F.3d 57, 65 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting a\npre-Smith case for the proposition that\"the free exercise inquiry [is]\nwhether government has placed a substantial burden on the observation\nof a central belief or practice\") (internal quotation marks omitted)\n(emphasis in original); United States v. Grant , 117 F.3d 788, 793 (5th\nCir. 1997) (rejecting free exercise claim, without citing Smith or Lukumi,\n\fon ground that plaintiff’s religious freedom was not substantially\nburdened); Goodall by Goodall v. Stafford County Sch. Bd., 60 F.3d 168,\n173 (4th Cir. 1995) (stating that substantial burden requirement applies\nwhen challenged law is not generally applicable); Fleischfresser v. Dirs. of\nSch. Dist. 200, 15 F.3d 680, 689-90 (7th Cir. 1994) (requiring\nsubstantial burden as prerequisite for free exercise claim without citing\nSmith); Church of Scientology v. City of Clearwater, 2 F.3d 1514, 1549\n(11th Cir. 1993) (stating that strict scrutiny applies when a law that\ntargets religion imposes a substantial burden on believers).\n\n                                34\n\n\n451 (\"Whatever may be the exact line between\nunconstitutional prohibitions on the free exercise of religion\nand the legitimate conduct by government of its own affairs,\nthe location of the line cannot depend on measuring the\neffects of a governmental action on a religious objector’s\nspiritual development.\"); cf. Widmar, 454 U.S. at 269 n.6\n(rejecting distinction between \"religious worship\" and other\nreligious speech because it would require courts\"to inquire\ninto the significance of words and practices to different\nreligious faiths\" and \"[s]uch inquiries would tend inevitably\nto entangle the State with religion in a manner forbidden by\nour cases\").\n\nThird, the Borough asserts that the plaintiffs cannot\nstate a free exercise claim because the eruv is an \"optional\"\nreligious practice. For reasons similar to those counseling\nagainst requiring the plaintiffs to demonstrate a substantial\nburden on their religious practice, we cannot accept the\nBorough’s contention that courts presented with free\nexercise claims should, as a threshold matter, determine\nwhether the religious practices at issue are \"mandatory\" or\n\"optional.\" We need not consider whether the Borough’s\ncharacterization of the eruv is accurate. Neither the\nSupreme Court nor our Court has intimated that only\ncompulsory religious practices fall within the ambit of the\nFree Exercise Clause. To the contrary, our en banc decision\nin DeHart said that conduct implicates the Free Exercise\nClause if it is motivated by \"beliefs which are both sincerely\nheld and religious in nature\" without regard to whether it\nis mandatory. 227 F.3d at 51; cf. id. at 54-55 (rejecting\ncontention that, in the context of prisoners’ free exercise\nclaims, conduct based on \"religious commandments\"\nshould receive more protection than conduct that is\"a\npositive expression of belief\"); see also Levitan v. Ashcroft,\n281 F.3d 1313, 1319 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (holding that,\nbecause \"[a] requirement that a religious practice be\nmandatory to warrant First Amendment protection finds no\nwarrant in the cases of the Supreme Court or of this court,\"\nCatholic prisoners could raise free exercise challenge to rule\nbarring them from consuming small amounts of wine\nduring Communion).32 Further, if the Borough’s position\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n32. But see Ward v. Walsh, 1 F.3d 873, 878 (9th Cir. 1993) (suggesting,\nwithout citing supporting legal authority, that there is a \"distinction\n\n                                35\n\fwere correct, the Lukumi Court would have considered\nwhether Santeria adherents believe their faith commands\nthem to sacrifice animals. But the Court did not do so,\ninstead deeming it sufficient that they had a sincere desire\nto sacrifice animals for religious reasons. See Lukumi, 508\nU.S. at 531.\n\nAdditionally, if anything turned on whether a religious\npractice is \"mandatory\" or \"optional,\" courts would have to\nquestion \"the validity of particular litigants’ interpretations\nof [their] creeds\" and perhaps even adjudicate\n\"controversies over religious authority or dogma,\" tasks that\nare \"not within the judicial ken.\" Smith , 494 U.S. at 877,\n887 (internal quotation marks omitted); cf. Presbyterian\nChurch in U.S. v. Mary Elizabeth Hull Mem’l Presbyterian\nChurch, 393 U.S. 440, 449-50 (1969) (holding that the Free\nExercise Clause prohibits courts from deciding church\nproperty disputes by resolving underlying conflicts over \"the\ninterpretation of particular church doctrines and the\nimportance of those doctrines to the religion\"); see also\nUnited States v. Ballard, 322 U.S. 78, 84-88 (1944) (holding\nthat courts can inquire into the sincerity, but not the truth\nor falsity, of religious beliefs).\n\nFinally, if the First Amendment shielded only compulsory\nreligious practices, religions without commandments\n\"would find themselves outside the scope of First\nAmendment protection altogether,\" Levitan, 281 F.3d at\n1320, a result antithetical to basic Free Exercise Clause\nnorms. See, e.g., Fowler, 345 U.S. at 70 (\"[I]t is no business\nof courts to say that what is a religious practice or activity\nfor one group is not religion under the protection of the\nFirst Amendment.\").\n\nAs the Borough’s arguments for eschewing strict scrutiny\nare unpersuasive, we must consider whether its invocation\nof Ordinance 691 against the lechis is likely to pass that\ntest.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nbetween a religious practice which is a positive expression of belief and\na religious commandment which the believer may not violate at peril of\nhis soul\" in the context of prisoners’ free exercise claims).\n\n                                36\n\n\n2. Application of strict scrutiny\n\nBecause the Borough’s decision to remove the eruv is not\nneutral toward conduct motivated by Orthodox Jewish\nbeliefs, it \"must undergo the most rigorous of scrutiny.\"\nLukumi, 508 U.S. at 546. To be permissible under the Free\nExercise Clause, it \"must advance interests of the highest\norder and must be narrowly tailored in pursuit of those\ninterests.\" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nBorough attempts to justify its decision to remove the eruv,\nand distinguish the lechis from the violations of Ordinance\n\f691 it has tolerated, on the grounds that the lechis are\n\"permanent\" and religious in nature. Neither ground is\npersuasive.\n\nMuch of our strict scrutiny analysis parallels our earlier\ndiscussion of why the Borough’s decision is not religion-\nneutral. See Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 546-47 (stating that lack\nof neutrality eviscerates contention that restriction is\nnarrowly tailored to advance compelling interest). First, for\nmany years--and, the record shows, after the plaintiffs\nsued--the Borough has allowed its residents to nail house\nnumbers to utility poles. Because the Borough has\ntolerated equally permanent house numbers, it hardly has\na compelling interest in refusing to allow the inconspicuous\nlechis on the ground that they are permanent. Further, it is\nhard to see how the allegedly permanent nature of the\nunobtrusive lechis somehow undermines Ordinance 691’s\nobjective of avoiding visual clutter and maintaining control\nover municipal property more than items like bright orange\nribbons and lost animal signs. Moreover, even if the\nBorough had a compelling interest in preventing permanent\nfixtures on its utility poles, its decision to remove the eruv\nwhile allowing the house numbers is not narrowly tailored\nto promote that interest.\n\nThough the Borough’s claim that it can remove the eruv\nbecause of its religious nature requires more discussion, it\nis similarly unpersuasive. The Borough maintains that its\ndecision to remove the eruv is justified by its \"compelling\"\ninterest in avoiding \"an Establishment Clause controversy.\"\nContrary to the Borough’s position, however, a government\ninterest in imposing greater separation of church and state\nthan the federal Establishment Clause mandates is not\n\n                                37\n\n\ncompelling in the First Amendment context. See Widmar,\n454 U.S. at 276 (rejecting state university’s contention that\nits interest in complying with the state constitution’s\nprohibition on religious establishments, which was more\nrestrictive than its federal counterpart, justified\ndiscriminating against religious speech, and explaining that\n\"the state interest asserted here--in achieving greater\nseparation of church and State than is already ensured\nunder the Establishment Clause of the Federal Constitution\n--is limited by the Free Exercise Clause and in this case by\nthe Free Speech Clause as well\")33 Davey, 299 F.3d at 759\n(same in context of free exercise claim).\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n33. In 1990, a divided panel of our Court suggested in dictum--in a case\nthat did not involve a Free Exercise Clause claim, and without citing\nWidmar--that public schools have \"a compelling interest in maintaining\nthe appearance of religious neutrality\" in their classrooms, and that this\ninterest, even if not required by the Establishment Clause, might\noutweigh public employees’ free exercise right to wear religious garb.\nUnited States v. Board of Education, 911 F.2d 882, 889 (3d Cir. 1990)\n(holding that Title VII does not require public schools to allow teachers\nto wear religious garb, as this would impose an\"undue hardship\" on the\n\fschools under 42 U.S.C. S 2000e(j)). The opinions cited in support of this\nproposition were Cooper v. Eugene School District, 723 P.2d 298 (Or.\n1986)--which also did not cite Widmar--and the Supreme Court’s one-\nsentence order dismissing an appeal from the Oregon Supreme Court’s\nruling \"for want of a substantial federal question.\" 480 U.S. 942 (1987).\n\nTo the extent that the Oregon Supreme Court held in Cooper that\nconcerns about appearing neutral toward religion could outweigh\nemployees’ free exercise rights in the public school context, we do not\nbelieve the United States Supreme Court’s summary disposition\napproved that reasoning. Instead, we believe, especially in light of\nsubsequent doctrinal developments, that the dictum in United States v.\nBoard of Education may be inconsistent with Widmar’s principle that an\ninterest in more separation between church and state than the\nEstablishment Clause requires cannot justify restricting rights shielded\nby the Free Exercise Clause. See Widmar, 454 U.S. at 276.\n\nFirst, summary dispositions by the Supreme Court\"cannot be taken\nas adopting the reasoning of the lower court,\" Wis. Dep’t of Revenue v.\nWrigley Co., 505 U.S. 214, 224 n.2 (1992); Zobel v. Williams, 457 U.S.\n55, 64 n.13 (1982) (same), and they can be used as precedent \"only if\nthe [lower court’s] decision[ ] rested solely on established constitutional\nprinciples and did not break any new ground.\" Robert L. Stern et al.,\nSupreme Court Practice S 4.29, at 284 (8th ed. 2002). Hence the Supreme\n\n                                38\n\n\nThe Borough further argues, however, that leaving the\neruv in place would constitute an actual Establishment\nClause violation, and that the need to avoid such a\nviolation justifies discriminating against the plaintiffs’\nreligiously motivated conduct. Before explaining why this\nargument is also unavailing, we must examine the Supreme\nCourt’s recent pronouncements in the area.34 Until the past\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nCourt’s summary disposition in Cooper cannot be interpreted as\nendorsing the Oregon Supreme Court’s reasoning, particularly since that\nreasoning flatly contradicts Widmar. See Fusari v. Steinberg, 419 U.S.\n379, 388-89 n.15 (1975) (stating that, even though a lower court’s\ninterpretation of a summary affirmance by the Supreme Court was\n\"plausible,\" it was improper because it would\"leave little vitality\" to an\nearlier Supreme Court decision); see also id. at 391-92 (Burger, C.J.,\nconcurring) (\"An unexplicated summary affirmance settles the issues for\nthe parties, and is not to be read as a renunciation by this Court of\ndoctrines previously announced in our opinions after full argument.\").\n\nSince Cooper, moreover, the Supreme Court has held in several cases\nthat a government interest in appearing neutral toward religion, where\nnot necessary to comply with the Establishment Clause, cannot justify\nlimiting First Amendment rights. See Good News Club v. Milford Cent.\nSch., 533 U.S. 98, 112-19 (2001); Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 839-46;\nCapitol Square Review & Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U.S. 753, 761-63\n(1995); Lamb’s Chapel v. Ctr. Moriches Union Free Sch. Dist., 508 U.S.\n384, 395 (1993). Because subsequent doctrinal developments remove\nwhatever precedential authority a summary disposition inconsistent with\nthem might have, see Hicks v. Miranda, 422 U.S. 332, 344-45 (1975);\nLecates v. Justice of Peace Ct. No. 4, 637 F.2d 898, 902 (3d Cir. 1980),\nwe believe that in all likelihood the Supreme Court summarily dismissed\n\fthe appeal in Cooper under the principle of Pickering v. Board of\nEducation, 391 U.S. 563 (1968), which held that government can impose\nrestrictions on the First Amendment rights \"of public employees that\nwould be plainly unconstitutional if applied to the public at large.\" United\nStates v. Nat’l Employees Treasury Union, 513 U.S. 454, 465 (1995).\nThus the Supreme Court had no need in Cooper to consider whether an\ninterest in appearing neutral toward religion can trump free exercise\nrights outside the context of public employment.\n\n34. Two courts have held that the Establishment Clause allows a\nmunicipality affirmatively to grant Orthodox Jews access to public\nproperty so they can create an eruv. See ACLU of N.J. v. City of Long\nBranch, 670 F. Supp. 1293, 1295-97 (D.N.J. 1987); Smith v. Community\nBd. No. 14, 491 N.Y.S.2d 584, 586-87 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1985), aff’d, 518\nN.Y.S.2d 356, 357 (N.Y. App. Div. 1987). Those cases are not on point\nhere because the Borough has not approved the eruv.\n\n                                39\n\n\ndecade, the Supreme Court generally applied the three-\nprong test of Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971),\nunder which government action is consistent with the\nEstablishment Clause if it (1) \"has a secular purpose\"; (2)\n\"does not have the principal or primary effect of advancing\nor inhibiting religion\"; and (3) \"does not foster an excessive\nentanglement with religion.\" Lamb’s Chapel v. Ctr. Moriches\nUnion Free Sch. Dist., 508 U.S. 384, 395 (1993). 35\n\nRecent Supreme Court decisions, however, have not\napplied the Lemon test. Instead, in cases involving\nEstablishment Clause challenges to private individuals’ use\nof government resources, the Court has applied the\nendorsement test developed by Justice O’Connor, which\ndispenses with the \"entanglement\" prong of the Lemon test\nand collapses its \"purpose\" and \"effect\" prongs into a single\ninquiry: would a reasonable, informed observer, i.e., one\nfamiliar with the history and context of private individuals’\naccess to the public money or property at issue, perceive\nthe challenged government action as endorsing religion?36\nSee Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, ___ U.S. ___ , ___, 122 S.

Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 232-33 (1997), and in the rare case\nwhere government delegates civic power to a religious group. See Bd. of\nEduc. of Kiryas Joel Village Sch. Dist. v. Grumet , 512 U.S. 687, 696-705\n(1994); Larkin v. Grendel’s Den, Inc., 459 U.S. 116, 126-27 (1982).\n\n                                40\n\n\nindependent choices determined where children went to\nschool); Good News Club v. Milford Cent.

When presented with Establishment Clause claims in the context of\npublic education, the Supreme Court considers not only whether a\nreasonable, informed observer would perceive an endorsement of\nreligion, but also whether the challenged government practice coerces\nstudents into participating in religious activity. See Good News Club, 533\nU.S. at 115-16; Lee, 505 U.S. at 592-93. The Court has not applied its\ncoercion test outside the public education context.\n\n38. Seven Justices in Capitol Square agreed that the reasoning of Lamb’s\nChapel controlled, Capitol Square, 515 U.S. at 762, three of these seven\nexpressly applied the reasonable, informed observer test, see id. at 772\n(O’Connor, J., joined by Souter & Breyer, JJ.), and the two dissenting\nJustices also applied the endorsement test, see id. at 797-98 (Stevens,\nJ., dissenting); id. at 817-18 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). Four Justices,\nhowever, recognized that the endorsement test controls when\ngovernment discriminates in favor of religion, but argued that there is no\nneed to apply the test to \"purely private\" religious expression that occurs\nin a public forum \"open to all on equal terms\" because such expression\ncan never violate the Establishment Clause. Id. at 770 (opinion of Scalia,\nJ.). Notwithstanding the Justices’ divergent approaches, subsequent\nSupreme Court decisions treat the reasonable, informed observer test\ndiscussed at length in Justice O’Connor’s opinion as representing Capitol\nSquare’s holding with respect to the appropriate Establishment Clause\ntest. See Good News Club, 533 U.S. at 119; Santa Fe Indep. Sch. Dist. v.\nDoe, 530 U.S. 290, 308 (2000).\n\n                                41\n\fagainst Establishment Clause attack). Each of these\ndecisions upheld the challenged government action because\nit treated religion neutrally, and thus would not be viewed\nby a reasonable, informed observer as endorsing religion.39\n\nIn contrast, government runs afoul of the endorsement\ntest and violates the Establishment Clause when it\naffirmatively supports religion on preferential terms. See\nSanta Fe Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Doe, 530 U.S. 290, 305-10\n(2000) (invalidating school policy of encouraging and\nsponsoring student-initiated, student-led prayers before\nhigh school football games because reasonable, informed\nobserver would perceive school as endorsing religion);\nCounty of Allegheny v. ACLU, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter,\n492 U.S. 573, 598-601 (1989) (holding that county violated\nEstablishment Clause by giving Roman Catholic group\npreferential access to display stand-alone creche depicting\nbirth of Jesus on main staircase of its seat of government\nbecause reasonable observer would believe county’s action\nwas meant to support and promote Christianity); see also\nACLU of N.J. v. Black Horse Pike Regional Bd. of Educ., 84\nF.3d 1471, 1484-88 (3d Cir. 1996) (en banc) (invalidating\nscheme that allowed public high school students to choose\ngraduation prayer, but not any secular speech, by plurality\nvote).40 In addition, some Justices have held out the\npossibility that, even if government grants equal rather\nthan preferential access to religion, a reasonable, informed\nobserver could perceive an endorsement of religion in\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n39. While the Supreme Court’s Establishment Clause jurisprudence\nconsistently emphasizes neutrality toward religion, it allows government\nto \"accommodate religious needs by alleviating special burdens\" on\nreligious practice unless the \"accommodation\" delegates political power\nto a particular religious group or otherwise \"singles out a particular\nreligious sect for special treatment.\" Kiryas Joel Village Sch. Dist., 512\nU.S. at 705-06.\n\n40. The Allegheny Court also held, with no majority opinion on this\npoint, that local officials did not endorse religion by erecting a display\nincluding a menorah, a Christmas tree, and a sign entitled \"Salute to\nLiberty\" in front of another government building. See 492 U.S. at 613-21\n(opinion of Blackmun, J.); id. at 632-36 (O’Connor, J., concurring in part\nand concurring in the judgment); id. at 663-67 (Kennedy, J., concurring\nin the judgment in part and dissenting in part).\n\n                                42\n\n\nextraordinary cases. See Capitol Square, 515 U.S. at 777-78\n(O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in the\njudgment). For instance, if one or more religious groups\ndominated property the government made available to the\npublic, a reasonable observer might perceive an\nendorsement of religion. See id.; cf. Freedom from Religion\nFound. v. City of Marshfield, 203 F.3d 487, 489, 494-96\n(7th Cir. 2000) (holding that Establishment Clause was\nviolated where sole display in public forum was fifteen-foot-\ntall white marble statue of Jesus bearing inscription \"Christ\nGuide Us On Our Way\" in twelve-inch block letters and\n\ffacing oncoming traffic on adjacent highway).\n\nApplying these principles to this case, we believe that, if\nthe Borough ceased discriminating against the plaintiffs’\nreligiously motivated conduct to comply with the Free\nExercise Clause, a reasonable, informed observer would not\nperceive an endorsement of Orthodox Judaism because the\nBorough’s change of heart would \"reflect[] nothing more\nthan the governmental obligation of neutrality\" toward\nreligion. Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 409. A reasonable observer\n\"must be deemed aware of the history and context of the\ncommunity,\" Good News Club, 533 U.S. at 119 (internal\nquotation marks omitted); see also Zelman, 122 S. Ct. at\n2468-69; Black Horse Pike, 84 F.3d at 1486, and\n\"presumed to possess a certain level of information that all\ncitizens might not share.\" Capitol Square, 515 U.S. at 780\n(O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in the\njudgment); see also Good News Club, 533 U.S. at 118\n(stating that reasonable observer would know about non-\nneutral implementation of policy); ACLU of N.J. v.\nSchundler, 168 F.3d at 106 (noting that reasonable\nobserver would be aware of city’s year-round practices\nregarding cultural displays and celebrations). Thus the\nreasonable, informed observer would know that the lechis\nare items with religious significance and that they enable\nOrthodox Jews to engage in activities otherwise off limits on\nthe Sabbath, but would also know that the Borough was\nallowing them to remain on the utility poles only because\nits selective application of Ordinance 691 renders removing\nthe lechis a free exercise violation. See Allegheny, 492 U.S.\nat 632 (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in\nthe judgment) (\"In cases involving the lifting of government\n\n                                43\n\n\nburdens on the free exercise of religion, a reasonable\nobserver would take into account the values underlying the\nFree Exercise Clause in assessing whether the challenged\npractice conveyed a message of endorsement.\"). Cognizant\nof the Borough’s secular purpose of complying with the\nFree Exercise Clause, see Mergens, 496 U.S. at 249, and\nthe religion-neutral effect of treating the lechis like other\npostings, the reasonable observer would not believe that the\nBorough was promoting Orthodox Judaism. See Gregoire v.\nCentennial Sch. Dist., 907 F.2d 1366, 1380 (3d Cir. 1990)\n(concluding that religion-neutral treatment of Christian\ngroup seeking access to public school facilities sent\nmessage of neutrality toward, not endorsement of, religion).\nThis is true a fortiori because there is no evidence in the\ncurrent record that the unobtrusive lechis are intended to\nsend a religious message to anyone.\n\nFurther, there is a vital difference between purely private\nreligiously motivated conduct and conduct initiated or\nsponsored by government. See Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at\n841. No reasonable, informed observer would perceive the\ndecision of the plaintiffs to affix lechis to utility poles owned\nby Verizon and to do so with Cablevision’s assistance as \" ‘a\nchoice attributable to the State.’ \" Santa Fe Indep., 530 U.S.\n\fat 311 (quoting Lee, 505 U.S. at 587). Similarly, because\nthe eruv is maintained solely with private funds, and\nbecause allowing the lechis to remain in place would\nrepresent neutral rather than preferential treatment of\nreligiously motivated conduct, no reasonable, informed\nobserver would believe the Borough is \"affirmatively\nsponsor[ing]\" an Orthodox Jewish practice. Santa Fe Indep.,\n530 U.S. at 313.\n\nTo the extent that access to the utility poles on Borough\nland constitutes a \"benefit,\" \"the ‘guarantee of neutrality is\nrespected, not offended\"’ when religious persons benefit\nincidentally from \"‘neutral criteria and evenhanded\npolicies.\"’ Good News Club, 533 U.S. at 114 (quoting\nRosenberger, 515 U.S. at 839). In this context, there is \"no\nrealistic danger\" that, if the Borough treated the plaintiffs’\nreligiously motivated conduct on religion-neutral terms,\nreasonable, informed observers would perceive an\nendorsement of Orthodox Judaism. Lamb’s Chapel , 508\n\n                                44\n\n\nU.S. at 395. Moreover, even if there is some slight risk that\na reasonable, informed observer might \"misperceive the\nendorsement of religion,\" there is a much greater risk that\nthe observer would perceive hostility toward Orthodox Jews\nif the Borough removes the lechis. Good News Club, 533\nU.S. at 118; Mergens, 496 U.S. at 248; see also\nRosenberger, 515 U.S. at 846 (O’Connor, J., concurring)\n(\"Withholding access would leave an impermissible\nperception that religious activities are disfavored.\").41\n\nBecause the Free Exercise Clause requires neutral\ntreatment of religion, see Smith, 494 U.S. at 879, only in a\nmost unusual case could compliance with free exercise\nnorms offend the Establishment Clause. Cf. Kiryas Joel\nVillage Sch. Dist., 512 U.S. at 717 (O’Connor, J.,\nconcurring) (\"The Religion Clauses prohibit the government\nfrom favoring religion, but they provide no warrant for\ndiscriminating against religion.\") (emphasis in original).\nThis is not such a case. Therefore, the Borough has no\nEstablishment Clause justification for discriminating\nagainst the plaintiffs’ religiously motivated conduct.\nAccordingly, the plaintiffs are reasonably likely to prevail on\ntheir free exercise claim.\n\n3. Requirements for preliminary injunctive relief\n\nWhere a district court has denied a motion for a\npreliminary injunction, we may order the injunction to\nissue if \"the four factors required to grant a preliminary\ninjunction are apparent on the record before us.\" Tanimura\n& Antle, Inc. v. Packed Fresh Produce, Inc., 222 F.3d 132,\n140 (3d Cir. 2000); see also Council of Alternative Political\nParties v. Hooks, 121 F.3d 876, 883-84 (3d Cir. 1997);\nPolaroid Corp. v. Disney, 862 F.2d 987, 1006 (3d Cir. 1988).\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n41. To the extent that the Lemon test retains some trace of vitality, see\n\fBlack Horse Pike, 84 F.3d at 1484, even after Zelman, Good News Club,\nand Santa Fe eschewed it in favor of the endorsement test, it does not\nsupport the Borough’s Establishment Clause defense. Allowing the eruv\nto remain in place serves the secular purpose of complying with the Free\nExercise Clause, does not have the effect of advancing religion because\nno reasonable, informed observer would perceive an endorsement of\nreligion, and involves no government entanglement with religion because\nthe Borough will not monitor or support the maintenance of the eruv.\n\n                                45\n\n\nOur review of the record leaves us convinced that, in\naddition to the reasonable probability that the plaintiffs will\nultimately prevail on their free exercise claim, the\nremaining three factors for injunctive relief--irreparable\ninjury, the balance of hardships, and the public interest--\nalso favor a preliminary injunction. Limitations on the free\nexercise of religion inflict irreparable injury. Fifth Ave.\nPresbyterian Church v. City of New York, 293 F.3d 570, 574\n(2d Cir. 2002); Kikumura v. Hurley, 242 F.3d 950, 963\n(10th Cir. 2001); see also Swartzwelder v. McNeilly, 297\nF.3d 228, 241 (3d Cir. 2002) (\"‘The loss of First Amendment\nfreedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably\nconstitutes irreparable injury.\"’) (quoting Elrod v. Burns,\n427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976)). The plaintiffs have demonstrated\nthat, if the eruv is removed, they will be unable to push and\ncarry objects outside the home on the Sabbath, and those\nwho are disabled or have small children consequently will\nbe unable to attend synagogue. This showing easily\nsatisfies the irreparable injury requirement.\n\nWith respect to the balance of hardships, a preliminary\ninjunction would not harm the Borough more than denying\nrelief would harm the plaintiffs. Enjoining removal of the\neruv would cause neither the Borough nor its residents any\nserious injury. Without an injunction, on the other hand,\nthe plaintiffs’ free exercise of religion will be impaired. The\nbalance easily tips in the plaintiffs’ favor.\n\nFinally, where there are no societal benefits justifying a\nburden on religious freedom, \"the public interest clearly\nfavors the protection of constitutional rights.\" Council of\nAlternative Political Parties v. Hooks, 121 F.3d 876, 884 (3d\nCir. 1997). We do not see how removing the lechis could\nadvance any interests sufficient to outweigh the\ninfringement of the plaintiffs’ free exercise rights.\n\nIn this context, the District Court should have\npreliminarily enjoined the Borough from removing the lechis\npending a trial.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nThough the plaintiffs are not likely to prevail on their Fair\nHousing Act claim and do not present a viable free speech\n\n                                46\n\fclaim, they are reasonably likely to show that the Borough\nviolated the Free Exercise Clause by applying Ordinance\n691 selectively against conduct motivated by Orthodox\nJewish beliefs. Because the three other factors for\ninjunctive relief also favor the plaintiffs, we reverse the\nDistrict Court’s denial of injunctive relief and will enter an\norder directing the Court to issue a preliminary injunction\nbarring the Borough from removing the lechis.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                                47\n\f",

Because there is no evidence that the acts\nin question are expressive, we hold that the Free Speech\nClause does not apply. We further hold, however, that the\nBorough’s selective enforcement of its ordinance likely\nviolated the Free Exercise Clause. Because the other\nrequirements for injunctive relief are satisfied, we reverse\nand direct the District Court to issue a preliminary\ninjunction.\n\nI. Background\n\nAn ordinance in the Borough of Tenafly, which\nencompasses 4.4 square miles and has a population of\n13,806,1 provides in pertinent part: \"No person shall place\nany sign or advertisement, or other matter upon any pole,\ntree, curbstone, sidewalk or elsewhere, in any public street\nor public place, excepting such as may be authorized by\nthis or any other ordinance of the Borough.\" Tenafly, N.J.,\nOrdinance 691 Article VIII(7) (1954).2 Although Ordinance\n691 does not allow Borough officials to make exceptions on\na case-by-case basis, in practice they have often done so.\nHouse number signs nailed to utility poles in plain view are\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. See Borough of Tenafly, About Tenafly, at http://www.tenaflynj.org/\nabout.htm (last visited September 20, 2002).\n\n2. Our description of the facts is based on our independent review of the\nrecord because, as explained in more detail below, the First Amendment\nbars us from deferring to the District Court’s factual findings unless they\ninvolve witness credibility. See Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian &\nBisexual Group of Boston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117960\"><a href=\"/opinion/117960/hurley-v-irish-american-gay-lesbian-and-bisexual-group-of-boston-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 567 (1995).\n\n                                4\n\n\nfrequently left in place. Local churches are tacitly allowed to\n\fpost permanent directional signs bearing crosses on\nmunicipal property. Lost animal signs and other private\npostings often remain undisturbed by Borough officials.\nOrange ribbons were affixed to utility poles \"for a lengthy\nperiod of time\" by supporters of the local high school during\na protracted controversy over school regionalization, but\nBorough officials made no effort to remove them. Every\nyear, officials in the small community permit the local\nChamber of Commerce to affix holiday displays to the\nBorough’s utility poles for approximately six weeks during\nthe Christmas holiday season. Red ribbons, wreaths, and\nseasonal holiday lights are attached to the Borough’s utility\npoles as part of these displays.\n\nThe plaintiffs in this case are Orthodox Jewish residents\nof Tenafly3 whose faith forbids them from pushing or\ncarrying objects outside their homes on the Sabbath or\nYom Kippur.4 In accordance with a religious convention\npracticed by Orthodox Jews for over two thousand years,\nhowever, the plaintiffs believe they may engage in such\nactivities outside their homes on the Sabbath within an\neruv, a ceremonial demarcation of an area. Tenafly Eruv\nAss’n, Inc. v. Borough of Tenafly, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2366382\"><a href=\"/opinion/2366382/tenafly-eruv-assn-inc-v-borough-of-tenafly/\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">142</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 146\n(D.N.J. 2001). An eruv extends the space within which\npushing and carrying is permitted on the Sabbath beyond\nthe boundaries of the home, thereby enabling, for example,\nthe plaintiffs to push baby strollers and wheelchairs, and\ncarry canes and walkers, when traveling between home and\nsynagogue. Without an eruv Orthodox Jews who have small\nchildren or are disabled typically cannot attend synagogue\non the Sabbath.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. Tenafly Eruv Association, Inc. (\"TEAI\") is an organization formed to\npromote the creation of an eruv in Tenafly. Chaim Book, Yosifa Book,\nand Stefanie Dardik Gotlieb live in Tenafly. At the time of briefing in this\nappeal, Stephen Brenner was not a Tenafly resident, but was building a\nhouse in Tenafly and planned to move there once it was completed. For\nsimplicity, we refer to TEAI and the individual plaintiffs collectively as\n\"the plaintiffs\" throughout this opinion.\n\n4. For simplicity, we refer throughout the remainder of our opinion only\nto the Sabbath.\n\n                                5\n\n\nCenturies ago, an eruv would be built using ropes and\nwooden poles. Today, Orthodox Jews can construct an eruv\nby attaching lechis--thin black strips made of the same\nhard plastic material as, and nearly identical to, the\ncoverings on ordinary ground wires--vertically along utility\npoles. Along with preexisting horizontal overhead utility\nlines, the lechis designate an eruv’s boundaries.5 Unless one\nknows which black plastic strips are lechis and which are\nutility wires, it is \"absolutely impossible\" to distinguish the\ntwo. Id. at 149. Throughout this litigation, the plaintiffs\nhave maintained that an eruv (as well as each constituent\nlechi) is \"not a religious symbol,\" but rather is an item with\n\"religious significance.\" Id. at 148.\n\fOn June 1, 1999, Erez Gotlieb and Gary Osen, two\nOrthodox Jews who are not parties to this case, met with\nTenafly Mayor Ann Moscovitz to discuss creating an eruv in\nthe Borough. Gotlieb and Osen met with Moscovitz because\nunder Orthodox Jewish law an eruv is not valid unless a\ncivil official with jurisdiction over the circumscribed area\nissues a ceremonial proclamation \"renting\" the area for a\nnominal fee (e.g., one dollar). The Mayor said she lacked\nauthority to issue the requested proclamation, but agreed\nto bring the matter to the attention of the Borough Council,\nthe Borough’s legislative branch.6 She did not mention\nOrdinance 691 or suggest that affixing lechis to utility poles\nmight violate any other ordinance.\n\nAt the next Council meeting, on July 8, 1999, the\nCouncil and approximately thirty Tenafly residents debated\nwhether the Borough should grant the proclamation. Many\nof those present expressed vehement objections prompted\nby their fear that an eruv would encourage Orthodox Jews\nto move to Tenafly. A Council member whom the District\nCourt was unable to identify noted \"a concern that the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. Many major cities across the United States--such as Washington,\nD.C., New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Baltimore, Atlanta,\nand Cincinnati--have one or more eruvs. Both the White House and the\nUnited States Supreme Court are within the boundaries of an eruv.\n\n6. Six Council members compose the Borough’s legislative branch. The\nMayor does not participate in lawmaking unless the Council is\ndeadlocked, in which case she casts the tie-breaking vote.\n\n                                6\n\n\nOrthodoxy would take over\" Tenafly. Id. at 151-52. One\nCouncil member voiced his \"serious concern\" that \"Ultra-\nOrthodox\" Jews might \"stone[ ] cars that drive down the\nstreets on the Sabbath.\" Id. at 153-54. The Borough\nAttorney participated in the debate. Neither he nor anyone\nelse mentioned Ordinance 691 or indicated that attaching\nlechis to utility poles might be unlawful.\n\nThe Council decided to demand a formal, written\nproposal before voting on whether to issue the\nproclamation. Mayor Moscovitz advised Gotlieb and Osen,\nwho did not attend the meeting, that the Council was\nunlikely to grant their request for a proclamation, but\ninvited them to submit a formal application. Frustrated by\nthe Borough’s reticence, in August 1999 TEAI asked Bergen\nCounty Executive William P. Schuber, whose jurisdiction\nincludes Tenafly, to issue the ceremonial proclamation\nnecessary to validate the eruv. On December 15, 1999, he\ndid so. The constitutionality of this action is not challenged\nin this case, and neither Schuber nor any other Bergen\nCounty official is a party.\n\nVerizon, the local telephone company, owns the utility\npoles in Tenafly, though the poles are located on the\n\fBorough’s property.7 In April 2000, the plaintiffs asked\nVerizon for permission to attach lechis to its utility poles.\nThe plaintiffs said in a sworn statement, which the District\nCourt found \"credible,\" that they did not believe any\nmunicipal ordinance prohibited them from doing so, and\nthus that they did not need the Council’s permission. Id. at\n155. After the plaintiffs informed Verizon about the\nproclamation, they say, the company’s in-house counsel\nresearched whether municipal approval was required and\nadvised the plaintiffs that it was not.\n\nIn June 2000 Cablevision, holder of the local cable\ntelevision franchise, volunteered to help the plaintiffs affix\nlechis to Verizon’s utility poles as a community service.\nWith the help of Cablevision personnel and equipment, an\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. When some of the events pertinent to this case occurred, the company\nnow known as Verizon was named Bell Atlantic Telephone Company.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 154-55. For convenience we refer to it as Verizon\nthroughout.\n\n                                7\n\n\neruv was completed in Tenafly sometime in September 2000.8\nThe plaintiffs represent, and the Borough does not disagree,\nthat only private funds have supported the eruv and that\nno municipal assistance of any kind will be needed to\nmaintain it.\n\nBorough officials apparently did not learn that an eruv\nwas being erected in Tenafly until late August 2000. Mayor\nMoscovitz and Councilman Charles Lipson met with two\nlocal Jewish leaders on September 14, 2000, to discuss the\nmatter. One of the Jewish leaders perceived some of the\nMayor’s remarks as derogatory toward Orthodox Jews, and\nthe meeting was unproductive. Twelve days later, Borough\nAdministrator Joseph DiGiacomo, acting at the Mayor’s\nbehest, asked Cablevision why it helped attach the lechis\nwithout the Borough’s permission. According to DiGiacomo,\nthe company told him that \"a Rabbi\" had advised it that\nTEAI had the necessary government approval. Id. at 158.\nOn October 10, 2000, Mayor Moscovitz and the Council\ndirected the Borough Administrator to ask Cablevision to\nremove the lechis from the utility poles\"as soon as\npossible.\" Id.\n\nOn October 23, 2000, Cablevision wrote to the plaintiffs\nand informed them that the Borough instructed it to take\ndown the lechis. Cablevision said it would begin complying\nwith the Borough’s order within three days unless the\nplaintiffs demonstrated they had municipal approval.\nCounsel for the plaintiffs subsequently negotiated from the\nBorough a thirty-day reprieve to give TEAI an opportunity\nto apply for permission from the Council to maintain the\neruv. The letter setting out this agreement, sent by the\nplaintiffs’ counsel to Borough Attorney Walter Lesnevich,\nstates in part: \"I also appreciate your advice that the\nBorough has no specific ordinance covering this matter or\n\fany particular format for the Eruv Association to follow in\nsubmitting its request.\" Id. at 159. By the beginning of\nNovember 2000, neither Lesnevich nor any other Borough\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. According to the District Court, a map of Tenafly, which does not\nappear in the appellate record, \"suggests\" that the eruv enables the\nplaintiffs to push and carry objects in 35-40% of the Borough. 155 F.\nSupp. 2d at 149.\n\n                                8\n\n\nofficial had raised the possibility that Ordinance 691 or\nanother ordinance might be relevant to the dispute over the\nlechis.\n\nOn November 7, 2000, the plaintiffs filed their application\nwith the Borough, asking the Council not to remove or\norder the removal of the lechis. On November 21, 2000, the\nCouncil decided to hold two hearings to allow members of\nthe public to comment on the plaintiffs’ proposal. The\nCouncil scheduled the first hearing for November 28, 2000,\nand the second for December 12, 2000. Fifty-four members\nof the public, including plaintiff Chaim Book and other eruv\nproponents, spoke at the two hearings. The speakers were\nevenly divided between supporters and opponents of the\neruv. During the hearings, Council members did not\nexpress their views until the conclusion of the December 12\nhearing. At that hearing, just before the Council voted on\nthe plaintiffs’ application, one Councilman stated that \"[t]o\nthe best of my knowledge,\" the Borough had \"no ordinance,\nno resolution that says that you cannot hang something\nfrom a utility pole.\" Mayor Moscovitz responded by saying\n\"[t]here is an ordinance,\" and Lesnevich then described\nOrdinance 691. This exchange was apparently the first time\nthat Borough officials mentioned Ordinance 691 with\nregard to the lechis.\n\nShortly after Lesnevich brought Ordinance 691 to the\nCouncil members’ attention, the Council voted 5-0 to force\nthe plaintiffs to remove the lechis.9 The next day, the\nBorough ordered Cablevision to take the lechis off the utility\npoles \"as soon as possible.\" </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The\nplaintiffs responded by suing in the District Court on\nDecember 15, 2000, alleging violations of the First and\nFourteenth Amendments, 42 U.S.C. SS 1983 and 1985, and\nthe Fair Housing Act (\"FHA\"), 42 U.S.C. S 3604(a), and\nseeking an injunction barring the Borough from interfering\nwith the eruv.10\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9. One Council member was not present and thus did not vote.\n\n10. The plaintiffs did not allege an Equal Protection Clause violation. In\naddition, though not relevant to this appeal, the plaintiffs sought\ncompensatory damages and attorneys’ fees.\n\n                                9\n\fPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b), the\nDistrict Court issued a temporary restraining order\nprecluding the Borough from disturbing the eruv . Consent\norders extended the duration of the restraint until the\nCourt ruled on the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary\ninjunction. After the parties completed limited discovery,\nthe Court held an evidentiary hearing that spanned four\ndays, received additional affidavits, and heard oral\narguments. On August 10, 2001, the Court issued an\nopinion denying the plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief\non the ground that they are not reasonably likely to\nsucceed on the merits of any of their claims.\n\nThe District Court’s discussion began with the plaintiffs’\nclaim that the Borough violated the First Amendment’s Free\nSpeech Clause. The Court concluded (albeit without citing\nour decision in Troster v. Pennsylvania State Department of\nCorrections, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"703991\"><a href=\"/opinion/703991/dieter-hm-troster-v-pennsylvania-state-department-of-corrections-joseph/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1086</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1995)) that the act of\naffixing lechis to utility poles is \"symbolic speech.\" 155 F.\nSupp. 2d at 173. Next the Court determined that the\nBorough’s utility poles are a nonpublic forum, and that the\nBorough did not discriminate against the plaintiffs’ religious\nviewpoint when it ordered the lechis removed. Id. at 174-80.\nThe Court acknowledged that the Borough had expressly or\ntacitly permitted various facial violations of Ordinance 691,11\nsuch as the holiday displays and church directional signs.\nBut it distinguished the lechis, reasoning that the other\nmaterials affixed to the utility poles served commercial or\nfunctional purposes, were not religious in nature, and were\nnot intended to be attached permanently. Id. at 176-78.\nOther items frequently affixed to utility poles in violation of\nOrdinance 691, such as the lost animal signs and\npermanently attached house numbers, did not show\ndiscriminatory enforcement because the Borough said it\nmade efforts to remove some of them after the plaintiffs\nsued. Id. at 177-78. As for the orange ribbons, the Court\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11. The Borough submitted a copy of a separate ordinance that prohibits\nposting signs on utility poles. The Borough has not suggested, either to\nthe District Court or to our Court, that its decision to remove the lechis\nwas based on that ordinance. Instead, it has maintained throughout this\nlitigation that its decision was based only on Ordinance 691. See, e.g.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Id. at 177. The Court concluded that\nthe Borough’s application of the ordinance did not\ndiscriminate against the plaintiffs’ religious viewpoint, and\nthus their free speech claim could not succeed. Id. at 180.\n\nThe District Court also rejected the plaintiffs’ claim that\nthe Borough violated the First Amendment’s Free Exercise\nClause. Id. at 180-86. The Court disagreed with the\n\fplaintiffs’ position that the objective effect of the Borough’s\ndecision was to discriminate against religiously motivated\nactivity. It noted that, under Lyng v. Northwest Indian\nCemetery Protective Ass’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112037\"><a href=\"/opinion/112037/lyng-v-northwest-indian-cemetery-protective-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1988), the\nBorough can deny access to utility poles on its land for a\nreligion-neutral reason even if doing so imposes an\n\"incidental\" burden on Orthodox Jews’ ability to practice\ntheir religion. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The Court did not consider whether its earlier\nconclusion that Borough officials chose not to enforce\nOrdinance 691 with respect to some secularly motivated\ncommercial and functional postings, see id. at 177-80,\naffected the free exercise analysis. Under Smith , the District\nCourt reasoned, the Borough Council’s decision to enforce\nOrdinance 691 against the eruv had an objectively neutral\neffect that did not implicate the Free Exercise Clause. Id.\n\nThe Court thought, however, that the Council members’\nimproper subjective motivations nonetheless necessitated\nstrict scrutiny under Lukumi. Id. at 183. It found that,\nwhile the Council members had no religious animosity, they\nacted because of the \"constitutionally impermissible\" fear\nthat the eruv would facilitate the formation of an insular\nOrthodox Jewish \"community within a community\" in\nTenafly. Id. at 182-83. Nevertheless, no Free Exercise\n\n                                11\n\n\nClause violation occurred because the Council members’\ndecision was \"narrowly tailored to further their interest in\navoiding the appearance of an Establishment Clause\nconcern.\" Id. at 184 n.26 (emphasis added).\n\nFinally, the Court held that the plaintiffs lack standing to\nsue under the FHA because the Borough did not \"make\nunavailable or deny\" housing within the meaning of the\nrelevant provision, 42 U.S.C. S 3604(a). Id. at 186-90. Every\ncase finding a violation of S 3604(a), the District Court\nnoted, involved conduct that \"directly affected the\navailability of housing,\" whereas the plaintiffs seek a \"non-\nhousing use of municipal property.\" Id. at 187.\n\nThe Court concluded that, because the plaintiffs were not\nreasonably likely to succeed on any of their claims,\ninjunctive relief was not appropriate. The plaintiffs timely\nappealed, giving us jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\nS 1292(a)(1),12 and we granted their request for an\ninjunction prohibiting removal of the lechis pending our\ndecision.

Discussion\n\nFour factors governed the District Court’s decision\nwhether to issue a preliminary injunction barring the\nBorough from removing the eruv. To obtain an injunction,\nthe plaintiffs had to demonstrate (1) that they are\nreasonably likely to prevail eventually in the litigation and\n(2) that they are likely to suffer irreparable injury without\nrelief. See S. Camden Citizens, 274 F.3d at 777; Adams v.\nFreedom Forge Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767734\"><a href=\"/opinion/767734/david-l-adams-aaron-f-andrews-paul-a-archibald-lynn-e-aurand-dorothy-e/\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">475</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 484 (3d Cir. 2000). If\nthese two threshold showings are made the District Court\nthen considers, to the extent relevant, (3) whether an\ninjunction would harm the Borough more than denying\n\frelief would harm the plaintiffs and (4) whether granting\nrelief would serve the public interest. See S. Camden\nCitizens, 274 F.3d at 777; Freedom Forge, 204 F.3d at 484.\nBecause the District Court ended its analysis after\nconcluding that the plaintiffs did not show that their claims\nare reasonably likely to succeed, see </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at\n171, 191, our discussion focuses on that factor. Disposing\n\n                                13\n\n\nof the plaintiffs’ FHA claim in the margin,13 we will first\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13. We can dispense quickly with the plaintiffs’ contention that they have\na valid FHA claim. One necessary element of a cause of action under the\nFHA is that the plaintiffs must be \"aggrieved person[s],\" 42 U.S.C.\nS 3613(a)(1)(A), which in this context means victims of \"a discriminatory\nhousing practice,\" id. S 3602, that\"make[s] unavailable or den[ies]\"\nhousing to them based on their religion. Id.S 3604(a). Some of the\nplaintiffs lived in the Borough before the eruv was established. 155 F.\nSupp. 2d at 188. Therefore, while the plaintiffs claim that the Borough\nwants to remove the eruv to discourage Orthodox Jews from moving into\ntown, they do not claim that removing the eruv would make housing\nwithin the Borough \"unavailable\" to them. Instead, they argue that\nremoving the eruv would make their living in the Borough much less\ndesirable. But they concede that the Borough’s decision did not directly\naffect anyone’s current or future home. To our knowledge, no court has\nstretched the \"make unavailable or deny\" language of S 3604(a) to\nencompass actions that both (1) do not actually make it more difficult (as\nopposed to less desirable) to obtain housing and (2) do not directly\nregulate or zone housing or activities within the home. See, e.g., LeBlanc-\nSternberg v. Fletcher, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"705906\"><a href=\"/opinion/705906/rabbi-yitzchok-leblanc-sternberg-chanie-leblanc-sternberg-fred-walfish/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">412</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 424 (2d Cir. 1995) (stating that the\npertinent language \"has been interpreted to reach a wide variety of\ndiscriminatory housing practices, including discriminatory zoning\nrestrictions\"); South-Suburban Hous.

We believe that expanding S 3604(a) as the plaintiffs\nsuggest is unwarranted, as it would \"create an FHA claim in every\ncircumstance where a religious group is denied a request to use\nmunicipal property to make an area more appealing for the private\npractice of their religion,\" even if the municipal action has nothing to do\nwith housing. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 189.\n\nWe note, however, that we do not agree with the Borough’s contention\n--and the District Court’s acquiescence, if its use of the word \"standing\"\nwas meant to signify a perceived lack of subject-matter jurisdiction over\nthe plaintiffs’ FHA claim--that the issue is jurisdictional. When the\npresence or absence of a cause of action depends on how statutory\nlanguage is interpreted (as the plaintiffs’ FHA claim does), the absence of\na valid statutory cause of action does not preclude jurisdiction unless\nthe claim is frivolous or a transparent attempt to manufacture federal-\ncourt jurisdiction where none existed.

I. \"Speech\" is not construed\nliterally, or even limited to the use of words. Constitutional\nprotection is afforded not only to speaking and writing, but\nalso to some nonverbal acts of communication, viz.,\n\"expressive conduct\" (or \"symbolic speech\"). Affixing lechis\nto utility poles does not involve the use of words, so the\nplaintiffs’ behavior is protected by the Free Speech Clause\nonly if it constitutes expressive conduct.15\n_________________________________________________________________\n\njurisdiction to consider it.

Context is crucial to evaluating an\nexpressive conduct claim because \"the context may give\nmeaning to the symbol\" or act in question. Spence, 418\nU.S. at 410.\n\nUntil 1995, the Supreme Court determined whether\nspeech is \"sufficiently imbued with elements of\ncommunication\" by asking \"whether ‘[a]n intent to convey a\nparticularized message was present, and [whether] in the\nsurrounding circumstances the likelihood was great that\nthe message would be understood by those who viewed it.\"’\nTexas v.

Applying this two-prong test\n(the \"Spence-Johnson test\"), the Supreme Court held that\nthe First Amendment shelters certain forms of nonverbal\ncommunication. For instance, Johnson held that burning\nan American flag as part of a demonstration against the\nReagan Administration’s policies that coincided with the\n1984 Republican Party convention was \"speech\" because its\n\"expressive, overtly political nature\" was\"both intentional\nand overwhelmingly apparent\" to the protestors’ audience.\n491 U.S. at 399, 406. Similarly, Spence held that attaching\na peace symbol to an American flag and displaying the\n\"peace flag\" upside down was protected expression. The\nactor \"testified that he put a peace symbol on the flag and\ndisplayed it to public view as a protest against the invasion\nof Cambodia and the killings at Kent State University,\nevents which occurred a few days prior to his arrest,\" and\n\"it would have been difficult for the great majority of\ncitizens to miss the drift of appellant’s point at the time\nthat he made it.\" 418 U.S. at 408, 410.

Va. 1996).\n\n                                19\n\n\nassertion that the flag patch regulation compels expressive\nconduct.\" Id. at 1091 n.4.\n\nOur discussion in Troster focused on two inquiries. First,\nwe examined whether the officer intended subjectively (i.e.,\nactually intended) for his conduct to communicate to\npersons whom he expected to observe it (i.e., his intended\naudience). We determined that there was no proof that his\nconduct was \"demonstrative of an attitude or belief\" or that\nhe \"actually assert[ed] anything to anyone.\" Id. at 1091-92.\nSecond, we considered whether observers understood the\nmessage the officer intended his conduct to convey. The\nrecord contained no evidence that \"observers would likely\nunderstand the patch or the wearer to be telling them\nanything about the wearers’ beliefs\" or \"that the flag patch\non the correctional officers’ uniform will relay any message\n(ideological or otherwise) to anyone.\" Id. at 1091-92\n(emphases in original). Therefore, the officer’s compelled\nspeech claim failed because he did not show that the\nconduct in which he was forced to engage was expressive.\n\nOur emphasis in Troster on the putative speaker’s burden\nof proving that his conduct is \"sufficiently imbued with\nelements of communication\" is important to our resolution\nof the plaintiffs’ expressive conduct claim in this case. If the\nputative speaker’s burden were \"limited to ‘the\nadvancement of a plausible contention’ that [his or her]\nconduct is expressive\"--a view espoused by a plurality of\nthe D.C. Circuit but rejected by the Supreme Court in Clark\n--the result \"would be to create a rule that all conduct is\npresumptively expressive.\" Clark, 468 U.S. at 293 n.5. Such\na rule would be inconsistent with the Supreme Court’s\nrepeated admonition that \"[w]e cannot accept the view that\nan apparently limitless variety of conduct can be labeled\n‘speech.\"’ O’Brien, 391 U.S. at 376; see also Johnson, 491\nU.S. at 404; Spence, 418 U.S. at 409. Therefore, as we\nstressed in Troster, 65 F.3d at 1091-92, and as the\nSupreme Court held in Clark, \"it is the obligation of the\nperson desiring to engage in assertedly expressive conduct\nto demonstrate that the First Amendment even applies.\"\nClark, 468 U.S. at 293 n.5.\n\nWith this background as context, we conclude that the\nplaintiffs have not met their burden of showing that affixing\n\n                                20\n\n\nlechis to utility poles is \"sufficiently imbued with elements\nof communication\" to be deemed expressive conduct. The\nrecord indicates that the lechis were attached for the benefit\nof other Orthodox Jews, not the general public. Therefore,\nif the plaintiffs’ conduct is expressive, their intended\naudience is other Orthodox Jews. But the plaintiffs have\nnot introduced evidence that the lechis are meant to\n\fdemonstrate a belief or assert anything to Orthodox Jews or\nthat Orthodox Jews \"likely understand\" the eruv \"to be\ntelling them anything,\" i.e., that they discern \"any message\n(ideological or otherwise)\" from the lechis .19 Troster, 65 F.3d\nat 1091 (emphases in original). Instead, on the record\nbefore us, it appears that the eruv serves a purely\nfunctional, non-communicative purpose indistinguishable,\nfor free speech purposes, from that of a fence surrounding\na yard or a wall surrounding a building.\n\nRather than \"actually assert[ing] anything to anyone,\" id.\nat 1092, it seems that the eruv simply demarcates the\nspace within which certain activities otherwise forbidden on\nthe Sabbath are allowed. Plaintiff Chaim Book described\nthe eruv as a \"boundary\" that \"requires physical\ndemarcation,\" a function historically achieved by\"rop[ing]\nan area off.\" Similarly, at oral argument counsel for the\nplaintiffs told us that the lechis \"replace[ ] the pole[s] that\nwould be used prior to the time there were telephone poles\"\nto designate the eruv’s boundaries. While the plaintiffs\ndescribe the eruv in functional terms, explaining that it\nestablishes an area within which Orthodox Jews may\nengage in certain otherwise impermissible activities, they\noffer no evidence that it communicates anything. The only\nevidence the plaintiffs introduced with respect to the\nreligious significance of the eruv was the affidavit of Rabbi\nHershel Schachter of Yeshiva University, an expert on\nOrthodox Jewish law. Rabbi Schachter explained that the\neruv enables couples with young children and persons who\nuse wheelchairs to attend synagogue on the Sabbath. He\ndid not, however, suggest that the Orthodox Jews who affix\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n19. As we stated above, see supra note 15, it appears that until we\nrequested briefing on the issue the parties merely assumed that the\nlechis are protected by the First Amendment.\n\n                                21\n\n\nlechis intend to send any message thereby, or that the eruv\nconveys any message to Orthodox Jews.\n\nFurther, there is no evidence that Orthodox Jews receive\na message or ascertain the eruv’s boundaries by looking at\nthe lechis. To the contrary, Rabbi Howard Jachter, speaking\non behalf of the TEAI, said that \"most Orthodox Jews do\nnot . . . would not know how to make an eruv, wouldn’t see\nwhere the eruv is, how it is. A rabbi wouldn’t know how it\nis.\" Even plaintiff Chaim Book, who is obviously familiar\nwith the eruv’s boundaries and the lechis’ locations, said, \"I,\nwho know some of the poles have lechis, have a hard time\nrecognizing the lechi on the pole by just looking at it.\" In\naddition, plaintiffs’ complaint states that \"the eruv is not a\nreligious symbol.\" Thus there is no evidence contradicting\nthe Borough’s assertion at oral argument--which the\nplaintiffs did not dispute--that Orthodox Jews learn the\neruv’s boundaries by word of mouth from the persons\ncharged with erecting and inspecting it.\n\fEven if the plaintiffs had introduced evidence that the\nlechis serve a boundary function, that would be insufficient\nto prove they are \"sufficiently imbued with elements of\ncommunication to fall within the scope of the First and\nFourteenth Amendments.\" Troster, 65 F.3d at 1090\n(internal quotation marks omitted). All boundary lines\ndelineate the realms within which certain activities are or\nare not allowed. For instance, the invisible boundary\nbetween Nevada and Utah separates an area where\ngambling is legal from one where it is not. A homeowner’s\nfence demarcates where his neighbor’s garden must stop.\nThe walls of a synagogue delineate the space where\ncongregational worship takes place. But geographical\nboundary lines, fences, and walls are simply not protected\nexpression in the absence of evidence that some\"attitude\nor belief,\" Troster, 65 F.3d at 1091, is conveyed or received\nfrom them.

But there is no evidence that\nthe eruv is an example of such overlapping purposes,\nwhereas there was ample evidence to that effect in\nAllegheny. As part of a holiday display that stood at the\nentrance to a government building and included a 45-foot\nChristmas tree, the 18-foot menorah was both intended\nand understood to express \"a recognition that Christmas is\nnot the only traditional way of observing the winter-holiday\nseason\" and \"an acknowledgment of Chanukah as a\ncontemporaneous alternative tradition.\" Allegheny, 492 U.S.\nat 617-18.\n\nIn sharp contrast here, there is no evidence that\nOrthodox Jews intend or understand the eruv to\ncommunicate any idea or message.

To accept this\nposition would mean that whether conduct is expressive\ndepends entirely on how observers perceive it--even if the\nactor had no communicative intent, and even if the actor\ndisapproves of the message (or messages) discerned by the\nobservers. See Troster, 65 F.3d at 1092 (noting the\ndifference between an observer’s independent inference\nfrom an actor’s behavior and an observer’s receipt of a\n\n                                24\n\fnonverbal message intentionally sent by the actor); Peter\nMeijes Tiersma, Nonverbal Communication and the Freedom\nof \"Speech\", </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wis.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

Id. at 768 (\"The actual ‘activity’ at\nissue here is the circulation of newspapers, which is\nconstitutionally protected.\"). Unlike a newsrack, which\nfacilitates the paradigm of communication (the sale of\nnewspapers), there is no evidence that the eruv is\ninextricably linked to a communicative activity. Instead, the\nrecord shows that the eruv exists solely to designate the\nboundaries within which Orthodox Jews can engage in\ncertain activities on the Sabbath. Therefore, City of\nLakewood does not support the plaintiffs’ position that the\nnon-communicative act of delineating an area constitutes\nprotected expression.\n\nIn sum, as in Troster, the plaintiffs offer nothing more\nthan a \"bare assertion\" that their conduct is expressive.22\n65 F.3d at 1091 n.4.

I. Depending on\nthe nature of the challenged law or government action, a\nfree exercise claim can prompt either strict scrutiny or\nrational basis review.24\n\nIf a law is \"neutral\" and \"generally applicable,\" and\nburdens religious conduct only incidentally, the Free\nExercise Clause offers no protection. Employment Div. v.\nSmith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112404\"><a href=\"/opinion/112404/employment-div-dept-of-human-resources-of-ore-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">872</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 879 (1990).25 Smith held that the Free\nExercise Clause did not require a state to exempt the\ningestion of peyote during a Native American Church\nceremony from its neutral, generally applicable prohibition\non using that drug. Id. at 882. On the other hand, if the\nlaw is not neutral (i.e., if it discriminates against religiously\nmotivated conduct) or is not generally applicable (i.e., if it\nproscribes particular conduct only or primarily when\nreligiously motivated), strict scrutiny applies and the\nburden on religious conduct violates the Free Exercise\nClause unless it is narrowly tailored to advance a\ncompelling government interest.26Church of the Lukumi\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n24. To survive strict scrutiny, a challenged government action must be\nnarrowly tailored to advance a compelling government interest, whereas\nrational basis review requires merely that the action be rationally related\nto a legitimate government objective. As explained below, an intermediate\nlevel of scrutiny may apply in the public employment context.\n\n25. Smith involved a criminal law, but its rule also applies in the context\nof non-criminal laws and regulations. See Church of the Lukumi Babalu\nAye, Inc. v.

Accordingly, in situations\nwhere government officials exercise discretion in applying a\nfacially neutral law, so that whether they enforce the law\ndepends on their evaluation of the reasons underlying a\nviolator’s conduct, they contravene the neutrality\nrequirement if they exempt some secularly motivated\nconduct but not comparable religiously motivated conduct.\nSee Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 537; Smith, 494 U.S. at 884;\nBowen v. Roy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111688\"><a href=\"/opinion/111688/bowen-v-roy/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">693</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 708 (1986) (plurality opinion);\nFraternal Order of Police, 170 F.3d at 364-65. Thus in\n\fLukumi the Supreme Court invalidated an ordinance\n\"punishing ‘[w]hoever . . . unnecessarily . . . kills any\nanimal,’ \" where state and local officials interpreted the\nordinance to ban animal sacrifices during Santeria religious\nceremonies, but to exempt secular activities such as\nhunting, slaughtering animals for food, and even using live\nrabbits to train greyhounds. 508 U.S. at 537 (alteration in\noriginal).

Therefore, strict\nscrutiny applied, and the ordinance failed that test because\nits \"proffered objectives [were] not pursued with respect to\nanalogous non-religious conduct.\" Id. at 546.\n\nBecause the ordinance in Lukumi gave officials discretion\nto consider \"the particular justification\" for each violation,\nit \"represent[ed] a system of ‘individualized governmental\nassessment of the reasons for the relevant conduct,’ \"\ntriggering under Smith strict scrutiny of the ordinance’s\napplication to religiously motivated conduct. Id. at 537\n(quoting Smith, 494 U.S. at 884).

Selective enforcement of this nature, we\nsaid, exemplified the Supreme Court’s concern in Smith and\nLukumi about \"the prospect of the government’s deciding\nthat secular motivations are more important than religious\nmotivations.\" Id. at 365. It showed that the police\ndepartment \"made a value judgment that secular (i.e.,\nmedical) motivations for wearing a beard are important\nenough to overcome its general interest in uniformity but\nthat religious motivations are not.\" Id. at 366. Therefore,\nthe enforcement of the policy against the Sunni Muslim\nofficers was \"sufficiently suggestive of discriminatory intent\n. . . to trigger heightened scrutiny under Smith and Lukumi.\"27\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n27. Smith and Lukumi state unambiguously that strict scrutiny applies\nwhen government discriminates against religiously motivated conduct.\nSee Smith, 494 U.S. at 884; Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 546. However, our\ndecision in Fraternal Order of Police applied only \"heightened\" or\n\"intermediate\" scrutiny, under which the challenged government action\nmust be substantially related (rather than narrowly tailored) to\npromoting an important (rather than compelling) government interest.\nWe did so because First Amendment rights are limited in the public\nemployment context by a government’s need to function efficiently.

On its\nface, Ordinance 691 is neutral and generally applicable.\nBut \"[o]fficial action that targets religious conduct for\ndistinctive treatment cannot be shielded [from\nconstitutional attack] by mere compliance with the\nrequirement of facial neutrality.\" Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 534.\nWe must look beyond the text of the ordinance and\nexamine whether the Borough enforces it on a religion-\nneutral basis, as \"the effect of a law in its real operation is\nstrong evidence of its object.\" Id. at 535.\n\nBecause Ordinance 691 is neutral and generally\napplicable on its face, if the Borough had enforced it\nuniformly, Smith would control and the plaintiffs’ claim\nwould accordingly fail. The Borough insists it has done so,\nbut the record shows otherwise. Indeed, the Borough has\ntacitly or expressly granted exemptions from the\nordinance’s unyielding language for various secular and\nreligious--though never Orthodox Jewish--purposes. Cf.\nFowler v. Rhode Island, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105093\"><a href=\"/opinion/105093/fowler-v-rhode-island/\"><span class=\"volume\">345</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 69 (1953) (holding\nthat city violated Free Exercise Clause by enforcing\nordinance banning meetings in park against Jehovah’s\nWitnesses but exempting other religious groups).\n\nFrom the drab house numbers and lost animal signs to\nthe more obtrusive holiday displays, church directional\nsigns, and orange ribbons--the last of which the District\nCourt erroneously deemed irrelevant to the constitutional\nanalysis28--the Borough has allowed private citizens to affix\n_________________________________________________________________\n\f28. Pursuant to our \"constitutional duty to conduct an independent\nexamination of the record as a whole,\" Hurley , 515 U.S. at 567, we\nbelieve there is ample evidence in the record showing that orange\nribbons were attached to the Borough’s utility poles for \"a lengthy period\nof time\" and that Borough officials knew about them but made no effort\nto remove them.

Apart from their\nreligious nature, the lechis are comparable to the postings\nthe Borough has left in place. If anything, the lechis are\nless of a problem because they are so unobtrusive; even\nobservant Jews are often unable to distinguish them from\nordinary utility wires. While the Borough alleges that the\nlechis are different because the plaintiffs intend them to be\n\"permanent,\" house numbers nailed to utility poles are\nlikewise intended to be permanent. And although the\nBorough insists that the lechis’ religious nature justifies its\ndecision to remove them, this is precisely the sort of\nreasoning that Lukumi and Fraternal Order of Police forbid.\n\nWe believe that the Borough’s selective, discretionary\napplication of Ordinance 691 against the lechis violates the\nneutrality principle of Lukumi and Fraternal Order of Police\nbecause it \"devalues\" Orthodox Jewish reasons for posting\nitems on utility poles by \"judging them to be of lesser\nimport than nonreligious reasons,\" and thus \"single[s] out\"\nthe plaintiffs’ religiously motivated conduct for\ndiscriminatory treatment. Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 537;\nFraternal Order of Police, 170 F.3d at 364-65. 29 Just as the\nexemptions for secularly motivated killings in Lukumi\nindicated that the city was discriminating against Santeria\nanimal sacrifice, and just as the medical exemption in\nFraternal Order of Police indicated that the police\ndepartment was discriminating against religiously\nmotivated requests to grow beards, the Borough’s\ninvocation of the often-dormant Ordinance 691 against\nconduct motivated by Orthodox Jewish beliefs is\n\"sufficiently suggestive of discriminatory intent,\" Fraternal\nOrder of Police, 170 F.3d at 365, that we must apply strict\nscrutiny.

We note, however, that we reject the plaintiffs’ contention that the\nFree Exercise Clause bars the Borough from distinguishing between the\nlechis and the plastic-covered wires attached to utility poles by telephone\nand cable television companies. Because utility poles exist to facilitate\ntelecommunications, utility wires are obviously unlike any of the other\nmaterials the Borough has allowed people to affix to the poles.\n\n30.

See\nsupra note 27.\n\nWe note that, in determining the appropriate standard to apply, we do\nnot believe it necessary to consider the subjective motivations of the\nCouncil members who voted to remove the eruv. Lukumi and Fraternal\nOrder of Police inferred discriminatory purpose from the objective effects\nof the selective exemptions at issue without examining the responsible\nofficials’ motives. See Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 537-38; Fraternal Order of\nPolice, 170 F.3d at 364-66; see also Laurence H. Tribe, American\nConstitutional Law S 5-16, at 956 (3d ed. 2000) (\"Under Smith, a law that\nis not neutral or that is not generally applicable can violate the Free\nExercise Clause without regard to the motives of those who enacted the\nmeasure.\"). Likewise, the objective effects of the Borough’s enforcement\nof Ordinance 691 are sufficient for us to conclude that it is not being\napplied neutrally against the eruv.\n\n                                31\n\n\nwritten in terms of what the government cannot do to the\nindividual, not in terms of what the individual can exact\nfrom the government.\"’ Northwest Indian Cemetery, 485\nU.S. at 451 (1988) (quoting Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 412\n(Douglas, J., concurring)); Roy, 476 U.S. at 700.\n\nContrary to the Borough’s position, however, the\nprinciple of Lukumi and Fraternal Order of Police--that\ngovernment cannot discriminate between religiously\nmotivated conduct and comparable secularly motivated\n\fconduct in a manner that devalues religious reasons for\nacting--applies not only when a coercive law or regulation\nprohibits religious conduct, but also when government\ndenies religious adherents access to publicly available\nmoney or property.

Application of strict scrutiny\n\nBecause the Borough’s decision to remove the eruv is not\nneutral toward conduct motivated by Orthodox Jewish\nbeliefs, it \"must undergo the most rigorous of scrutiny.\"\nLukumi, 508 U.S. at 546. To be permissible under the Free\nExercise Clause, it \"must advance interests of the highest\norder and must be narrowly tailored in pursuit of those\ninterests.\" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nBorough attempts to justify its decision to remove the eruv,\nand distinguish the lechis from the violations of Ordinance\n\f691 it has tolerated, on the grounds that the lechis are\n\"permanent\" and religious in nature. Neither ground is\npersuasive.\n\nMuch of our strict scrutiny analysis parallels our earlier\ndiscussion of why the Borough’s decision is not religion-\nneutral. See Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 546-47 (stating that lack\nof neutrality eviscerates contention that restriction is\nnarrowly tailored to advance compelling interest). First, for\nmany years--and, the record shows, after the plaintiffs\nsued--the Borough has allowed its residents to nail house\nnumbers to utility poles. Because the Borough has\ntolerated equally permanent house numbers, it hardly has\na compelling interest in refusing to allow the inconspicuous\nlechis on the ground that they are permanent. Further, it is\nhard to see how the allegedly permanent nature of the\nunobtrusive lechis somehow undermines Ordinance 691’s\nobjective of avoiding visual clutter and maintaining control\nover municipal property more than items like bright orange\nribbons and lost animal signs. Moreover, even if the\nBorough had a compelling interest in preventing permanent\nfixtures on its utility poles, its decision to remove the eruv\nwhile allowing the house numbers is not narrowly tailored\nto promote that interest.\n\nThough the Borough’s claim that it can remove the eruv\nbecause of its religious nature requires more discussion, it\nis similarly unpersuasive. The Borough maintains that its\ndecision to remove the eruv is justified by its \"compelling\"\ninterest in avoiding \"an Establishment Clause controversy.\"\nContrary to the Borough’s position, however, a government\ninterest in imposing greater separation of church and state\nthan the federal Establishment Clause mandates is not\n\n                                37\n\n\ncompelling in the First Amendment context. See Widmar,\n454 U.S. at 276 (rejecting state university’s contention that\nits interest in complying with the state constitution’s\nprohibition on religious establishments, which was more\nrestrictive than its federal counterpart, justified\ndiscriminating against religious speech, and explaining that\n\"the state interest asserted here--in achieving greater\nseparation of church and State than is already ensured\nunder the Establishment Clause of the Federal Constitution\n--is limited by the Free Exercise Clause and in this case by\nthe Free Speech Clause as well\")33 Davey, 299 F.3d at 759\n(same in context of free exercise claim).\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n33.

When presented with Establishment Clause claims in the context of\npublic education, the Supreme Court considers not only whether a\nreasonable, informed observer would perceive an endorsement of\nreligion, but also whether the challenged government practice coerces\nstudents into participating in religious activity.

Seven Justices in Capitol Square agreed that the reasoning of Lamb’s\nChapel controlled, Capitol Square, 515 U.S. at 762, three of these seven\nexpressly applied the reasonable, informed observer test, see id. at 772\n(O’Connor, J., joined by Souter & Breyer, JJ.), and the two dissenting\nJustices also applied the endorsement test, see id. at 797-98 (Stevens,\nJ., dissenting); id. at 817-18 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). Four Justices,\nhowever, recognized that the endorsement test controls when\ngovernment discriminates in favor of religion, but argued that there is no\nneed to apply the test to \"purely private\" religious expression that occurs\nin a public forum \"open to all on equal terms\" because such expression\ncan never violate the Establishment Clause. Id. at 770 (opinion of Scalia,\nJ.). Notwithstanding the Justices’ divergent approaches, subsequent\nSupreme Court decisions treat the reasonable, informed observer test\ndiscussed at length in Justice O’Connor’s opinion as representing Capitol\nSquare’s holding with respect to the appropriate Establishment Clause\ntest.

Thus the\nreasonable, informed observer would know that the lechis\nare items with religious significance and that they enable\nOrthodox Jews to engage in activities otherwise off limits on\nthe Sabbath, but would also know that the Borough was\nallowing them to remain on the utility poles only because\nits selective application of Ordinance 691 renders removing\nthe lechis a free exercise violation.

See Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at\n841. No reasonable, informed observer would perceive the\ndecision of the plaintiffs to affix lechis to utility poles owned\nby Verizon and to do so with Cablevision’s assistance as \" ‘a\nchoice attributable to the State.’ \" Santa Fe Indep., 530 U.S.\n\fat 311 (quoting Lee, 505 U.S. at 587). Similarly, because\nthe eruv is maintained solely with private funds, and\nbecause allowing the lechis to remain in place would\nrepresent neutral rather than preferential treatment of\nreligiously motivated conduct, no reasonable, informed\nobserver would believe the Borough is \"affirmatively\nsponsor[ing]\" an Orthodox Jewish practice. Santa Fe Indep.,\n530 U.S. at 313.\n\nTo the extent that access to the utility poles on Borough\nland constitutes a \"benefit,\" \"the ‘guarantee of neutrality is\nrespected, not offended\"’ when religious persons benefit\nincidentally from \"‘neutral criteria and evenhanded\npolicies.\"’ Good News Club, 533 U.S. at 114 (quoting\nRosenberger, 515 U.S. at 839). In this context, there is \"no\nrealistic danger\" that, if the Borough treated the plaintiffs’\nreligiously motivated conduct on religion-neutral terms,\nreasonable, informed observers would perceive an\nendorsement of Orthodox Judaism. Lamb’s Chapel , 508\n\n                                44\n\n\nU.S. at 395. Moreover, even if there is some slight risk that\na reasonable, informed observer might \"misperceive the\nendorsement of religion,\" there is a much greater risk that\nthe observer would perceive hostility toward Orthodox Jews\nif the Borough removes the lechis. Good News Club, 533\nU.S. at 118; Mergens, 496 U.S. at 248; see also\nRosenberger, 515 U.S. at 846 (O’Connor, J., concurring)\n(\"Withholding access would leave an impermissible\nperception that religious activities are disfavored.\").41\n\nBecause the Free Exercise Clause requires neutral\ntreatment of religion, see Smith, 494 U.S. at 879, only in a\nmost unusual case could compliance with free exercise\nnorms offend the Establishment Clause. Cf. Kiryas Joel\nVillage Sch.

Allowing the eruv\nto remain in place serves the secular purpose of complying with the Free\nExercise Clause, does not have the effect of advancing religion because\nno reasonable, informed observer would perceive an endorsement of\nreligion, and involves no government entanglement with religion because\nthe Borough will not monitor or support the maintenance of the eruv.\n\n                                45\n\n\nOur review of the record leaves us convinced that, in\naddition to the reasonable probability that the plaintiffs will\nultimately prevail on their free exercise claim, the\nremaining three factors for injunctive relief--irreparable\ninjury, the balance of hardships, and the public interest--\nalso favor a preliminary injunction.

Burns,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109517\"><a href=\"/opinion/109517/elrod-v-burns/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 373 (1976)). The plaintiffs have demonstrated\nthat, if the eruv is removed, they will be unable to push and\ncarry objects outside the home on the Sabbath, and those\nwho are disabled or have small children consequently will\nbe unable to attend synagogue. This showing easily\nsatisfies the irreparable injury requirement.\n\nWith respect to the balance of hardships, a preliminary\ninjunction would not harm the Borough more than denying\nrelief would harm the plaintiffs. Enjoining removal of the\neruv would cause neither the Borough nor its residents any\nserious injury. Without an injunction, on the other hand,\nthe plaintiffs’ free exercise of religion will be impaired. The\nbalance easily tips in the plaintiffs’ favor.\n\nFinally, where there are no societal benefits justifying a\nburden on religious freedom, \"the public interest clearly\nfavors the protection of constitutional rights.\" Council of\nAlternative Political Parties v. Hooks, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">876</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 884 (3d\nCir. 1997). We do not see how removing the lechis could\nadvance any interests sufficient to outweigh the\ninfringement of the plaintiffs’ free exercise rights.\n\nIn this context, the District Court should have\npreliminarily enjoined the Borough from removing the lechis\npending a trial.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nThough the plaintiffs are not likely to prevail on their Fair\nHousing Act claim and do not present a viable free speech\n\n                                46\n\fclaim, they are reasonably likely to show that the Borough\nviolated the Free Exercise Clause by applying Ordinance\n691 selectively against conduct motivated by Orthodox\nJewish beliefs. Because the three other factors for\ninjunctive relief also favor the plaintiffs, we reverse the\nDistrict Court’s denial of injunctive relief and will enter an\norder directing the Court to issue a preliminary injunction\nbarring the Borough from removing the lechis.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                                47\n\f</pre>",
