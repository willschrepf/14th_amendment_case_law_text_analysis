AP-76,703\n\n\n                                      JAIME PIERO COLE, Appellant\n\n                                                           v.\n\n                                           THE STATE OF TEXAS\n\n                         ON DIRECT APPEAL FROM CAUSE NO. 1250754\n                           IN THE 230TH JUDICIAL DISTRICT COURT\n                                      HARRIS COUNTY\n\n\n       JOHNSON , J., delivered the opinion of the unanimous Court.\n\n                                                   OPINION\n\n       In October 2011, a jury convicted appellant of capital murder for the shooting deaths of his\n\nwife and step-daughter during the same criminal transaction. TEX . PENAL CODE ANN . § 19.03(a)(7).\n\nPursuant to the jury’s answers to the special issues set forth in Texas Code of Criminal Procedure\n\nArticle 37.071, sections 2(b) and 2(e), the trial judge sentenced appellant to death. Art. 37.071 §\n\n2(g).1 Direct appeal to this Court is automatic. Art. 37.071 § 2(h). Appellant raises seventeen points\n\nof error.     After reviewing appellant’s points of error, we find them to be without merit.\n\n\n       1\n            Unless otherwise indicated, all future references to Articles refer to the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n\f                                                                                                        2\n\nConsequently, we affirm the trial court’s judgment and sentence of death.\n\n                      Sufficiency of the Evidence—Future Dangerousness\n\n        In point of error ten, appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury’s\n\naffirmative answer to the future-dangerousness special issue. Art. 37.071, § 2(b)(1). We shall\n\naddress this issue first, followed by the remaining points of error in the order presented in the briefs.\n\n        The future-dangerousness special issue requires the jury to determine “whether there is a\n\nprobability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a\n\ncontinuing threat to society.” Art. 37.071, § 2(b)(1). When reviewing the legal sufficiency of the\n\nevidence supporting an affirmative answer to the future-dangerousness special issue, we review the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to the verdict. Williams v. State, 273 S.W.3d 200, 213 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2008); see Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979). Assessing the evidence and\n\nall reasonable inferences therefrom in this light, we determine whether any rational trier of fact could\n\nhave believed beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a probability the defendant would commit\n\ncriminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society. Williams, 273 S.W.3d\n\nat 213; Alvarado v. State, 912 S.W.2d 199, 209 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995).\n\n        In deciding this special issue, the jury is entitled to consider all of the evidence admitted at\n\nboth the guilt and punishment phases of trial. Devoe v. State, 354 S.W.3d 457, 461 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2011). The jury may also consider a variety of factors, including: (1) the circumstances of the\n\ncapital offense, including the defendant’s state of mind and whether he was working alone or with\n\nother parties; (2) the calculated nature of the defendant’s acts; (3) the forethought and deliberateness\n\nexhibited by the crime’s execution; (4) the existence of a prior criminal record; (5) the defendant’s\n\nage and personal circumstances at the time of the offense; (6) whether the defendant was acting\n\f                                                                                                                   3\n\nunder duress or the domination of another when he committed the crime; (7) psychiatric evidence;\n\nand (8) character evidence. Keeton v. State, 724 S.W.2d 58, 61 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987). The\n\ncircumstances of the offense and the events surrounding it may be sufficient in themselves to sustain\n\nan affirmative answer to the future-dangerousness special issue. Devoe, 354 S.W.3d at 462; Hayes\n\nv. State, 85 S.W.3d 809, 814 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002). An escalating pattern of violence or disrespect\n\nfor the law may also support a finding of future dangerousness.2 A lack of remorse or evidence that\n\na defendant planned to kill again may likewise support a finding of future dangerousness.3 The\n\nfuture-dangerousness special issue focuses upon the character and internal restraints of the particular\n\nindividual, rather than the external institutional restraints of incarceration. Coble v. State, 330\n\nS.W.3d 253, 268 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010). With these principles in mind, we turn to the evidence\n\nplaced before the jury at both phases of appellant’s capital murder trial.\n\n        At the guilt phase, the state presented evidence that appellant committed the instant offense\n\nshortly after 8:00 p.m. on February 4, 2010. Appellant and his wife, Melissa Cole, had been\n\nexperiencing marital strife in the weeks preceding the killings. About a month before the shootings,\n\nMelissa moved herself, the couple’s two young sons (Piero, age ten, and Lucas, age two) and her\n\ndaughter from a prior relationship (Alecia “Desirae” Castillo, age fifteen) from the family home into\n\na small apartment.\n\n        Following the move, Piero and Lucas continued to have contact with appellant, spending two\n\ndays a week with him. The boys had been staying with appellant for the two days immediately\n\n\n        2\n          Swain v. State, 181 S.W .3d 359, 370 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005); King v. State, 953 S.W .2d 266, 271 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 1997).\n\n        3\n          Smith v. State, 74 S.W .3d 868, 872 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002); Rachal v. State, 917 S.W .2d 799, 806 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 1996).\n\f                                                                                                                      4\n\npreceding the killings. Piero testified that appellant seemed normal during this time and that he did\n\nnot see appellant consume any alcohol.4 Shortly before returning the boys to Melissa that evening,\n\nappellant took them out to eat. During the meal, appellant drank two beers. Appellant, who had\n\npurchased a .22-caliber semi-automatic pistol the previous afternoon, told Piero during the meal that\n\nif appellant or Melissa died, Piero should live with appellant’s biological sister in Ecuador.5\n\n         When returning the boys after their visits, appellant usually called Melissa from the\n\napartment complex’s parking lot to inform her that the children were back, but he did not enter the\n\napartment. On the evening of the murders, however, appellant parked his truck and went inside with\n\nthe boys. Desirae and Melissa were in the apartment. Chloe Mahalec, Melissa’s nine-year-old niece\n\nwho often visited the family, was also present.\n\n         Appellant and Melissa began arguing in Melissa’s bedroom. After Desirae complained about\n\nthe noise, appellant and Melissa went outside. The children remained inside the apartment. As the\n\nadults’ argument grew louder, Desirae pounded on the inside of the front door several times, telling\n\nappellant and Melissa to be quiet. When Melissa began to scream, “Help me, help me,” in fear,\n\nDesirae opened the front door, again telling appellant and Melissa to be quiet. Desirae and Chloe\n\nsaw appellant shooting Melissa, who collapsed in the front doorway. Appellant continued firing at\n\nMelissa when she was on the ground.\n\n         Chloe ran to the kitchen to hide from appellant. Lucas stayed where he was, sitting on the\n\nfloor between the hall and entry to the kitchen, crying. Desirae fled to the back bedroom. Piero hid\n\n\n         4\n           At trial, appellant argued that alcohol use played a central role in the offense, as well as in his past\nnegative behavior.\n\n         5\n          The record shows that appellant was born in Ecuador. W hen he was roughly ten years old, Hazel and Jim\nCole adopted him and brought him to the United States.\n\f                                                                                                                      5\n\nin the bathroom attached to the same bedroom. From inside the bathroom, Piero heard four or five\n\n“clicks” from the bedroom, and from her hiding spot in the kitchen, Chloe twice heard Piero yell,\n\n“No.” When Piero opened the bathroom door, he saw Desirae lying on the bedroom floor on her\n\nside. Appellant was in the bedroom, holding a pistol and retrieving shell casings.6 Without looking\n\nat or speaking to Piero, appellant removed the magazine from the pistol, pocketed it, and ran out of\n\nthe bedroom, still holding the pistol. Appellant pointed the pistol at Chloe, but it only went “click-\n\nclick” instead of “boom-boom.”\n\n         Piero ran for help, but both Melissa and Desirae died at the scene. Two-year-old Lucas,\n\nmeanwhile, followed appellant to the parking lot. Appellant put Lucas in the front seat of his truck.\n\nWithout restraining the child, appellant drove through the apartment complex at high speed and\n\nrammed his truck through the automatic gate without waiting for it to fully open. Appellant went\n\nto his workplace, where he took $1,400 in cash from the safe and looked unsuccessfully for a vehicle\n\nto exchange for his truck. Appellant then headed south on U.S. Highway 59, a major corridor\n\nbetween Houston and Mexico.\n\n         That same evening, Sgt. Chappell issued an “Amber Alert” for Lucas. Jose Mena, the Texas\n\nDepartment of Public Safety (DPS) trooper who responded to the alert, apprehended appellant at\n\napproximately 11:00 p.m. inside a Wharton County Walmart. Appellant, who had Lucas with him\n\ninside the store, had just purchased 100 rounds of .22 caliber ammunition, as well as diapers and\n\nsome food items. Because he had heard that appellant had shot and killed two people, Trooper Mena\n\napproached appellant from behind, with his service weapon drawn, as appellant was leaving the\n\n\n\n        6\n           Although investigators recovered a total of seven spent shell casings from the crime scene, they did not\nrecover any from the back bedroom where appellant shot Desirae.\n\f                                                                                                                    6\n\nstore. When Trooper Mena seized appellant and instructed him not to move, a bystander removed\n\nLucas from appellant’s shopping cart and took him inside the store. Appellant was arrested without\n\nfurther incident.\n\n         In appellant’s truck, investigators found a large hunting knife inserted between the driver’s\n\nseat and center console. Underneath the console, with the magazine inserted, they found appellant’s\n\n.22 semi-automatic pistol. The magazine was empty, and no bullet was in the chamber. On the\n\npassenger-side floorboard, investigators found a loaded shotgun and four bags containing the cash\n\nfrom appellant’s employer.\n\n         The state’s firearm examiner, Joseph Colca, testified that the magazine had a ten-cartridge\n\ncapacity; with a bullet chambered, plus a full magazine, the weapon’s total firing capacity without\n\nreloading was eleven rounds.7 He also told the jury about the multiple safety features that appellant\n\nhad to override to fire the weapon.\n\n         Following his arrest, appellant was taken before a magistrate in Wharton County and\n\ninformed of his constitutional rights. Before being transported to Harris County, appellant gave a\n\nvideotaped statement to Houston Police Department (HPD) Sergeants Robert Chappell and William\n\nBush, both of whom testified that appellant’s general demeanor while in Wharton County was\n\n“angry” and that he did not appear intoxicated. The trial court admitted part of the Wharton County\n\nstatement as State’s Exhibit 8A, which was published to the jury. In that statement, appellant\n\nasserted that the shootings were “not planned,” but also asserted that the “kids weren’t supposed to\n\nsee.” Appellant also stated that, if things had gone right, he would have been dead already because\n\n\n\n        7\n           The autopsies revealed that appellant shot Melissa and Desirae eleven times, expending the entire clip\nplus a chambered round.\n\f                                                                                                   7\n\nhe had wanted the police to catch him or shoot him. Appellant said that he would have killed\n\nhimself, but he had no bullets.\n\n       In Harris County, appellant gave a second videotaped statement to HPD Officer Xavier Avila,\n\nwhich was admitted into evidence as State’s Exhibit 9 and published to the jury. Appellant stated\n\nthat he and Melissa were fighting over money and whether the marriage had any chance of\n\ncontinuing. Appellant hoped for a legal separation, but Melissa wanted a divorce. Appellant\n\nasserted that Melissa was complaining that she was “broke,” although he had been depositing money\n\nfor her into an account ever since she moved out. Appellant also stated that Melissa was impatient\n\nbecause he had not yet obtained their tax refund, which she wanted to use to pay for a divorce. They\n\nargued, and he started crying because Melissa would not agree to a separation rather than a divorce.\n\nDesirae came to the door of the bedroom, telling them that they were being too loud, so they went\n\noutside.\n\n       Appellant said that he had the pistol with him in his waistband and had been carrying it for\n\nthe last couple of days for protection and because it helped him sleep. When Melissa said that she\n\ndid not want to again discuss the possibility of a separation, appellant pulled the pistol from his\n\nwaistband, cocked it, and shot her from a very short distance. Appellant asserted that he did not\n\nknow how many times he shot Melissa. After Melissa collapsed, appellant stepped over her, went\n\nto the back bedroom, and shot Desirae, who had been in the background “screaming at [him]” while\n\nhe shot Melissa. Appellant asserted that he had not planned any of the violence. Appellant stated\n\nthat he shot his wife because he was “angry and frustrated about the way everything was going.”\n\nRegarding Desirae, appellant claimed that he shot her in a moment of anger. When he shot Desirae,\n\nappellant was aware that Chloe was in the adjacent kitchen and that Piero was somewhere in the\n\f                                                                                                      8\n\nsame bedroom.\n\n        The autopsies revealed that Melissa had been shot nine times: once in the head, six times\n\nin the chest and abdomen, and twice in her right arm. The shot to her head and a contact-shot to her\n\nabdomen were immediately life-threatening. Three of the remaining wounds to her chest and\n\nabdomen were potentially fatal. The wounds to her arm were inflicted at very close range and were\n\nconsistent with pushing the barrel of the gun away. At least six of the bullets traveled in a downward\n\ntrajectory through her body, consistent with testimony that appellant continued to fire at Melissa after\n\nshe had fallen to the ground. Desirae sustained two gunshot wounds to the torso, either one of which\n\ncould have been the cause of death. Both bullets traveled in a downward trajectory, consistent with\n\nappellant firing at Desirae from above.\n\n        At the punishment phase, the jury heard evidence concerning appellant’s interactions with\n\nfemale intimate partners, family members, friends, coworkers, and strangers. It additionally heard\n\nevidence regarding appellant’s criminal history before and after the instant offense, as well as\n\nevidence concerning his prior bad acts and character.\n\n        Leticia Leal testified that she and appellant dated off and on through high school and for a\n\nfew years beyond graduation. Leal recalled that the relationship was good at first, but deteriorated\n\nover time. In the spring of 1989, after graduation, appellant and Leal were dating other people but\n\ntrying to remain friends. Appellant entered the K-Mart store where Leal was working and said hello\n\nwhen he saw her. The encounter was initially friendly, but Leal indicated that she could not continue\n\ntalking because she was working. Appellant, however, did not leave. Appellant saw that Leal had\n\na hickey on her neck, became upset, and wanted to discuss it. Leal repeated that she could not talk\n\nto him then and headed to the store’s back warehouse. Appellant followed Leal into the warehouse\n\f                                                                                                      9\n\narea, pushed her against a wall, and grabbed her by the neck. Appellant did not release Leal until\n\nher coworker intervened and told appellant to leave. Leal, who had at first been shocked and then\n\nfrightened by the assault, left work after the incident.\n\n        Either the same night or the next day, appellant drove to the home where Leal lived with her\n\nparents and sisters. Leal stayed inside while one of her sisters called the police. Another sister, Ann,\n\nwho was pregnant, went outside. Appellant, who had a handgun, grabbed Ann. Leal’s father and\n\nbrother-in-law tackled appellant, took the weapon away, and told appellant to leave. Leal made a\n\npolice report, but appellant’s mother, Hazel Cole, convinced her not to pursue charges.\n\n        Collete Rives testified that she met appellant in 1988 when they were both high school\n\nseniors and working at the same place. After a few months, they began dating. Like Leal, Rives\n\ntestified that the relationship with appellant was initially good. After about five months of dating,\n\nshe became pregnant by appellant. Rives and appellant were not dating when she subsequently\n\nlearned of the pregnancy and informed appellant. Appellant told Rives that “he would pay for it but\n\nnot claim [the child].” Appellant was not present when his daughter, Brittnie, was born in April\n\n1990, did not provide child support until ordered by a court to do so, and did not spend much time\n\nwith Brittnie, even after appellant and Rives reconciled in April or May 1992. When Rives became\n\npregnant again in June 1992, appellant insisted that Rives terminate the pregnancy.\n\n        Appellant and Rives split again, but had reconciled by late July or early August 1993 when\n\nRives learned that she was pregnant by appellant with their son, James. This time, appellant\n\npromised to stay with Rives. In September 1993, when Rives’s pregnancy was two months along,\n\nthey spent the evening at the bar run by appellant’s mother, Hazel. They then went to Hazel’s house,\n\nwhere they were spending the night. Rives and appellant argued. Rives did not take any physical\n\f                                                                                                 10\n\naction against appellant. Appellant, however, who knew Rives was pregnant, suddenly punched her\n\nhard in the stomach. The blow hurt, and Rives lay down on the bed and began to cry. Besides being\n\nin pain, Rives was very concerned about the unborn baby. After hitting her, appellant lay down on\n\nthe bed and went to sleep, although he apologized the next day.\n\n       Rives stayed in a relationship with appellant until they broke up again a few days before\n\nNovember 24, 1993. At that date, Rives was about four-and-a-half months along and visibly\n\npregnant. Carl Freeman was appellant’s longtime friend and neighbor. While dating appellant, Rives\n\nhad frequently spent time with Freeman and his girlfriend. On November 24, Rives visited Freeman\n\nand his girlfriend at Freeman’s house. Appellant knocked at the front door, asking to talk to Rives.\n\nWhen Rives went to the door, appellant asked her about a diamond ring that he had given her,\n\nwanting it back. When Rives said that she did not have the ring with her, appellant grabbed her arm\n\nand forced her outside. He took Rives over to his Chevy Blazer, which was parked in Freeman’s\n\ndriveway, and bent her on her back over the hood. Appellant put his left hand across Rives’s chest\n\nto hold her down, reached for a shotgun with his right hand, and held it to Rives’s forehead. Rives\n\nstruggled with appellant and cried for help. Appellant did not say anything, but just looked angry.\n\nRives feared that appellant was going to shoot her. They struggled over the shotgun until appellant\n\nput the weapon down and swung Rives forcefully across the yard. Appellant then came over to\n\nwhere Rives landed and kicked her repeatedly in the stomach.\n\n       Freeman testified that he came running from the house in response to Rives’s cries. He\n\nknocked appellant down when appellant was kicking Rives, and he yelled for Rives to get to the\n\nhouse and call 9-1-1. Freeman saw Rives enter the house. When Freeman turned back to appellant,\n\nappellant was pointing a 12-gauge shotgun at him. Freeman told appellant that if appellant was\n\f                                                                                                                  11\n\ngoing to shoot him, appellant would have to shoot him in the back. Freeman turned around and\n\nquickly walked back to the house. Freeman heard a shot behind him and was terrified.8 Freeman\n\nand Rives waited inside the house until several police cruisers arrived. Rives and Freeman both gave\n\nstatements to the police. Rives received medical treatment and was released after a determination\n\nthat the baby was unharmed.\n\n         Appellant was arrested and indicted for two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly\n\nweapon. But Rives reconciled with appellant, and he persuaded her to sign “a piece of paper” so that\n\nhe would not go to jail. Appellant told Rives that if he were in jail, he could not help her with the\n\nchildren. Appellant also apologized and promised that he would not ever do it again. Rives testified\n\nthat she did not knowingly agree to drop the charges against appellant; by signing the document, she\n\nthought that she was merely agreeing that he should not go to jail. Rives believed at the time that\n\nappellant should be punished in some way for what he had done, but she did not want that\n\npunishment to include jail time.\n\n         Freeman testified that Hazel called him within one week of the incident. Following the\n\nconversation with Hazel, Freeman called the police department and asked to drop the charges against\n\nappellant. The charges against appellant were reduced from aggravated assault with a deadly weapon\n\nto the offense of terroristic threat. Appellant pleaded guilty to the reduced charge on August 26,\n\n1994.\n\n         Rives testified that no physical abuse occurred between the incident at Freeman’s house and\n\n\n        8\n            Thomas Tolson was the first patrol officer to arrive at the scene. Tolson testified that Rives, who was\npregnant, was upset and crying, holding her side, and had visible scratches on her arm; Freeman was also upset and\nagitated. Tolson further testified that a spent shotgun shell for a 12-gauge shotgun was recovered from the scene.\nHe stated that the shell would have had to have been actively “racked” in the shotgun before being fired, implying\nthat the shotgun did not discharge accidentally.\n\f                                                                                                     12\n\nthe birth of James in April 1994. But in November 1994, appellant and Rives traveled to Ecuador\n\nfor her to meet his biological family. A physical incident occurred there after Rives and appellant\n\nspent the evening at a bar. Rives testified that, although she and appellant both drank alcohol that\n\nevening, she was not drunk. She could not say whether appellant was intoxicated. After returning\n\nto their sleeping quarters at appellant’s aunt’s house, appellant became very angry and hit Rives\n\ntwice in the stomach. Although the blows hurt and she was very upset, Rives lay down on the bed\n\nbecause she had nowhere to go if she left the premises. Appellant stayed in the room and did not say\n\nanything. The next morning, he apologized.\n\n        Appellant hurt Rives again in March 1995, when Rives and Hazel threw a small surprise\n\nparty for him at Hazel’s bar. Appellant initially seemed happy at the party, but matters changed\n\nwhen a physical altercation developed between two patrons. Appellant moved outside with the\n\ncombatants and stood next to them, talking to them. Hazel asked Rives to get appellant away from\n\nthe place, and Rives yelled at appellant, “Let’s go.” Eventually, appellant joined Rives at her car.\n\nRives was standing outside the car on the passenger side, facing outward, with the door open.\n\nAppellant grabbed Rives by the arm, told her never to yell at him like that in front of his friends, and\n\npushed her backward. After Rives fell back into the seat with her feet still on the ground, appellant\n\nslammed the car door across her legs. Rives testified that having the door slammed against her legs\n\nhurt and that she still bore an indentation in one leg from the incident. Afterward, Rives told\n\nappellant that he needed help and if he ever hit her again, she would leave him. Rives testified that\n\nappellant went to counseling, but she did not know for how long.\n\n        Appellant hit Rives again six months later, in September 1995, when the two traveled to San\n\nFrancisco on a business trip. On the first night there, appellant became drunk and punched Rives\n\f                                                                                                  13\n\nin the stomach several times when she would not have sexual intercourse with him. Although the\n\npunches hurt and she was scared, Rives did not leave because appellant took her plane ticket and\n\nmoney. When they returned to Houston, Rives ended the relationship.\n\n       Rives testified that when appellant was physically abusive he would also be verbally abusive.\n\nFor example, he would tell Rives that no one would want her because she had two children and was\n\nnot married. Rives also testified that appellant’s violence was not just directed at her. She and\n\nappellant went to Hazel’s bar frequently, and while there, Rives saw appellant engage in more than\n\none bar fight. The fights ensued when appellant felt that someone had disrespected him. Rives\n\ntestified that appellant would react to perceived disrespect by getting angry.\n\n       The state presented additional evidence concerning appellant’s participation in fights through\n\nthe testimony of two police officers who arrested appellant in September 1993 and June 1997 for\n\npublic intoxication and disorderly conduct. Both arrests stemmed from reports of fighting. The\n\narresting officer for the 1993 incident reported that appellant was intoxicated and abusive. The\n\narresting officer for the June 1997 incident reported that appellant was highly intoxicated, shouted\n\nobscenities, and exhibited an aggressive demeanor. The jury also heard testimony that appellant had\n\nbeen convicted in 1991 for Driving While Intoxicated (DWI).\n\n       Appellant’s daughter, Brittnie Rives, was twenty-one when she testified at his trial. Before\n\nthe age of fourteen, Brittnie visited appellant twice a month and recalled when he began dating and\n\nlater married Melissa. Brittnie lived with the couple from age fourteen to seventeen, when she\n\nmoved out of appellant’s home.\n\n       Brittnie testified extensively regarding appellant’s manner of disciplining her. She testified\n\nthat appellant had sometimes administered appropriate discipline. But most of the time, appellant\n\f                                                                                                    14\n\nwould become very violent and aggressive when he punished her. When Brittnie was six years old\n\nand in appellant’s care, he became locked out of his residence one evening. The garage door was\n\nopen slightly and appellant wanted Brittnie to squeeze through the space, go through the garage to\n\nthe laundry room, enter the house, and let him in. Brittnie was afraid to enter the garage because it\n\nwas dark and contained snakes, spiders, and bugs. When Brittnie resisted appellant’s directive, he\n\ntried to force her under the garage door. In the process, appellant pushed Brittnie face-first into the\n\nconcrete. Brittnie sustained painful scratches to her face when it hit the concrete. When Brittnie was\n\nbetween seven and eight years old, appellant threw her down a hallway and she received carpet burns\n\nwhen she skidded to a stop. When Brittnie was in high school, appellant would choke her, grab her\n\nunder her arm and throw her, and use physical force to restrain her. When she was fourteen to fifteen\n\nyears old, appellant threw Brittnie into a television set as a way of disciplining her. The force that\n\nappellant used re-tore ligaments that Brittnie had previously torn while playing soccer.\n\n       Appellant provided alcohol and marijuana to Brittnie and her friends and drank and smoked\n\nwith them. After one such occasion, Brittnie was drunk, asleep on the couch, and alone at home with\n\nappellant. When she woke briefly during the night, appellant was on top of her, fondling her genitals\n\nunder her pants. Brittnie went back to sleep, but confronted appellant the next morning. Appellant\n\ndenied the accusation several times, but when Brittnie said that she would tell someone if he did it\n\nagain, appellant said, “Okay,” and asked her not to tell Melissa.\n\n       Appellant sometimes turned on Melissa when she interfered with his disciplining of Brittnie.\n\nOn one of these occasions, appellant pinned Melissa against a wall. Brittnie testified that she\n\nwitnessed many negative interactions between appellant and Melissa. Appellant was usually\n\nintoxicated when he came home and was verbally abusive toward Melissa, calling her “bitch” and\n\f                                                                                                  15\n\n“lazy ass.” He also frequently grabbed Melissa under the arm. In 2004, when Melissa was six\n\nmonths pregnant with Lucas, appellant pinned her against the wall. Brittnie testified that appellant\n\nsometimes moderated his behavior when he was sober, but his violent and abusive conduct was not\n\nlimited to times when he was intoxicated.\n\n       Brittnie testified that she had a good relationship with both Melissa and Desirae and\n\nmaintained it even after moving out of the house at age seventeen to escape from appellant’s abuse.\n\nAbout one week before Melissa moved out, she spoke to Brittnie about “an incident” that had\n\nrecently occurred. Melissa was crying and scared. On the day of the move, Melissa spoke to Brittnie\n\nof a second, intervening incident. As she had been during the previous conversation, Melissa was\n\n“very emotional,” “crying,” and “scared.” Brittnie helped Melissa move. Melissa wanted to leave\n\nthe house quickly, before appellant returned from work, and she took only a minimal amount of\n\nbelongings for herself and the children. Brittnie also testified that she noticed a change in Desirae\n\nin the period preceding the murders. Desirae expressed “a lot of hatred” toward appellant and stayed\n\nin her room or otherwise avoided appellant when he was around.\n\n       Brooke Phillips, Melissa’s sister, testified at the punishment phase and gave similar accounts\n\nof Melissa’s and Desirae’s demeanor and behavior in the time preceding the shootings. Phillips\n\nstated that she discussed personal topics with Melissa and had been aware of her sister’s plan to\n\nmove. Phillips testified that Melissa “cried a lot, . . . [and] was nervous [and] scared” when she\n\ndecided to leave with the children. After the move, Melissa seemed more at ease. Through Phillips\n\nand another witness, the state presented evidence that, in early November 2009, Melissa had\n\nremoved four handguns and a rifle from the family home and pawned them.\n\n       Regarding appellant’s treatment of Desirae, Phillips recalled an incident in 2008 when\n\f                                                                                                    16\n\nDesirae was about thirteen years old. Phillips’s extended family, including Melissa, appellant, and\n\ntheir children, were vacationing together at a property owned by Phillips’s grandmother. One\n\nevening, when they were playing cards on the patio, appellant became angry over something\n\ninnocuous that Desirae said. He jumped from his seat and grabbed Desirae by the upper arm.\n\nDesirae seemed stunned and grew quiet. When Phillips confronted appellant about his behavior, he\n\ndid not respond. As Desirae entered her teenage years, she remained communicative with Melissa\n\nand Phillips, but would withdraw when appellant was around.\n\n       The state additionally presented evidence that in June 2011, while appellant was incarcerated\n\nin the Harris County Jail awaiting trial for capital murder, a routine cell search revealed that he was\n\nhiding contraband pills in a baggy inside a jar of peanut butter. Appellant admitted that he purchased\n\nthe pills from another inmate in administrative segregation and had managed to keep them in his cell,\n\nundetected, for over six months. The discovery of the contraband pills led to appellant’s conviction\n\nfor possession of a controlled substance.\n\n       Appellant’s punishment evidence consisted of testimony from his adoptive and biological\n\nfamily; former coworkers and employees; the psychotherapist who treated him immediately before\n\nthe offense; a psychiatrist; and an expert regarding the system of inmate classification at the Texas\n\nDepartment of Criminal Justice, Criminal Institutions Division (TDCJ). On cross-examination of\n\nappellant’s family and friends, the state elicited evidence that appellant grew up in an extremely\n\nsupportive, loving environment, in which nothing important was lacking, and he was taught right\n\nfrom wrong and how to behave. Both Hazel and Jim Cole admitted that appellant’s temper had\n\ncaused him problems and that they had intervened to smooth things over for him. Jim admitted that\n\nappellant had been fired from two different jobs, once due to appellant’s conflict with a new\n\f                                                                                                    17\n\nmanager. Hazel admitted that appellant could be hot-tempered and had been verbally abusive to her,\n\nalthough he apologized afterward. Hazel also admitted that she had helped appellant try to come up\n\nwith ideas for defending himself against the capital-murder charges. One of those ideas was to\n\ndetermine whether Melissa had drugs in her system when she died.\n\n       On cross-examination of appellant’s former coworkers, the state elicited evidence that cast\n\ndoubt upon appellant’s theory that alcohol abuse or addiction played a pivotal role in appellant’s\n\ncommission of the offense. Appellant was never known to drink on the job or arrive at work\n\nintoxicated, and while working, he functioned at a high level. Despite being sober while at work,\n\nappellant consistently had some difficulty dealing well with customer complaints because he took\n\ncustomer dissatisfaction too personally. The state noted that appellant had physically intimidated\n\na male employee by lifting the employee off his feet by the collar, and he had once reprimanded an\n\nemployee so severely that he reduced the employee to tears. Although appellant sometimes drank\n\nalcohol to excess at company functions, his drinking on those occasions did not stand out to\n\nwitnesses as particularly noteworthy. And even when drinking to excess at those functions,\n\nappellant’s behavior did not turn violent.\n\n       Sharon Boyd, a psychotherapist, testified that she met with appellant on January 26, 2010,\n\nand again on the afternoon of February 3, 2010, the day before the offense. On January 26, when\n\nshe learned that the reason for his visit was a recent marital separation, Boyd evaluated appellant for\n\nhomicidal and suicidal ideation and psychosis. Appellant denied having any such feelings. Boyd\n\nconcluded that appellant was not homicidal, suicidal, or psychotic, although he was mildly depressed\n\nand mildly anxious. Appellant, who then reported one week of sobriety, did not comply with Boyd’s\n\nrecommendations that he attend recovery meetings for alcoholics and enter an outpatient substance\n\f                                                                                                  18\n\nabuse program.\n\n       On the afternoon of February 3, Boyd met with appellant for a second time. At this session,\n\nappellant specifically denied needing any help regarding homicidal or suicidal feelings or psychosis.\n\nAlthough Boyd observed that appellant was tearful, more anxious, and more depressed, she\n\nconcluded that no homicidal or suicidal ideation or psychosis was present. She categorized appellant\n\nas “moderately depressed.” Appellant, who then reported more than two weeks of sobriety, again\n\ndeclined to pursue Boyd’s treatment recommendations, although he scheduled a third appointment\n\nwith her. The session ended at 1:45 p.m. Appellant bought the murder weapon and ammunition less\n\nthan an hour later and committed the murders the next evening.\n\n       Terry Rustin, a psychiatrist appointed to assist the defense, interviewed appellant. Rustin\n\ntestified that appellant, who showed “a great deal of denial” during the interview, was alcohol\n\ndependent as well as an alcoholic. Rustin opined that, at the time of the murders, appellant was\n\nexperiencing an adjustment disorder with a depressed mood stemming from Melissa’s departure.\n\nRustin opined that appellant’s alcohol dependence, alcoholism, and period of abstinence from\n\nalcohol immediately before the shootings, together with appellant’s adjustment disorder, played a\n\nrole in the commission of the offense. Rustin stated that repeated episodes of withdrawal from\n\nalcohol use by an alcoholic leads to “more brain damage and more emotional damage” than staying\n\ncontinuously intoxicated. Rustin asserted that appellant’s alcohol dependence and alcoholism could\n\nbe treated even if appellant were imprisoned. On cross-examination, Rustin testified that appellant\n\nhad poor impulse control, which could either be caused or exacerbated by alcohol abuse. Rustin also\n\nacknowledged that, at the Harris County Jail while awaiting trial, appellant had been discovered in\n\npossession of contraband drugs that would produce intoxicating effects similar to alcohol.\n\f                                                                                                     19\n\n        Through Rustin, appellant successfully offered into evidence the records of his medical\n\ntreatment while in the Harris County Jail awaiting trial for capital murder. The records established\n\nthat appellant admitted to “getting depressed and mad” in jail and that he refused to take medications\n\nprescribed by jail psychiatrists.\n\n        Viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, the foregoing evidence is sufficient to\n\nsustain the jury’s affirmative answer to the future-dangerousness special issue. Initially, we note the\n\ncircumstances of the offense and the events surrounding it. See Devoe, 354 S.W.3d at 462; Hayes,\n\n85 S.W.3d at 814. They support rational inferences of cold calculation, premeditation, and a wanton\n\nand callous disregard for human life. Appellant purchased the murder weapon the day before the\n\nhomicides. See Dinkins, 894 S.W.2d 330, 360–61 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995) (concluding that the\n\ndefendant’s purchase of the murder weapon a day before a scheduled meeting with one of the victims\n\nsupported a reasonable inference of pre-planning). Immediately before the shootings, appellant\n\nadvised his ten-year-old son where to live if one or both of his parents died. Appellant also departed\n\nfrom his normal practice of merely dropping the boys off in the parking lot. Instead, appellant\n\nentered the small apartment, which was occupied by Melissa, the teenaged Desirae, and three\n\nchildren aged 10 years and younger, with a fully loaded semi-automatic pistol in his waistband. The\n\nfact that appellant “knowingly and willingly placed himself in, and sought after, circumstances\n\nfacilitating homicide . . . demonstrates a callousness and lack of reflection about taking human life[,]\n\nwhich tends to increase the probability that he is a future danger.” See Rachal, 917 S.W.2d at\n\n807–08.\n\n        Although aware that he was in close proximity to three young children, appellant completely\n\nemptied the pistol’s magazine into his victims, inflicting multiple fatal wounds at close range. See\n\f                                                                                                      20\n\nDinkins, 894 S.W.2d at 360 (“Appellant’s infliction of multiple wounds at close range indicates a\n\nwanton and callous disregard for human life.”). Appellant asserted that he did so because he was\n\n“angry and frustrated.” Even if the jury had been inclined to find that Melissa’s and Desirae’s\n\nmurders represented an isolated incident of rage, it “could [have] rationally conclude[d] from the\n\nresults of appellant’s isolated incident of rage that his rage is of such an uncontrollable and extreme\n\nnature that he is a continuing danger to society.” Sonnier v. State, 913 S.W.2d 511, 517 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1995).\n\n        Desirae’s killing is particularly telling. By appellant’s own admission, he stepped over\n\nMelissa’s body, followed Desirae into the back bedroom, and inflicted two mortal wounds because\n\nhe was angry that the teenager was screaming at him. Evidence of such wanton, senseless killing\n\nsupports the inference that appellant is a continuing danger to society. See Coble, 330 S.W.3d at 268\n\n(discussing the future-dangerousness issue’s emphasis on the defendant’s internal restraints);\n\nSonnier, 913 S.W.2d at 517. Given the evidence in the record that (1) Desirae and Chloe both\n\nwitnessed the first shooting, (2) appellant shot and killed Desirae, and (3) appellant pointed his pistol\n\nat Chloe and made it go “click click” instead of “boom boom,” the jury could also reasonably infer\n\nthat appellant killed Desirae to eliminate her as a witness and would have killed Chloe, too, if any\n\nbullets had remained in his pistol. We have previously found killings motivated by the desire to\n\neliminate witnesses to reflect a wanton and callous disregard for life, such that the circumstances of\n\nthe offense are sufficient by themselves to support a finding of future dangerousness. Dinkins, 894\n\nS.W.2d at 360. Alternatively, appellant’s targeted aggression toward the only two children at the\n\nscene who were biologically related to Melissa, but not to him, supports a finding of vicious\n\ncalculation. We conclude that the circumstances of the offense were sufficient to support the jury’s\n\f                                                                                                     21\n\naffirmative answer to the future-dangerousness special issue.\n\n          We also observe that, rather than turning himself in after the shootings, appellant—who later\n\nprofessed a desire that he would be caught and killed by police—fled the scene at high speed with\n\nan unrestrained two-year-old in the vehicle thereby prompting a manhunt, stole a large sum of cash\n\nfrom his employer, and intending to commit “suicide by cop,” bought additional ammunition for his\n\nsemiautomatic pistol. Such actions reflect forethought and intent to avoid capture, as well as a\n\ndisregard for the lives of his pursuers and innocent others, including his own child, Lucas. See\n\nSmith, 74 S.W.3d at 872. The jury could further infer a lack of remorse from appellant’s words and\n\ndemeanor while speaking about the murders to Sgts. Chappell and Bush, a few hours after the\n\nshootings. Appellant appeared angry and expressed no remorse for having killed either of the two\n\nvictims. Although appellant expressed regret that his sons had witnessed the shootings, he did so\n\nwith a slight shrug and the statement, “Shit happens.” Cf. Estrada, 313 S.W.3d at 28 n.9 (jury could\n\nreasonably infer lack of remorse from the evidence of appellant’s demeanor, including his complaint,\n\nnot long after he had brutally murdered his wife and their unborn child, that she “had ruined his\n\nlife”).\n\n          Moreover, appellant had a criminal history that included convictions for DWI in 1991, public\n\nintoxication in 1993 (stemming from fighting), terroristic threat in 1994, and public intoxication and\n\ndisorderly conduct in 1997 (again based on fighting). Although we remain cognizant that each case\n\nmust be determined on its own facts, Estrada, 313 S.W.3d at 284, we have found criminal records\n\nthat are arguably less serious than appellant’s to support a jury’s finding that a probability of future\n\ndangerousness exists. See, e.g., Lucio v. State, 351 S.W.3d 878, 904 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011). Here,\n\nthe evidence further reasonably suggested that, due to the intervention of appellant’s adoptive parents\n\f                                                                                                    22\n\nand appellant’s manipulation of Rives, appellant’s conviction record under-represented the\n\nseriousness of his criminal history, especially his assaultive behavior and use of a deadly weapon.\n\nCf. Williams v. State, 937 S.W.2d 479, 484 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996) (a prior conviction for\n\naggravated assault, a violent felony, is persuasive evidence of future dangerousness); see Barley v.\n\nState, 906 S.W.2d 27, 30–31 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995) (explaining that even a criminal history\n\ncomprised of offenses that are not overtly violent can lead a reasonable juror to find a probability of\n\nfuture dangerousness when the offenses show an escalating and on-going pattern of disrespect and\n\ncontinued violations of the law).\n\n       Two former girlfriends, Leal and Rives, testified about the abuse he inflicted upon them.\n\nThere was testimony that appellant physically and verbally abused Melissa, Desirae, and Brittnie,\n\nengaged in bar fights, and threatened his neighbor, Freeman, with a gun. Even his mother, who\n\nacknowledged that she would do anything to protect appellant, admitted that he had a temper and\n\nwas sometimes verbally abusive to her.\n\n       The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, was sufficient to support the\n\njury’s affirmative answer to the future-dangerousness special issue. Point of error ten is overruled.\n\n                                 Admissibility of Oral Statements\n\n       In points of error one through four, appellant challenges the trial court’s ruling on his motion\n\nto suppress the videotaped statement he made to Sgts. Chappell and Bush in Wharton County and\n\nhis later videotaped statement to Officer Avila in Harris County. Appellant contends that the\n\nadmission of his statements violated federal law under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966),\n\nand state law under Article 15.17.\n\n       We employ a bifurcated standard of review when reviewing claims concerning Miranda\n\f                                                                                                    23\n\nviolations and the admission of statements made as a result of custodial interrogation. Pecina v.\n\nState, 361 S.W.3d 68, 78–79 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012) (citing Guzman v. State, 955 S.W.2d 85, 89\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1997)). We measure the propriety of the trial court’s ruling under the totality of\n\nthe circumstances, extending almost total deference to the trial court’s rulings on questions of\n\nhistorical fact, as well as on its application of law to fact questions that turn upon credibility and\n\ndemeanor. Id. at 79; Leza v. State, 351 S.W.3d 344, 349 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011). We review de\n\nnovo the trial court’s rulings on questions of law and its rulings on application of law to fact\n\nquestions that do not turn upon credibility and demeanor. Pecina, 361 S.W.3d at 79; Leza, 351\n\nS.W.3d at 349. We view the record in the light most favorable to the trial court’s conclusion and\n\nreverse the judgment only if it is outside the zone of reasonable disagreement. State v. Dixon, 206\n\nS.W.3d 587, 590 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006). On appeal, this Court “does not engage in its own factual\n\nreview but decides whether the trial judge’s fact findings are supported by the record. If the trial\n\ncourt’s findings are supported by the record,” we are “not at liberty to disturb them, and on appellate\n\nreview, we address only the question of whether the trial court improperly applied the law to the\n\nfacts.” Romero v. State, 800 S.W.2d 539, 543 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990); see Dixon, 206 S.W.3d at\n\n590 (“We will sustain the lower court’s ruling if it is reasonably supported by the record and is\n\ncorrect on any theory of law applicable to the case.”).\n\n       The record reflects that the trial judge held a hearing on appellant’s motion to suppress his\n\nstatements. Trooper Mena, Justice of the Peace Cynthia Kubicek, Sgts. Bush and Chappell, and\n\nOfficer Avila testified at the hearing. The evidence showed that, after Trooper Mena arrested\n\nappellant at a Wharton County Walmart, he took appellant before Wharton County magistrate\n\f                                                                                                                    24\n\nKubicek, and she informed appellant of his rights.9 In Wharton County, appellant gave a videotaped\n\nstatement to Sgts. Chappell and Bush. Appellant was later transported to Harris County, where he\n\ngave a second videotaped statement to Officer Avila. The state introduced a number of exhibits for\n\nthe trial court’s consideration, including a completed and signed document captioned, “Wharton\n\nCounty Sheriff’s Department Magistrate’s Warning Certificate—Article 15.17 Texas Code of\n\nCriminal Procedure,” and videotaped recordings of appellant’s entire Wharton and Harris County\n\nstatements. At the close of the evidence and after hearing argument, the trial court took appellant’s\n\nmotion to suppress under advisement. It subsequently ruled that it would grant the motion in part\n\nand deny it in part. The trial court denied the motion as to the beginning of appellant’s Wharton\n\nCounty statement. It granted the motion as to the later part of the Wharton County statement,\n\nstarting from appellant’s statement, “I don’t want to talk any more,” through to the end.10 But it\n\ndenied the motion altogether concerning appellant’s Harris County statement to Officer Avila. The\n\ntrial court later supplemented the record on appeal with written findings of fact and conclusions of\n\nlaw concerning the voluntariness of appellant’s statements.11\n\n\n        9\n           Trooper Mena testified that, after he apprehended appellant, another deputy assisted him with\nhandcuffing appellant and placing him in the backseat of a squad car. Appellant was then transported to the W harton\nCounty Jail. Trooper Mena stated that neither he nor the assisting deputy gave appellant warnings pursuant to\nArticle 38.22 or Miranda, but he also asserted that neither he nor his fellow deputy asked appellant any questions\nother than appellant’s name.\n\n         10\n            The videotaped statement reflected in State’s Exhibit 8 has a total running time of twenty-eight minutes\nand ten seconds. Appellant’s statement, “I don’t want to talk any more,” occurs at roughly the eleven-minute, thirty-\nfive-second mark.\n\n         11\n             On appeal, appellant asked us to abate this matter, stating that the trial court had not entered written\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law concerning the voluntariness of his statements. W e concluded that\nsupplementation of the record, rather than abatement of the appeal, was appropriate. See T EX . R. A PP . P. 34.5(c)(2).\nAccordingly, we directed the trial court to prepare and file its findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding this\nissue and instructed the trial court clerk to forward the supplemented record.\n         Although the findings refer to Officer Avila as “Sgt.,” he identified himself at the beginning of his testimony\nas “Senior Police Officer Xavier Avila.” W e will therefore refer to him as Officer Avila.\n\f                                                                                                                 25\n\n        In its written findings, the trial court found Trooper Mena, Justice of the Peace Kubicek, Sgts.\n\nChappell and Bush, and Officer Avila to be credible and reliable witnesses. It made these factual\n\nfindings regarding appellant’s magistration:\n\n        22.      Magistrate Kubicek first came into contact with Defendant Cole at\n                 approximately 1:15 [a.m.] on February 5, 2010, at the Wharton County jail.\n                 Defendant Cole indicated to Magistrate Kubicek he understood why he was\n                 in custody.\n\n        23.      Magistrate Kubicek confirmed that Defendant Cole could speak and\n                 understand English. Magistrate Kubicek observed Defendant Cole to be\n                 awake, alert, and oriented.\n\n        24.      Magistrate Kubicek read the warnings reflected on state’s exhibit one12 to\n                 Defendant Cole.\n\n        25.      Defendant Cole appeared to understand the warnings read to him by\n                 Magistrate Kubicek and he did not ask any questions about the rights\n                 Magistrate Kubicek read to him from state’s exhibit one.\n\n        26.      Defendant Cole signed the warnings reflected on state’s exhibit one in the\n                 presence of Magistrate Kubicek.\n\n        27.      While advising Defendant Cole of the warnings reflected on state’s exhibit\n                 one, Magistrate Kubicek further advised Defendant Cole that since the\n                 offense did not occur in Wharton County that he would not be appointed an\n                 attorney there but that he could retain his own or one would be appointed to\n                 him in Harris County.\n\n        28.      Defendant Cole signed state’s exhibit one acknowledging his right to request\n                 appointed counsel. However, Defendant Cole did not request appointed\n                 counsel while in Wharton County, Texas.\n\n        29.      Defendant Cole did not request the appointment of counsel at any time while\n                 in Wharton County.\n\n        Regarding appellant’s interview with Sgts. Chappell and Bush in Wharton County, the trial\n\n\n\n        12\n             State’s Exhibit 1 is a document entitled, “W harton County Sheriff’s Department Magistrate’s W arning\nCertificate[,] Article 15.17 Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.”\n\f                                                                                                   26\n\ncourt found:\n\n       21.        Both Sgt. Chappell and Sgt. Bush were present when Magistrate Kubicek\n                  read Defendant Cole magistrate warnings.\n\n                                                          ***\n\n       30.        Sgt. Chappell and Sgt. Bush observed Defendant Cole to be awake, alert, and\n                  oriented when he signed the magistrate form reflected in state’s exhibit one.\n\n       31.        After the magistrate warnings were read and signed, Sgts. Chappell and Bush\n                  took custody of Defendant Cole and entered an investigator’s office at the\n                  Wharton County Sheriff’s Office with Defendant Cole at approximately 1:44\n                  am on February 5, 2010 and Sgt. Chappell advised Defendant Cole of his\n                  Miranda rights as reflected on state’s exhibit 8.13\n\n       32.        Sgt. Chappell advised Defendant Cole that he had the right to remain silent\n                  and not make any statement at all; that any statement he made may be used\n                  against him at his trial; that any statement he made may be used as evidence\n                  against him in court; that he had the right to have a lawyer present to advise\n                  him prior to and during any questioning; that if he was unable to employ a\n                  lawyer he had the right to have a lawyer appointed to advise him prior to and\n                  during any questioning; [and] that he had the right to terminate or stop the\n                  interview at any time.\n\n       33.        Defendant Cole indicated he understood each right read to him by Sgt.\n                  Chappell. No promises or threats were made to Defendant Cole. Defendant\n                  Cole did not request a lawyer after Sgt. Chappell read the Miranda rights.\n\n       34.        After advising Defendant Cole of his rights[,] Sgt. Chappell asked Defendant\n                  Cole if he wanted to talk about the events that occurred.\n\n       35.        Defendant Cole replied, “Tell me what you know and I’ll talk about it.”\n\n       36.        After Sgt. Chappell explained that was not the way he would proceed but\n                  rather wanted to hear the Defendant’s side of what happened[,] Defendant\n                  Cole responded, “It’s not going to happen tonight.”\n\n       37.        Sgt. Chappell then responded with[,] “It’s not going to happen tonight?”\n                  Defendant Cole then said no and requested water and his shoes.\n\n\n\n       13\n            State’s Exhibit 8 is the first videotaped statement.\n\f                                                                                         27\n\n38.   After Defendant Cole said[,] “It’s not going to happen tonight,” Sgts.\n      Chappell and Bush stopped the questioning because they thought that\n      statement was an invocation of Defendant Cole’s right to remain silent.\n\n39.   As Sgt. Chappell started to leave the investigator’s office to get the water and\n      shoes, Defendant Cole volunteered, “You’re right about one thing,”\n      reinitiating discussion of the investigation with the two sergeants.\n\n40.   Sgt. Chappell responded with[,] “Pardon me.” Defendant Cole then stated,\n      “You’re right about one thing. It was not planned.” Sgt. Chappell then left\n      the investigator’s office.\n\n41.   While Sgt. Chappell was out of the office, Sgt. Bush engaged in a general\n      discussion with Defendant Cole but did not ask him any questions.\n\n42.   After providing Defendant Cole with water and shoes, Sgt. Chappell asked\n      Defendant Cole if he was ready to go and Defendant Cole responded[,]\n      “Ready to go to Harris County.”\n\n43.   As Sgt. Chappell asked for car keys, Defendant Cole reinitiated a discussion\n      about the case again and asked, “What do y’all want to know? What do I\n      need to tell you?” Sgt. Chappell answered, “What happened.”\n\n44.   Thereafter, Sgt. Chappell and Defendant Cole engaged in a discussion\n      wherein Chappell advised Defendant Cole of the source of his information\n      and Defendant Cole expressed his opinion about the quantity of evidence\n      obtained by Chappell.\n\n45.   After continuing to engage in a discussion about the case with Sgt. Chappell\n      and Sgt. Bush, Defendant Cole again invoked his right to remain silent when\n      he stated, “I do not want to talk anymore.” After Defendant Cole Defendant\n      Cole stated that he did not want to talk anymore he immediately began to\n      volunteer statements expressing his desire for the police to kill him. Chappell\n      and Bush did not ask Defendant Cole any other questions at that time.\n\n46.   Immediately after Defendant Cole stated he did not wish to talk anymore,\n      Chappell and Bush did not ask Defendant Cole any questions at that time.\n      Defendant Cole, however, continued to talk[,] expressing his desire to die,\n      concern for his children[,] and stating everything is gone.\n\n47.   Sgts. Chappell and Bush then continued to discuss the case further with\n      Defendant Cole, and engaged in a general discussion with Defendant Cole\n      about the offense, his work, his wife and his children. During the\n\f                                                                                                                  28\n\n                  discussion[,] Chappell and Bush asked Defendant Cole questions about the\n                  offense.\n\n         48.      Sgt. Chappell and Sgt. Bush concluded their interview with Defendant Cole\n                  in Wharton County at approximately 2:12 [a.m.] and then drove him to the\n                  Houston Police Department (HPD) homicide office. Upon arrival at HPD[,]\n                  Chappell and Bush turned over custody of Defendant Cole to Sgt. Avila at\n                  approximately 4:30 [a.m.] on February 5, 2010.\n\n         Concerning the interview with Officer Avila in Harris County, the trial court found:\n\n         49.      Sgt. Avila observed Defendant Cole to be awake, alert and oriented.\n\n         50.      Approximately three hours passed between Defendant Cole’s invocation of\n                  his right to silence in Wharton County and when he was again interviewed by\n                  Sgt. Avila.\n\n         51.      An HPD crime scene unit officer made contact with Defendant Cole in the\n                  homicide office and tested his hands, took custody of his clothes[,] and\n                  photographed him.\n\n         52.      At approximately 5:05 [a.m.] on February 5, 2010, Sgt. Avila read Defendant\n                  Cole his Miranda rights as reflected on state’s exhibit nine.\n\n         53.      Sgt. Avila advised Defendant Cole that he had the right to remain silent and\n                  not make any statement [and] that any statement he made may be used against\n                  him at his trial; that any statement he made may be used as evidence against\n                  him in court; that he had the right to have a lawyer present to advise him prior\n                  to and during any questioning; [and] that he had the right to terminate the\n                  interview at any time.\n\n         54.      Defendant Cole verbally indicated he understood each right and placed his\n                  initials next to each right on the warning form reflected in state’s exhibit\n                  nine.\n\n         55.      After Sgt. Avila advised Defendant Cole of his rights, Defendant Cole\n                  invoked his right to counsel.14\n\n         56.      Sgt. Avila immediately ceased any attempt to interview [appellant],\n\n\n        14\n             In the record before us, appellant’s statement to Officer Avila in Harris County (State’s Exhibit 9) is\ndivided into three consecutive parts. Part one has a running time of twelve minutes and twelve seconds. Appellant’s\ninvocation of his right to counsel occurs at approximately the four-minute, twenty-nine-second mark, during part one.\n\f                                                                                      29\n\n      terminated the interview[,] and left the interview room to turn off the video\n      recording device.\n\n57.   After turning off the recording device, Sgt. Avila returned to the interview\n      room in which Defendant Cole was seated and began to explain the transport\n      process to Defendant Cole.\n\n58.   After Sgt. Avila returned to the interview room, Defendant Cole reinitiated\n      further discussion about the case when he asked if his ten-year-old son would\n      have to testify.\n\n59.   Sgt. Avila answered Defendant Cole by stating it was possible.\n\n60.   Defendant Cole then advised Sgt. Avila that he changed his mind and wanted\n      to give a statement about shooting his wife and stepdaughter.\n\n61.   Sgt. Avila again left the interview room to again turn on the video recording\n      device.\n\n62.   After turning on the video recording device, Sgt. Avila returned to the\n      interview room in the homicide office and asked Defendant Cole to confirm\n      that a few minutes earlier he was advised of his rights and asked to initial\n      each.\n\n63.   Defendant Cole confirmed his rights were read to him and that he understood\n      each right.\n\n64.   Sgt. Avila reminded Defendant Cole that earlier he invoked his right to an attorney\n      and Defendant Cole responded he changed his mind and further stated he was doing\n      so voluntarily.\n\n65.   Sgt. Avila again read Defendant Cole his Miranda rights as reflected on\n      state’s exhibit nine.\n\n66.   Defendant Cole again verbally indicated that he understood each right.\n\n67.   Defendant Cole confirmed that he was initiating further conversation with\n      Sgt. Avila.\n\n68.   Defendant Cole then freely and voluntarily waived his rights and gave a\n      voluntary statement as reflected on state’s exhibit nine.\n\n69.   Sgt. Avila did not force, threaten[,] or promise anything in exchange for\n\f                                                                                                                      30\n\n                  Defendant Cole’s statements on state’s exhibit nine.\n\n         In its conclusions of law, the trial court determined that appellant freely and voluntarily\n\nsigned the warnings read to him by the magistrate judge, after acknowledging that he understood the\n\nwarnings; when Sgt. Chappell subsequently read him his Miranda rights, appellant acknowledged\n\nthat he understood those rights; and appellant never invoked his right to counsel while in Wharton\n\nCounty. The trial court concluded that appellant invoked his right to silence in Wharton County\n\nwhen he stated, “It’s not going to happen tonight.”15 It further concluded that Sgts. Chappell and\n\nBush scrupulously honored that invocation of appellant’s right to silence and ceased questioning him\n\nuntil appellant re-initiated discussion of the case by stating, “You are right about one thing. It was\n\nnot planned.” The trial court also concluded that appellant voluntarily waived his Miranda rights\n\nwhen he re-initiated a discussion about his case with Sgts. Chappell and Bush, and that it was only\n\nafter appellant’s re-initiation of the discussion that Sgts. Chappell and Bush resumed the interview.\n\n         However, the trial court concluded that appellant unequivocally and unambiguously invoked\n\nhis right to silence again in Wharton County when he stated, “I do not want to talk anymore,” and\n\nthat Sgts. Chappell and Bush did not honor appellant’s re-invocation of that right. The trial court\n\nthus determined that appellant’s subsequent statements to Sgts. Chappell and Bush in Wharton\n\nCounty after the re-invocation of his right to silence were recorded in violation of that right. In\n\n\n         15\n              The trial court concluded that appellant invoked his right to silence in W harton County when he stated,\n“It’s not going to happen tonight.” However, we note the existence of cases which call into question whether that\nparticular statement constituted a clear and unambiguous invocation of appellant’s right to silence. See Dowthitt v.\nState, 931 S.W .2d 244, 257 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996) (rejecting the appellant’s argument that his statement— “I can’t\nsay more than that. I need to rest”— was an unambiguous invocation of his right to remain silent); cf. Marshall v.\nState, 210 S.W .3d 618, 628 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006) (concluding that, when the appellant re-initiated contact with the\npolice to tell his side of the story, the trial court could reasonably have found that any invocation by the appellant of\nhis right to remain silent was ambiguous, thereby permitting the officer either to continue questioning or stop the\nquestioning to clarify whether the appellant really wanted to remain silent). The Court takes no position on whether\nappellant’s statement was a sufficient invocation of his right to silence.\n\f                                                                                                                       31\n\ncontrast, the trial court determined that appellant’s statements to Sgts. Chappell and Bush in Wharton\n\nCounty preceding the re-invocation of his right to silence were freely and voluntarily given under\n\nArticle 38.22. It also determined that the taking of those statements did not violate appellant’s rights\n\nunder the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution or Article 1,\n\nSection 10, of the Texas Constitution.\n\n         Concerning appellant’s Harris County statement to Officer Avila, the trial court concluded\n\nthat the officer scrupulously honored appellant’s invocation of the right to counsel by ceasing all\n\nquestioning and terminating the interview. It further concluded that appellant re-initiated discussion\n\nabout his case when he asked Officer Avila whether appellant’s son would have to testify and then\n\nvolunteered that he had changed his mind and wished to give a statement.\n\n         In point of error one, invoking Miranda and Moran v. Burbine, 475 U.S. 412 (1986),\n\nappellant alleges that he did not voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waive his right to counsel\n\nbefore Sgts. Chappell and Bush questioned him in Wharton County.16 Appellant concedes that the\n\nmagistrate read him a list of warnings and instructions regarding his rights—including his rights to\n\nremain silent, to hire an attorney, to have an attorney appointed, and to have an attorney present\n\nduring any questioning by law enforcement—and asked appellant if he understood those rights.\n\nAppellant further concedes that he indicated to the magistrate that he understood those rights. The\n\ngravamen of appellant’s complaint is that the magistrate immediately negated the prophylactic effect\n\n\n\n         16\n             As we recognized in Pecina, the “rights created in Miranda, including the right to have counsel present\nduring custodial interrogation, ‘are not themselves rights protected by the Constitution but [are] instead measures to\ninsure that the right against compulsory self-incrimination [is] protected.’” 361 S.W .3d at 74 n.16; see also\nContreras v. State, 312 S.W .3d 566, 582 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010) (“Miranda does not set forth substantive\nconstitutional rights with regards to interrogations; rather, that decision and its progeny set up rules for the admission\nof certain statements by the accused— excluding a statement under certain conditions when it is determined that law\nenforcement failed to observe certain practices during a custodial interrogation.”).\n\f                                                                                                    32\n\nof those warnings by informing appellant that he would not receive appointed counsel in Wharton\n\nCounty, because such counsel would be appointed in Harris County. Appellant contends that the\n\nmagistrate affirmatively instructed him not to request an attorney in Wharton County. Appellant\n\nasserts that the magistrate’s alleged affirmative instruction misled him and removed his freedom to\n\ninvoke his right to counsel when Sgts. Chappell and Bush initially approached him and asked to\n\ninterview him about the murder. Appellant argues that, accordingly, the trial court should have\n\nsuppressed his entire Wharton County statement.\n\n       The Fifth Amendment precludes the government from compelling a criminal suspect to bear\n\nwitness against himself. U.S. CONST . amend. V; Pecina, 361 S.W.3d at 74–75. In Miranda, the\n\nSupreme Court created safeguards to protect the privilege against self-incrimination in the inherently\n\ncoercive atmosphere of custodial interrogations. Pecina, 361 S.W.3d at 75. In keeping with those\n\nsafeguards, police officers must give Miranda warnings to a person who is in custody before\n\nquestioning him. Id. Once an individual invokes his right to have counsel present during custodial\n\ninterrogation, a valid waiver of that right cannot be established by merely showing that the individual\n\nresponded to police-initiated interrogation after being advised of his rights again. Id. (citing\n\nEdwards v. Arizona, 451 U.S. 477 (1981)). “Only if the person voluntarily and intelligently waives\n\nhis Miranda rights, including the right to have an attorney present during questioning, may his\n\nstatement be introduced into evidence against him at trial.” Id.\n\n       To evaluate whether appellant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his Miranda\n\nrights, we look to the standard articulated by the Supreme Court in Burbine. Joseph v. State, 309\n\nS.W.3d 20, 25 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010). Initially, appellant’s relinquishment of his right to have\n\ncounsel during interrogation must have been voluntary “in the sense that it was the product of a free\n\f                                                                                                     33\n\nand deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or deception.” Id. (quoting Burbine, 475\n\nU.S. at 421). Appellant must have additionally waived the right to interrogation counsel “with full\n\nawareness of both the nature of the right [he was abandoning] and the consequences of the decision\n\nto abandon it.” Id. “Only if the ‘totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation’ reveals\n\nboth an uncoerced choice and the requisite level of comprehension” may a court properly conclude\n\nthat a defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to interrogation counsel.\n\nId. But “[o]nce it is determined that a suspect’s decision not to rely on his rights was uncoerced, that\n\nhe at all times knew he could stand mute and request a lawyer, and that he was aware of the State’s\n\nintention to use his statements to secure a conviction, the analysis is complete and the waiver is valid\n\nas a matter of law.” Cobb v. State, 85 S.W.3d 258 n.7 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002) (quoting Burbine, 475\n\nU.S. at 427).     The totality-of-the-circumstances approach requires consideration of all the\n\ncircumstances surrounding the interrogation, including the defendant’s experience, background, and\n\nconduct. Id. (citing Fare v. Michael C., 442 U.S. 707, 725 (1979), and North Carolina v. Butler, 441\n\nU.S. 369, 375–76 (1979)).          “[A] defendant’s conduct—namely, willingly talking with\n\ninvestigators—can demonstrate a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his Miranda rights.”\n\nId.\n\n        We conclude that it was within the trial court’s discretion to determine that appellant\n\nvoluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived his right to counsel before Sgts. Chappell and Bush\n\nquestioned him in Wharton County. Regarding appellant’s allegation that the magistrate’s statement\n\nsomehow misled him regarding his ability to invoke his right to counsel in Wharton County, we first\n\nnote the Supreme Court’s unequivocal statement that “[w]hat matters for purposes of Miranda and\n\nEdwards is what happens when the defendant is approached for interrogation, and (if he consents)\n\f                                                                                                    34\n\nwhat happens during the interrogation—not what happened at any preliminary hearing.” Montejo\n\nv. Louisiana, 556 U.S. 778, 797 (2009); see Pecina, 361 S.W.3d at 78 (“Distilled to its essence,\n\nMontejo means that a defendant’s invocation of his right to counsel at his Article 15.17 hearing says\n\nnothing about his possible invocation of his right to counsel during later police-initiated custodial\n\ninterrogation. The magistration event is not an interrogation event.”).\n\n       We also reject appellant’s characterization of the magistrate’s statements regarding the\n\nappointment of counsel in Wharton County. The record supports a finding that the magistrate simply\n\nand accurately stated an administrative fact: should appellant request it, Harris County, rather than\n\nWharton County, would handle the appointment of counsel.\n\n       Further, we do not think that the magistrate’s statement placed appellant in an extraordinary\n\nposition. Following his magistration, appellant was essentially in the same situation as a defendant\n\nwho is arrested after a roadside stop and read his Miranda rights. The Fifth Amendment does not\n\nrequire police to have, in tow, lawyers who are ready to be appointed at a moment’s notice to assist\n\nsuch defendants. See Davis v. United States, 512 U.S. 452, 460 (1994) (“In Miranda itself, we\n\nexpressly rejected the suggestion ‘that each police station must have a “station house lawyer” present\n\nat all times to advise prisoners,’ and held instead that a suspect must be told of his right to have an\n\nattorney present and that he may not be questioned after invoking his right to counsel.”) (internal\n\ncitation omitted). “[T]he primary protection afforded suspects subject to custodial interrogation is\n\nthe Miranda warnings themselves. ‘Full comprehension of the rights to remain silent and request\n\nan attorney [is] sufficient to dispel whatever coercion is inherent in the interrogation process.’” Id.\n\n(quoting Burbine, 475 U.S. at 427). Nor does the Constitution require immediate magistration. See\n\nCounty of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 56 (1991) (stating the general rule that jurisdictions\n\f                                                                                                   35\n\nthat provide judicial determinations of probable cause within forty-eight hours of arrest comply with\n\nthe Fourth Amendment). What is critical is the individual’s immediate ability to invoke his Miranda\n\nrights upon being placed in custody. The actual appointment of counsel—assuming that it occurs\n\nwithin a constitutionally reasonable time after the invocation of this right—is of lesser importance.\n\n        At the very most, this record supports a finding that there may have been some potential for\n\nconfusion on appellant’s part regarding his ability to obtain appointed interrogation counsel in\n\nWharton County. But it was entirely within the zone of reasonable disagreement for the trial judge\n\nto find, as it implicitly did, that appellant experienced no actual confusion. Defense counsel argued\n\nthat it was reasonable for appellant to interpret the magistrate’s statement to mean that he could not\n\nobtain appointed counsel in Wharton County. However, appellant did not present any evidence from\n\nany source that he was actually confused by the magistrate’s statements. The record is thus devoid\n\nof evidence that he was actually confused by the magistrate’s statements and that, but for them, he\n\nwould have invoked his right to counsel when Sgts. Chappell and Bush approached him. Cf.\n\nJohnson v. State, 286 S.W.3d 346, 353 n.13 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009) (“Defense counsel’s argument\n\nto the [fact-finder] is not evidence.”) (Keller, P.J., dissenting).\n\n        After reviewing the videotaped statement, we conclude that the totality of the circumstances\n\nsurrounding the interrogation in Wharton County support the finding that appellant initially waived\n\nhis right to counsel with full awareness of the nature of the rights being abandoned and the\n\nconsequences of his decision to abandon them. Joseph, 309 S.W.3d at 27. Before Sgt. Chappell\n\nbegan reading appellant his rights, appellant acknowledged that he had just been before the\n\nmagistrate. Appellant expressed no confusion regarding his right to counsel as explained by the\n\nmagistrate. As Sgt. Chappell read each right to him again, appellant once more indicated his\n\f                                                                                                    36\n\nunderstanding, answering, “Yes, sir” and nodding his head up and down. The warnings that Sgt.\n\nChappell read to appellant at the beginning of the interview made appellant fully aware of his rights\n\nunder Miranda and Article 38.22, as well as the consequences of abandoning those rights.\n\n       Immediately after reading warnings to appellant, Sgt. Chappell asked whether appellant\n\nwanted to talk to the officers regarding the offense. Appellant did not ask for a lawyer. Instead, he\n\npromptly responded, “Tell me what you know and I’ll talk about it.” When appellant later stated,\n\n“It’s not going to happen tonight,” the officers did not resort to physical or psychological pressures\n\nto elicit further statements. Rather, the videotape clearly shows that Sgt. Chappell began to leave\n\nthe interview room to retrieve appellant’s shoes and get him water, as appellant had requested.\n\n       When Sgt. Chappell began to leave the interview room, appellant stopped the detective and\n\nspontaneously offered, “You’re right about one thing.” When Sgt. Chappell responded, “Pardon\n\nme?” appellant repeated himself, stating, “You’re right about one thing. It was not planned.” When\n\nSgt. Chappell returned to the interview room with appellant’s shoes and water, appellant directly\n\nasked the officers, “What do y’all want to know? What do I need to tell you?” After Sgt. Chappell\n\nanswered that the officers needed to know “[w]hat happened,” appellant did not invoke his right to\n\ncounsel, but instead discussed the offense.\n\n       Under the totality of the circumstances, it was within the zone of reasonable disagreement\n\nfor the trial court to admit the first part of appellant’s Wharton County statement. Point of error one\n\nis overruled.\n\n       In point of error two, appellant alleges that Sgts. Chappell and Bush did not scrupulously\n\nhonor his right to silence after he said, “I don’t want to talk anymore,” in his Wharton County\n\nstatement. Appellant further asserts that the statement he gave to Officer Avila in Harris County was\n\f                                                                                                    37\n\nthe result of a conspiracy between Sgt. Chappell and Officer Avila to convince him to relinquish the\n\nright to silence that he had previously invoked in Wharton County. For these reasons, appellant\n\nargues, the factors set forth by the Supreme Court in Michigan v. Mosley, 423 U.S. 96 (1975),\n\nrequired the trial court to suppress his Harris County statement to Officer Avila.\n\n       In Mosley, the Supreme Court “addressed the circumstances under which the prosecution is\n\nprohibited from using a defendant’s in-custody statement obtained by police who have renewed\n\ninterrogation after the defendant has invoked his right to remain silent.” Murphy v. State, 766\n\nS.W.2d 246, 248 (Tex. Crim. App. 1989). The Court rejected the defendant’s argument that, once\n\nthe person has invoked his right to silence, further questioning of an individual in custody\n\nrepresented a per se violation of the protections set out in Miranda. Mosley, 423 U.S. at 102–03\n\n(“Clearly, [nothing] in the Miranda opinion can be sensibly read to create a per se proscription of\n\nindefinite duration upon any further questioning by any police officer on any subject, once the person\n\nin custody has indicated a desire to remain silent.”). Rather, the Court concluded that, under\n\nMiranda, “the admissibility of the statements obtained after the person in custody has decided to\n\nremain silent depends on whether” law enforcement authorities “scrupulously honored” the person’s\n\n“right to cut off questioning.” Id. at 104. The factors relevant to the Mosley analysis are (1) whether\n\nthe suspect was informed of his right to remain silent before the initial questioning; (2) whether the\n\nsuspect was informed of his right to remain silent before the subsequent questioning; (3) the length\n\nof time between initial questioning and subsequent questioning; (4) whether the subsequent\n\nquestioning focused on a different crime; and (5) whether police scrupulously honored the suspect’s\n\ninitial invocation of the right to remain silent. Maestas v. State, 987 S.W.2d 59, 62 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1999). We have also emphasized that “whether a resumption of questioning is consistent with\n\f                                                                                                   38\n\n‘scrupulously honoring’ the right to remain silent depends on the unique facts and circumstances of\n\neach case.” Id. at 63.\n\n       We may quickly dispose of the first, second, and fourth Mosley factors. As appellant\n\nconcedes and the record reflects, he was advised of his right to remain silent before both his Wharton\n\nand Harris County interviews. Thus, Mosley’s first and second factors weigh in favor of a finding\n\nthat the officers scrupulously honored his right to silence. Because the questioning by Sgts. Chappell\n\nand Bush in Wharton County and by Officer Avila in Harris County related to the same offense, we\n\nfind that the fourth Mosley factor weighs against a finding that law enforcement scrupulously\n\nhonored appellant’s invocation of his right to silence.\n\n       We now turn to Mosley’s third factor: the length of time that passed between Sgts.\n\nChappell’s and Bush’s initial questioning of appellant in Wharton County and Officer’s Avila’s\n\nsubsequent request to interview appellant in Harris County. The trial court found that roughly three\n\nhours passed between these two events. Appellant offered no contrary evidence at the suppression\n\nhearing. We note that in Mosley itself, “an interval of more than two hours” passed between the\n\ninitial and subsequent questioning at issue. 423 U.S. at 104. Moreover, the Supreme Court\n\ndescribed this interval as “the passage of a significant period of time.” Id. at 106. Because the\n\npassage of almost three hours in appellant’s case exceeds the “significant period of time” in Mosley,\n\nthe third Mosley factor weighs in favor of a finding that law enforcement “scrupulously honored”\n\nappellant’s right to cut off questioning.\n\n       On appeal, appellant argues that we should discount this significant interval because he was\n\nin the presence of HPD officers for the entirety of that period and thus “never removed from an\n\ninterrogation environment.” We do not find appellant’s argument persuasive. The trial court\n\f                                                                                                                    39\n\nexpressly found that Sgts. Bush and Chappell “concluded their interview with [appellant] in Wharton\n\nCounty at approximately 2:12 [a.m.]” and then drove him to the HPD homicide. This finding\n\nimplies that Sgts. Bush and Chappell engaged in no further questioning of appellant after departing\n\nWharton County for Harris County. The record supports this implicit finding, and accordingly, we\n\ndefer to it. Romero, 800 S.W.2d at 543. Both Sgts. Bush and Chappell testified that, other than Sgt.\n\nBush responding to a few questions from appellant at the beginning of the ride to Harris County,\n\nneither detective engaged appellant in further conversation, much less interrogation. Sgt. Chappell\n\nfurther testified that appellant fell asleep in the back of the police vehicle during the trip to Harris\n\nCounty. Officer Avila testified that, after transport to Harris County, he did not immediately attempt\n\nto interrogate appellant. Rather, Officer Avila had a Crime Scene Unit officer photograph appellant,\n\ncollect his clothes, and test his hands for gunshot residue.17 Appellant did not dispute the officers’\n\ntestimony. While appellant was certainly in custody during the three-hour interval, there is no\n\nevidence that, during that time, he was subjected to “interrogation” within the meaning of Miranda.\n\nSee Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291, 299 (1980) (“‘Interrogation,’ as conceptualized in the\n\nMiranda opinion, must reflect a measure of compulsion above and beyond that inherent in custody\n\nitself.”). We decline to find that an “interrogation environment” existed during those three hours\n\nbecause there is no evidence that any law-enforcement officer actually tried to interrogate appellant\n\nduring that interval. See id.\n\n         Concerning the fifth and final Mosley factor, i.e., whether police scrupulously honored the\n\n\n\n        17\n             These are the types of activities that the Supreme Court has excluded from the self-incrimination\nprivilege that the Fifth Amendment protects. See Jones v. State, 795 S.W .2d 171, 175 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990)\n(noting the various police practices that the Supreme Court has excluded from the scope of the self-incrimination\nprivilege because they seek only physical evidence, not testimonial confessions of guilt).\n\f                                                                                                       40\n\nsuspect’s initial invocation of the right to remain silent, appellant focuses on the trial court’s finding\n\nthat Sgts. Chappell and Bush did not scrupulously honor appellant’s Wharton County invocation.\n\nBut the trial court’s finding is not dispositive of appellant’s second point of error, given the unique\n\nfacts and circumstances of this case. See Maestas, 987 S.W.2d at 63. The trial court also found that\n\nOfficer Avila scrupulously honored appellant’s invocation of the right to counsel by immediately\n\nterminating the Harris County interview when appellant invoked that right. Rather than giving his\n\nHarris County statement to Officer Avila because he failed to scrupulously honor appellant’s\n\ninvocation of his Miranda rights, appellant gave his statement to Officer Avila despite the officer’s\n\nscrupulous honoring of appellant’s Miranda rights. Officer Avila read appellant his Miranda rights\n\nand then immediately terminated the interview when appellant invoked his right to counsel.\n\nAppellant then re-initiated discussion of his case with Officer Avila, who read him his rights again,\n\nand appellant expressly waived them. Only then did Officer Avila interview appellant about the\n\noffense and obtain the statement at issue. Point of error two is overruled.\n\n        In point of error three, appellant alleges that the trial court erred in admitting his Harris\n\nCounty statement because Officer Avila intentionally dishonored appellant’s invocation of the right\n\nto counsel. Citing Oregon v. Bradshaw, 462 U.S. 1039, 1045–46 (1983) (plurality op.), appellant\n\nfocuses on one line of Officer Avila’s hearing testimony: after terminating the first interview and\n\nturning off the videotape, Officer Avila re-entered the interview room to inform appellant about\n\n“what was going to happen to him.” Appellant contends that, under Bradshaw, telling appellant\n\n“what was going to happen to him” was tantamount to Officer Avila re-initiating custodial\n\ninterrogation after appellant had invoked his right to counsel. Invoking Innis, appellant further\n\nasserts that Officer Avila’s response to appellant’s ensuing question—regarding whether appellant’s\n\f                                                                                                    41\n\nten-year-old son would have to testify—was a statement that Officer Avila should have known\n\nwould elicit an incriminating response. Appellant’s arguments have no merit.\n\n       Initially, Bradshaw is inapposite. In that case, the Supreme Court “clarified the Edwards rule\n\nand established a two-step procedure to determine whether a suspect has waived his previously\n\ninvoked right to counsel.” Cross v. State, 144 S.W.3d 521, 526–27 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004)\n\n(discussing Bradshaw’s import). Bradshaw did not concern what words or actions by police officers\n\nmay rise to the level of “interrogation” within the meaning of Miranda. Rather, Innis squarely\n\naddressed that issue and thus represents the applicable authority.\n\n       But appellant’s reliance on Innis is likewise unavailing. In Innis, police officers arrested the\n\ndefendant in connection with the death, by shotgun blast, of a taxicab driver. 446 U.S. at 293–94.\n\nAfter officers read Innis his Miranda rights, he invoked his right to counsel. Id. at 294. The officers\n\ndid not thereafter attempt to question Innis. Id. at 294–95. But while they were transporting him\n\nfrom the arrest site to the police station, two officers engaged each other in a conversation within\n\nInnis’s hearing. Id. During that conversation, the officers discussed the missing shotgun, noting the\n\npresence in the neighborhood of a school for handicapped children and expressing their concerns\n\nover what might happen if any of the children discovered the weapon. Id. Innis interrupted the\n\nconversation, telling the officers to turn the car around so that he could show them the location of\n\nthe missing shotgun. Id. at 295. The officers drove Innis back to the scene of his arrest. Id. After\n\nreceiving an additional set of Miranda warnings, Innis stated that he understood those rights but\n\n“wanted to get the gun out of the way because of the” school children. Id. Innis then led officers\n\nto the hidden shotgun. Id. The trial court denied Innis’s subsequent motion to suppress the shotgun\n\nand his statements to police regarding it. Id. at 295–96. But the state supreme court set aside Innis’s\n\f                                                                                                      42\n\nconviction on the grounds that the officers had subjected him to “‘subtle coercion’ that was the\n\nequivalent of ‘interrogation’” under Miranda. Id. at 296–97.\n\n        The Supreme Court disagreed. It first clarified that “interrogation” for Miranda purposes\n\nmeans express questioning or “its functional equivalent”: “[A]ny words or actions on the part of the\n\npolice (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are\n\nreasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.” 446 U.S. at 300–01 (internal\n\nfootnote omitted). But the Court also noted that police “surely cannot be held accountable for the\n\nunforeseeable results of their words or actions.” Id. at 302–03. Considering the facts of Innis’s case,\n\nthe Court rejected the notion that the police officers, through their conversation in Innis’s hearing,\n\nhad subjected him to the functional equivalent of interrogation under Miranda. Id. at 302. The\n\nconversation between the officers was brief, as opposed to a “lengthy harangue”; their comments\n\nwere not particularly “evocative”; and there was nothing in the record to suggest that the officers\n\nwere aware that Innis was particularly susceptible to an appeal to his conscience concerning the\n\nsafety of handicapped children. Id. at 302–03. In short, the Court concluded, it “[could not] say that\n\nthe officers should have known that it was reasonably likely that Innis would so respond.” Id. at 303.\n\n        Turning to the record before us, we discern no conduct by Officer Avila that approaches even\n\nthe level of “subtle coercion” that the Supreme Court, in Innis, found not to represent interrogation\n\nfor Miranda purposes. His uncontradicted testimony was that he re-entered the interview room after\n\nterminating the interview and leaving the room to turn off the videotape and that his general purpose\n\nwas “to inform [appellant] of the process, what was going to happen to him.” When asked\n\nspecifically what he said to appellant, Officer Avila testified, “I told him that I was going to call for\n\na marked unit to come and pick him up and take him to the city jail while—so we could contact the\n\f                                                                                                      43\n\ndistrict attorney and run the case.” Officer Avila agreed that by “run the case,” he meant “get the\n\ncharge filed.” Officer Avila’s brief statement to appellant was not one that could reasonably be\n\nexpected to elicit an incriminating response. To the extent Officer Avila mentioned that appellant\n\nwould be transported to the jail, his Avila’s statement is akin to a question normally attendant to\n\narrest and custody, which is excluded from the self-incrimination privilege that the Fifth Amendment\n\nprotects. See Jones, 795 S.W.2d at 175. To the extent Officer Avila referred to the fact that the\n\npolice would pursue charges against appellant, we cannot conclude that he could have reasonably\n\nexpected the statement to elicit an incriminating response. See United States v. Collins, 683 F.3d\n\n697, 703 (6th Cir. 2012) (“An accurate statement made by an officer to an individual in custody\n\nconcerning the nature of the charges to be brought against the individual cannot reasonably be\n\nexpected to elicit an incriminating response.”); United States v. Payne, 954 F.2d 199, 202 (4th Cir.\n\n1992) (“[T]he Innis definition of interrogation is not so broad as to capture within Miranda’s reach\n\nall declaratory statements by police concerning the nature of the charges against the suspect and the\n\nevidence relating to those charges.”); Plazinich v. Lynaugh, 843 F.2d 836, 839 (5th Cir. 1988) (“It\n\nis difficult to conceive . . . that the informational comment made to a defendant can be so\n\n‘overrreaching’ as to violate the spirit of Edwards.”). We conclude that Officer Avila did not initiate\n\nan interrogation within the meaning of Miranda by making this statement.\n\n       Officer Avila testified that, after he told appellant about his pending transport to the city jail\n\nand that he would present the case to the district attorney, appellant asked whether his “10-year-old\n\nson was going to have to go to court and testify.” Officer Avila responded that “there was a\n\npossibility that [appellant’s son] might have to do that.” Appellant then “said that he had changed\n\nhis mind and he wanted to give a statement.” Officer Avila, whom the trial court found to be a\n\f                                                                                                                     44\n\ncredible witness, asserted that this exchange represented the entirety of the conversation that he had\n\nwith appellant before restarting the videotape. We decline to “propound a rule that police officers\n\nmay not answer direct questions even in the most cursory and responsive manner.” United States\n\nv. Taylor, 985 F.2d 3, 8 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n         Further, although Sgt. Chappell testified that, during the interview in Wharton County,\n\nappellant showed some concern over the prospect of his son having to testify at trial, he also testified\n\nthat he did not tell Officer Avila anything regarding appellant’s concern.18 Sgt. Chappell also stated\n\nthat he and Officer Avila did not, at any time, watch appellant’s videotaped Wharton County\n\nstatement together. Officer Avila testified that, before interviewing appellant in Harris County, he\n\nhad only Sgts. Chappell’s and Bush’s brief synopsis of their Wharton County interview with\n\nappellant. He did not recall that the synopsis included information about appellant showing concern\n\nover his son having to testify. Officer Avila testified that he learned that information only after\n\ntaking appellant’s Harris County statement.               Appellant offered no contrary evidence at the\n\nsuppression hearing. We cannot conclude that Officer Avila could have reasonably expected the\n\nstatement to elicit an incriminating response. Point of error three is overruled.\n\n         In point of error four, appellant argues that the trial court reversibly erred in admitting any\n\nof appellant’s Wharton and Harris County statements at trial because the magistrate judge violated\n\nArticle 15.17. Specifically, appellant contends that the magistrate violated Article 15.17 because she\n\ndid not cause the magistration to be recorded and because she “told [appellant that] appointed\n\ncounsel would not be provided.”\n\n\n        18\n             The portion of the videotaped statement in which appellant expressed concern about his son testifying\nfell within the segment of State’s Exhibit 8 that was excluded from evidence, pursuant to appellant’s motion to\nsuppress.\n\f                                                                                                      45\n\n        Concerning the failure to record the magistration, the state argues that appellant failed to\n\nargue at trial that his statements were inadmissible on this basis, and therefore failed to preserve the\n\nissue for appeal. We have reviewed the record, which reflects that appellant did not raise the failure-\n\nto-record argument in either his written motion to suppress or in his arguments at the hearing on the\n\nmotion to suppress. While we agree that appellant failed to preserve this argument for our review,\n\nTEX . R. APP . P. 33.1(a), in the interest of completeness, we will address appellant’s claim.\n\n        The allegation that the magistrate “told [appellant that] appointed counsel would not be\n\nprovided” lacks merit. As we discussed in point of error one, we reject appellant’s characterization\n\nof the magistrate’s statements regarding the appointment of counsel in Wharton County. The record\n\nsupports a finding that the magistrate simply and accurately stated an administrative fact: that Harris\n\nCounty, rather than Wharton County, would handle the appointment of counsel, should appellant\n\nrequest it.\n\n        Further, even assuming for purposes of argument that the magistrate’s statement could be\n\nconsidered error under Article 15.17, it was cured when appellant received the requisite\n\nadmonishments regarding the provision of counsel from Sgt. Chappell before being interviewed in\n\nWharton County. Alternatively, the error was harmless, as it did not affect appellant’s substantial\n\nrights. See TEX . R. APP . P. 44.2 (b). Point of error four is overruled.\n\n                                Admission of Autopsy Photograph\n\n        In point of error five, appellant contends that the trial court erred when, over appellant’s Rule\n\n403 objection, it admitted State’s Exhibit 158 into evidence at the guilt-innocence phase during Dr.\n\nAlbert Chu’s testimony. See TEX . R. EVID . 403. Dr. Chu, an assistant medical examiner at the\n\nHarris County Institute of Forensic Sciences, testified that he performed Desirae’s autopsy and that\n\f                                                                                                     46\n\nthe photograph represented by State’s Exhibit 158 depicted an incision he made to the left side of\n\nDesirae’s back during the procedure. Dr. Chu told the jury that he made the incision to retrieve a\n\nbullet that had entered Desirae’s body from the front, penetrated her sternum, hit her heart and left\n\nlung, and lodged in the tissue on the left side of her back. Dr. Chu further testified that he submitted\n\nthe bullet he recovered from the incision to the firearms laboratory for comparison to any weapon\n\nrecovered in the case. On appeal, appellant complains that the photograph was “repetitious and\n\ngruesome.”\n\n         Rule 403 requires that a photograph possess some probative value and that its inflammatory\n\nnature does not substantially outweigh that probative value. Williams v. State, 301 S.W.3d 675, 690\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2009); Long v. State, 823 S.W.2d 259, 272 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991). In ruling on\n\na Rule 403 objection, the trial court must “consider the inherent tendency that the evidence may have\n\nto encourage resolution of material issues on an inappropriate emotional basis.” Narvaiz v. State,\n\n840 S.W.2d 415, 429 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992) (internal quotations and alterations omitted). The trial\n\ncourt must then balance that inherent tendency, if any, against “the host of factors affecting\n\nprobativeness, including the relative weight of the evidence and the degree to which its proponent\n\nmight be disadvantaged without it.” Id. Rule 403 favors the admission of relevant evidence and\n\npresumes that relevant evidence will be more probative than prejudicial. Rayford v. State, 125\n\nS.W.3d 521, 529 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003); Hayes v. State, 85 S.W.3d 809, 815 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2002).\n\n         In determining whether the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs a photograph’s\n\nprobative value, a court may consider many factors. Williams, 301 S.W.3d at 690. These include:\n\nthe number of such photographs the proponent offers; their gruesomeness; their level of detail; their\n\f                                                                                                     47\n\nsize; whether they are in color or black-and-white; whether they are close-ups; whether they depict\n\na clothed versus a naked body; the availability of other means of proof; and other circumstances\n\nunique to the individual case. Id. “It is also relevant for the trial court to consider whether the body\n\nas photographed has been altered since the crime in some way (e.g., by autopsy) that might enhance\n\nits gruesomeness to the defendant’s detriment.” Narvaiz, 840 S.W.2d at 429. Autopsy photographs\n\nare generally admissible unless they do not aid the fact finder in determining the injuries alleged to\n\nhave been inflicted by the defendant, but rather emphasize solely mutilation of the victim caused by\n\nthe autopsy itself. See Williams, 301 S.W.3d at 690. Further, “changes rendered by the autopsy\n\nprocess are of minor significance if the disturbing nature of the photograph is primarily due to the\n\ninjuries caused by the appellant.” Hayes, 85 S.W. 3d at 816. We review for an abuse of discretion\n\na trial court’s decision to admit photographs over an objection. Williams, 301 S.W.3d at 690.\n\n       During Dr. Chu’s testimony, the state moved to admit a total of six photographs taken at\n\nDesirae’s autopsy, including State’s Exhibit 158. Appellant objected to State’s Exhibit 158 under\n\nRule 403, on the grounds that the photograph was “overly grotesque.” The state countered that the\n\nphotograph represented by State Exhibit 158 was the only one that showed the recovery of that\n\nparticular bullet from Desirae’s body and that the bullet was sent to the firearms laboratory and\n\nultimately matched to the pistol found in appellant’s vehicle. After reviewing the other photographs\n\nfrom Desirae’s autopsy, the trial court overruled appellant’s objection, stating that the court found\n\nthe exhibit relevant and that its probative value substantially outweighed its potential for unfair\n\nprejudice.\n\n       The photograph in question is in color, measures roughly eight-and-a-half by eleven inches,\n\nand is not a close-up view. Moreover, it is only one of a small number of photographs of Desirae’s\n\f                                                                                                     48\n\nautopsy shown to the jury and the only one portraying this specific view. Although Desirae’s body\n\nis shown unclothed and a small portion of her buttocks is visible at the bottom of the frame, that is\n\nnot the focus of the photograph, which is overwhelmingly clinical in nature. Dr. Chu’s neat surgical\n\nincision appears slightly above the middle of the photograph. Although the record does not reveal\n\nthe scale of the photo, the incision appears to be no more than a few inches long. Dr. Chu’s gloved\n\nfingers are visible, using forceps to retract the skin to more clearly reveal a bullet lodged in the\n\nexposed tissue. Although pink and darker red tissue are visible within the incision site, as is a bullet\n\nslug, the wound is not bloody. Contrary to appellant’s characterization, the incision with the skin\n\npulled away slightly is not especially gruesome. To the extent that the photograph is disturbing, it\n\nis because of the injury that appellant inflicted on Desirae by shooting her. The alteration to her\n\nbody caused by the autopsy, in an effort to retrieve the fatal bullet, pales in significance. See Hayes,\n\n85 S.W.3d at 816.\n\n        The trial court was well within its discretion to find that the photograph’s probative value\n\nsubstantially outweighed its potential for unfair prejudice. Point of error five is overruled.\n\n                    Cross-examination of Punishment-phase Defense Witness\n\n        In points of error six through eight, appellant challenges the trial court’s ruling that allowed\n\nthe state to cross-examine defense witness Frank Aubuchon regarding a statistical report generated\n\nby TDCJ’s Emergency Action Center (EAC). Specifically, in points of error six and seven, appellant\n\nargues that the trial court should have sustained his objections to the state’s line of questioning as\n\nirrelevant and unfairly prejudicial under Rule 403. In point of error eight, appellant contends that,\n\nby allowing the state to question Aubuchon regarding the report, the trial court violated his Eighth\n\nAmendment right to an individualized sentencing determination. See Woodson v. North Carolina,\n\f                                                                                                    49\n\n428 U.S. 280, 304 (1976) (plurality op.).\n\n       Aubuchon testified on direct examination that he had worked for TDCJ in inmate\n\nclassification, at the unit level, for many years. At the time of trial, he made a living testifying in\n\ncourt concerning TDCJ’s prisoner-classification procedures and security measures. Aubuchon\n\ntestified that there were then 111 TDCJ units, with a maximum capacity of approximately 160,000\n\noffenders. He told the jury that TDCJ facilities are divided into five different security levels, with\n\nlevel five (i.e., maximum security) units being the most secure and level one (“trustee camps”) being\n\nthe least secure. Within those maximum-security units, Aubuchon explained, there are two\n\npopulations of inmates: those in “general population” and those in administrative segregation, a\n\nmore restrictive custody environment.       Inmates in general population are assigned custody\n\nclassifications on a scale that runs from G-1 to G-5, with G-5 being the most restrictive custody class\n\noutside of placement in administrative segregation.\n\n       Aubuchon testified that, if sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, appellant would\n\nbe assigned to one of the eighteen maximum-security units within the TDCJ system, which he\n\ndescribed as being large facilities housing approximately 2,000 inmates each. Aubochon described\n\nin detail the construction and security measures in place at such facilities. He asserted that all\n\nmovement within the maximum-security units is well contained and controlled. Although inmates\n\nare not always individually escorted within the units, all inmates are always within sight, sound, or\n\ncamera view of correctional staff. Aubuchon further testified that, assuming that appellant was\n\nassigned to general population, he could never achieve a less-restrictive custody classification than\n\nG-3, which Aubuchon characterized as “very restrictive.” For example, Aubochon asserted that, as\n\na G-3 inmate, appellant would be limited to working in the kitchens and laundry because he could\n\f                                                                                                   50\n\nnot be assigned to jobs providing him access to vehicles, tools, or loading docks or to jobs involving\n\ncontact with non-uniformed female employees such as doctors, nurses, or teachers. Aubuchon also\n\nasserted that prison staff make virtually all decisions regarding where an inmate may go within the\n\nunit and when. When an inmate is not assigned to be at work, he may choose to spend time in the\n\nrecreation area, day room, or his cell, according to the schedule for his particular cell block.\n\nAubuchon also told the jury that TDCJ was in the process of installing closed-circuit television\n\nmonitors throughout its facilities so that there would be no place where an inmate could be without\n\nbeing subject to remote monitoring and recording. At the conclusion of direct examination, defense\n\ncounsel engaged Aubuchon in the following colloquy:\n\n       Q.      Is TDCJ a perfect prison system?\n       A.      No, sir.\n       Q.      Is there any perfect prison system that you know of?\n       A.      No, sir.\n       Q.      Based on the time that you worked and what you know about the prison\n               system, is it a pretty good one?\n       A.      Tremendous strides have been made in the last 30 years from going to convict\n               guards to where we are now.\n       Q.      Is it a fairly secure place?\n       A.      I believe so.\n\n       On cross-examination, the state probed Aubuchon’s testimony concerning the restrictions\n\nattendant upon G-3 classified inmates. The state elicited testimony supporting a reasonable inference\n\nthat, even as a G-3 classified inmate, appellant would have opportunities and the means by which\n\nto commit violent acts. The state then focused on Aubuchon’s testimony that, although not a perfect\n\nsystem, TDCJ was “a fairly secure place”: “[Defense counsel] asked you whether [TDCJ] was\n\nperfect and you said no, but you feel like it’s fairly safe, right?” Aubuchon responded, “Yes,\n\f                                                                                                                       51\n\nma’am,” agreeing with or adopting the prosecutor’s interpretation of his earlier testimony.19 At this\n\npoint, the prosecutor began to inquire into Aubuchon’s familiarity with the statistical prison-crime\n\nreports generated by EAC, specifically those generated for the current year.\n\n         The inquiry prompted a bench conference at which defense counsel objected to the state\n\nbeing allowed to question Aubuchon regarding the specific number of various offenses listed in the\n\nreport. The defense argued that appellant “should be sentenced based upon his conduct and not the\n\nconduct of other prisoners” and that to allow questioning about the specific number of offenses was\n\nunfairly prejudicial under Rule 403.\n\n         The trial court “agreed . . . 100 percent . . . that the jury [was] to consider [appellant] and his\n\nconduct and not the conduct of others.” But, it elaborated:\n\n         I think that there has been an effort by the defense, and certainly understandable, to\n         educate the jury on where [appellant] would be housed, what kind of security levels\n         it might [entail], and things he’s allowed to do, and essentially suggested through this\n         witness that—based on the answer to the last question that it’s a fairly safe place[.]\n         I think if the State is in possession of information that calls that opinion to be\n         questioned or at least [gives] the jury some other information to consider in\n         evaluating that answer, I think that the rules allow that.\n\nAfter entertaining additional argument, the trial court overruled the defense’s objection, finding that\n\nthe state’s line of cross-examination regarding the EAC statistics was relevant and that its probative\n\nvalue was not outweighed by any unfair prejudice. It granted appellant a running objection.\n\n\n\n         19\n              W e recognize that “safe” and “secure” are, sometimes but not always, synonyms. “S AFE , SECU RE may\nboth imply that something can be regarded as free from danger. These words are frequently interchangeable. S AFE ,\nhowever, is applied rather to a person or thing that is out of or has passed beyond the reach of danger. The ship is\nsafe in port. S ECU RE is applied to that about which there is no need to fear or worry: to feel secure about the future; .\n. ..” W ebster’s Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language 1259-60 (1989).\n          In the prison context, “safe” may mean that inmates are free from danger, while “secure” can mean that\ninmates are free from danger or that the physical boundaries of the prison cannot be breached by escape. It appears\nfrom the record that the state used “safe” as a synonym for “secure.”\n\f                                                                                                                           52\n\n         The state continued its cross-examination regarding the EAC statistics. It elicited testimony\n\nthat in the month of August 2011, TDCJ recorded 1760 serious20 or “unusual” incidents within its\n\nsystem. Although there were no escapes or attempted escapes reported, there had been 108\n\npossessions of weapons; twenty-four alleged sexual assaults; three serious staff assaults; 127 serious\n\noffender assaults; and forty-one “chunkings.”21 It elicited testimony that, year-to-date, TDCJ had\n\nrecorded 12,550 serious or unusual incidents: 731 weapons possessions; 239 alleged sexual assaults;\n\nfifty-eight serious staff assaults; 864 serious offender assaults; and 278 chunkings. Aubuchon agreed\n\nthat despite the measures TDCJ had taken or might take, incidents still occurred and would continue\n\nto occur. The state then left the subject of the EAC report and resumed questioning Aubuchon about\n\nthe restrictions on G-3 classified inmates and the opportunities and means those inmates have to\n\ncommit violent acts, despite those restrictions.\n\n         On redirect, the defense attempted to counter Aubuchon’s cross-examination testimony\n\nregarding the EAC reports. In response to defense questioning, Aubuchon testified that the EAC\n\nstatistics did not surprise him because there have always been some serious incidents occurring\n\nwithin the penitentiary. Aubuchon opined that, if anything, the ratio of serious incidents to inmates\n\nreflected in the report was surprisingly low given that 56% of inmates are in TDCJ for violent, “3g”\n\noffenses.22 Aubuchon further noted that the EAC statistics reflect only the total number of incidents,\n\n\n\n         20\n            Aubuchon agreed that “serious” staff and offender assaults were those that required more than first aid\nand did not reflect the minor assaults that occurred within the TDCJ system.\n\n         21\n            Aubuchon defined “chunking” as the act of an offender mixing a variety of fluids and solids (generally,\nurine and feces) and sometimes other material and throwing the mass into the hands or face of a correctional officer.\n\n         22\n             See Plummer v. State, 410 S.W .3d 855, 861 n.42 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013) (defining “3g” offenses as\nthose set forth in Article 41.12, section 3(g)(a)(1), and noting that “[a]lmost all of these listed offenses are violent\nacts involving physical threat or harm.”).\n\f                                                                                                   53\n\nwithout regard to whether the same inmate may be responsible for multiple incidents. Aubuchon\n\nacknowledged that even an inmate in administrative segregation could engage in criminal conduct.\n\nBut he also noted that appellant, who had been housed in administrative segregation while in the\n\nHarris County jail, had no record of committing assaultive conduct during his detention.\n\n       On recross-examination, the state elicited testimony that, despite what Aubuchon\n\ncharacterized as a low ratio of violence to the total number of inmates, three homicides had occurred\n\nwithin TDCJ in the current year to date. Aubuchon also acknowledged that, given his experience\n\nand the number of violent offenders in TDCJ, it would not have surprised him for the number of\n\nserious incidents to be higher. Aubuchon further acknowledged that he could not know whether\n\nappellant would engage in assaultive behavior in TDCJ. On re-redirect examination, Aubuchon\n\nopined that TDCJ’s security controls worked and were responsible for the “low” incidence of\n\nviolence relative to the number of inmates.\n\n       Although appellant contends that the state’s line of questioning was not relevant under Rule\n\n403, we perceive no error in the trial court’s contrary conclusion. Rule 403 requires that the\n\nevidence at issue be both relevant and not unfairly prejudicial. See TEX . R. EVID . 403. “Relevant\n\nevidence” is “evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence\n\nto the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the\n\nevidence.” TEX . R. EVID . 401. At the punishment phase of appellant’s capital-murder trial, the court\n\ntasked the jury with determining, inter alia, whether there was a probability that appellant would\n\ncommit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society. See Art.\n\n37.071, § 3(b)(1). It is well established in our case law that “society” includes both prison and free\n\nworld. Lucio v. State, 351 S.W.3d 878, 903 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011). Evidence regarding whether\n\f                                                                                                     54\n\nthe prison environment offers opportunities for violence was relevant to the jury’s future-\n\ndangerousness determination, as was evidence concerning the efficacy of TDCJ’s measures to\n\ncontrol such opportunities. Here, such evidence was introduced by defense counsel. The state was\n\ntherefore entitled to probe Aubuchon’s definition of “fairly secure.” Point of error six is overruled.\n\n       In point of error seven, appellant asserts that the state’s line of questioning regarding the EAC\n\nreport was unfairly prejudicial under Rule 403. In point of error eight, he contends that such\n\nquestioning denied him the individualized sentencing determination guaranteed by the Eighth\n\nAmendment. Appellant’s arguments have no merit. The trial court did not permit the state to\n\nquestion Aubuchon regarding specific incidents of conduct by other inmates, nor did it allow the\n\nstate to suggest that appellant was responsible for any of the incidents reflected in the EAC report.\n\nCf. Ex parte Lane, 303 S.W.3d 702, 712 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009) (criticizing the prosecution for\n\nattempting to persuade the jury to convict the applicant based on an uncharged offense for which he\n\nwas not on trial). Rather, the court limited the state to questioning Aubuchon about raw data\n\nconcerning broad categories of offenses committed inside TDCJ and the frequency with which they\n\noccurred, in response to Aubuchon’s assertion that TDCJ was a fairly secure or safe place. This was\n\nneither unfairly prejudicial under Rule 403 nor a denial of an individualized sentencing\n\ndetermination as guaranteed by the Eighth Amendment. Points of error seven and eight are\n\noverruled.\n\n                                         Denial of Mistrial\n\n       In point of error nine, appellant argues that the trial court reversibly erred at the punishment\n\nphase when it denied his motion for a mistrial. Appellant asserts that a mistrial was warranted\n\nbecause the state “fabricated a death threat by misstating the evidence during [its] closing” argument.\n\f                                                                                                                55\n\nThe mistrial motion arose from the final sentence of the following portion of the prosecution’s\n\nargument:\n\n                Ladies and gentlemen, on February 3rd, 2010, [appellant] walked out of Ms.\n        Boyd’s office and drove to Bass Pro Shop. His [therapy] appointment ended at 1:45.\n        And at 1:40 p.m. [sic] on February 3rd, 2010—the receipt is there, look at it—at 2:40\n        p.m., he was standing at the register [of Bass Pro Shop] with this (indicating).23 And\n        not just this, but a box of hollow-point ammunition. One hour after he walked out\n        of Therapist Boyd’s office.\n\n                We don’t know what happened that night. We know the kids were there\n        visiting. Did he sit around and think about what he was going to do? Because if you\n        don’t know by now that it was in his mind to do [it] the day before, I don’t know\n        what else we can show or tell you. Everything tells you that he did this and he knew\n        he was going to do it. And if you don’t know just from these facts, you can look at\n        his character and his past and know.\n\n                He took this gun and he went home. And the next day, after enjoying, I\n        guess, an evening with his sons, he took them home to their mother. And on the way,\n        he stopped at Chili’s. And at Chili’s, he told Piero: If something happens to your\n        mother and I—if your mother ends up dead in other words, and I go to prison—\n\n        Defense counsel interjected: “Objection. Improper argument, Judge. Not supported by the\n\nfacts.” The trial judge sustained the objection, telling the prosecutor to “[s]tay in the record.”\n\nDefense counsel moved the trial court to instruct the jury to disregard. The trial judge granted the\n\nrequest, directing the jury to “disregard the last statement of the prosecutor.” Defense counsel then\n\nmoved for a mistrial, but the trial court denied the motion. The prosecutor continued, without\n\nobjection from defense counsel:\n\n        Well, let me quote it. [Appellant] said: If something happens to your mother and I,\n        to his 10-year-old son, you are to go live with your Aunt Carina. And he said that\n        less than two hours from when he stood on [Melissa’s] doorstep and killed her.\n\n\n\n        23\n            The record shows that appellant bought the pistol linked to the shootings, which was entered into\nevidence, at Bass Pro Shop. Based on that and the prosecutor’s subsequent reference to “this gun,” we presume that\nthe prosecutor was indicating that pistol during this portion of her argument.\n\f                                                                                                     56\n\n                 I’m sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but what do you think that is? What do you\n         think that is?\n\n         Appellant contends that the statement at issue was solely an “[explanation] to one’s child that\n\nhe would be cared for if anything happened to his parents.” He asserts that the state attempted to\n\nturn the statement into a “death threat” against Melissa, when that argument did not represent a\n\nreasonable inference from the evidence. Therefore, appellant contends, the prosecutor’s argument\n\nwas improper. Appellant further alleges that the trial court’s instruction for the jury to disregard the\n\nstatement was inadequate to cure the damage to his substantial rights, and thus, a mistrial was in\n\norder.\n\n         We have repeatedly stated that, even when the prosecution mentions facts outside the record\n\nduring argument, an instruction to disregard will generally cure the error. See, e.g., Freeman v. State,\n\n340 S.W.3d 717, 727–28 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011); Gamboa v. State, 296 S.W.3d 574, 580 n.12 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2009). Here, Piero Cole’s actual testimony was that, shortly before the shootings,\n\nappellant said to him: “If me [sic] or your mom dies, you would go live with your Aunt Corina.”\n\nThe prosecutor’s argument—which interpreted appellant’s words in the context of evidence\n\nsuggesting that his actions were premeditated—represented a reasonable inference from the\n\nevidence. But even assuming that the state’s argument was improper, it was “not so extreme as to\n\nrender ineffective an instruction to disregard.” Martinez v. State, 17 S.W.3d 677, 691 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2000). Point of error nine is overruled.\n\n                        Constitutionality of Article 37.071, Section 2(b)(1)\n\n         In points of error eleven and twelve, appellant argues that Article 37.071, § 2(b)(1), is\n\nunconstitutional on its face and as applied to him because the future-dangerousness special issue\n\f                                                                                                      57\n\nlowers the state’s burden of proof to a probability. Specifically, appellant alleges that Article 37.071,\n\n§ 2(b)(1), violates the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution\n\nand Article I, §§ 3, 10, 13, and 19 of the Texas Constitution. As appellant acknowledges, we have\n\nrepeatedly overruled such challenges to Article 37.071, § 2(b)(1). See, e.g., Rayford v. State, 125\n\nS.W.3d 521, 534 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003); Robison v. State, 888 S.W.2d 473, 481 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1994). Appellant does not persuade us to revisit these issues. Points of error eleven and twelve are\n\noverruled.\n\n                           Limitation of Appellant’s Closing Argument\n\n        In point of error thirteen, appellant alleges that the trial court impermissibly “limited [his]\n\npresentation of mitigating evidence during closing argument” when it sustained the state’s objections\n\nto certain aspects of his punishment-phase argument. Appellant contends that the trial court violated\n\nthe Eighth Amendment because it “limited the mitigation evidence appellant was able to present and\n\nlimited the evidence the jury believed [it] could consider.”\n\n        Appellant’s argument has no merit. The parties did not embark on closing argument until\n\nthe evidentiary portion of the punishment trial was complete. There was no evidence to introduce\n\nor “present” during closing argument. See Johnson, 286 S.W.3d at 353 n.13 (counsel’s arguments\n\nto the fact finder are not evidence). The trial court’s rulings at issue could not have limited\n\nappellant’s presentation of mitigating evidence, which was already complete before closing argument\n\neven began.\n\n        Further, the jury charge clearly instructed the jury that it must consider “all the evidence”\n\nsubmitted to it during the entire trial in answering the special issues. We presume that juries follow\n\nthe trial court’s instructions. See Casanova v. State, 383 S.W.3d 530, 543 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012)\n\f                                                                                                    58\n\n(usual presumption on appeal is that jurors follow trial court’s explicit instructions to the letter).\n\nAppellant contends that, by sustaining the state’s objections and instructing the jury to disregard\n\ndefense counsel’s arguments, the trial court somehow caused the jury to believe that it could not\n\nconsider certain evidence for purposes of answering the mitigation special issue. But his argument\n\nis speculative and inadequate to overcome the presumption that the jury followed the trial court’s\n\nexpress instructions to consider all of the evidence in answering the special issues. See id. Point of\n\nerror thirteen is overruled.\n\n        In point of error fourteen, appellant alleges that, by sustaining the state’s objections to his\n\nclosing argument, the trial court denied him his right to counsel. “Although we have held that\n\nimproper denial of a jury argument may constitute a denial of the right to counsel, this holding\n\nassumes that the jury argument is one the defendant is entitled to make.” Davis v. State, 329 S.W.3d\n\n798, 825 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010); see McGee v. State, 774 S.W.2d 229, 238 (Tex. Crim. App. 1989).\n\nProper jury argument generally falls within one of four areas: (1) summation of the evidence; (2)\n\nreasonable deduction from the evidence; (3) answer to the argument of opposing counsel; or (4) plea\n\nfor law enforcement. Freeman, 340 S.W.3d at 727.\n\n        The first sustained objection of which appellant complains arose when defense counsel noted\n\nthe emotion that appellant’s biological mother, Sonya, and younger sister, Corina, showed when they\n\ntestified. Earlier in his closing argument, defense counsel had discussed the circumstances of\n\nappellant’s adoption by the Coles. Counsel had emphasized Sonya’s reluctance to part with her son\n\nand the emotional pain that appellant and his biological family had experienced as a result of the\n\nseparation. After discussing other topics, defense counsel returned to the subject of appellant’s\n\nadoption, reemphasizing the emotional pain it caused and commenting on the love that appellant’s\n\f                                                                                                     59\n\nbiological family had for him:\n\n        You could see when [Corina] and her mother, Sonya, testified [about] the impact that\n        that whole situation back from 1978 [when the Coles adopted appellant] had upon\n        the family. You know—because I saw y’all see it—that finally you saw some\n        emotion in [appellant] when his sister showed her emotion about him.\n\n(Emphasis added). The state objected after defense counsel uttered the italicized portion of the\n\nstatement, on the grounds that the statement was outside the record. At the state’s request, after\n\nsustaining the objection, the trial court instructed the jury to “disregard the last statement.” On\n\nappeal, appellant contends that defense counsel was arguing that appellant felt remorse for killing\n\nthe two victims and that remorse for the crime is relevant to the mitigation special issue. He asserts\n\nthat, by sustaining the objection, the trial court thwarted defense counsel’s attempt to draw the jury’s\n\nattention to mitigating evidence and thus denied appellant his right to counsel.\n\n        We perceive no error in the trial court’s decision to sustain the state’s objection. Initially,\n\nthe record does not support appellant’s assertion concerning the purpose of defense counsel’s\n\nargument—that it was an attempt to persuade the jury that appellant felt remorse for killing the two\n\nvictims. It is clear from the preceding sentence—“You could see when [Corina] and her mother,\n\nSonya, testified [about] the impact that that whole situation back from 1978 had upon the\n\nfamily”—that counsel was returning to the subject of appellant’s adoption, in a renewed attempt to\n\nemphasize the emotional pain that the separation caused appellant and his biological family. It was\n\nnot an attempt by defense counsel to argue that appellant had shown remorse for the killings. The\n\ntrial court could not have deprived defense counsel of an argument that counsel was not attempting\n\nto make.\n\n        Moreover, defense counsel’s statement during closing argument was neither a plea for law\n\f                                                                                                   60\n\nenforcement nor was it an answer to the state’s argument. Further, defense counsel’s statement\n\ncannot reasonably be deemed a summary of the evidence or a reasonable deduction from the\n\nevidence because “[t]his sort of argument constitutes no evidence at all.” Cf. Good v. State, 723\n\nS.W.2d 734, 736 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986). Appellant’s demeanor during his sister’s testimony was\n\nnot evidence subject to reference or allusion by defense counsel. In Good, over objection, the trial\n\ncourt permitted the prosecutor to argue to the jury that the defendant’s orderly demeanor during the\n\ncomplainant’s testimony was probative, inter alia, of the defendant’s lack of remorse for the offense.\n\nId. at 735. In reversing the conviction, we explained that the defendant’s nontestimonial demeanor\n\n“was not evidence subject to reference by the prosecutor” because “[i]t was not offered into evidence\n\nthrough any legally recognizable method of proof.          Allowing the state to summarize [the\n\ndefendant’s] non-testimonial demeanor impermissibly placed [the defendant’s] demeanor before the\n\njury through the prosecutor’s unsworn jury argument. This sort of argument constitutes no evidence\n\nat all.” Id. at 736 (internal citation omitted).\n\n        We see no reason that this conclusion should not apply equally when the defense attempts\n\nto argue that a defendant’s demeanor during the testimony of another witness is probative of the\n\ndefendant’s remorse for the offense—especially where, as here, the defendant does not elect to\n\ntestify. A contrary rule would allow defendants, through their counsel’s jury argument of their\n\ncounsel, to use the right to silence as both a shield and a sword, which we do not permit. See United\n\nStates v. Hastings, 461 U.S. 499, 515 (1983) (Stevens, J., concurring) (protective shield of the Fifth\n\nAmendment should not be converted into a sword); Wehling v. Columbia Broadcasting System, 608\n\nF.2d 1084, 1087 (5th Cir. 1979) (“The plaintiff who retreats under the cloak of the Fifth Amendment\n\ncannot hope to gain an unequal advantage against the party he has chosen to sue. To hold otherwise\n\f                                                                                                                       61\n\nwould, in terms of the customary metaphor, enable plaintiff to use his Fifth Amendment shield as\n\na sword. This he cannot do.”); Texas Dep’t of Pub. Safety Officers Ass’n v. Denton, 897 S.W.2d\n\n757, 760–61 (Tex. 1995) (regarding the Fifth Amendment privilege, plaintiff cannot eat his cake and\n\nhave it, too).\n\n         After the trial court sustained the state’s objection to defense counsel’s statement about\n\nappellant’s demeanor during Corina’s testimony, counsel returned to the subject of the testimony\n\ngiven by Sonya. Counsel argued that Sonya’s testimony showed how important appellant was to his\n\nEcuadoran family. Counsel then acknowledged that, despite how deeply appellant may have affected\n\nhis Ecuadoran family, his actions on the day of the offense had also deeply affected “a lot of people.”\n\nCounsel asserted, “Nobody here is minimizing that, but I ask you to ask yourselves this question:\n\nWhat impact does the death penalty have upon [appellant’s] boys?” The state objected to the\n\nquestion posed by defense counsel on the grounds that it constituted an improper argument. The trial\n\ncourt sustained the objection.\n\n         Relying on Ayers v. Belmontes, 549 U.S. 7, 10 (2006), appellant argues that defense counsel’s\n\nquestion attempted to draw the jury’s attention to “forward-looking mitigation evidence,” i.e.,\n\nappellant’s “potential to continue to be a positive influence in [his sons’] lives.” We reject this\n\ncontention. Defense counsel’s question expressly asked the jury to focus on the impact appellant’s\n\nexecution would have on his sons, rather than evidence that appellant was committed to being a good\n\nfather to his sons in the future.24 The trial court’s decision to disallow such argument was within the\n\nzone of reasonable disagreement. Cf. Williams v. State, 270 S.W.3d 112, 139 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n\n\n         24\n             Further, we note that appellant does not direct us to any testimony in the record regarding appellant’s\nintention to be a good father to his sons in the future, nor does our review reveal any.\n\f                                                                                                   62\n\n2008) (trial court does not abuse its discretion by excluding execution-impact testimony).\n\n       Appellant next complains that the trial court improperly sustained the state’s objection at the\n\nend of the following portion of defense counsel’s closing argument:\n\n       I don’t think I ever mentioned that when [appellant] left the scene in that truck he had\n       OnStar. And don’t you know that he knew he had OnStar? And don’t you know that\n       he knew he would be found and caught? And he had his son with him. After the\n       worst 15 to 30 seconds in his entire life, he turned around because little Lucas was\n       saying: Daddy, Daddy, and he turned around and picked him up. And that can be\n       mitigating. Okay? There was no Amber Alert, there was no kidnapping. He just\n       wanted to be with his son a few more minutes before he was caught. And I guarantee\n       you he absolutely knew he was going to be caught. And now here he is.\n\n(Emphasis added.) The state objected on the grounds that “all of that” was “outside the record.”\n\nAppellant argues that the italicized portion of the above-quoted passage nonetheless constituted a\n\nreasonable inference from the evidence. We are not persuaded that the trial court’s ruling fell\n\noutside the zone of reasonable disagreement.\n\n       An attorney may make reasonable deductions from the evidence so long as the argument is\n\nsupported by the evidence and offered in good faith. Andujo v. State, 755 S.W.2d 138,144 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1988). Defense counsel’s statement concerned appellant’s internal thought processes,\n\nsomething to which only appellant would normally be privy unless he told someone else. But\n\nappellant did not testify at either phase of the trial to offer the jury an explanation for taking the\n\ntoddler with him. To the extent appellant alluded to Lucas in the videotaped statements he gave to\n\npolice, it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to conclude that defense counsel’s\n\ninference was unreasonable. In the portion of his Wharton County statement that was admitted into\n\nevidence, appellant mentions Lucas once, near the end of the statement, asking for Lucas’s present\n\nlocation. In his Harris County statement, appellant describes Lucas approaching him in the parking\n\f                                                                                                    63\n\nlot immediately after the shooting and relates that he picked up the child and put him in the truck.\n\nLater, appellant states that, when he took the money from his employer, he was thinking that he\n\nwanted to find a place for Lucas, did not want anything to happen to the child, and wanted to leave\n\nLucas with someone, but no one was around. From this evidence, it is not a reasonable deduction\n\nthat appellant wished to keep the child with him for just a little while longer.\n\n        We next consider appellant’s challenge to the trial court’s ruling regarding the following\n\ndefense argument:\n\n                [I] want to tell you what a wonderful experience it’s been to represent\n        [appellant] because obviously [co-counsel] and I . . . have spent hours and hours with\n        [appellant]. And I think that I have learned is [sic] I recognize what all the other\n        people recognize in [appellant] in the time that they knew him.\n                Now, maybe I have not known him for five years, maybe I didn’t work with\n        him on a daily basis, but I’m pretty darn familiar with him since [the] middle of\n        February of 2010. And I see why grown men, coworkers—\n\n        The state objected that defense counsel’s argument was outside the record. The trial court\n\ndid not rule on the objection, instead stating only, “No personal opinion, [counsel].” Appellant\n\ncontends that defense counsel has the same right as the prosecutor to argue his opinion if that opinion\n\nis based on the evidence. See Felder v. State, 848 S.W.2d 85, 95 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992) (prosecutor\n\n“may argue his opinions concerning issues in the case so long as the opinions are based on the\n\nevidence in the record and not as constituting unsworn testimony”). We perceive no abuse of\n\ndiscretion by the trial court in disallowing the argument. Defense counsel’s objected-to argument\n\nwas not based on evidence offered and admitted at trial. Rather, it was based upon counsel’s\n\npersonal interactions with the defendant and the conclusions defense counsel reached about appellant\n\nas a result of that contact.\n\n        Finally, appellant challenges the trial court’s ruling regarding defense counsel’s argument\n\f                                                                                                                64\n\nthat, “The death penalty should be the last drastic step, that you have to take somebody’s life. There\n\nshould be nothing more that you could possibly do with somebody. You have to give him the death\n\npenalty because there is nothing else we can do with this guy.” The state objected that counsel’s\n\nargument misstated the law. The trial court sustained the objection. Contrary to appellant’s\n\nassertion, counsel’s statement did not accurately summarize the death-selection process under Texas\n\nlaw. See Art. 37.071, § 2(b) & (e). The trial court did not abuse its discretion by sustaining the\n\nstate’s objection. Point of error fourteen is overruled.\n\n                          Constitutionality of Article 37.071, Section 2(f)(4)\n\n        In point of error fifteen, appellant argues that Article 37.071, section 2(f)(4), limits the jury’s\n\nconsideration of all mitigating evidence, in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to\n\nthe United States Constitution and Sections 13 and 19 of Article I of the Texas Constitution. In point\n\nof error sixteen, appellant contends that Section 2(f)(4) is unconstitutional under these same federal\n\nand state constitutional provisions because it requires the jury to find a nexus between the\n\ncommission of the crime and any mitigating evidence. Appellant acknowledges that we have\n\npreviously rejected such facial challenges to Section 2(f)(4),25 but invites us to revisit our precedent.\n\nWe decline to do so. Points of error fifteen and sixteen are overruled.\n\n        In point of error seventeen, appellant alleges that Section 2(f)(4) is unconstitutional as applied\n\nto him because of the constitutional infirmities alleged in points of error fifteen and sixteen.\n\nAppellant contends that the jury charge and the state’s closing argument exacerbated these alleged\n\nconstitutional deficiencies because they required the jury to restrict its consideration of any\n\n\n\n        25\n            See Coble v. State, 330 S.W .3d 253, 296 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010); Roberts v. State, 220 S.W .3d 521, 534\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2007); Perry v. State, 158 S.W .3d 438, 449 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004).\n\f                                                                                                     65\n\nmitigating evidence to that which reduced his moral blameworthiness for committing the capital\n\nmurder.\n\n        Appellant’s argument has no merit. The record shows that the trial court’s jury charge\n\nincluded the definition of mitigating evidence required by Section 2(f)(4). As discussed above, we\n\nhave previously rejected appellant’s constitutional challenges to Section 2(f)(4). Coble, 330 S.W.3d\n\nat 296; Roberts, 220 S.W.3d at 534; Perry, 158 S.W.3d at 449. There was thus no constitutional\n\ninfirmity for the state’s argument to aggravate. Further, we have reviewed the portion of the state’s\n\nclosing argument of which appellant complains. We reject appellant’s contention that the state\n\nattempted to limit the kind of evidence to which the jury could give mitigating effect. Rather, we\n\nthink the state’s argument was reasonably understood by the jury as an assertion that, whatever\n\nmitigating effect the jury chose to give to the evidence before it, the mitigating effect was simply not\n\nenough to warrant a sentence of life without parole. Point of error seventeen is overruled.\n\n        We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\nDelivered: June 18, 2014\nDo Not Publish\n\f",

Art. 37.071 §\n\n2(g).1 Direct appeal to this Court is automatic. Art. 37.071 § 2(h). Appellant raises seventeen points\n\nof error.     After reviewing appellant’s points of error, we find them to be without merit.\n\n\n       1\n            Unless otherwise indicated, all future references to Articles refer to the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n\f                                                                                                        2\n\nConsequently, we affirm the trial court’s judgment and sentence of death.\n\n                      Sufficiency of the Evidence—Future Dangerousness\n\n        In point of error ten, appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury’s\n\naffirmative answer to the future-dangerousness special issue. Art. 37.071, § 2(b)(1). We shall\n\naddress this issue first, followed by the remaining points of error in the order presented in the briefs.\n\n        The future-dangerousness special issue requires the jury to determine “whether there is a\n\nprobability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a\n\ncontinuing threat to society.” Art. 37.071, § 2(b)(1). When reviewing the legal sufficiency of the\n\nevidence supporting an affirmative answer to the future-dangerousness special issue, we review the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to the verdict.

Assessing the evidence and\n\nall reasonable inferences therefrom in this light, we determine whether any rational trier of fact could\n\nhave believed beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a probability the defendant would commit\n\ncriminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society.

The jury may also consider a variety of factors, including: (1) the circumstances of the\n\ncapital offense, including the defendant’s state of mind and whether he was working alone or with\n\nother parties; (2) the calculated nature of the defendant’s acts; (3) the forethought and deliberateness\n\nexhibited by the crime’s execution; (4) the existence of a prior criminal record; (5) the defendant’s\n\nage and personal circumstances at the time of the offense; (6) whether the defendant was acting\n\f                                                                                                                   3\n\nunder duress or the domination of another when he committed the crime; (7) psychiatric evidence;\n\nand (8) character evidence.

An escalating pattern of violence or disrespect\n\nfor the law may also support a finding of future dangerousness.2 A lack of remorse or evidence that\n\na defendant planned to kill again may likewise support a finding of future dangerousness.3 The\n\nfuture-dangerousness special issue focuses upon the character and internal restraints of the particular\n\nindividual, rather than the external institutional restraints of incarceration.

Crim. App. 2010). With these principles in mind, we turn to the evidence\n\nplaced before the jury at both phases of appellant’s capital murder trial.\n\n        At the guilt phase, the state presented evidence that appellant committed the instant offense\n\nshortly after 8:00 p.m. on February 4, 2010. Appellant and his wife, Melissa Cole, had been\n\nexperiencing marital strife in the weeks preceding the killings. About a month before the shootings,\n\nMelissa moved herself, the couple’s two young sons (Piero, age ten, and Lucas, age two) and her\n\ndaughter from a prior relationship (Alecia “Desirae” Castillo, age fifteen) from the family home into\n\na small apartment.\n\n        Following the move, Piero and Lucas continued to have contact with appellant, spending two\n\ndays a week with him. The boys had been staying with appellant for the two days immediately\n\n\n        2\n          Swain v. State, 181 S.W .3d 359, 370 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005); King v. State, 953 S.W .2d 266, 271 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 1997).\n\n        3\n          Smith v. State, 74 S.W .3d 868, 872 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002); Rachal v. State, 917 S.W .2d 799, 806 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 1996).\n\f                                                                                                                      4\n\npreceding the killings. Piero testified that appellant seemed normal during this time and that he did\n\nnot see appellant consume any alcohol.4 Shortly before returning the boys to Melissa that evening,\n\nappellant took them out to eat. During the meal, appellant drank two beers. Appellant, who had\n\npurchased a .22-caliber semi-automatic pistol the previous afternoon, told Piero during the meal that\n\nif appellant or Melissa died, Piero should live with appellant’s biological sister in Ecuador.5\n\n         When returning the boys after their visits, appellant usually called Melissa from the\n\napartment complex’s parking lot to inform her that the children were back, but he did not enter the\n\napartment. On the evening of the murders, however, appellant parked his truck and went inside with\n\nthe boys. Desirae and Melissa were in the apartment. Chloe Mahalec, Melissa’s nine-year-old niece\n\nwho often visited the family, was also present.\n\n         Appellant and Melissa began arguing in Melissa’s bedroom. After Desirae complained about\n\nthe noise, appellant and Melissa went outside. The children remained inside the apartment. As the\n\nadults’ argument grew louder, Desirae pounded on the inside of the front door several times, telling\n\nappellant and Melissa to be quiet. When Melissa began to scream, “Help me, help me,” in fear,\n\nDesirae opened the front door, again telling appellant and Melissa to be quiet. Desirae and Chloe\n\nsaw appellant shooting Melissa, who collapsed in the front doorway. Appellant continued firing at\n\nMelissa when she was on the ground.\n\n         Chloe ran to the kitchen to hide from appellant. Lucas stayed where he was, sitting on the\n\nfloor between the hall and entry to the kitchen, crying. Desirae fled to the back bedroom. Piero hid\n\n\n         4\n           At trial, appellant argued that alcohol use played a central role in the offense, as well as in his past\nnegative behavior.\n\n         5\n          The record shows that appellant was born in Ecuador. W hen he was roughly ten years old, Hazel and Jim\nCole adopted him and brought him to the United States.\n\f                                                                                                                      5\n\nin the bathroom attached to the same bedroom. From inside the bathroom, Piero heard four or five\n\n“clicks” from the bedroom, and from her hiding spot in the kitchen, Chloe twice heard Piero yell,\n\n“No.” When Piero opened the bathroom door, he saw Desirae lying on the bedroom floor on her\n\nside. Appellant was in the bedroom, holding a pistol and retrieving shell casings.6 Without looking\n\nat or speaking to Piero, appellant removed the magazine from the pistol, pocketed it, and ran out of\n\nthe bedroom, still holding the pistol. Appellant pointed the pistol at Chloe, but it only went “click-\n\nclick” instead of “boom-boom.”\n\n         Piero ran for help, but both Melissa and Desirae died at the scene. Two-year-old Lucas,\n\nmeanwhile, followed appellant to the parking lot. Appellant put Lucas in the front seat of his truck.\n\nWithout restraining the child, appellant drove through the apartment complex at high speed and\n\nrammed his truck through the automatic gate without waiting for it to fully open. Appellant went\n\nto his workplace, where he took $1,400 in cash from the safe and looked unsuccessfully for a vehicle\n\nto exchange for his truck. Appellant then headed south on U.S. Highway 59, a major corridor\n\nbetween Houston and Mexico.\n\n         That same evening, Sgt. Chappell issued an “Amber Alert” for Lucas. Jose Mena, the Texas\n\nDepartment of Public Safety (DPS) trooper who responded to the alert, apprehended appellant at\n\napproximately 11:00 p.m. inside a Wharton County Walmart. Appellant, who had Lucas with him\n\ninside the store, had just purchased 100 rounds of .22 caliber ammunition, as well as diapers and\n\nsome food items. Because he had heard that appellant had shot and killed two people, Trooper Mena\n\napproached appellant from behind, with his service weapon drawn, as appellant was leaving the\n\n\n\n        6\n           Although investigators recovered a total of seven spent shell casings from the crime scene, they did not\nrecover any from the back bedroom where appellant shot Desirae.\n\f                                                                                                                    6\n\nstore. When Trooper Mena seized appellant and instructed him not to move, a bystander removed\n\nLucas from appellant’s shopping cart and took him inside the store. Appellant was arrested without\n\nfurther incident.\n\n         In appellant’s truck, investigators found a large hunting knife inserted between the driver’s\n\nseat and center console. Underneath the console, with the magazine inserted, they found appellant’s\n\n.22 semi-automatic pistol. The magazine was empty, and no bullet was in the chamber. On the\n\npassenger-side floorboard, investigators found a loaded shotgun and four bags containing the cash\n\nfrom appellant’s employer.\n\n         The state’s firearm examiner, Joseph Colca, testified that the magazine had a ten-cartridge\n\ncapacity; with a bullet chambered, plus a full magazine, the weapon’s total firing capacity without\n\nreloading was eleven rounds.7 He also told the jury about the multiple safety features that appellant\n\nhad to override to fire the weapon.\n\n         Following his arrest, appellant was taken before a magistrate in Wharton County and\n\ninformed of his constitutional rights. Before being transported to Harris County, appellant gave a\n\nvideotaped statement to Houston Police Department (HPD) Sergeants Robert Chappell and William\n\nBush, both of whom testified that appellant’s general demeanor while in Wharton County was\n\n“angry” and that he did not appear intoxicated. The trial court admitted part of the Wharton County\n\nstatement as State’s Exhibit 8A, which was published to the jury. In that statement, appellant\n\nasserted that the shootings were “not planned,” but also asserted that the “kids weren’t supposed to\n\nsee.” Appellant also stated that, if things had gone right, he would have been dead already because\n\n\n\n        7\n           The autopsies revealed that appellant shot Melissa and Desirae eleven times, expending the entire clip\nplus a chambered round.\n\f                                                                                                   7\n\nhe had wanted the police to catch him or shoot him. Appellant said that he would have killed\n\nhimself, but he had no bullets.\n\n       In Harris County, appellant gave a second videotaped statement to HPD Officer Xavier Avila,\n\nwhich was admitted into evidence as State’s Exhibit 9 and published to the jury. Appellant stated\n\nthat he and Melissa were fighting over money and whether the marriage had any chance of\n\ncontinuing. Appellant hoped for a legal separation, but Melissa wanted a divorce. Appellant\n\nasserted that Melissa was complaining that she was “broke,” although he had been depositing money\n\nfor her into an account ever since she moved out. Appellant also stated that Melissa was impatient\n\nbecause he had not yet obtained their tax refund, which she wanted to use to pay for a divorce. They\n\nargued, and he started crying because Melissa would not agree to a separation rather than a divorce.\n\nDesirae came to the door of the bedroom, telling them that they were being too loud, so they went\n\noutside.\n\n       Appellant said that he had the pistol with him in his waistband and had been carrying it for\n\nthe last couple of days for protection and because it helped him sleep. When Melissa said that she\n\ndid not want to again discuss the possibility of a separation, appellant pulled the pistol from his\n\nwaistband, cocked it, and shot her from a very short distance. Appellant asserted that he did not\n\nknow how many times he shot Melissa. After Melissa collapsed, appellant stepped over her, went\n\nto the back bedroom, and shot Desirae, who had been in the background “screaming at [him]” while\n\nhe shot Melissa. Appellant asserted that he had not planned any of the violence. Appellant stated\n\nthat he shot his wife because he was “angry and frustrated about the way everything was going.”\n\nRegarding Desirae, appellant claimed that he shot her in a moment of anger. When he shot Desirae,\n\nappellant was aware that Chloe was in the adjacent kitchen and that Piero was somewhere in the\n\f                                                                                                      8\n\nsame bedroom.\n\n        The autopsies revealed that Melissa had been shot nine times: once in the head, six times\n\nin the chest and abdomen, and twice in her right arm. The shot to her head and a contact-shot to her\n\nabdomen were immediately life-threatening. Three of the remaining wounds to her chest and\n\nabdomen were potentially fatal. The wounds to her arm were inflicted at very close range and were\n\nconsistent with pushing the barrel of the gun away. At least six of the bullets traveled in a downward\n\ntrajectory through her body, consistent with testimony that appellant continued to fire at Melissa after\n\nshe had fallen to the ground. Desirae sustained two gunshot wounds to the torso, either one of which\n\ncould have been the cause of death. Both bullets traveled in a downward trajectory, consistent with\n\nappellant firing at Desirae from above.\n\n        At the punishment phase, the jury heard evidence concerning appellant’s interactions with\n\nfemale intimate partners, family members, friends, coworkers, and strangers. It additionally heard\n\nevidence regarding appellant’s criminal history before and after the instant offense, as well as\n\nevidence concerning his prior bad acts and character.\n\n        Leticia Leal testified that she and appellant dated off and on through high school and for a\n\nfew years beyond graduation. Leal recalled that the relationship was good at first, but deteriorated\n\nover time. In the spring of 1989, after graduation, appellant and Leal were dating other people but\n\ntrying to remain friends. Appellant entered the K-Mart store where Leal was working and said hello\n\nwhen he saw her. The encounter was initially friendly, but Leal indicated that she could not continue\n\ntalking because she was working. Appellant, however, did not leave. Appellant saw that Leal had\n\na hickey on her neck, became upset, and wanted to discuss it. Leal repeated that she could not talk\n\nto him then and headed to the store’s back warehouse. Appellant followed Leal into the warehouse\n\f                                                                                                      9\n\narea, pushed her against a wall, and grabbed her by the neck. Appellant did not release Leal until\n\nher coworker intervened and told appellant to leave. Leal, who had at first been shocked and then\n\nfrightened by the assault, left work after the incident.\n\n        Either the same night or the next day, appellant drove to the home where Leal lived with her\n\nparents and sisters. Leal stayed inside while one of her sisters called the police. Another sister, Ann,\n\nwho was pregnant, went outside. Appellant, who had a handgun, grabbed Ann. Leal’s father and\n\nbrother-in-law tackled appellant, took the weapon away, and told appellant to leave. Leal made a\n\npolice report, but appellant’s mother, Hazel Cole, convinced her not to pursue charges.\n\n        Collete Rives testified that she met appellant in 1988 when they were both high school\n\nseniors and working at the same place. After a few months, they began dating. Like Leal, Rives\n\ntestified that the relationship with appellant was initially good. After about five months of dating,\n\nshe became pregnant by appellant. Rives and appellant were not dating when she subsequently\n\nlearned of the pregnancy and informed appellant. Appellant told Rives that “he would pay for it but\n\nnot claim [the child].” Appellant was not present when his daughter, Brittnie, was born in April\n\n1990, did not provide child support until ordered by a court to do so, and did not spend much time\n\nwith Brittnie, even after appellant and Rives reconciled in April or May 1992. When Rives became\n\npregnant again in June 1992, appellant insisted that Rives terminate the pregnancy.\n\n        Appellant and Rives split again, but had reconciled by late July or early August 1993 when\n\nRives learned that she was pregnant by appellant with their son, James. This time, appellant\n\npromised to stay with Rives. In September 1993, when Rives’s pregnancy was two months along,\n\nthey spent the evening at the bar run by appellant’s mother, Hazel. They then went to Hazel’s house,\n\nwhere they were spending the night. Rives and appellant argued. Rives did not take any physical\n\f                                                                                                 10\n\naction against appellant. Appellant, however, who knew Rives was pregnant, suddenly punched her\n\nhard in the stomach. The blow hurt, and Rives lay down on the bed and began to cry. Besides being\n\nin pain, Rives was very concerned about the unborn baby. After hitting her, appellant lay down on\n\nthe bed and went to sleep, although he apologized the next day.\n\n       Rives stayed in a relationship with appellant until they broke up again a few days before\n\nNovember 24, 1993. At that date, Rives was about four-and-a-half months along and visibly\n\npregnant. Carl Freeman was appellant’s longtime friend and neighbor. While dating appellant, Rives\n\nhad frequently spent time with Freeman and his girlfriend. On November 24, Rives visited Freeman\n\nand his girlfriend at Freeman’s house. Appellant knocked at the front door, asking to talk to Rives.\n\nWhen Rives went to the door, appellant asked her about a diamond ring that he had given her,\n\nwanting it back. When Rives said that she did not have the ring with her, appellant grabbed her arm\n\nand forced her outside. He took Rives over to his Chevy Blazer, which was parked in Freeman’s\n\ndriveway, and bent her on her back over the hood. Appellant put his left hand across Rives’s chest\n\nto hold her down, reached for a shotgun with his right hand, and held it to Rives’s forehead. Rives\n\nstruggled with appellant and cried for help. Appellant did not say anything, but just looked angry.\n\nRives feared that appellant was going to shoot her. They struggled over the shotgun until appellant\n\nput the weapon down and swung Rives forcefully across the yard. Appellant then came over to\n\nwhere Rives landed and kicked her repeatedly in the stomach.\n\n       Freeman testified that he came running from the house in response to Rives’s cries. He\n\nknocked appellant down when appellant was kicking Rives, and he yelled for Rives to get to the\n\nhouse and call 9-1-1. Freeman saw Rives enter the house. When Freeman turned back to appellant,\n\nappellant was pointing a 12-gauge shotgun at him. Freeman told appellant that if appellant was\n\f                                                                                                                  11\n\ngoing to shoot him, appellant would have to shoot him in the back. Freeman turned around and\n\nquickly walked back to the house. Freeman heard a shot behind him and was terrified.8 Freeman\n\nand Rives waited inside the house until several police cruisers arrived. Rives and Freeman both gave\n\nstatements to the police. Rives received medical treatment and was released after a determination\n\nthat the baby was unharmed.\n\n         Appellant was arrested and indicted for two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly\n\nweapon. But Rives reconciled with appellant, and he persuaded her to sign “a piece of paper” so that\n\nhe would not go to jail. Appellant told Rives that if he were in jail, he could not help her with the\n\nchildren. Appellant also apologized and promised that he would not ever do it again. Rives testified\n\nthat she did not knowingly agree to drop the charges against appellant; by signing the document, she\n\nthought that she was merely agreeing that he should not go to jail. Rives believed at the time that\n\nappellant should be punished in some way for what he had done, but she did not want that\n\npunishment to include jail time.\n\n         Freeman testified that Hazel called him within one week of the incident. Following the\n\nconversation with Hazel, Freeman called the police department and asked to drop the charges against\n\nappellant. The charges against appellant were reduced from aggravated assault with a deadly weapon\n\nto the offense of terroristic threat. Appellant pleaded guilty to the reduced charge on August 26,\n\n1994.\n\n         Rives testified that no physical abuse occurred between the incident at Freeman’s house and\n\n\n        8\n            Thomas Tolson was the first patrol officer to arrive at the scene. Tolson testified that Rives, who was\npregnant, was upset and crying, holding her side, and had visible scratches on her arm; Freeman was also upset and\nagitated. Tolson further testified that a spent shotgun shell for a 12-gauge shotgun was recovered from the scene.\nHe stated that the shell would have had to have been actively “racked” in the shotgun before being fired, implying\nthat the shotgun did not discharge accidentally.\n\f                                                                                                     12\n\nthe birth of James in April 1994. But in November 1994, appellant and Rives traveled to Ecuador\n\nfor her to meet his biological family. A physical incident occurred there after Rives and appellant\n\nspent the evening at a bar. Rives testified that, although she and appellant both drank alcohol that\n\nevening, she was not drunk. She could not say whether appellant was intoxicated. After returning\n\nto their sleeping quarters at appellant’s aunt’s house, appellant became very angry and hit Rives\n\ntwice in the stomach. Although the blows hurt and she was very upset, Rives lay down on the bed\n\nbecause she had nowhere to go if she left the premises. Appellant stayed in the room and did not say\n\nanything. The next morning, he apologized.\n\n        Appellant hurt Rives again in March 1995, when Rives and Hazel threw a small surprise\n\nparty for him at Hazel’s bar. Appellant initially seemed happy at the party, but matters changed\n\nwhen a physical altercation developed between two patrons. Appellant moved outside with the\n\ncombatants and stood next to them, talking to them. Hazel asked Rives to get appellant away from\n\nthe place, and Rives yelled at appellant, “Let’s go.” Eventually, appellant joined Rives at her car.\n\nRives was standing outside the car on the passenger side, facing outward, with the door open.\n\nAppellant grabbed Rives by the arm, told her never to yell at him like that in front of his friends, and\n\npushed her backward. After Rives fell back into the seat with her feet still on the ground, appellant\n\nslammed the car door across her legs. Rives testified that having the door slammed against her legs\n\nhurt and that she still bore an indentation in one leg from the incident. Afterward, Rives told\n\nappellant that he needed help and if he ever hit her again, she would leave him. Rives testified that\n\nappellant went to counseling, but she did not know for how long.\n\n        Appellant hit Rives again six months later, in September 1995, when the two traveled to San\n\nFrancisco on a business trip. On the first night there, appellant became drunk and punched Rives\n\f                                                                                                  13\n\nin the stomach several times when she would not have sexual intercourse with him. Although the\n\npunches hurt and she was scared, Rives did not leave because appellant took her plane ticket and\n\nmoney. When they returned to Houston, Rives ended the relationship.\n\n       Rives testified that when appellant was physically abusive he would also be verbally abusive.\n\nFor example, he would tell Rives that no one would want her because she had two children and was\n\nnot married. Rives also testified that appellant’s violence was not just directed at her. She and\n\nappellant went to Hazel’s bar frequently, and while there, Rives saw appellant engage in more than\n\none bar fight. The fights ensued when appellant felt that someone had disrespected him. Rives\n\ntestified that appellant would react to perceived disrespect by getting angry.\n\n       The state presented additional evidence concerning appellant’s participation in fights through\n\nthe testimony of two police officers who arrested appellant in September 1993 and June 1997 for\n\npublic intoxication and disorderly conduct. Both arrests stemmed from reports of fighting. The\n\narresting officer for the 1993 incident reported that appellant was intoxicated and abusive. The\n\narresting officer for the June 1997 incident reported that appellant was highly intoxicated, shouted\n\nobscenities, and exhibited an aggressive demeanor. The jury also heard testimony that appellant had\n\nbeen convicted in 1991 for Driving While Intoxicated (DWI).\n\n       Appellant’s daughter, Brittnie Rives, was twenty-one when she testified at his trial. Before\n\nthe age of fourteen, Brittnie visited appellant twice a month and recalled when he began dating and\n\nlater married Melissa. Brittnie lived with the couple from age fourteen to seventeen, when she\n\nmoved out of appellant’s home.\n\n       Brittnie testified extensively regarding appellant’s manner of disciplining her. She testified\n\nthat appellant had sometimes administered appropriate discipline. But most of the time, appellant\n\f                                                                                                    14\n\nwould become very violent and aggressive when he punished her. When Brittnie was six years old\n\nand in appellant’s care, he became locked out of his residence one evening. The garage door was\n\nopen slightly and appellant wanted Brittnie to squeeze through the space, go through the garage to\n\nthe laundry room, enter the house, and let him in. Brittnie was afraid to enter the garage because it\n\nwas dark and contained snakes, spiders, and bugs. When Brittnie resisted appellant’s directive, he\n\ntried to force her under the garage door. In the process, appellant pushed Brittnie face-first into the\n\nconcrete. Brittnie sustained painful scratches to her face when it hit the concrete. When Brittnie was\n\nbetween seven and eight years old, appellant threw her down a hallway and she received carpet burns\n\nwhen she skidded to a stop. When Brittnie was in high school, appellant would choke her, grab her\n\nunder her arm and throw her, and use physical force to restrain her. When she was fourteen to fifteen\n\nyears old, appellant threw Brittnie into a television set as a way of disciplining her. The force that\n\nappellant used re-tore ligaments that Brittnie had previously torn while playing soccer.\n\n       Appellant provided alcohol and marijuana to Brittnie and her friends and drank and smoked\n\nwith them. After one such occasion, Brittnie was drunk, asleep on the couch, and alone at home with\n\nappellant. When she woke briefly during the night, appellant was on top of her, fondling her genitals\n\nunder her pants. Brittnie went back to sleep, but confronted appellant the next morning. Appellant\n\ndenied the accusation several times, but when Brittnie said that she would tell someone if he did it\n\nagain, appellant said, “Okay,” and asked her not to tell Melissa.\n\n       Appellant sometimes turned on Melissa when she interfered with his disciplining of Brittnie.\n\nOn one of these occasions, appellant pinned Melissa against a wall. Brittnie testified that she\n\nwitnessed many negative interactions between appellant and Melissa. Appellant was usually\n\nintoxicated when he came home and was verbally abusive toward Melissa, calling her “bitch” and\n\f                                                                                                  15\n\n“lazy ass.” He also frequently grabbed Melissa under the arm. In 2004, when Melissa was six\n\nmonths pregnant with Lucas, appellant pinned her against the wall. Brittnie testified that appellant\n\nsometimes moderated his behavior when he was sober, but his violent and abusive conduct was not\n\nlimited to times when he was intoxicated.\n\n       Brittnie testified that she had a good relationship with both Melissa and Desirae and\n\nmaintained it even after moving out of the house at age seventeen to escape from appellant’s abuse.\n\nAbout one week before Melissa moved out, she spoke to Brittnie about “an incident” that had\n\nrecently occurred. Melissa was crying and scared. On the day of the move, Melissa spoke to Brittnie\n\nof a second, intervening incident. As she had been during the previous conversation, Melissa was\n\n“very emotional,” “crying,” and “scared.” Brittnie helped Melissa move. Melissa wanted to leave\n\nthe house quickly, before appellant returned from work, and she took only a minimal amount of\n\nbelongings for herself and the children. Brittnie also testified that she noticed a change in Desirae\n\nin the period preceding the murders. Desirae expressed “a lot of hatred” toward appellant and stayed\n\nin her room or otherwise avoided appellant when he was around.\n\n       Brooke Phillips, Melissa’s sister, testified at the punishment phase and gave similar accounts\n\nof Melissa’s and Desirae’s demeanor and behavior in the time preceding the shootings. Phillips\n\nstated that she discussed personal topics with Melissa and had been aware of her sister’s plan to\n\nmove. Phillips testified that Melissa “cried a lot, . . . [and] was nervous [and] scared” when she\n\ndecided to leave with the children. After the move, Melissa seemed more at ease. Through Phillips\n\nand another witness, the state presented evidence that, in early November 2009, Melissa had\n\nremoved four handguns and a rifle from the family home and pawned them.\n\n       Regarding appellant’s treatment of Desirae, Phillips recalled an incident in 2008 when\n\f                                                                                                    16\n\nDesirae was about thirteen years old. Phillips’s extended family, including Melissa, appellant, and\n\ntheir children, were vacationing together at a property owned by Phillips’s grandmother. One\n\nevening, when they were playing cards on the patio, appellant became angry over something\n\ninnocuous that Desirae said. He jumped from his seat and grabbed Desirae by the upper arm.\n\nDesirae seemed stunned and grew quiet. When Phillips confronted appellant about his behavior, he\n\ndid not respond. As Desirae entered her teenage years, she remained communicative with Melissa\n\nand Phillips, but would withdraw when appellant was around.\n\n       The state additionally presented evidence that in June 2011, while appellant was incarcerated\n\nin the Harris County Jail awaiting trial for capital murder, a routine cell search revealed that he was\n\nhiding contraband pills in a baggy inside a jar of peanut butter. Appellant admitted that he purchased\n\nthe pills from another inmate in administrative segregation and had managed to keep them in his cell,\n\nundetected, for over six months. The discovery of the contraband pills led to appellant’s conviction\n\nfor possession of a controlled substance.\n\n       Appellant’s punishment evidence consisted of testimony from his adoptive and biological\n\nfamily; former coworkers and employees; the psychotherapist who treated him immediately before\n\nthe offense; a psychiatrist; and an expert regarding the system of inmate classification at the Texas\n\nDepartment of Criminal Justice, Criminal Institutions Division (TDCJ). On cross-examination of\n\nappellant’s family and friends, the state elicited evidence that appellant grew up in an extremely\n\nsupportive, loving environment, in which nothing important was lacking, and he was taught right\n\nfrom wrong and how to behave. Both Hazel and Jim Cole admitted that appellant’s temper had\n\ncaused him problems and that they had intervened to smooth things over for him. Jim admitted that\n\nappellant had been fired from two different jobs, once due to appellant’s conflict with a new\n\f                                                                                                    17\n\nmanager. Hazel admitted that appellant could be hot-tempered and had been verbally abusive to her,\n\nalthough he apologized afterward. Hazel also admitted that she had helped appellant try to come up\n\nwith ideas for defending himself against the capital-murder charges. One of those ideas was to\n\ndetermine whether Melissa had drugs in her system when she died.\n\n       On cross-examination of appellant’s former coworkers, the state elicited evidence that cast\n\ndoubt upon appellant’s theory that alcohol abuse or addiction played a pivotal role in appellant’s\n\ncommission of the offense. Appellant was never known to drink on the job or arrive at work\n\nintoxicated, and while working, he functioned at a high level. Despite being sober while at work,\n\nappellant consistently had some difficulty dealing well with customer complaints because he took\n\ncustomer dissatisfaction too personally. The state noted that appellant had physically intimidated\n\na male employee by lifting the employee off his feet by the collar, and he had once reprimanded an\n\nemployee so severely that he reduced the employee to tears. Although appellant sometimes drank\n\nalcohol to excess at company functions, his drinking on those occasions did not stand out to\n\nwitnesses as particularly noteworthy. And even when drinking to excess at those functions,\n\nappellant’s behavior did not turn violent.\n\n       Sharon Boyd, a psychotherapist, testified that she met with appellant on January 26, 2010,\n\nand again on the afternoon of February 3, 2010, the day before the offense. On January 26, when\n\nshe learned that the reason for his visit was a recent marital separation, Boyd evaluated appellant for\n\nhomicidal and suicidal ideation and psychosis. Appellant denied having any such feelings. Boyd\n\nconcluded that appellant was not homicidal, suicidal, or psychotic, although he was mildly depressed\n\nand mildly anxious. Appellant, who then reported one week of sobriety, did not comply with Boyd’s\n\nrecommendations that he attend recovery meetings for alcoholics and enter an outpatient substance\n\f                                                                                                  18\n\nabuse program.\n\n       On the afternoon of February 3, Boyd met with appellant for a second time. At this session,\n\nappellant specifically denied needing any help regarding homicidal or suicidal feelings or psychosis.\n\nAlthough Boyd observed that appellant was tearful, more anxious, and more depressed, she\n\nconcluded that no homicidal or suicidal ideation or psychosis was present. She categorized appellant\n\nas “moderately depressed.” Appellant, who then reported more than two weeks of sobriety, again\n\ndeclined to pursue Boyd’s treatment recommendations, although he scheduled a third appointment\n\nwith her. The session ended at 1:45 p.m. Appellant bought the murder weapon and ammunition less\n\nthan an hour later and committed the murders the next evening.\n\n       Terry Rustin, a psychiatrist appointed to assist the defense, interviewed appellant. Rustin\n\ntestified that appellant, who showed “a great deal of denial” during the interview, was alcohol\n\ndependent as well as an alcoholic. Rustin opined that, at the time of the murders, appellant was\n\nexperiencing an adjustment disorder with a depressed mood stemming from Melissa’s departure.\n\nRustin opined that appellant’s alcohol dependence, alcoholism, and period of abstinence from\n\nalcohol immediately before the shootings, together with appellant’s adjustment disorder, played a\n\nrole in the commission of the offense. Rustin stated that repeated episodes of withdrawal from\n\nalcohol use by an alcoholic leads to “more brain damage and more emotional damage” than staying\n\ncontinuously intoxicated. Rustin asserted that appellant’s alcohol dependence and alcoholism could\n\nbe treated even if appellant were imprisoned. On cross-examination, Rustin testified that appellant\n\nhad poor impulse control, which could either be caused or exacerbated by alcohol abuse. Rustin also\n\nacknowledged that, at the Harris County Jail while awaiting trial, appellant had been discovered in\n\npossession of contraband drugs that would produce intoxicating effects similar to alcohol.\n\f                                                                                                     19\n\n        Through Rustin, appellant successfully offered into evidence the records of his medical\n\ntreatment while in the Harris County Jail awaiting trial for capital murder. The records established\n\nthat appellant admitted to “getting depressed and mad” in jail and that he refused to take medications\n\nprescribed by jail psychiatrists.\n\n        Viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, the foregoing evidence is sufficient to\n\nsustain the jury’s affirmative answer to the future-dangerousness special issue. Initially, we note the\n\ncircumstances of the offense and the events surrounding it. See Devoe, 354 S.W.3d at 462; Hayes,\n\n85 S.W.3d at 814. They support rational inferences of cold calculation, premeditation, and a wanton\n\nand callous disregard for human life. Appellant purchased the murder weapon the day before the\n\nhomicides. See Dinkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1688238\"><a href=\"/opinion/1688238/dinkins-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">894</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 360–61 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995) (concluding that the\n\ndefendant’s purchase of the murder weapon a day before a scheduled meeting with one of the victims\n\nsupported a reasonable inference of pre-planning). Immediately before the shootings, appellant\n\nadvised his ten-year-old son where to live if one or both of his parents died. Appellant also departed\n\nfrom his normal practice of merely dropping the boys off in the parking lot. Instead, appellant\n\nentered the small apartment, which was occupied by Melissa, the teenaged Desirae, and three\n\nchildren aged 10 years and younger, with a fully loaded semi-automatic pistol in his waistband. The\n\nfact that appellant “knowingly and willingly placed himself in, and sought after, circumstances\n\nfacilitating homicide . . . demonstrates a callousness and lack of reflection about taking human life[,]\n\nwhich tends to increase the probability that he is a future danger.” See Rachal, 917 S.W.2d at\n\n807–08.\n\n        Although aware that he was in close proximity to three young children, appellant completely\n\nemptied the pistol’s magazine into his victims, inflicting multiple fatal wounds at close range. See\n\f                                                                                                      20\n\nDinkins, 894 S.W.2d at 360 (“Appellant’s infliction of multiple wounds at close range indicates a\n\nwanton and callous disregard for human life.”). Appellant asserted that he did so because he was\n\n“angry and frustrated.” Even if the jury had been inclined to find that Melissa’s and Desirae’s\n\nmurders represented an isolated incident of rage, it “could [have] rationally conclude[d] from the\n\nresults of appellant’s isolated incident of rage that his rage is of such an uncontrollable and extreme\n\nnature that he is a continuing danger to society.” Sonnier v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">913</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 517 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1995).\n\n        Desirae’s killing is particularly telling. By appellant’s own admission, he stepped over\n\nMelissa’s body, followed Desirae into the back bedroom, and inflicted two mortal wounds because\n\nhe was angry that the teenager was screaming at him. Evidence of such wanton, senseless killing\n\nsupports the inference that appellant is a continuing danger to society. See Coble, 330 S.W.3d at 268\n\n(discussing the future-dangerousness issue’s emphasis on the defendant’s internal restraints);\n\nSonnier, 913 S.W.2d at 517. Given the evidence in the record that (1) Desirae and Chloe both\n\nwitnessed the first shooting, (2) appellant shot and killed Desirae, and (3) appellant pointed his pistol\n\nat Chloe and made it go “click click” instead of “boom boom,” the jury could also reasonably infer\n\nthat appellant killed Desirae to eliminate her as a witness and would have killed Chloe, too, if any\n\nbullets had remained in his pistol. We have previously found killings motivated by the desire to\n\neliminate witnesses to reflect a wanton and callous disregard for life, such that the circumstances of\n\nthe offense are sufficient by themselves to support a finding of future dangerousness. Dinkins, 894\n\nS.W.2d at 360. Alternatively, appellant’s targeted aggression toward the only two children at the\n\nscene who were biologically related to Melissa, but not to him, supports a finding of vicious\n\ncalculation. We conclude that the circumstances of the offense were sufficient to support the jury’s\n\f                                                                                                     21\n\naffirmative answer to the future-dangerousness special issue.\n\n          We also observe that, rather than turning himself in after the shootings, appellant—who later\n\nprofessed a desire that he would be caught and killed by police—fled the scene at high speed with\n\nan unrestrained two-year-old in the vehicle thereby prompting a manhunt, stole a large sum of cash\n\nfrom his employer, and intending to commit “suicide by cop,” bought additional ammunition for his\n\nsemiautomatic pistol. Such actions reflect forethought and intent to avoid capture, as well as a\n\ndisregard for the lives of his pursuers and innocent others, including his own child, Lucas. See\n\nSmith, 74 S.W.3d at 872. The jury could further infer a lack of remorse from appellant’s words and\n\ndemeanor while speaking about the murders to Sgts. Chappell and Bush, a few hours after the\n\nshootings. Appellant appeared angry and expressed no remorse for having killed either of the two\n\nvictims. Although appellant expressed regret that his sons had witnessed the shootings, he did so\n\nwith a slight shrug and the statement, “Shit happens.” Cf. Estrada, 313 S.W.3d at 28 n.9 (jury could\n\nreasonably infer lack of remorse from the evidence of appellant’s demeanor, including his complaint,\n\nnot long after he had brutally murdered his wife and their unborn child, that she “had ruined his\n\nlife”).\n\n          Moreover, appellant had a criminal history that included convictions for DWI in 1991, public\n\nintoxication in 1993 (stemming from fighting), terroristic threat in 1994, and public intoxication and\n\ndisorderly conduct in 1997 (again based on fighting). Although we remain cognizant that each case\n\nmust be determined on its own facts, Estrada, 313 S.W.3d at 284, we have found criminal records\n\nthat are arguably less serious than appellant’s to support a jury’s finding that a probability of future\n\ndangerousness exists. See, e.g., Lucio v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2546978\"><a href=\"/opinion/2546978/lucio-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">878</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 904 (Tex.

App. 1990); see Dixon, 206 S.W.3d at\n\n590 (“We will sustain the lower court’s ruling if it is reasonably supported by the record and is\n\ncorrect on any theory of law applicable to the case.”).\n\n       The record reflects that the trial judge held a hearing on appellant’s motion to suppress his\n\nstatements. Trooper Mena, Justice of the Peace Cynthia Kubicek, Sgts. Bush and Chappell, and\n\nOfficer Avila testified at the hearing. The evidence showed that, after Trooper Mena arrested\n\nappellant at a Wharton County Walmart, he took appellant before Wharton County magistrate\n\f                                                                                                                    24\n\nKubicek, and she informed appellant of his rights.9 In Wharton County, appellant gave a videotaped\n\nstatement to Sgts. Chappell and Bush. Appellant was later transported to Harris County, where he\n\ngave a second videotaped statement to Officer Avila. The state introduced a number of exhibits for\n\nthe trial court’s consideration, including a completed and signed document captioned, “Wharton\n\nCounty Sheriff’s Department Magistrate’s Warning Certificate—Article 15.17 Texas Code of\n\nCriminal Procedure,” and videotaped recordings of appellant’s entire Wharton and Harris County\n\nstatements. At the close of the evidence and after hearing argument, the trial court took appellant’s\n\nmotion to suppress under advisement. It subsequently ruled that it would grant the motion in part\n\nand deny it in part. The trial court denied the motion as to the beginning of appellant’s Wharton\n\nCounty statement. It granted the motion as to the later part of the Wharton County statement,\n\nstarting from appellant’s statement, “I don’t want to talk any more,” through to the end.10 But it\n\ndenied the motion altogether concerning appellant’s Harris County statement to Officer Avila. The\n\ntrial court later supplemented the record on appeal with written findings of fact and conclusions of\n\nlaw concerning the voluntariness of appellant’s statements.11\n\n\n        9\n           Trooper Mena testified that, after he apprehended appellant, another deputy assisted him with\nhandcuffing appellant and placing him in the backseat of a squad car. Appellant was then transported to the W harton\nCounty Jail. Trooper Mena stated that neither he nor the assisting deputy gave appellant warnings pursuant to\nArticle 38.22 or Miranda, but he also asserted that neither he nor his fellow deputy asked appellant any questions\nother than appellant’s name.\n\n         10\n            The videotaped statement reflected in State’s Exhibit 8 has a total running time of twenty-eight minutes\nand ten seconds. Appellant’s statement, “I don’t want to talk any more,” occurs at roughly the eleven-minute, thirty-\nfive-second mark.\n\n         11\n             On appeal, appellant asked us to abate this matter, stating that the trial court had not entered written\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law concerning the voluntariness of his statements. W e concluded that\nsupplementation of the record, rather than abatement of the appeal, was appropriate. See T EX . R. A PP . P. 34.5(c)(2).\nAccordingly, we directed the trial court to prepare and file its findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding this\nissue and instructed the trial court clerk to forward the supplemented record.\n         Although the findings refer to Officer Avila as “Sgt.,” he identified himself at the beginning of his testimony\nas “Senior Police Officer Xavier Avila.” W e will therefore refer to him as Officer Avila.\n\f                                                                                                                 25\n\n        In its written findings, the trial court found Trooper Mena, Justice of the Peace Kubicek, Sgts.\n\nChappell and Bush, and Officer Avila to be credible and reliable witnesses. It made these factual\n\nfindings regarding appellant’s magistration:\n\n        22.      Magistrate Kubicek first came into contact with Defendant Cole at\n                 approximately 1:15 [a.m.] on February 5, 2010, at the Wharton County jail.\n                 Defendant Cole indicated to Magistrate Kubicek he understood why he was\n                 in custody.\n\n        23.      Magistrate Kubicek confirmed that Defendant Cole could speak and\n                 understand English. Magistrate Kubicek observed Defendant Cole to be\n                 awake, alert, and oriented.\n\n        24.      Magistrate Kubicek read the warnings reflected on state’s exhibit one12 to\n                 Defendant Cole.\n\n        25.      Defendant Cole appeared to understand the warnings read to him by\n                 Magistrate Kubicek and he did not ask any questions about the rights\n                 Magistrate Kubicek read to him from state’s exhibit one.\n\n        26.      Defendant Cole signed the warnings reflected on state’s exhibit one in the\n                 presence of Magistrate Kubicek.\n\n        27.      While advising Defendant Cole of the warnings reflected on state’s exhibit\n                 one, Magistrate Kubicek further advised Defendant Cole that since the\n                 offense did not occur in Wharton County that he would not be appointed an\n                 attorney there but that he could retain his own or one would be appointed to\n                 him in Harris County.\n\n        28.      Defendant Cole signed state’s exhibit one acknowledging his right to request\n                 appointed counsel. However, Defendant Cole did not request appointed\n                 counsel while in Wharton County, Texas.\n\n        29.      Defendant Cole did not request the appointment of counsel at any time while\n                 in Wharton County.\n\n        Regarding appellant’s interview with Sgts. Chappell and Bush in Wharton County, the trial\n\n\n\n        12\n             State’s Exhibit 1 is a document entitled, “W harton County Sheriff’s Department Magistrate’s W arning\nCertificate[,] Article 15.17 Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.”\n\f                                                                                                   26\n\ncourt found:\n\n       21.        Both Sgt. Chappell and Sgt. Bush were present when Magistrate Kubicek\n                  read Defendant Cole magistrate warnings.\n\n                                                          ***\n\n       30.        Sgt. Chappell and Sgt. Bush observed Defendant Cole to be awake, alert, and\n                  oriented when he signed the magistrate form reflected in state’s exhibit one.\n\n       31.        After the magistrate warnings were read and signed, Sgts. Chappell and Bush\n                  took custody of Defendant Cole and entered an investigator’s office at the\n                  Wharton County Sheriff’s Office with Defendant Cole at approximately 1:44\n                  am on February 5, 2010 and Sgt. Chappell advised Defendant Cole of his\n                  Miranda rights as reflected on state’s exhibit 8.13\n\n       32.        Sgt. Chappell advised Defendant Cole that he had the right to remain silent\n                  and not make any statement at all; that any statement he made may be used\n                  against him at his trial; that any statement he made may be used as evidence\n                  against him in court; that he had the right to have a lawyer present to advise\n                  him prior to and during any questioning; that if he was unable to employ a\n                  lawyer he had the right to have a lawyer appointed to advise him prior to and\n                  during any questioning; [and] that he had the right to terminate or stop the\n                  interview at any time.\n\n       33.        Defendant Cole indicated he understood each right read to him by Sgt.\n                  Chappell. No promises or threats were made to Defendant Cole. Defendant\n                  Cole did not request a lawyer after Sgt. Chappell read the Miranda rights.\n\n       34.        After advising Defendant Cole of his rights[,] Sgt. Chappell asked Defendant\n                  Cole if he wanted to talk about the events that occurred.\n\n       35.        Defendant Cole replied, “Tell me what you know and I’ll talk about it.”\n\n       36.        After Sgt. Chappell explained that was not the way he would proceed but\n                  rather wanted to hear the Defendant’s side of what happened[,] Defendant\n                  Cole responded, “It’s not going to happen tonight.”\n\n       37.        Sgt. Chappell then responded with[,] “It’s not going to happen tonight?”\n                  Defendant Cole then said no and requested water and his shoes.\n\n\n\n       13\n            State’s Exhibit 8 is the first videotaped statement.\n\f                                                                                         27\n\n38.   After Defendant Cole said[,] “It’s not going to happen tonight,” Sgts.\n      Chappell and Bush stopped the questioning because they thought that\n      statement was an invocation of Defendant Cole’s right to remain silent.\n\n39.   As Sgt. Chappell started to leave the investigator’s office to get the water and\n      shoes, Defendant Cole volunteered, “You’re right about one thing,”\n      reinitiating discussion of the investigation with the two sergeants.\n\n40.   Sgt. Chappell responded with[,] “Pardon me.” Defendant Cole then stated,\n      “You’re right about one thing. It was not planned.” Sgt. Chappell then left\n      the investigator’s office.\n\n41.   While Sgt. Chappell was out of the office, Sgt. Bush engaged in a general\n      discussion with Defendant Cole but did not ask him any questions.\n\n42.   After providing Defendant Cole with water and shoes, Sgt. Chappell asked\n      Defendant Cole if he was ready to go and Defendant Cole responded[,]\n      “Ready to go to Harris County.”\n\n43.   As Sgt. Chappell asked for car keys, Defendant Cole reinitiated a discussion\n      about the case again and asked, “What do y’all want to know? What do I\n      need to tell you?” Sgt. Chappell answered, “What happened.”\n\n44.   Thereafter, Sgt. Chappell and Defendant Cole engaged in a discussion\n      wherein Chappell advised Defendant Cole of the source of his information\n      and Defendant Cole expressed his opinion about the quantity of evidence\n      obtained by Chappell.\n\n45.   After continuing to engage in a discussion about the case with Sgt. Chappell\n      and Sgt. Bush, Defendant Cole again invoked his right to remain silent when\n      he stated, “I do not want to talk anymore.” After Defendant Cole Defendant\n      Cole stated that he did not want to talk anymore he immediately began to\n      volunteer statements expressing his desire for the police to kill him. Chappell\n      and Bush did not ask Defendant Cole any other questions at that time.\n\n46.   Immediately after Defendant Cole stated he did not wish to talk anymore,\n      Chappell and Bush did not ask Defendant Cole any questions at that time.\n      Defendant Cole, however, continued to talk[,] expressing his desire to die,\n      concern for his children[,] and stating everything is gone.\n\n47.   Sgts. Chappell and Bush then continued to discuss the case further with\n      Defendant Cole, and engaged in a general discussion with Defendant Cole\n      about the offense, his work, his wife and his children. During the\n\f                                                                                                                  28\n\n                  discussion[,] Chappell and Bush asked Defendant Cole questions about the\n                  offense.\n\n         48.      Sgt. Chappell and Sgt. Bush concluded their interview with Defendant Cole\n                  in Wharton County at approximately 2:12 [a.m.] and then drove him to the\n                  Houston Police Department (HPD) homicide office. Upon arrival at HPD[,]\n                  Chappell and Bush turned over custody of Defendant Cole to Sgt. Avila at\n                  approximately 4:30 [a.m.] on February 5, 2010.\n\n         Concerning the interview with Officer Avila in Harris County, the trial court found:\n\n         49.      Sgt. Avila observed Defendant Cole to be awake, alert and oriented.\n\n         50.      Approximately three hours passed between Defendant Cole’s invocation of\n                  his right to silence in Wharton County and when he was again interviewed by\n                  Sgt. Avila.\n\n         51.      An HPD crime scene unit officer made contact with Defendant Cole in the\n                  homicide office and tested his hands, took custody of his clothes[,] and\n                  photographed him.\n\n         52.      At approximately 5:05 [a.m.] on February 5, 2010, Sgt. Avila read Defendant\n                  Cole his Miranda rights as reflected on state’s exhibit nine.\n\n         53.      Sgt. Avila advised Defendant Cole that he had the right to remain silent and\n                  not make any statement [and] that any statement he made may be used against\n                  him at his trial; that any statement he made may be used as evidence against\n                  him in court; that he had the right to have a lawyer present to advise him prior\n                  to and during any questioning; [and] that he had the right to terminate the\n                  interview at any time.\n\n         54.      Defendant Cole verbally indicated he understood each right and placed his\n                  initials next to each right on the warning form reflected in state’s exhibit\n                  nine.\n\n         55.      After Sgt. Avila advised Defendant Cole of his rights, Defendant Cole\n                  invoked his right to counsel.14\n\n         56.      Sgt. Avila immediately ceased any attempt to interview [appellant],\n\n\n        14\n             In the record before us, appellant’s statement to Officer Avila in Harris County (State’s Exhibit 9) is\ndivided into three consecutive parts. Part one has a running time of twelve minutes and twelve seconds. Appellant’s\ninvocation of his right to counsel occurs at approximately the four-minute, twenty-nine-second mark, during part one.\n\f                                                                                      29\n\n      terminated the interview[,] and left the interview room to turn off the video\n      recording device.\n\n57.   After turning off the recording device, Sgt. Avila returned to the interview\n      room in which Defendant Cole was seated and began to explain the transport\n      process to Defendant Cole.\n\n58.   After Sgt. Avila returned to the interview room, Defendant Cole reinitiated\n      further discussion about the case when he asked if his ten-year-old son would\n      have to testify.\n\n59.   Sgt. Avila answered Defendant Cole by stating it was possible.\n\n60.   Defendant Cole then advised Sgt. Avila that he changed his mind and wanted\n      to give a statement about shooting his wife and stepdaughter.\n\n61.   Sgt. Avila again left the interview room to again turn on the video recording\n      device.\n\n62.   After turning on the video recording device, Sgt. Avila returned to the\n      interview room in the homicide office and asked Defendant Cole to confirm\n      that a few minutes earlier he was advised of his rights and asked to initial\n      each.\n\n63.   Defendant Cole confirmed his rights were read to him and that he understood\n      each right.\n\n64.   Sgt. Avila reminded Defendant Cole that earlier he invoked his right to an attorney\n      and Defendant Cole responded he changed his mind and further stated he was doing\n      so voluntarily.\n\n65.   Sgt. Avila again read Defendant Cole his Miranda rights as reflected on\n      state’s exhibit nine.\n\n66.   Defendant Cole again verbally indicated that he understood each right.\n\n67.   Defendant Cole confirmed that he was initiating further conversation with\n      Sgt. Avila.\n\n68.   Defendant Cole then freely and voluntarily waived his rights and gave a\n      voluntary statement as reflected on state’s exhibit nine.\n\n69.   Sgt. Avila did not force, threaten[,] or promise anything in exchange for\n\f                                                                                                                      30\n\n                  Defendant Cole’s statements on state’s exhibit nine.\n\n         In its conclusions of law, the trial court determined that appellant freely and voluntarily\n\nsigned the warnings read to him by the magistrate judge, after acknowledging that he understood the\n\nwarnings; when Sgt. Chappell subsequently read him his Miranda rights, appellant acknowledged\n\nthat he understood those rights; and appellant never invoked his right to counsel while in Wharton\n\nCounty. The trial court concluded that appellant invoked his right to silence in Wharton County\n\nwhen he stated, “It’s not going to happen tonight.”15 It further concluded that Sgts. Chappell and\n\nBush scrupulously honored that invocation of appellant’s right to silence and ceased questioning him\n\nuntil appellant re-initiated discussion of the case by stating, “You are right about one thing. It was\n\nnot planned.” The trial court also concluded that appellant voluntarily waived his Miranda rights\n\nwhen he re-initiated a discussion about his case with Sgts. Chappell and Bush, and that it was only\n\nafter appellant’s re-initiation of the discussion that Sgts. Chappell and Bush resumed the interview.\n\n         However, the trial court concluded that appellant unequivocally and unambiguously invoked\n\nhis right to silence again in Wharton County when he stated, “I do not want to talk anymore,” and\n\nthat Sgts. Chappell and Bush did not honor appellant’s re-invocation of that right. The trial court\n\nthus determined that appellant’s subsequent statements to Sgts. Chappell and Bush in Wharton\n\nCounty after the re-invocation of his right to silence were recorded in violation of that right. In\n\n\n         15\n              The trial court concluded that appellant invoked his right to silence in W harton County when he stated,\n“It’s not going to happen tonight.” However, we note the existence of cases which call into question whether that\nparticular statement constituted a clear and unambiguous invocation of appellant’s right to silence. See Dowthitt v.\nState, 931 S.W .2d 244, 257 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996) (rejecting the appellant’s argument that his statement— “I can’t\nsay more than that. I need to rest”— was an unambiguous invocation of his right to remain silent); cf. Marshall v.\nState, 210 S.W .3d 618, 628 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006) (concluding that, when the appellant re-initiated contact with the\npolice to tell his side of the story, the trial court could reasonably have found that any invocation by the appellant of\nhis right to remain silent was ambiguous, thereby permitting the officer either to continue questioning or stop the\nquestioning to clarify whether the appellant really wanted to remain silent). The Court takes no position on whether\nappellant’s statement was a sufficient invocation of his right to silence.\n\f                                                                                                                       31\n\ncontrast, the trial court determined that appellant’s statements to Sgts. Chappell and Bush in Wharton\n\nCounty preceding the re-invocation of his right to silence were freely and voluntarily given under\n\nArticle 38.22. It also determined that the taking of those statements did not violate appellant’s rights\n\nunder the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution or Article 1,\n\nSection 10, of the Texas Constitution.\n\n         Concerning appellant’s Harris County statement to Officer Avila, the trial court concluded\n\nthat the officer scrupulously honored appellant’s invocation of the right to counsel by ceasing all\n\nquestioning and terminating the interview. It further concluded that appellant re-initiated discussion\n\nabout his case when he asked Officer Avila whether appellant’s son would have to testify and then\n\nvolunteered that he had changed his mind and wished to give a statement.\n\n         In point of error one, invoking Miranda and Moran v. Burbine, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111614\"><a href=\"/opinion/111614/moran-v-burbine/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">412</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986),\n\nappellant alleges that he did not voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waive his right to counsel\n\nbefore Sgts. Chappell and Bush questioned him in Wharton County.16 Appellant concedes that the\n\nmagistrate read him a list of warnings and instructions regarding his rights—including his rights to\n\nremain silent, to hire an attorney, to have an attorney appointed, and to have an attorney present\n\nduring any questioning by law enforcement—and asked appellant if he understood those rights.\n\nAppellant further concedes that he indicated to the magistrate that he understood those rights. The\n\ngravamen of appellant’s complaint is that the magistrate immediately negated the prophylactic effect\n\n\n\n         16\n             As we recognized in Pecina, the “rights created in Miranda, including the right to have counsel present\nduring custodial interrogation, ‘are not themselves rights protected by the Constitution but [are] instead measures to\ninsure that the right against compulsory self-incrimination [is] protected.’” 361 S.W .3d at 74 n.16; see also\nContreras v. State, 312 S.W .3d 566, 582 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010) (“Miranda does not set forth substantive\nconstitutional rights with regards to interrogations; rather, that decision and its progeny set up rules for the admission\nof certain statements by the accused— excluding a statement under certain conditions when it is determined that law\nenforcement failed to observe certain practices during a custodial interrogation.”).\n\f                                                                                                    32\n\nof those warnings by informing appellant that he would not receive appointed counsel in Wharton\n\nCounty, because such counsel would be appointed in Harris County. Appellant contends that the\n\nmagistrate affirmatively instructed him not to request an attorney in Wharton County. Appellant\n\nasserts that the magistrate’s alleged affirmative instruction misled him and removed his freedom to\n\ninvoke his right to counsel when Sgts. Chappell and Bush initially approached him and asked to\n\ninterview him about the murder. Appellant argues that, accordingly, the trial court should have\n\nsuppressed his entire Wharton County statement.\n\n       The Fifth Amendment precludes the government from compelling a criminal suspect to bear\n\nwitness against himself. U.S. CONST . amend. V; Pecina, 361 S.W.3d at 74–75. In Miranda, the\n\nSupreme Court created safeguards to protect the privilege against self-incrimination in the inherently\n\ncoercive atmosphere of custodial interrogations. Pecina, 361 S.W.3d at 75. In keeping with those\n\nsafeguards, police officers must give Miranda warnings to a person who is in custody before\n\nquestioning him. Id. Once an individual invokes his right to have counsel present during custodial\n\ninterrogation, a valid waiver of that right cannot be established by merely showing that the individual\n\nresponded to police-initiated interrogation after being advised of his rights again. Id. (citing\n\nEdwards v. Arizona, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110475\"><a href=\"/opinion/110475/edwards-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">477</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1981)). “Only if the person voluntarily and intelligently waives\n\nhis Miranda rights, including the right to have an attorney present during questioning, may his\n\nstatement be introduced into evidence against him at trial.” Id.\n\n       To evaluate whether appellant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his Miranda\n\nrights, we look to the standard articulated by the Supreme Court in Burbine.

Initially, appellant’s relinquishment of his right to have\n\ncounsel during interrogation must have been voluntary “in the sense that it was the product of a free\n\f                                                                                                     33\n\nand deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or deception.” Id. (quoting Burbine, 475\n\nU.S. at 421). Appellant must have additionally waived the right to interrogation counsel “with full\n\nawareness of both the nature of the right [he was abandoning] and the consequences of the decision\n\nto abandon it.” Id. “Only if the ‘totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation’ reveals\n\nboth an uncoerced choice and the requisite level of comprehension” may a court properly conclude\n\nthat a defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to interrogation counsel.\n\nId. But “[o]nce it is determined that a suspect’s decision not to rely on his rights was uncoerced, that\n\nhe at all times knew he could stand mute and request a lawyer, and that he was aware of the State’s\n\nintention to use his statements to secure a conviction, the analysis is complete and the waiver is valid\n\nas a matter of law.” Cobb v.

Chappell and Bush\n\nquestioned him in Wharton County. Regarding appellant’s allegation that the magistrate’s statement\n\nsomehow misled him regarding his ability to invoke his right to counsel in Wharton County, we first\n\nnote the Supreme Court’s unequivocal statement that “[w]hat matters for purposes of Miranda and\n\nEdwards is what happens when the defendant is approached for interrogation, and (if he consents)\n\f                                                                                                    34\n\nwhat happens during the interrogation—not what happened at any preliminary hearing.” Montejo\n\nv.

The magistration event is not an interrogation event.”).\n\n       We also reject appellant’s characterization of the magistrate’s statements regarding the\n\nappointment of counsel in Wharton County. The record supports a finding that the magistrate simply\n\nand accurately stated an administrative fact: should appellant request it, Harris County, rather than\n\nWharton County, would handle the appointment of counsel.\n\n       Further, we do not think that the magistrate’s statement placed appellant in an extraordinary\n\nposition. Following his magistration, appellant was essentially in the same situation as a defendant\n\nwho is arrested after a roadside stop and read his Miranda rights. The Fifth Amendment does not\n\nrequire police to have, in tow, lawyers who are ready to be appointed at a moment’s notice to assist\n\nsuch defendants. See Davis v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117863\"><a href=\"/opinion/117863/davis-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">452</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 460 (1994) (“In Miranda itself, we\n\nexpressly rejected the suggestion ‘that each police station must have a “station house lawyer” present\n\nat all times to advise prisoners,’ and held instead that a suspect must be told of his right to have an\n\nattorney present and that he may not be questioned after invoking his right to counsel.”) (internal\n\ncitation omitted). “[T]he primary protection afforded suspects subject to custodial interrogation is\n\nthe Miranda warnings themselves. ‘Full comprehension of the rights to remain silent and request\n\nan attorney [is] sufficient to dispel whatever coercion is inherent in the interrogation process.’” Id.\n\n(quoting Burbine, 475 U.S. at 427). Nor does the Constitution require immediate magistration. See\n\nCounty of Riverside v. McLaughlin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112585\"><a href=\"/opinion/112585/countyof-riverside-v-mclaughlin/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 56 (1991) (stating the general rule that jurisdictions\n\f                                                                                                   35\n\nthat provide judicial determinations of probable cause within forty-eight hours of arrest comply with\n\nthe Fourth Amendment). What is critical is the individual’s immediate ability to invoke his Miranda\n\nrights upon being placed in custody. The actual appointment of counsel—assuming that it occurs\n\nwithin a constitutionally reasonable time after the invocation of this right—is of lesser importance.\n\n        At the very most, this record supports a finding that there may have been some potential for\n\nconfusion on appellant’s part regarding his ability to obtain appointed interrogation counsel in\n\nWharton County. But it was entirely within the zone of reasonable disagreement for the trial judge\n\nto find, as it implicitly did, that appellant experienced no actual confusion. Defense counsel argued\n\nthat it was reasonable for appellant to interpret the magistrate’s statement to mean that he could not\n\nobtain appointed counsel in Wharton County. However, appellant did not present any evidence from\n\nany source that he was actually confused by the magistrate’s statements. The record is thus devoid\n\nof evidence that he was actually confused by the magistrate’s statements and that, but for them, he\n\nwould have invoked his right to counsel when Sgts. Chappell and Bush approached him. Cf.\n\nJohnson v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1743885\"><a href=\"/opinion/1743885/johnson-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">286</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">346</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 353 n.13 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009) (“Defense counsel’s argument\n\nto the [fact-finder] is not evidence.”) (Keller, P.J., dissenting).\n\n        After reviewing the videotaped statement, we conclude that the totality of the circumstances\n\nsurrounding the interrogation in Wharton County support the finding that appellant initially waived\n\nhis right to counsel with full awareness of the nature of the rights being abandoned and the\n\nconsequences of his decision to abandon them. Joseph, 309 S.W.3d at 27. Before Sgt. Chappell\n\nbegan reading appellant his rights, appellant acknowledged that he had just been before the\n\nmagistrate. Appellant expressed no confusion regarding his right to counsel as explained by the\n\nmagistrate. As Sgt. Chappell read each right to him again, appellant once more indicated his\n\f                                                                                                    36\n\nunderstanding, answering, “Yes, sir” and nodding his head up and down. The warnings that Sgt.\n\nChappell read to appellant at the beginning of the interview made appellant fully aware of his rights\n\nunder Miranda and Article 38.22, as well as the consequences of abandoning those rights.\n\n       Immediately after reading warnings to appellant, Sgt. Chappell asked whether appellant\n\nwanted to talk to the officers regarding the offense. Appellant did not ask for a lawyer. Instead, he\n\npromptly responded, “Tell me what you know and I’ll talk about it.” When appellant later stated,\n\n“It’s not going to happen tonight,” the officers did not resort to physical or psychological pressures\n\nto elicit further statements. Rather, the videotape clearly shows that Sgt. Chappell began to leave\n\nthe interview room to retrieve appellant’s shoes and get him water, as appellant had requested.\n\n       When Sgt. Chappell began to leave the interview room, appellant stopped the detective and\n\nspontaneously offered, “You’re right about one thing.” When Sgt. Chappell responded, “Pardon\n\nme?” appellant repeated himself, stating, “You’re right about one thing. It was not planned.” When\n\nSgt. Chappell returned to the interview room with appellant’s shoes and water, appellant directly\n\nasked the officers, “What do y’all want to know? What do I need to tell you?” After Sgt. Chappell\n\nanswered that the officers needed to know “[w]hat happened,” appellant did not invoke his right to\n\ncounsel, but instead discussed the offense.\n\n       Under the totality of the circumstances, it was within the zone of reasonable disagreement\n\nfor the trial court to admit the first part of appellant’s Wharton County statement. Point of error one\n\nis overruled.\n\n       In point of error two, appellant alleges that Sgts. Chappell and Bush did not scrupulously\n\nhonor his right to silence after he said, “I don’t want to talk anymore,” in his Wharton County\n\nstatement. Appellant further asserts that the statement he gave to Officer Avila in Harris County was\n\f                                                                                                    37\n\nthe result of a conspiracy between Sgt. Chappell and Officer Avila to convince him to relinquish the\n\nright to silence that he had previously invoked in Wharton County. For these reasons, appellant\n\nargues, the factors set forth by the Supreme Court in Michigan v. Mosley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109336\"><a href=\"/opinion/109336/michigan-v-mosley/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1975),\n\nrequired the trial court to suppress his Harris County statement to Officer Avila.\n\n       In Mosley, the Supreme Court “addressed the circumstances under which the prosecution is\n\nprohibited from using a defendant’s in-custody statement obtained by police who have renewed\n\ninterrogation after the defendant has invoked his right to remain silent.” Murphy v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">766</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">246</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 248 (Tex. Crim. App. 1989). The Court rejected the defendant’s argument that, once\n\nthe person has invoked his right to silence, further questioning of an individual in custody\n\nrepresented a per se violation of the protections set out in Miranda. Mosley, 423 U.S. at 102–03\n\n(“Clearly, [nothing] in the Miranda opinion can be sensibly read to create a per se proscription of\n\nindefinite duration upon any further questioning by any police officer on any subject, once the person\n\nin custody has indicated a desire to remain silent.”). Rather, the Court concluded that, under\n\nMiranda, “the admissibility of the statements obtained after the person in custody has decided to\n\nremain silent depends on whether” law enforcement authorities “scrupulously honored” the person’s\n\n“right to cut off questioning.” Id. at 104. The factors relevant to the Mosley analysis are (1) whether\n\nthe suspect was informed of his right to remain silent before the initial questioning; (2) whether the\n\nsuspect was informed of his right to remain silent before the subsequent questioning; (3) the length\n\nof time between initial questioning and subsequent questioning; (4) whether the subsequent\n\nquestioning focused on a different crime; and (5) whether police scrupulously honored the suspect’s\n\ninitial invocation of the right to remain silent. Maestas v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1533445\"><a href=\"/opinion/1533445/maestas-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 62 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1999). We have also emphasized that “whether a resumption of questioning is consistent with\n\f                                                                                                   38\n\n‘scrupulously honoring’ the right to remain silent depends on the unique facts and circumstances of\n\neach case.” Id. at 63.\n\n       We may quickly dispose of the first, second, and fourth Mosley factors. As appellant\n\nconcedes and the record reflects, he was advised of his right to remain silent before both his Wharton\n\nand Harris County interviews. Thus, Mosley’s first and second factors weigh in favor of a finding\n\nthat the officers scrupulously honored his right to silence. Because the questioning by Sgts. Chappell\n\nand Bush in Wharton County and by Officer Avila in Harris County related to the same offense, we\n\nfind that the fourth Mosley factor weighs against a finding that law enforcement scrupulously\n\nhonored appellant’s invocation of his right to silence.\n\n       We now turn to Mosley’s third factor: the length of time that passed between Sgts.\n\nChappell’s and Bush’s initial questioning of appellant in Wharton County and Officer’s Avila’s\n\nsubsequent request to interview appellant in Harris County. The trial court found that roughly three\n\nhours passed between these two events. Appellant offered no contrary evidence at the suppression\n\nhearing. We note that in Mosley itself, “an interval of more than two hours” passed between the\n\ninitial and subsequent questioning at issue. 423 U.S. at 104. Moreover, the Supreme Court\n\ndescribed this interval as “the passage of a significant period of time.” Id. at 106. Because the\n\npassage of almost three hours in appellant’s case exceeds the “significant period of time” in Mosley,\n\nthe third Mosley factor weighs in favor of a finding that law enforcement “scrupulously honored”\n\nappellant’s right to cut off questioning.\n\n       On appeal, appellant argues that we should discount this significant interval because he was\n\nin the presence of HPD officers for the entirety of that period and thus “never removed from an\n\ninterrogation environment.” We do not find appellant’s argument persuasive. The trial court\n\f                                                                                                                    39\n\nexpressly found that Sgts. Bush and Chappell “concluded their interview with [appellant] in Wharton\n\nCounty at approximately 2:12 [a.m.]” and then drove him to the HPD homicide. This finding\n\nimplies that Sgts. Bush and Chappell engaged in no further questioning of appellant after departing\n\nWharton County for Harris County. The record supports this implicit finding, and accordingly, we\n\ndefer to it. Romero, 800 S.W.2d at 543. Both Sgts. Bush and Chappell testified that, other than Sgt.\n\nBush responding to a few questions from appellant at the beginning of the ride to Harris County,\n\nneither detective engaged appellant in further conversation, much less interrogation. Sgt. Chappell\n\nfurther testified that appellant fell asleep in the back of the police vehicle during the trip to Harris\n\nCounty. Officer Avila testified that, after transport to Harris County, he did not immediately attempt\n\nto interrogate appellant. Rather, Officer Avila had a Crime Scene Unit officer photograph appellant,\n\ncollect his clothes, and test his hands for gunshot residue.17 Appellant did not dispute the officers’\n\ntestimony. While appellant was certainly in custody during the three-hour interval, there is no\n\nevidence that, during that time, he was subjected to “interrogation” within the meaning of Miranda.\n\nSee Rhode Island v. Innis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110254\"><a href=\"/opinion/110254/rhode-island-v-innis/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">291</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 299 (1980) (“‘Interrogation,’ as conceptualized in the\n\nMiranda opinion, must reflect a measure of compulsion above and beyond that inherent in custody\n\nitself.”). We decline to find that an “interrogation environment” existed during those three hours\n\nbecause there is no evidence that any law-enforcement officer actually tried to interrogate appellant\n\nduring that interval. See id.\n\n         Concerning the fifth and final Mosley factor, i.e., whether police scrupulously honored the\n\n\n\n        17\n             These are the types of activities that the Supreme Court has excluded from the self-incrimination\nprivilege that the Fifth Amendment protects. See Jones v. State, 795 S.W .2d 171, 175 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990)\n(noting the various police practices that the Supreme Court has excluded from the scope of the self-incrimination\nprivilege because they seek only physical evidence, not testimonial confessions of guilt).\n\f                                                                                                       40\n\nsuspect’s initial invocation of the right to remain silent, appellant focuses on the trial court’s finding\n\nthat Sgts. Chappell and Bush did not scrupulously honor appellant’s Wharton County invocation.\n\nBut the trial court’s finding is not dispositive of appellant’s second point of error, given the unique\n\nfacts and circumstances of this case. See Maestas, 987 S.W.2d at 63. The trial court also found that\n\nOfficer Avila scrupulously honored appellant’s invocation of the right to counsel by immediately\n\nterminating the Harris County interview when appellant invoked that right. Rather than giving his\n\nHarris County statement to Officer Avila because he failed to scrupulously honor appellant’s\n\ninvocation of his Miranda rights, appellant gave his statement to Officer Avila despite the officer’s\n\nscrupulous honoring of appellant’s Miranda rights. Officer Avila read appellant his Miranda rights\n\nand then immediately terminated the interview when appellant invoked his right to counsel.\n\nAppellant then re-initiated discussion of his case with Officer Avila, who read him his rights again,\n\nand appellant expressly waived them. Only then did Officer Avila interview appellant about the\n\noffense and obtain the statement at issue. Point of error two is overruled.\n\n        In point of error three, appellant alleges that the trial court erred in admitting his Harris\n\nCounty statement because Officer Avila intentionally dishonored appellant’s invocation of the right\n\nto counsel. Citing Oregon v. Bradshaw, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110987\"><a href=\"/opinion/110987/oregon-v-bradshaw/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1039</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1045–46 (1983) (plurality op.), appellant\n\nfocuses on one line of Officer Avila’s hearing testimony: after terminating the first interview and\n\nturning off the videotape, Officer Avila re-entered the interview room to inform appellant about\n\n“what was going to happen to him.” Appellant contends that, under Bradshaw, telling appellant\n\n“what was going to happen to him” was tantamount to Officer Avila re-initiating custodial\n\ninterrogation after appellant had invoked his right to counsel. Invoking Innis, appellant further\n\nasserts that Officer Avila’s response to appellant’s ensuing question—regarding whether appellant’s\n\f                                                                                                    41\n\nten-year-old son would have to testify—was a statement that Officer Avila should have known\n\nwould elicit an incriminating response. Appellant’s arguments have no merit.\n\n       Initially, Bradshaw is inapposite. In that case, the Supreme Court “clarified the Edwards rule\n\nand established a two-step procedure to determine whether a suspect has waived his previously\n\ninvoked right to counsel.” Cross v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2119929\"><a href=\"/opinion/2119929/cross-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">521</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 526–27 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004)\n\n(discussing Bradshaw’s import). Bradshaw did not concern what words or actions by police officers\n\nmay rise to the level of “interrogation” within the meaning of Miranda. Rather, Innis squarely\n\naddressed that issue and thus represents the applicable authority.\n\n       But appellant’s reliance on Innis is likewise unavailing. In Innis, police officers arrested the\n\ndefendant in connection with the death, by shotgun blast, of a taxicab driver. 446 U.S. at 293–94.\n\nAfter officers read Innis his Miranda rights, he invoked his right to counsel. Id. at 294. The officers\n\ndid not thereafter attempt to question Innis. Id. at 294–95. But while they were transporting him\n\nfrom the arrest site to the police station, two officers engaged each other in a conversation within\n\nInnis’s hearing. Id. During that conversation, the officers discussed the missing shotgun, noting the\n\npresence in the neighborhood of a school for handicapped children and expressing their concerns\n\nover what might happen if any of the children discovered the weapon. Id. Innis interrupted the\n\nconversation, telling the officers to turn the car around so that he could show them the location of\n\nthe missing shotgun. Id. at 295. The officers drove Innis back to the scene of his arrest. Id. After\n\nreceiving an additional set of Miranda warnings, Innis stated that he understood those rights but\n\n“wanted to get the gun out of the way because of the” school children. Id. Innis then led officers\n\nto the hidden shotgun. Id. The trial court denied Innis’s subsequent motion to suppress the shotgun\n\nand his statements to police regarding it. Id. at 295–96. But the state supreme court set aside Innis’s\n\f                                                                                                      42\n\nconviction on the grounds that the officers had subjected him to “‘subtle coercion’ that was the\n\nequivalent of ‘interrogation’” under Miranda. Id. at 296–97.\n\n        The Supreme Court disagreed. It first clarified that “interrogation” for Miranda purposes\n\nmeans express questioning or “its functional equivalent”: “[A]ny words or actions on the part of the\n\npolice (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are\n\nreasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.” 446 U.S. at 300–01 (internal\n\nfootnote omitted). But the Court also noted that police “surely cannot be held accountable for the\n\nunforeseeable results of their words or actions.” Id. at 302–03. Considering the facts of Innis’s case,\n\nthe Court rejected the notion that the police officers, through their conversation in Innis’s hearing,\n\nhad subjected him to the functional equivalent of interrogation under Miranda. Id. at 302. The\n\nconversation between the officers was brief, as opposed to a “lengthy harangue”; their comments\n\nwere not particularly “evocative”; and there was nothing in the record to suggest that the officers\n\nwere aware that Innis was particularly susceptible to an appeal to his conscience concerning the\n\nsafety of handicapped children. Id. at 302–03. In short, the Court concluded, it “[could not] say that\n\nthe officers should have known that it was reasonably likely that Innis would so respond.” Id. at 303.\n\n        Turning to the record before us, we discern no conduct by Officer Avila that approaches even\n\nthe level of “subtle coercion” that the Supreme Court, in Innis, found not to represent interrogation\n\nfor Miranda purposes. His uncontradicted testimony was that he re-entered the interview room after\n\nterminating the interview and leaving the room to turn off the videotape and that his general purpose\n\nwas “to inform [appellant] of the process, what was going to happen to him.” When asked\n\nspecifically what he said to appellant, Officer Avila testified, “I told him that I was going to call for\n\na marked unit to come and pick him up and take him to the city jail while—so we could contact the\n\f                                                                                                      43\n\ndistrict attorney and run the case.” Officer Avila agreed that by “run the case,” he meant “get the\n\ncharge filed.” Officer Avila’s brief statement to appellant was not one that could reasonably be\n\nexpected to elicit an incriminating response. To the extent Officer Avila mentioned that appellant\n\nwould be transported to the jail, his Avila’s statement is akin to a question normally attendant to\n\narrest and custody, which is excluded from the self-incrimination privilege that the Fifth Amendment\n\nprotects. See Jones, 795 S.W.2d at 175. To the extent Officer Avila referred to the fact that the\n\npolice would pursue charges against appellant, we cannot conclude that he could have reasonably\n\nexpected the statement to elicit an incriminating response.

We conclude that Officer Avila did not initiate\n\nan interrogation within the meaning of Miranda by making this statement.\n\n       Officer Avila testified that, after he told appellant about his pending transport to the city jail\n\nand that he would present the case to the district attorney, appellant asked whether his “10-year-old\n\nson was going to have to go to court and testify.” Officer Avila responded that “there was a\n\npossibility that [appellant’s son] might have to do that.” Appellant then “said that he had changed\n\nhis mind and he wanted to give a statement.” Officer Avila, whom the trial court found to be a\n\f                                                                                                                     44\n\ncredible witness, asserted that this exchange represented the entirety of the conversation that he had\n\nwith appellant before restarting the videotape.

Chappell testified that, during the interview in Wharton County,\n\nappellant showed some concern over the prospect of his son having to testify at trial, he also testified\n\nthat he did not tell Officer Avila anything regarding appellant’s concern.18 Sgt. Chappell also stated\n\nthat he and Officer Avila did not, at any time, watch appellant’s videotaped Wharton County\n\nstatement together. Officer Avila testified that, before interviewing appellant in Harris County, he\n\nhad only Sgts. Chappell’s and Bush’s brief synopsis of their Wharton County interview with\n\nappellant. He did not recall that the synopsis included information about appellant showing concern\n\nover his son having to testify. Officer Avila testified that he learned that information only after\n\ntaking appellant’s Harris County statement.               Appellant offered no contrary evidence at the\n\nsuppression hearing. We cannot conclude that Officer Avila could have reasonably expected the\n\nstatement to elicit an incriminating response. Point of error three is overruled.\n\n         In point of error four, appellant argues that the trial court reversibly erred in admitting any\n\nof appellant’s Wharton and Harris County statements at trial because the magistrate judge violated\n\nArticle 15.17. Specifically, appellant contends that the magistrate violated Article 15.17 because she\n\ndid not cause the magistration to be recorded and because she “told [appellant that] appointed\n\ncounsel would not be provided.”\n\n\n        18\n             The portion of the videotaped statement in which appellant expressed concern about his son testifying\nfell within the segment of State’s Exhibit 8 that was excluded from evidence, pursuant to appellant’s motion to\nsuppress.\n\f                                                                                                      45\n\n        Concerning the failure to record the magistration, the state argues that appellant failed to\n\nargue at trial that his statements were inadmissible on this basis, and therefore failed to preserve the\n\nissue for appeal. We have reviewed the record, which reflects that appellant did not raise the failure-\n\nto-record argument in either his written motion to suppress or in his arguments at the hearing on the\n\nmotion to suppress. While we agree that appellant failed to preserve this argument for our review,\n\nTEX . R. APP . P. 33.1(a), in the interest of completeness, we will address appellant’s claim.\n\n        The allegation that the magistrate “told [appellant that] appointed counsel would not be\n\nprovided” lacks merit. As we discussed in point of error one, we reject appellant’s characterization\n\nof the magistrate’s statements regarding the appointment of counsel in Wharton County. The record\n\nsupports a finding that the magistrate simply and accurately stated an administrative fact: that Harris\n\nCounty, rather than Wharton County, would handle the appointment of counsel, should appellant\n\nrequest it.\n\n        Further, even assuming for purposes of argument that the magistrate’s statement could be\n\nconsidered error under Article 15.17, it was cured when appellant received the requisite\n\nadmonishments regarding the provision of counsel from Sgt. Chappell before being interviewed in\n\nWharton County. Alternatively, the error was harmless, as it did not affect appellant’s substantial\n\nrights. See TEX . R. APP . P. 44.2 (b). Point of error four is overruled.\n\n                                Admission of Autopsy Photograph\n\n        In point of error five, appellant contends that the trial court erred when, over appellant’s Rule\n\n403 objection, it admitted State’s Exhibit 158 into evidence at the guilt-innocence phase during Dr.\n\nAlbert Chu’s testimony. See TEX . R. EVID . 403. Dr. Chu, an assistant medical examiner at the\n\nHarris County Institute of Forensic Sciences, testified that he performed Desirae’s autopsy and that\n\f                                                                                                     46\n\nthe photograph represented by State’s Exhibit 158 depicted an incision he made to the left side of\n\nDesirae’s back during the procedure. Dr. Chu told the jury that he made the incision to retrieve a\n\nbullet that had entered Desirae’s body from the front, penetrated her sternum, hit her heart and left\n\nlung, and lodged in the tissue on the left side of her back. Dr. Chu further testified that he submitted\n\nthe bullet he recovered from the incision to the firearms laboratory for comparison to any weapon\n\nrecovered in the case. On appeal, appellant complains that the photograph was “repetitious and\n\ngruesome.”\n\n         Rule 403 requires that a photograph possess some probative value and that its inflammatory\n\nnature does not substantially outweigh that probative value.

Williams, 301 S.W.3d at 690. These include:\n\nthe number of such photographs the proponent offers; their gruesomeness; their level of detail; their\n\f                                                                                                     47\n\nsize; whether they are in color or black-and-white; whether they are close-ups; whether they depict\n\na clothed versus a naked body; the availability of other means of proof; and other circumstances\n\nunique to the individual case. Id. “It is also relevant for the trial court to consider whether the body\n\nas photographed has been altered since the crime in some way (e.g., by autopsy) that might enhance\n\nits gruesomeness to the defendant’s detriment.” Narvaiz, 840 S.W.2d at 429. Autopsy photographs\n\nare generally admissible unless they do not aid the fact finder in determining the injuries alleged to\n\nhave been inflicted by the defendant, but rather emphasize solely mutilation of the victim caused by\n\nthe autopsy itself. See Williams, 301 S.W.3d at 690. Further, “changes rendered by the autopsy\n\nprocess are of minor significance if the disturbing nature of the photograph is primarily due to the\n\ninjuries caused by the appellant.” Hayes, 85 S.W. 3d at 816. We review for an abuse of discretion\n\na trial court’s decision to admit photographs over an objection. Williams, 301 S.W.3d at 690.\n\n       During Dr. Chu’s testimony, the state moved to admit a total of six photographs taken at\n\nDesirae’s autopsy, including State’s Exhibit 158. Appellant objected to State’s Exhibit 158 under\n\nRule 403, on the grounds that the photograph was “overly grotesque.” The state countered that the\n\nphotograph represented by State Exhibit 158 was the only one that showed the recovery of that\n\nparticular bullet from Desirae’s body and that the bullet was sent to the firearms laboratory and\n\nultimately matched to the pistol found in appellant’s vehicle. After reviewing the other photographs\n\nfrom Desirae’s autopsy, the trial court overruled appellant’s objection, stating that the court found\n\nthe exhibit relevant and that its probative value substantially outweighed its potential for unfair\n\nprejudice.\n\n       The photograph in question is in color, measures roughly eight-and-a-half by eleven inches,\n\nand is not a close-up view. Moreover, it is only one of a small number of photographs of Desirae’s\n\f                                                                                                     48\n\nautopsy shown to the jury and the only one portraying this specific view. Although Desirae’s body\n\nis shown unclothed and a small portion of her buttocks is visible at the bottom of the frame, that is\n\nnot the focus of the photograph, which is overwhelmingly clinical in nature. Dr. Chu’s neat surgical\n\nincision appears slightly above the middle of the photograph. Although the record does not reveal\n\nthe scale of the photo, the incision appears to be no more than a few inches long. Dr. Chu’s gloved\n\nfingers are visible, using forceps to retract the skin to more clearly reveal a bullet lodged in the\n\nexposed tissue. Although pink and darker red tissue are visible within the incision site, as is a bullet\n\nslug, the wound is not bloody. Contrary to appellant’s characterization, the incision with the skin\n\npulled away slightly is not especially gruesome. To the extent that the photograph is disturbing, it\n\nis because of the injury that appellant inflicted on Desirae by shooting her. The alteration to her\n\nbody caused by the autopsy, in an effort to retrieve the fatal bullet, pales in significance. See Hayes,\n\n85 S.W.3d at 816.\n\n        The trial court was well within its discretion to find that the photograph’s probative value\n\nsubstantially outweighed its potential for unfair prejudice. Point of error five is overruled.\n\n                    Cross-examination of Punishment-phase Defense Witness\n\n        In points of error six through eight, appellant challenges the trial court’s ruling that allowed\n\nthe state to cross-examine defense witness Frank Aubuchon regarding a statistical report generated\n\nby TDCJ’s Emergency Action Center (EAC). Specifically, in points of error six and seven, appellant\n\nargues that the trial court should have sustained his objections to the state’s line of questioning as\n\nirrelevant and unfairly prejudicial under Rule 403. In point of error eight, appellant contends that,\n\nby allowing the state to question Aubuchon regarding the report, the trial court violated his Eighth\n\nAmendment right to an individualized sentencing determination. See Woodson v. North Carolina,\n\f                                                                                                    49\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109535\"><a href=\"/opinion/109535/woodson-v-north-carolina/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">280</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 304 (1976) (plurality op.).\n\n       Aubuchon testified on direct examination that he had worked for TDCJ in inmate\n\nclassification, at the unit level, for many years. At the time of trial, he made a living testifying in\n\ncourt concerning TDCJ’s prisoner-classification procedures and security measures. Aubuchon\n\ntestified that there were then 111 TDCJ units, with a maximum capacity of approximately 160,000\n\noffenders. He told the jury that TDCJ facilities are divided into five different security levels, with\n\nlevel five (i.e., maximum security) units being the most secure and level one (“trustee camps”) being\n\nthe least secure. Within those maximum-security units, Aubuchon explained, there are two\n\npopulations of inmates: those in “general population” and those in administrative segregation, a\n\nmore restrictive custody environment.       Inmates in general population are assigned custody\n\nclassifications on a scale that runs from G-1 to G-5, with G-5 being the most restrictive custody class\n\noutside of placement in administrative segregation.\n\n       Aubuchon testified that, if sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, appellant would\n\nbe assigned to one of the eighteen maximum-security units within the TDCJ system, which he\n\ndescribed as being large facilities housing approximately 2,000 inmates each. Aubochon described\n\nin detail the construction and security measures in place at such facilities. He asserted that all\n\nmovement within the maximum-security units is well contained and controlled. Although inmates\n\nare not always individually escorted within the units, all inmates are always within sight, sound, or\n\ncamera view of correctional staff. Aubuchon further testified that, assuming that appellant was\n\nassigned to general population, he could never achieve a less-restrictive custody classification than\n\nG-3, which Aubuchon characterized as “very restrictive.” For example, Aubochon asserted that, as\n\na G-3 inmate, appellant would be limited to working in the kitchens and laundry because he could\n\f                                                                                                   50\n\nnot be assigned to jobs providing him access to vehicles, tools, or loading docks or to jobs involving\n\ncontact with non-uniformed female employees such as doctors, nurses, or teachers. Aubuchon also\n\nasserted that prison staff make virtually all decisions regarding where an inmate may go within the\n\nunit and when. When an inmate is not assigned to be at work, he may choose to spend time in the\n\nrecreation area, day room, or his cell, according to the schedule for his particular cell block.\n\nAubuchon also told the jury that TDCJ was in the process of installing closed-circuit television\n\nmonitors throughout its facilities so that there would be no place where an inmate could be without\n\nbeing subject to remote monitoring and recording. At the conclusion of direct examination, defense\n\ncounsel engaged Aubuchon in the following colloquy:\n\n       Q.      Is TDCJ a perfect prison system?\n       A.      No, sir.\n       Q.      Is there any perfect prison system that you know of?\n       A.      No, sir.\n       Q.      Based on the time that you worked and what you know about the prison\n               system, is it a pretty good one?\n       A.      Tremendous strides have been made in the last 30 years from going to convict\n               guards to where we are now.\n       Q.      Is it a fairly secure place?\n       A.      I believe so.\n\n       On cross-examination, the state probed Aubuchon’s testimony concerning the restrictions\n\nattendant upon G-3 classified inmates. The state elicited testimony supporting a reasonable inference\n\nthat, even as a G-3 classified inmate, appellant would have opportunities and the means by which\n\nto commit violent acts. The state then focused on Aubuchon’s testimony that, although not a perfect\n\nsystem, TDCJ was “a fairly secure place”: “[Defense counsel] asked you whether [TDCJ] was\n\nperfect and you said no, but you feel like it’s fairly safe, right?” Aubuchon responded, “Yes,\n\f                                                                                                                       51\n\nma’am,” agreeing with or adopting the prosecutor’s interpretation of his earlier testimony.19 At this\n\npoint, the prosecutor began to inquire into Aubuchon’s familiarity with the statistical prison-crime\n\nreports generated by EAC, specifically those generated for the current year.\n\n         The inquiry prompted a bench conference at which defense counsel objected to the state\n\nbeing allowed to question Aubuchon regarding the specific number of various offenses listed in the\n\nreport. The defense argued that appellant “should be sentenced based upon his conduct and not the\n\nconduct of other prisoners” and that to allow questioning about the specific number of offenses was\n\nunfairly prejudicial under Rule 403.\n\n         The trial court “agreed . . . 100 percent . . . that the jury [was] to consider [appellant] and his\n\nconduct and not the conduct of others.” But, it elaborated:\n\n         I think that there has been an effort by the defense, and certainly understandable, to\n         educate the jury on where [appellant] would be housed, what kind of security levels\n         it might [entail], and things he’s allowed to do, and essentially suggested through this\n         witness that—based on the answer to the last question that it’s a fairly safe place[.]\n         I think if the State is in possession of information that calls that opinion to be\n         questioned or at least [gives] the jury some other information to consider in\n         evaluating that answer, I think that the rules allow that.\n\nAfter entertaining additional argument, the trial court overruled the defense’s objection, finding that\n\nthe state’s line of cross-examination regarding the EAC statistics was relevant and that its probative\n\nvalue was not outweighed by any unfair prejudice. It granted appellant a running objection.\n\n\n\n         19\n              W e recognize that “safe” and “secure” are, sometimes but not always, synonyms. “S AFE , SECU RE may\nboth imply that something can be regarded as free from danger. These words are frequently interchangeable. S AFE ,\nhowever, is applied rather to a person or thing that is out of or has passed beyond the reach of danger. The ship is\nsafe in port. S ECU RE is applied to that about which there is no need to fear or worry: to feel secure about the future; .\n. ..” W ebster’s Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language 1259-60 (1989).\n          In the prison context, “safe” may mean that inmates are free from danger, while “secure” can mean that\ninmates are free from danger or that the physical boundaries of the prison cannot be breached by escape. It appears\nfrom the record that the state used “safe” as a synonym for “secure.”\n\f                                                                                                                           52\n\n         The state continued its cross-examination regarding the EAC statistics. It elicited testimony\n\nthat in the month of August 2011, TDCJ recorded 1760 serious20 or “unusual” incidents within its\n\nsystem. Although there were no escapes or attempted escapes reported, there had been 108\n\npossessions of weapons; twenty-four alleged sexual assaults; three serious staff assaults; 127 serious\n\noffender assaults; and forty-one “chunkings.”21 It elicited testimony that, year-to-date, TDCJ had\n\nrecorded 12,550 serious or unusual incidents: 731 weapons possessions; 239 alleged sexual assaults;\n\nfifty-eight serious staff assaults; 864 serious offender assaults; and 278 chunkings. Aubuchon agreed\n\nthat despite the measures TDCJ had taken or might take, incidents still occurred and would continue\n\nto occur. The state then left the subject of the EAC report and resumed questioning Aubuchon about\n\nthe restrictions on G-3 classified inmates and the opportunities and means those inmates have to\n\ncommit violent acts, despite those restrictions.\n\n         On redirect, the defense attempted to counter Aubuchon’s cross-examination testimony\n\nregarding the EAC reports. In response to defense questioning, Aubuchon testified that the EAC\n\nstatistics did not surprise him because there have always been some serious incidents occurring\n\nwithin the penitentiary. Aubuchon opined that, if anything, the ratio of serious incidents to inmates\n\nreflected in the report was surprisingly low given that 56% of inmates are in TDCJ for violent, “3g”\n\noffenses.22 Aubuchon further noted that the EAC statistics reflect only the total number of incidents,\n\n\n\n         20\n            Aubuchon agreed that “serious” staff and offender assaults were those that required more than first aid\nand did not reflect the minor assaults that occurred within the TDCJ system.\n\n         21\n            Aubuchon defined “chunking” as the act of an offender mixing a variety of fluids and solids (generally,\nurine and feces) and sometimes other material and throwing the mass into the hands or face of a correctional officer.\n\n         22\n             See Plummer v. State, 410 S.W .3d 855, 861 n.42 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013) (defining “3g” offenses as\nthose set forth in Article 41.12, section 3(g)(a)(1), and noting that “[a]lmost all of these listed offenses are violent\nacts involving physical threat or harm.”).\n\f                                                                                                   53\n\nwithout regard to whether the same inmate may be responsible for multiple incidents. Aubuchon\n\nacknowledged that even an inmate in administrative segregation could engage in criminal conduct.\n\nBut he also noted that appellant, who had been housed in administrative segregation while in the\n\nHarris County jail, had no record of committing assaultive conduct during his detention.\n\n       On recross-examination, the state elicited testimony that, despite what Aubuchon\n\ncharacterized as a low ratio of violence to the total number of inmates, three homicides had occurred\n\nwithin TDCJ in the current year to date. Aubuchon also acknowledged that, given his experience\n\nand the number of violent offenders in TDCJ, it would not have surprised him for the number of\n\nserious incidents to be higher. Aubuchon further acknowledged that he could not know whether\n\nappellant would engage in assaultive behavior in TDCJ. On re-redirect examination, Aubuchon\n\nopined that TDCJ’s security controls worked and were responsible for the “low” incidence of\n\nviolence relative to the number of inmates.\n\n       Although appellant contends that the state’s line of questioning was not relevant under Rule\n\n403, we perceive no error in the trial court’s contrary conclusion. Rule 403 requires that the\n\nevidence at issue be both relevant and not unfairly prejudicial. See TEX . R. EVID . 403. “Relevant\n\nevidence” is “evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence\n\nto the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the\n\nevidence.” TEX . R. EVID . 401. At the punishment phase of appellant’s capital-murder trial, the court\n\ntasked the jury with determining, inter alia, whether there was a probability that appellant would\n\ncommit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society. See Art.\n\n37.071, § 3(b)(1). It is well established in our case law that “society” includes both prison and free\n\nworld. Lucio v.

In point of error eight, he contends that such\n\nquestioning denied him the individualized sentencing determination guaranteed by the Eighth\n\nAmendment. Appellant’s arguments have no merit. The trial court did not permit the state to\n\nquestion Aubuchon regarding specific incidents of conduct by other inmates, nor did it allow the\n\nstate to suggest that appellant was responsible for any of the incidents reflected in the EAC report.\n\nCf.

Rather, the court limited the state to questioning Aubuchon about raw data\n\nconcerning broad categories of offenses committed inside TDCJ and the frequency with which they\n\noccurred, in response to Aubuchon’s assertion that TDCJ was a fairly secure or safe place. This was\n\nneither unfairly prejudicial under Rule 403 nor a denial of an individualized sentencing\n\ndetermination as guaranteed by the Eighth Amendment. Points of error seven and eight are\n\noverruled.\n\n                                         Denial of Mistrial\n\n       In point of error nine, appellant argues that the trial court reversibly erred at the punishment\n\nphase when it denied his motion for a mistrial. Appellant asserts that a mistrial was warranted\n\nbecause the state “fabricated a death threat by misstating the evidence during [its] closing” argument.\n\f                                                                                                                55\n\nThe mistrial motion arose from the final sentence of the following portion of the prosecution’s\n\nargument:\n\n                Ladies and gentlemen, on February 3rd, 2010, [appellant] walked out of Ms.\n        Boyd’s office and drove to Bass Pro Shop. His [therapy] appointment ended at 1:45.\n        And at 1:40 p.m. [sic] on February 3rd, 2010—the receipt is there, look at it—at 2:40\n        p.m., he was standing at the register [of Bass Pro Shop] with this (indicating).23 And\n        not just this, but a box of hollow-point ammunition. One hour after he walked out\n        of Therapist Boyd’s office.\n\n                We don’t know what happened that night. We know the kids were there\n        visiting. Did he sit around and think about what he was going to do? Because if you\n        don’t know by now that it was in his mind to do [it] the day before, I don’t know\n        what else we can show or tell you. Everything tells you that he did this and he knew\n        he was going to do it. And if you don’t know just from these facts, you can look at\n        his character and his past and know.\n\n                He took this gun and he went home. And the next day, after enjoying, I\n        guess, an evening with his sons, he took them home to their mother. And on the way,\n        he stopped at Chili’s. And at Chili’s, he told Piero: If something happens to your\n        mother and I—if your mother ends up dead in other words, and I go to prison—\n\n        Defense counsel interjected: “Objection. Improper argument, Judge. Not supported by the\n\nfacts.” The trial judge sustained the objection, telling the prosecutor to “[s]tay in the record.”\n\nDefense counsel moved the trial court to instruct the jury to disregard. The trial judge granted the\n\nrequest, directing the jury to “disregard the last statement of the prosecutor.” Defense counsel then\n\nmoved for a mistrial, but the trial court denied the motion. The prosecutor continued, without\n\nobjection from defense counsel:\n\n        Well, let me quote it. [Appellant] said: If something happens to your mother and I,\n        to his 10-year-old son, you are to go live with your Aunt Carina. And he said that\n        less than two hours from when he stood on [Melissa’s] doorstep and killed her.\n\n\n\n        23\n            The record shows that appellant bought the pistol linked to the shootings, which was entered into\nevidence, at Bass Pro Shop. Based on that and the prosecutor’s subsequent reference to “this gun,” we presume that\nthe prosecutor was indicating that pistol during this portion of her argument.\n\f                                                                                                     56\n\n                 I’m sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but what do you think that is? What do you\n         think that is?\n\n         Appellant contends that the statement at issue was solely an “[explanation] to one’s child that\n\nhe would be cared for if anything happened to his parents.” He asserts that the state attempted to\n\nturn the statement into a “death threat” against Melissa, when that argument did not represent a\n\nreasonable inference from the evidence. Therefore, appellant contends, the prosecutor’s argument\n\nwas improper. Appellant further alleges that the trial court’s instruction for the jury to disregard the\n\nstatement was inadequate to cure the damage to his substantial rights, and thus, a mistrial was in\n\norder.\n\n         We have repeatedly stated that, even when the prosecution mentions facts outside the record\n\nduring argument, an instruction to disregard will generally cure the error.

Appellant contends that the trial court violated\n\nthe Eighth Amendment because it “limited the mitigation evidence appellant was able to present and\n\nlimited the evidence the jury believed [it] could consider.”\n\n        Appellant’s argument has no merit. The parties did not embark on closing argument until\n\nthe evidentiary portion of the punishment trial was complete. There was no evidence to introduce\n\nor “present” during closing argument. See Johnson, 286 S.W.3d at 353 n.13 (counsel’s arguments\n\nto the fact finder are not evidence). The trial court’s rulings at issue could not have limited\n\nappellant’s presentation of mitigating evidence, which was already complete before closing argument\n\neven began.\n\n        Further, the jury charge clearly instructed the jury that it must consider “all the evidence”\n\nsubmitted to it during the entire trial in answering the special issues. We presume that juries follow\n\nthe trial court’s instructions. See Casanova v.

Freeman, 340 S.W.3d at 727.\n\n        The first sustained objection of which appellant complains arose when defense counsel noted\n\nthe emotion that appellant’s biological mother, Sonya, and younger sister, Corina, showed when they\n\ntestified. Earlier in his closing argument, defense counsel had discussed the circumstances of\n\nappellant’s adoption by the Coles. Counsel had emphasized Sonya’s reluctance to part with her son\n\nand the emotional pain that appellant and his biological family had experienced as a result of the\n\nseparation. After discussing other topics, defense counsel returned to the subject of appellant’s\n\nadoption, reemphasizing the emotional pain it caused and commenting on the love that appellant’s\n\f                                                                                                     59\n\nbiological family had for him:\n\n        You could see when [Corina] and her mother, Sonya, testified [about] the impact that\n        that whole situation back from 1978 [when the Coles adopted appellant] had upon\n        the family. You know—because I saw y’all see it—that finally you saw some\n        emotion in [appellant] when his sister showed her emotion about him.\n\n(Emphasis added). The state objected after defense counsel uttered the italicized portion of the\n\nstatement, on the grounds that the statement was outside the record. At the state’s request, after\n\nsustaining the objection, the trial court instructed the jury to “disregard the last statement.” On\n\nappeal, appellant contends that defense counsel was arguing that appellant felt remorse for killing\n\nthe two victims and that remorse for the crime is relevant to the mitigation special issue. He asserts\n\nthat, by sustaining the objection, the trial court thwarted defense counsel’s attempt to draw the jury’s\n\nattention to mitigating evidence and thus denied appellant his right to counsel.\n\n        We perceive no error in the trial court’s decision to sustain the state’s objection. Initially,\n\nthe record does not support appellant’s assertion concerning the purpose of defense counsel’s\n\nargument—that it was an attempt to persuade the jury that appellant felt remorse for killing the two\n\nvictims. It is clear from the preceding sentence—“You could see when [Corina] and her mother,\n\nSonya, testified [about] the impact that that whole situation back from 1978 had upon the\n\nfamily”—that counsel was returning to the subject of appellant’s adoption, in a renewed attempt to\n\nemphasize the emotional pain that the separation caused appellant and his biological family. It was\n\nnot an attempt by defense counsel to argue that appellant had shown remorse for the killings. The\n\ntrial court could not have deprived defense counsel of an argument that counsel was not attempting\n\nto make.\n\n        Moreover, defense counsel’s statement during closing argument was neither a plea for law\n\f                                                                                                   60\n\nenforcement nor was it an answer to the state’s argument. Further, defense counsel’s statement\n\ncannot reasonably be deemed a summary of the evidence or a reasonable deduction from the\n\nevidence because “[t]his sort of argument constitutes no evidence at all.” Cf. Good v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1485240\"><a href=\"/opinion/1485240/good-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">723</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">734</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 736 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986). Appellant’s demeanor during his sister’s testimony was\n\nnot evidence subject to reference or allusion by defense counsel. In Good, over objection, the trial\n\ncourt permitted the prosecutor to argue to the jury that the defendant’s orderly demeanor during the\n\ncomplainant’s testimony was probative, inter alia, of the defendant’s lack of remorse for the offense.\n\nId. at 735. In reversing the conviction, we explained that the defendant’s nontestimonial demeanor\n\n“was not evidence subject to reference by the prosecutor” because “[i]t was not offered into evidence\n\nthrough any legally recognizable method of proof.          Allowing the state to summarize [the\n\ndefendant’s] non-testimonial demeanor impermissibly placed [the defendant’s] demeanor before the\n\njury through the prosecutor’s unsworn jury argument. This sort of argument constitutes no evidence\n\nat all.” Id. at 736 (internal citation omitted).\n\n        We see no reason that this conclusion should not apply equally when the defense attempts\n\nto argue that a defendant’s demeanor during the testimony of another witness is probative of the\n\ndefendant’s remorse for the offense—especially where, as here, the defendant does not elect to\n\ntestify. A contrary rule would allow defendants, through their counsel’s jury argument of their\n\ncounsel, to use the right to silence as both a shield and a sword, which we do not permit.

App.\n\n\n\n         24\n             Further, we note that appellant does not direct us to any testimony in the record regarding appellant’s\nintention to be a good father to his sons in the future, nor does our review reveal any.\n\f                                                                                                   62\n\n2008) (trial court does not abuse its discretion by excluding execution-impact testimony).\n\n       Appellant next complains that the trial court improperly sustained the state’s objection at the\n\nend of the following portion of defense counsel’s closing argument:\n\n       I don’t think I ever mentioned that when [appellant] left the scene in that truck he had\n       OnStar. And don’t you know that he knew he had OnStar? And don’t you know that\n       he knew he would be found and caught? And he had his son with him. After the\n       worst 15 to 30 seconds in his entire life, he turned around because little Lucas was\n       saying: Daddy, Daddy, and he turned around and picked him up. And that can be\n       mitigating. Okay? There was no Amber Alert, there was no kidnapping. He just\n       wanted to be with his son a few more minutes before he was caught. And I guarantee\n       you he absolutely knew he was going to be caught. And now here he is.\n\n(Emphasis added.) The state objected on the grounds that “all of that” was “outside the record.”\n\nAppellant argues that the italicized portion of the above-quoted passage nonetheless constituted a\n\nreasonable inference from the evidence. We are not persuaded that the trial court’s ruling fell\n\noutside the zone of reasonable disagreement.\n\n       An attorney may make reasonable deductions from the evidence so long as the argument is\n\nsupported by the evidence and offered in good faith. Andujo v. State, 755 S.W.2d 138,144 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1988). Defense counsel’s statement concerned appellant’s internal thought processes,\n\nsomething to which only appellant would normally be privy unless he told someone else. But\n\nappellant did not testify at either phase of the trial to offer the jury an explanation for taking the\n\ntoddler with him. To the extent appellant alluded to Lucas in the videotaped statements he gave to\n\npolice, it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to conclude that defense counsel’s\n\ninference was unreasonable. In the portion of his Wharton County statement that was admitted into\n\nevidence, appellant mentions Lucas once, near the end of the statement, asking for Lucas’s present\n\nlocation. In his Harris County statement, appellant describes Lucas approaching him in the parking\n\f                                                                                                    63\n\nlot immediately after the shooting and relates that he picked up the child and put him in the truck.\n\nLater, appellant states that, when he took the money from his employer, he was thinking that he\n\nwanted to find a place for Lucas, did not want anything to happen to the child, and wanted to leave\n\nLucas with someone, but no one was around. From this evidence, it is not a reasonable deduction\n\nthat appellant wished to keep the child with him for just a little while longer.\n\n        We next consider appellant’s challenge to the trial court’s ruling regarding the following\n\ndefense argument:\n\n                [I] want to tell you what a wonderful experience it’s been to represent\n        [appellant] because obviously [co-counsel] and I . . . have spent hours and hours with\n        [appellant]. And I think that I have learned is [sic] I recognize what all the other\n        people recognize in [appellant] in the time that they knew him.\n                Now, maybe I have not known him for five years, maybe I didn’t work with\n        him on a daily basis, but I’m pretty darn familiar with him since [the] middle of\n        February of 2010. And I see why grown men, coworkers—\n\n        The state objected that defense counsel’s argument was outside the record. The trial court\n\ndid not rule on the objection, instead stating only, “No personal opinion, [counsel].” Appellant\n\ncontends that defense counsel has the same right as the prosecutor to argue his opinion if that opinion\n\nis based on the evidence. See Felder v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1517488\"><a href=\"/opinion/1517488/felder-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">848</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 95 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992) (prosecutor\n\n“may argue his opinions concerning issues in the case so long as the opinions are based on the\n\nevidence in the record and not as constituting unsworn testimony”). We perceive no abuse of\n\ndiscretion by the trial court in disallowing the argument. Defense counsel’s objected-to argument\n\nwas not based on evidence offered and admitted at trial. Rather, it was based upon counsel’s\n\npersonal interactions with the defendant and the conclusions defense counsel reached about appellant\n\nas a result of that contact.\n\n        Finally, appellant challenges the trial court’s ruling regarding defense counsel’s argument\n\f                                                                                                                64\n\nthat, “The death penalty should be the last drastic step, that you have to take somebody’s life. There\n\nshould be nothing more that you could possibly do with somebody. You have to give him the death\n\npenalty because there is nothing else we can do with this guy.” The state objected that counsel’s\n\nargument misstated the law. The trial court sustained the objection. Contrary to appellant’s\n\nassertion, counsel’s statement did not accurately summarize the death-selection process under Texas\n\nlaw. See Art. 37.071, § 2(b) & (e). The trial court did not abuse its discretion by sustaining the\n\nstate’s objection. Point of error fourteen is overruled.\n\n                          Constitutionality of Article 37.071, Section 2(f)(4)\n\n        In point of error fifteen, appellant argues that Article 37.071, section 2(f)(4), limits the jury’s\n\nconsideration of all mitigating evidence, in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to\n\nthe United States Constitution and Sections 13 and 19 of Article I of the Texas Constitution. In point\n\nof error sixteen, appellant contends that Section 2(f)(4) is unconstitutional under these same federal\n\nand state constitutional provisions because it requires the jury to find a nexus between the\n\ncommission of the crime and any mitigating evidence. Appellant acknowledges that we have\n\npreviously rejected such facial challenges to Section 2(f)(4),25 but invites us to revisit our precedent.\n\nWe decline to do so. Points of error fifteen and sixteen are overruled.\n\n        In point of error seventeen, appellant alleges that Section 2(f)(4) is unconstitutional as applied\n\nto him because of the constitutional infirmities alleged in points of error fifteen and sixteen.\n\nAppellant contends that the jury charge and the state’s closing argument exacerbated these alleged\n\nconstitutional deficiencies because they required the jury to restrict its consideration of any\n\n\n\n        25\n            See Coble v. State, 330 S.W .3d 253, 296 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010); Roberts v. State, 220 S.W .3d 521, 534\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2007); Perry v. State, 158 S.W .3d 438, 449 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004).\n\f                                                                                                     65\n\nmitigating evidence to that which reduced his moral blameworthiness for committing the capital\n\nmurder.\n\n        Appellant’s argument has no merit. The record shows that the trial court’s jury charge\n\nincluded the definition of mitigating evidence required by Section 2(f)(4). As discussed above, we\n\nhave previously rejected appellant’s constitutional challenges to Section 2(f)(4). Coble, 330 S.W.3d\n\nat 296; Roberts, 220 S.W.3d at 534; Perry, 158 S.W.3d at 449. There was thus no constitutional\n\ninfirmity for the state’s argument to aggravate. Further, we have reviewed the portion of the state’s\n\nclosing argument of which appellant complains. We reject appellant’s contention that the state\n\nattempted to limit the kind of evidence to which the jury could give mitigating effect. Rather, we\n\nthink the state’s argument was reasonably understood by the jury as an assertion that, whatever\n\nmitigating effect the jury chose to give to the evidence before it, the mitigating effect was simply not\n\nenough to warrant a sentence of life without parole. Point of error seventeen is overruled.\n\n        We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\nDelivered: June 18, 2014\nDo Not Publish\n\f</pre>",
