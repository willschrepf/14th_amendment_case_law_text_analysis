GRADY JOLLY, Circuit Judge:\n\n     Vulcan Materials Company (“Vulcan”) owns a land lease with the\n\nright to mine limestone.      The problem is that a substantial part of\n\nthe land and the mining is within the boundaries of the City of\n\nTehuacana (“the City”) in Limestone County, Texas. The City passed\n\nan Ordinance in 1998 forbidding quarrying or mining activities\n\nwithin the   City   limits.      Vulcan    contends    that   the   Ordinance\n\nconstitutes a public taking and violates its rights under both the\n\n\n     1\n      District Judge of the Western District of Louisiana sitting\nby designation\n\fUnited States and Texas Constitutions.           All that remains to be\n\ndecided in this appeal, however, is the propriety of the district\n\ncourt’s grant of the City’s Motion for Summary Judgment dismissing\n\nVulcan’s takings claim under the Texas Constitution. We ultimately\n\nhold that the case turns on whether the quarry mining constitutes\n\na public nuisance and consequently remand for a jury determination\n\non this issue.\n\n                                    I\n\n     The City of Tehuacana has a population of approximately 300 to\n\n350 people and occupies a small geographical area in Limestone\n\nCounty, Texas.\n\n     In 1993, Smith Crushed Stone, Inc. (“SCS”) leased limestone\n\nquarry rights on three contiguous tracts of land (Tracts 1-3)\n\nadjacent to Tehuacana’s City limits and also leased four additional\n\ncontiguous tracts of land within the City limits.             It did no\n\nmining,   however,   on   these   tracts.   In    October   1997,   Vulcan\n\npurchased the assets of SCS in Limestone County, including the\n\nlimestone quarry rights leased by SCS.       This leasehold interest\n\nallows Vulcan to prospect, explore, mine, operate for and produce\n\n“by strip mining or open pit mining all rock, stone, limestone and\n\nsimilar rock like materials” and grants Vulcan the right to exclude\n\nall other uses of the Tracts as necessary to enable the quarrying.\n\n     Before its acquisition of SCS’s assets, Vulcan hired local\n\nattorney Bobby Reed to determine whether any ordinances would\n\nprevent Vulcan from quarrying, including those tracts located\n\n                                    2\n\fwithin the City.       Reed attested that both the Mayor and City\n\nSecretary advised him that no ordinances existed nor were in the\n\nplanning stages that would prevent Vulcan from pursuing quarrying\n\noperations within the City.\n\n     The leases cover land both within and outside the Tehuacana\n\nCity limits.    Vulcan sought to mine approximately 48 acres located\n\ninside City limits, described as Tracts 4-7.               This     property   is\n\n2/3 to 3/4 of a mile wide and abutted by several public roads that\n\naccess several homes, some of which are located just across the\n\nstreet from the property.          Outside Tehuacana City limits, Vulcan\n\ncurrently    mines   and   operates    a    rock   crushing   facility    on   an\n\napproximate    additional    250    acres    of    land   located    immediately\n\nadjacent to Tracts 4-7.\n\n     In early 1998, Vulcan began planning active quarrying on\n\nTracts 4-7.     Vulcan determined access points and ramp sites,\n\ndetermined where in that area it wanted to quarry, cleared land,\n\nstripped overburden, and otherwise prepared the tracts for physical\n\nuse. There has been no recent mining on these tracts.\n\n     In October 1998, Vulcan sought and obtained permission from\n\nthe Texas Railroad Commission to construct berms on Tracts 4-7.\n\nVulcan also prepared the quarry floor and removed overburden on\n\nTract 6 to prepare for a blast (“shot”) to loosen limestone in the\n\nquarry.     The City residents began to express opposition to the\n\nproposed operations and soon the City Council began to consider\n\nadopting an ordinance to regulate Vulcan’s quarrying activities.\n\n                                       3\n\f      Vulcan conducted a test shot on Tract 6 on October 25, 1998,\n\nin   an   abandoned     pit.   Another    shot   and   similar   preparatory\n\nactivities were conducted on Tract 6 on November 25 and 26, 1998.\n\nAlthough approximately 400-500 tons of limestone were processed\n\nthrough Vulcan’s plant as a result of these two blasts, this amount\n\nwas only a small percentage of what Vulcan normally retrieved and\n\nprocessed during one day in its regular operations.              Some of the\n\nfinished product was tested, and some was put into inventory and\n\nsold in the ordinary course of business.\n\n      Before it passed the contested ordinance, the City held public\n\nhearings.    Numerous citizens complained about Vulcan’s operations\n\noutside the City as well as the two blasts conducted inside the\n\nCity limits.    Specifically, the citizens complained that Vulcan’s\n\nactivities caused shaking of houses, lifting furniture off the\n\nfloor, rattling windows, shaking and jostling people in their\n\nhomes, noise, dust, smoke, property damage, fear, interference with\n\nenjoyment of property and life, interference with the use of public\n\nroads and streets, and exposure to fly and throw rock.             The City,\n\nand the district court, cite one flyrock incident in particular\n\nthat had occurred when SCS was conducting quarrying activities on\n\nthe tracts outside of the City in which a 500-pound boulder was\n\npropelled    into   a   Tehuacana   resident’s    yard.    Residents    also\n\ncomplained that the mining activities caused springs and wells in\n\nthe area to dry up.\n\n\n\n                                      4\n\f     On December 8, 1998, the City Council passed the “Ordinance\n\nForbidding Quarrying or Blasting Operations within the City Limits”\n\n(the “1998 Ordinance”) and on December 15, 1998, Vulcan filed its\n\ncomplaint in federal district court, under both the United States\n\nand Texas Constitutions.2    As mentioned above, the only claim\n\n\n     2\n      The 1998 Ordinance states, in pertinent part:\n\n          AN ORDINANCE FORBIDDING QUARRYING OR BLASTING\n          OPERATIONS WITHIN THE CITY LIMITS\n\n               WHEREAS, the City of Tehuacana is\n          predominantly a residential city, with little\n          of no industry inside city limits; and\n\n               WHEREAS, a rock quarry operating near the\n          city limits has indicated its intention to\n          begin quarrying and blasting operations within\n          the city limits of the City of Tehuacana; and\n\n               WHEREAS, the quarrying and blasting\n          operations would constitute a public nuisance\n          and result in excessive noise and vibration to\n          city residents; and\n\n               WHEREAS, the quarrying and blasting\n          operations could constitute a physical danger\n          to residents of the city due to the\n          possibility of overfly of rock or other\n          materials from blasting onto residents of the\n          city or property of residents of the city; and\n\n               WHEREAS, the blasting and quarrying\n          operations would have a detrimental effect on\n          the quality of residential life in the city\n          due to vibration, excessive noise from\n          blasting, excessive noise from the operation\n          of heavy equipment, the potential for injury\n          or death from overfly of rock, (flyrock), air\n          blast damage, ground motion damage, and\n          excessive dust from operations.\n\n               NOW THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY\n          COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF TEHUACANA:\n                                5\n\fremaining in this appeal is Vulcan’s takings claim under the Texas\n\nConstitution.\n\n     In its September 25, 2002 Memorandum Opinion and Order, the\n\ndistrict court granted the City’s Motion for Summary Judgment,\n\nholding that the 1998 Ordinance is not an unconstitutional taking\n\nor an inverse condemnation under Texas law.     The district court\n\nheld, as a matter of law, that the 1998 Ordinance substantially\n\nadvances a legitimate state interest.     The court also made the\n\nfollowing determinations with regard to Vulcan’s regulatory takings\n\nclaims:\n\n\n\n\n               SECTION I.     It shall be unlawful for\n          any person, company, entity, or corporation to\n          engage in the following activities within the\n          city limits of the City of Tehuacana,\n          Limestone County, Texas:\n\n                A.   the quarrying or mining of rock\n                     utilizing blasting operations or use\n                     of explosives, or surface mining;\n                B.   the use of explosives for the\n                     purpose of blasting rock, or in\n                     connection with mining or quarrying\n                     operations;\n                C.   the use of heavy equipment in\n                     connection with quarrying or mining\n                     operations within the city limits of\n                     Tehuacana, Limestone County, Texas;\n                D.   the use of explosives for any\n                     commercial or industrial activity or\n                     for any other reason except the use\n                     of fireworks in connection with\n                     celebrations as may be allowed by\n                     law from time to time.\n\nTehuacana, Tex., Ordinance 12898 (Dec. 8, 1998).\n                                 6\n\f          [T]he activities the 1998 Ordinance seeks to\n          regulate constitute a nuisance under Texas\n          law. The 1998 Ordinance therefore restricts\n          no legitimately owned property right. Even if\n          the Court were to assume that the 1998\n          Ordinance did somehow restrict a recognized\n          property right, a taking under Texas law would\n          not occur because Vulcan has not been deprived\n          of all economically viable use of its\n          property.    Only a small portion of its\n          property is affected by the Ordinance, and the\n          property still has an economically viable use.\n          Although Vulcan argues that high explosives\n          and heavy equipment are required to extract\n          the limestone from the ground, the Court notes\n          that neither were required to extract the\n          stone used to build the pyramids. Obviously,\n          while extraction of the limestone without\n          explosives and heavy equipment may be more\n          expensive and labor intensive, it is not\n          impossible to operate such a quarry without\n          violating the 1998 Ordinance.     Accordingly,\n          judgment will be entered to the effect that\n          the   1981   Ordinance   does   not   prohibit\n          quarrying, and that the 1998 Ordinance is not\n          an unconstitutional taking or an inverse\n          condemnation under Texas law.\n\nMem. Opin., p. 20.   Vulcan appeals.   We vacate the district court’s\n\ngrant of summary judgment to the City and remand.\n\n                                 II\n\n     This Court reviews the granting of summary judgment de novo,\n\napplying the same standards used by the district court.    Thomas v.\n\nBarton Lodge II, Ltd., 174 F.3d 636, 644 (5th Cir. 1999); Norman v.\n\nApache Corp., 19 F.3d 1017, 1021 (5th Cir. 1994). Summary judgment\n\nis proper when no genuine issue of material fact exists and the\n\nmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. FED. R.\n\nCIV. P. 56(c).       Summary judgment is only appropriate if no\n\nreasonable jury could differ in weighing the evidence.     Peel & Co.\n\n                                 7\n\fv. Rug Mkt., 238 F.3d 391, 398 n.37 (5th Cir. 2001).               The Court\n\nviews the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\n\nparty.   Gillis v. Louisiana, 294 F.3d 755, 758 (5th Cir. 2002).\n\n     Under Texas law, although determining whether a property\n\nregulation is unconstitutional requires consideration of a number\n\nof factual issues, the ultimate question of whether there has been\n\na regulatory taking is a question of law.               Mayhew v. Town of\n\nSunnyvale, 964 S.W.2d 922, 932-33 n.3 (Tex. 1998).\n\n                                     III\n\n     Before we evaluate whether the Ordinance constitutes a taking\n\nunder the Texas Constitution, we must first address the City’s\n\narguments   that   the   Ordinance    is   not   a   land   use   regulation.\n\nInstead, the City contends that the Ordinance is a health and\n\nsafety regulation that redresses an activity under its police power\n\nand is not subject to the public takings law of Texas.3                   The\n\ndistrict court was obviously unpersuaded by the City’s argument\n\nbecause it addressed the takings issue presented in this case.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      The district court refrained from holding that the Ordinance\nis not a land use regulation and went on to evaluate Vulcan’s\nclaims under Texas takings law. However, the court indicated its\ndoubt that this was a taking and commented that the Ordinance did\nnot prohibit the mining of limestone; instead, according to the\ndistrict court, the ordinance merely prohibited the mining of\nlimestone by using blasting and heavy machinery.      The district\ncourt noted that the Egyptian Pyramids were built without the use\nof explosives or heavy machinery. However, we hesitate to compare\nVulcan’s land use activities to those of the ancient Egyptians.\nSee U.S. CONST. amend. XIII.\n\n                                      8\n\f       No   one     doubts   that   a   municipality    may   enact   reasonable\n\nregulations to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of\n\nits people.       College Station v. Turtle Rock Corp., 680 S.W.2d 802,\n\n805 (Tex. 1984)(citing Ellis v. City of West University Place, 141\n\nTex. 608, 175 S.W.2d 396 (1943)).             However, “if a governing body,\n\nin the exercise of its police power, enacts a regulation that goes\n\ntoo far in the regulation of private property, that governing body\n\nmay be held to have taken the property, thus requiring it to pay\n\ncompensation to the owner.”              32 TEX. JUR. 3D Eminent Domain § 9\n\n(1998).      The following factors are relevant in determining if the\n\nOrdinance has “gone too far” and effected a taking of Vulcan’s\n\nproperty: “(1) whether the property was rendered wholly useless;\n\n(2) whether the governmental burden created a disproportionate\n\ndiminution in economic value or caused a total destruction of the\n\nvalue; and (3) whether the government’s action against an economic\n\ninterest of an owner was for its own advantage.”               Id.\n\n       In the instant case, we think that the Tehuacana Ordinance\n\ngoes too far to be considered a mere exercise of the City’s police\n\npower.      The only property interest at issue here is Vulcan’s lease\n\nof the right to mine limestone from these tracts and Tehuacana’s\n\nOrdinance effectively prohibits any and all mining of limestone\n\nwithin City limits.\n\n       The Ordinance makes clear that its purpose is to prohibit the\n\nvery   activity       that   Vulcan’s     leasehold    permits.       First,   the\n\nOrdinance      is    entitled   “AN     ORDINANCE   FORBIDDING    QUARRYING     OR\n                                          9\n\fBLASTING OPERATIONS WITHIN THE CITY LIMITS.” Second, the Ordinance\n\nmakes clear that it is targeting “a rock quarry operating near the\n\ncity limits [that] has indicated its intention to begin quarrying\n\nand blasting operations within the city limits.”                Finally, the\n\nOrdinance expressly prohibits “the quarrying or mining of rock\n\nutilizing blasting operations or use of explosives” and “the use of\n\nheavy equipment in connection with quarrying or mining operations.”\n\n     In    sum,    it    is   simply   undeniable     that   the   Ordinance\n\nspecifically      was   adopted   to   completely    prohibit   Vulcan   from\n\nengaging in mining on Tracts 4-7, and that the only right possessed\n\nby Vulcan in Tracts 4-7 was the right to mine limestone.                   We\n\ntherefore hold that the Ordinance is a land use regulation.\n\n                                       IV\n\n     We now turn to address the district court’s holding that the\n\nOrdinance does not constitute a public taking of Vulcan’s leasehold\n\ninterest under the Texas Constitution.              The Texas Constitution\n\nprovides that “[n]o person’s property shall be taken, damaged or\n\ndestroyed for ... public use without adequate compensation being\n\nmade[.]”   TEX. CONST. art. I, § 17.4       Texas classifies takings into\n\n     4\n      Vulcan disputes the applicability of federal takings\nstandards in evaluating whether a taking has occurred under the\nTexas Constitution. Generally, Texas constitutional standards have\nbeen considered more protective of property owners than federal\nstandards. City of Glenn Heights v. Sheffield Development Co.,\nInc., 61 S.W.3d 634, 644 (Tex.App.-Waco 2001, pet. granted).\nHowever, in Mayhew v. Town of Sunnyvale, 964 S.W.2d 922 (Tex. 1998)\nthe Texas Supreme Court assumed, without specifically holding, that\nthe Texas and federal takings standards are coextensive. Mayhew,\n964 S.W.2d at 932. Like the Mayhew court, in the absence of clear\n                                       10\n\fone of two categories:        physical takings or regulatory takings.\n\nMayhew, 964 S.W.2d at 933.           A physical taking occurs when “the\n\ngovernment authorizes an unwarranted physical occupation of an\n\nindividual’s property.”       Id.    Because there is no allegation that\n\nTehuacana has physically occupied Vulcan’s property, if Vulcan is\n\nto be compensated the Ordinance must constitute a regulatory\n\ntaking.   Id.\n\n     A regulatory taking can occur in two ways: (1) when the\n\nregulation      does   not   substantially   advance    legitimate     state\n\ninterests, id. at 933-34, or (2) when the regulation either denies\n\nthe owner of all economically viable use of his property -- a\n\ncategorical taking -- or unreasonably interferes with a property\n\nowner’s rights to use and enjoy his property -- a partial taking.\n\nId. at 935 (citing, inter alia, Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal\n\nCouncil, 505 U.S. 1003, 1015-19 & n.8 (1992)).\n\n     “The ‘substantial advancement’ requirement examines the nexus\n\nbetween the effect of the ordinance and the legitimate state\n\ninterest it is supposed to advance.”            Id. at 934.       Numerous\n\ngovernmental      purposes     and     regulations     may   satisfy    the\n\n“substantially advance” prong including enhancing the quality of\n\n\n\n\nTexas authority, we will evaluate Vulcan’s claims under the more\nestablished federal standards, keeping in mind that greater\nprotection of property rights generally may be afforded under the\nTexas constitution.\n\n                                      11\n\flife   and     protecting    the   community    from   the    ill   effects   of\n\nurbanization.       Id. at 934-35.\n\n       Even    assuming,    however,    that   the   Ordinance   substantially\n\nadvances Tehuacana’s legitimate interests, a taking can still occur\n\nif the Ordinance denies Vulcan all economically viable use of its\n\nproperty or unreasonably interferes with its right to use and enjoy\n\nthe property.       Id. at 935 (citing, inter alia, Lucas, 505 U.S. at\n\n1015-19 & n.8).\n\n       Determining whether a regulation unreasonably interferes with\n\nthe landowner’s right to use and enjoy his property requires a\n\ncourt to consider “the economic impact of the regulation and the\n\nextent to which the regulation interferes with distinct investment-\n\nbacked expectations.”         Id. at 935 (citing, inter alia, Lucas, 505\n\nU.S. at 1019 n.8).         “The first factor, the economic impact of the\n\nregulation, merely compares the value that has been taken from the\n\nproperty with the value that remains in the property.”              Id. at 935-\n\n36.      The    second     factor,     the   landowner’s     investment-backed\n\nexpectations, considers the “existing and permitted uses of the\n\nproperty” as the “primary expectation” of the landowner.                Id. at\n\n936 (citing, inter alia, Lucas, 505 U.S. at                   1017 n.7).      In\n\ncontrast, “[d]etermining whether all economically viable use of a\n\nproperty has been denied entails a relatively simple analysis of\n\nwhether value remains in the property after the governmental\n\naction.”      Id.\n\n\n\n                                        12\n\f     Given the facts of this case and the limited nature of\n\nVulcan’s property interest, i.e., a lease for the sole purpose of\n\nmining limestone, it is clear that the “denial of all economically\n\nviable use” inquiry will be dispositive for the reasons set forth\n\nbelow.\n\n     In resolving whether “value remains” in Vulcan’s lease, we\n\nmust first examine which particular limestone mining rights are\n\nrelevant   to   this   determination    --   all   of    Vulcan’s   leasehold\n\ninterests or only Tracts 4-7.5         The district court held that the\n\nrelevant parcel in this case included not only the small acreage\n\nleased within the City limits (48 acres), but also the adjacent 250\n\nacres that is also part of the lease.6                  Vulcan attacks this\n\n\n     5\n      The City argues that the right to mine limestone possessed by\nVulcan is merely one of a “bundle of sticks” and that the value of\nthe entire bundle of sticks, as opposed to just one stick --\nVulcan’s leasehold interest -- must be totally diminished before a\ncategorical taking has taken place. This argument is misplaced in\nthis case.\n\n     Clearly, “where an owner possesses a full ‘bundle’ of property\nrights, the destruction of one ‘strand’ of the bundle is not a\n[categorical] taking because the aggregate must be viewed in its\nentirety” -- i.e., the relevant parcel includes all of the rights\npossessed by the owner.       Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v.\nDeBenedictis, 480 U.S. 470, 497 (1987) (quoting Andrus v. Allard,\n444 U.S. 51, 65-66 (1979)). Vulcan, however, does not possess a\n“full ‘bundle’ of property rights” and, therefore, the relevant\nparcel for the purposes of its takings claim is the only estate in\nwhich it has an interest -- the limestone lease -- and the value of\nother interests -- i.e., surface agricultural uses -- cannot be\nconsidered in determining whether all economically viable use of\nthe property has been destroyed. See generally The City of Whitney\nBenefits, Inc. v. United States, 926 F.2d 1169 (Fed. Cir. 1991).\n     6\n      This issue has been referred to as the “denominator problem”\nand has been described as follows:\n                                   13\n\fcharacterization of the relevant parcel and contends that the court\n\nshould consider only those tracts that the City had the authority\n\nto regulate -- Tracts 4-7.\n\n     Neither party has cited a Texas case directly on point and we\n\ntherefore must make an Erie \"guess\" and follow the rule that we\n\nconclude the Texas Supreme Court would adopt.      American Indem.\n\nLloyds v. Travelers Property & Cas. Co.,   335 F.3d 429, 435 (5th\n\nCir. 2003).\n\n     The City is correct that, under federal takings jurisprudence,\n\nwhen the owner of property intends to use a parcel of property as\n\nan integrated part of the whole of a larger tract, the entirety of\n\n\n\n          Essentially, the denominator factor works as\n          follows: if the amount of Blackacre owned by\n          Landowner is 2 acres, and the amount of\n          Blackacre   affected    by   the    government\n          regulation is 1 acre, the denominator is 2 and\n          the numerator is 1; thus, the property's use\n          is diminished by fifty percent.      The Lucas\n          rationale relied on a one hundred percent\n          deprivation of all economically viable use of\n          the property.     If a one hundred percent\n          deprivation is required, then the regulation\n          of property in the above example is not a\n          taking because Landowner may continue to use\n          one-half of Blackacre.\n\nStephanie E. Hayes Lusk, COMMENT: Texas Groundwater: Reconciling\nthe Rule of Capture With Environmental and Community Demands, 30\nST. MARY'S L.J. 305, 339 (1998). In this case the numerator would\nbe the tracts of land affected by the regulation -- Tracts 4-7. If\nthe denominator is limited to Tracts 4-7, then Vulcan has been\ndeprived of one hundred percent of its property.      On the other\nhand, if the denominator includes the land outside Tehuacana City\nlimits in addition to Tracts 4-7, then Vulcan’s leasehold interests\nretain value even after the regulation, and consequently no\ncategorical taking has occurred.\n                                14\n\fthe property is treated as one tract for purposes of a takings\n\nanalysis.     Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis, 480\n\nU.S. 470, 497, 500-01 (1987); Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York\n\nCity, 438 U.S. 104, 130-31 (1978).              The Supreme Court explained\n\nthis rule in Concrete Pipe, in which it stated:\n\n            [A] claimant’s parcel of property [can] not\n            first be divided into what [is] taken and what\n            [is] left for the purpose of demonstrating the\n            taking of the former to be complete and hence\n            compensable. To the extent that any portion\n            of property is taken, that portion is always\n            taken in its entirety; the relevant question,\n            however, is whether the property taken is all,\n            or only a portion of, the parcel in question.\n\nConcrete Pipe & Prods. v. Construction Laborers Pension Trust, 508\n\nU.S. 602, 644 (citing Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 130-31, and\n\nKeystone, 480 U.S. at 497).\n\n     Although   these    cases    require       the   court   to    look    at    the\n\nintegrated whole of the landowner’s property, they do not extend to\n\nsupport the City’s contentions; although each case held that the\n\nrelevant    parcel   included    the    entirety      of   the     property,     the\n\nregulating   authority    had    the    power    to   regulate      all    of    that\n\nproperty.    For instance, in Penn Central the New York Landmarks\n\nPreservation Commission designated Grand Central Station as a\n\n“landmark” and the landmark site was designated as the tax block\n\noccupied by the Station.         Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 115-16.                 In\n\nconducting its analysis, the Supreme Court only considered other\n\nholdings of Penn Central in the Station’s tax block -- not its\n\nother holdings in the City.            Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 130-31.\n\n                                       15\n\fSimilarly, in Keystone, the Pennsylvania Subsistence Act only\n\nregulated a small fraction of Keystone’s property -- the support\n\ncoal -- but all of its interests -- mineral and support estates --\n\nin Pennsylvania were subject to the Act.   Keystone, 480 U.S. at 499\n\nn.27 (stating that “[t]he question here is whether there has been\n\nany taking at all when no coal has been physically appropriated,\n\nand the regulatory program places a burden on the use of only a\n\nsmall fraction of the property that is subjected to the regulation”\n\n(emphasis added)).\n\n     Thus in each of these cases the Supreme Court rejected the\n\nplaintiff’s attempts to segregate the adversely affected property\n\nfrom the regulated whole, and to claim it is the only relevant\n\nparcel.   See Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 130-31; Keystone, 480 U.S.\n\nat 499.   Vulcan, unlike the property owners in Penn Central and\n\nKeystone, however, is not arguing that the takings analysis should\n\nsegregate only the adversely affected parcel from the regulated\n\nwhole; it contends that the relevant parcel should include only the\n\nproperty “subject to” the regulation and not its remaining property\n\noutside the City limits, which is beyond the regulator’s reach.7\n\n     The City cites Appolo Fuels, Inc. v. United States, 54 Fed.\n\nCl. 717 (2002), and argues that the court in that case considered,\n\nas part of the relevant parcel, property beyond the reach of the\n\n\n     7\n      Indeed we would be presented with a different question if\nVulcan owned other adjacent land in the City which, although\nsubject to the Ordinance, would be unaffected by it.\n                                16\n\fregulating body’s jurisdiction.                Appolo owned several adjacent\n\ntracts of land, some of which were in the Little Yellow Creek\n\nwatershed and others that were not.                  The City of Middlesboro,\n\nKentucky and the National Parks Conservation Association filed a\n\npetition   with      the   Office    of    Surface     Mining    Reclamation    and\n\nEnforcement (“OSM”) seeking to have the area within the watershed\n\ndesignated as unsuitable for mining under the Surface Mining\n\nControl and Reclamation Act (“SMCRA”), 30 U.S.C. §§ 1201 et seq.\n\nThe    Director designated the entire petition area -- all of\n\nAppolo’s leases within the watershed -- as unsuitable for surface\n\nmining but agreed to allow underground mining from outside the\n\nwatershed.      In    response      to    this    designation    Appolo    filed   a\n\nregulatory takings claim.\n\n      Appolo,     contending     that      a     categorical    taking    had   been\n\neffected, argued that the relevant parcel, or denominator, should\n\ninclude only those areas within the watershed -- those areas where\n\nmining was prohibited.         Appolo, 54 Fed. Cl. at 724.               The court,\n\nhowever, rejected Appolo’s argument and held that the relevant\n\nparcel included other holdings of Appolo outside the watershed\n\narea, on which mining was allowed.                Id. at 728-30.\n\n      Contrary to the City’s argument, the court does not appear to\n\nhave included property over which the regulating authority had no\n\njurisdiction; all of Appolo’s property was subject to the SMCRA, an\n\nAct of nationwide force.             See Hodel v. Va. Surface Mining &\n\nReclamation Ass’n, 452 U.S. 264, 268 (1981) (noting that the SMCRA\n\n                                          17\n\fwas intended to establish a nationwide program to protect society\n\nand the environment from the adverse effects of strip mining). In\n\nany event, even if the City’s interpretation of Appolo is correct,\n\nwe hesitate to conclude that the Texas Supreme Court would be\n\npersuaded by a single Federal Court of Claims case.\n\n      Because    the       City    has   not    cited    any   authority,     Texas   or\n\nfederal,     that      considers         property       outside      the    regulator’s\n\njurisdiction in determining a taking, we cannot conclude that the\n\nTexas Supreme Court would adopt that position.                    Indeed, it appears\n\nself-evident        that    when    a    regulator      exercises     its   regulatory\n\njurisdiction to the fullest extent possible -- stripping all value\n\nfrom the property within its reach -- it has acted categorically --\n\ni.e.,     absolute    or    unqualified.          WEBSTER’S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL\n\nDICTIONARY   352 (1993).          Furthermore, it would seem incongruous to\n\nsay that when the regulating body has “seized” through regulation\n\nall value possessed by the owner it has acted non-categorically;\n\ninstead,     when    the    regulating         body   takes    all   that    the   owner\n\npossesses there is perforce a categorical, not a partial, taking by\n\nthat body.8     Accordingly, we hold that the relevant parcel in this\n\ncase is Vulcan’s leasehold interest on the property within the City\n\nlimits -- Tracts 4-7.\n\n\n      8\n      The situation would be different, of course, if the City of\nTehuacana were unincorporated without a governing authority, and it\nwere Limestone County that prohibited all quarrying on Tracts 4-7,\nwhile allowing quarrying on the remainder of Vulcan’s property.\nThe county would have exercised its authority in a non-categorical\nmanner.\n                                            18\n\f       In sum, the only property interest possessed by Vulcan is the\n\nright to mine limestone on the land.           Further, the only portion of\n\nthis property interest that is relevant to our takings analysis is\n\nthe quarrying right within the City.           Finally, in accordance with\n\nour discussion above, we find that the Ordinance effectively\n\nprohibits all mining of limestone on Tracts 4-7. Consequently, the\n\nOrdinance deprives Vulcan of all value of its property interest --\n\nquarrying rights -- in the relevant parcel -- Tracts 4-7.            We thus\n\nhold that the Ordinance constitutes a categorical taking, which\n\nrenders Vulcan’s relevant leasehold interest valueless.9\n\n                                        V\n\n       Finally, the City argues that, under Texas law, Vulcan’s\n\nproposed activities would constitute a nuisance precluding Vulcan’s\n\nrecovery of compensation. This argument finds its origins in Lucas\n\nv. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003 (1992).             There,\n\nwith       respect   to   regulations   that   prohibit   all   economically\n\nbeneficial use of property, Justice Scalia states:\n\n               Any limitation so severe cannot be newly\n               legislated or decreed (without compensation),\n               but must inhere in the title itself, in the\n               restrictions that background principles of the\n\n\n       9\n      Because we have found that the Ordinance constitutes a\ncategorical taking, it is not necessary to address Vulcan’s\nargument that the Ordinance constitutes a partial taking. Although\nVulcan’s interests outside the City are not part of the denominator\nwhen determining whether a categorical taking has occurred, this is\nnot to conclude that these interests are irrelevant in the\ncalculation of the value of the taken property interests when\ndetermining just compensation. Such matters are reserved for a\nlater time if and when such a determination is necessary.\n                                        19\n\f             State’s law of property and nuisance already\n             place upon land ownership. A law or decree\n             with such an effect must, in other words, do\n             no more than duplicate the result that could\n             have been achieved in the courts--by adjacent\n             landowners   (or    other  uniquely    affected\n             persons) under the State’s law of private\n             nuisance,   or   by    the State    under   its\n             complementary power to abate nuisances that\n             affect the public generally, or otherwise.\n\nLucas, 505 U.S. at 1029.        Thus, under federal law, even if the\n\ncurrent value of the claimant’s property has been destroyed, the\n\nclaimant cannot recover if the “background principles of the\n\nState’s law of property and nuisance” would have prohibited that\n\nactivity as a nuisance (the “nuisance exception”).\n\n     The City contends that under the Lucas “nuisance exception”\n\nthe Ordinance is not a taking because the City could abate Vulcan’s\n\nactivities as a nuisance and such a property restriction “inhered\n\nin the title itself” because “background principles” of Texas\n\nproperty law allow the state, or adjacent landowners, to abate\n\nnuisances.      Thus,   we   must   first   decide   whether   the   nuisance\n\nexception -- found in federal law -- would be applied by the Texas\n\nSupreme Court; if so, we must then decide whether the district\n\ncourt properly held that the exception barred Vulcan’s recovery in\n\nthis case.\n\n                                      A\n\n     Neither party has cited a case in which the Lucas nuisance\n\nexception has been adopted by the Texas Supreme Court; nor have we\n\nfound one.    So, once again, we are required to predict whether the\n\n\n                                      20\n\fprinciples set forth in Lucas would be adopted by the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt.    American Indem. Lloyds, 335 F.3d at 435.   We conclude the\n\nTexas Supreme Court would adopt such a rule in the proper case.10\n\n     First, although Mayhew does not cite the specific “nuisance\n\nexception” discussed in Lucas, it is evident in the court’s own\n\napplication of Lucas that the Mayhew court found the reasoning of\n\nLucas to be uniformly persuasive.     The Mayhew court cited Lucas\n\nmultiple times for various propositions.     Moreover, other Texas\n\ncourts have looked to Lucas when evaluating takings claims under\n\nthe Texas Constitution.    See County Line Joint Venture v. City of\n\nGrand Prairie, 2001 Tex. App. LEXIS 6000, *4 (Tex. App.--Dallas,\n\nAug. 31, 2001, writ denied); Texas Natural Resource Conservation\n\nComm'n v. Accord Agric., Inc., 1999 Tex. App. LEXIS 6898, *12-13\n\n(Tex. App. 3d Dis.--Austin Sept. 10, 1999).11         Although this\n\n\n     10\n      Although we make this particular determination, we recognize\nthat it is speculative.      However, because Texas courts have\nrepeatedly relied on Lucas in numerous cases, and heavily so in\nMayhew, and because we consider it to be the better rule, we\nconclude that Texas courts would apply the Lucas nuisance\nexception. We are fully aware of statements by Texas courts that\nthe Texas Constitution provides more protections to property owners\nthan the United States Constitution -- protecting against both the\ntaking and damaging of property. Even so, we do not see how the\napplication of this rule categorically negates such generalized\nfavorable treatment of property rights in takings cases.\n     11\n       We acknowledge that this court has previously held that Lucas\nis of doubtful relevance when considering a takings claim under the\nTexas Constitution. Hidden Oaks v. City of Austin, 138 F.3d 1036,\n1042 (5th Cir. 1998).     However, although Hidden Oaks cites the\nTexas Court of Appeals opinion in Town of Sunnyvale v. Mayhew, 905\nS.W.2d 234, 259 (Tex. App.–Dallas 1995, writ granted) (reversed by\nMayhew v. Town of Sunnyvale, 964 S.W.2d 922 (Tex. 1998)), it does\nnot cite the Texas Supreme Court’s opinion, Mayhew v. Town of\n                                 21\n\funcritical reliance on Lucas by the Texas Supreme Court is not\n\nconclusive of whether the Texas Supreme Court would have looked\n\nfavorably on the “nuisance exception,” it does impress us when\n\nmaking an Erie guess.\n\n     Moreover, although it is true that the analysis and holding of\n\nLucas now advocated by the City was not expressly adopted by\n\nMayhew, this failure certainly cannot be construed as a rejection\n\nof the nuisance exception by the Texas Supreme Court.       Mayhew\n\ninvolved a takings claim against the Town of Sunnyvale based on\n\nSunnyvale’s refusal to approve Mayhew’s development plan and to\n\nrezone property to accommodate his proposed subdivision.   Mayhew,\n\n964 S.W.2d at 926.   It was not necessary for the court to address\n\nthe effect of the nuisance exception upon a categorical taking,\n\nhowever, because the court found that Mayhew had not been denied\n\nall economically viable use -- his property retained a value of\n\nover $2 million. Mayhew, 964 S.W.2d at 937.12\n\n\n\n\nSunnyvale, 964 S.W.2d 922 (Tex. 1998), which heavily relies on\nLucas. Accordingly, it is now clear that Texas courts attribute\nsignificant relevance to Lucas.\n\n     12\n      Although Mayhew did not consider the Lucas “nuisance\nexception” with respect to a categorical taking, it did discuss a\nsimilar principle with respect to Mayhew’s investment-backed\nexpectations. The Mayhew court noted the \"primary expectation\" of\nthe property owner is shaped by the existing and permitted uses of\nthe property. Mayhew, 964 S.W.2d at 936 (citing Penn Central, 438\nU.S. at 136 and Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1017 n.7 (owner’s reasonable\nexpectations shaped by uses permitted by state law)).\n\n                                22\n\f     Second, we are persuaded that the “nuisance exception” is\n\nsimply a sound rule.    All property in Texas is held subject to the\n\nvalid exercise of the police power and the City is not required to\n\ncompensate Vulcan if its exercise of police power is reasonable.\n\nCity of College Station v. Turtle Rock Corp., 680 S.W.2d 802, 804\n\n(Tex. 1984).      “Although it is fundamental that the government\n\ncannot destroy the property of private citizens at will and without\n\njustification, the government is given, through its police powers,\n\nthe ability to abate public nuisances.”          LJD Properties, Inc. v.\n\nCity of Greenville, 753 S.W.2d 204, 207 (Tex.App. - Dallas 1988).\n\n     Third, courts should be cautious in finding a taking where the\n\nclaimant’s     activities   “are    tantamount   to   public   nuisances.”\n\nKeystone, 480 U.S. at 491.         This approach is consistent with the\n\nconcept of reciprocity of advantage as described by Justice Stevens\n\nin Keystone:\n\n          Under our system of government, one of the\n          State’s primary ways of preserving the public\n          weal is restricting the uses individuals can\n          make of their property. While each of us is\n          burdened somewhat by such restrictions, we, in\n          turn, benefit greatly from the restrictions\n          that are placed on others. These restrictions\n          are properly treated as part of the burden of\n          common   citizenship.     Long   ago  it   was\n          recognized that all property in this country\n          is held under the implied obligation that the\n          owner’s use of it shall not be injurious to\n          the community, and the Takings Clause did not\n          transform that principle to one that requires\n          compensation whenever the State asserts its\n          power to enforce it.\n\nId. at 491-92 (citations and quotations omitted).\n\n\n                                      23\n\f     Justice Stevens only recognizes that all property owners are\n\nrequired to use their property in a manner that does not constitute\n\na public nuisance.\n\n     Finally, it seems evident to us that the question whether the\n\nTexas    Supreme    Court    would     formally      incorporate      the    nuisance\n\nexception      as   part    of   a   takings       analysis   has     no    practical\n\nsignificance:       the    existence    of     a    nuisance,    vel       non,   will\n\nnevertheless be injected in this takings case at some point.                        We\n\narrive    at   this   conclusion       because      “a   right   of    recovery     is\n\nestablished by proof of injury to some right of the property, and\n\nthe damages are measured by the extent of the injury to that\n\nright.”    32 TEX. JUR. 3D Eminent Domain § 161 (1998).                Thus, Vulcan\n\ncannot establish damages unless it has a property right to mine\n\nlimestone; if it has no such right it can suffer no injury and,\n\nconsequently, has not been denied “just compensation” by the public\n\ntaking.    See Holly Doremus, Takings and Transitions, 19 J. LAND USE\n\n& ENVTL. L. 1, 12 (2003) (stating that “[t]he term ‘taking’ implies\n\nthe loss of something once held, which means a change in one’s\n\nproperty rights.      There can be no taking without change.”).                   It is\n\nonly a matter of what point this element is introduced into the\n\ncase -- no taking has occurred because of the “nuisance exception”\n\nor, assuming a taking, no damages were sustained because the\n\nactivity would be an abatable public nuisance. See LJD Properties,\n\n\n\n\n                                         24\n\f753 S.W.2d at 207 (stating that the “the government is given,\n\nthrough its police powers, the ability to abate public nuisances”).\n\n     Thus, we hold that if the effect of the Ordinance challenged\n\nhere -- the prohibition of Vulcan’s quarrying activities -- could\n\nhave been achieved through the courts via a nuisance action, no\n\nproperty rights of Vulcan have been taken because Vulcan’s use of\n\nits property was limited by the background principles of the Texas\n\npolice power right to abate a nuisance.\n\n                                B\n\n     Having determined that the Texas Supreme Court would apply the\n\nLucas nuisance exception in the proper case, we now address the\n\ndistrict court’s holding that Vulcan’s proposed activities inside\n\nTehuacana City limits would constitute a nuisance under Texas law.\n\nWe believe that its grant of summary judgment on this issue was\n\nerror.\n\n     First, Texas law seems clear that the activities in which\n\nVulcan seeks to engage -- those incident to the quarrying of\n\nlimestone -- are not nuisances per se.    City of Dallas v. Newberg,\n\n116 S.W.2d 476, 478-79 (Tex. App.--Dallas, 1938, no writ); Stone v.\n\nKendall, 268 S.W. 759, 761 (Tex. App.--Waco, 1925, no writ).\n\nGenerally, a lawful business is not a nuisance per se; instead, “a\n\nlawful business or other activity may become a nuisance in fact\n\nbecause of the locality in which it is carried on, or because it is\n\nconducted in an improper manner.”    54 TEX. JUR., Nuisances § 32\n\n(2003); see also Storey v. Central Hide & Rendering Co., 226 S.W.2d\n                                25\n\f615, 618 (Tex. 1950).       Accordingly, if the City is to avoid payment\n\nof   just    compensation    under    the    “nuisance   exception”    Vulcan’s\n\nactivities must constitute a nuisance in fact.\n\n      A     nuisance   in   fact   exists    when   an   act,   occupation,   or\n\nstructure becomes a nuisance as a result of its circumstances or\n\nsurroundings.     54 TEX. JUR. 3D, Nuisances § 5 (2003).          There is some\n\nconfusion in Texas whether the determination of a nuisance is a\n\nquestion of fact or law:           “Whether a given act or condition is a\n\nnuisance has been variously held to be a question of fact, a mixed\n\nquestion of law and fact, or a question of law.”                54 TEX. JUR. 3D,\n\nNuisances § 73 (2003).        However, there is authority holding that,\n\nif the complained of activity -- here quarrying -- is not a\n\nnuisance per se, “it is for the jury to determine whether a\n\nparticular thing, act, omission, or use of property ... is a\n\nnuisance in fact.”      Id.; see also Domengeaux v. Kirkwood & Co., 297\n\nS.W.2d 748, 749 (Tex. App.--San Antonio, 1956, no writ) (stating\n\nthat “[t]he fact finder must determine whether a particular thing,\n\nact, omission, or use of property is a nuisance in fact”); accord\n\nGulf Oil Corp. v. Vestal, 231 S.W.2d 523, 526 (Tex. App.--Fort\n\nWorth, 1950), aff’d, 149 Tex. 487, 235 S.W.2d 440 (Tex. 1951).                The\n\nweight of authority is in agreement.            See 58 AM. JUR. 2D Nuisances\n\n§ 236 (2003)(stating that “it is the function of the trier of fact\n\nor jury to determine whether a nuisance exists, that is, whether a\n\nparticular act, structure, or use of property which is not a\n\n\n                                        26\n\fnuisance per se is one in fact, unless reasonable minds cannot\n\ndiffer on the issue”); 66 C.J.S. Nuisances § 143 (2003)(stating\n\nthat “it is for the jury to decide whether a particular act or\n\nstructure or use of property, which is not a nuisance per se, is a\n\nnuisance in fact”).13\n\n     As discussed above, summary judgment is proper when, viewing\n\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to Vulcan, no genuine\n\nissue of material fact exists and the City is entitled to judgment\n\nas a matter of law.     FED. R. CIV. P. 56(c); Gillis, 294 F.3d at 758.\n\nIn this case, we conclude that summary judgment was inappropriate\n\nbecause a reasonable jury could differ as to whether Vulcan’s\n\nactivities would constitute a nuisance under Texas law.         Peel &\n\nCo., 238 at 398 n.37.\n\n     Initially, we acknowledge that there is persuasive evidence\n\nput forth by the City describing the negative impact quarrying has\n\nhad on the City of Tehuacana -- i.e., concussion, noise, dust,\n\nvibration, shaking of houses and furniture, fly rock, depletion of\n\ngroundwater, etc.     We also recognize that these activities are\n\noccurring adjacent to public streets and near several homes.\n\n\n\n\n     13\n      Our holding that whether Vulcan’s quarrying activities would\nconstitute a nuisance is a question of fact for the jury, does not\nconflict with our discussion supra that the ultimate question of\nwhether there has been a regulatory taking is a question of law.\nMayhew, 964 S.W.2d at 932-33 n.3. The existence of a nuisance is\nsimply one of the factual issues that must be made in resolving the\nultimate issue of whether a taking has occurred. Id.\n                                   27\n\f     Vulcan, however, challenges much of this evidence.                           For\n\ninstance,    Vulcan       disputes    the    consideration         of   flyrock    as\n\ncontributing to the nuisance because the flyrock incident cited by\n\nthe district court occurred while Smith Crushed Stone was operating\n\nthe quarry.        Instead, Vulcan contends that it has never had a\n\nflyrock incident during its operations at the Tehuacana quarry.\n\n     Second, Vulcan also discusses proactive measures it has taken\n\nto alleviate any adverse effects caused to Tehuacana residents as\n\na result of its quarrying activities.               These include implementing\n\nmeasures    to     effectively     control     dust,     notifying      neighboring\n\nlandowners    of    impending      blasts    and    only       conducting   drilling\n\noperations during regular weekday business hours, presumably when\n\nneighboring residents are at work.            Moreover, Vulcan contends that\n\nit operates numerous quarries at other locations without complaint\n\nand, in one instance, less than 500 feet from a school.                      Further\n\nVulcan contends that it has never been sued by anyone regarding its\n\noperations at the Tehuacana quarry nor has it ever been found to be\n\nin excess of state limits for vibration and noise.\n\n     For these reasons, we must conclude that summary judgment was\n\nerror in this case.             As compelling as the City’s evidence of\n\nnuisance    may    seem    to   be,   the    fact   of     a    nuisance    was   also\n\ncontradicted by Vulcan’s proffer. Accordingly, a jury question was\n\npresented on whether Vulcan’s quarrying activities on Tracts 4-7\n\nconstitute a nuisance under Texas law.\n\n                                        VI\n\n                                        28\n\f     In sum, the district court’s ultimate holding on summary\n\njudgment that the Tehuacana Ordinance was not a regulatory taking\n\nof Vulcan’s property is VACATED and the case is REMANDED to the\n\ndistrict court for a trial on whether Vulcan’s proposed operation\n\nof the quarry on Tracts 4-7 constitutes a nuisance under Texas law,\n\nand such other issues as in the district court’s judgment may\n\nbecome appropriate including, if necessary, a determination of\n\nVulcan’s damages.14\n\n                                              VACATED and REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n     14\n      We make clear that we are deciding this case under Texas law\nand, because many of the issues discussed herein have not been\ndecided by the Texas Supreme Court, we are making an Erie guess.\nConsequently, our holding here is likely to have limited\nprecedential value.\n                                29\n\f",

GRADY JOLLY, Circuit Judge:\n\n     Vulcan Materials Company (“Vulcan”) owns a land lease with the\n\nright to mine limestone.      The problem is that a substantial part of\n\nthe land and the mining is within the boundaries of the City of\n\nTehuacana (“the City”) in Limestone County, Texas. The City passed\n\nan Ordinance in 1998 forbidding quarrying or mining activities\n\nwithin the   City   limits.      Vulcan    contends    that   the   Ordinance\n\nconstitutes a public taking and violates its rights under both the\n\n\n     1\n      District Judge of the Western District of Louisiana sitting\nby designation\n\fUnited States and Texas Constitutions.           All that remains to be\n\ndecided in this appeal, however, is the propriety of the district\n\ncourt’s grant of the City’s Motion for Summary Judgment dismissing\n\nVulcan’s takings claim under the Texas Constitution. We ultimately\n\nhold that the case turns on whether the quarry mining constitutes\n\na public nuisance and consequently remand for a jury determination\n\non this issue.\n\n                                    I\n\n     The City of Tehuacana has a population of approximately 300 to\n\n350 people and occupies a small geographical area in Limestone\n\nCounty, Texas.\n\n     In 1993, Smith Crushed Stone, Inc. (“SCS”) leased limestone\n\nquarry rights on three contiguous tracts of land (Tracts 1-3)\n\nadjacent to Tehuacana’s City limits and also leased four additional\n\ncontiguous tracts of land within the City limits.             It did no\n\nmining,   however,   on   these   tracts.   In    October   1997,   Vulcan\n\npurchased the assets of SCS in Limestone County, including the\n\nlimestone quarry rights leased by SCS.       This leasehold interest\n\nallows Vulcan to prospect, explore, mine, operate for and produce\n\n“by strip mining or open pit mining all rock, stone, limestone and\n\nsimilar rock like materials” and grants Vulcan the right to exclude\n\nall other uses of the Tracts as necessary to enable the quarrying.\n\n     Before its acquisition of SCS’s assets, Vulcan hired local\n\nattorney Bobby Reed to determine whether any ordinances would\n\nprevent Vulcan from quarrying, including those tracts located\n\n                                    2\n\fwithin the City.       Reed attested that both the Mayor and City\n\nSecretary advised him that no ordinances existed nor were in the\n\nplanning stages that would prevent Vulcan from pursuing quarrying\n\noperations within the City.\n\n     The leases cover land both within and outside the Tehuacana\n\nCity limits.    Vulcan sought to mine approximately 48 acres located\n\ninside City limits, described as Tracts 4-7.               This     property   is\n\n2/3 to 3/4 of a mile wide and abutted by several public roads that\n\naccess several homes, some of which are located just across the\n\nstreet from the property.          Outside Tehuacana City limits, Vulcan\n\ncurrently    mines   and   operates    a    rock   crushing   facility    on   an\n\napproximate    additional    250    acres    of    land   located    immediately\n\nadjacent to Tracts 4-7.\n\n     In early 1998, Vulcan began planning active quarrying on\n\nTracts 4-7.     Vulcan determined access points and ramp sites,\n\ndetermined where in that area it wanted to quarry, cleared land,\n\nstripped overburden, and otherwise prepared the tracts for physical\n\nuse. There has been no recent mining on these tracts.\n\n     In October 1998, Vulcan sought and obtained permission from\n\nthe Texas Railroad Commission to construct berms on Tracts 4-7.\n\nVulcan also prepared the quarry floor and removed overburden on\n\nTract 6 to prepare for a blast (“shot”) to loosen limestone in the\n\nquarry.     The City residents began to express opposition to the\n\nproposed operations and soon the City Council began to consider\n\nadopting an ordinance to regulate Vulcan’s quarrying activities.\n\n                                       3\n\f      Vulcan conducted a test shot on Tract 6 on October 25, 1998,\n\nin   an   abandoned     pit.   Another    shot   and   similar   preparatory\n\nactivities were conducted on Tract 6 on November 25 and 26, 1998.\n\nAlthough approximately 400-500 tons of limestone were processed\n\nthrough Vulcan’s plant as a result of these two blasts, this amount\n\nwas only a small percentage of what Vulcan normally retrieved and\n\nprocessed during one day in its regular operations.              Some of the\n\nfinished product was tested, and some was put into inventory and\n\nsold in the ordinary course of business.\n\n      Before it passed the contested ordinance, the City held public\n\nhearings.    Numerous citizens complained about Vulcan’s operations\n\noutside the City as well as the two blasts conducted inside the\n\nCity limits.    Specifically, the citizens complained that Vulcan’s\n\nactivities caused shaking of houses, lifting furniture off the\n\nfloor, rattling windows, shaking and jostling people in their\n\nhomes, noise, dust, smoke, property damage, fear, interference with\n\nenjoyment of property and life, interference with the use of public\n\nroads and streets, and exposure to fly and throw rock.             The City,\n\nand the district court, cite one flyrock incident in particular\n\nthat had occurred when SCS was conducting quarrying activities on\n\nthe tracts outside of the City in which a 500-pound boulder was\n\npropelled    into   a   Tehuacana   resident’s    yard.    Residents    also\n\ncomplained that the mining activities caused springs and wells in\n\nthe area to dry up.\n\n\n\n                                      4\n\f     On December 8, 1998, the City Council passed the “Ordinance\n\nForbidding Quarrying or Blasting Operations within the City Limits”\n\n(the “1998 Ordinance”) and on December 15, 1998, Vulcan filed its\n\ncomplaint in federal district court, under both the United States\n\nand Texas Constitutions.2    As mentioned above, the only claim\n\n\n     2\n      The 1998 Ordinance states, in pertinent part:\n\n          AN ORDINANCE FORBIDDING QUARRYING OR BLASTING\n          OPERATIONS WITHIN THE CITY LIMITS\n\n               WHEREAS, the City of Tehuacana is\n          predominantly a residential city, with little\n          of no industry inside city limits; and\n\n               WHEREAS, a rock quarry operating near the\n          city limits has indicated its intention to\n          begin quarrying and blasting operations within\n          the city limits of the City of Tehuacana; and\n\n               WHEREAS, the quarrying and blasting\n          operations would constitute a public nuisance\n          and result in excessive noise and vibration to\n          city residents; and\n\n               WHEREAS, the quarrying and blasting\n          operations could constitute a physical danger\n          to residents of the city due to the\n          possibility of overfly of rock or other\n          materials from blasting onto residents of the\n          city or property of residents of the city; and\n\n               WHEREAS, the blasting and quarrying\n          operations would have a detrimental effect on\n          the quality of residential life in the city\n          due to vibration, excessive noise from\n          blasting, excessive noise from the operation\n          of heavy equipment, the potential for injury\n          or death from overfly of rock, (flyrock), air\n          blast damage, ground motion damage, and\n          excessive dust from operations.\n\n               NOW THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY\n          COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF TEHUACANA:\n                                5\n\fremaining in this appeal is Vulcan’s takings claim under the Texas\n\nConstitution.\n\n     In its September 25, 2002 Memorandum Opinion and Order, the\n\ndistrict court granted the City’s Motion for Summary Judgment,\n\nholding that the 1998 Ordinance is not an unconstitutional taking\n\nor an inverse condemnation under Texas law.     The district court\n\nheld, as a matter of law, that the 1998 Ordinance substantially\n\nadvances a legitimate state interest.     The court also made the\n\nfollowing determinations with regard to Vulcan’s regulatory takings\n\nclaims:\n\n\n\n\n               SECTION I.     It shall be unlawful for\n          any person, company, entity, or corporation to\n          engage in the following activities within the\n          city limits of the City of Tehuacana,\n          Limestone County, Texas:\n\n                A.   the quarrying or mining of rock\n                     utilizing blasting operations or use\n                     of explosives, or surface mining;\n                B.   the use of explosives for the\n                     purpose of blasting rock, or in\n                     connection with mining or quarrying\n                     operations;\n                C.   the use of heavy equipment in\n                     connection with quarrying or mining\n                     operations within the city limits of\n                     Tehuacana, Limestone County, Texas;\n                D.   the use of explosives for any\n                     commercial or industrial activity or\n                     for any other reason except the use\n                     of fireworks in connection with\n                     celebrations as may be allowed by\n                     law from time to time.\n\nTehuacana, Tex., Ordinance 12898 (Dec. 8, 1998).\n                                 6\n\f          [T]he activities the 1998 Ordinance seeks to\n          regulate constitute a nuisance under Texas\n          law. The 1998 Ordinance therefore restricts\n          no legitimately owned property right. Even if\n          the Court were to assume that the 1998\n          Ordinance did somehow restrict a recognized\n          property right, a taking under Texas law would\n          not occur because Vulcan has not been deprived\n          of all economically viable use of its\n          property.    Only a small portion of its\n          property is affected by the Ordinance, and the\n          property still has an economically viable use.\n          Although Vulcan argues that high explosives\n          and heavy equipment are required to extract\n          the limestone from the ground, the Court notes\n          that neither were required to extract the\n          stone used to build the pyramids. Obviously,\n          while extraction of the limestone without\n          explosives and heavy equipment may be more\n          expensive and labor intensive, it is not\n          impossible to operate such a quarry without\n          violating the 1998 Ordinance.     Accordingly,\n          judgment will be entered to the effect that\n          the   1981   Ordinance   does   not   prohibit\n          quarrying, and that the 1998 Ordinance is not\n          an unconstitutional taking or an inverse\n          condemnation under Texas law.\n\nMem.

However, “if a governing body,\n\nin the exercise of its police power, enacts a regulation that goes\n\ntoo far in the regulation of private property, that governing body\n\nmay be held to have taken the property, thus requiring it to pay\n\ncompensation to the owner.”              32 TEX. JUR. 3D Eminent Domain § 9\n\n(1998).      The following factors are relevant in determining if the\n\nOrdinance has “gone too far” and effected a taking of Vulcan’s\n\nproperty: “(1) whether the property was rendered wholly useless;\n\n(2) whether the governmental burden created a disproportionate\n\ndiminution in economic value or caused a total destruction of the\n\nvalue; and (3) whether the government’s action against an economic\n\ninterest of an owner was for its own advantage.”               Id.\n\n       In the instant case, we think that the Tehuacana Ordinance\n\ngoes too far to be considered a mere exercise of the City’s police\n\npower.      The only property interest at issue here is Vulcan’s lease\n\nof the right to mine limestone from these tracts and Tehuacana’s\n\nOrdinance effectively prohibits any and all mining of limestone\n\nwithin City limits.\n\n       The Ordinance makes clear that its purpose is to prohibit the\n\nvery   activity       that   Vulcan’s     leasehold    permits.       First,   the\n\nOrdinance      is    entitled   “AN     ORDINANCE   FORBIDDING    QUARRYING     OR\n                                          9\n\fBLASTING OPERATIONS WITHIN THE CITY LIMITS.” Second, the Ordinance\n\nmakes clear that it is targeting “a rock quarry operating near the\n\ncity limits [that] has indicated its intention to begin quarrying\n\nand blasting operations within the city limits.”                Finally, the\n\nOrdinance expressly prohibits “the quarrying or mining of rock\n\nutilizing blasting operations or use of explosives” and “the use of\n\nheavy equipment in connection with quarrying or mining operations.”\n\n     In    sum,    it    is   simply   undeniable     that   the   Ordinance\n\nspecifically      was   adopted   to   completely    prohibit   Vulcan   from\n\nengaging in mining on Tracts 4-7, and that the only right possessed\n\nby Vulcan in Tracts 4-7 was the right to mine limestone.                   We\n\ntherefore hold that the Ordinance is a land use regulation.\n\n                                       IV\n\n     We now turn to address the district court’s holding that the\n\nOrdinance does not constitute a public taking of Vulcan’s leasehold\n\ninterest under the Texas Constitution.              The Texas Constitution\n\nprovides that “[n]o person’s property shall be taken, damaged or\n\ndestroyed for ... public use without adequate compensation being\n\nmade[.]”   TEX. CONST. art.

Id. at 934-35.\n\n       Even    assuming,    however,    that   the   Ordinance   substantially\n\nadvances Tehuacana’s legitimate interests, a taking can still occur\n\nif the Ordinance denies Vulcan all economically viable use of its\n\nproperty or unreasonably interferes with its right to use and enjoy\n\nthe property.       Id. at 935 (citing, inter alia, Lucas, 505 U.S. at\n\n1015-19 & n.8).\n\n       Determining whether a regulation unreasonably interferes with\n\nthe landowner’s right to use and enjoy his property requires a\n\ncourt to consider “the economic impact of the regulation and the\n\nextent to which the regulation interferes with distinct investment-\n\nbacked expectations.”         Id. at 935 (citing, inter alia, Lucas, 505\n\nU.S. at 1019 n.8).         “The first factor, the economic impact of the\n\nregulation, merely compares the value that has been taken from the\n\nproperty with the value that remains in the property.”              Id. at 935-\n\n36.      The    second     factor,     the   landowner’s     investment-backed\n\nexpectations, considers the “existing and permitted uses of the\n\nproperty” as the “primary expectation” of the landowner.                Id. at\n\n936 (citing, inter alia, Lucas, 505 U.S. at                   1017 n.7).      In\n\ncontrast, “[d]etermining whether all economically viable use of a\n\nproperty has been denied entails a relatively simple analysis of\n\nwhether value remains in the property after the governmental\n\naction.”      Id.\n\n\n\n                                        12\n\f     Given the facts of this case and the limited nature of\n\nVulcan’s property interest, i.e., a lease for the sole purpose of\n\nmining limestone, it is clear that the “denial of all economically\n\nviable use” inquiry will be dispositive for the reasons set forth\n\nbelow.\n\n     In resolving whether “value remains” in Vulcan’s lease, we\n\nmust first examine which particular limestone mining rights are\n\nrelevant   to   this   determination    --   all   of    Vulcan’s   leasehold\n\ninterests or only Tracts 4-7.5         The district court held that the\n\nrelevant parcel in this case included not only the small acreage\n\nleased within the City limits (48 acres), but also the adjacent 250\n\nacres that is also part of the lease.6                  Vulcan attacks this\n\n\n     5\n      The City argues that the right to mine limestone possessed by\nVulcan is merely one of a “bundle of sticks” and that the value of\nthe entire bundle of sticks, as opposed to just one stick --\nVulcan’s leasehold interest -- must be totally diminished before a\ncategorical taking has taken place. This argument is misplaced in\nthis case.\n\n     Clearly, “where an owner possesses a full ‘bundle’ of property\nrights, the destruction of one ‘strand’ of the bundle is not a\n[categorical] taking because the aggregate must be viewed in its\nentirety” -- i.e., the relevant parcel includes all of the rights\npossessed by the owner.

For instance, in Penn Central the New York Landmarks\n\nPreservation Commission designated Grand Central Station as a\n\n“landmark” and the landmark site was designated as the tax block\n\noccupied by the Station.         Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 115-16.                 In\n\nconducting its analysis, the Supreme Court only considered other\n\nholdings of Penn Central in the Station’s tax block -- not its\n\nother holdings in the City.            Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 130-31.\n\n                                       15\n\fSimilarly, in Keystone, the Pennsylvania Subsistence Act only\n\nregulated a small fraction of Keystone’s property -- the support\n\ncoal -- but all of its interests -- mineral and support estates --\n\nin Pennsylvania were subject to the Act.   Keystone, 480 U.S. at 499\n\nn.27 (stating that “[t]he question here is whether there has been\n\nany taking at all when no coal has been physically appropriated,\n\nand the regulatory program places a burden on the use of only a\n\nsmall fraction of the property that is subjected to the regulation”\n\n(emphasis added)).\n\n     Thus in each of these cases the Supreme Court rejected the\n\nplaintiff’s attempts to segregate the adversely affected property\n\nfrom the regulated whole, and to claim it is the only relevant\n\nparcel.   See Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 130-31; Keystone, 480 U.S.\n\nat 499.   Vulcan, unlike the property owners in Penn Central and\n\nKeystone, however, is not arguing that the takings analysis should\n\nsegregate only the adversely affected parcel from the regulated\n\nwhole; it contends that the relevant parcel should include only the\n\nproperty “subject to” the regulation and not its remaining property\n\noutside the City limits, which is beyond the regulator’s reach.7\n\n     The City cites Appolo Fuels, Inc. v. United States, 54 Fed.\n\nCl. 717 (2002), and argues that the court in that case considered,\n\nas part of the relevant parcel, property beyond the reach of the\n\n\n     7\n      Indeed we would be presented with a different question if\nVulcan owned other adjacent land in the City which, although\nsubject to the Ordinance, would be unaffected by it.\n                                16\n\fregulating body’s jurisdiction.                Appolo owned several adjacent\n\ntracts of land, some of which were in the Little Yellow Creek\n\nwatershed and others that were not.                  The City of Middlesboro,\n\nKentucky and the National Parks Conservation Association filed a\n\npetition   with      the   Office    of    Surface     Mining    Reclamation    and\n\nEnforcement (“OSM”) seeking to have the area within the watershed\n\ndesignated as unsuitable for mining under the Surface Mining\n\nControl and Reclamation Act (“SMCRA”), 30 U.S.C. §§ 1201 et seq.\n\nThe    Director designated the entire petition area -- all of\n\nAppolo’s leases within the watershed -- as unsuitable for surface\n\nmining but agreed to allow underground mining from outside the\n\nwatershed.      In    response      to    this    designation    Appolo    filed   a\n\nregulatory takings claim.\n\n      Appolo,     contending     that      a     categorical    taking    had   been\n\neffected, argued that the relevant parcel, or denominator, should\n\ninclude only those areas within the watershed -- those areas where\n\nmining was prohibited.         Appolo, 54 Fed. Cl. at 724.               The court,\n\nhowever, rejected Appolo’s argument and held that the relevant\n\nparcel included other holdings of Appolo outside the watershed\n\narea, on which mining was allowed.                Id. at 728-30.\n\n      Contrary to the City’s argument, the court does not appear to\n\nhave included property over which the regulating authority had no\n\njurisdiction; all of Appolo’s property was subject to the SMCRA, an\n\nAct of nationwide force.

In\n\nany event, even if the City’s interpretation of Appolo is correct,\n\nwe hesitate to conclude that the Texas Supreme Court would be\n\npersuaded by a single Federal Court of Claims case.\n\n      Because    the       City    has   not    cited    any   authority,     Texas   or\n\nfederal,     that      considers         property       outside      the    regulator’s\n\njurisdiction in determining a taking, we cannot conclude that the\n\nTexas Supreme Court would adopt that position.                    Indeed, it appears\n\nself-evident        that    when    a    regulator      exercises     its   regulatory\n\njurisdiction to the fullest extent possible -- stripping all value\n\nfrom the property within its reach -- it has acted categorically --\n\ni.e.,     absolute    or    unqualified.          WEBSTER’S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL\n\nDICTIONARY   352 (1993).          Furthermore, it would seem incongruous to\n\nsay that when the regulating body has “seized” through regulation\n\nall value possessed by the owner it has acted non-categorically;\n\ninstead,     when    the    regulating         body   takes    all   that    the   owner\n\npossesses there is perforce a categorical, not a partial, taking by\n\nthat body.8     Accordingly, we hold that the relevant parcel in this\n\ncase is Vulcan’s leasehold interest on the property within the City\n\nlimits -- Tracts 4-7.\n\n\n      8\n      The situation would be different, of course, if the City of\nTehuacana were unincorporated without a governing authority, and it\nwere Limestone County that prohibited all quarrying on Tracts 4-7,\nwhile allowing quarrying on the remainder of Vulcan’s property.\nThe county would have exercised its authority in a non-categorical\nmanner.\n                                            18\n\f       In sum, the only property interest possessed by Vulcan is the\n\nright to mine limestone on the land.           Further, the only portion of\n\nthis property interest that is relevant to our takings analysis is\n\nthe quarrying right within the City.           Finally, in accordance with\n\nour discussion above, we find that the Ordinance effectively\n\nprohibits all mining of limestone on Tracts 4-7. Consequently, the\n\nOrdinance deprives Vulcan of all value of its property interest --\n\nquarrying rights -- in the relevant parcel -- Tracts 4-7.            We thus\n\nhold that the Ordinance constitutes a categorical taking, which\n\nrenders Vulcan’s relevant leasehold interest valueless.9\n\n                                        V\n\n       Finally, the City argues that, under Texas law, Vulcan’s\n\nproposed activities would constitute a nuisance precluding Vulcan’s\n\nrecovery of compensation.

There,\n\nwith       respect   to   regulations   that   prohibit   all   economically\n\nbeneficial use of property, Justice Scalia states:\n\n               Any limitation so severe cannot be newly\n               legislated or decreed (without compensation),\n               but must inhere in the title itself, in the\n               restrictions that background principles of the\n\n\n       9\n      Because we have found that the Ordinance constitutes a\ncategorical taking, it is not necessary to address Vulcan’s\nargument that the Ordinance constitutes a partial taking. Although\nVulcan’s interests outside the City are not part of the denominator\nwhen determining whether a categorical taking has occurred, this is\nnot to conclude that these interests are irrelevant in the\ncalculation of the value of the taken property interests when\ndetermining just compensation. Such matters are reserved for a\nlater time if and when such a determination is necessary.\n                                        19\n\f             State’s law of property and nuisance already\n             place upon land ownership. A law or decree\n             with such an effect must, in other words, do\n             no more than duplicate the result that could\n             have been achieved in the courts--by adjacent\n             landowners   (or    other  uniquely    affected\n             persons) under the State’s law of private\n             nuisance,   or   by    the State    under   its\n             complementary power to abate nuisances that\n             affect the public generally, or otherwise.\n\nLucas, 505 U.S. at 1029.        Thus, under federal law, even if the\n\ncurrent value of the claimant’s property has been destroyed, the\n\nclaimant cannot recover if the “background principles of the\n\nState’s law of property and nuisance” would have prohibited that\n\nactivity as a nuisance (the “nuisance exception”).\n\n     The City contends that under the Lucas “nuisance exception”\n\nthe Ordinance is not a taking because the City could abate Vulcan’s\n\nactivities as a nuisance and such a property restriction “inhered\n\nin the title itself” because “background principles” of Texas\n\nproperty law allow the state, or adjacent landowners, to abate\n\nnuisances.      Thus,   we   must   first   decide   whether   the   nuisance\n\nexception -- found in federal law -- would be applied by the Texas\n\nSupreme Court; if so, we must then decide whether the district\n\ncourt properly held that the exception barred Vulcan’s recovery in\n\nthis case.\n\n                                      A\n\n     Neither party has cited a case in which the Lucas nuisance\n\nexception has been adopted by the Texas Supreme Court; nor have we\n\nfound one.    So, once again, we are required to predict whether the\n\n\n                                      20\n\fprinciples set forth in Lucas would be adopted by the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt.    American Indem. Lloyds, 335 F.3d at 435.   We conclude the\n\nTexas Supreme Court would adopt such a rule in the proper case.10\n\n     First, although Mayhew does not cite the specific “nuisance\n\nexception” discussed in Lucas, it is evident in the court’s own\n\napplication of Lucas that the Mayhew court found the reasoning of\n\nLucas to be uniformly persuasive.     The Mayhew court cited Lucas\n\nmultiple times for various propositions.     Moreover, other Texas\n\ncourts have looked to Lucas when evaluating takings claims under\n\nthe Texas Constitution.    See County Line Joint Venture v. City of\n\nGrand Prairie, 2001 Tex. App. LEXIS 6000, *4 (Tex. App.--Dallas,\n\nAug. 31, 2001, writ denied); Texas Natural Resource Conservation\n\nComm'n v. Accord Agric., Inc., 1999 Tex. App. LEXIS 6898, *12-13\n\n(Tex. App. 3d Dis.--Austin Sept. 10, 1999).11         Although this\n\n\n     10\n      Although we make this particular determination, we recognize\nthat it is speculative.      However, because Texas courts have\nrepeatedly relied on Lucas in numerous cases, and heavily so in\nMayhew, and because we consider it to be the better rule, we\nconclude that Texas courts would apply the Lucas nuisance\nexception. We are fully aware of statements by Texas courts that\nthe Texas Constitution provides more protections to property owners\nthan the United States Constitution -- protecting against both the\ntaking and damaging of property. Even so, we do not see how the\napplication of this rule categorically negates such generalized\nfavorable treatment of property rights in takings cases.\n     11\n       We acknowledge that this court has previously held that Lucas\nis of doubtful relevance when considering a takings claim under the\nTexas Constitution.

This approach is consistent with the\n\nconcept of reciprocity of advantage as described by Justice Stevens\n\nin Keystone:\n\n          Under our system of government, one of the\n          State’s primary ways of preserving the public\n          weal is restricting the uses individuals can\n          make of their property. While each of us is\n          burdened somewhat by such restrictions, we, in\n          turn, benefit greatly from the restrictions\n          that are placed on others. These restrictions\n          are properly treated as part of the burden of\n          common   citizenship.     Long   ago  it   was\n          recognized that all property in this country\n          is held under the implied obligation that the\n          owner’s use of it shall not be injurious to\n          the community, and the Takings Clause did not\n          transform that principle to one that requires\n          compensation whenever the State asserts its\n          power to enforce it.\n\nId. at 491-92 (citations and quotations omitted).\n\n\n                                      23\n\f     Justice Stevens only recognizes that all property owners are\n\nrequired to use their property in a manner that does not constitute\n\na public nuisance.\n\n     Finally, it seems evident to us that the question whether the\n\nTexas    Supreme    Court    would     formally      incorporate      the    nuisance\n\nexception      as   part    of   a   takings       analysis   has     no    practical\n\nsignificance:       the    existence    of     a    nuisance,    vel       non,   will\n\nnevertheless be injected in this takings case at some point.                        We\n\narrive    at   this   conclusion       because      “a   right   of    recovery     is\n\nestablished by proof of injury to some right of the property, and\n\nthe damages are measured by the extent of the injury to that\n\nright.”    32 TEX. JUR. 3D Eminent Domain § 161 (1998).                Thus, Vulcan\n\ncannot establish damages unless it has a property right to mine\n\nlimestone; if it has no such right it can suffer no injury and,\n\nconsequently, has not been denied “just compensation” by the public\n\ntaking.    See Holly Doremus, Takings and Transitions, 19 J. LAND USE\n\n& ENVTL. L. 1, 12 (2003) (stating that “[t]he term ‘taking’ implies\n\nthe loss of something once held, which means a change in one’s\n\nproperty rights.      There can be no taking without change.”).                   It is\n\nonly a matter of what point this element is introduced into the\n\ncase -- no taking has occurred because of the “nuisance exception”\n\nor, assuming a taking, no damages were sustained because the\n\nactivity would be an abatable public nuisance. See LJD Properties,\n\n\n\n\n                                         24\n\f753 S.W.2d at 207 (stating that the “the government is given,\n\nthrough its police powers, the ability to abate public nuisances”).\n\n     Thus, we hold that if the effect of the Ordinance challenged\n\nhere -- the prohibition of Vulcan’s quarrying activities -- could\n\nhave been achieved through the courts via a nuisance action, no\n\nproperty rights of Vulcan have been taken because Vulcan’s use of\n\nits property was limited by the background principles of the Texas\n\npolice power right to abate a nuisance.\n\n                                B\n\n     Having determined that the Texas Supreme Court would apply the\n\nLucas nuisance exception in the proper case, we now address the\n\ndistrict court’s holding that Vulcan’s proposed activities inside\n\nTehuacana City limits would constitute a nuisance under Texas law.\n\nWe believe that its grant of summary judgment on this issue was\n\nerror.\n\n     First, Texas law seems clear that the activities in which\n\nVulcan seeks to engage -- those incident to the quarrying of\n\nlimestone -- are not nuisances per se.

Accordingly, if the City is to avoid payment\n\nof   just    compensation    under    the    “nuisance   exception”    Vulcan’s\n\nactivities must constitute a nuisance in fact.\n\n      A     nuisance   in   fact   exists    when   an   act,   occupation,   or\n\nstructure becomes a nuisance as a result of its circumstances or\n\nsurroundings.     54 TEX. JUR. 3D, Nuisances § 5 (2003).          There is some\n\nconfusion in Texas whether the determination of a nuisance is a\n\nquestion of fact or law:           “Whether a given act or condition is a\n\nnuisance has been variously held to be a question of fact, a mixed\n\nquestion of law and fact, or a question of law.”                54 TEX. JUR. 3D,\n\nNuisances § 73 (2003).        However, there is authority holding that,\n\nif the complained of activity -- here quarrying -- is not a\n\nnuisance per se, “it is for the jury to determine whether a\n\nparticular thing, act, omission, or use of property ... is a\n\nnuisance in fact.”      Id.; see also Domengeaux v.

The\n\nweight of authority is in agreement.            See 58 AM. JUR. 2D Nuisances\n\n§ 236 (2003)(stating that “it is the function of the trier of fact\n\nor jury to determine whether a nuisance exists, that is, whether a\n\nparticular act, structure, or use of property which is not a\n\n\n                                        26\n\fnuisance per se is one in fact, unless reasonable minds cannot\n\ndiffer on the issue”); 66 C.J.S. Nuisances § 143 (2003)(stating\n\nthat “it is for the jury to decide whether a particular act or\n\nstructure or use of property, which is not a nuisance per se, is a\n\nnuisance in fact”).13\n\n     As discussed above, summary judgment is proper when, viewing\n\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to Vulcan, no genuine\n\nissue of material fact exists and the City is entitled to judgment\n\nas a matter of law.     FED. R. CIV. P. 56(c); Gillis, 294 F.3d at 758.\n\nIn this case, we conclude that summary judgment was inappropriate\n\nbecause a reasonable jury could differ as to whether Vulcan’s\n\nactivities would constitute a nuisance under Texas law.         Peel &\n\nCo., 238 at 398 n.37.\n\n     Initially, we acknowledge that there is persuasive evidence\n\nput forth by the City describing the negative impact quarrying has\n\nhad on the City of Tehuacana -- i.e., concussion, noise, dust,\n\nvibration, shaking of houses and furniture, fly rock, depletion of\n\ngroundwater, etc.     We also recognize that these activities are\n\noccurring adjacent to public streets and near several homes.\n\n\n\n\n     13\n      Our holding that whether Vulcan’s quarrying activities would\nconstitute a nuisance is a question of fact for the jury, does not\nconflict with our discussion supra that the ultimate question of\nwhether there has been a regulatory taking is a question of law.\nMayhew, 964 S.W.2d at 932-33 n.3. The existence of a nuisance is\nsimply one of the factual issues that must be made in resolving the\nultimate issue of whether a taking has occurred. Id.\n                                   27\n\f     Vulcan, however, challenges much of this evidence.                           For\n\ninstance,    Vulcan       disputes    the    consideration         of   flyrock    as\n\ncontributing to the nuisance because the flyrock incident cited by\n\nthe district court occurred while Smith Crushed Stone was operating\n\nthe quarry.        Instead, Vulcan contends that it has never had a\n\nflyrock incident during its operations at the Tehuacana quarry.\n\n     Second, Vulcan also discusses proactive measures it has taken\n\nto alleviate any adverse effects caused to Tehuacana residents as\n\na result of its quarrying activities.               These include implementing\n\nmeasures    to     effectively     control     dust,     notifying      neighboring\n\nlandowners    of    impending      blasts    and    only       conducting   drilling\n\noperations during regular weekday business hours, presumably when\n\nneighboring residents are at work.            Moreover, Vulcan contends that\n\nit operates numerous quarries at other locations without complaint\n\nand, in one instance, less than 500 feet from a school.                      Further\n\nVulcan contends that it has never been sued by anyone regarding its\n\noperations at the Tehuacana quarry nor has it ever been found to be\n\nin excess of state limits for vibration and noise.\n\n     For these reasons, we must conclude that summary judgment was\n\nerror in this case.             As compelling as the City’s evidence of\n\nnuisance    may    seem    to   be,   the    fact   of     a    nuisance    was   also\n\ncontradicted by Vulcan’s proffer. Accordingly, a jury question was\n\npresented on whether Vulcan’s quarrying activities on Tracts 4-7\n\nconstitute a nuisance under Texas law.\n\n                                        VI\n\n                                        28\n\f     In sum, the district court’s ultimate holding on summary\n\njudgment that the Tehuacana Ordinance was not a regulatory taking\n\nof Vulcan’s property is VACATED and the case is REMANDED to the\n\ndistrict court for a trial on whether Vulcan’s proposed operation\n\nof the quarry on Tracts 4-7 constitutes a nuisance under Texas law,\n\nand such other issues as in the district court’s judgment may\n\nbecome appropriate including, if necessary, a determination of\n\nVulcan’s damages.14\n\n                                              VACATED and REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n     14\n      We make clear that we are deciding this case under Texas law\nand, because many of the issues discussed herein have not been\ndecided by the Texas Supreme Court, we are making an Erie guess.\nConsequently, our holding here is likely to have limited\nprecedential value.\n                                29\n\f</pre>",
