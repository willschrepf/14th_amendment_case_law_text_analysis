EMPLOYEE\nLEADERSHIP FUND, et al.,\n\n                            Plaintiffs,\n                                                                Civil Action No. 12-1140 (BAH)\n                            v.\n                                                                Judge Beryl A.

Employee Leadership Fund (“the Leadership Fund”),\n\nStop This Insanity, Inc. (“STI”), 1 Glengary LLC, Todd Cefaratti, and Ladd Ehlinger bring this\n\nas-applied First Amendment challenge against three provisions of the Federal Election Campaign\n\nAct (“FECA”), namely 2 U.S.C. §§ 441a(a)(1)(C) and 441a(a)(3) (which limit the dollar amount\n\nof contributions to political committees); and 441b(b)(4)(A)(i) (which restricts the pool of\n\ncitizens from which connected political committees established by a corporation may solicit\n\ncontributions). 2 The Leadership Fund is a “connected” political action committee (“PAC”) 3 or\n\n\n1\n  The plantiffs refer to STI as both “Stop the Insanity, Inc.” and “Stop This Insanity, Inc.” in their Complaint.\nCompare Compl. ¶ 17, with id. ¶ 18. It appears that the correct name is Stop This Insanity, Inc. See Ariz. Corp.\nComm’n, Corps. Div., http://starpas.azcc.gov/scripts/cgiip.exe/WService=wsbroker1/corp-detail.p?name-\nid=15854462 (last visited Nov. 5, 2012).\n2\n  The plaintiffs also reference that they challenge the application of the source restrictions in 2 U.S.C. § 441b(a),\nwhich prohibits, inter alia, political committees from accepting contributions from corporations. See Compl. ¶ 1,\nECF No. 1; Pls.’ Mem. in Supp. Mot. Prelim. Inj. (“Pls.’ Mem.”) at 1, ECF No. 4-1. The plaintiffs do not clearly\narticulate the nature of their challenge to § 441b(a). In fact, the plaintiffs do not cite that provision anywhere in their\nthree causes of action, and they do not say that they seek declaratory or injunctive relief from that provision in their\nprayer for relief. See Compl. at 15–21. Because the plaintiffs only mention this provision in passing, the Court does\nnot construe the plaintiffs’ Complaint to state a claim for relief against that provision, and the Court will not further\naddress § 441b(a) in this opinion.\n3\n The term political action committee or “PAC” is generally used as a synonym for “separate segregated fund.” It\n“normally refers to organizations that corporations or trade unions might establish for the purpose of making\ncontributions or expenditures that the [FECA] would otherwise prohibit.” FEC v. Akins, 524 U.S. 11, 15 (1998); see\nalso BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 1276 (9th ed. 2009) (defining PAC as “[a]n organization formed by a special-\n\n                                                            1\n\f“separate segregated fund” of the corporation STI. Compl. ¶ 17, ECF No. 1. The Leadership\n\nFund seeks declaratory and injunctive relief that would allow it to solicit and accept unlimited\n\ncontributions to finance unlimited independent political expenditures through an independent\n\nexpenditure-only account not subject to the restrictions set forth in §§ 441a(a)(1)(C), 441a(a)(3),\n\nand 441b(b)(4)(A)(i). Id. ¶ 1. In their three-count Complaint, the plaintiffs seek a declaratory\n\njudgment that the prohibitions contained in these portions of the FECA are unconstitutional as\n\napplied to their proposed solicitation and contribution activities. Id. at 20–22. The plaintiffs also\n\nseek preliminary and permanent injunctive relief that would prohibit the defendant Federal\n\nElection Commission (“FEC”) from enforcing §§ 441a(a)(1)(C), 441a(a)(3), and\n\n441b(b)(4)(A)(i) against the Leadership Fund and any individual or corporate contributors to an\n\nindependent expenditure-only account established by the Leadership Fund. See id.\n\nI.       BACKGROUND\n\n         STI is a not-for-profit social welfare organization, incorporated in Arizona, which is\n\ncurrently seeking tax-exempt status under § 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code. See Compl.\n\n¶ 18. 4 The Leadership Fund is a separate segregated fund (“SSF”) that was established by and\n\nconnected to STI and registered with the FEC as a political committee on January 4, 2012.\n\nCompl. Ex. B at 3, ECF No. 1-1. Under the FECA, a corporation may establish an SSF to\n\nengage in political activities, see 2 U.S.C. § 441b(b)(2)(C), and “[s]uch a PAC . . . may be\n\nwholly controlled by the sponsoring corporation,” FEC v. Beaumont, 539 U.S. 146, 149 (2003).\n\n\ninterest group to raise and contribute money to the campaigns of political candidates who the group believes will\npromote its interests).\n4\n  An organization that is “not organized for profit but operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare . . .\nand the net earnings of which are devoted exclusively to charitable, educational, or recreational purposes,” is exempt\nfrom taxation under § 501(c)(4). According to its Articles of Incorporation, STI is a “political non-partisan non-\nprofit organization” that “will not represent any candidate or party” and “gather[s] donations and donate[s] to any\ncandidate or party that represents original US Constitutional principles.” See Articles of Incorporation,\nhttp://images.azcc.gov/scripts/cgi/dwispart2.pl (filed Feb. 25, 2010) (emphasis added).\n\n                                                          2\n\fAll SSFs, however, must register as “political committees” under the FECA. See 2 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 431(4)(B), 433. 5 Likewise, all political committees, including SSFs, are required to abide by\n\ncertain organizational, record-keeping, and reporting requirements, see 2 U.S.C. §§ 432, 433,\n\n434, as well as contribution limits, see id. § 441a. Under the contribution limits, no person is\n\nallowed to make “contributions” to any “other political committee” (which includes SSFs) “in\n\nany calendar year which, in the aggregate, exceed $5,000.” Id. § 441a(a)(1)(C). Additionally,\n\nSSFs are uniquely required to observe certain limits upon the universe of people from whom\n\nthey solicit contributions. Specifically, subject to certain limited exceptions, it is unlawful “for a\n\ncorporation, or a separate segregated fund established by a corporation, to solicit contributions to\n\nsuch a fund from any person other than its stockholders and their families and its executive or\n\nadministrative personnel and their families.” Id. § 441b(b)(4)(A)(i). 6 The Leadership Fund\n\nasserts that these restrictions on the solicitations and contributions of connected PACs are\n\nunconstitutional as applied to it, in light of recent developments in the law of campaign finance\n\nand the First Amendment.\n\n        Currently, the Leadership Fund maintains a single bank account into which it receives\n\n“hard money” 7 contributions that are subject to the contribution limits, solicitation restrictions,\n\nand reporting and disclosure requirements of the FECA. Compl. Ex. A at 2, ECF No. 1-1. 8 The\n\n\n\n5\n Other types of associations may also establish SSFs, including labor organizations, membership organizations, or\ncooperatives. See 2 U.S.C. § 441b(b)(2)(C). This case, however, only involves an SSF established by a corporation.\n6\n  The FECA defines “executive or administrative personnel” to mean “individuals employed by a corporation who\nare paid on a salary, rather than hourly, basis and who have policymaking, managerial, professional, or supervisory\nresponsibilities.” 2 U.S.C. § 441b(b)(7).\n7\n  The term “hard money” refers to “contributions subject to [FECA’s] source, amount, and disclosure requirements.”\nSee Shays v. FEC, 528 F.3d 914, 917 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nConversely, “soft money” refers to “[p]olitical donations made in such a way as to avoid federal regulations or\nlimits.” Id. (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n8\n The FECA defines “contributions” as “any gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or anything of\nvalue made by any person for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office” or “the payment by any\n\n                                                         3\n\fLeadership Fund wants to use the funds from this bank account to make direct contributions to\n\ncandidates for federal political office. Compl. ¶ 23. The Leadership Fund, however, would also\n\nlike to expand its political activities to include “independent expenditures,” id., which are\n\nexpenditures “expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate” but\n\nthat are “not made in concert or cooperation with or at the request or suggestion of such\n\ncandidate, the candidate’s authorized political committee, or their agents, or a political party\n\ncommittee or its agents,” 2 U.S.C. § 431(17). Since independent expenditures currently enjoy\n\nfewer restrictions than direct contributions to candidates, the Leadership Fund would like to\n\nestablish a second, separate bank account, for which it would like to solicit unlimited\n\ncontributions from the general public in order to finance its “independent expenditures.” Compl.\n\nEx. A at 2; see also Carey v. FEC, 791 F. Supp. 2d 121, 130–32 (D.D.C. 2011) (approving\n\n“separate accounts for hard-money and soft-money contributions and expenditures”). This\n\nseparate account would not be used to contribute directly to candidates, political parties, or other\n\npolitical committees, and is therefore sometimes referred to as a “non-contribution” account or,\n\nmore accurately, an “independent expenditure-only account.”\n\n        To that end, the Leadership Fund submitted an advisory opinion request to the FEC on\n\nJanuary 4, 2012, asking the FEC “whether it may open a[n] [independent expenditure-only]\n\naccount . . . to accept contributions from individuals, corporations, and unions that is not subject\n\nto the limitations and prohibitions of 2 U.S.C. § 441a(a)(1)(C) or § 441b . . . to conduct\n\nIndependent Expenditures and proportionally pay[] an appropriately tailored share of\n\nadministrative expenses.” Compl. Ex. A at 1; see also 2 U.S.C. § 437f(a) (requiring the FEC to\n\nrender a written advisory opinion in response to a “complete written request concerning the\n\n\nperson of compensation for the personal services of another person which are rendered to a political committee\nwithout charge for any purpose.” 2 U.S.C. § 431(8)(A).\n\n                                                         4\n\fapplication of [the FECA] or a rule or regulation prescribed by the [FEC], with respect to a\n\nspecific transaction or activity by the person”).\n\n        On February 17, 2012, the FEC issued two draft advisory opinions in response to the\n\nLeadership Fund’s request. The first draft advisory opinion (“Draft A”) concluded that the\n\nLeadership Fund “may establish a[n] [independent expenditure-only] account and solicit and\n\naccept unlimited contributions from individuals, other political committees, corporations, and\n\nlabor organizations, STI itself, and STI’s restricted class” for the purpose of financing\n\nindependent expenditures. Compl. Ex. B at 2. The second draft advisory opinion (“Draft B”),\n\nhowever, reached the opposite conclusion: “the [FECA] and [FEC] regulations prohibit [the\n\nLeadership Fund] and STI from establishing a[n] [independent expenditure-only] account for\n\n[the Leadership Fund] that would receive unlimited contributions solicited from all STI\n\nemployees and the general public for the purpose of financing independent expenditures.” Id.\n\nEx. C at 4, ECF No. 1-1. Both of these advisory opinions recognized that none of the recent\n\njudicial decisions issued in the realm of campaign finance and the First Amendment directly\n\naddress whether FECA’s contribution limits and solicitation restrictions are constitutional as\n\napplied to an SSF, i.e., a political committee connected to a corporation or labor organization.\n\nId. Ex. B at 7; id. Ex. C at 6–7.\n\n        On March 2, 2012, the FEC certified that it had failed on a vote of 3-3 to approve either\n\ndraft advisory opinion. See Compl. Ex. D at 1, ECF No. 1-1. 9 Without the FEC’s blessing, the\n\nLeadership Fund was (and continues to be) unable to solicit contributions for independent\n\nexpenditures without being subject to the contribution limits in § 441a(a) or the solicitation\n\nrestrictions in § 441b(b)(4)(A) because the Leadership Fund alleges that it “will face a credible\n\n9\n The FEC is required to approve any advisory opinion by the affirmative votes of four members. See 11 C.F.R.\n§ 112.4(a) (2012).\n\n                                                       5\n\fthreat of prosecution if it solicits or accepts contributions to a[n] [independent expenditure-only]\n\naccount in excess of the limits contained in 2 U.S.C. §§ 441a(a)(1)(C) and 441a(a)(3)” or “in\n\nderogation of the restriction at 2 U.S.C. § 441b(b)(4)(A)(i).” Compl. ¶¶ 51, 52. Feeling\n\n“required to mute itself and curtail its activities” during the 2012 election cycle, id. ¶ 37, the\n\nLeadership Fund—along with its connected corporate entity (STI) and three potential donors\n\nwho wish to make contributions to the Leadership Fund but are currently prohibited by the\n\nFECA from doing so (Glengary LLC, Todd Cefaratti, and Ladd Ehlinger)—filed the Complaint\n\nin the instant action on July 10, 2012. Pending before the Court are the plaintiffs’ Motion for\n\nPreliminary Injunction and the FEC’s Motion to Dismiss. 10 For the reasons discussed below, the\n\nCourt will deny the plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction and will grant the FEC’s\n\nMotion to Dismiss.\n\nII.        LEGAL STANDARDS\n\n           A.      Preliminary Injunction\n\n           The purpose of a preliminary injunction “is merely to preserve the relative positions of\n\nthe parties until a trial on the merits can be held.” Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395\n\n(1981). It is “an extraordinary and drastic remedy” and “should not be granted unless the\n\nmovant, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.” Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U.S.\n\n968, 972 (1997) (emphasis and internal quotation mark omitted). Plaintiffs seeking a\n\npreliminary injunction must establish that (1) they are likely to succeed on the merits of their\n\nclaims; (2) they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) the\n\nbalance of equities tip in their favor; and (4) and injunction is in the public interest. Winter v.\n\nNatural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008); accord Gordon v. Holder, 632 F.3d 722,\n\n724 (D.C. Cir. 2011).\n10\n     The FEC’s Motion to Dismiss became fully briefed on October 18, 2012.\n\n                                                         6\n\f       Historically, these four factors have been evaluated on a “sliding scale” in this Circuit,\n\nsuch that “[i]f the movant makes an unusually strong showing on one of the factors, then it does\n\nnot necessarily have to make as strong a showing on another factor.” Davis v. Pension Benefit\n\nGuar. Corp., 571 F.3d 1288, 1291–92 (D.C. Cir. 2009). Recently, however, the continued\n\nviability of that approach has been called into some doubt, as the D.C. Circuit has suggested,\n\nwithout holding, that a likelihood of success on the merits is an independent, free-standing\n\nrequirement for a preliminary injunction. See Sherley v. Sebelius, 644 F.3d 388, 392–93 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2011) (“[W]e read Winter at least to suggest if not to hold ‘that a likelihood of success is an\n\nindependent, free-standing requirement for a preliminary injunction.’” (citation omitted) (quoting\n\nDavis, 571 F.3d at 1296 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring))). Absent binding authority or clear\n\nguidance from the Court of Appeals, however, the Court finds that the most prudent course is to\n\nbypass this unresolved issue and proceed to explain why a preliminary injunction is not\n\nappropriate under the “sliding scale” framework. If the plaintiffs cannot meet the less\n\ndemanding “sliding scale” standard, then they cannot satisfy the more stringent standard alluded\n\nto by the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals.\n\n       That being said, in meeting the requisite burden for injunctive relief, “[i]t is particularly\n\nimportant for the movant to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits.” Konarski v.\n\nDonovan, 763 F. Supp. 2d 128, 132 (D.D.C. 2011). Indeed, “absent a ‘substantial indication of\n\nprobable success [on the merits], there would be no justification for the court’s intrusion into the\n\nordinary processes of administration and judicial review.’” Am. Bankers Ass’n v. Nat’l Credit\n\nUnion Admin., 38 F. Supp. 2d 114, 140 (D.D.C. 1999) (alteration in original) (quoting Wash.\n\nMetro. Area Transit Comm’n v. Holiday Tours, Inc., 559 F.2d 841, 843 (D.C. Cir. 1977)).\n\nAssessing the likelihood of success on the merits “does not involve a final determination of the\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fmerits, but rather the exercise of sound judicial discretion on the need for interim relief.” Nat’l\n\nOrg. for Women v. Soc. Sec. Admin., 736 F.2d 727, 733 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). “As an extraordinary remedy, courts should grant such relief sparingly.”\n\nKonarski, 763 F. Supp. 2d at 133 (citing Mazurek, 520 U.S. at 972); see also Dorfmann v.\n\nBoozer, 414 F.2d 1168, 1173 (D.C. Cir. 1969) (“The power to issue a preliminary injunction,\n\nespecially a mandatory one, should be sparingly exercised.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n        B.      Motion to Dismiss\n\n        To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a plaintiff need only plead “enough\n\nfacts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face” and to “nudge[] [his or her] claims\n\nacross the line from conceivable to plausible.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570\n\n(2007); see also FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6). “[A] complaint [does not] suffice if it tenders ‘naked\n\nassertion[s]’ devoid of ‘further factual enhancement.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678\n\n(2009) (alteration in original) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557). Instead, the complaint must\n\nplead facts that are more than “‘merely consistent with’ a defendant’s liability”; “the plaintiff\n\n[must] plead[] factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the\n\ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556); accord\n\nRudder v. Williams, 666 F.3d 790, 794 (D.C. Cir. 2012). The Court “must assume all the\n\nallegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact) . . . [and] must give the plaintiff the\n\nbenefit of all reasonable inferences derived from the facts alleged.” Aktieselskabet AF 21.\n\nNovember 2001 v. Fame Jeans Inc., 525 F.3d 8, 17 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (citations and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                                   8\n\fIII.   DISCUSSION\n\n       This is the most recent attempt by a non-profit entity to invalidate, on First Amendment\n\ngrounds, federal regulations related to independent political expenditures. Such challenges\n\nwithin this Circuit and before the Supreme Court have enjoyed almost universal success in recent\n\nyears on the premise that “independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do\n\nnot give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.” Citizens United v. FEC, 130 S. Ct.\n\n876, 909 (2010); see also SpeechNow.org v. FEC, 599 F.3d 686, 696 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (“[T]he\n\ngovernment can have no anti-corruption interest in limiting contributions to independent\n\nexpenditure-only organizations.”); EMILY’s List v. FEC, 581 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2009)\n\n(“[L]imiting donations to and spending by non-profits in order to prevent corruption of\n\ncandidates and officeholders represents a kind of ‘prophylaxis-upon-prophylaxis’ regulation to\n\nwhich the Supreme Court has emphatically stated, ‘Enough is enough.’” (quoting FEC v. Wis.\n\nRight to Life, Inc. (“WRTL”), 551 U.S. 449, 478–79 (2007))). It is of course not the Court’s\n\nprerogative to question the authority of these decisions, but as the following discussion makes\n\nclear, the implications of Citizens United and its progeny do not compel the relief the plaintiffs\n\nseek. The Court will first assess the plaintiffs’ probability of success on the merits before\n\nevaluating the plaintiffs’ showing on the other three preliminary injunction factors.\n\n       A.      Probability of Success on the Merits\n\n       In assessing the viability of the plaintiffs’ as-applied constitutional challenge, it is critical\n\nto observe that this is a case about regulating the solicitation and fundraising activities of\n\n“connected” SSFs—PACs that are established, administered, and subsidized by corporations.\n\nSSFs have unique characteristics that come to bear on the Court’s analysis below.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   9\n\f        First, although all political committees must disclose the amount of all “contributions”\n\nthey receive and the source of any such contributions over $200, see 2 U.S.C. §§ 434(b)(2)(A),\n\n434(b)(3)(A), the FECA specifically exempts from the definition of “contributions” any funds\n\nused for “the establishment, administration, and solicitation of contributions to a [SSF] to be\n\nutilized for political purposes by a corporation,” id. § 441b(b)(2)(C). Therefore, any funds\n\nprovided by a corporation to finance the administration and solicitation of contributions to its\n\nSSF need not be disclosed to the government and need not count against the contribution limits\n\nestablished for political committees. See 2 U.S.C. § 441a(a)(1)(C) (limiting contributions to\n\n“other political committees,” which includes SSFs); id. § 434 (requiring disclosure of all\n\ncontributions and the source of any contributions over $200)\n\n        Second, although an SSF’s solicitation activities are permitted to benefit from\n\nundisclosed corporate subsidization, the FECA limits the universe of people the SSF may solicit:\n\nAn SSF may generally solicit contributions only from its connected corporation’s “stockholders\n\nand their families and its executive or administrative personnel and their families.” Id.\n\n§ 441b(b)(4)(A)(i). The SSF (or its connected corporation) may also solicit rank-and-file\n\nemployees of the connected corporation to contribute to the SSF as long as the solicitations are:\n\n(1) made in writing; (2) addressed to the employees at their residence; (3) made only twice per\n\ncalendar year; and (4) designed such that the SSF and its connected corporation “cannot\n\ndetermine who makes a contribution of $50 or less as a result of such solicitation and who does\n\nnot make such a contribution.” 11 Id. § 441b(b)(4)(B). Thus, there is a major statutory trade-off\n\nfor SSFs: an SSF can have all of its administrative and solicitations costs paid for by its\n\n11\n  This statutory mechanism, although admirably intended to prevent rank-and-file corporate employees from feeling\ncoerced into making political contributions, appears to be easy to circumvent. For example, any corporation intent\non discovering which employees failed to contribute to its connected PAC could refuse to accept any employee\ncontributions of $50 or less and, with this contribution minimum, could thereby deduce which employees gave and\nwhich employees did not.\n\n                                                       10\n\fconnected corporation and need not report the amount or source of those funds, but in order to\n\nenjoy those financial, non-disclosure, and non-reporting benefits the SSF must limit its\n\nsolicitation base. If, however, a political committee wishes to solicit contributions from the\n\ngeneral public, it must disconnect from its affiliated corporation, pay its own administrative and\n\nsolicitation expenses, and disclose and report the amount and source of all funds raised—\n\nincluding any funds that go toward administration and solicitation expenses. In essence, as the\n\nFEC points out, the plaintiffs are seeking relief that would create such a large loophole in\n\npolitical committee disclosure requirements that those requirements would be meaningless. See\n\nDef.’s Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. Prelim. Inj. (“Def.’s Opp’n”) at 15, ECF No. 6 (“This lawsuit,\n\nhowever, seeks to have the statutory disclosure exception swallow the rule . . . .”).\n\n       Third, since Citizens United, SSFs have become vestiges of a bygone world of campaign\n\nfinance. Section 441b’s original purpose was “to prohibit contributions or expenditures by\n\ncorporations or labor organizations in connection with federal elections,” and the SSF was\n\ncreated to “permit[] some participation of unions and corporations in the federal electoral\n\nprocess.” FEC v. Nat’l Right to Work Comm. (“NRWC”), 459 U.S. 197, 201 (1982). This\n\nlegislative compromise prevented corporations from directly engaging in political spending,\n\nwhile permitting corporations’ beneficial owners and employees to pool their personal resources\n\nto engage in organized political speech. SSFs continue to be a mechanism through which the\n\nbeneficial owners and employees of corporations can band together to make direct contributions\n\nto candidates and political parties, which corporations are still prohibited from doing directly\n\nunder the FECA and First Amendment jurisprudence. See, e.g., Beaumont, 539 U.S. at 161–63\n\n(upholding § 441b(a)’s prohibition on direct political contributions by corporations); see also\n\nGreen Party of Conn. v. Garfield, 616 F.3d 189, 199 (2d Cir. 2010) (“Beaumont and other cases\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\fapplying the closely drawn standard to contribution limits remain good law. Indeed, in the\n\nrecent Citizens United case, the [Supreme] Court . . . explicitly declined to reconsider its\n\nprecedents involving campaign contributions by corporations to candidates for elected office.”).\n\nYet, corporations no longer need SSFs to engage in unlimited independent expenditures with\n\ngeneral treasury funds. The Supreme Court eliminated this dependency in Citizens United by\n\nallowing corporations themselves (rather than just their constituent members, officers,\n\nemployees, etc.) to engage in unlimited independent political expenditures. See Citizens United,\n\n130 S. Ct. at 913. Thus, it bears mentioning that the relief sought by the plaintiffs in the instant\n\naction is completely unnecessary to allow the plaintiffs to engage in unlimited independent\n\nexpenditures, individually or together. Rather, this case narrowly touches upon the particular\n\naccounting mechanism through which the plaintiffs may make those expenditures.\n\n        Finally, the Supreme Court has recognized that SSFs are inherently suspect in certain\n\nrespects by virtue of the fact that a single entity (corporation, labor union, etc.) pays all of their\n\nadministration expenses. In California Medical Association v. FEC (“Cal-Med”), 453 U.S. 182\n\n(1981), the Supreme Court observed:\n\n        If unlimited contributions for administrative support are permissible, individuals\n        and groups like CMA could completely dominate the operations and contribution\n        policies of independent political committees such as CALPAC. Moreover, if an\n        individual or association was permitted to fund the entire operation of a political\n        committee, all moneys solicited by that committee could be converted into\n        contributions, the use of which might well be dictated by the committee’s main\n        supporter. In this manner, political committees would be able to influence the\n        electoral process to an extent disproportionate to their public support and far\n        greater than the individual or group that finances the committee’s operations\n        would be able to do acting alone. In so doing, they could corrupt the political\n        process in a manner that Congress, through its contribution restrictions, has\n        sought to prohibit.\n\nCal-Med, 453 U.S. at 198 n.19. Connected SSFs can essentially accept “unlimited contributions\n\nfor administrative support” because of the exemption in 2 U.S.C. § 441b(b)(2)(C) and therefore\n\n\n                                                   12\n\fofficials with control of the money spigot at the connected corporation can “completely dominate\n\nthe operations and contribution policies” of the SSF. See id. Moreover, SSFs may also accept\n\nunlimited amounts of undisclosed money from the connected corporation to pay for solicitations.\n\nSee 2 U.S.C. § 441b(b)(2)(C). Because of this, SSFs are “able to influence the electoral process\n\nto an extent disproportionate to their public support,” and can do so to an extent “far greater than\n\nthe [connected corporation] would be able to do acting alone.” Cal-Med, 453 U.S. at 198 n.19;\n\nsee also EMILY’s List, 581 F.3d at 12 n.10 (“The requirement that certain administrative\n\nexpenses be funded in part with hard money prevents a contributor from essentially taking\n\ncontrol of a non-profit and thereby circumventing limits on individual contributions to\n\ncandidates.” (citing Cal-Med, 453 U.S. at 198–99 n.19)).\n\n       With these facts in mind, the Court will first discuss recently established First\n\nAmendment principles regarding independent expenditures and the continuing vitality of\n\ncampaign finance regulations. Then, with those principles in tow, the Court will proceed to\n\nevaluate the probability that the plaintiffs will succeed on the merits of their claims that the\n\ncontribution and solicitation limitations in §§ 441a(a)(1)(C), 441a(a)(3), and 441b(b)(4)(A)(i) are\n\nunconstitutional as applied to SSFs that engage in both direct candidate contributions and\n\nexpress advocacy.\n\n               1.      First Amendment Principles\n\n       The First Amendment, which provides that “Congress shall make no law . . . abridging\n\nthe freedom of speech,” U.S. CONST. amend. I, is an enduring bulwark against improper\n\nintrusions upon “the exercise of rights so vital to the maintenance of democratic institutions,”\n\nSchneider v. New Jersey, 308 U.S. 147, 161 (1939). The First Amendment “is broadly staked on\n\nthe view that our country and our people” should enjoy broad freedom to engage in “a robust and\n\n\n\n                                                  13\n\funinhibited debate that is subject only to minimum controls necessary for the vitality of our\n\ndemocratic system.” See Nat’l Broad. Co. v. FCC, 516 F.2d 1101, 1132 (D.C. Cir. 1975).\n\nRelevant to the context of the instant case, “[t]he First Amendment ‘has its fullest and most\n\nurgent application to speech uttered during a campaign for political office.” Citizens United, 130\n\nS. Ct. at 898 (quoting Eu v. S.F. Cnty. Democratic Cent. Comm., 489 U.S. 214, 223 (1989)).\n\nAlthough allowing such a robust national conversation is certain to create passionate and, at\n\ntimes vitriolic, factions, “[f]actions should be checked by permitting them all to speak, and by\n\nentrusting the people to judge what is true and what is false.” Id. at 907 (citation omitted) (citing\n\nThe Federalist No. 10 (James Madison)).\n\n         The vitality of the First Amendment, however, is also predicated on the fact that the\n\nimportant rights subject to its protection are not absolute, and in certain contexts, must give way\n\nto other compelling governmental interests. 12 See, e.g., Times Film Corp. v. City of Chicago,\n\n365 U.S. 43, 47 (1961) (“It has never been held that liberty of speech is absolute.”); Marshall v.\n\nUnited States, 176 F.2d 473, 474 (D.C. Cir. 1949) (“The rights guaranteed by the First\n\nAmendment are not absolute, and are subordinate to the greater rights of the general public\n\ninterest, and to the right of the government to maintain and protect itself.”); Frederick Schauer,\n\nHarm(s) and the First Amendment, 2011 SUP. CT. REV. 81, 81 (“The First Amendment has\n\nalways had a delicate relationship with harm.”). Therefore, ironically, some speech must be\n\n12\n   The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized this principle in myriad contexts in recent years. See, e.g., Holder\nv. Humanitarian Law Project, 130 S. Ct. 2705, 2727 (2010) (rejecting idea that “it is possible in practice to\ndistinguish material support for a foreign terrorist group’s violent activities and its nonviolent activities” in\nupholding statute that criminalized appellant’s efforts to provide humanitarian and political support to organizations\nconsidered by the government to be “foreign terrorist organizations”); Morse v. Frederick, 551 U.S. 393, 403 (2007)\n(“The question thus becomes whether a principal may, consistent with the First Amendment, restrict student speech\nat a school event, when that speech is reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use. We hold that she may.”);\nBeard v. Banks, 548 U.S. 521, 533–35 (2006) (upholding Pennsylvania prison regulation that prevented some prison\ninmates from having any access to newspapers, magazines, or photographs); Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410, 421\n(2006) (“[W]hen public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, the employees are not speaking\nas citizens for First Amendment purposes, and the Constitution does not insulate their communications from\nemployer discipline.”).\n\n                                                         14\n\frestricted in order to permit a healthy, functioning democracy to march onward. See, e.g.,\n\nLARRY ALEXANDER, IS THERE A RIGHT OF FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION? 178 (2005) (“In liberal\n\nsocieties, free speech is important because it is believed to produce valuable consequences such\n\nas more truth, better democratic politics, and more individual self-development. But this means\n\nthat any freedom of speech principle carries with it a commitment to constrain speech that\n\ndestroys these things.”). One oft-discussed kind of potentially harmful speech is money spent in\n\nthe context of the electoral process. When money is conceptualized as speech, as the Supreme\n\nCourt has, 13 and when that pecuniary speech is given free reign to influence the election of those\n\nentrusted to lead and shape the character of our democracy, a legitimate and complex question\n\narises about what constitutional limits can be placed on the flow of money spent with a political\n\npurpose—limits intended to prevent behavior that corrodes the very legitimacy and integrity of\n\nour democratic institutions. In Citizens United, the Supreme Court reviewed—and rejected—the\n\ngovernmental interests used over the years to limit political speech, including “an antidistortion\n\ninterest,” and a “shareholder-protection interest,” and concluded that while “[t]he appearance of\n\ninfluence or access . . . will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy,” activity that\n\n“lead[s] to, or create[s] the appearance of, quid pro quo corruption” is a sufficiently compelling\n\ngovernmental interest to justify limits on political speech. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 909–13.\n\n\n13\n   See, e.g., Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 898 (“Section 441b’s prohibition on corporate independent expenditures is\nthus a ban on speech. As a ‘restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political\ncommunications during a campaign,’ that statute ‘necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the\nnumber of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.’” (quoting Buckley\nv. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 19 (1976))). Justice Stevens has observed that this conceptualization may be problematic:\n         Money is property; it is not speech.\n                    Speech has the power to inspire volunteers to perform a multitude of tasks on a campaign\n         trail, on a battleground, or even on a football field. Money, meanwhile, has the power to pay hired\n         laborers to perform the same tasks. It does not follow, however, that the First Amendment\n         provides the same measure of protection to the use of money to accomplish such goals as it\n         provides to the use of ideas to achieve the same results.\nNixon v. Shrink Mo. Gov’t PAC, 528 U.S. 377, 398 (2000) (Stevens, J., concurring).\n\n                                                         15\n\f         Both parties agree that corporate entities have the same First Amendment right as\n\nindividuals to engage in unlimited independent political expenditures. See Def.’s Opp’n at 1\n\n(stating that “a corporation’s First Amendment right to finance independent campaign advocacy”\n\nis “undisputed and not at issue here”). The Supreme Court established that principle nearly three\n\nyears ago in Citizens United. See 130 S. Ct. at 909 (“[W]e now conclude that independent\n\nexpenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the\n\nappearance of corruption.”). The D.C. Circuit has also established that other campaign finance\n\nregulations are unconstitutional as applied to non-connected political committees (i.e., political\n\ncommittees not established by a candidate, political party, labor union, or corporation). In\n\nEMILY’s List—a case decided shortly before Citizens United—the D.C. Circuit held that non-\n\nconnected political committees, which make direct contributions to candidates and political\n\nparties, have a constitutional right also to accept unlimited contributions to finance\n\n“expenditures—such as [ballot initiative] advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter\n\nregistration drives,” so long as they “ensure, to avoid circumvention of individual contribution\n\nlimits by [their] donors, that [their] contributions to parties or candidates come from a hard-\n\nmoney account.” See EMILY’s List, 581 F.3d at 12. 14 Six months later, shortly after Citizens\n\nUnited was decided, the D.C. Circuit held in SpeechNow that the contribution limits in 2 U.S.C.\n\n§ 441a(a) were unconstitutional as applied to contributions made by individuals to a non-\n\nconnected political committee that made only independent expenditures because “the\n\ngovernment can have no anti-corruption interest in limiting contributions to independent\n\nexpenditure-only organizations.” SpeechNow, 599 F.3d at 695–96 (“The contribution limits of 2\n\n14\n  In EMILY’s List, the D.C. Circuit held unconstitutional several FEC regulations that required non-profit entities\nregistered as political committees to spend “hard money” to pay for the costs of engaging in certain political\nexpenditures (e.g., generic voter turnout and registration drives, generic party advocacy) and limited the manner in\nwhich such groups could solicit funds used to support or oppose the election of a clearly identified federal candidate.\nSee EMILY’s List, 581 F.3d at 16–18.\n\n                                                          16\n\fU.S.C. § 441a(a)(1)(C) and 441a(a)(3) violate the First Amendment by preventing [individuals]\n\nfrom donating to SpeechNow in excess of the limits by prohibiting SpeechNow from accepting\n\ndonations in excess of the limits.”). Finally, in Carey, another Judge on this Court held that a\n\nnon-connected political committee may operate simultaneously as both a multicandidate political\n\ncommittee (making direct candidate contributions) and an independent expenditure-only political\n\ncommittee by establishing separate bank accounts for each activity. See Carey, 791 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 130–32.\n\n         A number of precepts—some broad, others narrow—can be derived from this body of\n\nrecent case law. First, EMILY’s List and Carey have endorsed the hybridization of political\n\ncommittees—at least when such political committees are not connected to a candidate, political\n\nparty, corporation, or labor union. In other words, “[t]he constitutional principles that govern . . .\n\na hybrid non-profit entity follow ineluctably from the well-established principles governing the\n\nother two categories of non-profits,” which either (1) make only direct contributions to\n\ncandidates or (2) make only “expenditures for political activities.” 15 EMILY’s List, 581 F.3d at\n\n12. An important aspect to acknowledge about EMILY’s List, however, is that although it began\n\nwith a very broad discussion of First Amendment principles, the Circuit’s holding was ultimately\n\nquite narrow. The case invalidated certain FEC regulations because they required a non-\n\nconnected, non-profit political committee to use its hard-money (i.e., direct candidate and party\n\ncontribution) account to pay for certain soft-money activities, namely “expenditures such as\n\nadvertisements [about ballot initiatives], get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter registration drives.”\n\nId. at 16. The Court’s holding was that “non-profits may not be forced to use their hard money\n\n15\n  The Circuit in EMILY’s List was careful not to use the statutory term of art “independent expenditure,” which is\nan expenditure “expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate,” 2 U.S.C. § 431(17),\nbecause the plaintiff in in EMILY’s List did not engage in any express advocacy communications that would have\nbeen considered “independent expenditures.” The Court instead referred more generally to “expenditures for\npolitical activities” or simply “expenditures.” See EMILY’s List 581 F.3d at 6–9, 11–12.\n\n                                                         17\n\faccounts” to pay for such expenditures. Id. Thus, EMILY’s List clearly announced that some\n\nlevel of hybridization is acceptable for registered political committees, but the Court left open\n\nthe question of how much hybridization is too much.\n\n         Carey, in turn, extended EMILY’s List. The court in Carey held that a non-connected\n\npolitical committee could combine direct contribution activities with not only generic political\n\nexpenditures but also “independent expenditures,” which by definition are expenditures that\n\n“expressly advocat[e] the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.” Carey, 791 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 132; see also 2 U.S.C. § 431(17) (defining “independent expenditure”). The “soft\n\nmoney” expenditures in EMILY’s List are distinct from the express advocacy contained in\n\nindependent expenditures, see, e.g., Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 910–11 (“This case, however,\n\nis about independent expenditures, not soft money.”), 16 yet Carey did not distinguish between\n\nthe express advocacy communications it was presented with and the generic soft-money\n\nexpenditures addressed in EMILY’s List. On the contrary, the court in Carey concluded that\n\n“[the plaintiff] and EMILY’s List are identical in that regard.” Id. at 130. Carey also dismissed\n\nany corruption concerns that might be present with a hybrid political committee that makes both\n\ndirect candidate contributions and express advocacy communications, citing the holdings of\n\nCitizens United and SpeechNow: independent expenditures do not give rise to corruption or the\n\nappearance of corruption. See id. at 135 (citing Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 909 and\n\nSpeechNow, 599 F.3d at 693). The court observed that: “EMILY’s List specifically addressed a\n\nhybrid nonprofit entity that both made independent expenditures and contributed directly to\n\n\n16\n  See also McConnell v. FEC, 540 U.S. 93, 123–24 (2003) (noting that “[political] parties could also use soft money\nto defray the costs of ‘legislative advocacy media advertisements,’ even if the ads mentioned the name of a federal\ncandidate, so long as they did not expressly advocate the candidate’s election or defeat”); EMILY’s List, 581 F.3d at\n12 n.11 (“[U]nder Austin [v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U.S. 652 (1990)], the soft-money account into\nwhich [corporate and labor union] donations are deposited cannot be used to fund express-advocacy election\nactivities that for-profit corporations and unions are themselves banned from conducting.”).\n\n                                                         18\n\ffederal candidates, campaigns, and parties—and found no problem.” Id. 17 In sum, EMILY’s List\n\napproved of some hybridization for non-connected political committees, but the D.C. Circuit has\n\nyet to endorse the expansion of allowable hybrid activity announced in Carey.\n\n         The second precept to glean from these cases is the genesis of so-called “Super PACs”—\n\npolitical committees that can raise unlimited money to engage in unlimited electioneering\n\ncommunications, so long as their activities are not made “in cooperation, consultation, or\n\nconcert, with, or at the request or suggestion of” a candidate, his or her authorized political\n\ncommittee, or a national, State, or local committee of a political party. 2 U.S.C. § 441a(7)(B).\n\nThese “Super PACs” are permitted to exist by virtue of two cases. The first is the Supreme\n\nCourt’s decision in Citzens United, which held that corporations could not be prevented from\n\nengaging in their own unlimited political speech funded from the corporation’s general treasury\n\nso long as that speech is in the form of independent expenditures. See Citizens United, 130 S. Ct.\n\nat 909. The second is the D.C. Circuit’s decision in SpeechNow, which held that individuals can\n\ncontribute unlimited amounts to a non-connected political committee, as long as the political\n\ncommittee is engaged solely in independent expenditures. See SpeechNow, 599 F.3d at 694 (“In\n\nlight of the [Supreme] Court’s holding as a matter of law that independent expenditures do not\n\ncorrupt or create the appearance of quid pro quo corruption, contributions to groups that make\n\nonly independent expenditures also cannot corrupt or create the appearance of corruption.”).\n\nEssentially, as long as a non-connected political committee engages only in independent\n\nexpenditures, it is now permitted to receive unlimited amounts of money from both individuals\n\nand corporations. See, e.g., FEC Advisory Op. 2010-11, 2010 WL 3184269, at *2 (July 22,\n\n\n17\n  This sentence in particular suggests that the Carey court felt constrained by the Circuit’s precedent in EMILY’s\nList to decide the case as it did. Additionally, “[t]he Carey court was constrained by the D.C. Circuit’s recent\ndecision in [SpeechNow], holding unconstitutional contribution limits to independent expenditure groups.”\nMcCutcheon v. FEC, No. 12-1034, 2012 WL 4466482, at *3 n.2 (D.D.C. Sept. 28, 2012) (three-judge panel).\n\n                                                         19\n\f2010) (“Following Citizens United and SpeechNow, corporations, labor organizations, and\n\npolitical committees may make unlimited independent expenditures from their own funds, and\n\nindividuals may pool unlimited funds in an independent expenditure-only political committee. It\n\nnecessarily follows that corporations, labor organizations and political committees also may\n\nmake unlimited contributions to organizations . . . that make only independent expenditures.”\n\n(footnote omitted)).\n\n       Importantly, in allowing unlimited money to flow into the electoral process for express\n\nadvocacy, both SpeechNow and Citizens United heavily emphasized the non-coordinated nature\n\nof independent expenditures, which serves as an essential counterweight to concerns about\n\ncorruption or the appearance of corruption. See Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 908 (“‘The\n\nabsence of prearrangement and coordination of an expenditure with the candidate or his\n\nagent . . . alleviates the danger that expenditures will be given as a quid pro quo for improper\n\ncommitments from the candidate.’” (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 47)); id. at 910 (“By\n\ndefinition, an independent expenditure is political speech presented to the electorate that is not\n\ncoordinated with a candidate.”); SpeechNow, 599 F.3d at 693 (“The independence of\n\nindependent expenditures was a central consideration in the Court’s decision [in Citizens\n\nUnited].”); id. (“[A] lack of coordination diminishes the possibility of corruption.”). Hence,\n\nthere can be little doubt that the independence of independent expenditures is the lynchpin that\n\nholds together the principle that no limits can be placed on contributions for such expenditures.\n\nIf express advocacy for particular federal candidates were to lose its independence (either in\n\nreality or appearance), it stands to reason that the doctrine carefully crafted in Citizens United\n\nand SpeechNow would begin to tumble back to Earth.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 20\n\f         The third and final precept, which loomed large behind the development of the first two\n\nprecepts, is that the government’s interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of\n\ncorruption endures as a compelling justification to restrict certain kinds of political speech. In\n\nparticular, courts continue to recognize that preventing corruption or the appearance of\n\ncorruption is sufficiently important to regulate entities that engage in direct contributions to\n\ncandidates and political parties, including “multicandidate political committees,” which are\n\npolitical committees that “ha[ve] made contributions to 5 or more candidates for Federal office.”\n\n2 U.S.C. § 441a(a)(4); see Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 908 (“The Buckley Court, nevertheless,\n\nsustained limits on direct contributions in order to ensure against the reality or appearance of\n\ncorruption.”); SpeechNow, 599 F.3d at 695 (“Limits on direct contributions to candidates, ‘unlike\n\nlimits on independent expenditures, have been an accepted means to prevent quid pro quo\n\ncorruption.’” (quoting Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 909)); EMILY’s List, 581 F.3d at 11 (“In\n\norder to prevent circumvention of limits on an individual donor’s contributions to candidates and\n\nparties, the [Supreme] Court has held that non-profit entities can be required to make their own\n\ncontributions to candidates and parties . . . out of a hard-money account that is subject to source\n\nand amount restrictions.”).\n\n         Specifically, Congress explicitly carved out “multicandidate political committees” to be\n\nentities that engage in direct contributions to candidates and political parties because such direct\n\ncontributions foment “the reality or appearance of corruption inherent in a system permitting\n\nunlimited financial contributions.” Buckley, 424 U.S. at 28; see also 2 U.S.C. § 441a(a)(2)\n\n(limiting contributions made by “multicandidate political committees”). 18 For this very reason,\n\n\n18\n  The Supreme Court was clear in its seminal campaign finance decision of the twentieth century (Buckley) that\n“[b]y contrast with a limitation upon expenditures for political expression, a limitation upon the amount that any one\nperson or group may contribute to a candidate or political committee entails only a marginal restriction upon the\ncontributor’s ability to engage in free communication.” Buckley, 424 U.S. at 20. This is because “[a] contribution\n\n                                                         21\n\fthe Supreme Court has long validated the government’s ability to restrict the amount of\n\ncontribution that may be given to multicandidate political committees. See Cal-Med, 453 U.S. at\n\n203 (Blackmun, J., concurring) (“Multicandidate political committees are therefore essentially\n\nconduits for contributions to candidates, and as such they pose a perceived threat of actual or\n\npotential corruption.”); see also Thalheimer v. City of San Diego, 645 F.3d 1109, 1120 (9th Cir.\n\n2011) (noting that “the direct donor relationship” of a multicandidate political committee\n\n“present[s] a risk of actual or apparent quid pro quo corruption” (citing Cal-Med, 453 U.S. at\n\n197)). The Supreme Court has also clearly recognized that “[o]f almost equal concern as the\n\ndanger of actual quid pro quo arrangements is the impact of the appearance of corruption\n\n\nserves as a general expression of support for the candidate and his views, but does not communicate the underlying\nbasis for the support,” and hence although “contributions may result in political expression if spent by a candidate or\nan association to present views to the voters, the transformation of contributions into political debate involves\nspeech by someone other than the contributor.” Id. at 21 (emphasis added).\n           In light of this distinction, any political contribution enjoys, ex ante, a lesser quantum of First Amendment\nprotection than any type of political expenditure. See id. at 23 (“[E]xpenditure ceilings impose significantly more\nsevere restrictions on protected freedoms of political expression and association than do . . . limitations on financial\ncontributions.”); see also McConnell, 540 U.S. at 152 n.48 (“Given FECA’s definition of ‘contribution,’ the $5,000\nand $25,000 limits restricted not only the source and amount of funds available to parties and political committees to\nmake candidate contributions, but also the source and amount of funds available to engage in express advocacy and\nnumerous other noncoordinated expenditures.”), overruled in part on other grounds by Citizens United, 558 U.S.\n310; Cal-Med, 453 U.S. at 196 (plurality opinion) (“[T]he ‘speech by proxy’ that [a non-profit] seeks to achieve\nthrough its contributions to [a PAC] is not the sort of political advocacy that this Court in Buckley found entitled to\nfull First Amendment protection.”); McCutcheon, 2012 WL 4466482, at *3 (“Every contribution limit may\n‘logically reduce[] the total amount that the recipient of the contributions otherwise could spend,’ but for now, ‘this\ntruism does not mean limits on contributions are simultaneously considered limits on expenditures that therefore\nreceive strict scrutiny.” (quoting Republican Nat’l Comm. v. FEC, 698 F. Supp. 2d 150, 156 (D.D.C. 2010)));\nRichard Wolf Hess, No Fair Play for Millionaires? McCain-Feingold’s Wealthy Candidate Restrictions and the\nFirst Amendment, 70 U. CHI. L. REV. 1067, 1077 (2003) (“The Buckley Court ratified contribution limits by\nrecognizing that although contribution limits do affect free speech rights, contributions are less deserving of\nprotection than other forms of political speech. The Buckley Court considered contributions as derivative, or\nconduit-type speech . . . .”). For this reason, the Buckley Court was ultimately untroubled by limits on political\ncontributions because the overall effect of contribution limits “is merely to require candidates and political\ncommittees to raise funds from a greater number of persons.” See Buckley, 424 U.S. at 21–22.\n         The Supreme Court, however, started to narrow Buckley’s critical distinction, without explanation, only\nfive years after the case was decided. See Citizens Against Rent Control v. City of Berkeley, 454 U.S. 290, 296–97\n(1981) (“Buckley identified a single narrow exception to the rule that limits on political activity were contrary to the\nFirst Amendment. The exception relates to the perception of undue influence of large contributors to a candidate.”).\nSpeechNow followed the Supreme Court down this path, saying that “the limits upheld in Buckley were limits on\ncontributions made directly to candidates.” SpeechNow, 599 F.3d at 695. Although this narrowing of Buckley is at\nodds with language from other Supreme Court precedents cited above (Cal-Med and McConnell), the D.C. Circuit’s\nnarrow interpretation of Buckley binds this Court.\n\n                                                          22\n\fstemming from public awareness of the opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large\n\nindividual financial contributions.” Buckley, 424 U.S. at 27.\n\n       This sets the stage for the constitutional question presently before the Court: Does the\n\ngovernment have a sufficiently compelling interest in limiting contributions to (and solicitations\n\nby) connected political committees that engage in both express advocacy communications and\n\ndirect candidate contributions? All that such a hybrid organization needs to do, according to\n\nCarey, is establish two separate bank accounts—one for direct contributions and one for\n\nindependent expenditures—and voilà: the appearance of corruption and undue influence\n\nmagically disappear. Yet, the allowances of such hybrid PACs transmogrify Congress’s intent in\n\ncompartmentalizing “multicandidate political committees” from other kinds of political\n\nassociations. When a PAC gives directly to candidates with its right hand and engages in\n\nexpress advocacy with its left hand, the risk that the PAC’s hybrid spending will appear\n\ncorrupting and corrosive is manifest. When the public sees a hybrid PAC hand a check to a\n\ncandidate or party leader while that PAC simultaneously spends unlimited amounts on highly\n\nvisible electioneering communications that directly advocate for that candidate’s election, the\n\nfaçade of “independence”—even if formally observed by using separate funds or accounts—\n\nappears non-existent to the public. Thus, the “belief that quid pro quo arrangements can be\n\nneatly demarcated from other improper influences does not accord with the theory or reality of\n\npolitics.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 961 (Stevens, J., dissenting); see also id. at 962 (“[A]\n\nlarge majority of Americans (80%) are of the view that corporations and other organizations that\n\nengage in electioneering communications, which benefit specific elected officials, receive special\n\nconsideration from those officials when matters arise that affect these corporations and\n\n\n\n\n                                                 23\n\forganizations.” (quoting McConnell v. FEC, 251 F. Supp. 2d 176, 623–24 (D.D.C. 2003),\n\noverruled in part by 540 U.S. 93)). 19\n\n         The instant case lies at the intersection of these three precepts, addressing whether a\n\nsingle connected PAC is permitted to engage in limited direct contributions funded from one\n\nbank account and simultaneously engage in unlimited express advocacy communications funded\n\nfrom another bank account. With these precedents in mind, the Court will now assess the\n\nprobability of success of the plaintiffs’ constitutional claims.\n\n                  2.       Contribution Limits\n\n         First, the plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of the contribution limits in 2 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 441a(a)(1)(C) and 441a(a)(3) as applied to SSFs that make both direct contributions and\n\nexpress advocacy communications. Those provisions prohibit making contributions to any\n\n“other political committee” (including SSFs) that exceed $5,000 in any calendar year and also\n\nprohibit making contributions that aggregate more than $57,500 biennially. 20 Plaintiffs Glengary\n\nLLC and Todd Cefaratti claim that they are both interested in making contributions to the\n\nLeadership Fund that exceed these limits and are prohibited from doing so by these restrictions.\n\nSee Compl. ¶¶ 25–26, 71. Those contribution limits for individuals, such as plaintiff Cefaratti,\n\nhave already been held unconstitutional as applied to non-connected political committees. See\n\nSpeechNow, 599 F.3d at 696.\n\n\n\n19\n  The Court of Appeals’ holding in SpeechNow, which struck down as unconstitutional limits on individuals’\ncontributions to independent expenditure-only groups, did not account for the newly minted approval of “hybrid”\nPACs in EMILY’s List. Indeed, SpeechNow never even cited to EMILY’s List. Although SpeechNow purported to\nlimit its holding to “contributions to independent expenditure-only organizations,” 599 F.3d at 696, the plaintiffs\ninvite the Court to conclude that the dual-account model supplied by EMILY’s List for hybrid PACs be read in\ntandem with SpeechNow to expand SpeechNow’s holding to any organization that engages in some amount of\nindependent expenditure activity. The Court declines the plaintiffs’ invitation.\n20\n  The $57,500 biennial cap applies to all contributions that are not made “to candidates and the authorized\ncommittees of candidates,” though of the $57,500 cap no more than $37,500 “may be attributable to contributions to\npolitical committees which are not political committees of national political parties.” 2 U.S.C. § 441a(a)(3)(B).\n\n                                                         24\n\f         The plaintiffs contend that the broad-based discussion of contribution limits in\n\nSpeechNow and EMILY’s List dictate a result in the plaintiffs’ favor. Those cases are\n\ndistinguishable, however, and therefore do not control the outcome of the instant case. First,\n\nalthough EMILY’s List was a facial challenge, the regulations challenged in that case only dealt\n\nwith solicitation and allocation restrictions, not contribution limits. EMILY’s List, 581 F.3d at\n\n15–18 (outlining provisions of challenged regulations). Hence, to the extent the Court’s analysis\n\ntouched upon contribution limits, it was pure dicta. Second and perhaps more importantly,\n\nalthough the non-profit plaintiff in EMILY’s List engaged in “expenditures,” none of the\n\nexpenditures at issue involved express advocacy for or against a clearly identified federal\n\ncandidate. Rather, the expenditures involved in EMILY’s List were either issue-based advocacy\n\nor voter turnout and registration activities. See id. at 12 (noting that EMILY’s List “makes\n\nexpenditures for advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter registration drives”);\n\nEMILY’s List v. FEC, 569 F. Supp. 2d 18, 33 (D.D.C. 2008) (noting that advertisements at issue\n\nwere “five advertisements supporting two ballot initiatives in Missouri that . . . do not contain\n\nany references to clearly identified federal candidates”), reversed by 481 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2009). 21\n\n         Thus, EMILY’s List did not address contribution limits, and in particular it did not address\n\nthe potential anti-corruption interests implicated by contribution limits on hybrid PACs that\n\nengage in both direct contributions and express advocacy—a critical distinction from the facts of\n21\n  The Circuit panel in EMILY’s List was also very careful to emphasize repeatedly that its “constitutional analysis\nof non-profits applie[d] only to non-connected non-profits.” EMILY’s List, 581 F.3d at 22 n.21 (emphasis in\noriginal); see also id. at 8 (“[T]his case concerns the FEC’s regulation of non-profit entities that are not connected to\na candidate, party, or for-profit corporation.”); id. at 16 n.15 (“Our constitutional analysis of donations and spending\nlimits applies both to non-connected non-profits registered as political committees with the FEC and to non-\nconnected non-profits that are not so registered.”). The Circuit did not explicitly state why non-connectedness was\nimportant to its analysis, though the repeated emphasis on non-connectedness implies that it was in fact important.\nNevertheless, this Court will not venture to speculate as to the doctrinal importance of the non-connected nature of\nthe non-profit at issue in EMILY’s List, other than to observe that the entity at issue in the instant case (the\nLeadership Fund) is, by contrast, a connected political committee.\n\n                                                           25\n\fthe instant case. The distinction is critical primarily because express advocacy has an inherently\n\nstronger nexus to particular candidates, which materially alters the constitutional analysis of\n\nhybrid political committees. See FEC v. Mass. Citizens for Life, Inc. (“MCFL”), 479 U.S. 238,\n\n249 (1986) (“Buckley adopted the ‘express advocacy’ requirement to distinguish discussion of\n\nissues and candidates from more pointed exhortations to vote for particular persons.”); Wis.\n\nRight to Life, Inc. v. FEC, 466 F. Supp. 2d 195, 209 (D.D.C. 2006) (“The common denominator\n\nbetween express advocacy and its functional equivalent, as the Supreme Court defined it in\n\nMcConnell, is the link between the words and images used in the ad and the fitness, or lack\n\nthereof, of the candidate for public office. . . . [I]t is the absence of that link which obviates the\n\nlikelihood of political corruption and public cynicism in government where the ad, on its face, is\n\ndevoid of any language the purpose of which is advocacy either for or against a particular\n\ncandidate for federal office.”). Additionally, EMILY’s List did not consider the propriety of\n\n“hybrid” PACs in a post-Citizens United world of unlimited corporate funding—a factor that\n\ndoes, and should, likewise modify the anti-corruption calculus. 22\n\n         Similarly, SpeechNow is distinguishable from the instant case because it involved limits\n\non contributions by individuals to unincorporated non-profit associations that only engage in\n\nindependent expenditures. See SpeechNow, 599 F.3d at 689 (“[W]e hold that the contribution\n\nlimits of 2 U.S.C. § 441a(a)(1)(C) and 441a(a)(3) are unconstitutional as applied to individuals’\n\ncontributions to SpeechNow.”); see also id. at 696 (“[W]e only decide these questions as applied\n\nto contributions to SpeechNow, an independent expenditure-only group.”). Clearly, SpeechNow\n\ndoes not control the instant case because this case deals with a “hybrid” PAC that seeks to\n\n\n22\n  This is notwithstanding the partially concurring opinion in EMILY’s List, which observed that the results of the\nmajority’s decision “are in tension—perhaps irreconcilable tension—with McConnell.” EMILY’s List, 581 F.3d at\n39 (Brown, J., concurring); see also id. at 37 (“This novel argument [that hybrid political committees may exist] is\nnot without considerable charm, but one must read Cal-Med with a squint to see that holding.”).\n\n                                                         26\n\fengage in both independent expenditures and direct candidate contributions. 23 See Compl. ¶ 23\n\n(noting that the Leadership Fund “wants to make contributions to federal candidates” and “is also\n\ninterested in making independent expenditures”). Indeed, SpeechNow observed that “[t]he\n\nindependence of independent expenditures was a central consideration in the [Supreme] Court’s\n\ndecision [in Citizens United],” 599 F.3d at 693, though as the Court’s preceding analysis makes\n\nclear, the “independence” of hybrid PAC expenditures is suspect.\n\n        “The Supreme Court has recognized only one interest sufficiently important to outweigh\n\nthe First Amendment interests implicated by contributions for political speech: preventing\n\ncorruption or the appearance of corruption.” Id. at 692; see also Colo. Republican Fed.\n\nCampaign Comm. v. FEC, 518 U.S. 604, 615 (1996) (“[R]easonable contribution limits directly\n\nand materially advance the Government’s interest in preventing exchanges of large financial\n\ncontributions for political favors.”). As the Court in Buckley and the plurality in Cal-Med\n\narticulated, the government’s interest in “deal[ing] with the reality or appearance of corruption\n\ninherent in a system permitting unlimited financial contributions,” is directly implicated when\n\ncontributions are made to groups that in turn make direct contributions to candidates or political\n\nparties. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 28; see also Cal-Med, 453 U.S. at 194 (plurality opinion)\n\n(“[Contribution] limitations serve[] the important governmental interests in preventing the\n\ncorruption or appearance of corruption of the political process that might result if such\n\ncontributions were not restrained.”). This anti-corruption interest continues to justify the $5,000\n\nannual cap on hybrid PACs like the Leadership Fund that desire to make both independent\n\nelectioneering expenditures, including express advocacy communications, and direct\n\n\n\n\n23\n  It also appears that the plaintiffs in SpeechNow and EMILY’s List were not established, administered, or\nsubsidized by a corporation and thus were “non-connected,” unlike the Leadership Fund in the instant action.\n\n                                                        27\n\fcontributions to federal parties and candidates. The Supreme Court observed as much in Cal-\n\nMed when the plurality held:\n\n       If the First Amendment rights of a contributor are not infringed by limitations on\n       the amount he may contribute to a campaign organization which advocates the\n       views and candidacy of a particular candidate, the rights of a contributor are\n       similarly not impaired by limits on the amount he may give to a multicandidate\n       political committee . . . which advocates the views and candidacies of a number of\n       candidates.\n\nCal-Med, 453 U.S. at 183–84 (plurality opinion) (citation omitted).\n\n       As discussed above, the government’s interest in preventing the appearance of political\n\ncorruption and undue influence is at its zenith when individuals and organizations give money\n\ndirectly to political candidates and political parties. As the Supreme Court prophetically stated\n\nover thirty-five years ago:\n\n       Under a system of private financing of elections, a candidate lacking immense\n       personal or family wealth must depend on financial contributions from others to\n       provide the resources necessary to conduct a successful campaign. The increasing\n       importance of the communications media and sophisticated mass-mailing and\n       polling operations to effective campaigning make the raising of large sums of\n       money an ever more essential ingredient of an effective candidacy. To the extent\n       that large contributions are given to secure a political quid pro quo from current\n       and potential office holders, the integrity of our system of representative\n       democracy is undermined.\n\nBuckley, 424 U.S. at 26–27. This has been the justification for contribution limits to\n\nmulticandidate political committees for decades. See, e.g., Cal-Med, 153 U.S. at 197–98\n\n(plurality opinion) (holding that limits on contributions to multicandidate political committees\n\n“further the governmental interest in preventing the actual or apparent corruption of the political\n\nprocess”).\n\n       When a single entity is allowed to make both limited direct contributions and unlimited\n\nindependent expenditures, keeping the bank accounts for those two purposes separate is simply\n\ninsufficient to overcome the appearance that the entity is in cahoots with the candidates and\n\n\n                                                28\n\fparties that it coordinates with and supports. Although such an entity may maintain separate\n\nbank accounts, it need not maintain separate management or hold itself out to the public as\n\nengaging in two distinct activities. Thus from the perspective of any citizen who does not\n\nscrutinize the entity’s bank statements, all of the entity’s spending (direct contributions and\n\nexpress advocacy communications) is coming from the same place. See N.C. Right to Life, Inc.\n\nv. Leake, 525 F.3d 274, 336 (4th Cir. 2008) (Michael, J., dissenting) (“It is hard to understand\n\nhow [an independent expenditure-only PAC] could, whether intentionally or not, avoid\n\nincorporating the coordinated campaign strategies used by [its affiliated direct contribution-only\n\nPAC] into its own ostensibly independent campaign work. Similarly, it is hard to understand\n\nhow a donor, approached by the same fundraiser on behalf of both [PACs], could not believe that\n\nhis or her contributions to each would be linked.”); see also Vt. Right to Life Comm., Inc. v.\n\nSorrell, No. 2:09-CV-188, 2012 WL 2370445, at *28 (D. Vt. June 21, 2012) (noting that “the\n\nstructural melding” between an independent expenditure-only PAC and a direct contribution\n\nPAC “leaves no significant functional divide between them for purposes of campaign finance\n\nlaw,” and their “nearly complete organizational identity poses serious questions”). To conclude\n\nthat a “hybrid” PAC’s direct contributions to (and attendant coordination with) candidates and\n\nparties do not infect, or appear to infect, all of its operations in the political arena is naïve and\n\nsimply out of touch with the American public’s clear disillusionment with the massive amounts\n\nof private money that have dominated the political system, particularly since Citizens United. 24\n\n\n\n24\n  See Brennan Ctr. for Justice, National Survey: Super PACs, Corruption, and Democracy 2–3 (2012) (reporting\nthat 73% of respondents in national poll agreed that “there would be less corruption if there were limits on how\nmuch could be given to Super PACs,” 77% “agreed that members of Congress are more likely to act in the interest\nof a group that spent millions to elect them than to act in the public interest,” and 65% said that “they trust\ngovernment less because big donors to Super PACs have more influence than regular voters”); see also Morgan\nLittle, Poll: Americans Largely in Favor of Campaign Spending Limitations, L.A. TIMES (Sept. 16, 2012) (reporting\nthat recent national poll conducted by the Associated Press and the National Constitution Center found that 83% of\nAmericans “believe there should be at least some limits on the amount of money corporations, unions and other\n\n                                                       29\n\fSee Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 964 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (“A democracy cannot function\n\neffectively when its constituent members believe laws are being bought and sold.”). Although\n\n“[a] non-profit that makes expenditures to support federal candidates does not suddenly forfeit its\n\nFirst Amendment rights when it decides also to make direct contributions to parties or\n\ncandidates,” EMILY’s List, 581 F.3d at 12, such a hybrid PAC also does not lose its status as a\n\nmulticandidate political committee merely by making independent expenditures.\n\n         This is, of course, not to say that an organization like the Leadership Fund forfeits its\n\nFirst Amendment rights simply by virtue of wanting to make both direct contributions and\n\nindependent electioneering expenditures. Those rights remain unscathed. Further, the burden on\n\nthe plaintiffs to comply with the current contribution limits is minimal. If banding together to\n\nengage in unlimited political speech is their goal, the plaintiffs could easily form an independent\n\nexpenditure-only PAC (i.e., a Super PAC) and receive contributions in unlimited amounts.\n\nCompare SpeechNow, 599 F.3d at 697 (“[P]laintiffs argue that the additional burden that would\n\nbe imposed on SpeechNow if it were required to comply with the organizational and reporting\n\nrequirements applicable to political committees is too much for the First Amendment to bear.\n\nWe disagree.”), with Pls.’ Reply Mem. in Supp. Mot. Prelim. Inj. (“Pls.’ Reply”) at 11, ECF No.\n\n7 (“The FEC cannot require [the Leadership Fund] to clone itself to make independent\n\nexpenditures.”). Therefore, the contribution limits at 2 U.S.C. §§ 441a(a)(1)(C) and 441a(a)(3)\n\nare constitutional as applied to the Leadership Fund, insofar as the Leadership Fund operates as a\n\nsingle entity that makes both direct contributions and express advocacy communications. 25\n\n\n\norganizations are permitted to contribute to groups seeking to influence the outcome of presidential and\ncongressional races”).\n25\n  As discussed above, this holding does not prevent the Leadership Fund or any of the other plaintiffs from\nengaging in unlimited independent expenditures. It merely imposes a narrow limit on the mechanism through which\nthey may do so. For example, STI could establish a second connected PAC that engaged in only independent\n\n                                                         30\n\f                  3.       Solicitation Restrictions\n\n         Next, the plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of the FECA’s restrictions on the group\n\nof people from whom an SSF may solicit contributions. Section 441b(b)(4)(A)(i) of the FECA\n\nmakes it unlawful “for a corporation, or a separate segregated fund established by a corporation,\n\nto solicit contributions to such a fund from any person other than its stockholders and their\n\nfamilies and its executive or administrative personnel.” SSFs may also solicit the rank-and-file\n\nemployees of their connected corporations as long as the solicitations are: (1) made in writing;\n\n(2) addressed to the employees at their residence; (3) made only twice per calendar year; and\n\n(4) designed such that the SSF and its connected corporation “cannot determine who makes a\n\ncontribution of $50 or less as a result of such solicitation and who does not make such a\n\ncontribution.” Id. § 441b(b)(4)(B). The plaintiffs state, however, that they do not challenge the\n\nvalidity of these latter restrictions, which regulate the manner in which rank-and-file employees\n\nmay be solicited. See Pls.’ Mem. in Supp. Mot. Prelim. Inj. (“Pls.’ Mem.”) at 3, ECF No. 4-1\n\n(“Plaintiffs do not challenge . . . the prohibition on soliciting employees of the SSF not in the\n\nrestricted class more than twice annually subject to certain restrictions.” (citing 2 U.S.C.\n\n§ 441b(b)(4)(B))). Rather, the plaintiffs seek to expand the scope of people who may be\n\nsolicited beyond the limited group of individuals associated with the host corporation through an\n\nownership or employment interest. In essence, however, the direct solicitation restrictions for\n\nrank-and-file employees would be swallowed if the relief sought by the plaintiffs were granted\n\n(and STI and the Leadership Fund were permitted to solicit from the general public) because the\n\ngeneral public necessarily would include rank-and-file employees.\n\n\n\n\nexpenditures. Also, any or all of the plaintiffs could establish a non-connected political committee that engages in\nonly independent expenditures.\n\n                                                         31\n\f       Soliciting money for political spending is distinct from either making political\n\ncontributions or making independent political expenditures, though all three activities enjoy First\n\nAmendment protection. The Supreme Court has held that “[s]oliciting financial support is\n\nundoubtedly subject to reasonable regulation,” so long as that regulation is “undertaken with due\n\nregard for the reality that solicitation is characteristically intertwined with informative and\n\nperhaps persuasive speech.” Vill. of Schaumberg v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 444 U.S. 620,\n\n632 (1980); see also Friends of the Vietnam Veterans Mem’l v. Kennedy, 116 F.3d 495, 497\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1997) (“The cases protecting the right to solicit contributions in a public forum do so\n\nnot because the First Amendment contemplates the right to raise money, but rather because the\n\nact of solicitation contains a communicative element.” (citing Village of Schaumberg, 444 U.S.\n\nat 632)) Therefore, the plaintiffs go too far in arguing that, “After Citizens United and related\n\ncases all associations have a fundamental right to associate by soliciting contributions to fund\n\nindependent expenditures.” Pls.’ Reply at 14.\n\n       It is not completely clear what level of scrutiny applies when examining the\n\nconstitutional validity of restrictions on solicitation activities. A number of courts have held that,\n\nso long as the solicitation restrictions are content neutral, they need not withstand strict scrutiny.\n\nSee, e.g., McConnell, 540 U.S. at 138–39 (applying less than strict scrutiny to solicitation\n\nrestriction because it “in no way alter[ed] or impair[ed] the political message ‘intertwined’ with\n\nthe solicitation”); EMILY’s List, 581 F.3d at 35 (Brown, J., concurring) (“After McConnell, . . .\n\nsolicitation rules are subject only to this lesser scrutiny.”); Blount v. SEC, 61 F.3d 938, 941–42\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1995) (“The intensity with which we scrutinize [a solicitation restriction] depends on\n\nwhether the rule is content-based, eliciting ‘strict’ scrutiny, or content-neutral, eliciting only\n\n‘intermediate’ scrutiny.”). In the instant case, the solicitation restrictions appear to be content\n\n\n\n                                                  32\n\fneutral because they are “justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech,” see\n\nVa. State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Va. Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U.S. 748, 771 (1976), but\n\nthe Court need not decide this question because, as the subsequent discussion reveals, the\n\nsolicitation restrictions challenged by the plaintiffs would survive even strict scrutiny.\n\n        Although the Court is mindful that solicitation activities are “characteristically\n\nintertwined with informative and perhaps persuasive speech,” Village of Schaumberg, 444 U.S.\n\nat 632, the plaintiffs have altogether failed to allege or describe how their proposed solicitation\n\nactivities would include a “communicative element.” 26 See Kennedy, 116 F.3d at 497. The\n\nplaintiffs have discussed their proposed solicitation activities solely in terms of how those\n\nsolicitations will allow them to raise particular amounts of money, see, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 27, 40–\n\n41, 43; Pls.’ Mem. at 6 (“[The Leadership Fund] wants to solicit Mr. Ehlinger to make a $1,500\n\ncontribution to a[n] [independent expenditure-only] account . . . .”); id. at 10 (“[The Leadership\n\nFund] would like to solicit contributions for its independent expenditures in amounts greater than\n\n$5,000.00 per calendar year.”), but the act of soliciting money in certain amounts, by itself, does\n\nnot warrant strong First Amendment protection—even if it is for the purpose of later engaging in\n\nprotected speech. See Kennedy, 116 F.3d at 497 (observing that the First Amendment does not\n\ncontemplate “the right to raise money”). Nevertheless, the Court is wary of labeling the\n\nplaintiffs’ proposed solicitations as pure commercial speech, particularly because this Circuit has\n\nrecognized that the solicitation of campaign funds “is close to the core of protected speech.”\n\nBlount, 61 F.3d at 941 (citing Village of Schaumberg, 444 U.S. at 632). A restriction on\n\nsolicitation activity thus generally “cannot be sustained unless it serves a sufficiently strong,\n\n\n26\n  The FEC has stated that one of its concerns is that the Leadership Fund will solicit the general public through\nexpressive or persuasive conduct, but the plaintiffs do not address this possibility in their Complaint or their\nbriefing. See Def.’s Opp’n at 16 (noting “the damage that would result from STI’s proposal to pay for undisclosed\nsolicitations of the general public—communications that can themselves support or oppose federal candidates”).\n\n                                                        33\n\fsubordinating interest that the [government] is entitled to protect.” Village of Schaumberg, 444\n\nU.S. at 636; see also id. at 637 (noting that restriction on solicitation activities “may serve [the\n\ngovernment’s] legitimate interests, but it must do so by narrowly drawn regulations designed to\n\nserve those interests without unnecessarily interfering with First Amendment freedoms”). 27\n\n         The Supreme Court established long ago, however, that the federal government has a\n\nnumber of “sufficiently strong” interests in limiting the solicitation activities of SSFs. See\n\nNRWC, 459 U.S. at 206–10. The plaintiffs are incorrect in arguing that the Supreme Court’s\n\ndecision in NRWC, upholding the FECA’s solicitation restrictions, was only “based upon an anti-\n\ndistortion rationale thoroughly rejected by the Supreme Court in Citizens United.” Pls.’ Reply.\n\nat 14 n.12. NRWC discussed the constitutionality of the very same solicitation restrictions that\n\nthat plaintiffs challenge in the instant action. The plaintiff in NRWC challenged the solicitation\n\nrestrictions in 2 U.S.C. § 441b(b)(4)(A), arguing (as the plaintiffs do here) that they restricted the\n\nability of the corporation’s SSF to associate with people who shared its political beliefs. See\n\nNRWC, 459 U.S. at 206–07; see also Pls.’ Reply at 14 (arguing for “fundamental right to\n\nassociate by soliciting contributions”). The Court rejected this challenge on several grounds.\n\nFirst, the Court pointed to an anti-distortion rationale, i.e., ensuring that “substantial aggregations\n\nof wealth amassed by the special advantages which go with the corporate form of organization\n\nshould not be converted into political ‘war chests,’” as well as a shareholder protection rationale,\n\n\n27\n  The plaintiffs seem to believe that the right to engage in unrestricted solicitation of funds follows ineluctably from\nthe holding in Citizens United because, in the plaintiffs’ view, every campaign finance regulation that has any nexus\nto independent expenditures is also unconstitutional. See, e.g., Pls.’ Reply at 14. Yet, this is clearly not so. For\nexample, courts have consistently upheld the FECA’s organizational, reporting, and disclosure requirements—\nrequirements that continue to apply to independent expenditure-only organizations, despite the fact that compliance\nwith such requirements imposes costs that necessarily divert organizational resources away from independent\nexpenditure activity. See Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 916 ([D]isclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react\nto the speech of corporate entities in a proper way. This transparency enables the electorate to make informed\ndecisions and give proper weight to different speakers and messages.”); SpeechNow, 599 F.3d at 697 (rejecting\nplaintiffs’ argument that organizational and reporting requirements on political committees are violative of the First\nAmendment).\n\n                                                          34\n\fi.e., “to protect the individuals who have paid money into a corporation or union for purposes\n\nother than the support of candidates from having that money used to support political candidates\n\nto whom they may be opposed,” and found that both were “sufficient to justify the [solicitation\n\nrestrictions] at issue.” NRWC, 459 U.S. at 207–08. Significantly, the Court then went on to\n\ndiscuss a third key rationale that supported the solicitation restrictions: “the importance of\n\npreventing both the actual corruption threatened by large financial contributions and the eroding\n\nof public confidence in the electoral process through the appearance of corruption.” Id. at 208.\n\nThe Court stated that “[i]n order to prevent both actual and apparent corruption, Congress aimed\n\na part of its regulatory scheme at corporations” and that “[w]hile § 441b restricts the solicitation\n\nof corporations and labor unions without great financial resources, as well as those more\n\nfortunately situated, we accept Congress’s judgment that it is the potential for such [corrupting]\n\ninfluence that demands regulation.” Id. at 209–10. Therefore, contrary to the plaintiffs’\n\nassertion, the Supreme Court in NRWC also relied upon the well-established and compelling\n\nanti-corruption rationale in upholding § 441b’s solicitation restrictions. Nothing in Citizens\n\nUnited or any other Supreme Court case has displaced the holding in NRWC, and this Court is\n\nbound to follow it here.\n\n       Yet another important consideration implicated by the solicitation restrictions challenged\n\nin this case is the government’s interest in protecting the First Amendment rights of a\n\ncorporation’s employees. This concern was not addressed by the majority in Citizens United or\n\nthe Court of Appeals in EMILY’s List and SpeechNow, but it is vitally important to the health of\n\nAmerican democracy. See NRWC, 459 U.S. at 206 (observing that FECA’s restrictions on SSF\n\nsolicitations were intended to prevent such solicitations from “coerc[ing] members of the\n\ncorporation holding minority political views”). As Justice Stevens noted in his piercing dissent,\n\n\n\n                                                 35\n\f“[t]he majority seems oblivious to the simple truth that laws such as [the FECA] do not merely\n\npit the anticorruption interest against the First Amendment, but also pit competing First\n\nAmendment values against each other.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 976 (Stevens, J.,\n\ndissenting). “The Court’s blinkered and aphoristic approach to the First Amendment may well\n\npromote corporate power at the cost of the individual and collective self-expression the\n\nAmendment was meant to serve.” Id. at 977.\n\n       Providing corporations with an unlimited political voice may bring more and louder\n\nvoices to the national political dialogue as the Citizens United majority repeatedly emphasized\n\nand lauded, but allowing unlimited amplification of corporate political speech will also\n\ninevitably chill the political speech of corporate employees whose views diverge from their\n\ncorporate employers. The plaintiffs assure the Court that they will abide by the FECA’s other\n\napplicable solicitation restrictions, such as the restriction on only soliciting rank-and-file\n\nemployees twice per year under certain restrictions, “the requirement to ‘inform each employee it\n\nsolicits of the political purposes of [the SSF]’ and ‘of his right to refuse to contribute without any\n\nreprisal.’” Pls.’ Reply at 6, 16 (quoting Def.’s Opp’n at 23). Yet, as one commentator has noted,\n\n“the inherent potential for coercion in employer-employee relationships . . . cannot simply be\n\nundone by prohibiting explicit or implicit threats or discrimination.” Paul M. Secunda,\n\nAddressing Political Captive Audience Workplace Meetings in the Post-Citizens United\n\nEnvironment, 120 YALE L.J. ONLINE 17, 24 (2010). Rather, “it is in the best interest of all\n\ninvolved to keep political discussions and partisanship out of the public and private workplace.”\n\nId. The relief sought by the plaintiffs would do just the opposite. As noted above, allowing STI\n\nand the Leadership Fund to solicit funds from the general public would essentially do away with\n\nthe FECA’s strict limitations on how corporate employees may be solicited because all corporate\n\n\n\n                                                  36\n\femployees are also members of the general public. The danger that rank-and-file employees\n\nwould be exposed to repeated public solicitations from their employer’s PAC 28—via direct mail,\n\nradio, television, or other public media of the corporation’s choice—and would thereby feel\n\ncoerced to contribute or adopt a particular political viewpoint at work, represents an\n\nunacceptable risk of infringing those employees’ First Amendment rights. Preventing such an\n\noutcome would essentially require rewriting the statute to account for the existence of general-\n\npublic solicitation, which is a task for the Congress, not this Court.\n\n         The solicitation restrictions in § 441b are also narrowly drawn to serve the foregoing\n\ngovernmental interests because the restrictions are tailored to match the special benefit that\n\nCongress extended to SSFs—exempting all funds used for “the establishment, administration,\n\nand solicitation of contributions to a [SSF]” from the definition of “contributions.” See 2 U.S.C.\n\n§ 441b(b)(2)(C). This exemption, as discussed above, evidences a delicate statutory balancing of\n\nburden and benefit: An SSF’s solicitation speech may be subsidized by its connected\n\ncorporation, so long as those solicitations are limited to corporate insiders and employees. See\n\nid. § 441b(b). The statutory exemption allows connected PACs to avoid the disclosure and\n\nreporting requirements that would otherwise apply to contributions that fund political\n\nsolicitations. Consequently, donations to the general treasury of the non-profit corporation in\n\nany amount from any source may be funneled, without disclosing or reporting the amount or the\n\nsource, to the connected PAC for use in solicitations. 29 Removing the statute’s restrictions on\n\n\n\n28\n  Corporate employees would be well aware that they are being solicited by their employer’s PAC because each\nSSF is required to “include the name of its connected organization” in its name. 2 U.S.C. § 432(e)(5).\n29\n  This is yet another distinction between the instant case and EMILY’s List. The plaintiff in EMILY’s List, unlike\nthe plaintiff STI in the instant action, was registered as a political committee and thus was required to disclose the\namount and source of any “contributions,” i.e., any monies given to the organization “for the purpose of influencing\nany election for Federal office.” See 2 U.S.C. § 431(8)(A); EMILY’s List, 581 F.3d at 16 n.15. STI is a 501(c)(4)\nnon-profit that need not disclose the source or amount of any contributions to its general treasury.\n\n                                                         37\n\fthe breadth of such solicitations would allow the disclosure and reporting exception to swallow\n\nthe rule.\n\n        SSFs are creatures of statute—they were crafted by Congress to enjoy certain benefits\n\nthat other, non-connected PACs cannot enjoy, and it is therefore eminently reasonable and\n\nimportant for connected PACs to abide by Congress’s countervailing restriction on the universe\n\nof people to whom SSFs’ solicitations may be directed. See Cal-Med, 453 U.S. at 201 (“[T]he\n\nsegregated funds that unions and corporations may establish pursuant to § 441b(b)(2)(C) are\n\ncarefully limited in [the manner and scope of their solicitations].”). The solicitation restrictions\n\ndo not limit the content or frequency of the plaintiffs’ solicitation messages, and therefore it\n\nwould be inappropriate to upset the careful legislative balance struck in § 441b(b). The FEC’s\n\n“reasonable regulation” upon the solicitation of financial support to SSFs is therefore permissible\n\nbecause it exercises “due regard for the reality that solicitation is characteristically intertwined\n\nwith informative and perhaps persuasive speech.” See Village of Schaumberg, 444 U.S. at 632.\n\n                                                 ***\n\n        In sum, the plaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their\n\nclaims. Although the Court will continue to discuss the other three preliminary injunction\n\nfactors in assessing the plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction, the foregoing conclusion\n\nabout the merits of the plaintiffs’ claims is sufficient to grant the FEC’s Motion to Dismiss. As a\n\nresult, the Leadership Fund may establish two separate bank accounts that may be used for direct\n\ncontributions and independent expenditures (including express advocacy). Insofar as the\n\nLeadership Fund chooses to remain as a single entity that engages in both direct candidate\n\ncontributions and express advocacy communications, however, the Leadership Fund may not\n\nsolicit contributions beyond the limits on such solicitations contained in 2 U.S.C. § 441b(b)(4),\n\n\n\n                                                  38\n\fand the Leadership Fund also may not accept any contributions in excess of the limits contained\n\nin 2 U.S.C. §§ 441a(a)(1)(C) and 441a(a)(3).\n\n       B.      Irreparable Harm\n\n       The plaintiffs claim that they will suffer irreparable harm if the Leadership Fund is not\n\nallowed immediately to “solicit and accept unlimited contributions in order to conduct\n\nindependent expenditures.” Pls.’ Mem. at 33. This claim, however, is highly dubious in light of\n\nthe numerous alternative ways that the plaintiffs could engage in unlimited political speech.\n\nMost notably, the plaintiffs could form a Super PAC that paid its own administrative and\n\nsolicitation costs and could therefore solicit unlimited contributions from the general public to\n\nfinance unlimited independent expenditures. The plaintiffs respond to this option by arguing that\n\noperating a Super PAC would be burdensome. See Pls.’ Reply at 11–12 (citing MCFL, 479 U.S.\n\nat 254–55). The plaintiffs argue that the “additional requirements” of administering a Super\n\nPAC “‘may create a disincentive for [plaintiffs] to engage in political speech.’” Id. at 12\n\n(alteration in original) (quoting MCFL, 479 U.S. at 254). Yet, the plaintiffs do not say why the\n\norganizational, reporting, and record-keeping requirements of administering a Super PAC would\n\nbe any more burdensome than the (identical) organizational, reporting, and record-keeping\n\nrequirements of administering an SSF. It appears that what the Leadership Fund would really\n\nlike is to have its cake and eat it too—enjoy the benefits of an SSF (corporate subsidization of\n\nadministration and solicitation expenses) while also enjoying the benefits of a Super PAC\n\n(unlimited fundraising abilities). Choices have consequences, and requiring the plaintiffs to live\n\nwith the limitations of the entity they chose to establish (an SSF) entails no more of an injury\n\nthan requiring a “social welfare” organization to begin paying taxes if it chooses to operate its\n\nbusiness for profit. See 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(4).\n\n\n\n                                                  39\n\f       C.      Balance of Equities and Public Interest\n\n       For many of the same reasons already discussed, the balance of equities tips in favor of\n\nthe FEC rather than the plaintiffs. Granting the plaintiffs the relief they request would force the\n\nFEC to ignore the congressionally mandated limits on the fundraising activities of SSFs without\n\na sound constitutional basis for doing so. Also, though the plaintiffs may not be capable of\n\nraising the amount of funds they would be capable of raising as a Super PAC, that wound is self-\n\ninflicted. Furthermore, the plaintiffs do not seek a preservation of the status quo, but rather they\n\nseek fundamental change in how SSFs are regulated by the FEC, which would undoubtedly\n\nrequire new agency guidance and other burdens that are at least equal, if not far greater, than any\n\nburdens that would result from establishing a separate Super PAC to engage in the unlimited\n\nfundraising the plaintiffs desire. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, “‘[t]he presumption of\n\nconstitutionality which attaches to every Act of Congress is . . . an equity to be considered in\n\nfavor of [the government] in balancing hardships.’” Bowen v. Kendrick, 483 U.S. 1304, 1304\n\n(1987) (Rehnquist, C.J., in chambers) (quoting Walters v. Nat’l Ass’n of Radiation Survivors,\n\n468 U.S. 1323, 1324 (1984)). That equity is in full effect here.\n\n       The public interest would also not be served by granting the injunctive relief requested by\n\nthe plaintiffs. As discussed above, the provisions challenged by the plaintiffs serve important\n\ngovernmental interests intended to protect the integrity of the electoral process. Therefore,\n\nenjoining the enforcement of those provisions would palpably disserve the public interest, absent\n\na strong countervailing First Amendment reason for doing so.\n\nIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n       In sum, the plaintiffs have failed to satisfy any of the four preliminary injunction factors\n\nin connection with their First Amendment claims, and thus they have failed to state a plausible\n\n\n\n                                                 40\n\fclaim for relief. Therefore, for the reasons discussed above, the plaintiffs’ Motion for\n\nPreliminary Injunction, ECF No. 4, is DENIED. For the same reasons, the FEC’s Motion to\n\nDismiss, ECF No. 8, is GRANTED.\n\n       An appropriate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n\n\n\n       Date: November 5, 2012\n\n                                                      /s/ Beryl A.

Employee Leadership Fund (“the Leadership Fund”),\n\nStop This Insanity, Inc.

See 2 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 431(4)(B), 433. 5 Likewise, all political committees, including SSFs, are required to abide by\n\ncertain organizational, record-keeping, and reporting requirements, see 2 U.S.C. §§ 432, 433,\n\n434, as well as contribution limits, see id. § 441a. Under the contribution limits, no person is\n\nallowed to make “contributions” to any “other political committee” (which includes SSFs) “in\n\nany calendar year which, in the aggregate, exceed $5,000.” Id. § 441a(a)(1)(C). Additionally,\n\nSSFs are uniquely required to observe certain limits upon the universe of people from whom\n\nthey solicit contributions. Specifically, subject to certain limited exceptions, it is unlawful “for a\n\ncorporation, or a separate segregated fund established by a corporation, to solicit contributions to\n\nsuch a fund from any person other than its stockholders and their families and its executive or\n\nadministrative personnel and their families.” Id. § 441b(b)(4)(A)(i). 6 The Leadership Fund\n\nasserts that these restrictions on the solicitations and contributions of connected PACs are\n\nunconstitutional as applied to it, in light of recent developments in the law of campaign finance\n\nand the First Amendment.\n\n        Currently, the Leadership Fund maintains a single bank account into which it receives\n\n“hard money” 7 contributions that are subject to the contribution limits, solicitation restrictions,\n\nand reporting and disclosure requirements of the FECA.

Since independent expenditures currently enjoy\n\nfewer restrictions than direct contributions to candidates, the Leadership Fund would like to\n\nestablish a second, separate bank account, for which it would like to solicit unlimited\n\ncontributions from the general public in order to finance its “independent expenditures.” Compl.\n\nEx.

Absent binding authority or clear\n\nguidance from the Court of Appeals, however, the Court finds that the most prudent course is to\n\nbypass this unresolved issue and proceed to explain why a preliminary injunction is not\n\nappropriate under the “sliding scale” framework.

Therefore, any funds\n\nprovided by a corporation to finance the administration and solicitation of contributions to its\n\nSSF need not be disclosed to the government and need not count against the contribution limits\n\nestablished for political committees. See 2 U.S.C. § 441a(a)(1)(C) (limiting contributions to\n\n“other political committees,” which includes SSFs); id. § 434 (requiring disclosure of all\n\ncontributions and the source of any contributions over $200)\n\n        Second, although an SSF’s solicitation activities are permitted to benefit from\n\nundisclosed corporate subsidization, the FECA limits the universe of people the SSF may solicit:\n\nAn SSF may generally solicit contributions only from its connected corporation’s “stockholders\n\nand their families and its executive or administrative personnel and their families.” Id.\n\n§ 441b(b)(4)(A)(i). The SSF (or its connected corporation) may also solicit rank-and-file\n\nemployees of the connected corporation to contribute to the SSF as long as the solicitations are:\n\n(1) made in writing; (2) addressed to the employees at their residence; (3) made only twice per\n\ncalendar year; and (4) designed such that the SSF and its connected corporation “cannot\n\ndetermine who makes a contribution of $50 or less as a result of such solicitation and who does\n\nnot make such a contribution.” 11 Id. § 441b(b)(4)(B). Thus, there is a major statutory trade-off\n\nfor SSFs: an SSF can have all of its administrative and solicitations costs paid for by its\n\n11\n  This statutory mechanism, although admirably intended to prevent rank-and-file corporate employees from feeling\ncoerced into making political contributions, appears to be easy to circumvent. For example, any corporation intent\non discovering which employees failed to contribute to its connected PAC could refuse to accept any employee\ncontributions of $50 or less and, with this contribution minimum, could thereby deduce which employees gave and\nwhich employees did not.\n\n                                                       10\n\fconnected corporation and need not report the amount or source of those funds, but in order to\n\nenjoy those financial, non-disclosure, and non-reporting benefits the SSF must limit its\n\nsolicitation base. If, however, a political committee wishes to solicit contributions from the\n\ngeneral public, it must disconnect from its affiliated corporation, pay its own administrative and\n\nsolicitation expenses, and disclose and report the amount and source of all funds raised—\n\nincluding any funds that go toward administration and solicitation expenses. In essence, as the\n\nFEC points out, the plaintiffs are seeking relief that would create such a large loophole in\n\npolitical committee disclosure requirements that those requirements would be meaningless. See\n\nDef.’s Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. Prelim. Inj. (“Def.’s Opp’n”) at 15, ECF No. 6 (“This lawsuit,\n\nhowever, seeks to have the statutory disclosure exception swallow the rule . . . .”).\n\n       Third, since Citizens United, SSFs have become vestiges of a bygone world of campaign\n\nfinance. Section 441b’s original purpose was “to prohibit contributions or expenditures by\n\ncorporations or labor organizations in connection with federal elections,” and the SSF was\n\ncreated to “permit[] some participation of unions and corporations in the federal electoral\n\nprocess.” FEC v. Nat’l Right to Work Comm. (“NRWC”), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110819\"><a href=\"/opinion/110819/fec-v-national-right-to-work-committee/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 201 (1982). This\n\nlegislative compromise prevented corporations from directly engaging in political spending,\n\nwhile permitting corporations’ beneficial owners and employees to pool their personal resources\n\nto engage in organized political speech. SSFs continue to be a mechanism through which the\n\nbeneficial owners and employees of corporations can band together to make direct contributions\n\nto candidates and political parties, which corporations are still prohibited from doing directly\n\nunder the FECA and First Amendment jurisprudence. See, e.g., Beaumont, 539 U.S. at 161–63\n\n(upholding § 441b(a)’s prohibition on direct political contributions by corporations); see also\n\nGreen Party of Conn. v. Garfield, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"150472\"><a href=\"/opinion/150472/green-party-of-connecticut-v-garfield/\"><span class=\"volume\">616</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">189</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 199 (2d Cir. 2010) (“Beaumont and other cases\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\fapplying the closely drawn standard to contribution limits remain good law. Indeed, in the\n\nrecent Citizens United case, the [Supreme] Court . . . explicitly declined to reconsider its\n\nprecedents involving campaign contributions by corporations to candidates for elected office.”).\n\nYet, corporations no longer need SSFs to engage in unlimited independent expenditures with\n\ngeneral treasury funds. The Supreme Court eliminated this dependency in Citizens United by\n\nallowing corporations themselves (rather than just their constituent members, officers,\n\nemployees, etc.) to engage in unlimited independent political expenditures. See Citizens United,\n\n130 S. Ct. at 913. Thus, it bears mentioning that the relief sought by the plaintiffs in the instant\n\naction is completely unnecessary to allow the plaintiffs to engage in unlimited independent\n\nexpenditures, individually or together. Rather, this case narrowly touches upon the particular\n\naccounting mechanism through which the plaintiffs may make those expenditures.\n\n        Finally, the Supreme Court has recognized that SSFs are inherently suspect in certain\n\nrespects by virtue of the fact that a single entity (corporation, labor union, etc.) pays all of their\n\nadministration expenses. In California Medical Association v. FEC (“Cal-Med”), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110551\"><a href=\"/opinion/110551/california-medical-assn-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">453</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(1981), the Supreme Court observed:\n\n        If unlimited contributions for administrative support are permissible, individuals\n        and groups like CMA could completely dominate the operations and contribution\n        policies of independent political committees such as CALPAC. Moreover, if an\n        individual or association was permitted to fund the entire operation of a political\n        committee, all moneys solicited by that committee could be converted into\n        contributions, the use of which might well be dictated by the committee’s main\n        supporter. In this manner, political committees would be able to influence the\n        electoral process to an extent disproportionate to their public support and far\n        greater than the individual or group that finances the committee’s operations\n        would be able to do acting alone. In so doing, they could corrupt the political\n        process in a manner that Congress, through its contribution restrictions, has\n        sought to prohibit.\n\nCal-Med, 453 U.S. at 198 n.19. Connected SSFs can essentially accept “unlimited contributions\n\nfor administrative support” because of the exemption in 2 U.S.C. § 441b(b)(2)(C) and therefore\n\n\n                                                   12\n\fofficials with control of the money spigot at the connected corporation can “completely dominate\n\nthe operations and contribution policies” of the SSF. See id. Moreover, SSFs may also accept\n\nunlimited amounts of undisclosed money from the connected corporation to pay for solicitations.\n\nSee 2 U.S.C. § 441b(b)(2)(C). Because of this, SSFs are “able to influence the electoral process\n\nto an extent disproportionate to their public support,” and can do so to an extent “far greater than\n\nthe [connected corporation] would be able to do acting alone.” Cal-Med, 453 U.S. at 198 n.19;\n\nsee also EMILY’s List, 581 F.3d at 12 n.10 (“The requirement that certain administrative\n\nexpenses be funded in part with hard money prevents a contributor from essentially taking\n\ncontrol of a non-profit and thereby circumventing limits on individual contributions to\n\ncandidates.” (citing Cal-Med, 453 U.S. at 198–99 n.19)).\n\n       With these facts in mind, the Court will first discuss recently established First\n\nAmendment principles regarding independent expenditures and the continuing vitality of\n\ncampaign finance regulations. Then, with those principles in tow, the Court will proceed to\n\nevaluate the probability that the plaintiffs will succeed on the merits of their claims that the\n\ncontribution and solicitation limitations in §§ 441a(a)(1)(C), 441a(a)(3), and 441b(b)(4)(A)(i) are\n\nunconstitutional as applied to SSFs that engage in both direct candidate contributions and\n\nexpress advocacy.\n\n               1.      First Amendment Principles\n\n       The First Amendment, which provides that “Congress shall make no law . . . abridging\n\nthe freedom of speech,” U.S. CONST. amend.

But this means\n\nthat any freedom of speech principle carries with it a commitment to constrain speech that\n\ndestroys these things.”). One oft-discussed kind of potentially harmful speech is money spent in\n\nthe context of the electoral process. When money is conceptualized as speech, as the Supreme\n\nCourt has, 13 and when that pecuniary speech is given free reign to influence the election of those\n\nentrusted to lead and shape the character of our democracy, a legitimate and complex question\n\narises about what constitutional limits can be placed on the flow of money spent with a political\n\npurpose—limits intended to prevent behavior that corrodes the very legitimacy and integrity of\n\nour democratic institutions. In Citizens United, the Supreme Court reviewed—and rejected—the\n\ngovernmental interests used over the years to limit political speech, including “an antidistortion\n\ninterest,” and a “shareholder-protection interest,” and concluded that while “[t]he appearance of\n\ninfluence or access . . . will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy,” activity that\n\n“lead[s] to, or create[s] the appearance of, quid pro quo corruption” is a sufficiently compelling\n\ngovernmental interest to justify limits on political speech. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 909–13.\n\n\n13\n   See, e.g., Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 898 (“Section 441b’s prohibition on corporate independent expenditures is\nthus a ban on speech. As a ‘restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political\ncommunications during a campaign,’ that statute ‘necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the\nnumber of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.’” (quoting Buckley\nv.

Justice Stevens has observed that this conceptualization may be problematic:\n         Money is property; it is not speech.\n                    Speech has the power to inspire volunteers to perform a multitude of tasks on a campaign\n         trail, on a battleground, or even on a football field. Money, meanwhile, has the power to pay hired\n         laborers to perform the same tasks. It does not follow, however, that the First Amendment\n         provides the same measure of protection to the use of money to accomplish such goals as it\n         provides to the use of ideas to achieve the same results.\nNixon v.

Gov’t PAC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118335\"><a href=\"/opinion/118335/nixon-v-shrink-missouri-government-pac/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">377</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 398 (2000) (Stevens, J., concurring).\n\n                                                         15\n\f         Both parties agree that corporate entities have the same First Amendment right as\n\nindividuals to engage in unlimited independent political expenditures. See Def.’s Opp’n at 1\n\n(stating that “a corporation’s First Amendment right to finance independent campaign advocacy”\n\nis “undisputed and not at issue here”). The Supreme Court established that principle nearly three\n\nyears ago in Citizens United. See 130 S. Ct. at 909 (“[W]e now conclude that independent\n\nexpenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the\n\nappearance of corruption.”). The D.C. Circuit has also established that other campaign finance\n\nregulations are unconstitutional as applied to non-connected political committees (i.e., political\n\ncommittees not established by a candidate, political party, labor union, or corporation). In\n\nEMILY’s List—a case decided shortly before Citizens United—the D.C. Circuit held that non-\n\nconnected political committees, which make direct contributions to candidates and political\n\nparties, have a constitutional right also to accept unlimited contributions to finance\n\n“expenditures—such as [ballot initiative] advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter\n\nregistration drives,” so long as they “ensure, to avoid circumvention of individual contribution\n\nlimits by [their] donors, that [their] contributions to parties or candidates come from a hard-\n\nmoney account.” See EMILY’s List, 581 F.3d at 12. 14 Six months later, shortly after Citizens\n\nUnited was decided, the D.C. Circuit held in SpeechNow that the contribution limits in 2 U.S.C.\n\n§ 441a(a) were unconstitutional as applied to contributions made by individuals to a non-\n\nconnected political committee that made only independent expenditures because “the\n\ngovernment can have no anti-corruption interest in limiting contributions to independent\n\nexpenditure-only organizations.” SpeechNow, 599 F.3d at 695–96 (“The contribution limits of 2\n\n14\n  In EMILY’s List, the D.C.

Finally, in Carey, another Judge on this Court held that a\n\nnon-connected political committee may operate simultaneously as both a multicandidate political\n\ncommittee (making direct candidate contributions) and an independent expenditure-only political\n\ncommittee by establishing separate bank accounts for each activity. See Carey, 791 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 130–32.\n\n         A number of precepts—some broad, others narrow—can be derived from this body of\n\nrecent case law. First, EMILY’s List and Carey have endorsed the hybridization of political\n\ncommittees—at least when such political committees are not connected to a candidate, political\n\nparty, corporation, or labor union. In other words, “[t]he constitutional principles that govern . . .\n\na hybrid non-profit entity follow ineluctably from the well-established principles governing the\n\nother two categories of non-profits,” which either (1) make only direct contributions to\n\ncandidates or (2) make only “expenditures for political activities.” 15 EMILY’s List, 581 F.3d at\n\n12. An important aspect to acknowledge about EMILY’s List, however, is that although it began\n\nwith a very broad discussion of First Amendment principles, the Circuit’s holding was ultimately\n\nquite narrow. The case invalidated certain FEC regulations because they required a non-\n\nconnected, non-profit political committee to use its hard-money (i.e., direct candidate and party\n\ncontribution) account to pay for certain soft-money activities, namely “expenditures such as\n\nadvertisements [about ballot initiatives], get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter registration drives.”\n\nId. at 16. The Court’s holding was that “non-profits may not be forced to use their hard money\n\n15\n  The Circuit in EMILY’s List was careful not to use the statutory term of art “independent expenditure,” which is\nan expenditure “expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate,” 2 U.S.C. § 431(17),\nbecause the plaintiff in in EMILY’s List did not engage in any express advocacy communications that would have\nbeen considered “independent expenditures.” The Court instead referred more generally to “expenditures for\npolitical activities” or simply “expenditures.” See EMILY’s List 581 F.3d at 6–9, 11–12.\n\n                                                         17\n\faccounts” to pay for such expenditures. Id. Thus, EMILY’s List clearly announced that some\n\nlevel of hybridization is acceptable for registered political committees, but the Court left open\n\nthe question of how much hybridization is too much.\n\n         Carey, in turn, extended EMILY’s List. The court in Carey held that a non-connected\n\npolitical committee could combine direct contribution activities with not only generic political\n\nexpenditures but also “independent expenditures,” which by definition are expenditures that\n\n“expressly advocat[e] the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.” Carey, 791 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 132; see also 2 U.S.C. § 431(17) (defining “independent expenditure”). The “soft\n\nmoney” expenditures in EMILY’s List are distinct from the express advocacy contained in\n\nindependent expenditures, see, e.g., Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 910–11 (“This case, however,\n\nis about independent expenditures, not soft money.”), 16 yet Carey did not distinguish between\n\nthe express advocacy communications it was presented with and the generic soft-money\n\nexpenditures addressed in EMILY’s List. On the contrary, the court in Carey concluded that\n\n“[the plaintiff] and EMILY’s List are identical in that regard.” Id. at 130. Carey also dismissed\n\nany corruption concerns that might be present with a hybrid political committee that makes both\n\ndirect candidate contributions and express advocacy communications, citing the holdings of\n\nCitizens United and SpeechNow: independent expenditures do not give rise to corruption or the\n\nappearance of corruption. See id. at 135 (citing Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 909 and\n\nSpeechNow, 599 F.3d at 693).

Circuit has\n\nyet to endorse the expansion of allowable hybrid activity announced in Carey.\n\n         The second precept to glean from these cases is the genesis of so-called “Super PACs”—\n\npolitical committees that can raise unlimited money to engage in unlimited electioneering\n\ncommunications, so long as their activities are not made “in cooperation, consultation, or\n\nconcert, with, or at the request or suggestion of” a candidate, his or her authorized political\n\ncommittee, or a national, State, or local committee of a political party. 2 U.S.C. § 441a(7)(B).\n\nThese “Super PACs” are permitted to exist by virtue of two cases. The first is the Supreme\n\nCourt’s decision in Citzens United, which held that corporations could not be prevented from\n\nengaging in their own unlimited political speech funded from the corporation’s general treasury\n\nso long as that speech is in the form of independent expenditures. See Citizens United, 130 S. Ct.\n\nat 909. The second is the D.C. Circuit’s decision in SpeechNow, which held that individuals can\n\ncontribute unlimited amounts to a non-connected political committee, as long as the political\n\ncommittee is engaged solely in independent expenditures. See SpeechNow, 599 F.3d at 694 (“In\n\nlight of the [Supreme] Court’s holding as a matter of law that independent expenditures do not\n\ncorrupt or create the appearance of quid pro quo corruption, contributions to groups that make\n\nonly independent expenditures also cannot corrupt or create the appearance of corruption.”).\n\nEssentially, as long as a non-connected political committee engages only in independent\n\nexpenditures, it is now permitted to receive unlimited amounts of money from both individuals\n\nand corporations.

See Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 908 (“‘The\n\nabsence of prearrangement and coordination of an expenditure with the candidate or his\n\nagent . . . alleviates the danger that expenditures will be given as a quid pro quo for improper\n\ncommitments from the candidate.’” (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 47)); id. at 910 (“By\n\ndefinition, an independent expenditure is political speech presented to the electorate that is not\n\ncoordinated with a candidate.”); SpeechNow, 599 F.3d at 693 (“The independence of\n\nindependent expenditures was a central consideration in the Court’s decision [in Citizens\n\nUnited].”); id. (“[A] lack of coordination diminishes the possibility of corruption.”). Hence,\n\nthere can be little doubt that the independence of independent expenditures is the lynchpin that\n\nholds together the principle that no limits can be placed on contributions for such expenditures.\n\nIf express advocacy for particular federal candidates were to lose its independence (either in\n\nreality or appearance), it stands to reason that the doctrine carefully crafted in Citizens United\n\nand SpeechNow would begin to tumble back to Earth.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 20\n\f         The third and final precept, which loomed large behind the development of the first two\n\nprecepts, is that the government’s interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of\n\ncorruption endures as a compelling justification to restrict certain kinds of political speech. In\n\nparticular, courts continue to recognize that preventing corruption or the appearance of\n\ncorruption is sufficiently important to regulate entities that engage in direct contributions to\n\ncandidates and political parties, including “multicandidate political committees,” which are\n\npolitical committees that “ha[ve] made contributions to 5 or more candidates for Federal office.”\n\n2 U.S.C. § 441a(a)(4); see Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 908 (“The Buckley Court, nevertheless,\n\nsustained limits on direct contributions in order to ensure against the reality or appearance of\n\ncorruption.”); SpeechNow, 599 F.3d at 695 (“Limits on direct contributions to candidates, ‘unlike\n\nlimits on independent expenditures, have been an accepted means to prevent quid pro quo\n\ncorruption.’” (quoting Citizens United, 130 S.

Although this narrowing of Buckley is at\nodds with language from other Supreme Court precedents cited above (Cal-Med and McConnell), the D.C. Circuit’s\nnarrow interpretation of Buckley binds this Court.\n\n                                                          22\n\fstemming from public awareness of the opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large\n\nindividual financial contributions.” Buckley, 424 U.S. at 27.\n\n       This sets the stage for the constitutional question presently before the Court: Does the\n\ngovernment have a sufficiently compelling interest in limiting contributions to (and solicitations\n\nby) connected political committees that engage in both express advocacy communications and\n\ndirect candidate contributions? All that such a hybrid organization needs to do, according to\n\nCarey, is establish two separate bank accounts—one for direct contributions and one for\n\nindependent expenditures—and voilà: the appearance of corruption and undue influence\n\nmagically disappear. Yet, the allowances of such hybrid PACs transmogrify Congress’s intent in\n\ncompartmentalizing “multicandidate political committees” from other kinds of political\n\nassociations. When a PAC gives directly to candidates with its right hand and engages in\n\nexpress advocacy with its left hand, the risk that the PAC’s hybrid spending will appear\n\ncorrupting and corrosive is manifest. When the public sees a hybrid PAC hand a check to a\n\ncandidate or party leader while that PAC simultaneously spends unlimited amounts on highly\n\nvisible electioneering communications that directly advocate for that candidate’s election, the\n\nfaçade of “independence”—even if formally observed by using separate funds or accounts—\n\nappears non-existent to the public. Thus, the “belief that quid pro quo arrangements can be\n\nneatly demarcated from other improper influences does not accord with the theory or reality of\n\npolitics.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 961 (Stevens, J., dissenting); see also id. at 962 (“[A]\n\nlarge majority of Americans (80%) are of the view that corporations and other organizations that\n\nengage in electioneering communications, which benefit specific elected officials, receive special\n\nconsideration from those officials when matters arise that affect these corporations and\n\n\n\n\n                                                 23\n\forganizations.” (quoting McConnell v.

With these precedents in mind, the Court will now assess the\n\nprobability of success of the plaintiffs’ constitutional claims.\n\n                  2.       Contribution Limits\n\n         First, the plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of the contribution limits in 2 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 441a(a)(1)(C) and 441a(a)(3) as applied to SSFs that make both direct contributions and\n\nexpress advocacy communications. Those provisions prohibit making contributions to any\n\n“other political committee” (including SSFs) that exceed $5,000 in any calendar year and also\n\nprohibit making contributions that aggregate more than $57,500 biennially. 20 Plaintiffs Glengary\n\nLLC and Todd Cefaratti claim that they are both interested in making contributions to the\n\nLeadership Fund that exceed these limits and are prohibited from doing so by these restrictions.\n\nSee Compl. ¶¶ 25–26, 71. Those contribution limits for individuals, such as plaintiff Cefaratti,\n\nhave already been held unconstitutional as applied to non-connected political committees. See\n\nSpeechNow, 599 F.3d at 696.\n\n\n\n19\n  The Court of Appeals’ holding in SpeechNow, which struck down as unconstitutional limits on individuals’\ncontributions to independent expenditure-only groups, did not account for the newly minted approval of “hybrid”\nPACs in EMILY’s List. Indeed, SpeechNow never even cited to EMILY’s List. Although SpeechNow purported to\nlimit its holding to “contributions to independent expenditure-only organizations,” 599 F.3d at 696, the plaintiffs\ninvite the Court to conclude that the dual-account model supplied by EMILY’s List for hybrid PACs be read in\ntandem with SpeechNow to expand SpeechNow’s holding to any organization that engages in some amount of\nindependent expenditure activity. The Court declines the plaintiffs’ invitation.\n20\n  The $57,500 biennial cap applies to all contributions that are not made “to candidates and the authorized\ncommittees of candidates,” though of the $57,500 cap no more than $37,500 “may be attributable to contributions to\npolitical committees which are not political committees of national political parties.” 2 U.S.C. § 441a(a)(3)(B).\n\n                                                         24\n\f         The plaintiffs contend that the broad-based discussion of contribution limits in\n\nSpeechNow and EMILY’s List dictate a result in the plaintiffs’ favor. Those cases are\n\ndistinguishable, however, and therefore do not control the outcome of the instant case. First,\n\nalthough EMILY’s List was a facial challenge, the regulations challenged in that case only dealt\n\nwith solicitation and allocation restrictions, not contribution limits. EMILY’s List, 581 F.3d at\n\n15–18 (outlining provisions of challenged regulations). Hence, to the extent the Court’s analysis\n\ntouched upon contribution limits, it was pure dicta. Second and perhaps more importantly,\n\nalthough the non-profit plaintiff in EMILY’s List engaged in “expenditures,” none of the\n\nexpenditures at issue involved express advocacy for or against a clearly identified federal\n\ncandidate. Rather, the expenditures involved in EMILY’s List were either issue-based advocacy\n\nor voter turnout and registration activities. See id. at 12 (noting that EMILY’s List “makes\n\nexpenditures for advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter registration drives”);\n\nEMILY’s List v. FEC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1518212\"><a href=\"/opinion/1518212/emilys-list-v-federal-election-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">569</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The Circuit did not explicitly state why non-connectedness was\nimportant to its analysis, though the repeated emphasis on non-connectedness implies that it was in fact important.\nNevertheless, this Court will not venture to speculate as to the doctrinal importance of the non-connected nature of\nthe non-profit at issue in EMILY’s List, other than to observe that the entity at issue in the instant case (the\nLeadership Fund) is, by contrast, a connected political committee.\n\n                                                           25\n\fthe instant case. The distinction is critical primarily because express advocacy has an inherently\n\nstronger nexus to particular candidates, which materially alters the constitutional analysis of\n\nhybrid political committees.

This anti-corruption interest continues to justify the $5,000\n\nannual cap on hybrid PACs like the Leadership Fund that desire to make both independent\n\nelectioneering expenditures, including express advocacy communications, and direct\n\n\n\n\n23\n  It also appears that the plaintiffs in SpeechNow and EMILY’s List were not established, administered, or\nsubsidized by a corporation and thus were “non-connected,” unlike the Leadership Fund in the instant action.\n\n                                                        27\n\fcontributions to federal parties and candidates. The Supreme Court observed as much in Cal-\n\nMed when the plurality held:\n\n       If the First Amendment rights of a contributor are not infringed by limitations on\n       the amount he may contribute to a campaign organization which advocates the\n       views and candidacy of a particular candidate, the rights of a contributor are\n       similarly not impaired by limits on the amount he may give to a multicandidate\n       political committee . . . which advocates the views and candidacies of a number of\n       candidates.\n\nCal-Med, 453 U.S. at 183–84 (plurality opinion) (citation omitted).\n\n       As discussed above, the government’s interest in preventing the appearance of political\n\ncorruption and undue influence is at its zenith when individuals and organizations give money\n\ndirectly to political candidates and political parties. As the Supreme Court prophetically stated\n\nover thirty-five years ago:\n\n       Under a system of private financing of elections, a candidate lacking immense\n       personal or family wealth must depend on financial contributions from others to\n       provide the resources necessary to conduct a successful campaign. The increasing\n       importance of the communications media and sophisticated mass-mailing and\n       polling operations to effective campaigning make the raising of large sums of\n       money an ever more essential ingredient of an effective candidacy. To the extent\n       that large contributions are given to secure a political quid pro quo from current\n       and potential office holders, the integrity of our system of representative\n       democracy is undermined.\n\nBuckley, 424 U.S. at 26–27. This has been the justification for contribution limits to\n\nmulticandidate political committees for decades. See, e.g., Cal-Med, 153 U.S. at 197–98\n\n(plurality opinion) (holding that limits on contributions to multicandidate political committees\n\n“further the governmental interest in preventing the actual or apparent corruption of the political\n\nprocess”).\n\n       When a single entity is allowed to make both limited direct contributions and unlimited\n\nindependent expenditures, keeping the bank accounts for those two purposes separate is simply\n\ninsufficient to overcome the appearance that the entity is in cahoots with the candidates and\n\n\n                                                28\n\fparties that it coordinates with and supports. Although such an entity may maintain separate\n\nbank accounts, it need not maintain separate management or hold itself out to the public as\n\nengaging in two distinct activities. Thus from the perspective of any citizen who does not\n\nscrutinize the entity’s bank statements, all of the entity’s spending (direct contributions and\n\nexpress advocacy communications) is coming from the same place.

To conclude\n\nthat a “hybrid” PAC’s direct contributions to (and attendant coordination with) candidates and\n\nparties do not infect, or appear to infect, all of its operations in the political arena is naïve and\n\nsimply out of touch with the American public’s clear disillusionment with the massive amounts\n\nof private money that have dominated the political system, particularly since Citizens United. 24\n\n\n\n24\n  See Brennan Ctr. for Justice, National Survey: Super PACs, Corruption, and Democracy 2–3 (2012) (reporting\nthat 73% of respondents in national poll agreed that “there would be less corruption if there were limits on how\nmuch could be given to Super PACs,” 77% “agreed that members of Congress are more likely to act in the interest\nof a group that spent millions to elect them than to act in the public interest,” and 65% said that “they trust\ngovernment less because big donors to Super PACs have more influence than regular voters”); see also Morgan\nLittle, Poll: Americans Largely in Favor of Campaign Spending Limitations, L.A.

Ct. at 964 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (“A democracy cannot function\n\neffectively when its constituent members believe laws are being bought and sold.”). Although\n\n“[a] non-profit that makes expenditures to support federal candidates does not suddenly forfeit its\n\nFirst Amendment rights when it decides also to make direct contributions to parties or\n\ncandidates,” EMILY’s List, 581 F.3d at 12, such a hybrid PAC also does not lose its status as a\n\nmulticandidate political committee merely by making independent expenditures.\n\n         This is, of course, not to say that an organization like the Leadership Fund forfeits its\n\nFirst Amendment rights simply by virtue of wanting to make both direct contributions and\n\nindependent electioneering expenditures. Those rights remain unscathed. Further, the burden on\n\nthe plaintiffs to comply with the current contribution limits is minimal. If banding together to\n\nengage in unlimited political speech is their goal, the plaintiffs could easily form an independent\n\nexpenditure-only PAC (i.e., a Super PAC) and receive contributions in unlimited amounts.\n\nCompare SpeechNow, 599 F.3d at 697 (“[P]laintiffs argue that the additional burden that would\n\nbe imposed on SpeechNow if it were required to comply with the organizational and reporting\n\nrequirements applicable to political committees is too much for the First Amendment to bear.\n\nWe disagree.”), with Pls.’ Reply Mem. in Supp. Mot. Prelim. Inj. (“Pls.’ Reply”) at 11, ECF No.\n\n7 (“The FEC cannot require [the Leadership Fund] to clone itself to make independent\n\nexpenditures.”). Therefore, the contribution limits at 2 U.S.C. §§ 441a(a)(1)(C) and 441a(a)(3)\n\nare constitutional as applied to the Leadership Fund, insofar as the Leadership Fund operates as a\n\nsingle entity that makes both direct contributions and express advocacy communications. 25\n\n\n\norganizations are permitted to contribute to groups seeking to influence the outcome of presidential and\ncongressional races”).\n25\n  As discussed above, this holding does not prevent the Leadership Fund or any of the other plaintiffs from\nengaging in unlimited independent expenditures. It merely imposes a narrow limit on the mechanism through which\nthey may do so. For example, STI could establish a second connected PAC that engaged in only independent\n\n                                                         30\n\f                  3.       Solicitation Restrictions\n\n         Next, the plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of the FECA’s restrictions on the group\n\nof people from whom an SSF may solicit contributions. Section 441b(b)(4)(A)(i) of the FECA\n\nmakes it unlawful “for a corporation, or a separate segregated fund established by a corporation,\n\nto solicit contributions to such a fund from any person other than its stockholders and their\n\nfamilies and its executive or administrative personnel.” SSFs may also solicit the rank-and-file\n\nemployees of their connected corporations as long as the solicitations are: (1) made in writing;\n\n(2) addressed to the employees at their residence; (3) made only twice per calendar year; and\n\n(4) designed such that the SSF and its connected corporation “cannot determine who makes a\n\ncontribution of $50 or less as a result of such solicitation and who does not make such a\n\ncontribution.” Id. § 441b(b)(4)(B). The plaintiffs state, however, that they do not challenge the\n\nvalidity of these latter restrictions, which regulate the manner in which rank-and-file employees\n\nmay be solicited. See Pls.’ Mem. in Supp. Mot. Prelim. Inj. (“Pls.’ Mem.”) at 3, ECF No. 4-1\n\n(“Plaintiffs do not challenge . . . the prohibition on soliciting employees of the SSF not in the\n\nrestricted class more than twice annually subject to certain restrictions.” (citing 2 U.S.C.\n\n§ 441b(b)(4)(B))). Rather, the plaintiffs seek to expand the scope of people who may be\n\nsolicited beyond the limited group of individuals associated with the host corporation through an\n\nownership or employment interest. In essence, however, the direct solicitation restrictions for\n\nrank-and-file employees would be swallowed if the relief sought by the plaintiffs were granted\n\n(and STI and the Leadership Fund were permitted to solicit from the general public) because the\n\ngeneral public necessarily would include rank-and-file employees.\n\n\n\n\nexpenditures. Also, any or all of the plaintiffs could establish a non-connected political committee that engages in\nonly independent expenditures.\n\n                                                         31\n\f       Soliciting money for political spending is distinct from either making political\n\ncontributions or making independent political expenditures, though all three activities enjoy First\n\nAmendment protection. The Supreme Court has held that “[s]oliciting financial support is\n\nundoubtedly subject to reasonable regulation,” so long as that regulation is “undertaken with due\n\nregard for the reality that solicitation is characteristically intertwined with informative and\n\nperhaps persuasive speech.” Vill. of Schaumberg v.

The\n\nplaintiffs have discussed their proposed solicitation activities solely in terms of how those\n\nsolicitations will allow them to raise particular amounts of money, see, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 27, 40–\n\n41, 43; Pls.’ Mem. at 6 (“[The Leadership Fund] wants to solicit Mr. Ehlinger to make a $1,500\n\ncontribution to a[n] [independent expenditure-only] account . . . .”); id. at 10 (“[The Leadership\n\nFund] would like to solicit contributions for its independent expenditures in amounts greater than\n\n$5,000.00 per calendar year.”), but the act of soliciting money in certain amounts, by itself, does\n\nnot warrant strong First Amendment protection—even if it is for the purpose of later engaging in\n\nprotected speech. See Kennedy, 116 F.3d at 497 (observing that the First Amendment does not\n\ncontemplate “the right to raise money”). Nevertheless, the Court is wary of labeling the\n\nplaintiffs’ proposed solicitations as pure commercial speech, particularly because this Circuit has\n\nrecognized that the solicitation of campaign funds “is close to the core of protected speech.”\n\nBlount, 61 F.3d at 941 (citing Village of Schaumberg, 444 U.S. at 632). A restriction on\n\nsolicitation activity thus generally “cannot be sustained unless it serves a sufficiently strong,\n\n\n26\n  The FEC has stated that one of its concerns is that the Leadership Fund will solicit the general public through\nexpressive or persuasive conduct, but the plaintiffs do not address this possibility in their Complaint or their\nbriefing. See Def.’s Opp’n at 16 (noting “the damage that would result from STI’s proposal to pay for undisclosed\nsolicitations of the general public—communications that can themselves support or oppose federal candidates”).\n\n                                                        33\n\fsubordinating interest that the [government] is entitled to protect.” Village of Schaumberg, 444\n\nU.S. at 636; see also id. at 637 (noting that restriction on solicitation activities “may serve [the\n\ngovernment’s] legitimate interests, but it must do so by narrowly drawn regulations designed to\n\nserve those interests without unnecessarily interfering with First Amendment freedoms”). 27\n\n         The Supreme Court established long ago, however, that the federal government has a\n\nnumber of “sufficiently strong” interests in limiting the solicitation activities of SSFs. See\n\nNRWC, 459 U.S. at 206–10. The plaintiffs are incorrect in arguing that the Supreme Court’s\n\ndecision in NRWC, upholding the FECA’s solicitation restrictions, was only “based upon an anti-\n\ndistortion rationale thoroughly rejected by the Supreme Court in Citizens United.” Pls.’ Reply.\n\nat 14 n.12. NRWC discussed the constitutionality of the very same solicitation restrictions that\n\nthat plaintiffs challenge in the instant action. The plaintiff in NRWC challenged the solicitation\n\nrestrictions in 2 U.S.C. § 441b(b)(4)(A), arguing (as the plaintiffs do here) that they restricted the\n\nability of the corporation’s SSF to associate with people who shared its political beliefs. See\n\nNRWC, 459 U.S. at 206–07; see also Pls.’ Reply at 14 (arguing for “fundamental right to\n\nassociate by soliciting contributions”). The Court rejected this challenge on several grounds.\n\nFirst, the Court pointed to an anti-distortion rationale, i.e., ensuring that “substantial aggregations\n\nof wealth amassed by the special advantages which go with the corporate form of organization\n\nshould not be converted into political ‘war chests,’” as well as a shareholder protection rationale,\n\n\n27\n  The plaintiffs seem to believe that the right to engage in unrestricted solicitation of funds follows ineluctably from\nthe holding in Citizens United because, in the plaintiffs’ view, every campaign finance regulation that has any nexus\nto independent expenditures is also unconstitutional. See, e.g., Pls.’ Reply at 14. Yet, this is clearly not so. For\nexample, courts have consistently upheld the FECA’s organizational, reporting, and disclosure requirements—\nrequirements that continue to apply to independent expenditure-only organizations, despite the fact that compliance\nwith such requirements imposes costs that necessarily divert organizational resources away from independent\nexpenditure activity. See Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 916 ([D]isclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react\nto the speech of corporate entities in a proper way. This transparency enables the electorate to make informed\ndecisions and give proper weight to different speakers and messages.”); SpeechNow, 599 F.3d at 697 (rejecting\nplaintiffs’ argument that organizational and reporting requirements on political committees are violative of the First\nAmendment).\n\n                                                          34\n\fi.e., “to protect the individuals who have paid money into a corporation or union for purposes\n\nother than the support of candidates from having that money used to support political candidates\n\nto whom they may be opposed,” and found that both were “sufficient to justify the [solicitation\n\nrestrictions] at issue.” NRWC, 459 U.S. at 207–08. Significantly, the Court then went on to\n\ndiscuss a third key rationale that supported the solicitation restrictions: “the importance of\n\npreventing both the actual corruption threatened by large financial contributions and the eroding\n\nof public confidence in the electoral process through the appearance of corruption.” Id. at 208.\n\nThe Court stated that “[i]n order to prevent both actual and apparent corruption, Congress aimed\n\na part of its regulatory scheme at corporations” and that “[w]hile § 441b restricts the solicitation\n\nof corporations and labor unions without great financial resources, as well as those more\n\nfortunately situated, we accept Congress’s judgment that it is the potential for such [corrupting]\n\ninfluence that demands regulation.” Id. at 209–10. Therefore, contrary to the plaintiffs’\n\nassertion, the Supreme Court in NRWC also relied upon the well-established and compelling\n\nanti-corruption rationale in upholding § 441b’s solicitation restrictions. Nothing in Citizens\n\nUnited or any other Supreme Court case has displaced the holding in NRWC, and this Court is\n\nbound to follow it here.\n\n       Yet another important consideration implicated by the solicitation restrictions challenged\n\nin this case is the government’s interest in protecting the First Amendment rights of a\n\ncorporation’s employees. This concern was not addressed by the majority in Citizens United or\n\nthe Court of Appeals in EMILY’s List and SpeechNow, but it is vitally important to the health of\n\nAmerican democracy. See NRWC, 459 U.S. at 206 (observing that FECA’s restrictions on SSF\n\nsolicitations were intended to prevent such solicitations from “coerc[ing] members of the\n\ncorporation holding minority political views”). As Justice Stevens noted in his piercing dissent,\n\n\n\n                                                 35\n\f“[t]he majority seems oblivious to the simple truth that laws such as [the FECA] do not merely\n\npit the anticorruption interest against the First Amendment, but also pit competing First\n\nAmendment values against each other.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 976 (Stevens, J.,\n\ndissenting). “The Court’s blinkered and aphoristic approach to the First Amendment may well\n\npromote corporate power at the cost of the individual and collective self-expression the\n\nAmendment was meant to serve.” Id. at 977.\n\n       Providing corporations with an unlimited political voice may bring more and louder\n\nvoices to the national political dialogue as the Citizens United majority repeatedly emphasized\n\nand lauded, but allowing unlimited amplification of corporate political speech will also\n\ninevitably chill the political speech of corporate employees whose views diverge from their\n\ncorporate employers. The plaintiffs assure the Court that they will abide by the FECA’s other\n\napplicable solicitation restrictions, such as the restriction on only soliciting rank-and-file\n\nemployees twice per year under certain restrictions, “the requirement to ‘inform each employee it\n\nsolicits of the political purposes of [the SSF]’ and ‘of his right to refuse to contribute without any\n\nreprisal.’” Pls.’ Reply at 6, 16 (quoting Def.’s Opp’n at 23). Yet, as one commentator has noted,\n\n“the inherent potential for coercion in employer-employee relationships . . . cannot simply be\n\nundone by prohibiting explicit or implicit threats or discrimination.” Paul M. Secunda,\n\nAddressing Political Captive Audience Workplace Meetings in the Post-Citizens United\n\nEnvironment, 120 YALE L.J. ONLINE 17, 24 (2010). Rather, “it is in the best interest of all\n\ninvolved to keep political discussions and partisanship out of the public and private workplace.”\n\nId. The relief sought by the plaintiffs would do just the opposite. As noted above, allowing STI\n\nand the Leadership Fund to solicit funds from the general public would essentially do away with\n\nthe FECA’s strict limitations on how corporate employees may be solicited because all corporate\n\n\n\n                                                  36\n\femployees are also members of the general public. The danger that rank-and-file employees\n\nwould be exposed to repeated public solicitations from their employer’s PAC 28—via direct mail,\n\nradio, television, or other public media of the corporation’s choice—and would thereby feel\n\ncoerced to contribute or adopt a particular political viewpoint at work, represents an\n\nunacceptable risk of infringing those employees’ First Amendment rights. Preventing such an\n\noutcome would essentially require rewriting the statute to account for the existence of general-\n\npublic solicitation, which is a task for the Congress, not this Court.\n\n         The solicitation restrictions in § 441b are also narrowly drawn to serve the foregoing\n\ngovernmental interests because the restrictions are tailored to match the special benefit that\n\nCongress extended to SSFs—exempting all funds used for “the establishment, administration,\n\nand solicitation of contributions to a [SSF]” from the definition of “contributions.” See 2 U.S.C.\n\n§ 441b(b)(2)(C). This exemption, as discussed above, evidences a delicate statutory balancing of\n\nburden and benefit: An SSF’s solicitation speech may be subsidized by its connected\n\ncorporation, so long as those solicitations are limited to corporate insiders and employees. See\n\nid. § 441b(b). The statutory exemption allows connected PACs to avoid the disclosure and\n\nreporting requirements that would otherwise apply to contributions that fund political\n\nsolicitations. Consequently, donations to the general treasury of the non-profit corporation in\n\nany amount from any source may be funneled, without disclosing or reporting the amount or the\n\nsource, to the connected PAC for use in solicitations. 29 Removing the statute’s restrictions on\n\n\n\n28\n  Corporate employees would be well aware that they are being solicited by their employer’s PAC because each\nSSF is required to “include the name of its connected organization” in its name. 2 U.S.C. § 432(e)(5).\n29\n  This is yet another distinction between the instant case and EMILY’s List. The plaintiff in EMILY’s List, unlike\nthe plaintiff STI in the instant action, was registered as a political committee and thus was required to disclose the\namount and source of any “contributions,” i.e., any monies given to the organization “for the purpose of influencing\nany election for Federal office.” See 2 U.S.C. § 431(8)(A); EMILY’s List, 581 F.3d at 16 n.15. STI is a 501(c)(4)\nnon-profit that need not disclose the source or amount of any contributions to its general treasury.\n\n                                                         37\n\fthe breadth of such solicitations would allow the disclosure and reporting exception to swallow\n\nthe rule.\n\n        SSFs are creatures of statute—they were crafted by Congress to enjoy certain benefits\n\nthat other, non-connected PACs cannot enjoy, and it is therefore eminently reasonable and\n\nimportant for connected PACs to abide by Congress’s countervailing restriction on the universe\n\nof people to whom SSFs’ solicitations may be directed. See Cal-Med, 453 U.S. at 201 (“[T]he\n\nsegregated funds that unions and corporations may establish pursuant to § 441b(b)(2)(C) are\n\ncarefully limited in [the manner and scope of their solicitations].”). The solicitation restrictions\n\ndo not limit the content or frequency of the plaintiffs’ solicitation messages, and therefore it\n\nwould be inappropriate to upset the careful legislative balance struck in § 441b(b). The FEC’s\n\n“reasonable regulation” upon the solicitation of financial support to SSFs is therefore permissible\n\nbecause it exercises “due regard for the reality that solicitation is characteristically intertwined\n\nwith informative and perhaps persuasive speech.” See Village of Schaumberg, 444 U.S. at 632.\n\n                                                 ***\n\n        In sum, the plaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their\n\nclaims. Although the Court will continue to discuss the other three preliminary injunction\n\nfactors in assessing the plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction, the foregoing conclusion\n\nabout the merits of the plaintiffs’ claims is sufficient to grant the FEC’s Motion to Dismiss. As a\n\nresult, the Leadership Fund may establish two separate bank accounts that may be used for direct\n\ncontributions and independent expenditures (including express advocacy). Insofar as the\n\nLeadership Fund chooses to remain as a single entity that engages in both direct candidate\n\ncontributions and express advocacy communications, however, the Leadership Fund may not\n\nsolicit contributions beyond the limits on such solicitations contained in 2 U.S.C. § 441b(b)(4),\n\n\n\n                                                  38\n\fand the Leadership Fund also may not accept any contributions in excess of the limits contained\n\nin 2 U.S.C. §§ 441a(a)(1)(C) and 441a(a)(3).\n\n       B.      Irreparable Harm\n\n       The plaintiffs claim that they will suffer irreparable harm if the Leadership Fund is not\n\nallowed immediately to “solicit and accept unlimited contributions in order to conduct\n\nindependent expenditures.” Pls.’ Mem. at 33. This claim, however, is highly dubious in light of\n\nthe numerous alternative ways that the plaintiffs could engage in unlimited political speech.\n\nMost notably, the plaintiffs could form a Super PAC that paid its own administrative and\n\nsolicitation costs and could therefore solicit unlimited contributions from the general public to\n\nfinance unlimited independent expenditures. The plaintiffs respond to this option by arguing that\n\noperating a Super PAC would be burdensome. See Pls.’ Reply at 11–12 (citing MCFL, 479 U.S.\n\nat 254–55). The plaintiffs argue that the “additional requirements” of administering a Super\n\nPAC “‘may create a disincentive for [plaintiffs] to engage in political speech.’” Id. at 12\n\n(alteration in original) (quoting MCFL, 479 U.S. at 254). Yet, the plaintiffs do not say why the\n\norganizational, reporting, and record-keeping requirements of administering a Super PAC would\n\nbe any more burdensome than the (identical) organizational, reporting, and record-keeping\n\nrequirements of administering an SSF. It appears that what the Leadership Fund would really\n\nlike is to have its cake and eat it too—enjoy the benefits of an SSF (corporate subsidization of\n\nadministration and solicitation expenses) while also enjoying the benefits of a Super PAC\n\n(unlimited fundraising abilities). Choices have consequences, and requiring the plaintiffs to live\n\nwith the limitations of the entity they chose to establish (an SSF) entails no more of an injury\n\nthan requiring a “social welfare” organization to begin paying taxes if it chooses to operate its\n\nbusiness for profit. See 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(4).\n\n\n\n                                                  39\n\f       C.      Balance of Equities and Public Interest\n\n       For many of the same reasons already discussed, the balance of equities tips in favor of\n\nthe FEC rather than the plaintiffs. Granting the plaintiffs the relief they request would force the\n\nFEC to ignore the congressionally mandated limits on the fundraising activities of SSFs without\n\na sound constitutional basis for doing so. Also, though the plaintiffs may not be capable of\n\nraising the amount of funds they would be capable of raising as a Super PAC, that wound is self-\n\ninflicted. Furthermore, the plaintiffs do not seek a preservation of the status quo, but rather they\n\nseek fundamental change in how SSFs are regulated by the FEC, which would undoubtedly\n\nrequire new agency guidance and other burdens that are at least equal, if not far greater, than any\n\nburdens that would result from establishing a separate Super PAC to engage in the unlimited\n\nfundraising the plaintiffs desire. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, “‘[t]he presumption of\n\nconstitutionality which attaches to every Act of Congress is . . . an equity to be considered in\n\nfavor of [the government] in balancing hardships.’” Bowen v. Kendrick, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1304</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1304\n\n(1987) (Rehnquist, C.J., in chambers) (quoting Walters v. Nat’l Ass’n of Radiation Survivors,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111279\"><a href=\"/opinion/111279/harry-n-walters-administrator-of-veterans-affairs-v-national-association/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1323</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1324 (1984)). That equity is in full effect here.\n\n       The public interest would also not be served by granting the injunctive relief requested by\n\nthe plaintiffs. As discussed above, the provisions challenged by the plaintiffs serve important\n\ngovernmental interests intended to protect the integrity of the electoral process. Therefore,\n\nenjoining the enforcement of those provisions would palpably disserve the public interest, absent\n\na strong countervailing First Amendment reason for doing so.\n\nIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n       In sum, the plaintiffs have failed to satisfy any of the four preliminary injunction factors\n\nin connection with their First Amendment claims, and thus they have failed to state a plausible\n\n\n\n                                                 40\n\fclaim for relief. Therefore, for the reasons discussed above, the plaintiffs’ Motion for\n\nPreliminary Injunction, ECF No. 4, is DENIED. For the same reasons, the FEC’s Motion to\n\nDismiss, ECF No. 8, is GRANTED.\n\n       An appropriate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n\n\n\n       Date: November 5, 2012\n\n                                                      /s/ Beryl A.
