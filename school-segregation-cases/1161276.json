The panel held that given plaintiff’s pro se status,\nlimited English skills and disabilities, the district court erred\nby refusing to consider arguments that plaintiff raised for the\nfirst time in his objections to a magistrate judge’s findings\nand recommendations on defendants’ motion to dismiss. The\npanel also held that plaintiff had provided enough detail in his\nadministrative grievance to exhaust his Eighth Amendment\nclaim because the grievance gave notice that defendants had\nfailed to comply with plaintiff’s medical “chrono” requiring\nhim to be housed in a ground-floor cell. The panel held that\nthe complaint set forth sufficient facts to show that defendants\nwere deliberately indifferent when they failed to comply with\nthe medical chrono and that the district court erred by\ndismissing the complaint without explaining the deficiencies\nin the complaint and leave to amend and also without\nproviding plaintiff notice pursuant to Rand v.

In his complaint, Akhtar alleged that\nCorrectional Officer J. Mesa and Correctional Sergeant S.\nTurner (“Appellees”) violated his federal constitutional rights\nby failing to comply with his medical “chrono,”1 which\nrequired him to be housed in a ground floor cell.2 He also\nalleged that Appellees failed to provide him with an\ninterpreter at medical appointments. We must decide whether\n\n\n  1\n   A “chrono” is collection of informal notes taken by prison officials\ndocumenting medical orders.\n\n  2\n   Akhtar also sued Lieutenant L. W ard and Mule Creek State Prison.\nAkhtar’s claims against these defendants are not at issue on appeal.\n\n                                  3\n\f4                     AKHTAR V . MESA\n\nthe district court erred by (1) refusing to consider arguments\nthat Akhtar raised for the first time in his objections to a\nmagistrate judge’s findings and recommendations on\nAppellees’ motion to dismiss, (2) concluding that Akhtar\nfailed to exhaust his administrative remedies, and\n(3) dismissing his complaint on the ground that he failed to\nstate a claim upon which relief can be granted. After\nreviewing the record and relevant authority, we vacate the\njudgment and remand.\n\n                               I\n\n    Akhtar is a California prisoner incarcerated at Mule Creek\nState Prison. He suffers from numerous medical conditions,\nincluding chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease,\nuncontrolled hypertension, hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol),\ncerebrovascular accident (stroke), hyperuricemia (gout), and\ngastroesophageal reflux disease. Akhtar has “little English\nspeaking or reading skills, . . . has been deemed illiterate, . .\n. [and] has permanent brain damage from a motorcycle\naccident.” He is also mobility and hearing impaired.\n\n    On December 2, 2008, Akhtar was informed by Officer\nMesa that he was being moved to an emergency bunk (“E-\nbunk”) located in an open dormitory in the day room of the\nbuilding. He showed Officer Mesa and Sergeant Turner his\nmedical chrono and told them that he would rather go to\nAdministrative Segregation (“Ad-Seg”) than move to an E-\n\n\n\n\n                               4\n\f                        AKHTAR V . MESA                             5\n\nbunk. He was issued a CDC-1153 Rules Violation Report and\nplaced in Ad-Seg for refusing to move from his cell to an E-\nbunk in the dayroom of the prison.\n\n    On December 9, 2008, Akhtar received another CDC-115\nfor refusing to move to an E-bunk in the dayroom. Officer\nMesa and Sergeant Turner were not involved in that incident.\n\n    Akhtar was subsequently moved to a triple bunk E-bunk\nin the dayroom, at least 75 feet from the closest urinal.\nAkhtar fell from his bunk bed and broke his wrist. He also\nsuffered embarrassment and humiliation because, given that\nthere were only two toilets and one urinal for the forty beds in\nthe dayroom, he was often unable to reach the restroom in\ntime and urinated in his clothes.\n\n    Akhtar filed a grievance on January 1, 2009, in which he\nappealed the December 9, 2008 CDC-115 Rules Violation\nReport. In the grievance, Akhtar stated that prison staff were\ndeliberately indifferent to his well-being and that he was\ndenied due process because he did not receive an interpreter\nand staff assistant. Akhtar’s administrative grievance was\ndenied, as was his Second Level Appeal and Director’s Level\nAppeal.\n\n   Akhtar filed a second grievance on January 5, 2009, in\nwhich he appealed the December 2, 2008 CDC-115 Rules\nViolation Report. In that grievance, Akhtar stated that he\n\n\n 3\n   A CDC-115 Rules Violation Report is a disciplinary report issued by\nprison officials when a prisoner misbehaves.\n\n                                  5\n\f6                     AKHTAR V . MESA\n\n“was punished for protecting [his] rights.” Akhtar contended\nthat he was justified in refusing to move to the E-bunk\nbecause his chrono excluded him from “Dayroom and Gym\ndormitory bunk living.” Akhtar alleged that the corrections\nofficials were aware of his medical condition, but were\ndeliberately indifferent to it in ordering that he be transferred\nto an E-bunk. Akhtar also stated that his due process rights\nwere violated because he was not provided an interpreter or\nstaff assistant. Akhtar’s grievance was denied, as was his\nSecond Level Appeal and Director’s Level Appeal.\n\n    On October 1, 2009, Akhtar filed a complaint in the\ndistrict court against Officer Mesa and Sergeant Turner. In\nhis initial complaint, Akhtar stated a claim under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983 for deliberate indifference to his serious medical\nneeds, based on Appellees’s failure to comply with his\nmedical chrono regarding his housing needs. Akhtar attached\nthe January 1, 2009, and the January 5, 2009 grievances as\nexhibits to his complaint, along with copies of the Second\nLevel Appeals and Director’s Level Decisions. Magistrate\nJudge Gregory G. Hollows dismissed Akhtar’s initial\ncomplaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(b), with leave to\namend. Thereafter, Akhtar filed his first amended complaint.\nIn that complaint, Akhtar re-alleged a deliberate indifference\nclaim pursuant to the Eighth Amendment based on Appellees’\nfailure to comply with his medical chrono regarding housing.\nHe also alleged two new claims for deliberate indifference to\na serious medical need based on the failure to provide an\ninterpreter at medical appointments, and a requirement that he\npay a $350 filing fee.\n\n\n\n                               6\n\f                      AKHTAR V . MESA                          7\n\n    Akhtar attached several documents as exhibits to his first\namended complaint. They included medical records, a\nComprehensive Accommodation Chrono, a Disability\nPlacement Program Verification form, and a February 11,\n2010 Second Level Appeal Response regarding his request for\nan interpreter at medical appointments and institutional\nhearings. Akhtar did not attach to his first amended\ncomplaint copies of his January 1 and 5, 2009 grievances and\nhis administrative appeals.\n\n    Magistrate Judge Hollows issued a screening order,\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(a), in which he stated that\nAkhtar had filed “a cognizable claim for relief pursuant to\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(b) against the\nindividual appellees. If the allegations of the amended\ncomplaint are proven, plaintiff has a reasonable opportunity\nto prevail on the merits of this action.”\n\n     Appellees filed a motion to dismiss the first amended\ncomplaint for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies\nor to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\nMagistrate Judge Hollows advised Akhtar that the failure to\nfile a written opposition or to file a statement of no opposition\nmay be deemed a waiver of any opposition to the motion\npursuant to Local Rule 230(1). Akhtar did not file an\nopposition to the motion. Magistrate Judge Hollows\nconcluded that Akhtar’s failure to file an opposition “should\nbe deemed a waiver of opposition to granting the motion.” In\nhis findings and recommendations, he also determined that\nAkhtar had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and\nfailed to state a claim under the Eighth Amendment.\n\n\n                               7\n\f8                         AKHTAR V . MESA\n\n    Akhtar filed an objection to Magistrate Judge Hollows’s\nfindings and recommendations. He asked that the district\ncourt construe his objection to the findings and\nrecommendations as an opposition to Appellees’ motion to\ndismiss. Akhtar attached copies of the January 1 and January\n5, 2009 grievances, and related administrative appeals, to his\nobjection to the findings and recommendations. The district\ncourt issued an order declining to consider Akhtar’s\nobjections to the motion to dismiss his first amended\ncomplaint. It adopted Magistrate Judge Hollows’s findings\nand his recommendations; dismissed the first amended\ncomplaint with prejudice; and entered judgment in favor of\nAppellees.\n\n    On May 5, 2011, Akhtar filed a motion to alter or amend\nthe judgment which the district court denied. Akhtar filed a\ntimely notice of appeal. The district court had jurisdiction\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1331. We have jurisdiction pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. § 1291.4\n\n\n\n\n    4\n     Because the other defendants named in the first amended complaint\nwere not served with process, the district court’s order dismissing Akhtar’s\nfirst amended complaint as to Officer Mesa and Sergeant Turner “may be\nconsidered final under Section 1291 for the purpose of perfecting an\nappeal.” Patchick v. Kensington Publ’g Corp., 743 F.2d 675, 677 (9th\nCir. 1984) (per curiam).\n\n                                     8\n\f                       AKHTAR V . MESA                          9\n\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\n    Akhtar contends that the district court abused its\ndiscretion in refusing to consider the arguments that he raised\nin his objections to Magistrate Judge Hollows’s findings and\nrecommendations. He also maintains that, even if the district\ncourt had “actually exercised its discretion,” it abused that\ndiscretion by failing to consider his arguments. We review\nthis issue for abuse of discretion. Brown v. Roe, 279 F.3d\n742, 744 (9th Cir. 2002).\n\n    In United States v. Howell, 231 F.3d 615, 621 (9th Cir.\n2000), we joined the First and Fifth Circuits in holding “that\na district court has discretion, but is not required, to consider\nevidence presented for the first time in a party’s objection to\na magistrate judge’s recommendation.” We cautioned,\nhowever, that “in making a decision on whether to consider\nnewly offered evidence, the district court must actually\nexercise its discretion, rather than summarily accepting or\ndenying the motion.” Id. at 622.\n\n    In Brown, applying Howell, we concluded that the district\ncourt had failed to “actually exercise[] its discretion,” as there\nwas nothing in the record that showed that it had. Brown,\n279 F.3d at 745 (citing Howell, 231 F.3d at 622). We stated\nthat there was “nothing in the record that shows the district\ncourt ‘actually exercise[d] its discretion,’ in refusing to\nconsider Brown’s newly-raised claim.” Id. (alteration in\noriginal) (quoting Howell, 231 F.3d at 622). We also\n\n\n                                9\n\f10                    AKHTAR V . MESA\n\nexplained that, given that the plaintiff was pro se and had\npresented a “relatively novel claim under a relatively new\nstatute . . . . , even if the district court had ‘exercised its\ndiscretion,’ it would have been an abuse of that discretion to\nrefuse to consider petitioner Brown’s equitable tolling claim.”\nId.\n\n    Two years later, in Jones v. Blanas, 393 F.3d 918 (9th Cir.\n2004), we again held that a district court abused its discretion\nby failing to consider arguments raised for the first time in a\npro se plaintiff’s objections to a magistrate judge’s findings.\nOnce again, we concluded that the district court did not\n“actually exercise its discretion.” Id. at 935 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). We also explained that, “given the\ncircumstances under which this evidence was offered–a pro\nse plaintiff, ignorant of the law, offering crucial facts as soon\nas he understood what was necessary to prevent summary\njudgment against him–it would have been an abuse of\ndiscretion for the district court not to consider the evidence.”\nId.\n\n    Akhtar contends that as in Brown and Jones, the record in\nthis case does not show that the court actually exercised its\ndiscretion in considering his objections to Magistrate Judge\nHollows’s findings and recommendations. We disagree.\nAlthough the district court’s order is brief, it stated correctly\nthat, pursuant to Howell, “[a] district court has the discretion,\nbut is not required, to consider evidence presented for the first\ntime in a party’s objection to a magistrate judge’s\nrecommendation.” The district court noted that Akhtar did\nnot explain in his objections why he failed to file a timely\n\n\n                               10\n\f                       AKHTAR V . MESA                          11\n\nopposition to Appellees’ motion to dismiss. The court\n“elect[ed] to exercise its discretion not to consider an\nopposition to a motion to dismiss inappropriately presented\nby plaintiff for the first time in objections.” Id.\n\n    Akhtar asserts that, even if the district court “actually\nexercised its discretion,” it abused it because, like the plaintiff\nin Brown, he is proceeding pro se. In Brown and Jones, we\nemphasized that the failure to consider a plaintiff’s status as\na pro se litigant is a ground for concluding that the district\ncourt abused its discretion. Jones, 393 F.3d at 935; Brown,\n279 F.3d at 745. Given that Akhtar’s objections directed the\ncourt to crucial facts showing he may have exhausted his\nadministrative remedies and that he is a pro se litigant, who\nis illiterate, disabled, and has limited English skills, the\ndistrict court abused its discretion by failing to consider these\ncircumstances.\n\n    Moreover, the critical documents, the January grievances\nand resulting decisions, had been attached to the original\ncomplaint. Under recent case law, that complaint was not\nentirely superseded when the amended complaint was filed,\nand so could have been considered by the magistrate judge in\nconsidering exhaustion. See Lacey v. Maricopa Cnty., – F.3d\n–, 2012 WL 3711591, at *18, *21 (9th Cir. 2012 Aug. 29,\n2012) (en banc) (holding that an amended complaint does not\nsupersede an earlier complaint so as to require a party to\nreplead claims dismissed with prejudice and without leave to\namend to preserve those claims for appeal).\n\n\n\n\n                                11\n\f12                    AKHTAR V . MESA\n\n    Further, if there is any doubt whether the documents\nattached to the original complaint were still part of the\noperative pleadings, the magistrate judge also could have\nconsidered the documents as part of the record in considering\nAppellees’ motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust\nadministrative remedies. In deciding such a motion–which is\nconsidered an unenumerated Rule 12(b) motion – “the court\nmay look beyond the pleadings.” Wyatt v. Terhune, 315 F.3d\n1108, 1119 (9th Cir. 2003). That the information in question\nwas not actually new to the case is another reason the district\ncourt abused its discretion in failing to consider it.\n\n                               B\n\n     Akhtar next contends that the district court erred because\nit concluded that he failed to exhaust his administrative\nremedies. Akhtar contends that he satisfied the administrative\nexhaustion requirement of the Prison Litigation Reform Act\n(“PLRA”) of 1995 before filing his initial complaint and his\nfirst amended complaint. We review a dismissal for failure to\nexhaust de novo and factual findings for clear error. O’Guinn\nv. Lovelock Corr. Ctr., 502 F.3d 1056, 1059 (9th Cir. 2007).\n\n                               1\n\n    As an initial matter, Appellees contend that we should\nignore Akhtar’s arguments on appeal because he waived them\nby failing to file a timely opposition to the motion to dismiss.\nAppellees’ reliance on Bolker v. Commissioner, 760 F.2d\n1039 (9th Cir. 1985), to support this contention is misplaced.\nBolker stands for the proposition that, “[a]s a general rule, we\n\n\n                              12\n\f                      AKHTAR V . MESA                        13\n\nwill not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal,\nalthough we have the power to do so.” Id. at 1042 (citation\nomitted). Bolker does not require us to ignore Akhtar’s\ncontentions because he failed to file a timely opposition to a\nmotion to dismiss in the district court.\n\n    Indeed, the Bolker rule presumes that the issue was not\nraised in the district court. In this case, Akhtar presented his\nobjections to Magistrate Judge Hollows’s findings and\nrecommendations in the district court, as well as in the motion\nto alter or amend the judgment. In fact, the district court\naddressed the issues that Akhtar raises in this appeal in its\norder denying his motion to alter or amend the judgment.\nAppellees have not cited any portion of Bolker, or any other\ncase, that suggests we should ignore Akhtar’s contentions\nbecause he failed to assert them in a motion opposing\nMagistrate Judge Hollows’s recommendation that his\ncomplaint be dismissed.\n\n                               2\n\n    With respect to exhaustion, “we have held that the failure\nto exhaust nonjudicial remedies that are not jurisdictional\nshould be treated as a matter in abatement, which is subject to\nan unenumerated Rule 12(b) motion.” Wyatt v. Terhune,\n315 F.3d 1108, 1119 (9th Cir. 2003). Exhaustion under the\nPLRA is not jurisdictional. Payne v. Peninsula Sch. Dist.,\n653 F.3d 863, 869 (9th Cir. 2011), cert. denied, 132 S. Ct.\n1540 (2012). Thus, a defendant may raise failure to exhaust\nunder the PLRA in an unenumerated Rule 12(b) motion. See\nWyatt, 315 F.3d at 1119-20 (“In deciding [such] a motion . .\n\n\n                              13\n\f14                    AKHTAR V . MESA\n\n. , the court may look beyond the pleadings and decide\ndisputed issues of fact.”).\n\n    “The [PLRA] requires that a prisoner exhaust available\nadministrative remedies before bringing a federal action\nconcerning prison conditions.” Griffin v. Arpaio, 557 F.3d\n1117, 1119 (9th Cir. 2009) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a)\n(2008)). “‘[A]n action is ‘brought’ for purposes of\n[exhaustion under] § 1997e(a) when the complaint is tendered\nto the district clerk,’ and not when it is subsequently filed.”\nVaden v. Summerhill, 449 F.3d 1047, 1050 (9th Cir. 2006)\n(quoting Ford v. Johnson, 362 F.3d 395, 400 (7th Cir. 2004)).\n\n    The failure to exhaust administrative remedies is an\naffirmative defense on which the defendant bears the burden\nof proof. Wyatt, 315 F.3d at 1119. Because “there can be no\nabsence of exhaustion unless some relief remains available, a\ndefendant must demonstrate that pertinent relief remain[s]\navailable, whether at unexhausted levels of the grievance\nprocess or through awaiting the results of the relief already\ngranted as a result of that process.” Brown v.

Robinson,\n621 F.3d 1002, 1007 (9th Cir. 2010).\n\n    Akhtar’s first amended complaint asserts two deliberate\nindifference claims, both of which required exhaustion under\nthe PLRA. These claims rest on Appellees’ (1) failure to\ncomply with Akhtar’s medical chrono regarding housing and\n(2) failure to provide an interpreter at medical appointments.\nWe address, in turn, the question whether each claim was\nexhausted.\n\n                              i\n\n    Akhtar asserted his claim for failure to comply with his\nmedical chrono regarding housing in his initial complaint.\nNeither party disputes that this claim arose before Akhtar\nfiled that complaint. Thus, Akhtar was required to exhaust\nthis claim before he filed his initial complaint. See\nMcKinney, 311 F.3d at 1200-01 (requiring pre-suit exhaustion\nunder the PLRA).\n\n     Akhtar contends that the evidence attached to his initial\ncomplaint and objections to Magistrate Judge Hollows’s\nfindings and recommendations shows that he exhausted his\nmedical deliberate indifference claim. Akhtar attached the\nJanuary 1 and 5, 2009 grievances, along with the related\nSecond Level Appeals and Director’s Level Decisions, to his\ninitial complaint and objections.\n\n\n\n\n                             15\n\f16                   AKHTAR V . MESA\n\n    The documents attached to Akhtar’s objection to\nMagistrate Judge Hollows’s findings and recommendations,\nas well as the allegations and attachments to his initial\ncomplaint, show that he exhausted his medical deliberate\nindifference claims in May 2009, several months before he\nfiled his initial complaint. In his January 5, 2009 grievance,\nAkhtar appealed the CDC-115 Rules Violation Report that he\nreceived for refusing to move to an E-bunk on December 2,\n2008. In that grievance, Akhtar stated that he “was punished\nfor protecting [his] rights.” According to Akhtar, he was\njustified in refusing to move to the E-bunk because his chrono\nexcluded him from “Dayroom and Gym dormitory bunk\nliving.” Akhtar suggesed that the corrections officials were\naware of his medical condition, but were deliberately\nindifferent to that condition by attempting to transfer him to\nan E-bunk. Akhtar also stated that his due process rights were\nviolated because he did not receive an interpreter or staff\nassistant.\n\n     Akhtar appealed the denial of this grievance. He received\na Second Level Appeal denying his claim on February 26,\n2009. He received a Director’s Level Decision, denying his\nclaim on May 28, 2009. The Director’s Level Decision\nshowed that the prison was aware that Akhtar contended that\nthe move to an E-bunk violated his medical chrono because\nit construed his medical chrono as not precluding E-bunk\nhousing. Specifically, the Director’s Level Decision stated\nthat “the appellant’s medical chronos limit him to lower\ntier/lower bunk housing. The appellant was ordered to move\nto a lower bunk bed; therefore, he was not precluded from\nobeying the order.”\n\n\n                             16\n\f                      AKHTAR V . MESA                        17\n\n    Appellees contend that the January 5, 2009 grievance\naddressed only Akhtar’s due process claim. We disagree.\n“The level of detail necessary in a grievance to comply with\nthe grievance procedures will vary from system to system and\nclaim to claim, but it is the prison’s requirements, and not the\nPLRA, that define the boundaries of proper exhaustion.”\nJones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 218 (2007). For prisons, like\nMule Creek State Prison, that do not instruct prisoners on\nwhat precise facts must be alleged in a grievance, “‘a\ngrievance suffices if it alerts the prison to the nature of the\nwrong for which redress is sought.’” Griffin, 557 F.3d at\n1120 (quoting Strong v. David, 297 F.3d 646, 650 (7th Cir.\n2002)). Akhtar’s January 5, 2009 grievance provided enough\ndetail to exhaust his Eighth Amendment claim because it\nprovided notice that Appellees had failed to comply with\nAkhtar’s medical chrono requiring him to be housed in a\nground-floor cell.\n\n    Appellees also contend that Magistrate Judge Hollows\n“screened out” Akhtar’s claims based on the January 5, 2009\ngrievance. This contention is misleading. In his screening\norder on the initial complaint, Magistrate Judge Hollows\ndismissed with leave to amend, any due process challenges to\nthe hearings on Akhtar’s CDC-115s. Akhtar, however, is not\nchallenging the dismissal of his due process challenges to his\nCDC-115s. Rather, he is challenging the dismissal of his\nEighth Amendment deliberate indifference claim. Appellees\nhave not shown that Magistrate Judge Hollows “screened out”\nthis claim.\n\n\n\n\n                              17\n\f18                        AKHTAR V . MESA\n\n    Appellees’ attempt to focus on Akhtar’s August 7, 2009\ngrievance regarding housing as evidence that he failed timely\nto exhaust this claim is not persuasive. Appellees maintain\nthat Akhtar’s claim fails because he did not receive a\nDirector’s Level Review on this grievance until November 2,\n2009, one month after Akhtar filed his first amended\ncomplaint. While Akhtar’s August 7, 2009 grievance did\naddress his deliberate indifference claim based on housing, he\ndid not need to receive a Director’s Level Decision on that\ngrievance before filing his first amended complaint because,\nas discussed above, he had already exhausted that claim.\nThus, Akhtar’s subsequent post-suit exhaustion of the August\n7, 2009 grievance is immaterial.\n\n    Because Akhtar received a Director’s Level Decision on\nhis January 5, 2009 grievance before he filed his initial\ncomplaint in which he alleged his deliberate indifference\nclaim based on housing, he exhausted this claim.5 Thus, the\ndistrict court erred by dismissing this claim for failure to\nexhaust.\n\n                                    ii\n\n   Appellees did not challenge Akhtar’s claim that he was\ndeprived of an interpreter in their motion to dismiss the first\n\n\n 5\n    Akhtar also contends that his January 1, 2009 grievance exhausted his\nadministrative remedies. That grievance, however, did not provide notice\nof his contention that Appellees ignored his medical chrono. In addition,\nit related to the December 9, 2008 incident, which did not involve Officer\nMesa or Sergeant Turner.\n\n                                   18\n\f                      AKHTAR V .

Thus,\nthe district court erred by dismissing this claim for failure to\nexhaust.\n\n                               C\n\n    Akhtar further contends that the district court erred by\ndismissing his first amended complaint on the alternative\nground of failure to state a claim. He argues that the court\noverlooked the allegations in his pleading supporting his\nclaim and did not explain the basis for its decision. We\nreview this issue de novo. Hebbe v. Pliler, 627 F.3d 338,\n341 (9th Cir. 2010).\n\n    “To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain\nsufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to\nrelief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal,\n556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v.\nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). When reviewing a\nmotion to dismiss, we “consider only allegations contained in\nthe pleadings, exhibits attached to the complaint, and matters\nproperly subject to judicial notice.” Swartz v. KPMG LLP,\n476 F.3d 756, 763 (9th Cir. 2007) (per curiam).\n\n    “[W]e have an obligation where the petitioner is pro se,\nparticularly in civil rights cases, to construe the pleadings\nliberally and to afford the petitioner the benefit of any doubt.”\nBretz v.

In fact, “before dismissing a pro se complaint the\ndistrict court must provide the litigant with notice of the\ndeficiencies in his complaint in order to ensure that the\nlitigant uses the opportunity to amend effectively.” Ferdik v.\nBonzelet, 963 F.2d 1258, 1261 (9th Cir. 1992) (citing Noll v.\nCarlson, 809 F.2d 1446, 1448-49 (9th Cir. 1987), superseded\non other grounds by statute as stated in Lopez v. Smith,\n203 F.3d 1122 (9th Cir. 2000)) (en banc). A district court\nshould not dismiss a pro se complaint without leave to amend\nunless “it is absolutely clear that the deficiencies of the\ncomplaint could not be cured by amendment.” Schucker v.\nRockwood, 846 F.2d 1202, 1203-04 (9th Cir. 1988) (per\ncuriam) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n     In ruling on Appellees’ motion to dismiss for failure to\nstate a claim, neither the district court nor Magistrate Judge\nHollows explained the deficiencies in Akhtar’s first amended\ncomplaint. Rather, the district court adopted Magistrate\nJudge Hollows’s findings and recommendations, which\ncontained only the following brief parenthetical footnoted\nconclusion on this issue: “this court . . . finds this action\nshould be dismissed on ground 1 (as well as on ground 2 for\nfailing to state a claim under the Eighth Amendment).”\n\n    The district court did not comply with our precedent\nregarding the dismissal of pro se prisoner civil rights\ncomplaints for failure to state a claim. The defects are of\nparticular significance given that the grounds for dismissal\nwere not readily apparent. To comply with the law of this\ncircuit, the district court was required to explain the\ndeficiencies in Akhtar’s first amended complaint. It also\n\n\n                             20\n\f                          AKHTAR V .

The district court did neither.\n\n    In their motion to dismiss the first amended complaint,\nAppellees argued that Akhtar’s deliberate indifference claim\nfailed because they “did not subject Akhtar to any serious\nmedical risk, never intended to harm Akhtar, and in fact\nAkhtar was not harmed.”6 On appeal, Appellees focus on\nAkhtar’s alleged failure to show “a causal relationship\nbetween Appellees and any supposed violation of his\nconstitutional rights.”\n\n    In Jett v. Penner, 439 F.3d 1091 (9th Cir. 2006), we held\nthat there is a two-pronged test for evaluating a claim for\ndeliberate indifference to a serious medical need:\n\n       First, the plaintiff must show a serious medical need\n       by demonstrating that failure to treat a prisoner’s\n       condition could result in further significant injury or\n       the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.\n       Second, the plaintiff must show the defendant’s\n       response to the need was deliberately indifferent.\n       This second prong . . . is satisfied by showing (a) a\n       purposeful act or failure to respond to a prisoner’s\n\n\n\n   6\n     In their motion to dismiss, Defendants did not challenge, on the\ngrounds of failure to state a claim, Akhtar’s deliberate indifference claim\nbased on failure to provide an interpreter or his non-specific claim\nregarding the $350 filing fee.\n\n                                    21\n\f22                    AKHTAR V . MESA\n\n     pain or possible medical need and (b) harm caused by\n     the indifference.\n\nId. at 1096 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n    Akhtar’s first amended complaint set forth sufficient facts\nto show that he had a serious medical need. Akhtar alleged\nthat he suffered from numerous medical conditions and was\nhearing and mobility impaired. Akhtar also attached a\nComprehensive Accommodation Chrono dated October 9,\n2008 and disability verification form dated August 23, 2006,\nas exhibits to his first amended complaint. The Chrono stated\nthat Akhtar required a “bottom bunk” and “ground floor cell.”\nThe disability verification form stated that Akhtar is “mobility\nimpaired” and had housing restrictions requiring a “lower\nbunk,” “no stairs,” and “no triple bunk.” These allegations\nand exhibits are sufficient to show that Akhtar has a serious\nmedical need.\n\n    Contrary to Appellees’ contention, the medical records\nattached to the first amended complaint do not contradict\nAkhtar’s allegation that he has a serious medical need. The\nfact that the records show that a doctor concluded, at a certain\npoint in time, that Akhtar’s kidney function was stable does\nnot contradict Akhtar’s allegation that he suffered from\nnumerous other medical conditions.\n\n    Akhtar’s first amended complaint also set forth sufficient\nfacts to show that Appellees were deliberately indifferent.\nAkhtar alleged that he showed his medical chrono requiring\na lower bunk in a ground-floor cell to Officer Mesa and\n\n\n                              22\n\f                          AKHTAR V .

He also alleged that they ignored the\nmedical chrono by moving him to an E-bunk in the dayroom.\n\n    Akhtar also alleged that he was harmed as a result of\nAppellees’ failure to comply with his chrono. He alleged that\nhe suffered a broken wrist. He also suffered humiliation and\nembarrassment on several occasions because he urinated in\nhis clothes.\n\n    Contrary to Appellees’ contentions, the fact that Akhtar’s\nmedical records attached to the first amended complaint do\nnot show that he suffered any adverse medical conditions as\na result of the move to the E-bunk does not contradict\nAkhtar’s allegations of harm. The absence of any mention of\nharm as a result of the move to the E-bunk fails to establish\nthat Akhtar did not suffer harm. His allegations of deliberate\nindifference to his medical condition were sufficient to satisfy\nthe pleading requirement. To the extent Appellees contest\nAkhtar’s ability to prove harm, that is an issue for summary\njudgment or trial, not a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.\n\n    Because Akhtar’s first amended complaint stated a claim\nupon which relief can be granted and neither Magistrate Judge\nHollows nor the district court provided a statement of the\ndeficiencies before dismissing the first amended complaint\nwith prejudice, the district court erred in granting the motion\nto dismiss.7\n\n\n 7\n   Nothing in this opinion should be construed as limiting Akhtar’s ability\nto seek leave to amend his first amended complaint if he so chooses to do\nso upon remand.\n\n                                   23\n\f24                     AKHTAR V .

Carey,\n684 F.3d 934 (9th Cir. 2012), to support his contention that he\nwas not provided with Rand notice at the time Appellees filed\ntheir motion to dismiss. Rand notice requires that a pro se\nlitigant be provided with fair notice of the requirements for\nopposing a motion for summary judgment. Rand v. Rowland,\n154 F.3d 952, 960-61 (9th Cir. 1998) (en banc). In Wyatt,\n315 F.3d at 1120 n.14, we extended Rand to motions to\ndismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\n\n    In Woods, we held that the “notice required under [Rand]\nand [Wyatt] must be provided to pro se prisoner plaintiffs at\nthe time the [Appellees’] motions are filed.” Woods, 684 F.3d\nat 936. “The failure to provide adequate Rand notice is a\nground for reversal unless it is clear from the record that there\nare no facts that would permit the inmate to prevail.” Id. at\n941.\n\n    Recently, in Stratton v.

Here, the district court granted\nAppellees’ motion to dismiss in part for failure to exhaust his\nadministrative remedies. Akhtar was not provided with Rand\nnotice at the time after Appellees filed their motion to\ndismiss. In addition, the record shows that Akhtar would\nlikely prevail on the merits of his claims if a trier of fact is\npersuaded by his evidence. Thus, the district court also erred\nin failing to provide Akhtar with the notice pursuant to Rand.\n\n                      CONCLUSION\n\n    For the foregoing reasons, we are persuaded that the\ndistrict court erred in granting Appellees’ motion to dismiss\nthe first amended complaint.\n\n   VACATED AND REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n                              25\n\f",

The\npanel also held that plaintiff had provided enough detail in his\nadministrative grievance to exhaust his Eighth Amendment\nclaim because the grievance gave notice that defendants had\nfailed to comply with plaintiff’s medical “chrono” requiring\nhim to be housed in a ground-floor cell. The panel held that\nthe complaint set forth sufficient facts to show that defendants\nwere deliberately indifferent when they failed to comply with\nthe medical chrono and that the district court erred by\ndismissing the complaint without explaining the deficiencies\nin the complaint and leave to amend and also without\nproviding plaintiff notice pursuant to Rand v.

In his complaint, Akhtar alleged that\nCorrectional Officer J. Mesa and Correctional Sergeant S.\nTurner (“Appellees”) violated his federal constitutional rights\nby failing to comply with his medical “chrono,”1 which\nrequired him to be housed in a ground floor cell.2 He also\nalleged that Appellees failed to provide him with an\ninterpreter at medical appointments.

After\nreviewing the record and relevant authority, we vacate the\njudgment and remand.\n\n                               I\n\n    Akhtar is a California prisoner incarcerated at Mule Creek\nState Prison.

Akhtar has “little English\nspeaking or reading skills, . . . has been deemed illiterate, . .\n. [and] has permanent brain damage from a motorcycle\naccident.” He is also mobility and hearing impaired.\n\n    On December 2, 2008, Akhtar was informed by Officer\nMesa that he was being moved to an emergency bunk (“E-\nbunk”) located in an open dormitory in the day room of the\nbuilding. He showed Officer Mesa and Sergeant Turner his\nmedical chrono and told them that he would rather go to\nAdministrative Segregation (“Ad-Seg”) than move to an E-\n\n\n\n\n                               4\n\f                        AKHTAR V .

Officer\nMesa and Sergeant Turner were not involved in that incident.\n\n    Akhtar was subsequently moved to a triple bunk E-bunk\nin the dayroom, at least 75 feet from the closest urinal.\nAkhtar fell from his bunk bed and broke his wrist. He also\nsuffered embarrassment and humiliation because, given that\nthere were only two toilets and one urinal for the forty beds in\nthe dayroom, he was often unable to reach the restroom in\ntime and urinated in his clothes.\n\n    Akhtar filed a grievance on January 1, 2009, in which he\nappealed the December 9, 2008 CDC-115 Rules Violation\nReport. In the grievance, Akhtar stated that prison staff were\ndeliberately indifferent to his well-being and that he was\ndenied due process because he did not receive an interpreter\nand staff assistant. Akhtar’s administrative grievance was\ndenied, as was his Second Level Appeal and Director’s Level\nAppeal.\n\n   Akhtar filed a second grievance on January 5, 2009, in\nwhich he appealed the December 2, 2008 CDC-115 Rules\nViolation Report. In that grievance, Akhtar stated that he\n\n\n 3\n   A CDC-115 Rules Violation Report is a disciplinary report issued by\nprison officials when a prisoner misbehaves.\n\n                                  5\n\f6                     AKHTAR V . MESA\n\n“was punished for protecting [his] rights.” Akhtar contended\nthat he was justified in refusing to move to the E-bunk\nbecause his chrono excluded him from “Dayroom and Gym\ndormitory bunk living.” Akhtar alleged that the corrections\nofficials were aware of his medical condition, but were\ndeliberately indifferent to it in ordering that he be transferred\nto an E-bunk. Akhtar also stated that his due process rights\nwere violated because he was not provided an interpreter or\nstaff assistant. Akhtar’s grievance was denied, as was his\nSecond Level Appeal and Director’s Level Appeal.\n\n    On October 1, 2009, Akhtar filed a complaint in the\ndistrict court against Officer Mesa and Sergeant Turner. In\nhis initial complaint, Akhtar stated a claim under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983 for deliberate indifference to his serious medical\nneeds, based on Appellees’s failure to comply with his\nmedical chrono regarding his housing needs. Akhtar attached\nthe January 1, 2009, and the January 5, 2009 grievances as\nexhibits to his complaint, along with copies of the Second\nLevel Appeals and Director’s Level Decisions. Magistrate\nJudge Gregory G. Hollows dismissed Akhtar’s initial\ncomplaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(b), with leave to\namend. Thereafter, Akhtar filed his first amended complaint.\nIn that complaint, Akhtar re-alleged a deliberate indifference\nclaim pursuant to the Eighth Amendment based on Appellees’\nfailure to comply with his medical chrono regarding housing.\nHe also alleged two new claims for deliberate indifference to\na serious medical need based on the failure to provide an\ninterpreter at medical appointments, and a requirement that he\npay a $350 filing fee.\n\n\n\n                               6\n\f                      AKHTAR V . MESA                          7\n\n    Akhtar attached several documents as exhibits to his first\namended complaint. They included medical records, a\nComprehensive Accommodation Chrono, a Disability\nPlacement Program Verification form, and a February 11,\n2010 Second Level Appeal Response regarding his request for\nan interpreter at medical appointments and institutional\nhearings. Akhtar did not attach to his first amended\ncomplaint copies of his January 1 and 5, 2009 grievances and\nhis administrative appeals.\n\n    Magistrate Judge Hollows issued a screening order,\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(a), in which he stated that\nAkhtar had filed “a cognizable claim for relief pursuant to\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(b) against the\nindividual appellees. If the allegations of the amended\ncomplaint are proven, plaintiff has a reasonable opportunity\nto prevail on the merits of this action.”\n\n     Appellees filed a motion to dismiss the first amended\ncomplaint for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies\nor to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\nMagistrate Judge Hollows advised Akhtar that the failure to\nfile a written opposition or to file a statement of no opposition\nmay be deemed a waiver of any opposition to the motion\npursuant to Local Rule 230(1). Akhtar did not file an\nopposition to the motion. Magistrate Judge Hollows\nconcluded that Akhtar’s failure to file an opposition “should\nbe deemed a waiver of opposition to granting the motion.” In\nhis findings and recommendations, he also determined that\nAkhtar had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and\nfailed to state a claim under the Eighth Amendment.\n\n\n                               7\n\f8                         AKHTAR V . MESA\n\n    Akhtar filed an objection to Magistrate Judge Hollows’s\nfindings and recommendations. He asked that the district\ncourt construe his objection to the findings and\nrecommendations as an opposition to Appellees’ motion to\ndismiss. Akhtar attached copies of the January 1 and January\n5, 2009 grievances, and related administrative appeals, to his\nobjection to the findings and recommendations. The district\ncourt issued an order declining to consider Akhtar’s\nobjections to the motion to dismiss his first amended\ncomplaint. It adopted Magistrate Judge Hollows’s findings\nand his recommendations; dismissed the first amended\ncomplaint with prejudice; and entered judgment in favor of\nAppellees.\n\n    On May 5, 2011, Akhtar filed a motion to alter or amend\nthe judgment which the district court denied. Akhtar filed a\ntimely notice of appeal. The district court had jurisdiction\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1331. We have jurisdiction pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. § 1291.4\n\n\n\n\n    4\n     Because the other defendants named in the first amended complaint\nwere not served with process, the district court’s order dismissing Akhtar’s\nfirst amended complaint as to Officer Mesa and Sergeant Turner “may be\nconsidered final under Section 1291 for the purpose of perfecting an\nappeal.” Patchick v.

Brown,\n279 F.3d at 745 (citing Howell, 231 F.3d at 622).

We also explained that, “given the\ncircumstances under which this evidence was offered–a pro\nse plaintiff, ignorant of the law, offering crucial facts as soon\nas he understood what was necessary to prevent summary\njudgment against him–it would have been an abuse of\ndiscretion for the district court not to consider the evidence.”\nId.\n\n    Akhtar contends that as in Brown and Jones, the record in\nthis case does not show that the court actually exercised its\ndiscretion in considering his objections to Magistrate Judge\nHollows’s findings and recommendations. We disagree.\nAlthough the district court’s order is brief, it stated correctly\nthat, pursuant to Howell, “[a] district court has the discretion,\nbut is not required, to consider evidence presented for the first\ntime in a party’s objection to a magistrate judge’s\nrecommendation.” The district court noted that Akhtar did\nnot explain in his objections why he failed to file a timely\n\n\n                               10\n\f                       AKHTAR V .

In Brown and Jones, we\nemphasized that the failure to consider a plaintiff’s status as\na pro se litigant is a ground for concluding that the district\ncourt abused its discretion. Jones, 393 F.3d at 935; Brown,\n279 F.3d at 745. Given that Akhtar’s objections directed the\ncourt to crucial facts showing he may have exhausted his\nadministrative remedies and that he is a pro se litigant, who\nis illiterate, disabled, and has limited English skills, the\ndistrict court abused its discretion by failing to consider these\ncircumstances.\n\n    Moreover, the critical documents, the January grievances\nand resulting decisions, had been attached to the original\ncomplaint. Under recent case law, that complaint was not\nentirely superseded when the amended complaint was filed,\nand so could have been considered by the magistrate judge in\nconsidering exhaustion.

Akhtar contends that he satisfied the administrative\nexhaustion requirement of the Prison Litigation Reform Act\n(“PLRA”) of 1995 before filing his initial complaint and his\nfirst amended complaint.

Commissioner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"451622\"><a href=\"/opinion/451622/joseph-r-bolker-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">760</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1039</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 1985), to support this contention is misplaced.\nBolker stands for the proposition that, “[a]s a general rule, we\n\n\n                              12\n\f                      AKHTAR V .

Bolker does not require us to ignore Akhtar’s\ncontentions because he failed to file a timely opposition to a\nmotion to dismiss in the district court.\n\n    Indeed, the Bolker rule presumes that the issue was not\nraised in the district court. In this case, Akhtar presented his\nobjections to Magistrate Judge Hollows’s findings and\nrecommendations in the district court, as well as in the motion\nto alter or amend the judgment. In fact, the district court\naddressed the issues that Akhtar raises in this appeal in its\norder denying his motion to alter or amend the judgment.\nAppellees have not cited any portion of Bolker, or any other\ncase, that suggests we should ignore Akhtar’s contentions\nbecause he failed to assert them in a motion opposing\nMagistrate Judge Hollows’s recommendation that his\ncomplaint be dismissed.\n\n                               2\n\n    With respect to exhaustion, “we have held that the failure\nto exhaust nonjudicial remedies that are not jurisdictional\nshould be treated as a matter in abatement, which is subject to\nan unenumerated Rule 12(b) motion.” Wyatt v.

These claims rest on Appellees’ (1) failure to\ncomply with Akhtar’s medical chrono regarding housing and\n(2) failure to provide an interpreter at medical appointments.\nWe address, in turn, the question whether each claim was\nexhausted.\n\n                              i\n\n    Akhtar asserted his claim for failure to comply with his\nmedical chrono regarding housing in his initial complaint.\nNeither party disputes that this claim arose before Akhtar\nfiled that complaint. Thus, Akhtar was required to exhaust\nthis claim before he filed his initial complaint. See\nMcKinney, 311 F.3d at 1200-01 (requiring pre-suit exhaustion\nunder the PLRA).\n\n     Akhtar contends that the evidence attached to his initial\ncomplaint and objections to Magistrate Judge Hollows’s\nfindings and recommendations shows that he exhausted his\nmedical deliberate indifference claim. Akhtar attached the\nJanuary 1 and 5, 2009 grievances, along with the related\nSecond Level Appeals and Director’s Level Decisions, to his\ninitial complaint and objections.\n\n\n\n\n                             15\n\f16                   AKHTAR V . MESA\n\n    The documents attached to Akhtar’s objection to\nMagistrate Judge Hollows’s findings and recommendations,\nas well as the allegations and attachments to his initial\ncomplaint, show that he exhausted his medical deliberate\nindifference claims in May 2009, several months before he\nfiled his initial complaint. In his January 5, 2009 grievance,\nAkhtar appealed the CDC-115 Rules Violation Report that he\nreceived for refusing to move to an E-bunk on December 2,\n2008. In that grievance, Akhtar stated that he “was punished\nfor protecting [his] rights.” According to Akhtar, he was\njustified in refusing to move to the E-bunk because his chrono\nexcluded him from “Dayroom and Gym dormitory bunk\nliving.” Akhtar suggesed that the corrections officials were\naware of his medical condition, but were deliberately\nindifferent to that condition by attempting to transfer him to\nan E-bunk. Akhtar also stated that his due process rights were\nviolated because he did not receive an interpreter or staff\nassistant.\n\n     Akhtar appealed the denial of this grievance. He received\na Second Level Appeal denying his claim on February 26,\n2009. He received a Director’s Level Decision, denying his\nclaim on May 28, 2009. The Director’s Level Decision\nshowed that the prison was aware that Akhtar contended that\nthe move to an E-bunk violated his medical chrono because\nit construed his medical chrono as not precluding E-bunk\nhousing. Specifically, the Director’s Level Decision stated\nthat “the appellant’s medical chronos limit him to lower\ntier/lower bunk housing. The appellant was ordered to move\nto a lower bunk bed; therefore, he was not precluded from\nobeying the order.”\n\n\n                             16\n\f                      AKHTAR V .

Akhtar’s January 5, 2009 grievance provided enough\ndetail to exhaust his Eighth Amendment claim because it\nprovided notice that Appellees had failed to comply with\nAkhtar’s medical chrono requiring him to be housed in a\nground-floor cell.\n\n    Appellees also contend that Magistrate Judge Hollows\n“screened out” Akhtar’s claims based on the January 5, 2009\ngrievance. This contention is misleading. In his screening\norder on the initial complaint, Magistrate Judge Hollows\ndismissed with leave to amend, any due process challenges to\nthe hearings on Akhtar’s CDC-115s. Akhtar, however, is not\nchallenging the dismissal of his due process challenges to his\nCDC-115s. Rather, he is challenging the dismissal of his\nEighth Amendment deliberate indifference claim. Appellees\nhave not shown that Magistrate Judge Hollows “screened out”\nthis claim.\n\n\n\n\n                              17\n\f18                        AKHTAR V . MESA\n\n    Appellees’ attempt to focus on Akhtar’s August 7, 2009\ngrievance regarding housing as evidence that he failed timely\nto exhaust this claim is not persuasive. Appellees maintain\nthat Akhtar’s claim fails because he did not receive a\nDirector’s Level Review on this grievance until November 2,\n2009, one month after Akhtar filed his first amended\ncomplaint. While Akhtar’s August 7, 2009 grievance did\naddress his deliberate indifference claim based on housing, he\ndid not need to receive a Director’s Level Decision on that\ngrievance before filing his first amended complaint because,\nas discussed above, he had already exhausted that claim.\nThus, Akhtar’s subsequent post-suit exhaustion of the August\n7, 2009 grievance is immaterial.\n\n    Because Akhtar received a Director’s Level Decision on\nhis January 5, 2009 grievance before he filed his initial\ncomplaint in which he alleged his deliberate indifference\nclaim based on housing, he exhausted this claim.5 Thus, the\ndistrict court erred by dismissing this claim for failure to\nexhaust.\n\n                                    ii\n\n   Appellees did not challenge Akhtar’s claim that he was\ndeprived of an interpreter in their motion to dismiss the first\n\n\n 5\n    Akhtar also contends that his January 1, 2009 grievance exhausted his\nadministrative remedies. That grievance, however, did not provide notice\nof his contention that Appellees ignored his medical chrono. In addition,\nit related to the December 9, 2008 incident, which did not involve Officer\nMesa or Sergeant Turner.\n\n                                   18\n\f                      AKHTAR V .

Appellees have not pointed to any evidence\nestablishing that this claim arose before Akhtar filed his\ninitial complaint or that it was not timely exhausted. Thus,\nthe district court erred by dismissing this claim for failure to\nexhaust.\n\n                               C\n\n    Akhtar further contends that the district court erred by\ndismissing his first amended complaint on the alternative\nground of failure to state a claim. He argues that the court\noverlooked the allegations in his pleading supporting his\nclaim and did not explain the basis for its decision. We\nreview this issue de novo. Hebbe v.

The defects are of\nparticular significance given that the grounds for dismissal\nwere not readily apparent. To comply with the law of this\ncircuit, the district court was required to explain the\ndeficiencies in Akhtar’s first amended complaint.

The district court did neither.\n\n    In their motion to dismiss the first amended complaint,\nAppellees argued that Akhtar’s deliberate indifference claim\nfailed because they “did not subject Akhtar to any serious\nmedical risk, never intended to harm Akhtar, and in fact\nAkhtar was not harmed.”6 On appeal, Appellees focus on\nAkhtar’s alleged failure to show “a causal relationship\nbetween Appellees and any supposed violation of his\nconstitutional rights.”\n\n    In Jett v.

Akhtar alleged\nthat he suffered from numerous medical conditions and was\nhearing and mobility impaired. Akhtar also attached a\nComprehensive Accommodation Chrono dated October 9,\n2008 and disability verification form dated August 23, 2006,\nas exhibits to his first amended complaint. The Chrono stated\nthat Akhtar required a “bottom bunk” and “ground floor cell.”\nThe disability verification form stated that Akhtar is “mobility\nimpaired” and had housing restrictions requiring a “lower\nbunk,” “no stairs,” and “no triple bunk.” These allegations\nand exhibits are sufficient to show that Akhtar has a serious\nmedical need.\n\n    Contrary to Appellees’ contention, the medical records\nattached to the first amended complaint do not contradict\nAkhtar’s allegation that he has a serious medical need. The\nfact that the records show that a doctor concluded, at a certain\npoint in time, that Akhtar’s kidney function was stable does\nnot contradict Akhtar’s allegation that he suffered from\nnumerous other medical conditions.\n\n    Akhtar’s first amended complaint also set forth sufficient\nfacts to show that Appellees were deliberately indifferent.\nAkhtar alleged that he showed his medical chrono requiring\na lower bunk in a ground-floor cell to Officer Mesa and\n\n\n                              22\n\f                          AKHTAR V .

He also alleged that they ignored the\nmedical chrono by moving him to an E-bunk in the dayroom.\n\n    Akhtar also alleged that he was harmed as a result of\nAppellees’ failure to comply with his chrono. He alleged that\nhe suffered a broken wrist. He also suffered humiliation and\nembarrassment on several occasions because he urinated in\nhis clothes.\n\n    Contrary to Appellees’ contentions, the fact that Akhtar’s\nmedical records attached to the first amended complaint do\nnot show that he suffered any adverse medical conditions as\na result of the move to the E-bunk does not contradict\nAkhtar’s allegations of harm. The absence of any mention of\nharm as a result of the move to the E-bunk fails to establish\nthat Akhtar did not suffer harm. His allegations of deliberate\nindifference to his medical condition were sufficient to satisfy\nthe pleading requirement. To the extent Appellees contest\nAkhtar’s ability to prove harm, that is an issue for summary\njudgment or trial, not a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.\n\n    Because Akhtar’s first amended complaint stated a claim\nupon which relief can be granted and neither Magistrate Judge\nHollows nor the district court provided a statement of the\ndeficiencies before dismissing the first amended complaint\nwith prejudice, the district court erred in granting the motion\nto dismiss.7\n\n\n 7\n   Nothing in this opinion should be construed as limiting Akhtar’s ability\nto seek leave to amend his first amended complaint if he so chooses to do\nso upon remand.\n\n                                   23\n\f24                     AKHTAR V .
