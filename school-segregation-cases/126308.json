This is a sweeping challenge to\nWisconsin’s campaign-finance law in light of Citizens United v.\nFEC, 558 U.S. 310 (2010). Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., and its\nState Political Action Committee—its “PAC” for state\nelections—sued to block the enforcement of many state statutes\nand rules against groups that spend money for political speech\nindependently of candidates and parties. The complaint alleges\nthat the challenged laws are vague and overbroad and unjusti-\nfiably burden the free-speech rights of independent political\nspeakers in violation of the First Amendment.\n    This is our second encounter with the case. When it was last\nhere, we addressed a single claim by the Wisconsin Right to\nLife State PAC: a challenge to section 11.26(4) of the Wisconsin\nStatutes, which caps at $10,000 the aggregate annual amount\na donor may give to state and local candidates, political parties,\nand political committees. See Wis. Right to Life State Political\nAction Comm. v. Barland (“Barland I”), 664 F.3d 139, 143 (7th Cir.\n2011). Applying Citizens United, we held that the aggregate\ncontribution limit is unconstitutional as applied to organiza-\ntions that independently spend money on election-related\nspeech and permanently enjoined its enforcement against\nindependent-expenditure groups and their donors. Id. at 155.\nOur ruling anticipated the Supreme Court’s recent decision in\nMcCutcheon v. FEC, 134 S. Ct. 1434 (2014), which more broadly\ninvalidated the aggregate contribution limit in federal law.\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                  3\n\n    The case returns on the remaining claims, which target a\ndizzying array of statutes and rules, from Wisconsin’s ban on\npolitical spending by corporations to the interlocking defini-\ntions that determine state “political committee” status to the\n“noncoordination” oath and disclaimer requirements for\nindependent political messages, to name just a few. The case\ncomes to us from a decision granting in part and denying in\npart the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. The\ndistrict court enjoined the ban on corporate political spending,\npartially enjoined a regulatory disclaimer rule, and denied the\nrest of the motion. The plaintiffs appealed.\n    We vacate the court’s order and remand with instructions\nto enter a new injunction. First, the present injunction order is\nimproper in form and must be reentered to conform to the\nspecificity requirements of Rule 65(d) of the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure. On the merits, in the domain of campaign-\nfinance law, the First Amendment requires a heightened\ndegree of regulatory clarity and a close fit between the\ngovernment’s means and its end, and some forms of regulation\nare categorically impermissible.\n    Like other campaign-finance systems, Wisconsin’s is\nlabyrinthian and difficult to decipher without a background in\nthis area of the law; in certain critical respects, it violates the\nconstitutional limits on the government’s power to regulate\nindependent political speech. Part of the problem is that the\nstate’s basic campaign-finance law—Chapter 11 of the Wiscon-\nsin Statutes—has not been updated to keep pace with the\nevolution in Supreme Court doctrine marking the boundaries\non the government’s authority to regulate election-related\n\f4                              Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\nspeech. In addition, key administrative rules do not cohere\nwell with the statutes, introducing a patchwork of new and\ndifferent terms, definitions, and burdens on independent\npolitical speakers, the intent and cumulative effect of which is\nto enlarge the reach of the statutory scheme. Finally, the state\nelections agency has given conflicting signals about its intent\nto enforce some aspects of the regulatory mélange.\n    Whether the agency has the statutory authority to regulate\nin this way is a serious question of state administrative law on\nwhich no state court has weighed in. As we explained in\nBarland I, the district judge initially abstained in this case to\nawait a ruling from the Wisconsin Supreme Court on the scope\nof the agency’s authority and a possible limiting construction\non one of the rules challenged here. 664 F.3d at 143–45. But the\nstate high court split evenly, with one justice recused, and the\noriginal action was dismissed without decision. See Wis.\nProsperity Network v. Myse, 810 N.W.2d 356 (Wis. 2012) (per\ncuriam). So we must take the regulatory scheme as we find it,\ntesting it against federal constitutional standards.\n    Certain statutory provisions—the ban on corporate political\nspending and the cap on the amount a corporation may spend\nto raise money for an affiliated PAC—are obviously unconsti-\ntutional under Citizens United and our decision in Barland I.\nOther statutes and rules fail First Amendment standards as\napplied to independent political speakers. Some of the chal-\nlenged provisions withstand constitutional scrutiny. We will\nidentify the constitutional infirmities as we move through our\nanalysis, and on remand a new, permanent injunction should\nbe entered in accordance with this opinion. One statute—the\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                 5\n\n24-hour-reporting requirement for late contributions and\nexpenditures—was recently amended to enlarge the reporting\ntime to 48 hours. If the plaintiffs want to challenge the amend-\ned statute, they will have to do so in the first instance in the\ndistrict court.\n\n\n                         I. Background\nA. The Parties\n    Wisconsin Right to Life is a nonprofit corporation with tax-\nexempt status as a social-welfare organization under 26 U.S.C.\n§ 501(c)(4). Its mission is to advance pro-life positions—\nopposition to abortion, euthanasia, and the destruction of\nhuman embryos—in the spheres of ethics, law, and civil\nsociety, and to promote alternatives to these procedures. See\nThe Mission and Vision of Wisconsin Right to Life, WIS. RIGHT TO\nLIFE, http://wrtl.org/mission (last visited May 9, 2014). In\nfurtherance of this purpose, Wisconsin Right to Life engages in\na range of political speech and public outreach on issues\nconnected to its mission, including (among other things)\nmailings, fliers, information posted on its website, and various\nforms of advertising. It also occasionally seeks to participate in\npolitical advocacy in state elections, but Wisconsin law flatly\nprohibits it from doing so. See WIS . STAT . § 11.38(1)(a)1 (ban-\nning corporations from making contributions and disburse-\nments for political purposes).\n    To avoid violating the statutory ban on election-related\nspeech by corporations, Wisconsin Right to Life formed an\naffiliated PAC that engages in express advocacy in elections for\n\f6                              Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\nstate offices. Wisconsin law prohibits the corporation from\ncontributing to its PAC. See id. § 11.38(1)(a)2.\n    Neither the organization nor its state PAC contributes to\ncandidates or other political committees, nor are they con-\nnected with candidates, their campaign committees, or political\nparties. That is to say, they operate independently of candi-\ndates and their campaign committees. We refer to the plaintiffs\ncollectively as “Wisconsin Right to Life” unless the context\nrequires us to distinguish between the organization and its\nPAC.\n    The Government Accountability Board was created in 2007\nto replace the State Elections Board as the agency responsible\nfor administering Wisconsin’s campaign-finance and election\nlaws. See 2007 Wis. Act 1 § 1. Its members are former state\njudges appointed by the governor from a nonpartisan slate\nnominated by a committee of sitting appellate judges. WIS.\nSTAT. § 15.60. The Government Accountability Board is not\nitself the named defendant: The individual board members are\nsued in their official capacities, which amounts to the same\nthing. We refer to them collectively as “the GAB” or “the\nBoard.”\n    The GAB has joint enforcement authority with elected\ndistrict attorneys to investigate violations of the state election\nlaws and to prosecute civil violations; district attorneys in each\ncounty have exclusive authority to prosecute criminal viola-\ntions. Id. § 5.05(2m). John Chisholm, the Milwaukee County\nDistrict Attorney, is also named as a defendant because\nWisconsin Right to Life has its headquarters in Milwaukee\nCounty. Because this is a preenforcement suit, however, our\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                  7\n\nfocus is on the challenged statutes, rules, and other regulatory\nactivity of the GAB, not on any specific action taken by the\ndistrict attorney. So we need not mention Chisholm further,\nthough he is, of course, bound by the injunction.\n                            *    *   *\n    Wisconsin Right to Life brought this suit as a comprehen-\nsive challenge to Wisconsin’s campaign-finance law in the\nwake of Citizens United. The case is sprawling and the briefing\nunwieldy, but we have managed to isolate the core constitu-\ntional claims. To understand them requires a grasp of the\nintricacies of Wisconsin’s campaign-finance system and some\nfamiliarity with its statutory, regulatory, and litigation history.\nThe chronicle roughly corresponds to important developments\nin the Supreme Court’s campaign-finance caselaw, so we’ll\ninclude a discussion of the relevant cases along the way and\ncome back to them later in the analysis.\n   Bear with us. The sweep of this case is very broad. To\ndecide it requires a legal and political history of minor epic\nproportions and a good deal of regulatory detail. We will\nradically simplify, but significant length cannot be avoided.\n\n\nB. Wisconsin’s Campaign-Finance System\n    The statutory requirements of Wisconsin’s campaign-\nfinance system are found in Chapter 11 of the Wisconsin\nStatutes, adopted in 1973 following the enactment of the\nFederal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (“FECA”), 2 U.S.C.\n§§ 431 et seq. Like its federal counterpart, Chapter 11 estab-\nlishes an elaborate regulatory regime for campaign finance in\n\f8                               Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\nstate elections, imposing organizational, registration,\nrecordkeeping, reporting, attribution, and disclaimer duties on\npolitical speakers; the law also sets limits on contributions and\nexpenditures for election-related activities and communica-\ntions. The statutory scheme broadly applies to candidates, their\ncampaign committees, political parties, independent groups,\nand individuals alike.\n    “To a lay reader, both statutes [FECA and Chapter 11]\nrequire almost any group that wants to say almost anything\nabout a candidate or election to register as a political commit-\ntee.” Wis. Right to Life, Inc. v. Paradise, 138 F.3d 1183, 1184 (7th\nCir. 1998); see also WIS. STAT . § 11.12(1) (flatly prohibiting\ncontributions and spending for election-related speech except\nto, through, or by an individual or committee that has regis-\ntered with and is regulated by the state elections agency). But\nthe Supreme Court’s decision in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1\n(1976), limits what campaign-finance regulators may do. In\nBuckley, “[the] Court construed (some would say rewrote) the\nfederal statute to avoid some of the many constitutional\nproblems that arise when regulating political speech, the core\nof the [F]irst [A]mendment’s domain.” Paradise, 138 F.3d at\n1184. “[M]any elements of the Buckley approach are required\nby the [F]irst [A]mendment, which means that they apply to\nthe states.” Id.\n\n\n    1. Buckley v. Valeo\n   We take our first detour into the caselaw to highlight the\ndoctrine established in Buckley, which addressed a\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                     9\n\ncomprehensive challenge to the 1971 federal law and remains\nthe Supreme Court’s baseline campaign-finance decision. We\nstart with the broad foundational principles. Because free-\nflowing political debate is “integral to” our system of govern-\nment, “‘there is practically universal agreement that a major\npurpose of th[e] [First] Amendment was to protect the free\ndiscussion of governmental affairs, … of course includ[ing]\ndiscussions of candidates.’” Buckley, 424 U.S. at 14 (quoting\nMills v. Alabama, 384 U.S. 214, 218 (1966)).1 This agreement\n“reflects our ‘profound national commitment to the principle\nthat debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and\nwide-open.’” Id. (quoting N.Y. Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S.\n254, 270 (1964)). The right to speak freely about political issues,\npublic policy, and candidates for public office has both\nindividual and associational aspects and “‘has its fullest and\nmost urgent application precisely to the conduct of campaigns\nfor political office.’” Id. at 15 (quoting Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy,\n401 U.S. 265, 272 (1971)).\n    To implement this vital constitutional protection, Buckley\nnarrowed the reach of FECA and announced some limiting\nprinciples applicable to all campaign-finance laws. First, the\ngovernment’s authority to regulate in this area extends only to\nmoney raised and spent for speech that is clearly election\nrelated; ordinary political speech about issues, policy, and\npublic officials must remain unencumbered. See id. at 42–44; see\nalso id. at 78–80.\n\n\n\n1\n The First Amendment provides that “Congress shall make no law …\nabridging the freedom of speech.” U.S. C O N ST . amend. I.\n\f10                              Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\n    Second, because political speech is at the core of the First\nAmendment right, overbreadth and vagueness concerns loom\nlarge in this area, especially when the regulatory scheme\nreaches beyond candidates, their campaign committees, and\npolitical parties. To protect against an unconstitutional chill on\nissue advocacy by independent speakers, Buckley held that\ncampaign-finance regulation must be precise, clear, and may\nonly extend to speech that is “unambiguously related to the\ncampaign of a particular federal candidate.” Id. at 80. To put\nthe point differently, “‘[b]ecause First Amendment freedoms\nneed breathing space to survive, government may regulate in\n[this] area only with narrow specificity.’” Id. at 41 n.48 (quoting\nNAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 433 (1963)).\n    The 1971 law was both too uncertain and too broad to\nsatisfy the constitutional requirements of clarity and precision;\nBuckley held that the “constitutional deficiencies [of vagueness\nand overbreadth] … can be avoided only by reading [the\nfederal statute] as limited to communications that include\nexplicit words of advocacy of election or defeat of a candidate.”\nId. at 43 (emphasis added). In other words, the First Amend-\nment forbids the government from regulating political expres-\nsion that does not “in express terms advocate the election or\ndefeat of a clearly identified candidate.” Id. at 44.\n    Applying this limiting principle to FECA’s disclosure\nrequirements for independent political expenditures, the Court\ngave the federal statute a narrowing construction, holding that\nthe disclosure duties could be triggered only when “funds [are]\nused for communications that expressly advocate the election\nor defeat of a clearly identified candidate.” Id. at 80. In a\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                  11\n\nfamous footnote, the Court listed some examples of express\nadvocacy: “vote for,” “elect,” “support,” “cast your ballot for,”\n“Smith for Congress,” “vote against,” “defeat,” and “reject.” Id.\nat 44 n.52. These are the Buckley “magic words.”\n    The Court also narrowed the scope of “political committee”\nstatus to reach only groups that engage in election advocacy as\ntheir major purpose. Id. at 79–80. This, too, was an application\nof the constitutional-avoidance doctrine to address vagueness\nand overbreadth concerns. Political-committee status carries a\ncomplex, comprehensive, and intrusive set of restrictions and\nregulatory burdens. See 2 U.S.C. §§ 433, 434(a)–(b),\n441a(a)(1)(C), 441b(a). Buckley held that “[t]o fulfill the pur-\nposes of the Act[,] [the definition of political committee] need\nonly encompass organizations that are under the control of a\ncandidate or the major purpose of which is the nomination or\nelection of a candidate.” 424 U.S. at 79. Expenditures by\npolitical committees “so construed” clearly “fall within the core\narea sought to be addressed by Congress. They are, by defini-\ntion, campaign related.” Id.\n    Finally, the Court drew a distinction between restrictions\non expenditures for election-related speech and restrictions on\ncontributions to candidates. Buckley held that limits on contribu-\ntions are reviewed under an intermediate standard of scrutiny\nand may be permissible based on the public interest in prevent-\ning quid pro quo corruption, but limits on expenditures get\nstrict scrutiny and usually flunk. See id. at 25–27, 55–56; see also\nBarland I, 664 F.3d at 152–53. The distinction drawn in Buckley\nbetween expenditures and contributions may be eroding—and\nwith it the different standards of review—but for now these\n\f12                             Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\ncategories remain. See McCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1445 (opinion\nof Roberts, C.J.) (“[W]e see no need in this case to revisit\nBuckley’s distinction between contributions and expenditures\nand the corollary distinction in the applicable standards of\nreview.”); see also id. at 1462–65 (Thomas, J., concurring in\njudgment) (calling for strict scrutiny of contribution limits).\n                           *   *   *\n    As originally enacted, Chapter 11 of the Wisconsin Statutes\ncontained many of the same constitutional infirmities as the\nfederal statute. Soon after the Buckley decision was released,\nthe Attorney General of Wisconsin issued an opinion to the\nState Elections Board—the predecessor to the GAB—advising\nit that some parts of Chapter 11 were unconstitutional and\nothers must be narrowly construed. See 65 Op. Att’y Gen. Wis.\n145 (1976); see also Paradise, 138 F.3d at 1185. Chapter 11 was\nthereafter amended to incorporate Buckley’s express-advocacy\nlimiting principle. See Elections Bd. v. Wis. Mfrs. & Commerce,\n597 N.W.2d 721, 727–28 (Wis. 1999).\n\n\n     2. Chapter 11\n    The various prescriptions and proscriptions in Chapter 11\napply to candidates, individuals, and political committees,\nbroadly defined. A “committee” or “political committee” (the\nterms are used interchangeably) is “any person other than an\nindividual and any combination of 2 or more persons, perma-\nnent or temporary, which makes or accepts contributions or makes\ndisbursements, whether or not engaged in activities which are\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                         13\n\nexclusively political.” WIS. STAT . § 11.01(4) (emphasis added).2\nLike its federal counterpart, Chapter 11 is structured so that\npolitical-committee status is determined indirectly, by the\nmaking or acceptance of “contributions” or the making of\n“disbursements” (called “expenditures” in the federal law). See\nid.; see also 2 U.S.C. § 431(4) (defining “political committee”). In\nstate law, as in FECA, this status triggers complicated and\nburdensome regulatory restrictions and requirements, so\ndefining “committee” in this way brings Buckley’s vagueness\nand overbreadth concerns into play.\n    Committees under Chapter 11 can be general or specific,\nand connected to or independent of candidates, parties, or\npartisan legislative caucuses. Specific varieties mentioned in\nthe statute include personal campaign committees, legislative\ncampaign committees, support committees, political party\ncommittees, and “special interest” committees. See WIS. STAT .\n§ 11.05(3). A personal campaign committee is just what it\nsounds like: a political committee operated by a candidate or\nwith the candidate’s authorization. See id. § 11.01(15). Legisla-\ntive campaign committees are party committees “organized in\neither house of the legislature to support candidates of a\npolitical party for legislative office.” Id. § 11.01(12s). Other\ncommittee types are left undefined.3\n\n\n\n2\n The general statutory definition of “person” includes “all partnerships,\nassociations and bodies politic or corporate.” W IS . S TAT . § 990.01(26).\n\n3\n  As in federal campaign-finance jargon, state political committees are\nsometimes colloquially referred to as “PACs.”\n\f14                              Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\n    Chapter 11 provides that “every committee other than a\npersonal campaign committee which makes or accepts contri-\nbutions, incurs obligations, or makes disbursements in a\ncalendar year in an aggregate amount in excess of $25” must\nregister with the state elections agency. Id. § 11.05(1) (establish-\ning the general registration requirement). Candidates and their\npersonal campaign committees have an absolute duty to\nregister; there is no expenditure or disbursement threshold. See\nid. § 11.05(2g). Individuals also must register if they “accept[]\ncontributions, incur[] obligations, or make[] disbursements in\na calendar year in an aggregate amount in excess of $25 to\nsupport or oppose the election or nomination of a candidate.”\nId. § 11.05(2).\n    The dollar threshold for registration was recently raised\nand is now $300—still a very modest amount. See 2013 Wis. Act\n153 §§ 5, 6, 9 (effective Mar. 29, 2014). The remaining criteria\nfor registration are unaffected by the recent legislation.\n    Registration carries certain organizational prerequisites.\nCommittees must appoint a treasurer. (Individual registrants\nare considered their own treasurers.) WIS. STAT . § 11.10(3). The\ntreasurer is personally liable for violations of the reporting\nduties and other requirements of the regulatory system. Id.\n§ 11.20(13).

In other words,\ncommittees in this category need not report general operating\nexpenses; for all other committees, “administrative and\noverhead expenses” must be reported as disbursements. See id.\n§ 11.01(16). All disbursements that count as contributions to\ncandidates or other committees must be reported. See id.\n§ 11.06(2).\n\f18                              Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\n    Finally, each financial report must itemize the following:\n(1) total contributions made, contributions received, and\ndisbursements made during the reporting period and cumula-\ntively year-to-date (including reporting-period and cumulative\nyear-to-date totals for individual donors and recipients); (2) the\nbalance of obligations incurred as of the end of the reporting\nperiod; and (3) the registrant’s cash on hand at the beginning\nand end of the reporting period.

Id. § 11.20. When a\ncommittee disbands, it must file a termination report. Id.\n§ 11.19(1). Registrants may file a suspension report if there will\nbe no disbursements, contributions, or obligations in the\naggregate of more than $1,000 in a calendar year, but the\nsuspension is effective only for the calendar year in which it is\napproved by the elections agency. Id. § 11.19(2).\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                              19\n\n    Other restrictions and requirements apply, but we’ll pause\nhere to catch our breath and summarize. Under Chapter 11 any\ngroup that makes or receives a “contribution,” incurs an\n“obligation,” or makes a “disbursement” in excess of $300 in a\ncalendar year is treated as a political committee. (Individuals\nare covered too, but we’re mostly concerned with Chapter 11’s\napplication to organizational associations.) Committee status\ntriggers substantial and continuous organizational, registra-\ntion, and recordkeeping requirements, and compliance is\nrequired before any money is spent for election-related speech;\nthe periodic reporting duties kick in immediately thereafter.\n   So the whole regulatory system turns on what counts as a\n“contribution,” “obligation,” or “disbursement.” Chapter 11\ndefines all three terms very broadly to include anything of\nvalue given or spent “for political purposes.”5 That all-\nimportant phrase is defined as follows:\n\n\n\n5\n  M ore specifically, “contribution” means “[a] gift, subscription, loan,\nadvance, or deposit of money or anything of value [except a loan from a\ncommercial lending institution] … made for political purposes.” W IS . S TAT .\n§ 11.01(6)(a) (emphasis added). An “incurred obligation” means “every\nexpress obligation … including every loan, guarantee of a loan or other\nobligation or payment for any goods, or for any services … incurred by a\ncandidate, committee[, or] individual … for political purposes.” Id. § 11.01(11)\n(emphasis added). A “disbursement” means a “purchase, payment,\ndistribution, loan, advance, deposit, or gift of money or anything of value\n[except a loan from a commercial lending institution] … , [or a ‘contract,\npromise, or agreement’ to do any of these things] made for political purposes.”\nId. § 11.01(7)(a) (emphasis added).\n\f20                               Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\n           (16) An act is for “political purposes” when it\n       is done for the purpose of influencing the election or\n       nomination for election of any individual to state\n       or local office, for the purpose of influencing the\n       recall from or retention in office of an individual\n       holding a state or local office, for the purpose of\n       payment of expenses incurred as a result of a\n       recount at an election, or for the purpose of influ-\n       encing a particular vote at a referendum. …\n           (a) Acts which are for “political purposes” include\n       but are not limited to:\n           1. The making of a communication which ex-\n       pressly advocates the election, defeat, recall or reten-\n       tion of a clearly identified candidate or a particular\n       vote at a referendum.\nId. § 11.01(16) (emphases added).\n    The “express advocacy” language we have italicized above\nwas added to comply with the requirements laid down in\nBuckley. See Wis. Mfrs. & Commerce, 597 N.W.2d at 727–28. The\neffect of this limiting language was to place issue advo-\ncacy—political ads and other communications that do not\nexpressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified\ncandidate—beyond the reach of the regulatory scheme. Id. at\n729–31; see also WIS. ADMIN . CODE EL BD § 1.28 (1977); 65 Op.\nAtt’y Gen. at 152–54.\n   A few of Chapter 11’s other requirements and restrictions\nare directly or indirectly implicated here. Anonymous dis-\nbursements are prohibited. Any advertisement or other\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                              21\n\ncommunication by a political committee must contain an\nattribution specifically including the words “Paid for by”\nfollowed by the name of the committee and its treasurer. WIS.\nSTAT. § 11.30(2)(b). Advertisements and other communications\nby independent committees must carry an additional dis-\nclaimer: “Not authorized by any candidate or candidate’s\nagent or committee.” Id. § 11.30(2)(d). A related administrative\nrule requires that any “political message” by an individual or\ngroup acting independently of a candidate contain a much\nwordier disclaimer:\n       The committee (individual) is the sole source of\n       this communication and the committee (individ-\n       ual) did not act in cooperation or consultation\n       with, and in concert with, or at the request or\n       suggestion of any candidate or any agent or\n       authorized committee of a candidate who is\n       supported or opposed by this communication.\nWIS. ADMIN . CODE GAB § 1.42(5).\n   Contribution limits apply. Earlier in this case we addressed\none of them—section 11.26(4), the $10,000 aggregate annual\ncap on contributions to candidates and committees—and\nfound it unconstitutional under Citizens United as applied to\ncontributions to independent groups. Barland I, 664 F.3d at 155.\nSeparately, subsections 11.26(1) and (2) impose specific dollar\nlimits on contributions to candidates, their personal campaign\ncommittees, and any independent committee “acting solely in\nsupport of such a candidate or solely in opposition to the\ncandidate’s opponent.”\n\f22                              Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\n    Finally, like the federal statute at issue in Citizens United,\nChapter 11 bans all political speech by corporations: No\ncorporation may “make any contribution or disbursement,\ndirectly or indirectly, either independently or through any\npolitical party, committee, group, candidate or individual.”\nWIS. STAT . § 11.38(1)(a)1. A corporation may, however, create\na separate segregated fund for election-related speech, which\nhas the status of a political committee and must register and\nreport as such. Id. § 11.38(1)(a)2. The corporation may “solicit\ncontributions from individuals to the fund … for the purpose\nof supporting or opposing any candidate for state or local\noffice,” but the corporation itself may not contribute to the\nfund. Id. Until recently, Chapter 11 also provided that no\ncorporation may spend “more than a combined total of $500\nannually for solicitation of contributions” to its segregated\nfund (i.e., to its affiliated PAC). Id. § 11.38(1)(a)3. The spending\nlimit on fundraising by corporations for affiliated PACs was\nrecently raised to $20,000 or 20% of the amount the committee\nraised the previous year. See 2013 Wis. Act 153 § 21m.\n\n\nC. Chapter 11 in the Courts\n    Although Chapter 11 has been on the books for more than\n40 years, the Wisconsin Supreme Court has addressed it only\ntwice. In Gard v. State Elections Board, 456 N.W.2d 809, 826–29\n(Wis. 1990), the court upheld the limits on contributions to\ncandidates, relying on the distinction drawn in Buckley between\ncampaign contributions and expenditures. More relevant is\nElections Board v. Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, a major\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                23\n\ntest of the scope of the state’s regulatory authority under\nBuckley.\n\n\n   1. Elections Board v. Wisconsin Manufacturers &\n   Commerce\n    In the fall of 1996, an affiliate of Wisconsin Manufacturers &\nCommerce, Inc. (“WMC”), the state’s largest business group,\nsponsored radio and television ads naming several state\nlegislators who were on the November ballot. The ads were the\nkind that have become ubiquitous in each election cycle ever\nsince Buckley drew the regulatory line at express advocacy. The\nnarrator described the legislators’ voting records on particular\nissues—specifically, on the issues of taxes and crime—and\nurged listeners to call the lawmakers and voice their disap-\nproval. Wis. Mfrs. & Commerce, 597 N.W.2d at 724–25.\n    The targeted legislators waged a two-front legal battle to\nforce the ads off the air. First, they filed administrative com-\nplaints with the State Elections Board; second, they sued WMC\nand its affiliate seeking court orders enjoining the ads. Id. at\n725; see also WIS. STAT . § 11.66 (authorizing private suits by\nelectors to compel compliance with Chapter 11). The litigation\nstrategy was successful. Trial judges around the state ordered\nthe WMC affiliate to remove the ads from the air. Wis. Mfrs. &\nCommerce, 597 N.W.2d at 725.\n   When the election was over, the Elections Board took up\nthe administrative complaints, classified the ads as express\nadvocacy under Chapter 11, and ordered the affiliate to\nregister as a political committee and file retrospective and\n\f24                              Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\nprospective financial reports. Id. Predictably, the organization\nrefused to comply, so the Board filed an enforcement action\nseeking per diem monetary penalties and injunctive relief. Id.\nat 725–26. The trial court dismissed the case, holding that the\nBoard’s approach to the express-advocacy classification was\nunconstitutionally ad hoc and vague, amounted to retroactive\nrulemaking, and was not adequately tailored to satisfy First\nAmendment scrutiny. Id. at 726.\n    The state supreme court affirmed, but on the narrowest\nground. The court held that the Board had impermissibly\nengaged in retroactive rulemaking by “creating and attempting\nto apply [a] new, context-oriented interpretation of the\nstatutory term express advocacy” while adjudicating an\nadministrative complaint. Id. at 735. The court agreed with the\ntrial judge that “it would be profoundly unfair to apply a\npreviously unarticulated test, retroactively, to these defen-\ndants.” Id.\n    Having decided the case on this procedural ground, the\ncourt specifically declined to “craft a new standard of express\nadvocacy for the state of Wisconsin,” leaving that task to the\nlegislature or the Board. Id. at 736. But the court offered some\nguidance regarding the permissible scope of any standard the\nlegislature or agency might write. First, “Buckley stands for the\nproposition that it is unconstitutional to place reporting or\ndisclosure requirements on communications which do not\n‘expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified\ncandidate.’” Id. at 731 (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 80). Next, to\nqualify as “express advocacy” within the meaning of\nsection 11.01(16), a communication “must contain explicit\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                25\n\nlanguage advocating the election or defeat of a candidate who\nis clearly identified.” Id. Finally, the court allowed that any\nstatutory or regulatory definition of express advocacy “may\nencompass more than the specific magic words in Buckley\nfootnote 52,” but reminded legislators and regulators that the\ndefinition must be “limited to communications that include\nexplicit words of advocacy of election or defeat of a candidate.”\nId. at 737 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n   2. Campaign Finance Reform Is Tried and Fails in\n   Wisconsin\n    Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce was decided in July\n1999. The Elections Board thereafter amended its existing\nadministrative rule regarding the scope of regulated campaign\nactivity to conform to the state supreme court’s guidance on\nthe meaning of express advocacy. See EL BD § 1.28 (2001). At the\nsame time, however, state campaign-finance reformers were\nhard at work trying to move a proposal through the state\nlegislature expanding the regulatory scheme to cover issue ads\nlike those targeted in Wisconsin Manufacurers & Commerce. In\ndue course they succeeded, though as we’ll see, their victory\nwas short-lived.\n    In 2001 the legislature adopted major amendments to\nChapter 11 broadening the definition of “political purposes” to\ncover issue ads and other communications naming a candidate\nin the lead-up to an election and otherwise expanding the\nscope of the state’s regulation of political speech. 2001 Wis. Act\n109; see Wis. Realtors Ass’n v. Ponto (“Wis. Realtors I”),\n\f26                             Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\n229 F. Supp. 2d 889, 890–91 (W.D. Wis. 2002). Under the new\nlaw, any communication made within 60 days of an election\nthat “‘includes a reference to … a clearly identified candidate’”\nqualified as a communication made for political purposes, thus\ntriggering political-committee status and the full range of\nproscriptions and prescriptions in Chapter 11. Wis. Realtors\nAss’n v. Ponto (“Wis. Realtors II”), 233 F. Supp. 2d 1078, 1083–84\n(W.D. Wis. 2002) (quoting 2001 Wis. Act 109 § 1ty).\n    This expansion of the regulatory system was not designed\nto stick. The legislature included a nonseverability clause and\na fairly obvious poison pill. Section 1uck (yes, you read that\ncorrectly) prohibited independent groups from sponsoring any\ncommunications that referred to a candidate within 30 days of\nan election without first filing a report with the Elections Board\nproviding “‘the name of each candidate who will be supported\nor whose opponent will be opposed and the total disburse-\nments to be made.’” Id. at 1090 (quoting 2001 Wis. Act 109\n§ 1uck ) (emphasis omitted). Failure to file the minimum 31-day\nnotice meant a total speech blackout: no political communica-\ntions allowed in the final month of the campaign. Id.\n    Before the ink was dry on the governor’s signature, the new\nlaw was challenged in state and federal court. See Wis.\nRealtors I, 229 F. Supp. 2d at 891. The constitutional cloud over\nthe legislature’s handiwork was so conspicuous that lawmak-\ners included a nonstatutory provision directing the Attorney\nGeneral to “promptly commence” an original action in the\nstate supreme court asking the justices to decide whether the\nlaw was unconstitutional. Id. As it turned out, the federal court\nreached judgment first, striking down the advance-notice\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                          27\n\nprovision as an unconstitutional form of prior restraint on\nspeech. Wis. Realtors II, 233 F. Supp. 2d at 1090–93. By opera-\ntion of the nonseverability clause, the new law was invalid in\nits entirety. Id. at 1093; see also Wis. Right to Life, Inc. v. Schober,\n366 F.3d 485, 487–88 (7th Cir. 2004) (describing this history).\n                                *    *    *\n    Since the ill-fated 2001 law, legislative support for more\nregulation of political speech has evaporated. New efforts to\nenlarge the scope of Chapter 11 have consistently failed to get\noff the ground.6 Instead, the momentum runs in the opposite\ndirection. The most recent statutory amendments are modestly\nderegulatory: The legislature raised the monetary threshold for\nPAC status (at $300, it’s still quite low), loosened restrictions on\ncontributions by lobbyists, and created an exemption for\ncertain uncompensated political activity on the Internet. See\n2013 Wis. Act 153.\n\n\nD. Important Federal Developments\n    As Wisconsin’s campaign-finance reform movement was\ncollapsing, Congress enacted the Bipartisan Campaign Reform\nAct of 2002—“BCRA” for short, but better known as the\n“McCain-Feingold” law for its principal Senate sponsors. Pub.\nL. No. 107-155, 116 Stat. 81. (codified at 2 U.S.C. §§ 438a, 441a–\n\n6\n A nonexhaustive list of failed campaign-finance reform bills includes\n2005 Assembly Bill 392; 2005 Senate Bill 538; 2007 Senate Bill 1, Dec. Spec.\nSess.; 2007 Senate Bill 12; 2007 Senate Bill 77; 2007 Senate Bill 182;\n2007 Assembly Bill 272; 2007 Assembly Bill 355; 2007 Assembly Bill 704;\n2009 Senate Bill 221; 2009 Assembly Bill 388; and 2009 Assembly Bill 812.\n\f28                            Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\n441i, 441k). McCain-Feingold brought a subset of issue advo-\ncacy into the federal regulatory sphere, introducing a new\ncategory of regulated political speech: “electioneering\ncommunication[s],” defined as “any broadcast, cable, or\nsatellite communication” that “refers to a clearly identified\ncandidate for Federal office” and appears within 60 days of a\nfederal general election or 30 days of a federal primary\nelection. 2 U.S.C. § 434(f)(3)(A).\n    Among other things, McCain-Feingold prohibited corpora-\ntions and labor unions from making contributions or expendi-\ntures for electioneering communications; express advocacy by\ncorporations and unions was already banned. See id. § 441b.\nThe new law also established a limited disclosure requirement\nfor expenditures for electioneering communications in excess\nof $10,000 in a calendar year. At that level of spending, the\nsponsoring group must file a statement with the Federal\nElection Commission disclosing its identity and place of\nbusiness, some basic information about the expenditure (the\namount and to whom it was paid), the election to which the\nexpenditure pertains, and the identity of donors who contrib-\nuted $1,000 or more for the electioneering communications. Id.\n§ 434(f)(1)–(2). In most cases the disclosure statement is due\nwithin 24 hours of a qualifying expenditure above the statutory\nthreshold. Id. § 434(f)(1), (4).\n\n\n     1. McConnell v. FEC\n   BCRA largely survived its first constitutional test in\nMcConnell v. FEC, 540 U.S. 93 (2003). As relevant here, the\nSupreme Court rejected a facial challenge to the ban on\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                          29\n\ncorporate sponsorship of electioneering communications,\nexplaining that the express-advocacy line drawn in Buckley was\n“an endpoint of statutory interpretation, not a first principle of\nconstitutional law.” Id. at 190. Still, the Court acknowledged\nthat the limitation was “born of an effort to avoid [the] consti-\ntutional infirmities” of vagueness and overbreadth, id. at 192,\nso the ultimate holding in McConnell was narrow: The federal\nban on corporate electioneering communications was facially\nvalid, but only “to the extent that … issue ads during the 30-\nand 60-day periods … are the functional equivalent of express\nadvocacy,” id. at 206 (emphasis added).\n    This left the door open for as-applied challenges. But the\nCourt did not explain what it meant by “functional equiva-\nlence.” Instead, it simply “assume[d] that the interests that\njustify the regulation of campaign speech might not apply to\nthe regulation of genuine issue ads.” Id. at 206 n.88. The\nconcept of “functional equivalence” acquired some content a\nfew years later when the ban on corporate electioneering\ncommunications returned to the Court, this time in the context\nof an as-applied challenge brought by our plaintiff here. See\nFEC v. Wis. Right To Life, Inc. (“Wis. Right to Life II”), 551 U.S.\n449, 455–57 (2007).7\n\n\n\n\n7\n  In an earlier decision in the same litigation— commonly referred to as\n“Wisconsin Right to Life I”— the Court clarified that McConnell did not\nforeclose as-applied challenges to the federal ban on corporate electioneer-\ning communications. See Wis. Right to Life, Inc. v. FEC, 546 U.S. 410, 412\n(2006) (per curiam).\n\f30                              Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\n     2. Wisconsin Right to Life II\n    In the summer of 2004, Wisconsin Right to Life prepared\ntelevision and radio ads criticizing the filibuster of federal\njudicial nominees and began to broadcast them in early\nAugust. Id. at 458–59. The ads named Wisconsin’s senators and\nurged listeners to call and tell them to oppose the filibuster. Id.\nBut BCRA’s blackout period before the federal primary\nelection commenced on August 15, so Wisconsin Right to Life\nsought declaratory and injunctive relief against the speech ban\nas applied to issue ads of this type. Id. at 460.\n    The Supreme Court held that Wisconsin Right to Life could\nnot be prohibited from using its general treasury funds to\nsponsor these ads, but the decision was fractured. Of the five\njustices in the majority, three would have overruled McConnell\nto the extent that it had facially upheld the ban on corporate\nelectioneering communications. See id. at 483–504 (Scalia, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in the judgment, joined by\nKennedy and Thomas, J.J.). Chief Justice Roberts, joined by\nJustice Alito, took a narrower path, concluding that the ads\nwere neither express advocacy nor its functional equivalent\nand thus could not be banned. Id. at 476–82 (opinion of\nRoberts, C.J.)\n    The Chief Justice explained that “[p]rior to BCRA, corpora-\ntions were free under federal law to use independent expendi-\ntures to engage in political speech so long as that speech did\nnot expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly\nidentified federal candidate.” Id. at 457. But BCRA “ma[de] it\na federal crime for any corporation to broadcast, shortly before\nan election, any communication that names a federal candidate\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                31\n\nfor elected office and is targeted to the electorate.” Id. at\n455–56. The law had “survive[d] strict scrutiny [in McConnell]\nto the extent it regulates express advocacy or its functional\nequivalent,” id. at 465, so if the antifilibuster ads were express\nadvocacy or its equivalent, that holding controlled unless\nrevisited and overruled, id. If, on the other hand, the ads were\nnot express advocacy or its equivalent—i.e., if they were\n“genuine issue ads”—then McConnell did not apply. Id.\n    “Express advocacy” had an established meaning under\nBuckley, but the concept of “functional equivalence” was new.\nIt was not clear how to determine on a case-by-case basis\nwhether a particular communication counted as the functional\nequivalent of express electoral advocacy. The Chief Justice\nprovided a test: “[A]n ad is the functional equivalent of express\nadvocacy only if the ad is susceptible of no reasonable interpre-\ntation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific\ncandidate.” Id. at 469–70. His lead opinion also provided a\nframework for applying the test: (1) [T]he inquiry “must be\nobjective, focusing on the substance of the communication\nrather than amorphous considerations of intent and effect,” id.\nat 469; (2) “contextual factors … should seldom play a signifi-\ncant role in the inquiry,” id. at 473–74; (3) because the govern-\nment has the burden of justifying restrictions on political\nspeech, the speaker gets the benefit of any doubt, id. at 464–65;\nand (4) if an ad “may reasonably be interpreted as something\nother than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candi-\ndate, … [then it is] not the functional equivalent of express\nadvocacy,” id. at 476.\n\f32                             Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\n   On this understanding of functional equivalence, the Chief\nJustice held that the antifilibuster ads\n       are plainly not the functional equivalent of\n       express advocacy. First, their content is consis-\n       tent with that of a genuine issue ad: The ads\n       focus on a legislative issue, take a position on the\n       issue, exhort the public to adopt that position,\n       and urge the public to contact public officials\n       with respect to the matter. Second, their content\n       lacks indicia of express advocacy: The ads do not\n       mention an election, candidacy, political party,\n       or challenger; and they do not take a position on\n       a candidate’s character, qualifications, or fitness\n       for office.\nId. at 470. Because the ads were neither express advocacy nor\nits equivalent, McConnell did not apply and the government\nhad to justify restricting the speech under strict scrutiny. It\ncould not do so. The ban on corporate electioneering communi-\ncations was unconstitutional as applied to Wisconsin Right to\nLife’s speech. Id. at 481.\n\n\nE. The Government Accountability Board Enters the Scene\n    In January 2008—six months after the Supreme Court\nissued its decision in Wisconsin Right to Life—the Government\nAccountability Board opened its doors as the new regulatory\nagency responsible for administering Wisconsin election law,\ntaking over for the dissolved Elections Board. At the time, the\npredecessor agency had been weighing new rulemaking to\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                        33\n\nbroaden the scope of the campaign-finance system to cover a\nsubset of issue ads akin to the “electioneering communica-\ntions” now covered by federal law. This proved to be a heavy\nregulatory lift. Restricting political speech is inherently\ncontroversial, and many stakeholders reasonably questioned\nwhether the agency had the statutory authority to add new\ncategories of regulated speech not covered by Chapter 11.8 The\neffort stalled in the Elections Board. The new agency picked up\nwhere its predecessor left off.\n    Recall that soon after the state supreme court decided\nWisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, the Elections Board\namended its existing administrative rule governing the scope\nof regulated activity to conform to the limits identified in the\ncourt’s opinion. The amended rule defined “political commit-\ntee” as “every committee which is formed primarily to influ-\nence elections or which is under the control of a candidate,”\nand also specified that\n           (2) Individuals other than candidates and\n        committees other than political committees are\n        subject to the applicable disclosure-related and\n        recordkeeping-related requirements of ch. 11,\n        Stats., only when they:\n\n\n\n\n8\n See GAB, Open Session A genda M aterials (M ar. 26, 2008), http://gab.wi.\ngov/sites/default/files/event/74/03_26_2008_agenda_materials_pdf_96273.\npdf.

Other individuals and\ngroups would be “subject to the applicable disclosure-related\nand recordkeeping-related requirements” of Chapter 11 only\nto the extent that they made contributions for political pur-\nposes or spent money for communications containing express\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                               35\n\nadvocacy (again, understood in the Buckley sense) or its\nfunctional equivalent (understood in the Wisconsin Right to\nLife II sense), assuming the very low dollar threshold—then\njust $25—was crossed. The reference to the “applicable\ndisclosure-related and recordkeeping-related requirements of\nChapter 11” was not further explained.\n    The new agency initially reaffirmed ElBd § 1.28 but thereaf-\nter embarked on a project aimed at bringing a wide swath of\nissue advocacy within the regulatory scheme.9 The Board\ndirected its staff to draft a new version of § 1.28 significantly\nexpanding its scope by adding a new category of regulated\ncommunications much broader than the federal “electioneering\ncommunications” at issue in McConnell and Wisconsin Right to\nLife II.10 The new GAB § 1.28 is central to the claims in this case;\nwe will reproduce it in a moment.

FEC\n    Citizens United arrived at the Supreme Court in the same\nposture as Wisconsin Right to Life II—as an as-applied challenge\nto the federal ban on corporate-funded independent expendi-\ntures for express advocacy and electioneering communications.\nId. at 321–22. Citizens United, a nonprofit corporation, pro-\nduced a film called Hillary: The Movie and wanted to make it\navailable by video-on-demand during the 2008 presidential\nprimaries in which then-Senator Hillary Clinton was a candi-\ndate.

CR 09-13\nwas submitted to the Legislative Council Rules Clearinghouse on\nFebruary 5, 2009. 638 Wis. Admin. Reg. 13 (Feb. 28, 2009).\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                               37\n\nseveral ads to air on broadcast and cable networks. Id. at 320.\nThe federal ban on corporate political speech made it a crime\nto disseminate the ads and the movie if they qualified as\nexpress advocacy or its equivalent, so Citizens United sued for\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, arguing that the corporate-\nspeech ban and the disclosure and disclaimer requirements for\nelectioneering communications were unconstitutional as\napplied to its speech. Id. at 321–22.\n    A three-judge district-court panel applied McConnell and\nrejected the challenge. Citizens United v. FEC, 530 F. Supp. 2d\n274 (D.D.C. 2008). The Supreme Court heard the case, then\nsurprised the political and legal worlds by ordering it rebriefed\non the question of the continued viability of McConnell. Citizens\nUnited, 558 U.S. at 322. Following reargument, the Court issued\nits course-changing decision in January 2010.\n    The Court began by holding that Hillary and the ads\npromoting it were the functional equivalent of express advo-\ncacy under Wisconsin Right to Life II and thus fell within\nBCRA’s ban on corporate electioneering communications. Id.\nat 324–25. This brought the full implications of McConnell’s\nfacial holding starkly into focus: If a movie sponsored by a\ncorporation could be banned during an election cycle, then so\ncould a book or a pamphlet. Id. at 333. The Court observed that\nbanning political expenditures by corporations is functionally\na total “ban on corporate speech,” even though “a PAC created\nby a corporation can still speak.” Id. at 337. “PACs are burden-\nsome alternatives … [,] expensive to administer and subject to\nextensive regulations,” id., and they must “comply with these\nregulations just to speak,” id. at 338. Because these regulatory\n\f38                              Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\nburdens are “onerous,” the PAC system is nearly “the equiva-\nlent of prior restraint.” Id. at 335. And because the law was “an\noutright ban, backed by criminal sanctions,” id. at 337, its\nchilling effect on core First Amendment speech rights was\nsevere, making ad hoc, as-applied remedies seriously deficient,\nid. at 335–37. Accordingly, the Court reconsidered and partially\noverruled McConnell, facially invalidating the ban on corporate\nand union election-related spending. Id. at 365–66 (also\noverruling Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U.S.\n652 (1990), on which McConnell had relied).\n    Importantly here, Citizens United restored some earlier\nunderstandings about the constitutional limits on the govern-\nment’s authority to regulate election-related speech. First, the\nCourt reinvigorated the principle that “political speech does\nnot lose First Amendment protection ‘simply because its source\nis a corporation,’” id. at 342 (quoting First Nat’l Bank of Bos. v.\nBellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 784 (1978)), and held as a categorical\nmatter that the government may not restrict political speech\n“based on a speaker’s corporate identity,” id. at 347. Second,\nthe Court held that the only public interest strong enough to\njustify restricting election-related speech is the interest in\npreventing quid pro quo corruption or the appearance of\ncorruption. Id. at 359–61. Third, the Court concluded that\npolitical spending by independent groups does not carry the\nrisk of this kind of corruption because “[b]y definition, an\nindependent expenditure is political speech presented to the\nelectorate that is not coordinated with a candidate.” Id. at 360.\nAccordingly, the Court held as a matter of law that “inde-\npendent expenditures, including those made by corporations,\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                   39\n\ndo not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.”\nId. at 357.\n   Without an anticorruption rationale to support it, BCRA’s\nban on corporate electioneering communications was facially\nunconstitutional: “No sufficient governmental interest justifies\nlimits on the political speech of nonprofit or for-profit\ncorporations.” Id. at 365.\n    The Court took a different approach to the disclaimer and\ndisclosure requirements, although this part of the opinion is\nquite brief. Following the doctrine established in Buckley, the\nCourt applied an intermediate standard of review—called\n“exacting scrutiny,” but the label isn’t important—and re-\nquired a showing of “a ‘substantial relation’ between the\ndisclosure requirement and a ‘sufficiently important’ govern-\nmental interest.” Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 366–67 (quoting\nBuckley, 424 U.S. at 64, 66). The public’s informational interest\nin knowing the sponsorship and funding sources of election-\nrelated ads had long been accepted as sufficiently important to\njustify disclosure and disclaimer rules. Id. at 367. So the only\nreal question in Citizens United was the closeness of the fit\nbetween that interest and the specific requirements imposed on\ngroups that sponsor electioneering communications. Id.\n    The federal disclaimer provision requires only that the ad\nidentify in a “clearly spoken manner” the name of the group\nresponsible for its content, display the group’s name and\naddress (or web address), and state that the ad is “not autho-\nrized by any candidate or candidate’s committee.” 2 U.S.C.\n§ 441d(d)(2), (a)(3); see also Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 366. This\nmodest requirement easily cleared the intermediate-scrutiny\n\f40                             Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\nhurdle. The Court held that the disclaimer was adequately\ntailored to serve the purpose of “provid[ing] the electorate\nwith information” and also “avoid confusion by making clear\nthat the ads are not funded by a candidate or political party.”\nCitizens United, 558 U.S. at 368 (upholding the disclaimer rule\nas applied to the ads); see also id. at 371 (summarily upholding\nthe disclaimer rule as applied to the movie).\n     The Court’s evaluation of the disclosure provision entailed\nlittle additional discussion. BCRA requires that “any person\nwho spends more than $10,000 on electioneering communica-\ntions within a calendar year” must file a disclosure statement\nwith the FEC identifying “the person making the expenditure,\nthe amount of the expenditure, the election to which the\ncommunication was directed, and the names of certain contri-\nbutors [donors who contributed $1,000 or more to the\nexpenditure].” Id. at 366 (citing 2 U.S.C. § 434(f)(1)–(2)). This\none-time, event-driven disclosure rule is far less burdensome\nthan the comprehensive registration and reporting system\nimposed on political committees; the Court upheld it without\nmuch comment. Id. at 368–69 (upholding the disclosure rule\nwith respect to the ads); see also id. at 371 (summarily uphold-\ning the disclosure rule with respect to the movie). The Court\ndid, however, affirmatively reject the argument that the\ndisclosure rule for electioneering communications should be\nlimited to speech that is the functional equivalent of express\nadvocacy. Id. at 369 (“[W]e reject Citizens United’s contention\nthat the disclosure requirements must be limited to speech that\nis the functional equivalent of express advocacy.”). It’s not\nclear why the Court addressed this argument; it had earlier\nconcluded that Hillary and the ads promoting it were the\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                       41\n\nequivalent of express advocacy, so this argument no longer\nmattered. Id. at 324–25.\n    Finally, the Court reaffirmed that the disclosure require-\nment might be unconstitutional as applied to particular groups\n“if there were a reasonable probability that the group’s\nmembers would face threats, harassment, or reprisals if their\nnames were disclosed.” Id. at 370 (citing McConnell, 540 U.S. at\n198). Citizens United had no such evidence, so there was no\nimpediment to applying the disclosure rule to it. Id.\n\n\nG. Wisconsin Regulators React\n    Citizens United has obvious and significant implications for\nChapter 11, so it comes as a bit of a surprise that the Wisconsin\nlegislature has not amended the statute to account for the\nchanges wrought by the decision. The GAB has not been\nsimilarly silent.\n    In response to Citizens United, the Board immediately\nannounced that it would not enforce section 11.38(1)(a)1, the\nstatutory ban on corporate political expenditures.12 The agency\nthen promulgated an emergency rule suspending the statutory\nban and creating a new category of political speakers—\n“independent disbursement organizations”—that would\nthenceforward be subject to the organizational, registration,\nand reporting requirements of Chapter 11. The emergency rule,\n\n\n12\n   See GAB, Open Session M inutes (M ar. 23–24, 2010), http://gab.wi.gov/\nsites/default/files/event/74/03_23_24_10_open_session_minutes_final_pdf_\n20361.pdf.\n\f42                                 Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\nGAB § 1.91, is completely new; it was approved on May 10,\n2010, and became effective ten days later.13 It remained in effect\nfor 150 days and was eligible for several extensions while the\nagency held public hearings on a permanent rule. See generally\nWIS. STAT. § 227.24. The extensions were approved, and the\nfinal rule became effective on July 1, 2012, while this litigation\nwas underway. 678 Wis. Admin. Reg. 43 (June 30, 2012).\n     Briefly, the new rule suspends section 11.38(1)(a)1, the\nstatutory ban on political spending by corporations, “until such\ntime as a court having jurisdiction in the State of Wisconsin\nrules that a corporation … may constitutionally be restricted\nfrom making an independent disbursement.” WIS. ADMIN .\nCODE GAB § 1.91(2). The rule also requires every “organiza-\ntion” that independently raises and spends money for political\nspeech to comply with the registration and reporting require-\nments applicable to political committees. See id. § 1.91(3)–(8).\nMore specifically, the rule applies most PAC duties to organi-\nzations that ”accept[] contributions for, incur obligations for, or\nmak[e] an independent disbursement exceeding $25 in aggre-\ngate during a calendar year.” Id. § 1.91(3); see id. § 1.91(4)–(8).\n“Organization” is not a statutory term; the rule defines it\nbroadly to include any person (including any association,\npartnership, or corporation), but not individuals and commit-\ntees already required to register and report under Chapter 11.\nId. § 1.91(1)(g)–(h). Though lengthy, GAB § 1.91 is central to the\nclaims in this case; we reproduce it in full in the appendix.\n\n\n13\n See GAB, Open Session M inutes (M ay 10, 2010), http://gab.wi.gov/sites/\ndefault/files/event/74/05_10_10_open_session_m inutes_final_pdf_16560.\npdf; 653 Wis.

Much Litigation Ensues\n    The two new rules were controversial and obvious candi-\ndates for constitutional challenge. Within a fortnight three\nlawsuits were filed seeking injunctive relief against one or both\nof the rules. The first was Wisconsin Club for Growth, Inc. v.\nMyse, a federal action filed in the Western District of Wiscon-\nsin. The plaintiffs there challenged GAB § 1.28 on two grounds:\n(1) the agency lacked the statutory authority to expand the\nscope of the statutory scheme; and (2) the new rule is over-\nbroad and impermissibly burdens free-speech rights in\nviolation of the First Amendment. See Complaint at 13–17, Wis.\nClub for Growth, Inc. v. Myse, No. 10-cv-427-wmc (W.D. Wis.\nfiled July 31, 2010).\n    Wisconsin Right to Life filed this suit in the Eastern District\na few days later. The third suit was an original action initiated\nin the state supreme court. See Wis. Prosperity Network v. Myse,\n810 N.W.2d 356 (Wis. 2012). Filed on August 9, 2010, the\noriginal action raised essentially the same claims as the\nWisconsin Club for Growth litigation. The state high court\nimmediately issued an order enjoining enforcement of GAB\n§ 1.28 pending further review. Id. at 356–57.\n   That move affected the two federal cases; all three lawsuits\nchallenged GAB § 1.28. This case challenges many other laws\nas well, but the district judge abstained to await the outcome\n\n\n14\n     Subsection (4), not relevant here, has been omitted.\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                47\n\nof the original action in the state supreme court, putting all the\nclaims on indefinite hold. Barland I, 664 F.3d at 143.\n    Meanwhile, over in the Western District, the Board swiftly\nthrew in the towel. Less than two weeks after Wisconsin Club\nfor Growth was filed, the parties stipulated to the entry of final\njudgment, agreeing that the court “may enter a permanent\ninjunction, order, and judgment enjoining the application or\nenforcement of the second sentence of Wis. Admin. GAB\n§ 1.28(3)(b).” Stipulation, Wis. Club for Growth,\nNo. 10-cv-427-wmc, ECF No. 22-1. (To remind the reader: The\nsecond sentence of § 1.28(3)(b) is a conclusive presumption that\nalmost anything said about a candidate in any medium of\npublic expression within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a\ngeneral election counts as a communication made for a\n“political purpose,” triggering political-committee status and\nthe other restrictions and requirements of Chapter 11.) The\nstipulation expressly resolved the first claim in the case, which\nhad challenged § 1.28 as ultra vires. If the court accepted the\nstipulation, the plaintiffs agreed to dismiss their First Amend-\nment claim without prejudice.\n    The court did not accept the stipulation. The judge in the\nWestern District opted to abstain in favor of the state supreme\ncourt, as his colleague in the Eastern District had done. See Wis.\nClub for Growth, Inc. v. Myse, No. 10-cv-427-wmc, 2010 WL\n4024932, at *6–7 (W.D. Wis. Oct. 13, 2010). With both federal\nactions stayed and the state supreme court’s place-holding\ninjunction casting significant doubt on the new rule, the Board\nwent back to the drawing board and promulgated an\n\f48                                 Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\nemergency rule eliminating the questionable second sentence\nof GAB § 1.28(3)(b).15\n                               *   *   *\n    The following year was an extraordinary one in Wisconsin\npolitical history, as we explained in Barland I and need not\nrepeat here. 664 F.3d at 144–45. In anticipation of unprece-\ndented legislative recall elections, the Wisconsin Right to Life\nState PAC returned to the district court and sought relief from\nthe stay for the limited purpose of litigating its challenge to\nsection 11.26(4), the aggregate limit on annual contributions to\ncandidates, parties, and political committees. Id. at 145. The\ndistrict judge declined to lift the stay, but we vacated and\nremanded. Id. at 154–55. Citizens United had categorically\nremoved the anticorruption rationale as a justification for\ncampaign-finance restrictions on independent political groups.\nThis left “no valid governmental interest sufficient to justify\nimposing limits on fundraising by independent-expenditure\norganizations.” Id. at 154. We found the aggregate contribution\nlimit unconstitutional as applied to independent-expenditure\ngroups and their donors and instructed the district court to\nenter a permanent injunction enjoining its enforcement. Id. at\n155.\n   The rest of the case remained stayed pending resolution of\nthe original action in the state supreme court, but that court\n\n\n15\n  See M emorandum from Kevin J.

With one justice recused, the court\nsplit 3–3, and on March 19, 2012, issued a per curiam order\nvacating the injunction and dismissing the original action. See\nWis. Prosperity Network, 810 N.W.2d at 357. Several months\nearlier, however, the GAB had approved a permanent rule\nremoving the problematic second sentence of § 1.28(3)(b).16 But\nthe new rule remains mired in the administrative process and\nis not yet on the books. The emergency rule has now expired,17\nso the 2010 version of GAB § 1.28 continues in effect.\n                                *    *   *\n    Neither party saw fit to bring the regulatory and litigation\nhistory of GAB § 1.28 to our attention until we asked about it\nin a supplemental briefing order. This was chiefly the responsi-\nbility of the Board’s counsel, an experienced lawyer in the state\nDepartment of Justice. In his supplemental brief, he explained\nthat it would “[not] have been helpful … to go into this\nhistory” because “the history has become moot.” That’s an\nastonishing statement. History does not “become moot.” And\nthe Board’s retreat from the 2010 rule—the rapid stipulation in\nWisconsin Club for Growth, the emergency rule, and the revised\npermanent rule—strongly suggest a concession that § 1.28 is\nultra vires, and perhaps also that it is unconstitutional. Forced\n\n\n16\n  See GAB, Open Session M inutes (Dec. 13, 2011), http://gab.wi.gov/sites/\ndefault/files/event/74/12_13_11_open_session_minutes_signed_pdf_62545.\npdf; 669 Wis. Admin. Reg. 13 (Sept. 14, 2011) (Statement of Scope).\n\n17\n  The emergency rule expired on October 3, 2011. 668 Wis. Admin. Reg. 5\n(Aug. 14, 2011) (extending the rule through October 3; no further extension\ngranted).\n\f50                              Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\nto come forward with this information, counsel now represents\nthat the Board “intends to continue to honor the stipulation” in\nWisconsin Club for Growth, whatever that means.\n    This background should have been raised in the Board’s\ninitial brief. Now that we have it, we’re not sure what to make\nof counsel’s belated representation that the Board “intends to\ncontinue to honor the stipulation.” The Board has not acted on\nthis intent, at least as far as we’re told, and counsel’s statement\nis in any event vague. The stipulation was never reduced to\njudgment. Order, Wis. Club for Growth, No. 10-cv-427-wmc,\nECF No. 46 (filed on Feb. 28, 2013) (dismissing case). Political\nspeakers in Wisconsin can’t rely on the agency’s unofficial\nexpression of intent to refrain from enforcing its rules. The 2010\nversion of GAB § 1.28 remains in force and encumbers the free-\nspeech rights of anyone who says almost anything about a\ncandidate near an election. We must judge the Board’s actions,\nnot its inchoate intent.\n                            *    *   *\n    After the state supreme court deadlocked, Wisconsin Right\nto Life roused this case from its slumber, filed an amended\ncomplaint, and moved for a preliminary injunction on the rest\nof its claims, which challenge the following statutes and rules:\n     • Section 11.38(1), the ban on political spending by\n       corporations;\n     • Section 11.38(1)(a)3, the cap on the amount a corpora-\n       tion may spend to raise money for an affiliated political\n       committee;\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                              51\n\n   • Sections 11.01(4) (defining “committee” and “political\n     committee”), 11.01(6) (defining “contribution”), 11.01(7)\n     (defining “disbursement”), and 11.01(16) (defining\n     “political purposes”), to the extent that these definitions\n     trigger (either independently or with the administrative\n     rules) PAC status and other restrictions and require-\n     ments for independent groups not under the control of\n     a candidate or candidate’s committee and not engaged\n     in express election advocacy as their major purpose;\n   • The two new administrative rules—GAB §§ 1.28 and\n     1.91—promulgated in the wake of Citizens United to\n     expand the scope of the regulatory scheme and impose\n     PAC status or PAC-like duties and restrictions on newly\n     liberated independent political speakers;\n   • Sections 11.12(5)–(6), the 24-hour-reporting requirement\n     for certain late contributions and expenditures (recently\n     amended to enlarge the reporting time to 48 hours);\n   • Section 11.06(7), which requires any independent group\n     that wants to spend money to support or oppose a\n     candidate for state or local office to file an oath affirm-\n     ing that the spending is not coordinated with the\n     candidate or the candidate’s agent (a related administra-\n     tive rule, GAB § 1.42(1), is also challenged); and\n   • GAB § 1.42(5), which requires that independent political\n     communications include a lengthy disclaimer.\n    In an oral ruling, the district judge granted the motion in\npart. The judge agreed that the plaintiffs had “some likelihood\nof success” on their claim that section 11.38(1)(a)1, the ban on\n\f52                                  Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\ncorporate political speech, was unconstitutional “as applied\n… and facially.” He also agreed that the lengthy disclaimer for\nindependent political messages—GAB § 1.42(5)—was “unduly\nburdensome” as applied to “ads less than 30 seconds in length”\nand enjoined it to that extent. The judge held that the challenge\nto GAB § 1.91 was moot and otherwise denied preliminary\ninjunctive relief.\n    In a written order memorializing this ruling, the court\nentered a preliminary injunction “as to count nine … with\nrespect to the corporate disbursement ban” and also “as to\ncount five … with respect to ads that are less than 30 seconds\nin length.” In all other respects, the court denied the motion for\na preliminary injunction. Wisconsin Right to Life appealed.18\nSee 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1) (authorizing an interlocutory appeal\nfrom an order granting or denying an injunction).\n\n\n\n\n18\n  Actually, Wisconsin Right to Life filed three notices of appeal. The first\n(No. 12-2915) is an appeal from a claimed “constructive denial” of the\nmotion for a preliminary injunction; that appeal was premature and is\ndismissed. The second (No. 12-3046) is an appeal from the district court’s\norder granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs’ motion for a\npreliminary injunction; that appeal is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1).\nThe third (No. 12-3158) is an appeal from the district court’s order denying\nan injunction pending appeal, but the plaintiffs did not seek an injunction\npending appeal in this court; that appeal is dismissed.\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                  53\n\n                           II. Analysis\nA. Rule 65(d)(1)\n    Although the parties have not raised it, we note a flaw in\nthe form of the district court’s injunction order. Rule 65\nrequires that every injunction order must “state the reasons\nwhy it issued,” “state its terms specifically,” and “describe in\nreasonable detail—and not by referring to the complaint or\nother document—the act or acts restrained or required.” FED .\nR. CIV . P. 65(d)(1). The court’s written order summarily enters\na preliminary injunction “with respect to” certain parts of\ncount five and count nine, which are only very generally\ndescribed. That’s not a proper injunction order. A reader\nwould have to consult the pleadings and a transcript of the\nhearing to learn the scope of the injunction. On remand the\ndistrict court will have to enter a new injunction to conform to\nthis opinion and should take care to comply with the specificity\nrequirements of Rule 65(d)(1).\n\n\nB. Injunction Standards\n    To obtain a preliminary injunction, the moving party must\nshow that it has “(1) no adequate remedy at law and will suffer\nirreparable harm if a preliminary injunction is denied and\n(2) some likelihood of success on the merits.” Ezell v. City of\nChicago, 651 F.3d 684, 694 (7th Cir. 2011). If this showing is\nmade, “the court weighs the competing harms to the parties if\nan injunction is granted or denied and also considers the public\ninterest.” Korte v. Sebelius, 735 F.3d 654, 665 (7th Cir. 2013). The\n“equitable balancing proceeds on a sliding-scale analysis; the\n\f54                             Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\ngreater the likelihood of success on the merits, the less heavily\nthe balance of harms must tip in the moving party’s favor.” Id.\n    In First Amendment cases, however, the likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits is usually the decisive factor. “[T]he loss\nof First Amendment freedoms … unquestionably constitutes\nirreparable injury,” and “injunctions protecting First Amend-\nment freedoms are always in the public interest.” ACLU v.\nAlvarez, 679 F.3d 583, 589, 590 (7th Cir. 2012) (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). On the merits questions, “the burdens at\nthe preliminary injunction stage track the burdens at trial.”\nGonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal,\n546 U.S. 418, 429 (2006). Here, the Board bears the burden of\njustifying the regulatory scheme: “When the Government\nrestricts speech, the Government bears the burden of proving\nthe constitutionality of its actions.” McCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at\n1452 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n    This case is only nominally in a “preliminary” stage. The\nclaims have been tested through several rounds of briefing\nboth in the district court and on appeal. Multiple statutes and\nrules are challenged, both facially and “as applied,” but few of\nthe claims depend on specific application facts. See Ezell,\n651 F.3d at 697 (“In a facial constitutional challenge, individual\napplication facts do not matter.”). There are no factual disputes\nfor trial. We are confronted with purely legal questions, which\nwe review de novo. See Korte, 735 F.3d at 665. As in Barland I,\nour resolution of the disputed legal issues has the effect of\nrequiring the entry of a permanent injunction enjoining the\nenforcement of the unconstitutional provisions. 664 F.3d at 155.\nIndeed, the Board concedes that some of the challenged\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                 55\n\nstatutes and rules are unconstitutional or require a limiting\nconstruction, so we start there.\n\n\nC. Concessions of Unconstitutionality\n   1. Section 11.38(1)(a)1, the Ban on Corporate Political\n   Expenditures\n    The Board concedes, as it must, that Wisconsin’s ban on\ncorporate political expenditures, section 11.38(1)(a)1, is facially\nunconstitutional. The state law is indistinguishable from the\nfederal statute at issue in Citizens United and must suffer the\nsame fate. See Am. Tradition P’ship v. Bullock, 132 S. Ct. 2490,\n2491 (2012) (per curiam) (applying Citizens United to invalidate\na similar Montana statute). As we have noted, soon after\nCitizens United was decided, the Board promulgated a rule\neffectively acknowledging the statute’s unconstitutionality,\nalthough authorizing its enforcement if a court were to declare\nit constitutional. See GAB § 1.91(2).\n    There “can be no serious doubt” that “the holding of\nCitizens United applies to the [Wisconsin] state law.” Am.\nTradition P’ship, 132 S. Ct. at 2491. The district court\npreliminarily enjoined the enforcement of the statute. On\nremand the injunction against section 11.38(1)(a)1 should be\nmade permanent.\n\f56                             Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\n     2. Section 11.38(1)(a)3, the Cap on Corporate Fundraising\n     for an Affiliated PAC\n    The Board also agrees that section 11.38(1)(a)3 is unconsti-\ntutional. That subsection of the statute caps the amount a\ncorporation may spend to solicit contributions to an affiliated\nPAC. Originally set at $500, the cap was recently raised to\n$20,000 or 20% of the prior year’s contributions. See 2013 Wis.\nAct 153 § 21m. The amendment does not affect the constitu-\ntional analysis. The statute is plainly unconstitutional under\nthe rationale of Citizens United and our decision in Barland I, as\nthe Board concedes. But the district court did not enjoin it.\n    The Board’s counsel advises us that the Board will not\nenforce the statute against Wisconsin Right to Life and its state\nPAC, but the no-enforcement pledge is good for them only, not\nother independent groups in Wisconsin. This appellate\nconcession raises a question about whether Wisconsin Right to\nLife continues to have standing on this claim. A preenforce-\nment challenge requires a credible threat of prosecution,\nSchirmer v. Nagode, 621 F.3d 581, 586 (7th Cir. 2010), which\nordinarily ceases to exist “when a state agency acknowledges\nthat it will not enforce a statute because it is plainly unconsti-\ntutional,” Schober, 366 F.3d at 492. Even if the plaintiff’s\nstanding was secure when the case was filed, a controversy can\nbecome moot if the threat of prosecution has evaporated.\nWinsness v. Yocom, 433 F.3d 727, 736 (10th Cir. 2006).\n    On the other hand, a case does not become moot merely\nbecause the defendants have stopped engaging in unlawful\nactivity. “[A] defendant claiming that its voluntary compliance\nmoots a case bears the formidable burden of showing that it is\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                57\n\nabsolutely clear the allegedly wrongful behavior could not\nreasonably be expected to recur.” Friends of the Earth, Inc. v.\nLaidlaw Envtl. Servs., Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 190 (2000). The Board\nhasn’t raised the voluntary-cessation doctrine, and its inconsis-\ntent and shifting positions do not give us much confidence in\nits representation that it will not enforce the statute. By not\nfully disclaiming the right to enforce this facially invalid\nstatute, the Board’s halfhearted concession leaves us with no\nassurance that it will continue to recognize its unconstitutional-\nity.\n    To repeat what we said in Barland I: “[A]fter Citizens United\nthere is no valid governmental interest sufficient to justify\nimposing limits on fundraising by independent-expenditure\norganizations.” 664 F.3d at 154. The statute is unconstitutional\non its face, so it cannot be enforced against anyone. Accordingly,\non remand section 11.38(1)(a)3 should be permanently en-\njoined.\n\n\n   3. GAB § 1.42(5), the Lengthy Regulatory Disclaimer\n   The Board also admits that GAB § 1.42(5), the wordy\nregulatory disclaimer, is unconstitutional as applied to 30-\nsecond radio ads. The extra verbiage required by the rule goes\nwell beyond the short disclaimer required by statute. But it\nsimply repeats—in 50 extra words—the very same point: that\nthe political message was not authorized by a candidate or a\n\f58                                        Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\ncandidate’s agent or committee.19 The Board has not identified\nany regulatory purpose for the extra words, which consume a\nsignificant amount of paid advertising time in a broadcast ad.\nWe’re told that for television ads the regulatory disclaimer\nmay appear in written form and need not be spoken. Wiscon-\nsin Right to Life has challenged the rule only as applied to 30-\nsecond radio ads, and the Board has conceded that claim. In\nlight of this concession, the Board hasn’t offered any reason for\nthe long and repetitive regulatory disclaimer, and frankly we\ncan’t see the point of requiring it in ads of any length. But the\nclaim is limited to 30-second radio ads.\n    The district court granted a preliminary injunction on this\nclaim, but we note an error in the court’s written order, which\nenjoins GAB § 1.42(5) “with respect to ads that are less than\n30 seconds in length.” (Emphasis added.) Everyone understood\nthat the claim concerned 30-second ads; while this implicitly\nincludes ads of shorter duration, the injunction should not be\nlimited to ads of “less than” 30 seconds. On remand the court\n\n\n\n\n19\n  The disclaimer required by statute is: “Not authorized by any candidate\nor candidate’s agent or committee.” W IS . S TAT . § 11.30(2)(d). The disclaimer\nrequired by the rule is:\n\n         The committee (individual) is the sole source of this\n         communication and the committee (individual) did not act\n         in cooperation or consultation with, and in concert with, or\n         at the request or suggestion of any candidate or any agent\n         or authorized committee of a candidate who is supported\n         or opposed by this communication.\n\nW IS .

Section 11.01(16), the Statutory Definition of “Political\n     Purposes,” and GAB § 1.28(1), the Regulatory Definition of\n     “Political Committee”\n   The Board also agrees that the statutory definition of\n“political purposes,” which triggers PAC duties and other\nrequirements and restrictions, is vague and overbroad in the\nsense meant by Buckley and requires a limiting construction.20\nThe Board likewise agrees that the regulatory definition of\n“political committee” is similarly vague and overbroad and\nmust be narrowly construed.\n    Section 11.01(16) provides that “[a]n act is for ‘political\npurposes’ when it is done for the purpose of influencing the\nelection or nomination for election of any individual to state or\nlocal office,” or “for the purpose of influencing the recall from or\nretention in office of an individual holding a state or local\noffice,” or “attempting to influence an endorsement or nomina-\ntion to be made at a convention of political party members.”\n\n\n\n20\n  Again, Chapter 11 is structured so that political-committee requirements\nand the other prescriptions and proscriptions of the regulatory scheme are\ntriggered indirectly, by the making of contributions and disbursements. See\nW IS . S TAT . § 11.01(4) (defining “committee”); § 11.01(6) (“contribution”);\n§ 11.01(7) (“disbursement”); § 11.05 (requiring registration); § 11.06\n(reporting); §§ 11.12 and 11.16 (permitting only a registered treasurer to\nreceive contributions or make disbursements); § 11.26 (limiting contribu-\ntions).\n\f60                            Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\nWIS. STAT . § 11.01(16), (16)(a)2 (emphases added). GAB\n§ 1.28(1)(a) provides that “‘[p]olitical committee’ means every\ncommittee which is formed primarily to influence elections or\nwhich is under the control of a candidate.” GAB 1.28(1)(a)\n(emphasis added).\n    The “influence an election” language in both definitions\nraises the same vagueness and overbreadth concerns that were\npresent in federal law at the time of Buckley. The Court held\nthat this kind of broad and imprecise language risks chilling\nissue advocacy, which may not be regulated; the same reason-\ning applies here. The Board acknowledges as much and\nsuggests a limiting construction to confine the definitions to\nexpress advocacy and its functional equivalent. That’s how the\nAttorney General and the state supreme court have under-\nstood the statute. See Wis. Mfrs. & Commerce, 597 N.W.2d at\n728–31; 65 Op. Atty. Gen. 145.\n    As we’ve noted, after Buckley the legislature amended the\nstatutory definition of “political purposes” to incorporate an\nexpress-advocacy limitation. But the broad “influencing”\nlanguage remains in the statute, and the express-advocacy\nlimitation carries some residual vagueness and overbreadth:\n“Acts which are for ‘political purposes’ include but are not\nlimited to … [t]he making of a communication which expressly\nadvocates the election, defeat, recall or retention of a clearly\nidentified candidate … .” WIS. STAT . § 11.01(16)(a)1 (emphasis\nadded). The “not limited to” language holds the potential for\nregulatory mischief. Perhaps it was included to leave room for\nregulation of the “functional equivalent” of express advocacy\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                          61\n\nas that term was later explained in Wisconsin Right to Life II.21\nBeyond that, however, the language contains persistent\nvagueness and overbreadth.\n    As federal judges “we are ‘without power to adopt a\nnarrowing construction of a state statute unless such a con-\nstruction is reasonable and readily apparent.’” Stenberg v.\nCarhart, 530 U.S. 914, 944 (2000) (quoting Boos v. Barry, 485 U.S.\n312, 330 (1988)). The “unless” clause in this important federal-\nism principle should be invoked sparingly and with caution. A\nfederal court cannot “make a binding interpretation of a state\nstatute, endeavoring to trim its vague provisions; if it attempts\na narrowing interpretation that deviates widely from the\nstatute’s apparent meaning it is taking a big risk that the state\nwill reject the interpretation.” Ctr. for Individual Freedom v.\nMadigan, 697 F.3d 464, 500 (7th Cir. 2012) (Posner, J., concur-\nring in part and dissenting in part). The alternative is to strike\nthe statute and let the state legislature or the state supreme\ncourt bring it into conformity with the federal Constitution.\n    We’re confident that the proposed narrowing construction\nis reasonable, readily apparent, and likely to be approved by\nthe state courts. The state’s highest court and its Attorney\n\n\n21\n  The “not limited to” language may have been included to account for the\nfact that the definition of “political purposes” applies comprehensively to\ncandidates, their connected committees, parties, independent groups, and\nindividuals. Communications by candidates and their connected commit-\ntees obviously are “unambiguously related to the campaign” of a\nparticular candidate. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 80 (1976). As applied to\npolitical speech by noncandidates and outside groups, however, the\ndefinition raises vagueness and overbreadth concerns.\n\f62                             Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\nGeneral have acknowledged that when Chapter 11 is applied\nbeyond candidates, their committees, and political parties, it\nmust be narrowly construed to comply with Buckley’s express-\nadvocacy limitation; the administration of the state’s\ncampaign-finance system has generally reflected this under-\nstanding for many decades. Accordingly, we accept the\nproposed narrowing construction. As applied to political\nspeakers other than candidates, their committees, and political\nparties, the statutory definition of “political purposes” in\nsection 11.01(16) and the regulatory definition of “political\ncommittee” in GAB § 1.28(1)(a) are limited to express advocacy\nand its functional equivalent as those terms were explained in\nBuckley and Wisconsin Right to Life II.\n\n\nD. Other Provisions\n     1. GAB § 1.28 and GAB § 1.91\n    Wisconsin Right to Life argues that GAB §§ 1.28 and 1.91\nunconstitutionally expand the reach of the regulatory scheme\nby imposing political-committee status and other restrictions\non groups engaged in issue advocacy and “PAC-like” burdens\non independent political groups not engaged in express\nadvocacy or its equivalent as their major purpose. The argu-\nment is fuzzy, but we understand it to be twofold: (1) the rules\ncast too wide a net by capturing unregulable issue advocacy,\neither explicitly or by introducing uncertainty; and (2) the rules\nimpermissibly impose PAC status or “PAC-like” burdens on\nissue-advocacy groups not engaged in express advocacy as\ntheir major purpose. The complaints overlap, and both are\nvalid.\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                63\n\n     As we’ve explained, the 2010 version of GAB § 1.28 deleted\nthe express-advocacy limitation in the old rule and added\nlanguage specifically designed to bring issue advocacy within\nthe scope of the state’s PAC regulatory system. That was the\nexplicit goal; the Board sought to do by regulation what state\nlawmakers had failed to do by legislation. Under GAB § 1.28,\nall independent political speakers—individuals and all types\nof organizational associations—are “subject to the applicable\nrequirements of ch. 11, Stats, when they … [m]ake a communi-\ncation for a political purpose.” GAB § 1.28(2)(c). The rule\ndefines “communication” and “political purpose” quite\nexpansively.\n    “‘Communication’ means any printed advertisement,\nbillboard, handbill, sample ballot, television or radio advertise-\nment, telephone call, e-mail, internet posting, and any other\nform of communication that may be utilized for a political\npurpose.” Id. § 1.28(1)(b). This goes well beyond the federal\ndefinition of electioneering communications, which includes\nonly “broadcast, cable, or satellite communication,” 2 U.S.C.\n§ 434(f)(3)(A)(i), and requires disclosure only when the\nexpenditure exceeds $10,000, id. § 434(f)(1).\n    The definition of “political purpose” is similarly compre-\nhensive. No longer confined to express advocacy and its\nfunctional equivalent, the rule covers any communication made\nwithin 30 days of a primary, or 60 days of a general election,\nthat names or depicts a “clearly identified candidate” and\nrefers to the candidate’s “personal qualities, character, or\nfitness” or “supports or condemns” the candidate’s record or\n“position or stance on issues.” GAB § 1.28(3)(b). Any\n\f64                             Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\ncommunication of this type is conclusively treated as an\n“appeal to vote,” see id., thus triggering political-committee\nstatus and other statutory and regulatory restrictions if the\nvery low contribution or spending threshold is crossed.\n    The rule is fatally vague and overbroad in several respects.\nFirst, it sweeps a far wider universe of political speech into the\n“applicable requirements of chap. 11, Stats.” than does\nChapter 11 itself, introducing confusion for ordinary political\nspeakers who lack the background or assistance of a campaign-\nfinance lawyer. In this regard, it may also exceed the Board’s\nregulatory authority. The rule goes beyond the bounds of the\nstatute itself, which under Buckley and Wisconsin Right to Life II\nmust be narrowly construed to apply only to independent\nspending for express advocacy and its functional equivalent, as\nthe Board has acknowledged. The ultra vires objection was\nbefore the state supreme court in Wisconsin Prosperity Network\nand was also raised in Wisconsin Club for Growth. In the federal\ncase, the Board conceded the claim. In the state supreme court,\nhowever, the Board took a different position, defending its\nauthority to enlarge the scope of the statutory scheme.\n    On the regulatory side of things, the agency’s position also\nhas shifted. When the rule was initially challenged, the Board\nissued an emergency rule removing the objectionable second\nsentence of subsection (3)(b)—the conclusive presumption that\ntreats all issue advocacy during the 30/60-day preelection\nperiods as express advocacy. With the emergency rule in place,\nthe Board began the process of making the scaled-back rule\npermanent. In the meantime, however, the emergency rule\nexpired, and the revised permanent rule has not yet run the\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                               65\n\nadministrative gauntlet. So the 2010 rule remains in force and\nthe Board defends it here, despite its checkered history and\nserious doubt about the agency’s statutory authority to\nregulate this broadly.\n    Setting aside the ultra vires question, which is not specifi-\ncally raised, the second sentence of subsection (3)(b) is uncon-\nstitutionally vague and overbroad in the sense meant by\nBuckley. In the First Amendment context, the doctrines of\nvagueness and overbreadth overlap; both are premised on\nconcerns about chilling constitutionally protected speech.\nKolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 359 n.8 (1983) (explaining that\nin free-speech law “vagueness and overbreadth [are] logically\nrelated and similar doctrines”). Generally speaking, “[v]ague-\nness doctrine rests on concerns about fair notice and arbitrary\nenforcement.” United States v. Jones, 689 F.3d 696, 701 (7th Cir.\n2012). All laws must be clear and precise enough to give a\nperson of ordinary intelligence fair notice about what is\nrequired of him and also to guard against the arbitrary and\ndiscriminatory exercise of enforcement discretion. See FCC v.\nFox Television Stations, Inc., 132 S. Ct. 2307, 2317 (2012).\n   Regulations on speech, however, must meet a higher\nstandard of clarity and precision. In the First Amendment\ncontext, “rigorous adherence to [these] requirements is\nnecessary to ensure that ambiguity does not chill protected\nspeech.” Id. Vague or overbroad speech regulations carry an\nunacceptable risk that speakers will self-censor, so the First\nAmendment requires more vigorous judicial scrutiny. See\nSmith v. Goguen, 415 U.S. 566, 573 (1974) (explaining that where\n\f66                             Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\na law reaches protected expression, “the doctrine demands a\ngreater degree of specificity than in other contexts”).\n    Ordinarily when a law is facially challenged on vagueness\nand overbreadth grounds, the “court’s first task is to determine\nwhether the enactment reaches a substantial amount of\nconstitutionally protected” speech. Village of Hoffman Estates v.\nFlipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 494 (1982). Put\nsomewhat differently, a statute will be struck down as facially\noverbroad if it “punishes a ‘substantial’ amount of protected\nfree speech, ‘judged in relation to the statute’s plainly legiti-\nmate sweep.’” Virginia v. Hicks, 539 U.S. 113, 118–19 (2003)\n(quoting Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 615 (1973)).\n   But campaign-finance laws operate in a core free-speech\nzone and directly target protected speech. In this context, we\ndon’t need to ask whether the challenged law reaches a\nsubstantial amount of protected speech; by definition, it does,\nbecause all political speech is protected. That’s precisely why\nBuckley held that the “‘government may regulate in th[is] area\nonly with narrow specificity,’” 424 U.S. at 41 n.48 (quoting\nButton, 371 U.S. at 433), and drew the constitutional line at\nexpress election advocacy. So the more focused inquiry here is\nwhether this regulation steers clear of the line drawn in\nBuckley.\n   Plainly it does not. For some campaign-finance laws,\nhowever, Citizens United has relaxed Buckley’s express-\nadvocacy boundary line. As we’ve explained, the Court\ndeclined to apply the express-advocacy limitation to the\nfederal disclosure and disclaimer requirements for electioneer-\ning communications. Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 369. This was\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                67\n\ndicta. The Court had already concluded that Hillary and the\nads promoting it were the equivalent of express advocacy. Still,\nthe Supreme Court’s dicta must be respected, see United States\nv. Skoien, 614 F.3d 638, 641 (7th Cir. 2010) (en banc), and on the\nstrength of this part of Citizens United, we said in Madigan that\nthe “distinction between express advocacy and issue discussion\ndoes not apply in the disclosure context,” 697 F.3d at 484.\n    This aspect of Citizens United must be understood in proper\ncontext. The Court’s language relaxing the express-advocacy\nlimitation applies only to the specifics of the disclosure\nrequirement at issue there. The Court was addressing the one-\ntime, event-driven disclosure rule for federal electioneering\ncommunications, see 2 U.S.C. § 434(f), a far more modest\ndisclosure requirement than the comprehensive, continuous\nreporting regime imposed on federal PACs, see id. § 434(a)–(b),\nor even the less burdensome disclosure rule for independent\nexpenditures, see id. § 434(c). When the Court said that\n“disclosure is a less restrictive alternative to more comprehen-\nsive regulations of speech,” Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 369, it\nwas talking about the disclosure requirement for electioneering\ncommunications. In that specific context, the Court declined to\napply the express-advocacy limiting principle. But nothing in\nCitizens United suggests that the Court was tossing out the\nexpress-advocacy limitation for all disclosure systems, no\nmatter how burdensome. To the contrary, the Court spent\nseveral pages explaining that a corporation’s option to form an\naffiliated PAC is too burdensome to justify banning the\ncorporation itself from speaking. Id. at 337–39.\n\f68                              Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\n    Lifting the express-advocacy limitation more broadly\nwould have been a major departure from Buckley and is not\nlikely to have been left implicit. Citizens United approved\nevent-driven disclosure for federal electioneering communi-\ncations—large broadcast ad buys close to an election. In that\nspecific and narrow context, the Court declined to enforce\nBuckley’s express-advocacy limitation, but it went no further\nthan that.\n   So it’s a mistake to read Citizens United as giving the\ngovernment a green light to impose political-committee status\non every person or group that makes a communication about\na political issue that also refers to a candidate. That’s what\nGAB § 1.28(3)(b) does. During the 30/60-day preelection\nperiods, all political speech about issues counts as express\nadvocacy—thus triggering full political-committee status and\nother restrictions—if the speaker names and says pretty much\nanything at all about a candidate for state or local office.\n    This is a serious chill on debate about public issues, which\ndoes not stop during election season. Consider two neighbors\nwho want to print and distribute flyers encouraging support\nfor a municipal or school project in their city. If they do so\nwithin the 30/60-day preelection periods, they can’t mention\nthe positions of any local official running for reelection—say\nthe mayor or members of the city council or the school\nboard—for fear of being deemed a political committee and\nrequired to organize, register, and file regular financial reports.\nStating their views on a policy issue and listing the positions of\nthe candidates—pro or con—might be construed as “support”\nor “condemnation” within the meaning of the rule. Or say a\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                69\n\nlocal nature club wants to distribute a newsletter throughout\nthe community educating the public about the positions of\nlocal officials on budgetary support for the parks; it can’t do so\nduring the preelection period without risking being required\nto register and report as a PAC. A grass-roots Tea Party issue-\nadvocacy group might be considered a regulable state PAC if\nduring the preelection blackout period, it publishes a pamphlet\ncomplaining about high taxes or intrusive regulation and\nlisting the voting records of state legislators on these subjects.\nIndeed, the antifilibuster issue ads at stake in Wisconsin Right\nto Life II would be deemed fully regulable under GAB\n§ 1.28(3)(b) if aired during the 30/60-day preelection periods.\n    Other examples can be imagined, but this gives a general\nsense of the chilling effect of this overbroad rule. At the low\n$300 statutory spending threshold (until recently, a mere $25!)\nordinary citizens and interest groups are forced into the state\nPAC system—with all its restrictions and registration and\nreporting requirements—if their advocacy on public issues in\nthe lead-up to an election also mentions a candidate. Failure to\norganize, register, and report as a PAC, as required by the rule,\ncarries civil and criminal penalties. See WIS. STAT . §§ 11.60,\n11.61.\n   The Board offers no substantive justification for the\nextraordinary reach of this rule. Instead, it relies summarily on\nMcConnell, which rejected a vagueness and overbreadth\nchallenge to similar “support” or “oppose” language in BCRA\nspecifying when a communication by a state or local party\ncommittee counts as “[f]ederal election activity” and becomes\nsubject to BCRA’s source and amount limitations on contribu-\n\f70                              Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\ntions to political parties. See McConnell, 540 U.S. at 170 n.64; see\nalso Madigan, 697 F.3d at 486. In this part of McConnell, the\nCourt held that the phrases “promotes or supports a candidate\nfor [federal] office” and “attacks or opposes a candidate for\n[federal] office” are clear enough for a state party committee to\nknow when it has crossed into federal regulatory territory.\n    The context here is very different. The First Amendment\nvagueness and overbreadth calculus must be calibrated to the\nkind and degree of the burdens imposed on those who must\ncomply with the regulatory scheme. The greater the burden on\nthe regulated class, the more acute the need for clarity and\nprecision. Political-party committees can afford campaign-\nfinance lawyers to advise them about compliance with the\nrules and restrictions on hard and soft money, which was the\nrelevant context of this part of McConnell. In significant\ncontrast, under GAB § 1.28, ordinary citizens, grass-roots issue-\nadvocacy groups, and § 501(c)(4) social-welfare organizations\nare exposed to civil and criminal penalties for failing to register\nand report as a PAC if they spend more than $300 to communi-\ncate their views about any political issue close to an election\nand include the name or likeness of a candidate in a way that\ncould be construed by state regulators as a reference to the\ncandidate’s qualifications or as “support” or “condemnation”\nof the candidate’s record or positions. Nothing in McConnell\nauthorizes this.\n    The Board also relies on a passage in Madigan approving\nlanguage in the Illinois campaign-finance code that keys that\nstate’s regulation of ballot-initiative activity to the making of\ncontributions or expenditures for the purpose of “advocating\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                 71\n\nthe defeat or passage of” an initiative. 697 F.3d at 485. This is\nthe language of express advocacy and does not implicate\nBuckley vagueness and overbreadth concerns. This part of\nMadigan does not help the Board here.\n    Accordingly, the second sentence of GAB § 1.28(3)(b) is\nunconstitutional and must be enjoined. What’s left of subsec-\ntion (3)(b) basically tracks the boundaries for express advocacy\nand its functional equivalent established in Buckley, McConnell,\nand Wisconsin Right to Life II. For the most part (we’ll discuss\nthe qualifier in a moment), the remaining text of\nsubsection (3)(b) survives review under current doctrine. The\ntext essentially clarifies that a communication is made for a\n“political purpose” only if it contains either Buckley’s “magic\nwords” or their “functional equivalents with reference to a\nclearly identified candidate and unambiguously relates to the\ncampaign of that candidate” or, alternatively, is “susceptible of\nno reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for\nor against a specific candidate.” GAB § 1.28(3)(a)–(b). As long\nas this definition is applied in a manner consistent with the\nlead opinion in Wisconsin Right to Life II, it withstands scrutiny,\nat least as the Supreme Court’s caselaw stands right now.\nInjunctive relief against this part of the rule was properly\ndenied.\n    This brings us to GAB § 1.91, which raises a related but\nslightly different concern. The Board adopted this rule in the\nimmediate aftermath of Citizens United to bring all independent\ngroups—including newly liberated independent advocacy\ngroups that operate in the corporate form—under the umbrella\nof the regulatory scheme. Wisconsin Right to Life argues that\n\f72                                    Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\n§ 1.91 is unconstitutional to the extent that it imposes PAC-like\nburdens on independent groups not under the control of a\ncandidate or candidate’s committee and not engaged in\nexpress advocacy as their major purpose.22 Once again, this\nargument draws on a limiting principle announced in Buckley.\n    To avoid overbreadth concerns in this sensitive area,\nBuckley held that independent groups not engaged in express\nelection advocacy as their major purpose cannot be subjected\nto the complex and extensive regulatory requirements that\naccompany the PAC designation. 424 U.S. at 79 (“To fulfill the\npurposes of the [FECA,] [political-committee requirements]\nneed only encompass organizations that are under the control\nof a candidate or the major purpose of which is the nomination\nor election of a candidate.”). The Court has repeatedly\n\n\n22\n  The district court did not address § 1.91 on the merits, concluding instead\nthat the challenge was moot because the emergency rule expired while the\ncase was on hold awaiting a decision from the state supreme court. The\nemergency rule was replaced by a permanent rule that is identical in all\nm aterial respects. Still, regarding this claim, the Board has staked its\nappellate fortunes entirely on mootness.\n\n     The Board explains that the permanent rule was renumbered to correct\nan alphabetizing error and insists that this technical change required\nWisconsin Right to Life to amend its complaint if it wanted to keep this\nclaim alive. Not so. The expiration of a temporary rule “will not moot an\nattack … if there is a reasonably concrete basis to anticipate that the expired\nrule will be reenacted in a form that will raise the same questions.”\n13C C H A RLES A LA N W RIGH T , A RTH U R R. M ILLER & E D WA RD H. C O O PER ,\nF ED ER A L P RAC TIC E A N D P RO C ED U RE § 3533.6 (3d ed. 2008). W hat was\nsubsection (f) in the emergency rule is now subsection (g) in the permanent\nrule, but in all material respects, the permanent and emergency rules are\nidentical. This claim is not moot.\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                   73\n\nreaffirmed this principle. See Wis. Right to Life II, 551 U.S. at 477\nn.9 (“PACs impose well-documented and onerous burdens,\nparticularly on small nonprofits.”); FEC v. Mass. Citizens for\nLife, Inc., 479 U.S. 238, 254–56 (1986) (noting that PAC burdens\n“may create a disincentive” to engage in political speech\nbecause the applicable duties and restrictions “require a far\nmore complex and formalized organization than many small\ngroups could manage”).\n   But it’s also clear that outside groups—even those whose\nmajor purpose is not express advocacy—are not completely\nimmune from disclosure and disclaimer rules for their occa-\nsional spending on express election advocacy. Citizens United,\n558 U.S. at 366–69. Even so, the Court has never endorsed\nimposing full, formal PAC-like burdens on these speakers.\n    Madigan explained that the “‘major purpose’ limitation, like\nthe express-advocacy/issue-discussion distinction, was a\ncreature of statutory interpretation, not constitutional\ncommand.” 697 F.3d at 487. The Board takes this statement to\nmean that the so-called “major purpose test” in campaign-\nfinance law no longer exists. That’s incorrect. The major-\npurpose limitation announced in Buckley has not receded from\nthe scene. It continues in force and effect as an important check\nagainst regulatory overreach and becomes more significant as\nthe scope and burdens of the regulatory system increase.\n   Madigan declined to apply the major-purpose limitation to\nthe Illinois disclosure system because state law defined\n“political committee more narrowly than FECA by covering\nonly groups that accept contributions or make expenditures\n‘on behalf of or in opposition to’ a candidate or ballot\n\f74                                   Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\ninitiative.” Id. at 488. “This definition,” we said, “is more\ntargeted to campaign-related speech than FECA’s definition of\ncontribution and expenditure, which applies to anything of\nvalue given or received ‘for the purpose of … influencing’ an\nelection.” Id. (citing 2 U.S.C. § 431(8)–(9)).23\n    In contrast, Wisconsin law suffers from the same kind of\noverbreadth as the federal statute at the time of Buckley, so the\nmajor-purpose limitation has the same significance here as it\ndid there. Under GAB § 1.91, any organization that makes\n“independent disbursements” is required to comply with\nalmost all of the statutory obligations imposed on political\ncommittees. It must: (1) organize and register like a political\ncommittee (this requires, among other things, a segregated\ndepository account and a treasurer who is subject to personal\nliability for regulatory violations); (2) pay the annual fee as\nrequired by section 11.055; (3) file the oath for independent\ndisbursements under section 11.06(7) and update it as neces-\nsary; (4) comply with the attribution requirements of section\n11.30(1) and (2); and (5) file detailed, year-round financial\nreports as required by Chapter 11 and include “all contribu-\ntions received for independent disbursements, … and inde-\npendent disbursements made.” GAB § 1.91(3)–(8). Again, a\n\n\n\n23\n  Other circuits have taken varying approaches to Buckley’s major-purpose\nprinciple when reviewing state campaign-finance systems. See Minn.\nCitizens Concerned for Life, Inc. v. Swanson, 692 F.3d 864, 872–76 (8th Cir.\n2012); Nat’l Org. for Marriage v. McKee, 649 F.3d 34, 58–59 (1st Cir. 2011);\nHuman Life of Wash. Inc. v. Brumsickle, 624 F.3d 990, 1009–12 (9th Cir. 2010);\nN.M. Youth Organized v. Herrera, 611 F.3d 669, 677–79 (10th Cir. 2010); N.C.\nRight to Life, Inc. v. Leake, 525 F.3d 274, 287–90 (4th Cir. 2008).\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                                               75\n\nmere $300 in contributions or disbursements triggers all these\nPAC requirements.24\n    In essence, GAB § 1.91 establishes by rule a special PAC-like\ndisclosure program for “independent disbursement organiza-\ntions,” a nonstatutory category of political speakers.25 Disclo-\nsure rules are reviewed under intermediate scrutiny, see\nCitizens United, 558 U.S. at 366–67, which though less rigorous\nthan strict scrutiny nonetheless requires close judicial review,\nsee McCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1445–46 (“[R]egardless whether\nwe apply strict scrutiny or Buckley’s ‘closely drawn’ test, we\nmust assess the fit between the stated governmental objective\nand the means selected to achieve that objective.”).\n    “‘[C]ompelled disclosure, in itself, can seriously infringe on\nprivacy of association and belief guaranteed by the First\nAmendment.’” Davis v. FEC, 554 U.S. 724, 744 (2008) (quoting\nBuckley, 424 U.S. at 64). Campaign-finance disclosure systems\nimplicate two basic concerns. First, forced disclosure of donors\nburdens associational privacy interests. See Buckley, 424 U.S. at\n66 (“[T]he invasion of privacy of belief may be as great when\nthe information sought concerns the giving and spending of\n\n\n24\n  The rule does not apply the statutory contribution limits or source bans\nto independent-expenditure organizations. The Board acknowledges that\nafter Citizens United and Barland I, restrictions of this nature are unconstitu-\ntional as applied to independent political speakers.\n\n25\n  GAB 1284, Independent Disbursements of Corporations and Non-Political\nOrganizations Guideline (M ay 2012), http://gab.wi.gov/sites/default/files/\ng u id e lin e /2 6 /1 2 8 4 _ in d e p e n d e n t_ d isb u rse m e n t_ o rg an izatio ns_p d f_\n13708.pdf.\n\f76                              Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\nmoney as when it concerns the joining of organizations, for\n‘financial transactions can reveal much about a person’s\nactivities, associations, and beliefs.’” (quoting Cal. Bankers Ass’n\nv. Shultz, 416 U.S. 21, 78–79 (1974) (Powell, J., concurring))).\nSecond, PAC-like registration and reporting requirements\nimpose heavy administrative burdens, creating disincentives\nto participation in election-related speech. See Citizens United,\n558 U.S. at 337–38; Mass. Citizens for Life, 479 U.S. at 254–55.\nForced to disclose donors and faced with the complex and\nformalized requirements of a PAC-like registration and\nreporting system, some groups might conclude that their\n“contemplated political activity [is] simply not worth it” and\nopt not to speak at all. Mass. Citizens for Life, 479 U.S. at 255.\n    So the Board must justify this rule under “exacting\nscrutiny,” which requires a “substantial” relationship between\nthe disclosure requirements and an important governmental\ninterest. See Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 366–67. This is not a\nloose form of judicial review:\n       In the First Amendment context, fit matters.\n       Even when the Court is not applying strict\n       scrutiny, we still require “a fit that is not neces-\n       sarily perfect, but reasonable; that represents not\n       necessarily the single best disposition but one\n       whose scope is ‘in proportion to the interest\n       served,’ … that employs not necessarily the least\n       restrictive means but … a means narrowly\n       tailored to achieve the desired objective.” Board\n       of Trustees of State Univ. of N.Y. v. Fox, 492 U.S.\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                77\n\n       469, 480 (1989) (quoting In re R.M.J., 455 U.S. 191,\n       203 (1982)).\nMcCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1456–57. In other words, we look for\n“a ‘relevant correlation’ or ‘substantial relation’” between the\nstated governmental objective and the means selected to\nachieve it. Davis, 554 U.S. at 744 (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at\n64). Moreover, “the strength of the governmental interest must\nreflect the seriousness of the actual burden on First Amend-\nment rights.” Id. “[I]f a law that restricts political speech does\nnot ‘avoid unnecessary abridgement’ of First Amendment\nrights, … it cannot survive [this] ‘rigorous’ review.”\nMcCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1446 (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 25).\n    It’s well accepted that disclosure requirements in the\ncampaign-finance context serve important governmental\ninterests by providing the public with information about “who\nis speaking about a candidate shortly before an election” and\nthe sources of funding for campaign-related ads. Citizens\nUnited, 558 U.S. at 369. Here, however, we “find a substantial\nmismatch” between that informational objective and the means\nthe Board has chosen to achieve it. McCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at\n1446. Under GAB § 1.91, every independent group that crosses\nthe very low $300 threshold in express-advocacy spending\nmust formally organize, register, and report like a political\ncommittee.\n    Why impose full-blown PAC duties so indiscriminately?\nThe Board does not explain. For groups that engage in express\nelection advocacy as their major purpose, the PAC regulatory\nsystem—with its organizational prerequisites, registration\nduties, and comprehensive, continuous financial reporting—is\n\f78                            Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\na relevantly correlated and reasonably tailored means of\nachieving the public’s informational interest. But the same\ncannot be said for imposing the same pervasive regulatory\nregime on issue-advocacy groups that only occasionally\nengage in express advocacy.\n     A simpler, less burdensome disclosure rule for occasional\nexpress-advocacy spending by “nonmajor-purpose groups”\nwould be constitutionally permissible under Citizens United,\nwhich approved BCRA’s one-time, event-driven disclosure\nrequirement for federal electioneering communications—again,\nbroadcast ads in excess of $10,000 aired close to an election.\n558 U.S. at 366–69. That’s a far cry from imposing full PAC-like\nburdens on all issue-advocacy groups once a modest annual\nspending threshold is crossed. In effect GAB § 1.91 requires\nevery issue-advocacy group to form a PAC before spending as\nlittle as $300.01 on express advocacy, whether at election time\nor any other time of year. Failure to do so brings civil and\ncriminal penalties.\n    We appreciate that the Board is hamstrung by the legisla-\nture’s failure to update Chapter 11 to account for the effect of\nCitizens United. Federal law establishes separate disclosure\ntracks for political committees, see 2 U.S.C.\n§ 434(a)–(b); independent expenditures, see id. § 434(c); and\nelectioneering communications, see id. § 434(f). Full political-\ncommittee requirements apply only to “major purpose” groups\nwithin the meaning of the Buckley limitation. See Political\nCommittee Status, 72 Fed. Reg. 5595, 5596–97 (Feb. 7, 2007).\nChapter 11, in contrast, does not distinguish among\nindependent groups; neither does GAB § 1.91. All individuals\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                            79\n\nand groups that raise and spend money independently of\ncandidates must register and report like a PAC once the\nmodest threshold in contributions or expenditures is crossed.\nBefore Citizens United, this feature in Wisconsin’s state\ncampaign-finance system was largely obscured because most\nindependent organizations operate in the corporate form and\nas such were completely banned from speaking. If they wanted\nto engage in occasional express advocacy, they had to form a\nPAC to do it. After Citizens United, the absence of a major-\npurpose limiting principle now comes to the fore.\n   With the legislature silent, the Board cobbled together a\nregulatory response, imposing most of Chapter 11’s political-\ncommittee requirements on all independent organizations\nwithout any scope limitation—that is, without distinguishing\nbetween groups that are organized with express election\nadvocacy as their major purpose and those that are not.\nGroups in the latter category thus face the same dilemma as\nthey did before Citizens United: They must form a PAC to\nengage in occasional express advocacy.\n    As applied to these groups—the “nonmajor-purpose”\ngroups—the Board makes no effort to explain how GAB § 1.91\nsatisfies the close tailoring required to sustain a disclosure\nregime under exacting scrutiny. Instead, it summarily invokes\nCitizens United and Madigan, which upheld disclosure require-\nments imposed on independent groups. As we have explained,\nGAB § 1.91 imposes far greater burdens on independent\nspeakers by simply importing the political-committee require-\nments of Chapter 11, which in critical respects are unchanged\nfrom Buckley’s day.\n\f80                             Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\n    Wisconsin’s foundational campaign-finance law is in\nserious need of legislative attention to account for develop-\nments in the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence protecting\npolitical speech. The GAB has the authority to interpret and\nimplement the statutory scheme, but it cannot contradict\nChapter 11. See WIS. STAT . § 5.05(1)(f); see also Wis. Citizens\nConcerned for Cranes & Doves v. Wis. Dep’t of Natural Res.,\n677 N.W.2d 612, 617 (Wis. 2004); Seider v. O’Connell,\n612 N.W.2d 659, 676 (Wis. 2000). The basic design and primary\nrequirements of the disclosure system are matters for the state\nlegislature.\n    As it stands, GAB § 1.91 is a reasonably tailored disclosure\nrule for independent organizations engaged in express election\nadvocacy as their major purpose, but the same is not true for\nissue-advocacy groups that only occasionally engage in express\nadvocacy. The public’s informational interest is strong, but\nrequiring all issue-advocacy groups to comply with\nChapter 11’s burdensome PAC requirements is not a closely\ntailored means of achieving it. Accordingly, GAB § 1.91 is\nunconstitutional as applied to independent organizations\nwhose major purpose is not express advocacy. In other\nrespects, the rule survives First Amendment scrutiny.\n\n\n     2. Sections 11.12(5)–(6), Reporting of Late Contributions\n     and Expenditures\n    Wisconsin Right to Life also challenges sections 11.12(5)–(6),\nwhich impose a special reporting requirement for contributions\nof $500 or more and expenditures of $20 or more received or\nmade within 15 days of an election. Until recently, these late\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                81\n\ncontributions and expenditures were subject to a 24-hour\nreporting rule if not already included in a preprimary or\npreelection report. Wisconsin Right to Life maintains that\n24 hours is too short but suggested at oral argument that a\n48-hour requirement would likely satisfy close tailoring. The\nrecent legislation increased the reporting time to 48 hours. See\n2013 Wis. Act 153 §§ 13–14.\n    This amendment moots the challenge to the 24-hour rule.\nSee MacDonald v. City of Chicago, 243 F.3d 1021, 1025 (7th Cir.\n2001). In response, Wisconsin Right to Life moved to supple-\nment the record with a declaration from the director of its PAC\nattesting to the burdens of the new 48-hour reporting require-\nment. The Board rightly objects to the submission of new\nfactual matter on appeal. See Berwick Grain Co. v. Ill. Dep’t of\nAgric., 116 F.3d 231, 234 (7th Cir. 1997) (“The appellate stage of\nthe litigation process is not the place to introduce new eviden-\ntiary materials.”). Wisconsin Right to Life may challenge the\nnew 48-hour requirement on remand, but it can’t do so for the\nfirst time on appeal.\n\n\n   3. Section 11.06(7), GAB § 1.42, the Oath for Independent\n   Expenditures\n    Finally, Wisconsin Right to Life challenges section 11.06(7),\nwhich imposes an oath requirement on individuals and\nindependent committees before they spend money to support\nor oppose a candidate for state or local office. These independ-\nent speakers must affirm that their spending is not coordinated\nwith the candidate or candidate’s agent. A related administra-\ntive rule, GAB § 1.42(1), repeats the statutory requirement and\n\f82                                   Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\nstates that any expenditure made or obligation incurred “in\nsupport of or opposition to a specific candidate” must be made\nor incurred “by or through an individual or committee” that\nhas filed the oath required by section 11.06(7).\n    The challenge to the oath requirement is not well-\ndeveloped. Wisconsin Right to Life argues in very general\nterms that (1) the requirement is too burdensome because\npolitical interests are unpredictable and change rapidly in\nresponse to events unfolding in real time during an election;\nand (2) the rule is especially burdensome for small committees\nlike the Wisconsin Right to Life PAC. The Board counters that\nthe oath is a simple, one-page form with an attachment that\nlists the candidates to which it applies. This strikes us as a\nminimally burdensome regulatory requirement, and it’s\nreasonably tailored to the public’s informational interest in\nknowing the sources of independent election-related spending.\nThe district court properly declined to enjoin section 11.06(7)\nand GAB § 1.42(1).26\n\n\n\n\n26\n  Several other features of the rule raise potentially troubling questions. For\nexample, the rule creates certain presumptions that could be traps for\nunwary independent groups and candidates alike if not interpreted in\naccordance with the limits established in Buckley and Wisconsin Right to\nLife II, as explained above. See GAB § 1.42(1) (treating expenditures not\npreceded by a proper oath as contributions); id. § 1.42(6) (presumption of\ncoordination). These provisions are not challenged here.\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                              83\n\n                       III. Conclusion\n   To sum up, we conclude as follows:\n    Corporate-speech ban. Section 11.38(1)(a)1, the ban on\npolitical spending by corporations, is unconstitutional under\nCitizens United.\n   Cap on corporate fundraising for an affiliated PAC.\nSection 11.38(1)(a)3, the cap on the amount a corporation may\nspend on fundraising for an affiliated political committee, is\nunconstitutional under Citizens United and Barland I.\n   Regulatory disclaimer. The lengthy disclaimer requirement\nin GAB § 1.42(5) is unconstitutional as applied to 30-second\nradio ads and ads of shorter duration.\n    Definitions of “political purposes” and “political commit-\ntee.” The statutory definition of “political purposes,”\nsection 11.01(16), and the regulatory definition of “political\ncommittee,” GAB § 1.28(1)(a), are unconstitutionally vague and\noverbroad in the sense meant by Buckley and require a\nnarrowing construction. As applied to political speakers other\nthan candidates, their campaign committees, and political\nparties, the definitions are limited to express advocacy and its\nfunctional equivalent as those terms were explained in Buckley\nand Wisconsin Right to Life II.\n    PAC Status and PAC-Like Burdens on Issue-Advocacy\nGroups. The second sentence of GAB § 1.28(3)(b), which treats\nissue advocacy during the 30/60-day preelection period as fully\nregulable express advocacy if it mentions a candidate, is\nunconstitutional. Similarly, GAB § 1.91, which imposes PAC-\nlike registration, reporting, and other requirements on all\n\f84                          Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\norganizations that make independent disbursements, is\nunconstitutional as applied to organizations not engaged in\nexpress advocacy as their major purpose.\n  The other challenged statutes and rules survive First\nAmendment scrutiny.\n    On remand the district court shall issue a permanent\ninjunction consistent with this opinion and the specificity\nrequirements of Rule 65(d).\n                VACATED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                               85\n\n                         APPENDIX\nGAB 1.91 Organizations making independent\ndisbursements.\n(1) In this section:\n   (a) “Contribution” has the meaning given in s. 11.01 (6),\n       Stats.\n   (b) “Designated depository account” means a depository\n       account specifically established by an organization to\n       receive contributions and from which to make inde-\n       pendent disbursements.\n   (c) “Disbursement” has the meaning given in s. 11.01 (7),\n       Stats.\n   (d) “Filing officer” has the meaning given in s. 11.01 (8),\n       Stats.\n   (e) “Incurred obligation” has the meaning given in\n      s. 11.01 (11), Stats.\n   (f) “Independent” means the absence of acting in coopera-\n       tion or consultation with any candidate or authorized\n       committee of a candidate who is supported or opposed,\n       and is not made in concert with, or at the request or\n       suggestion of, any candidate or any agent or authorized\n       committee of a candidate who is supported or opposed.\n   (g) “Organization” means any person other than an indi-\n       vidual, committee, or political group subject to registra-\n       tion under s. 11.23, Stats.\n\f86                             Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\n     (h) “Person” includes the meaning given in s. 990.01 (26),\n         Stats.\n(2) A corporation, or association organized under ch. 185 or\n    193, Stats., is a person and qualifies as an organization that\n    is not prohibited by s. 11.38 (1) (a) 1., Stats., from making\n    independent disbursements until such time as a court\n    having jurisdiction in the State of Wisconsin rules that a\n    corporation, or association organized under ch. 185 or 193,\n    Stats., may constitutionally be restricted from making an\n    independent disbursement.\n(3) Upon accepting contributions made for, incurring obliga-\n    tions for, or making an independent disbursement exceed-\n    ing $25 in aggregate during a calendar year, an organiza-\n    tion shall establish a designated depository account in the\n    name of the organization.

Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., and its\nState Political Action Committee—its “PAC” for state\nelections—sued to block the enforcement of many state statutes\nand rules against groups that spend money for political speech\nindependently of candidates and parties. The complaint alleges\nthat the challenged laws are vague and overbroad and unjusti-\nfiably burden the free-speech rights of independent political\nspeakers in violation of the First Amendment.\n    This is our second encounter with the case. When it was last\nhere, we addressed a single claim by the Wisconsin Right to\nLife State PAC: a challenge to section 11.26(4) of the Wisconsin\nStatutes, which caps at $10,000 the aggregate annual amount\na donor may give to state and local candidates, political parties,\nand political committees.

Applying Citizens United, we held that the aggregate\ncontribution limit is unconstitutional as applied to organiza-\ntions that independently spend money on election-related\nspeech and permanently enjoined its enforcement against\nindependent-expenditure groups and their donors. Id. at 155.\nOur ruling anticipated the Supreme Court’s recent decision in\nMcCutcheon v. FEC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2659301\"><a href=\"/opinion/2659301/mccutcheon-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The case\ncomes to us from a decision granting in part and denying in\npart the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. The\ndistrict court enjoined the ban on corporate political spending,\npartially enjoined a regulatory disclaimer rule, and denied the\nrest of the motion. The plaintiffs appealed.\n    We vacate the court’s order and remand with instructions\nto enter a new injunction. First, the present injunction order is\nimproper in form and must be reentered to conform to the\nspecificity requirements of Rule 65(d) of the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure. On the merits, in the domain of campaign-\nfinance law, the First Amendment requires a heightened\ndegree of regulatory clarity and a close fit between the\ngovernment’s means and its end, and some forms of regulation\nare categorically impermissible.\n    Like other campaign-finance systems, Wisconsin’s is\nlabyrinthian and difficult to decipher without a background in\nthis area of the law; in certain critical respects, it violates the\nconstitutional limits on the government’s power to regulate\nindependent political speech. Part of the problem is that the\nstate’s basic campaign-finance law—Chapter 11 of the Wiscon-\nsin Statutes—has not been updated to keep pace with the\nevolution in Supreme Court doctrine marking the boundaries\non the government’s authority to regulate election-related\n\f4                              Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\nspeech. In addition, key administrative rules do not cohere\nwell with the statutes, introducing a patchwork of new and\ndifferent terms, definitions, and burdens on independent\npolitical speakers, the intent and cumulative effect of which is\nto enlarge the reach of the statutory scheme. Finally, the state\nelections agency has given conflicting signals about its intent\nto enforce some aspects of the regulatory mélange.\n    Whether the agency has the statutory authority to regulate\nin this way is a serious question of state administrative law on\nwhich no state court has weighed in. As we explained in\nBarland I, the district judge initially abstained in this case to\nawait a ruling from the Wisconsin Supreme Court on the scope\nof the agency’s authority and a possible limiting construction\non one of the rules challenged here. 664 F.3d at 143–45. But the\nstate high court split evenly, with one justice recused, and the\noriginal action was dismissed without decision. See Wis.\nProsperity Network v. Myse, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">810</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Wis. 2012) (per\ncuriam). So we must take the regulatory scheme as we find it,\ntesting it against federal constitutional standards.\n    Certain statutory provisions—the ban on corporate political\nspending and the cap on the amount a corporation may spend\nto raise money for an affiliated PAC—are obviously unconsti-\ntutional under Citizens United and our decision in Barland I.\nOther statutes and rules fail First Amendment standards as\napplied to independent political speakers. Some of the chal-\nlenged provisions withstand constitutional scrutiny. We will\nidentify the constitutional infirmities as we move through our\nanalysis, and on remand a new, permanent injunction should\nbe entered in accordance with this opinion. One statute—the\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                 5\n\n24-hour-reporting requirement for late contributions and\nexpenditures—was recently amended to enlarge the reporting\ntime to 48 hours. If the plaintiffs want to challenge the amend-\ned statute, they will have to do so in the first instance in the\ndistrict court.\n\n\n                         I. Background\nA. The Parties\n    Wisconsin Right to Life is a nonprofit corporation with tax-\nexempt status as a social-welfare organization under 26 U.S.C.\n§ 501(c)(4). Its mission is to advance pro-life positions—\nopposition to abortion, euthanasia, and the destruction of\nhuman embryos—in the spheres of ethics, law, and civil\nsociety, and to promote alternatives to these procedures. See\nThe Mission and Vision of Wisconsin Right to Life, WIS. RIGHT TO\nLIFE, http://wrtl.org/mission (last visited May 9, 2014). In\nfurtherance of this purpose, Wisconsin Right to Life engages in\na range of political speech and public outreach on issues\nconnected to its mission, including (among other things)\nmailings, fliers, information posted on its website, and various\nforms of advertising. It also occasionally seeks to participate in\npolitical advocacy in state elections, but Wisconsin law flatly\nprohibits it from doing so. See WIS . STAT . § 11.38(1)(a)1 (ban-\nning corporations from making contributions and disburse-\nments for political purposes).\n    To avoid violating the statutory ban on election-related\nspeech by corporations, Wisconsin Right to Life formed an\naffiliated PAC that engages in express advocacy in elections for\n\f6                              Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\nstate offices. Wisconsin law prohibits the corporation from\ncontributing to its PAC. See id. § 11.38(1)(a)2.\n    Neither the organization nor its state PAC contributes to\ncandidates or other political committees, nor are they con-\nnected with candidates, their campaign committees, or political\nparties. That is to say, they operate independently of candi-\ndates and their campaign committees. We refer to the plaintiffs\ncollectively as “Wisconsin Right to Life” unless the context\nrequires us to distinguish between the organization and its\nPAC.\n    The Government Accountability Board was created in 2007\nto replace the State Elections Board as the agency responsible\nfor administering Wisconsin’s campaign-finance and election\nlaws. See 2007 Wis. Act 1 § 1. Its members are former state\njudges appointed by the governor from a nonpartisan slate\nnominated by a committee of sitting appellate judges. WIS.\nSTAT. § 15.60. The Government Accountability Board is not\nitself the named defendant: The individual board members are\nsued in their official capacities, which amounts to the same\nthing. We refer to them collectively as “the GAB” or “the\nBoard.”\n    The GAB has joint enforcement authority with elected\ndistrict attorneys to investigate violations of the state election\nlaws and to prosecute civil violations; district attorneys in each\ncounty have exclusive authority to prosecute criminal viola-\ntions. Id. § 5.05(2m). John Chisholm, the Milwaukee County\nDistrict Attorney, is also named as a defendant because\nWisconsin Right to Life has its headquarters in Milwaukee\nCounty. Because this is a preenforcement suit, however, our\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                  7\n\nfocus is on the challenged statutes, rules, and other regulatory\nactivity of the GAB, not on any specific action taken by the\ndistrict attorney. So we need not mention Chisholm further,\nthough he is, of course, bound by the injunction.\n                            *    *   *\n    Wisconsin Right to Life brought this suit as a comprehen-\nsive challenge to Wisconsin’s campaign-finance law in the\nwake of Citizens United. The case is sprawling and the briefing\nunwieldy, but we have managed to isolate the core constitu-\ntional claims. To understand them requires a grasp of the\nintricacies of Wisconsin’s campaign-finance system and some\nfamiliarity with its statutory, regulatory, and litigation history.\nThe chronicle roughly corresponds to important developments\nin the Supreme Court’s campaign-finance caselaw, so we’ll\ninclude a discussion of the relevant cases along the way and\ncome back to them later in the analysis.\n   Bear with us. The sweep of this case is very broad. To\ndecide it requires a legal and political history of minor epic\nproportions and a good deal of regulatory detail. We will\nradically simplify, but significant length cannot be avoided.\n\n\nB. Wisconsin’s Campaign-Finance System\n    The statutory requirements of Wisconsin’s campaign-\nfinance system are found in Chapter 11 of the Wisconsin\nStatutes, adopted in 1973 following the enactment of the\nFederal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (“FECA”), 2 U.S.C.\n§§ 431 et seq. Like its federal counterpart, Chapter 11 estab-\nlishes an elaborate regulatory regime for campaign finance in\n\f8                               Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\nstate elections, imposing organizational, registration,\nrecordkeeping, reporting, attribution, and disclaimer duties on\npolitical speakers; the law also sets limits on contributions and\nexpenditures for election-related activities and communica-\ntions. The statutory scheme broadly applies to candidates, their\ncampaign committees, political parties, independent groups,\nand individuals alike.\n    “To a lay reader, both statutes [FECA and Chapter 11]\nrequire almost any group that wants to say almost anything\nabout a candidate or election to register as a political commit-\ntee.” Wis. Right to Life, Inc. v. Paradise, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"752368\"><a href=\"/opinion/752368/wisconsin-right-to-life-inc-v-gregory-j-paradise-chairman-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1183</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1184 (7th\nCir. 1998); see also WIS.

Valeo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109380\"><a href=\"/opinion/109380/buckley-v-valeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1976), limits what campaign-finance regulators may do. In\nBuckley, “[the] Court construed (some would say rewrote) the\nfederal statute to avoid some of the many constitutional\nproblems that arise when regulating political speech, the core\nof the [F]irst [A]mendment’s domain.” Paradise, 138 F.3d at\n1184. “[M]any elements of the Buckley approach are required\nby the [F]irst [A]mendment, which means that they apply to\nthe states.” Id.\n\n\n    1. Buckley v. Valeo\n   We take our first detour into the caselaw to highlight the\ndoctrine established in Buckley, which addressed a\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                     9\n\ncomprehensive challenge to the 1971 federal law and remains\nthe Supreme Court’s baseline campaign-finance decision. We\nstart with the broad foundational principles. Because free-\nflowing political debate is “integral to” our system of govern-\nment, “‘there is practically universal agreement that a major\npurpose of th[e] [First] Amendment was to protect the free\ndiscussion of governmental affairs, … of course includ[ing]\ndiscussions of candidates.’” Buckley, 424 U.S. at 14 (quoting\nMills v. Alabama, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107235\"><a href=\"/opinion/107235/mills-v-alabama/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 218 (1966)).1 This agreement\n“reflects our ‘profound national commitment to the principle\nthat debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and\nwide-open.’” Id. (quoting N.Y. Times Co. v. Sullivan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106761\"><a href=\"/opinion/106761/new-york-times-co-v-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 270 (1964)). The right to speak freely about political issues,\npublic policy, and candidates for public office has both\nindividual and associational aspects and “‘has its fullest and\nmost urgent application precisely to the conduct of campaigns\nfor political office.’” Id. at 15 (quoting Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108275\"><a href=\"/opinion/108275/monitor-patriot-co-v-roy/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 272 (1971)).\n    To implement this vital constitutional protection, Buckley\nnarrowed the reach of FECA and announced some limiting\nprinciples applicable to all campaign-finance laws. First, the\ngovernment’s authority to regulate in this area extends only to\nmoney raised and spent for speech that is clearly election\nrelated; ordinary political speech about issues, policy, and\npublic officials must remain unencumbered. See id. at 42–44; see\nalso id. at 78–80.\n\n\n\n1\n The First Amendment provides that “Congress shall make no law …\nabridging the freedom of speech.” U.S. C O N ST . amend. I.\n\f10                              Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\n    Second, because political speech is at the core of the First\nAmendment right, overbreadth and vagueness concerns loom\nlarge in this area, especially when the regulatory scheme\nreaches beyond candidates, their campaign committees, and\npolitical parties. To protect against an unconstitutional chill on\nissue advocacy by independent speakers, Buckley held that\ncampaign-finance regulation must be precise, clear, and may\nonly extend to speech that is “unambiguously related to the\ncampaign of a particular federal candidate.” Id. at 80. To put\nthe point differently, “‘[b]ecause First Amendment freedoms\nneed breathing space to survive, government may regulate in\n[this] area only with narrow specificity.’” Id. at 41 n.48 (quoting\nNAACP v. Button, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106514\"><a href=\"/opinion/106514/naacp-v-button/\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 433 (1963)).\n    The 1971 law was both too uncertain and too broad to\nsatisfy the constitutional requirements of clarity and precision;\nBuckley held that the “constitutional deficiencies [of vagueness\nand overbreadth] … can be avoided only by reading [the\nfederal statute] as limited to communications that include\nexplicit words of advocacy of election or defeat of a candidate.”\nId. at 43 (emphasis added). In other words, the First Amend-\nment forbids the government from regulating political expres-\nsion that does not “in express terms advocate the election or\ndefeat of a clearly identified candidate.” Id. at 44.\n    Applying this limiting principle to FECA’s disclosure\nrequirements for independent political expenditures, the Court\ngave the federal statute a narrowing construction, holding that\nthe disclosure duties could be triggered only when “funds [are]\nused for communications that expressly advocate the election\nor defeat of a clearly identified candidate.” Id. at 80. In a\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                  11\n\nfamous footnote, the Court listed some examples of express\nadvocacy: “vote for,” “elect,” “support,” “cast your ballot for,”\n“Smith for Congress,” “vote against,” “defeat,” and “reject.” Id.\nat 44 n.52. These are the Buckley “magic words.”\n    The Court also narrowed the scope of “political committee”\nstatus to reach only groups that engage in election advocacy as\ntheir major purpose. Id. at 79–80. This, too, was an application\nof the constitutional-avoidance doctrine to address vagueness\nand overbreadth concerns. Political-committee status carries a\ncomplex, comprehensive, and intrusive set of restrictions and\nregulatory burdens. See 2 U.S.C. §§ 433, 434(a)–(b),\n441a(a)(1)(C), 441b(a). Buckley held that “[t]o fulfill the pur-\nposes of the Act[,] [the definition of political committee] need\nonly encompass organizations that are under the control of a\ncandidate or the major purpose of which is the nomination or\nelection of a candidate.” 424 U.S. at 79. Expenditures by\npolitical committees “so construed” clearly “fall within the core\narea sought to be addressed by Congress. They are, by defini-\ntion, campaign related.” Id.\n    Finally, the Court drew a distinction between restrictions\non expenditures for election-related speech and restrictions on\ncontributions to candidates. Buckley held that limits on contribu-\ntions are reviewed under an intermediate standard of scrutiny\nand may be permissible based on the public interest in prevent-\ning quid pro quo corruption, but limits on expenditures get\nstrict scrutiny and usually flunk. See id. at 25–27, 55–56; see also\nBarland I, 664 F.3d at 152–53. The distinction drawn in Buckley\nbetween expenditures and contributions may be eroding—and\nwith it the different standards of review—but for now these\n\f12                             Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\ncategories remain. See McCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1445 (opinion\nof Roberts, C.J.) (“[W]e see no need in this case to revisit\nBuckley’s distinction between contributions and expenditures\nand the corollary distinction in the applicable standards of\nreview.”); see also id. at 1462–65 (Thomas, J., concurring in\njudgment) (calling for strict scrutiny of contribution limits).\n                           *   *   *\n    As originally enacted, Chapter 11 of the Wisconsin Statutes\ncontained many of the same constitutional infirmities as the\nfederal statute. Soon after the Buckley decision was released,\nthe Attorney General of Wisconsin issued an opinion to the\nState Elections Board—the predecessor to the GAB—advising\nit that some parts of Chapter 11 were unconstitutional and\nothers must be narrowly construed. See 65 Op. Att’y Gen. Wis.\n145 (1976); see also Paradise, 138 F.3d at 1185. Chapter 11 was\nthereafter amended to incorporate Buckley’s express-advocacy\nlimiting principle. See Elections Bd. v.

Chapter 11\n    The various prescriptions and proscriptions in Chapter 11\napply to candidates, individuals, and political committees,\nbroadly defined. A “committee” or “political committee” (the\nterms are used interchangeably) is “any person other than an\nindividual and any combination of 2 or more persons, perma-\nnent or temporary, which makes or accepts contributions or makes\ndisbursements, whether or not engaged in activities which are\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                         13\n\nexclusively political.” WIS. STAT . § 11.01(4) (emphasis added).2\nLike its federal counterpart, Chapter 11 is structured so that\npolitical-committee status is determined indirectly, by the\nmaking or acceptance of “contributions” or the making of\n“disbursements” (called “expenditures” in the federal law). See\nid.; see also 2 U.S.C. § 431(4) (defining “political committee”). In\nstate law, as in FECA, this status triggers complicated and\nburdensome regulatory restrictions and requirements, so\ndefining “committee” in this way brings Buckley’s vagueness\nand overbreadth concerns into play.\n    Committees under Chapter 11 can be general or specific,\nand connected to or independent of candidates, parties, or\npartisan legislative caucuses. Specific varieties mentioned in\nthe statute include personal campaign committees, legislative\ncampaign committees, support committees, political party\ncommittees, and “special interest” committees. See WIS. STAT .\n§ 11.05(3). A personal campaign committee is just what it\nsounds like: a political committee operated by a candidate or\nwith the candidate’s authorization. See id. § 11.01(15). Legisla-\ntive campaign committees are party committees “organized in\neither house of the legislature to support candidates of a\npolitical party for legislative office.” Id. § 11.01(12s). Other\ncommittee types are left undefined.3\n\n\n\n2\n The general statutory definition of “person” includes “all partnerships,\nassociations and bodies politic or corporate.” W IS . S TAT . § 990.01(26).\n\n3\n  As in federal campaign-finance jargon, state political committees are\nsometimes colloquially referred to as “PACs.”\n\f14                              Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\n    Chapter 11 provides that “every committee other than a\npersonal campaign committee which makes or accepts contri-\nbutions, incurs obligations, or makes disbursements in a\ncalendar year in an aggregate amount in excess of $25” must\nregister with the state elections agency. Id. § 11.05(1) (establish-\ning the general registration requirement). Candidates and their\npersonal campaign committees have an absolute duty to\nregister; there is no expenditure or disbursement threshold. See\nid. § 11.05(2g). Individuals also must register if they “accept[]\ncontributions, incur[] obligations, or make[] disbursements in\na calendar year in an aggregate amount in excess of $25 to\nsupport or oppose the election or nomination of a candidate.”\nId. § 11.05(2).\n    The dollar threshold for registration was recently raised\nand is now $300—still a very modest amount. See 2013 Wis. Act\n153 §§ 5, 6, 9 (effective Mar. 29, 2014). The remaining criteria\nfor registration are unaffected by the recent legislation.\n    Registration carries certain organizational prerequisites.\nCommittees must appoint a treasurer. (Individual registrants\nare considered their own treasurers.) WIS. STAT . § 11.10(3). The\ntreasurer is personally liable for violations of the reporting\nduties and other requirements of the regulatory system. Id.\n§ 11.20(13).

Id. § 11.19(2).\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                              19\n\n    Other restrictions and requirements apply, but we’ll pause\nhere to catch our breath and summarize. Under Chapter 11 any\ngroup that makes or receives a “contribution,” incurs an\n“obligation,” or makes a “disbursement” in excess of $300 in a\ncalendar year is treated as a political committee. (Individuals\nare covered too, but we’re mostly concerned with Chapter 11’s\napplication to organizational associations.) Committee status\ntriggers substantial and continuous organizational, registra-\ntion, and recordkeeping requirements, and compliance is\nrequired before any money is spent for election-related speech;\nthe periodic reporting duties kick in immediately thereafter.\n   So the whole regulatory system turns on what counts as a\n“contribution,” “obligation,” or “disbursement.” Chapter 11\ndefines all three terms very broadly to include anything of\nvalue given or spent “for political purposes.”5 That all-\nimportant phrase is defined as follows:\n\n\n\n5\n  M ore specifically, “contribution” means “[a] gift, subscription, loan,\nadvance, or deposit of money or anything of value [except a loan from a\ncommercial lending institution] … made for political purposes.” W IS . S TAT .\n§ 11.01(6)(a) (emphasis added). An “incurred obligation” means “every\nexpress obligation … including every loan, guarantee of a loan or other\nobligation or payment for any goods, or for any services … incurred by a\ncandidate, committee[, or] individual … for political purposes.” Id. § 11.01(11)\n(emphasis added). A “disbursement” means a “purchase, payment,\ndistribution, loan, advance, deposit, or gift of money or anything of value\n[except a loan from a commercial lending institution] … , [or a ‘contract,\npromise, or agreement’ to do any of these things] made for political purposes.”\nId. § 11.01(7)(a) (emphasis added).\n\f20                               Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\n           (16) An act is for “political purposes” when it\n       is done for the purpose of influencing the election or\n       nomination for election of any individual to state\n       or local office, for the purpose of influencing the\n       recall from or retention in office of an individual\n       holding a state or local office, for the purpose of\n       payment of expenses incurred as a result of a\n       recount at an election, or for the purpose of influ-\n       encing a particular vote at a referendum. …\n           (a) Acts which are for “political purposes” include\n       but are not limited to:\n           1. The making of a communication which ex-\n       pressly advocates the election, defeat, recall or reten-\n       tion of a clearly identified candidate or a particular\n       vote at a referendum.\nId. § 11.01(16) (emphases added).\n    The “express advocacy” language we have italicized above\nwas added to comply with the requirements laid down in\nBuckley. See Wis. Mfrs. & Commerce, 597 N.W.2d at 727–28. The\neffect of this limiting language was to place issue advo-\ncacy—political ads and other communications that do not\nexpressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified\ncandidate—beyond the reach of the regulatory scheme. Id. at\n729–31; see also WIS. ADMIN . CODE EL BD § 1.28 (1977); 65 Op.\nAtt’y Gen. at 152–54.\n   A few of Chapter 11’s other requirements and restrictions\nare directly or indirectly implicated here. Anonymous dis-\nbursements are prohibited. Any advertisement or other\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                              21\n\ncommunication by a political committee must contain an\nattribution specifically including the words “Paid for by”\nfollowed by the name of the committee and its treasurer. WIS.\nSTAT. § 11.30(2)(b). Advertisements and other communications\nby independent committees must carry an additional dis-\nclaimer: “Not authorized by any candidate or candidate’s\nagent or committee.” Id. § 11.30(2)(d). A related administrative\nrule requires that any “political message” by an individual or\ngroup acting independently of a candidate contain a much\nwordier disclaimer:\n       The committee (individual) is the sole source of\n       this communication and the committee (individ-\n       ual) did not act in cooperation or consultation\n       with, and in concert with, or at the request or\n       suggestion of any candidate or any agent or\n       authorized committee of a candidate who is\n       supported or opposed by this communication.\nWIS. ADMIN . CODE GAB § 1.42(5).\n   Contribution limits apply. Earlier in this case we addressed\none of them—section 11.26(4), the $10,000 aggregate annual\ncap on contributions to candidates and committees—and\nfound it unconstitutional under Citizens United as applied to\ncontributions to independent groups. Barland I, 664 F.3d at 155.\nSeparately, subsections 11.26(1) and (2) impose specific dollar\nlimits on contributions to candidates, their personal campaign\ncommittees, and any independent committee “acting solely in\nsupport of such a candidate or solely in opposition to the\ncandidate’s opponent.”\n\f22                              Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\n    Finally, like the federal statute at issue in Citizens United,\nChapter 11 bans all political speech by corporations: No\ncorporation may “make any contribution or disbursement,\ndirectly or indirectly, either independently or through any\npolitical party, committee, group, candidate or individual.”\nWIS. STAT . § 11.38(1)(a)1. A corporation may, however, create\na separate segregated fund for election-related speech, which\nhas the status of a political committee and must register and\nreport as such. Id. § 11.38(1)(a)2. The corporation may “solicit\ncontributions from individuals to the fund … for the purpose\nof supporting or opposing any candidate for state or local\noffice,” but the corporation itself may not contribute to the\nfund. Id. Until recently, Chapter 11 also provided that no\ncorporation may spend “more than a combined total of $500\nannually for solicitation of contributions” to its segregated\nfund (i.e., to its affiliated PAC). Id. § 11.38(1)(a)3. The spending\nlimit on fundraising by corporations for affiliated PACs was\nrecently raised to $20,000 or 20% of the amount the committee\nraised the previous year. See 2013 Wis. Act 153 § 21m.\n\n\nC. Chapter 11 in the Courts\n    Although Chapter 11 has been on the books for more than\n40 years, the Wisconsin Supreme Court has addressed it only\ntwice. In Gard v. State Elections Board, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1745888\"><a href=\"/opinion/1745888/gard-v-state-elections-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">809</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 826–29\n(Wis. 1990), the court upheld the limits on contributions to\ncandidates, relying on the distinction drawn in Buckley between\ncampaign contributions and expenditures. More relevant is\nElections Board v. Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, a major\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                23\n\ntest of the scope of the state’s regulatory authority under\nBuckley.\n\n\n   1. Elections Board v. Wisconsin Manufacturers &\n   Commerce\n    In the fall of 1996, an affiliate of Wisconsin Manufacturers &\nCommerce, Inc. (“WMC”), the state’s largest business group,\nsponsored radio and television ads naming several state\nlegislators who were on the November ballot. The ads were the\nkind that have become ubiquitous in each election cycle ever\nsince Buckley drew the regulatory line at express advocacy. The\nnarrator described the legislators’ voting records on particular\nissues—specifically, on the issues of taxes and crime—and\nurged listeners to call the lawmakers and voice their disap-\nproval. Wis. Mfrs. & Commerce, 597 N.W.2d at 724–25.\n    The targeted legislators waged a two-front legal battle to\nforce the ads off the air. First, they filed administrative com-\nplaints with the State Elections Board; second, they sued WMC\nand its affiliate seeking court orders enjoining the ads. Id. at\n725; see also WIS. STAT . § 11.66 (authorizing private suits by\nelectors to compel compliance with Chapter 11). The litigation\nstrategy was successful. Trial judges around the state ordered\nthe WMC affiliate to remove the ads from the air. Wis. Mfrs. &\nCommerce, 597 N.W.2d at 725.\n   When the election was over, the Elections Board took up\nthe administrative complaints, classified the ads as express\nadvocacy under Chapter 11, and ordered the affiliate to\nregister as a political committee and file retrospective and\n\f24                              Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\nprospective financial reports. Id. Predictably, the organization\nrefused to comply, so the Board filed an enforcement action\nseeking per diem monetary penalties and injunctive relief. Id.\nat 725–26. The trial court dismissed the case, holding that the\nBoard’s approach to the express-advocacy classification was\nunconstitutionally ad hoc and vague, amounted to retroactive\nrulemaking, and was not adequately tailored to satisfy First\nAmendment scrutiny. Id. at 726.\n    The state supreme court affirmed, but on the narrowest\nground. The court held that the Board had impermissibly\nengaged in retroactive rulemaking by “creating and attempting\nto apply [a] new, context-oriented interpretation of the\nstatutory term express advocacy” while adjudicating an\nadministrative complaint. Id. at 735. The court agreed with the\ntrial judge that “it would be profoundly unfair to apply a\npreviously unarticulated test, retroactively, to these defen-\ndants.” Id.\n    Having decided the case on this procedural ground, the\ncourt specifically declined to “craft a new standard of express\nadvocacy for the state of Wisconsin,” leaving that task to the\nlegislature or the Board. Id. at 736. But the court offered some\nguidance regarding the permissible scope of any standard the\nlegislature or agency might write. First, “Buckley stands for the\nproposition that it is unconstitutional to place reporting or\ndisclosure requirements on communications which do not\n‘expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified\ncandidate.’” Id. at 731 (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 80). Next, to\nqualify as “express advocacy” within the meaning of\nsection 11.01(16), a communication “must contain explicit\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                25\n\nlanguage advocating the election or defeat of a candidate who\nis clearly identified.” Id. Finally, the court allowed that any\nstatutory or regulatory definition of express advocacy “may\nencompass more than the specific magic words in Buckley\nfootnote 52,” but reminded legislators and regulators that the\ndefinition must be “limited to communications that include\nexplicit words of advocacy of election or defeat of a candidate.”\nId. at 737 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n   2. Campaign Finance Reform Is Tried and Fails in\n   Wisconsin\n    Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce was decided in July\n1999. The Elections Board thereafter amended its existing\nadministrative rule regarding the scope of regulated campaign\nactivity to conform to the state supreme court’s guidance on\nthe meaning of express advocacy. See EL BD § 1.28 (2001). At the\nsame time, however, state campaign-finance reformers were\nhard at work trying to move a proposal through the state\nlegislature expanding the regulatory scheme to cover issue ads\nlike those targeted in Wisconsin Manufacurers & Commerce. In\ndue course they succeeded, though as we’ll see, their victory\nwas short-lived.\n    In 2001 the legislature adopted major amendments to\nChapter 11 broadening the definition of “political purposes” to\ncover issue ads and other communications naming a candidate\nin the lead-up to an election and otherwise expanding the\nscope of the state’s regulation of political speech. 2001 Wis. Act\n109; see Wis. Realtors Ass’n v. Ponto (“Wis. Realtors I”),\n\f26                             Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2396622\"><a href=\"/opinion/2396622/wisconsin-realtors-assn-v-ponto/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Under the new\nlaw, any communication made within 60 days of an election\nthat “‘includes a reference to … a clearly identified candidate’”\nqualified as a communication made for political purposes, thus\ntriggering political-committee status and the full range of\nproscriptions and prescriptions in Chapter 11.

Realtors II”), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2310039\"><a href=\"/opinion/2310039/wisconsin-realtors-assn-v-ponto/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Act 109 § 1ty).\n    This expansion of the regulatory system was not designed\nto stick. The legislature included a nonseverability clause and\na fairly obvious poison pill. Section 1uck (yes, you read that\ncorrectly) prohibited independent groups from sponsoring any\ncommunications that referred to a candidate within 30 days of\nan election without first filing a report with the Elections Board\nproviding “‘the name of each candidate who will be supported\nor whose opponent will be opposed and the total disburse-\nments to be made.’” Id. at 1090 (quoting 2001 Wis. Act 109\n§ 1uck ) (emphasis omitted). Failure to file the minimum 31-day\nnotice meant a total speech blackout: no political communica-\ntions allowed in the final month of the campaign. Id.\n    Before the ink was dry on the governor’s signature, the new\nlaw was challenged in state and federal court. See Wis.\nRealtors I, 229 F. Supp. 2d at 891. The constitutional cloud over\nthe legislature’s handiwork was so conspicuous that lawmak-\ners included a nonstatutory provision directing the Attorney\nGeneral to “promptly commence” an original action in the\nstate supreme court asking the justices to decide whether the\nlaw was unconstitutional. Id. As it turned out, the federal court\nreached judgment first, striking down the advance-notice\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                          27\n\nprovision as an unconstitutional form of prior restraint on\nspeech. Wis. Realtors II, 233 F. Supp. 2d at 1090–93. By opera-\ntion of the nonseverability clause, the new law was invalid in\nits entirety. Id. at 1093; see also Wis. Right to Life, Inc. v.

New efforts to\nenlarge the scope of Chapter 11 have consistently failed to get\noff the ground.6 Instead, the momentum runs in the opposite\ndirection. The most recent statutory amendments are modestly\nderegulatory: The legislature raised the monetary threshold for\nPAC status (at $300, it’s still quite low), loosened restrictions on\ncontributions by lobbyists, and created an exemption for\ncertain uncompensated political activity on the Internet. See\n2013 Wis. Act 153.\n\n\nD. Important Federal Developments\n    As Wisconsin’s campaign-finance reform movement was\ncollapsing, Congress enacted the Bipartisan Campaign Reform\nAct of 2002—“BCRA” for short, but better known as the\n“McCain-Feingold” law for its principal Senate sponsors. Pub.\nL. No. 107-155, 116 Stat. 81. (codified at 2 U.S.C. §§ 438a, 441a–\n\n6\n A nonexhaustive list of failed campaign-finance reform bills includes\n2005 Assembly Bill 392; 2005 Senate Bill 538; 2007 Senate Bill 1, Dec. Spec.\nSess.; 2007 Senate Bill 12; 2007 Senate Bill 77; 2007 Senate Bill 182;\n2007 Assembly Bill 272; 2007 Assembly Bill 355; 2007 Assembly Bill 704;\n2009 Senate Bill 221; 2009 Assembly Bill 388; and 2009 Assembly Bill 812.\n\f28                            Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\n441i, 441k). McCain-Feingold brought a subset of issue advo-\ncacy into the federal regulatory sphere, introducing a new\ncategory of regulated political speech: “electioneering\ncommunication[s],” defined as “any broadcast, cable, or\nsatellite communication” that “refers to a clearly identified\ncandidate for Federal office” and appears within 60 days of a\nfederal general election or 30 days of a federal primary\nelection. 2 U.S.C. § 434(f)(3)(A).\n    Among other things, McCain-Feingold prohibited corpora-\ntions and labor unions from making contributions or expendi-\ntures for electioneering communications; express advocacy by\ncorporations and unions was already banned. See id. § 441b.\nThe new law also established a limited disclosure requirement\nfor expenditures for electioneering communications in excess\nof $10,000 in a calendar year. At that level of spending, the\nsponsoring group must file a statement with the Federal\nElection Commission disclosing its identity and place of\nbusiness, some basic information about the expenditure (the\namount and to whom it was paid), the election to which the\nexpenditure pertains, and the identity of donors who contrib-\nuted $1,000 or more for the electioneering communications. Id.\n§ 434(f)(1)–(2). In most cases the disclosure statement is due\nwithin 24 hours of a qualifying expenditure above the statutory\nthreshold. Id. § 434(f)(1), (4).\n\n\n     1. McConnell v.

As relevant here, the\nSupreme Court rejected a facial challenge to the ban on\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                          29\n\ncorporate sponsorship of electioneering communications,\nexplaining that the express-advocacy line drawn in Buckley was\n“an endpoint of statutory interpretation, not a first principle of\nconstitutional law.” Id. at 190. Still, the Court acknowledged\nthat the limitation was “born of an effort to avoid [the] consti-\ntutional infirmities” of vagueness and overbreadth, id. at 192,\nso the ultimate holding in McConnell was narrow: The federal\nban on corporate electioneering communications was facially\nvalid, but only “to the extent that … issue ads during the 30-\nand 60-day periods … are the functional equivalent of express\nadvocacy,” id. at 206 (emphasis added).\n    This left the door open for as-applied challenges. But the\nCourt did not explain what it meant by “functional equiva-\nlence.” Instead, it simply “assume[d] that the interests that\njustify the regulation of campaign speech might not apply to\nthe regulation of genuine issue ads.” Id. at 206 n.88. The\nconcept of “functional equivalence” acquired some content a\nfew years later when the ban on corporate electioneering\ncommunications returned to the Court, this time in the context\nof an as-applied challenge brought by our plaintiff here.

Wisconsin Right to Life II\n    In the summer of 2004, Wisconsin Right to Life prepared\ntelevision and radio ads criticizing the filibuster of federal\njudicial nominees and began to broadcast them in early\nAugust. Id. at 458–59. The ads named Wisconsin’s senators and\nurged listeners to call and tell them to oppose the filibuster. Id.\nBut BCRA’s blackout period before the federal primary\nelection commenced on August 15, so Wisconsin Right to Life\nsought declaratory and injunctive relief against the speech ban\nas applied to issue ads of this type. Id. at 460.\n    The Supreme Court held that Wisconsin Right to Life could\nnot be prohibited from using its general treasury funds to\nsponsor these ads, but the decision was fractured. Of the five\njustices in the majority, three would have overruled McConnell\nto the extent that it had facially upheld the ban on corporate\nelectioneering communications. See id. at 483–504 (Scalia, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in the judgment, joined by\nKennedy and Thomas, J.J.). Chief Justice Roberts, joined by\nJustice Alito, took a narrower path, concluding that the ads\nwere neither express advocacy nor its functional equivalent\nand thus could not be banned. Id. at 476–82 (opinion of\nRoberts, C.J.)\n    The Chief Justice explained that “[p]rior to BCRA, corpora-\ntions were free under federal law to use independent expendi-\ntures to engage in political speech so long as that speech did\nnot expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly\nidentified federal candidate.” Id. at 457. But BCRA “ma[de] it\na federal crime for any corporation to broadcast, shortly before\nan election, any communication that names a federal candidate\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                31\n\nfor elected office and is targeted to the electorate.” Id. at\n455–56. The law had “survive[d] strict scrutiny [in McConnell]\nto the extent it regulates express advocacy or its functional\nequivalent,” id. at 465, so if the antifilibuster ads were express\nadvocacy or its equivalent, that holding controlled unless\nrevisited and overruled, id. If, on the other hand, the ads were\nnot express advocacy or its equivalent—i.e., if they were\n“genuine issue ads”—then McConnell did not apply. Id.\n    “Express advocacy” had an established meaning under\nBuckley, but the concept of “functional equivalence” was new.\nIt was not clear how to determine on a case-by-case basis\nwhether a particular communication counted as the functional\nequivalent of express electoral advocacy. The Chief Justice\nprovided a test: “[A]n ad is the functional equivalent of express\nadvocacy only if the ad is susceptible of no reasonable interpre-\ntation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific\ncandidate.” Id. at 469–70. His lead opinion also provided a\nframework for applying the test: (1) [T]he inquiry “must be\nobjective, focusing on the substance of the communication\nrather than amorphous considerations of intent and effect,” id.\nat 469; (2) “contextual factors … should seldom play a signifi-\ncant role in the inquiry,” id. at 473–74; (3) because the govern-\nment has the burden of justifying restrictions on political\nspeech, the speaker gets the benefit of any doubt, id. at 464–65;\nand (4) if an ad “may reasonably be interpreted as something\nother than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candi-\ndate, … [then it is] not the functional equivalent of express\nadvocacy,” id. at 476.\n\f32                             Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\n   On this understanding of functional equivalence, the Chief\nJustice held that the antifilibuster ads\n       are plainly not the functional equivalent of\n       express advocacy. First, their content is consis-\n       tent with that of a genuine issue ad: The ads\n       focus on a legislative issue, take a position on the\n       issue, exhort the public to adopt that position,\n       and urge the public to contact public officials\n       with respect to the matter. Second, their content\n       lacks indicia of express advocacy: The ads do not\n       mention an election, candidacy, political party,\n       or challenger; and they do not take a position on\n       a candidate’s character, qualifications, or fitness\n       for office.\nId. at 470. Because the ads were neither express advocacy nor\nits equivalent, McConnell did not apply and the government\nhad to justify restricting the speech under strict scrutiny. It\ncould not do so. The ban on corporate electioneering communi-\ncations was unconstitutional as applied to Wisconsin Right to\nLife’s speech. Id. at 481.\n\n\nE. The Government Accountability Board Enters the Scene\n    In January 2008—six months after the Supreme Court\nissued its decision in Wisconsin Right to Life—the Government\nAccountability Board opened its doors as the new regulatory\nagency responsible for administering Wisconsin election law,\ntaking over for the dissolved Elections Board. At the time, the\npredecessor agency had been weighing new rulemaking to\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                        33\n\nbroaden the scope of the campaign-finance system to cover a\nsubset of issue ads akin to the “electioneering communica-\ntions” now covered by federal law. This proved to be a heavy\nregulatory lift. Restricting political speech is inherently\ncontroversial, and many stakeholders reasonably questioned\nwhether the agency had the statutory authority to add new\ncategories of regulated speech not covered by Chapter 11.8 The\neffort stalled in the Elections Board. The new agency picked up\nwhere its predecessor left off.\n    Recall that soon after the state supreme court decided\nWisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, the Elections Board\namended its existing administrative rule governing the scope\nof regulated activity to conform to the limits identified in the\ncourt’s opinion. The amended rule defined “political commit-\ntee” as “every committee which is formed primarily to influ-\nence elections or which is under the control of a candidate,”\nand also specified that\n           (2) Individuals other than candidates and\n        committees other than political committees are\n        subject to the applicable disclosure-related and\n        recordkeeping-related requirements of ch. 11,\n        Stats., only when they:\n\n\n\n\n8\n See GAB, Open Session A genda M aterials (M ar. 26, 2008), http://gab.wi.\ngov/sites/default/files/event/74/03_26_2008_agenda_materials_pdf_96273.\npdf.

Other individuals and\ngroups would be “subject to the applicable disclosure-related\nand recordkeeping-related requirements” of Chapter 11 only\nto the extent that they made contributions for political pur-\nposes or spent money for communications containing express\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                               35\n\nadvocacy (again, understood in the Buckley sense) or its\nfunctional equivalent (understood in the Wisconsin Right to\nLife II sense), assuming the very low dollar threshold—then\njust $25—was crossed. The reference to the “applicable\ndisclosure-related and recordkeeping-related requirements of\nChapter 11” was not further explained.\n    The new agency initially reaffirmed ElBd § 1.28 but thereaf-\nter embarked on a project aimed at bringing a wide swath of\nissue advocacy within the regulatory scheme.9 The Board\ndirected its staff to draft a new version of § 1.28 significantly\nexpanding its scope by adding a new category of regulated\ncommunications much broader than the federal “electioneering\ncommunications” at issue in McConnell and Wisconsin Right to\nLife II.10 The new GAB § 1.28 is central to the claims in this case;\nwe will reproduce it in a moment.

Id. at 321–22.\n    A three-judge district-court panel applied McConnell and\nrejected the challenge. Citizens United v. FEC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1369660\"><a href=\"/opinion/1369660/citizens-united-v-federal-election-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.D.C. 2008). The Supreme Court heard the case, then\nsurprised the political and legal worlds by ordering it rebriefed\non the question of the continued viability of McConnell. Citizens\nUnited, 558 U.S. at 322. Following reargument, the Court issued\nits course-changing decision in January 2010.\n    The Court began by holding that Hillary and the ads\npromoting it were the functional equivalent of express advo-\ncacy under Wisconsin Right to Life II and thus fell within\nBCRA’s ban on corporate electioneering communications. Id.\nat 324–25. This brought the full implications of McConnell’s\nfacial holding starkly into focus: If a movie sponsored by a\ncorporation could be banned during an election cycle, then so\ncould a book or a pamphlet. Id. at 333. The Court observed that\nbanning political expenditures by corporations is functionally\na total “ban on corporate speech,” even though “a PAC created\nby a corporation can still speak.” Id. at 337. “PACs are burden-\nsome alternatives … [,] expensive to administer and subject to\nextensive regulations,” id., and they must “comply with these\nregulations just to speak,” id. at 338. Because these regulatory\n\f38                              Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\nburdens are “onerous,” the PAC system is nearly “the equiva-\nlent of prior restraint.” Id. at 335. And because the law was “an\noutright ban, backed by criminal sanctions,” id. at 337, its\nchilling effect on core First Amendment speech rights was\nsevere, making ad hoc, as-applied remedies seriously deficient,\nid. at 335–37. Accordingly, the Court reconsidered and partially\noverruled McConnell, facially invalidating the ban on corporate\nand union election-related spending. Id. at 365–66 (also\noverruling Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112398\"><a href=\"/opinion/112398/austin-v-michigan-chamber-of-commerce/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">652</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1990), on which McConnell had relied).\n    Importantly here, Citizens United restored some earlier\nunderstandings about the constitutional limits on the govern-\nment’s authority to regulate election-related speech. First, the\nCourt reinvigorated the principle that “political speech does\nnot lose First Amendment protection ‘simply because its source\nis a corporation,’” id. at 342 (quoting First Nat’l Bank of Bos. v.\nBellotti, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109836\"><a href=\"/opinion/109836/first-nat-bank-of-boston-v-bellotti/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 784 (1978)), and held as a categorical\nmatter that the government may not restrict political speech\n“based on a speaker’s corporate identity,” id. at 347. Second,\nthe Court held that the only public interest strong enough to\njustify restricting election-related speech is the interest in\npreventing quid pro quo corruption or the appearance of\ncorruption. Id. at 359–61. Third, the Court concluded that\npolitical spending by independent groups does not carry the\nrisk of this kind of corruption because “[b]y definition, an\nindependent expenditure is political speech presented to the\nelectorate that is not coordinated with a candidate.” Id. at 360.\nAccordingly, the Court held as a matter of law that “inde-\npendent expenditures, including those made by corporations,\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                   39\n\ndo not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.”\nId. at 357.\n   Without an anticorruption rationale to support it, BCRA’s\nban on corporate electioneering communications was facially\nunconstitutional: “No sufficient governmental interest justifies\nlimits on the political speech of nonprofit or for-profit\ncorporations.” Id. at 365.\n    The Court took a different approach to the disclaimer and\ndisclosure requirements, although this part of the opinion is\nquite brief. Following the doctrine established in Buckley, the\nCourt applied an intermediate standard of review—called\n“exacting scrutiny,” but the label isn’t important—and re-\nquired a showing of “a ‘substantial relation’ between the\ndisclosure requirement and a ‘sufficiently important’ govern-\nmental interest.” Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 366–67 (quoting\nBuckley, 424 U.S. at 64, 66). The public’s informational interest\nin knowing the sponsorship and funding sources of election-\nrelated ads had long been accepted as sufficiently important to\njustify disclosure and disclaimer rules. Id. at 367. So the only\nreal question in Citizens United was the closeness of the fit\nbetween that interest and the specific requirements imposed on\ngroups that sponsor electioneering communications. Id.\n    The federal disclaimer provision requires only that the ad\nidentify in a “clearly spoken manner” the name of the group\nresponsible for its content, display the group’s name and\naddress (or web address), and state that the ad is “not autho-\nrized by any candidate or candidate’s committee.” 2 U.S.C.\n§ 441d(d)(2), (a)(3); see also Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 366. This\nmodest requirement easily cleared the intermediate-scrutiny\n\f40                             Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\nhurdle. The Court held that the disclaimer was adequately\ntailored to serve the purpose of “provid[ing] the electorate\nwith information” and also “avoid confusion by making clear\nthat the ads are not funded by a candidate or political party.”\nCitizens United, 558 U.S. at 368 (upholding the disclaimer rule\nas applied to the ads); see also id. at 371 (summarily upholding\nthe disclaimer rule as applied to the movie).\n     The Court’s evaluation of the disclosure provision entailed\nlittle additional discussion. BCRA requires that “any person\nwho spends more than $10,000 on electioneering communica-\ntions within a calendar year” must file a disclosure statement\nwith the FEC identifying “the person making the expenditure,\nthe amount of the expenditure, the election to which the\ncommunication was directed, and the names of certain contri-\nbutors [donors who contributed $1,000 or more to the\nexpenditure].” Id. at 366 (citing 2 U.S.C. § 434(f)(1)–(2)). This\none-time, event-driven disclosure rule is far less burdensome\nthan the comprehensive registration and reporting system\nimposed on political committees; the Court upheld it without\nmuch comment. Id. at 368–69 (upholding the disclosure rule\nwith respect to the ads); see also id. at 371 (summarily uphold-\ning the disclosure rule with respect to the movie). The Court\ndid, however, affirmatively reject the argument that the\ndisclosure rule for electioneering communications should be\nlimited to speech that is the functional equivalent of express\nadvocacy. Id. at 369 (“[W]e reject Citizens United’s contention\nthat the disclosure requirements must be limited to speech that\nis the functional equivalent of express advocacy.”). It’s not\nclear why the Court addressed this argument; it had earlier\nconcluded that Hillary and the ads promoting it were the\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                       41\n\nequivalent of express advocacy, so this argument no longer\nmattered. Id. at 324–25.\n    Finally, the Court reaffirmed that the disclosure require-\nment might be unconstitutional as applied to particular groups\n“if there were a reasonable probability that the group’s\nmembers would face threats, harassment, or reprisals if their\nnames were disclosed.” Id. at 370 (citing McConnell, 540 U.S. at\n198). Citizens United had no such evidence, so there was no\nimpediment to applying the disclosure rule to it. Id.\n\n\nG. Wisconsin Regulators React\n    Citizens United has obvious and significant implications for\nChapter 11, so it comes as a bit of a surprise that the Wisconsin\nlegislature has not amended the statute to account for the\nchanges wrought by the decision. The GAB has not been\nsimilarly silent.\n    In response to Citizens United, the Board immediately\nannounced that it would not enforce section 11.38(1)(a)1, the\nstatutory ban on corporate political expenditures.12 The agency\nthen promulgated an emergency rule suspending the statutory\nban and creating a new category of political speakers—\n“independent disbursement organizations”—that would\nthenceforward be subject to the organizational, registration,\nand reporting requirements of Chapter 11.

See generally\nWIS. STAT. § 227.24. The extensions were approved, and the\nfinal rule became effective on July 1, 2012, while this litigation\nwas underway. 678 Wis. Admin. Reg. 43 (June 30, 2012).\n     Briefly, the new rule suspends section 11.38(1)(a)1, the\nstatutory ban on political spending by corporations, “until such\ntime as a court having jurisdiction in the State of Wisconsin\nrules that a corporation … may constitutionally be restricted\nfrom making an independent disbursement.” WIS. ADMIN .\nCODE GAB § 1.91(2). The rule also requires every “organiza-\ntion” that independently raises and spends money for political\nspeech to comply with the registration and reporting require-\nments applicable to political committees. See id. § 1.91(3)–(8).\nMore specifically, the rule applies most PAC duties to organi-\nzations that ”accept[] contributions for, incur obligations for, or\nmak[e] an independent disbursement exceeding $25 in aggre-\ngate during a calendar year.” Id. § 1.91(3); see id. § 1.91(4)–(8).\n“Organization” is not a statutory term; the rule defines it\nbroadly to include any person (including any association,\npartnership, or corporation), but not individuals and commit-\ntees already required to register and report under Chapter 11.\nId. § 1.91(1)(g)–(h). Though lengthy, GAB § 1.91 is central to the\nclaims in this case; we reproduce it in full in the appendix.\n\n\n13\n See GAB, Open Session M inutes (M ay 10, 2010), http://gab.wi.gov/sites/\ndefault/files/event/74/05_10_10_open_session_m inutes_final_pdf_16560.\npdf; 653 Wis.

The new\nrule was published in final form on July 31, 2010, and became\neffective the next day. 655 Wis. Admin. Reg. 41 (July 31, 2010).\nIn brief, the new version of GAB § 1.28 removes the express-\nadvocacy limitation from the old rule, introduces broad new\ndefinitions of “communication” and “political purpose,” and\ncreates a conclusive presumption that almost anything said\nabout a candidate at election time triggers all the restrictions\nand requirements of Chapter 11. This rule is also central to the\nclaims in this case; we reproduce it here. To better illustrate the\nexpansive scope of the new rule, deletions from the old rule are\nmarked with strikeouts and new language is underlined:\n       GAB 1.28 Scope of regulated activity; election\n       of candidates.\n       (1) Definitions.

Much Litigation Ensues\n    The two new rules were controversial and obvious candi-\ndates for constitutional challenge. Within a fortnight three\nlawsuits were filed seeking injunctive relief against one or both\nof the rules. The first was Wisconsin Club for Growth, Inc. v.\nMyse, a federal action filed in the Western District of Wiscon-\nsin. The plaintiffs there challenged GAB § 1.28 on two grounds:\n(1) the agency lacked the statutory authority to expand the\nscope of the statutory scheme; and (2) the new rule is over-\nbroad and impermissibly burdens free-speech rights in\nviolation of the First Amendment. See Complaint at 13–17, Wis.\nClub for Growth, Inc. v. Myse, No. 10-cv-427-wmc (W.D. Wis.\nfiled July 31, 2010).\n    Wisconsin Right to Life filed this suit in the Eastern District\na few days later. The third suit was an original action initiated\nin the state supreme court. See Wis. Prosperity Network v. Myse,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">810</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Wis. 2012). Filed on August 9, 2010, the\noriginal action raised essentially the same claims as the\nWisconsin Club for Growth litigation. The state high court\nimmediately issued an order enjoining enforcement of GAB\n§ 1.28 pending further review. Id. at 356–57.\n   That move affected the two federal cases; all three lawsuits\nchallenged GAB § 1.28. This case challenges many other laws\nas well, but the district judge abstained to await the outcome\n\n\n14\n     Subsection (4), not relevant here, has been omitted.\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                47\n\nof the original action in the state supreme court, putting all the\nclaims on indefinite hold. Barland I, 664 F.3d at 143.\n    Meanwhile, over in the Western District, the Board swiftly\nthrew in the towel. Less than two weeks after Wisconsin Club\nfor Growth was filed, the parties stipulated to the entry of final\njudgment, agreeing that the court “may enter a permanent\ninjunction, order, and judgment enjoining the application or\nenforcement of the second sentence of Wis. Admin. GAB\n§ 1.28(3)(b).” Stipulation, Wis. Club for Growth,\nNo. 10-cv-427-wmc, ECF No. 22-1. (To remind the reader: The\nsecond sentence of § 1.28(3)(b) is a conclusive presumption that\nalmost anything said about a candidate in any medium of\npublic expression within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a\ngeneral election counts as a communication made for a\n“political purpose,” triggering political-committee status and\nthe other restrictions and requirements of Chapter 11.) The\nstipulation expressly resolved the first claim in the case, which\nhad challenged § 1.28 as ultra vires. If the court accepted the\nstipulation, the plaintiffs agreed to dismiss their First Amend-\nment claim without prejudice.\n    The court did not accept the stipulation. The judge in the\nWestern District opted to abstain in favor of the state supreme\ncourt, as his colleague in the Eastern District had done. See Wis.\nClub for Growth, Inc. v.

With both federal\nactions stayed and the state supreme court’s place-holding\ninjunction casting significant doubt on the new rule, the Board\nwent back to the drawing board and promulgated an\n\f48                                 Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\nemergency rule eliminating the questionable second sentence\nof GAB § 1.28(3)(b).15\n                               *   *   *\n    The following year was an extraordinary one in Wisconsin\npolitical history, as we explained in Barland I and need not\nrepeat here. 664 F.3d at 144–45. In anticipation of unprece-\ndented legislative recall elections, the Wisconsin Right to Life\nState PAC returned to the district court and sought relief from\nthe stay for the limited purpose of litigating its challenge to\nsection 11.26(4), the aggregate limit on annual contributions to\ncandidates, parties, and political committees. Id. at 145. The\ndistrict judge declined to lift the stay, but we vacated and\nremanded. Id. at 154–55. Citizens United had categorically\nremoved the anticorruption rationale as a justification for\ncampaign-finance restrictions on independent political groups.\nThis left “no valid governmental interest sufficient to justify\nimposing limits on fundraising by independent-expenditure\norganizations.” Id. at 154. We found the aggregate contribution\nlimit unconstitutional as applied to independent-expenditure\ngroups and their donors and instructed the district court to\nenter a permanent injunction enjoining its enforcement. Id. at\n155.\n   The rest of the case remained stayed pending resolution of\nthe original action in the state supreme court, but that court\n\n\n15\n  See M emorandum from Kevin J.

Several months\nearlier, however, the GAB had approved a permanent rule\nremoving the problematic second sentence of § 1.28(3)(b).16 But\nthe new rule remains mired in the administrative process and\nis not yet on the books. The emergency rule has now expired,17\nso the 2010 version of GAB § 1.28 continues in effect.\n                                *    *   *\n    Neither party saw fit to bring the regulatory and litigation\nhistory of GAB § 1.28 to our attention until we asked about it\nin a supplemental briefing order.

In his supplemental brief, he explained\nthat it would “[not] have been helpful … to go into this\nhistory” because “the history has become moot.” That’s an\nastonishing statement. History does not “become moot.” And\nthe Board’s retreat from the 2010 rule—the rapid stipulation in\nWisconsin Club for Growth, the emergency rule, and the revised\npermanent rule—strongly suggest a concession that § 1.28 is\nultra vires, and perhaps also that it is unconstitutional.

Now that we have it, we’re not sure what to make\nof counsel’s belated representation that the Board “intends to\ncontinue to honor the stipulation.” The Board has not acted on\nthis intent, at least as far as we’re told, and counsel’s statement\nis in any event vague. The stipulation was never reduced to\njudgment. Order, Wis. Club for Growth, No. 10-cv-427-wmc,\nECF No. 46 (filed on Feb. 28, 2013) (dismissing case). Political\nspeakers in Wisconsin can’t rely on the agency’s unofficial\nexpression of intent to refrain from enforcing its rules. The 2010\nversion of GAB § 1.28 remains in force and encumbers the free-\nspeech rights of anyone who says almost anything about a\ncandidate near an election. We must judge the Board’s actions,\nnot its inchoate intent.\n                            *    *   *\n    After the state supreme court deadlocked, Wisconsin Right\nto Life roused this case from its slumber, filed an amended\ncomplaint, and moved for a preliminary injunction on the rest\nof its claims, which challenge the following statutes and rules:\n     • Section 11.38(1), the ban on political spending by\n       corporations;\n     • Section 11.38(1)(a)3, the cap on the amount a corpora-\n       tion may spend to raise money for an affiliated political\n       committee;\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                              51\n\n   • Sections 11.01(4) (defining “committee” and “political\n     committee”), 11.01(6) (defining “contribution”), 11.01(7)\n     (defining “disbursement”), and 11.01(16) (defining\n     “political purposes”), to the extent that these definitions\n     trigger (either independently or with the administrative\n     rules) PAC status and other restrictions and require-\n     ments for independent groups not under the control of\n     a candidate or candidate’s committee and not engaged\n     in express election advocacy as their major purpose;\n   • The two new administrative rules—GAB §§ 1.28 and\n     1.91—promulgated in the wake of Citizens United to\n     expand the scope of the regulatory scheme and impose\n     PAC status or PAC-like duties and restrictions on newly\n     liberated independent political speakers;\n   • Sections 11.12(5)–(6), the 24-hour-reporting requirement\n     for certain late contributions and expenditures (recently\n     amended to enlarge the reporting time to 48 hours);\n   • Section 11.06(7), which requires any independent group\n     that wants to spend money to support or oppose a\n     candidate for state or local office to file an oath affirm-\n     ing that the spending is not coordinated with the\n     candidate or the candidate’s agent (a related administra-\n     tive rule, GAB § 1.42(1), is also challenged); and\n   • GAB § 1.42(5), which requires that independent political\n     communications include a lengthy disclaimer.\n    In an oral ruling, the district judge granted the motion in\npart. The judge agreed that the plaintiffs had “some likelihood\nof success” on their claim that section 11.38(1)(a)1, the ban on\n\f52                                  Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\ncorporate political speech, was unconstitutional “as applied\n… and facially.” He also agreed that the lengthy disclaimer for\nindependent political messages—GAB § 1.42(5)—was “unduly\nburdensome” as applied to “ads less than 30 seconds in length”\nand enjoined it to that extent. The judge held that the challenge\nto GAB § 1.91 was moot and otherwise denied preliminary\ninjunctive relief.\n    In a written order memorializing this ruling, the court\nentered a preliminary injunction “as to count nine … with\nrespect to the corporate disbursement ban” and also “as to\ncount five … with respect to ads that are less than 30 seconds\nin length.” In all other respects, the court denied the motion for\na preliminary injunction. Wisconsin Right to Life appealed.18\nSee 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1) (authorizing an interlocutory appeal\nfrom an order granting or denying an injunction).\n\n\n\n\n18\n  Actually, Wisconsin Right to Life filed three notices of appeal. The first\n(No. 12-2915) is an appeal from a claimed “constructive denial” of the\nmotion for a preliminary injunction; that appeal was premature and is\ndismissed. The second (No. 12-3046) is an appeal from the district court’s\norder granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs’ motion for a\npreliminary injunction; that appeal is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1).\nThe third (No. 12-3158) is an appeal from the district court’s order denying\nan injunction pending appeal, but the plaintiffs did not seek an injunction\npending appeal in this court; that appeal is dismissed.\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                  53\n\n                           II. Analysis\nA. Rule 65(d)(1)\n    Although the parties have not raised it, we note a flaw in\nthe form of the district court’s injunction order. Rule 65\nrequires that every injunction order must “state the reasons\nwhy it issued,” “state its terms specifically,” and “describe in\nreasonable detail—and not by referring to the complaint or\nother document—the act or acts restrained or required.” FED .\nR. CIV . P. 65(d)(1). The court’s written order summarily enters\na preliminary injunction “with respect to” certain parts of\ncount five and count nine, which are only very generally\ndescribed. That’s not a proper injunction order. A reader\nwould have to consult the pleadings and a transcript of the\nhearing to learn the scope of the injunction. On remand the\ndistrict court will have to enter a new injunction to conform to\nthis opinion and should take care to comply with the specificity\nrequirements of Rule 65(d)(1).\n\n\nB. Injunction Standards\n    To obtain a preliminary injunction, the moving party must\nshow that it has “(1) no adequate remedy at law and will suffer\nirreparable harm if a preliminary injunction is denied and\n(2) some likelihood of success on the merits.” Ezell v. City of\nChicago, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">651</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">684</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 694 (7th Cir. 2011). If this showing is\nmade, “the court weighs the competing harms to the parties if\nan injunction is granted or denied and also considers the public\ninterest.” Korte v. Sebelius, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">735</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">654</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 665 (7th Cir. 2013). The\n“equitable balancing proceeds on a sliding-scale analysis; the\n\f54                             Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\ngreater the likelihood of success on the merits, the less heavily\nthe balance of harms must tip in the moving party’s favor.” Id.\n    In First Amendment cases, however, the likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits is usually the decisive factor. “[T]he loss\nof First Amendment freedoms … unquestionably constitutes\nirreparable injury,” and “injunctions protecting First Amend-\nment freedoms are always in the public interest.” ACLU v.\nAlvarez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799453\"><a href=\"/opinion/799453/american-civil-liberties-union-of-ill-v-alvarez/\"><span class=\"volume\">679</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">583</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 589, 590 (7th Cir. 2012) (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).

Ct. at\n1452 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n    This case is only nominally in a “preliminary” stage. The\nclaims have been tested through several rounds of briefing\nboth in the district court and on appeal. Multiple statutes and\nrules are challenged, both facially and “as applied,” but few of\nthe claims depend on specific application facts. See Ezell,\n651 F.3d at 697 (“In a facial constitutional challenge, individual\napplication facts do not matter.”). There are no factual disputes\nfor trial. We are confronted with purely legal questions, which\nwe review de novo. See Korte, 735 F.3d at 665. As in Barland I,\nour resolution of the disputed legal issues has the effect of\nrequiring the entry of a permanent injunction enjoining the\nenforcement of the unconstitutional provisions. 664 F.3d at 155.\nIndeed, the Board concedes that some of the challenged\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                 55\n\nstatutes and rules are unconstitutional or require a limiting\nconstruction, so we start there.\n\n\nC. Concessions of Unconstitutionality\n   1. Section 11.38(1)(a)1, the Ban on Corporate Political\n   Expenditures\n    The Board concedes, as it must, that Wisconsin’s ban on\ncorporate political expenditures, section 11.38(1)(a)1, is facially\nunconstitutional. The state law is indistinguishable from the\nfederal statute at issue in Citizens United and must suffer the\nsame fate. See Am. Tradition P’ship v.

Section 11.38(1)(a)3, the Cap on Corporate Fundraising\n     for an Affiliated PAC\n    The Board also agrees that section 11.38(1)(a)3 is unconsti-\ntutional. That subsection of the statute caps the amount a\ncorporation may spend to solicit contributions to an affiliated\nPAC. Originally set at $500, the cap was recently raised to\n$20,000 or 20% of the prior year’s contributions. See 2013 Wis.\nAct 153 § 21m. The amendment does not affect the constitu-\ntional analysis. The statute is plainly unconstitutional under\nthe rationale of Citizens United and our decision in Barland I, as\nthe Board concedes. But the district court did not enjoin it.\n    The Board’s counsel advises us that the Board will not\nenforce the statute against Wisconsin Right to Life and its state\nPAC, but the no-enforcement pledge is good for them only, not\nother independent groups in Wisconsin.

The Board\nhasn’t raised the voluntary-cessation doctrine, and its inconsis-\ntent and shifting positions do not give us much confidence in\nits representation that it will not enforce the statute. By not\nfully disclaiming the right to enforce this facially invalid\nstatute, the Board’s halfhearted concession leaves us with no\nassurance that it will continue to recognize its unconstitutional-\nity.\n    To repeat what we said in Barland I: “[A]fter Citizens United\nthere is no valid governmental interest sufficient to justify\nimposing limits on fundraising by independent-expenditure\norganizations.” 664 F.3d at 154.

GAB § 1.42(5), the Lengthy Regulatory Disclaimer\n   The Board also admits that GAB § 1.42(5), the wordy\nregulatory disclaimer, is unconstitutional as applied to 30-\nsecond radio ads. The extra verbiage required by the rule goes\nwell beyond the short disclaimer required by statute. But it\nsimply repeats—in 50 extra words—the very same point: that\nthe political message was not authorized by a candidate or a\n\f58                                        Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\ncandidate’s agent or committee.19 The Board has not identified\nany regulatory purpose for the extra words, which consume a\nsignificant amount of paid advertising time in a broadcast ad.\nWe’re told that for television ads the regulatory disclaimer\nmay appear in written form and need not be spoken. Wiscon-\nsin Right to Life has challenged the rule only as applied to 30-\nsecond radio ads, and the Board has conceded that claim. In\nlight of this concession, the Board hasn’t offered any reason for\nthe long and repetitive regulatory disclaimer, and frankly we\ncan’t see the point of requiring it in ads of any length. But the\nclaim is limited to 30-second radio ads.\n    The district court granted a preliminary injunction on this\nclaim, but we note an error in the court’s written order, which\nenjoins GAB § 1.42(5) “with respect to ads that are less than\n30 seconds in length.” (Emphasis added.) Everyone understood\nthat the claim concerned 30-second ads; while this implicitly\nincludes ads of shorter duration, the injunction should not be\nlimited to ads of “less than” 30 seconds. On remand the court\n\n\n\n\n19\n  The disclaimer required by statute is: “Not authorized by any candidate\nor candidate’s agent or committee.” W IS . S TAT . § 11.30(2)(d). The disclaimer\nrequired by the rule is:\n\n         The committee (individual) is the sole source of this\n         communication and the committee (individual) did not act\n         in cooperation or consultation with, and in concert with, or\n         at the request or suggestion of any candidate or any agent\n         or authorized committee of a candidate who is supported\n         or opposed by this communication.\n\nW IS .

Section 11.01(16), the Statutory Definition of “Political\n     Purposes,” and GAB § 1.28(1), the Regulatory Definition of\n     “Political Committee”\n   The Board also agrees that the statutory definition of\n“political purposes,” which triggers PAC duties and other\nrequirements and restrictions, is vague and overbroad in the\nsense meant by Buckley and requires a limiting construction.20\nThe Board likewise agrees that the regulatory definition of\n“political committee” is similarly vague and overbroad and\nmust be narrowly construed.\n    Section 11.01(16) provides that “[a]n act is for ‘political\npurposes’ when it is done for the purpose of influencing the\nelection or nomination for election of any individual to state or\nlocal office,” or “for the purpose of influencing the recall from or\nretention in office of an individual holding a state or local\noffice,” or “attempting to influence an endorsement or nomina-\ntion to be made at a convention of political party members.”\n\n\n\n20\n  Again, Chapter 11 is structured so that political-committee requirements\nand the other prescriptions and proscriptions of the regulatory scheme are\ntriggered indirectly, by the making of contributions and disbursements. See\nW IS . S TAT . § 11.01(4) (defining “committee”); § 11.01(6) (“contribution”);\n§ 11.01(7) (“disbursement”); § 11.05 (requiring registration); § 11.06\n(reporting); §§ 11.12 and 11.16 (permitting only a registered treasurer to\nreceive contributions or make disbursements); § 11.26 (limiting contribu-\ntions).\n\f60                            Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\nWIS. STAT . § 11.01(16), (16)(a)2 (emphases added). GAB\n§ 1.28(1)(a) provides that “‘[p]olitical committee’ means every\ncommittee which is formed primarily to influence elections or\nwhich is under the control of a candidate.” GAB 1.28(1)(a)\n(emphasis added).\n    The “influence an election” language in both definitions\nraises the same vagueness and overbreadth concerns that were\npresent in federal law at the time of Buckley. The Court held\nthat this kind of broad and imprecise language risks chilling\nissue advocacy, which may not be regulated; the same reason-\ning applies here. The Board acknowledges as much and\nsuggests a limiting construction to confine the definitions to\nexpress advocacy and its functional equivalent. That’s how the\nAttorney General and the state supreme court have under-\nstood the statute. See Wis. Mfrs. & Commerce, 597 N.W.2d at\n728–31; 65 Op. Atty. Gen. 145.\n    As we’ve noted, after Buckley the legislature amended the\nstatutory definition of “political purposes” to incorporate an\nexpress-advocacy limitation. But the broad “influencing”\nlanguage remains in the statute, and the express-advocacy\nlimitation carries some residual vagueness and overbreadth:\n“Acts which are for ‘political purposes’ include but are not\nlimited to … [t]he making of a communication which expressly\nadvocates the election, defeat, recall or retention of a clearly\nidentified candidate … .” WIS. STAT . § 11.01(16)(a)1 (emphasis\nadded). The “not limited to” language holds the potential for\nregulatory mischief. Perhaps it was included to leave room for\nregulation of the “functional equivalent” of express advocacy\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                          61\n\nas that term was later explained in Wisconsin Right to Life II.21\nBeyond that, however, the language contains persistent\nvagueness and overbreadth.\n    As federal judges “we are ‘without power to adopt a\nnarrowing construction of a state statute unless such a con-\nstruction is reasonable and readily apparent.’” Stenberg v.\nCarhart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118387\"><a href=\"/opinion/118387/stenberg-v-carhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">914</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 944 (2000) (quoting Boos v.

The “unless” clause in this important federal-\nism principle should be invoked sparingly and with caution. A\nfederal court cannot “make a binding interpretation of a state\nstatute, endeavoring to trim its vague provisions; if it attempts\na narrowing interpretation that deviates widely from the\nstatute’s apparent meaning it is taking a big risk that the state\nwill reject the interpretation.” Ctr. for Individual Freedom v.\nMadigan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">697</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">464</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 500 (7th Cir. 2012) (Posner, J., concur-\nring in part and dissenting in part). The alternative is to strike\nthe statute and let the state legislature or the state supreme\ncourt bring it into conformity with the federal Constitution.\n    We’re confident that the proposed narrowing construction\nis reasonable, readily apparent, and likely to be approved by\nthe state courts. The state’s highest court and its Attorney\n\n\n21\n  The “not limited to” language may have been included to account for the\nfact that the definition of “political purposes” applies comprehensively to\ncandidates, their connected committees, parties, independent groups, and\nindividuals. Communications by candidates and their connected commit-\ntees obviously are “unambiguously related to the campaign” of a\nparticular candidate. Buckley v. Valeo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109380\"><a href=\"/opinion/109380/buckley-v-valeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 80 (1976). As applied to\npolitical speech by noncandidates and outside groups, however, the\ndefinition raises vagueness and overbreadth concerns.\n\f62                             Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\nGeneral have acknowledged that when Chapter 11 is applied\nbeyond candidates, their committees, and political parties, it\nmust be narrowly construed to comply with Buckley’s express-\nadvocacy limitation; the administration of the state’s\ncampaign-finance system has generally reflected this under-\nstanding for many decades. Accordingly, we accept the\nproposed narrowing construction. As applied to political\nspeakers other than candidates, their committees, and political\nparties, the statutory definition of “political purposes” in\nsection 11.01(16) and the regulatory definition of “political\ncommittee” in GAB § 1.28(1)(a) are limited to express advocacy\nand its functional equivalent as those terms were explained in\nBuckley and Wisconsin Right to Life II.\n\n\nD. Other Provisions\n     1. GAB § 1.28 and GAB § 1.91\n    Wisconsin Right to Life argues that GAB §§ 1.28 and 1.91\nunconstitutionally expand the reach of the regulatory scheme\nby imposing political-committee status and other restrictions\non groups engaged in issue advocacy and “PAC-like” burdens\non independent political groups not engaged in express\nadvocacy or its equivalent as their major purpose. The argu-\nment is fuzzy, but we understand it to be twofold: (1) the rules\ncast too wide a net by capturing unregulable issue advocacy,\neither explicitly or by introducing uncertainty; and (2) the rules\nimpermissibly impose PAC status or “PAC-like” burdens on\nissue-advocacy groups not engaged in express advocacy as\ntheir major purpose. The complaints overlap, and both are\nvalid.\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                63\n\n     As we’ve explained, the 2010 version of GAB § 1.28 deleted\nthe express-advocacy limitation in the old rule and added\nlanguage specifically designed to bring issue advocacy within\nthe scope of the state’s PAC regulatory system. That was the\nexplicit goal; the Board sought to do by regulation what state\nlawmakers had failed to do by legislation. Under GAB § 1.28,\nall independent political speakers—individuals and all types\nof organizational associations—are “subject to the applicable\nrequirements of ch. 11, Stats, when they … [m]ake a communi-\ncation for a political purpose.” GAB § 1.28(2)(c). The rule\ndefines “communication” and “political purpose” quite\nexpansively.\n    “‘Communication’ means any printed advertisement,\nbillboard, handbill, sample ballot, television or radio advertise-\nment, telephone call, e-mail, internet posting, and any other\nform of communication that may be utilized for a political\npurpose.” Id. § 1.28(1)(b). This goes well beyond the federal\ndefinition of electioneering communications, which includes\nonly “broadcast, cable, or satellite communication,” 2 U.S.C.\n§ 434(f)(3)(A)(i), and requires disclosure only when the\nexpenditure exceeds $10,000, id. § 434(f)(1).\n    The definition of “political purpose” is similarly compre-\nhensive. No longer confined to express advocacy and its\nfunctional equivalent, the rule covers any communication made\nwithin 30 days of a primary, or 60 days of a general election,\nthat names or depicts a “clearly identified candidate” and\nrefers to the candidate’s “personal qualities, character, or\nfitness” or “supports or condemns” the candidate’s record or\n“position or stance on issues.” GAB § 1.28(3)(b). Any\n\f64                             Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\ncommunication of this type is conclusively treated as an\n“appeal to vote,” see id., thus triggering political-committee\nstatus and other statutory and regulatory restrictions if the\nvery low contribution or spending threshold is crossed.\n    The rule is fatally vague and overbroad in several respects.\nFirst, it sweeps a far wider universe of political speech into the\n“applicable requirements of chap. 11, Stats.” than does\nChapter 11 itself, introducing confusion for ordinary political\nspeakers who lack the background or assistance of a campaign-\nfinance lawyer. In this regard, it may also exceed the Board’s\nregulatory authority. The rule goes beyond the bounds of the\nstatute itself, which under Buckley and Wisconsin Right to Life II\nmust be narrowly construed to apply only to independent\nspending for express advocacy and its functional equivalent, as\nthe Board has acknowledged. The ultra vires objection was\nbefore the state supreme court in Wisconsin Prosperity Network\nand was also raised in Wisconsin Club for Growth. In the federal\ncase, the Board conceded the claim. In the state supreme court,\nhowever, the Board took a different position, defending its\nauthority to enlarge the scope of the statutory scheme.\n    On the regulatory side of things, the agency’s position also\nhas shifted. When the rule was initially challenged, the Board\nissued an emergency rule removing the objectionable second\nsentence of subsection (3)(b)—the conclusive presumption that\ntreats all issue advocacy during the 30/60-day preelection\nperiods as express advocacy. With the emergency rule in place,\nthe Board began the process of making the scaled-back rule\npermanent. In the meantime, however, the emergency rule\nexpired, and the revised permanent rule has not yet run the\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                               65\n\nadministrative gauntlet. So the 2010 rule remains in force and\nthe Board defends it here, despite its checkered history and\nserious doubt about the agency’s statutory authority to\nregulate this broadly.\n    Setting aside the ultra vires question, which is not specifi-\ncally raised, the second sentence of subsection (3)(b) is uncon-\nstitutionally vague and overbroad in the sense meant by\nBuckley. In the First Amendment context, the doctrines of\nvagueness and overbreadth overlap; both are premised on\nconcerns about chilling constitutionally protected speech.\nKolender v.

In this context, we\ndon’t need to ask whether the challenged law reaches a\nsubstantial amount of protected speech; by definition, it does,\nbecause all political speech is protected. That’s precisely why\nBuckley held that the “‘government may regulate in th[is] area\nonly with narrow specificity,’” 424 U.S. at 41 n.48 (quoting\nButton, 371 U.S. at 433), and drew the constitutional line at\nexpress election advocacy. So the more focused inquiry here is\nwhether this regulation steers clear of the line drawn in\nBuckley.\n   Plainly it does not. For some campaign-finance laws,\nhowever, Citizens United has relaxed Buckley’s express-\nadvocacy boundary line. As we’ve explained, the Court\ndeclined to apply the express-advocacy limitation to the\nfederal disclosure and disclaimer requirements for electioneer-\ning communications. Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 369. This was\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                67\n\ndicta. The Court had already concluded that Hillary and the\nads promoting it were the equivalent of express advocacy. Still,\nthe Supreme Court’s dicta must be respected, see United States\nv. Skoien, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"150483\"><a href=\"/opinion/150483/united-states-v-skoien/\"><span class=\"volume\">614</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">638</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 641 (7th Cir. 2010) (en banc), and on the\nstrength of this part of Citizens United, we said in Madigan that\nthe “distinction between express advocacy and issue discussion\ndoes not apply in the disclosure context,” 697 F.3d at 484.\n    This aspect of Citizens United must be understood in proper\ncontext. The Court’s language relaxing the express-advocacy\nlimitation applies only to the specifics of the disclosure\nrequirement at issue there. The Court was addressing the one-\ntime, event-driven disclosure rule for federal electioneering\ncommunications, see 2 U.S.C. § 434(f), a far more modest\ndisclosure requirement than the comprehensive, continuous\nreporting regime imposed on federal PACs, see id. § 434(a)–(b),\nor even the less burdensome disclosure rule for independent\nexpenditures, see id. § 434(c). When the Court said that\n“disclosure is a less restrictive alternative to more comprehen-\nsive regulations of speech,” Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 369, it\nwas talking about the disclosure requirement for electioneering\ncommunications. In that specific context, the Court declined to\napply the express-advocacy limiting principle. But nothing in\nCitizens United suggests that the Court was tossing out the\nexpress-advocacy limitation for all disclosure systems, no\nmatter how burdensome. To the contrary, the Court spent\nseveral pages explaining that a corporation’s option to form an\naffiliated PAC is too burdensome to justify banning the\ncorporation itself from speaking. Id. at 337–39.\n\f68                              Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\n    Lifting the express-advocacy limitation more broadly\nwould have been a major departure from Buckley and is not\nlikely to have been left implicit. Citizens United approved\nevent-driven disclosure for federal electioneering communi-\ncations—large broadcast ad buys close to an election. In that\nspecific and narrow context, the Court declined to enforce\nBuckley’s express-advocacy limitation, but it went no further\nthan that.\n   So it’s a mistake to read Citizens United as giving the\ngovernment a green light to impose political-committee status\non every person or group that makes a communication about\na political issue that also refers to a candidate. That’s what\nGAB § 1.28(3)(b) does. During the 30/60-day preelection\nperiods, all political speech about issues counts as express\nadvocacy—thus triggering full political-committee status and\nother restrictions—if the speaker names and says pretty much\nanything at all about a candidate for state or local office.\n    This is a serious chill on debate about public issues, which\ndoes not stop during election season. Consider two neighbors\nwho want to print and distribute flyers encouraging support\nfor a municipal or school project in their city. If they do so\nwithin the 30/60-day preelection periods, they can’t mention\nthe positions of any local official running for reelection—say\nthe mayor or members of the city council or the school\nboard—for fear of being deemed a political committee and\nrequired to organize, register, and file regular financial reports.\nStating their views on a policy issue and listing the positions of\nthe candidates—pro or con—might be construed as “support”\nor “condemnation” within the meaning of the rule. Or say a\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                69\n\nlocal nature club wants to distribute a newsletter throughout\nthe community educating the public about the positions of\nlocal officials on budgetary support for the parks; it can’t do so\nduring the preelection period without risking being required\nto register and report as a PAC. A grass-roots Tea Party issue-\nadvocacy group might be considered a regulable state PAC if\nduring the preelection blackout period, it publishes a pamphlet\ncomplaining about high taxes or intrusive regulation and\nlisting the voting records of state legislators on these subjects.\nIndeed, the antifilibuster issue ads at stake in Wisconsin Right\nto Life II would be deemed fully regulable under GAB\n§ 1.28(3)(b) if aired during the 30/60-day preelection periods.\n    Other examples can be imagined, but this gives a general\nsense of the chilling effect of this overbroad rule. At the low\n$300 statutory spending threshold (until recently, a mere $25!)\nordinary citizens and interest groups are forced into the state\nPAC system—with all its restrictions and registration and\nreporting requirements—if their advocacy on public issues in\nthe lead-up to an election also mentions a candidate. Failure to\norganize, register, and report as a PAC, as required by the rule,\ncarries civil and criminal penalties. See WIS. STAT . §§ 11.60,\n11.61.\n   The Board offers no substantive justification for the\nextraordinary reach of this rule. Instead, it relies summarily on\nMcConnell, which rejected a vagueness and overbreadth\nchallenge to similar “support” or “oppose” language in BCRA\nspecifying when a communication by a state or local party\ncommittee counts as “[f]ederal election activity” and becomes\nsubject to BCRA’s source and amount limitations on contribu-\n\f70                              Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\ntions to political parties. See McConnell, 540 U.S. at 170 n.64; see\nalso Madigan, 697 F.3d at 486. In this part of McConnell, the\nCourt held that the phrases “promotes or supports a candidate\nfor [federal] office” and “attacks or opposes a candidate for\n[federal] office” are clear enough for a state party committee to\nknow when it has crossed into federal regulatory territory.\n    The context here is very different. The First Amendment\nvagueness and overbreadth calculus must be calibrated to the\nkind and degree of the burdens imposed on those who must\ncomply with the regulatory scheme. The greater the burden on\nthe regulated class, the more acute the need for clarity and\nprecision. Political-party committees can afford campaign-\nfinance lawyers to advise them about compliance with the\nrules and restrictions on hard and soft money, which was the\nrelevant context of this part of McConnell. In significant\ncontrast, under GAB § 1.28, ordinary citizens, grass-roots issue-\nadvocacy groups, and § 501(c)(4) social-welfare organizations\nare exposed to civil and criminal penalties for failing to register\nand report as a PAC if they spend more than $300 to communi-\ncate their views about any political issue close to an election\nand include the name or likeness of a candidate in a way that\ncould be construed by state regulators as a reference to the\ncandidate’s qualifications or as “support” or “condemnation”\nof the candidate’s record or positions. Nothing in McConnell\nauthorizes this.\n    The Board also relies on a passage in Madigan approving\nlanguage in the Illinois campaign-finance code that keys that\nstate’s regulation of ballot-initiative activity to the making of\ncontributions or expenditures for the purpose of “advocating\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                 71\n\nthe defeat or passage of” an initiative. 697 F.3d at 485. This is\nthe language of express advocacy and does not implicate\nBuckley vagueness and overbreadth concerns. This part of\nMadigan does not help the Board here.\n    Accordingly, the second sentence of GAB § 1.28(3)(b) is\nunconstitutional and must be enjoined. What’s left of subsec-\ntion (3)(b) basically tracks the boundaries for express advocacy\nand its functional equivalent established in Buckley, McConnell,\nand Wisconsin Right to Life II. For the most part (we’ll discuss\nthe qualifier in a moment), the remaining text of\nsubsection (3)(b) survives review under current doctrine. The\ntext essentially clarifies that a communication is made for a\n“political purpose” only if it contains either Buckley’s “magic\nwords” or their “functional equivalents with reference to a\nclearly identified candidate and unambiguously relates to the\ncampaign of that candidate” or, alternatively, is “susceptible of\nno reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for\nor against a specific candidate.” GAB § 1.28(3)(a)–(b). As long\nas this definition is applied in a manner consistent with the\nlead opinion in Wisconsin Right to Life II, it withstands scrutiny,\nat least as the Supreme Court’s caselaw stands right now.\nInjunctive relief against this part of the rule was properly\ndenied.\n    This brings us to GAB § 1.91, which raises a related but\nslightly different concern. The Board adopted this rule in the\nimmediate aftermath of Citizens United to bring all independent\ngroups—including newly liberated independent advocacy\ngroups that operate in the corporate form—under the umbrella\nof the regulatory scheme. Wisconsin Right to Life argues that\n\f72                                    Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\n§ 1.91 is unconstitutional to the extent that it imposes PAC-like\nburdens on independent groups not under the control of a\ncandidate or candidate’s committee and not engaged in\nexpress advocacy as their major purpose.22 Once again, this\nargument draws on a limiting principle announced in Buckley.\n    To avoid overbreadth concerns in this sensitive area,\nBuckley held that independent groups not engaged in express\nelection advocacy as their major purpose cannot be subjected\nto the complex and extensive regulatory requirements that\naccompany the PAC designation. 424 U.S. at 79 (“To fulfill the\npurposes of the [FECA,] [political-committee requirements]\nneed only encompass organizations that are under the control\nof a candidate or the major purpose of which is the nomination\nor election of a candidate.”). The Court has repeatedly\n\n\n22\n  The district court did not address § 1.91 on the merits, concluding instead\nthat the challenge was moot because the emergency rule expired while the\ncase was on hold awaiting a decision from the state supreme court. The\nemergency rule was replaced by a permanent rule that is identical in all\nm aterial respects. Still, regarding this claim, the Board has staked its\nappellate fortunes entirely on mootness.\n\n     The Board explains that the permanent rule was renumbered to correct\nan alphabetizing error and insists that this technical change required\nWisconsin Right to Life to amend its complaint if it wanted to keep this\nclaim alive. Not so. The expiration of a temporary rule “will not moot an\nattack … if there is a reasonably concrete basis to anticipate that the expired\nrule will be reenacted in a form that will raise the same questions.”\n13C C H A RLES A LA N W RIGH T , A RTH U R R.

Citizens United,\n558 U.S. at 366–69. Even so, the Court has never endorsed\nimposing full, formal PAC-like burdens on these speakers.\n    Madigan explained that the “‘major purpose’ limitation, like\nthe express-advocacy/issue-discussion distinction, was a\ncreature of statutory interpretation, not constitutional\ncommand.” 697 F.3d at 487. The Board takes this statement to\nmean that the so-called “major purpose test” in campaign-\nfinance law no longer exists. That’s incorrect. The major-\npurpose limitation announced in Buckley has not receded from\nthe scene. It continues in force and effect as an important check\nagainst regulatory overreach and becomes more significant as\nthe scope and burdens of the regulatory system increase.\n   Madigan declined to apply the major-purpose limitation to\nthe Illinois disclosure system because state law defined\n“political committee more narrowly than FECA by covering\nonly groups that accept contributions or make expenditures\n‘on behalf of or in opposition to’ a candidate or ballot\n\f74                                   Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\ninitiative.” Id. at 488. “This definition,” we said, “is more\ntargeted to campaign-related speech than FECA’s definition of\ncontribution and expenditure, which applies to anything of\nvalue given or received ‘for the purpose of … influencing’ an\nelection.” Id. (citing 2 U.S.C. § 431(8)–(9)).23\n    In contrast, Wisconsin law suffers from the same kind of\noverbreadth as the federal statute at the time of Buckley, so the\nmajor-purpose limitation has the same significance here as it\ndid there. Under GAB § 1.91, any organization that makes\n“independent disbursements” is required to comply with\nalmost all of the statutory obligations imposed on political\ncommittees. It must: (1) organize and register like a political\ncommittee (this requires, among other things, a segregated\ndepository account and a treasurer who is subject to personal\nliability for regulatory violations); (2) pay the annual fee as\nrequired by section 11.055; (3) file the oath for independent\ndisbursements under section 11.06(7) and update it as neces-\nsary; (4) comply with the attribution requirements of section\n11.30(1) and (2); and (5) file detailed, year-round financial\nreports as required by Chapter 11 and include “all contribu-\ntions received for independent disbursements, … and inde-\npendent disbursements made.” GAB § 1.91(3)–(8).

See Citizens United,\n558 U.S. at 337–38; Mass. Citizens for Life, 479 U.S. at 254–55.\nForced to disclose donors and faced with the complex and\nformalized requirements of a PAC-like registration and\nreporting system, some groups might conclude that their\n“contemplated political activity [is] simply not worth it” and\nopt not to speak at all. Mass. Citizens for Life, 479 U.S. at 255.\n    So the Board must justify this rule under “exacting\nscrutiny,” which requires a “substantial” relationship between\nthe disclosure requirements and an important governmental\ninterest. See Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 366–67. This is not a\nloose form of judicial review:\n       In the First Amendment context, fit matters.\n       Even when the Court is not applying strict\n       scrutiny, we still require “a fit that is not neces-\n       sarily perfect, but reasonable; that represents not\n       necessarily the single best disposition but one\n       whose scope is ‘in proportion to the interest\n       served,’ … that employs not necessarily the least\n       restrictive means but … a means narrowly\n       tailored to achieve the desired objective.” Board\n       of Trustees of State Univ. of N.Y. v.

Ct. at 1456–57. In other words, we look for\n“a ‘relevant correlation’ or ‘substantial relation’” between the\nstated governmental objective and the means selected to\nachieve it. Davis, 554 U.S. at 744 (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at\n64). Moreover, “the strength of the governmental interest must\nreflect the seriousness of the actual burden on First Amend-\nment rights.” Id. “[I]f a law that restricts political speech does\nnot ‘avoid unnecessary abridgement’ of First Amendment\nrights, … it cannot survive [this] ‘rigorous’ review.”\nMcCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1446 (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 25).\n    It’s well accepted that disclosure requirements in the\ncampaign-finance context serve important governmental\ninterests by providing the public with information about “who\nis speaking about a candidate shortly before an election” and\nthe sources of funding for campaign-related ads. Citizens\nUnited, 558 U.S. at 369. Here, however, we “find a substantial\nmismatch” between that informational objective and the means\nthe Board has chosen to achieve it. McCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at\n1446. Under GAB § 1.91, every independent group that crosses\nthe very low $300 threshold in express-advocacy spending\nmust formally organize, register, and report like a political\ncommittee.\n    Why impose full-blown PAC duties so indiscriminately?\nThe Board does not explain. For groups that engage in express\nelection advocacy as their major purpose, the PAC regulatory\nsystem—with its organizational prerequisites, registration\nduties, and comprehensive, continuous financial reporting—is\n\f78                            Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\na relevantly correlated and reasonably tailored means of\nachieving the public’s informational interest. But the same\ncannot be said for imposing the same pervasive regulatory\nregime on issue-advocacy groups that only occasionally\nengage in express advocacy.\n     A simpler, less burdensome disclosure rule for occasional\nexpress-advocacy spending by “nonmajor-purpose groups”\nwould be constitutionally permissible under Citizens United,\nwhich approved BCRA’s one-time, event-driven disclosure\nrequirement for federal electioneering communications—again,\nbroadcast ads in excess of $10,000 aired close to an election.\n558 U.S. at 366–69. That’s a far cry from imposing full PAC-like\nburdens on all issue-advocacy groups once a modest annual\nspending threshold is crossed. In effect GAB § 1.91 requires\nevery issue-advocacy group to form a PAC before spending as\nlittle as $300.01 on express advocacy, whether at election time\nor any other time of year. Failure to do so brings civil and\ncriminal penalties.\n    We appreciate that the Board is hamstrung by the legisla-\nture’s failure to update Chapter 11 to account for the effect of\nCitizens United. Federal law establishes separate disclosure\ntracks for political committees, see 2 U.S.C.\n§ 434(a)–(b); independent expenditures, see id. § 434(c); and\nelectioneering communications, see id. § 434(f). Full political-\ncommittee requirements apply only to “major purpose” groups\nwithin the meaning of the Buckley limitation. See Political\nCommittee Status, 72 Fed. Reg. 5595, 5596–97 (Feb. 7, 2007).\nChapter 11, in contrast, does not distinguish among\nindependent groups; neither does GAB § 1.91. All individuals\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                            79\n\nand groups that raise and spend money independently of\ncandidates must register and report like a PAC once the\nmodest threshold in contributions or expenditures is crossed.\nBefore Citizens United, this feature in Wisconsin’s state\ncampaign-finance system was largely obscured because most\nindependent organizations operate in the corporate form and\nas such were completely banned from speaking. If they wanted\nto engage in occasional express advocacy, they had to form a\nPAC to do it. After Citizens United, the absence of a major-\npurpose limiting principle now comes to the fore.\n   With the legislature silent, the Board cobbled together a\nregulatory response, imposing most of Chapter 11’s political-\ncommittee requirements on all independent organizations\nwithout any scope limitation—that is, without distinguishing\nbetween groups that are organized with express election\nadvocacy as their major purpose and those that are not.\nGroups in the latter category thus face the same dilemma as\nthey did before Citizens United: They must form a PAC to\nengage in occasional express advocacy.\n    As applied to these groups—the “nonmajor-purpose”\ngroups—the Board makes no effort to explain how GAB § 1.91\nsatisfies the close tailoring required to sustain a disclosure\nregime under exacting scrutiny. Instead, it summarily invokes\nCitizens United and Madigan, which upheld disclosure require-\nments imposed on independent groups. As we have explained,\nGAB § 1.91 imposes far greater burdens on independent\nspeakers by simply importing the political-committee require-\nments of Chapter 11, which in critical respects are unchanged\nfrom Buckley’s day.\n\f80                             Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\n    Wisconsin’s foundational campaign-finance law is in\nserious need of legislative attention to account for develop-\nments in the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence protecting\npolitical speech. The GAB has the authority to interpret and\nimplement the statutory scheme, but it cannot contradict\nChapter 11. See WIS. STAT . § 5.05(1)(f); see also Wis. Citizens\nConcerned for Cranes & Doves v.

The basic design and primary\nrequirements of the disclosure system are matters for the state\nlegislature.\n    As it stands, GAB § 1.91 is a reasonably tailored disclosure\nrule for independent organizations engaged in express election\nadvocacy as their major purpose, but the same is not true for\nissue-advocacy groups that only occasionally engage in express\nadvocacy. The public’s informational interest is strong, but\nrequiring all issue-advocacy groups to comply with\nChapter 11’s burdensome PAC requirements is not a closely\ntailored means of achieving it. Accordingly, GAB § 1.91 is\nunconstitutional as applied to independent organizations\nwhose major purpose is not express advocacy. In other\nrespects, the rule survives First Amendment scrutiny.\n\n\n     2. Sections 11.12(5)–(6), Reporting of Late Contributions\n     and Expenditures\n    Wisconsin Right to Life also challenges sections 11.12(5)–(6),\nwhich impose a special reporting requirement for contributions\nof $500 or more and expenditures of $20 or more received or\nmade within 15 days of an election. Until recently, these late\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                                81\n\ncontributions and expenditures were subject to a 24-hour\nreporting rule if not already included in a preprimary or\npreelection report. Wisconsin Right to Life maintains that\n24 hours is too short but suggested at oral argument that a\n48-hour requirement would likely satisfy close tailoring. The\nrecent legislation increased the reporting time to 48 hours. See\n2013 Wis. Act 153 §§ 13–14.\n    This amendment moots the challenge to the 24-hour rule.\nSee MacDonald v.

Section 11.06(7), GAB § 1.42, the Oath for Independent\n   Expenditures\n    Finally, Wisconsin Right to Life challenges section 11.06(7),\nwhich imposes an oath requirement on individuals and\nindependent committees before they spend money to support\nor oppose a candidate for state or local office. These independ-\nent speakers must affirm that their spending is not coordinated\nwith the candidate or candidate’s agent. A related administra-\ntive rule, GAB § 1.42(1), repeats the statutory requirement and\n\f82                                   Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\nstates that any expenditure made or obligation incurred “in\nsupport of or opposition to a specific candidate” must be made\nor incurred “by or through an individual or committee” that\nhas filed the oath required by section 11.06(7).\n    The challenge to the oath requirement is not well-\ndeveloped. Wisconsin Right to Life argues in very general\nterms that (1) the requirement is too burdensome because\npolitical interests are unpredictable and change rapidly in\nresponse to events unfolding in real time during an election;\nand (2) the rule is especially burdensome for small committees\nlike the Wisconsin Right to Life PAC. The Board counters that\nthe oath is a simple, one-page form with an attachment that\nlists the candidates to which it applies. This strikes us as a\nminimally burdensome regulatory requirement, and it’s\nreasonably tailored to the public’s informational interest in\nknowing the sources of independent election-related spending.\nThe district court properly declined to enjoin section 11.06(7)\nand GAB § 1.42(1).26\n\n\n\n\n26\n  Several other features of the rule raise potentially troubling questions. For\nexample, the rule creates certain presumptions that could be traps for\nunwary independent groups and candidates alike if not interpreted in\naccordance with the limits established in Buckley and Wisconsin Right to\nLife II, as explained above. See GAB § 1.42(1) (treating expenditures not\npreceded by a proper oath as contributions); id. § 1.42(6) (presumption of\ncoordination). These provisions are not challenged here.\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                              83\n\n                       III. Conclusion\n   To sum up, we conclude as follows:\n    Corporate-speech ban. Section 11.38(1)(a)1, the ban on\npolitical spending by corporations, is unconstitutional under\nCitizens United.\n   Cap on corporate fundraising for an affiliated PAC.\nSection 11.38(1)(a)3, the cap on the amount a corporation may\nspend on fundraising for an affiliated political committee, is\nunconstitutional under Citizens United and Barland I.\n   Regulatory disclaimer. The lengthy disclaimer requirement\nin GAB § 1.42(5) is unconstitutional as applied to 30-second\nradio ads and ads of shorter duration.\n    Definitions of “political purposes” and “political commit-\ntee.” The statutory definition of “political purposes,”\nsection 11.01(16), and the regulatory definition of “political\ncommittee,” GAB § 1.28(1)(a), are unconstitutionally vague and\noverbroad in the sense meant by Buckley and require a\nnarrowing construction. As applied to political speakers other\nthan candidates, their campaign committees, and political\nparties, the definitions are limited to express advocacy and its\nfunctional equivalent as those terms were explained in Buckley\nand Wisconsin Right to Life II.\n    PAC Status and PAC-Like Burdens on Issue-Advocacy\nGroups. The second sentence of GAB § 1.28(3)(b), which treats\nissue advocacy during the 30/60-day preelection period as fully\nregulable express advocacy if it mentions a candidate, is\nunconstitutional. Similarly, GAB § 1.91, which imposes PAC-\nlike registration, reporting, and other requirements on all\n\f84                          Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\norganizations that make independent disbursements, is\nunconstitutional as applied to organizations not engaged in\nexpress advocacy as their major purpose.\n  The other challenged statutes and rules survive First\nAmendment scrutiny.\n    On remand the district court shall issue a permanent\ninjunction consistent with this opinion and the specificity\nrequirements of Rule 65(d).\n                VACATED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.\n\fNos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158                               85\n\n                         APPENDIX\nGAB 1.91 Organizations making independent\ndisbursements.\n(1) In this section:\n   (a) “Contribution” has the meaning given in s. 11.01 (6),\n       Stats.\n   (b) “Designated depository account” means a depository\n       account specifically established by an organization to\n       receive contributions and from which to make inde-\n       pendent disbursements.\n   (c) “Disbursement” has the meaning given in s. 11.01 (7),\n       Stats.\n   (d) “Filing officer” has the meaning given in s. 11.01 (8),\n       Stats.\n   (e) “Incurred obligation” has the meaning given in\n      s. 11.01 (11), Stats.\n   (f) “Independent” means the absence of acting in coopera-\n       tion or consultation with any candidate or authorized\n       committee of a candidate who is supported or opposed,\n       and is not made in concert with, or at the request or\n       suggestion of, any candidate or any agent or authorized\n       committee of a candidate who is supported or opposed.\n   (g) “Organization” means any person other than an indi-\n       vidual, committee, or political group subject to registra-\n       tion under s. 11.23, Stats.\n\f86                             Nos. 12-2915, 12-3046 & 12-3158\n\n     (h) “Person” includes the meaning given in s. 990.01 (26),\n         Stats.\n(2) A corporation, or association organized under ch. 185 or\n    193, Stats., is a person and qualifies as an organization that\n    is not prohibited by s. 11.38 (1) (a) 1., Stats., from making\n    independent disbursements until such time as a court\n    having jurisdiction in the State of Wisconsin rules that a\n    corporation, or association organized under ch. 185 or 193,\n    Stats., may constitutionally be restricted from making an\n    independent disbursement.\n(3) Upon accepting contributions made for, incurring obliga-\n    tions for, or making an independent disbursement exceed-\n    ing $25 in aggregate during a calendar year, an organiza-\n    tion shall establish a designated depository account in the\n    name of the organization.
