RYAN\n\n                           SUMMARY*\n\n\n                Habeas Corpus/Death Penalty\n\n    The panel affirmed the district court’s denial of a 28\nU.S.C. § 2254 habeas corpus petition challenging a capital\nsentence for felony murder, dangerous kidnapping and\ndangerous armed robbery in connection with a car-jacking.\nThe panel held that counsel did not provide ineffective\nassistance during sentencing, despite petitioner Miles’s\nclaims that counsel should have focused on drug addiction as\na mitigating factor, inadequately prepared the defense expert\npsychologist regarding Miles’s drug use and mental state, and\ninadequately investigated Miles’s social history. The panel\nconcluded that counsel adopted a permissible sentencing\nstrategy supported by mitigation witnesses, and that\nportraying Miles as a crazed drug addict with a sordid past\nwould have contradicted that chosen strategy. The panel\nfurther concluded that, assuming that Martinez v. Ryan, 132\nS. Ct. 1309 (2012), applied to a petitioner who had counsel in\nhis post-conviction relief proceeding and raised a trial\nineffective assistance claim at that time, Miles would not be\nentitled to a remand for consideration of the above claims in\nlight of new evidence, unless he could establish ineffective\nassistance of post-conviction counsel and that the trial\nineffective assistance claim is a substantial one. The panel\nexplained that the claim was not substantial merely because\ncurrent counsel has now uncovered new mitigating\ninformation beyond that presented to the state court by post-\nconviction relief counsel.\n\n  *\n    This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court. It has\nbeen prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader.\n\f                       MILES V . RYAN                        3\n\n    Judge Berzon concurred in part and dissented in part. She\nagreed that Miles had not shown entitlement to relief based\non counsel’s alleged deficiencies in presenting addiction as a\nmitigating factor and in preparing the expert to testify. She\ndid not agree with the conclusion that Miles is not entitled to\nrelief based on counsel’s deficient investigation of his\ntroubled background. Because that decision was contrary to\nclearly established Federal law, she would review de novo\nand conclude that Miles’s counsel was constitutionally\ndeficient and that Miles was prejudiced as a result.\n\n\n                         COUNSEL\n\nSean Bruner, Law Office of Sean Bruner, Ltd., Tucson,\nArizona; and Timothy M. Gabrielsen, Assistant Federal\nPublic Defender, Tucson, Arizona, for Petitioner-Appellant.\n\nJonathan Bass, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal\nAppeals/Capital Litigation Section, Tucson, Arizona, for\nRespondent-Appellee.\n\n\n                          ORDER\n\n   The opinion filed on August 27, 2012, slip op. 9797, and\nappearing at 691 F.3d 1127, is amended as follows:\n\n   On slip opinion page 9827, replace lines 6 through 15\nwith the following:\n\n       Even though Petitioner has now uncovered,\n       during federal habeas proceedings, some new\n       information that was not presented to the state\n\f4                      MILES V .

Judge Berzon has voted\nto grant the petition for rehearing and petition for rehearing\nen banc.\n\n    The full court was advised of the petition for rehearing en\nbanc. A judge of the court called for a vote on whether to\nrehear the matter en banc. The majority of the nonrecused\nactive judges failed to vote in favor of en banc rehearing.\n\n    Petitioner-Appellant’s petition for rehearing and petition\nfor rehearing en banc are DENIED. No further petitions for\nrehearing or for rehearing en banc shall be entertained.\n\f                           MILES V .

Petitioner challenges only his capital sentence; he\ndoes not challenge his underlying felony murder conviction,\narising from his role in a car-jacking.1 Petitioner argues that\nhis counsel was ineffective at sentencing because she failed\nto focus on Petitioner’s drug addiction (rather than on\nintoxication), enlisted an unqualified expert, and failed to\ninvestigate Petitioner’s social history thoroughly enough.\n\n   We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291 and\n2253, and we affirm.\n\n        FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       A. The Crime\n\n    On an afternoon late in 1992, Petitioner was standing on\na street corner in Tucson, Arizona, with Levi Jackson and\nRay Hernandez. Jackson was carrying a pistol that the three\n\n\n   1\n      Petitioner briefed several additional issues that the district court\ndeclined to certify for appeal. Most of those issues relate to sentencing,\nbut one challenges the conviction. W e have examined all the uncertified\nissues, and none meets the standard for granting a certificate of\nappealability. See Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 336 (2003) (stating\nthat a court should grant a certificate of appealability only when a habeas\npetitioner has demonstrated “that reasonable jurists could debate whether\n(or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in\na different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve\nencouragement to proceed further” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\f6                       MILES V . RYAN\n\nof them had just obtained together; he had told Petitioner and\nHernandez of his plan to commit a car-jacking. Specifically,\naccording to Petitioner’s post-arrest statement to the police,\nJackson had told them that he was “gonna get somebody’s\ncar, take ‘em off in the middle of the desert, and shoot ‘em.”\nAt the time, Jackson and Hernandez were both 16 years old.\nPetitioner was 24 years old.\n\n    When Patricia Baeuerlen drove up and stopped at the\ncorner, Jackson approached her car and asked for “a light.”\nWhen she turned to reach her cigarette lighter, Jackson\npointed the weapon at her and told her to move over. He\nunlocked the car to allow Petitioner and Hernandez to enter\nand sit in the rear. While Jackson drove the car out to the\ndesert, Hernandez held the pistol, but Petitioner also held it at\nsome point. They drove Baeuerlen out of the city, into the\ndesert, and stopped at a dirt road. There, Jackson told\nBaeuerlen to get out of the car and take off her shoes and\njacket. She obeyed. After taunting and harassing Baeuerlen\nfor five to ten minutes, Jackson suddenly shot her in the\nchest. Baeuerlen died as a result of the gunshot. According\nto testimony presented at trial and sentencing, Jackson—not\nPetitioner—shot Baeuerlen as he and Petitioner were walking\naway from Baeuerlen and returning to the car. Throughout\nthe ordeal, starting with the drive to the desert, Baeuerlen was\npleading for her life.\n\n    After the shooting, Jackson, Petitioner, and Hernandez\ndrove away. According to Petitioner’s post-arrest statement,\nhe thought that Baeuerlen was still alive when they left her in\nthe desert. No one sought help for Baeuerlen. Later the same\nday, Petitioner used Baeuerlen’s ATM card, and a PIN that he\nhad found in her belongings, to take money out of her bank\naccount. The next day, Petitioner drove Baeuerlen’s car to\n\f                      MILES V . RYAN                        7\n\nPhoenix, where he went shopping at malls, exchanged\nBaeuerlen’s children’s Christmas presents for other goods,\nand went drinking with old friends. Petitioner told those\nfriends about the murder, insisting that he did not pull the\ntrigger, but smiling and laughing as he related the events.\n\n   B. Arrest and Interrogation\n\n    In the early hours of the following morning, that is, the\nsecond day after the murder, police arrested Petitioner in\nChandler, Arizona, following a high-speed chase in\nBaeuerlen’s car. The police found Baeuerlen’s ATM card,\ncredit card, jewelry, and other personal items in his\npossession. Later that morning, Tucson detectives began a\ntape-recorded interrogation that lasted about five hours.\nDuring the interrogation, Petitioner initially explained his\npossession of the car by telling the detectives two different\nstories, neither of which placed him at the scene of the\nmurder. But, after several hours of interrogation, Petitioner\nadmitted to his involvement in the murder. Specifically, he\nadmitted to knowing of Jackson’s plan to car-jack and shoot\nsomeone, to participating in obtaining the pistol with Jackson\nand Hernandez, to holding the weapon at some point during\nthe drive out to the desert, and to watching Jackson shoot\nBaeuerlen.\n\n   C. Trial and Sentencing\n\n   Soon after Petitioner’s arrest, Barbara Sattler was\nappointed as his counsel and represented him through trial\nand sentencing. After a jury convicted Petitioner of first-\ndegree felony murder, dangerous kidnapping, and dangerous\n\f8                               MILES V . RYAN\n\narmed robbery,2 the trial court reviewed a pre-sentence report\n(“PSR”) and held a sentencing hearing.\n\n    The PSR states that the crime occurred at around 1:30\np.m. and that Petitioner reported having used crack cocaine\n“four or five hours earlier” and not having slept the night\nbefore. The PSR also contains statements from Petitioner that\nhe expected to get money from the car-jacking and that he\nwanted to commit another robbery with the pistol. The PSR\nrepeats Petitioner’s assertions that he did not believe that\nJackson would kill Baeuerlen and that Petitioner thought that\nJackson would have killed him if he had tried to stop the\nmurder.\n\n    The social history section of the PSR contains the\nfollowing information. Petitioner was adopted at the age of\n4 months. His adoptive mother was an alcoholic who\nnevertheless maintained employment, eventually rising past\njobs as a waitress and cook to become a nursing home\nadministrator. Although Petitioner is black, his adoptive\nmother was white, which caused some degree of social\nproblems; those problems grew worse when Petitioner and his\nmother moved to a more affluent neighborhood. Petitioner\nfound a way to fit in by becoming a “class clown” and by\nplaying basketball. Indeed, despite poor grades, he graduated\nfrom high school and won a basketball scholarship to a Bible\ncollege, but he dropped out of college after only a week.\nPetitioner later served in the Navy, where he was disciplined\nfor substance abuse and assault before receiving an other-\n\n\n\n\n    2\n        As noted, none of these convictions is at issue here.\n\f                          MILES V . RYAN                              9\n\nthan-honorable discharge. He also married and had a child,\nthough he later grew apart from his wife and began using\ndrugs. His wife eventually left him, leading him to be evicted\nfrom their apartment. A month later, his mother died, and his\ndrug habit grew worse.\n\n    At the sentencing hearing, Sattler called an expert, Dr.\nMartin Levy, Ph.D., to discuss Petitioner’s drug use. Dr.\nLevy is a clinical psychologist who had evaluated Petitioner\nduring a two-hour session. Dr. Levy testified that Petitioner\nreported using crack cocaine the night before the car-jacking.\nIn particular, Dr. Levy testified that Petitioner’s “mental state\nwas compromised by intoxication . . . with cocaine.”\n(Emphasis added.) Dr. Levy also testified that Petitioner’s\ndescription of his mental state during the crime suggested a\nstate of “disassociat[ion],”3 which was consistent with\nPetitioner’s reported drug use.\n\n    The prosecutor objected to Dr. Levy’s testimony on the\nground that it lacked foundation. The sentencing judge\nagreed and determined that, because Dr. Levy had insufficient\nknowledge of when and in what quantities Petitioner used\ndrugs, he could not testify with specificity as to Petitioner’s\nlevel of impairment or judgment at the time of the crime.\nNevertheless, in Sattler’s closing argument, she reiterated her\nposition that Petitioner was “under the influence of drugs and\nalcohol that day.”\n\n\n  3\n    Dr. Levy’s testimony and reports use the terms “disassociation” and\n“dissociation” interchangeably. “Dissociation” is a “[s]eparation of\npsychologic experiences and events that are normally related, leading to\na distortion of experience and of the meaning of personal and\ninterpersonal events.” Robert J. Campbell, M.D., Campbell’s Psychiatric\nDictionary 289 (9th ed. 2009).\n\f10                          MILES V . RYAN\n\n     Sattler focused only briefly on Petitioner’s social history\nat sentencing. Two character witnesses testified about his\nbackground and his nonviolent nature.4 Indeed, Sattler’s\nclosing arguments characterize him as a relatively normal\nperson—one who graduated from high school, who usually\nmaintained gainful employment, who served in the military\nand completed most of his term of service, who married, and\nwho had a child—but who made some mistakes after his wife\nleft and his mother died.\n\n    Ultimately, the trial judge sentenced Petitioner to death by\nlethal injection.5 In so doing, the trial judge cited three\naggravating factors:6 (1) that Petitioner had previous\nconvictions for three separate crimes of violence (armed\nrobberies), (2) that Petitioner committed the car-jacking in\npursuit of pecuniary gain, and (3) that the murder was\n\n\n\n\n 4\n   In addition, Sattler planned to call Petitioner’s estranged wife to testify\nbut did not do so because Petitioner had objected. Similarly, she planned\nto call two other character and background witnesses, but they were\nunavailable because of a medical emergency. At sentencing, Sattler made\na statement on the record to document those circumstances.\n\n 5\n    The conviction, sentencing, and appeal to the Arizona Supreme Court\nall took place before the Supreme Court decided Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S.\n584 (2002), which requires a jury to determine all facts relating to\neligibility for capital punishment. Ring “does not apply retroactively to\ncases already final on direct review.” Schriro v. Summerlin, 542 U.S. 348,\n358 (2004).\n\n     6\n   The trial judge relied on an additional aggravating factor— that the\nmurder was committed in an especially heinous manner— but the Arizona\nSupreme Court reversed on that point. See State v. Miles, 918 P.2d 1028,\n1035–36 (Ariz. 1996).\n\f                           MILES V . RYAN                              11\n\ncommitted in an especially cruel manner.7 The trial court also\nnoted that the murder was senseless, in that it was\nunnecessary to the escape of Petitioner and his accomplices.\n\n     In mitigation, the trial judge rejected most of the potential\nmitigating factors. He rejected the contention that Petitioner\nwas only a minor participant in the crime. The trial judge\nalso rejected unforeseeability8 of the murder and Petitioner’s\nage as mitigating factors. As to expressions of remorse, the\ntrial judge found them insincere and, in any event,\noutweighed by the aggravating factors listed above:\n\n         The court finds that the defendant’s\n         expression of remorse was insufficient to\n         outweigh the aggravating circumstances of\n         this case. No remorse was evidenced when\n         the defendant went to Phoenix, after the\n         murder, in the car of Miss Baeuerlen, to party\n         with his friends. No remorse was evidenced\n         when the defendant was captured by the\n         Phoenix Police. No remorse was evidenced\n         when the defendant, a day after the murder,\n         was able [to] laugh when detailing the murder\n         . . . to a boyhood friend in Phoenix.\n\n\n\n  7\n    To support the cruelty finding, the trial judge found that Baeuerlen\n“suffered prolonged mental anguish and uncertainty as to her fate,” as\ndemonstrated by Petitioner’s own account of her “crying, screaming in\nterror, and begging for her life.”\n\n  8\n    The trial judge went on to note that Petitioner could not have been\nsurprised by the killing in view of his accomplice’s statement, before the\ncrime, that he was “gonna get somebody’s car, take ‘em off in the middle\nof the desert, and shoot ‘em.”\n\f12                     MILES V . RYAN\n\n    The trial judge rejected the possibility of rehabilitation,\nfinding no evidence to support it. He went on to note that,\neven if he were to find a possibility of rehabilitation, that\nwould not outweigh the aggravating factors. The trial judge\nalso found that Petitioner’s cooperation with the police was\npurely self-interested and not sufficient “to establish a\nmitigating circumstance or to outweigh the aggravating\ncircumstances.”\n\n    The trial judge did consider mitigation arising from the\nnature of the murder conviction—felony murder, rather than\npre-meditated murder—but found it insufficient to outweigh\nthe aggravating factors. The trial judge also considered\nPetitioner’s reputation for nonviolence but did not find it\nsufficient to outweigh the aggravating factors, especially in\nview of Petitioner’s recent commission of three armed\nrobberies.\n\n   Finally, of particular significance to this appeal, the trial\njudge rejected any drug-related mitigation, stating:\n\n       The court finds that there is no credible\n       evidence that the defendant’s capacity was\n       impaired or that drugs or alcohol had impaired\n       the defendant’s thinking or actions at the time\n       of the crimes in question. . . . The testimony\n       offered by the defendant, from Doctor Levy,\n       Ph.D., as to impairment, was without adequate\n       foundation, and considered by the court to be\n       without value.\n\f                       MILES V . RYAN                        13\n\n   D. Post-Conviction Relief Proceedings\n\n    On direct appeal, the Arizona Supreme Court affirmed the\nconviction and capital sentence. State v. Miles, 918 P.2d\n1028 (Ariz. 1996). Petitioner did not petition for certiorari to\nthe United States Supreme Court, but he did file a state court\npetition for post-conviction relief (“PCR”) under Rule 32 of\nthe Arizona Rules of Criminal Procedure. The Arizona\nSuperior Court denied Petitioner’s PCR petition, rejecting his\nineffective assistance of counsel claims on the merits. With\nrespect to Sattler’s failure to focus on addiction, the state\ncourt concluded both that Sattler’s performance was not\ndeficient and that Petitioner failed to demonstrate prejudice.\nWith respect to the other two claims in this case, the state\ncourt concluded only that Sattler’s performance was not\ndeficient—it made no determination as to prejudice. The\nArizona Supreme Court denied the petition for review of the\nPCR decision.\n\n    Before denying Petitioner’s PCR petition, the Arizona\nSuperior Court, however, ordered an evidentiary hearing. In\npreparation for that hearing, Petitioner underwent more\nextensive psychological testing. Dr. Joseph Geffen, Ph.D., a\nclinical psychologist, prepared a report describing Petitioner\nas using drugs to “self-medicat[e]” and as having resorted to\ncrime because of “his perceived need for drugs without which\nhe cannot cope.” Dr. Levy had described Petitioner’s drug\nuse similarly, as self-medication, in his pre-sentence\nevaluation, but did not connect Petitioner’s motivation for his\ncrimes to a need to acquire drugs.\n\n    In preparation for the state hearing, Petitioner’s counsel\nhired an investigator to probe further into his social history.\nThe investigator produced a detailed report, containing\n\f14                         MILES V . RYAN\n\ninformation gleaned from interviews with many people who\nknew Petitioner and his mother during his youth. The\nadditional history confirms that Petitioner’s mother was an\nalcoholic and suggests that she may also have used heroin, or\nat least socialized with those who did. The investigation\nrevealed that his mother worked as a prostitute and perhaps\nran her own whorehouse out of her home. When Petitioner\nwas approximately 11 years old, his mother began work at a\nnursing home (and may have given up prostitution); there, she\nrose to become an administrator, a position she held until\nPetitioner’s last year of high school, when she was fired for\ndrinking on the job. Additionally, the report characterized\nPetitioner’s hometown of Winslow, Arizona, as being\nsegregated, corrupt, and rife with prostitution, crime, drugs,\nand gambling. The investigation confirmed that Petitioner\nand his mother suffered at least some alienation due to their\nmixed-race household.\n\n    The additional social history also suggests that\nPetitioner’s mother was an “extremely protective mother”\nwho made him the center of her life. She was “infatuated”\nwith her son and “coddle[d]” him. She slept in the same bed\nas Petitioner until he was 14 years old. She “read to him\nconstantly and sang to him when she fed him,” past an age\nconsidered “normal” by a friend. The additional social\nhistory reveals that, although Petitioner’s mother disciplined\nhim by spanking him with a hairbrush when he was 4 or 5\nyears old, she later discontinued the practice and did not\nphysically abuse him.9 She bought Petitioner “everything he\n\n\n  9\n     Petitioner now disputes this finding and recently filed an affidavit\nstating that his mother routinely physically abused him when he was\nbetween the ages of 4 and 14 years old by beating him with “belts,\nextension cords, paddles, switches, and her fists.” Because this evidence\n\f                           MILES V . RYAN                              15\n\nwanted” and, when he developed buck teeth, for which other\nchildren teased him, she arranged for him to get braces.\n\n    The additional social history report went on to discuss\nPetitioner’s relationships with his community. He went to\nchurch twice a week for Bible study until at least his junior\nhigh school years, receiving a ride from a local bus ministry.\nWhen he was in junior high school, his basketball coach\nfrequently drove him home from practices. He became good\nfriends with a local family, spending a great deal of time at\ntheir home; indeed, they treated him like their own child.\nNotably, he remained in contact with members of that family\nwell into adulthood—two of them were character witnesses\nat his sentencing hearing. According to those two witnesses,\nPetitioner stayed in touch with them after leaving Winslow\nand visited them to introduce his wife. One of the witnesses\nwas a close friend when she and Petitioner were both living\nin Tucson; she was present for the birth of his daughter.\n\n    The additional social history investigation also looked\ninto Petitioner’s high school years, during which he played on\nthe basketball team and earned a varsity letter in his senior\nyear, helping to win the state championship.

In his report, Dr. Geffen stated that, after learning\nabout “modern methods of evaluating mitigation factors in\ndeath penalty cases,” years after his initial evaluation of\nPetitioner, he thought that he “had not done as complete an\nevaluation as possible.” Dr. Geffen further concluded: (1)\nthat Petitioner was “experiencing an altered state of mind at\nthe time of [Baeuerlen’s] murder;” (2) that, “[a]lthough\nphysically present, [Petitioner] was emotionally and mentally\n‘not there’ in terms of his awareness and appreciation of\nevents around him, due to a dissociative state of mind, during\nwhich the event appeared to him as unreal and disconnected\nfrom him;” (3) that Petitioner’s “substance abuse at the time\nwas part of a lifelong adjustment problem which resulted in\na severe state of depression, and that the drugs served the\npurpose of numbing his perceptions after some catastrophic\nlosses and personal failures, including the loss of his mother\nand of his marriage and family and job, almost\nsimultaneously, rather than being an isolated recreational\nact;” and (4) that Petitioner’s “altered mental state met the\ncriteria for statutory mitigation, since he was not capable of\nconforming to the lawful requirements due to his impaired\nmental state.”\n\n    Around the same time, Petitioner was also examined by\nDr. Wm.

But\nthe district court ultimately determined that an evidentiary\nhearing was “neither warranted nor required because\nPetitioner ha[d] not alleged facts which, if proved, would\nentitle him to relief.” The district court then denied\nPetitioner’s petition, certifying only the issues discussed in\nthis opinion. Petitioner timely appealed, and we have\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2253. After oral\nargument and submission of the case, the Supreme Court\nissued its decision in Martinez v. Ryan, 132 S.

Id. at 688–93.\nWe may address these prongs in whichever order we deem\nmost efficient. Id. at 697.\n\n    The first prong of the Strickland test—deficient\nperformance—requires a showing that counsel’s performance\n“fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,” id. at\n688, or was “outside the wide range of professionally\ncompetent assistance,” id. at 690. The test is “highly\ndeferential,” evaluating the challenged conduct from\ncounsel’s perspective at the time in issue. Id. at 689. This\ninquiry should “begin with the premise that ‘under the\ncircumstances, the challenged action[s] might be considered\nsound trial strategy.’” Cullen v. Pinholster, 131 S.

Id. at\n1407.\n\n    The second prong of the Strickland test—prejudice\n—requires the petitioner to demonstrate a “reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the\nresult of the [trial] would have been different.” 466 U.S. at\n\f20                          MILES V .

Addiction as a Mitigating Factor\n\n    Petitioner first argues that, during sentencing, Sattler\nunreasonably failed to focus on his drug addiction. We\ndisagree. Sattler’s decision to rely on Dr. Levy and to focus\non other mitigating factors, such as depression, rather than on\naddiction, was a matter of strategy.12 Sattler’s arguments at\nsentencing support our conclusion. Her chosen tack—\ncharacterizing Petitioner as a relatively normal person who\nwas suffering from depression—evinces a desire to avoid\npainting Petitioner as a drug addict. At the very least,\nSattler’s argument at sentencing raises the possibility that she\nwas motivated by such a strategy, which is all that Pinholster\nrequires. 131 S. Ct. at 1404–07. Because Sattler’s decision\nnot to focus on drug addiction appears to have been motivated\nby reasonable strategic concerns, that decision is deserving of\ngreat deference under Strickland and Pinholster. See Turner\nv. Calderon, 281 F.3d 851, 876 (9th Cir. 2002) (“The choice\nof what type of expert to use is one of trial strategy and\ndeserves ‘a heavy measure of deference.’” (quoting\nStrickland’s statement regarding deference due to counsel’s\ninvestigative decisions, 466 U.S. at 691)).\n\n    Petitioner also argues that Sattler’s representation was\ndeficient because her sentencing arguments discussed\n\n\n 12\n   Sattler’s deposition supports our conclusion, but after Pinholster, we\nmay not consider that evidence under the AEDPA standard of review.\n131 S. Ct. at 1400 (“[E]vidence introduced in federal court has no bearing\non § 2254(d)(1) review.”). Accordingly, we do not rely on Sattler’s\ndeposition.\n\f22                     MILES V . RYAN\n\nintoxication rather than addiction. Sattler’s decision to avoid\nasserting that Petitioner suffered from an addiction, while\nfocusing instead on lingering intoxication from the use of\ncrack cocaine, could be seen as inconsistent with a strategy of\npainting Petitioner as a normal person; if counsel thought that\ndrug use made Petitioner appear less deserving of sympathy,\none might think that she would have tried to avoid\nmentioning drugs at all. But counsel’s strategy and decision\nare reasonable when viewed from her perspective at the time\nof trial, as Strickland requires us to do. Petitioner discussed\nhis crack cocaine use in his confession, and it was mentioned\nin the PSR, so Sattler had to address it somehow.\n\n     Moreover, Petitioner was sentenced in 1993. As recently\nas 1998, the Arizona Supreme Court was routinely rejecting\naddiction as a mitigating factor unless the defendant could\nshow intoxication at the time of the crime. See, e.g., State v.\nGreene, 967 P.2d 106, 117 (Ariz. 1998) (“To hold that a\nmotivation to kill fueled in part by a desire for drugs is\nmitigating would be anomalous indeed.”); State v. Williams,\n904 P.2d 437, 453 (Ariz. 1995) (“Without a showing of some\nimpairment at the time of the offense, drug use cannot be a\nmitigating circumstance of any kind.” (citing State v. White,\n815 P.2d 869, 882 (Ariz. 1991))); State v. Wood, 881 P.2d\n1158, 1176 (Ariz. 1994) (“We further believe Defendant’s\nimpulsive personality and history of substance abuse merit\nlittle, if any, independent consideration in mitigation. As\nnoted, Defendant was not under the influence of any\nintoxicating substance at the time of the murders.” (emphasis\nadded) (citing State v. Bible, 858 P.2d 1152, 1209 (Ariz.\n1993))). But see State v. Gallegos, 870 P.2d 1097, 1113–15\n(Ariz. 1994) (finding error in trial court’s failure to consider\nhistory of substance abuse as a nonstatutory mitigating\n\f                            MILES V . RYAN                              23\n\nfactor). For that reason, too, counsel would have had to\nemphasize intoxication.\n\n    It was only recently, in 2010, that we disapproved the\nArizona Supreme Court’s treatment of addiction, in a habeas\nreview of Williams, 904 P.2d 437. Williams v. Ryan,\n623 F.3d 1258, 1270 (9th Cir. 2010). Given the state of\nArizona law at the time of trial, Sattler would have been\noperating under the assumption that intoxication was the only\nviable means of explaining Petitioner’s drug use to the\nsentencing judge. And the evidence did not rule out some\nsort of lingering intoxication—Dr. Levy discussed it in his\nreport.13 Seen from this perspective, Sattler’s strategy did not\nfall outside the wide range of professional competence or\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness.14\n\n   Even if Sattler had been deficient in failing to focus on\naddiction, we see no prejudice, the second prong of the\n\n\n  13\n     Dr. Levy’s report discusses Petitioner’s condition at the time of the\ncrime as “coming down” from crack cocaine use the previous night and\nnotes that Petitioner was dissociated from the events. At trial, Dr. Levy\ntestified that this state is common among drug users.\n\n  14\n      To be sure, in Williams, we wrote: “T he decision of the Arizona\nSupreme Court that drug use could not be considered as a mitigating factor\n‘of any kind,’ is contrary to the Supreme Court’s consistent decisions in\ncapital cases beginning more than a decade before Williams’ [1992]\ntrial.” 623 F.3d at 1270 (emphasis added). Nevertheless, as Petitioner’s\nbrief acknowledges, under Arizona law at the time of his trial, addiction\nwas not a recognized form of mitigation. Thus, although she could have\nrelied on existing United States Supreme Court decisions to challenge the\nArizona practice of ignoring the mitigating value of addiction, her strategy\nmerits deference under Strickland.\n\f24                     MILES V . RYAN\n\nStrickland standard. In assessing prejudice, we consider the\nmitigating effect of Petitioner’s drug addiction and how it\nwould have altered the balancing of aggravating and\nmitigating factors discussed at sentencing. See Porter v.\nMcCollum, 130 S. Ct. 447, 453–54 (2009) (per curiam) (“To\nassess th[e] probability [of a different sentence], we consider\nthe totality of the available mitigation evidence—both that\nadduced at trial, and the evidence adduced in the habeas\nproceeding—and reweigh it against the evidence in\naggravation.” (internal quotation marks omitted) (brackets\nomitted)).\n\n    As noted above, Petitioner’s case involved significant\naggravating factors, none of which would be affected by\naddiction. For many of the proposed mitigating factors\n(remorse, rehabilitation, cooperation), the trial judge made\ntwo findings—(1) that the evidence was insufficient to\nestablish the mitigating factor in the first place; and (2) that\neven if the mitigating factor were established, it would be\ninsufficient to outweigh the aggravating factors. It is highly\nunlikely that a finding of addiction as a mitigating factor\nwould have tipped the scales where none of the other\nproposed mitigators did. Indeed, addiction could be\ncharacterized as merely another element of social history,\nwhich the sentencing judge considered and found insufficient\nto outweigh the aggravators. As stated by the district court:\n\n       The sentencing judge considered Petitioner’s\n       life circumstances but found them insufficient\n       to warrant leniency. There is no reasonable\n       probability that focusing on Petitioner’s crack\n       cocaine addiction, as opposed to the reasons\n       that led to the addiction, would have changed\n       the sentencing outcome.\n\f                       MILES V . RYAN                        25\n\n    Under AEDPA, the state court’s decision denying this\nportion of Petitioner’s ineffective assistance claim must\nstand. The state court did not apply Strickland unreasonably.\nSee Harrington v. Richter, 131 S. Ct. 770, 785 (2011) (“A\nstate court must be granted a deference and latitude that are\nnot in operation when the case involves review under the\nStrickland standard itself.”); cf. id. at 789 (“Rare are the\nsituations in which the wide latitude counsel must have in\nmaking tactical decisions will be limited to any one technique\nor approach. It can be assumed that in some cases counsel\nwould be deemed ineffective for failing to consult or rely on\nexperts, but even that formulation is sufficiently general that\nstate courts would have wide latitude in applying it.” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)).\n\n    “Surmounting Strickland’s high bar is never an easy\ntask.” Id. at 788 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because\nSattler’s decision not to focus on addiction as a mitigating\nfactor was strategic and because Petitioner was not prejudiced\nas a result, he fails to meet the Strickland standard here.\n\n   B. Qualifications of Expert\n\n   Petitioner next argues that Sattler’s preparation of Dr.\nLevy was deficient. The sentencing court did not allow Dr.\nLevy to testify as to Petitioner’s drug use because of a lack of\nfoundation—Dr. Levy did not know how often Petitioner had\nbeen using drugs, or in what quantities. He did not even\nknow if, or for how long, Petitioner had slept between the\ntime he ingested drugs and the time he committed the crime.\n\n    Although Sattler’s strategy—to focus on intoxication\nrather than addiction—was reasonable, she may have failed\nto implement it appropriately. But even if that failure\n\f26                        MILES V . RYAN\n\nrepresents performance so deficient as to meet the standards\napplicable when we review a Strickland claim under\nAEDPA—a question we do not decide—Petitioner still fails\nto demonstrate prejudice. On this point, the state court made\nno determination on the merits, so we must review de novo.\nSee Porter, 130 S. Ct. at 452 (“Because the state court did not\ndecide whether Porter’s counsel was deficient, we review this\nelement of Porter’s Strickland claim de novo.”).\nSignificantly, the sentencing judge was aware of Petitioner’s\ndrug use—the PSR, which quoted some of Dr. Levy’s\nopinions, contained information about Petitioner’s “coming\ndown” from crack cocaine used the night before the crime, as\nwell as a diagnosis that Petitioner was in a “disassociated”\nstate. The excluded testimony would have added very little\nmore.\n\n    Furthermore, as the district court noted, even if Dr. Levy\ncould have testified as to the effect of Petitioner’s drug use on\nhis mental state, that testimony would have been of limited\nvalue in view of: (1) Petitioner’s “acknowledgment that he\nwas not under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of\nthe offense”; and (2) Dr. Levy’s other testimony that\n“regardless of his drug abuse Petitioner knew the difference\nbetween right and wrong and was capable of walking away\nfrom the offense, thus negating any finding of significant\nimpairment under A.R.S. § 13-703(G)(1).”15 It is not\nreasonably probable that Dr. Levy’s excluded testimony\nwould have influenced the sentencing judge because, even if\nthe judge had considered Petitioner’s drug use to be a form of\nreduced, nonstatutory intoxication, the mitigating effect of\nthat condition would have been insufficient to outweigh the\n\n 15\n    Section 13-703 (1993) has since been renumbered as Arizona Revised\nStatutes section 13-751 (2011).\n\f                        MILES V . RYAN                          27\n\naggravating factors outlined and discussed above.\nConsequently, Petitioner’s ineffective assistance of counsel\nclaim, regarding the qualifications of Dr. Levy, fails on the\nprejudice prong of Strickland, reviewed de novo.\n\n    C. Investigation of Social History\n\n    Finally, Petitioner argues that Sattler’s performance was\ndeficient because she failed to investigate mitigating\ncircumstances thoroughly enough. Strickland itself involved\na claim of ineffective assistance for failure to investigate\nmitigating circumstances. For that reason, Strickland is an\nespecially good starting point for analyzing Petitioner’s claim\nthat Sattler failed to investigate sufficiently his social history.\nThe Supreme Court outlined the standards governing\ncounsel’s duty to investigate as follows:\n\n        [S]trategic choices made after thorough\n        investigation of law and facts relevant to\n        plausible options are virtually\n        unchallengeable; and strategic choices made\n        after less than complete investigation are\n        reasonable precisely to the extent that\n        reasonable professional judgments support the\n        limitations on investigation. In other words,\n        counsel has a duty to make reasonable\n        investigations or to make a reasonable\n        decision that makes particular investigations\n        unnecessary. In any ineffectiveness case, a\n        particular decision not to investigate must be\n        directly assessed for reasonableness in all the\n        circumstances, applying a heavy measure of\n        deference to counsel’s judgments.\n\f28                     MILES V . RYAN\n\n           . . . And when a defendant has given\n       counsel reason to believe that pursuing certain\n       investigations would be fruitless or even\n       harmful, counsel’s failure to pursue those\n       investigations may not later be challenged as\n       unreasonable.\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 690-91 (emphasis added).\n\n    In Pinholster, the Supreme Court provided more\nguidance, overturning an opinion in which we had drawn,\nfrom other recent Supreme Court cases, a “constitutional duty\nto investigate, and the principle that it is prima facie\nineffective assistance for counsel to abandon their\ninvestigation of the petitioner’s background after having\nacquired only rudimentary knowledge of his history from a\nnarrow set of sources.” 131 S. Ct. at 1406 (citation, internal\nquotation marks, and brackets omitted). In the decision that\nPinholster reversed, we had explained that we “could not\n‘lightly disregard’ a failure to introduce evidence of\n‘excruciating life history’ or ‘nightmarish childhood.’” Id.\n(quoting Pinholster, 590 F.3d at 684).\n\n    In reversing us, the Court in Pinholster explained\nStrickland:\n\n       “No particular set of detailed rules for\n       counsel’s conduct can satisfactorily take\n       account of the variety of circumstances faced\n       by defense counsel or the range of legitimate\n       decisions . . . .” Strickland itself rejected the\n       notion that the same investigation will be\n       required in every case.

Cf. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 672–74 (finding that\ncounsel’s strategy—claiming “no significant history of\ncriminal activity” and arguing that the defendant “should be\nspared death . . . because [he] was fundamentally a good\nperson who had briefly gone badly wrong in extremely\nstressful circumstances” arising from “his inability to support\nhis family”—was professionally reasonable, justifying a\nfailure to investigate and present background information that\nmight undermine those claims).\n\n    Sattler’s failure to investigate more thoroughly is\njustified, then, by the irrelevance of additional social history\nto her chosen strategy.

That\nargument is flawed because it overreads Rompilla v. Beard,\n545 U.S. 374 (2005), and Wiggins v.

Ct. at 1406–07 (“The Court of\nAppeals erred in attributing strict rules to this Court’s recent\ncase law.” (citing Rompilla and Wiggins)). Indeed, the\ndissent here appears to be making the same argument made\nby the dissent in Pinholster, an argument that was necessarily\nrejected by a majority of the Court. See id. at 1427\n(Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (“In reaching this conclusion, the\nmajority commits the same Strickland error that we corrected,\napplying § 2254(d)(1), in Wiggins: It holds a purportedly\n‘tactical judgment’ to be reasonable without assessing ‘the\nadequacy of the investigatio[n] supporting [that]\njudgmen[t].’” (alterations in original) (quoting Wiggins,\n539 U.S. at 521)).\n\n    Further, to the extent that the dissent finds support in\nPorter, 130 S. Ct. 447, that case is distinguishable. Porter\nheld that the defendant “may have been fatalistic or\nuncooperative, but that [did] not obviate the need for defense\ncounsel to conduct some sort of mitigation investigation.”\nPorter, 130 S. Ct. at 453. In Porter, counsel failed to conduct\nany investigation into the defendant’s background—he did\nnot interview any witnesses or request any records. Id. Here,\n\f                          MILES V . RYAN                            31\n\nas the Arizona Superior Court held, Petitioner’s failure to\ndisclose pertinent facts about his background “guaranteed that\n[Sattler] would not and Dr. Levy certainly would not, conduct\nfurther investigation into Petitioner’s background.” Sattler\ndid conduct a mitigation investigation—she engaged an\ninvestigator who interviewed childhood friends of Petitioner,\nattempted to call his wife to testify at the penalty phase (but\nPetitioner refused to allow her to do so), and engaged Dr.\nLevy. Porter, therefore, is inapplicable here.\n\n    But even if Sattler’s performance had been deficient,\nPetitioner suffered no prejudice. As with Petitioner’s claim\nregarding Sattler’s expert, the state court made no prejudice\nfinding on the failure to investigate claim, so we must review\nprejudice de novo. That review is not subject to the\nevidentiary limitations announced in Pinholster, though it is\nsubject to the limitations in § 2254(e)(2). See Pinholster,\n131 S. Ct. at 1401 (“Section 2254(e)(2) continues to have\nforce where § 2254(d)(1) does not bar federal habeas\nrelief. . . . At a minimum, therefore, § 2254(e)(2) still\nrestricts the discretion of federal habeas courts to consider\nnew evidence when deciding claims that were not adjudicated\non the merits in state court.”). But even assuming that\n§ 2254(e)(2) permits us to consider the new evidence that\nPetitioner produced at the district court,16 we see no\nprejudice.\n\n\n\n  16\n     Even under review de novo and § 2254(e)(2), however, we do not\nconsider the new evidence produced on appeal in connection with the\nsupplemental briefing on the Martinez issue discussed below. See United\nStates v. Waters, 627 F.3d 345, 355 n.3 (9th Cir. 2010) (“Facts not\npresented to the district court are not part of the record on appeal.”\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\f32                    MILES V . RYAN\n\n    First, as discussed above, Petitioner received a capital\nsentence primarily on account of three aggravating\nfactors—previous convictions for three armed robberies,\ncommitting the car-jacking in pursuit of pecuniary gain, and\ncommitting the murder in an especially cruel manner—and\nthe sentencing judge observed that the aggravators were\nunlikely to be outweighed by anything less than substantial\nmitigation. Petitioner’s additional social history is, as the\ndistrict court noted, largely cumulative of what was already\nbefore the sentencing judge in the PSR, meaning that its\nmitigating value would be marginal.\n\n    More significantly, the additional social history is\nequivocal, and not as alarming as that of the defendants in\nother failure-to-investigate cases. See, e.g., James v. Ryan,\n679 F.3d 780 (9th Cir. 2012), petition for cert. filed,\n81 U.S.L.W. 3047 (U.S. June 28, 2012) (No. 11A1119).\nPetitioner’s mother was a prostitute during his early years,\nthough she turned to legitimate employment when he was\nabout 11 years old. He may have observed—but did not\nexperience—violence in connection with his mother’s\nprostitution.     But, however problematic were the\ncircumstances of Petitioner’s mother’s lifestyle, she did not\nneglect him, and there was no evidence that he was ever\nabused. To the contrary, Petitioner’s mother was clearly\nquite devoted to him. Moreover, whatever other problems\nexisted in Petitioner’s hometown, he had a community of\nfriends and a support system there, with responsible adults\nwho took an interest in him. He developed healthy\nrelationships that continued into adulthood. Finally, by all\nobjective indications, he was socially well adjusted in high\nschool.\n\f                           MILES V . RYAN                              33\n\n    Petitioner’s background was far more stable than, say, the\nbackground of the defendant in James, in which we granted\nhabeas relief from a capital sentence.17 The defendant in that\ncase, James, grew up in a household with a father who shot\nheroin in front of James and was a violent alcoholic who beat\nJames’ mother. James, 679 F.3d at 811. James grew up on\nwelfare and was both neglected and verbally abused by his\nmother. Id. Later, his mother took up with another violent\nalcoholic, but this one abused James as well as his mother.\nId. Growing up, James was frequently visited by an uncle\nknown to have sexually abused other children in his family.\nId. at 811–12. At one point, James’ mother tried to smother\nhim with a pillow but relented at the last moment. Id. at 812.\nAfter living in various foster homes and an adoption center\nfor six to nine months, James was given up for adoption at\nage 4. Id. He was eventually adopted by an older couple who\nphysically abused him when he misbehaved.18 Id. at 812–13.\n\n    Similarly, the Arizona Supreme Court reversed a death\nsentence in State v. Trostle, 951 P.2d 869 (Ariz. 1997).\nUnlike Petitioner here, Trostle had been neglected as a baby.\n\n  17\n     James is distinguishable on the deficiency-of-performance prong of\nStrickland because, in James, the state did not dispute deficient\nperformance. 679 F.3d at 807. Also, the state court in James had denied\nthe ineffective assistance of counsel claim for procedural reasons, rather\nthan on the merits, meaning that AEDPA deference did not apply. Id. at\n802.\n\n 18\n    The dissent asserts, “[C]ontrary to the majority’s account, James did\nnot ‘grow up’ in the abusive circumstances described. Instead, at age four,\nJames was adopted by parents who were strict but loving, and his life\ncircumstances from thence forward took a dramatic turn for the better.”\nDissent at 49. But James’ adoptive father was so “strict” that, “[o]n one\noccasion, [he] whipped James so severely with a rope that he raised\nbloody welts all over James’s back.” James, 679 F.3d at 813.\n\f34                     MILES V . RYAN\n\nChild Protective Services received numerous reports about\nhim, starting with a report that he was found, at the age of 2\nor 3 months old, sleeping in his own vomit while wearing a\nsoiled diaper. Id. at 884. “His grandmother beat him\nregularly and once severely burned him with hot water for\nwetting his pants. His grandfather was convicted of sexually\nmolesting him over a substantial period of time beginning at\nage 11.” Id. After Trostle began acting out in sexually\ninappropriate ways, juvenile authorities placed him in a\nresidential treatment and educational program when he was\n14 years old. Id.\n\n    The newly uncovered portion of Petitioner’s social history\nsimply does not have significant mitigating value in view of\nwhat was already available to the sentencing judge. Thus,\neven if Sattler had been professionally deficient in failing to\ninvestigate and present these additional facts, it is not\nreasonably probable that the outcome of the\naggravation/mitigation balancing would have been different.\nIndeed, the new evidence does little to dispel Petitioner’s\nlater social history, in which he acted as a functioning\nmember of society for a number of years, demonstrating a\ncapacity to overcome the hardships that had burdened his\nyouth.\n\n    Accordingly, the failure-to-investigate portion of\nPetitioner’s ineffective assistance claims fails on the first\nprong of Strickland, applying AEDPA deference. We note,\nhowever, that Petitioner’s claim would fail on the first prong\neven under de novo review. Further, as discussed above,\neven if Petitioner could prevail on the first prong, thereby\n\f                            MILES V . RYAN                              35\n\nrequiring us to review de novo on the second prong, he would\nfail.19\n\n    D. Effect of Martinez\n\n      Martinez does not help Petitioner. He had the assistance\nof counsel in his post-conviction relief proceeding, and\ncounsel raised a claim of ineffective assistance of trial\ncounsel. Assuming that Martinez applies in that situation, its\nexception is available only if Petitioner can establish that his\npost-conviction counsel was ineffective under the Strickland\nstandard and that the “underlying ineffective-assistance-of-\ntrial-counsel claim is a substantial one, which is to say that\n. . . the claim has some merit.” 132 S. Ct. at 1318.\n\n    Here, it cannot be said that Petitioner’s post-conviction\ncounsel performed his duties so incompetently as to be\noutside the “wide range of professionally competent\nassistance.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690. Even though\nPetitioner has now uncovered, during federal habeas\nproceedings, some new information that was not presented to\n\n   19\n       Petitioner argues that the state court made an error of law in\nsuggesting that it denied this portion of his ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claims because his social history was not “new” evidence.\nBecause Petitioner did not raise this argument in the district court, he may\nnot raise it for the first time on appeal. See Scott v. Ross, 140 F.3d 1275,\n1283 (9th Cir. 1998) (identifying a general rule of waiver for issues not\nraised below, subject to a discretionary exception). Even if we allowed\nPetitioner to raise this argument, he could gain nothing more than review\nde novo under the Strickland standard, which is itself deferential. See\nFrantz, 533 F.3d at 737 (holding that, when “§ 2254(d)(1) is satisfied,\nthen federal habeas courts must review the substantive constitutionality of\nthe state custody de novo”). As noted above, the failure to investigate\nportion of Petitioner’s ineffective assistance of counsel claims would fail\neven under review de novo.\n\f36                      MILES V . RYAN\n\nthe state courts during post-conviction review, that evidence\nis insufficient to demonstrate that his lawyer’s investigation\nduring the state-court proceedings was objectively\nunreasonable. As detailed above, his counsel conducted an\nextensive investigation during post-conviction review,\nobtaining a psychologist to perform further testing and hiring\nan investigator who visited Petitioner’s home town and\ninterviewed many people who knew him and his mother.\nAccordingly, Petitioner cannot demonstrate that his post-\nconviction counsel was ineffective.\n\n    Furthermore, even with new evidence relating to his\nsocial history and drug use, Petitioner cannot rescue the claim\nthat his sentencing counsel was ineffective. As we have\nalready discussed, sentencing counsel made a reasonable\nchoice, as a matter of strategy, not to focus on social history\nand addiction, opting instead to paint Petitioner as a normal\nperson who made a grave mistake during a tumultuous period\nin his life. Petitioner’s new evidence does not establish that\nthis choice was unreasonable.\n\n   In summary, even assuming that the Martinez exception\napplies to Petitioner’s case, he cannot satisfy its requirements.\n\n                       CONCLUSION\n\n    Petitioner’s counsel adopted a permissible sentencing\nstrategy to show: (1) that Petitioner was a nice young man\nwho went with bad companions because he was depressed,\nwho may have been intoxicated at the time of the crime, who\nwas remorseful, and who was worth saving through\nrehabilitation; and (2) that he was just a very minor\nparticipant in the crime who was surprised by the violent turn\nof events. She presented mitigation witnesses to bolster this\n\f                       MILES V . RYAN                       37\n\ntheory. To portray him as a crazed drug addict with a sordid\npast would have contradicted the chosen strategy.\nPetitioner’s arguments amount to little more than a contention\nthat his counsel should have adopted a different strategy.\nUnder Strickland, such arguments must fail, and Martinez\ndoes not compel a different result.\n\n   AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\nBERZON, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in\npart:\n\n    I agree with the majority that Miles has not shown that he\nis entitled to relief under the Antiterrorism and Effective\nDeath Penalty Act of 1996 (“AEDPA”), Pub. L. No. 104-132,\n110 Stat. 1214, on the basis of his counsel’s alleged\ndeficiencies in presenting addiction as a mitigating factor and\nin preparing Dr. Levy to testify. I cannot agree, however,\nwith the majority’s conclusion that Miles is not entitled to\nrelief based on his counsel’s deficient investigation of his\ntroubled background. In rejecting this claim, the state court\napplied Strickland in a way inconsistent with the holdings of\nseveral Supreme Court cases. Its decision was therefore\n“contrary to” clearly established Federal law, and we should\nconduct de novo review. On de novo review, I would\nconclude that Miles’s counsel was constitutionally deficient\nand that Miles was prejudiced by this deficiency. On this\npoint, therefore, I dissent.\n\f38                          MILES V . RYAN\n\n      A. AEDPA\n\n    The Arizona Superior Court rejected Miles’s failure-to-\ninvestigate claim on the ground that “a Defendant must bear\nsome responsibility to assist his or her attorney in preparing\na defense [and that] an attorney should be able to rely on\nhis/her client to bring pertinent facts to his/her attention.”1\nBecause this ground is “contrary to . . . clearly established\nFederal law,” this claim should be reviewed de novo.\n28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1); Frantz v. Hazey, 533 F.3d 724, 734\n(9th Cir. 2008) (en banc).\n\n   Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), the\nseminal ineffective assistance of counsel case, explained that\n\n         [t]he reasonableness of counsel’s actions may\n         be determined or substantially influenced by\n         the defendant’s own statements or actions. . . .\n         In particular, what investigation decisions are\n         reasonable depends critically on such\n         information. . . . [W]hen a defendant has\n         given counsel reason to believe that pursuing\n         certain investigations would be fruitless or\n         even harmful, counsel’s failure to pursue\n         those investigations may not later be\n         challenged as unreasonable.\n\n  1\n     T he state court also held that Miles could not make a claim under\nArizona Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.1(e) because his evidence was not\n“new.” Post-conviction Strickland claims in California are brought under\nRule 32.1(a), which allows post conviction relief when “[t]he conviction\nor sentence was in violation of the Constitution.” Because the two\nsubsections provide separate grounds for relief, the state court’s discussion\nof Rule 32.1(e) does not bear on its Strickland analysis, and so it is\nirrelevant to this appeal.\n\f                        MILES V . RYAN                        39\n\nId. at 691. What Strickland did not say is that a failure to\ninvestigate claim can be dismissed out of hand whenever the\ndefendant had information about his past and failed to\nprovide it to his lawyer. Instead, Strickland stated only that\ncompetent counsel can rely to some degree, with regard to the\nscope of an investigation, on what the defendant does tell the\nlawyer, not on what he does not.\n\n    After Strickland, the Supreme Court specifically held,\nmore than once, that an attorney’s duty to investigate a\ndefendant’s background in preparation for sentencing is not\ncircumscribed by the degree to which the defendant offers up\nmitigating information about his past. In Porter v.\nMcCollum, for example, the court emphasized that whether\na defendant is “fatalistic or uncooperative . . . does not\nobviate the need for defense counsel to conduct some sort of\nmitigation investigation.” 588 U.S. —, 130 S. Ct. 447, 453\n(2009). And in Rompilla v. Beard, the Court held counsel’s\nmitigation investigation deficient despite the defendant’s\n“minimal” contributions and refusal to discuss his\nbackground. 545 U.S. 374, 381–82 (2005). In contrast, the\nCourt has explained, a defendant’s active obstruction of\ncounsel’s efforts to perform a mitigation investigation can\nprevent him from showing prejudice under Strickland. See\nSchriro v. Landrigan, 550 U.S. 465, 466 (2007). Except in\nthat circumstance, the Court has recognized, a competent\nattorney would independently seek mitigation evidence rather\nthan rely on the defendant’s representations about his past.\n\n    Moreover, the ABA Guidelines in effect at the time of\nMiles’s sentencing specified that “[t]he investigation for the\npreparation of the sentencing phase should be conducted\nregardless of any initial assertion by the client that mitigation\nis not to be offered.” See ABA Guidelines for the\n\f40                      MILES V . RYAN\n\nAppointment and Performance of Counsel in Death Penalty\nCases 11.4.1(C) (1989). “Prevailing norms of practice as\nreflected in American Bar Association standards . . . are\nguides to determining what is reasonable . . . .” Strickland,\n466 U.S. at 688.\n\n    The state court did recite the general, two-prong\nStrickland standard at the beginning of its opinion (under the\nheading “standard of review”). But then, as evidenced by the\npassages quoted above, the court did not apply that standard\nin accord with clearly established Supreme Court precedents\nwhen evaluating the substance of Miles’s claim as it related\nto Sattler’s investigation of his background. Instead, it held\nthat there cannot be ineffective assistance of\ncounsel—indeed, the question cannot even be litigated—if\nthe defendant did not affirmatively inform his counsel at trial\nof the information he now contends should have been\ndeveloped and used.\n\n     A similar sequence occurred in Lafler v. Cooper, in which\nthe state court articulated the correct standard established by\nStrickland but then “fai[ed] to apply Strickland to assess the\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim respondent raised,”\nmeaning that “the state court’s adjudication was contrary to\nclearly established federal law.” 132 S. Ct. 1376, 1390\n(2012); see also Premo v. Moore, 131 S. Ct. 733, 743 (2011)\n(citing Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 694 (2002), for the\nproposition that “[a] federal habeas court may issue the writ\nunder the ‘contrary to’ clause if the state court applies a rule\ndifferent from the governing law set forth in our cases . . . .”).\nIn sum, the Supreme Court has never imposed an affirmative\ndisclosure obligation on defendants and has recognized that\nattorneys have an obligation to investigate mitigation\n\f                       MILES V . RYAN                        41\n\nevidence regardless of whether the defendant has provided\nmitigating information to counsel.\n\n    The majority argues that it is wrong to “attribut[e] strict\nrules to [the Supreme] Court’s recent case law.” Maj. Op. at\n30 (quoting Cullen v. Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. 1388, 1406–07\n(2011)). I agree entirely. My argument is not that we should\napply a bright-line rule when evaluating the performance of\ncounsel; my argument is that the Arizona Superior Court\nerred by doing just that, treating the evaluation of Miles’s\nStrickland claim as if it turned entirely on the fact that he\ncould have told his lawyer about his childhood but did not do\nso. The Arizona Superior Court’s flat statement that “an\nattorney should be able to rely on his/her client to bring\npertinent facts to his/her attention” is thus squarely\ninconsistent with clearly established Supreme Court law.\nMiles’s claim should therefore be reviewed de novo.\n\n   B. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n    In evaluating the merits of Miles’s ineffective assistance\nof counsel claim, I begin by comparing with some clarity and\ndepth the facts about Miles’s background known to Sattler\nbefore the sentencing hearing and the facts that came to light\nduring his state habeas proceedings.\n\n    The record paints a fairly clear picture of what Sattler\nknew about Miles’s background before his sentencing.\nViewed next to what came out later, it wasn’t much. In a\ndetailed letter to Dr. Levy, Sattler wrote that Miles was\nadopted when he was two months old, and that “all the\ninformation I have received about [Miles’s adoptive mother]\nindicates that she was very devoted to Kevin and worked very\nhard to give him material things as well as a great deal of love\n\f42                    MILES V . RYAN\n\nand affection.” Sattler notes that Miles moved to Winslow\nwith his adoptive mother when he was young and then\ndiscusses his high school years, indicating that he was “well\nliked,” “active in student activities,” and that “there was\nnever any incidence of violence in his school years that\nanyone is aware of.” The information about Miles’s pre-high\nschool life takes up one paragraph in the letter.\n\n    After interviewing Miles, Dr. Levy wrote a letter to\nSattler in which he indicated that Miles’s adoptive mother\n“was a single parent who held a variety of jobs from\nprofessional to laborer,” and that her habit of frequently\nchanging jobs may have been due to alcoholism. Still, Dr.\nLevy says, Miles’s “early years were described as good ones\nand ‘pretty normal.’” The Presentence Report does not shed\nany additional light on Miles’s childhood, repeating the\nassertion that his mother was an alcoholic and that “she\ncooked, waited tables, and worked at a convenience store,\nbefore becoming a nursing home administrator.” The PSR\nalso notes that Miles had trouble fitting in because he was\nblack in a small Arizona town. This, then, was what Sattler\nknew of Miles’s childhood: that he was adopted at a young\nage and that his adoptive mother may have been an alcoholic,\nbut that she worked hard and provided him with an\nupbringing that was “pretty normal.”\n\n   The investigations conducted after Miles was sentenced,\nwhich resulted in a 33-page report prepared for his state\nhabeas proceedings, paint a very different picture, one rife\nwith drugs, prostitution, and violence. Miles’s adoptive\nmother, Lois, was married to a pimp named Alfred Miles,\nwho ran a bar, restaurant, and hotel in Tulsa called El\nRancho. Miles’s birth mother was one of Alfred’s prostitutes,\nand may have been a heroin addict. Both Lois and Miles’s\n\f                      MILES V . RYAN                       43\n\nbirth mother lived in rooms at the El Rancho. Lois was\nterrified of Alfred and often heard him beating Miles’s birth\nmother mercilessly, possibly while she was pregnant with\nMiles. Lois informally adopted Miles, and when he was two\nshe took him and fled to Arizona, settling in Winslow.\n\n    In Winslow, Lois met Jasper Renfro, who operated a bar\ncalled the Prairie Moon, which had rooms in the back that\nwere rented to prostitutes for $2.00. Lois began working\nthere as a prostitute and bartender, and moved into a two-\nbedroom house next door. Lois and Miles slept in one room,\nand prostitutes turned tricks in the other. When Lois had a\ncustomer, she would ask one of the other prostitutes to watch\nMiles while she was occupied. Lois drank heavily, and\nalthough her fellow prostitutes insisted that none of them\nused drugs, a Winslow police officer who was interviewed\nonce found heroin at the house and recalled that the women\nthere were “all drug addicts.”\n\n    Kevin Hernandez, who was Miles’s age and grew up on\nthe same block, remembered looking over the fence that faced\nthe alley behind the Prairie Moon and seeing prostitutes\nhaving sex. He also remembered hearing gunfire on\nweekends. At one point during Lois and Miles’s time at the\nhouse, “a girl named Charmaine shot an Indian at the house.\nThe police followed the blood trail to the front door and tore\nthe house apart looking for the gun.\n\n    When Miles was around 7, he and Lois moved to another\nhouse a few blocks away from the Prairie Moon. A prostitute\nnamed Connie, who lived with Lois and Miles next to the\nPrairie Moon and was also a heroin addict, was shot and\nkilled about a year after Lois and Miles moved to their nearby\nhouse. Lois was trying to turn her life around at this point,\n\f44                      MILES V . RYAN\n\nand took a job as a cook, although she may have continued\nworking as a prostitute (her boss was a “known pimp,”\naccording to the investigator’s report, and she occasionally\nleft Miles alone at the restaurant). 1979, when Miles was\naround 11, Lois got a job as a dietary aide at a convalescent\ncenter. She worked there for seven years, rising to become\nthe administrator before being fired for drinking on the job\nthe same year Miles graduated from high school. Lois and\nMiles slept in the same bed until he was 14.\n\n        1. Deficient Performance\n\n     The majority views Sattler’s decision not to further\ninvestigate Miles’s background as reasonable in light of her\nstrategic decision to present Miles as a fundamentally normal\nperson who had a viable chance of being rehabilitated if\nspared execution. While the Supreme Court has instructed us\nto treat with deference the strategic decisions of counsel, see,\ne.g., Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1407–08, it is hard to see how\nSattler could have made a reasonable strategic choice not to\npresent the harrowing details of Miles’s childhood when she\nknew virtually nothing about what that childhood was like.\nTreating this strategic decision as determinative introduces an\nelement of circularity into the analysis: Sattler’s choice not to\nlearn about Miles’s childhood was reasonable because it was\npart of her strategy, which she adopted because she knew\nnothing about Miles’s childhood. As the Supreme Court has\nobserved, “counsel’s failure to uncover and present\nvoluminous mitigating evidence at sentencing [cannot] be\njustified as a tactical decision . . . [where] counsel had not\n‘fulfilled their obligation to conduct a thorough investigation\nof the defendant’s background.’” Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S.\n510, 523 (2003) (quoting Williams, 529 U.S. at 396). In other\nwords, a strategic choice is only reasonable to the extent that\n\f                           MILES V . RYAN                              45\n\n“the investigation supporting [that choice] . . . was itself\nreasonable.” Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 523 (emphasis in\noriginal). The relevant question, then, is whether Sattler’s\ninvestigation “fell below an objective standard of\nreasonableness. . . . under prevailing professional norms.”\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 688.\n\n    Sattler’s efforts to investigate Miles’s background fell\nbelow prevailing professional norms. Sattler did work with\nan investigator in preparation for trial, but that investigator\nwas not trained in investigating homicide cases or conducting\nmitigation investigations. Sattler’s letters to the investigator\nshow that Sattler was focused on finding people in Tucson\nwho might know something about the crime, rather than on\nfinding information about Miles’s background.\n\n    Sattler did ask the investigator to interview four people\nfrom Winslow. Of these, the investigator spoke to three high\nschool friends who knew nothing of Miles’s earlier\nchildhood. The investigator submitted the fruits of these\ninterviews to Sattler in two “interview reports,” each a single\npage, and no formal background report was prepared. The\ninvestigator never traveled to Winslow. When she was\ndeposed in connection with Miles’s federal habeas petition,2\nthe investigator had no recollection of Miles’s name or of her\nwork on the case, and, looking over the record, she expressed\nsurprise at how little information her investigation produced.\nAlthough Sattler knew that Miles had been adopted at an\nearly age and that his mother was an alcoholic who had\n\n\n 2\n   Because AEDPA deference does not apply to the state court’s rejection\nof Miles’s Strickland claim, Pinholster does not prevent consideration of\nevidence that was before the district court under § 2254(e)(2). Pinholster,\n131 S. Ct. at 1401.\n\f46                      MILES V . RYAN\n\ntrouble holding a job, she and her investigator did nothing to\nfind out about his pre-high school life.\n\n    In short, this was not a case in which counsel “‘did spend\nconsiderable time and effort investigating avenues for\nmitigation.’” Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1404 (quoting\nPinholster v. Ayers, 590 F.3d 651, 701–02 (9th Cir. 2009)\n(Kozinski, J., dissenting)). The ABA guidelines in effect at\nthe time made clear that “[t]he investigation for preparation\nof the sentencing phase . . . should comprise efforts to\ndiscover all reasonably available mitigating evidence.” ABA\nGuidelines 11.4.1(C). Thus, under the prevailing professional\nnorms at the time of Miles’s sentencing, “counsel had an\n‘obligation to conduct a thorough investigation of the\ndefendant’s backrgound.’” Porter, 130 S. Ct. at 452 (quoting\nWilliams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 396 (2000)).\n\n    Like the investigations in Porter and Wiggins, Sattler’s\nwork here fell well short of the thoroughness required in\ncapital cases. As in Porter, Sattler “ignored pertinent\navenues for investigation of which [she] should have been\naware,” 130 S. Ct. at 453, i.e., Miles’s life up until he entered\nhigh school. As in Wiggins, Sattler “abandoned [her]\ninvestigation of [Miles’s] background after having acquired\nonly rudimentary knowledge of his history from a narrow set\nof sources.” 539 U.S. at 524. In Wiggins, those sources\nincluded psychological tests, records from the Department of\nSocial Services documenting petitioner’s time in the foster\nsystem, and a one page account of petitioner’s personal\nhistory contained in the presentence report. The materials\navailable to Sattler were considerably more scant. She did\nnot ask Dr. Levy to conduct any psychological tests, and she\nobtained no comparable government records concerning\nMiles’s childhood.\n\f                       MILES V . RYAN                        47\n\n     Even if Miles’s reticence about disclosing the details of\nhis childhood with Sattler is taken as a factor in the deficient\nperformance calculus (rather than the sole determinant, as the\nstate court held), that reticence does not countervail Sattler’s\nfailure to investigate. After all, Miles may not have even\nremembered some of the circumstances of his early life, yet\n“early childhood trauma, even if it is not consciously\nremembered, may have ‘catastrophic and permanent effects\non those who . . . survive it.’” James v. Ryan, 679 F.3d 780,\n815 (9th Cir. 2012) (quoting Hamilton v. Ayers, 583 F.3d\n1100, 1132 (9th Cir. 2009)). Miles “may have been fatalistic\nor uncooperative, but that does not obviate the need for\ndefense counsel to conduct some sort of mitigation\ninvestigation.” Porter, 130 S. Ct. at 453 (emphasis in\noriginal) (citing Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 381–82). Sattler’s\ninvestigation into Miles’s background, particularly her failure\nto learn any of the disturbing facts about his early childhood,\nwas not reasonably in line with prevailing professional\nnorms.\n\n       2. Prejudice\n\n    The majority characterizes the additional information\nabout Miles’s childhood that came to light after his\nsentencing as “largely cumulative” of what was before the\nsentencing judge, and concludes that even if Sattler’s\nrepresentation was not constitutionally deficient, there was no\n“reasonable probability that, but for [Sattler’s] unprofessional\nerrors, the result of the proceeding would have been\ndifferent.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694. I cannot agree.\n\n   It is worth remembering how little of Miles’s pre-high\nschool life was in the record when he was sentenced. The\n\f48                    MILES V . RYAN\n\nPSR contains two paragraphs of social history, and has this to\nsay about Miles’s childhood:\n\n       The defendant reported his adoptive mother\n       was an alcoholic. She cooked, waited tables,\n       and worked at a convenience store, before\n       becoming a nursing home administrator. He\n       reported he was not accepted by everyone\n       because he was black, and his mother was\n       white. He also indicate[d] he experienced\n       ‘culture shock’ when he and his mother\n       moved into a more affluent neighborhood and\n       attended a better school.\n\nDr. Levy’s report, which was also before the sentencing\njudge, indicates that Miles’s mother was an alcoholic and that\nracism was an issue for him, but notes that “his early years\nwere described as good ones and ‘pretty normal.’” These\nbrief summaries are, to put it mildly, a far cry from the\ninformation that came to light later, which showed that both\nMiles’s birth and adoptive mothers were prostitutes, that\nMiles’s birth mother was a heroin addict and may have been\nbeaten by her pimp while she was pregnant with him, and that\nMiles spent his early years living in a two bedroom brothel,\nsurrounded by prostitution, heroin use, alcohol abuse,\nshootings, and even murder. To call this childhood anywhere\nnear “pretty normal” is strange indeed. The difference\nbetween these two narratives is one of kind, not degree.\n\n    I also cannot accept the majority’s view that this\nmitigation evidence is far milder than that in James v. Ryan,\n679 F.3d 780. As in James, Miles survived a childhood rife\nwith violence, drug use, and crime. While there is no\nindication that Miles was, like James, physically abused,\n\f                       MILES V . RYAN                       49\n\nJames was not raised by prostitutes, nor was his childhood\nhome the scene of murders and shootings. For, contrary to\nthe majority’s account, James did not “grow up” in the\nabusive circumstances described. Instead, at age four, James\nwas adopted by parents who were strict but loving, and his\nlife circumstances from thence forward took a dramatic turn\nfor the better. Id. at 812. Miles saw his situation improve\nsomewhat as he aged, but he and his mother didn’t move out\nof the house next to the Prairie Moon until he was seven, and\nhis mother may have continued to work as a prostitute until\nhe was 11. They slept in the same bed until he was 14. My\npoint here is not to downplay the horrors faced by the young\nJames, but to suggest that he and Miles survived conditions\nthat were far more comparable than the majority lets on.\n\n    The relevant question, at any rate, is not whether Miles’s\nstory is better or worse than any of the sad tales that have\ngraced the pages of the Federal Reporter, but whether there\nis a “reasonable probability” that he would not have been\nsentenced to death had it been told. See Strickland, 466 U.S.\nat 694. Notably, “it is not necessary for the habeas petitioner\nto demonstrate that the newly presented mitigation evidence\nwould necessarily overcome the aggravating circumstances.”\nCorrell v. Ryan, 539 F.3d 938, 951–52 (9th Cir. 2008). What\nis required “is a probability sufficient to undermine\nconfidence in the outcome.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694. In\nanalyzing whether the new mitigation evidence creates the\nrequired “reasonable probability,” Strickland instructs us to\nconsider whether “the omitted evidence would have changed\nthe conclusion that the aggravating circumstances outweighed\nthe mitigating circumstances.” Id. at 700.\n\n    Applying this framework shows that Miles suffered\nprejudice due to Sattler’s deficient performance. The\n\f50                       MILES V . RYAN\n\naggravating factors established at sentencing were not\noverwhelming: The judge relied on four, one of which was\nlater overturned by the Arizona Supreme Court. The other\nthree were based on (1) Miles’s three armed robberies, (2) the\nprofit motive behind Miles’s participation in the crime, and\n(3) the “especially cruel manner” in which the murder was\ncommitted, a finding based on the fear suffered by Baeuerlen\nduring the twenty minute drive out to the desert. Against\nthese aggravating factors, the judge considered and rejected\na variety of statutory and non-statutory mitigating factors.\nWhile the judge mentioned that he had received numerous\nletters attesting to Miles’s previously non-violent nature, he\ndiscounted the letters as irrelevant when considering the\nviolent felon before him. There was no mention of Miles’s\nchildhood.\n\n    Given the weakness of the aggravating factors and the\ntotal absence of any mention of Miles’s childhood in the\njudge’s sentencing, the additional mitigating evidence Sattler\ncould have uncovered is sufficient to “undermine confidence\nin the outcome.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694. “[A] penalty\nphase ineffective assistance claim depends on the magnitude\nof the discrepancy between what counsel did investigate and\npresent and what counsel could have investigated and\npresented.” Stankewitz v. Woodford, 365 F.3d 706, 716 (9th\nCir. 2004). Here, that discrepancy was substantial. As in\nWilliams, “the graphic description of [Miles’s] childhood . . .\nmight well have influenced the [judge’s] appraisal of his\nmoral culpability.” 529 U.S. at 398.3\n\n\n\n  3\n     Because I would reverse on the present record, I do not address\nwhether Martinez v. Ryan, 132 S. Ct. 1309 (2012), allows Miles to\nintroduce new facts at this stage.\n\f                       MILES V . RYAN                       51\n\n   C. Conclusion\n\n    Reviewing Miles’s claim de novo, it is clear that Sattler’s\nperformance was deficient, and that Miles was prejudiced by\nthat deficiency. Sattler could not have reasonably chosen the\nparticular strategy she decided upon without first making a\nreasonable investigation into Miles’s past, and the\nsignificance of the missing information is sufficient to\nundermine my confidence that Miles would nevertheless have\nbeen sentenced to death. I therefore dissent.\n\f",

The panel\nconcluded that counsel adopted a permissible sentencing\nstrategy supported by mitigation witnesses, and that\nportraying Miles as a crazed drug addict with a sordid past\nwould have contradicted that chosen strategy.

She\ndid not agree with the conclusion that Miles is not entitled to\nrelief based on counsel’s deficient investigation of his\ntroubled background.

Petitioner challenges only his capital sentence; he\ndoes not challenge his underlying felony murder conviction,\narising from his role in a car-jacking.1 Petitioner argues that\nhis counsel was ineffective at sentencing because she failed\nto focus on Petitioner’s drug addiction (rather than on\nintoxication), enlisted an unqualified expert, and failed to\ninvestigate Petitioner’s social history thoroughly enough.\n\n   We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291 and\n2253, and we affirm.\n\n        FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       A. The Crime\n\n    On an afternoon late in 1992, Petitioner was standing on\na street corner in Tucson, Arizona, with Levi Jackson and\nRay Hernandez. Jackson was carrying a pistol that the three\n\n\n   1\n      Petitioner briefed several additional issues that the district court\ndeclined to certify for appeal. Most of those issues relate to sentencing,\nbut one challenges the conviction. W e have examined all the uncertified\nissues, and none meets the standard for granting a certificate of\nappealability. See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122258\"><a href=\"/opinion/122258/miller-el-v-cockrell/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">322</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 336 (2003) (stating\nthat a court should grant a certificate of appealability only when a habeas\npetitioner has demonstrated “that reasonable jurists could debate whether\n(or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in\na different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve\nencouragement to proceed further” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\f6                       MILES V . RYAN\n\nof them had just obtained together; he had told Petitioner and\nHernandez of his plan to commit a car-jacking. Specifically,\naccording to Petitioner’s post-arrest statement to the police,\nJackson had told them that he was “gonna get somebody’s\ncar, take ‘em off in the middle of the desert, and shoot ‘em.”\nAt the time, Jackson and Hernandez were both 16 years old.\nPetitioner was 24 years old.\n\n    When Patricia Baeuerlen drove up and stopped at the\ncorner, Jackson approached her car and asked for “a light.”\nWhen she turned to reach her cigarette lighter, Jackson\npointed the weapon at her and told her to move over. He\nunlocked the car to allow Petitioner and Hernandez to enter\nand sit in the rear. While Jackson drove the car out to the\ndesert, Hernandez held the pistol, but Petitioner also held it at\nsome point. They drove Baeuerlen out of the city, into the\ndesert, and stopped at a dirt road. There, Jackson told\nBaeuerlen to get out of the car and take off her shoes and\njacket. She obeyed. After taunting and harassing Baeuerlen\nfor five to ten minutes, Jackson suddenly shot her in the\nchest. Baeuerlen died as a result of the gunshot. According\nto testimony presented at trial and sentencing, Jackson—not\nPetitioner—shot Baeuerlen as he and Petitioner were walking\naway from Baeuerlen and returning to the car. Throughout\nthe ordeal, starting with the drive to the desert, Baeuerlen was\npleading for her life.\n\n    After the shooting, Jackson, Petitioner, and Hernandez\ndrove away. According to Petitioner’s post-arrest statement,\nhe thought that Baeuerlen was still alive when they left her in\nthe desert. No one sought help for Baeuerlen. Later the same\nday, Petitioner used Baeuerlen’s ATM card, and a PIN that he\nhad found in her belongings, to take money out of her bank\naccount. The next day, Petitioner drove Baeuerlen’s car to\n\f                      MILES V . RYAN                        7\n\nPhoenix, where he went shopping at malls, exchanged\nBaeuerlen’s children’s Christmas presents for other goods,\nand went drinking with old friends. Petitioner told those\nfriends about the murder, insisting that he did not pull the\ntrigger, but smiling and laughing as he related the events.\n\n   B. Arrest and Interrogation\n\n    In the early hours of the following morning, that is, the\nsecond day after the murder, police arrested Petitioner in\nChandler, Arizona, following a high-speed chase in\nBaeuerlen’s car. The police found Baeuerlen’s ATM card,\ncredit card, jewelry, and other personal items in his\npossession. Later that morning, Tucson detectives began a\ntape-recorded interrogation that lasted about five hours.\nDuring the interrogation, Petitioner initially explained his\npossession of the car by telling the detectives two different\nstories, neither of which placed him at the scene of the\nmurder. But, after several hours of interrogation, Petitioner\nadmitted to his involvement in the murder. Specifically, he\nadmitted to knowing of Jackson’s plan to car-jack and shoot\nsomeone, to participating in obtaining the pistol with Jackson\nand Hernandez, to holding the weapon at some point during\nthe drive out to the desert, and to watching Jackson shoot\nBaeuerlen.\n\n   C. Trial and Sentencing\n\n   Soon after Petitioner’s arrest, Barbara Sattler was\nappointed as his counsel and represented him through trial\nand sentencing. After a jury convicted Petitioner of first-\ndegree felony murder, dangerous kidnapping, and dangerous\n\f8                               MILES V . RYAN\n\narmed robbery,2 the trial court reviewed a pre-sentence report\n(“PSR”) and held a sentencing hearing.\n\n    The PSR states that the crime occurred at around 1:30\np.m. and that Petitioner reported having used crack cocaine\n“four or five hours earlier” and not having slept the night\nbefore. The PSR also contains statements from Petitioner that\nhe expected to get money from the car-jacking and that he\nwanted to commit another robbery with the pistol. The PSR\nrepeats Petitioner’s assertions that he did not believe that\nJackson would kill Baeuerlen and that Petitioner thought that\nJackson would have killed him if he had tried to stop the\nmurder.\n\n    The social history section of the PSR contains the\nfollowing information. Petitioner was adopted at the age of\n4 months. His adoptive mother was an alcoholic who\nnevertheless maintained employment, eventually rising past\njobs as a waitress and cook to become a nursing home\nadministrator. Although Petitioner is black, his adoptive\nmother was white, which caused some degree of social\nproblems; those problems grew worse when Petitioner and his\nmother moved to a more affluent neighborhood. Petitioner\nfound a way to fit in by becoming a “class clown” and by\nplaying basketball. Indeed, despite poor grades, he graduated\nfrom high school and won a basketball scholarship to a Bible\ncollege, but he dropped out of college after only a week.\nPetitioner later served in the Navy, where he was disciplined\nfor substance abuse and assault before receiving an other-\n\n\n\n\n    2\n        As noted, none of these convictions is at issue here.\n\f                          MILES V . RYAN                              9\n\nthan-honorable discharge. He also married and had a child,\nthough he later grew apart from his wife and began using\ndrugs. His wife eventually left him, leading him to be evicted\nfrom their apartment. A month later, his mother died, and his\ndrug habit grew worse.\n\n    At the sentencing hearing, Sattler called an expert, Dr.\nMartin Levy, Ph.D., to discuss Petitioner’s drug use. Dr.\nLevy is a clinical psychologist who had evaluated Petitioner\nduring a two-hour session. Dr. Levy testified that Petitioner\nreported using crack cocaine the night before the car-jacking.\nIn particular, Dr. Levy testified that Petitioner’s “mental state\nwas compromised by intoxication . . . with cocaine.”\n(Emphasis added.) Dr. Levy also testified that Petitioner’s\ndescription of his mental state during the crime suggested a\nstate of “disassociat[ion],”3 which was consistent with\nPetitioner’s reported drug use.\n\n    The prosecutor objected to Dr. Levy’s testimony on the\nground that it lacked foundation. The sentencing judge\nagreed and determined that, because Dr. Levy had insufficient\nknowledge of when and in what quantities Petitioner used\ndrugs, he could not testify with specificity as to Petitioner’s\nlevel of impairment or judgment at the time of the crime.\nNevertheless, in Sattler’s closing argument, she reiterated her\nposition that Petitioner was “under the influence of drugs and\nalcohol that day.”\n\n\n  3\n    Dr. Levy’s testimony and reports use the terms “disassociation” and\n“dissociation” interchangeably. “Dissociation” is a “[s]eparation of\npsychologic experiences and events that are normally related, leading to\na distortion of experience and of the meaning of personal and\ninterpersonal events.” Robert J. Campbell, M.D., Campbell’s Psychiatric\nDictionary 289 (9th ed. 2009).\n\f10                          MILES V . RYAN\n\n     Sattler focused only briefly on Petitioner’s social history\nat sentencing. Two character witnesses testified about his\nbackground and his nonviolent nature.4 Indeed, Sattler’s\nclosing arguments characterize him as a relatively normal\nperson—one who graduated from high school, who usually\nmaintained gainful employment, who served in the military\nand completed most of his term of service, who married, and\nwho had a child—but who made some mistakes after his wife\nleft and his mother died.\n\n    Ultimately, the trial judge sentenced Petitioner to death by\nlethal injection.5 In so doing, the trial judge cited three\naggravating factors:6 (1) that Petitioner had previous\nconvictions for three separate crimes of violence (armed\nrobberies), (2) that Petitioner committed the car-jacking in\npursuit of pecuniary gain, and (3) that the murder was\n\n\n\n\n 4\n   In addition, Sattler planned to call Petitioner’s estranged wife to testify\nbut did not do so because Petitioner had objected.

He rejected the contention that Petitioner\nwas only a minor participant in the crime. The trial judge\nalso rejected unforeseeability8 of the murder and Petitioner’s\nage as mitigating factors. As to expressions of remorse, the\ntrial judge found them insincere and, in any event,\noutweighed by the aggravating factors listed above:\n\n         The court finds that the defendant’s\n         expression of remorse was insufficient to\n         outweigh the aggravating circumstances of\n         this case. No remorse was evidenced when\n         the defendant went to Phoenix, after the\n         murder, in the car of Miss Baeuerlen, to party\n         with his friends. No remorse was evidenced\n         when the defendant was captured by the\n         Phoenix Police.

Miles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1192434\"><a href=\"/opinion/1192434/state-v-miles/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1028</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Ariz. 1996). Petitioner did not petition for certiorari to\nthe United States Supreme Court, but he did file a state court\npetition for post-conviction relief (“PCR”) under Rule 32 of\nthe Arizona Rules of Criminal Procedure. The Arizona\nSuperior Court denied Petitioner’s PCR petition, rejecting his\nineffective assistance of counsel claims on the merits. With\nrespect to Sattler’s failure to focus on addiction, the state\ncourt concluded both that Sattler’s performance was not\ndeficient and that Petitioner failed to demonstrate prejudice.\nWith respect to the other two claims in this case, the state\ncourt concluded only that Sattler’s performance was not\ndeficient—it made no determination as to prejudice. The\nArizona Supreme Court denied the petition for review of the\nPCR decision.\n\n    Before denying Petitioner’s PCR petition, the Arizona\nSuperior Court, however, ordered an evidentiary hearing. In\npreparation for that hearing, Petitioner underwent more\nextensive psychological testing. Dr. Joseph Geffen, Ph.D., a\nclinical psychologist, prepared a report describing Petitioner\nas using drugs to “self-medicat[e]” and as having resorted to\ncrime because of “his perceived need for drugs without which\nhe cannot cope.” Dr. Levy had described Petitioner’s drug\nuse similarly, as self-medication, in his pre-sentence\nevaluation, but did not connect Petitioner’s motivation for his\ncrimes to a need to acquire drugs.\n\n    In preparation for the state hearing, Petitioner’s counsel\nhired an investigator to probe further into his social history.\nThe investigator produced a detailed report, containing\n\f14                         MILES V . RYAN\n\ninformation gleaned from interviews with many people who\nknew Petitioner and his mother during his youth. The\nadditional history confirms that Petitioner’s mother was an\nalcoholic and suggests that she may also have used heroin, or\nat least socialized with those who did. The investigation\nrevealed that his mother worked as a prostitute and perhaps\nran her own whorehouse out of her home. When Petitioner\nwas approximately 11 years old, his mother began work at a\nnursing home (and may have given up prostitution); there, she\nrose to become an administrator, a position she held until\nPetitioner’s last year of high school, when she was fired for\ndrinking on the job. Additionally, the report characterized\nPetitioner’s hometown of Winslow, Arizona, as being\nsegregated, corrupt, and rife with prostitution, crime, drugs,\nand gambling. The investigation confirmed that Petitioner\nand his mother suffered at least some alienation due to their\nmixed-race household.\n\n    The additional social history also suggests that\nPetitioner’s mother was an “extremely protective mother”\nwho made him the center of her life. She was “infatuated”\nwith her son and “coddle[d]” him. She slept in the same bed\nas Petitioner until he was 14 years old. She “read to him\nconstantly and sang to him when she fed him,” past an age\nconsidered “normal” by a friend. The additional social\nhistory reveals that, although Petitioner’s mother disciplined\nhim by spanking him with a hairbrush when he was 4 or 5\nyears old, she later discontinued the practice and did not\nphysically abuse him.9 She bought Petitioner “everything he\n\n\n  9\n     Petitioner now disputes this finding and recently filed an affidavit\nstating that his mother routinely physically abused him when he was\nbetween the ages of 4 and 14 years old by beating him with “belts,\nextension cords, paddles, switches, and her fists.” Because this evidence\n\f                           MILES V .

He went to\nchurch twice a week for Bible study until at least his junior\nhigh school years, receiving a ride from a local bus ministry.\nWhen he was in junior high school, his basketball coach\nfrequently drove him home from practices. He became good\nfriends with a local family, spending a great deal of time at\ntheir home; indeed, they treated him like their own child.\nNotably, he remained in contact with members of that family\nwell into adulthood—two of them were character witnesses\nat his sentencing hearing. According to those two witnesses,\nPetitioner stayed in touch with them after leaving Winslow\nand visited them to introduce his wife. One of the witnesses\nwas a close friend when she and Petitioner were both living\nin Tucson; she was present for the birth of his daughter.\n\n    The additional social history investigation also looked\ninto Petitioner’s high school years, during which he played on\nthe basketball team and earned a varsity letter in his senior\nyear, helping to win the state championship. He had a close-\nknit group of five friends, and he was popular with girls.\n\n    E.

In his report, Dr. Geffen stated that, after learning\nabout “modern methods of evaluating mitigation factors in\ndeath penalty cases,” years after his initial evaluation of\nPetitioner, he thought that he “had not done as complete an\nevaluation as possible.” Dr. Geffen further concluded: (1)\nthat Petitioner was “experiencing an altered state of mind at\nthe time of [Baeuerlen’s] murder;” (2) that, “[a]lthough\nphysically present, [Petitioner] was emotionally and mentally\n‘not there’ in terms of his awareness and appreciation of\nevents around him, due to a dissociative state of mind, during\nwhich the event appeared to him as unreal and disconnected\nfrom him;” (3) that Petitioner’s “substance abuse at the time\nwas part of a lifelong adjustment problem which resulted in\na severe state of depression, and that the drugs served the\npurpose of numbing his perceptions after some catastrophic\nlosses and personal failures, including the loss of his mother\nand of his marriage and family and job, almost\nsimultaneously, rather than being an isolated recreational\nact;” and (4) that Petitioner’s “altered mental state met the\ncriteria for statutory mitigation, since he was not capable of\nconforming to the lawful requirements due to his impaired\nmental state.”\n\n    Around the same time, Petitioner was also examined by\nDr. Wm. Michael Cochran, M.D. Dr. Cochran concluded\nthat, “at the time of his participation in the crime(s) on\nDecember 7, 1992, [Petitioner] was using alcohol, crack\n\f                          MILES V .

But\nthe district court ultimately determined that an evidentiary\nhearing was “neither warranted nor required because\nPetitioner ha[d] not alleged facts which, if proved, would\nentitle him to relief.” The district court then denied\nPetitioner’s petition, certifying only the issues discussed in\nthis opinion.

Sattler’s decision to rely on Dr. Levy and to focus\non other mitigating factors, such as depression, rather than on\naddiction, was a matter of strategy.12 Sattler’s arguments at\nsentencing support our conclusion. Her chosen tack—\ncharacterizing Petitioner as a relatively normal person who\nwas suffering from depression—evinces a desire to avoid\npainting Petitioner as a drug addict. At the very least,\nSattler’s argument at sentencing raises the possibility that she\nwas motivated by such a strategy, which is all that Pinholster\nrequires. 131 S. Ct. at 1404–07.

Sattler’s decision to avoid\nasserting that Petitioner suffered from an addiction, while\nfocusing instead on lingering intoxication from the use of\ncrack cocaine, could be seen as inconsistent with a strategy of\npainting Petitioner as a normal person; if counsel thought that\ndrug use made Petitioner appear less deserving of sympathy,\none might think that she would have tried to avoid\nmentioning drugs at all.

Petitioner discussed\nhis crack cocaine use in his confession, and it was mentioned\nin the PSR, so Sattler had to address it somehow.\n\n     Moreover, Petitioner was sentenced in 1993. As recently\nas 1998, the Arizona Supreme Court was routinely rejecting\naddiction as a mitigating factor unless the defendant could\nshow intoxication at the time of the crime.

Given the state of\nArizona law at the time of trial, Sattler would have been\noperating under the assumption that intoxication was the only\nviable means of explaining Petitioner’s drug use to the\nsentencing judge. And the evidence did not rule out some\nsort of lingering intoxication—Dr. Levy discussed it in his\nreport.13 Seen from this perspective, Sattler’s strategy did not\nfall outside the wide range of professional competence or\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness.14\n\n   Even if Sattler had been deficient in failing to focus on\naddiction, we see no prejudice, the second prong of the\n\n\n  13\n     Dr. Levy’s report discusses Petitioner’s condition at the time of the\ncrime as “coming down” from crack cocaine use the previous night and\nnotes that Petitioner was dissociated from the events. At trial, Dr. Levy\ntestified that this state is common among drug users.\n\n  14\n      To be sure, in Williams, we wrote: “T he decision of the Arizona\nSupreme Court that drug use could not be considered as a mitigating factor\n‘of any kind,’ is contrary to the Supreme Court’s consistent decisions in\ncapital cases beginning more than a decade before Williams’ [1992]\ntrial.” 623 F.3d at 1270 (emphasis added). Nevertheless, as Petitioner’s\nbrief acknowledges, under Arizona law at the time of his trial, addiction\nwas not a recognized form of mitigation. Thus, although she could have\nrelied on existing United States Supreme Court decisions to challenge the\nArizona practice of ignoring the mitigating value of addiction, her strategy\nmerits deference under Strickland.\n\f24                     MILES V . RYAN\n\nStrickland standard. In assessing prejudice, we consider the\nmitigating effect of Petitioner’s drug addiction and how it\nwould have altered the balancing of aggravating and\nmitigating factors discussed at sentencing. See Porter v.\nMcCollum, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1756\"><a href=\"/opinion/1756/porter-v-mccollum/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

For many of the proposed mitigating factors\n(remorse, rehabilitation, cooperation), the trial judge made\ntwo findings—(1) that the evidence was insufficient to\nestablish the mitigating factor in the first place; and (2) that\neven if the mitigating factor were established, it would be\ninsufficient to outweigh the aggravating factors. It is highly\nunlikely that a finding of addiction as a mitigating factor\nwould have tipped the scales where none of the other\nproposed mitigators did. Indeed, addiction could be\ncharacterized as merely another element of social history,\nwhich the sentencing judge considered and found insufficient\nto outweigh the aggravators. As stated by the district court:\n\n       The sentencing judge considered Petitioner’s\n       life circumstances but found them insufficient\n       to warrant leniency.

Because\nSattler’s decision not to focus on addiction as a mitigating\nfactor was strategic and because Petitioner was not prejudiced\nas a result, he fails to meet the Strickland standard here.\n\n   B. Qualifications of Expert\n\n   Petitioner next argues that Sattler’s preparation of Dr.\nLevy was deficient. The sentencing court did not allow Dr.\nLevy to testify as to Petitioner’s drug use because of a lack of\nfoundation—Dr. Levy did not know how often Petitioner had\nbeen using drugs, or in what quantities. He did not even\nknow if, or for how long, Petitioner had slept between the\ntime he ingested drugs and the time he committed the crime.\n\n    Although Sattler’s strategy—to focus on intoxication\nrather than addiction—was reasonable, she may have failed\nto implement it appropriately. But even if that failure\n\f26                        MILES V . RYAN\n\nrepresents performance so deficient as to meet the standards\napplicable when we review a Strickland claim under\nAEDPA—a question we do not decide—Petitioner still fails\nto demonstrate prejudice. On this point, the state court made\nno determination on the merits, so we must review de novo.\nSee Porter, 130 S. Ct. at 452 (“Because the state court did not\ndecide whether Porter’s counsel was deficient, we review this\nelement of Porter’s Strickland claim de novo.”).\nSignificantly, the sentencing judge was aware of Petitioner’s\ndrug use—the PSR, which quoted some of Dr. Levy’s\nopinions, contained information about Petitioner’s “coming\ndown” from crack cocaine used the night before the crime, as\nwell as a diagnosis that Petitioner was in a “disassociated”\nstate. The excluded testimony would have added very little\nmore.\n\n    Furthermore, as the district court noted, even if Dr. Levy\ncould have testified as to the effect of Petitioner’s drug use on\nhis mental state, that testimony would have been of limited\nvalue in view of: (1) Petitioner’s “acknowledgment that he\nwas not under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of\nthe offense”; and (2) Dr. Levy’s other testimony that\n“regardless of his drug abuse Petitioner knew the difference\nbetween right and wrong and was capable of walking away\nfrom the offense, thus negating any finding of significant\nimpairment under A.R.S. § 13-703(G)(1).”15 It is not\nreasonably probable that Dr. Levy’s excluded testimony\nwould have influenced the sentencing judge because, even if\nthe judge had considered Petitioner’s drug use to be a form of\nreduced, nonstatutory intoxication, the mitigating effect of\nthat condition would have been insufficient to outweigh the\n\n 15\n    Section 13-703 (1993) has since been renumbered as Arizona Revised\nStatutes section 13-751 (2011).\n\f                        MILES V .

Investigation of Social History\n\n    Finally, Petitioner argues that Sattler’s performance was\ndeficient because she failed to investigate mitigating\ncircumstances thoroughly enough. Strickland itself involved\na claim of ineffective assistance for failure to investigate\nmitigating circumstances. For that reason, Strickland is an\nespecially good starting point for analyzing Petitioner’s claim\nthat Sattler failed to investigate sufficiently his social history.\nThe Supreme Court outlined the standards governing\ncounsel’s duty to investigate as follows:\n\n        [S]trategic choices made after thorough\n        investigation of law and facts relevant to\n        plausible options are virtually\n        unchallengeable; and strategic choices made\n        after less than complete investigation are\n        reasonable precisely to the extent that\n        reasonable professional judgments support the\n        limitations on investigation. In other words,\n        counsel has a duty to make reasonable\n        investigations or to make a reasonable\n        decision that makes particular investigations\n        unnecessary. In any ineffectiveness case, a\n        particular decision not to investigate must be\n        directly assessed for reasonableness in all the\n        circumstances, applying a heavy measure of\n        deference to counsel’s judgments.\n\f28                     MILES V . RYAN\n\n           . . . And when a defendant has given\n       counsel reason to believe that pursuing certain\n       investigations would be fruitless or even\n       harmful, counsel’s failure to pursue those\n       investigations may not later be challenged as\n       unreasonable.\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 690-91 (emphasis added).\n\n    In Pinholster, the Supreme Court provided more\nguidance, overturning an opinion in which we had drawn,\nfrom other recent Supreme Court cases, a “constitutional duty\nto investigate, and the principle that it is prima facie\nineffective assistance for counsel to abandon their\ninvestigation of the petitioner’s background after having\nacquired only rudimentary knowledge of his history from a\nnarrow set of sources.” 131 S. Ct. at 1406 (citation, internal\nquotation marks, and brackets omitted). In the decision that\nPinholster reversed, we had explained that we “could not\n‘lightly disregard’ a failure to introduce evidence of\n‘excruciating life history’ or ‘nightmarish childhood.’” Id.\n(quoting Pinholster, 590 F.3d at 684).\n\n    In reversing us, the Court in Pinholster explained\nStrickland:\n\n       “No particular set of detailed rules for\n       counsel’s conduct can satisfactorily take\n       account of the variety of circumstances faced\n       by defense counsel or the range of legitimate\n       decisions . . . .” Strickland itself rejected the\n       notion that the same investigation will be\n       required in every case.

Ct. at 788-89).\n\n    Here, Sattler’s actions are a reasonable implementation of\nher strategy—made explicit in her closing arguments at\nsentencing—to characterize Petitioner as a relatively normal\nperson who made serious mistakes after his wife left and his\nmother died. Cf. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 672–74 (finding that\ncounsel’s strategy—claiming “no significant history of\ncriminal activity” and arguing that the defendant “should be\nspared death . . . because [he] was fundamentally a good\nperson who had briefly gone badly wrong in extremely\nstressful circumstances” arising from “his inability to support\nhis family”—was professionally reasonable, justifying a\nfailure to investigate and present background information that\nmight undermine those claims).\n\n    Sattler’s failure to investigate more thoroughly is\njustified, then, by the irrelevance of additional social history\nto her chosen strategy. As Pinholster recognized, choice of\na particular strategy can make “particular investigations\nunnecessary.” 131 S. Ct. at 1407; see id. at 1407–08\n(approving of the notion that “ ‘“humanizing” the defendant\n. . . may be the wrong tactic in some cases because\nexperienced lawyers conclude that the [sentencing authority]\nsimply won’t buy it’” (quoting Pinholster, 590 F.3d at 692\n(Kozinski, C.J., dissenting)).\n\n    Because Sattler’s actions reflect a deliberate choice of\nreasonable strategy, they do not fall outside reasonable\n\f30                      MILES V .

Indeed, the\ndissent here appears to be making the same argument made\nby the dissent in Pinholster, an argument that was necessarily\nrejected by a majority of the Court. See id. at 1427\n(Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (“In reaching this conclusion, the\nmajority commits the same Strickland error that we corrected,\napplying § 2254(d)(1), in Wiggins: It holds a purportedly\n‘tactical judgment’ to be reasonable without assessing ‘the\nadequacy of the investigatio[n] supporting [that]\njudgmen[t].’” (alterations in original) (quoting Wiggins,\n539 U.S. at 521)).\n\n    Further, to the extent that the dissent finds support in\nPorter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1756\"><a href=\"/opinion/1756/porter-v-mccollum/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Porter\nheld that the defendant “may have been fatalistic or\nuncooperative, but that [did] not obviate the need for defense\ncounsel to conduct some sort of mitigation investigation.”\nPorter, 130 S. Ct. at 453. In Porter, counsel failed to conduct\nany investigation into the defendant’s background—he did\nnot interview any witnesses or request any records. Id.

Porter, therefore, is inapplicable here.\n\n    But even if Sattler’s performance had been deficient,\nPetitioner suffered no prejudice. As with Petitioner’s claim\nregarding Sattler’s expert, the state court made no prejudice\nfinding on the failure to investigate claim, so we must review\nprejudice de novo. That review is not subject to the\nevidentiary limitations announced in Pinholster, though it is\nsubject to the limitations in § 2254(e)(2). See Pinholster,\n131 S.

At a minimum, therefore, § 2254(e)(2) still\nrestricts the discretion of federal habeas courts to consider\nnew evidence when deciding claims that were not adjudicated\non the merits in state court.”). But even assuming that\n§ 2254(e)(2) permits us to consider the new evidence that\nPetitioner produced at the district court,16 we see no\nprejudice.\n\n\n\n  16\n     Even under review de novo and § 2254(e)(2), however, we do not\nconsider the new evidence produced on appeal in connection with the\nsupplemental briefing on the Martinez issue discussed below.

Thus,\neven if Sattler had been professionally deficient in failing to\ninvestigate and present these additional facts, it is not\nreasonably probable that the outcome of the\naggravation/mitigation balancing would have been different.\nIndeed, the new evidence does little to dispel Petitioner’s\nlater social history, in which he acted as a functioning\nmember of society for a number of years, demonstrating a\ncapacity to overcome the hardships that had burdened his\nyouth.\n\n    Accordingly, the failure-to-investigate portion of\nPetitioner’s ineffective assistance claims fails on the first\nprong of Strickland, applying AEDPA deference. We note,\nhowever, that Petitioner’s claim would fail on the first prong\neven under de novo review.

He had the assistance\nof counsel in his post-conviction relief proceeding, and\ncounsel raised a claim of ineffective assistance of trial\ncounsel. Assuming that Martinez applies in that situation, its\nexception is available only if Petitioner can establish that his\npost-conviction counsel was ineffective under the Strickland\nstandard and that the “underlying ineffective-assistance-of-\ntrial-counsel claim is a substantial one, which is to say that\n. . . the claim has some merit.” 132 S.

Even if we allowed\nPetitioner to raise this argument, he could gain nothing more than review\nde novo under the Strickland standard, which is itself deferential. See\nFrantz, 533 F.3d at 737 (holding that, when “§ 2254(d)(1) is satisfied,\nthen federal habeas courts must review the substantive constitutionality of\nthe state custody de novo”).

As detailed above, his counsel conducted an\nextensive investigation during post-conviction review,\nobtaining a psychologist to perform further testing and hiring\nan investigator who visited Petitioner’s home town and\ninterviewed many people who knew him and his mother.\nAccordingly, Petitioner cannot demonstrate that his post-\nconviction counsel was ineffective.\n\n    Furthermore, even with new evidence relating to his\nsocial history and drug use, Petitioner cannot rescue the claim\nthat his sentencing counsel was ineffective. As we have\nalready discussed, sentencing counsel made a reasonable\nchoice, as a matter of strategy, not to focus on social history\nand addiction, opting instead to paint Petitioner as a normal\nperson who made a grave mistake during a tumultuous period\nin his life. Petitioner’s new evidence does not establish that\nthis choice was unreasonable.\n\n   In summary, even assuming that the Martinez exception\napplies to Petitioner’s case, he cannot satisfy its requirements.\n\n                       CONCLUSION\n\n    Petitioner’s counsel adopted a permissible sentencing\nstrategy to show: (1) that Petitioner was a nice young man\nwho went with bad companions because he was depressed,\nwho may have been intoxicated at the time of the crime, who\nwas remorseful, and who was worth saving through\nrehabilitation; and (2) that he was just a very minor\nparticipant in the crime who was surprised by the violent turn\nof events.

In rejecting this claim, the state court\napplied Strickland in a way inconsistent with the holdings of\nseveral Supreme Court cases.

In contrast, the\nCourt has explained, a defendant’s active obstruction of\ncounsel’s efforts to perform a mitigation investigation can\nprevent him from showing prejudice under Strickland. See\nSchriro v.

Except in\nthat circumstance, the Court has recognized, a competent\nattorney would independently seek mitigation evidence rather\nthan rely on the defendant’s representations about his past.\n\n    Moreover, the ABA Guidelines in effect at the time of\nMiles’s sentencing specified that “[t]he investigation for the\npreparation of the sentencing phase should be conducted\nregardless of any initial assertion by the client that mitigation\nis not to be offered.” See ABA Guidelines for the\n\f40                      MILES V .

But then, as evidenced by the\npassages quoted above, the court did not apply that standard\nin accord with clearly established Supreme Court precedents\nwhen evaluating the substance of Miles’s claim as it related\nto Sattler’s investigation of his background.

My argument is not that we should\napply a bright-line rule when evaluating the performance of\ncounsel; my argument is that the Arizona Superior Court\nerred by doing just that, treating the evaluation of Miles’s\nStrickland claim as if it turned entirely on the fact that he\ncould have told his lawyer about his childhood but did not do\nso. The Arizona Superior Court’s flat statement that “an\nattorney should be able to rely on his/her client to bring\npertinent facts to his/her attention” is thus squarely\ninconsistent with clearly established Supreme Court law.\nMiles’s claim should therefore be reviewed de novo.\n\n   B. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n    In evaluating the merits of Miles’s ineffective assistance\nof counsel claim, I begin by comparing with some clarity and\ndepth the facts about Miles’s background known to Sattler\nbefore the sentencing hearing and the facts that came to light\nduring his state habeas proceedings.\n\n    The record paints a fairly clear picture of what Sattler\nknew about Miles’s background before his sentencing.\nViewed next to what came out later, it wasn’t much. In a\ndetailed letter to Dr. Levy, Sattler wrote that Miles was\nadopted when he was two months old, and that “all the\ninformation I have received about [Miles’s adoptive mother]\nindicates that she was very devoted to Kevin and worked very\nhard to give him material things as well as a great deal of love\n\f42                    MILES V . RYAN\n\nand affection.” Sattler notes that Miles moved to Winslow\nwith his adoptive mother when he was young and then\ndiscusses his high school years, indicating that he was “well\nliked,” “active in student activities,” and that “there was\nnever any incidence of violence in his school years that\nanyone is aware of.” The information about Miles’s pre-high\nschool life takes up one paragraph in the letter.\n\n    After interviewing Miles, Dr. Levy wrote a letter to\nSattler in which he indicated that Miles’s adoptive mother\n“was a single parent who held a variety of jobs from\nprofessional to laborer,” and that her habit of frequently\nchanging jobs may have been due to alcoholism. Still, Dr.\nLevy says, Miles’s “early years were described as good ones\nand ‘pretty normal.’” The Presentence Report does not shed\nany additional light on Miles’s childhood, repeating the\nassertion that his mother was an alcoholic and that “she\ncooked, waited tables, and worked at a convenience store,\nbefore becoming a nursing home administrator.” The PSR\nalso notes that Miles had trouble fitting in because he was\nblack in a small Arizona town. This, then, was what Sattler\nknew of Miles’s childhood: that he was adopted at a young\nage and that his adoptive mother may have been an alcoholic,\nbut that she worked hard and provided him with an\nupbringing that was “pretty normal.”\n\n   The investigations conducted after Miles was sentenced,\nwhich resulted in a 33-page report prepared for his state\nhabeas proceedings, paint a very different picture, one rife\nwith drugs, prostitution, and violence. Miles’s adoptive\nmother, Lois, was married to a pimp named Alfred Miles,\nwho ran a bar, restaurant, and hotel in Tulsa called El\nRancho. Miles’s birth mother was one of Alfred’s prostitutes,\nand may have been a heroin addict. Both Lois and Miles’s\n\f                      MILES V . RYAN                       43\n\nbirth mother lived in rooms at the El Rancho. Lois was\nterrified of Alfred and often heard him beating Miles’s birth\nmother mercilessly, possibly while she was pregnant with\nMiles. Lois informally adopted Miles, and when he was two\nshe took him and fled to Arizona, settling in Winslow.\n\n    In Winslow, Lois met Jasper Renfro, who operated a bar\ncalled the Prairie Moon, which had rooms in the back that\nwere rented to prostitutes for $2.00. Lois began working\nthere as a prostitute and bartender, and moved into a two-\nbedroom house next door. Lois and Miles slept in one room,\nand prostitutes turned tricks in the other. When Lois had a\ncustomer, she would ask one of the other prostitutes to watch\nMiles while she was occupied. Lois drank heavily, and\nalthough her fellow prostitutes insisted that none of them\nused drugs, a Winslow police officer who was interviewed\nonce found heroin at the house and recalled that the women\nthere were “all drug addicts.”\n\n    Kevin Hernandez, who was Miles’s age and grew up on\nthe same block, remembered looking over the fence that faced\nthe alley behind the Prairie Moon and seeing prostitutes\nhaving sex. He also remembered hearing gunfire on\nweekends. At one point during Lois and Miles’s time at the\nhouse, “a girl named Charmaine shot an Indian at the house.\nThe police followed the blood trail to the front door and tore\nthe house apart looking for the gun.\n\n    When Miles was around 7, he and Lois moved to another\nhouse a few blocks away from the Prairie Moon. A prostitute\nnamed Connie, who lived with Lois and Miles next to the\nPrairie Moon and was also a heroin addict, was shot and\nkilled about a year after Lois and Miles moved to their nearby\nhouse. Lois was trying to turn her life around at this point,\n\f44                      MILES V . RYAN\n\nand took a job as a cook, although she may have continued\nworking as a prostitute (her boss was a “known pimp,”\naccording to the investigator’s report, and she occasionally\nleft Miles alone at the restaurant). 1979, when Miles was\naround 11, Lois got a job as a dietary aide at a convalescent\ncenter. She worked there for seven years, rising to become\nthe administrator before being fired for drinking on the job\nthe same year Miles graduated from high school. Lois and\nMiles slept in the same bed until he was 14.\n\n        1. Deficient Performance\n\n     The majority views Sattler’s decision not to further\ninvestigate Miles’s background as reasonable in light of her\nstrategic decision to present Miles as a fundamentally normal\nperson who had a viable chance of being rehabilitated if\nspared execution. While the Supreme Court has instructed us\nto treat with deference the strategic decisions of counsel, see,\ne.g., Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1407–08, it is hard to see how\nSattler could have made a reasonable strategic choice not to\npresent the harrowing details of Miles’s childhood when she\nknew virtually nothing about what that childhood was like.\nTreating this strategic decision as determinative introduces an\nelement of circularity into the analysis: Sattler’s choice not to\nlearn about Miles’s childhood was reasonable because it was\npart of her strategy, which she adopted because she knew\nnothing about Miles’s childhood. As the Supreme Court has\nobserved, “counsel’s failure to uncover and present\nvoluminous mitigating evidence at sentencing [cannot] be\njustified as a tactical decision . . . [where] counsel had not\n‘fulfilled their obligation to conduct a thorough investigation\nof the defendant’s background.’” Wiggins v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130159\"><a href=\"/opinion/130159/wiggins-v-smith-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 523 (2003) (quoting Williams, 529 U.S. at 396). In other\nwords, a strategic choice is only reasonable to the extent that\n\f                           MILES V . RYAN                              45\n\n“the investigation supporting [that choice] . . . was itself\nreasonable.” Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 523 (emphasis in\noriginal). The relevant question, then, is whether Sattler’s\ninvestigation “fell below an objective standard of\nreasonableness. . . . under prevailing professional norms.”\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 688.\n\n    Sattler’s efforts to investigate Miles’s background fell\nbelow prevailing professional norms. Sattler did work with\nan investigator in preparation for trial, but that investigator\nwas not trained in investigating homicide cases or conducting\nmitigation investigations. Sattler’s letters to the investigator\nshow that Sattler was focused on finding people in Tucson\nwho might know something about the crime, rather than on\nfinding information about Miles’s background.\n\n    Sattler did ask the investigator to interview four people\nfrom Winslow. Of these, the investigator spoke to three high\nschool friends who knew nothing of Miles’s earlier\nchildhood. The investigator submitted the fruits of these\ninterviews to Sattler in two “interview reports,” each a single\npage, and no formal background report was prepared. The\ninvestigator never traveled to Winslow. When she was\ndeposed in connection with Miles’s federal habeas petition,2\nthe investigator had no recollection of Miles’s name or of her\nwork on the case, and, looking over the record, she expressed\nsurprise at how little information her investigation produced.\nAlthough Sattler knew that Miles had been adopted at an\nearly age and that his mother was an alcoholic who had\n\n\n 2\n   Because AEDPA deference does not apply to the state court’s rejection\nof Miles’s Strickland claim, Pinholster does not prevent consideration of\nevidence that was before the district court under § 2254(e)(2).

The ABA guidelines in effect at\nthe time made clear that “[t]he investigation for preparation\nof the sentencing phase . . . should comprise efforts to\ndiscover all reasonably available mitigating evidence.” ABA\nGuidelines 11.4.1(C). Thus, under the prevailing professional\nnorms at the time of Miles’s sentencing, “counsel had an\n‘obligation to conduct a thorough investigation of the\ndefendant’s backrgound.’” Porter, 130 S. Ct. at 452 (quoting\nWilliams v.

As in Porter, Sattler “ignored pertinent\navenues for investigation of which [she] should have been\naware,” 130 S. Ct. at 453, i.e., Miles’s life up until he entered\nhigh school. As in Wiggins, Sattler “abandoned [her]\ninvestigation of [Miles’s] background after having acquired\nonly rudimentary knowledge of his history from a narrow set\nof sources.” 539 U.S. at 524. In Wiggins, those sources\nincluded psychological tests, records from the Department of\nSocial Services documenting petitioner’s time in the foster\nsystem, and a one page account of petitioner’s personal\nhistory contained in the presentence report. The materials\navailable to Sattler were considerably more scant. She did\nnot ask Dr. Levy to conduct any psychological tests, and she\nobtained no comparable government records concerning\nMiles’s childhood.\n\f                       MILES V .

After all, Miles may not have even\nremembered some of the circumstances of his early life, yet\n“early childhood trauma, even if it is not consciously\nremembered, may have ‘catastrophic and permanent effects\non those who . . . survive it.’” James v.

Prejudice\n\n    The majority characterizes the additional information\nabout Miles’s childhood that came to light after his\nsentencing as “largely cumulative” of what was before the\nsentencing judge, and concludes that even if Sattler’s\nrepresentation was not constitutionally deficient, there was no\n“reasonable probability that, but for [Sattler’s] unprofessional\nerrors, the result of the proceeding would have been\ndifferent.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694. I cannot agree.\n\n   It is worth remembering how little of Miles’s pre-high\nschool life was in the record when he was sentenced. The\n\f48                    MILES V . RYAN\n\nPSR contains two paragraphs of social history, and has this to\nsay about Miles’s childhood:\n\n       The defendant reported his adoptive mother\n       was an alcoholic. She cooked, waited tables,\n       and worked at a convenience store, before\n       becoming a nursing home administrator. He\n       reported he was not accepted by everyone\n       because he was black, and his mother was\n       white. He also indicate[d] he experienced\n       ‘culture shock’ when he and his mother\n       moved into a more affluent neighborhood and\n       attended a better school.\n\nDr. Levy’s report, which was also before the sentencing\njudge, indicates that Miles’s mother was an alcoholic and that\nracism was an issue for him, but notes that “his early years\nwere described as good ones and ‘pretty normal.’” These\nbrief summaries are, to put it mildly, a far cry from the\ninformation that came to light later, which showed that both\nMiles’s birth and adoptive mothers were prostitutes, that\nMiles’s birth mother was a heroin addict and may have been\nbeaten by her pimp while she was pregnant with him, and that\nMiles spent his early years living in a two bedroom brothel,\nsurrounded by prostitution, heroin use, alcohol abuse,\nshootings, and even murder. To call this childhood anywhere\nnear “pretty normal” is strange indeed. The difference\nbetween these two narratives is one of kind, not degree.\n\n    I also cannot accept the majority’s view that this\nmitigation evidence is far milder than that in James v. Ryan,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">679</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">780</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. As in James, Miles survived a childhood rife\nwith violence, drug use, and crime. While there is no\nindication that Miles was, like James, physically abused,\n\f                       MILES V . RYAN                       49\n\nJames was not raised by prostitutes, nor was his childhood\nhome the scene of murders and shootings. For, contrary to\nthe majority’s account, James did not “grow up” in the\nabusive circumstances described. Instead, at age four, James\nwas adopted by parents who were strict but loving, and his\nlife circumstances from thence forward took a dramatic turn\nfor the better. Id. at 812. Miles saw his situation improve\nsomewhat as he aged, but he and his mother didn’t move out\nof the house next to the Prairie Moon until he was seven, and\nhis mother may have continued to work as a prostitute until\nhe was 11. They slept in the same bed until he was 14. My\npoint here is not to downplay the horrors faced by the young\nJames, but to suggest that he and Miles survived conditions\nthat were far more comparable than the majority lets on.\n\n    The relevant question, at any rate, is not whether Miles’s\nstory is better or worse than any of the sad tales that have\ngraced the pages of the Federal Reporter, but whether there\nis a “reasonable probability” that he would not have been\nsentenced to death had it been told. See Strickland, 466 U.S.\nat 694. Notably, “it is not necessary for the habeas petitioner\nto demonstrate that the newly presented mitigation evidence\nwould necessarily overcome the aggravating circumstances.”\nCorrell v. Ryan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1427464\"><a href=\"/opinion/1427464/correll-v-ryan/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">938</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 951–52 (9th Cir. 2008). What\nis required “is a probability sufficient to undermine\nconfidence in the outcome.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694. In\nanalyzing whether the new mitigation evidence creates the\nrequired “reasonable probability,” Strickland instructs us to\nconsider whether “the omitted evidence would have changed\nthe conclusion that the aggravating circumstances outweighed\nthe mitigating circumstances.” Id. at 700.\n\n    Applying this framework shows that Miles suffered\nprejudice due to Sattler’s deficient performance. The\n\f50                       MILES V . RYAN\n\naggravating factors established at sentencing were not\noverwhelming: The judge relied on four, one of which was\nlater overturned by the Arizona Supreme Court. The other\nthree were based on (1) Miles’s three armed robberies, (2) the\nprofit motive behind Miles’s participation in the crime, and\n(3) the “especially cruel manner” in which the murder was\ncommitted, a finding based on the fear suffered by Baeuerlen\nduring the twenty minute drive out to the desert. Against\nthese aggravating factors, the judge considered and rejected\na variety of statutory and non-statutory mitigating factors.\nWhile the judge mentioned that he had received numerous\nletters attesting to Miles’s previously non-violent nature, he\ndiscounted the letters as irrelevant when considering the\nviolent felon before him. There was no mention of Miles’s\nchildhood.\n\n    Given the weakness of the aggravating factors and the\ntotal absence of any mention of Miles’s childhood in the\njudge’s sentencing, the additional mitigating evidence Sattler\ncould have uncovered is sufficient to “undermine confidence\nin the outcome.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694. “[A] penalty\nphase ineffective assistance claim depends on the magnitude\nof the discrepancy between what counsel did investigate and\npresent and what counsel could have investigated and\npresented.” Stankewitz v. Woodford, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785907\"><a href=\"/opinion/785907/douglas-ray-stankewitz-v-jeanne-s-woodford-warden-san-quentin-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 716 (9th\nCir. 2004). Here, that discrepancy was substantial. As in\nWilliams, “the graphic description of [Miles’s] childhood . . .\nmight well have influenced the [judge’s] appraisal of his\nmoral culpability.” 529 U.S. at 398.3\n\n\n\n  3\n     Because I would reverse on the present record, I do not address\nwhether Martinez v. Ryan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"625711\"><a href=\"/opinion/625711/martinez-v-ryan/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1309</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2012), allows Miles to\nintroduce new facts at this stage.\n\f                       MILES V . RYAN                       51\n\n   C. Conclusion\n\n    Reviewing Miles’s claim de novo, it is clear that Sattler’s\nperformance was deficient, and that Miles was prejudiced by\nthat deficiency. Sattler could not have reasonably chosen the\nparticular strategy she decided upon without first making a\nreasonable investigation into Miles’s past, and the\nsignificance of the missing information is sufficient to\nundermine my confidence that Miles would nevertheless have\nbeen sentenced to death. I therefore dissent.\n\f</pre>",
