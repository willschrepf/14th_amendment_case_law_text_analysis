W.L.L. (Gulf Group), in the United States Court of\nFederal Claims.1 The cases arise from four awards to Gulf Group by the United States\nArmy in 2004. In the lead case, Case No. 06-835C (the camp package BPA case), Gulf\n\n1\n  The original complaints were filed as follows: Case No. 06-835C, the camp package\nblanket purchase agreement (BPA) case was filed on December 8, 2006; Case No. 06-\n858C, the latrine case, was filed on December 15, 2006; Case No. 06-853C, the\n\fGroup alleges that the government’s termination of its BPA call under a general\nservices contract was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion. Gulf Group also\nalleges that the camp package BPA call termination was made in bad faith.2 In Case\nNo. 06-858C (the latrine case), Gulf Group alleges that the government’s termination of\nits contract to supply latrines to Camp Arifjan in Kuwait was arbitrary, capricious, and an\nabuse of discretion. Gulf Group also alleges that the latrine contract termination was\nmade in bad faith. In Case No. 06-853C (the dumpster case), Gulf Group alleges that\nthe government’s termination of its contract to supply dumpsters to Camp Arifjan in\nKuwait was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion. Gulf Group also alleges\nthat the termination of the dumpster contract was made in bad faith. In Case No. 07-\n82C (the bottled water BPA case), Gulf Group alleges that the government’s\nrequirement that it travel in military convoys to deliver bottled water to base camps in\nIraq and Kuwait3 and on return trips resulted in significant delays, as a result of which\nplaintiff incurred additional costs. Gulf Group contends that the government breached\nits duty of good faith and fair dealing in delaying plaintiff’s delivery of bottled water and\nthat, because of the breach, the government is responsible for demurrage expenses.\n\ndumpster case, was filed on December 19, 2006; Case No. 07-82C, the bottled water\nBPA case, was filed on February 1, 2007. The cases were consolidated on August 28,\n2008. The complaints in each case, however, have been amended multiple times, with\nthe final amendment in the camp package BPA case dated May 6, 2011, the final\namendment in the latrine case dated February 25, 2011, the final amendment in the\ndumpster case dated February 25, 2011, and the final amendment in the bottled water\nBPA case dated February 25, 2011. Some of the cases were stayed pending decisions\nof the contracting officer. Subsequently, the second amended complaints in the camp\npackage BPA case, latrine case, and dumpster case raised allegations of abuse of\ndiscretion and bad faith on the part of the United States. The cases also were stayed\nfor a considerable period of time at the request of defendant to accommodate ongoing\ncriminal investigations and prosecutions, which are addressed more fully below.\n2\n  Although plaintiff alleged bad faith in the second amended complaints in the camp\npackage BPA case, the latrine case, and the dumpster case, plaintiff subsequently\ndropped all allegations concerning bad faith in each of the cases in which it originally\nwas raised. As confirmed in an April 22, 2011 Order issued by this court, “[i]n a\nconference the court held with the parties on April 8, 2011, plaintiff’s counsel advised\nthe court that, upon reflection, counsel does not wish to pursue a bad faith claim on the\npart of the government, but that plaintiff’s counsel intends to proceed with the allegation\nthat government officials acted arbitrarily and capriciously with respect to the\ncancellation of Gulf Group’s contract.” Thereafter, in its third amended complaint in\nCase No. 06-835C (the camp package BPA), filed on May 6, 2011, plaintiff dropped its\nbad faith claim against the government. Plaintiff reiterated at closing argument, “there is\nno bad faith claim in any one of these four cases, 06-835, 06-858, 06-853, and 07-082.”\n3\n  The court notes that the bottled water BPA statement of work states that water was to\nbe delivered to camps in Kuwait, whereas the “Special Instructions” in the bottled water\nBPA, discussed more fully below, indicate that water was to be delivered in Kuwait and\nIraq.\n\n                                             2\n\f       The government filed counterclaims and affirmative defenses in each of the four\nconsolidated cases. Regarding the camp package BPA case, Case No. 06-835C,\ndefendant alleges violations of the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3729 (2000),\namended by Fraud Enforcement & Recovery Act of 2009 (FERA), Pub. L. No. 111–21,\n123 Stat. 1617,4 the Contract Disputes Act, 41 U.S.C. § 604 (2000) (current version at\n41 U.S.C. § 7103(c)(2) (Supp. V 2011)), and the Special Plea in Fraud statute, 28\nU.S.C. § 2514 (2000).5 Defendant seeks forfeiture of plaintiff’s entire camp package\nBPA claim under the Special Plea in Fraud statute, damages in the amount of plaintiff’s\nunsupported claim, as well as defendant’s cost of reviewing plaintiff’s alleged false claim\nunder the Contract Disputes Act, and treble damages and allowable civil penalties\nunder the False Claims Act. Defendant also seeks rescission of the calls issued under\nthe camp package BPA, which the government alleges were obtained by plaintiff\nthrough bribery, conflict of interest, and fraud, and defendant seeks disgorgement of all\nmonies the United States paid for calls issued under the camp package BPA, plus\ncosts.\n\n       In the latrine case, Case No. 06-858C, defendant alleges violations of the False\nClaims Act, the Contract Disputes Act, and the Special Plea in Fraud statute.\nDefendant seeks forfeiture of plaintiff’s entire claim under the Special Plea in Fraud\nstatute, damages in the amount of plaintiff’s unsupported claim, as well as defendant’s\ncost of reviewing plaintiff’s allegedly false claim under the Contract Disputes Act, and\nallowable civil penalties under the False Claims Act, plus costs. Although defendant\nargues that the latrine contract also was tainted by bribery, conflict of interest, and\nfraud, defendant does not seek rescission of the latrine contract.\n\n        In the dumpster case, Case No. 06-853C, defendant alleges violations of the\nFalse Claims Act, the Contract Disputes Act, and the Special Plea in Fraud statute. As\nin the latrine case, defendant seeks forfeiture of plaintiff’s entire claim under the Special\nPlea in Fraud statute, damages in the amount of plaintiff’s unsupported claim, as well as\ndefendant’s cost of reviewing plaintiff’s allegedly false claim under the Contract\nDisputes Act, and allowable civil penalties under the False Claims Act, plus costs. As in\nthe latrine case, although defendant argues that the dumpster contract was tainted by\nbribery, conflict of interest, and fraud, defendant does not seek rescission of the\ndumpster contract.\n4\n  The 2009 amendments to the False Claims Act apply retroactively to claims pending\non or after June 7, 2008. See United States ex rel. Bennett v. Medtronic, Inc., 747 F.\nSupp. 2d 745, 762-63 (S.D. Tex. 2010). Although the amended version of the False\nClaims Act could potentially apply to a submission that plaintiff made in 2011, the court\nrefers to the previous version of the False Claims Act because, as indicated below,\nplaintiff’s conduct in 2011 does not implicate liability under the False Claims Act.\n5\n  The court notes that some courts refer to the Special Plea in Fraud statute as the\n“Forfeiture of Fraudulent Claims Act” or “FFCA.” See, e.g., Ulysses, Inc. v. United\nStates, 110 Fed. Cl. 618, 648 (2013); Grand Acadian, Inc. v. United States, 105 Fed. Cl.\n447, 458, appeal dismissed (Fed. Cir. 2012).\n\n                                             3\n\f       As to the bottled water BPA case, Case No. 07-82C, defendant alleges violations\nof the False Claims Act, the Contract Disputes Act, and the Special Plea in Fraud\nstatute. As in the camp package BPA case, defendant seeks forfeiture of plaintiff’s\nentire claim under the Special Plea in Fraud statute, damages in the amount of plaintiff’s\nunsupported claim and the cost of reviewing plaintiff’s allegedly false claim under the\nContract Disputes Act, and treble damages, as well as allowable civil penalties under\nthe False Claims Act. Defendant also seeks rescission of the BPA calls, which\ndefendant alleges were obtained by plaintiff through bribery, conflict of interest, and\nfraud, and seeks disgorgement of all monies the United States paid for calls issued\nunder the bottled water BPA, plus costs.\n\n        Pursuant to the False Claims Act, the government alleges that Gulf Group\nknowingly submitted false or fraudulent claims to the government on the camp package\nBPA, the latrine contract, the dumpster contract, and the bottled water BPA. Regarding\nthe camp package BPA, defendant claims that plaintiff violated the False Claims Act in\nsubmitting invoices for a call issued under the camp package BPA and in submitting to\nthe government its claims for monies due because the award of the camp package BPA\nwas tainted by bribery, plaintiff inflated the amount of its claims relating to BPA call\n00016 for services and supplies it had not rendered, and plaintiff supported at least one\nof its claims with an invoice for services rendered by another government contractor,\nGreen Valley Company (Green Valley).7 According to defendant, plaintiff also inflated\n6\n Camp package BPA call 0001 was issued pursuant to the camp package BPA on\nSeptember 30, 2004, for items covered by the camp package BPA for Camp Buehring.\n7\n  The parties stipulated that, “[o]n September 28, 2004, Gulf Group and Green Valley\nentered into a joint venture agreement to perform certain contracts,” including for\nsupplies and equipment and other necessary expenses, under which Suresh Pulikkal, a\nlegal consultant for Gulf Telecom, a wholly owned subsidiary of Gulf Group, and other\ncompanies in the region, was given power of attorney to act for Green Valley. Saud Al\nTawash, the General Manager of Gulf Group, testified that, to the best of his\nrecollection, Gulf Group did not perform any projects with Green Valley under the brief\njoint venture agreement between the two companies. Saud Al Tawash also testified,\nhowever, that Gulf Group had contacted Green Valley in connection with securing\nequipment to perform under the camp package BPA call for Camp Buehring. Palm\nSprings General Trading and Contracting Establishment (Palm Springs), a separate\ncompany established by Saud Al Tawash, apparently also had a joint venture with\nGreen Valley. Saud Al Tawash testified that, although Palm Springs and Green Valley\nhad worked together on a project, he terminated the joint venture between Palm Springs\nand Green Valley shortly after a December 2004 meeting about waste management\nfraud perpetrated by Green Valley employees. Saud Al Tawash testified that\ngovernment personnel were confused about the relationship between Palm Springs and\nGreen Valley and a contract performed by the two companies was modified in an\nattempt to clarify the confusion. When asked about the relationship between Palm\nSprings and Green Valley, Saud Al Tawash offered the following testimony:\n\n\n                                            4\n\fthe amount of its latrine and dumpster contract claims for services and supplies it did\nnot render, inflated the amount due on its claims for demurrage under the bottled water\nBPA, and obtained the bottled water BPA, and latrine and dumpster contracts through\nbribery.\n\n        Pursuant to the Contracts Disputes Act, defendant alleges that Gulf Group\ncannot support the monetary claims submitted in the above-captioned cases due to\nmisrepresentation of fact or fraud. In each case, defendant asserts that plaintiff\nsubmitted a claim for an amount significantly greater than the contract or BPA call price.\nAs to the camp package BPA, defendant contends that plaintiff claimed $4,544,339.84,8\nalthough BPA call 0001 was only for $1,447,457.22, the call was only twelve days into\nperformance when it was terminated, and as with the False Claims Act allegations,\nplaintiff supported its claim with an invoice from Green Valley. Under the latrine\ncontract, defendant alleges that plaintiff claimed $4,558,428.60, although the contract\nwas only for $613,142.86, the contract was terminated after twenty days of\nperformance, and the contract was obtained through bribery. Defendant also alleges\nthat plaintiff certified entitlement to $999,994.67 under the dumpster contract, although\nthe contract was only for $346,998.00, the contract was terminated thirty-two days into\nthe performance period, and the contract was tainted by bribery. Defendant further\nargues that plaintiff claimed $1,065,711.39 for demurrage under the bottled water BPA,\nalthough its documented demurrage charges do not total $1,065,711.39. Defendant\nalso alleges that the bottled water BPA was obtained through bribery. Therefore,\ndefendant contends, plaintiff must pay the government the amount of money it has\nclaimed which is unsupported, plus the government’s costs generated in reviewing the\nclaims.\n\n     Pursuant to the Special Plea in Fraud statute, asserted in Case No. 06-835C, the\ncamp package BPA case, Case No. 06-858C, the latrine case, Case No. 06-853C, the\ndumpster case, and Case No. 07-82C, the bottled water BPA case, the government\n\n      Q: So these [Palm Springs and Green Valley] are two completely separate\n      companies?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\n      Q: There’s no comingling of funds, there’s no joint employees, there’s\n      nothing that is in common to each other?\n\n      A: If Green Valley was my company why would I ask for a modification on\n      this contract?\n\n      Q: Why would you even need a joint venture?\n\n      A: Why would I need a joint venture, right.\n8\n The parties have, by stipulation, generally converted Kuwaiti dinars (KD) into United\nStates dollars (USD) using a 1:3.571 rate throughout their pleadings.\n\n                                            5\n\falleges that the contracts and BPA calls were awarded in exchange for “money, trips,\nand other things of value” given by Gulf Group to Carolyn Blake, the sister of John\nCockerham, a former Army Major, contract specialist, and contracting officer at Camp\nArifjan, Kuwait, who was involved in the award, and terminations, of some of Gulf\nGroup’s contracts. Defendant asserts that Gulf Group’s actions constitute fraud under\nthe Special Plea in Fraud statute, requiring forfeiture of plaintiff’s claims, as Gulf\nGroup’s actions created an unlawful conflict of interest and violated 18 U.S.C.\n§ 201(b)(1) (2000), which prohibits the offering or promising of anything of value to a\npublic official with the intent to influence an official act. Defendant further alleges that\nGulf Group violated the Special Plea in Fraud statute by submitting false claims under\neach contract and BPA call to the United States government for an amount of money “to\nwhich it knew or knows it was not entitled.” Defendant also contends that Gulf Group’s\ncamp package and bottled water BPAs were void from the beginning, because they\nwere tainted by bribery, conflict of interest, and fraud, entitling the government to the\nrescission of the calls and the disgorgement of all amounts paid to Gulf Group under the\ncalls issued for the BPAs.\n\nContract Awards\n\n       Gulf Group is owned by members of the Al Tawash family, including Saud Al\nTawash. Saud Al Tawash, a Kuwaiti citizen, was the General Manager and one of the\ndirectors of Gulf Group in 2004 and 2005, the time period pertinent to the contracts and\nBPAs at issue. Saud Al Tawash also was the Managing Director of Gulf Telecom,\nwhich employed Ms. Blake. Saud Al Tawash was the primary point of contact for the\nUnited States for both Gulf Group and Gulf Telecom.\n\n       On September 30, 2004, Maj. Gloria Davis,9 who was at the time the chief of\nArmy contracting at Camp Arifjan, awarded the camp package BPA to Gulf Group. The\nparties stipulated that the camp package BPA, W912D1-04-A-0047, called for “the\nprovision of tent packages, portable latrines, light sets, bulk water, dumpsters, and\ngenerators for use in Kuwait.” The period of performance on the camp package BPA\nwas September 30, 200410 through September 30, 2006, with a BPA master dollar limit\nof $10,000,000.00, and a BPA call limit of $7,000,000.00. On September 30, 2004, Maj.\n9\n  On December 12, 2006, after speaking with the Army’s Criminal Investigation Division\n(CID) at Camp Victory, Maj. Davis committed suicide. The Wall Street Journal reported\nthat “[o]n December 11, 2006, CID agents met Maj. Davis at Camp Victory in Baghdad’s\nGreen Zone to ask about $225,000 found in her offshore accounts. Sometime after\nmidnight, the CID investigators escorted Maj. Davis to her quarters, agreeing to resume\ndebriefing the next morning. Before dawn, she used her own sidearm to commit\nsuicide.”\n10\n   There is a slight discrepancy in the camp package BPA as to the period of\nperformance. In one section, the camp package BPA states the period of performance\nbegins on September 30, 2004, but in another section, the camp package BPA states\nthat the period of performance begins on October 1, 2004.\n\n\n                                             6\n\fDavis issued call No. 0001 for Camp Buehring pursuant to the master camp package\nBPA in the amount of $1,447,457.22, with a period of performance from December 15,\n2004 through June 15, 2005. Maj. Davis modified the camp package BPA call twice on\nSeptember 30, 2004, under Modification No. 101 and Modification No. 102.\n\n        John Cockerham was on the Contract Review Board that recommended award of\nthe camp package BPA to Gulf Group, but he was not the contract specialist or the\ncontracting officer. The parties stipulated that “Mr. Cockerham was employed by the\nDepartment of Defense (‘DoD’) as a Major in the Army attached to the Army Contracting\nActivity, Fort Sam Houston Army Post, San Antonio, Texas, from on or about June\n2004, until on or about July 2007.” The parties also stipulated: “From on or about June\n30, 2004, through late December 2005, Mr. Cockerham was deployed to Camp Arifjan,\nKuwait, first as a contract specialist and then as a contracting officer upon obtaining a\ncontracting warrant,” initially for five million dollars. Mr. Cockerham reported to Col.\nJohn Hess, the Director of Contracting at Camp Arifjan in Kuwait. Mr. Cockerham was\nresponsible for soliciting and reviewing bids for Department of Defense contracts in\nsupport of Army operations in the Middle East, and was authorized to award contracts\nafter receipt of his contracting warrant in October 2004. Mr. Cockerham has been\nconvicted of conspiracy, bribery, and money laundering in connection with his\nassignment in Kuwait. Mr. Cockerham is currently serving his prison sentence at a\nfederal facility in Texas. Mr. Cockerham was in federal custody when he testified at trial\nin the four above-captioned cases.\n\n        On September 28, 2004, Maj. Davis awarded Gulf Group a fixed-price contract\nfor the provision of latrines and latrine services at Camp Arifjan. The contract, W912D1-\n04-P-0932, required four hundred new latrines with daily cleaning services. Mr.\nCockerham was the contract specialist assigned to the contract award. Although Mr.\nCockerham was not a member of the Contract Review Board that recommended that\nthe latrine contract be awarded to Gulf Group, he signed the Contract Review Board’s\nContract Review Memorandum as the point of contact for the latrine contract. The base\nperiod of the latrine contract was listed as September 28, 2004 through January 21,\n2005, with additional option periods totaling twenty-nine months, which could have\ncaused the contract to be extended through early 2007. After a modification, the\ncontract price for the base period of the latrine contract was $613,142.86.11 The option\nperiods were priced at a combined $4,444,752.28.12 Thus, the total potential price of\nthe latrine contract was $5,057,895.14.\n11\n  The latrine contract indicates that the base period price of 171,680.000 KD was\nequivalent to $613,142.86, which is the figure that defendant cites in its briefs. Although\nan application of the conversion rate to which the parties have stipulated results in a\nbase period price of $613,069.28, the court uses the price that appears on the face of a\ncontract or call, rather than the conversion rate to which the parties have stipulated,\nwhen the contract or call provides a USD figure.\n12\n  The prices for the base and option periods are listed in the original contract in USD,\nbut a modification to the contract listed the prices for the base period in USD and KD,\nand for the option periods in KD. The KD numbers are calculated into USD in plaintiff’s\n\n                                            7\n\f      On September 20, 2004,13 Maj. Davis awarded a fixed-price contract, W912D1-\n04-P-0897, to Gulf Group for the provision of dumpsters and dumpster services at\nCamp Arifjan. Mr. Cockerham testified that he “thought” he was the contract specialist\nassigned during the award of the dumpster contract. Mr. Cockerham signed a Contract\nReview Board Memorandum as the point of contact for the dumpster contract, although\nhe was not a member of the Contract Review Board that recommended award of the\ndumpster contract to Gulf Group. The base period of the dumpster contract was listed\nas September 25, 2004 through March 24, 2005. There were five additional option\nperiods of six months each following the base period, which were available to extend\nthe contract through September 24, 2007. The price awarded for the base period of the\ndumpster contract was $346,998.00. The combined price of the option periods was\n$1,110,621.72.     Thus, the total potential price of the dumpster contract was\n$1,457,619.72.\n\n       On September 28, 2004, Maj. Davis awarded the bottled water BPA, W912D1-\n04-A-0052, to Gulf Group for the provision of bottled water. Although Mr. Cockerham,\nthe contract specialist, was not a warranted contracting officer at the time the BPA was\nawarded, and he was not a member of the Contract Review Board that reviewed the\naward of the bottled water BPA, his name appears next to the duty position “Contracting\nOfficer” in the Contract Review Board Memorandum. The base period of performance\nfor the bottled water BPA was September 28, 2004 through September 28, 2006. The\ncontract called for the supply and delivery of bottled water to locations in Kuwait and\nIraq. The BPA master dollar limit on the bottled water BPA was $10,000,000.00, and\nthe BPA call limit was $7,000,000.00. The performance period was extended to\nSeptember 7, 2008 by Modification P00001, which also deleted the original\n$10,000,000.00 BPA call limit. Modification P00001 was signed by Mr. Cockerham as\nthe contracting officer on December 20, 2005.\n\n       A number of separate incidents are relevant to understanding the events related\nto each of the contracts and BPAs at issue in the above-captioned cases. The parties\nstipulated that, subsequent to the award of the BPAs and contracts, “COL Patrick\n\nclaim. Defendant does not dispute plaintiff’s numbers and agrees that the correct base\nperiod price is represented by the USD and KD figures listed in the contract\nmodification. Therefore, the total, possible award for the latrine contract appears to\nhave been $5,057,895.14. In his decision on Gulf Group’s claim with respect to the\nlatrine contract, which is described below, contracting officer Joseph Libbey, a\nwarranted level-3, maximum level, contracting officer, stated that the price reflected on\nthe contract for the base period was inaccurate. The latrine contract, however, states\nthe price of each line item. The court, therefore, refers to the amounts listed on the face\nof the modification to the contract.\n13\n   According to the parties’ joint stipulation of facts, the dumpster contract was entered\ninto on September 26, 2004. This appears to be an error, however, as the contract\nperformance period is listed as starting on September 25, 2004, and the signatures on\nthe dumpster contract are both dated September 20, 2004.\n\n                                            8\n\fDardis, the ‘Camp Buehring Mayor,’ sent MAJ Robert McKinzie and MAJ Terry England\nto conduct a site visit of Gulf Group’s yard at Amgarah on or about October 6, 2004.”\nAccording to Saud Al Tawash and his brother, Megbel Al Tawash, a director of Gulf\nGroup, and Gulf Group’s Operations Manager in 2004 and 2005, the visit was\nconducted to inspect Gulf Group’s preparations for the camp package BPA. Saud Al\nTawash and Megbel Al Tawash testified that this first site visit was very quick and\nunannounced, and, although the inspectors “were not happy,” they did not explain their\nconcerns to Megbel Al Tawash, who had received them. Nevertheless, the government\nmoved up the period of performance of Gulf Group’s camp package BPA call for Camp\nBuehring from December 15, 2004 to November 15, 2004 due to a surge. A second\nsite visit was conducted on October 13, 2004, by Lt. Theodore Rivera, Capt. William\nTrimble, Jr., and Capt. Ryan N. Novak, who were assigned to the contracting office at\nCamp Arifjan. The purpose of the second site visit was to ensure that Gulf Group was\nprepared to carry out the camp package BPA call. Saud Al Tawash was present during\nthis second site visit, apparently conducted a day after the termination of the camp\npackage BPA call at issue, at which time he first learned that the date of the camp\npackage BPA call was being accelerated due to the surge. Bobby Wilson, Gulf Group’s\nProject Manager in Kuwait, also was present during this second inspection and\nindicated that the contracting office inspectors were satisfied with their review.\nRegarding the second site visit, defendant’s October 20, 2004 Memorandum for the\nRecord14 on the subject of “Gulf Group Cancellation” states:\n\n      During the site visit, the government was able to evaluate the Gulf Group’s\n      capabilities of meeting the surge. All the equipment (dumpsters, latrines,\n      generators) on site was brand new and Saud [sic] Tawash (General\n      Manager) produced copies of the purchase orders for the fire-retardant\n      tents. Saud informed the CO’s [contracting officers] that he currently has\n      a contract at Camp Arifjan supplying dumpsters and latrines. The CO’s\n      believed Gulf Group were [sic] able to do the job and do the job well. Gulf\n      Group had the technical and logistical expertise, manpower, material, and\n      equipment, and it was our firm recommendation to allow Gulf Group to\n      continue with this contract.... On 14 Oct 2004, the 3 CO’s arranged a\n      meeting with Major Cockerham and Mr. Tijani to meet GG [Gulf Group].\n      Prior to meeting with GG, the government personnel discussed GG’s\n      capabilities.... He blessed their capabilities and informed the CO’s he\n      would follow up with Lt. Col Hess.\n\n      At trial, Capt. Novak remembered preparing a memorandum on the subject of\nGulf Group’s readiness to perform the camp package BPA, along with Capt. Trimble\n14\n   The October 20, 2004 Memorandum for Record introduced as an exhibit at trial is\nunsigned. Additionally, at the end of the unsigned memorandum, there were hand-\nwritten notations. At trial, it was not established who wrote the October 20, 2004\nMemorandum for Record, or who authored the hand-written notes on the document,\nwith various witnesses disavowing responsibility for the Memorandum for Record and\nMr. Cockerham challenging some of the statements attributed to him in the\nmemorandum.\n\n                                          9\n\fand Lt. Rivera, and Capt. Novak agreed with the impression that Gulf Group could do\nthe job well.      Capt. Novak indicated remembering a document similar to the\nmemorandum quoted above. He testified, however, that he did not believe the\nmemorandum quoted above is the exact memorandum he prepared because of the\nphrase, “blessed their capabilities,” which he said “just seems out of place to me.” Capt.\nNovak acknowledged that the memorandum quoted above could have been a draft of\nthe final memorandum he prepared. Capt. Trimble did not remember writing the\nmemorandum quoted above or any similar memorandum, or assisting anyone in writing\nsuch a memorandum, but stated that “[w]e left with the impression that they could\nperform the work.” Capt. Trimble also agreed with statements in the memorandum,\nincluding, “[t]he CO [contracting officer] believed Gulf Group were [sic] able to do the job\nand do the job well,” and noted that “Gulf Group had the technical and logistical\nexpertise, manpower, material, and equipment and it was our firm recommendation to\nallow Gulf Group to continue with the contract.”\n\n       With regard to Gulf Group’s performance on the dumpster contract, according to\nthe testimony of M. Sgt. Edward Sivert,15 a contracting officer’s representative who\nmaintained life support systems, including dumpsters, at Camp Arifjan from March 2004\nto February 2005, there were issues with Gulf Group not having enough dumpsters to\nreplace Future Services, a rival contractor, when Gulf Group took over performance of\ndumpster services at Camp Arifjan between mid-September and October 10, 2004.\nM. Sgt. Sivert testified that, as a result of this dumpster shortage, trash appeared on the\nground in different areas of Camp Arifjan over the course of a week or so, although no\nitem of trash necessarily had been on the ground for a full week. According to plaintiff,\nthe government had reduced the number of dumpsters below the number required from\nprevious contractors.16 Following the termination of Gulf Group’s dumpster contract, the\ngovernment awarded the contract to another contractor, Green Valley, and required two\nhundred sixty-five dumpsters, which was thirty-two more dumpsters than the\ngovernment had ordered plaintiff to provide. M. Sgt. Sivert explained that the trash on\nthe ground was not necessarily caused by the alleged reduction in the number of\ngovernment-requested dumpsters because some of the dumpsters had been located at\nthe ball field, which was closed. When asked, “if there is trash on the ground because\nthere is no [sic] sufficient dumpsters, whose fault is it,” M. Sgt. Sivert replied “probably\nthe government’s at that time, if there was enough dumpsters to put there.” M. Sgt.\nSivert further explained that not all of the other dumpster contracts had run out by\nSeptember 30, 2004, and that both Future Services and Gulf Group had dumpsters on\nbase at the same time. M. Sgt. Sivert noted that he was not present when Gulf Group\nallegedly had insufficient dumpsters on site. He also testified that he remembered Gulf\n\n15\n   Edward Sivert was a Sergeant First Class, rather than a Master Sergeant, during the\ntime of the relevant BPAs and contracts.\n16\n   According to a spreadsheet introduced into the record, which plaintiff asserts was\nprepared by a Maj. Ken Braddock, there were three hundred fifty-one dumpsters that\nwere expired and renewed between June 2003 and September 2004. The Army\ncontracted with Gulf Group for the provision of two hundred thirty-three dumpsters.\n\n                                            10\n\fGroup’s dumpsters being blue and Future Services’ dumpsters being “[g]oldish brown.”\nSaud Al Tawash testified, however, that Gulf Group’s dumpsters were painted red.\n\n       According to Saud Al Tawash, there was an incident with trash on the ground in\nSeptember 2004, which he attributed to “dirty competitors or dirty practices.” Saud Al\nTawash testified that other contractors had flipped over their own dumpsters, causing\ntrash to pile up on the ground. Megbel Al Tawash also testified that he believed the\ntrash on the ground on the first day of Gulf Group’s performance resulted from other\ncompanies tipping over their dumpsters. Mr. Cockerham, who was a contract specialist\nat Camp Arifjan at the time, testified that he had never heard of any problems with Gulf\nGroup’s dumpsters.\n\n         According to Joseph Libbey, the contracting officer who issued the final decisions\non Gulf Group’s latrine and dumpster contracts and camp package BPA claims, a police\nreport that was in the contract files, which he reviewed while considering Gulf Group’s\nclaims, indicated that employees of Gulf Group were scavenging through dumpsters at\nCamp Arifjan. The police report that Mr. Libbey referred to, however, was addressed to\nanother contractor, Gulf Company, as opposed to plaintiff Gulf Group. During testimony\nat trial, Mr. Libbey indicated that “I took Gulf Company to mean Gulf Group, I mean it’s\ngot Gulf and then Co. over here.” The parties have stipulated, however, that “Gulf\nCompany is not associated or related in any way with Gulf Group, Gulf Telecom, or any\nof the Al Tawash family members.” The two companies are distinct organizations, and\nthe record does not reflect that the government has ever issued any cure notices to Gulf\nGroup regarding performance under the dumpster contract. Moreover, Saud Al Tawash\ntestified that he received no performance complaints related to the dumpsters under the\ncontract.\n\n       Gulf Group’s performance of the latrine contract appears to have been\ncontentious since its inception, or even before, as Mr. Cockerham testified at trial that,\nprior to the initiation of contract performance on the latrine contract, Col. Hess had\nreceived a telephone call from Sally Ziedan of the incumbent contractor, Future\nServices, who was “livid going off about how dare he. How could he let Maj.\nCockerham go ahead and award the latrine contract to Gulf Group and how much\nexperience they had, and she was just raving.”17\n\n        Mohammed Al Tawash, Saud Al Tawash’s and Megbel Al Tawash’s brother, was\nasked to oversee the servicing of the four hundred Gulf Group latrines. Mohammed Al\nTawash also was a shareholder in Gulf Group, although, according to his testimony, he\nonly worked for Gulf Group on one occasion, October 7, 2004, which was his first time\nat Camp Arifjan. On that day, Mohammed Al Tawash carried a notepad, asked the\nmilitary escorts for a map, and asked questions about the location of the cafeteria and\nother buildings where latrines were to be placed. Mohammed Al Tawash testified that\nhe requested the information because Gulf Group did not have a service route for the\nlatrines, and a map could enable Gulf Group to be more efficient and effective in its\nperformance of the latrine contract. The parties stipulated that, “[o]n October 7, 2004,\n17\n     According to Mr. Cockerham, Future Services’ bid had arrived two days late.\n\n                                            11\n\ffour Gulf Group employees, were detained by Military Police and/or Counterintelligence\nofficers at Camp Arifjan. After being questioned, they were released to the Kuwait\nMinistry of the Interior” and a Military Police Report was generated regarding the\nincident. The police report stated that Mohammed Al Tawash asked questions\nregarding locations on base for latrine placement.\n\n        According to Mohammed Al Tawash, the military escorts answered his questions\nand he did not remember the escorts questioning his need for information or the\nbuilding locations. The military escorts worked in three hour shifts and, after the second\nshift, Mohammed Al Tawash and the three other Gulf Group employees with him\nreturned to the security station, hoping that a third escort could be arranged.18 At that\ntime, Mohammed Al Tawash and the other three Gulf Group employees were detained\nand interviewed by military police, who were not in uniform, but dressed in what\nMohammed Al Tawash testified was “evening night out attire.” The military police did\nnot search him or the vehicle the Gulf Group employees were driving. Mohammed Al\nTawash was not asked to sign any paperwork, nor was he fingerprinted. The notepad\nhe used to draw a service map and to take notes on the latrines that had already been\nserviced was confiscated and not returned. The military police turned the Gulf Group\nemployees over to the Kuwait Ministry of the Interior, and they were transported to a\npolice station. According to Mohammed Al Tawash, at the police station a detective\nasked them questions, requested their civil identifications, ran a background check, and\ncleared them shortly before midnight on the same day, October 7, 2004. Mohammed Al\nTawash testified that they were released, no charges were filed against them, and they\nwere not asked to return for a hearing. According to Saud Al Tawash, none of Gulf\nGroup’s employees were barred from the United States military camps as a result of this\nincident or any other incident. Mohammed Al Tawash testified that he was not able to\nfinish cleaning the latrines that day, but believed a vacuum truck returned to finish the\njob. He was unsure how many latrines remained to be serviced. Mr. Wilson testified\nthat he had heard that Mohammed Al Tawash had been using a GPS on base, and had\na cell phone with him at the time he inquired about the latrines, but could not confirm the\naccuracy of the information. Capt. Novak also reported hearing something about a GPS\nincident and Gulf Group, but he did not necessarily remember anything about workers\nasking allegedly suspicious questions. Mr. Wilson indicated that he “grilled him\n[Mohammed Al Tawash] pretty hard” about the alleged security incident afterward and\ninstructed him, as a precaution, not to ask similar types of questions on base.\n\n        According to Col. Laurence Portouw, the Third Army Assistant Chief of Staff who\nran the intelligence organization for the staff that supported the General at the Third\nArmy at Camp Arifjan and in Atlanta, Georgia, one of his staff officers told him about the\nalleged security incident involving Gulf Group personnel and said that the contract was\ngoing to be cancelled. Col. Portouw was asked whether he could have the cancellation\ndelayed so that the incident could be examined. Thereafter, Col. Portouw called Col.\nBrick Miller, Commander of the Area Support Group in Kuwait, stationed at Camp\nArifjan, about the incident. During this call, Col. Portouw asked Col. Miller to delay\n18\n  At trial, Mohammed Al Tawash was unclear as to whether he asked questions of both\nthe first and second shifts of escorts, or only of a single shift.\n\n                                            12\n\fcancellation of Gulf Group’s contract so the intelligence organization could look into the\nincident. Ultimately, a case was not opened on the incident involving Gulf Group\nbecause, according to Col. Portouw, “there was no substance to it” and the questions\nasked by Mohammed Al Tawash were “innocent.”\n\n        According to Col. Miller, he received a telephone call asking him to delay\ntermination of Gulf Group’s contract, but he does not recall who the call was from,\nalthough he admitted that “it could very well” have been from Col. Portouw.19 Col. Miller\nalso indicated that during this telephone call he was informed that the Counter\nIntelligence Team was looking into whether Gulf Group was involved in detonating\nimprovised explosive devices (IEDs) using cell phones, and he “took that as they [Gulf\nGroup] were aiding and abetting those that detonated IED’s with cell phones.”\nAccording to Col. Miller, he notified Col. Hess of the request to delay cancellation, and it\nwas his understanding that Col. Hess then deferred the termination.20 Col. Portouw,\nhowever, testified that he did not tell Col. Miller that Gulf Group employees were\nsuspected of detonating IEDs with cell phones because he was “not even sure I knew\nwho the company was at the time.” According to Capt. Jacquelyn Olsa,21 the S222\nintelligence officer at Camp Arifjan in October 2004, who reported to Col. Miller, she did\nnot have any discussions with Col. Miller about IEDs related to Gulf Group. She did\nbelieve, however, that she would have discussed the alleged security incident with Col.\nMiller, although she did not specifically remember doing so.\n\n        Col. Portouw indicated that such incident reports were not frequent, but also not\nuncommon, and that, “invariably we found out that they were curiosity-generated reports\nand simply required explaining to the employee why they shouldn’t do that.” Capt. Olsa\nindicated that similar incidents would typically occur “once a week,” although she\nindicated that she would “recommend a bar for these types of activities.” Col. Miller felt\nthe incident was not particularly important. When asked, Col. Hess agreed that the\nfailure to give a contractor a schematic plan of the camp could complicate performance,\nparticularly during startup, and that a layout with the number and locations of latrines\nwould be of considerable use to a new contractor. Like Col. Hess, Maj. Timothy Petty,\nthe support operations officer under the director of logistics at Camp Arifjan who\n\n19\n   In a July 7, 2010 email to Capt. Lisa Satterfield of the office of the Judge Advocate\nGeneral, Col. Miller indicated that he had received a phone call from “[t]he CFLCC/3rd\nAR C2/G2, a COL whose name escapes me,” and the officer stated that he had heard\nthe contractor would be terminated for deficiency and asked for a delay of the\ntermination.\n20\n  As described in greater detail below, Col. Hess testified that he reviewed Gulf Group’s\ncontract files and found no documentation linking the Al Tawash family to terrorists, anti-\nAmerican groups, the Taliban, Saddam Hussein, or any other enemies of America.\n21\n     At the relevant time, in Kuwait in 2004, Capt. Olsa was known as Capt. Hellmeier.\n22\n     The S2 refers to an intelligence officer at the coordinating staff level.\n\n                                                13\n\foversaw latrine contracts, testified that the provision of a map of where latrines should\nbe located was a good idea.\n\n        As a result of the alleged security incident, Col. Miller sent warning letters on\nOctober 21, 2004 to Saud Al Tawash, Marcos Sotos, Bobby Wilson, Mohammed Al\nTawash,23 Fizan Abdula, Mohadien Asif, and Munir Ahmed regarding Gulf Group and its\nemployees not following certain unspecified security regulations. According to Saud Al\nTawash, only four of the letter recipients (Mohammed Al Tawash, Fizan Abdula,\nMohadien Asif, and Munir Ahmed) had been involved in the incident. Although not\nconsistent with other testimony he offered at trial, Col. Miller testified that he first\nbecame aware of the alleged security incident concerning Gulf Group when he signed\nthese warning letters. Col. Miller indicated that “[t]housands” of warning letters such as\nthese were sent at that point in time in Kuwait and that this incident had “[n]othing to do\nwith” the termination of Gulf Group’s contracts and camp package BPA call.\n\n        In addition to testifying about the alleged security incident, Col. Miller also\ntestified about a latrine incident. According to Col. Miller, on a day in September or\nOctober 2004, he was summoned by Maj. Gen. Gary Spear24 to view about twenty\nlatrines in front of headquarters and facing the dining facility, which, according to Col.\nMiller, were “in a deplorable state of affairs or condition.” Col. Miller agreed with\nplaintiff’s counsel’s characterization of Maj. Gen. Spear having a “one-sided\nconversation” with Col. Miller, and which Col. Miller characterized as “a chewing out,\nbasically,” about fixing the latrines. Col. Miller testified that liquids were “overflowing out\nof the toilets,” and that it was a “life health safety issue” affecting “all of the latrines that\nwere there, because we opened every door.” At the trial, Col. Miller further described\nthe overflowing latrines as follows: “It’s coming over. It’s on the floor. It’s on the seat.”\nAccording to Col. Miller, either Col. Fugate, Col. Miller’s executive officer, or Col. Hess\nwas with him when he viewed the latrines, but he was not sure which officer was with\nhim. Col. Miller testified that either he told Col. Hess to fix the issue or had Col. Fugate\ntell Col. Hess to get it fixed. According to Col. Miller, there were no subsequent\ncomplaints, and Maj. Gen. Spear did not summon him again to view the latrines.\n\n        Joseph Libbey wrote in his contracting officer’s final decision on Gulf Group’s\ncontract and BPA claims that Maj. Gen. Spear not once, but twice, had “summoned\nColonel Miller and LTC Hess to, again, observe the deplorable conditions of the\nlatrines.” When Col. Hess testified at trial, he did not recall the latrine incident, and\ntestified that he did not recall ever seeing even one latrine overflowing. When\nquestioned about Mr. Libbey’s contracting officer’s final decision, which found, in part,\n“[b]arely a week had passed from the first latrine inspection when the General again\nsummoned Colonel Miller and LTC Hess to again observe the deplorable conditions of\nthe latrines,” Col. Hess testified that he certainly did not recall a second latrine incident\na week after the alleged first incident. Furthermore, contrary to Col. Miller’s testimony,\n23\n   The letter to Mohammed Al Tawash was incorrectly directed to “Mohammed\nAltawash.”\n24\n     Maj. Gen. Spear is sometimes referred to as Maj. Gen. “Spears” in the trial transcript.\n\n                                               14\n\fCol. Hess testified that no one ever directed him to fix the dirty latrine. According to Mr.\nCockerham, the dirty latrine was in front of Maj. Gen. Spear’s office, and it was a one-\ntime issue in which one latrine was not cleaned, and was subsequently corrected. Mr.\nCockerham testified that he believed the latrine issue was used as an excuse to\nterminate Gulf Group’s latrine contract because Maj. Petty wanted to consolidate two\nlatrine contractors into one, and because Maj. Petty preferred Future Services as the\ncontractor.\n\n         According to Maj. Petty, he learned of a latrine problem while he was at a\nmeeting at Camp Doha, through a call from Lt. Col. Platt, who told him that “he had\nreceived a phone call, that they were, that they [the latrines] were just really dirty,\ndisgusting, and I needed to get it fixed.” Maj. Petty testified that he personally inspected\na group of eight to ten Gulf Group latrines in a high-traffic area between the dining\nfacility and headquarters after 5 p.m., which had “feces above the rim.” He indicated\nthat “there was one that was extremely bad and then the others were just unkept,” but\nthat all but one were usable. He did not recall seeing any debris in the basin of the\nlatrines. After seeing the latrines, Maj. Petty called one of the non-commissioned\nofficers in his office, which may have been M. Sgt. Seibert,25 who served the role of\ncontracting officer representative for Gulf Group’s latrine contract, to make him aware of\nthe situation. Maj. Petty did not recall any specific conversation with Col. Hess about\nthe latrine issue, but did make Col. Miller, who was at the same meeting at Camp Doha,\naware of the situation. According to Maj. Petty, Gulf Group was contacted to resolve\nthe issue, which he believes Gulf Group resolved the following day, and there were no\nfurther incidents.\n\n       Saud Al Tawash testified that he never received a non-conformance report or\nwritten complaint about Gulf Group’s latrine contract. Saud Al Tawash did, however,\nreceive a call about a single overflowing latrine next to the dining facility, which,\naccording to his on-site superintendent, was filled with empty plastic bottles, even inside\nthe sewage tank “as if somebody was storing plastic bottles.” According to Saud Al\nTawash, Gulf Group’s latrines were unplumbed, such that it was “not possible” for them\nto overflow. Saud Al Tawash also testified, however, that the single, overflowing latrine\nwas an “isolated event.” Saud Al Tawash believed that this incident was due to people\nstoring plastic bottles in the latrine for recycling, or a cultural issue for third country\nnationals on Camp Arifjan, who were not used to unplumbed latrines.\n\n       According to trial testimony from Megbel Al Tawash, Gulf Group’s office received\na call that one latrine had feces up to the brim, which plaintiff’s on-site supervisor\ncleaned that same day. Megbel Al Tawash indicated that a Gulf Group latrine was\n“overflowing with bottles of water and feces.” Megbel Al Tawash testified that Future\nServices had about eight to ten latrines in the same area near the mess hall. Mr.\nWilson testified that, because the latrines from various companies all looked the same,\n\n25\n  Maj. Petty testified that “M. Sgt. Seibert” oversaw the latrine contract. It is unclear\nwhether Maj. Petty’s testimony refers to M. Sgt. Sivert, who as indicated above,\nmaintained life support systems at Camp Arifjan, including dumpsters.\n\n                                            15\n\fit was possible that the dirty latrine, or the latrines involved in the incident, belonged to\nanother contractor.\n\n        Maj. Petty testified that Future Services still had latrines in place when Jasmine\nInternational Trading & Service Company (Jasmine) and Gulf Group first arrived, so that\nthese new contractors would know where to put the latrines, and that, as a result, two\nsets of latrines may have been in a particular area at the same time. Maj. Petty also\ntestified that, to the best of his recollection, servicing the latrines once a day would have\nbeen sufficient. The statement of work for Gulf Group’s latrine contract stated, in part:\n\n       4.2 Cleaning. The Contractor will empty and clean each latrine daily by\n       wiping down interior walls and seat with mild disinfectant water or solution\n       (that is nonharmful to the skin and eyes) and will provide steam cleaning\n       reconditioning services once a month. The Contractor will provide all\n       materials, equipment, personnel, chemicals, and cleaning supplies to\n       include using an approved disinfectant. The Contractor will provide a\n       Material Safe Data Sheet to the COR for any chemicals used in this\n       contract. The cleaning services will include the following:\n\n       4.2.1 Daily. The Contractor will vacuum sewage from the basin. Debris\n       such as cans, bottles, rags, sticks, etc. will be removed from the waste\n       tank, collected and hauled away for proper disposal. No debris will be\n       allowed to contaminate the outside area around the chemical latrine. The\n       Contractor will be responsible for cleanup of any spills. After all sewage\n       and debris have been removed the Contractor will wash the toilet seat,\n       urinal, and adjacent area around the toilet seat with the approved cleaning\n       solution and remove all built up dirt and waste by scrubbing with a nylon\n       hand brush. The Contractor will fill the empty basin with a mixture of two\n       (2) cups disinfectant solution and ten (10) gallons fresh water. The\n       Contractor will refill toilet paper dispensers and hand sanitation gel\n       dispensers. The Contractor will leave the area in and around the latrines\n       in a sanitary state.\n\n(emphasis in original). Based on his experience, Col. Hess believed that a contract that\nonly required service of latrines once a day in high-traffic areas like the mess hall or\nheadquarters may have set a contractor up for failure because these areas should have\nbeen cleaned twice a day. Steven Perry, a former Army Colonel and plaintiff’s expert\non issues of Army contracting and standard practices and procedures for Army\ncontracting,26 also testified that, if the government sets a once-per-day cleaning\nrequirement for latrines, but has not anticipated the extent of the usage, the state of\nuncleanliness of the latrines may not be attributable to the contractor, but rather to faulty\n26\n   Mr. Perry was qualified as an expert in the standard practices and procedures of\nArmy contracting, including the subjects of the solicitation, award, management,\nadministration, closeout, and termination of contracts. Mr. Perry also was qualified as\nan expert on the interrelationship and interface of those same practices and procedures\nwith basic principles of command and control.\n\n                                             16\n\fspecifications, and that, if the specification underestimates usage, the specifications\nmay need to be altered. Moreover, according to Mr. Perry, if bottles of water were\nfound in a latrine, it would be the fault of the “end-user,” not of the contractor.\n\n        Mr. Perry further stated that “in a latrine contracting situation, you get all kinds of\ngarbage dumped in the latrines all the time. That happens to be a performance issue.\nThat is why this type of contract is very hard to manage.” During his testimony, Col.\nMiller also indicated that latrines are “a subject that you have to watch,” and that he\nwould expect that, if a contracting officer representative had seen the latrine incident, a\nnon-conformance report would have been prepared “[a]t some point.” In contrast, Col.\nHess testified that “we generally did not have problems with latrine contracts.”\nAccording to Col. Hess, a contractor missing a group of latrines during servicing was not\nuncommon and was not considered a serious offense warranting termination for default.\nCol. Hess further testified that, to his knowledge, his contracting office had no\nperformance problems with Gulf Group and that Gulf Group’s latrine contract was not\nterminated for failure to clean the latrines. Mr. Perry also testified that he does not think\nlatrine contracts are “hard to manage, as long as you set in place what needs to be\ndone.”\n\n       There is confusion and inconsistency in the record as to the timing of the latrine\nincident relative to the alleged security incident involving Mohammed Al Tawash. In his\nJuly 7, 2010 email to Capt. Satterfield, Col. Miller indicated, almost six years after the\nevent in question, that he believed the latrine incident occurred in the week prior to the\nalleged security incident. According to Maj. Petty, the support operations officer at\nCamp Arifjan who oversaw numerous latrine contracts, the alleged security incident\noccurred before the latrine incident, the latter of which occurred in the “October time\nframe.” Maj. Petty testified that, “[i]nitially before the deposition and we met, I would\nhave said it [the questions incident] was after the dirty latrines. But after reviewing the\nnotes that you [plaintiff’s counsel] showed me to refresh my memory, that it was before.”\nAccording to Mr. Wilson, the latrine incident was before the alleged security incident.\nMr. Wilson stated, “you know, first it was this issue in the latrine, and the next thing it’s\nthe issue of Mohammed. And the next thing it’s the issue of a counterintelligence\nmeasure.…”\n\nTerminations of the Camp Package BPA Call, the Latrine Contract, and the\nDumpster Contract\n\n        Maj. Davis terminated Gulf Group’s camp package BPA call at Camp Buehring\non October 12, 2004, through Modification 103. According to the parties’ joint\nstipulation of facts, the camp package BPA call was terminated for the government’s\nconvenience, although this is not clearly indicated on Modification 103. The\nmodification stated: “The purpose of this modification is to cancel the BPA call with Gulf\nGroup. Gulf Group has no issues with this cancellation and will accept it at no cost to\nthe government.” Despite terminating the camp package BPA call, the government had\nsufficient funds to pay for, and continued to be in need of, the camp package services.\nThe same day the cancellation was issued, Future Services was awarded two BPA calls\n\n\n                                              17\n\ffor Camp Buehring for approximately the same amount of goods and services as Gulf\nGroup’s cancelled camp package BPA call.\n\n       Plaintiff’s initial submission to the contracting officer in relation to the camp\npackage BPA call termination indicated that the termination was made in order to award\nGulf Group another BPA call. Plaintiff’s statement was supported by some of the\ntestimony at trial, which indicated that the termination of the Camp Buehring camp\npackage call was conditioned on the award to Gulf Group of a camp package call for\nCamp Virginia. During cross-examination at trial, Saud Al Tawash indicated that he\nmay have agreed to the termination of the Camp Buehring camp package call based\nupon the assurance that he would receive a camp package call for Camp Virginia.\nSaud Al Tawash testified that he had asked for the paperwork to be sent over for the\nproposed swap, which he never received. The parties have stipulated that “BPA Call\nNo. 0002 under Master BPA 0047 for general camp package services at Camp Virginia\nwas prepared for Gulf Group but never signed.” Saud Al Tawash indicated at trial that\nhe had received an undated hand-written note from Mr. Cockerham, stating:\n\n      Here is a copy of the cancellation to Camp Buehring. This cancellation\n      was made because we were giving you a larger camp call Virginia.\n      Virginia award was verbal with the agreement to cancel Buehring. Virginia\n      was not awarded on paper as a command directive. The original\n      cancellation was sent out 13 Oct 04. But here is another copy as\n      requested. Thank you.\n\n        From this note, Saud Al Tawash testified that he understood that the Army would\nnot award Camp Virginia to Gulf Group. Mr. Cockerham testified, however, that he may\nhave sent the note as a “reassurance” and that the note was intended to convey that a\ncall for Camp Virginia had been verbally “awarded,” but that Col. Hess had ordered\ncontracting personnel not to award Camp Virginia “on paper” because he may have\nbeen considering another contractor for the Camp Virginia call and because Col. Hess\n“was checking on...some other issues from perhaps a security report.” Instead, the\ncamp package call for Camp Virginia was initially awarded to StarCon, Ltd. (StarCon),\nbut the BPA call issued under that BPA was cancelled on October 11, 2004 by Maj.\nDavis, and ultimately was awarded to Kamal Al Sultan Company (KMS) on October 14,\n2004.\n\n        On October 18, 2004, Mr. Cockerham issued Modification P00002, which\nterminated plaintiff’s latrine contract pursuant to 48 C.F.R. § 52.212-4. The description\nof Modification P00002 reads: “This contract is being canceled due to command\ndirective of the ASG [Army Support Group] commander SWA COL Brick Miller 3rd Army\nArcent Kuwait. The contract is canceled under the terms of 52.212-1, 52-212-4 [sic],\n52.249-4.” According to the parties’ joint stipulation of facts, the latrine contract was\ncancelled on October 24, 2004, pursuant to Modification P00003, but the description of\nModification P00003 reads: “Modification to this previously canceled contract by order of\nthe ASG Commander Kuwait COL Miller. This mod is to remove money from previously\ncanceled contract that was ordered [sic] to be canceled. Contract was canceled in\n\n\n                                           18\n\faccordance with FAR Part 52.212-4.” Despite terminating Gulf Group’s latrine contract,\nthe government had sufficient funds to pay for, and continued to be in need of, the\nlatrine services. The parties stipulated that “[a]ll or part of the service that was initially\nawarded to Gulf Group under the latrine contract was awarded to Jasmine.” Following\ntermination of the latrine contract, the government continued to place orders for latrines\nwith Gulf Group for other locations, including Camp Victory, Camp Crossing, and the\nAsh Shuaybah Sea Port of Debarkation.\n\n       On October 22, 2004, Mr. Cockerham issued Modification P00005 on behalf of\nthe Army, which terminated Gulf Group’s dumpster contract for the convenience of the\ngovernment.27 Modification P00005 reads: “Contract is cancelled by order of the ASG\nCommander Kuwait COL Brick Miller. Contract was canceled in accordance with FAR\nPart 52.212-4 Termination for Convenience of the Government.” Despite terminating\nthe dumpster contract, the government had sufficient funds to pay for, and continued to\nbe in need of, the dumpster services. Prior to the termination of Gulf Group’s dumpster\ncontract, on October 14, 2004, the government sent a request to Fouad Salem of Abdul\nHameed Salem, seeking a quote for dumpster services at Camp Arifjan, to which Fouad\nSalem responded. Four days later, on October 18, 2004, and before plaintiff’s dumpster\ncontract was cancelled, a contract for dumpster services was awarded to Green Valley.\nAfter Gulf Group’s dumpster contract was terminated, however, the government\ncontinued to order dumpsters from Gulf Group for the Ash Shuaybah Sea Port of\nDebarkation.\n\n        Despite the language contained in the modifications terminating the camp\npackage BPA call and the latrine and dumpster contracts, at trial, a number of\nwitnesses offered contradictory testimony as to the reasons for the multiple\nterminations. Although contradicted by other witnesses, Col. Miller indicated that he did\nnot direct, nor was he involved in, the termination of the camp package BPA call, the\nlatrine contract, or the dumpster contract.28 Col. Miller stated that contracting was a\n\n27\n   The parties’ joint stipulation of facts states that Mr. Cockerham issued the termination\non October 22, 2004. Although Mr. Cockerham signed the modification terminating the\ncontract on October 21, 2004, October 22, 2004 is shown as the “effective date” of the\ntermination. Gulf Group was faxed the modification on October 28, 2004.\n28\n   For example, during direct examination, Col. Miller was presented with a copy of\nModification P00005 to the dumpster contract, which stated: “Contract is canceled by\norder of the ASG Commander Kuwait COL Brick Miller. Contract was canceled in\naccordance with FAR Part 52-212-4 Termination for Convenience of the Government.”\nAfter the Modification P00005 to the dumpster contract was read into the record, Col.\nMiller and plaintiff’s counsel had the following exchange:\n\n       Q: Is that statement true and correct?\n\n       A: No, sir.\n\n\n                                             19\n\fcompletely separate command structure from his own command, and that he did not\nhave the authority to terminate or award contracts. Col. Miller also testified, however,\nthat the Gulf Group terminations were not related to the alleged security incident,\nindicating at least some awareness of the whole situation. In addition, according to\nClea Efthimiadis, a United States Army29 civilian attorney assigned to Camp Arifjan at\nthe time, Col. Miller represented to her that Gulf Group’s latrine contract “was\nterminated because they couldn’t do the job,” and that the contract was terminated for\ndefault based on a “repeated failure to perform to the statement of work.” As noted\nabove, however, Gulf Group’s contracts and camp package BPA call were terminated\nfor the convenience of the government.30\n\n      Q: Do you have any idea on your -- this is going back to your knowledge\n      and -- mind you -- why Major Cockerham would have said that you\n      ordered this termination?\n\n      A: Can you be more specific than, “any idea?” Any idea at that time? Any\n      idea now? Any idea hearsay?\n\n      Q: Very good point. In -- you’ll notice the effective date of this is October\n      22, 2004. In 2004, did you have any idea -- did you even know that this\n      contract had been canceled?\n\n      A: Sir, I couldn’t have told you that this contract even existed in this form.\n      Because I didn’t talk to contractors. I didn’t --\n\n      Q: This is not your command.\n\n      A: -- correct. I had no reason to look at these, nor do I have any reason to\n      look at when they cancel them.\n29\n  Although formerly a civilian attorney for the United States Army, Ms. Efthimiadis was\nan attorney for the United States Navy when she testified in the above-captioned cases.\n30\n   The distinction between termination for default or cause and termination for\nconvenience is evident from the termination clauses in the camp package BPA:\n\n      Termination for the Government’s convenience.              The Government\n      reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole\n      convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall\n      immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and\n      all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms\n      of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid a percentage of the contract\n      price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of\n      termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to\n      the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping\n      system, have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be\n      required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost\n\n                                            20\n\f        Col. Hess, the head of contracting at Camp Arifjan at the relevant time, offered\ninconsistent and self-serving testimony at trial, but generally testified that he believed\nGulf Group’s camp package BPA call, latrine contract, and dumpster contract were\nterminated because of security concerns, and that Col. Miller gave a directive or order\nto terminate the contracts. According to Col. Hess’ testimony, Col. Hess ordered Mr.\nCockerham to terminate Gulf Group’s latrine and dumpster contracts, and Col. Hess\nordered Maj. Davis to terminate Gulf Group’s camp package BPA call, because “[w]e\nwere ordered to get Gulf Group off the bases, the camps.” Col. Hess indicated that this\norder to remove Gulf Group from the bases did not come from Col. Mark Neumann, the\nPrincipal Assistant Responsible for Contracting at Camp Arifjan in October 2004, to\nwhom Col. Hess reported, or anyone in ARCENT (United States Army Central\nCommand). He also stated that he had reviewed the contract files, and that none of the\nfiles included any documentation linking the Al Tawash family to terrorists, anti-\nAmerican groups, the Taliban, Saddam Hussein, or any other enemies of America.\nAccording to Mr. Wilson, however, Col. Hess told him that Gulf Group’s contracts were\nterminated due to “counterintelligence on the Al Tawash family, and they have ties [to]\nAl Qaeda and Saddam Hussein.” Notably, Col. Hess testified that the government\nterminated Gulf Group for convenience, rather than for default, so that Gulf Group could\nfile claims for reimbursement because the government did not “want to cause any\nundue hardship” to Gulf Group. Col. Hess further stated that he does not believe that a\ntermination for default is proper even if a contractor is suspected of anti-American ties\nor sentiments.\n\n       According to Col. Portouw, the Gulf Group cancellations “had something to do\nwith performance with latrines,” but he did not recall who told him that and did not\nindicate to which Gulf Group contract he was referring because he never referred\nspecifically to any particular contract during his testimony. According to Maj. Petty’s\nrecollection, Gulf Group’s contracts were terminated because of the alleged security\n\n\n\n      principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government\n      any right to audit the Contractor’s records. The Contractor shall not be\n      paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could\n      have been avoided.\n\n      Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or\n      any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or\n      if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or\n      fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances\n      of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the\n      Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for\n      supplies or services not accepted, and the Contract shall be liable to the\n      Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is\n      determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for\n      default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.\n\n                                           21\n\fincident, as opposed to the dirty latrine incident.31 Maj. Petty testified that he had never\nheard of Gulf Group having any affiliation with the Taliban.\n\n       Capt. Novak also testified that a Gulf Group contract was terminated because of\na “security incident.” Capt. Novak disagreed with the decision to terminate Gulf Group’s\ncamp package BPA call, and although he was at first unable to meet with Col. Hess,\nCapt. Novak did meet with Col. Neumann32 to discuss his disagreement with the\ntermination. Capt. Novak also indicated that he did not feel that he was going outside\nthe chain-of-command or risking his career by doing so. Eventually, Capt. Novak was\nable to meet with Col. Hess to voice his disagreement with the decision to terminate\nGulf Group’s camp package BPA call. Capt. Novak also met with Tijani Saani, a civilian\nassigned to the contracting office at Camp Arifjan, who was the deputy to Col. Hess,\nabout the decision. Capt. Trimble also spoke to Col. Neumann about terminating Gulf\nGroup’s camp package BPA call and told Col. Neumann that he believed Gulf Group\nwas capable of performing. Capt. Trimble indicated that he had heard that Gulf Group’s\ncamp package BPA call was going to be terminated because the camp “mayors”\npreferred to keep their current contractors to avoid interruption of services.\n\n       Mr. Cockerham testified that he terminated Gulf Group’s latrine and dumpster\ncontracts based on a direct order from Col. Hess, who himself had been ordered to\nterminate the contracts by Col. Miller. According to Mr. Cockerham, a termination for\nconvenience in the interest of national security relieves the government of liability for\n“any losses.”33 Mr. Cockerham stated, however, the termination has to be or should be\nheavily documented, which is why he requested a report to document the file, to protect\nthe contracting office and the government. According to Mr. Cockerham, Col. Hess\ndirected him to cancel Gulf Group’s contracts “in the interest of security, national\nsecurity.” Mr. Cockerham further testified that Col. Hess said that a call for Camp\nVirginia should not be awarded to Gulf Group because they were a security risk.\nAccording to Mr. Cockerham, he asked Col. Miller and Col. Hess for a security incident\nreport, or even just the incident number, to attach to the latrine and dumpster contract\ncancellations, but they never gave him one. Capt. Trimble testified that Mr. Cockerham\nwas upset that he never received a Memorandum of Record from Col. Hess, stating that\nCol. Hess directed Mr. Cockerham to cancel Gulf Group’s contracts. At trial, Col. Hess\n31\n   Maj. Petty’s testimony on this point appears to be related to the termination of three of\nplaintiff’s contracts, the camp package BPA call and the latrine and dumpster contracts,\nalthough his testimony is not explicit in this regard.\n32\n   Although the trial transcript refers to “Col. Newman,” other areas of Capt. Novak’s\ntestimony refer to Col. Neumann, Col. Hess’ superior and the Principal Assistant\nResponsible for Contracting at Camp Arifjan.\n33\n    Mr. Cockerham subsequently elaborated that in his mind, “[t]he only time the\ngovernment can possibly get around reimbursing in the interest of convenience is in the\ninterest of national security.” It is unclear from Mr. Cockerham’s testimony whether he\nbelieved that a termination for convenience in the interest of national security absolves\nthe government of all liability or only liability relating to “losses.”\n\n                                            22\n\fdenied that either Mr. Cockerham or Maj. Davis had asked for a security incident report\nin order to support the cancellations of the contracts or the camp package BPA call.\n\n        The October 20, 2004 Memorandum for Record, which Capt. Novak stated is\nsimilar to the one he wrote with Capt. Trimble and Lt. Rivera, provides that, “Major\nCockerham informed the CO’s to cancel the [camp package] BPA call to Gulf Group\ndue to their inexperience in building tents,” and that the contract should be awarded to\nBritish Link Kuwait, although its prices were “unreasonably” high. At trial, however, Mr.\nCockerham denied having told Capt. Trimble, Capt. Novak, and Lt. Rivera that Gulf\nGroup’s camp package BPA call was being terminated due to Gulf Group’s\ninexperience in building tents, or that it was in the government’s best interest to award\nthe call to British Link Kuwait. Mr. Cockerham testified he believed that Tijani Saani told\nCapt. Trimble, Capt. Novak, and Lt. Rivera that the statements were coming from Mr.\nCockerham, when they actually came from Col. Hess.\n\n         Joseph Libbey stated in his contracting officer’s final decisions, and testified at\ntrial, that he believed that the contracts were terminated due to dumpster diving and\nrummaging through camp dumpsters, perhaps the latrine issue, and security reasons.\nIn Mr. Libbey’s final decision for the dumpster contract he stated: “On 9 October 2004,\nsix Gulf Group employees were detained for security violations involving traveling on\nCamp Arifjan without their required escort, and rummaging through a dumpster. At\nleast four of these individuals were barred from Camp Arifjan by Colonel Miller on 16\nand 18 October 2004.” The contractor allegedly involved in dumpster diving, however,\nwas Gulf Company, not Gulf Group. At trial, Mr. Libbey testified that he “took Gulf\nCompany to mean Gulf Group.” Mr. Libbey’s final decision on Gulf Group’s dumpster\ncontract also stated:\n\n       The Government originally contemplated terminating Gulf Group’s\n       contracts for failure to comply with security regulations; however, due to\n       the global war on terror operational tempo in the area, and a desire to\n       maintain a friendly working relationship with local contractors that often\n       include prominent Kuwaiti families, the Government decided to terminate\n       the contract for the convenience of the Government.34\n\n        According to Saud Al Tawash and Mr. Wilson, they first learned that Gulf Group’s\nlatrine and dumpster contracts and camp package BPA call were being terminated\nthrough their competitors. According to Saud Al Tawash, he first heard rumors about\nthe cancellations from an individual working with a competitor, Jasmine, who told him\n“they’re going to cancel all your contracts because they have a report of an intelligence\nthat you guys are related to terrorist groups and you’re anti-American.” Saud Al Tawash\nalso testified that Mr. Wilson was then told “directly from the contracting office” that\n34\n   Mr. Libbey testified that Mr. Randall Kemplin, a government civilian counsel who\nworked with Mr. Libbey on the claims, wrote the above quoted paragraph, which was\nincorporated into Mr. Libbey’s contracting officer’s final decision. Although Mr. Libbey\nwas not aware of how Mr. Kemplin had obtained the information, Mr. Libbey stated he\nwas “good with it.”\n\n                                            23\n\fthere was a “security” and a “counter intelligence concern,” and that the contracting\noffice alleged that the alleged security incident was the reason for the cancellations. At\ntrial, Saud Al Tawash also pointed out that the contracting officer, Mr. Libbey, made a\nfinal determination that the contracts were terminated due to the alleged security\nincident. Saud Al Tawash testified that Capt. Trimble, Capt. Novak, Lt. Rivera, and\nTijani Saani all told him that the contracts were terminated as a result of a concern for\nsecurity. Saud Al Tawash also indicated that he had heard that the promised award of\nCamp Virginia had been put on hold, with the possibility of cancellation, due to the\nsecurity concerns.\n\n        According to testimony offered by Mr. Wilson, on October 17 or 18, 2004, he\nspoke with Mr. Cockerham, Tijani Saani, and Col. Hess about the Gulf Group\ncancellations and prepared a report about those discussions. Mr. Wilson testified that\nMr. Cockerham told him that the cancellations were coming from above him at “the\ngeneral level.” Mr. Wilson also stated that Col. Hess told him that the cancellations had\nto do with security and counterintelligence, and that the Army Support Group\ncommander made the decision to cancel. According to Mr. Wilson, Tijani Saani told him\nthat they were cancelling all of Gulf Group’s contracts for security reasons, but that\n“we’ll try to get you guys some work.” Mr. Wilson also spoke to Col. Hess over the\ntelephone. Mr. Wilson stated Col. Hess did not want to talk to him, and was “really\nnervous, talking in circles.” According to Mr. Wilson, Col. Hess stated during this\ntelephone call that Gulf Group’s contracts were terminated due to “counterintelligence\non the Al Tawash family, and they have ties [to] Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein.” Mr.\nWilson also heard someone comment that Gulf Group was a “bunch of kids” and\nneeded to be “taken out,” although he could not remember if he heard this from an Army\nofficer or from one of Gulf Group’s competitors.\n\n        Col. Khalid Al Salal, a retired intelligence officer for the Kuwait Ministry of\nDefense, who had left the ministry, but maintained communication with the security and\nintelligence office, testified as a witness for plaintiff and stated that Gulf Group, Gulf\nTelecom, and Saud Al Tawash were all cleared by Kuwaiti security and passed\nbackground checks. Col. Al Salal further testified that the Al Tawash family is very well-\nknown in Kuwait, and that he had never heard of any links between the Al Tawash\nfamily and the Taliban, Saddam Hussein, or other anti-American groups. Maj. Petty\nsimilarly testified that he never heard that Gulf Group was suspected of having\nconnections with the Taliban. Mr. Cockerham testified that he heard a number of\nrumors about Gulf Group’s involvement with the Taliban and other similar groups, which\nhe believed were not true.\n\n       Ferdinand Peters, the attorney retained by Gulf Group in October 2004, testified\nthat he met separately with Col. Hess, Col. Miller, Mr. Cockerham, and Tijani Saani, and\nwas given “a variety of reasons” by “everyone” for the termination of Gulf Group’s latrine\nand dumpster contracts and camp package BPA call. Mr. Peters testified that “I can\nonly say that there were multiple reasons given.” Mr. Peters indicated that he was “told\nabout security problems, and words had come up in various discussions as connections\nto terrorists, cell phone use, personnel of Gulf Group asking questions and being a\n\n\n                                           24\n\fsecurity threat, or whatever. Things like that.” Mr. Peters recalled that, in his meeting\nwith Col. Miller, Col. Miller had “mentioned” the latrine incident to Mr. Peters, and may\nhave indicated that Gulf Group was suspected of being allied with anti-American\ninterests. Mr. Peters could not “remember exactly what was stated,” but indicated that\n“[i]t was so serious of what we were being told that efforts were being made by the\nfamily to figure out through Congressional action and like that on what was going on\nhere.”\n\n       After speaking with Mr. Wilson and hearing rumors from his competitors, Saud Al\nTawash contacted Congressman Trent Franks, who was “an old family friend,” to\ninquire on Gulf Group’s behalf about rumors of Al Tawash family links to anti-American\ngroups because “it was hurting our family reputation.” According to Saud Al Tawash,\nCongressman Franks called Col. Miller, Col. Hess, Tijani Saani, and Mr. Cockerham to\n“restore my family’s reputation” and to “chat with the right people from in the upper\nchannels at the military to find out if this is truth [sic].” In an October 27, 2004 email\naddressed to Gen. Keith Alexander and Gen. Steven Whitcomb, Congressman Franks\nstated: “I am respectfully asking the military command to issue a letter stating\ncategorically that the cancellation of the subject contracts was in no way related to any\ncounterintelligence, espionage, or security concern connected to the Al-Tawash family\nor the Gulf Group.” Gen. Whitcomb forwarded the email to Col. Miller, Col. Richard\nMcEvoy, and Col. Louis Yuengert, requesting a status update. Col. McEvoy responded\nthat the letter had been taken care of by the Army. Col. Miller recalled receiving a\ntelephone call from Congressman Franks about the Al Tawash family, followed shortly\nby a telephone call from Gen. Alexander on the same subject. Col. Hess testified that\nhe did “not remember being called by Congressman Franks.” On November 3, 2004,\nCol. Hess was directed, he assumed by Col. Miller,35 to write a letter to Mohammed Al\n35\n     Col. Hess’ testimony at trial was as follows:\n\n         Q: Looking at Exhibit 147, this being a letter from the Department of the\n         Army dated November 3, 2004 to Mohammed Al Tawash, with what\n         purports to be your signature. Is that indeed your signature?\n\n         A: Yes, it is.\n\n         Q: Did anyone order you to write this letter?\n\n         A: I don’t remember, but I wrote the letter so I presume I was directed to\n         write the letter.\n                                             …\n\n         Q: Do you recall receiving a direct order commanding you to write the\n         letter, or did someone simply ask if you might accommodate them by\n         writing the letter?\n\n         A: Instead of saying yes or no, can I explain my recollection of the letter?\n\n\n                                               25\n\fTawash about the cancellation of Gulf Group’s latrine contract, which, according to\nSaud Al Tawash, was drafted in response to Congressman Franks’ inquiries. Saud Al\nTawash testified that he did not know why the letter from Col. Hess was addressed to\nhis brother, Mohammed Al Tawash. The letter stated, in pertinent part:\n\n       Please rest assured that the Gulf Group’s contract to service portable\n       latrines at Army camps in Kuwait was not terminated because of security\n       reasons. While it is true that some employees of the Gulf Group have\n       been either barred from the installation or warned because they had not\n       followed the rules for contract employees on the installation, these\n       incidents did not cause the termination of the contract.\n\n       The contracting officer terminated the contract because circumstances\n       arose that caused the contracting officer to conclude that it was in the best\n       interest of the Army to terminate the contract. Since the contract was\n       terminated for convenience of the government, the Gulf Group should not\n       suffer any repercussions to its reputation or competitive standing. The\n       Gulf Group is fully eligible to compete for other Army contracts in Kuwait.\n       I hope this clarifies this unfortunate misunderstanding.\n\n       Col. Hess further testified that “Colonel Miller actually wanted to author a letter to\nsend to the Al Tawash family and I recommended against that, that this was a\ncontractual issue and any such letter ought to be coming from the contracting office.”\nAccording to Col. Hess, the security and espionage concerns about Gulf Group “turned\nout to be unfounded,” but the statement in the letter that Gulf Group’s latrine contract\n“was not terminated because of security reasons” was “false.” In other words, based on\nCol. Hess’ testimony, Gulf Group was terminated for security reasons, but those same\nsecurity concerns later turned out to be unfounded. Also according to Col. Hess, the\n\n       Q: Please do. Yes, sir.\n\n       A: My recollection of the letter was we went through all the security stuff,\n       all the concerns about espionage in the previous few exhibits we went\n       through, and it turned out to be unfounded. This is my recollection. As\n       such, we still had a viable contractor that we could do business with. The\n       purpose of this letter was to put Gulf Group on notice that we still would\n       like to consider them to do Army contracting, to engage, to bid on Army\n       requirements in the future.\n\n       Q: Who directed you to send this letter?\n\n       A: I don’t recall specifics.\n\n       Q: It was Colonel Brick Miller, wasn’t it?\n\n       A: I’m going to have to make the assumption that it was the ASG, Colonel\n       Miller. He was my primary customer.\n\n                                             26\n\fstatement that some Gulf Group employees had been barred was, likewise, untrue and\ninaccurate based on his recollections, but he had obtained that information to insert into\nthe letter from Col. Miller. Col. Hess indicated that he also had help from the ASG\nJudge Advocate General’s office when composing the November 3, 2004 letter, but did\nnot identify by name any individuals who aided him.\n\nBottled Water Delays\n\n       Gulf Group’s bottled water BPA calls were not cancelled at the time of the\nOctober 2004 terminations of the camp package BPA call, the latrine contract, and the\ndumpster contract, and Gulf Group continued to supply bottled water to the Army under\nthe bottled water BPA in 2005. According to the parties’ joint stipulation of facts,\nbetween November 1, 2004 and March 31, 2005, United States government contractors\nsupplying bottled water in Iraq were required to travel in military convoys. The convoy\nrequirement was issued to ensure the prompt delivery of bottled water and for the\nprotection of personnel and supplies. During this time period, all of Gulf Group’s\ndeliveries of bottled water to camps in Iraq were made by trucks traveling to and from\nIraq and Kuwait with military convoys. The trucks were delayed at times for a number of\nreasons, including IEDs and observance of religious holidays by Iraqi nationals. The\nparties have jointly stipulated that “[a]dditionally, the delays occasionally were caused\nby the Government not having sufficient escorts.” According to Saud Al Tawash, most\nGulf Group trucks going into Iraq around April 2005 were delayed more than a week.\n\n       Saud Al Tawash testified that, pursuant to Gulf Group’s bottled water BPA, Gulf\nGroup was required to contact certain Army officials to obtain delivery instructions. The\nbottled water BPA refers to these requirements as “Special Instructions,” which state in\npart:\n\n      Purchased For: US Army Various Locations in Kuwait and Iraq. Surface\n      to some of the locations are unimproved which could cause delays in\n      deliveries. Contractor shall do everything possible to ensure deliveries are\n      made on time. The contractor is liable for all equipment and personnel\n      necessary to deliver to the proper quantities. The US Military is not liable\n      for damages caused to transportation assets or equipment necessary to\n      deliver the items.\n\n      Personnel to contact for directions and acess [sic] to various locations are\n      as follows:\n\n      MAJ Banks:36 968-4819\n      CPT Sharp:37 970-5952\n\n36\n  According to the parties’ joint stipulation of facts, “Major Banks was the chief of the\nbottled water branch until October 2004, when she was replaced by LTC Derrick\nShoemake,” who was the chief of the bottled water branch at Camp Arifjan during April\n2005.\n\n                                           27\n\f       Saud Al Tawash further testified that the Army officers gave Gulf Group convoy\nnumbers, which he understood to be a requirement that Gulf Group travel in convoys.\nAccording to Mr. Wilson, at a post-award vendor meeting attended by Lt. Col. Derrick L.\nShoemake, chief of the bottled water branch at Camp Arifjan, Mr. Cockerham, and Sgt.\nDiane Brooks, all the bottled water contractors were told that they were required to\nmove in convoys. Also at the post-award vendor meeting, Mr. Wilson was told to follow\nthe instructions to travel with convoys given by Lt. Col. Shoemake and Sgt. Brooks. Mr.\nWilson stated that contractors could hire private protection, but that even then they\nwould have had to coordinate transportation with the Army. Mr. Wilson explained that\nGulf Group could not have transported the water without the military convoys because\nthere was significant fear over the physical safety of the water and potential biological\nadditives, such that “if you showed up at a front gate of an army base unescorted with\ntruck loads of water, you’re probably going to be shot.” Mr. Wilson also testified that\nrules and regulations were posted on a wall at Camp Navistar, a convoy consolidation\npoint in Kuwait, specifying that trucks “must stay in convoy, they must be escorted all\ntimes.”\n\n       Lt Col. Mary O’Connor, a battalion commander and chief of transportation\nresponsible for the movement of control teams at convoy support centers throughout\nIraq in 2004 and 2005, testified that all trucks in Iraq were required to move in military\nconvoys, and that she knew this to be the case because she was in charge of this\nprocess. Lt. Col. O’Connor identified a specific “fragmentary order” (FRAGO) as the\ndocument requiring all vehicles used in support of the military to travel in convoys. The\nFRAGO provides:\n\n      The purpose of this FRAGO is to enhance and convoy [sic] security\n      measures to protect the force by providing convoy commanders and unit\n      commanders tools to ensure that all measures have been properly taken\n      to safeguard personnel and equipment. Unit/convoy commanders are\n      personally responsible for the conduct and protection of convoy\n      operations. MNF-I units will monitor their convoys, and exercises control\n      measures implemented by unit commanders.\n\n      3.C. (U) Tasks to Subordinate Unites. [sic]\n\n      3.C.1.

There will be two vehicles minimum during daylight hours, and\n         three vehicles minimum during the hours of darkness. There will be at\n         least two soldiers per vehicle and three in the trail vehicle to provide a\n         turret or rear gunner for tactical vehicle movements.\n\n         3.D.2. Non-tactical vehicle (NTV) movements used to transport\n         military members, DOD civilians, and DOD contractors are cautioned\n         not to move outside secure zones without security as set forth by\n         MSC38 commanders. As far as practical use armored/add on armored\n         commercial vehicles to move off FOBS. The use and number of NTVS to\n         support movement requirements is delegated to the MS[] commanders.\n         However, the number of NTVs used should consider current AIF TTPS,\n         emergency cross loading of personnel requirements and safety. NTVs will\n         posses [sic] communication IAW Para 5.A.2. below, and have\n         communication with the security escort.\n\n         3.D.3. Convoy commanders are responsible for the self-protection\n         capability within their convoy. There will be at least one rifle in each\n         vehicle for all movements. Tactical vehicle movements must have 360\n         degree security consisting of an M249 or above from the turret or out the\n         back with the “canvas” removed. All military personnel will carry personal\n         weapons, wear fragmentation protective vest, ballistic eye protection, and\n         combat helmet. A minimum of one vehicle will maintain communications\n         contact with coalition forces. Convoys will not have lights on during\n         daylight operations. During night operations white lights will be used, and\n         they will have NVDS in each vehicle.\n\n         3.D.4. Prior to all movements, convoy commanders will conduct\n         coordination and include communications equipment sufficient to\n         communicate with other MSCS when traveling through their AOR.\n         Advanced notification to other MSCS will minimize potential fratricide of\n         blue on blue forces. All vehicles must log out with parent unit and provide\n         ETA to destination. All vehicles must report at destination to their parent\n         unit.\n\n         3.D.5. Breakdown procedures, convoy commanders are responsible for\n         self-recovery capability within each convoy. Recovery equipment will be\n         available to each convoy. Commanders will take all reasonable measures\n         to recover vehicles and will abandon vehicles as last resort only. They will\n         recover the vehicle to the nearest CSO or LSA if possible. If not, leave\n         appropriate security personnel and an operational vehicle with it until it\n         can be recovered.\n\n         3.D.6. All MSCS will report deteriorating road conditions to MNCI, upon\n         reporting to convoy support center operations cell(s), convoy commanders\n38\n     It appears that MSC stands for Major Subordinate Command.\n\n                                             29\n\f       will report locations where maintenance is required and where engineer\n       work could mitigate areas of vulnerability.\n\n       3.D.7. In the greater Baghdad area defined by the MND Baghdad area\n       there will cautinue [sic] to be mission critical movements only. Units will\n       verify route status with 1 CD website or Iraqna or prior to any movement.\n\n       3.D.8. There will be a minimum ratio of one tactical security vehicle for\n       every ten military cargo vehicles, and a minimum ratio or [sic] one tactical\n       security vehicle for every 5 KBR cargo vehicles. There will be no less\n       than two security vehicles for every convoy (Para. 3.D.1.).\n                                            ...\n\n       4.B.

All soldiers\n       operating or riding in tactical and NTV vehicles must wear regulation gear\n       as stated in paragraph 3.D.3. above.\n\n        The FRAGO does not specifically refer to government contractors. Lt. Col.\nO’Connor testified, albeit inconsistently, that it was understood that, if a contractor was\nsupporting the military, it was “assumed in the order that they would – that we would\nprotect them.” Nevertheless, Lt. Col. O’Connor testified that the language “DOD\ncontractors are cautioned not to move outside secure zones without security as set forth\nby MSC commanders. As far as practical use armored/add on armored commercial\nvehicles to move off FOBS,” was a recommendation, rather than an order, until a more\nstringent order was delivered. Lt. Col. O’Connor also testified that she had not seen a\nmore stringent order. She then stated that the existing order was intended to require\ncivilian contractors to travel in military convoys. Lt. Col. O’Connor also testified that\nthere were no exceptions to this convoy requirement, however, she conceded that some\ncontractors violated the convoy requirement. She also acknowledged that the Army\ncould not control the travel of all civilians. Although her testimony regarding the number\nof days of travel time between Kuwait and Iraq was inconsistent, she did indicate,\nhowever, perfect travel conditions were rare in Iraq at the time.\n\n       Regarding the cause of the bottled water transportation delays, Saud Al Tawash\nstated that, having been to the border between Kuwait and Iraq, he had personal\nknowledge of Gulf Group trucks delayed at the border due to insufficient escorts, which\nwas “the only cause” of delay. He stated, however, that he did not travel with the Gulf\nGroup trucks beyond the border to deliver the water into Iraq. According to Saud Al\nTawash, it was Lt. Col. Shoemake and KBR, another contractor, through whom Saud Al\nTawash learned that the truck delays in Iraq were caused by lack of escorts. Mr. Wilson\nstated that he had learned from the truck drivers that the delays in the delivery of bottled\nwater were caused by “security and the lack of escorts,” as well as convoy priorities. He\n\n\n                                            30\n\ffurther indicated the delays were also caused by IEDs and accidents. Mr. Wilson also\ntestified that Gulf Group trucks were being delayed at the bases because they also were\nbeing used to store water and to haul military equipment on their return trips, despite\nGulf Group’s contract and arrangement with the trucking company that there only would\nbe one-way hauls. Neither Saud Al Tawash nor Mr. Wilson, personally, were on board\nthe trucks that delivered bottled water for Gulf Group into Iraq.\n\n        Megbel Al Tawash testified that he knew from project managers and from\ncoordinating with Expeditors, the company Gulf Group had hired to transport the bottled\nwater, that the lack of escorts “was the main problem” Gulf Group experienced with the\ndelivery of bottled water to Iraq. Megbel Al Tawash further stated that he personally\nobserved Gulf Group trucks used by the military to haul equipment, specifically\nHumvees, on return trips from Iraq. Lt. Col. O’Connor agreed that it was “quite\npossible” that bottled water trucks coming back from Iraq into Kuwait were loaded with\nmilitary equipment. Mr. Cockerham testified that “quite often what they would do is put\nequipment on the trucks that were designated just for carrying water,” and that he\nbelieved Gulf Group’s bottled water trucks were being used to haul military equipment\non the return trips. Mr. Cockerham stated that there was no agreement between the\nbottled water contractors and the government to use the bottled water trucks for hauling\nmilitary equipment on return trips. The parties also have stipulated that, “[t]here was no\nagreement between Gulf Group and the Government to use some or all of Gulf Group’s\ntrucks that delivered bottled water to camps in Iraq, to transport military equipment back\nto Kuwait on their return trips from Iraq.” The Army had another contract in place to\ntake equipment out of Iraq, but it apparently was not always used.\n\n       Due to the acknowledged delays in the delivery of bottled water, the government\noffered to increase the amount it was paying to the bottled water contractors to cover\ndemurrage charges. Between November 1, 2004 and March 31, 2005, Gulf Group\ncharged 2.400 KD per case for bottled water. The parties stipulated, “[o]n April 5, 2005,\na contracting officer, John Cockerham, submitted a proposal to all contractors supplying\nbottled water to camps in Iraq to increase the price of the bottled water to 2.578 KD per\ncase, in exchange for the contractors not charging the Government for additional\nexpenses including demurrage incurred in the deliveries.” Mr. Cockerham’s email\nstated: “All previous claims prior to APR 05 will continue to be processed.” According to\nthe parties’ joint stipulation of facts, Gulf Group received, and accepted, the proposal of\nthe higher rate per case in exchange for not making any more claims for demurrage\nincurred after April 1, 2005.\n\nPlaintiff’s Submissions and Claims\n\n      On December 15, 2005, Gulf Group submitted a claim under the bottled water\nBPA for 298,435.000 KD in demurrage for delays incurred between November 2004\nand March 2005 to Mr. Cockerham, who was the contract specialist for the bottled water\nBPA in Kuwait.39 The following day, December 16, 2005, Gulf Group submitted three\n39\n   The KD value later was calculated to be equivalent to $1,035,802.23 in plaintiff’s\noriginal complaint in the bottled water case, Case No. 07-82C, and $1,065,711.39 in its\n\n                                            31\n\f“Claim & Settlement Offers”40 to Mr. Cockerham, proposing settlement in the amount of\n$4,544,339.84 for the termination of the camp package BPA call, in the amount of\n$4,558,428.60 for the termination of the latrine contract, and in the amount of\n$999,994.67 for the termination of the dumpster contract.41 The 2005 Claim and\nSettlement Offers also asserted that Gulf Group was entitled to $10,000,000.00 for the\ntermination of the camp package BPA call, $5,058,428.5942 for the termination of the\nlatrine contract, and $1,110,621.72 for the termination of the dumpster contract. Saud\nAl Tawash signed the cover letter to Gulf Group’s four submissions to Mr. Cockerham in\n2005, and all four submissions were certified by plaintiff’s attorney at the time,\nFerdinand Peters.\n\n       On October 19, 2006, the Camp Arifjan contracting office files were searched,\nbut there was no record of Gulf Group’s December 15 and 16, 2005 submissions. Gulf\nGroup then re-submitted the same Claim and Settlement Offers between October 20,\n2006 and October 22, 2006, and the submissions were put on the contracting command\nlog. Mr. Cockerham testified that he had received the 2005 latrine and dumpster Claim\nand Settlement Offers twice, and that he does not know if Gulf Group’s initial\nsubmissions were logged, although they would have been placed in a box in the\ncontracting office. Although not clearly referring to plaintiff’s 2006 resubmissions, Mr.\nCockerham also testified that he made minimal efforts to ensure that Gulf Group’s Claim\n\nsecond amended complaint in the bottled water case. In plaintiff’s first amended\ncomplaint in the bottled water case, plaintiff simply listed the amount as 298,435.000 KD\nwithout a USD equivalent.\n40\n   As indicated below, it is not immediately clear that the 2005 submissions relating to\nthe terminations of the camp package BPA call, the latrine contract, and the dumpster\ncontract, constituted “claims” under the Contract Disputes Act. Defendant’s post-trial\nbriefs generically refer to plaintiff’s 2005 submissions as “claims,” but defendant initially\nargued that the Claim and Settlement Offers did not constitute claims under the\nContract Disputes Act. In discussing plaintiff’s submissions with respect to the court’s\njurisdiction under the Contract Disputes Act, therefore, the court distinguishes between\nthe “Claim and Settlement Offers” that plaintiff submitted in 2005, and the “claims” that\nplaintiff submitted in 2007 and 2011. The court includes the 2005 Claim and Settlement\nOffers in general references to “claims” elsewhere in this opinion, however, because the\n2005 submissions constitute claims in other contexts, such as under the False Claims\nAct. See 48 C.F.R. § 49.001 (2005) (“A settlement proposal is included within the\ngeneric meaning of the word ‘claim’ under false claims acts (see 18 U.S.C. 287 and 31\nU.S.C. 3729).”).\n41\n  The parties’ joint stipulation of facts lists plaintiff’s 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer as\nseeking $5,058,428.59. That is the full amount that plaintiff claimed it was owed, but\nplaintiff’s submission offered to settle for $4,558,428.60.\n42\n  In calculating plaintiff’s claimed entitlement to $5,058,428.59, plaintiff’s 2005 Claim\nand Settlement Offer appears to have used a different conversion rate between KD and\nUSD than the rate stipulated to by the parties.\n\n                                             32\n\fand Settlement Offers were processed, indicating that the “[o]nly thing I really remember\ndoing was just notifying the chief that this was the second time....”\n\n       The record is unclear as to whether the government ever reviewed plaintiff’s\n2005 Claim and Settlement Offers. Mr. Cockerham, however, confirmed at trial that he\nwrote the notations on the Claim and Settlement Offers that appear in the record\nrelating to the camp package BPA call, the latrine contract, and the dumpster contract,\nindicating that the Claim and Settlement Offers in the record are the Claim and\nSettlement Offers that Mr. Cockerham received on December 16, 2005, rather than the\ncopies of the Claim and Settlement Offers that plaintiff re-submitted between October\n20, 2006 and October 22, 2006. Although raising more questions than it addressed, Mr.\nLibbey’s contracting officer’s final decision for plaintiff’s 2007 camp package BPA claim\nattempted to explain what had happened to the 2005 Claim and Settlement Offers,\nstating:\n\n      The settlement offer [for the camp package BPA] was one of three\n      termination packages Major Cockerham allegedly received from Mr.\n      Surresh Pulikkal [sic] of Gulf Group43 in October 2005. Major Cockerham\n      allegedly signed for the three settlement proposals, and handed them off\n      to the Claims Section in the contracting office. These matters are\n      “alleged” as the Government has no evidence to establish these events\n      actually occurred. Major Cockerham and Gloria Davis, the awarding\n      contracting officer, came under investigation for improper and illegal\n      contracting activity after the subject contract was awarded....\n\n      Gulf Group representatives returned to the Contracting Command in late\n      November 2005 and again in December 2005 to check on the status of\n      the settlement offer. No record could be found that it had been submitted,\n      so Mr. Surresh Pulikkal [sic] was asked to resubmit the settlement offer.\n      Mr. Pulikkal subsequently gave a settlement offer to Major Cockerham,\n      who signed for it acknowledging receipt....\n\n      Gulf Group Representatives Saud Al Tawash and Allen Tadayon met with\n      LTC David Pershing, Commander, United States Army Contracting\n      Command, Southwest Asia-Kuwait (USACC), Major Marcellus Newson,\n      Contracting Officer, and Captain Andrew Gast, Contracting Claims Officer,\n      both of USACC, on or about 19 October 2006 to discuss the following\n      topics.... Concern over an earlier termination for convenience.... Their\n      settlement offers....\n\n\n\n43\n  Although defendant has repeatedly described Suresh Pulikkal as a Gulf Group\nemployee, Saud Al Tawash testified that Suresh Pulikkal was a legal consultant for a\nnumber of the companies that Saud Al Tawash managed, describing him as “our legal\ncounsel…a legal consultant.” Mr. Cockerham also confirmed that Suresh Pulikkal\n“worked with several companies.”\n\n                                           33\n\f      Mr. Tadayon asked about the settlement offer Gulf Group had submitted,\n      inquiring about its status. Captain Gast was directed by LTC Pershing\n      during the meeting to check his files for its status. Captain Gast checked\n      his file log for disputes and reported there was no record of any settlement\n      offers being filed by Gulf Group....\n\n      Captain Gast checked with other members of the Claims Team on 20\n      October 2006, specifically asking Major Paul Bidinger, Contracting Claims\n      Officer, Third Army, U.S. ARCENT, about the Gulf Group’s inquiry. Major\n      Bidinger reported back to Captain Gast the same day that he could not\n      find Gulf Group’s name on the disputes lists....\n\n      On 22 October 2006, Gulf Group representative Allen Tadayon provided\n      Captain Gast with a copy of the settlement offer by email. Captain Gast\n      reviewed the documents briefly and noted they were missing the required\n      certification....\n\n      On 22 October 2006, Mr. Tadayon emailed three “certifications” signed by\n      Gulf Group’s counsel to Captain Ghast [sic].\n\n      On 15 November 2006, Mr. Tadayon requested an appointment with\n      Captain Gast to discuss the settlement offer. Captain Gast responded on\n      16 November 2006 that the only appointments he was making was for\n      current disputes and ratifications he was working on....\n\n      Mr. Tadayon communicated again with Captain Gast on or about 17\n      November 2006 concerning the status of the three settlement offers.\n      Captain Gast stated he had not yet begun to work on them. This was the\n      last communication Captain Gast had with Gulf Group concerning its\n      documents.\n\n       It appears from Mr. Libbey’s summary of the events surrounding the submission\nof plaintiff’s 2005 Claim and Settlement Offers, and from Mr. Cockerham’s testimony\nregarding his receipt of plaintiff’s Claim and Settlement Offers, that plaintiff may also\nhave originally submitted the Claim and Settlement Offers to Mr. Cockerham in October\n2005, prior to the December 16, 2005 submissions in the record. That plaintiff\npreviously submitted the camp package BPA, latrine contract, and dumpster contract\nClaim and Settlement Offers is consistent with the October 2005 date that appears on\nthe cover letters to each submission.\n\n       Plaintiff interpreted the lack of a response to its 2005 submissions for almost a\nyear to be a deemed denial of its “claims” pursuant to 41 U.S.C. §§ 605(c)(1), (c)(3)\n(2005) (current versions at 41 U.S.C. § 7103(f)(1), (f)(3) (Supp. V 2011)).44 Based on\n44\n   In Case No. 06-835C, the camp package BPA case, plaintiff asserts that the sixty\ndays under 41 U.S.C. § 605 began to run on October 10, 2005. In Case No. 06-853C,\nthe dumpster case, plaintiff asserts that the sixty days began to run on October 20,\n\n                                           34\n\fthis perceived denial of its “claims,” Gulf Group ultimately filed the four suits which are\ncurrently consolidated before this court. The parties stipulated that, “[o]n December 8,\n2006, Gulf Group commenced [the camp package BPA case in the United States Court\nof Federal Claims] seeking $7,000,000.00, plus interest, costs, and attorney fees arising\nfrom the contracting officer’s deemed denial of its claim” for the cancellation of the camp\npackage BPA call. The parties also stipulated that, “[o]n December 15, 2006, Gulf\nGroup commenced [the latrine case in the United States Court of Federal Claims]\nseeking $6,000,000, plus interest, costs, and attorney fees arising from the termination”\nof the latrine contract. The parties further stipulated that, “[o]n December 19, 2006, Gulf\nGroup commenced [the dumpster case in the United States Court of Federal Claims]\nseeking $1,800,000, plus interest, costs, and attorney fees arising from the cancellation”\nof the dumpster contract. Finally, the parties stipulated that, “[o]n February 1, 2007,\nGulf Group commenced [the bottled water case in the United States Court of Federal\nClaims] seeking $1,035,802.23, plus interest, costs, and attorney fees arising from calls\nissued pursuant to” the bottled water BPA.\n\n        In the camp package BPA case, the latrine case, the dumpster case, and the\nbottled water BPA case, defendant requested that the judges initially assigned to each\ncase stay the proceedings in each case because defendant believed, with respect to\neach Claim and Settlement Offer, “that plaintiff’s submission constitute[d] a ‘termination\nsettlement offer,’” rather than a “claim” under the Contract Disputes Act, which,\naccording to defendant, deprived this court of jurisdiction over plaintiff’s complaints.\nThe judges initially assigned to the camp package BPA case, the latrine case, and the\ndumpster case, each agreed to stay the cases pending a decision by the contracting\nofficer on each of plaintiff’s “claims.”45 On March 26, 2007, Gulf Group presented\n“revised” claims to the contracting officer, certified by plaintiff’s replacement attorney,\nand current attorney of record, Ms. Iliaura Hands, for $7,000,000.00, $1,800,000.00,\nand $6,000,000.00, arising from the camp package BPA, the latrine contract, and the\ndumpster contract, respectively.46 In addition, Ms. Hands signed the cover letter to all of\n\n2005. In Case No. 06-858C, the latrine case, plaintiff references two dates, October 17,\n2005 and December 16, 2005, from which the sixty days could have run. In Case No.\n07-82C, the bottled water BPA case, plaintiff asserts that the agency’s sixty days began\nto run on December 15, 2005.\n45\n   The undersigned judge denied defendant’s request to stay the bottled water BPA\ncase. The bottled water BPA case did not involve a termination for convenience. With\nrespect to the 2005 bottled water BPA Claim and Settlement Offer, the language that\nplaintiff used in requesting a decision, and the context in which plaintiff’s submission\nwas made, indicated that plaintiff had asserted a “claim” under the Contract Disputes\nAct. The undersigned judge, however, subsequently stayed all four of the consolidated\ncases at the request of the United States Department of Justice because of related\nongoing criminal investigations and prosecutions.\n46\n   In its pleadings to the court, plaintiff submitted a different version of the revised claim\nfor the dumpster contract than the version of the revised claim that was admitted at trial.\nAlthough the differences between the versions are minimal, this discrepancy is one of\n\n                                             35\n\fthe revised claims. Each revised claim included a copy of the relevant 2005 Claim and\nSettlement Offer, which contained a cover letter that was signed by Saud Al Tawash,\nand which was certified by plaintiff’s previous attorney, Ferdinand Peters.\n\n       On May 21, 2007, Joseph Libbey reviewed Gulf Group’s revised claims and\nissued final decisions on the revised camp package BPA, latrine contract, and dumpster\ncontract claims. Mr. Libbey awarded Gulf Group $33,053.57, $149,285.71, and\n$57,833.00, plus interest, for its camp package BPA, latrine contract, and dumpster\ncontract claims, respectively. The parties stipulated that “Mr. Libbey did not interview\nanyone in preparation of the final decisions.” Randall Kemplin, a civilian attorney for the\nArmy, wrote portions of the final decision from information he received from Army\nattorney Clea Efthimiadis, who, in turn, obtained information on the terminations of Gulf\nGroup’s contracts from Col. Brick Miller, Tijani Saani, and Mr. Cockerham.47\n\n        After Mr. Libbey issued his contracting officer’s final decisions, Gulf Group filed\namended complaints before this court in each of the three cases he addressed, the\ncamp package BPA and the latrine and dumpster contracts. The original complaint in\nthe bottled water BPA case was also subsequently amended. In its amended\ncomplaints, plaintiff altered the amounts sought in each case, except the bottled water\nBPA case, the only case on which Mr. Libbey did not issue a contracting officer’s final\ndecision. In its original complaint in Case No. 06-835C, the camp package BPA case,\nplaintiff sought $7,000,000.00. In its first amended complaint in the camp package BPA\ncase, plaintiff sought $2,682,160.86.48 In its second amended complaint in the camp\npackage BPA case, plaintiff sought $3,463,287.57.49 Subsequently, in its third\n\n\n\n\nnumerous deficiencies in plaintiff’s submissions to the court. Additionally, as discussed\nbelow with respect to the dumpster contract, the copy of Saud Al Tawash’s signature\npage from the 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer is dated October 20, 2004.\n47\n Ms. Efthimiadis testified that she did not contact Col. Hess regarding plaintiff’s claims.\nWhen questioned, Ms. Efthimiadis stated:\n\n      I was in the middle of starting the litigation report, I did not complete the\n      litigation report. I did not interview all the witnesses or take even written\n      statements from them as is required in [sic] litigation report. The uptempo\n      in Kuwait was tremendous, the workload was tremendous at that time.\n48\n   Plaintiff sought $1,447,457.22 in lost profits, $1,234,703.64 in preparatory expenses,\nlegal fees, costs incurred in preparing a settlement of plaintiff’s claims, and interest.\n49\n   Plaintiff sought $3,387,247.64 in lost profits, $69,002.43 in preparatory expenses,\n$7,037.50 in fees and costs incurred in preparing the settlement for plaintiff’s claims,\nprejudgment interest, cost of litigation, and attorneys’ fees.\n\n\n                                            36\n\famended complaint in the camp package BPA case, plaintiff now seeks $922,851.84.50\nIn 2011, plaintiff submitted a second revised claim for the camp package BPA to Maj.\nDaniel Everett,51 which mirrored the amounts plaintiff claimed in its third amended\ncomplaint. In its original complaint in Case No. 06-858C, the latrine case, plaintiff\nsought $6,000,000.00. In its first amended complaint in the latrine case, plaintiff sought\n1,572,967.611 KD.52 In its second amended complaint in the latrine case, plaintiff now\nseeks $2,830,662.20.53 In its original complaint in Case No. 06-853C, the dumpster\ncase, plaintiff sought $1,800,000.00. In its first amended complaint in the dumpster\ncase, plaintiff sought $1,946,721.78.54 In its second amended complaint in the\ndumpster case, plaintiff now seeks $780,031.63.55 In its original complaint in Case No.\n07-82C, the bottled water BPA case, plaintiff sought 298,435.000 KD, calculated as\n$1,035,802.23. In its first amended complaint in the bottled water BPA case, plaintiff\nsought 298,435.000 KD. In its second amended complaint in the bottled water BPA\ncase, plaintiff now seeks 298,435.000 KD, calculated as $1,065,711.39, for demurrage\nand related expenses.56\n\n    The total potential contract prices and the amounts claimed by Gulf Group can be\nsummarized as follows:\n50\n   Plaintiff seeks $846,811.91 in lost profits, $69,002.43 in preparatory expenses,\n$7,037.50 in fees and other costs, prejudgment interest, costs of litigation and attorneys’\nfees.\n51\n   Contrary to plaintiff’s assertion that the judge directed plaintiff to submit a revised\nclaim to Maj. Everett, a member of the Army JAG Corps assisting defendant, the court\ndirected plaintiff to file revisions to any of the complaints filed in the four above-\ncaptioned cases, if appropriate.\n52\n   Plaintiff sought 1,416,360.000 KD in lost profits, 156,607.611 KD in preparatory\nexpenses, legal fees, costs incurred in preparing a settlement of plaintiff’s claims, and\ninterest. Plaintiff did not convert the amount to USD.\n53\n   Plaintiff seeks $2,724,795.96 in lost profits, $91,978.74 in preparatory expenses,\n$13,887.50 in fees and other costs, plus prejudgment interest, costs of litigation and\nattorneys’ fees.\n54\n   Plaintiff sought $1,457,619.72 in lost profits, $489,102.06 in preparatory expenses,\nlegal fees, costs incurred in preparing the settlement of the claims, and interest.\n55\n   Plaintiff asserts in its second amended complaint in the dumpster case that it seeks\n$780,131.63, but the total of the various amounts listed by plaintiff is only $780,031.63.\nPlaintiff seeks $483,322.42 in lost profits, $282,871.71 for preparatory expenses,\n$13,837.50 for fees and other costs, prejudgment interest, costs of litigation and\nattorneys’ fees.\n56\n  It appears that plaintiff’s original complaint used a different currency conversion rate\nthan the currency conversion rate stipulated to by the parties.\n\n                                            37\n\fBPA/Contract         Maximum          2005 Claim &        2007 Claim     2011 Claim      Original      Additional\n                   Potential Price   Settlement Offer                                   Complaint      Complaints\n\nCamp               BPA Limit:        Claimed             $7,000,000.00   $922,851.84   $7,000,000.00   1st Amended:\nPackage            $10,000,000.00    Entitlement:                                                      $2,682,160.86\n                                     $10,000,000.0057\n                   Call Limit:                                                                         2d Amended:\n                   $7,000,000.00     Settlement Offer:                                                 $3,463,287.57\n                                     $4,544,339.84\n                   Call 0001                                                                           3d Amended:\n                   Price:                                                                              $922,851.84\n                   $1,447,457.22\n\nLatrine            Total:            Claimed             $6,000,000.00   N/A           $6,000,000.00   1st Amended:\n                   $5,057,895.14     Entitlement:                                                      1,572,967.611\n                                     $5,058,428.59                                                     KD\n                   Base Period:\n                   $613,142.86       Settlement Offer:                                                 2d Amended:\n                                     $4,558,428.60                                                     $2,830,662.20\n\n\nDumpster           Total:            Claimed             $1,800,000.00   N/A           $1,800,000.00   1st Amended:\n                   $1,457,619.72     Entitlement:                                                      $1,946,721.78\n                                     $1,110,621.7258\n                   Base Period:                                                                        2d Amended:\n                   $346,998.00       Settlement Offer:                                                 $780,031.63\n                                     $999,994.67\n\nBottled Water      BPA Limit:        298,435 KD          N/A             N/A           298,435 KD      1st Amended:\n                   $10,000,000.00                                                      calculated at   298,435 KD\n                                                                                       $1,035,802.23\n                   Call Limit:                                                                         2d Amended:\n                   $7,000,000.00                                                                       298,435 KD\n                                                                                                       calculated at\n                                                                                                       $1,065,711.39\n\n          57\n             Mr. Peters testified that he did not remember if the 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer\n          for the camp package BPA claimed entitlement to $10,000,000.00, but later testified that\n          the 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer did not claim entitlement to $10,000,000.00,\n          guessing it claimed entitlement to $5,000,000.00. The only number that is referenced in\n          the Claim and Settlement Offer other than the amount of plaintiff’s settlement proposal\n          is the $10,000,000.00 figure. In this column, the court refers to the “claimed” amount as\n          the amount to which plaintiff stated it was entitled in the claim, other than the settlement\n          offer.\n          58\n            According to Mr. Peters, only the option periods were added to the dumpster contract\n          Claim and Settlement Offer, without the base period. The dumpster contract Claim and\n          Settlement Offer, however, asserted entitlement to the total contract price. Including the\n          base period, the amount to which plaintiff appeared to assert it was entitled was\n          $1,457,619.72.\n\n                                                          38\n\f       The 2005 Claim and Settlement Offers for the camp package BPA and latrine\nand dumpster contracts included settlement offers lower than the total amount to which\nGulf Group believed it was entitled, which, notwithstanding an apparent omission of the\nbase period price in the dumpster Claim and Settlement Offer, the Claim and Settlement\nOffers included the price of the base period and all option periods for the latrine and\ndumpster contracts. Gulf Group’s camp package BPA, latrine, and dumpster Claim and\nSettlement Offers described the total potential awards as “contract costs...added to the\nanticipated contract profit.”59 Saud Al Tawash indicated that he believed Gulf Group\nwould have performed the option periods on the latrine contract because Camp Arifjan\nwas permanent and there would be a need beyond the base period for Gulf Group’s\nservices. Saud Al Tawash further testified that Maj. Davis informed Gulf Group that, if\nthey performed well on the latrine contract, they would be completing the full potential\nperiod of the contract, including all of the option periods. Saud Al Tawash also\nexplained that he expected to perform the option periods of the latrine contract because\nthe capital expenditures necessary to acquire the materials and equipment needed to\nperform the contract would not have been covered by the base period alone.60\nAccording to Saud Al Tawash, he also understood the period of performance on the\ndumpster contract to be for three years because Maj. Davis told him Camp Arifjan was a\npermanent camp and that, if Gulf Group performed well, then they would have the\ncontract for the full three-year term, inclusive of the base period and all of the option\nperiods. When asked whether Gulf Group understood it was not guaranteed the option\nperiods, Saud Al Tawash explained on cross examination:\n\n        A: No, we didn’t understand if we were guaranteed -- to be given\n        guaranteed or not guaranteed? We did not understand that.\n\n        Q: What was Gulf Group’s understanding with regard to the option\n        period?\n\n        A: We had no understanding. We understood that this contract starts\n        from this day and finishes from this day. That was our understanding.\n\n\n\n59\n   At times, plaintiff appears to indicate in its post-trial briefs that it did not separately\nseek costs in its submissions to the contracting officer. Plaintiff’s 2005 Claim and\nSettlement Offers for the camp package BPA, the latrine contract, and the dumpster\ncontract, however, stated that “[t]his offer includes reimbursement for both costs and\nlost profits” and that “Gulf Enterprises should also be compensated fully for the costs\nincurred in furtherance of the contract.” In both its 2005 submissions to the contracting\nofficer and the 2006 complaints filed in this court, therefore, plaintiff sought lost profits\nand costs as a result of defendant’s alleged breach of the camp package BPA call, the\nlatrine contract, and the dumpster contract.\n60\n   As discussed below, plaintiff’s lost profits calculation indicates that plaintiff’s costs\nwould have exceeded its profits for the base period of the dumpster contract, rather\nthan the latrine contract.\n\n                                             39\n\f        Q: When you say start this date and ends this date, you’re talking about\n        the base period?\n\n        A: Talking about the contract overall period which is from A through Z, the\n        duration of the contract itself.\n\n        Q: Are you saying you didn’t understand that there were option periods in\n        the contract?\n\n        A: I believed that the understanding we had at that time was that the\n        contract is the contract in a normal sense, the base period. We did not\n        understand this options that reflect in like a contract within a contract.\n        We did not understand that. Now we are understanding that this is quite\n        different from our understanding from that time. In Kuwait most waste\n        management contracts are for three years, municipal. So this contract\n        being two to three years, we thought that this is the time that we have to\n        perform the contract.\n\n      An August 20, 2004 Memorandum titled, “Determination and Findings Use of\nOptions,” signed by Maj. Davis, stated:\n\n       Upon the basis of the following findings and determinations which I hereby\n       make, the Dumpster Service contract requires the use of options as\n       defined by FAR 17.202, Use of Options.... It is in the Government’s best\n       interest to include these options. There is an anticipated need for the\n       service beyond the contract period and the government risks potential\n       costs of disrupted support in re-competing the contract.... There is a\n       reasonable likelihood that the options will be exercised.\n\nThe memorandum was not circulated to contractors, including Gulf Group. At trial,\nSaud Al Tawash did not remember if he had seen the document before, but stated that\nit confirmed his understanding of what Maj. Davis had told him at the time of contract\naward.\n\n        Gulf Group’s first attorney, Ferdinand Peters, testified that he believed the Army\nowed Gulf Group for the option periods and included them in the 2005 Claim and\nSettlement Offers. Attorney Peters testified that his legal research indicated that plaintiff\nwas entitled to lost profits, and that he believed there was a sound basis for claiming\nlost profits for both the base periods and the option periods, without deducting expenses\nfor the base period or the option periods. Attorney Peters further stated that the lost\nprofits were the total contract price.61 Terry Carlson, an expert in government contract\n61\n  Under cross-examination, government counsel asked Mr. Peters, “you testified earlier\nthat you got the amount of lost profits by summing up the values that appeared in all\noption periods; is that right?” Mr. Peters replied: “Right. It is clearly stated. We even\nchose the lines from the government contracts where they came from.”\n\n                                             40\n\faccounting hired by Gulf Group to determine lost profit calculations on Gulf Group’s\ncamp package BPA, latrine, and dumpster claims, also included the base period and all\noptions periods when determining lost profits on the camp package BPA call, latrine\ncontract, and dumpster contract. Mr. Carlson testified that his calculations were\nreasonable, accurate, and correct based on a good faith effort to account for every\nsingle item of costs, and that option periods were reasonably included in the 2005 Claim\nand Settlement Offers.\n\n       Although Saud Al Tawash and Attorney Peters testified that the 2005 Claim and\nSettlement Offers were based on the base period and option periods, included in each\nClaim and Settlement Offer was an expense table, which Saud Al Tawash and Mr.\nPeters testified was only incorporated to show that Gulf Group was prepared to perform,\nand not to claim that Gulf Group had actually incurred all of the expenses listed. Mr.\nPeters testified that he could not calculate projected costs and, thus, did not include the\nexpense tables to suggest such costs as a basis for the amounts claimed, because\nthere had not been any performance. Attorney Peters also testified that he “didn’t put\nany costs in because I didn’t have any cost data.... And I felt that if the government was\nusing bad faith to terminate these agreements, then they should pay everything, and\nthat was a legitimate basis for the claim.”\n\n        In the 2005 camp package BPA Claim and Settlement Offer, Gulf Group listed in\nthe expense table, in Kuwaiti dinars, 12,200.000 KD for sixty-one dumpsters,\n28,000.000 KD for two vacuum tankers, 22,945.000 KD for a tower light system,\n241,962.000 KD for tents, 3,490.000 KD for electric generators, 22,120.000 KD for one\nhundred fifty-eight latrines, and 15,000.000 KD for a potable water truck. The 2005\nlatrine Claim and Settlement Offer expense table listed as expenses, in Kuwaiti dinars,\n14,437.359 KD for one hundred fifty-nine drop tanks, 36,984.985 KD for shipment\nexpenses, 11,478.000 KD for equipment leasing and services, 3,805.000 KD for truck\nrentals, 31,300.000 KD for agreements for specialized labor and equipment,\n19,195.126 KD for installation, management, and consulting, 1,014.500 KD for\nmiscellaneous costs, and 153,900.00 in Euros for six hundred drop tanks.62 The 2005\ndumpster Claim and Settlement Offer’s expense table included, in Kuwaiti dinars,\n127,740.000 KD for a dumpster container purchase, 72,000.000 KD for subcontracting\npapers, invoices, and receipts for dumpster service, and 761.200 KD in miscellaneous\npayments. Also included in each Claim and Settlement Offer was a copy of purchase\norders and invoices for some, but not all, of the items listed in each expense table.\n\n        Of the items listed in the expense tables, Gulf Group subsequently maintained\nthat it purchased one tower light, one tent, one generator, and fifty dumpsters for the\ncamp package BPA call, which it reflected in a 2011 notice to the court. Regarding the\n2005 camp package BPA Claim and Settlement Offer, Saud Al Tawash testified that the\nArmy would have understood Gulf Group was not submitting the expense table as a\nbasis for the amounts listed in the Claim and Settlement Offer because “[t]here was [sic]\nno receipt vouchers, no checks, no wire transfers for the PO’s [Purchase Order’s] that\n62\n  The claim lists a total of 171,044.970 KD, which purportedly includes the 153,900.00\nEuro expense.\n\n                                            41\n\fhave been not purchased.” The contract for the latrines required only six hundred\nlatrines, and Saud Al Tawash testified that the seven hundred fifty-nine latrines listed in\nthe 2005 latrine Claim and Settlement Offer’s expense table was a mistake made by\nGulf Group’s accounting department. Gulf Group eventually revised its latrine Claim\nand Settlement Offer to reflect the purchase of only four hundred latrines. Saud Al\nTawash explained that Gulf Group had taken mitigation efforts to sell many of the\nlatrines, reducing its actual costs from the costs shown in the 2005 expense table.\nWhen questioned about the latrine Claim and Settlement Offer, Mr. Peters\nacknowledged that the terminology he had used was “a little bit misleading.” Mr. Peters\nstated that he understood at the time that Gulf Group had obligated itself to buy the\nitems listed in the expense table, not that Gulf Group had actually made the purchases.\nMr. Peters stated, however, that he did not intend for the expense tables to be\nconsidered a basis for the amount submitted in the latrine Claim and Settlement Offer.\nMr. Peters also testified, “I admit this is pretty aggressive in what we are going for here,\nbut I had a bad faith situation, and a bad faith termination. So there was no reason not\nbe aggressive with the military.” Mr. Peters indicated that he expected the latrine Claim\nand Settlement Offer would be a starting point for settlement negotiations with the Army.\nGulf Group also revised its claim for the dumpster contract, reducing the contract\npreparatory expenses to 59,927.871 KD. The 2005 expense table for the dumpster\nClaim and Settlement Offer showed expenses of 200,501.220 KD.\n\n       When asked why the 2005 Claim and Settlement Offers on the camp package\nBPA and latrine and dumpster contracts were revised in the 2007 revised claims and in\nthe complaints filed in this court, Saud Al Tawash testified that he relied on the advice of\nboth attorneys Gulf Group hired to assist Gulf Group in putting together submissions for\nthe contracting officer and the court. He stated that the complaints were “revised\nbecause we saw errors in the first claim, in the initial claim, and we seeked [sic] help\nfrom a U.S. CPA [Certified Public Accountant], who helped us determine what would be\nthe best way to -- the best method and the acceptable method by the U.S. government\nstandards to file a revised claim.” Saud Al Tawash stated that Gulf Group believed\n“[w]e are entitled to what we are [sic] deserved,” but admitted that Gulf Group had made\nsome mistakes with respect to the various amounts that it claimed.\n\n       Although Saud Al Tawash recognized that he had signed the cover pages to the\n2005 Claim and Settlement Offers, he indicated that he did not look at the various\nsubmissions in detail until his deposition. He stated that he had trusted Attorney Peters\nto prepare the Claim and Settlement Offers properly, and that he glanced at the cover\npage of each Claim and Settlement Offer before signing it, but did not understand all of\nthe technical matters therein about the law and accounting. Saud Al Tawash stated that\nhe considered it the responsibility of everyone involved with the various submissions to\nthe contracting officer to ensure that the submissions were accurate. Saud Al Tawash\nexplained that he followed Attorney Peters’ recommendations because he had never\nfiled a claim with the United States government before and did not understand the\nprocess. Finally, Saud Al Tawash stated that he believed that the amounts claimed\nwere correct at the time they were originally presented. Yet, when questioned at trial,\nSaud Al Tawash did not know why Gulf Group claimed more than the full price of the\n\n\n                                            42\n\flatrine and dumpster contracts in its 2007 revised claims. In 2007, Gulf Group claimed\n$6,000,000.00 pursuant to the latrine contract, although the latrine contract, including all\nof the option periods, was worth only $5,057,895.14. Similarly, the dumpster contract,\nincluding all the option periods, was worth up to $1,457,619.72, but Gulf Group claimed\n$1,800,000.00 in 2007.\n\n        Regarding Gulf Group’s bottled water BPA demurrage claim, Saud Al Tawash\ntestified that the 85.000 KD/day demurrage expenses were the result of various costs,\nincluding the fees charged by its trucking company, Expeditors, for each of the 3,511\ndays of delay, but also other fees related to the delays, such as insurance for the water,\ntemporary storage, loading and unloading, salaries, vehicles, staging area, and local\ntransportation charges. The water had to be stored for climate and security reasons\nwhile Gulf Group awaited the next convoy. Saud Al Tawash testified that, although Gulf\nGroup’s demurrage claim was denied, he believed that the Army had awarded costs for\nother contractors’ demurrage expenses. The parties stipulated that, “[s]ometime prior to\nDecember 24, 2004 another contractor supplying bottled water to the US Government in\nIraq, StarCon Ltd., submitted a claim for demurrage expenses incurred from delays of\nthe convoys,” which was approved by the issuance of a BPA call on December 24,\n2004. According to Mr. Cockerham, the Army also awarded demurrage to a company\nidentified as IAP. Mr. Cockerham testified that there were, on average, two demurrage\nclaims submitted each week around April 2005, and that, in total, hundreds of\ndemurrage claims were submitted. Mr. Cockerham recalled the government policy on\ndemurrage being that the Army would pay if a truck was held seven days past the\nrequired time given for delivery, including reimbursement for offloading, storage,\nreloading, and delays at the government’s port.\n\nCertifications\n\nCamp Package BPA\n\n      With respect to the camp package BPA, Saud Al Tawash signed the October 10,\n2005 cover letter to plaintiff’s Claim and Settlement Offer. Mr. Peters certified the Claim\nand Settlement Offer. Plaintiff included an unsigned copy of Standard Form 1436 in its\nClaim and Settlement Offer. Standard Form 1436, which is titled “Settlement Proposal\n(Total Cost Basis),” contains the following statement under the heading\n“CERTIFICATE:”\n\n       (a) AS TO THE CONTRACTOR’S OWN CHARGES. The proposed\n       settlement (exclusive of charges set forth in Item 14) and supporting\n       schedules and explanations have been prepared from the books of\n       account and records of the Contractor in accordance with recognized\n       commercial accounting practices; they include only those charges\n       allocable to the terminated portion of this contract; they have been\n       prepared with knowledge that they will, or may, be used directly or\n       indirectly as the basis of settlement of a termination settlement proposal or\n\n\n\n                                            43\n\f      claim against an agency of the United States; and the charges as stated\n      are fair and reasonable.\n\n48 C.F.R. 53.301–1436 (2005) (emphasis in original). The signature block of the form\ncontains the phrase “BY (Signature of authorized official).” Id. (emphasis in original).\nBoth the 2005 camp package BPA Claim and Settlement Offer and the Standard Form\n1436 included in the submission sought $4,544,399.84. Ms. Hands signed the cover\nletter and certification to plaintiff’s 2007 revised camp package BPA claim.63 Plaintiff’s\n2007 revised claim requested $7,000,000.00. Although plaintiff attached its 2005 Claim\nand Settlement Offer to its 2007 revised claim, plaintiff inexplicably replaced the\nunsigned copy of Standard Form 1436 included in its 2005 camp package BPA Claim\nand Settlement Offer with a signed copy of the Standard Form 1436 included in\nplaintiff’s 2005 dumpster Claim and Settlement Offer. Plaintiff submitted a second\nrevised camp package BPA claim to Maj. Everett on April 12, 2011. Plaintiff’s second\nrevised claim sought $922,851.84 and was similarly certified by Ms. Hands.\n\nLatrine Contract\n\n       With respect to the latrine contract, Saud Al Tawash signed the October 17, 2005\ncover letter to the Claim and Settlement Offer. Attorney Peters certified the 2005 Claim\nand Settlement Offer. Saud Al Tawash’s signature, dated October 17, 2004,64 appears\n63\n   The language that Ms. Hands used to certify plaintiff’s 2007 revised claim deviates\nfrom the language set forth in the Contract Disputes Act and the FAR implementing\nregulations. Ms. Hands’ certification states:\n\n      I hereby certify that the claim herein is made in good faith and that the\n      supporting data submitted is accurate and complete to the best of my\n      knowledge and belief, that the amount requested herein accurately\n      reflects the contract adjustment for which the contractor believes the US\n      Government is liable, and that I am duly authorized to certify the claim on\n      behalf of the contractor, Gulf Group General Enterprises, Co. W.L.L. as its\n      attorney in fact.\n\nThe Contract Disputes Act and the FAR implementing regulations prescribe the\nfollowing language:\n\n      I certify that the claim is made in good faith; that the supporting data are\n      accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that the\n      amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which\n      the contractor believes the Government is liable; and that I am duly\n      authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the contractor.\n\nSee 48 C.F.R. § 33.207 (2005).\n64\n  Saud Al Tawash appears to have erroneously indicated that he signed the Standard\nForm included in plaintiff’s latrine Claim and Settlement Offer in 2004, rather than 2005.\n\n                                           44\n\fon the Standard Form 1436 included in the Claim and Settlement Offer. Both the Claim\nand Settlement Offer and the Standard Form 1436 included in the Claim and Settlement\nOffer seek $4,558,428.60. Ms. Hands signed the cover letter and certification to\nplaintiff’s 2007 revised latrine claim.65   Plaintiff’s 2007 revised claim requests\n$6,000,000.00. The Standard Form 1436 included with plaintiff’s 2007 revised claim is\nidentical to the copy of the Standard Form 1436 included in plaintiff’s 2005 Claim and\nSettlement Offer.\n\nDumpster Contract\n\n        With respect to the dumpster contract, Saud Al Tawash signed the October 20,\n2005 cover letter to the Claim and Settlement Offer. Attorney Peters certified the 2005\nClaim and Settlement Offer. The stand-alone copies of plaintiff’s Claim and Settlement\nOffer that appear in the record include an unsigned copy of Standard Form 1436. Both\nthe Claim and Settlement Offer and the Standard Form 1436 included in the Claim and\nSettlement Offer sought $999,994.67. Ms. Hands signed the cover letter and\ncertification to plaintiff’s 2007 revised dumpster claim.66 Plaintiff’s 2007 revised claim\nrequested $1,800,000.00. The Standard Form 1436 that plaintiff included in its 2007\nrevised claim appears to be a copy of the Standard Form 1436 included in plaintiff’s\n2005 Claim and Settlement Offer, except that the copy included in plaintiff’s 2007\nrevised claim contains Saud Al Tawash’s signature, dated October 20, 2004.67\n\nBottled Water BPA\n\n       With respect to the bottled water BPA, Saud Al Tawash signed the December 1,\n2005 cover letter to the Claim and Settlement Offer. Attorney Peters certified plaintiff’s\n2005 Claim and Settlement Offer.68 Saud Al Tawash’s signature, dated December 1,\n2005, appears on the Standard Form 1436 included in plaintiff’s 2005 Claim and\nSettlement Offer. Both the 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer and the Standard Form\n1436 included in the claim seek 298,435.000 KD. Plaintiff did not submit a revised\nbottled water BPA claim.\n\n65\n   The language that Ms. Hands used to certify plaintiff’s 2007 revised latrine claim\nsimilarly deviates from the language prescribed by the Contract Disputes Act and the\nFAR implementing regulations.\n66\n  The language that Ms. Hands used to certify plaintiff’s 2007 revised dumpster claim\nsimilarly deviates from the language prescribed by the Contract Disputes Act and the\nFAR implementing regulations.\n67\n  Saud Al Tawash appears to have erroneously indicated that he signed the Standard\nForm included in plaintiff’s dumpster claim in 2004, rather than 2005.\n68\n   At trial, the parties failed to introduce a signed copy of plaintiff’s 2005 bottled water\nBPA Claim and Settlement Offer and the corresponding Standard Form 1436. Plaintiff\nincluded a signed copy of both forms in its original complaint.\n\n                                            45\n\fJohn Cockerham and Carolyn Blake\n\n        John Cockerham and Carolyn Blake each testified in the above-captioned\nconsolidated cases in San Antonio, Texas.69 When they testified before this court they\nwere both incarcerated and serving federal, criminal prison sentences. The parties\nstipulated that Mr. Cockerham was a member of the Army procurement team in Kuwait\nand was introduced to Saud Al Tawash at Saud Al Tawash’s home in Kuwait in 2002.\nSaud Al Tawash testified that he first met Mr. Cockerham in 2002 or 2003 in the\n“Diwanya”70 at his house. Mr. Cockerham testified that he believes, however, he was\nbriefly introduced to Saud Al Tawash by a “Mr. Eli or Elias” during one of his earlier\ntours of Kuwait at the end of 2002 at a Ramadan “social dinner.” Mr. Cockerham also\ntestified that he has been to dinner at Saud Al Tawash’s house twice. According to Mr.\nCockerham’s testimony at trial, he thought of, and still thinks of, Saud Al Tawash as a\nfriend. Saud Al Tawash testified that Mr. Cockerham and Mr. Cockerham’s wife\nattended Saud Al Tawash’s wedding on February 4, 2006, in New Orleans, Louisiana.\nMr. Cockerham also testified that he was the only person from the Army contracting\noffice who attended Saud Al Tawash’s wedding. Saud Al Tawash and Joanne Hands,\nSaud Al Tawash’s fiancé at the time, now wife, also visited Mr. Cockerham at his home\nin San Antonio, Texas, in the spring of 2005 to congratulate Mr. Cockerham on the birth\nof his daughter, and brought toys for Mr. Cockerham’s children. Joanne Hands testified\nthat she remembers Saud Al Tawash saying “a friend or something had a baby,” and\nthat she first met Mr. Cockerham at this visit to his house where they had conversations\nlike one would have with a friend.\n\n        Saud Al Tawash described Mr. Cockerham as an “older acquaintance” with\nwhom he had a “professional relationship.” Saud Al Tawash stated that the only social\nactivity he engaged in with Mr. Cockerham in September or October of 2004 was in the\n“Diwanya.” Saud Al Tawash also testified to hosting a change-over ceremony for Mr.\nCockerham at the end of 2005, in which Mr. Cockerham received a small wooden\nsouvenir boat, because Mr. Cockerham was leaving Kuwait. Saud Al Tawash testified\nthat a number of Army contracting officers and Carolyn Blake, Mr. Cockerham’s sister,\nwere in attendance. According to Saud Al Tawash, “[i]t’s a common practice in Kuwait\nwhen a new group -- an old group leaves and a new group comes in that we have these\nchange-over ceremonies.” According to Mr. Cockerham, he believes the last time he\nsaw Saud Al Tawash was for “a quick lunch” in Austin, Texas, in March or April of 2006.\n\n\n\n69\n   Throughout the testimony of Mr. Cockerham, and especially Ms. Blake, there were\nmany inconsistencies and numerous memory lapses. Unfortunately, the same was true\nfor some of the government witnesses, such as Col. Miller and Col. Hess. Although\nthere were some inconsistencies in Saud Al Tawash’s testimony, he struck the court as\nsincerely trying accurately to recall the events of 2004 and 2005.\n70\n   Saud Al Tawash testified that a “Diwanya” (which he spelled out for the court reporter)\nis an “open door,” and “you could receive strangers coming to a Diwanya because\nusually Diwanya is not inside the house, the main quarters of houses.”\n\n                                           46\n\f       In 2004, Saud Al Tawash met Carolyn Blake, Mr. Cockerham’s sister, in Kuwait.\nAccording to Ms. Blake, she went to Kuwait after she had contacted her sister-in-law,\nMr. Cockerham’s wife, to ask Mr. Cockerham if they were hiring females in Kuwait. Mr.\nCockerham recommended that Ms. Blake visit Kuwait to see if the culture was\namenable to her. Ms. Blake’s first trip to Kuwait was from August 16, 2004 through\nAugust 22, 2004. According to Ms. Blake, Mr. Cockerham picked her up at the airport\nwith Diaa Salem, who was identified as the owner of Jasmine, and Diaa Salem gave her\nan amount of Kuwaiti dinars, but the testimony is unclear as to whether the amount was\n500.000 KD or an amount equal to $500.00. Ms. Blake testified that she was under the\nimpression that Mr. Cockerham and Diaa Salem talked about her working for Saud Al\nTawash. Ms. Blake also testified that during this visit, Mr. Cockerham was trying to\narrange an interview at Camp Arifjan for a clerical position.\n\n        The testimony is not clear as to when Saud Al Tawash met Ms. Blake for the first\ntime and if Saud Al Tawash knew she was Mr. Cockerham’s sister at the time, although\nthe parties stipulated that Saud Al Tawash met Ms. Blake for the first time in Kuwait,\nwhen Mr. Cockerham introduced her as his sister and mentioned that she was\nsearching for a job. According to Ms. Blake, she believed that when she first arrived in\nKuwait, Saud Al Tawash knew that she and Mr. Cockerham “were family.” Ms. Blake\ntestified that her first introduction to Saud Al Tawash occurred at the Crowne Plaza\nhotel where she was staying. Ms. Blake testified that she had never heard of Saud Al\nTawash, Gulf Telecom, Gulf Group, or Palm Springs71 before arriving in Kuwait on\nAugust 16, 2004. Mr. Cockerham testified that he was not aware that Saud Al Tawash\nwas interested in hiring expatriates prior to Ms. Blake’s move to Kuwait, and that he\nbelieves Saud Al Tawash first met Ms. Blake at Camp Doha, Kuwait, when she was\ngiven a temporary badge. According to Saud Al Tawash, Mr. Cockerham referred to\nMs. Blake as “Sis” when they were first introduced, but Saud Al Tawash indicated he did\nnot realize that Ms. Blake was Mr. Cockerham’s sister until she later returned to Kuwait\nfor work.\n\n       Ms. Blake testified that she told Saud Al Tawash during her first visit to Kuwait\nthat she wanted to come back to Kuwait to work there. According to Saud Al Tawash,\nafter Ms. Blake returned to the United States, Saud Al Tawash offered her a job as a\n“marketing consultant” for Gulf Telecom call centers, which Ms. Blake accepted. Ms.\nBlake testified that when she returned to Kuwait:\n\n      I believe it was Mr. Al Tawash or his brother Michel [sic]. I think they were\n      trying to help me find employment, so John [Cockerham] got them to help\n      me, more or less like, to pay for an apartment or something like that until I\n      could find a job and then after not being able to find a job, then, Saud\n      talked more about well he would just try to hire me and find a position or\n      make a position for me and he would just try to set it up as me being a\n      consultant.\n71\n    According to the parties’ joint stipulation of facts, “[i]n July 2005, Mr. [Saud] Al\nTawash became the sole owner of Palm Springs General Trading and Contracting\nEstablishment (‘Palm Springs’).”\n\n                                           47\n\f        According to Saud Al Tawash, the job offer to Ms. Blake was an offer with the\nsame benefits as those given to other Americans working for Gulf Telecom. Saud Al\nTawash testified that these benefits included “housing, travel allowance or tickets,\ntuition and vehicle, phone.” Saud Al Tawash gave the following explanation of Ms.\nBlake’s qualifications: “She’s an American. She understands the culture very well of the\nmilitary. She understands the American culture. She knows the holidays. She’s\nsomebody who has experience with that environment,” and “[s]he’s American citizen\nand clients are Americans. She’s ex-military; she has retail experience; she has\nexperience in security as a guard and she has the personality to -- the attitude, for this\nparticular position. She’s educated. She has a degree. She has also a -- quite a good\nknowledge of the different demographics and segments of the military.” Immediately\nprior to accepting Gulf Telecom’s job offer, Ms. Blake was employed in the United\nStates as both an assistant school teacher and a shopping mall security guard. Ms.\nBlake testified that she also had worked as a clerk in a gas station. Mr. Cockerham\ntestified that Saud Al Tawash hired Ms. Blake as an “English speaking liaison” and to do\n“some office work and research work” and that both Ms. Blake and Saud Al Tawash told\nhim that Ms. Blake was doing administrative paperwork for Saud Al Tawash. Mr.\nCockerham also indicated that Ms. Blake had military training and experience, which is\nlisted on the résumé that Ms. Blake prepared in 2006 or 2007, although not on the\nrésumé that appears to have been prepared prior to working for Gulf Telecom.\n\n        According to Saud Al Tawash, Ms. Blake’s position had been open to others and\nhe had interviewed other individuals for the job, but he did not remember the names of\nthe other candidates. Saud Al Tawash testified that he did not believe it was a conflict\nof interest to hire Ms. Blake “because she was not working on any contracts then or\nafter.” Saud Al Tawash testified that he did not tell Mr. Cockerham that he had hired\nMs. Blake, although Ms. Blake testified that Mr. Cockerham knew that the Al Tawash\nfamily was trying to help her get a job. Mr. Cockerham testified that Ms. Blake told him\nthat she had worked out temporary employment with Saud Al Tawash, and that Gulf\nTelecom paid her a salary, but that he was not then aware of Ms. Blake’s employment\nconditions. Mr. Cockerham testified that he did not tell anybody in the Army that Saud\nAl Tawash had hired his sister.\n\n       Ms. Blake testified that after she accepted the job, she was met at the airport in\nKuwait on August 27, 2004 by Mr. Cockerham, Maj. Davis, Saud Al Tawash, and Diaa\nSalem. Subsequently, Megbel Al Tawash helped Ms. Blake locate housing in Kuwait.\nMegbel Al Tawash cashed a 1,200.000 KD check for her, and paid Ms. Blake that\namount in cash every month as her salary, which he delivered to her in envelopes at her\napartment. Ms. Blake was paid twice as much in salary as Megbel Al Tawash. She had\nasked for $4,000.00 or more per month in wages. Saud Al Tawash testified that Ms.\nBlake was graded higher and, therefore, entitled to a higher wage than the local staff\nbecause she knew the American culture and the English language, which presented a\nbarrier for local workers when communicating with the Army. Ms. Blake testified that\nshe believed her salary could have been paid to her in cash or “they can send it to your\naccount.” Saud Al Tawash testified that Ms. Blake was paid in cash rather than wire\ntransfers because “[s]he didn’t ask it to be wired to the United States, she asked to be\n\n\n                                           48\n\fpaid locally in Kuwait.” Saud Al Tawash further explained that Ms. Blake was paid in\ncash because she could not obtain a local bank account and that cash payments were a\ncommon practice in Kuwait. Mr. Wilson testified that he did not have a Kuwaiti bank\naccount when he first arrived in Kuwait so Gulf Group wired his salary to his United\nStates account, but he was not paid in cash. Megbel Al Tawash testified that he did not\nremember paying cash to any other Gulf Telecom employee, although he believes\nShane Mi, a Gulf Telecom employee, also initially was paid in cash. Mr. Cockerham\ntestified that he never received any of Ms. Blake’s salary and did not know how much\nmoney she earned.\n\n        The parties stipulated that, “[w]hile employed in Kuwait, Ms. Blake was given the\ntask of calling members of the Kuwaiti public to ask if they were interested in buying\nwater purification systems by cold-calling from a telephone book,” but she testified that\nshe failed to sell a single system. The parties also stipulated that Ms. Blake did not\nspeak Arabic. According to Saud Al Tawash, the call centers at which Ms. Blake was\nsupposed to work were on military bases, and she never went to them because she did\nnot have the requisite paperwork to obtain a civil identification. Saud Al Tawash\ntestified at trial that, although he realized Ms. Blake could not work in the call centers in\nlate fall 2004, he “could not cancel her employment because [he] had a close contract\nwith her.” Saud Al Tawash explained that a close contract is “when you enter into a\ncontract with your employer and employee regarding the duration period that you’re\nagreed on.” Saud Al Tawash stated that, on such a contract, “I cannot fire her at that\ntime because she had her kids in school and it wasn’t the right thing to do. And I was\nobligated by law because of a fixed contract I had to pay her anyway because of the\nremainder of her contract.” According to Saud Al Tawash, under Kuwaiti labor law, he\nwas obligated to pay Ms. Blake for the full, one-year-term of her contract, including\nindemnity, salary, and benefits, starting in August 2004, even if he fired her. In\nresponse to a question how long did she have use of a company vehicle, Ms. Blake\nstated, “I think it was December ’05, no, December ’04 until June ’07.” It does not\nappear, however, that there is other testimony regarding Ms. Blake being employed by\na Gulf entity until June 2007, and Ms. Blake testified she was no longer in\ncommunication with Saud Al Tawash after December 2006. In fact, Ms. Blake offered\nconfused and inconsistent testimony on many issues throughout the course of the trial.\n\n        Ms. Blake testified that she thought she was working for Gulf Telecom or Gulf\nGroup, “but I never did work for anyone.” The parties stipulated that, “[w]hile in Kuwait\nin October 2005, Ms. Blake also worked for Mr. Saud Al Tawash’s uncle at Jireh\nSprings [General Trading & Contracting Establishment],” to whom she was referred and\nrecommended by Saud Al Tawash. In a résumé that Ms. Blake prepared at the end of\n2006 or early in 2007 and introduced at trial, Ms. Blake listed the following under the\n“Employment” heading: “Gulf Group Enterprise - Consultant” and “Jireah [sic] Springs -\nSales Representative.” Upon being asked why she listed Gulf Group, rather than Gulf\nTelecom as her employer, Ms. Blake testified that she “really didn’t know who I was\nemployed by,” but that she “thought it was Gulf Telecom” and also thought she was\nsupposed to be working for Jireh Springs in 2005 or 2006. Additionally, Ms. Blake\ntestified that she never did any work for Jireh Springs from 2004 to 2007. According to\n\n\n                                             49\n\fSaud Al Tawash, Ms. Blake’s passport lists Gulf Telecom, in Arabic, on her October 9,\n2004 Kuwait residency permit, because Gulf Telecom was her visa sponsor and\nemployer at the time. Mr. Cockerham testified that Saud Al Tawash told him Jireh\nSprings would sponsor Ms. Blake and that Ms. Blake told Mr. Cockerham that she was\nin fact sponsored by Jireh Springs. It also appears that Jireh Springs considered Ms.\nBlake to be an employee in February 2006, based on a letter from Jireh Springs to the\nCommercial Bank of Kuwait regarding the transfer of salary funds to three Jireh Springs\nemployees, including Carolyn Blake. The letter stated: “They work for the Jireh Springs\nGeneral Trading and Contracting Establishment.”\n\n        As one of her employment benefits, Gulf Telecom paid tuition for Ms. Blake’s\nchildren to attend the American International School in Kuwait, which, according to Ms.\nBlake, amounted to about $20,000.00 per year. Ms. Blake also testified that Saud Al\nTawash provided her with a vehicle while she was in Kuwait. According to Mr. Wilson,\nGulf Group purchased similar vehicles for at least four employees. Ms. Blake further\ntestified that Saud Al Tawash paid for travel and a hotel for her and her children for a\ntrip to Dubai and that Saud Al Tawash gave her between $1,500.00 and $2,000.00 in\nspending money. According to Saud Al Tawash, this trip to Dubai was deducted from\nMs. Blake’s monthly cash envelopes, and he did not give her spending money for\npersonal trips. According to Ms. Blake, Saud Al Tawash paid for another trip, to\nBahrain, including hotel costs, to get a blood test for a visa, with spending money, in the\namount of about $1,000.00. Saud Al Tawash testified that the trip to Bahrain, on\nFebruary 3, 2005, was to further Ms. Blake’s application to obtain residency in Kuwait.\nMs. Blake additionally stated that she returned to the United States for a vacation in\nJune 2005, but was not asked to retrieve any of the documents required for her to\nobtain an identification. The parties stipulated that, “[i]n March 2005, Gulf Group wired\n$9,478 to Ms. Blake for her to pay taxes due upon property she owned in the United\nStates.” Saud Al Tawash testified that this payment was “helping her out with payments\nthat she required for tax and credit cards” and that “this amount would have been\ndeducted from her -- it was like an advance payment that was paid from our company.”\nDuring his rebuttal testimony, Saud Al Tawash testified that this wire payment was to\nreimburse Ms. Blake for her travel expenses. He explained that “she voiced her\nconcern that taxes are up and she has a lot of credit card bills and the agreement\nbetween the company that we reimburse or [sic] staff for airline tickets, so she asked if\nshe could get paid, urgently because she had to meet the first of April deadline.”\nAccording to Ms. Blake, when she told him she “didn’t need that much,” he replied,\n“don’t worry about it, just use it if you need it for your other bills.”\n\n       Regarding Ms. Blake’s relationship to the Al Tawash family, Ms. Blake testified\n“we were like family” and that she “really loved the Al Tawash family.” Ms. Blake\nattended dinners at the Al Tawash home, including when Saud Al Tawash was present.\nAccording to Ms. Blake, she was invited, but did not go on the honeymoon of Saud Al\nTawash and Joanne Hands. Ms. Blake testified, “[s]o, I spoke to her so I said Joanne,\nSaud has invited us all to go with you all on your honeymoon to Sharm el Sheikh and\nso, she said, yes, girl, it will be fine, we will have fun.” Joanne Hands, however, testified\nthat nobody but her husband, Saud Al Tawash, accompanied her on their honeymoon in\n\n\n                                             50\n\fthe Maldives, not Sharm el Sheikh as Ms. Blake testified, and that she did not invite Ms.\nBlake on her honeymoon. Joanne Hands further testified that the Al Tawash family took\na vacation in the summer of 2006 to Sharm el-Sheikh, but neither Ms. Blake nor anyone\noutside the family was invited or came on that trip.\n\n       When questioned about whether he had improperly tried to influence the award\nof any Army contracts, Saud Al Tawash adamantly denied any such allegations.72\nSaud Al Tawash also pointed out that there were contracts for which he submitted bids\nto Mr. Cockerham, which were not awarded to Saud Al Tawash’s company, although\nthere were several smaller contracts, valued at $100,000.00 or less, that Mr.\nCockerham awarded to Gulf Group after the terminations of the camp package BPA call\nand the latrine and dumpster contracts.73 Saud Al Tawash forcibly and credibly denied\nobtaining inside information not otherwise available to the public, influencing anyone in\nthe contracting office, offering to give money, gifts, favors, or property to anyone in the\ncontracting office, paying anyone’s debts, or hiring anyone in exchange for favorable\ntreatment as a contractor, including the contracts and BPA call awards at issue in this\ncase. Saud Al Tawash also testified that he never had an agreement with Mr.\nCockerham for contracting actions, the purchase of land, or investment in any\ncompanies Mr. Cockerham owned. Mr. Cockerham similarly testified that he never had\na conversation with Saud Al Tawash about business opportunities. Saud Al Tawash\nexplained that he had, however, heard of other contractors bribing Army officers for\nfavorable consideration.\n\n       The parties stipulated that, “[o]n February 4, 2008, Saud Al Tawash met with Mr.\nMark Pletcher, Ms. Emily Allen, Mr. Richard Evans, attorneys for the Department of\nJustice, as well as with Mr. Larry S. Moreland and Mr. Sergio Gamino of the U.S. Army\nCID.” At the trial before this court, Saud Al Tawash testified that he told federal\ninvestigators he had heard that Tijani Saani and former Army Maj. James Momon, Jr.74\nwere soliciting bribes, and that Green Valley had been debarred for bribing Mr. Momon.\nDuring this meeting, which was prior to Mr. Momon pleading guilty to participation in a\n72\n   For example, on direct examination, plaintiff’s counsel asked Saud Al Tawash if he\nhad given anything of value to Maj. Cockerham in order to receive the award of “the\nInternet Café, the UPS [uninterruptable power supply] contract, the light set contract or\nthe wash rack contract?” to which Saud Al Tawash replied: “No ma’am.”\n73\n  Mr. Wilson noted, for example, that after the terminations of the camp package BPA\ncall, the latrine contract, and the dumpster contract, Gulf Group “built a loading ramp at\nShuait for the departing troops, that was like an $80,000 small job, then at Kuwait Naval\nBase we did some construction work on one of the piers that had been hit by a ship and\nbent....”\n74\n  According to the parties’ joint stipulation of facts, “Mr. Momon was employed by the\nDoD as a Major with the Army deployed to Camp Arifjan, Kuwait where he served as a\ncontract specialist from about September 21, 2005 through August 10, 2006.”\nAccording to Saud Al Tawash, Mr. Cockerham introduced Saud Al Tawash to Mr.\nMomon at the end of 2005.\n\n                                            51\n\fbribery scheme and involvement in a criminal conspiracy to accept bribes, Saud Al\nTawash also told the investigators that Mr. Momon had solicited a bribe from him, and\nthat he, Saud Al Tawash, had rejected the solicitation.\n\n       Saud Al Tawash testified that he first learned that Mr. Cockerham and Ms. Blake\nwere involved in bribery allegations related to other contractors from the news media in\n2007 or 2008. According to Saud Al Tawash, a number of Gulf Group bottled water\ncompetitors, including Jasmine and Allied Arms, were debarred for bribing Mr.\nCockerham. In addition, Saud Al Tawash testified that he believed there was a\nproposed debarment against Jireh Springs, and perhaps against Palm Springs, for\nbribing Mr. Cockerham, although in response to the questions, “as of today has Palm\nSprings ever been debarred? Completely debarred?” Saud Al Tawash responded “no.”\n\n        At trial, Mr. Cockerham was questioned about his undated, hand-written\n“appreciation payments” list, which was introduced into evidence, and which included\nabbreviations of names of contractors and numeric values. Mr. Cockerham testified “[i]t\nwas money, a list of either money anticipated receiving or received,” on his behalf, by\nhis wife, Carolyn Blake, or Kermit Cruz, who established a business at the direction of\nMr. Cockerham. According to Mr. Cockerham, “AA” on the “appreciation payments” list\nrefers to Allied Arms, “Jireh” refers to Jireh Ventures, “Jas” refers to Jasmine\nInternational, “Zenith” refers to Ghopal Zenith, “Falah” refers to the owner of Trans\nOrient, “F.S.” refers to Future Services, “KMS” refers to Kamal Sultan, and “Terry” refers\nto a representative of Freedom Catering Company. “Lee Dynamics” and “Green Valley”\nboth appear on the “appreciation payments” list as well. Mr. Cockerham testified he\nbegan receiving payments from contractors on the list in August 2005 to “show some\nappreciation” for his work in preventing bottled water contracts from being cancelled and\ngetting contractors off of the contracting office blacklist. Mr. Cockerham also stated that\nthese “appreciation payments” were for a church that he was in the process of starting\nand for displaced women with whom Ms. Blake was working. Mr. Cockerham noted that\n“I was just thinking, you know, be able to help a lot of people and definitely wouldn’t\nhave to ever worry about taking up a collection.…” Mr. Cockerham testified that, of the\nfourteen contractors that he saved from cancellation, five of them were bottled water\ncontractors that appear on the “appreciation payments” list: Allied Arms, Jasmine, Trans\nOrient, Zenith, and Freedom Catering Company. According to Mr. Cockerham,\nalthough Gulf Group was one of the fourteen bottled water contractors that he saved\nfrom cancellation, Gulf Group did not give any “appreciation payments” to him, his\nsister, his wife, or Kermit Cruz. Moreover, as noted above, Mr. Cockerham also signed\nthe cancellations of Gulf Group’s latrine and dumpster contracts. According to Saud Al\nTawash, Mr. Cockerham did ask him to donate to a “fictional church,” which “[t]o me,\nthat was a big no no because to me that is a bribe.” Saud Al Tawash testified that he\nnever had any agreement with Mr. Cockerham to do business of any kind.\n\n        Allied Arms is included on the “appreciation payments” list as giving two million\ndollars to Ms. Blake, which Mr. Cockerham testified was given to Ms. Blake on his\nbehalf and at his direction. According to Mr. Cockerham, he “told [Ms. Blake] to just put\nit in a safe deposit box” “for what we were wanting to do with the church, the mission,\n\n\n                                            52\n\fthe school, the daycare, the boys’ center and on and on.” Mr. Cockerham testified that\nMs. Blake understood that this money was for the church, as opposed to personal\nspending, but that she could keep ten percent of whatever money she received from the\nbottled water contractors on Mr. Cockerham’s behalf.\n\n        Lee Dynamics also is referenced on the “appreciation payments” list, and Mr.\nCockerham testified at trial that he had gotten them off of the contracting office blacklist.\nAccording to Mr. Cockerham, they were under the mistaken impression that he was\ninfluencing a contract award to them, and they had, in return, “expressed like $300,000\nor whatever” so he told them, “if you want to give something to somebody, I said give it\nto Maj. Davis’ daughter for dental school.” Mr. Cockerham further testified that the\nrepresentative from Lee Dynamics “was persisting and by this time I was thinking about\nthe church and all of this stuff, and so I was like, well, if you want to give something, you\ncan, but I say, you know, understand this, you don’t have to.” Similarly, Green Valley75\nis referenced on the “appreciation payments” list, and Mr. Cockerham testified that the\namount listed from Green Valley also was “showing me appreciation.” Mr. Cockerham\ntestified, however, that Green Valley did not pay him any “appreciation payments” until\nthe summer of 2005. Mr. Cockerham clarified that he did not receive any “appreciation\npayments” or indicate that he would be willing to accept any “appreciation payments”\nduring the time period in which Gulf Group’s camp package BPA call for Camp\nBuehring, latrine contract, and dumpster contract were awarded and terminated. Mr.\nCockerham also testified that one of the names blacked out on the “appreciation\npayments” list is Mr. Ishmal, an employee of Green Valley, who, Mr. Cockerham\nspeculated, “worked with a couple of other different companies.” Mr. Cockerham stated\nthat he told Mr. Ishmal to give money to a church in Israel, but that Mr. Ishmal was\nunable to so. According to Mr. Cockerham, while Mr. Cockerham was on leave in the\nSpring or Summer of 2005, Mr. Ishmal, the Green Valley employee, visited San Antonio,\nTexas, and left an ATM card with $250,000.00 on it for Mr. Cockerham in the backseat\nof a van, which Mr. Cockerham never used and ended up shredding. Mr. Cockerham\ntestified that the money from Green Valley did not come from Saud Al Tawash.\n\n        According to Mr. Cockerham, another contractor on the list, “Jireh” was Jireh\nVentures, a company that Mr. Cockerham directed Mr. Cruz to establish in San Antonio\nfor “providing supplies and so forth for vendors overseas that needed things from the\nstates.” Mr. Cockerham testified that neither Saud Al Tawash nor Jamal Al Dahma,\nSaud Al Tawash’s uncle, had any involvement with Jireh Ventures. Mr. Cockerham\ntestified at trial before this court that, in a January 2007 meeting with investigators, he\nexplained to Ann Brickley and Mark Pletcher of the Department of Justice that “Jireh” on\nthe appreciation list was a Kuwaiti company. Mr. Cockerham’s testimony on Jireh\nVentures, however, was contradictory and disjointed. Mr. Cockerham also stated\nshortly thereafter: “No, I don’t think -- I don’t think I told them it was a Kuwait company.”\nMr. Cockerham also testified that, although he was aware that Mr. Al Dahma was\nrelated to Saud Al Tawash, he could not recall if he knew Mr. Al Dahma was Saud Al\nTawash’s uncle. Mr. Cockerham also testified that Mr. Al Dahma did not pay him any\n75\n  As noted above, Saud Al Tawash testified he had no financial interest in Green\nValley.\n\n                                             53\n\fmoney. According to Mr. Cockerham, his 2007 statements to Department of Justice\ninvestigators, that he had asked Mr. Cruz to start Jireh Ventures so that Mr. Al Dahma\ncould transfer money to it and that he had held up a large BPA call to Jireh Springs\nbecause Mr. Al Dahma did not want to pay him, were “not true,” and he was pressured\ninto making them. In a BPA call for bottled water in Kuwait issued by Mr. Cockerham to\nJireh Springs, however, Mr. Cockerham listed Ms. Blake as the point of contact for the\nArmy and Nathan Blake, Ms. Blake’s teenage son, as the point of contact for the\ncontractor. In total, Mr. Cockerham testified that he received “close to seven” million\ndollars from the contractors on the “appreciation payments” list.76\n\n       In addition, after being questioned by the federal investigators and after the\ninvestigators searched Mr. Cockerham’s house, Mr. Cockerham testified that he drafted,\nbut never sent, the note, reproduced below, to Ms. Blake telling her, among other\nthings, to “Get Rid of Everything.” The full text of the hand-written note, as introduced\ninto evidence at trial, reads:\n\n       1. Carolyn Get Rid of Everything\n       2. Do not talk to them at All\n       3. Make sure no excess money is lying around. Put it all in the bank.\n       4. Make sure no keys are laying around.\n       5. Tell Saud if ask to don’t confess to anything. Tell them they can talk to\n       his lawyer that he never called Fernand Peters [sic] gave me a penny for a\n       contract. We will do business later in trading.\n       6. Tell Carolyn start business in Dubai.\n       7. It’s perfect legal for Carolyn to work for him doing admin paperwork as\n       long as he and I didn’t have an agreement. She never work on nor\n       prepared any contracts or worked in that Department. She got the job on\n       her own.\n\n(emphasis, capitalization, and strike-through in original).\n\n        According to Mr. Cockerham’s testimony at trial, “[e]verything” in the first line of\nthe note referred to “appreciation payments” by bottled water contractors, as well as Ms.\nBlake’s employment relationship with Saud Al Tawash. Mr. Cockerham further testified\nthat “them” in the second entry of the note refers to federal investigators. The note\nstated, “[d]o not talk to them at All,” and “[t]ell Saud if ask to don’t confess to anything.”\nMr. Cockerham explained that when he wrote, regarding Saud Al Tawash, “[w]e will do\nbusiness later in trading,” he “thought there might be perhaps an opportunity in the\nfuture,” despite the fact that he had not had any business with Saud Al Tawash prior to\nwriting this note. In another hand-written note, written during the same time period, but\nalso never sent, Mr. Cockerham wrote to Ms. Blake:\n\n\n\n76\n    Information in the indictments against Mr. Cockerham, Ms. Blake, and Mr.\nCockerham’s wife suggests that Mr. Cockerham accepted as much as $9.6 million in\nbribes.\n\n                                             54\n\f      0.

According to Mr. Cockerham, these notes were “just\nbrainstorming,” and there were “about 70 pages of these notes, just -- I’m just on a\nmental rampage, just everything I can -- that was coming to mind....”\n\n       Besides meeting with Mr. Cockerham, federal investigators called Ms. Blake in\nFebruary 2007 and requested to meet with her. According to Ms. Blake, before meeting\nwith the investigators, she called Megbel Al Tawash, and he suggested that she meet\nwith them at a restaurant, rather than her apartment “[b]ecause the apartment was not\nmy apartment.” According to Ms. Blake, she did not tell Mr. Cockerham that the\ninvestigators wanted to meet with her. Ms. Blake testified that she met with the federal\ninvestigators a few weeks later and they asked her about money she had received from\ncertain people whose names she had written in a list.\n\n       On a list Ms. Blake prepared of people who gave her money, contractors were\nassigned “some type of American name because I didn’t know how to spell their\nnames.” According to Ms. Blake’s testimony, “Felicia Hamilton” refers to Mr. Falah,\n“Julie Landsheen” refers to Justin Lee, “Destiny Carter” refers to Diaa Salem, and\n“Sharon Miller” perhaps refers to Mr. Shawak. Ms. Blake testified that the people\nnamed on the list gave her $3,135,120.00, which she eventually gave back, “except for\nthe amount for the tuition and for the amount to pay for a plane ticket for the kids to\ncome home.” According to Ms. Blake, none of the names on the list refer to Saud Al\nTawash, Megbel Al Tawash, or Suresh Pulikkal, a legal consultant for Gulf Group, and\nshe never considered any of the money she received from Gulf Telecom or the Al\nTawash family to be a bribe toward obtaining army contracts through Mr. Cockerham.\n\n       A few months prior to meeting with the investigators, in December 2006, Ms.\nBlake claims that the Al Tawash family “just wouldn’t talk to me no more” and would not\nreturn her phone calls about paying her children’s tuition. Mr. Cockerham testified that\nhe told Ms. Blake to talk to Saud Al Tawash about paying the tuition and that he also\n\n\n                                          55\n\f“mentioned it to him one time that she was concerned about the tuition in time for the\nkids so that they wouldn’t be put out of school....” Around this same time period,\naccording to Ms. Blake, Mr. Cockerham sent Ms. Blake’s niece, to “just give the money\nback, back to the contractors because the Feds had been asking questions about it.”\nAccording to Ms. Blake, she gave money back to the contractors on January 3, 2007.\n\n       According to Ms. Blake, although members of the Al Tawash family were not\nreturning her calls in December 2006, after Ms. Blake met with the federal investigators\nin early 2007, Saud Al Tawash called and said he wanted to meet with her at the\ncollege where his wife worked. Ms. Blake stated that she met with Saud Al Tawash at\nthe college for about ten or fifteen minutes and he “wanted to know why the Feds\nwanted to meet with me or something like that and that he said something else about if\nJohn gets ousted or something....” According to Saud Al Tawash, he never used the\nword “ousted” in his conversations with Ms. Blake and he does not “even know what it\nmeans.” Ms. Blake testified that she told Mr. Cockerham around April 2007 that the Al\nTawash family had stopped communicating with her.\n\n       Eventually, Mr. Cockerham was indicted and convicted, and he entered a plea\nagreement as a result of bribery in connection with the “appreciation payments.” Ms.\nBlake also was indicted and convicted, and she entered a plea agreement, confessing\nthat she had received bribe payments from government contractors on Mr. Cockerham’s\nbehalf. According to the joint stipulation of facts in the above-captioned cases, “none of\nthe contractors from whom Blake received bribe money included Mr. Saud Al Tawash,\nGulf Group, Gulf Telecom, Palm Springs, Mr. Jamal Al Dahma or Jireh Springs.” The\nparties also stipulated that, “[t]he Indictment obtained against Cockerham does not\nmention any of the contracts that are the subject of this litigation or any contract ever\nissued to Gulf Group, Gulf Telecom, or Saud Al Tawash.” In addition, the parties\nstipulated that “[t]he Indictment obtained against Cockerham also does not mention any\ncontracts awarded to Jireh Springs.” The plea agreements signed by Mr. Cockerham\nand Ms. Blake also do not mention any members of the Al Tawash family, Gulf Group,\nGulf Telecom, Palm Springs, Mr. Al Dahma, or Jireh Springs. In fact, the plea\nagreements do not mention any contractor by name. According to Mr. Cockerham, he\nwas arrested in late July 2007, and he had not exchanged any communications with\nSaud Al Tawash, including phone calls or emails, since his arrest, until his testimony\nduring the trial before this court.\n\n                                     DISCUSSION\n\n        Gulf Group’s complaints allege abuse of discretion and arbitrary and capricious\naction by the Army concerning the terminations, and, therefore, breaches of the camp\npackage BPA call, the latrine contract, and the dumpster contract. Plaintiff also claims\nwhat appear to be expectancy damages and preparation costs for breaches of the camp\npackage BPA, the latrine contract, and the dumpster contract. Plaintiff further asserts\nthat the United States violated its duty of good faith and fair dealing by causing delays\nfor the delivery of plaintiff’s bottled water pursuant to the bottled water BPA, for which\nplaintiff seeks demurrage compensation.\n\n\n                                           56\n\f       Defendant responds to plaintiff’s complaints by asserting various affirmative\ndefenses and counterclaims. For Case No. 06-835C, the camp package BPA,\ndefendant alleges that plaintiff’s claim is “barred by illegality as a result of submitting a\nfalse claim,” “barred by fraud in the inducement of the contract,” and “[p]laintiff’s\nagreement is unenforceable because of conflict-of-interest taint.” Defendant states:\n\n       As to Count I, under the Special Plea in Fraud, 28 U.S.C. § 2514, against\n       plaintiff, for forfeiture of Gulf Group’s entire claim; As to Count II, under\n       the Contract Disputes Act, 28 [sic] U.S.C. § 7103(c)(2),77 against plaintiff,\n       for damages in the amount of Gulf Group’s unsupported claim, plus the\n       Government’s cost of reviewing plaintiff’s false claim; As to Count III,\n       under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3729, against plaintiff, for treble\n       the damages sustained by the United States, plus civil penalties as are\n       allowable by law in the amount of $5,500 to $11,000 per violation, post-\n       judgment interest, and costs; As to Count IV, rescission and\n       disgorgement, for rescission of the contracts obtained by plaintiff through\n       bribery, conflict of interest, and fraud, and for disgorgement of all monies\n       the United States paid under calls under BPA [W912D1-04-A-]0047. For\n       the dismissal of Gulf Group’s third amended complaint; and For such other\n       and further relief as the Court may deem appropriate.\n\n(capitalization in original).\n\n        Regarding Case No. 06-858C, the latrine contract, defendant alleges that\nplaintiff’s claim is “barred by illegality as a result of submitting a false claim,” “barred by\nfraud in the inducement of the contract,” and “[p]laintiff’s agreement is unenforceable\nbecause of conflict-of-interest taint.” Defendant states:\n\n       As to Count I, under the Special Plea in Fraud, 28 U.S.C. § 2514, against\n       plaintiff, for forfeiture of Gulf Group’s entire claim; As to Count II, under the\n       Contract Disputes Act, 28 [sic] U.S.C. § 7103(c)(2), against plaintiff, for\n       damages in the amount of Gulf Group’s unsupported claim, plus the\n       Government’s cost of reviewing plaintiff’s false claim; As to Count III,\n       under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3729, against plaintiff, for civil\n       penalties as are allowable by law in the amount of $5,500 to $11,000 per\n       violation, post-judgment interest, and costs; For the dismissal of Gulf\n       Group’s second amended complaint; and For such other and further relief\n       as the Court may deem appropriate.\n\n(capitalization in original).\n\n77\n   Defendant incorrectly cites to the amended provisions of the Contract Disputes Act.\nSee 41 U.S.C. § 7103. The court refers to the provisions of the Contract Disputes Act in\neffect during the time period relevant to this dispute unless quoting from defendant’s\nbriefs. See 41 U.S.C. § 604.\n\n                                              57\n\f        Regarding Case No. 06-853C, the dumpster contract, defendant alleges that\nplaintiff’s claim is “barred by illegality as a result of submitting a false claim,” “barred by\nfraud in the inducement of the contract,” and “[p]laintiff’s agreement is unenforceable\nbecause of conflict-of-interest taint.” Defendant states:\n\n       As to Count I, under the Special Plea in Fraud, 28 U.S.C. § 2514, against\n       plaintiff, for forfeiture of Gulf Group’s entire claim; As to Count II, under the\n       Contract Disputes Act, 28 [sic] U.S.C. § 7103(c)(2), against plaintiff, for\n       damages in the amount of Gulf Group’s unsupported claim, plus the\n       Government’s cost of reviewing plaintiff’s false claim; As to Count III,\n       under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3729, against plaintiff, for civil\n       penalties as are allowable by law in the amount of $5,500 to $11,000 per\n       violation, post-judgment interest, and costs; For the dismissal of Gulf\n       Group’s second amended complaint; and For such other and further relief\n       as the Court may deem appropriate.\n\n(capitalization in original).\n\n        Regarding Case No. 07-82C, the bottled water BPA, defendant alleges that\nplaintiff’s claim is “barred by illegality as a result of submitting a false claim,” “barred by\nfraud in the inducement of the contract,” and “[p]laintiff’s agreement is unenforceable\nbecause of conflict-of-interest taint.” Defendant states:\n\n       As to Count I, under the Special Plea in Fraud, 28 U.S.C. § 2514, against\n       plaintiff, for forfeiture of Gulf Group’s entire claim; As to Count II, under the\n       Contract Disputes Act, 28 [sic] U.S.C. § 7103(c)(2), against plaintiff, for\n       damages in the amount of Gulf Group’s unsupported claim, plus the\n       Government’s cost of reviewing plaintiff’s false claim; As to Count III,\n       under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3729, against plaintiff, for treble\n       the damages sustained by the United States, plus civil penalties as are\n       allowable by law in the amount of $5,500 to $11,000 per violation, post-\n       judgment interest, and costs; As to Count IV, rescission and\n       disgorgement, for rescission of the contracts obtained by plaintiff through\n       bribery, conflict of interest, and fraud, and for disgorgement of all monies\n       the United States paid under calls under BPA [W912D1-04-A-]0052. For\n       the dismissal of Gulf Group’s second amended complaint; and For such\n       other and further relief as the Court may deem appropriate.\n\n(capitalization in original).\n\nI.     The False Claims Act and the Contract Disputes Act\n\n        Defendant alleges that plaintiff violated the False Claims Act in the submission of\nits claims to the government under the camp package BPA and the bottled water BPA,\nas well as under the latrine contract and the dumpster contract. Defendant also asserts\nthat plaintiff submitted claims for the camp package BPA call and bottled water BPA\n\n\n                                              58\n\fcalls, as well as for the latrine contract and dumpster contract, for an amount\nsignificantly greater than what was owed, and that, under the antifraud provision of the\nContract Disputes Act, plaintiff must pay the government the money it has claimed\nwhich is not supported, plus the government’s costs in reviewing the claims.\n\n       On December 15, 2005, Gulf Group submitted a Claim and Settlement Offer to\nMr. Cockerham under the bottled water BPA for 298,435.000 KD in demurrage for\ndelays incurred between November 2004 and March 2005. Saud Al Tawash signed the\ncover letter to the bottled water BPA Claim and Settlement Offer and the Claim and\nSettlement Offer was signed and certified by plaintiff’s attorney at the time, Ferdinand\nPeters. On December 16, 2005, Gulf Group submitted a Claim and Settlement Offer to\nMr. Cockerham for $4,544,339.84 for the camp package BPA. Mr. Peters and Saud Al\nTawash disagreed at trial as to who chose the settlement amount, with each testifying\nthat the other chose it. Within the settlement offer, plaintiff asserted that it was entitled\nto the master BPA limit of $10,000,000.00.\n\n        On December 16, 2005, Gulf Group also submitted Claim and Settlement Offers\nto Mr. Cockerham in the amount of $4,558,428.60 for the latrine contract and\n$999,994.67 for the dumpster contract.78 Saud Al Tawash signed the cover letter to the\n2005 Claim and Settlement Offers relating to the latrine contract and the dumpster\ncontract, and the Claim and Settlement Offers were certified by plaintiff’s attorney at the\ntime, Ferdinand Peters. On March 26, 2007, Gulf Group presented revised claims to\nJoseph Libbey, the contracting officer, certified by plaintiff’s replacement attorney and\ncurrent attorney of record, Iliaura Hands, for $7,000,000.00 for the camp package BPA,\n$6,000,000.00 for the latrine contract, and $1,800,000.00 for the dumpster contract. On\nMay 21, 2007, Mr. Libbey issued separate final decisions on the camp package BPA,\nthe latrine contract, and the dumpster contract termination claims.\n\n        The total price of the camp package BPA call No. 0001 was $1,447,457.22. In its\noriginal complaint in Case No. 06-835C, the camp package BPA case, plaintiff sought\n$7,000,000.00. In its first amended complaint in the camp package BPA case, plaintiff\nsought $2,682,160.86. In its second amended complaint in the camp package BPA\ncase, plaintiff sought $3,463,297.57. In its third amended complaint in the camp\npackage BPA case, plaintiff now seeks $922,851.84. The total price of the base period\nof the latrine contract was $613,142.86. In its original complaint in Case No. 06-858C,\nthe latrine case, plaintiff sought $6,000,000.00. In its first amended complaint in the\nlatrine case, plaintiff sought 1,572,967.611 KD. In its second amended complaint in the\nlatrine case, plaintiff now seeks $2,830,662.20. The total price of the base period of the\ndumpster contract was $346,998.00. In its original complaint in Case No. 06-853C, the\ndumpster case, plaintiff sought $1,800,000.00. In its first amended complaint in the\ndumpster case, plaintiff sought $1,946,721.78. In its second amended complaint in the\ndumpster case, plaintiff now seeks $780,031.63. In its original complaint in Case No.\n78\n  As indicated above, on October 19, 2006, the Camp Arifjan contracting office files\nwere searched, but there was no record of claim submissions from Gulf Group on\nDecember 15 and 16, 2005. Gulf Group, therefore, re-submitted its Claim and\nSettlement Offers and, this time, the claims were put on the contracting command log.\n\n                                             59\n\f07-82C, the bottled water BPA case, plaintiff sought 298,435.000 KD, calculated as\n$1,035,802.23. In its first amended complaint in the bottled water BPA case, plaintiff\nsought 298,435.000 KD. In its second amended complaint in the bottled water BPA\ncase, plaintiff now seeks 298,435.000 KD, calculated as $1,065,711.39, for demurrage\nand related expenses. For each of the amended complaints in the camp package BPA,\nthe latrine case, and the dumpster case, plaintiff altered the amount of money sought.\n\n       As noted above, with respect to the camp package BPA, Saud Al Tawash signed\nthe October 10, 2005 cover letter to plaintiff’s Claim and Settlement Offer and Attorney\nPeters certified plaintiff’s 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer. Plaintiff included an\nunsigned copy of Standard Form 1436 (Rev. 5/04) in its 2005 Claim and Settlement\nOffer. Standard Form 1436, which is titled “Settlement Proposal (Total Cost Basis),”\ncontains the following statement under the heading “CERTIFICATE:”\n\n      (a) AS TO THE CONTRACTOR’S OWN CHARGES. The proposed\n      settlement (exclusive of charges set forth in Item 14) and supporting\n      schedules and explanations have been prepared from the books of\n      account and records of the Contractor in accordance with recognized\n      commercial accounting practices; they include only those charges\n      allocable to the terminated portion of this contract; they have been\n      prepared with knowledge that they will, or may, be used directly or\n      indirectly as the basis of settlement of a termination settlement proposal or\n      claim against an agency of the United States; and the charges as stated\n      are fair and reasonable.\n\n48 C.F.R. 53.301–1436 (emphasis in original). The signature block of the form contains\nthe phrase “BY (Signature of authorized official).” Id. (emphasis in original). Both the\n2005 camp package BPA Claim and Settlement Offer and the Standard Form 1436\nincluded in the Claim and Settlement Offer sought $4,544,399.84. Ms. Hands signed\nthe cover letter and certification to plaintiff’s 2007 revised camp package BPA claim.79\n\n79\n   The language that Ms. Hands used to certify plaintiff’s 2007 revised claim deviates\nfrom the language set forth in the Contract Disputes Act and the FAR implementing\nregulations. Ms. Hands’ certification states:\n\n      I hereby certify that the claim herein is made in good faith and that the\n      supporting data submitted is accurate and complete to the best of my\n      knowledge and belief, that the amount requested herein accurately\n      reflects the contract adjustment for which the contractor believes the US\n      Government is liable, and that I am duly authorized to certify the claim on\n      behalf of the contractor, Gulf Group General Enterprises, Co. W.L.L. as its\n      attorney in fact.\n\nThe Contract Disputes Act and FAR implementing regulations prescribe the following\nlanguage:\n\n\n                                           60\n\fPlaintiff’s 2007 revised claim requested $7,000,000.00. Although plaintiff attached its\n2005 Claim and Settlement Offer to its 2007 revised claim, plaintiff inexplicably replaced\nthe unsigned copy of Standard Form 1436 included in its 2005 Claim and Settlement\nOffer with a signed copy of the Standard Form 1436 relating to plaintiff’s dumpster\nclaim. Plaintiff submitted a second revised camp package BPA claim to Maj. Daniel\nEverett on April 12, 2011. Plaintiff’s second revised claim sought $922,851.84 and was\nsimilarly certified by Ms. Hands.\n\n        With respect to the latrine contract claim, Saud Al Tawash signed the October\n17, 2005 cover letter to plaintiff’s Claim and Settlement Offer and Attorney Peters\ncertified plaintiff’s 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer. Saud Al Tawash’s signature, dated\nOctober 17, 2004,80 appears on the Standard Form 1436 included in plaintiff’s 2005\nClaim and Settlement Offer. Both the 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer and the\nStandard Form 1436 included in the Claim and Settlement Offer sought $4,558,428.60.\nMs. Hands signed the cover letter and certification to plaintiff’s 2007 revised latrine\nclaim,81 which requested $6,000,000.00. The Standard Form 1436 included with\nplaintiff’s 2007 revised claim is identical to the copy of the Standard Form 1436 included\nin plaintiff’s 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer.\n\n        With respect to the dumpster contract claim, Saud Al Tawash signed the October\n20, 2005 cover letter to plaintiff’s Claim and Settlement Offer and Attorney Peters\ncertified plaintiff’s 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer. The stand-alone copies of plaintiff’s\n2005 Claim and Settlement Offer that appear in the record include an unsigned copy of\nStandard Form 1436. Both the 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer and the Standard\nForm 1436 included in the Claim and Settlement Offer sought $999,994.67. Ms. Hands\nsigned the cover letter and certification to plaintiff’s 2007 revised dumpster claim,82\nwhich requested $1,800,000.00. The Standard Form 1436 that plaintiff included in its\n2007 revised claim appears to be a copy of the Standard Form 1436 included in\n\n       I certify that the claim is made in good faith; that the supporting data are\n       accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that the\n       amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which\n       the contractor believes the Government is liable; and that I am duly\n       authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the contractor.\n\nSee 48 C.F.R. § 33.207.\n80\n  Saud Al Tawash appears erroneously to have indicated that he signed the Standard\nForm included in plaintiff’s latrine Claim and Settlement Offer in 2004, rather than 2005.\n81\n   The language that Ms. Hands used to certify plaintiff’s 2007 revised latrine claim\nsimilarly deviates from the language prescribed by the Contract Disputes Act and the\nFAR implementing regulations.\n82\n  The language that Ms. Hands used to certify plaintiff’s 2007 revised dumpster claim\nsimilarly deviates from the language prescribed by the Contract Disputes Act and the\nFAR implementing regulations.\n\n                                            61\n\fplaintiff’s 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer, except that the copy included in plaintiff’s\n2007 revised claim contains Saud Al Tawash’s signature, dated October 20, 2004.83\n\n        With respect to the bottled water BPA claim, Saud Al Tawash signed the\nDecember 1, 2005 cover letter to plaintiff’s Claim and Settlement Offer. Attorney Peters\ncertified plaintiff’s 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer. Saud Al Tawash’s signature, dated\nDecember 1, 2005, appears on the Standard Form 1436 included in plaintiff’s 2005\nClaim and Settlement Offer. Both the 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer and the\nStandard Form 1436 included in the Claim and Settlement Offer sought 298,435.000\nKD.\n\n        It is not clear from the face of the 2005 Claim and Settlement Offers that plaintiff\nsubmitted to Mr. Cockerham for the termination of camp package BPA call, the latrine\ncontract, and the dumpster contract whether the Claim and Settlement Offers\nconstituted “claims” under the Contract Disputes Act.84 The United States Court of\nAppeals for the Federal Circuit has indicated that a submission to a contracting officer\nconstitutes a claim if it is “(1) a written demand, (2) seeking, as a matter of right, (3) the\npayment of money in a sum certain.” See Northrop Grumman Computing Sys., Inc. v.\nUnited States, 709 F.3d 1107, 1112 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (citing Reflectone, Inc. v. Dalton,\n60 F.3d 1572, 1575-76 (Fed. Cir.), reh’g denied (Fed. Cir. 1995)). An “explicit request\nfor a final decision” is not required, however, “‘as long as what the contractor desires by\nits submissions is a final decision....’” See James M. Ellett Constr. Co. v. United States,\n93 F.3d 1537, 1543 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (quoting Transamerica Ins. Corp. v. United States,\n973 F.2d 1572, 1576 (Fed. Cir. 1992), overruled on other grounds by Reflectone, Inc. v.\nDalton, 60 F.3d 1572). Whether a submission requests a final decision, therefore, “‘can\nbe implied from the context of the submission.’” James M. Ellett Constr. Co. v. United\nStates, 93 F.3d at 1543 (quoting Heyl & Patterson, Inc. v. O’Keefe, 986 F.2d 480, 483\n(Fed. Cir. 1993), overruled on other grounds by Reflectone, Inc. v. Dalton, 60 F.3d\n1572).\n\n       The Contract Disputes Act requires that a contractor certify with respect to a\nclaim valued at more than $100,000.00, “that the claim is made in good faith, that the\nsupporting data are accurate and complete to the best of his knowledge and belief, that\nthe amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the\ncontractor believes the government is liable, and that the certifier is duly authorized to\ncertify the claim on behalf of the contractor.” 41 U.S.C. § 605(a)(1) (2005)\n(subsequently codified with minor alterations at 41 U.S.C. § 7103(b)). A contractor is\nrequired to submit a settlement proposal to a contracting officer when seeking the\n83\n  Saud Al Tawash appears to have erroneously indicated that he signed the Standard\nForm included in plaintiff’s dumpster Claim and Settlement Offer in 2004, rather than\n2005.\n84\n   Plaintiff also submitted a Claim and Settlement Offer under the bottled water BPA in\n2005. Although plaintiff included a settlement form in its 2005 submission for the bottled\nwater BPA, plaintiff did not propose a settlement amount and appeared to request a\nfinal decision on the amount of its claim.\n\n                                             62\n\fpayment of money in connection with the termination for convenience of a fixed-price\ncontract. See 48 C.F.R. § 49.502(b) (2005) (directing that “the clause at 52.249–2” be\ninserted in fixed-price contracts that exceed the simplified acquisition threshold); see\nalso 48 C.F.R. § 52.249–2(e) (2005) (“After termination, the Contractor shall submit a\nfinal termination settlement proposal to the Contracting Officer in the form and with the\ncertification prescribed by the Contracting Officer.”).\n\n        Before the 1992 amendments to the Contract Disputes Act, a number of courts\nfound the certification on Standard Form 1436 to be insufficient to confer jurisdiction on\nthis court under the Contract Disputes Act. See Technassociates, Inc. v. United States,\n14 Cl. Ct. 200, 211 (1988) (noting that the certification on Standard Form 1436 “does\nnot state that the claim is made in good faith[,]...does not state that the data are\naccurate and complete to the best of the contractor’s knowledge[,]…[and] does not state\nthat it accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the contractor believes the\nGovernment to be liable”); cf. Gardner Mach. Corp. v. United States, 14 Cl. Ct. 286, 292\n(1988) (concluding that the submission of a settlement proposal on Standard Form 1436\ndid not qualify as a claim under the Contract Disputes Act). “Following the 1992\namendments, however, this court and other tribunals have determined that the\ncertification language found in...SF [Standard Form] 1436…is sufficiently similar to the\nCDA [Contract Disputes Act] certification to permit jurisdiction.” See Scan-Tech Sec.,\nL.P. v. United States, 46 Fed. Cl. 326, 336 (2000) (citing James M. Ellett Constr. Co. v.\nUnited States, 93 F.3d at 1544–45) (noting that the government “does not argue that the\nsubstance of the preprinted certification contained on the SF 1436 was in any way\ndeficient...[and] concedes that the ‘certification Ellett submitted with its settlement\nproposal contained similar language’ to that of the CDA.” (comparing 48 C.F.R.\n§ 53.301–1436 to 41 U.S.C. § 605(c)(1))); Medina Constr., Ltd. v. United States, 43\nFed. Cl. 537, 547–48 (1999) (“The certification executed by Medina, pre-printed on the\nTSP [termination settlement proposal] form SF 1436, contains similar language to that\nrequired for a CDA certification.... Medina’s refusal to provide a new certification does\nnot preclude the previously executed and certified TSP from ripening into a CDA claim\nwithin this Court’s jurisdiction.”); Appeal of Metric Constructors, Inc., ASBCA No.\n50,843, 98–2 BCA ¶ 30,088 (“The only certification submitted by appellant was the\nstandard certification included in the SF 1436. That certification language differs from\nthe certification required by the CDA. In fact, this Board has previously determined that\nthose differences are such as to render the SF 1436 certification one which could not be\ncorrected to meet the CDA certification requirements.... However, the Court of Appeals\nfor the Federal Circuit has since given us reason to hold differently than we did....”).\nThe certification included in Standard Form 1436 is, therefore, considered to be a\ncertification under the Contract Disputes Act, albeit defective. See 48 C.F.R. § 33.201\n(2005) (“Defective certification means a certificate which alters or otherwise deviates\nfrom the language in 33.207(c)....”); see also Appeal of Green Dream Grp., ASBCA No.\n57,413, 11–1 BCA ¶ 34,739; Appeal of W. Plains Disposal, ASBCA No. 56,986, 11–1\nBCA ¶ 34,617.\n\n      “[T]hat the contractor may express a desire to settle or negotiate the dispute...will\nnot necessarily prevent a finding that the contractor’s submissions requested a final\n\n\n                                            63\n\fdecision.” See Kanag’Iq Constr. Co. v. United States, 51 Fed. Cl. 38, 44 (2001)\n(citations omitted); see also Reflectone, Inc. v. Dalton, 60 F.3d at 1583. However,\n“settlement proposals submitted under the termination for convenience clause of the\nFAR generally are not CDA claims.” See Sys. Dev. Corp. v. McHugh, 658 F.3d 1341,\n1346–47 (Fed. Cir. 2011); see also Gardner Mach. Corp. v. United States, 14 Cl. Ct. at\n292–93. A settlement proposal is, by its nature, submitted to a contracting officer “for\nthe purpose of negotiation, not for a contracting officer’s decision.” See James M. Ellett\nConstr. Co. v. United States, 93 F.3d at 1543–44 (“A settlement proposal is just that: a\nproposal.” (citing 48 C.F.R. § 49.001 (1995))); see also Rex Sys., Inc. v. Cohen, 224\nF.3d 1367, 1371 (Fed. Cir.) (“Settlement proposals submitted under the termination for\nconvenience clause of the FAR are by their very nature merely negotiating tools and not\nclaims.”), reh’g and reh’g en banc denied (Fed. Cir. 2000). A settlement proposal,\nhowever, may ripen into a claim once negotiations reach an impasse. See James M.\nEllett Constr. Co. v. United States, 93 F.3d at 1544; see also Scan-Tech Sec., L.P. v.\nUnited States, 46 Fed. Cl. at 337 (noting that the FAR contemplates that the submission\nof Standard Form 1436 “will ripen automatically into a CDA claim if the parties reach an\nimpasse in their negotiations”).\n\n        In each of its 2005 Claim and Settlement Offers submitted to the contracting\nofficer, for the camp package BPA, the latrine contract, and the dumpster contract, Gulf\nGroup appeared to seek a final decision from the contracting officer, in addition to\nmaking a settlement offer. Although Gulf Group referred to each submission as “an\noffer for settlement,” included Standard Form 1436, “Settlement Proposal (Total Cost\nBasis),” and cited provisions of the FAR relating to settlement, the cover letter to each\n2005 Claim and Settlement Offer, each of which was signed by Saud Al Tawash, stated\nthat “[w]e hereby submitting [sic] our claim,” requested “approval for our claim,” and\nindicated that Gulf Group had attached supporting documentation in support of its\n“claim.” Moreover, each 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer included the certification\nrequired by the Contract Disputes Act for claims seeking more than $100,000.00.\nFurthermore, in each of Gulf Group’s 2007 submissions to the contracting officer with\nrespect to the camp package BPA and latrine and dumpster contracts,85 Iliaura Hands,\nplaintiff’s replacement attorney, referred to the previous submission as the “initially\nsubmitted certified claim,” designated the corresponding cover letter as “Mr. Al\nTawash’s claim letter,” and stated that “a Settlement Proposal in the Standard Form\n1436 and a Claim & Settlement Offer letter” was “[i]ncluded in Gulf Group’s claim.” The\n2007 submissions purported to withdraw each initial “settlement offer,” but also\n\n85\n  Prior to the above-captioned cases being consolidated before the undersigned judge,\nGulf Group submitted its 2007 revised claim to the contracting officer with respect to the\ncamp package BPA claim, as well as the latrine and dumpster contract claims, after\ndefendant requested the then-presiding judges, to whom each of the cases individually\nhad been assigned, to issue a stay in each case pursuant to 41 U.S.C. § 605(c)(5), “so\nthat the contracting officer can issue a decision regarding plaintiff’s ‘claim and\nsettlement offer.’” The bottled water BPA case was not stayed at that time.\nSubsequent stay requests were granted by the undersigned judge in each of the\nconsolidated cases to accommodate related ongoing criminal investigations.\n\n                                           64\n\findicated that Gulf Group “hereby re-submit[s] a claim under the Contract Dispute [sic]\nAct.”\n\n        At least one decision issued by the United States Court of Appeals for the\nFederal Circuit has indicated, however, that a contracting officer’s failure to respond to a\nsettlement proposal may not be sufficient to demonstrate a breakdown in the settlement\nprocess, precluding the “deemed denial” of a settlement proposal from allowing the\nsettlement proposal to ripen into a claim. Specifically, in Walsky Construction Co. v.\nUnited States, the contractor submitted “a termination for convenience settlement\nproposal to the contracting officer, which also contained what purported to be a\ncertification submitted pursuant to the Contract Disputes Act....” See Walsky Constr.\nCo. v. United States, No. 98–5112, 178 F.3d 1312, 1999 WL 13376, at *2 (Fed. Cir.\n1999) (unpublished table decision). The Federal Circuit concluded, however, that the\n“deemed denial” of the settlement proposal did not cause the settlement proposal to\nripen into a claim, even though the contractor waited almost a year after transmitting its\nsettlement proposal before bringing suit in the United States Court of Federal Claims.\nThe Federal Circuit reasoned that the “deemed denial” of the settlement proposal did\nnot constitute an impasse in negotiations between the parties. See id. at *2–3.\n\n        The court recognizes the similarity between the submissions at issue in Walsky\nConstruction Co. v. United States and the submissions at issue in the camp package\nBPA, latrine, and dumpster cases. The context in which the settlement proposals were\nsubmitted, however, is different. After submitting the termination settlement proposal,\nthe contractor in Walsky Construction Co. v. United States requested that the\ngovernment “‘set a negotiations date,’” the government indicated that settlement was “‘a\ndefinite priority,’” and the government updated the contractor as to the status of its\nreview of the settlement proposal. See id. at *3. In contrast, the record before this court\ndoes not reflect that the settlement proposals that Gulf Group submitted for the\ntermination of the camp package BPA call, the latrine contract, and the dumpster\ncontract were subject to further discussions between the parties. Instead, the record\nreflects that government personnel may have lost the initial submission of the Claim and\nSettlement Offers in October 2005, that government personnel could not\ncontemporaneously locate a copy of the Claim and Settlement Offers that plaintiff\nsubmitted on December 16, 2005, which now inexplicably appear in the record before\nthe court, and that government personnel refused to meet with plaintiff’s representatives\nin November 2006, approximately a year after plaintiff had made its submissions. Mr.\nLibbey, the contracting officer who issued the final decisions on the camp package BPA\ncall, and latrine and dumpster contracts, testified, apparently with respect to plaintiff’s\n2005 submissions, that “the government didn’t answer the claim,” that he could not even\nremember whether plaintiff had submitted a termination for convenience settlement, and\nthat the “government was in error” with regard to “the delay in processing.” Although\n“[o]bjective evidence that negotiations had been abandoned by the parties is necessary\nbefore the negotiations can be found to have reached an impasse,” see Rex Sys., Inc.\nv. Cohen, 224 F.3d at 1372–73, at least one authority has recognized that, when a\nsettlement proposal, which also is styled as a claim under the Contract Disputes Act, is\nnot subject to any form of negotiation, an impasse in negotiations may result, allowing\n\n\n                                            65\n\fthe settlement proposal to ripen into a claim under the Contract Disputes Act. See\nePlus Tech., Inc. v. FEC, CBCA No. 2,573, 12–2 BCA ¶ 35114 (“In looking at the\ncircumstances presented here, we see a settlement proposal as well as a certified claim\nbeing presented to the contracting officer. No attempt was made by the contracting\nofficer to contact the appellant to discuss either the settlement proposal or the certified\nclaim. After more than six months had passed, the contractor got fed up, filed the\nappeal, and refused to negotiate on the settlement proposal or certified claim.”).\nNotwithstanding the potentially broad holding of the unpublished table decision in\nWalsky Construction Co. v. United States, therefore, the court determines that the\nparties had reached an impasse with regard to plaintiff’s Claim and Settlement Offers\nand that the settlement proposals included in the Claim and Settlement Offer\nsubmissions with respect to the camp package BPA and the latrine and dumpster\ncontracts had ripened into claims under the Contract Disputes Act when the plaintiff filed\nthe complaints in the above-captioned cases based on a deemed denial of plaintiff’s\nclaims.\n\n       Accordingly, because the 2005 Claim and Settlement Offers had ripened into\nclaims under the Contract Disputes Act, and because settlement proposals constitute\nclaims under the False Claims Act, see 48 C.F.R. § 49.001 (“A settlement proposal is\nincluded within the generic meaning of the word ‘claim’ under false claims acts (see 18\nU.S.C. 287 and 31 U.S.C. 3729).”), the court examines plaintiff’s liability under the False\nClaims Act and the Contract Disputes Act for its 2005, 2007, and 2011 submissions for\nthe camp package BPA, and its 2005 and 2007 submissions for the latrine and\ndumpster contracts.\n\n      The False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3729, provides that any person who –\n\n             (1) knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, to an\n             officer or employee of the United States Government or a\n             member of the Armed Forces of the United States a false or\n             fraudulent claim for payment or approval;\n\n             (2) knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a\n             false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim\n             paid or approved by the Government;\n\n             (3) conspires to defraud the Government by getting a false\n             or fraudulent claim allowed or paid;\n\n             (4) has possession, custody, or control of property or money\n             used, or to be used, by the Government and, intending to\n             defraud the Government or willfully to conceal the property,\n             delivers, or causes to be delivered, less property than the\n             amount for which the person receives a certificate or receipt;\n\n\n\n\n                                            66\n\f             (5) authorized to make or deliver a document certifying\n             receipt of property used, or to be used, by the Government\n             and, intending to defraud the Government, makes or delivers\n             the receipt without completely knowing that the information\n             on the receipt is true;\n\n             (6) knowingly buys, or receives as a pledge of an obligation\n             or debt, public property from an officer or employee of the\n             Government, or a member of the Armed Forces, who\n             lawfully may not sell or pledge the property; or\n\n             (7) knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a\n             false record or statement to conceal, avoid, or decrease an\n             obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the\n             Government,\n\n      is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of not less than\n      $5,000 and not more than $10,00086 plus 3 times the amount of damages\n      which the Government sustains because of the act of that person....\n86\n   “The Department of Justice, by regulation, has increased the penalties for FCA [False\nClaims Act] violations to a minimum of $5,500.00 and a maximum of $11,000.00.”\nAlcatec, LLC v.

In its counterclaims in Case No. 06-835C, the camp package\nBPA, and Case No. 07-82C, the bottled water BPA, defendant requests treble\ndamages, but in its post-trial briefing defendant addresses only statutory penalties.\nNeither plaintiff nor defendant address the number of claims at issue in the alleged\nFalse Claims Act violation(s) pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 3729. Plaintiff’s position appears\nto be that, even if the court finds violation(s) of the False Claims Act, defendant should\n\n                                           67\n\f31 U.S.C. § 3729(a) (emphasis in original). The term “claim” is defined in the False\nClaims Act as:\n\n       Includ[ing] any request or demand, whether under a contract or otherwise,\n       for money or property which is made to a contractor, grantee, or other\n       recipient if the United States Government provides any portion of the\n       money or property which is requested or demanded, or if the Government\n       will reimburse such contractor, grantee, or other recipient for any portion\n       of the money or property which is requested or demanded.\n\n31 U.S.C. § 3729(c). The False Claims Act also states:\n\n       the terms “knowing” and “knowingly” mean that a person, with respect to\n       information –\n\n              (1) has actual knowledge of the information;\n\n              (2) acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the\n              information; or\n\n              (3) acts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the\n              information,\n\n       and no proof of specific intent to defraud is required.\n\n31 U.S.C. § 3729(b).\n\n        Congress rejected requiring a specific intent to defraud under the False Claims\nAct. See 31 U.S.C. § 3729(b). Instead, Congress adopted a knowing standard, defined\nas “actual knowledge of the falsity,” acting in “deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity,”\nor “acting in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity.” Id. The standard was designed to\naddress “the problem of the ‘ostrich-like’ refusal to learn of information which an\nindividual, in the exercise of prudent judgment, had reason to know.” See S. Rep. No.\n99-345, at 21 (1986), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5266, 5286. Thus, the False\nClaims Act covers not just those who set out to defraud the government, but also those\nwho ignore obvious deficiencies in a claim.\n\n       Therefore, the critical issue before the court is whether plaintiff had “knowledge,”\nas defined by the False Claims Act to include reckless disregard, that the claims plaintiff\nsubmitted to the government were false or fraudulent. To prove a violation of the False\n\nnot recover because it has not proven damages. As discussed below, however, under\nthe False Claims Act, the wrongdoer still may be held liable for the statutory penalty,\neven if the government is not injured by the conduct. The court has the discretion to\nimpose penalties within the statutory range. See Morse Diesel Int’l, Inc. v. United\nStates, 79 Fed. Cl. 116, 125 (2007), recons. denied, 81 Fed. Cl. 311 (2008).\n\n                                              68\n\fClaims Act, the government can, but need not, prove that a party intended to deceive\nthe government. See United States v. TDC Mgmt. Corp., 24 F.3d 292, 298 (D.C. Cir.\n1994); see also Daewoo Eng’g & Constr. Co. v. United States, 557 F.3d 1332, 1340\n(Fed. Cir.)

The False Claims Act requires only that the government prove that a party\nknowingly, as defined under the Act, submitted a claim with reckless disregard to the\ntruth or falsity of the information. See 31 U.S.C. § 3729(b); United States v. TDC Mgmt.\nCorp., 24 F.3d at 298; Wang ex rel. United States v. FMC Corp., 975 F.2d 1412, 1420\n(9th Cir. 1992); see also Allison Engine Co. v.

A conscious, voluntary act or omission in\n         reckless disregard of a legal duty and of the consequences to another\n         party, who may typically recover exemplary damages. — Also termed\n         reckless negligence; wanton negligence; willful negligence; willful and\n         wanton negligence; hazardous negligence; magna neglegentia....\n         “Negligence is gross if the precautions to be taken against harm are very\n         simple, such as persons who are but poorly endowed with physical and\n\n                                              69\n\f       A failure to make a minimal examination of records can constitute deliberate\nignorance or reckless disregard, and a contractor that deliberately ignores false\ninformation submitted as part of a claim can be found liable under the False Claims Act.\nSee United States v.

Cl. 59, 70, 550 F.2d 17, 23 (1977) (An applicant who submitted estimates of the\nquantities of the materials billed to the government prepared by his workmen, but\nsubstantially overbilled due to misrepresentation, resulted in a finding of “extreme\nnegligence” for which he was found liable under the False Claims Act.). The court in\nMiller v. United States noted that a contractor cannot be saved by relying on local\ngovernment officials in preparing its claims. See Miller v. United States, 213 Ct. Cl. at\n70, 550 F.2d at 23. The applicant in Miller had the responsibility to ensure the claims\nwere accurate, and the contractor had in fact signed the claims, “evidencing his\nagreement to the figures it contained.” Id.; see also Riley Constr. Co. v. United States,\n65 Fed. Cl. at 268-69 (noting that Senate committee Report on the False Claims Act\nstates that “‘those doing business with the Government have an obligation to make a\nlimited inquiry to ensure that the claims they submit are accurate.’” (citation omitted)).\nWhen the claims are prepared in a “sloppy or unsupervised fashion” and it results in\novercharging the government, there is reckless disregard. See 132 Cong. Rec. H9,382-\n03 (1986) (statement of Rep. Berman, as sponsor of the 1986 amendment to the False\nClaims Act). Although a person must make at least a minimal examination of the\nrecords, the examination need be only “reasonable and prudent under the\ncircumstances.” United States v. Bourseau, 531 F.3d 1159, 1168 (9th Cir. 2008)\n(quoting S. Rep. No. 99-345, at 21), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 1212 (2009). Courts have\nfound reckless disregard when a plaintiff failed to review claims that either he or another\nperson prepared before submitting them. See Miller v. United States, 213 Ct. Cl. at 70,\n550 F.2d at 23; United States v. Krizek, 111 F.3d at 942. In Krizek, the United States\nCourt of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld the district court’s conclusion that plaintiff\nacted with reckless disregard in failing “utterly” to review the false submissions made on\nhis behalf in violation of the False Claims Act when, inter alia, plaintiff doctor let his wife\ncomplete the submission of claims to the local Medicare carrier; the wife did not attempt\nto establish how much time was actually spent with each patient; and the doctor did not\nreview the submission. United States v. Krizek, 111 F.3d at 942. Indeed, a person\ngenerally cannot escape liability by claiming to have relied on others in preparing the\nclaim. Id.; see also Miller v. United States, 213 Ct. Cl. at 70, 550 F.2d at 23. But see\nUnited States v. Chen, 402 F. App’x 185, 188 (9th Cir. 2010); Riley Constr. Co. v.\nUnited States, 65 Fed.

See 31 U.S.C. § 3729. Judges of the Court of Federal\nClaims appear to have come to varying conclusions as to whether the act of filing a\ncomplaint is equivalent to the making of a claim for the purpose of determining a\ncontractor’s liability under the False Claims Act. Compare Ab-Tech Constr., Inc. v.\nUnited States, 31 Fed.

Although the minor differences in the revisions to the current\nversions do not change the court’s analysis, the court refers to the anti-fraud provision\nof the Contract Disputes Act in effect at the time of the events in the above-captioned\ncases.\n89\n   The preponderance of the evidence standard applied to proof under the Contract\nDisputes Act and the False Claims Act is a less rigorous standard than the clear and\nconvincing standard of proof applied under the Special Plea in Fraud statute. See UMC\nElecs. Co. v. United States, 249 F.3d at 1338-39 (“Under the Special Plea in Fraud, the\ngovernment must prove its allegations by clear and convincing evidence.” (citing Comm.\nContractors, Inc. v.

Cl. 252, 260 (2012) (assessing the\nFalse Claims Act’s statutory penalty for a claim “submitted to a contracting officer,” but\nfailing to assess an additional penalty for the plaintiff’s decision to sue the government\n“for millions of dollars on a specious claim”).\n\n        In interpreting the False Claims Act’s definition of a claim, the United States\nSupreme Court has stated: “A correct application of the statutory language\nrequires...that the focus in each case be upon the specific conduct of the person from\nwhom the Government seeks to collect the statutory forfeitures.” See United States v.\nBornstein, 423 U.S. 303, 312 (1976).90 The Supreme Court’s guidance in United States\nv. Bornstein has been interpreted to require the court to ask: “‘With what act did the\ndefendant submit his [or her] demand or request and how many such acts were there?’”\nUnited States v. Krizek, 111 F.3d at 939. When a fraudulent claim consists of multiple\ncomponents, the submission of an aggregate claim, rather than its individual\ncomponents, is the act that creates liability under the False Claims Act. See Miller v.\nUnited States, 213 Ct. Cl. at 71–72, 550 F.2d at 23–24 (rejecting an argument that a\ncontractor had asserted sixteen false claims under an earlier version of the False\nClaims Act, “eleven based on invoices used in calculating the monthly billings plus five,\none for each of the monthly consolidated billings,” because “the invoices are like tally\nsheets used in calculating a final figure to present to the Government; they are not the\nclaim itself”); see also United States v. Woodbury, 359 F.2d 370, 378 (9th Cir. 1966)\n(rejecting the argument that a penalty could be assessed under an earlier version of the\nFalse Claims Act for each document that was attached to fraudulent applications for\npayment).\n\n       When Gulf Group submitted a certified claim to the contracting officer relating to\neach of the above-captioned cases, it made a single “request or demand...for money.”\nSee 31 U.S.C. § 3729. Although a complaint that incorporates claims that have already\nbeen submitted to a contracting officer can similarly be characterized as a “demand...for\nmoney,” a complaint, unlike a certified claim, is not “present[ed]...to an officer or\nemployee of the United States Government...for payment or approval.” See id.; cf.\nUnited States ex rel. Bennett v. Medtronic, Inc., 747 F. Supp. 2d 745, 763 (S.D. Tex.\n2010) (indicating while discussing amendments to the False Claims Act that apply\nretroactively to pending claims, that the definition of a claim in the False Claims Act\ndoes not refer to “cases or causes of action” (emphasis in original)); United States ex\nrel.

When a contractor’s complaint incorporates the claims that it had submitted to\na contracting officer, and the government contends that those claims violate the False\nClaims Act, the submission of a claim to the contracting officer may create liability under\n90\n   United States v. Bornstein analyzed an earlier version of the False Claims Act, but the\nguidance of the United State Supreme Court remains relevant to the court’s\ninterpretation of amended versions of the False Claims Act. See United States v.\nKrizek, 111 F.3d at 939 n.1.\n\n                                            74\n\fthe False Claims Act, but the filing of a complaint in the United States Court of Federal\nClaims does not.\n\n       In addition, the filing of a complaint in this court does not constitute the making of\na claim under the Contract Disputes Act. The Contract Disputes Act permits a\ncontractor to “bring an action directly on the claim in the United States Court of Federal\nClaims” only after submitting a “claim” to a contracting officer. See 41 U.S.C. § 609.\nThe FAR also indicates that a “written demand or written assertion by the Contractor\nseeking the payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim under the Act [the\nContract Disputes Act] until certified.” See 48 C.F.R. § 52.233–1 (2005). A complaint,\ntherefore, cannot serve as the basis for liability under the Contract Disputes Act\nbecause it is not submitted to a contracting officer. See SITCO Gen. Trading &\nContracting Co. v. United States, 87 Fed. Cl. 506, 509 (2009) (“A complaint filed in this\ncourt does not seek a decision from the contracting officer or meet the other CDA\nrequirements of a ‘claim.’”).91\n\n         The circumstances of the above-captioned cases present a further question as to\nwhether the submission of additional certified claims to a contracting officer while\nlitigation is pending can serve as the basis for additional liability under the Contract\nDisputes Act or the False Claims Act. A line of cases dealing with the jurisdiction of the\nCourt of Federal Claims over a modification to a claim that already has been submitted\nto a contracting officer suggests that, in particular circumstances, a contractor may\nmodify the amount of its claim as long as it does not “raise new claims not presented\nand certified to the contracting officer.” See, e.g., Santa Fe Eng’rs, Inc. v. United\nStates, 818 F.2d 856, 858 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (emphasis in original) (citations omitted).\nAlthough the cases that discuss the effect of a modification on the court’s jurisdiction\nover a modified claim generally involve amendments to a contractor’s complaint during\nlitigation, these cases indicate that the submission of a revised claim to a contracting\nofficer after litigation has commenced may not constitute a new claim under the\nContract Disputes Act because the amendment of a complaint during litigation, which\neffectively modifies the amount of an existing claim submitted to a contracting officer,\ndoes not transform the existing claim into a new claim for the purpose of the court’s\njurisdiction under the Contract Disputes Act. See Kunz Constr. Co. v. United States, 12\nCl. Ct. 74, 79 (1987) (“[T]he Claims Court does not have jurisdiction under the Contract\nDisputes Act over claims which a contractor has failed to present to the agency’s\ncontracting officer.” (citations omitted)). The Federal Circuit has indicated that “[a]n\naction brought before the Court of Federal Claims under the CDA must be ‘based on the\n91\n   In contrast to the False Claims Act and the Contract Disputes Act, the Special Plea in\nFraud statute contemplates that the filing of a complaint constitutes a “claim.” The\nSpecial Plea in Fraud statute is located in Title 28 of the United States Code, which\nrelates to the judiciary and judicial procedure, and the statute specifically directs the\nCourt of Federal Claims to “find such fraud or attempt and render judgment of forfeiture”\nin relation to a fraudulent “claim against the United States.” See 28 U.S.C. § 2514; see\nalso DeRochemont v. United States, 23 Cl. Ct. 87, 90 (1991) (“DeRochemont has filed a\nclaim—the pending complaint—for a tax refund relative to tax year 1979, and he has\nattempted to practice fraud in the statement of that claim.”).\n\n                                             75\n\fsame claim previously presented to and denied by the contracting officer.’” See Scott\nTimber Co. v. United States, 333 F.3d 1358, 1365 (Fed. Cir.) (quoting Cerbonics, Inc. v.\nUnited States, 13 Cl. Ct. 415, 418 (1987)), reh’g denied (Fed. Cir. 2003). In order for a\nrevised claim to be the “‘same claim previously presented to and denied by the\ncontracting officer,’” Scott Timber Co. v. United States, 333 F.3d at 1365, the revised\nclaim must be based on “the same operatives facts,” and request “essentially the same\nrelief” as the claim originally submitted to the contracting officer, and, if applicable,\n“merely assert differing legal theories for that recovery,” which satisfies the requirement\nthat the contracting officer be given “‘adequate notice of the basis and amount of the\nclaim.’” Id. (quoting Contract Cleaning Maint., Inc. v. United States, 811 F.2d 586, 592\n(Fed. Cir. 1987)); see also Modeer v. United States, 68 Fed. Cl. 131, 137 (2005)\n(requiring that the revised claim be based on “the same operative facts as the original\nclaim and claims the same categories of relief” (citing Cerbonics, Inc. v. United States,\n13 Cl. Ct. at 418)), aff’d, 183 F. App’x 975 (Fed. Cir. 2006). When a contractor submits\na revised claim to a contracting officer during litigation, therefore, that revised claim is\nnot treated as a new claim under the Contract Disputes Act for jurisdictional purposes,\nwhich indicates that the revised claim also should not be considered a new claim for the\npurpose of assessing liability under the Contract Disputes Act.92\n\n      That the revised claims Gulf Group submitted to the contracting officer in 2007,\nand that the submission addressed to Maj. Everett in 2011 with respect to the camp\n92\n    Generally, “[o]nce a claim is in litigation, the Department of Justice gains exclusive\nauthority to act in the pending litigation.... The exclusive authority divests the\ncontracting officer of his authority to issue a final decision on the claim.” See Sharman\nCo. v. United States, 2 F.3d 1564, 1571 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (citations omitted), overruled\non other grounds by Reflectone, Inc. v. Dalton, 60 F.3d 1572. This is because, “[e]xcept\nas otherwise authorized by law, the conduct of litigation in which the United States, an\nagency, or officer thereof is a party, or is interested, and securing evidence therefor, is\nreserved to officers of the Department of Justice, under the direction of the Attorney\nGeneral.” See 28 U.S.C. § 516 (2000). The Contract Disputes Act, however, explicitly\ngrants a reviewing court the authority to “retrocede authority to the contracting officer”\nwhen the court “possess[es] jurisdiction over a claim based on a deemed denial.” See\nUnited Partition Sys., Inc. v. United States, 59 Fed. Cl. 627, 643 (2004); see also 41\nU.S.C. § 605(c)(5) (“[I]n the event an appeal or suit is...commenced in the absence of a\nprior decision by the contracting officer, the tribunal concerned may, at its option, stay\nthe proceedings to obtain a decision on the claim by the contracting officer.”). The\njudges previously assigned to the camp package BPA, latrine, and dumpster cases,\ntherefore, stayed proceedings pending the issuance of a final decision by the\ncontracting officer. Although Gulf Group’s revised claims submitted to the contracting\nofficer in 2007 did not each constitute a new claim under the Contract Disputes Act, the\ncontracting officer was not deprived of jurisdiction to render a final decision during the\nlitigation of the above-captioned cases as would typically be the case after a contractor\nfiles a complaint in the Court of Federal Claims because the judges previously assigned\nto the camp package BPA, latrine, and dumpster cases exercised their authority to “stay\nthe proceedings to obtain a decision on the claim by the contracting officer.” See 41\nU.S.C. § 605(c)(5).\n\n                                            76\n\fpackage BPA, did not constitute new claims under the Contract Disputes Act, however,\ndoes not indicate whether the revised claims constituted additional claims under the\nFalse Claims Act. Similar to the contractor in Daewoo Engineering & Construction Co.,\nGulf Group repeatedly has modified the amount that it seeks in the camp package BPA\ncase and in the latrine and dumpster cases. See Daewoo Eng’g & Constr. Co. v. United\nStates, 73 Fed. Cl. at 560 n.19. Unlike the contractor in Daewoo Engineering &\nConstruction Co., in which the plaintiff was assessed a single penalty under the False\nClaims Act after revising its single claim to the contracting officer during litigation, Gulf\nGroup submitted its revised, certified claims to the contracting officer for “a final\ndecision...awarding Gulf Group full compensation for its damages....” See id. at 560\nn.19, 573 (indicating that the revised claim amount that was discussed at trial in\nDaewoo was never certified and submitted to a contracting officer). In its revised 2007\nclaims, Gulf Group even requested that the contracting officer disregard its initial claims.\nThe court concludes, therefore, that Gulf Group’s submission of revised claims in 2007\nand potentially the submission of its second revised claim for the camp package BPA in\n2011,93 in the specific circumstances presented by the facts of this case, constituted a\n“request or demand...for money,” which was “present[ed]...to an officer or employee of\nthe United States Government...for payment or approval,” thereby creating the potential\nfor additional liability under the False Claims Act. See 31 U.S.C. § 3729; see also\nHarrison v. Westinghouse Savannah River Co., 176 F.3d 776, 785 (4th Cir. 1999)\n(describing a claim under the False Claims Act as “a call upon the government fisc”).\n\nA.     The Camp Package BPA Claims under the False Claims Act and the Contract\n       Disputes Act\n\n       The camp package BPA call for Camp Buehring was awarded to plaintiff on\nSeptember 30, 2004 and terminated on October 12, 2004. Gulf Group submitted a\nclaim to the government on the camp package BPA call, first to the Army, and then\nincorporated those claims in the original complaint filed in this court as Case No. 06-\n835C. The original complaint filed in this court in the camp package BPA case was\namended three times. Additionally, plaintiff resubmitted its camp package BPA claim to\nthe contracting officer in 2007 and again in 2011.94 In each instance, plaintiff alleged it\nwas owed monies based on its contractual relationship with the government, which the\nArmy had refused to pay. In its third amended complaint filed in this court regarding the\ncamp package BPA, plaintiff alleges:\n\n\n\n93\n  A number of differences between the 2007 and 2011 submissions, including that the\nArmy lacked authority to issue a decision on plaintiff’s 2011 submission, give the court\npause in concluding that the 2011 submission constitutes a claim under the False\nClaims Act. Regardless of whether the 2011 submission constitutes a claim under the\nFalse Claims Act, Gulf Group’s 2011 submission does not implicate liability under the\nFalse Claims Act.\n94\n  Gulf Group’s 2011 claim was submitted to a contracting officer “in the care of” Maj.\nEverett.\n\n                                             77\n\f       Gulf Group was fully prepared to perform under the...BPA Call and was\n       ready to continue to fully perform for the complete duration of the BPA Call\n       any subsequent BPA Call Modifications or additional separate BPA Calls,\n       including other future extensions of the Master BPA.\n\n       On or about October 12, 2004, after Gulf Group had commenced\n       preparations to perform its contractual duties and had incurred substantial\n       preparatory costs to perform under the Master BPA, the U.S. Army\n       Contracting Command SWA-Kuwait (ARCENT) Contracting Officer, Gloria\n       D. Davis, issued BPA Call Modification Number 000103 which cancelled\n       and terminated the BPA Call without warning or valid justification and\n       without any benefit ensuring [sic] to the Government.\n\n(internal citation omitted).\n\n      In its third amended answer to plaintiff’s complaint in the camp package BPA\ncase, No. 06-835C, defendant responds by alleging that:\n\n       Gulf Group is unable to support its claim,95 as alleged above, due to a\n       misrepresentation of fact or fraud. Gulf Group knowingly and deliberately\n       certified entitlement to $4,544,339.8496 for Call 0001, despite that: (a) the\n       total contract award was $1,447,457; (b) the contract was terminated 12\n       days into the performance period; and (c) Gulf Group submitted an invoice\n       from Green Valley generated by a Gulf Group employee97 to support its\n95\n   Defendant’s answers to plaintiff’s complaints in the camp package BPA case and the\nlatrine and dumpster cases interchangeably refer to plaintiff’s “certified claim” and\nplaintiff’s “claims” when discussing the False Claims Act. Defendant’s answers,\nhowever, seek “civil penalties as are allowable by law…per violation.” As indicated\nabove, plaintiff’s submissions in 2005 and 2007 create the potential for liability under the\nFalse Claims Act.\n96\n   Defendant’s third amended answer interprets plaintiff’s settlement offer as the amount\nto which plaintiff claimed entitlement in its 2005 camp package BPA claim. As indicated\nabove, plaintiff asserted entitlement to more than the amount of its settlement offer in its\n2005 claim.\n97\n   In its third amended answer, defendant argued that the Green Valley invoice was\nincluded in the camp package BPA claim to evidence the purchase of one hundred fifty-\neight latrines and one potable water tanker, and highlighted that the invoice had the\nmobile telephone number of Suresh Pulikkal, who defendant described as a “Gulf Group\nemployee.” As noted above, Suresh Pulikkal appears to have been a legal consultant\nfor a number of different companies. Saud Al Tawash explained that Suresh Pulikkal\nwas “the project coordinator” for Gulf Group and Green Valley’s joint venture. The joint\nventure agreement between Gulf Group and Green Valley indicated that Suresh\nPulikkal had authority to act on the behalf of Green Valley. In addition, plaintiff asserted\nthat the invoice from Green Valley was not included in the claim calculation, but was\n\n                                            78\n\f       claim. Accordingly, Gulf Group is liable to the United States pursuant to\n       the Contract Disputes Act, 41 U.S.C. § 7103(c)(2), for the unsupported\n       claim, plus the Government’s costs attributable to reviewing the claim.\n\nDefendant continues:\n\n       Gulf Group knowingly presented and caused to be presented, to officers\n       and employees of the United States Government, and to members of the\n       Armed Forces of the United States, false or fraudulent claims for payment\n       or approval, in submitting invoices for all calls under BPA 0047 and in\n       submitting its certified claim to the contracting officer(s). The claims for\n       payment were false or fraudulent because: (a) Gulf Group inflated the\n       amount of its claim for Call 0001 for supplies and services it did not\n       render; (b) Gulf Group submitted an invoice from Green Valley generated\n       by a Gulf Group employee to support its claim for Call 0001; and (c) the\n       award of BPA 0047 contract was tainted by bribery.98\n\n        In a post-trial brief, defendant contends that plaintiff violated the False Claims Act\nbecause the amounts it claimed, when plaintiff submitted its claims in 2005 and 2007 on\nthe camp package BPA claim, were without basis and inflated, and because plaintiff\nsought payment for expenses it never had incurred. Defendant also argues that plaintiff\nis liable to the United States in the amount of $6,674,502.13, pursuant to the antifraud\nprovision of the Contract Disputes Act, for the amounts it claimed when plaintiff\nsubmitted its claims in 2007. Defendant identifies $5,545,505.28 as the unsupported\namount of plaintiff’s 2007 claim, which asserted entitlement to the BPA call limit,\n$7,000,000.00, and attorneys’ fees, which were later identified as amounting to\n$7,037.50, even though the price of the call was $1,447,457.22.99 In addition,\ndefendant argues that plaintiff asserted entitlement to $1,128,996.85 in unsupported\ncosts in its 2005 and 2007 submissions. Defendant not only contends that plaintiff\n\nincluded with the claim documents to show that plaintiff was ready to perform and that it\nhad a good faith belief that the government would award other calls under the camp\npackage BPA to Gulf Group or extend the call already awarded.\n98\n  As is discussed more fully below regarding defendant’s allegations of bribery, Saud Al\nTawash testified forcefully that he did not obtain inside information from Mr. Cockerham,\nMaj. Davis, or anyone else in the contracting office, and that he and his company did\nnot offer money, gifts, or favors to Mr. Cockerham, Maj. Davis, or any other official in the\ncontract office in order to receive any inside information or award of any of the\ncontracts, BPAs, or BPA calls. The court had considerable opportunity to observe Saud\nAl Tawash in the courtroom, including during his lengthy direct testimony, cross-\nexamination, and rebuttal, to reach its conclusion that Saud Al Tawash offered sincere\nand credible testimony.\n99\n  Defendant does not address the fact that plaintiff’s claim to attorneys’ fees arises out\nof Attorney Peters’ preparation of plaintiff’s 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer, rather\nthan plaintiff’s 2007 claim.\n\n                                             79\n\fsought costs it had not incurred, but also that the claimed amount was merely a\nnegotiating ploy.\n\n       Plaintiff argues in response that it “sought full contract value including the base\nperiod and all options that Gulf Group believed would have performed if the contracts\nwere not improperly terminated, which is also the total amount the Government would\nhave spent to obtain the services.” Plaintiff contends that it sought payment for the full\ncontract price, including the option periods, based on case law, which plaintiff asserts\nestablished that a contractor may recover for unexercised option periods if the\ngovernment made an arbitrary and capricious or bad faith100 decision not to exercise the\noptions.\n\n       The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit stated in White v.\nDelta Construction International, Inc.:\n\n       The primary objective of damages for breach of contract is to place the\n       non-breaching party “in as good a position pecuniarily as he would have\n       been by performance of the contract.” Miller v. Robertson, 266 U.S. 243,\n       257 (1924). As this court has stated, “[t]he general rule is that damages\n       for breach of contract shall place the wronged party in as good a position\n       as it would have been in, had the breaching party fully performed its\n       obligation.” Mass. Bay Transp. Auth. v. United States, 129 F.3d 1226,\n       1232 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (citing prior cases of this court and its predecessor,\n       the Court of Claims). Commentators and the Restatement of Contracts\n       also have consistently recognized this principle. Arthur Linton Corbin,\n       Corbin on Contracts § 992, at 5 (1964); E. Allan Farnsworth, Farnsworth\n       on Contracts § 12.3, at 157 (2d ed. 1998); Charles T. McCormick,\n       Damages § 137, at 561 (1935); Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 344\n       cmt. a (1979).\n\n       A corollary of that principle is that the non-breaching party is “not entitled\n       to be put in a better position by the recovery than if the [other party] had\n100\n    In the second amended complaints submitted to this court, plaintiff alleged bad faith\nterminations in Case No. 06-835C (the camp package BPA), Case No. 06-858C (the\nlatrine contract), and Case No. 06-853C (the dumpster contract). Plaintiff subsequently\ndropped all allegations concerning bad faith in each case. As confirmed in an April 22,\n2011 Order issued by this court, “[i]n a conference the court held with the parties on\nApril 8, 2011, plaintiff’s counsel advised the court that, upon reflection, counsel does not\nwish to pursue a bad faith claim on the part of the government, but that plaintiff’s\ncounsel intends to proceed with the allegation that government officials acted arbitrarily\nand capriciously with respect to the cancellation of Gulf Group’s contract.” Thereafter,\nin its third amended complaint in Case No. 06-835C (the camp package BPA), filed on\nMay 6, 2011, plaintiff dropped its bad faith claim against the government. At closing\nargument, in response to the question from the court, “there is no bad faith claim in any\none of these four cases, 06-835, 06-858, 06-853, and 07-082, is that correct?” plaintiff’s\ncounsel responded, “[t]hat is correct.”\n\n                                            80\n\f      fully performed the contract.” Miller, 266 U.S. at 260, 45 S. Ct. 73. As the\n      First Circuit stated the rule, the non-breaching party “should on no account\n      get more than would have accrued if the contract had been performed.”\n      DPJ Co. v. FDIC, 30 F.3d 247, 250 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\nWhite v. Delta Constr. Int’l, Inc., 285 F.3d 1040, 1043 (Fed. Cir. 2002); see also\nBluebonnet Sav. Bank, F.S.B. v. United States, 339 F.3d 1341, 1344-45 (Fed. Cir.\n2003) (stating that breach of contract damages are meant to place the wronged party in\nas good a position as he or she would have been in but for the breach, not in a better\nposition); San Carlos Irrigation & Drainage Dist. v. United States, 111 F.3d 1557, 1562–\n63 (Fed. Cir.) (stating that breach of contract damages put the wronged party in as good\na position as he would have been in if the breaching party had performed in full), reh’g\ndenied (Fed. Cir.), and corrected on limited grant of reh’g (Fed. Cir. 1997). In Glendale\nFederal Bank, FSB v. United States, 239 F.3d 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2001), the Federal Circuit\naddressed “expectancy damages,” which are often equated with “lost profits.” The court\nwrote:\n\n      One way the law makes the non-breaching party whole is to give him the\n      benefits he expected to receive had the breach not occurred. See\n      Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 344(a) (1981). The benefits that\n      were expected from the contract, “expectancy damages,” are often\n      equated with lost profits, although they can include other damage\n      elements as well. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 347. The\n      problems of proof attendant on the burden placed on the non-breaching\n      party of establishing lost profits—on establishing what might have been—\n      are well recognized. Even with a generous standard of proof applied in\n      such cases, see, e.g., San Carlos Irrigation & Drainage Dist. v. United\n      States, 111 F.3d 1557, 1563 (Fed. Cir. 1997); Neely v. United States, 152\n      Ct. Cl. 137, 285 F.2d 438, 443 (1961), the proof problems can in some\n      situations prove to be insurmountable.\n\nGlendale Fed. Bank, FSB v. United States, 239 F.3d at 1380.\n\n       Plaintiff admits that the claims it submitted relevant to the camp package BPA in\n2005 and 2007 were incorrect. Plaintiff argues, however, that the mistakes made in\nsubmitting the camp package BPA claims in 2005 and 2007 were innocent mistakes\nand, thus, should not be actionable under the False Claims Act or the Contract Disputes\nAct. Plaintiff further argues that the expense table that was included in the 2005 camp\npackage BPA claim was not attached to show expenses actually incurred, or as a basis\nfor the amount claimed, but rather to show that plaintiff was prepared to perform. At\nclosing argument, plaintiff’s current attorney of record, Ms. Hands, who prepared,\nsigned, and certified plaintiff’s revised camp package BPA claim in 2007, stated: “I\nmade a mistake. I misunderstood the claims. I thought that we could collect full\ncontract value, plus the expenses. I misunderstood the expenses to be the full amount\non those expense tables,” and “I read those expense tables as including all of the\nexpenses.” Plaintiff also responds to defendant’s counterclaims by arguing that it had a\nlegal and factual basis for claiming the full amount of the camp package BPA call 0001,\n\n                                           81\n\fstating: “Gulf Group had a good faith basis for claiming the full $7,000,000 call limit and\nGulf Group did not submit a claim for costs as the Government interpreted or\nmaintained that it had actually paid $1,183,838.72 in costs.”\n\n      According to plaintiff, Maj. Davis, on behalf of the Army, had informed Saud Al\nTawash that Gulf Group would receive multiple calls under the camp package BPA if it\nperformed well.101 Moreover, even after camp package BPA call 0001 was terminated,\nGulf Group received other calls for latrines and dumpster services under the camp\npackage BPA. Plaintiff states that “Mr. Al Tawash thus had every expectation that the\nArmy would either amend BPA Call 001 [sic] to issue additional requests for camp\npackages or individual items listed on the BPA Call up to the maximum Call limit of\n$7,000,000, and even up to the full Master BPA aggregate of $10,000,000.”\n\n       During cross-examination, Attorney Peters, plaintiff’s prior attorney, revealed his\nviews regarding his decision to seek the entire amount of the camp package BPA, and\nhis misunderstanding of what had occurred:\n\n       Q: So the future work under this call, or the future work under the entire\n       BPA?\n\n       A: The entire BPA.\n\n       Q: And when you put whatever number, the $5 million, in the claim, you\n       put it in because you believed the termination for the BPA call was based\n       on the Army’s bad faith and abuse of discretion; isn’t that right?\n\n       A: Yes, but I might have been -- I might have made a mistake on this one.\n       I might have misunderstood and thought that the entire BPA was being\n       canceled, or was being withdrawn, because I was going by what I had\n       been told by Hess and everyone else that they were canceling everything\n       that my clients had with them.\n\n       Q: Did you ask anyone at Gulf Group whether Gulf Group received further\n       calls under this BPA?\n\n       A: I probably didn’t because I thought that everything had been canceled.\n\n        The extent to which Attorney Peters did a disservice to his client and opened up\nthe possibility of a False Claims Act counterclaim and a Contract Disputes Act\ncounterclaim regarding his client’s claims, as a result of advice that he gave to his client,\nis further illustrated by this exchange on direct examination of Mr. Peters at trial:\n101\n    Maj. Davis both awarded and terminated plaintiff’s camp package BPA call. Unlike\nthe other contracts, Mr. Cockerham had more limited involvement with the camp\npackage BPA call. He was not the contract specialist or contracting officer on the camp\npackage BPA, but was listed on the Contract Review Board that recommended award\nof the camp package BPA to Gulf Group.\n\n                                             82\n\f       Q: And when you submitted this claim did you intend to submit a\n       fraudulent claim?\n\n       A: Never.\n\n       Q: And when you submitted these claims did you knowingly submit a false\n       claim?\n\n       A: No, I would never submit anything fraudulently at all for a variety of\n       reasons. One, having to do with my oath as an officer, and as an attorney\n       who values his license, and ability to practice law, and I will not\n       compromise myself for any client ever.\n\n       Q: Did Gulf Group ask you to submit a claim that was inflated?\n\n       A: No.\n\n       Q: Did Gulf Group ask you to submit a claim that was false?\n\n       A: No, they relied on me to know what the American law was, and I felt\n       that what I submitted was correct. If I had submitted anything less, then I\n       would be guilty of malpractice for not submitting the full amount that under\n       the circumstances would be correct in a court of law based on my review\n       of case law, et cetera, and the rules that guide us in this endeavor.\n\n       Plaintiff insists that it did not include a claim for the expenses listed on the\nexpense table for the camp package BPA. Plaintiff also asserts that the invoice from\nGreen Valley was included with the camp package BPA claim documents only to show\nthat plaintiff was ready to perform and that it had a good faith belief that the government\nwould award other calls under the camp package BPA or extend the call awarded.\nAccording to plaintiff, the Green Valley invoice was not included in the claim calculation.\n\n        In 2005, plaintiff submitted its Claim and Settlement Offer to the Army for the\ncamp package BPA, certified by Attorney Peters, with a cover letter and settlement offer\nin the amount of $4,544,339.84, both signed by Saud Al Tawash. Neither Attorney\nPeters nor Saud Al Tawash offered any specific basis for the settlement amount\nincluded, other than Attorney Peters testifying that he generally instructed his clients to\noffer “something less” than the total claim amount. The camp package BPA call No.\n0001 was in the amount of $1,447,457.22. In its 2007 revised claim submitted to the\nArmy, which was prepared, signed, and certified by plaintiff’s second attorney, and\ncurrent attorney of record, Iliaura Hands, as well as in its original complaint filed in this\ncourt, also submitted by Ms. Hands as attorney of record in the above-captioned cases,\nplaintiff claimed $7,000,000.00, the price of the camp package BPA call limit. In its first\namended complaint in the camp package BPA case, plaintiff sought $3,463,297.57, in\nits second amended complaint plaintiff sought $3,463,287.57, and in its third amended\n\n\n                                             83\n\fcomplaint plaintiff now seeks $922,851.34. Each of the three amended complaints was\nsubmitted by Ms. Hands as plaintiff’s attorney of record.\n\n        The amounts plaintiff claimed in its successive claims and complaints were\ninconsistent and submitted without reasonable explanation of the original submission to\nthe contracting officer, and without reasons and justifications for the amendments to the\ncomplaints or claims. Plaintiff sought amounts that would have placed plaintiff in a\nbetter position than if camp package BPA call 0001 had been fully performed. Had the\nmaximum value of the calls been issued under the camp package BPA, plaintiff would\nhave incurred expenses, which would have reduced its gross profits under any given\ncamp package BPA call. In its 2007 claim, plaintiff sought the entire call limit of\n$7,000,00.00, an amount that far exceeded any potential profit on the $1,447,457.22\nBPA call 0001. Although plaintiff’s 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer, which was\nincorporated into plaintiff’s 2007 claim, acknowledged that the law directs that contract\ndamages place the wronged party in as good a position as it would have been but for\nthe breach, the claims plaintiff submitted in 2005 and 2007 would have put plaintiff in a\nfar better position. Unfortunately for plaintiff, which has indicated it acted on its\nattorneys’ advice, Gulf Group is bound by its attorneys’ mistakes and errors. See Link\nv. Wabash R.R., 370 U.S. 626, 633-34 (“Petitioner voluntarily chose this attorney as his\nrepresentative in the action, and he cannot now avoid the consequences of the acts or\nomissions of this freely selected agent. Any other notion would be wholly inconsistent\nwith our system of representative litigation, in which each party is deemed bound by the\nacts of his lawyer-agent and is considered to have ‘notice of all facts, notice of which\ncan be charged upon the attorney.’” (quoting Smith v. Ayer, 101 U.S. 320 (1879))),\nreh’g denied, 371 U.S. 873 (1962).102 Moreover, although the initial claims submitted to\nthe Army were certified by Ferdinand Peters, and the revised claims were signed and\ncertified by Iliaura Hands, successively, Saud Al Tawash also signed the cover letters\nand settlement forms included in the claims earlier submitted to the Army and was\nresponsible for the actions of Gulf Group as the head of the organization.\n\n        Furthermore, the case law plaintiff cites as providing a basis for seeking lost\nprofits on option periods, for which plaintiff sought the maximum value of all calls the\ngovernment could have issued under a BPA in its 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer,\nrefers to situations in which the contractor can prove that the government chose, in bad\nfaith, not to exercise the option periods, see Hi-Shear Tech. Corp. v. United States, 356\n102\n    The cases and law journal article plaintiff cites in support of its position that plaintiff\nshould not be held responsible for its attorneys’ actions are inapposite. See United\nStates ex rel. Hefner v. Hackensack Univ. Med. Ctr., 495 F.3d 103 (3d Cir. 2007);\nUnited States ex rel. Bidani v. Lewis, 2001 WL 32868 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 12, 2001), vacated\non recons. by 2001 WL 747524 (N.D. Ill. Jun. 29, 2001); The Government’s Increasing\nUse of the False Claims Act Against the Health Care Industry, 24 J. Legal Med. 457\n(2003). The case United States ex rel. Hefner v. Hackensack University Medical Center\nis a non-precedential decision and was ultimately decided based on a lack of evidence\nof reckless disregard. The case United States ex rel. Bidani v. Lewis is an unreported,\nnon-precedential decision, and the Journal of Legal Medicine creates no binding\nprecedent.\n\n                                              84\n\fF.3d 1372, 1374, 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir.), reh’g en banc denied (Fed. Cir. 2004);\nBlackstone Consulting, Inc. v. Gen. Servs. Admin., CBCA 718, 08-1 BCA ¶ 33,770;\nGreenlee Constr., Inc. v. Gen. Servs. Admin., CBCA 416, 07-1 BCA ¶ 33,514. These\ncases do not cover situations in which the government chooses to terminate a contract\nduring a base period without ever reaching or making a decision as to the option\nperiods. In the camp package BPA case, there is no evidence that, had the BPA call\nnot been terminated, the government would have issued additional calls under the BPA\nor modified the value of Gulf Group’s call, or would have not issued additional calls in\nbad faith. Nor is the government generally obligated to exercise an option. See Gov’t\nSys. Advisors, Inc. v. United States, 847 F.2d 811, 813 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (“An option is\nnormally an option, and nothing in [the provision at issue], or in any other contract\nclause, limited the circumstances under which the government could decline to exercise\nthat bargained-for right in this case.”); see also Sundowner 102, LLC v. United States,\n108 Fed. Cl. 737, 741 (2013).\n\n        With regard to the expense table submitted with the camp package BPA claim,\nAttorney Peters testified that he did not intend the 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer to\ninclude the table as support for its claims, but, rather, that the expense table was\nattached to the claim to show that Gulf Group was prepared to perform. Attorney Hands\nstated at closing arguments that she did not know that some of the expenses listed had\nactually not been incurred. Although Attorney Peters may wish he had made clear that\nthe tables were submitted for the limited purpose to which he testified at trial, and\nAttorney Hands may have been ignorant of whether all the expenses were incurred or\nnot, post-action explanations do not assist plaintiff. The 2005 and 2007 claims to the\nArmy, and the original complaint in this case, all list the full potential value of the camp\npackage BPA call as the sum to which plaintiff believed it was entitled, not the expenses\nlisted in the expense table, which was submitted with the certified claim, and which\namounted to 345,717.000 KD.\n\n        At the time that Gulf Group submitted its 2005 camp package BPA Claim and\nSettlement Offer, it knew which items in the expense table it had already purchased and\nwhich items no longer would be needed because the camp package BPA call for Camp\nBuehring had been terminated. Yet, it was not until Gulf Group submitted its second\nrevised claim to Maj. Everett in 2011 that Gulf Group adjusted the expense table to\nreflect that some items had been purchased and other items had not. Indeed, Gulf\nGroup actually purchased only 19,255.000 KD worth of equipment, not 345,717.000 KD\nworth of equipment, as reflected in the submitted expense table. The assertion of\nentitlement to the full potential value of all calls issued under the camp package BPA\nand the incorrect expense table, to which both attorneys contributed, and which Saud Al\nTawash, as plaintiff’s principal, failed to oversee, resulted in submission of conflicting,\nincorrect, and reckless claims to the United States by plaintiff.\n\n      Moreover, the invoices and purchase orders submitted muddle the issues. The\ndocumentary support submitted for the 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer for the camp\npackage BPA is little more than a perplexing disarray of documents, which serves only\nto complicate an amount sought that is without legal or logical basis. Despite plaintiff’s\n\n\n                                            85\n\fafter the fact argument to the contrary, it does not appear from the claim as filed that the\nexpense table was included to prove the preparedness to perform. Rather, the cover\npage to the 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer states: “we request your kind attention and\napproval for our claim and [sic] submitting this claim with [sic] following documents for\nreimbursement of both costs and profits....:”\n\n       1)   Form 1438 Settlement proposal\n       2)   Claim and Settlement Offer\n       3)   Appendix: 1. Contract\n       4)   Appendix: 2. Cancellation Documents\n       5)   Appendix: 3. Expense Table\n       6)   Appendix: 4. Expense Documents\n       7)   Appendix: 5. Pictures of dumpsters and vehicles.\n\n(emphasis added). The 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer certified by Attorney Peters\nstates, “[t]his offer includes reimbursement for both costs and lost profits.... The\ncontract costs, when added to the anticipated contract profit, total $10,000,000.00 the\nfull contract price.” This puzzling statement appears to assert that Gulf Group is entitled\nto be paid either for the costs it already incurred, thus the inclusion of the expense table\nand expense documents for items which, as now established, were not all purchased, or\nfor the costs plaintiff would have incurred had the contract been performed with all\npotential calls exercised, a notion that is similarly unsupportable, as the costs of\nperforming the contract are the responsibility of the contractor and are deducted from\npotential net profit in breach-damage computations. See Bluebonnet Sav. Bank, FSB v.\nUnited States, 339 F.3d at 1345.\n\n        Additionally, although the 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer offered to settle for\n$4,544,339.84, less than the BPA master dollar limit of $10,000,000.00, plaintiff appears\nto believe that, had the camp package BPA call not been terminated, the government\nwould have issued calls to plaintiff up to the full master dollar limit of $10,000,000.00,\nalthough plaintiff offers no reasonable explanation or evidence in the record for this\nbelief.    The camp package BPA was not a guaranteed set of calls worth\n$10,000,000.00, rather, $10,000,000.00 was the maximum value of all calls which could\nbe issued under the camp package BPA. Furthermore, only camp package BPA call\n0001, worth $1,447,457.22, was terminated, and the limit of that camp package BPA\ncall was only $7,000,000.00. Indeed, there were other calls issued under the camp\npackage BPA to Gulf Group from 2004 to 2005, for which plaintiff was paid a total of\n$3,112,498.24. At trial, Attorney Peters testified that he may have been mistaken in\nthinking that the entire camp package BPA had been cancelled, rather than call 0001\nwith its $7,000,00.00 limit. Regardless, the camp package BPA call 0001 at issue was\nonly worth $1,447,457.22, and was terminated only twelve days after it was awarded.\n\n       Finally, the fact that Saud Al Tawash testified that he and Gulf Group did not\nknow how to compile a claim to be submitted to the United States government does not\nobviate Gulf Group’s responsibilities, or Saud Al Tawash’s responsibilities as the\nGeneral Manager of Gulf Group, nor does plaintiff’s and Saud Al Tawash’s reliance on\nthe attorneys absolve the plaintiff of its responsibilities for submitting inflated and\n\n                                            86\n\fdeficient claims. See Link v. Wabash R.R., 370 U.S. at 633-34. Saud Al Tawash\nsigned the cover letter for the 2005 camp package BPA claim, as well the settlement\noffer form. He testified at trial, however, that he did not look at the claim in detail until\nhis deposition, despite acknowledging that it was the responsibility of everyone involved\nwith the claims to make sure they were accurate. Plaintiff is bound by the actions of its\nattorneys and its General Manager, Saud Al Tawash. Plaintiff chose to rely on its\nattorneys to prepare and submit its claims. By giving its attorneys the authority to certify\nthe claims on Gulf Group’s behalf, and failing to review the submissions, plaintiff cannot\nnow hide behind the mistakes of its attorneys to avoid liability under the False Claims\nAct. It appears from the record that plaintiff, in the personages of Attorney Peters,\nAttorney Hands, and Saud Al Tawash, did not conduct even a minimal inquiry into the\naccuracy of the claims submitted. Had they done so, they would have seen the\ninconsistency of the claims and the expense table. They also should have seen the\nlack of foundation for the information included in the table. Moreover, had any one of\nthem carefully reviewed the various claims, they should have noticed that the claims\nwere for more than the BPA call amount. In addition, the attorneys should have been\nmore conversant with government contract law, including the legal status of options,\nBPAs, and calls. According to his testimony, Saud Al Tawash was a business major\nand graduate of Tulane University, who has multiple business holdings and experience\nrunning companies, including performance of other United States government contracts.\nIt is hard for this court to imagine that, had Saud Al Tawash appropriately reviewed the\n2005 Claim and Settlement Offer, he would not have realized that plaintiff stood to\nrecoup more money from its 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer than it would have made,\neven had the master dollar limit of the BPA been reached and had BPA call 0001 not\nbeen terminated. Plaintiff cannot escape the fact that it sought the BPA call dollar limit\nof $7,000,000.00 in its 2007 claim on a terminated call that was worth only\n$1,447,457.22.\n\n        As noted above, a failure to make a minimal examination of records can\nconstitute deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard, for which a contractor may be\nfound liable under the False Claims Act. See Miller v. United States, 213 Ct. Cl. at 70,\n550 F.2d at 23; United States v. TDC Mgmt. Corp., 24 F.3d at 298. The submissions\nwere prepared by Gulf Group in such a “sloppy or unsupervised fashion” that the\ngovernment was overbilled. See 132 Cong. Rec. H9,382-03. Plaintiff, as the claim\napplicant, is responsible for the accuracy of the claims presented to the government,\nregardless of who prepared them and how they were prepared. Plaintiff’s submissions\ncontain far more than mere math errors, innocent mistakes, or flawed reasoning. See\nWang ex rel. United States v. FMC Corp., 975 F.2d at 1420-21. The claims were false\non their face and lacked a reasonable basis. The facts as established in testimony at\ntrial and in the trial exhibits, including plaintiff’s written submissions to the Army, lead\nthe court to conclude that plaintiff’s varied, ill-considered, and jumbled camp package\nBPA claims in 2005 and 2007 were submitted with reckless disregard as to their truth or\nfalsity, and, therefore, under the statutory definition, constitute “false claims,” pursuant\nto 31 U.S.C. § 3729. Plaintiff’s 2011 submission addressed many of the deficiencies in\nthe previous claims and, therefore, even if considered a claim, does not serve as the\nbasis for additional liability under the False Claims Act.\n\n\n                                             87\n\f        Despite the established liability under the False Claims Act, based on reckless\ndisregard, and defendant’s correct assertion that Gulf Group submitted a claim for the\ncamp package BPA claim in excess of the amount of the camp package BPA call 0001,\ndefendant has not proven that the claims were made with intent to deceive the\ngovernment on the part of Gulf Group and Saud Al Tawash. At trial, Saud Al Tawash\ntestified that he believed the claim was correct when it was submitted. The court finds\nthe testimony of Saud Al Tawash to be sincere and credible, although he was far too\ntrusting of his attorneys. Plaintiff Gulf Group, through Saud Al Tawash, was relying on\nthe experience of Attorney Peters and of Attorney Hands in American law and\ngovernment contracts law when the claims were submitted to the United States\ngovernment.\n\n       Attorney Peters confirmed at trial that Gulf Group did not ask for an inflated or\nfalse claim to be submitted. Attorney Peters stated that it was his experience, as a\nformer military commander, that the Army would “not change horses in midstream” and\nwould continue the calls on BPAs. Attorney Peters also testified that the expense table\nwas included to show that Gulf Group was prepared to perform, not that Gulf Group was\nclaiming costs it had not incurred. Similarly, Attorney Hands appears to have honestly\nmistaken what costs plaintiff had incurred and to have had an honest belief in plaintiff’s\nflawed reasoning presented in the early claims and complaints.\n\n       At trial Saud Al Tawash readily admitted that Gulf Group had made mistakes in\nsubmitting the camp package BPA claims to the government. Saud Al Tawash pointed\nto his unfamiliarity with how to submit claims to the United States government and lack\nof understanding of the American claims process, as well as his status as a foreign\nnational, as having played a large role in what occurred. Saud Al Tawash conceded:\n\n      Yes, we did have mistakes in our claims because we don’t have\n      experience. But here we have contract in office from the leading military\n      in the world that we have high respect for and look very high up at which\n      are well-trained and well looked at and, you know, what we’ve been taught\n      in school was the opposite of what’s been actually in reality. We were\n      taught in school that there’s arbitration. There’s, you know, courts in\n      Paris, courts in locally with the Chamber of Commerce. None of that\n      happened. I mean, in Kuwait, we will never, never get to a court. They’ll\n      try to resolve it even at the police station, imagine, before it even goes up\n      to -- because it takes a lot of resources from both sides. I mean, this case\n      has been very expensive for us and I’m sure for the government. And had\n      we sat down in 2004 -- in 2005 and tried to resolve these issues, we would\n      not be here, sir.\n\n       In Daewoo, the Court of Federal Claims noted that Daewoo submitted an inflated\nclaim to get the government to “pay attention.” Daewoo Eng’g & Constr. Co. v. United\nStates, 73 Fed. Cl. at 585. The Court of Federal Claims stated:\n\n\n\n                                           88\n\f       The Project Manager testified at one point that Daewoo filed at least $50\n       million of the claim to indicate “the seriousness of the situation” and to get\n       the Government to “pay attention” so it would agree to a cheaper method\n       of constructing embankments. If so, this is further evidence of bad faith. It\n       means that Daewoo submitted a certified claim as a negotiating ploy; that\n       is, for a reason other than an attempt to recover money for which Daewoo\n       believed the Government is liable.\n\nId. (citations and footnote omitted). As noted by the Federal Circuit in affirming the trial\ncourt’s decision in Daewoo, “[i]It is well established that a baseless certified claim is a\nfraudulent claim.” Daewoo Eng’g & Constr. Co. v. United States, 557 F.3d at 1339.\n\n        Attorney Peters testified he expected the 2005 camp package BPA Claim and\nSettlement Offer would be a starting point for settlement negotiations. At a minimum,\ncounsel for plaintiff, if not Saud Al Tawash, as plaintiff’s representative, should have\nknown that to submit a claim that could not be substantiated as amounting to the actual\nvalue of the claim resulted in the making of a false claim. Although Gulf Group may\nnow understand that some of its claims were incorrect, and this court concludes that the\n2005 and 2007 camp package BPA claims were submitted with reckless disregard in\nviolation of the False Claims Act, there is insufficient evidence in the record to find that\nGulf Group intended to deceive or mislead the government, as required under the\nContract Disputes Act, when it submitted its camp package BPA claims.103\n\nB.     The Latrine Contract Claims under the False Claims Act and the Contract\n       Disputes Act\n\n        In response to plaintiff’s various complaints in the latrine case, defendant alleges\nthat plaintiff violated the False Claims Act by submitting claims for services and supplies\nunder the latrine contract, which were not provided. Defendant asserts that the claimed\nexpenses plaintiff had not incurred included expenses for all of the potential option\nperiods for the latrine contract. According to defendant, the amount in plaintiff’s 2007\nclaim and original complaint exceeds the total possible contract price. Defendant also\nalleges that “Gulf Group is liable to the United States pursuant to the Contract Disputes\nAct, 41 U.S.C. § 7103(c)(2), for the unsupported claim, plus the Government’s costs\nattributable to reviewing the claim,” because “Gulf Group knowingly and deliberately\ncertified entitlement to $4,558,428.60 for Contract 0932 [the latrine contract], despite\nthat: (a) the total contract award was $613,142.86; (b) the contract was terminated 25\ndays [sic] into the performance period; and (c) this contract was obtained through\n\n\n\n103\n   Because the court finds that plaintiff is not liable for the amount of its unsubstantiated\ncamp package BPA claims under the Contract Disputes Act, the court does not further\naddress defendant’s position that the amount of plaintiff’s settlement offer constitutes\nthe amount of its 2005 certified claim, rather than the amount for which plaintiff asserted\nentitlement.\n\n\n                                             89\n\fbribery.”104 Defendant identifies $5,373,469.64 as the unsupported amount of plaintiff’s\n2007 claim, which asserted entitlement to more than the total potential contract price,\n$6,000,000.00, and attorneys’ fees, which, according to defendant, were later identified\nas $13,387.50,105 even though the base period price of the latrine contract was\n$613,142.86. In addition, defendant argues that plaintiff asserted entitlement to\n$266,335.04106 in unsupported costs in its 2005 and 2007 submissions. Defendant\nasserts that the claimed amount, including the costs not incurred, was merely a\nnegotiating ploy. Defendant argues, with respect to plaintiff’s 2007 latrine claim\npresented to the Army for $6,000,000.00, that “the only reasonable explanation of the\nlatrine claim amount is that it was a negotiating ploy, and not an amount to which Gulf\nGroup could have honestly believed it was entitled.”\n\n        Plaintiff argues that it sought the full contract price for the base period and the\noption periods for the latrine contract because it believed that but for the terminations, it\nwould have performed the full potential term of the contract, and that this amount was\nthe sum that the government would have paid for its services. Plaintiff contends that it\nsought payment for the full contract price, including all the option periods, based on\ncase law, which plaintiff asserts establishes that a contractor may recover for\nunexercised option periods if the government made an arbitrary, capricious, or bad faith\ndecision not to exercise the option periods. Plaintiff also asserts that the government,\nthrough Maj. Davis, expressly told the bidders submitting proposals on the latrine\ncontract to include option periods because Maj. Davis believed there was a reasonable\nlikelihood the option periods would be exercised. Furthermore, plaintiff argues the\noption periods were in fact exercised with respect to other contractors who received\ncontracts for the same latrine services Gulf Group had been awarded. According to\nplaintiff, Maj. Davis told Saud Al Tawash that the contracts were “long-term” and for\npermanent camps, and that the Army required Gulf Group to supply brand new latrines\n104\n     As with the camp package BPA, defendant’s second amended answer interprets\nplaintiff’s settlement offer as the amount to which plaintiff claimed entitlement in its 2005\nlatrine contract claim. As indicated above, plaintiff asserted entitlement to more than\nthe amount of its settlement offer in its 2005 claim. The allegation regarding bribery is\ndiscussed below.\n105\n     Defendant inaccurately alleges that plaintiff claimed entitlement to $13,387.50 in\nlegal fees. A “notice of filing revised claim” that plaintiff filed in the latrine case in 2011\nclaimed entitlement to a total of $13,837.50, although the individual entries\ncorresponding to the legal fees plaintiff claims amount to $13,887.50. In addition,\nalthough defendant includes legal fees, which should be not recoverable given the\ninflated amount submitted by plaintiff with respect to the camp package BPA claim,\ndefendant inexplicably treats the legal fees that plaintiff incurred as recoverable with\nrespect to the latrine contract claim.\n106\n    As indicated below, in the court’s discussion of plaintiff’s claims, defendant\ninexplicably indicated that plaintiff had validly incurred 68,289.630 KD of costs that\nplaintiff did not claim in its 2011 notice for the latrine contract, potentially confusing\nplaintiff’s identification of 68,910.000 KD of costs plaintiff claimed to have avoided.\n\n                                              90\n\fon the contract, although the base period of the contract was only for four months.\nPlaintiff also indicates that Attorney Peters informed plaintiff it was the Army’s policy not\nto interrupt service, based on his own personal experience in Bosnia.\n\n       As with the camp package BPA claims, plaintiff contends that the expense table,\nattached as an appendix to the 2005 latrine contract Claim and Settlement Offer, was\nincluded merely to show that plaintiff was prepared to perform, and was not to be\nconsidered part of its claim. Moreover, plaintiff states that it was reasonable to submit a\nclaim in excess of the total potential contract price because an additional amount for\ninterest and attorneys’ fees normally would be granted.\n\n        Moreover, as with the 2005 camp package BPA Claim and Settlement Offer,\nplaintiff’s 2005 latrine Claim and Settlement Offer was prepared and certified by\nAttorney Peters, and the cover letter were signed by Saud Al Tawash. In the 2005\nlatrine Claim and Settlement Offer, plaintiff offered settlement in the amount of\n$4,558,428.60, an amount less than that to which plaintiff believed it was entitled, which\nplaintiff calculated to be $5,058,428.59 for the full potential contract price, including the\nbase period and all option periods. The 2005 latrine Claim and Settlement Offer stated\nthat Gulf Group “should be allowed full profit,” and “should also be compensated fully for\nthe costs incurred in furtherance of the contract. The contract costs, when added to the\nanticipated contract profit, total $5,058,428.59, the full contract price.” Nevertheless,\nGulf Group indicated it was “willing at this time to accept $4,558,428.60 as full and final\nsettlement.” Neither Saud Al Tawash nor Attorney Peters gave an explanation of the\nbasis for the proposed settlement amount. Attorney Peters did state at trial, however, “I\nadmit this is pretty aggressive in what we are going for here, but I had a bad faith\nsituation, and a bad faith termination. So there was no reason not to be aggressive with\nthe military.” As noted above, plaintiff dropped any possible claims of bad faith in any of\nthe four above-captioned cases. Attorney Peters also indicated that the final settlement\namount was approximately five to ten percent lower than the claimed amount.\n\n        In its 2007 claim submitted to the Army for the latrine contract, plaintiff increased\nthe amount sought to a sum larger than the total potential contract price, $6,000,000.00.\nThe 2007 claim did not deduct any costs that Gulf Group would have incurred had the\ncontract been fully performed. As with the initial camp package BPA claim, Gulf Group\nwould have been better off receiving the claimed amount than had it performed and had\nthe government awarded every option period of the latrine contract, a result which the\nlaw does not allow. See White v. Delta Constr. Int’l, Inc., 285 F.3d at 1043 (“[T]he non-\nbreaching party is ‘not entitled to be put in a better position by the recovery than if the\n[other party] had fully performed the contract.’” (second bracket in original) (quoting\nMiller v. Robertson, 266 U.S. at 260)).\n\n        Saud Al Tawash testified that he did not know why the 2005 latrine Claim and\nSettlement Offer was submitted for more than the entire contract price. In a post-trial\nbrief, however, plaintiff argued that it sought more than the potential contract price in\n\n\n\n\n                                             91\n\forder to include interest and attorneys’ fees.107 The 2007 claim submitted to the\ncontracting officer states that it seeks preparatory expenses, unpaid services rendered,\nlost profits, legal fees, and interest, despite the fact that in the 2006 original complaint\nfor the latrine case, Case No. 06-858C, which claimed $6,000,000.00, plaintiff asked for\nthat sum, “together with interest, costs and attorney fees.” In its first amended\ncomplaint in the latrine case, Case No. 06-858C, plaintiff sought 1,572,967.611 KD,\nwhich is more than the full latrine contract price, including the base and option periods,\nas calculated by plaintiff in its 2005 claim. In its second amended complaint, plaintiff\nnow seeks $2,830.662.20 on the latrine contract.\n\n        As with plaintiff’s 2005 camp package BPA Claim and Settlement Offer, Gulf\nGroup included with its latrine 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer an expense table, listing\ncost items it would never incur, nor could incur, given the cancellation of the contract\ntwenty days after contract award. The expense table shows a total under the “Expense”\ncolumn of 171,044.970 KD. The expense table also shows an expenditure for seven\nhundred fifty-six latrines. Saud Al Tawash testified the number of latrines on the\nexpense table was a mistake made by Gulf Group’s accounting department, given that\nthe latrine contract only called for four hundred latrines. The record reflects that Gulf\nGroup purchased six hundred latrines, of which only four hundred were intended for the\nlatrine contract at issue before this court. Attorney Peters and Saud Al Tawash gave\nthe same explanation in their trial testimony for including the expense table in the 2005\nlatrine Claim and Settlement Offer as had been offered regarding the 2005 camp\npackage BPA Claim and Settlement Offer, namely that it was only offered for proof that\nplaintiff was prepared to perform. At trial, Attorney Peters acknowledged that the\nterminology he used in the latrine Claim and Settlement Offer was “a little bit\nmisleading.” Mr. Peters also alleged that the Claim and Settlement Offers were to be a\nstarting point for settlement negotiations with the Army.\n\n        Despite plaintiff’s assertions that plaintiff had case law support for including the\noption periods in their contract claims, plaintiff ultimately conceded at closing argument\nthat no such case law exists in direct support of its position. Instead, plaintiff argued\nthat the principle of the law should be analogized, such that a finding of a bad faith\ntermination on a primary contract also would permit damages on unexercised option\nperiods. The case law plaintiff cites as providing a basis for seeking lost profits on\noption periods refers to situations in which the wronged contractor can prove that the\ngovernment chose, in bad faith, not to exercise the option periods, see Hi-Shear Tech.\nCorp. v. United States, 356 F.3d at 1374, 1375, 1380; Blackstone Consulting, Inc. v.\nGen. Servs. Admin., CBCA 718, 08-1 BCA ¶ 33,770; Greenlee Constr., Inc. v. Gen.\nServs. Admin., CBCA 416, 07-1 BCA ¶ 33,514, and not to situations in which the\ngovernment chose to terminate a contract during a base period without ever reaching or\neven making a decision as to the option periods. In the latrine case currently before the\ncourt, there is no evidence that, had the contract not been terminated, the government\n107\n   For much of its argument in its post-trial briefing, plaintiff combines the discussion of\nthe latrine and dumpster claims. It appears that when plaintiff stated that it claimed\nmore than the contract price because it included interest and attorneys’ fees, plaintiff\nwas applying the statement to both the latrine and dumpster claims.\n\n                                            92\n\fwould have exercised the option periods, or would have not exercised option periods in\nbad faith. Nor is the government generally obligated to exercise an option. See Gov’t\nSys. Advisors, Inc. v. United States, 847 F.2d at 813 (“An option is normally an option,\nand nothing in [the provision at issue], or in any other contract clause, limited the\ncircumstances under which the government could decline to exercise that bargained-for\nright in this case.”); see also Sundowner 102, LLC v. United States, 108 Fed. Cl. at 741.\n\n        As with plaintiff’s 2005 camp package BPA Claim and Settlement Offer submitted\nto the Army, Saud Al Tawash admitted having failed to review the 2005 latrine Claim\nand Settlement Offer before it was submitted, despite signing the cover page. Saud Al\nTawash cannot hide behind the mistakes of plaintiff’s attorneys for a claim he also\nsigned, and which he did not investigate before he approved it. At trial, Saud Al Tawash\ntestified that Mr. Peters “didn’t give me a justification [for the 2005 latrines claim\namount] but he did tell me that what is the amount of the contract.” In response to the\nquestion, “Did you ask Mr. Peters for a justification for this claim amount?” Saud Al\nTawash responded, “No, but I think that there is a, I think he put here this number....”\nWhen asked “[w]hat was the purpose of submitting a claim for $5 million along with a\nsettlement amount of $4.5 million?” Saud Al Tawash testified that “you’d have to ask\nMr. Peters.”\n\n        In sum, the submission of both the 2005 and 2007 latrine claims, like the camp\npackage BPA claims, were made in reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the\ninformation contained therein. Plaintiff did not conduct even a minimal inquiry into the\nbasis for the claims, see Daewoo Eng’g & Constr. Co. v. United States, 557 F.3d at\n1340; see also United States v. TDC Mgmt. Corp., 24 F.3d at 298, and prepared them\nin such a “sloppy or unsupervised fashion” that the government was overbilled. See\n132 Cong. Rec. H9,382-03. Plaintiff is responsible as the applicant for the claimed\namounts and for the accuracy of the claims, regardless of who prepared them. See\nMiller v. United States, 213 Ct. Cl. at 70, 550 F.2d at 23; see also Comm. Contractors,\nInc. v. United States, 154 F.3d at 1362. The numbers included in the submissions\ncontained more than mere math errors or flawed reasoning. See Wang ex rel. United\nStates v. FMC Corp., 975 F.2d at 1420-21. Had Saud Al Tawash reviewed the latrine\nclaims, as he should have, he would have realized they were in error. As a\nbusinessman, Saud Al Tawash should have understood that claiming more than the\nvalue of a contract is improper and not to undertake even a basic level of due diligence\nis unacceptable. The errors were particularly egregious in that the 2007 claim was for\nnearly one million dollars more than the entire contract price, even if plaintiff had not\nbeen in error in claiming option periods. The 2005 and 2007 latrine claims were\nsubmitted with reckless disregard as to their truth or falsity, and, therefore, under the\nstatutory definition, were “false claims,” pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 3729.\n\n       As with the camp package BPA claims, despite finding a violation of the False\nClaims Act, and defendant’s correct assertion that Gulf Group submitted claims in\nexcess of the amount of the terminated latrine contract, defendant has not proven that\nthe claims were made with the intent to deceive the government, as required for liability\nunder the Contract Disputes Act. As quoted above, at trial, Saud Al Tawash admitted to\n\n\n                                           93\n\fhaving made mistakes and testified that he honestly believed the 2005 latrine claim was\ncorrect when it was submitted. The court had considerable opportunity to judge Saud Al\nTawash’s credibility during the course of his testimony and finds him sincere and\ncredible. Moreover, plaintiff was relying on Attorneys Peters’ and Hands’ experience in\nAmerican law and their supposed understanding of how to submit contract claims to the\nUnited States government. Plaintiff appears to have misunderstood, and was given\nimproper legal advice as to how to calculate and submit a government contract claim,\nas well as how to calculate the amount to which plaintiff could be entitled. Plaintiff’s\nnew attorney of record similarly adopted the flawed reasoning. Although the latrine\nclaims were submitted with a reckless disregard for their accuracy, reckless disregard\ndoes not prove an intent to deceive under the Contract Disputes Act. Plaintiff should\nnot be held liable under the Contract Disputes Act for the latrine contract claims\nbecause defendant has not proven an intent to deceive on the part of Saud Al Tawash\nand Gulf Group.108\n\nC.     The Dumpster Contract Claims under the False Claims Act and the Contract\n       Disputes Act\n\n        In response to plaintiff’s complaint in the dumpster case, Case No. 06-853C,\ndefendant alleges that plaintiff violated the False Claims Act in its submission of the\n2005 and 2007 dumpster claims because plaintiff inflated its claims to include services\nand supplies plaintiff never provided. Defendant states that plaintiff had no legal basis\nfor claiming the option periods in its dumpster claim; sought payment for expenses it did\nnot incur; and asked for a sum greater than the entire contract price, including all of the\noption periods. Defendant also claims that Gulf Group “is unable to support its\n[dumpster] claim, as alleged above, due to a misrepresentation of fact or fraud,” and\nthat “Gulf Group knowingly and deliberately certified entitlement to $999,994.67109 for\nContract 0897, despite the fact that: (a) the total contract award was for $346,998.00;\n(b) the contract was terminated 33 days [sic] into the performance period; and (c) the\ncontract is tainted by bribery.” According to the defendant, “Gulf Group is liable to the\nUnited States pursuant to the Contract Disputes Act, 41 U.S.C. § 7103(c)(2), for the\nunsupported claim, plus the Government’s costs attributable to reviewing the claim.”\nDefendant identifies $1,439,614.50 as the unsupported amount of plaintiff’s 2007 claim,\nwhich asserted entitlement to more than the total potential contract price,\n$1,800,000.00, and attorneys’ fees, which, according to defendant, later were identified\n\n108\n    As with the camp package BPA claims, because the court finds that plaintiff is not\nliable for the amount of its unsubstantiated latrine contract claims under the Contract\nDisputes Act, the court does not further address defendant’s position that the amount of\nplaintiff’s settlement offer constitutes the amount of its 2005 certified claim for the latrine\ncontract.\n109\n     As with the camp package BPA and latrine contract claims, defendant’s answer\ninterprets plaintiff’s settlement offer as the amount to which plaintiff claimed entitlement\nin its 2005 dumpster contract claim. As indicated above, plaintiff asserted entitlement to\nmore than the amount of its settlement offer in its 2005 claim.\n\n                                              94\n\fas $13,387.50,110 even though the base period price of the dumpster contract was\n$346,998.00. In addition, defendant argues that plaintiff asserted entitlement to\n$415,195.29111 in unsupported costs in its 2005 and 2007 submissions. Defendant also\ncontends that plaintiff sought costs it had not incurred and that the claimed amount was\nmerely a negotiating ploy.\n\n       Plaintiff offered the same arguments regarding the dumpster claims as it did with\nrespect to the camp package BPA claims and the latrine claims, namely that the law\nprovides for lost profits on option periods when the decision not to exercise the options\nwas made in bad faith or as a result of an abuse of discretion. As noted above,\nhowever, plaintiff ultimately conceded to the court at closing argument that no such\ncase law exists in direct support of its position, and argued the principle of the law\nshould be analogized, such that a finding of a bad faith termination during the base\nperiod of a contract also would permit damages on unexercised option periods. As\nnoted above, the case law plaintiff cites as providing a basis for seeking lost profits on\noption periods refers to situations in which the wronged contractor can prove that the\ngovernment chose, in bad faith, not to exercise the option periods, see Hi-Shear Tech.\nCorp. v. United States, 356 F.3d at 1374, 1375, 1380; Blackstone Consulting, Inc. v.\nGen. Servs. Admin., CBCA 718, 08-1 BCA ¶ 33,770; Greenlee Constr., Inc. v. Gen.\nServs. Admin., CBCA 416, 07-1 BCA ¶ 33,514, and not to situations in which the\ngovernment chose to terminate a contract during the base period without ever reaching\nor even making a decision as to the option periods.\n\n        Plaintiff also argued, as it did with respect to the camp package BPA and the\nlatrine claims, that the expense table in the dumpster claims was included merely to\ndemonstrate readiness to perform the contract, that plaintiff claimed more than the\ncontract price because it was including interest and attorneys’ fees, and that the Army\nsignaled to plaintiff that the option periods were likely to be exercised. Plaintiff contends\nthat by requiring plaintiff to supply dumpsters with lids, which plaintiff had to special\norder, the government must have intended to exercise the option periods. For the\nreasons discussed above with respect to the camp package BPA claims and latrine\nclaims, the court finds that plaintiff also acted with reckless disregard when submitting\nits dumpster claims.\n110\n    Similar to the latrine claim, defendant inaccurately alleges that plaintiff claimed\nentitlement to $13,387.50 in legal fees with respect to the dumpster claim. Plaintiff’s\n2011 notice for the dumpster contract claimed entitlement to a total of $13,837.50. The\nindividual entries corresponding to legal fees plaintiff claims in the 2011 notice for the\ndumpster contract, however, amount to $13,887.50. Also similar to the latrine contract\nclaim submitted by plaintiff, although defendant includes legal fees, which should be not\nrecoverable given the inflated amount submitted by plaintiff with respect to the camp\npackage BPA claim, defendant inexplicably treats the legal fees that plaintiff incurred as\nrecoverable with respect to the dumpster contract claim.\n111\n    As indicated below, defendant inexplicably indicated that plaintiff had validly incurred\n20,540.000 KD of costs that plaintiff actually claimed to have avoided in its 2011 notice\nfor the dumpster contract.\n\n                                             95\n\f        The price for the base period of the dumpster contract was $346,998.00 and the\nsum of the all the option periods was $1,110,621.72. Therefore, the total potential price\nof the dumpster contract, including the base period and option periods, was\n$1,457,619.72.112 In its 2007 dumpster claim submitted to the Army, plaintiff nearly\ndoubled the amount sought, even from its 2005 settlement offer of $999,994.67 to\n$1,800,000.00, although this amount exceeded the total potential contract price by\napproximately $350,000.00. The $1,800,000.00 figure was the amount of damages\nclaimed in plaintiff’s December 19, 2006 original complaint in this court in Case No. 06-\n853C, the dumpster case.113 In plaintiff’s first amended complaint, plaintiff increased its\nclaim for damages to $1,946,721.78, which is nearly $500,000.00 more than the total\ncontract price, including all option periods. In its second amended complaint, plaintiff\ndrastically reduced the amount it is claiming to $780,031.63, which is still $400,000.00\nmore than the entire base period value of $346,998.00. As with plaintiff’s other claims,\nregarding its dumpster claim, plaintiff also argues that a wronged party is to be put in as\ngood a position as it would have been but for the breach. By claiming the amounts\nplaintiff claimed, however, plaintiff has asked to be put in a better position than it was in\nbefore the alleged breach. Moreover, plaintiff’s inflated numbers were substantially\nhigher than the full value of the contract, despite the fact that plaintiff’s dumpster\ncontract was terminated less than a month after it was awarded.\n\n        At trial, Saud Al Tawash testified he did not know why Gulf Group had claimed\nmore than the full contract price for the dumpster contract. Saud Al Tawash and\nplaintiff’s original attorney, Mr. Peters, offered the same explanations as he had offered\nwith respect to the camp package BPA claims and the latrine claims, testifying that the\nexpense table was included merely to show that Gulf Group was prepared to perform.\nPlaintiff’s expense table for the dumpster claim shows a total under the expense column\nof 200,501.200 KD, although Gulf Group later revealed it had spent only 59,927.871\nKD. Although Attorney Peters testified at trial that the expense table was not included\nas support for the claim, that fact was entirely unclear in the claim as submitted,\nparticularly given that the claim states in one section, “[t]his offer includes\nreimbursement of both costs and lost profits,” which could indicate costs incurred, while\nin another section, the claim suggests that costs and profits total $1,110,621.72, which\nappears to encompass the unincurred costs. Furthermore, regarding the 2005\n\n112\n    At trial, it appeared from Saud Al Tawash’s testimony that he believed the base\nperiod and the option periods for the dumpster contract together totaled $1,110,621.72.\nThis view is reflected in the 2005 claim to the Army, which stated, “it [Gulf Group]\nplaintiff should be allowed full profit. Gulf Enterprises also should be compensated fully\nfor the costs incurred in furtherance of the contract. The contract costs, when added to\nthe anticipated contract profit, total $1,110,621.72.”\n113\n    Plaintiff alleged that “[a]s a result of the Government’s cancellation of the Contract\nsolely for the convenience of the Government, Gulf Group incurred damages in the form\nof preparatory expenses, unpaid services actually rendered, lost profits, and legal fees\nin the amount presently estimated to be $1,800,000.”\n\n                                             96\n\fdumpster Claim and Settlement Offer, Saud Al Tawash similarly admitted that he signed\nthe cover page of the dumpster claim without reviewing the details of the claim.\n\n        Plaintiff’s actions with regard to the submission of the dumpster claims were in\nreckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the claims. As with the camp package BPA\nclaims and the latrine contract claims, plaintiff did not conduct even a minimal inquiry\ninto the claims, see Miller v. United States, 213 Ct. Cl. at 70, 550 F.2d at 23; see also\nUnited States v. Krizek, 111 F.3d at 942; United States v. TDC Mgmt. Corp., 24 F.3d at\n298, and the dumpster claims were prepared in such a “sloppy or unsupervised fashion”\nthat the government was overbilled. See 132 Cong. Rec. H9,382-03. Plaintiff is\nresponsible as the applicant for the accuracy of the claims, regardless of who prepared\nthem. See Daewoo Eng’g & Constr. Co. v. United States, 557 F.3d at 1340; see also\nComm. Contractors, Inc. v. United States, 154 F.3d at 1362. The submissions were the\nresult of more than mere math errors or flawed reasoning. See Wang ex rel. United\nStates v. FMC Corp., 975 F.2d at 1420-21. Had Saud Al Tawash reviewed the claims\nsubmitted under the dumpster contract, the court finds it difficult to believe that he would\nnot have realized that the claims were significantly inflated, particularly considering that\nthe 2007 claim was for a far greater amount than the total potential contract price. The\n2005 and 2007 dumpster claims were submitted with reckless disregard as to their truth\nor falsity, and, therefore, under the statutory definition of “false claims” pursuant to 31\nU.S.C. § 3729, violated the False Claims Act.\n\n       For the same reasons articulated above with respect to the camp package BPA\nclaims and the latrine contract claims, although plaintiff is liable under the False Claims\nAct for submitting claims in reckless disregard of their truth or falsity, that failure does\nnot automatically result in a finding of plaintiff’s intent to deceive when submitting the\ndumpster contract claims under the Contract Disputes Act. As noted above, the court\nhad considerable opportunity to observe Saud Al Tawash in the courtroom as plaintiff’s\nprincipal representative, including during lengthy testimony, cross-examination, and\nrebuttal, to reach its conclusion that, although Saud Al Tawash admitted to having made\nmistakes when submitting the dumpster contract claims, Saud Al Tawash offered\nsincere and credible testimony that revealed no intent to deceive. Defendant has not\nproven an intent to deceive on the part of plaintiff regarding the dumpster contract\nclaims and, therefore, has not proven liability under the Contract Disputes Act.114\n\nD.     The Bottled Water BPA Demurrage Claim under the False Claims Act and the\n       Contract Disputes Act\n\n      In its second amended answer to plaintiff’s complaint under the bottled water\nBPA, Case No. 07-82C, defendant asserts that plaintiff’s demurrage claim arising under\nthe bottled water BPA was inflated because it sought reimbursement for demurrage\n114\n    Because the court finds that plaintiff is not liable for the amount of its unsubstantiated\ndumpster contract claims under the Contract Disputes Act, the court does not further\naddress defendant’s position that the amount of plaintiff’s settlement offer constitutes\nthe amount to which plaintiff would be liable when its 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer\nripened into a claim.\n\n                                             97\n\fexpenses that were not incurred. In its briefing to this court, defendant argues that\nplaintiff submitted an 85.000 KD/day claim for demurrage for charges from its trucking\ncompany, Expeditors, although Expeditors charged only between 50.000 and 60.000\nKD/day. Defendant also contends that plaintiff’s claim was fraudulent because it did not\nconsider whether any of the delays were caused by entities other than the Army (citing\nDaewoo Eng’g & Constr. Co. v. United States, 557 F.3d at 1338).\n\n        In response, plaintiff states that the amount it claimed for demurrage has\nconsistently been 298,435.000 KD, and that the 85.000 KD/day rate included not only\nthe charges from Expeditors, but also charges for cargo insurance, administrative and\nlogistical expenses, staging area and warehouse rentals to store the water, local\ntransportation, labor, and equipment handling. Plaintiff admits, however, that its claim\nwas not complete when submitted, and failed to include all the documents necessary to\nfully support the charges it had incurred in addition to those from Expeditors.\n\n      Unlike plaintiff’s claims under the camp package BPA, the latrine contract, and\nthe dumpster contract, Gulf Group’s bottled water BPA demurrage claim remained\nconstant throughout the period between when the claim was filed with the Army and\nwhen the complaint and amended complaints were filed in this court in Case No. 07-\n82C. Also unlike plaintiff’s other three claims, plaintiff did not submit a revised bottled\nwater demurrage claim to the Army. In 2005, Gulf Group submitted a claim to the\ncontracting officer for 298,435.000 KD. In its first complaint filed in the United States\nCourt of Federal Claims, plaintiff again sought 298,435.000 KD. In its first amended\ncomplaint, it requested the same amount, and in its second amended complaint, plaintiff\nagain sought 298,435.000 KD. Thus, in stark contrast to its camp package BPA, latrine\ncontract, and dumpster contract claims, plaintiff has presented a consistent request for\nthe demurrage damages it alleges it incurred performing under the bottled water BPA.\n\n        Attorney Peters prepared plaintiff’s 2005 bottled water BPA demurrage claim and\npresented it to the Army on behalf of plaintiff, as he had done for the 2005 camp\npackage BPA, latrine, and dumpster Claim and Settlement Offers. In the case of the\nbottled water demurrage claims, however, Attorney Peters buttressed the claim with\nmore documentation, attempting to show the basis for the dinars charged. Although the\n2005 bottled water demurrage claim was incomplete, because the 2005 claim included\nonly documentation showing the charges from Expeditors, the company Gulf Group\nhired to transport the water, plaintiff subsequently provided the court with a chart\nbreaking down each demurrage expense incurred. The chart lists detailed\nexpenditures, often by date and name, for insurance, staff salaries, vehicles,\nwarehousing, staging area rent, local transportation, and loading and unloading, and it\nprovides a brief description of the nature of the charges. Plaintiff has admitted that its\n2005 bottled water demurrage claim was incomplete. The demurrage chart and the\nadditional documentation attached to the demurrage chart was not included in the 2005\nbottled water claim. In this instance, the court finds that plaintiff’s error was an “honest\nmistake.” See Riley Constr. Corp. v. United States, 65 Fed. Cl. at 269; see also United\nStates v. Sci. Applications Int’l Corp., 626 F.3d at 1274-75. There is no indication that\nplaintiff’s failure to include the demurrage chart and the additional documentation\n\n\n                                            98\n\fattached to the demurrage chart was done with a reckless disregard for the truth or\nfalsity of the claim. The chart submitted to the court shows the dinars claimed, which\nappear to be a specific replication of the expenditures plaintiff claims it incurred as a\nresult of bottled water delays.\n\n        Reviewing the invoices from Expeditors in the 2005 bottled water demurrage\nclaim, it is apparent that Expeditors was not charging 85.000 KD/day. For example,\nExpeditors charged 720.000 KD for one truck’s delay of twelve days, a total of 60.000\nKD/day, not 85.000 KD. Although this fact may have been confusing to the contracting\nofficer, Mr. Libbey, nowhere in the 2005 bottled water demurrage claim does plaintiff\nstate that its expenses arose solely from Expeditors. Rather, plaintiff’s claim states that\nit is for “demurrage charges for delays,” and that Gulf Group “incurred delay\n(demurrage) and damages.” Plaintiff initially should have included the invoices from the\nother sources of the demurrage charges, but this absence does not indicate a reckless\ndisregard for the accuracy of the charges or that plaintiff’s claim was false. Plaintiff’s\nclaim for the bottled water BPA demurrage was far more straightforward and\ntransparent than plaintiff’s camp package BPA, latrine contract, and dumpster contract\nclaims. Although somewhat incomplete, the presentation of the demurrage claim does\nnot meet the reckless disregard standard regarding liability under the False Claims Act.\nIn the case of the demurrage claim, Saud Al Tawash and Mr. Peters presented claims\nwith substantiation attached, albeit, as it turned out, incomplete information. The court\ncannot condone Saud Al Tawash, as the General Manager and representative of Gulf\nGroup, for his minimal role in preparing the demurrage certified claim, nor the apparent\nblind faith he placed in his advisors to accurately present plaintiff’s claim. The testimony\nSaud Al Tawash offered throughout the trial to the court, however, was sincere and\noffered without reservation. With respect to the bottled water demurrage claim, there\nwas an attempt to document the claim and the claim numbers remained consistent, for\nwhich reason the requisite intent under the False Claims Act is found not to have been\npresent regarding the bottled water demurrage claims. Although Saud Al Tawash\nappears not to have reviewed this claim to any greater extent than he did the other\nclaims at issue in these cases, he was a fortunate beneficiary of a claim submission\nwhich met the most minimum standards and requirements for presenting a claim. As\ndefendant has not proven a knowing presentation of a false claim under the False\nClaims Act, defendant is likewise unable to prove an intent to deceive the government\nunder the Contract Disputes Act regarding the bottled water BPA demurrage claim.\n\nII.    Special Plea in Fraud\n\n        Defendant also argues that all plaintiff’s claims should be forfeited under the\nSpecial Plea in Fraud statute, 28 U.S.C. § 2514, due to bribery in violation of 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2514, conflict of interest in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 208(a) (2000), and the submission\nof false claims. The Special Plea in Fraud statute provides:\n\n       A claim against the United States shall be forfeited to the United States by\n       any person who corruptly practices or attempts to practice any fraud\n\n\n\n                                            99\n\f       against the United States in the proof, statement, establishment, or\n       allowance thereof.\n\n       In such cases the United States Court of Federal Claims shall specifically\n       find such fraud or attempt and render judgment of forfeiture.\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2514; see also Daewoo Eng’g & Constr. Co. v. United States, 557 F.3d at\n1341.\n\n         Previous decisions by Judges of the United States Court of Federal Claims have\nindicated that “[t]he statutory forfeiture contemplated by 28 U.S.C. § 2514 is broad. The\nCourt of Claims has held that, upon a finding that claims are based on ‘a contract under\nwhich [a contractor] practiced fraud against the Government,’ as defined by this statute,\n‘all of his claims under that contract will be forfeited pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2514.’ Little\nv. United States, 138 Ct. Cl. 773, [778,] 152 F. Supp. 84, 88 (1957).” Veridyne Corp. v.\nUnited States, 83 Fed. Cl. 575, 586 (2008); see also Kellogg Brown & Root Servs., Inc.\nv. United States, 99 Fed. Cl. 488, 496 (2011). In American Heritage Bancorp, the court\nnoted that: “The use of the word ‘shall’ [in 28 U.S.C. § 2514] makes the judgment of\nforfeiture obligatory on the court; the court has no discretion to turn a blind eye to an\nattempt, whether successful or not, to commit fraud in the statement of a claim against\nthe United States.” Am. Heritage Bancorp v. United States, 61 Fed. Cl. 376, 385\n(2004). Similarly, a Judge of the Court of Federal Claims indicated that, “Section 2514\namounts to a ‘silver bullet’ which, in the present case, would require that [plaintiff’s]\nclaim be forfeited if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that [plaintiff] acted or\nmade false or misleading statements with the ‘intent to deceive the Government.’”\nFarkas v. United States, 57 Fed. Cl. 134, 146 (2003) (quoting Miller v. United States,\n213 Ct. Cl. at 68, 550 F.2d at 22), aff’d, 95 F. App’x 355 (Fed. Cir. 2004). In Glendale\nFederal Bank, FSB v. United States, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal\nCircuit “explained that ‘[t]o prevail under [28 U.S.C. § 2514] the government is required\nto establish by clear and convincing evidence115 that the contractor knew that its\nsubmitted claims were false, and that it intended to defraud the government by\nsubmitting those claims.’” Glendale Fed.

United States, 557 F.3d at 1341 (“To\n\n\n115\n   The “clear and convincing” standard applies to proof under the Special Plea in Fraud\nstatute, 28 U.S.C. § 2514, as opposed to the preponderance of the evidence standard\napplicable to the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3729, and the Contract Disputes Act, 41\nU.S.C. § 604. See UMC Elecs. Co. v. United States, 249 F.3d at 1338-39 (“The\ngovernment must prove a violation of the Contract Disputes Act and False Claims Act\nby a preponderance of the evidence. Under the Special Plea in Fraud, the government\nmust prove its allegations by clear and convincing evidence.” (citing Comm.\nContractors, Inc. v. United States, 154 F.3d at 1362)).\n116\n   A Judge of the Court of Federal Claims also has indicated that, regarding 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2514, “[a] predicate for forfeiture under this statute is the establishment of fraud,\n\n                                            100\n\fprevail under § 2514, the government must ‘establish by clear and convincing evidence\nthat the contractor knew that its submitted claims were false, and that it intended to\ndefraud the government by submitting those claims.’” (quoting Comm.

United States, 15 F.3d at\n1042 (“Under 28 U.S.C. § 2514, the government bears the burden of proving that the\nclaimant (1) knew the claim was false and (2) intended to deceive the government by\nsubmitting it.” (citing McCarthy v.

Cl. 619,\n641, 124 F. Supp. 608, 620 (1954).\n\n        Mere negligence, inconsistency, or discrepancies are not actionable under the\nSpecial Plea in Fraud statute. See Daewoo Eng’g & Constr. Co. v. United States, 73\nFed. Cl. at 584; Veridyne Corp. v. United States, 105 Fed. Cl. at 801; Grand Acadian,\nInc. v. United States, 105 Fed. Cl. at 457-58 (“‘Proof of negligence or ineptitude does\nnot meet the standard of clear and convincing evidence; rather, “[a]n intent to deceive\nthe Government must be proved.”’” (bracket in original) (quoting Alcatec, LLC v. United\nStates, 100 Fed. Cl. at 517 (quoting Miller v. United States, 213 Ct. Cl. at 68, 550 F.2d\nat 22))). “The court may, however, consider circumstantial evidence in making its\ndetermination.” Alcatec, LLC v. United States, 100 Fed. Cl. at 517 (citing Kamen Soap\nProds. Co. v. United States, 129 Ct. Cl. at 642, 124 F. Supp. at 620).\n\n      As articulated by a Judge of the United States Court of Federal Claims:\n\n      In order to satisfy § 2514, however, the fraud alleged must be related to\n      the contract at issue. Little v. United States, 138 Ct. Cl. 773, 152 F. Supp.\n      84, 87-88 (1957). Fraud in an unrelated transaction will not lead to\n      forfeiture under this statute. However, when fraud is committed in regard\n      to the very contract upon which the suit is brought, the court will not divide\n      the contract and allow recovery on part of it. Id.; UMC Electronics v.\n      United States, 43 Fed. Cl. 776, 791 (1999), aff’d, 249 F.3d at 1340 ([Fed.\n      Cir.] 2001).\n\n      In order to prevail in its defense of fraud under 28 U.S.C. § 2514, the\n      “burden is on the government to establish by clear and convincing\n      evidence that the claimant has committed the fraud alleged.” Glendale,\n      239 F.3d at 1379; UMC Electronics, 43 Fed. Cl. at 791 (internal citation\n      omitted). This requirement has more specifically been rendered in the\n      following way: “in order that a misrepresentation be fraudulent...it must be\n      both consciously false and intended to mislead.” E. Allan Farnsworth,\n\nalthough the statute itself does not articulate the elements of fraud.” Veridyne Corp. v.\nUnited States, 105 Fed. Cl. at 801.\n\n                                           101\n\f      Farnsworth on Contracts, § 4.12 (2d Ed.1998). Thus, for the purposes of\n      § 2514, the government must show: 1) that the plaintiff made a false\n      statement to the government knowing that it was false; and 2) that this\n      statement was intended to deceive the government. Glendale, 239 F.3d at\n      1379.\n\nAm. Heritage Bancorp v. United States, 61 Fed. Cl. at 385-86.\n\n       In Brown Construction Trades, Inc. v. United States, 23 Cl. Ct. 214 (1991), the\ncourt explained the breadth of the statutory intent in 28 U.S.C. § 2514:\n\n      This statute has been held to require the forfeiture of any claim affected by\n      fraud, whether intrinsic to the claim or in the presentment of the claim.\n      Kamen Soap Prods. Co. v. United States, 129 Ct. Cl. 619, 641, 124 F.\n      Supp. 608, 620 (1954) (“this statute goes further than merely banning\n      fraudulent claims. It provides for a forfeiture of the claim if any fraud is\n      practiced or attempted to be practiced in proving, establishing or allowing\n      a claim.”).\n\n      The Court of Claims has ruled that where fraud is committed in the course\n      of a contract to which the suit pertains, it may not isolate the affected part\n      and allow suit to proceed on the remainder. The practice of a fraud on\n      part of a contract condemns the whole. The rule is set out in Little v.\n      United States, 138 Ct. Cl. 773, 778, 152 F. Supp. 84, 87-88 (1957):\n\n             It is true that the forfeiture statute [28 U.S.C. § 2514] was not\n             intended to forfeit an otherwise valid claim of a claimant\n             merely because, in some other unrelated transaction, he had\n             defrauded the Government. But where, as in the present\n             case, fraud was committed in regard to the very contract\n             upon which the suit is brought, this court does not have the\n             right to divide the contract and allow recovery on part of it.\n             Since plaintiff’s claims are based entirely upon contract\n             V3020V-241, a contract under which he practiced fraud\n             against the Government, all of his claims under that contract\n             will be forfeited pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2514.\n\n      Thus, 28 U.S.C. § 2514 requires the forfeiture of all claims arising under a\n      contract tainted by fraud against the Government. See also New York\n      Mkt. Gardeners’ Ass’n v. United States, 43 Ct. Cl. 114, 136, 1907 WL 832\n      (1908).\n\nBrown Constr. Trades, Inc. v. United States, 23 Cl.

United States\nindicated that bribery in and of itself was sufficient to invoke liability under 28 U.S.C.\n\n                                           102\n\fUnited States, 110 Fed.

Co. v. United States, 73 Fed. Cl. at 584; see\nalso Barren Island Marina, Inc. v. United States, 44 Fed. Cl. 252, 257 (1999) (“The plain\nmeaning of the statute [28 U.S.C. § 2514] is that the value of the forfeiture is not\nrestricted or even linked to the value of the loss sustained by the government. For this\nreason, the forfeiture is not, strictly speaking, a remedy. Additionally, because forfeiture\nunder § 2514 requires demonstration of fraud-intentional conduct-the forfeiture is more\nakin to punishment.”), appeal dismissed, 54 F. App’x 329 (Fed. Cir.), vacated by 57 F.\nApp’x 427 (Fed. Cir.), and appeal dismissed, 66 F. App’x 878 (Fed. Cir. 2003).\n\n        With regard to the Special Plea in Fraud, asserted in Case No. 06-835C (the\ncamp package BPA), Case No. 06-858C (the latrine contract), Case No. 06-853C (the\ndumpster contract), and Case No. 07-82C (the bottled water BPA), the government\nalleges that the contracts and BPA calls were awarded in exchange for “money, trips,\nand other things of value” given by Gulf Group to Carolyn Blake, the sister of John\nCockerham, a former Army Major, contract specialist, and contracting officer at Camp\nArifjan, Kuwait. Defendant asserts that Gulf Group’s actions constituted fraud under the\nSpecial Plea in Fraud statute, 28 U.S.C. § 2514, requiring forfeiture of plaintiff’s claims,\nas Gulf Group’s actions created an unlawful conflict of interest and violated 18 U.S.C.\n§ 201(b)(1), which prohibits the offering or promising of anything of value to a public\nofficial with the intent to influence an official act. Defendant further alleges that Gulf\nGroup violated the Special Plea in Fraud statute by submitting false claims under each\ncontract and BPA to the United States government for an amount of money “to which it\nknew or knows it was not entitled.”\n\n       According to defendant:\n\n       In approximately September 2004, plaintiff, Gulf Group General\n       Enterprises, Co., W.L.L. (“Gulf Group”), began paying money to the sister\n       of John Cockerham, a United States Army contracting official. In return,\n       Mr. Cockerham performed contracting actions favorable to Gulf Group.\n       Those favorable contracting actions taint contracts that the Army awarded\n\n§ 2514. See Supermex, Inc. v. United States, 35 Fed. Cl. 29, 42 (1996) (“This court\nbelieves that in the instant case, 28 U.S.C. § 2514 can be invoked without the need to\nprove either justifiable reliance by the sovereign or specific evidences of injury to the\nsovereign. The injury and the damages to the sovereign are presumed in the breach of\nthe bond of public trust. In Versaggi Shrimp Corp. v. United States, 28 Fed. Cl. 20\n(1993), the court found that subversion of public officers, through acts such as bribery,\nis never without harm to the state. Id. at 25.”). In Supermex, however, the president of\nthe company pled guilty to bribing an official during contract performance, making it\neasily distinguishable from the facts presented in the record in the above-captioned\ncases, with respect to the actions of Gulf Group and its General Manager, Saud Al\nTawash.\n\n                                            103\n\f       to Gulf Group in late 2004, and in 2005, entitling the United States to a\n       refund of the money paid to Gulf Group pursuant to those contracts,118\n       and warranting forfeiture of all its claims in these actions. In December\n       2005, Gulf Group presented to Mr. Cockerham contract claims that were\n       inflated and contained misrepresentations regarding expenses that Gulf\n       Group claimed to have incurred on the contracts. In 2007, Gulf Group\n       resubmitted those claims, further inflating those claims, and repeating\n       those misrepresentations. Those claims are fraudulent, warranting\n       forfeiture to the United States of Gulf Group’s claims in these actions, an\n       award to the United States of the unsupported amounts of those claims,\n       and civil penalties. In total, the Court should award to the United States\n       $18,759,164.97. [sic] because the Court should order that Gulf Group’s\n       claims are forfeited, the Court need not address the merits of those\n       claims.\n\n       Defendant appears to argue that plaintiff’s alleged commission of common law\nfraud supports a finding that plaintiff violated the Special Plea in Fraud statute, and\nrequires rescission of the contracts and that plaintiff disgorge any amounts previously\npaid to plaintiff. “Proof of federal common law fraud requires the Government to show:\n(1) misrepresentation of a material fact; (2) intent to deceive; (3) justifiable reliance on\nthe misrepresentation by the deceived party; and (4) injury to the party deceived.”\nVeridyne Corp. v.

Cir. 2000)\n(disagreeing with the Federal Circuit).\n\n       In support of its argument that plaintiff should also disgorge money it received\nunder the contracts and BPAs, defendant cites to K & R Engineering Co. v.

Ct.\nApp. Div. 2006), and 63C American Jurisprudence 2d Public Officers and Employees\n§ 246 (2011), for the notion that there need be only the appearance of impropriety, or\nthe potential for impropriety, for a demonstration of a conflict of interest.\n\n       In response to defendant’s allegations, plaintiff asserts that the conflict of interest\nallegations are untrue and unfounded and denies all allegations of bribery. Plaintiff\nmaintains that Ms. Blake was not financially dependent on Mr. Cockerham, pursued\njobs in Kuwait of her own volition, and learned of certain jobs in Kuwait without her\nbrother’s input, including sending résumés to companies in Kuwait without her brother’s\naid. Plaintiff cites Mr. Cockerham’s testimony that he did not receive anything of value\nfrom Saud Al Tawash or Gulf Group. Also, according to plaintiff, it was not Mr.\nCockerham’s decision to award the camp package BPA, nor did he make the decision\nto award the camp package BPA call at issue before the court. In fact, Maj. Davis\nawarded all the contracts at issue in this case. Plaintiff also argues that Mr. Cockerham\ncould have tried to stop the camp package termination and to defy the order to him to\nterminate plaintiff’s latrine and dumpster contracts, but did not, indicating that he felt he\nwas under no obligation to plaintiff. Moreover, plaintiff notes that Mr. Cockerham\nawarded some contracts on which plaintiff had submitted bids to other contractors,\nwhich, according to plaintiff and according to Mr. Cockerham’s later convictions, appear\nto have bribed Mr. Cockerham. Plaintiff also argues that Gulf Group had both a factual\nand legal basis for claiming the option periods, and that the expense tables, which the\ngovernment interprets as claiming unincurred costs, were included with the claims only\nto show that Gulf Group was prepared to perform.\n\n        Section 201(b)(1) of Title 18 of the United States Code, “Bribery of Public\nOfficials and Witnesses,” provides:\n\n       (b) Whoever—\n\n              (1) directly or indirectly, corruptly gives, offers or promises\n              anything of value to any public official or person who has\n              been selected to be a public official, or offers or promises\n              any public official or any person who has been selected to\n              be a public official to give anything of value to any other\n              person or entity, with intent--\n\n\n\n                                            105\n\f                       (A) to influence any official act; or\n\n                       (B) to influence such public official or person\n                       who has been selected to be a public official\n                       to commit or aid in committing, or collude in,\n                       or allow, any fraud, or make opportunity for\n                       the commission of any fraud, on the United\n                       States; or\n\n                       (C) to induce such public official or such\n                       person who has been selected to be a public\n                       official to do or omit to do any act in violation\n                       of the lawful duty of such official or person….\n\n         shall be fined under this title or not more than three times the monetary\n         equivalent of the thing of value, whichever is greater, or imprisoned for not\n         more than fifteen years, or both, and may be disqualified from holding any\n         office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 201(b)(1) (emphasis in original).\n\n         The conflict of interest statute, 18 U.S.C. § 208(a), provides:\n\n         Except as permitted by subsection (b) hereof, whoever, being an officer or\n         employee of the executive branch of the United States Government, or of\n         any independent agency of the United States, a Federal Reserve bank\n         director, officer, or employee, or an officer or employee of the District of\n         Columbia, including a special Government employee, participates\n         personally and substantially as a Government officer or employee, through\n         decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, the rendering of advice,\n         investigation, or otherwise, in a judicial or other proceeding, application,\n         request for a ruling or other determination, contract, claim, controversy,\n         charge, accusation, arrest, or other particular matter in which, to his\n         knowledge, he, his spouse, minor child, general partner, organization in\n         which he is serving as officer, director, trustee, general partner or\n         employee, or any person or organization with whom he is negotiating or\n         has any arrangement concerning prospective employment, has a financial\n         interest--\n\n         Shall be subject to the penalties set forth in section 216 of this title.119\n\n\n119\n      18 U.S.C. § 216 provides:\n\n         (a) The punishment for an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 207, 208,\n         or 209 of this title is the following:\n\n\n                                               106\n\f18 U.S.C. § 208(a). The statute at 18 U.S.C. § 208(a) explicitly includes the wrongdoer\nand “his or her spouse and minor child” as members of the family unit, which indicates\nthat the statute does not facially apply to relationships between siblings, such as exists\nbetween Mr. Cockerham and Ms. Blake. See Slattery v. United States, 635 F.3d at\n1324 (“[T]he express mention of one thing excludes all others.”).\n\n      48 C.F.R. § 3.101-1 states:\n\n      Government business shall be conducted in a manner above reproach\n      and, except as authorized by statute or regulation, with complete\n      impartiality and with preferential treatment for none. Transactions relating\n      to the expenditure of public funds require the highest degree of public trust\n      and an impeccable standard of conduct. The general rule is to avoid\n      strictly any conflict of interest or even the appearance of a conflict of\n      interest in Government-contractor relationships. While many Federal laws\n      and regulations place restrictions on the actions of Government personnel,\n      their official conduct must, in addition, be such that they would have no\n      reluctance to make a full public disclosure of their actions.\n\n48 C.F.R. § 3.101-1 (2005). Regarding conflicts of interest generally, there need not\nhave been any actual profit from the conflict of interest; the mere temptation of dishonor\nis enough to prevent the contracting agent from acting in the government’s best\ninterests. See United States v. Miss. Valley Generating Co., 364 U.S. at 549-50.\n\n\n             (1) Whoever engages in the conduct constituting the offense\n             shall be imprisoned for not more than one year or fined in\n             the amount set forth in this title, or both.\n\n             (2) Whoever willfully engages in the conduct constituting the\n             offense shall be imprisoned for not more than five years or\n             fined in the amount set forth in this title, or both.\n\n      (b) The Attorney General may bring a civil action in the appropriate United\n      States district court against any person who engages in conduct\n      constituting an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 207, 208, or 209 of\n      this title and, upon proof of such conduct by a preponderance of the\n      evidence, such person shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than\n      $50,000 for each violation or the amount of compensation which the\n      person received or offered for the prohibited conduct, whichever amount is\n      greater. The imposition of a civil penalty under this subsection does not\n      preclude any other criminal or civil statutory, common law, or\n      administrative remedy, which is available by law to the United States or\n      any other person.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 216 (2000) (emphasis in original).\n\n                                           107\n\f       Although there is disparate testimony in the record as to how and when John\nCockerham met Saud Al Tawash, Saud Al Tawash testified that he first met Mr.\nCockerham in 2002 or 2003 in the “Diwanya” at his house. Mr. Cockerham testified that\nhe believed, however, he was briefly introduced to Saud Al Tawash by a “Mr. Eli or\nElias” during one of his earlier tours of Kuwait at the end of 2002 at a Ramadan “social\ndinner.” John Cockerham testified that he arrived in Kuwait for the tour of duty most\nrelevant to the above-captioned cases on June 30, 2004, and was “acting as a contract\nspecialist for the first few months.” Mr. Cockerham testified he “was a contract\nspecialist until about the end of October, of which [sic] I was promoted to Major and\nthen received a warrant for a very short time until December of ‘04. I was acting as the\nassistant Chief of Contracting during that time from October to December. At that point\nthen my warrant was relinquished and I went back to being an assistant contract\nspecialist until December of ’05.” According to his testimony, he and other Army officers\nwere responsible for soliciting and receiving bids for Department of Defense contracts in\nsupport of Army operations in the Middle East.\n\n        Some of the contacts between John Cockerham and members of the Al Tawash\nfamily were clearly social. Some of the contacts involved Ms. Blake’s employment. Still\nother contacts between Mr. Cockerham and Saud Al Tawash were with regard to the\ncontracts plaintiff had been awarded by the United States government. Mr. Cockerham\nmade a trip to visit Saud Al Tawash and his then-fiancé, now-wife, at their home in the\nUnited States and Mr. Cockerham attended their wedding. Mr. Cockerham stated at\ntrial that he introduced Carolyn Blake to Saud Al Tawash as his sister, and indicated\nthat she was looking for a job in Kuwait.120 Ms. Blake was offered and accepted a job in\nAugust 2004 with Gulf Telecom, a wholly owned subsidiary of Gulf Group, of which\nSaud Al Tawash was the Managing Director. Ms. Blake’s job in Kuwait apparently\ninvolved cold-calling members of the Kuwaiti public from a telephone book to sell water\npurification systems, despite the fact that Ms. Blake did not speak Arabic. According to\nthe joint stipulation of facts submitted by the parties, Ms. Blake did not sell a single\nsystem. While in Kuwait, she also worked for Saud Al Tawash’s uncle at Jireh Springs\nupon the recommendation of Saud Al Tawash. When she arrived in Kuwait to begin her\nemployment, she was met at the airport by Mr. Cockerham, Maj. Davis, Saud Al\nTawash, and Diaa Salem. Saud Al Tawash’s brother, Megbel Al Tawash, helped Ms.\nBlake find an apartment. Her monthly salary of 1,200.000 KD was delivered to her at\nher apartment in cash every month. Saud Al Tawash testified that Ms. Blake was paid\nin cash because she could not obtain a local bank account under the law in Kuwait, and\nthat cash payments were a common practice in Kuwait. In March 2005, Ms. Blake was\nwired $9,478.00 to help her pay taxes on property she owned in the United States.\n\n\n\n120\n    The testimony as to when Saud Al Tawash knew Ms. Blake was Mr. Cockerham’s\nsister, however, is inconsistent. While Mr. Cockerham and Ms. Blake testified that Saud\nAl Tawash knew she was Mr. Cockerham’s sister during her first visit to Kuwait, and Ms.\nBlake testified that her brother knew the Al Tawash family was trying to help her get a\njob, Saud Al Tawash stated that he did not realize that Ms. Blake was Mr. Cockerham’s\nsister until after he had hired her.\n\n                                          108\n\f        Mr. Cockerham is serving a sentence for conviction of conspiracy, bribery, and\nmoney laundering in connection with his participation in bribery schemes while working\nas an Army Major and staff member of the contracts office at Camp Arifjan, and for a\ntime as a contracting officer. Mr. Cockerham testified that he received “close to seven”\nmillion dollars from the contractors on the “appreciation payments” list.121 Ms. Blake is\nserving a sentence for conviction of money laundering, and accepting more than\n$3,000,000.00 on Mr. Cockerham’s behalf. Although Mr. Cockerham listed Ms. Blake\nand her then-minor son, his nephew, as contractor contacts on some bottled water\ncontracts Mr. Cockerham managed, he did not list them on the bottled water BPA\nawarded to and performed by Gulf Group. Likewise, neither Ms. Blake nor her son was\nlisted on the camp package BPA, latrine or dumpster contracts awarded to Gulf Group.\nThe criminal convictions of both Mr. Cockerham and Ms. Blake for bribery are matters of\npublic record. The public record, and the record before this court, however, do not\nindicate that Gulf Group, Saud Al Tawash, or members of his family were involved in the\nbribery schemes that led to Mr. Cockerham’s and Ms. Blake’s convictions. At trial, Saud\nAl Tawash stated that he did not give anything to anyone or hire anyone, including Ms.\nBlake, in exchange for the award of any contract or BPA. Saud Al Tawash consistently\ndenied any intent to defraud the government. Mr. Cockerham also consistently denied\nhaving received or having been offered money, gifts or favors from Gulf Group or Saud\nAl Tawash in exchange for favors or inside information on government contracts.\n\n        For a period of time during the history of the four above-captioned cases, this\ncourt, at the request of the Department of Justice, stayed all four of the cases, pending\nconclusion of Mr. Cockerham’s and Ms. Blake’s criminal proceedings in United States\nDistrict Court for the Western District of Texas. Although both Mr. Cockerham and Ms.\nBlake pled guilty to bribery, conspiracy, and money laundering in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Western District of Texas, the issue before this court is whether\nGulf Group, Saud Al Tawash, or Al Tawash family members engaged in activities which\nwould trigger liability under the Special Plea in Fraud Statute or common law fraud with\nrespect to the relevant BPAs and contracts. Although the court concludes that false\nclaims were submitted to the government for work performed and/or not performed, the\nsubmission of false claims does not establish that plaintiff or any members of the Al\nTawash family were engaged in bribery, conspiracy, money laundering, or that Gulf\nGroup submitted claims with the intent to defraud the government.\n\n      The government suggests the following scenario for consideration:\n\n      At about the same time as the payments to Ms. Blake began, Mr.\n      Cockerham became involved in the process of the Army’s award to Gulf\n      Group of contracts for dumpsters and latrines. He signed a memorandum\n      for record memorializing that the Army would award a latrine contract to\n      Gulf Group, prepared the contract folder for review by the Army’s contract\n      review board, and served as the point of contact for the board’s contract\n121\n   As indicated above, information in the indictments against Mr. Cockerham, Ms.\nBlake, and Mr. Cockerham’s wife suggests that Mr. Cockerham accepted as much as\n$9.6 million in bribes.\n\n                                          109\n\f       award action. Indeed, in September 2004, the Army awarded to Gulf\n       Group Contract No. W912D1-04-P-0932, a firm, fixed-priced contract for\n       the provision and servicing of latrines.\n\n       Mr. Cockerham also signed a memorandum for record stating that Gulf\n       Group “is recommended for award of [a dumpster] contract”; in September\n       2004, the Army awarded to Gulf Group Contract No. W912D1-04-P-0897,\n       a firm, fixed-priced contract for the provision and servicing of dumpsters.\n\n       Later, in December 2004, Mr. Cockerham issued two calls to Gulf Group\n       for bottled water, pursuant to Blanket Purchase Agreement (“BPA”) No.\n       W912D1-04-A-0052, a BPA between the Army and Gulf Group. The Army\n       would pay Gulf Group over 492,000 Kuwaiti dinar (“KD”) (over $1.6\n       million) for that bottled water. In addition, from December 2004 through\n       December 2005, Mr. Cockerham issued several “camp set” calls to Gulf\n       Group, pursuant to BPA No. W912D1-04-A-0047, another BPA between\n       Gulf Group and the Army. The Army would pay Gulf Group over $2.6\n       million for those camp sets.\n\n       While he was working on Gulf Group contracts, Mr. Cockerham\n       understood that Gulf Group was paying Ms. Blake. However, Mr.\n       Cockerham never informed the Army of that understanding. Saud Al\n       Tawash, for his part, never informed Mr. Cockerham’s superiors or\n       colleagues in the contracting office of his arrangement with Mr.\n       Cockerham’s sister.\n\n(internal citations omitted; footnote omitted). Defendant also asserts that “the Army paid\nGulf Group $2,545,273.21 pursuant to camp set calls issued by Mr. Cockerham\npursuant to the camp set BPA,” and that the payments to Ms. Blake “were in exchange\nfor contracting actions favorable to Gulf Group.”\n\n        Saud Al Tawash’s decision to employ Carolyn Blake concurrent with the time\nGulf Group sought, was awarded, and performed on United States government\ncontracts and BPA calls in Kuwait and Iraq, which were awarded by the office in which\nMr. Cockerham worked, require scrutiny. As discussed above, however, the record\nbefore the court does not establish any payments from plaintiff, Saud Al Tawash, any\nother Gulf Group employee, or member of the Al Tawash family to Mr. Cockerham,\nalthough Mr. Cockerham received payments from contractors other than Gulf Group,\nresulting in Mr. Cockerham’s and Ms. Blake’s convictions. Both Mr. Cockerham and\nMs. Blake pled guilty at their criminal proceedings, as a result of which, no transcripts of\ntrials with details of what occurred are available, nor do the plea transcripts offer much\nfactual detail. From the record before this court, it appears that Ms. Blake was hired to\nwork for Gulf Telecom, not Gulf Group. Mr. Cockerham also testified at trial that Ms.\nBlake told him that she had worked out temporary employment with Saud Al Tawash\nand that Gulf Telecom paid her a salary, but that Mr. Cockerham was not aware at the\ntime of Ms. Blake’s employment conditions.\n\n\n                                            110\n\f       The exhibits before this court include a note, which is addressed to no one and\nappears never to have been sent, drafted by Mr. Cockerham after being questioned by\nfederal investigators in 2007. Based on the trial testimony, the note is a stream of\nconsciousness written to himself, similar to other such rambling notes in the record.\nThe note reads:\n\n      1. Carolyn Get Rid of Everything\n      2. Do not talk to them at All\n      3. Make sure no excess money is lying around. Put it all in the bank.\n      4. Make sure no keys are laying around.\n      5. Tell Saud if ask to don’t confess to anything. Tell them they can talk to\n      his lawyer that he never called Fernand Peters [sic] gave me a penny for a\n      contract. We will do business later in trading.\n      6. Tell Carolyn start business in Dubai.\n      7. It’s perfect legal for Carolyn to work for him doing admin paperwork as\n      long as he and I didn’t have an agreement. She never work on nor\n      prepared any contracts or worked in that Department. She got the job on\n      her own.\n\n(emphasis and strike-through in original).\n\nMr. Cockerham testified at trial that he drafted, but never sent, the note to Ms. Blake or\nanyone else. This disjointed note is consistent with other disjointed writings in the\nrecord authored by Mr. Cockerham, also addressed to no one, and consistent with his\nsometimes contradictory and rambling testimony offered at trial. Taken together with\nhis testimony, Mr. Cockerham’s notes appear to be stream-of-consciousness notes to\nhimself. At trial, Mr. Cockerham stated that these notes were “just brainstorming,” and\nthere were “about 70 pages of these notes, just -- I’m just on a mental rampage, just\neverything I can -- that was coming to mind….” For example, another handwritten note\nin the record discussed by Mr. Cockerham at trial, perhaps drafted with Ms. Blake in\nmind, but also never sent, states:\n\n      0.

The instructions state that\n       Ms. Blake “got the job on her own” even though she obtained her situation\n       with Saud Al Tawash only after Mr. Cockerham introduced her to Mr. Al\n       Tawash as his sister and mentioned to him that she was looking for work\n       in Kuwait. The instructions also state that Ms. Blake did “admin\n       paperwork” for Saud Al Tawash, even though Ms. Blake never worked for\n       anyone in Kuwait. The falsity of those statements demonstrates that,\n       contrary to what Mr. Cockerham wrote, he and Saud Al Tawash had an\n       agreement. That agreement was that Gulf Group would give Mr.\n       Cockerham something of value; that is, money to a sister with whom he\n       was close, in exchange for favorable contracting actions toward Gulf\n       Group. Indeed, if Mr. Cockerham did not have such an agreement with\n       Saud Al Tawash, there would have been no need for Mr. Cockerham to\n       write down the instruction that his sister inform Saud Al Tawash of the\n       absence of such an agreement, or that she “get rid of everything.”\n\n(internal citation omitted).\n\n        At trial, Saud Al Tawash and Megbel Al Tawash each adamantly, and\nspecifically, denied involvement in any fraudulent activity, including any involvement in\ntrading favors, money, or jobs for favorable contract treatment. Saud Al Tawash\ntestified at length during the trial. Despite exhibiting poor and overly trusting judgment,\npoor choice of friends and advisors, and failure to conduct careful review of the claims\nsubmitted by plaintiff to the government, Saud Al Tawash’s testimony seemed\nstraightforward and did not appear fallacious to the trial judge. Moreover, Saud Al\nTawash’s testimony stood up during aggressive cross-examination. Although perhaps\nnaïve about how to interact with the Army while seeking and performing government\ncontracts, and how his hospitability would be interpreted, Saud Al Tawash impressed\nthe court during three weeks of trial as credible, sincere, and cooperative, as well as\neager to refute any charges or implications of illicit or anti-American activity, which he\nadamantly denied. There is insufficient evidence in the record to indicate that plaintiff or\nany member of the Al Tawash family paid money in exchange for favors. Saud Al\nTawash also appeared to the court to be an individual who believed he could offer good\nservice to support the war and who was supportive of United States efforts in the region,\nwhile at the same time operating successful businesses.\n\n\n\n\n                                            112\n\f        Saud Al Tawash testified that he hired Ms. Blake because of her English skills.122\nSaud Al Tawash also explained that he hired Ms. Blake because he was looking for an\nAmerican employee to work with Gulf Telecom’s American clients. Saud Al Tawash\ntestified:\n\n      She’s an American. She understands the culture very well of the military.\n      She understands the American culture. She knows the holidays. She’s\n      somebody who has experience with that environment…. She’s American\n      citizen and clients are Americans. She’s ex-military; she has retail\n      experience; she has experience in security as a guard and she has the\n      personality to -- the attitude, for this particular position. She’s educated.\n      She has a degree. She has also a -- quite a good knowledge of the\n      different demographics and segments of the military.\n\n        According to Saud Al Tawash, Ms. Blake was offered the same benefits that\nwere offered to other Americans working for Gulf Telecom. According to Ms. Blake,\nSaud Al Tawash supplied her with materials to set up a small home office in her\napartment, and while Ms. Blake was supposed to work in call centers, a lack of\npaperwork made it impossible for her to do so. In addition, a stand-off with AT & T\nprevented Gulf Telecom from opening several of the call centers that were planned.\nDespite Ms. Blake’s inability to perform the job she was hired to do, and her testimony,\n“I never did work for anyone,” Gulf Telecom continued paying Ms. Blake for the\nremainder of the year, pursuant to the requirements of Kuwaiti labor laws. The\nevidence in the record of the pay and benefits Ms. Blake received may be troubling from\nan American perspective, but alone is not sufficient to establish that plaintiff or Saud Al\nTawash engaged in bribery or attempted to gain influence with Mr. Cockerham through\nMs. Blake’s employment. Rather Kuwaiti labor law obligations and Saud Al Tawash’s\nKuwaiti sense of hospitality to foreigners, which also was testified to during the trial,\nsuggest a difference in culture, but not necessarily criminal, or civilly actionable,\nbehavior on the part of plaintiff or members of the Al Tawash family. Saud Al Tawash\nalso testified that he did not understand that hiring Ms. Blake would be a conflict of\ninterest. Saud Al Tawash stated: “As long as she doesn’t work on contracts that are --\nno, I did not think of it as a conflict of interest because she was not working on any\ncontracts then or after.” The record does not establish that the hiring of Ms. Blake by\nSaud Al Tawash was intended as a bribe or as a way to influence Mr. Cockerham in his\ncapacity as a member of the contract office in Kuwait. Moreover, defendant has not\nprovided the court with any regulation or law which would have required plaintiff to\ninform the Army of the employment of Mr. Cockerham’s sibling, Ms. Blake, by Gulf\nTelecom. The subsequent convictions of Mr. Cockerham and Ms. Blake, without\nestablishing a link to plaintiff Gulf Group, or Saud Al Tawash, also do not support that\nplaintiff or Saud Al Tawash were guilty of any acts of bribery or intent to influence\ngovernment contract activity.\n\n122\n   Mr. Cockerham also testified, regarding Gulf Telecom’s hiring of his sister, “as I\nmentioned earlier, one of the things that, the reason for hiring her was, one, for English\nspeaking liaison.”\n\n                                           113\n\f        Although not the most coherent or credible witnesses at trial, neither Mr.\nCockerham nor Ms. Blake implicated Gulf Group, Saud Al Tawash, or other members of\nthe Al Tawash family in improper or illicit activities of any kind. John Cockerham and\nCarolyn Blake, although convicted of bribery with respect to other contractors, both\naffirmatively and repeatedly denied any involvement by the plaintiff or the Al Tawash\nfamily in any bribery scheme or trading Ms. Blake’s employment for government favors.\nMr. Cockerham’s scribbled, apparently free-association notes that are in the record\nsuggest he had a relationship with Saud Al Tawash. The Al Tawash name, however,\ndoes not appear on the list of individuals identified as having made payments to Mr.\nCockerham, nor does Gulf Group, or Gulf Telecom, appear on the list of corporations\nnamed, which lists “AA,” an abbreviation for Allied Arms, “Jireh,”123 a reference to Jireh\nVentures, “Jas,” a reference to Jasmine International, “Zenith,” a reference to Ghopal\nZenith, “Lee Dynamics,” “Green Valley,”124 “Falah,” a reference to the owner of Trans\nOrient, “FS,” a reference to Future Services, “KMS,” a reference to Kamal Sultan, and\n“Terry,” a reference to Terry Hall from Freedom Catering Company. The exhibits in the\nrecord, including the hand-written notes authored by Mr. Cockerham, do not connect\nplaintiff, Saud Al Tawash, or any member of the Al Tawash family with any illicit contract\nactivity involving Mr. Cockerham or any other public official in the United States Army.\nObserving both Ms. Blake and Mr. Cockerham on the witness stand, when asked about\ntheir relationships with plaintiff and Saud Al Tawash, their repeated denials of fraudulent\nactivity involving plaintiff or members of the Al Tawash family seemed plausible,\nacknowledging, of course, their suspect credibility as convicted felons. Moreover, Mr.\nCockerham was the individual who terminated Gulf Group’s latrine and dumpster\ncontracts within weeks of their having been awarded to plaintiff.\n\n123\n    Mr. Cockerham stated that “Jireh” in his list of bribes referred to Jireh Ventures, not\nJireh Springs, the latter a Kuwaiti company apparently run by Jamal Al Dahma, an uncle\nof Saud Al Tawash. At trial, Mr. Cockerham stated that Jamal Al Dahma was not\ninvolved in Jireh Ventures. Mr. Cockerham also testified that he asked Mr. Cruz to start\na business in San Antonio, Texas, which was called Jireh Ventures, for the purpose of\nproviding supplies to entities in Kuwait from the United States. When he met with Ann\nBrickley and Mark Pletcher of the Department of Justice, Mr. Cockerham told them,\nhowever, that Jireh Ventures was a Kuwaiti company. At trial, Mr. Cockerham stated\nthat “the final report that was actually written up was their [the Department of Justice’s]\nreport. It was not really from the briefings. And so I was basically toward the end told\nwhat I would say.”\n124\n    Mr. Cockerham explained that one of Green Valley’s translators falsely told his\nemployers that he had landed a contract for Green Valley through Mr. Cockerham, and\nthat Green Valley had to pay both Mr. Cockerham and the translator. Mr. Cockerham\ntestified that the money he received from Green Valley, a company with which Gulf\nGroup had a joint venture for a short period of time in 2004, was not from Saud Al\nTawash and that he had received payments from Green Valley in the summer of 2005,\nafter the critical dates at issue in the above-captioned cases in 2004. There is\ninsufficient evidence in the record that, if bribe money came from Green Valley, any\nmoney flowed through, or was in anyway associated with, plaintiff or Saud Al Tawash.\n\n                                           114\n\f       Defendant also asserts that Saud Al Tawash’s reaction when he heard that\nrepresentatives of the federal investigation had contacted Mr. Cockerham and Ms.\nBlake “demonstrate that Saud Al Tawash and Mr. Cockerham were engaged in bribery.”\nDefendant points out that Saud Al Tawash contacted Ms. Blake and asked her what the\ninvestigators wanted, raising Mr. Cockerham by name. This reaction, without more,\nhowever, does not establish that Saud Al Tawash had engaged in acts of bribery and\ndefendant’s allegations to the contrary are merely speculation. Saud Al Tawash’s\nactions just as well could have been generated by curiosity regarding several individuals\nhe knew and considered friends, and with whom he had been in contact in Kuwait.\nSaud Al Tawash and Mr. Cockerham indeed appear to have become social friends.\nAccording to the testimony, Mr. Cockerham developed a number of social friendships\nwith local citizens in Kuwait during his time in Kuwait.\n\n      Moreover, none of the many government witnesses who served in Kuwait with\nMr. Cockerham, civilian or military, including those who worked in the contracting office,\neven intimated that there was an improper relationship based on bribery between Gulf\nGroup or Saud Al Tawash and any employees of the United States. In fact, Gulf Group\nwas not treated with special handling, quite the contrary, with the latrine and dumpster\ncontracts terminated shortly after they were awarded by Mr. Cockerham.\n\n        Significantly, from the record before the court, it is not clear that Mr. Cockerham\nhad sufficient authority to have influenced the award or management of contracts within\nthe structure of the Army contracting office at Camp Arifjan. Although he held a warrant\nfor a short period of time, many contracting decisions seem to have been directed by\nofficials above his pay grade. Maj. Davis awarded each of the contracts and BPAs at\nissue. At the time the contracts were awarded to plaintiff, Mr. Cockerham was not a\ncontracting officer, but rather a contract specialist. Mr. Cockerham testified that he “was\na contract specialist until about the end of October” 2004, after the award of the BPAs\nand contracts at issue in September 2004. Maj. Trimble testified that he did not believe\nthat a contract specialist has the ability to influence the award of a contract, although a\ncontract specialist could make a recommendation. Mr. Cockerham also testified that a\ncontract specialist cannot influence the award of a contract and that the contract\nspecialist merely passed on the recommendation from the Office of the Chief of\nContracting. Col. Hess, the head of contracting at Camp Arifjan, also noted that the\ncontract specialist assembles a package for the Contract Review Board with a\nrecommendation of who should receive the contract. It is clear contract specialists,\nwithout a warrant, cannot sign awards of contracts. See Stout Road Assocs., Inc. v.\nUnited States, 80 Fed. Cl. 754, 756 (2008) (“Only government officials who possess a\nContracting Officer's warrant are authorized to bind the United States to a contract.”\n(citing 48 C.F.R. § 1.602-1)).\n\n       In sum, defendant has not adequately connected the dots between Mr.\nCockerham and Gulf Group or Saud Al Tawash to support defendant’s allegations of\nbribery with an intent to influence the award of government contracts. Regarding the\ncamp package BPA, the award was made by Maj. Davis on September 30, 2004. Mr.\nCockerham was on the Contract Review Board that recommended award of the camp\n\n\n                                           115\n\fpackage BPA to Gulf Group, but defendant has not demonstrated that Mr. Cockerham\nwas bribed by plaintiff or that Mr. Cockerham significantly, or improperly, influenced or\ncaused the award of the BPA to plaintiff. For example, there is no evidence in the\nrecord from others on the Contract Review Board that Mr. Cockerham was particularly\ninsistent that the camp package BPA be awarded to plaintiff. The latrine contract was\nawarded by Maj. Davis on September 28, 2004, and Mr. Cockerham was the contract\nspecialist assigned to the contract. The dumpster contract was awarded by Maj. Davis\non September 20, 2004. Mr. Cockerham served as the contract specialist for the latrine\nand dumpster contracts. With respect to the dumpster contract, oddly, Mr. Cockerham\nsigned the Contract Review Board Memorandum, even though he was not a member of\nthe Contract Review Board that recommended the award of the dumpster contract.\nDefendant, however, has not demonstrated that Mr. Cockerham used his influence to\nunfairly cause awards or other favorable action on the latrine or dumpster contracts to\nGulf Group. Finally, for the bottled water BPA, the award was made by Maj. Davis on\nSeptember 28, 2004, with Mr. Cockerham as the contract specialist. Like the dumpster\ncontract, Mr. Cockerham signed a Contract Review Board Memorandum, but indicated\nthat his duty position was that of a “Contracting Officer” even though he was not a\nmember of the Contract Review Board for the bottled water BPA. Mr. Cockerham,\nhowever, did terminate the latrine and dumpster contracts, shortly after the awards were\nmade, actions obviously unfavorable to plaintiff.\n\n        Although there may have been numerous irregularities in how the Army\nproceeded to award and manage the BPA calls and contracts at Camp Arifjan, including\nincidents of bribery involving Mr. Cockerham with other contractors, defendant has not\ndemonstrated that plaintiff or members of the Al Tawash family were involved in any\nacts of bribery. Ms. Blake was employed by Gulf Telecom at a time when Gulf Group\nwas awarded contracts and while Mr. Cockerham was working in the contracting office.\nThere is no evidence, however, that, but for the hiring of Ms. Blake, Gulf Group, a\ncontractor which had been awarded and held other United States contracts in support of\nthe activities in the Iraq war theatre, independently would not have won the contracts.\nSignificantly, Mr. Cockerham was the Army official who terminated the latrine and\ndumpster contracts, and, as reflected in the October 20, 2004 Memorandum for Record,\npurportedly recommended terminating the camp package BPA call for Camp Buehring.\nThe government has offered no explanation as to why Mr. Cockerham would terminate\nthe latrine and dumpster contracts and recommend terminating the camp package BPA\ncall for Camp Buehring, if he were involved in a scheme to award contracts to plaintiff\nand assist Gulf Group to gain advantages in the contracting process. In fact, the record\nsuggests Mr. Cockerham did not take very good care of his friend, Saud Al Tawash, or\nof Gulf Group.\n\n        Although the defendant has not demonstrated an intent to defraud the\ngovernment under the Special Plea in Fraud statute, an additional question remains as\nto whether Ms. Blake’s employment created a conflict of interest which allows for\nrescission or disgorgement. The court finds that the evidence in the record is\ninsufficient to conclude that Ms. Blake’s employment relationship with Gulf Telecom and\nher relationship to Mr. Cockerham tainted the award of the BPAs and contracts at issue.\n\n\n                                          116\n\fThe court recognizes that Mr. Cockerham violated statutes and regulations with respect\nto contractors other than plaintiff, for which he is currently serving a federal prison\nsentence, but defendant has not presented the court with evidence indicating that Mr.\nCockerham’s potential violations had an impact on the award of the contracts or BPAs\nto plaintiff which are at issue in the above-captioned cases, or that Gulf Telecom’s\nemployment of Ms. Blake created a conflict of interest. Although Mr. Cockerham should\nnot necessarily be considered the most reliable of witnesses, he continued to insist\nthroughout the proceedings before this court that he did not receive any payments from\nor give special favors to Saud Al Tawash or Gulf Group. Mr. Cockerham repeatedly\ninsisted that Saud Al Tawash was a friend.\n\n       That Gulf Telecom was identified as a wholly owned subsidiary of Gulf Group\nthat employed Ms. Blake while Mr. Cockerham was involved in discussions preceding\nthe award of Gulf Group’s contracts and was involved in contract management, certainly\nmight be considered less than wise under American standards. The court notes,\nhowever, that 18 U.S.C § 208 does not appear to apply to conflicts of interest arising out\nof the employment of a government employee’s sibling. In addition, other potentially\napplicable regulations, such as 5 C.F.R. § 2635.502, which prohibits a government\nemployee from participating in a matter that “is likely to have a direct and predictable\neffect on the financial interest of a member of his household, or knows that a person\nwith whom he has a covered relationship is or represents a party to such matter,” do not\nclearly apply to the employment Ms. Blake, Mr. Cockerham’s sister, entered into with\nGulf Telecom. See Letter to a Designated Agency Ethics Official, OGE Informal\nAdvisory Letter 85 X 14, 1985 WL 57313, at *3 (Sept. 23, 1985) (indicating that “no\ncriminal conflict of interest statutes” applied to a government employee’s work on a\nmatter that may have affected the financial interest of his sibling, but recommending that\nthe employee “might wish to recuse himself...because of the degree of appearance of\npotential partiality”). Defendant has not demonstrated that Mr. Cockerham was placed\nin a position that ordinarily would lead a court to assume that his judgment was impaired\nin his official capacity with respect to Gulf Group, when compared to the authorities on\nwhich defendant relies. See, e.g., United States v. Miss. Valley Generating Co., 364\nU.S. at 556 (concluding that a government advisor’s position as an officer who shared in\na company’s profits “at the very least” created an indirect financial interest in a\ngovernment contract when there was a substantial likelihood that a financing agreement\nrelated to the contract would be awarded to the company); K & R Eng’g Co. v. United\nStates, 222 Ct. Cl. at 344, 616 F.2d at 470 (concluding that a government employee’s\nadministration of contracts in which he received a percentage of the profits realized\ncreated a conflict of interest).\n\n        The record before the court does not indicate that Gulf Group’s contracts were\ntainted by an impermissible conflict of interest. Gulf Group appears to have been an\n“innocent contractor” that entered legitimately into a government contract, despite Mr.\nCockerham’s improper and illegal conduct in other regards. See Godley v. United\nStates, 5 F.3d at 1475 (“Illegal acts by a Government contracting agent do not alone\ntaint a contract and invoke the void ab initio rule. Rather, the record must show some\ncausal link between the illegality and the contract provisions.”). Although the decisions\n\n\n                                           117\n\fleading to Ms. Blake’s employment by Saud Al Tawash and Gulf Telecom may have\nbeen naïve by American standards, the record before the court does not establish that\nplaintiff received special treatment from Mr. Cockerham or that Saud Al Tawash’s\nrelationship with Ms. Blake was such that the court can conclude that any impropriety\ntook place, or that Saud Al Tawash or Gulf Group engaged in actions which evidence\nan intent to bribe or defraud the United States.\n\nA.    The Camp Package BPA Claims Under the Special Plea in Fraud Statute\n\n        In its third amended answer to plaintiff’s complaint, defendant alleges that\nplaintiff’s claims must be forfeited under the Special Plea in Fraud statute and that the\ncalls issued under plaintiff’s camp package BPA and, as addressed below, bottled water\nBPA, must be rescinded due to bribery, conflict of interest, and fraud. Defendant\nasserts that Gulf Group artificially inflated its camp package BPA claim, and that,\nwithout a plausible basis for the amount sought, the claim was fraudulent. Defendant\ndid not directly raise claims of rescission and disgorgement for the dumpster or latrine\ncontracts. Defendant contends with respect to the camp package BPA that plaintiff\nsought payment for expenses it had not incurred. According to defendant, Gulf Group\nrepresented in its 2005 claim that it had spent 345,717.000 KD, when it had spent only\n19,323.000 KD. Additionally, defendant insists that the camp package BPA claims were\nfraudulent because, at trial, Saud Al Tawash and Mr. Peters disagreed as to the amount\nof the 2005 claim, and neither admitted devising the settlement offer amount. Finally,\ndefendant states, “Gulf Group fraudulently viewed the pre-2011 version of the camp set\nclaim [sic] an opening gambit in the negotiation of a settlement amount, rather than the\namount to which it was entitled.” (citing Daewoo Eng’g and Constr. Co. v. United\nStates, 73 Fed. Cl. at 596). Defendant, therefore, claims that plaintiff must disgorge the\namounts the government paid to plaintiff under the camp package BPA, and, as\ndiscussed below, the bottled water BPA.\n\n        Defendant argues that Ms. Blake was hired in exchange for Mr. Cockerham\ntaking favorable contracting actions toward plaintiff, which defendant asserts\ndemonstrates both a conflict of interest and bribery. According to defendant, Ms. Blake\nwas hired and began receiving payments shortly before plaintiff was awarded the BPA\ncalls and other contracts, and Ms. Blake never did any work for the payments she\nreceived. The statutes to which defendant points in its counterclaims, violations of\nwhich defendant claims demonstrate fraud, are 18 U.S.C. § 201(b)(1) and 18 U.S.C.\n§ 208(a), both of which are criminal statutes. As noted above, although both Mr.\nCockerham and Ms. Blake have been criminally convicted of conspiracy, bribery, and\nmoney laundering, their convictions were based on transactions involving contractors\nother than plaintiff Gulf Group or members of the Al Tawash family. Defendant argues\nthat “[p]rotection of the integrity of the Federal procurement process from the fraudulent\nactivities of unscrupulous Government contractors and dishonest Government agents\nrequires a refund to the Government of sums already paid to such a contractor pursuant\nto the contract. A contractor must disgorge the amounts received under a contract\ntainted by conflict-of-interest.” (citing K & R Eng’g Co. v. United States, 222 Ct. Cl. at\n354, 616 F.2d at 476). Defendant also claims that payments to Ms. Blake constituted a\n\n\n                                           118\n\fviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 201(b)(1), and that these payments also created a common law\nconflict of interest. Plaintiff responds that the government has not cited to any legal\nbasis for its rescission and disgorgement claims, and that the federal Conflict of Interest\nstatute, 18 U.S.C. § 208(a), is not applicable.\n\n        The court finds it difficult to understand how plaintiff’s two attorneys, Attorney\nPeters and Attorney Hands, could have thought Gulf Group was entitled to the master\nBPA limit of the camp package BPA or the limit of camp package BPA call 0001 when\ncall 0001 was worth only $1,447,457.22, despite testimony from Attorney Peters that he\nbelieved the claim was correct at the time it was submitted. Although the attorneys\nwere legally incorrect and reckless in preparing the claims, and Saud Al Tawash failed\nto properly review the claims, which resulted in a violation of the False Claims Act, the\ncourt concludes that plaintiff and Saud Al Tawash do not appear to have had the\nspecific intent necessary to prove fraud under the Special Plea in Fraud statute. See\nDaewoo Eng’g & Constr. Co. v. United States, 73 Fed. Cl. at 584 (noting that, under the\nSpecial Plea in Fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 2514, “[m]ere negligence is not sufficient”);\nsee also Miller v. United States, 213 Ct. Cl. at 69, 550 F.2d at 22 (“[F]raud, resulting in\nforfeiture, can be found only on the basis of clear and convincing evidence. An intent to\ndeceive the Government must be proved.”) (citations omitted). Saud Al Tawash should\nnot have blindly trusted his advisors before signing the documents, but the record\nbefore the court does not demonstrate that there were intentional, corrupt, or fraudulent\npractices engaged in by plaintiff or Saud Al Tawash during the course of the award or\nperformance under the camp package BPA.\n\n        In addition, as discussed above, defendant has not convinced the court that there\nis sufficient evidence in the record of a conflict of interest or bribery linked to the award\nor management of the camp package BPA or of an intent to defraud, warranting\nrescission or disgorgement. The record contains no evidence that Gulf Group had the\nintent to deceive the government in obtaining its camp package BPA or camp package\nBPA calls. Defendant offered, as part of its evidence, that plaintiff failed to inform the\nArmy of Gulf Telecom’s hiring of Ms. Blake. As noted above, however, defendant has\ncited no regulation or law which would have required plaintiff to inform the Army of Ms.\nBlake’s employment by Gulf Telecom and the record does not establish that the\nrelationship between Saud Al Tawash and Ms. Blake was such that the court must\nassume an impropriety had taken place. Moreover, Mr. Cockerham’s other illegal\nactivities have not been linked to a taint in Gulf Group’s contracts. Defendant,\ntherefore, has failed to demonstrate entitlement to forfeiture under the Special Plea in\nFraud or rescission and disgorgement under common law fraud with regard to the camp\npackage BPA.\n\nB.     The Latrine and Dumpster Claims Under the Special Plea in Fraud Statute\n\n     With respect to the Special Plea in Fraud statute, defendant makes identical\narguments with regard to forfeiture of plaintiff’s claims under both the latrine and\ndumpster contracts. In its filing, plaintiff also combines its responses to the latrine and\ndumpster contract counterclaims. The court, therefore, addresses the Special Plea in\n\n\n                                            119\n\fFraud issues raised by these two contracts together.125 Defendant provides the same\narguments as it does with regard to the camp package BPA, including that plaintiff\nviolated the Special Plea in Fraud statute by bribing Mr. Cockerham under 18 U.S.C.\n§ 201(b)(1), which also created a conflict of interest, and by submitting claims for\namounts to which it knew it was not entitled. According to defendant, Saud Al Tawash\nand Mr. Cockerham entered into an arrangement whereby Ms. Blake would be\nemployed and Mr. Cockerham would award contracts to Gulf Group. Defendant alleges\nby way of example for the dumpster contract:\n\n      Mr. Cockerham’s sister began receiving monthly payments from Gulf\n      Group’s operations manager, at the behest of Gulf Group’s general\n      manager, both of whom were directors of Gulf Group. Mr. Cockerham\n      was aware of those payments, and understood them to be from Gulf\n      Group. In September 2004, Mr. Cockerham signed a memorandum for\n      record stating that Gulf Group “is recommended for award of [a dumpster]\n      contract.” The Army awarded the dumpster contract, Contract No.\n      W912D1-04-P-0897, to Gulf Group in September 2004. The dumpster\n      contract was not terminated until October 22, 2004. Both Gulf Group and\n      Mr. Cockerham understood the nature of the arrangement.\n\n        As described above, defendant alleges that neither Mr. Cockerham nor Saud Al\nTawash told the Army about Ms. Blake’s employment, that Saud Al Tawash questioned\nMs. Blake about her meeting with the federal investigators, and that Mr. Cockerham\nwrote a note indicating that Saud Al Tawash should not “confess to anything.”\nDefendant further alleges that plaintiff submitted inflated claims to the government that\nwere unsupported and fraudulent. Finally, defendant contends that the inflated amounts\nclaimed were merely a negotiating ploy, as indicated by Mr. Peters’ testimony, and that\nplaintiff submitted the claims to Mr. Cockerham with reason to believe he would act\nfavorably on them.\n\n        Plaintiff responds using many of the same arguments that it asserted with regard\nto the False Claims Act, including that it had a legal basis for claiming lost profits on\nunexercised option years and that the Army indicated to plaintiff there was a reasonable\nlikelihood the options would be exercised. Plaintiff further argues that the expense\ntables submitted were not part of the latrine and dumpster claims, but “were included\nsimply to demonstrate that Gulf Group was prepared to perform under the contract if it\nhad been given a fair opportunity to do so.” Plaintiff also denies that the claim amounts\nsought were a negotiating ploy. As to defendant’s bribery and conflict of interest\nallegations, plaintiff contends that Mr. Cockerham had no authority to make the award of\nthe contracts, and that Saud Al Tawash asked Ms. Blake about her meeting with the\nfederal investigators as “a conscientious individual who takes very seriously any federal\ninvestigation involving someone with whom he had been involved.” Plaintiff further\nurges that Mr. Cockerham’s hand-written notes do not prove that Gulf Group or Saud Al\nTawash were involved in bribing Mr. Cockerham. Finally, plaintiff points out that,\n125\n    As noted above, defendant did not directly raise claims of rescission and\ndisgorgement for the latrine contract and dumpster contract.\n\n                                          120\n\fconsidering all the contractors Ms. Blake and Mr. Cockerham listed and admitted had\nbribed them, neither Ms. Blake nor Mr. Cockerham ever implicated plaintiff or any\nmembers of the Al Tawash family.\n\n       The government must prove by clear and convincing evidence that plaintiff\nintended to defraud the government for the court to conclude that forfeiture is warranted\nunder the Special Plea in Fraud statute. See Daewoo Eng’g & Constr. Co. v. United\nStates, 557 F.3d at 1341. As discussed above in the discussion of the False Claims\nand Contract Disputes Acts, the evidence offered as to Jireh Springs and Green Valley\ndoes not conclusively implicate Gulf Group, Saud Al Tawash, or any other member of\nthe Al Tawash family. Regarding defendant’s allegations of fraudulent false claims with\nrespect to the latrine and dumpster contracts, despite the fact that much of plaintiff’s\nreasoning with regard to the availability of lost profits was erroneous for option years\nand unissued calls, the court finds Saud Al Tawash to have been a sincere and credible\nwitness. Saud Al Tawash testified that Maj. Davis told him that Camp Arifjan would be\npermanent, and that if Gulf Group performed well it would have the dumpster and latrine\ncontracts for the full term, including all option periods. Saud Al Tawash also explained\nthat he expected to perform the option periods of the latrine contract, for example\nbecause the price of the base period alone would not cover the capital expenditures\nnecessary to perform the latrine contract.126 Saud Al Tawash’s testimony is, in part,\ncorroborated by an Army memorandum of August 20, 2004, signed by Maj. Davis,\nwhich states that the Army anticipated needing the option periods of the dumpster\ncontract and that there was a likelihood that the options would be exercised. The\ndetermination of the memorandum concluded: “Based on the above information, in\naccordance with FAR 17.202, I hereby determine that the Dumpster Service Contract\ndoes require the use of options.”127 Moreover, following the terminations of the latrine\nand dumpster contracts, the necessary services were carried on by other contractors,\nincluding Green Valley and Jasmine, respectively, indicating that defendant was still in\nneed of, and had the ability to pay for, the latrine and dumpster services. Additionally,\nboth Attorney Peters and Mr. Carlson, plaintiff’s expert, stated that they believed the\noption periods were recoverable.\n\n        Defendant’s arguments implicating the Special Plea in Fraud violations regarding\nthe latrine and dumpster claims are substantially the same as the arguments it made on\nthe same issue with regard to the camp package BPA claim. With respect to all three\nclaims, the camp package BPA, the latrine contract, and the dumpster contract, the\ncourt finds that defendant has failed to prove with clear and convincing evidence that\nplaintiff presented a false claim with the intent to defraud the government, or that the\ndumpster or latrine contracts, as a whole, were tainted by bribery or a conflict of\ninterest. Moreover, the fact is that Mr. Cockerham terminated both the latrine and\n126\n    Plaintiff’s lost profits calculation indicates that plaintiff’s costs would have exceeded\nits profits for the base period of the dumpster contract, rather than the latrine contract.\n127\n   FAR 17.202 indicates when a contracting officer “may include options” in a contract,\nbut does not indicate that the government must exercise an option. See 48 C.F.R.\n§ 17.202 (2005).\n\n                                            121\n\fdumpster contracts shortly after they were awarded to plaintiff. If the award of contracts\nwas the result of bribery, conflict of interest, and fraud involving Mr. Cockerham, it gives\nthe court pause that Mr. Cockerham also was the official who terminated the same\ncontracts. Because defendant has failed to prove an intent to defraud the government\nwith respect to its latrine and dumpster claims, forfeiture of plaintiff’s claims is\ninappropriate.\n\nC.     The Bottled Water BPA Demurrage Claim Under the Special Plea in Fraud\n       Statute\n\n        With respect to the bottled water BPA, defendant asserts that plaintiff’s claims\nshould be forfeited under the Special Plea in Fraud statute as a result of plaintiff’s\nbribery of Mr. Cockerham in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 201(b)(1), which also created a\nconflict of interest, and because plaintiff submitted the 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer\nfor amounts to which it knew it was not entitled. Defendant also alleges that calls\nissued under plaintiff’s bottled water BPA must be rescinded due to bribery, conflict of\ninterest, and fraud. In its post-trial brief, defendant claims that plaintiff’s 2005 bottled\nwater BPA demurrage claim indicates it was seeking excess payment for charges made\nby Expeditors, Gulf Group’s trucking company, because the claim provided that Gulf\nGroup was “submitting this claim with the following documents for reimbursement of our\ndemurrage payments.” (emphasis added). Yet, defendant contends that Expeditors did\nnot charge the 85.000 KD/day as requested in the claim; rather, Expeditors charged\n50.000 to 60.000 KD/day. Defendant asserts that by claiming more than Expeditors\ncharged, plaintiff intended to deceive the government. Additionally, defendant argues\nthat plaintiff fraudulently assigned all of the delays encountered to the government.\n\n       Defendant provided the same rationale regarding the bottled water BPA as it did\nfor the camp package BPA regarding its request for rescission and disgorgement. By\nway of example, defendant claims that Ms. Blake was paid, but never worked, that the\npayments were made to her in exchange for the award of contracts to plaintiff by Mr.\nCockerham, and that Saud Al Tawash asked Ms. Blake about her conversation with\nfederal investigators. Defendant also relies on Mr. Cockerham’s note in the record,\nalbeit apparently undelivered, referring to “Saud” and instructing Ms. Blake to get rid of\neverything. Defendant believes that the note contained falsehoods (i.e., that Ms. Blake\ngot her job on her own and Ms. Blake did paperwork for Saud Al Tawash). Defendant\nclaims the following with respect to the note:\n\n       the instructions contain falsehoods that demonstrate that Mr. Cockerham\n       and Saud Al Tawash were engaged in bribery. The instructions state that\n       Ms. Blake ‘got the job on her own’ even though she obtained her situation\n       with Saud Al Tawash only after Mr. Cockerham introduced her to Mr. Al\n       Tawash as his sister and mentioned to him that she was looking for work\n       in Kuwait. The instructions also state that Ms. Blake did “admin\n       paperwork” for Saud Al Tawash, even though Ms. Blake never worked for\n       anyone in Kuwait.\n\n\n\n                                            122\n\f(internal citations omitted). Finally, defendant notes that neither Mr. Cockerham nor\nSaud Al Tawash told the Army about Ms. Blake’s job with Gulf Telecom, but defendant\nhas not identified a statute or regulation requiring Mr. Cockerham to do so. Defendant\nasserts that the calls issued under plaintiff’s bottled water BPA must be rescinded due\nto bribery, conflict of interest, and fraud. Defendant also claims that plaintiff must\ndisgorge the amounts the government paid to plaintiff under the bottled water BPA\nclaims.\n\n       Plaintiff argues that Mr. Cockerham and Saud Al Tawash testified that Mr.\nCockerham did not help Saud Al Tawash obtain the bottled water BPA and that Saud Al\nTawash did not offer him anything in exchange for or to prompt the award of the bottled\nwater BPA. According to plaintiff, Gulf Telecom had a legitimate need for Ms. Blake’s\nservices and had been seeking an American employee before discovering that Ms.\nBlake was inquiring about work in Kuwait. Plaintiff argues that Ms. Blake sought a job in\nKuwait independent of her brother’s influence, that she was unable to work in the end\ndue to issues beyond her control, that Gulf Telecom was required to pay her regardless\nof her failure to provide actual services pursuant to Kuwaiti law, and that her salary and\nbenefits were commensurate with other local companies. Plaintiff also notes that the\namount of Gulf Group’s bottled water BPA claim has remained consistent since the\n2005 claim. Plaintiff points to a chart in the record evidencing the expenses included in\nthe bottled water claim. Furthermore, Saud Al Tawash testified that the 85.000 KD/day\namount included expenses in addition to those charged by Expeditors.\n\n       The court does not find clear and convincing evidence of fraudulent claims or\nbribery under the bottled water BPA and, therefore, defendant has failed to prove its\nSpecial Plea in Fraud counterclaim or that the calls issued under the bottled water BPA\nshould be rescinded. The government has not proven that plaintiff knowingly submitted\nthe bottled water BPA claim with the intent to defraud the government or that plaintiff’s\nbottled water BPA was tainted by bribery. Unlike the camp package BPA, latrine, and\ndumpster claims, defendant did not prove a violation of the False Claims Act with\nrespect to the bottled water BPA claim, which has a lower threshold of proof and intent\nthan the Special Plea in Fraud statute. The amount plaintiff seeks in connection with\nthe bottled water BPA claim has remained consistent from when the claim was first\nsubmitted. Gulf Group initially attempted to document the expenses incurred, although,\nin addition to the information plaintiff included with its bottled water BPA claim, plaintiff\nalso should have included information which demonstrated expenses charged other\nthan by Expeditors. The failure to include such information, which was produced later,\ndoes not evidence fraud. At most, the failure to attach the documentation for expenses\nother than for Expeditors demonstrates negligence and ineptitude, which do not\nimplicate forfeiture under the Special Plea in Fraud statute. See Miller v. United States,\n213 Ct. Cl. at 69, 550 F.2d at 22; Daewoo Eng’g & Constr. Co. v. United States, 73 Fed.\nCl. at 584. Despite defendant’s argument that plaintiff’s claim implies that it is seeking\nonly reimbursement for charges made by Expeditors, nowhere in the claim does plaintiff\nactually make such a statement. Rather, the bottled water BPA demurrage claim states\nthat it is for “demurrage charges for delays,” and that Gulf Group “incurred delay\n(demurrage) and damages.” The language of the 2005 bottled water BPA demurrage\n\n\n                                            123\n\fclaim can be read to encompass all damages arising from delays, including charges\nasserted by entities other than Expeditors. The bottled water BPA claim states, “in\nfurtherance of the contract we shipped the bottled water to Iraq. But we have incurred\ndelay (demurrage) and damages for delivering bottled water to Iraq. Even though we\nhave had [sic] taken all the necessary requirements to perform its obligations both\nanticipated and ultimate as per the scope of work and were doing the services.” The\nbottled water BPA claim continues: “Gulf Group followed Arcent requirements for\nshipment which resulted in delays (by the US military) that resulted in extra costs to Gulf\nEnterprises, and such delays resulted in the demurrage charges as provided in a\nsummary table and detailed line item listing at Appendix 3.” Although the only expense\ndocuments originally included in the claim were from Expeditors and Gulf Group, the\ncourt does not conclude from its statement that the claim was for “demurrage damages\nfor delay” that plaintiff only sought reimbursement for charges made by Expeditors.\n\n       Also, as discussed above, defendant has not demonstrated a conflict of interest\ninvolving Mr. Cockerham, with regard to Gulf Group or any member of the Al Tawash\nfamily or that the relationship between Saud Al Tawash and Ms. Blake was such that\nthe court must assume that there was an impropriety which took place related to the\ncontract at issue. Defendant also has not proven that the hiring of, and payments to,\nMs. Blake were linked to contract awards to plaintiff or favorable contracting actions by\nMr. Cockerham. Based on the record before the court, the defendant has not met its\nburden to prove a violation of the Special Plea in Fraud provisions regarding the bottled\nwater BPA by clear and convincing evidence, by showing that plaintiff knowingly\npresented a false claim with the intent to defraud the government, or that the bottled\nwater BPA was tainted by bribery. Defendant also has not demonstrated the existence\nof a conflict of interest or proven its counterclaim for common law fraud, including\nrescission and disgorgement.\n\n       In sum, the defendant has failed to prove that forfeiture is warranted under the\nSpecial Plea in Fraud statute or that the commission of common law fraud related to\nany of the four above-captioned cases warrants rescission and disgorgement. A finding\nof False Claims Act liability without a finding of Special Plea in Fraud is not logically\ninconsistent.128 As a Judge of the Court of Federal Claims has noted, “the\n128\n   The court in Liquidating Trustee Ester DuVal of KI Liquidation, Inc. v. United States,\nnoted that:\n\n       The evidence that would negate the level of intent under the FCA, as\n      opposed to the forfeiture statute, involves different findings of fact. The\n      application of these facts should not be conflated, as the legal\n      requirements of the statutes differ significantly: first, § 2514 requires an\n      elevated burden of proof, i.e., clear and convincing evidence, Daewoo\n      Eng’g, 557 F.3d at 1341, not a preponderance of the evidence standard\n      as required by the FCA, see id. at 1340; second, § 2514 requires proof of\n      the intent to deceive, whereas the FCA requires knowledge, a general-\n      intent standard, and explicitly stipulates that proof of specific intent is not\n      required.\n\n                                           124\n\fconsequences of each—forfeiture of plaintiff’s entire claim versus comparatively\nminimal penalties under the FCA—exemplify the perceived gravitas of the fraud under\neach statute.” Liquidating Trustee Ester DuVal of KI Liquidation, Inc. v. United States,\n89 Fed. Cl. at 41-42. Although plaintiff was found to have violated the False Claims Act\nfor the camp package BPA claims, latrine claims, and dumpster claims, defendant has\nfailed to demonstrate liability under the Contract Disputes Act or that forfeiture is\nwarranted under the Special Plea in Fraud statute in all four cases, and has failed to\nprove the common law fraud counterclaim for rescission and disgorgement for the camp\npackage and bottled water BPAs. The court, therefore, turns to plaintiff’s claims.\n\nIII.   Contract Terminations and Abuse of Discretion\n\n       Plaintiff’s camp package BPA call, latrine contract, and dumpster contract each\nwere terminated by the government for convenience in October 2004.129 Plaintiff claims\nthat the government decisions to terminate its camp package BPA call and latrine and\ndumpster contracts were abuses of discretion.130 Plaintiff asserts that the terminations\nfor convenience by the government were not properly based on convenience131\n\n\nLiquidating Trustee Ester DuVal of KI Liquidation, Inc. v. United States, 89 Fed. Cl. 29,\n41-42 (2009)\n129\n   None of the calls issued under Gulf Group’s bottled water BPA were cancelled in\nOctober 2004. Gulf Group continued to supply bottled water to the Army in 2005.\n130\n   As noted above, plaintiff had alleged bad faith on the part of the government in the\nterminations of the camp package BPA call and the dumpster and latrine contracts.\nPlaintiff subsequently dropped all allegations concerning bad faith in each case, and\nconfirmed at closing arguments, “there is no bad faith claim in any one of these four\ncases, 06-835, 06-858, 06-853, and 07-082.”\n131\n   The standard termination for convenience clause, 38 C.F.R. § 52.212-4 (2003), was\nincorporated by reference into plaintiff’s contracts. The clause states:\n\n       Termination for the Government’s convenience.              The Government\n       reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole\n       convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall\n       immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and\n       all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms\n       of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid a percentage of the contract\n       price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of\n       termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to\n       the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping\n       system, have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be\n       required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost\n       principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government\n       any right to audit the Contractor’s records. The Contractor shall not be\n\n                                            125\n\fbecause the government continued to require the camp package, latrine, and dumpster\nservices, and contracted with other contractors to provide the same services after\nterminating plaintiff. According to plaintiff, the terminations could not have been\nproperly based on default because plaintiff had not committed any error justifying\ndefault terminations under the camp package BPA or the latrine and dumpster\ncontracts.\n\n       Defendant argues that the camp package BPA call for Camp Buehring was\nterminated for convenience in order to award a call for a larger camp, Camp Virginia, to\nGulf Group because the Army had determined that Gulf Group was better suited to the\nlarger camp. Although plaintiff’s 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer references the\nplanned award of a call for Camp Virginia and there is evidence in the record that\ninformal discussions about offering a call for Camp Virginia to plaintiff had occurred, the\nCamp Virginia call never was awarded to plaintiff. As for the latrine and dumpster\ncontracts, defendant argues the contracts were terminated for convenience in response\nto security concerns arising from the alleged security incident involving Mohammed Al\nTawash when he sought to map the dumpster locations in order to initiate contract\nperformance. Defendant concedes that the security concerns later were determined to\nbe unfounded, but maintains that the concerns were legitimate at the time of the\nterminations.\n\n       The camp package BPA call for Camp Buehring was awarded on September 30,\n2004 by Maj. Davis, but was terminated twelve days later on October 12, 2004, when\nMaj. Davis issued Modification 103 on behalf of the Army. The Modification stated: “The\npurpose of this modification is to cancel the BPA Call with Gulf Group. Gulf Group has\nno issues with this cancellation and will accept it at no cost to the government.”\nDespite terminating the camp package BPA call, the government had sufficient funds to\npay for, continued to be in need of, and contracted for the camp package services. The\ncontracting officer’s May 21, 2007 final decision on the camp package BPA claim,\nsigned by Joseph Libbey,132 stated:\n\n      paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could\n      have been avoided.\n\n38 C.F.R. § 52.212-4.\n132\n   Mr. Libbey was not an ideal witness for the government. He often was defensive\nand struggled to explain his final decisions, which were confusing and unsupported. At\none point during trial, he stated:\n\n      I am not buying that there is a conspiracy to wrongfully have terminated\n      Gulf Group. Makes no sense to me. You’ve certainly pointed out some\n      factual errors in the letter, you’re a full time professional attorney, you\n      know, you’ve done that, you certainly have made me look a fool on some\n      things today. But nonetheless, no, under the context these letters were\n      written under, you know, I stand by them. There are some factual errors\n      that the Judge will have to take in. This idea about a conspiracy in terms\n\n                                           126\n\f      Gulf Group erroneously treats the BPA W912D1-04-A-0047 as a contract.\n      They demand the maximum ordering limit for a BPA call as termination\n      costs. They also fail to reduce the maximum call order amount demanded\n      by any of the orders placed against the BPA and for which they received\n      payment. Gulf Group alleges the contract/BPA was terminated, yet only\n      one call was in fact terminated, not the entire BPA as alleged.\n\n        The latrine contract was awarded on September 28, 2004 by Maj. Davis, but was\nterminated pursuant to 48 C.F.R. § 52.212-4 twenty days later on October 18, 2004,\nwhen Mr. Cockerham issued Modification P00002 on behalf of the Army. Modification\nP00002 stated: “This contract is being canceled due to command directive of the ASG\ncommander SWA COL Brick Miller 3rd Army Arcent Kuwait. The contract is canceled\nunder the terms of 52.212-1, 52-212-4 [sic], 52.249-4.” The parties stipulated that: “The\nGovernment did not terminate Gulf Group for default under Contract W912D1-04-P-\n0932,” and, “[a]t the time Contract W912D1-04-P-0932 was terminated, the Government\nhad not issued any Cure Notices to Gulf Group regarding Gulf Group’s performance of\nits contractual obligations under that contract, and none was ever issued at any time\nthereafter.” Despite terminating Gulf Group’s latrine contract, the government had\nsufficient funds to pay for, continued to be in need of, and continued to contract for the\nlatrine services.\n\n      Sixteen days after the October 18, 2004 termination of the latrine contract, Col.\nHess, the head of contracting at Camp Arifjan, sent a letter to Mohammed Al Tawash.\nThe November 3, 2004 letter stated:\n\n      Recently, a contracting officer in my office terminated a service contract\n      [the latrine contract] held by Gulf Group General Enterprises, a company\n      operated by the Al-Tawash family. There has been some concern\n      expressed that the incident unfairly tarnished the good name of the Al-\n      Tawash family, which is a highly respected, prominent Kuwaiti family.\n\n      Please rest assured that the Gulf Group’s contract to service portable\n      latrines at Army camps in Kuwait was not terminated because of security\n      reasons. While it is true that some employees of the Gulf Group have\n      been either barred from the installation or warned because they had not\n      followed the rules for contract employees on the installation, these\n      incidents did not cause the termination of the contract.\n\n      The contracting officer terminated the contract because circumstances\n      arose that caused the contracting officer to conclude that it was in the best\n      interest of the Army to terminate the contract. Since the contract was\n      terminated for convenience of the government, the Gulf Group should not\n\n\n      of the wrongful termination and all that, I’m going to have leave that in the\n      Judge’s hands. All I can offer is I don’t believe it.\n\n                                           127\n\f       suffer any repercussions to its reputation or competitive standing. The\n       Gulf Group is fully eligible to compete for other Army contracts in Kuwait.\n       I hope this clarifies this unfortunate misunderstanding.\n\n       On May 21, 2007, Joseph Libbey issued his contracting officer’s final decision on\nthe latrine contract claim, which stated that “the performance failures and security\nfactors prompting the termination to show the decision that termination was in the best\ninterests of the Government was a valid decision and not an abuse of discretion and not\ndone in bad faith.” The same decision noted, however, “[o]n 3 November 2004, LTC\nHess sent a letter to Mohammed Abdulaziz Al Tawash responding to the apparent Gulf\nGroup inquiry as to whether or not the security violations had prompted the termination\n[of the latrine contract]. LTC Hess stated the latrine contract services were not\nterminated because of security concerns.” At trial, Col. Hess testified that he directly\nordered Mr. Cockerham to terminate Gulf Group’s latrine and dumpster contracts, and\nordered Maj. Davis to terminate Gulf Group’s camp package BPA call, likely at the\nbehest of Col. Miller, because “[w]e were ordered to get Gulf Group off the bases, the\ncamps.” At trial, Col. Miller testified that the terminations were not related to the alleged\nsecurity incident. Col. Miller also testified that, due to a separation in command, he\ncould not give Col. Hess orders relating to contracting and that, due to the nature of his\nposition, had he ordered a contracting officer to terminate a contract, he would have\nbeen issuing an “illegal command.”\n\n       The dumpster contract, which was awarded on September 20, 2004 by Maj.\nDavis, was terminated thirty-two days later on October 22, 2004, when Mr. Cockerham\nexecuted Modification P00005 on behalf of the Army, terminating the dumpster contract\nfor the convenience of the government. Despite what Col. Miller testified, Modification\n0005 stated: “Contract is cancelled by order of the ASG Commander Kuwait COL Brick\nMiller. Contract was canceled in accordance with FAR Part 52.212-4 Termination for\nConvenience of the Government.”\n\n       The parties stipulated that: “The Government did not terminate Gulf Group for\ndefault under Contract W912D1-04-P-0897,” the dumpster contract, and “[a]t the time\nContract W912D1-04-P-0897 was terminated, the Government had not issued any Cure\nNotices to Gulf Group regarding Gulf Group’s performance of its contractual obligations\nunder that contract, and none was ever issued at any time thereafter.” Despite the\ntermination of Gulf Group’s dumpster contract, the government had sufficient funds to\npay for, continued to be in need of, and contracted for the dumpster services. In fact,\nafter terminating plaintiff’s latrine contract and dumpster contract, the government\ncontinued to place orders for dumpsters from Gulf Group for other locations.\n\n      Joseph Libbey’s May 21, 2007 contracting officer’s decision on the dumpster\ncontract claim stated:\n\n       On 7 October 2004, four Gulf Group employees were being escorted\n       when one began asking suspicious questions about base personnel\n       housing and base security arrangements. The four were detained and\n\n\n                                            128\n\f         released to the Kuwait Ministry of Interior. On 21 October 2004, the\n         individual asking about base security was barred from Camp Arifjan by\n         Col. Brick T. Miller, ASG Commander.133 The remaining individuals were\n         issued letters of warning regarding compliance with base security.\n\n         Mr. Libbey’s contracting officer’s decision on the dumpster claim continued:\n\n         On 18 October 2004, another Gulf Group employee was barred from\n         Camp Arifjan by Colonel Miller for traveling on base without his required\n         escort. Colonel Miller wrote to Mr. [Saud] Al Tawash of Gulf Group on 21\n         October 2004 expressing deep concern over Gulf Group and its\n         employees not following and enforcing security regulations. Colonel Miller\n         warned Mr. [Saud Al] Tawash that further violations might result in Mr.\n         Tawash and Gulf Group being barred from all ASG Kuwait installations.\n\nMr. Libbey’s contracting officer’s decision on the dumpster contract claim further stated:\n“On 9 October 2004, six Gulf Group employees were detained for security violations\ninvolving traveling on Camp Arifjan without their required escort, and rummaging\nthrough a dumpster. At least four of these individuals were barred from Camp Arifjan by\nColonel Miller on 16 and 18 October 2004.”134\n\n         The contracting officer’s decision on the dumpster contract claim also stated:\n\n         The Government originally contemplated terminating Gulf Group’s contract\n         for failure to comply with security regulations; however, due to the global\n         war on terror operational tempo in this area, and a desire to maintain a\n         friendly working relationship with local contractors that often include\n         prominent Kuwaiti families, the Government decided to terminate the\n         contract for the convenience of the Government. The Government is not\n         attempting to change the basis for contract termination; but simply notes\n         that because of repeated security violations it was in the best interest of\n         the Government and not an abuse of discretion or bad faith to terminate\n         the [dumpster] contract for convenience.\n\n     An unsigned letter, purportedly written by Col. Miller on October 29, 2004 to\nMohammed Al Tawash, appears to contradict Mr. Libbey’s retrospective explanation:\n\n         Dear Mr. Al-Tawash:\n\n         Recently I directed that a contract between the United States Army and\n         Gulf Group General Enterprises be terminated for the convenience of the\n         United States Government. Based upon the terms of the contract and\n133\n      This statement in not accurate, as the individuals were not barred from Camp Arifjan.\n134\n   As noted above, Mr. Libbey, the contracting officer, incorrectly identified Gulf\nCompany employees as Gulf Group employees.\n\n                                             129\n\f       lack of sufficient equipment and personnel for Gulf Group to perform the\n       services, I directed the termination of the contract. My concern for the\n       health of my Soldiers caused me to conclude that it was in the best\n       interest of the Army to terminate the contract. Because I terminated the\n       contract for the convenience of the Army, there are no repercussions upon\n       the Gulf Group for failing to perform under the contract. Gulf Group is not\n       barred from competing for other Army contracts and is fully eligible to\n       compete for other Army contracts in Kuwait. I apologize for any\n       misunderstanding and the Army looks forward to Gulf Group competing for\n       future contracts.\n\n       Respectfully,\n\n       Brick T. Miller\n       Colonel, U.S. Army\n       Commanding\n\nIt is unclear, however, as to which contract Col. Miller’s letter refers. The reference to\nlack of sufficient equipment and concern for the health of his soldiers could refer to any\nof the contracts. Moreover, the letter in the record is unsigned. Upon being shown the\nletter quoted immediately above at trial, Col. Hess, the head of contracting at Camp\nArifjan, stated, “I don’t recall seeing this letter before.”\n\n       As noted by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, agency\npersonnel are presumed to act in good faith, and a claimant must present significant\nproof of bad faith to overcome that presumption. See T & M Distribs., Inc. v. United\nStates, 185 F.3d 1279, 1285 (Fed. Cir. 1999); see also Sickels v. Shinseki, 643 F.3d\n1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir.)

In\naddition, because of the broad discretion vested in the contracting officer, plaintiff has a\nhigh burden of proof to show that a determination was an abuse of discretion.

See T & M Distribs., Inc. v.\n\n\n                                            130\n\f       United States, 185 F.3d 1279, 1283 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (“In the absence of\n       bad faith or clear abuse of discretion, the contracting officer’s election to\n       terminate for the government’s convenience is conclusive.”); see also\n       Krygoski Constr.

In Am–Pro Protective Agency, Inc. v. United States,\n       281 F.3d 1234 (Fed.

Id. at\n       1239 (“[W]e believe that clear and convincing most appropriately\n       describes the burden of proof applicable to the presumption of the\n       governments good faith.”).

While the Government’s right to terminate a contract for convenience is\nnot unlimited, the case law clearly provides that the Government is entitled to\nconsiderable latitude in making such a decision to terminate.” (citations omitted)).\nMoreover, it has been observed that: “‘if the contract contains a termination for\nconvenience clause and the contracting officer could have invoked the clause instead of\nterminating, rescinding or repudiating the contract on some other invalid basis, the court\nwill constructively invoke the clause to retroactively justify the government’s actions,\navoid breach, and limit liability.’” Praecomm, Inc. v.

To\nprove an abuse of discretion, plaintiff must show that the contracting officer’s decision to\nterminate was arbitrary and capricious. See U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co. v. United States, 230\nCt. Cl. 355, 368, 676 F.2d 622, 630 (1982).

United States, 99 Fed. Cl. at 758 (“The\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that a termination for\nconvenience will be upheld unless the contractor can establish bad faith or clear abuse\nof discretion.” (citing T & M Distribs., Inc. v.

Glickman, 55 F.3d at 1581 (“We have stated that ‘[i]t is not the\nprovince of the courts to decide de novo whether termination was the best course. In\nthe absence of bad faith or clear abuse of discretion the contracting officer’s election to\nterminate is conclusive.’” (bracket in original) (quoting Salsbury Indus. v. United States,\n905 F.2d at 1521 (quoting John Reiner & Co. v. United States, 163 Ct. Cl. 381, 390, 325\nF.2d 438, 442 (1963)))).\n\n       Pursuant to 48 C.F.R. § 12.403(b), the contracting officer can terminate contracts\nunder the following guidance:\n\n      Policy. The contracting officer should exercise the Government’s right to\n      terminate a contract for commercial items either for convenience or for\n      cause only when such a termination would be in the best interests of the\n      Government. The contracting officer should consult with counsel prior to\n      terminating for cause.\n\n48 C.F.R. § 12.403(b) (2005). The FAR requires only that a termination for\nconvenience be in the best interests of the government. See 48 C.F.R. § 49.101\n(2005). Plaintiff argues that the terminations of the camp package BPA call, latrine\ncontract, and dumpster contract were not in the Army’s best interests, given its\ncontinuing needs for each of those services. Plaintiff also argues that the terminations\nwere made in violation of 48 C.F.R. § 12.403(b). The termination for convenience\nclause “‘gives the Government the broad right to terminate without cause and limits the\ncontractor’s recovery to costs incurred, profit on work done, and costs of preparing the\ntermination settlement proposal.’” Enron Fed. Solutions, Inc. v. United States, 80 Fed.\nCl. 382, 406 n.21 (2008) (quoting John Cibinic, Jr. and Ralph C. Nash, Jr.,\nAdministration of Government Contracts 1073 (3d ed. 1995)).\n\n       A contracting officer, however, may not terminate a contract “simply to acquire a\nbetter bargain from another source.” Krygoski Constr. Co. v. United States, 94 F.3d at\n1541 (citing Torncello v. United States, 231 Ct. Cl. at 48, 681 F.2d at 772). Similarly,\nthe government is not permitted to enter into a contract without any intention of\nupholding it. See Caldwell & Santmyer, Inc. v. Glickman, 55 F.3d at 1582. However,\n“[t]he mere fact that a contracting officer awards a contract to another company after\nterminating the plaintiff’s contract is insufficient to show bad faith.” Kalvar Corp. v.\nUnited States, 211 Ct. Cl. 192, 199, 543 F.2d 1298, 1302 (1976), cert. denied, 434 U.S.\n830 (1977).\n\n      Regarding the termination of the camp package BPA call for Camp Buehring, the\ngovernment indicates that plaintiff agreed with the termination. Regarding the latrine\n\n                                           132\n\fand dumpster contracts, the phrase, “Termination for Convenience of the Government”\nwas used, the termination for convenience clause was specifically invoked, and a\ncommand directive was invoked. Additionally, Col. Hess’ November 3, 2004 letter to\nMohammed Al Tawash affirmatively stated the latrine contract was “terminated for\nconvenience of the government.” The government also tried to hide behind security\nconcerns to justify not awarding the Camp Virginia call to plaintiff after terminating the\nCamp Buehring call and for terminating the latrine contract and dumpster contract. The\nalleged security incident involving Mohammed Al Tawash occurred on October 7, 2004\nin close proximity to the contract terminations, which all occurred in close proximity to\none another. As noted above, the camp package BPA call was terminated on October\n12, 2004, the latrine contract was terminated on October 18, 2004, and the dumpster\ncontract was terminated on October 22, 2004. At the time of the terminations, however,\nthe October 7, 2004 alleged security incident had not been verified as a security threat.\nThere are also numerous inconsistencies as to reasons for the terminations of the Gulf\nGroup contracts offered by Army personnel at the time and more recently.\n\n        The alleged security incident occurred on Mohammed Al Tawash’s first and only\nday working for Gulf Group. He appears to have been in college at the time and was\neager to make a good impression in his family’s business. He testified that he asked for\na map “[b]ecause we never really had a plan or say a service route or Gulf Group to\nidentify where their latrines were.... To make our job a lot more easier; a lot more\nefficient and to be more effective with how Gulf Group performs with this company.”\nHaving had an opportunity to observe Mohammed Al Tawash at trial, the court found\nhim to be a sincere and credible witness. Although the court understands how\nMohammed Al Tawash’s questions could have sparked suspicion at the time, on a\nmilitary base in a war zone, the court finds the questions to have been innocent and\nwell-motivated, geared to benefiting contract performance. Apparently, the Army also\nfound the questions to have been innocent because the government opened no\ninvestigation or case file, allowed Gulf Group and its employees continued access to the\nbase, and even wrote a letter of explanation on November 3, 2004, within a month of\nthe incident and within days of the terminations of the latrine and dumpster contracts.\nThe explanation letter, quoted above, from Col. Hess addressed to Mohammed Al\nTawash, made clear that the contract was not terminated for security reasons, although\nit incorrectly indicated that certain Gulf Group employees had been barred from Camp\nArifjan, while, at the same time, indicating that Gulf Group should not suffer any\nrepercussions as a result of the incident.\n\n        The government had a duty to substantiate its security concerns before using\nthem as a basis for termination for any of Gulf Group’s contracts. Terminating any of\nGulf Group BPAs or contracts based on security reasons, without finding a need to even\nopen a case or begin a formal investigation, in a situation in which the questions asked\nby Mohammed Al Tawash could have been, and turned out to be, appropriate and\ngermane to improving contract performance, is not reasonable or best practices, and is\narbitrary and capricious. See Darwin Constr. Co. v. United States, 811 F.2d 593, 598\n(Fed. Cir. 1987) (noting that the issuance of a termination without making a “‘judgment\nas to the merits of the case’” is an “‘abdication of responsibility,’” which a court will not\n\n\n                                            133\n\fsanction “‘where there is administrative discretion under a contract.’” (quoting\nSchlesinger v. United States, 390 F.2d 702, 709, 182 Ct. Cl. 571, 584 (1968))). That\nCol. Hess was able to state, within days of the latrine contract termination, that the\nsecurity concerns were not an issue also indicates that an investigation into the incident\nwould have been relatively simple to conduct.\n\n        According to Mr. Wilson, Gulf Group’s Project Manager in Kuwait, Col. Hess\nstated to him that “counterintelligence on the Al Tawash family,” indicated they have ties\nto “Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein,” a charge which is not substantiated anywhere in\nthe record and seems to have appeared from nowhere at the time of the alleged\nsecurity incident, just at the time of the terminations, and was quickly dismissed and\ndisavowed. The record contains no evidence whatsoever linking Gulf Group, Saud Al\nTawash, or any other member of the Al Tawash family to terrorists or to any anti-\nAmerican group. Plaintiff also offered the testimony of Col. Al Salal, who at the time of\nthe trial was a retired Kuwaiti Colonel and, after his retirement from the military was a\nDefense Attaché at the Kuwait Embassy in Saudi Arabia. Col. Al Salal testified that Gulf\nGroup, Gulf Telecom, and Saud Al Tawash were all cleared by Kuwaiti security, that the\nAl Tawash family is well-known in Kuwait, and that he had never heard of any ties\nbetween the Al Tawash family and the Taliban, Saddam Hussein, or other anti-\nAmerican groups. Moreover, none of the members of the Al Tawash family who\ntestified at trial demonstrated any traces of anti-American sentiment. To the contrary,\neach member of the Al Tawash family who testified at the trial, and especially Saud Al\nTawash, seemed to be eager to properly perform well on the contracts at issue in the\nabove-captioned cases, and perform properly on other contracts Gulf Group held at the\ntime. Moreover, Gulf Group continued to perform for the United States government in\nsupport of the United States mission in the region, even following the terminations of the\ncamp package BPA call and the latrine and dumpster contracts.\n\nA.     The Camp Package BPA Call Termination\n\n        As noted above, the camp package BPA call 0001 was terminated on October\n12, 2004 when Maj. Davis issued Modification 103 on behalf of the Army, which stated:\n“The purpose of this modification is to cancel the BPA Call with Gulf Group. Gulf Group\nhas no issues with this cancellation and will accept it at no cost to the government.”\nPlaintiff insists that Maj. Davis did not exercise her own discretion in terminating the\ncamp call 0001, but was acting at the direction of Col. Hess.135 The termination clauses\nin the camp package BPA state:\n\n       (l) Termination for the Government’s convenience. The Government\n       reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole\n       convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall\n135\n    Col. Hess indicated during his testimony at trial that he may have ordered Maj. Davis\nto terminate the camp package BPA call, but also indicated that he may have issued an\norder to terminate the camp package BPA call at Col. Miller’s direction. Col. Hess\ngenerally appeared eager at trial to shift the focus of the testimony from his role in any\nof the contracts at issue, despite his role as head of contracting activity at Camp Arifjan.\n\n                                            134\n\f       immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and\n       all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms\n       of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid a percentage of the contract\n       price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of\n       termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to\n       the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping\n       system, have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be\n       required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost\n       principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government\n       any right to audit the Contractor’s records. The Contractor shall not be\n       paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could\n       have been avoided.\n\n       (m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract,\n       or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor,\n       or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions,\n       or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate\n       assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause,\n       the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for\n       supplies or services not accepted, and the Contract shall be liable to the\n       Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is\n       determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for\n       default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.\n\nAs indicated in plaintiff’s third amended complaint, regarding the claim associated with\nthe termination of the camp package BPA call:\n\n       This claim was initially submitted for a final decision as required under 41\n       U.S.C. §§ [sic] 605 to the then acting contracting officer Major John\n       Cockerham on October 10, 2005, and again on December 16, 2005 in the\n       form of a termination settlement proposal and claim. Gulf Group never\n       received from the Army a response to the claim or a decision to the initial\n       claim. The claim then was re-submitted to other Contracting Officers on\n       October 22, 2006 and again by court order on March 26, 2007, with the\n       most recent submission on April 12, 2011 as ordered by this honorable\n       court136 clarifying Gulf Group’s claim and to expressly state that the\n       termination of BPA Call No. 0001 was arbitration [sic] and capricious.\n\n       Plaintiff’s third amended complaint for the camp package BPA case also alleges:\n\n       The Government’s termination of the contract was not properly based on\n       convenience inasmuch as the Government needed the services, had the\n       requisite funding to fully pay for them at the contract price and indeed\n       contracted with another contractor to provide the same services at the\n136\n    As discussed above, the court did not direct plaintiff to submit a new, certified claim\nto defendant, but rather indicated that plaintiff could, if appropriate, revise its complaint.\n\n                                            135\n\f      same level of demand and for the same period of performance. Moreover,\n      the termination was of no benefit to the Army.\n\nPlaintiff also alleges in the third amended complaint in Case No. 06-835, the camp\npackage BPA case:\n\n      The Government’s termination of this contract was wrongful and a breach\n      of contract emanating from arbitrary and capricious conduct as well as an\n      abuse of discretion inasmuch as the Government broke its promise to\n      award [the contract for Camp] Virginia and the purported basis for\n      termination was a supposed security risk presented by Gulf Group that did\n      not in fact exist and was not documented prior to, at the time of or any\n      time subsequent to termination.\n\n       Plaintiff argues that, to the extent defendant based the termination of its camp\npackage BPA call on security reasons, the termination was an abuse of discretion\nbecause the Army rapidly was able to determine that Gulf Group was not a security risk.\nSimilarly, plaintiff argues that defendant’s assertion that the camp package BPA call for\nCamp Buehring was cancelled in order to award Gulf Group a call for Camp Virginia\ndoes not make the termination reasonable. Although plaintiff’s 2005 camp package\nBPA Claim and Settlement Offer refers to the award of Camp Virginia and there is some\nindication in the record that discussions were held about awarding the larger Camp\nVirginia camp package BPA call to plaintiff, the award did not occur. Plaintiff now terms\nthe discussions a “bait and switch.” The government, in terminating the camp package\nBPA call, wrote, “Gulf Group has no issues with this cancellation and will accept it at no\ncost to the government.” According to Gulf Group, however, no one on behalf of Gulf\nGroup agreed to the termination. Although the record is not clear as to whether an\nagreement to exchange Camp Buehring for Camp Virginia was reached, none was ever\nsigned. Saud Al Tawash’s testimony at trial indicated that there were discussions, that\nhe requested that any proposed exchange of camps to Gulf Group be put in writing, but\nnone ever was, and that Gulf Group’s alleged oral agreement to a termination may have\nbeen contingent in his mind upon an award of Camp Virginia.\n\n        Defendant argues that because of the proposed future camp package BPA call\nfor Camp Virginia, plaintiff “does not claim” that the termination of the camp package\nBPA for Camp Buehring was unreasonable. Defendant interprets plaintiff’s argument to\nbe that the government breached the camp package BPA call “by deciding, after having\nterminated the camp package BPA [call], not to issue to Gulf Group a call for Camp\nVirginia.” Defendant asserts that plaintiff’s argument fails because once the camp\npackage BPA call for Camp Buehring was terminated, there was no contract remaining\nto be breached even when the Army decided not to award the Camp Virginia call to\nplaintiff. Defendant states, “[b]ecause the decision not to award a Camp Virginia call did\nnot breach Call 0001, the Court should reject any claim that the termination of Call 0001\nbreached that contract,” and there was no formal contractual agreement to award a call\nfor Camp Virginia.\n\n\n\n                                           136\n\f       At trial, the testimony from numerous witnesses was inconsistent as to the\nreason why the camp package BPA call for Camp Buehring was terminated. Saud Al\nTawash and Mr. Cockerham both testified that they had been informed by the Army that\nGulf Group’s camp package BPA call for Camp Buehring was going to be terminated in\norder to award Gulf Group a larger camp, Camp Virginia. According to Saud Al\nTawash, “Major Gloria [Davis] has called us and told us that Camp Buehring was going\nto be -- they were going to give us a larger camp, which was Camp Virginia, in lieu of\nCamp Buehring.... They will cancel Buehring, in order to give us Camp Virginia, which\nis a larger camp.” When asked, “[a]nd do you remember when she called?” Saud Al\nTawash answered: “Somewhere around that time frame, the second week of October.”\nMr. Cockerham testified that he knew of the cancellation “because of the office talk, and\nmy desk was like three spaces over from CPT Trimble. Just the talk between he and\nMAJ Davis was that it was going to be cancelled because they were planning on giving\na larger camp to them [Gulf Group].” Mr. Cockerham also offered a rough time frame\nfor the cancellation discussions, stating that the decision to give Camp Virginia to Gulf\nGroup had been made before he became interim Chief of Contracting, which he had\npreviously stated occurred in late October 2004. Mr. Cockerham’s testimony also\nindicated that the Army may have decided to place a hold on the award to plaintiff of the\nCamp Virginia call as a result of the alleged security incident.\n\n        The chronology of events is uncertain regarding the termination of camp package\nBPA call. The camp package BPA call for Camp Buehring was awarded on September\n30, 2004. The alleged security incident occurred on October 7, 2004. The camp\npackage BPA call for Camp Buehring was terminated on October 12, 2004. Oddly, the\nArmy’s second site visit to determine plaintiff’s readiness to perform the camp package\nBPA and to discuss moving up the start date was conducted by Capt. Trimble, Capt.\nNovak, and Lt. Rivera on October 13, 2004, the day after the camp package BPA call\nfor Camp Buehring was terminated. Saud Al Tawash testified that he learned in the\nsecond week of October that the camp package BPA call for Camp Buehring would be\nterminated in exchange for Camp Virginia. There is nothing in the record to clarify\nwhether Saud Al Tawash was informed of the Army’s decision to terminate the Camp\nBuehring call before or after the alleged security incident. Mr. Cockerham’s testimony\nat trial is equally unhelpful, suggesting only that the decision to terminate was made\nbefore the end of October. Despite terminating three of plaintiff’s contracts, defendant\ndid not move to bar plaintiff from future contracts in the war zone and, in fact, continued\nto work with plaintiff on other contracts plaintiff had been awarded, including the bottled\nwater BPA, also at issue in the above-captioned, consolidated cases.\n\n      Mr. Cockerham’s testimony also was not wholly consistent. An unsigned\nOctober 20, 2004 Memorandum for Record,137 similar to a separate memorandum\n137\n    As discussed above, there was no agreement as to who authored the unsigned\nOctober 20, 2004 Memorandum for Record. At trial, Capt. Novak remembered\npreparing a memorandum on this subject in a combined effort between himself, Capt.\nTrimble, and Lt. Rivera. Capt. Novak remembered a document similar to the\nmemorandum quoted above. He testified, however, he did not believe the\nmemorandum in the record is the exact memorandum that he prepared because of the\n\n                                           137\n\fwritten by Capt. Trimble, Capt. Novak, and Lt. Rivera, stated that Mr. Cockerham\ninformed them that the termination of the camp package BPA call was due to Gulf\nGroup’s inexperience. The Memorandum for Record begins: “This memorandum\nconsists of a list of events that describes the background behind the Contracting\nOfficer’s decision and the direct order that was given to cancel all of Gulf Group’s\nContracts.” The Memorandum for Record also states, “Major Cockerham informed the\nCO’s [Capt. Trimble, Capt. Novak, and Lt. Rivera] to cancel the BPA call to Gulf Group\ndue to their inexperience in building tents. Furthermore, Major Cockerham stated that it\nwas in the government’s best interest to place a call to British Link Kuwait, although\ntheir prices were unreasonably high.” At trial, however, Mr. Cockerham denied having\never made such statements. According to Mr. Cockerham, it was Tijani Saani who gave\nCapt. Trimble, Capt. Novak, and Lt. Rivera the information for the October 20, 2004\nMemorandum for Record. Mr. Cockerham testified he believed Tijani Saani had\nindicated that the information was from Mr. Cockerham, but Mr. Cockerham believed\nthat the information actually was from Col. Hess.\n\n        Additional witnesses at trial offered other reasons for the termination of the camp\npackage BPA call. For example, Mr. Wilson, Gulf Group’s Project Manager in Kuwait,\ntestified that Col. Hess told him the Camp Package BPA call and the latrine and\ndumpster contracts were terminated because of terrorist links. Capt. Trimble testified\nthat he knew nothing about the Camp Buehring call being cancelled for a Camp Virginia\ncall but that the camp mayors preferred to continue with their old contractors, while the\nunsigned Memorandum for Record asserted that it “was in the government’s best\ninterest to place a call to British Link Kuwait.” Mr. Libbey indicated in his contracting\nofficer’s final decisions that the contracts were terminated for dumpster diving.138 At\ntrial, Mr. Libbey stated:\n\n      Q: So the lawyers didn’t tell you about that, the reasons for terminating the\n      contract?\n\n      A: No, no, I believe it was due to the going into the dumpster. I do not\n      know anything about, what was it you implied?\n\n      Q: A security risk, a security concern that the family of the company\n      represented to the Army, to the government, to the United States.\n\nphrase in the memorandum, “blessed their capabilities,” which he said “just seems out\nof place to me.” Capt. Novak acknowledged, however, that this memorandum could\nhave been a draft of the final memorandum he prepared. Capt. Trimble did not\nremember writing this memorandum or a similar memorandum, or assisting anyone in\nwriting such a memorandum.\n138\n   At trial, the testimony of Mr. Libbey addressed the camp package BPA, the latrine\ncontract, and the dumpster contract collectively, as he spoke generally about the\n“contracts” and the “final decisions” for much of his testimony. As noted above, Mr.\nLibbey’s testimony at trial was defensive and not clear as to the reasons for the\nterminations or the basis for his final decisions.\n\n                                           138\n\f      A: Going through the dumpsters, that act in and of itself by the workers is\n      a security risk.\n\n        At trial Saud Al Tawash denied the government’s characterization and\nstatements regarding the termination of the camp package BPA call for Camp Buehring,\nand in particular that Gulf Group had no issue with the termination and would accept the\ntermination at no cost to the government. Saud Al Tawash stated: “No, I asked for the\npaperwork [regarding the Camp swap for Camp Virginia] to be sent over.” He also\ntestified that the Camp Virginia papers were never sent to him. The following exchange\nbetween plaintiff’s attorney and Saud Al Tawash indicates that Saud Al Tawash may\nhave spoken to Army personnel about swapping camps:\n\n      Q: And if you read the statement in that item, it says, “the purpose of this\n      notification is to cancel the BPA call with Gulf Group. Gulf Group has no\n      issue in the cancellation and will accept it at no cost to the government.”\n      Did you have any issues as to the cancellation of Camp Buehring at no\n      cost to the government?\n\n      A: Yes, because what was told to me was they’re going to give me -- give\n      our company, Gulf Group General Enterprises, the BPA call for Camp\n      Virginia in lieu of, in exchange of Camp Buehring.\n\n      Q: So, your agreement was conditioned upon them giving you Virginia; is\n      that correct?\n\n      A: Yes.\n                                           ...\n\n      Q: By the time the officers came to your yard, you had no idea of this\n      agreement or did you, to switch Virginia for Buehring?\n\n      A: At the time, I don’t think so. It happened right around that time, though,\n      a day after, two days after, yeah.\n\n       Saud Al Tawash testified that he had attempted to discuss the cancellations of\nthe Camp Buehring call with Col. Hess, but that “[h]e wouldn’t meet with me. I tried to\nmeet with him in the office. I came to Arifjan. He wouldn’t meet with me.” The\nmodification that terminated the camp package BPA call for Camp Buehring does not\nmention any exchange of Camp Buehring for Camp Virginia, or any other camp\npackage BPA call. Moreover, it is odd that the camp package BPA call was terminated\njust twelve days after it was awarded, especially because the parties have stipulated the\nArmy still required the Camp Buehring services and had funding available.\n\n       Plaintiff relies on Col. Hess’ testimony for the assertion that Maj. Davis did not\nexercise her own discretion in the termination of the Camp Buehring call, but, rather,\n\n\n                                          139\n\ffollowed an order from a superior. During his testimony to the court, Col. Hess\nconfirmed that he was the person who had ordered Maj. Davis to terminate the camp\npackage BPA call:\n\n       Q: When Gloria Davis terminated the BPA Call for the camp package on\n       Camp Buehring, was she exercising her discretion?\n\n       A: No.\n\n       Q: Was she following a direct order?\n\n       A: Yes.\n                                             …\n\n       Q: When you ordered Gloria Davis to terminate the BPA camp package\n       for Camp Buehring, did she ask you for a security report or some type of\n       document to back up and document the file?\n\n       A: No.\n\n       When she terminated the Camp Buehring call, BPA call 0001, Maj. Davis may\nhave been acting at the direction of Col. Hess, who, although he was not the assigned\ncontracting officer on the Camp Buehring camp package BPA call, was the Director of\nContracting at Camp Arifjan. Maj. Davis, a warranted contracting officer, was directly\nbelow Col. Hess in the chain of command within the contracting office. Col. Hess did\nnot explicitly testify that Col. Miller directed him to have the BPA call terminated, but he\ndid state “that we were told, directed either directly by Colonel Miller or through his staff\nsections, to get that contractor [Gulf Group] off the installation.” At trial, Col. Miller\ndenied having given such a direction.\n\n       Maj. Davis, however, was unavailable to testify, having committed suicide after\nbeing questioned by Army CID about funds in offshore accounts. Neither Col. Miller nor\nCol. Hess offered explanations for the termination of the Camp Buehring call, although\nCol. Hess indicated he had ordered the termination, possibly at the behest of Col. Miller.\nThe most coherent explanation of the decision to terminate the Camp Buehring call and\nthe decision not to award Camp Virginia to Gulf Group may come from Mr. Cockerham’s\ntestimony at trial.\n\n       As indicated above, Mr. Cockerham sent the following note to Saud Al Tawash\nregarding the termination of the Camp Buehring call:\n\n       Here is a copy of the cancellation to Camp Buehring. This cancellation\n       was made because we were giving you a larger camp call Virginia.\n       Virginia award was verbal with the agreement to cancel Buehring. Virginia\n       was not awarded on paper as a command directive. The original\n\n\n\n                                            140\n\f      cancellation was sent out 13 Oct 04.         But here is another copy as\n      requested. Thank you.\n\nAlthough Saud Al Tawash testified that he interpreted Mr. Cockerham’s note to be a\nnotice that Gulf Group would not receive the award of a Camp Virginia call, Mr.\nCockerham testified that the note may have served as a “reassurance” to Gulf Group,\nexplaining that he intended to convey that, although Army personnel had verbally\nindicated that Gulf Group would receive the award of a Camp Virginia call, the formal\naward had been placed on hold at the direction of Col. Hess. Mr. Cockerham stated\nthat Col. Hess may have been considering another contractor for the Camp Virginia call\nand that Col. Hess “was checking on…some other issues from perhaps a security\nreport.” Mr. Cockerham estimated that the direction not to award a Camp Virginia call to\nGulf Group and the cancellation of Gulf Group’s latrine contract and dumpster contract\noccurred “within a week period of that whole time.” From Mr. Cockerham’s testimony,\ntherefore, it appears that Army personnel may have been directed to place the award of\nthe Camp Virginia call on hold as a result of what appears to be the same alleged\nsecurity incident that led to the terminations of the latrine contract and dumpster\ncontract.\n\n        “‘In the absence of bad faith or a clear abuse of discretion the contracting\nofficer’s election to terminate is conclusive.’” See Caldwell & Santmyer, Inc. v.\nGlickman, 55 F.3d at 1581 (quoting Salsbury Indus. v. United States, 905 F.2d at 1521).\nPlaintiff must present clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption that\ngovernment agents act in good faith. See Am-Pro Protective Agency, Inc. v. United\nStates, 281 F.3d at 1239–40. Plaintiff argues that “[t]he Government’s termination of\nthe contract was not properly based on convenience inasmuch as the Government\nneeded the services, had the requisite funding to fully pay for them at the contract price\nand indeed contracted with another contractor to provide the same services at the same\nlevel of demand and for the same period of performance.” A demonstration that the\ngovernment entered into a contract with no intention of honoring it may be sufficient to\nshow bad faith or an abuse of discretion. See TigerSwan, Inc. v. United States, 110\nFed. Cl. 336, 345 (2013) (citing Krygoski Constr. Co. v. United States, 94 F.3d at 1543–\n44). However, “[t]he mere fact that a contracting officer awards a contract to another\ncompany after terminating the plaintiff’s contract is insufficient to show bad faith.” See\nKalvar Corp. v. United States, 211 Ct. Cl. at 199, 543 F.2d at 1302. At least one judge\nof the Court of Federal Claims has indicated that an offer of additional work that is never\ndelivered may be evidence of a pretextual termination. See IMS Engineers-Architects,\nP.C. v. United States, 87 Fed. Cl. 541, 553 (2009).\n\n      The record before the court does not conclusively demonstrate that defendant\nabused its discretion by intending to benefit another contractor. The record, however,\nalso does not support a performance-based reason to have terminated plaintiff’s camp\npackage BPA call.139 Defendant has consistently maintained that the Army terminated\n139\n    The unsigned October 20, 2004 Memorandum for Record and the October 29, 2004\nletter purportedly written by Col. Miller refer to performance-related issues, but the\nunsigned Memorandum for Record was renounced by various witnesses at trial and the\n\n                                           141\n\fthe Camp Buehring call in order to award Gulf Group a call for Camp Virginia.\nDefendant alleges that the security concerns only factored into the Army’s decision not\nto award Gulf Group a call for Camp Virginia. Plaintiff’s counsel argued, however, that\nthe decision to terminate the Camp Buehring call and the subsequent decision not to\naward a Camp Virginia call cannot be considered separately because they were part of\na “single but two-prong transaction.” Although Saud Al Tawash was not able to identify\nthe exact date on which Maj. Davis had proposed swapping Camp Buehring for Camp\nVirginia, it appears from the record that Saud Al Tawash had indicated he was\namenable to the swap, and that he may even have agreed to the termination of the\nCamp Buehring call on the condition that Gulf Group be awarded a Camp Virginia call.\nConsistent with this understanding, the Army appears to have prepared a call for Camp\nVirginia, although it never issued the call to Gulf Group.\n\n       The timeline of events indicates that the alleged security incident may have\nfactored into the Army’s decision not to award a Camp Virginia call to Gulf Group, but\ndoes not necessarily demonstrate that the alleged security incident motivated the\nArmy’s decision to terminate the Camp Buehring call. The alleged security incident\noccurred on Thursday, October 7, 2004, and the Camp Buehring call was terminated on\nTuesday, October 12, 2004. The latrine and dumpster contracts were not terminated\nuntil Monday, October 18, 2004 and Friday, October 22, 2004, respectively. Although\nthe alleged security incident occurred before the termination of the camp package call\nfor Camp Buehring, Mr. Cockerham’s testimony regarding the hand-written note that he\nsent to Saud Al Tawash indicates that the termination of the Camp Buehring call also\nmay have resulted from discussions that preceded the October 7, 2004 alleged security\nincident, even though, at one point during his testimony, Saud Al Tawash indicated that\nan actual agreement to swap camps may have been formed after October 7, 2004.\nAccording to Mr. Cockerham, the alleged security incident did not impact Gulf Group’s\nperformance under the camp package BPA until Col. Hess put the formal award of a\nCamp Virginia call on hold pending a review of a “security report.” Mr. Cockerham’s\nexplanation that the Camp Buehring call was terminated by agreement also is\nconsistent with the different language used in the camp package BPA call termination,\nversus the latrine contract and dumpster contract terminations. The termination of the\ncamp package BPA call for Camp Buehring indicated that Gulf Group was aware of,\nand had even agreed to the termination, while the latrine and dumpster contract\nterminations indicated that they were issued “by order of the ASG Commander Kuwait\nCOL Brick Miller” and cited provisions of the FAR relating to terminations for\nconvenience.\n\n       Moreover, numerous Army personnel testified that defendant believed that Gulf\nGroup was fully capable of performing under the camp package BPA, despite the\nOctober 29, 2004 unsigned letter purportedly from Col. Miller. The Army continued to\nissue calls to Gulf Group under the camp package BPA after the alleged security\nincident was resolved. Approximately two months after the termination of the Camp\nBuehring call, for example, Army personnel awarded Gulf Group a call for Camp Victory\n\nunsigned letter purportedly written by Col. Miller was contradictory to the conclusions of\nthe officers who conducted the second site visit.\n\n                                           142\n\fand a call for a naval base in Kuwait, as well as for the Ash Shuaybah Sea Port of\nDebarkation. In fact, the Army continued to issue camp package BPA calls to Gulf\nGroup through 2005 and 2006.\n\n        Although the timeline of events is far from clear, the record reflects a sufficient\nand possible good faith explanation for the termination of the Camp Buehring call.\nPlaintiff recognizes in its post-trial briefing, Maj. Davis’ death makes the details of the\ntermination of the Camp Buehring call “less apparent” than the details of the latrine\ncontract and dumpster contract terminations. Although Maj. Davis was unavailable to\ntestify as to her reasons for terminating the Camp Buehring call, both Saud Al Tawash\nand Mr. Cockerham confirmed that, at some point, the Army had decided to cancel the\nCamp Buehring call in order to award a Camp Virginia call to Gulf Group. Although the\nalleged security incident may have caused Col. Hess not to implement the decision to\naward Camp Virginia to plaintiff, the record suggests that Col. Hess may have\ncountermanded the decision to award Gulf Group a Camp Virginia call after the\ntermination of the Camp Buehring call, and after the alleged security incident had\noccurred. Given the timing of events and the testimony of Saud Al Tawash and Mr.\nCockerham, the court does not agree with plaintiff that the termination of the Camp\nBuehring call and the decision not to award a Camp Virginia call to Gulf Group are\nnecessarily part of the same transaction. Although the court recognizes that the record\nreflects unanswered questions with regard to the termination of the Camp Buehring call,\nplaintiff has failed to present the court with clear and convincing evidence to rebut the\npresumption that Army personnel terminated the Camp Buehring call in order to award\na Camp Virginia call in good faith. See Am–Pro Protective Agency, Inc. v. United\nStates, 281 F.3d at 1240–41. Although the government officials may have indicated a\nwillingness to award a Camp Virginia call to plaintiff in exchange for the Camp Buehring\ncall, there was no contractual obligation on the part of the government to award the\nCamp Virginia call to Gulf Group. Considering the high burden that plaintiff must\novercome to show that Maj. Davis abused her discretion when she terminated the\nCamp Buehring call, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that defendant abused its\ndiscretion in terminating plaintiff’s Camp Buehring call for the convenience of the\ngovernment.\n\n        Although proof that a termination for convenience was an abuse of discretion\nrenders the terminated contract breached, Krygoski Constr. Co. v. United States, 94\nF.3d at 1541, “[i]n the absence of bad faith or clear abuse of discretion, the contracting\nofficer’s election to terminate for the government’s convenience is conclusive.” T & M\nDistribs., Inc. v. United States, 185 F.3d at 1283. The termination for convenience of\nthe camp package BPA was within the contracting officer’s discretion and, therefore, the\ntermination of the camp package BPA call was not a breach of contract. The plaintiff’s\nthird amended complaint in Case No. 06-835C, the camp package BPA claim, alleges\nthat:\n\n      The Government, by virtue of its arbitrary decision to cancel the contract\n      without just cause, diverted business away from Gulf Group and thereby\n      caused Gulf Group to sustain substantial damages. The Government is\n\n\n                                           143\n\f      required to fully compensate Gulf Group for those damages and to put\n      Gulf Group in as good a position as it would have been had the\n      Government not cancelled the contract, including fair compensation for the\n      preparatory expenses incurred in furtherance of the contract and in\n      pursuing the claim submitted to the Contracting Officers, as well as profits\n      Gulf Group would have generated under the BPA Call and Master BPA\n      upon which Gulf Group fully relied, interest, legal fees and costs of\n      litigation.\n\n      As a result of the Government’s arbitrary and wrongful termination of the\n      contract, Gulf Group is entitled to damages in the form of preparatory\n      expenses of KWD 19,323.000 equivalent to U.S. $69,002.43 calculated at\n      the exchange rate of 1 KWD @ U.S. $3.571; fees and costs incurred in\n      the preparation and presentation of a termination claim and settlement\n      proposal that was presented to the Contracting Officers in Kuwait in the\n      sum of U.S. $7,037.50; in addition to lost profits of KWD 237,135.791\n      equivalent to U.S. $846,811.91 calculated at the exchange rate of 1 KWD\n      @ 3.571 representing the lost profits for the entire 6 months duration of\n      the BPA Call that was awarded. Gulf Group also is entitled to prejudgment\n      interest under the Contract Dispute [sic] Act, the specific sum of which will\n      be proven at the time of trial.\n\n(internal citations omitted; emphasis in original). As there was no “arbitrary and\nwrongful termination of the contract” with respect to the camp package BPA call, plaintiff\ncannot recover on the camp package BPA call on the basis of a breach. Moreover, as\nnoted above, plaintiff’s argument by analogy that lost profits could be included for other\ncalls issued under the BPA relies on situations in which the wronged contractor can\nprove that the government chose, in bad faith, not to exercise the option periods.140\nSee, e.g., Hi-Shear Tech. Corp. v. United States, 356 F.3d at 1374, 1375, 1380;\nBlackstone Consulting, Inc. v. Gen. Servs. Admin., CBCA 718, 08-1 BCA ¶ 33,770;\nGreenlee Constr., Inc. v. Gen. Servs. Admin., CBCA 416, 07-1 BCA ¶ 33,514. As the\ncourt also determined above, there is no evidence that, had the camp package BPA call\nnot been terminated, the government would have continued placing orders under the\ncamp package BPA or would have abused its discretion in not placing orders under the\nBPA. The government is not obligated to issue orders under a BPA or exercise an\noption that is not otherwise restricted. See, e.g., Gov’t Sys. Advisors, Inc. v. United\nStates, 847 F.2d at 813 (“An option is normally an option, and nothing in [the provision\nat issue], or in any other contract clause, limited the circumstances under which the\ngovernment could decline to exercise that bargained-for right in this case.”).\nFurthermore, anticipatory profits are generally not an available remedy when the\ngovernment terminates a contract for convenience. See AR Sales Co., Inc. v. United\nStates, 49 Fed. Cl. 621, 630 (2001); Mega Constr. Co. v. United States, 29 Fed. Cl.\n396, 473 (1993); Dairy Sales Corp. v. United States, 219 Ct. Cl. 431, 436–37, 593 F.2d\n140\n   As noted above, plaintiff specifically dropped any earlier allegations of bad faith\nagainst the government in its third amended complaint in Case No. 06-835C, the camp\npackage BPA case.\n\n                                           144\n\f1002, 1005 (1979); William Green Constr. v. United States, 201 Ct. Cl. 616, 626–27,\n477 F.2d 930, 936-37 (1973), cert. denied, 417 U.S. 909 (1974).\n\n     In addition to its breach claims, however, plaintiff also alleges in its third\namended complaint:\n\n       On May 21, 2007 the Contracting Officer Joe L. Libbey of the U.S. Army\n       Contracting Agency for Southwest Asia - Kuwait, issued a final decision on\n       the camp package BPA granting in part and denying in part Gulf Group’s\n       claim for damages, awarding compensation in the amount of $33,053.57\n       plus interest. Gulf Group seeks additional compensation be awarded by\n       this Court for its damages that were denied all as it will be shown at the\n       time of trial.\n\n(internal citation omitted). The majority of the testimony at trial addressed the award of\nthe contracts and BPAs, the alleged security incident and the government’s reaction to\nthe incident, the hiring of Ms. Blake, Saud Al Tawash’s relationship with Mr. Cockerham,\nand the inflated claims. Little testimony at trial specifically addressed the denied\nelements of Gulf Group’s 2007 claim on the camp package BPA before Mr. Libbey.\n\n        The task before the court to determine if plaintiff is entitled to additional\ncompensation under the existing termination for convenience of the camp package BPA\ncall also is made more difficult by the numerous and different claim amounts submitted\nto Mr. Libbey in the form of certified claims, and to this court in the form of complaints\nand amended complaints. Plaintiff has sought various amounts for recovery on the\ncamp package BPA claim, including $10,000,000.00 in its 2005 Claim and Settlement\nOffer to Mr. Cockerham, which also proposed a $4,544,339.84 “settlement offer,” and\n$7,000,000.00 in its 2007 claim to Mr. Libbey. In its original complaint in Case No. 06-\n835C, the camp package BPA case, plaintiff sought $7,000,000.00. In its first amended\ncomplaint in the camp package BPA case, plaintiff sought $2,682,160.86.141 In its\nsecond amended complaint in the camp package BPA case, plaintiff sought\n$3,463,287.57.142 Subsequently, in its third amended complaint in the camp package\ncase, plaintiff now seeks $922,851.84.143\n\n      Few exhibits introduced at trial offer any support for plaintiff’s specific claims after\nthe contracting officer’s final decision. The most specific information may come from\n141\n   Plaintiff sought $1,447,457.22 in lost profits, $1,234,703.64 in preparatory expenses,\nlegal fees, costs incurred in preparing a settlement of plaintiff’s claims, and interest.\n142\n   Plaintiff sought $3,387,247.64 in lost profits, $69,002.43 in preparatory expenses,\n$7,037.50 in fees and costs incurred in preparing the settlement for plaintiff’s claims,\nprejudgment interest, cost of litigation, and attorneys’ fees.\n143\n    Plaintiff now seeks $846,811.91 in lost profits, $69,002.43 in preparatory expenses,\n$7,037.50 in fees and other costs, prejudgment interest, costs of litigation, and\nattorneys’ fees.\n\n                                            145\n\fthe 2011 “notice of filing revised claim,” in which plaintiff indicated: “Group General\nEnterprises, Co.

For example, Saud Al Tawash tried to explain\nthe reduction in the number of tower lights as follows:\n\n       Q: And did you, in fact, obtain or purchase from Kuwait Leaders 13\n       magnum tower lights?\n\n       A: We only purchased one from them.\n\n       Q: Why?\n\n       A: They had one that was available to us. The rest was not available. And\n       so, we purchased what they have, so we can bring it in, into the yard and\n       spec it out.\n\n                                             147\n\f       Q: Show it to the Army, is that –\n\n       A: We had -- we brought it into our yard, yeah, and our project manager at\n       that time, Mr. Bobby Wilson, he wanted to see the equipment and make\n       sure that this is the right specs to the Army. So, they had one delivered to\n       us prior to ordering the rest of the 13, because they’re expensive.\n\n        Plaintiff included in its 2011 notice and 2011 submission to Maj. Everett the\nidentical forms, purchase orders, checks, and hand-written notes included in the original\n2005 Claim and Settlement Offer to Mr. Cockerham. Plaintiff did not, however, identify\nthe differences in its costs in the 2011 notice and the third amended complaint from the\namounts awarded by Mr. Libbey in his May 21, 2007 contracting officer’s final decision\non the camp package BPA claim. In his final decision, Mr. Libbey wrote:\n\n       I determine Gulf Group is entitled to KD 1,765 for lights, KD 4,000 for\n       tents, and KD 3,490 for generators. This represents the percentage of\n       contract performance of the contract performed before contract\n       termination for which Gulf Group has not been compensated. Gulf Group\n       has not shown they incurred costs for water, and the only loss Gulf Group\n       incurred for dumpsters and latrines is anticipatory profit, which is not\n       allowable in this case. Gulf Group has failed to provide information\n       regarding settlement proposal preparation costs, and has failed to provide\n       information regarding legal costs incurred from perusing this matter before\n       the Court of Federal Claims. Therefore, no costs have been established\n       for submittal and pursuit of the termination settlement proposal. Gulf\n       Group is entitled to $33,053.57, plus interest. I believe this [sic] a fair and\n       reasonable settlement.\n\n        Notably, Mr. Libbey determined that Gulf Group was entitled to the same amount\nfor the tower lights, tents, and generators as plaintiff claims in its revised settlement. No\nsupport was given at trial for the added claim of Mr. Biju Mathew, and the testimony by\nSaud Al Tawash in support of the fifty dumpsters was confused and unsupported. At\ntrial, Saud Al Tawash provided the following testimony:\n\n       Q: What is the document at page 263?\n\n       A: This is a PO [Purchase Order] to Malika factory for steel works. They’re\n       the steel fabricator for the dumpsters.\n\n       Q: And are these the dumpsters that were required under BPA call\n       number one, Mr. Al Tawash?\n\n       A: Yeah, 61 pieces.\n\n\n\n\n                                            148\n\f       Q: And the size of the dumpsters, is that the correct size that was required\n       under the BPA?\n\n       A: This is the right size, six cubic feet\n\n       Q: So is this -- what is this?\n\n       A: This is dumpsters and it was ordered by Gulf Group.\n\n       Q: So is this for the 61 dumpsters that you had placed the purchase order\n       for with the Malika factory?\n\n       A: Yeah.\n\n       Q: And I see quantity 50, not 61. Do you know why?\n\n       A: As I said earlier, we may have had the inventory for the product, so\n       whatever the balance that we’re not having in the inventory, we would go\n       out on the market and purchase it, to have -- be prepared and readiness\n       for the contract.\n\n        The balance of the testimony did not clarify the discrepancies between the\nnumber of dumpsters, nor was there a demonstration that Gulf Group had actually paid\nfor the balance of the fifty dumpsters. Plaintiff only submitted an invoice for the\ndumpsters in its 2011 notice for the camp package BPA, without explaining whether the\npurchase of the dumpsters was attributable to Gulf Group’s performance of the camp\npackage BPA. In addition, plaintiff did not substantiate that it incurred additional costs\nfor the services of an accountant.144\n\n        Notwithstanding plaintiff’s minimal effort to demonstrate that it should be\ncompensated for the costs attributable to the purchase of dumpsters and Mr. Mathew’s\naccounting services, defendant has conceded that these costs were incurred in\nplaintiff’s performance of the contract. The parties stipulated that “Gulf Group ordered\n61 (6cm) dumpsters for use in the performance of BPA Call 0001 pursuant to BPA\nW912D1-04-A-0047, only [sic] 50 were delivered at a cost of 10,000 kd.” Defendant\nalso conceded in its post-trial brief that Gulf Group “actually spent only 19,323\nKD…preparing to perform Call 0001,” citing to the amount claimed in plaintiff’s 2011\nnotice. Defendant did not argue that costs associated with the dumpsters and Mr.\nMathew’s services could have been mitigated or avoided, or are otherwise not\nrecoverable. Instead, defendant treated the costs as validly incurred in plaintiff’s\npreparation to perform the Camp Buehring call. The court concludes, therefore, that\ndefendant has conceded that plaintiff incurred costs, both in purchasing the fifty\n144\n   The amount that plaintiff claims that it incurred for accounting services appears to be\nconsistent with the amount that plaintiff attributes to accounting services in its lost profit\ncalculations with respect to the camp package BPA, the latrine contract, and the\ndumpster contract.\n\n                                              149\n\fdumpsters and in utilizing Mr. Mathew’s services, in preparation of performing the camp\npackage BPA call. Plaintiff is entitled to 19,323.000 KD, plus interest, which is the full\namount of costs claimed in plaintiff’s 2011 notice, less attorneys’ fees.\n\n         In plaintiff’s 2011 notice for the camp package BPA, plaintiff also seeks “legal\nexpenses incurred in preparation of the claim” as a result of Ferdinand Peters’ work on\nplaintiff’s 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer. The FAR provides that settlement\nexpenses, including “[a]ccounting, legal, clerical, and similar costs reasonably\nnecessary for...[t]he preparation and presentation, including supporting data, of\nsettlement claims to the contracting officer,” may be recoverable in the event of a\ncontract termination. See 48 C.F.R. § 31.205–42 (2005). Attorney Peters provided, at\nbest, incorrect information during the preparation of the 2005 camp package BPA Claim\nand Settlement Offer. Attorney Peters, in part, is why defendant has alleged that Gulf\nGroup submitted false claims relating to the termination of the camp package BPA call.\nAttorneys’ fees incurred in the submission of a “meritless” settlement proposal, which\nresults in a “legally insufficient and factually unsupportable” claim, are not recoverable.\nSee OK’s Cascade Co. v. United States, 97 Fed. Cl. 635, 649–50 (2011), aff’d, 467 F.\nApp’x 888 (Fed. Cir. 2012); see also Sensorcom, Inc. v. Scitor, Inc., No. JFM–09–3143,\n2011 WL 1897521, at *2–3 (D. Md. May 18, 2011). In its 2005 camp package BPA\nClaim and Settlement Offer, Gulf Group followed required procedures in proposing a\nsettlement to the contracting officer following a termination for convenience. See 48\nC.F.R. § 49.602–1(b) (“Standard Form 1436, Settlement Proposal (Total Cost Basis),\nshall be used to submit settlement proposals resulting from the termination of fixed-price\ncontracts....”). Gulf Group, however, did not engage in typical settlement negotiations\nas it asserted entitlement to a fixed amount in addition to making a settlement proposal.\nAs indicated above, Gulf Group’s 2005 camp package BPA Claim and Settlement Offer\nwas unsupported and without a legal or factual basis. Although Gulf Group’s 2011\nsubmission to Maj. Everett may have included some additional factual information and\ntried to correct legal errors in its 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer, Gulf Group cannot\nrecover attorneys’ fees for claims submitted to the contracting officer after litigation has\ncommenced. See OK’s Cascade Co. v. United States, 97 Fed. Cl. at 649 (“[T]o the\nextent settlement proposal costs were incurred after the commencement of this\nlitigation, the costs are improper because the FAR provides for settlement costs\nsubmitted to the contracting officer as a result of the termination.”). Moreover, costs\nincurred in submitting a claim to a contracting officer are not otherwise generally\nrecoverable. See Scott Timber Co. v. United States, 97 Fed. Cl. 685, 707 (2011), rev’d\non other grounds, 692 F.3d 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2012), reh’g and reh’g en banc denied, 499\nF. App’x 973 (Fed. Cir. 2013); see also Envtl. Tectonics Corp. v. United States, 72 Fed.\nCl. 290, 298 (2006) (quoting 48 C.F.R. § 31.205–47(f) (“‘Costs not covered elsewhere in\nthis subsection are unallowable if incurred in connection with...prosecution of claims or\nappeals against the Federal Government....’”) (emphasis in original)); cf. Levernier\nConstr., Inc. v. United States, 947 F.2d 497, 500 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (“[A]t its earliest, EAJA\n[Equal Access to Justice Act] coverage may begin after the decision of and in pursuit of\nan appeal from the decision of a contracting officer.”). The court, therefore, denies\nplaintiff’s request for additional compensation arising from Attorney Peters’ services in\n\n\n\n                                            150\n\fthe preparation of plaintiff’s 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer for the camp package\nBPA.\n\n       In sum, the court finds that camp package BPA call No. 0001 was not breached\nby the government’s termination on October 12, 2004. Because defendant conceded\nthat plaintiff is entitled to costs incurred in preparing to perform the contract, the court\nawards plaintiff 19,323.000 KD, plus interest, under the camp package BPA.\n\nB.     The Latrine and Dumpster Contract Terminations\n\n        In plaintiff’s second amended complaints in both Case No. 06-858C, the latrine\ncase, and Case No. 06-853C, the dumpster case, plaintiff alleges “[t]he Government’s\ntermination of the contract was not properly based on convenience inasmuch as the\nGovernment needed the services, had the requisite funding to fully pay for them at the\ncontract price and contracted with one or more other contractors to provide the same\nservices at the same level of demand.” Plaintiff further claims that Gulf Group had done\nnothing to merit terminations for default for either the latrine or dumpster contracts,\nusing the exact same language in each of the second amended complaints: “Gulf Group\nhad not committed any default or breach justifying termination nor done or failed to do\nanything that would be a justifiable cause for termination.” Defendant similarly provided\nthe same responses in its answers to plaintiff’s second amended complaints in the\nlatrine and dumpster cases, denying plaintiff’s allegations. Because the language of\nplaintiff’s allegations and defendant’s responses, are virtually identical in both cases, the\ncourt analyzes the terminations of the latrine and dumpster contracts together.\n\n       The latrine contract, W912D1-04-P-0932, was terminated pursuant to 48 C.F.R.\n§ 52.212-4, on October 18, 2004, when Mr. Cockerham issued Modification P00002 on\nbehalf of the Army. Modification P00002 stated: “This contract is being canceled due to\ncommand directive of the ASG commander SWA COL Brick Miller 3rd Army Arcent\nKuwait. The contract is canceled under the terms of 52.212-1, 52-212-4 [sic], 52.249-\n4.” The parties stipulated that: “The Government did not terminate Gulf Group for\ndefault under Contract W912D1-04-P-0932 [the latrine contract]. At the time Contract\nW912D1-04-P-0932 was terminated, the Government had not issued any cure notices\nto Gulf Group regarding Gulf Group’s performance of its contractual obligations under\nthat contract, and none was ever issued at any time thereafter.” Despite terminating\nGulf Group’s latrine contract, the government had sufficient funds to pay for, and\ncontinued to be in need of, the latrine services.\n\n        The dumpster contract, W912D1-04-P-0897, was terminated pursuant to 48\nC.F.R. § 52.212-4, on October 22, 2004, when Mr. Cockerham issued Modification\nP00005 on behalf of the Army, which terminated the dumpster contract for the\nconvenience of the government. Like the latrine contract termination, the modification\nissued to cancel the dumpster contract stated: “Contract is canceled by order of the\nASG Commander Kuwait COL Brick Miller. Contract was canceled in accordance with\nFAR Part 52-212-4 Termination for Convenience of the Government,” which, as with the\nlatrine contract, was incorporated by reference into the dumpster contract. The parties\n\n\n                                            151\n\fstipulated that: “The Government did not terminate Gulf Group for default under\nContract W912D1-04-P-0897,” and “[a]t the time Contract W912D1-04-P-0897 was\nterminated, the Government had not issued any Cure Notices to Gulf Group regarding\nGulf Group’s performance of its contractual obligations under that contract, and none\nwas ever issued at any time thereafter.” Despite the termination of Gulf Group’s\ndumpster contract, the government had sufficient funds to pay for, and continued to be\nin need of, the dumpster services.\n\n       The latrine and dumpster contracts incorporated by reference the standard\ntermination for convenience and the termination for cause clauses, identical to the\nclauses in the camp package BPA quoted above. The latrine contract also incorporated\nby reference 48 C.F.R. § 52.249–1 (1984), Termination for Convenience of the\nGovernment (Fixed–Price) (Short Form), which states: “The Contracting Officer, by\nwritten notice, may terminate this contract, in whole or in part, when it is in the\nGovernment’s interest. If this contract is terminated, the rights, duties, and obligations of\nthe parties, including compensation to the Contractor, shall be in accordance with Part\n49 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation in effect on the date of this contract.” In\naddition, the latrine contract incorporated by reference 48 C.F.R § 52.249–4 (1984),\nTermination for Convenience of the Government (Services) (Short Form), which states:\n“The Contracting Officer, by written notice, may terminate this contract, in whole or in\npart, when it is in the Government’s interest. If this contract is terminated, the\nGovernment shall be liable only for payment under the payment provisions of this\ncontract for services rendered before the effective date of termination.”145\n\n        In defendant’s second post-trial brief, defendant states that “Mr. Cockerham\nissued a contract modification terminating the latrine contract for the convenience of the\nGovernment, effective October 18, 2004,” and “Mr. Cockerham issued a contract\nmodification terminating the dumpster contract for the convenience of the Government,\neffective October 22, 2004.” Defendant asserts that either Mr. Cockerham exercised his\nown discretion by agreeing with the directions from Col. Miller to terminate the\ncontracts, or implemented the terminations at the direction of Col. Hess, Director of\nContracting at Camp Arifjan. At trial, it remained unclear as to who was responsible for\nthe order to terminate the latrine contract and the dumpster contract, with conflicting\ntestimony offered, including from Col. Hess and Col. Miller. Col. Hess testified that Col.\nMiller ordered that Gulf Group’s latrine and dumpster contracts be terminated, and Col.\nMiller denied that he had ordered the terminations.\n\n      In the same post-trial brief, however, defendant insists that the latrine contract\nwas terminated for the convenience of the government due to force protection and\n145\n   The preamble to the 48 C.F.R. § 52.249–4 states: “As prescribed in 49.502(c), insert\nthe following clause in solicitations and contracts for services, regardless of value, when\na fixed-price contract is contemplated and the Contracting Officer determines that\nbecause of the kind of services required, the successful offeror will not incur substantial\ncharges in preparation for and in carrying out the contract, and would, if terminated for\nthe convenience of the Government, limit termination settlement charges to services\nrendered before the date of termination.” See 48 C.F.R. § 52.249–4.\n\n                                            152\n\fsecurity issues, and that the Army did not breach the contracts. Defendant argues that\n“the latrine contract was terminated for the convenience of the Government for security\nreasons.” In the same brief regarding the dumpster contract, defendant also asserts,\n“[d]espite what Col. Miller and Col. Hess may believe, the October 7, 2004 security\nincident is almost certainly what set in motion the termination of the dumpster contract.”\n(internal citation omitted). Mr. Cockerham testified that he requested a meeting to\ndocument the security issues before terminating the latrine and dumpster contracts, but\ncould not get one with Col. Hess. In the answer to the third amended complaint in the\ncamp package BPA case, Case No. 06-835C, and in the answer to the second\namended complaint in both the latrine case, Case No. 06-858C, and the dumpster case,\nCase No. 06-853C, defendant admitted “that Lieutentant [sic] Colonel Hess did not\nprovide former Major Cockerham with a security report.”\n\n        Defendant argues that the alleged security incident, in which Mohammed Al\nTawash was detained after asking questions, taking notes, and making drawings of\nlocations of buildings on the military base in order to assist in determining placement\nlocations for dumpsters under the plaintiff’s contract with the government, including the\nlocations for where the general officer lived and whether the water and communications\ntowers were the highest points on base, was initially reported as a potential criminal or\nterrorist incident. At trial, during direct examination of Col. Hess, plaintiff’s counsel read\nback Col. Hess’ deposition testimony to him, in which he stated\n\n       there was concern raised by the security and intel community on [Camp]\n       Arifjan that the company or owners of the company were involved, and I\n       don’t recall even with whom, but they were involved with people of\n       interest, be it, I’m not sure if it was Taliban, I’m not sure if it was Saddam\n       Hussein’s outfit, any of that, but they were concerned about the\n       involvement of the owners of this company being involved with enemies of\n       America.\n\n       Although defendant continued to assert that at the time of the terminations the\nArmy believed there were security concerns, on November 3, 2004, just sixteen days\nafter plaintiff’s latrine contract was terminated, and just twelve days after plaintiff’s\ndumpster contract was terminated, defendant wrote the apology letter signed by Col.\nHess, indicating that the Army had determined that Gulf Group, in fact, did not pose a\nsecurity threat. Defendant, however, adds a curious aside in its second post-trial brief:\n“Although the contract had been terminated because of security concerns, the\ncontracting command acceded to the congressman’s specific request, and wrote that\nthe latrine contract ‘was not terminated because of security reasons.’” Presumably, if\nthe security concerns were real, the senior officers responsible would have investigated\nthe relevant facts before quickly issuing a letter denying any official security concerns.\nAs noted above, courts assume government officials act in good faith. The Army acting\non or acceding to the request of a United States Congressman, if a real security threat\nexisted, would undermine that assumption.\n\n\n\n\n                                            153\n\f       The government did not even open a case or launch an investigation into the\nalleged security incident before terminating the latrine or dumpster contracts,\nsuggesting that terminations may already have been part of the government’s plan prior\nto the alleged security incident. For example, the parties have stipulated that “[a]ll or\npart of the service that was initially awarded to Gulf Group under the latrine contract\nwas awarded to Jasmine.” Col. Hess testified at trial, after reviewing the joint exhibits,\nthat Jasmine was awarded a latrine contract on October 18, 2004, the same day Gulf\nGroup’s latrine contract was cancelled. At trial, Saud Al Tawash testified that “Jasmine\npicked up where I left. Jasmine is a competitor, and they absorbed -- when we were\ncanceled, Jasmine took over our portion of the contract from Camp Arifjan.” In addition,\nbefore the Army terminated Gulf Group’s dumpster contract, it sent out a request to\nanother contractor, Fouad Salem of Abdul Hameed Salem, seeking a quote for\ndumpster services at Camp Arifjan. The request was sent out on October 14, 2004, but\nthe cancellation of Gulf Group’s dumpster contract was not signed until October 21,\n2004. Also, before the Army terminated the dumpster contract, it awarded a dumpster\ncontract to another contractor, Green Valley, on October 18, 2004. The government\ncontinued to require, and had available funds to pay for the dumpster services.\n\n      The record, including the trial testimony, reveals varied and inconsistent\nexplanations by defendant’s witnesses concerning the reasons for the terminations of\nGulf Group’s contracts. On November 3, 2004, Col. Hess sent the letter to Mohammed\nAl Tawash regarding cancellation of Gulf Group’s latrine contract, which stated in part:\n\n      Please rest assured that the Gulf Group’s contract to service portable\n      latrines at Army camps in Kuwait was not terminated because of security\n      reasons. While it is true that some employees of the Gulf Group have\n      been either barred from the installation or warned because they had not\n      followed the rules for contract employees on the installation, these\n      incidents did not cause the termination of the contract.\n\n      The contracting officer terminated the contract because circumstances\n      arose that caused the contracting officer to conclude that it was in the best\n      interest of the Army to terminate the contract. Since the contract was\n      terminated for convenience of the government, the Gulf Group should not\n      suffer any repercussions to its reputation or competitive standing. The\n      Gulf Group is fully eligible to compete for other Army contracts in Kuwait.\n      I hope this clarifies this unfortunate misunderstanding.146\n146\n    At trial, among other evasive and contradictory statements he made, Col. Hess\nattempted to distance himself from the November 3, 2004 apology letter, when he\ntestified:\n\n      Q: The first sentence in the third paragraph [of the November 3, 2004,\n      apology letter, quoted above,] recites, and I quote, “the contracting officer\n      terminated the contract because circumstances arose that caused the\n      contracting officer to conclude that it was in the best interest of the Army\n      to terminate the contract.” In the previous paragraph we said that security\n\n                                           154\n\f        According to Col. Hess’ recollection at trial regarding the November 3, 2004 letter\nto Mohammed Al Tawash, the security and espionage concerns about Gulf Group\n“turned out to be unfounded,” and the statement that some Gulf Group employees had\nbeen barred was, likewise, untrue and inaccurate. Col. Hess indicated he had obtained\nthat information to insert into the letter from Col. Miller. At trial, Col. Hess elaborated:\n\n       My recollection of the letter was we went through all the security stuff, all\n       the concerns about espionage in the previous few exhibits we went\n       through, and it turned out to be unfounded. This is my recollection. As\n       such, we still had a viable contractor that we could do business with. The\n       purpose of this letter was to put Gulf Group on notice that we still would\n       like to consider them to do Army contracting, to engage, to bid on Army\n       requirements in the future.\n\nCol. Hess further indicated at trial that the contracts were terminated for convenience,\nrather than for default, because the government did not “want to cause any undue\nhardship” for Gulf Group. At trial, however, Col. Hess testified that he believed Gulf\nGroup’s latrine and dumpster contracts were terminated for security reasons by the\ncontracting officer at Col. Miller’s request. Col. Hess stated, “[w]e were ordered to get\nGulf Group off the bases, the camps,” and that “[m]y concern was to get the contractor\noff Brick Miller’s installations.…”\n\n       Col. Miller, however, denied directing the termination of the contracts and stated\nthat he did not have the authority to order the terminations. Adding to the confusion\nsurrounding the termination of the latrine and dumpster contracts, and, despite noting\nthat his command was completely separate from contracting, Col. Miller, nonetheless,\nstated that the terminations were not related to the alleged security incident, suggesting\nthat he had personal knowledge about the basis for the terminations, although he did\nnot elaborate.\n\n       According to Maj. Petty’s recollection, some or all of Gulf Group’s contracts were\nterminated because of the alleged security incident. Capt. Novak testified that one of\nGulf Group’s contracts was terminated because of a security incident, but he did not\nknow which one. Col. Portouw thought the cancellations were related to poor latrine\nperformance. Mr. Cockerham testified that Col. Hess directed him to cancel Gulf\nGroup’s contracts for national security reasons. Col. Hess testified that Mr. Cockerham\nwas following a command directive when he terminated the dumpster contract and was\nnot exercising his own discretion. Mr. Cockerham confirmed that Col. Hess had\ndirected him to cancel the dumpster contract. Mr. Cockerham also testified:\n\n\n       reasons were not the basis for the termination. What did you have in mind\n       in writing this third sentence as the circumstances that were in the best\n       interest of the Army?\n\n       A: I’m not sure what I meant by that sentence.\n\n                                            155\n\f         Q: Did I understand your testimony correctly that you supported Colonel\n         Miller’s and Colonel’s Hess’ decision to terminate Gulf Group’s contracts\n         in the name of national security, but not for any other reason?\n\n         A: Correct.\n\n         Q: So if the reason for terminating Gulf Group’s contracts was not a\n         national security, you would have not supported that decision, would you?\n\n         A: No.\n\n       Clea Efthimiadis, a civilian Army lawyer assigned to Camp Arifjan, testified that\nCol. Miller told her that plaintiff’s latrine contract “was terminated because they couldn’t\ndo the job,” and that the contract was terminated for default based on a “repeated failure\nto perform to the statement of work.” Gulf Group’s latrine contract, however, was not\nterminated for default, which conflicts with Ms. Efthimiadis’ alleged conversation with\nCol. Miller.\n\n       Mr. Libbey, the contracting officer who supposedly reviewed all contract files\nbefore issuing his final decision, testified he thought the terminations were due to the\noverflowing latrine incident, dumpster diving, and security concerns. Mr. Libbey’s\ncontracting officer’s final decision for the latrine contract stated:\n\n         The latrine inspection revealed that the vast majority of latrines were in a\n         deplorable state of disrepair and the contractor was unsatisfactorily\n         performing the terms and conditions of the contract. Gulf Group was\n         advised of their poor performance and given an opportunity to remedy the\n         situation,147 but apparently their equipment capabilities (two waste tankers\n         with two drivers) and staff were incapable of meeting the terms of the\n         contract. At this same time, a substantial number of Gulf Group\n         employees were being barred from the base for installation security\n         infractions, which might have had a contributing affect [sic] on Gulf\n         Group’s inability to perform in an acceptable manner. Barely a week had\n         passed from the first latrine inspection when the General again summoned\n         Colonel Miller and LTC Hess to again observe the deplorable conditions of\n         the latrines.\n\n       A report prepared by counterintelligence at Camp Arifjan detailed the alleged\nsecurity incident, but at the end stated: “On 14 October, the Gulf Group General\nEnterprise [latrine] contract on Camp Arifjan was terminated by the Director of\nContracting at the request of the ASG-KU Commander, for not meeting the contractual\nobligation to clean the port-a-johns on Camp Arifjan twice per day.” As discussed\nbelow, however, the requirements of the latrine contract are conflicting with regard to\nthe cleaning requirements.\n\n147\n      There is no indication in the record that plaintiff was given any cure notices.\n\n                                              156\n\f        Mr. Libbey’s contracting officer’s final decision for the dumpster contract stated:\n“On 9 October 2004, six Gulf Group employees were detained for security violations\ninvolving traveling on Camp Arifjan without their required escort, and rummaging\nthrough a dumpster. At least four of these individuals were barred from Camp Arifjan by\nCol. Miller on 16 and 18 October 2004.” Plaintiff and its employees, however, were not\nbarred from Camp Arifjan. It was employees of Gulf Company, not Gulf Group, who\nhad been caught dumpster diving, and there was no relationship between these two\ndistinct companies. In addition, it appears that Mr. Libbey was confused about which\nGulf Group employees were issued letters of warning from the Army as a result of the\nalleged security incident involving Mohammed Al Tawash.\n\n        Mr. Peters, plaintiff’s first attorney, testified at trial that, after the terminations, he\nmet with Col. Hess, Col. Miller, Mr. Cockerham, and Tijani Saani in Kuwait and was\ngiven multiple reasons for the terminations. Mr. Peters testified that, after conversations\nwith various individuals, “[i]t was apparent to me that there were different reasons being\ngiven in meetings and/or in discussions with various people, like Colonel Brick Miller.”\nAttorney Peters further testified that Mr. Cockerham “told me a variety of things,”\nincluding that a general, whose name Mr. Peters did not recall, “had used a satellite\nlatrine portable, or attempted to use it, and it was not cleaned up. And for some reason,\non a brand new contract that had been awarded, my client was blamed for it. That was\none thing I was told. I was told other things, too.” Mr. Peters also testified that during\nhis meeting with Col. Miller, Col. Miller “mentioned” a latrine incident to Mr. Peters and\nmade statements that the plaintiff may have been allied with anti-Americans. Reflecting\non his meetings with the Army officials in Kuwait, Mr. Peters testified that:\n\n       I can only say that there were multiple reasons given [for the contract\n       terminations]. I do remember that Colonel Hess wrote a letter to the Al\n       Tawash family, not completely satisfactory, but saying that they were not a\n       problem, but it was not clear exactly what he was saying in the letter. I\n       remember that he was the contracting officer, and I wanted a General\n       grade office to write a letter so that it would have more impact, and that\n       was not forthcoming, and so I found that very questionable.\n\n        Saud Al Tawash stated he first learned about the impending terminations of the\nlatrine and dumpster contracts from competitors, including Jasmine, which indicated to\nSaud Al Tawash that the contracts would be cancelled because Gulf Group was\nallegedly anti-American and had ties to terrorist groups. According to Saud Al Tawash,\nCapt. Trimble, Capt. Novak, Lt. Rivera, and Tijani Saani all told him that there was a\nsecurity concern with Gulf Group. According to Mr. Wilson, Col. Hess told him that the\ncancellations had to do with security and counterintelligence and that the ASG\ncommander made the decision to cancel. Mr. Wilson also testified that he tried to speak\nto Col. Hess over the phone, but Col. Hess did not want to talk to him and was “really\nnervous, talking in circles.” Mr. Wilson further testified that Col. Hess stated during this\nphone call that Gulf Group’s contracts were terminated due to “counterintelligence on\nthe Al Tawash family, and they have ties [to] Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein.”\n\n\n\n                                               157\n\fAccording to notes summarizing the cancellation of Gulf Group’s contracts,148 Mr.\nWilson also heard someone comment that Gulf Group was “nothing but a bunch of kids\nand they [the Army] were going to get them out,” although he could not remember if he\nheard this from an Army officer or from one of Gulf Group’s competitors. Despite telling\nMr. Wilson, plaintiff’s Project Manager, that the Army was terminating Gulf Group’s\ncontracts for the alleged security risk, Tijani Saani, who worked in the contract office at\nCamp Arifjan, reportedly told Mr. Wilson that “we’ll try to get you guys some work....”\nMr. Wilson also stated that Col. Hess had said the Army was going to give plaintiff\nfurther work, and that either Mr. Cockerham or Capt. Novak said the same.149\n\n       It is odd that if the Army had truly considered Gulf Group a security threat,\ndefendant would have terminated plaintiff’s latrine and dumpster contracts for\nconvenience, rather than for cause, thereby allowing Gulf Group potentially to obtain\ndamages for the termination, and not barring Gulf Group from obtaining future contracts.\nNor is it likely that senior Army officials like Col. Hess would write letters to members of\nthe Al Tawash family stating, in part, “[p]lease rest assured that the Gulf Group’s\ncontract to service portable latrines at Army camps in Kuwait was not terminated\nbecause of security reasons,” if security concerns remained or were the justification for\nthe terminations.\n\n        Despite the varied reasons witnesses offered at trial for the terminations,\ndefendant would have this court believe that the Army terminated Gulf Group’s latrine\nand dumpster contracts due to the alleged security incident, which appears to have\nbeen innocent in origin, for which only a few Gulf Group employees received warning\nletters, and regarding which an investigation was never opened. Moreover, after the\nincident occurred, the Army continued to allow Gulf Group and its employees, including\nthose involved in the incident, to carry out their operations in the camp. The employees\nwho were detained for questioning were quickly released and no charges were filed\nagainst any individual or plaintiff. The individuals involved were not even asked to\nreturn for a hearing. Saud Al Tawash confirmed that neither Gulf Group nor any of Gulf\nGroup’s employees were barred from the camp because of the October 7, 2004 alleged\nsecurity incident or any other security concerns, and Gulf Group continued to perform\nwork for the United States government in the war theatre. The only consequence to\nplaintiff for the alleged security incident was that warning letters were sent to several\nGulf Group personnel on October 21, 2004. As indicated by Saud Al Tawash in his trial\n148\n    At trial, Mr. Wilson indicated that he did not prepare the summary of the notes,\nincluded as a plaintiff’s exhibit. When asked who prepared the summary he stated: “I’m\nassuming Mr. Peters.”\n149\n    It is difficult to tell from Mr. Wilson’s testimony which individual indicated the\ngovernment would provide more work for the plaintiff. Mr. Wilson stated: “Major\nCockerham was the same with me throughout the whole time. His basic stance was\nwhat happened and how this was handled was not right and that you know, they had –\nCaptain Novak had done a very good report on the company. A very nice PowerPoint\npresentation, come out, put his hands on everything and he said, we’re going to try to\nget you guys work.”\n\n                                            158\n\ftestimony, moreover, only some of the recipients of the warning letters were even\ninvolved in the alleged security incident.\n\n       Col. Portouw testified that no case was opened on the incident because “there\nwas no substance to it” and the questions of the Gulf Group employees were “innocent.”\nCol. Portouw also testified that, while incidents like this were not frequent, they were not\nuncommon, and “invariably we found that they were curiosity-generated reports and\nsimply required explaining to the employee why they shouldn’t do that.” Even Col. Hess\nand Maj. Petty testified that a map of the camp, as requested by Mohammed Al\nTawash, had it been provided at the start of performance, would have been useful. As\nto the warning letters sent to Gulf Group and the employees involved in the incident,\nCol. Miller also indicated that “[t]housands” of such letters were sent out at that point in\ntime in Kuwait and that the incident had “[n]othing to do with” the termination of plaintiff’s\ncontracts.\n\n        The incident involving Mohammed Al Tawash did not merit or receive great\nattention from the Army and was hardly substantial enough to warrant contract\ntermination actions. Moreover, Mohammed Al Tawash’s questions to determine\nlocations for the latrines appear to have been innocent and in furtherance of a legitimate\ncontract purpose. Indeed, on November 3, 2004, just sixteen days after terminating the\ncontract and less than four weeks after the alleged security incident, the Army issued a\nletter of apology, stating that Gulf Group’s latrine contract was not terminated for\nsecurity concerns. The court finds that there is no evidence in the record that Gulf\nGroup, Saud Al Tawash, or any member of the Al Tawash family had any terrorist ties\nor posed a security threat. Gulf Group has continued to do business with the United\nStates government. The alleged security incident, therefore, was an insufficient and\ndisingenuous basis for the terminations of plaintiff’s latrine and dumpster contracts.\n\n        Evidence as to a legitimate basis for terminating the latrine and dumpster\ncontracts, besides security reasons, also is lacking in the record. According to M. Sgt.\nSivert, Gulf Group did not have enough dumpsters to replace its predecessor, Future\nServices, resulting in trash appearing on the ground. At trial, M. Sgt. Sivert testified that\n“Gulf Group did not have all their dumpsters to replace the ones that Future Services\nwas taking away, and so there was a short time span that when the Future Service’s\n[sic] contract ran out, they came and got their dumpsters, and then because there was\nno dumpsters to replace them with, Food Services [sic] was actually putting some of the\ntrash and stuff on the ground, and we had to go back there and get it cleaned up after\nthey had put it on the ground.” After terminating Gulf Group’s dumpster contract, the\ngovernment awarded the services to another contractor, but required thirty-two more\ndumpsters than had been required from plaintiff. M. Sgt. Sivert explained that not all of\nthe other dumpster contracts had run out by September 30, 2004, and that both Future\nServices and Gulf Group had dumpsters on the base at Camp Arifjan. M. Sgt. Sivert\nremembered Gulf Group’s dumpsters being blue and Future Services’ dumpsters being\ngoldish brown. Saud Al Tawash, however, testified that Gulf Group’s dumpsters were\nred. Therefore, there is an additional issue as to the color of Gulf Group’s dumpsters,\nand there is testimony indicating that Gulf Group may not have been the lone contractor\n\n\n                                            159\n\fwith dumpsters in place at the time, calling into question whether Gulf Group’s\ndumpsters or another contractor’s dumpsters were overflowing. Saud Al Tawash also\ntestified that the trash may have been caused by competitors flipping over their own\ndumpsters, although there is no independent evidence in the record of other contractors\ndoing so. Megbel Al Tawash testified that, during the entire period of performance for\nthe dumpster contract, there were no complaints regarding plaintiff’s dumpster service\nat Camp Arifjan, nor did Gulf Group receive any nonconformance reports or any cure\nnotices from the government. In sum, there is in the record before the court insufficient\nevidence to prove that the trash on the ground or any other deficiencies in performance\nprompted or offered support for the terminations.\n\n        As to the allegations regarding any dirty latrines, there is conflicting evidence in\nthe record as to how many latrines were affected, the condition of the implicated\nlatrines, how often they were to be maintained, which latrines were involved, and who\nwas instructed by which employee of defendant to remedy the issue. Col. Miller\ntestified that about twenty latrines were overflowing onto the floor. Col. Miller stated that\neither Col. Hess or Col. Fugate was with him when he viewed the latrines. Col. Hess\ndid not remember any dirty latrine incident and did not recall seeing any overflowing,\nunplumbed latrines. Col. Hess testified that no one directed him to fix any dirty latrines.\nCol. Hess stated that Gulf Group was not terminated for poor performance under the\nlatrine contract.\n\n        Mr. Cockerham stated that only one latrine was not cleaned. Maj. Petty testified\nthat he inspected a group of eight to ten latrines which had “feces above the rim.” He\nstated that only one was extremely bad and unusable; the others were merely unkept.\nIn addition to Saud Al Tawash trying to explain that the latrines he provided were\nunplumbed and could not have overflowed, Megbel Al Tawash testified that Gulf\nGroup’s office received a phone call that one latrine had feces up to the brim, but it was\ncleaned that same day. Megbel Al Tawash also stated that Future Services had eight to\nten latrines in the same area near the mess hall, and Mr. Wilson stated that latrines\nfrom various companies looked the same. Maj. Petty also testified that Future Services\nstill had latrines in place when contractors Jasmine and Gulf Group first arrived.\n\n        Plaintiff argues that the contract only called for once-per-day cleaning of the\nlatrines. Indeed, the statement of work for the latrine contract states:\n\n       4.2 Cleaning. The Contractor will empty and clean each latrine daily by\n       wiping down interior walls and seat with mild disinfectant water or solution\n       (that is nonharmful to the skin and eyes) and will provide steam cleaning\n       reconditioning services once a month. The Contractor will provide all\n       materials, equipment, personnel, chemicals, and cleaning supplies to\n       include using an approved disinfectant. The Contractor will provide a\n       Material Safe Data Sheet to the COR [contracting officer’s representative]\n       for any chemicals used in this contract. The cleaning services will include\n       the following:\n\n\n\n                                            160\n\f       4.2.1 Daily. The Contractor will vacuum sewage from the basin. Debris\n       such as cans, bottles, rags, sticks, etc. will be removed from the waste\n       tank, collected and hauled away for proper disposal. No debris will be\n       allowed to contaminate the outside area around the chemical latrine. The\n       Contractor will be responsible for cleanup of any spills. After all sewage\n       and debris have been removed the Contractor will wash the toilet seat,\n       urinal, and adjacent area around the toilet seat with the approved cleaning\n       solution and remove all built up dirt and waste by scrubbing with a nylon\n       hand brush. The Contractor will fill the empty basin with a mixture of two\n       (2) cups disinfectant solution and ten (10) gallons fresh water. The\n       Contractor will refill toilet paper dispensers and hand sanitation gel\n       dispensers. The Contractor will leave the area in and around the latrines\n       in a sanitary state.\n\n(emphasis in original). At the end of the same section, however, the contract states,\n“[t]he vendor must use NEW Latrines and must take into consideration that they are\nbidding on the daily servicing of the latrines also latrines must be checked and cleaned\ntwice a day.” (emphasis in original).\n\n        According to Maj. Petty, servicing latrines once a day would have been sufficient.\nCol. Hess, however, stated that where latrines are located in high-traffic areas, like the\nmess hall or headquarters, a once-a-day service requirement may set a contractor up\nfor failure as these latrines need to be serviced twice per day. Steven Perry, a former\nArmy Colonel, and plaintiff’s expert on the issue of Army contracting and standard\npractices and procedures for Army contracting, testified that faulty specifications may\nhave been the cause of unclean latrines if the government had not anticipated the\nextent of usage. Mr. Perry also stated that, if bottles of water were found in a latrine, as\nsuggested in some of the testimony to the court, it would be the end user’s fault, not the\ncontractor’s. Mr. Perry indicated that latrine contracts can be difficult to manage,\nalthough Col. Hess and Maj. Petty disagreed.\n\n        Therefore, if the latrine incident was the only basis for the termination of the\nlatrine contract, especially without issuance of a cure notice, it appears to have been an\ninsufficient basis for termination of the latrine contract. There is conflicting evidence as\nto how many latrines were dirty, the extent of the uncleanliness, whether Gulf Group’s\nlatrines were the ones at issue, and whether Gulf Group was informed of any problems.\nMoreover, if, as suggested, plaintiff was responsive to a request to clean, there was an\ninsufficient basis to terminate the plaintiff’s latrine contract, particularly given that the\nspecifications were conflicting. Moreover, Col. Hess testified that a contractor missing a\ngroup of latrines during servicing was not uncommon and did not warrant termination for\ndefault. Col. Hess further stated that his contracting office did not have performance\nproblems with Gulf Group, and its latrine contract was not terminated for failure to meet\nits contractual obligations on the latrine contract. At the time the government terminated\nthe latrine contract, the Army continued to need the services and had the funds to pay.\nIn fact, the joint stipulation of facts submitted to the court by both parties states that,“[a]ll\nor part of the services that were initially awarded to Gulf Group under [the latrine\n\n\n                                              161\n\fcontract] was awarded to another Government contractor, Jasmine International\nTrading & Service Company.” Following termination of plaintiff’s latrine contract, the\ngovernment placed orders with Gulf Group for latrines at other locations, indicating that\nthe Army believed in Gulf Group’s ability to supply latrines and to service them.\n\n        In plaintiff’s second amended complaint for the latrine case, plaintiff alleges:\n\n        As a result of the Government’s arbitrary and wrongful termination of the\n        contract, Gulf Group is entitled to damages in the form of preparatory\n        expenses of KWD 25,757.137, equivalent to $91,978.74 calculated at the\n        exchange rate of 1 KWD @ U.S. $3.571, fees and costs incurred in the\n        preparation and presentation of a termination claim and settlement\n        proposal that was presented to the Contracting Officer in the sum of\n        $13,887.50, in addition to lost profits of KWD 763,034.432 equivalent to\n        $2,724,795.96 calculated at the exchange rate of 1 KWD @ U.S. $3.571,\n        for a grand total of $2,830,662.20 in damages plus prejudgment interest\n        under the Contract Dispute [sic] Act, 41 U.S.C. §611, the specific sum of\n        which will be proven at the time of trial.150\n\n(emphasis in original) (internal citations omitted). Plaintiff further alleges that “[o]n May\n21, 2007 the Contracting Officer Joe L. Libbey of the U.S. Army Contracting Agency for\nSouthwest Asia - Kuwait issued a final decision in which it granted in part and denied in\npart Gulf Group’s claim for damages, awarding compensation in the amount of\n$149,285.71 plus interest. Gulf Group disputes the computation of the award made by\nthe Contracting Officer seeks additional compensation be awarded by this Court for its\ndamages that were denied all as it will be shown at the time of trial.” (emphasis in\noriginal) (internal citation omitted).\n\n        In plaintiff’s second amended complaint for the dumpster case, plaintiff alleges\nthat:\n\n        As a result of the Government’s arbitrary and wrongful termination of the\n        contract, Gulf Group is entitled to damages in the form of preparatory\n        expenses of KWD 79,213.585,151 equivalent to $282,871.71 calculated at\n        the exchange rate of 1 KWD @ U.S. $3.571, fees and costs incurred in\n        the preparation and presentation of a termination claim and settlement\n        proposal that was presented to the Contracting Officer in the sum of\n150\n    Plaintiff also alleges that, “[t]he Government’s termination of this [latrine] contract\nwas arbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion. Indeed, termination was in bad\nfaith inasmuch as the purported basis for termination was a supposed security risk\npresented by Gulf Group that was not documented prior to, at the time of or any time\nsubsequent to termination.” As indicated above, plaintiff has abandoned any allegations\nof bad faith.\n151\n   Plaintiff’s 2011 notice subsequently reduced the amount of costs plaintiff claimed to\nhave incurred to 59,927.871 KD.\n\n                                             162\n\f       $13,837.50, in addition to lost profits of KWD 135,346.518 equivalent to\n       $483,322.42 calculated at the exchange rate of 1 KWD @ U.S. $3.571, for\n       a grand total of $780,131.63 in damages plus prejudgment interest under\n       the Contract Dispute [sic] Act, 41 U.S.C. §611, the specific sum of which\n       will be proven at the time of trial.152\n\n(internal citations omitted; emphasis in original). Plaintiff further alleges that “[o]n May\n21, 2007 the Contracting Officer Joe L. Libbey of the U.S. Army Contracting Agency for\nSouthwest Asia – Kuwait, issued a final decision in which he granted in part and denied\nin part Gulf Group’s claim for damages, awarding compensation in the amount of\n$57,833.00 plus interest. Gulf Group seeks additional compensation be awarded by this\nCourt for its damages that were denied all as it will be shown at the time of trial.”\n(emphasis in original) (internal citation omitted).\n\n      Proof that a contract terminated for convenience was an abuse of discretion\nrenders that contract breached. See Krygoski Constr. Co. v. United States, 94 F.3d at\n1541; see also NCLN20, Inc. v. United States, 99 Fed. Cl. at 758. Therefore, the Army\nbreached the latrine and dumpster contracts by improperly terminating them. The\nRestatement (Second) of Contracts provides, with respect to plaintiff’s burden to prove\ndamages:\n\n       A party cannot recover damages for breach of a contract for loss beyond\n       the amount that the evidence permits to be established with reasonable\n       certainty.... Courts have traditionally required greater certainty in the proof\n       of damages for a breach of a contract than in the proof of damages for a\n       tort. The requirement does not mean, however, that the injured party is\n       barred from recovery unless he establishes the total amount of his [or her]\n       loss. It merely excludes those elements of loss that cannot be proved with\n       reasonable certainty.\n\nRestatement (Second) of Contracts § 352 cmt. a (1981). Although there may be\nuncertainty “‘as to the extent of the damage,’” a court cannot avoid its obligation to\nprovide relief when there is no uncertainty “‘as to the fact of damage.’” See S.W. Elecs.\n& Mfg. Corp. v. United States, 228 Ct. Cl. 333, 351, 655 F.2d 1078, 1088 (1981)\n(quoting Joseph Pickard’s Sons Co. v. United States, 209 Ct. Cl. 643, 650, 532 F.2d\n739, 743 (1976)). “In cases where the responsibility for damage is clear…‘it is enough if\nthe evidence adduced is sufficient to enable a court or jury to make a fair and\nreasonable approximation.’” See Hughes Commc’ns Galaxy, Inc. v. United States, 47\nFed. Cl. 236, 239 (2000) (quoting S.W. Elecs. & Mfg. Corp. v. United States, 228 Ct. Cl.\nat 351, 655 F.2d at 1088 (citation omitted)); see also Bluebonnet Sav. Bank, F.S.B. v.\n152\n    Plaintiff also alleges that “[t]he Government’s termination of this [dumpster] contract\nwas arbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion. Indeed, termination was in bad\nfaith inasmuch as the purported basis for termination was a supposed security risk\npresented by Gulf Group that was not documented prior to, at the time of or any time\nsubsequent to termination.” As indicated above, plaintiff has abandoned any allegations\nof bad faith.\n\n                                            163\n\fUnited States, 266 F.3d 1348, 1355 (Fed. Cir.) (“The ascertainment of damages is not\nan exact science, and where responsibility for damage is clear, it is not essential that\nthe amount thereof be ascertainable with absolute exactness or mathematical precision:\n‘“It is enough if the evidence adduced is sufficient to enable a court or jury to make a fair\nand reasonable approximation.”’” (quoting Elec. & Missile Facilities, Inc. v. United\nStates, 189 Ct. Cl. 237, 257, 416 F.2d 1345, 1358 (1969) (quoting Specialty Assembling\n& Packing Co. v. United States, 174 Ct. Cl. 153, 183, 355 F.2d 554, 572 (1966)))), reh’g\ndenied (Fed. Cir. 2001). In addition, “‘[i]f a reasonable probability of damage can be\nclearly established, uncertainty as to the amount will not preclude recovery,’ and the\ncourt’s duty is to ‘make a fair and reasonable approximation of the damages.’” Id.\n(quoting Ace–Federal Reporters, Inc. v. Barram, 226 F.3d 1329, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2000)\n(citation omitted)); see also Marquardt Co. v. United States, 101 Fed. Cl. 265, 269\n(2011). In situations in which the plaintiff seeks to recover costs that have been\nincurred, the plaintiff must demonstrate with reasonable certainty that the costs are\nrecoverable. See Ariz. Pub. Serv. Co. v. United States, 93 Fed. Cl. 384, 390 (2010)\n(“Plaintiff alleges overhead of $577,934 in connection with its efforts to mitigate\ndamages, and $357,013 for its cost of funds used…. These costs of funds and\noverhead are real, and we have no doubt that plaintiff spent the amounts claimed for the\npurposes stated. However, such costs must be established according to the standards\nand burdens described in this Opinion. Plaintiff did not show to a degree of reasonable\ncertainty that those costs could be tied directly to its mitigation efforts.”).\n\n        Plaintiff’s citations to cases supporting that lost profits could have included the\noption periods rely on situations in which the wronged contractor can prove that the\ngovernment chose, in bad faith, not to exercise the option periods. See Hi-Shear Tech.\nCorp. v. United States, 356 F.3d at 1374, 1375, 1380; Blackstone Consulting, Inc. v.\nGen. Servs. Admin., CBCA 718, 08-1 BCA ¶ 33,770; Greenlee Constr., Inc. v. Gen.\nServs. Admin., CBCA 416, 07-1 BCA ¶ 33,514. As the court determined above,\nhowever, there is no evidence that, had the latrine and dumpster contracts not been\nterminated, the government would have exercised the option periods, or would have not\nexercised them in bad faith or as a result of an abuse of discretion. Given that the\nlatrine and dumpster contracts were terminated in the course of performance of the\nbase period, and that the government is not obligated to exercise an option that is not\notherwise restricted, plaintiff cannot claim entitlement to compensation for unexercised\noption periods. See Gov’t Sys. Advisors, Inc. v. United States, 847 F.2d at 813 (“An\noption is normally an option, and nothing in [the provision at issue], or in any other\ncontract clause, limited the circumstances under which the government could decline to\nexercise that bargained-for right in this case.”).          In Marketing & Management\nInformation, Inc. v. United States, the plaintiff argued that it was entitled to damages\nrelating to two, one-year option periods because, according to the plaintiff, it was\nforeseeable that the options would have been exercised had the underlying contract not\nbeen breached. See Mktg. & Mgmt. Info., Inc. v. United States, 62 Fed. Cl. 126, 130\n(2004). Noting that, “where a contract is renewable solely at the option of the\ngovernment, the government is under no obligation to exercise the option,” the court\nconcluded that “breach damages for the two option years would be inherently\nspeculative.” See id. (citing Gov’t Sys. Advisors, Inc. v. United States, 847 F.2d at 813).\n\n\n                                            164\n\fThe court reasoned that an award of damages for lost profits relating to two option\nyears that the government was free to exercise would put the plaintiff in a better position\nthan had the breach never occurred. See Mktg. & Mgmt. Info., Inc. v. United States, 62\nFed. Cl. at 131. Although a claim that the government failed to exercise an option in\nbad faith, or as the result of an abuse of discretion, may entitle a plaintiff to relief, the\nabuse of discretion in the latrine and dumpster cases is linked to the underlying\ncontracts at issue, not the government’s option to extend those contracts. In\ncircumstances where the government breaches an underlying contract, especially when\nthe breach occurs early in the performance of the contract, an abuse of discretion giving\nrise to that breach generally only entitles a plaintiff to damages relating to the base year\nof the contract. See Sci. & Comm. Sys. Corp. v. Tessada Assocs., Inc., No. 1:11–cv–\n1278, 2012 WL 3866497, at *2 (E.D. Va. Aug. 30, 2012); E. Coast Res., LLC v. Town of\nHempstead, 707 F. Supp. 2d 401, 409–10 (E.D.N.Y.), recons. denied (E.D.N.Y. 2010).\n\n        As with the camp package BPA claim, the task before the court of determining to\nwhat, if any, additional compensation plaintiff is entitled for the latrine and dumpster\nclaims, lost profits notwithstanding, is made more difficult by the numerous and varying\nclaim amounts submitted to Mr. Libbey in the form of certified claims, and to this court in\nthe form of the complaints and the amended complaints. As noted above, plaintiff has\nsought various amounts for recovery on the latrine and dumpster contract claims. In its\n2005 Claim and Settlement Offer to Mr. Cockerham for the latrine contract, plaintiff\nclaimed entitlement to $5,058,428.59, and submitted a “settlement offer of\n$4,558,428.60.” In its 2007 certified claim for the latrine contract, plaintiff claimed\n$6,000,000.00. Likewise in its original complaint in Case No. 06-858C, the latrine case,\nplaintiff sought $6,000,000.00. In its first amended complaint in the latrine case, plaintiff\nsought 1,572,967.611 KD.153 In its second amended complaint in the latrine case,\nplaintiff now seeks $2,830,662.20.154 In its 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer to Mr.\nCockerham for the dumpster contract, plaintiff claimed entitlement to $1,110,621.72,\nand submitted a “settlement offer of $999,994.67.” In its 2007 certified claim for the\ndumpster contract, plaintiff claimed $1,800,000.00. In its original complaint in Case No.\n06-853C, the dumpster case, plaintiff also sought $1,800,000.00. In its first amended\ncomplaint in the dumpster case, plaintiff sought $1,946,721.78.155 In its second\namended complaint in the dumpster case, plaintiff now seeks $780,031.63.156\n153\n    Plaintiff sought 1,416,360.000 KD in lost profits, 156,607.611 KD in preparatory\nexpenses, legal fees, costs incurred in preparing a settlement of plaintiff’s claims, and\ninterest. Plaintiff did not convert the amounts to USD.\n154\n      Plaintiff now seeks $2,724,795.96 in lost profits, $91,978.74 in preparatory\nexpenses, $13,887.50 in fees and other costs, plus prejudgment interest, costs of\nlitigation and attorneys’ fees.\n155\n   Plaintiff sought $1,457,619.72 in lost profits, $489,102.06 in preparatory expenses,\nlegal fees, costs incurred in preparing the settlement of the claims, and interest.\n156\n   Plaintiff asserts in its second amended complaint in the dumpster case that it seeks\n$780,131.63, but the total of the various amounts listed by plaintiff is only $780,031.63.\n\n                                            165\n\f         As indicated above, the majority of the testimony at trial addressed the award of\nthe contracts, the alleged security incident, the hiring of Ms. Blake, Saud Al Tawash’s\nrelationship with Mr. Cockerham, and the inflated claims. Little testimony at trial\nspecifically addressed the denied elements of Gulf Group’s 2007 latrine contract and\ndumpster contract claims before Mr. Libbey. Moreover, plaintiff’s exhibits at trial on the\ncosts Gulf Group incurred in performing the latrine contract for a brief period of time\nincluded only a handful of unclear charts, spreadsheets, and a handful of invoices or\nrecords. In addition, only a small number of the joint exhibits offer any support for the\nspecific claims after the contracting officer’s final decision on the latrine contract claim.\nThe most specific information is included in the 2011 notice for the latrine case, in which\nplaintiff indicates: “Pursuant to the Court’s Order dated December 9, 2010, Gulf Group\nGeneral Enterprises, Co. W.L.L. hereby submits its revised claim together with\nsupporting documents and an explanation of the reasons for the revisions.” The 2011\nnotice for the latrine claim, included as a joint exhibit at trial, included a chart similar to\nthe one included for the 2011 notice for the camp package BPA claim. The chart for the\nlatrine contract claim listed thirty-three individual claims, reducing the revised amount\nfor thirteen claims, removing eight individual claims, listing no change for nine individual\nclaims, and submitting three entirely new claims. Plaintiff included the identical forms,\npurchase orders, checks, and invoices included in the original 2005 Claim and\nSettlement Offer to Mr. Cockerham with the 2011 notice.\n\n        Plaintiff also did not identify the differences in its costs in the 2011 notice for the\nlatrine claim and the second amended complaint on the latrine contract from the\namounts awarded by Mr. Libbey in his May 21, 2007 contracting officer’s final decision.\nIn his contracting officer’s final decision on the latrine contract claim, Mr. Libbey wrote:\n\n       I determine Gulf Group is entitled to one month of contract performance.\n       Actual performance was less than one month, but I believe Gulf Group\n       incurred costs on at least a monthly basis; therefore, a full month of\n       contract performance represents the percentage of the contract performed\n       before contract termination. Gulf Group is entitled to $149,285.71, for one\n       month’s performance plus interest. I believe this [sic] a fair and\n       reasonable settlement.\n\nIn a footnote, Mr. Libbey stated: “This amount is one month of service for 400 latrines as\nproposed by Gulf Group and is not the erroneous amount noted in footnote 1 above.”\nMr. Libbey appears to have misinterpreted the price of the contract by not relying on the\nprice as it appears in the contract in reaching his decision on the latrine contract.\nPlaintiff did not make an effort to segregate what, according to Mr. Libbey, would have\nbeen covered by one month’s worth of performance, $149,285.71, instead claiming\n\n\n\nPlaintiff seeks $483,322.42 in lost profits, $282,871.71 for preparatory expenses,\n$13,837.50 for fees and other costs, prejudgment interest, costs of litigation and\nattorneys’ fees.\n\n                                             166\n\f$91,978.736.157 Moreover, plaintiff did not draw a nexus between each of the revised\nclaim amounts and the supporting documentation attached to the claim.\n\n       The testimony at trial by Saud Al Tawash also did not specifically link any of the\nclaimed amounts to actual, documented expenditures by Gulf Group made in\nconnection with preparing to perform the latrine contract. For example, on cross\nexamination, regarding the purchase of latrines referred to in the 2011 second revised\nclaim, and included as supporting documentation attached to that claim, Saud Al\nTawash testified:\n\n      Q: This is the Joint Exhibit 85 which is the revised claim with regard to the\n      latrines which was filed with the court in January of this year?\n\n      A: Yes. sir.\n\n      Q: This reduces the amount of latrines purchased?\n\n      A: Yes, fir [sic]. From 600 to 400 latrines.\n\n      Q: Reducing the amount from the initial claim column from 52,000 dinars\n      to 37,000 dinars?\n\n      A: Reducing the preparatory expenses from the summary of the initial-\n      claim to this revision.\n\n      Q: On the second page, page 1878, you also reduced the –\n\n      A: The adjustment like air freight, custom duty, freight forwarding charges.\n      Based on a pro rata. They took the amount of the invoice of 600, they\n      prorated it on 400 and they submitted those bills in here, sir.\n\n      Q: At the bottom of this the amount is reduced from – There’s mitigation\n      again?\n\n      A: Yes. We were able to sell a lot of these latrines, not all of them, we still\n      have some stuck in Kuwait, but we sold a lot of them and we almost got\n      the full value, remarkably, from the sale of them. And this, I think if I add it\n      up I think we got close to 78,000 KD. That’s quarter million dollars worth\n      of mitigation efforts. We put ads in paper and sold them. These latrines\n      are very hard to sell in Kuwait because they’re spec’d out for military in\n      that region of the world. We had issues trying to sell them, but we were\n      lucky that we have been able to get this in the mitigation effort.\n\n\n\n157\n   Plaintiff’s 2011 notice for the latrine claim rounded to three decimal places in\nconverting between Kuwaiti dinars and United States dollars.\n\n                                            167\n\f       This testimony was representative of Saud Al Tawash’s testimony on the specific\nclaims on the latrine contract. As noted above, Saud Al Tawash was able to note the\ndifference in the amount of certain items from the original claims and the 2011 notices,\nbut was not able to offer support for the costs alleged. Instead, the testimony was often\na recitation of the items listed in the 2011 notice for the latrine claim, rather than a\nsubstantiation of the supporting documents. Moreover, a large portion of Saud Al\nTawash’s testimony regarding the specific claims on the latrine and dumpster contracts\nwas driven by explaining why Gulf Group, Saud Al Tawash as the General Manager of\nGulf Group, and Gulf Group’s attorneys submitted the particular claims filed and\ncomplaints filed.\n\n        Like the camp package BPA claim, however, defendant appears to have\nconceded that plaintiff incurred all of the costs that plaintiff identified in its 2011 notice in\nits performance for the latrine contract. Defendant stipulated that “Gulf Group\npurchased a total of 600 latrines, 400 of which were for use in the performance of\nContract No. W912-D1-04-P-0932.” Defendant also stated in post-trial brief that Gulf\nGroup actually incurred costs in the amount of 94,047.000 KD in its performance of the\nlatrine contract, which was well above the 25,757.137 KD that plaintiff claimed to have\nincurred in its 2011 notice. Defendant apparently treated the approximate costs that\nplaintiff deducted as a result of its mitigation efforts as costs that plaintiff incurred in its\nperformance of the contract. Defendant also did not demonstrate that plaintiff failed to\nadequately mitigate its costs. See Koby v. United States, 53 Fed. Cl. 493, 497 (2002)\n(citations omitted). In fact, the record indicates that plaintiff made efforts to mitigate its\ncosts. Defendant’s failure to rebut plaintiff’s claims with respect to the costs plaintiff\nincurred in its performance of the latrine contract is problematic.\n\n        Similarly, because little testimony at trial specifically addressed the denied\nelements of Gulf Group’s 2007 dumpster claim, and because plaintiff’s trial exhibits on\nthe costs it incurred in performing the dumpster contract for a brief period of time\nincluded only a small number of unclear charts, spreadsheets, and a handful of invoices\nor records, and only one or two of the joint exhibits offer any support for the specific\nclaims after the contracting officer’s final decision on the dumpster contract claim, the\nmost specific, relevant information may come from the 2011 notice on the dumpster\nclaim. In the 2011 notice of filing of revised claims, plaintiff indicates: “Gulf Group\nGeneral Enterprises, Co. W.L.L. hereby submits its revised claim together with\nsupporting documents and an explanation of the reasons for the revisions.” The 2011\nnotice for the dumpster contract, included as a joint exhibit at trial, contained a chart\nsimilar to the 2011 notices for the camp package BPA and latrine claims. The chart for\nthe dumpster claim listed nineteen individual claims, removing one claim, reducing the\nrevised amount for five claims, listing no change for four individual claims, and\nsubmitting nine entirely new individual claims. Plaintiff included the identical forms,\npurchase orders, checks, and invoices included in the original 2005 Claim and\nSettlement Offer to Mr. Cockerham with the 2011 notice.158 Plaintiff also did not identify\nthe differences in its costs in the 2011 notice and the second amended complaint for the\n158\n   Plaintiff’s 2011 notice also included summaries of payments to various employees\nnot included in the original claim.\n\n                                              168\n\fdumpster contract from the amounts awarded by Mr. Libbey in its May 21, 2007\ncontracting officer’s final decision.\n\n      In his contracting officer’s final decision on the dumpster contract claims, Mr.\nLibbey wrote:\n\n      I determine Gulf Group is entitled to one month of contract performance.\n      Actual performance was less than one month, but I believe Gulf Group\n      incurred costs on at least a monthly basis; therefore, a full month of\n      contract performance represents the percentage of the contract performed\n      before contract termination. Gulf Group is entitled to $57,833.00, for one\n      month’s performance plus interest. I believe this [sic] a fair and\n      reasonable settlement.\n\nPlaintiff did not make an effort to segregate what, according to Mr. Libbey, would have\nbeen covered by one month’s worth of performance, the $57,833.00, instead claiming\n$214,002.427.159 Moreover, as with the latrine contract claim, plaintiff was unable to\ndraw a nexus between each of the revised claim amounts and the supporting\ndocumentation attached to the claim. Testimony at trial by Saud Al Tawash also did not\nspecifically link any of the claimed amounts to actual, documented expenditures by Gulf\nGroup. For example, on direct examination regarding the purchase of compactors\nreferred to in the 2011 notice, and included as supporting documentation attached to\nthat notice, Saud Al Tawash testified:\n\n      Q: What is this document that we see on page 1116 [an exhibit attached\n      to plaintiff’s 2011 notice on the dumpster contract claim]?\n\n      A: This is the company that does the steel fabrications called Malika\n      Factory Steel Works. They manufacture dumpsters, and they’re what we\n      call in the industry body builder.\n\n      Q: Okay. And are they invoicing you for any particular equipment,\n      service? What is this for?\n\n      A: Yeah, this is the garbage compactor maintenance. The referred the\n      hydraulics, change hoses oil seals, jacks. This is just an invoice for the\n      garbage compactor to be installed on the trucks.\n\n      Q: And was this a used compactor or a new compactor? Why did it need\n      service?\n\n      A: Because we bought used compactors. They’re international trucks, and\n      they were the type of trucks that were approved to be used for this\n\n159\n    Plaintiff’s 2011 notice for the dumpster contract claim rounded to three decimal\nplaces in converting between Kuwaiti dinars and United States dollars.\n\n                                         169\n\f       contract. They’re American trucks, and they had American compactors\n       manufactured by Hill Industries.\n\nThis was the sum-total of the testimony on the compactors by Saud Al Tawash, who\noffered the most in-depth testimony on the specific dumpster claims. For the next item\non the 2011 notice, the red 20-cubic meter dumpsters, the entirety of Saud Al Tawash’s\ntestimony was:\n\n       Q: All right, so turn to the next page 1118 [an exhibit attached to plaintiff’s\n       2011 notice on the dumpster contract claim]. If you can tell us, what is\n       this?\n\n       A: This is an invoice for the 20-cubic meter dumpsters painted in red\n       which is the Gulf Group identity. Every contractor had a different color like\n       some of them are blue. Some of the other contractors have yellow. Our\n       color was red for Gulf Group, and the Malika that has manufactured the\n       dumpsters for us and painted them in the red color. And the first line item\n       is for the dumpsters. The second line item is for six-cubic meter\n       dumpsters, 230. And the third line item is the hooks for the trucks for roll\n       on, roll off. These are the mechanical mechanism that we installed on the\n       chassis truck to haul away the 20-cubic meter dumpster.\n\n       Q: And is this an invoice for the purchase of these items that Gulf Group\n       made?\n\n       A: Yes ma’am.\n\n       Q: All right.\n\n        As with the camp package BPA claim and the latrine claim, however, the\ngovernment appears to have conceded that plaintiff incurred all of the costs that plaintiff\nidentified in its 2011 notice regarding its performance of the dumpster contract.\nDefendant stipulated, for example, that “Gulf Group paid Abdul Hameed Salem (‘AHS’)\n12,000 kd for the service to the 6cm dumpsters and 990 kd for the service to the 20 cm\ndumpsters by its subcontractor in the performance of Contract No. W912DI-04-P-0897.”\nDefendant also stated in its post-trial brief that Gulf Group actually incurred costs in the\namount of 80,467.871 KD in its performance of the dumpster contract, which was well\nabove the 59,927.871 KD that plaintiff claimed to have incurred in its 2011 notice.\nDefendant apparently treated 68,910.000 KD of costs that plaintiff deducted as a result\nof its mitigation efforts as costs that plaintiff incurred in its performance of the contract.\nDefendant also did not demonstrate that plaintiff failed to adequately mitigate its costs.\nSee Koby v. United States, 53 Fed. Cl. at 497 (citations omitted).\n\n       In contrast to Gulf Group’s minimal effort to prove the amount of costs it incurred\nin performance of the latrine and dumpster contracts, Gulf Group has presented the\ncourt with a more understandable and complete explanation of its lost profits claims with\n\n\n                                            170\n\frespect to the latrine and dumpster contracts. As noted above, it is the obligation of the\ncourt to find recovery for a party who has suffered a breach if the measure of damages\ncan be reasonably certain. See AmBase Corp. v. United States, 100 Fed. Cl. 548, 572\n(2011). When a plaintiff seeks expectancy damages, like lost profits, the plaintiff must\npresent the court with sufficient “record evidence” to “perform the necessary comparison\nbetween the breach and non-breach worlds.” See Yankee Atomic Elec. Co. v. United\nStates, 536 F.3d 1268, 1273 (Fed. Cir. 2008); see also Stockton E. Water Dist. v.\nUnited States, 109 Fed. Cl. 760, 785 (2013); Stockton E. Water Dist. v. United States,\n109 Fed. Cl. 460, 485 (2013). “To recover lost profits for breach of contract, the plaintiff\nmust establish by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) the lost profits were\nreasonably foreseeable or actually foreseen by the breaching party at the time of\ncontracting; (2) the loss of profits was caused by the breach; and (3) the amount of the\nlost profits has been established with reasonable certainty.” Anchor Sav. Bank, FSB v.\nUnited States, 597 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (citations omitted).\n\n       Lost profits are legally foreseeable only if, at the time that the contract was\n       entered into, (1) the loss was natural and inevitable upon the breach so\n       that the defaulting party may be presumed from all the circumstances to\n       have foreseen it; or (2) if the breach resulted in lost profits because of\n       some special circumstances, those circumstances must have been known\n       to the defaulting party at the time the contract was entered into.\n\nSee Precision Pine & Timber, Inc. v. United States, 72 Fed. Cl. 460, 480 (2006) (citing\nChain Belt Co. v. United States, 127 Ct. Cl. 38, 58, 115 F. Supp. 701, 714 (1953)),\nrecons., 81 Fed. Cl. 235 (2007), and recons. in part, 81 Fed.

The breaching party is not required to\nbe absolutely certain that the non-breaching party would suffer the damages at issue as\na result of the breach. See Restatement (Second) Contracts § 351 cmt. a (“It is\nenough, however, that the loss was foreseeable as a probable, as distinguished from a\nnecessary, result of his [or her] breach.”). In contrast, “the causal connection between\nthe breach and the loss of profits must be ‘definitely established.’” See Cal. Fed. Bank\nv. United States, 395 F.3d 1263, 1268 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citations omitted). When\nanalyzing anticipatory profit, however, “it must be ‘definitely established’ that without the\ngovernment’s breach there would have been a profit.” See Hi-Shear Tech. Corp. v.\nUnited States, 356 F.3d at 1379 (quoting Cal. Fed. Bank, FSB v. United States, 245\nF.3d 1342, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1113 (2002)). “‘Certainty [of\ndamages] is sufficient if the evidence adduced enables the court to make a fair and\nreasonable approximation of the damages,’” which permits the court to examine\n“‘probable and inferential as well as direct and positive proof.’” Energy Capital Corp. v.\nUnited States, 302 F.3d 1314, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (quoting Locke v. United States,\n141 Ct. Cl. 262, 267–68, 283 F.2d 521, 524 (1960)), reh’g denied (Fed. Cir. 2002)\n(alteration in original). If a plaintiff presents enough proof to allow a court to make a fair\nand reasonable approximation of damages, a defendant’s reliance on cross-\nexamination to attack the credibility of witnesses while offering “no evidence to counter\nPlaintiff’s testimony and exhibits” may not be sufficient to rebut the plaintiff’s\n\n\n                                            171\n\fdemonstration of an entitlement to expectancy damages. See Richmond Am. Homes of\nColo., Inc. v. United States, 80 Fed. Cl. 656, 662 (2008), appeal dismissed, 352 F.\nApp’x 421 (Fed. Cir. 2009). Expert testimony cannot demonstrate reasonable certainty\nof damages without “‘an adequate foundation in the facts of the case.’” See First Fed.\nLincoln Bank v. United States, 518 F.3d 1308, 1320 (Fed. Cir.) (quoting Genmoora\nCorp. v. Moore Bus. Forms, Inc., 939 F.2d 1149, 1157 (5th Cir.), reh’g (5th Cir.), and\nmandate clarified (5th Cir. 1991)), reh’g and reh’g en banc denied (Fed. Cir. 2008).\nExpert testimony, however, is a viable means of establishing lost profits with reasonable\ncertainty if supported by the evidence. See Energy Capital Corp. v. United States, 302\nF.3d at 1327 (citations omitted) (citing decisions that affirmed the award of lost profits\nfor new ventures based on expert testimony). With respect to anticipatory lost profits,\njudges have “considerable leeway” in determining the reliability of an expert’s testimony.\nSee Loeffel Steel Prods., Inc. v. Delta Brands, Inc., 387 F. Supp. 2d 794, 803 n.7 (N.D.\nIll. 2005) (citation omitted).\n\n         Although a termination for convenience generally does not entitle a contractor to\nanticipatory profits, a termination for convenience “tainted by bad faith or an abuse of\ncontracting discretion,” Krygoski Constr. Co. v. United States, 94 F.3d at 1541, which\namounts to a breach of contract, may entitle a plaintiff to expectancy damages. Id. at\n1545. In support of its claims for lost profits, plaintiff offered the testimony of Terry\nCarlson, qualified as an expert in government contract accounting, with experience\nworking for the Defense Contract Audit Agency, as well as for private companies. Mr.\nCarlson testified that he had reviewed a spreadsheet prepared by Gulf Group’s\naccounting department, which delineated the amount Gulf Group was to receive under\nthe latrine and dumpster contracts, line items for each cost that Gulf Group expected to\nincur in performing the latrine and dumpster contracts, as well as Gulf Group’s expected\nprofit over the base periods and each option period for the latrine and dumpster\ncontracts. Mr. Carlson also reviewed the latrine and dumpster contracts, schedules\nprepared by Gulf Group, depositions that were taken in the above-captioned cases, Gulf\nGroup’s claims to the contracting officer, as well as its complaints, and the contracting\nofficer’s findings with respect to the termination of the latrine and dumpster contracts.\nPlaintiff’s expert testified that he suggested changes to Gulf Group’s lost profits\ncalculation, including the correction of errors in plaintiff’s initial calculation of its\nexpenses. In helping plaintiff to revise its initial calculation of lost profits, plaintiff’s\nexpert testified that he also reviewed available documentation of projected expenses.\nMr. Carlson testified that he accounted for deficiencies in plaintiff’s accounting system\nby individually reviewing invoices in support of each cost listed by plaintiff. Plaintiff’s\nexpert also testified that plaintiff had properly calculated the depreciation of plaintiff’s\nassets. Although plaintiff’s expert testified that business practices in Kuwait prevented\nhim from calculating depreciation in a traditional manner, he counseled plaintiff and\nSaud Al Tawash on calculating depreciation of assets based on “a reasonable useful\nlife” of the assets at issue. After reviewing plaintiff’s documentation, and accounting for\ndeficiencies in plaintiff’s accounting system, plaintiff’s expert testified that he was\nreasonably certain that plaintiff’s final lost profits calculation was accurate. Plaintiff’s\nexpert ultimately concluded that the spreadsheet prepared by Gulf Group reflected “the\ndifference between the revenue that they expected and the expected costs to perform,”\n\n\n                                            172\n\fwhich amounted to “the profit that they would have incurred had they been allowed to\nperform the contract as they had planned.”160\n\n        On cross-examination, defendant primarily highlighted that Mr. Carlson had relied\non discussions with Saud Al Tawash and an individual from Gulf Group’s accounting\ndepartment to determine a reasonable approximation for the useful life of Gulf Group’s\nassets, that plaintiff’s expert mostly reviewed invoices, rather than cancelled checks to\ndetermine plaintiff’s projected costs, and plaintiff’s asserted entitlement to compensation\nrelating to option periods not exercised by the government. Although defendant had\nindicated to the court that it intended to call a certified public accountant in response to\nplaintiff’s expert, after hearing the testimony presented by plaintiff’s expert, Mr. Carlson,\ndefendant informed the court that it did not “need” to present expert testimony related to\nplaintiff’s lost profits calculation.\n\n        As indicated above, the court disagrees with plaintiff’s expert, Mr. Carlson, that\nplaintiff is entitled to lost profits for each unexercised option period, but plaintiff has\nestablished that defendant is liable for damages arising out of its breach of contract\nduring the base period of the latrine and dumpster contracts. See Krygoski Constr. Co.\nv. United States, 94 F.3d at 1541, 1545. “In cases where the responsibility for damage\nis clear…‘it is enough if the evidence adduced is sufficient to enable a court or jury to\nmake a fair and reasonable approximation.’” See Hughes Commc’ns Galaxy, Inc. v.\nUnited States, 47 Fed. Cl. at 239 (quoting S.W. Elecs. & Mfg. Corp. v. United States,\n228 Ct. Cl. at 351, 655 F.2d at 1088 (citation omitted)). Plaintiff calculated its lost profits\ndirectly from the subject matter of the contract, which plaintiff presumably entered into\nfor the purpose of making a profit, establishing a link between plaintiff’s losses and\ndefendant’s breach, and indicating that it was foreseeable that lost profits would be a\nprobable result of defendant’s breach. See Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. United States, 88\nF.3d 1012, 1023 (Fed. Cir.), reh’g denied, in banc suggestion declined (Fed. Cir. 1996),\ncert. denied, 520 U.S. 1116 (1997). Moreover, the testimony of plaintiff’s expert and his\nsupporting documentation, as well as plaintiff’s documentation of costs, indicate that the\nfinal calculation of lost profits that plaintiff presented to the court constitutes a projection\nof the “‘fair and reasonable approximation of the damages’” plaintiff suffered, which\nsatisfies the requirement that plaintiff prove its lost profits with reasonable certainty.\nSee Energy Capital Corp. v. United States, 302 F.3d at 1329 (quoting Locke v. United\nStates, 141 Ct. Cl. at 267–68, 283 F.2d at 524).\n\n160\n    The spreadsheet prepared by Gulf Group inaccurately indicates that the base period\nof the latrine contract was from September 2, 2004 to January 1, 2005. The base\nperiod of the latrine contract, which was awarded on September 28, 2004, actually was\nfrom September 28, 2004 to January 21, 2005. Mr. Carlson confirmed at trial that the\nlost profits associated with the inaccurate time period reflected in the spreadsheet\nprepared by Gulf Group correspond to the base period of the latrine contract.\nDefendant did not challenge the inaccurate time period listed in the spreadsheet and the\ntime periods listed in plaintiff’s calculation of lost profits for the latrine contract. The\nspreadsheet accurately reflects the base period of the dumpster contract and the period\nof performance for the camp package BPA call for Camp Buehring.\n\n                                             173\n\f       Although plaintiff claims lost profits for both the latrine and dumpster contracts,\nand the evidence plaintiff presented allows the court to make a fair and reasonable\napproximation of the plaintiff’s profit and losses, the evidence before the court indicates\nthat plaintiff would have made a profit on the dumpster contract only if defendant had\nexercised the option periods to the dumpster contract. The testimony of plaintiff’s\nexpert and supporting documentation indicate that plaintiff would have obtained profits\nduring the base period of the latrine contract, but that plaintiff would have suffered a\nloss during the base period of the dumpster contract. Plaintiff, therefore, is entitled to\nlost profits as a result of defendant’s termination of the latrine contract only in the\namount of 92,443.724 KD, which is the amount endorsed by plaintiff’s expert, Mr.\nCarlson, as well as interest on that amount.\n\n        That plaintiff would not have made a profit on the dumpster contract, however,\ndoes not preclude plaintiff from recovering the costs it incurred in preparing to perform\nthe contract as a result of defendant’s breach. A measure of damages that allows a\nnon-breaching party to incur the full amount of costs incurred in preparing to perform a\ncontract “‘rests on the premise that the injured party’s reliance interest is no greater than\nthe party’s expectation interest.’” See Bausch & Lomb Inc. v. Bressler, 977 F.2d 720,\n729 (2d Cir. 1992) (quoting 3 Farnsworth, Farnsworth on Contracts § 12.16, at 265 (2d\ned. 1990)) (applying New York law). It is “generally recognized that reliance damages\nshould not exceed plaintiff’s expectancy interest.” See Citizens Fin. Servs., FSB v.\nUnited States, 57 Fed. Cl. 64, 70 n.5, clarified on denial of recons., 59 Fed. Cl. 27\n(2003). When a non-breaching party seeks to recover costs incurred in preparing to\nperform a contract, and the non-breaching party would have ultimately incurred a loss in\nperforming the contract, “it is open to the party in breach to prove the amount of the\nloss, to the extent that he [or she] can do so with reasonably certainty[,]…and have it\nsubtracted from the injured party’s damages.” Restatement (Second) Contracts § 349\ncmt. a. Accordingly, “[i]f the breaching party establishes that the plaintiff’s losses upon\nfull performance would have equaled or exceeded its reliance expenditures, the plaintiff\nwill recover nothing under a reliance theory.” See Bausch & Lomb Inc. v. Bressler, 977\nF.2d at 729; see also Westfed Holdings, Inc. v. United States, 52 Fed. Cl. 135, 155\n(2002) (noting that the Restatement (Second) of Contracts “permits a reliance recovery\nto be offset by losses that would have been sustained had the contract been fully\nperformed….” (citing L. Albert & Son v. Armstrong Rubber Co., 178 F.2d 182, 189 (2d\nCir. 1949) (“[O]n those occasions in which the performance would not have covered the\npromisee’s outlay, such a result [the recovery of expenses] imposes the risk of the\npromisee’s contract upon the promisor…. On principle therefore the proper solution\nwould seem to be that the promise may recover his outlay in preparation for the\nperformance, subject to the privilege of the promisor to reduce it by as much as he can\nshow that the promise would have lost, if the contract had been performed.”))); see\ngenerally Am. Capital Corp. v. United States, 63 Fed. Cl. 637 (taking into account the\nplaintiff’s expected net losses in calculating the plaintiff’s reliance interest), recons. in\nunrelated part, 65 Fed. Cl. 241 (2005).161 Here, the record demonstrates that plaintiff\n161\n     The court notes that, although established by case law and recognized by the\nRestatement (Second) of Contracts, the principle that the court should deduct from\nreliance damages any loss that the non-breaching party would have incurred had the\n\n                                            174\n\fexpected to incur a loss in performing the dumpster contract. The court, therefore,\napplies the generally accepted principle of reducing plaintiff’s reliance damages\nresulting from defendant’s breach of contract by the value of the loss that plaintiff\nexpected to incur in performing the contract, entitling plaintiff to 47,881.664 KD, plus\ninterest.162\n\n        Although plaintiff seeks lost profits in addition to preparatory expenses, plaintiff\nhas not demonstrated that it is entitled to costs in addition to lost profits on its latrine\ncontract claims. Plaintiff cites United States v. Behan for the proposition that it can\nrecover costs it incurred in performing the latrine and dumpster contracts, as well as lost\nprofits. See United States v. Behan, 110 U.S. 338 (1884). In United States v. Behan,\nthe United States Supreme Court stated while discussing lost profits that “it would seem\nto be quite clear that the claimant ought at least to be made whole for his [or her] losses\nand expenditures.” See id. at 344. Even Gulf Group recognizes, however, the plaintiff\nin United States v. Behan failed to prove entitlement to lost profits, and therefore,\npursued its costs as an alternative measure of damages. See id. at 342–43. The\nSupreme Court recognized that “losses...may consist of two heads of classes of\ndamage—actual outlay and anticipated profits.” Id. at 345. The Supreme Court also\nrecognized, however, that these classes of damages are generally pursued in the\nalternative. See id. If a plaintiff chooses to pursue lost profits, then the ordinary rule of\ndamages being measured by “‘the difference between the cost of doing the work and\nwhat he has to receive for it’” applies. Id. The Supreme Court’s holding in United\nStates v. Behan, therefore, applied the established principle that recovery of a form of\nexpectancy damages generally precludes recovery of reliance damages. See\nRestatement (Second) Contracts § 349 (noting that “[a]s an alternative” to expectation\ndamages, “the injured party has a right to damages based on his reliance interest,\nincluding expenditures made in preparation for performance or in performance, less any\nloss that the party in breach can prove with reasonable certainty the injured party would\nhave suffered had the contract been performed.”); see also Stovall v. United States, 94\n\ncontract been fully performed is “unrelated to putting the plaintiff back in the position he\nor she would have occupied if the contract had not been made.” See Westfed Holdings,\nInc. v. United States, 52 Fed. Cl. at 155 (citing L. Albert & Son v. Armstrong Rubber\nCo., 178 F.2d at 189); Christopher T. Wonnell, 38 San Diego L. Rev. 53, 114 (2001),\nExpectation, Reliance, and the Two Contractual Wrongs (noting that the reduction of a\nnon-breaching party’s expected loss in performing a contract from the expenditures that\nthe non-breaching party made in preparing to perform the contract is a “hybrid remedy\nof ‘reliance limited by expectation’ which seems to be justifiable neither by reliance nor\nexpectation theory.”).\n162\n    The court would likely reach the same result if it were to determine Gulf Group’s\nrecovery arose from defendant’s termination of the dumpster contract for convenience,\nrather than from defendant’s breach of the dumpster contract. The FAR permits Gulf\nGroup to recover expenses it incurred in preparing to perform the dumpster contract.\nSee 48 C.F.R. § 52.249–2(g)(2)(i) (2005). The FAR also accounts for losses, see, e.g.,\n48 C.F.R. § 49.203 (2005), and recovery in such situations is a form of reliance\ndamages. See Hi-Shear Tech. Corp. v. United States, 356 F.3d at 1383.\n\n                                            175\n\fFed. Cl. 336, 354 n.20 (2010) (noting that the recovery of both measures of damage is\ntheoretically possible, but that the “plaintiff must demonstrate that there is no double-\ncounting in his [or her] pursuit of expectation and reliance damages”); Dolmatch Grp.,\nLtd. v. United States, 40 Fed. Cl. 431, 440 (1998) (“Plaintiff cannot recover both\nexpectancy and reliance damages on the same transaction.” (citation omitted)). Plaintiff\nis precluded from recovering expenditures that would likely factor into the calculation of\nplaintiff’s lost profits. In addition, as indicated above with respect to Gulf Group’s claim\nfor attorneys’ fees in connection with defendant’s termination of the camp package BPA,\nplaintiff is similarly precluded from recovering costs incurred in preparation of its 2005\nClaim and Settlement Offers for the latrine and dumpster contracts because the 2005\nsubmissions to the contracting officer were without factual or legal basis.\n\n       In sum, the court finds that defendant breached both plaintiff’s latrine contract\nand dumpster contract in terminating both contracts without establishing a legitimate\nbasis for doing so. The court finds that plaintiff is entitled to lost profits as a result of\ndefendant’s breach of the latrine contract, in the amount of 92,443.724 KD, plus\ninterest. In addition, due to defendant’s concession that plaintiff incurred costs in\npreparing to perform the dumpster contract, plaintiff is entitled to the amount claimed in\nits 2011 notice in the dumpster claim, less the loss that plaintiff expected to incur in\nperforming the base period of the contract, or 47,881.664 KD, plus interest.\n\nIV.    The Bottled Water BPA Demurrage Claim\n\n       On September 28, 2004, Maj. Davis awarded the bottled water BPA to Gulf\nGroup for the provision of bottled water to the Army. Although Mr. Cockerham was the\ncontract specialist, he was not a warranted contracting officer at the time the bottled\nwater BPA was awarded. He also was not a member of the Contract Review Board that\nreviewed the offers for the bottled water BPA. Nonetheless, Mr. Cockerham is listed as\nthe contracting officer in the Contract Review Board Memorandum. The base period of\nperformance for the bottled water BPA was September 28, 2004 through September 28,\n2006. The bottled water BPA called for the supply and delivery of bottled water to\nlocations in Kuwait and Iraq. The BPA master dollar limit on the contract was\n$10,000,000.00, and the BPA call limit was $7,000,000.00.\n\n        Modification P00001 to the bottled water BPA, signed on December 20, 2005 by\nMr. Cockerham, deleted the original $10,000,000.00 BPA limit and extended the period\nof performance end date from September 28, 2006 to September 7, 2008. The final\nbottled water BPA call in the record is call No. 0011, dated July 31, 2005. The period of\nperformance for call No. 0011 was July 31, 2005 to September 2005. The parties\nstipulated that the Army made nine payments to Gulf Group under nine different BPA\ncalls, the final payment pursuant to call No. 0011. The parties also have stipulated that\nthe nine payments totaled 2,762,543.767 KD, or $9,865,043.79, using a 1.000 KD to\n3.571 USD conversion rate. Each BPA call and call modification included in the Joint\nExhibits provides for a delivery time. For example, call No. 0002 had calls for\n“approximately 40,920 cases per week for 4 weeks,” and call No. 00202 had calls for\n“approximately 18,750 cases per week for 4 weeks.”\n\n\n                                            176\n\f        In its second amended complaint in the bottled water BPA case, plaintiff refers to\nthe following language incorporated by reference into the bottled water BPA: “The\nGovernment shall not be liable for any delivery, storage, demurrage, accessorial, or\nother charges involved before the actual delivery (or ‘constructive placement’ as defined\nin carrier tariffs) of the supplies to the destination, unless such charges are caused by\nan act or order of the Government acting in its contractual capacity.” Plaintiff claims that\nthis language renders the “Government liable for reimbursement of extra expenses\nincurred for delays when the delay is attributable or caused by an act or order of the\nGovernment in its contractual capacity.”\n\n      Plaintiff also alleges that, under § 205 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts:\n“Every contract imposes upon each party a duty of good faith and fair dealing in its\nperformance and its enforcement.” Plaintiff continues:\n\n       Accordingly, by virtue of its decision to delay the convoys and the return of\n       Gulf Group’s trucks, in accordance with the principle articulated in §205 of\n       the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, the Government is required to\n       compensate Gulf Group fully and place Gulf Group in the same position it\n       would have been, had there been no delays by the convoys, including\n       reimbursement for the demurrage incurred by Gulf Group which is the\n       subject of this litigation, plus interest.\n\n       Plaintiff’s second amended complaint in the bottled water BPA case, Case No.\n07-82C, further alleges “[t]he delays experienced by the Army convoys for Gulf Group’s\ntrucks were not attributable to Gulf Group but were entirely attributable to the U.S.\nGovernment.” In the joint stipulation of facts, however, the parties agree that some of\nthe delays were caused by religious holidays and IEDs, in addition to those that may\nhave been caused by the government. The parties, however, do not agree on the\ncause of all the delay claims filed by plaintiff or as to which delays should have been\nanticipated by plaintiff under the terms of the contract.\n\n       The parties stipulated that:\n\n       The convoy requirement was necessary for security purposes, i.e., to\n       protect people and supplies because of hostilities in Iraq which resulted in\n       people being killed or injured and supplies and equipment being lost. The\n       convoy was also necessary to ensure the actual and prompt delivery of\n       supplies by Government contractors. Delivery trucks traveling in military\n       convoys were delayed at various times because of a variety of reasons\n       including improvised explosive devices and observance of religious\n       holidays by Iraqi nationals. Additionally, the delays occasionally were\n       caused by the Government not having sufficient escorts. There was no\n       agreement between Gulf Group and the Government to use some or all of\n       Gulf Group’s trucks that delivered bottled water to camps in Iraq, to\n       transport military equipment back to Kuwait on their return trips from Iraq.\n\n\n                                            177\n\f(emphasis in original; internal citations and stipulation numbers removed).\n\n      The bottled water BPA included the following “Special Instructions:”\n\n      Purchased For: US Army Various Locations in Kuwait and Iraq. Surface to\n      some of the locations are unimproved which could cause delays in\n      deliveries. Contractor shall do everything possible to ensure deliveries are\n      made on time. The contractor is liable for all equipment and personnel\n      necessary to deliver to the proper quantities. The US Military is not liable\n      for damages caused to transportation assets or equipment necessary to\n      deliver the items.\n\n      Personnel to contact for directions and access to various locations are as\n      follows:\n\n      MAJ Banks:163 968-4819\n      CPT Sharp:164 970-5952\n\n       The bottled water BPA also incorporated by reference 48 C.F.R. § 52.247-34,\n“F.o.b. Destination,” which states, in part:\n\n      (a) The term f.o.b. destination, as used in this clause, means--\n\n      (1) Free of expense to the Government, on board the carrier’s\n      conveyance, at a specified delivery point where the consignee’s facility\n      (plant, warehouse, store, lot, or other location to which shipment can be\n      made) is located; and\n\n      (2) Supplies shall be delivered to the destination consignee’s wharf (if\n      destination is a port city and supplies are for export), warehouse unloading\n      platform, or receiving dock, at the expense of the Contractor. The\n      Government shall not be liable for any delivery, storage, demurrage,\n      accessorial, or other charges involved before the actual delivery (or\n      “constructive placement” as defined in carrier tariffs) or the supplies to the\n      destination, unless such charges are caused by an act or order of the\n      Government acting in its contractual capacity. If rail carrier is used,\n      supplies shall be delivered to the specified unloading platform of the\n163\n   As noted above, according to the parties’ joint stipulation of facts, “Major Banks was\nthe chief of the bottled water branch until October 2004, when she was replaced by LTC\nDerrick Shoemake,” who was the chief of the bottled water branch at Camp Arifjan\nduring April 2005. Mr. Shoemake pled guilty in June 2011 to two counts of bribery, and\nwas subsequently sentenced to forty-one months in prison.\n164\n    As noted above, Capt. Sharp was Maj. Banks’ deputy at the time the “Special\nInstructions” were issued.\n\n                                           178\n\f       consignee. If motor carrier (including “piggyback”) is used, supplies shall\n       be delivered to truck tailgate at the unloading platform of the consignee,\n       except when the supplies delivered meet the requirements of Item 568 of\n       the National Motor Freight Classification for “heavy or bulky freight.” When\n       supplies meeting the requirements of the referenced Item 568 are\n       delivered, unloading (including movement to the tailgate) shall be\n       performed by the consignee, with assistance from the truck driver, if\n       requested. If the contractor uses rail carrier or freight forwarder for less\n       than carload shipments, the contractor shall ensure that the carrier will\n       furnish tailgate delivery, when required, if transfer to truck is required to\n       complete delivery to consignee.\n\n48 C.F.R. § 52.247-34(a) (1991).\n\n        Defendant contends that the military convoy requirement was not contractual\nbecause the clause merely provided contact information for Army officers as to “whom a\ncontractor may contact for information.” According to Saud Al Tawash, the Army\nofficers Gulf Group contacted gave them convoy numbers, and he understood from the\nArmy officers’ direction that it was a requirement to travel in convoys.165 Megbel Al\nTawash also understood that there was a military convoy requirement and testified, in\nresponse to the question, “[a]nd how did you know that you [Gulf Group] were required\nto move in military convoys?” “Because I had spoken to Major, well he’s Lieutenant\nColonel now, Major Shoemake. He said it was the vitality of the water as a sent com166\nvia item it had to be escorted in, so nobody should tamper with it or, God knows you\nshouldn’t play with it, you know?” According to Megbel Al Tawash, Gulf Group obtained\nthe convoy information from Mr. Shoemake, Sgt. Mentor, or Sgt. Brooks via email or,\nmost often, by telephone. Megbel Al Tawash also stated that Gulf Group could not\nhave moved without convoys.\n\n       When asked, “[c]ould Gulf Group have gone into Iraq with the bottled water\ntrucks on its own without the military convoys?” Bobby Wilson, Gulf Group’s Project\nManager in Kuwait, similarly testified, “[n]o,” and in response to the question “[a]nd why\ndo you say that,” Mr. Wilson replied “Because water is a sensitive item. It’s a food item\nand that has to be under military control and at that time too, there were still a lot of the\nscare and whatnot over biological weapons, chemical warfare and whatnot and if you\nshowed up at a front gate of an army base unescorted with truck loads of water, you’re\nprobably going to be shot.” Mr. Wilson also stated that all of the bottled water\n165\n   Saud Al Tawash also testified, however, that he had traveled without a military escort\nfor another company, which managed the United States Program for Iraqi\nReconstruction in 2003-2004. It is not clear whether the alleged requirement to travel in\nconvoys had been imposed at that time and there is no indication that the merchandise\nwhich was being transported was water or food, for which there were additional security\nconcerns.\n166\n   The phrase “sent com” appears in the trial transcript, which is probably a reference\nto CENTCOM (United States Central Command).\n\n                                            179\n\fcontractors were told at a vendor meeting that they had to travel in military convoys.\nMr. Wilson testified that, although Gulf Group could have used private security, he\nwould not have done so without written approval from the Army. According to Mr.\nWilson, regulations posted on the wall at NAVSTAR, a border crossing at the Kuwait-\nIraq northern border, provided that “the trucks must stay in convoy, they must be\nescorted at all times and so on and so forth, I don’t remember exactly how it was\nworded but those rules and regulations and requirements were posted there on the\nbulletin board inside the movement controls office.” Mr. Wilson testified that the\nrequirements and rules were posted so everyone could read them.\n\n        Plaintiff has not alleged improper termination of any calls issued under the\nbottled water BPA. The only time period at issue in plaintiff’s bottled water BPA\ndemurrage claim is between November 1, 2004 and March 31, 2005, as indicated in\nplaintiff’s claim and second amended complaint. Defendant has not questioned the\ntimeframe claimed by plaintiff. In the claim submitted to Mr. Cockerham on December\n1, 2005, plaintiff stated: “This is an offer for settlement under FAR Part 49 with regard to\ncontract #912D1-04-A-0052 which is between US Army Contracting Command SWA-\nKuwait (‘Arcent’), and Gulf Group General Enterprises Co. W.L.L., (‘Gulf Enterprises’)\nawarded in 2004, with the period of performance being November 01, 2004, and March\n31, 2005.”\n\n        Plaintiff argues that its bottled water trucks were required to travel in convoys\npursuant to the bottled water BPA. The parties stipulated that “[b]etween November 1,\n2004 and March 31, 2005, all of Gulf Group’s deliveries of bottled water to camps in Iraq\nwere made by trucks traveling to and from Iraq and Kuwait with Army Convoys.”\nPlaintiff asserts that, as a result of the convoy requirement and insufficient military\nescorts, its bottled water trucks were delayed and, therefore, that the government\nshould be held liable for delay damages. Plaintiff also asserts that the government-\ncaused delays made its performance more onerous than it had expected, and that the\ndelays frustrated its expectations under the bottled water BPA. Plaintiff, therefore,\nseeks demurrage for the delays caused by the government.\n\n       According to plaintiff, “Gulf Group and its transportation contractor Expeditor’s\ntracked the delays of the trucks and determined that between November 2004 and\nMarch 2005 there were a total of 3511 days of delays,”167 which is an average of 702.2\ndays of delay per month. (internal citation and footnote omitted). Plaintiff has submitted\na Gantt chart,168 detailing how many days of delay each of its trucks incurred. The chart\nassumes that the trips were anticipated to take five days and demonstrates that the\n167\n   In its post-trial briefing, the defendant calculated that there were 3,513 demurrage\ndays.\n168\n   Saud Al Tawash described plaintiff’s Gantt chart as “basically data derived from the\noperation. And what we do with this data, this is a document that we and Expeditors\nwork on to make sure that there is no, that the actual data that’s shared between the\ntwo offices are correct and accurate and we need to analyze them so that we can\nproblem solve.”\n\n                                            180\n\fdelay days were incurred in three hundred seventy-four trips, with an average of 9.387\ndays of delay per trip.169 The chart was included in plaintiff’s claim for demurrage\nsubmitted to Mr. Cockerham at Camp Arifjan as an appendix, and labeled: “Gant [sic]\nChart with Tables.” Plaintiff insists that the trial testimony offered by Megbel Al Tawash\nand Mr. Wilson establishes that there were delays attributable to delivering the bottled\nwater and attributable to the return trips, as the result of transporting United States\ngovernment property on return trips. Plaintiff indicates that five “free” days comprise the\nstandard round-trip trucking distance pre-delays, and that these days are not included in\nthe delay days shown on plaintiff’s Gantt chart.\n\n        Defendant argues both that the bottled water BPA did not require contractors to\ntravel in military convoys and that the requirement to travel in military convoys applied to\nall contractors, and even to the movement of military equipment on military trucks which\ntransported food (which included water), fuel, ammunition, maintenance parts, and\nmilitary equipment such as tents and generators. In a post-trial brief, defendant\nattempted to explain why Gulf Group only should be awarded demurrage, if at all, for\ndelays on the return trips, and that the return trip delays estimated on plaintiff’s Gantt\nchart should be reduced by the five “free” days allowed by Expeditors before demurrage\nwas to be charged.\n\n         As noted above, the parties stipulated that the convoy requirement was issued\nfor security purposes to protect people and secure the safety of supplies during\nhostilities in Iraq, and to ensure the prompt delivery of bottled water. The parties also\nstipulated that some delays were caused by IEDs, observance of religious holidays by\nIraqi nationals, and by the government not having sufficient escorts. In a footnote to a\npost-trial brief, however, plaintiff argues that the stipulation merely refers to general\nconvoy delays, not necessarily to delays relative to the bottled water convoys. Plaintiff\nargues that the government breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing in delaying\nplaintiff’s delivery of bottled water, and that, because of the breach, the government is\nresponsible for demurrage expenses.\n\n       In general, “[e]very contract, as an aspect of the duty of good faith and fair\ndealing, imposes an implied obligation ‘that neither party will do anything that will hinder\nor delay the other party in performance of the contract.’” Essex Electro Eng’rs, Inc. v.\nDanzig, 224 F.3d 1283, 1291 (Fed.

Cl. 598, 675-76\n(2010).\n\n        One of the arguments defendant raises against plaintiff’s demurrage claims is\nthat defendant is not liable for delays caused by the requirement issued to plaintiff to\ntravel in military convoys based on the Sovereign Acts Doctrine.170 According to\ndefendant, it is not liable for demurrage claims arising under the bottled water BPA\nbecause the order to travel in military convoys was a sovereign, public and general act,\nnot a contractual action, and all trucks in the Iraq conflict zone carrying bottled water to\ncamps in Iraq were required to travel in these convoys. Moreover, defendant argues,\nthe requirement that trucks move in military protected convoys was imposed by Multi-\nNational Force Iraq,171 not by Army Contracting Command. Consequently, according to\ndefendant, the convoy requirement was a sovereign act, and any effects upon Gulf\nGroup from the convoy requirement do not give rise to government liability. Defendant\npoints to the trial testimony of Lt. Col. Mary O’Connor, who, as noted above, was a\nbattalion commander and chief of transportation at Balad Air Base in Iraq between\nOctober 2004 and November 2005. Lt. Col. O’Connor testified that she was responsible\nfor setting up convoys in Iraq, and that the number of military escorts available was a\ndecision made by the President of the United States. Defendant also argues that “any\ndelays that follows [sic] from that, [the requirement to travel in convoys] that any delays\nthat were experienced on the return trip also are precluded because, once the water is\ndelivered in Iraq, performance is complete and there’s no reason that the government\nshould be responsible for any delays on the return.” Therefore, defendant argues, “[t]he\nGovernment is not responsible for any costs arising from bottled water trucks being\nrequired to travel in military-protected convoys, because that requirement was a\nsovereign act.”\n\n\n\n170\n   In the court’s February 23, 2010 Order, the court denied defendant’s motion for\nsummary judgment on the issue of the Sovereign Acts Doctrine before trial for “failure of\nproof in the record.”\n171\n  At the time of the convoys, Multi-National Force Iraq was the headquarters for all the\nArmy units in Iraq.\n\n                                            182\n\f       Defendant claims that under the bottled water BPA, Gulf Group assumed\nresponsibility for delivery of any merchandise. As indicated above, 48 C.F.R. § 52.247-\n34, “F.o.b. Destination,” was incorporated into Gulf Group’s bottled water BPA, and\nstates, “[t]he Government shall not be liable for any delivery, storage, demurrage,\naccessorial, or other charges involved before the actual delivery (or ‘constructive\nplacement’ as defined in carrier tariffs) or the supplies to the destination, unless such\ncharges are caused by an act or order of the Government acting in its contractual\ncapacity.”172 At the same time, defendant argues, perhaps in the alternative, that the\ncontract clause, which plaintiff cites, titled “Special Instructions,” simply provided contact\ninformation for Army officers for “directions and acess [sic] to various locations,” and\nstated, “the contractor is liable for all equipment and personnel necessary to deliver the\nproper quantities.” Therefore, defendant states, “[a]ny effects upon contract rights were\nincidental to the achievement of the broader governmental objective, related to national\nsecurity, of protecting convoy movements in Iraq.”\n\n        Plaintiff insists that the Sovereign Acts Doctrine does not apply because the\norders issued by the Army were not “public and general,” but rather “limited and\nspecific, and tailored especially to vital commodities like water, food and ammunition.”\nPlaintiff argues that the specific FRAGO introduced into the record, and discussed\nbelow, is advisory in nature and did not require all contractors to travel in convoys.\nSpecifically, plaintiff maintains that “[t]he Government...has not produced sufficient\ncredible evidence in support [of the Sovereign Acts Doctrine], failing inclusive to\nproduce the alleged written order that the Government claims was issued requiring that\neverything and everyone moving in Iraq must follow the military convoys.” Plaintiff\nviews the convoy requirement as arising out of the “Special Instructions” provision of the\nbottled water BPA. As a result, plaintiff argues that the convoy requirement cannot be\nconsidered a “sovereign act” because it had the substantial effect of hindering plaintiff’s\nperformance, which released the government from its obligation to follow the covenant\nof good faith and fair dealing implied in the parties’ contract. Plaintiff also highlights that\nthe government obtained an economic advantage from the convoy requirement\nbecause defendant used plaintiff’s bottled water trucks to transport military equipment\non return trips for free.\n\n       According to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit:\n\n       The sovereign acts defense was born of a trio of cases decided by the\n       Court of Claims in the nineteenth century. See Conner Bros. Constr. Co.\n       v. Geren, 550 F.3d 1368, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (discussing Deming v.\n       United States, 1 Ct. Cl. 190 (1865), Jones v. United States, 1 Ct. Cl. 383\n       (1865), and Wilson v. United States, 11 Ct. Cl. 513 (1875)). The definitive\n       statement of the doctrine is credited to the Supreme Court’s opinion in\n       Horowitz v. United States, 267 U.S. 458, 461 [(1925)], in which the Court,\n172\n    Although 48 C.F.R. § 52.247-34 only refers to “charges involved before the actual\ndelivery,” neither party argues that the issue here applies solely to demurrage incurred\nfor delivery trips, rather than also to the return trips, nor that the alleged contractual\nrequirement via 48 C.F.R. § 52.247-34 concerns only the delivery trips.\n\n                                             183\n\f      citing those Court of Claims cases, said, “the United States when sued as\n      a contractor cannot be held liable for an obstruction to the performance of\n      the particular contract resulting from its public and general acts as a\n      sovereign.”\n\nStockton E.

Cl. at 520) (finding the government not\nliable for the damages resulting from the delay of a silk shipment due to a government\nembargo on all silk shipments, despite the fact that the embargo caused a breach of the\ncontract with plaintiff).\n\n       As explained by the Federal Circuit in Klamath Irrigation District v. United States,\n“[t]he sovereign acts doctrine is designed to balance ‘the government’s need for\nfreedom to legislate [or in the instant case act through the Executive Branch] with its\nobligation to honor its contracts.’” Klamath Irrigation Dist. v. United States, 635 F.3d\n505, 520–21 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (quoting United States v. Winstar Corp., 518 U.S. 839,\n895–96 (1996)). The Federal Circuit in Klamath continued:\n\n      Under the doctrine, “the United States when sued as a contractor cannot\n      be held liable for an obstruction to the performance of the particular\n      contract resulting from its public and general acts as a sovereign.”\n      Yankee Atomic Elec. Co. v. United States, 112 F.3d 1569, 1574 (Fed. Cir.\n      1997) (quoting Horowitz v. United States, 267 U.S. 458, 461 (1925))[,\n      reh’g denied, in banc suggestion declined (Fed. Cir. 1997), cert. denied,\n      524 U.S. 951 (1998)]. The government is not liable for breach of contract\n      whenever it takes any generally applicable action in its sovereign capacity\n      that incidentally frustrates performance of a contract to which it is a party.\n      Horowitz [v. United States], 267 U.S. at 461. Discussing the sovereign\n      acts doctrine in Winstar, Justice Souter, joined by Justices Stevens,\n      O’Connor, and Breyer, stated:\n\n             As Horowitz makes clear, that defense simply relieves the\n             Government as contractor from the traditional blanket rule\n             that a contracting party may not obtain discharge if its own\n             act rendered performance impossible. But even if the\n             Government stands in the place of a private party with\n             respect to “public and general” sovereign acts, it does not\n             follow that discharge will always be available, for the\n             common-law doctrine of impossibility imposes additional\n             requirements before a party may avoid liability for breach.\n             [United States v. Winstar Corp.,] 518 U.S. at 904.\n\n      We have stated that “[a]lthough the portion of the principal [Winstar]\n      opinion addressed to the sovereign acts doctrine had the support of only\n\n\n                                           184\n\f      four (and as to some portions, only three) justices, this court has treated\n      that opinion as setting forth the core principles underlying the sovereign\n      acts doctrine.” Conner Bros. Const. Co., Inc. v. Geren, 550 F.3d 1368,\n      1374 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (citing Carabetta [Enters., Inc. v. United States], 482\n      F.3d [1360,] 1365 [(Fed. Cir. 2007)]; Yankee Atomic, 112 F.3d at 1574–\n      77). Relevant to this case, in Carabetta, we stated that even if the\n      sovereign acts defense applies, “it does not follow that discharge will\n      always be available, for the common-law doctrine of impossibility imposes\n      additional requirements before a party may avoid liability for breach.” 482\n      F.3d at 1365 (quoting Winstar, 518 U.S. at 904). See also, Seaboard\n      Lumber Co. v. United States, 308 F.3d 1283, 1294 (Fed. Cir. 2002)\n      (stating that contract performance by the government is excused under\n      the sovereign acts defense when “it is objectively impossible”). We\n      reaffirmed this requirement in Casitas Municipal Water District v. United\n      States, 543 F.3d 1276, 1287 (Fed. Cir. 2008)[, reh’g and reh’g en banc\n      denied, 556 F.3d 1329 (Fed.

United States, 635 F.3d at 520-21; see also Carabetta\nEnters., Inc. v. United States, 482 F.3d at 1365. “‘In this court the United States appear\nsimply as contractors; and they are to be held liable only within the same limits that any\nother defendant would be in any other court. Though their sovereign acts performed for\nthe general good may work injury to some private contractors, such parties gain nothing\nby having the United States as their defendants.’” Horowitz v. United States, 267 U.S.\nat 461 (quoting Jones v. United States, 1 Ct. Cl. at 384); see also Yankee Atomic\nElectric Co. v. United States, 112 F.3d 1569, 1574 (quoting Horowitz v. United States,\n267 U.S. at 461 (quoting Jones v. United States, 1 Ct. Cl. at 384)).\n\n        In Klamath Irrigation District, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal\nCircuit set out a two part test for application of the Sovereign Acts defense:\n\n      [F]irst [we ask] whether the sovereign act is properly attributable to the\n      Government as contractor. That is, is the act simply one designed to\n      relieve the Government of its contract duties, or is it a genuinely public\n      and general act that only incidentally falls upon the contract? If the\n      answer is that the act is a genuine public and general act, the second part\n      of the test asks whether that act would otherwise release the Government\n      from liability under ordinary principles of contract law. This second\n      question turns on what is known in contract law as the impossibility\n      (sometimes impracticability) defense. Stockton East Water Dist. v. United\n      States, 583 F.3d 1344, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (internal quotations and\n      citations omitted).\n\nKlamath Irrigation Dist. v. United States, 635 F.3d at 521.\n\n\n\n                                           185\n\f        In Conner Brothers Construction Co. v. Geren, the plaintiff had a contract with\nthe Army to construct a facility on an Army base, but was denied access to the base\nfollowing a September 11, 2001 terrorist act, when the base was placed at force\nprotection Delta condition and closed to all but essential personnel, resulting in a halt to\nwork and delay. The court wrote “[t]he government will not be held liable…‘so long as\nthe action’s impact upon public contracts is, as in Horowitz, merely incidental to the\naccomplishment of a broader governmental objective.’” Conner Bros. Constr. Co. v.\nGeren, 550 F.3d 1368, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (quoting United States v. Winstar Corp.,\n518 U.S. at 898). “Courts should consider whether the governmental action is\nspecifically directed at nullifying contract rights.” Conner Bros. Constr. Co. v. Geren,\n550 F.3d at 1374. Other relevant factors include whether the United States benefited\neconomically from the act and whether the act applied to parties not in a contractual\nrelationship with the government. Id. at 1375. “‘The greater the Government’s self-\ninterest,...the more suspect becomes the claim that its private contracting partners\nought to bear the financial burden of the Government’s own improvidence....’” Id.\n(quoting United States v. Winstar Corp., 518 U.S. at 898).\n\n        In support of its position that the requirement to travel in military convoys was a\npublic and general order that qualifies as a sovereign act, defendant points to a specific\nArmy FRAGO and to the testimony of Lt. Col. Mary O’Connor. According to the\ntestimony of Lt. Col. O’Connor, the FRAGO required all vehicles used in support of the\nmilitary to travel in convoys. The FRAGO stated:\n\n       The purpose of this FRAGO is to enhance and convoy [sic] security\n       measures to protect the force by providing convoy commanders and unit\n       commanders tools to ensure that all measures have been properly taken\n       to safeguard personnel and equipment. Unit/convoy commanders are\n       personally responsible for the conduct and protection of convoy\n       operations. MNF-I units will monitor their convoys, and exercises control\n       measures implemented by unit commanders.\n\n       3.C. (U) Tasks to Subordinate Unites. [sic]\n\n       3.C.1.

Convene emergency status board\n       update when the situation warrants.\n\n       3.D. (U) Coordinating Instructions.\n\n       3.D.1. There will be two vehicles minimum during daylight hours, and\n       three vehicles minimum during the hours of darkness. There will be at\n       least two soldiers per vehicle and three in the trail vehicle to provide a\n       turret or rear gunner for tactical vehicle movements.\n\n\n\n                                             186\n\f3.D.2. Non-tactical vehicle (NTV) movements used to transport\nmilitary members, DOD civilians, and DOD contractors are cautioned\nnot to move outside secure zones without security as set forth by\nMSC commanders. As far as practical use armored/add on armored\ncommercial vehicles to move off FOBS. The use and number of NTVS to\nsupport movement requirements is delegated to the MS[] commanders.\nHowever, the number of NTVs used should consider current AIF TTPS,\nemergency cross loading of personnel requirements and safety. NTVs will\nposses [sic] communication IAW Para 5.A.2. below, and have\ncommunication with the security escort.\n\n3.D.3. Convoy commanders are responsible for the self-protection\ncapability within their convoy. There will be at least one rifle in each\nvehicle for all movements. Tactical vehicle movements must have 360\ndegree security consisting of an M249 or above from the turret or out the\nback with the “canvas” removed. All military personnel will carry personal\nweapons, wear fragmentation protective vest, ballistic eye protection, and\ncombat helmet. A minimum of one vehicle will maintain communications\ncontact with coalition forces. Convoys will not have lights on during\ndaylight operations. During night operations white lights will be used, and\nthey will have NVDS in each vehicle.\n\n3.D.4. Prior to all movements, convoy commanders will conduct\ncoordination and include communications equipment sufficient to\ncommunicate with other MSCS when traveling through their AOR.\nAdvanced notification to other MSCS will minimize potential fratricide of\nblue on blue forces. All vehicles must log out with parent unit and provide\nETA to destination. All vehicles must report at destination to their parent\nunit.\n\n3.D.5. Breakdown procedures, convoy commanders are responsible for\nself-recovery capability within each convoy. Recovery equipment will be\navailable to each convoy. Commanders will take all reasonable measures\nto recover vehicles and will abandon vehicles as last resort only. They will\nrecover the vehicle to the nearest CSO or LSA if possible. If not, leave\nappropriate security personnel and an operational vehicle with it until it\ncan be recovered.\n\n3.D.6. All MSCS will report deteriorating road conditions to MNCI, upon\nreporting to convoy support center operations cell(s), convoy commanders\nwill report locations where maintenance is required and where engineer\nwork could mitigate areas of vulnerability.\n\n3.D.7. In the greater Baghdad area defined by the MND Baghdad area\nthere will cautinue [sic] to be mission critical movements only. Units will\nverify route status with 1 CD website or Iraqna or prior to any movement.\n\n\n                                    187\n\f       3.D.8. There will be a minimum ratio of one tactical security vehicle for\n       every ten military cargo vehicles, and a minimum ratio or [sic] one tactical\n       security vehicle for every 5 KBR cargo vehicles. There will be no less\n       than two security vehicles for every convoy (Para. 3.D.1.).\n                                            …\n\n       4.B. (U) All units will conduct risk assessments using mission, enemy,\n       terrain, troops, time available, and civilian demonstrations (METT-TC) to\n       identify and assess hazards. Ensure that seatbelts are properly used.\n       Gunners in turrets and rear facing security will ensure other safety\n       measures are used due to the inability to wear seat belts. All soldiers\n       operating or riding in tactical and NTV vehicles must wear regulation gear\n       as stated in paragraph 3.D.3. above.\n\n(emphasis in original).\n\n         At trial Lt. Col. O’Connor testified that the Multi-National Force-Iraq order\n“provided the general orders for all operations and our order was to protect -- was to\nmove sustainment and logistics and to protect that.” She testified that her commander\nauthorized more stringent measures than those provided in the order and increased the\nnumber of gun trucks to supply trucks in order to increase the “number of security\nelements that had to travel per truck.” Lt. Col. O’Connor further stated that contractors\nwould be made aware of the daily orders from Multi-National Force-Iraq prior to\nembarking on their trips. Lt. Col. O’Connor testified that the FRAGO was the order\nwhich provided for the convoy requirement, contrary to plaintiff’s position that the\n“Special Instructions” provision of the bottled water BPA contained the convoy\nrequirement. She also stated that the introductory phrase, “[t]he purposes of the\nFRAGO is to enhance convoy security measures to protect the force,” required\nmovement in convoys in “militarease.” Regarding the language of the FRAGO, Lt. Col.\nO’Connor also indicated, “I guess it would be an [sic] assumed in the order that they\n[civilian contractors] would - that we would protect them. And further in the order, it\ndoes talk about - it talks about non-tactical vehicles, which would be contract trucks.”\nShe stated she was referring to the phrase in the FRAGO, “cautioned not to move\noutside secured zones without security as set forth by MSC commanders.” (emphasis\nremoved). Lt. Col. O’Connor continued that if a commander suggested that she do\nsomething she would consider it an order. Immediately thereafter, however, she\nresponded on cross-examination that she would have discretion in implementing an\norder, and the ultimate decision would lie with her. The following exchange took place\nat trial:\n\n       Q: Would your discretion have any play into the determination of whether-\n\n       A: Yes\n\n       Q: - to follow –\n\n\n                                           188\n\f         A: Yes.\n\n         Q: - the commanders recommendations or suggestions?\n\n         A: Ethics and morales173 [sic].\n\n         Q: So if you think it’s ethical and morally advisable, the suggestion then by\n         your commander, you followed?\n\n         A: Yes, ma’am.\n\n         Q: The ultimate decision is yours, not the commanders; correct?\n\n         A: Yes, ma’am.\n\n         Q: So, in the military world, when a commander gives you an order, you\n         have no discretion?\n\n         A: I’ll do that.\n\n         Q: You must comply?\n\n         A: I’ll do that.\n\nIn response to the next question, with specific reference to the FRAGO, Lt. Col.\nO’Connor admitted that a suggestion is not an order. She testified:\n\n         Q: Now this language you just read at Section 3.D.2., I believe, says,\n         “non-tactical vehicles movements used to transport military members,\n         DOD civilians, and DOD contractors are cautioned not to move outside\n         secured zones without security.” The word “caution,” isn’t that a\n         suggestion, a recommendation, an advice?\n\n         A: Yes.\n\n         Q: So that’s not an order, is it?\n\n         A: No, at this point, I would say it’s not.\n\n        As indicated above, Lt. Col. O’Connor’s testimony was, at times, contradictory.\nShe offered confusing testimony on whether the FRAGO was an order, or left discretion\nto officers to decide whether a convoy was required. She responded to a question on\ncross-examination as to whether the language of the FRAGO indicated “that there is an\nobligation to provide convoys for the military?” by stating, “[t]o us, yes, ma’am.” Lt. Col.\n173\n      The word “morales” appears in the trial transcript.\n\n                                                189\n\fO’Connor attempted to explain her vacillation, by stating that “more stringent\nrestrictions” were placed on the FRAGO by lower-level commanding officers, who were\napparently authorized to make the FRAGO “more stringent and more plain to the people\nthat have to execute it.” Although Lt. Col. O’Connor testified that she was aware that\nprivate security firms may have been moving without convoys, and although more\nstringent orders were not introduced into evidence, Lt. Col. O’Connor also stated that\nshe knew “that every night a movement order was published and executed and no\ntrucks moved in that country that supported the United States Army, Air Force, or\nMarine Corps without a military convoy that was protected and executed by [sic] section\nand the infantry brigade that protected my section.”\n\n       Although defendant relies on Lt. Col. O’Connor’s testimony, including her\nstatement that the number of military escorts available was a decision made by the\nPresident of the United States, to support defendant’s argument that the FRAGO was a\nrequirement for Gulf Group to move in military convoys in support of the Army, and\nhighlights that Lt. Col. O’Connor “was responsible for all the movement control teams at\nmultiple convoy support centers throughout Iraq, as well as for setting up the convoys\nthat moved support into Iraq,” defendant also appears to attempt to distance itself from\nthe inconsistencies in Lt. Col. O’Connor’s testimony. According to defendant,\n“regardless of whether Lt. Col. O’Connor correctly interpreted whatever order she\nunderstood imposed the requirement that trucks move in military-protected convoys, her\nimplementation of that requirement constitutes a sovereign act.”\n\n        Plaintiff insists that the orders to travel in military convoys were contractual\nbecause the “Special Instructions” in the bottled water BPA instructed Gulf Group to\ncontact two certain Army officers for “directions and access to various locations.” Even\nif plaintiff was contractually bound to contact two particular Army officials, prior to\nmoving merchandise, however, the requirement to travel in convoys was a sovereign\nact if Army personnel were generally directed to require contractors to travel in convoys.\nPlaintiff argues that the first sentence of ¶ 3.D.2 of the relevant FRAGO, which states\nthat “[n]on-tactical vehicle (NTV) movements used to transport military members,\nDOD civilians, and DOD contractors are cautioned not to move outside secure\nzones without security as set forth by MSC commanders,” uses discretionary,\nrather than mandatory language. (emphasis in original). Throughout the FRAGO,\nhowever, there are mandatory descriptions of how protective measures were to be\nimplemented, such as “convoys will not have lights on,” and “there will be two vehicles\nminimum during daylight hours.” (emphasis added). In addition, although plaintiff\nidentifies the term “cautioned” as a non-mandatory phrase, the word “cautioned” must\nbe read in the context of the sentence in which it is contained: “[n]on-tactical vehicle\n(NTV) movements used to transport military members, DOD civilians, and DOD\ncontractors are cautioned not to move outside secure zones without security as set forth\nby MSC commanders.” (underlining added; bolding removed). The word “cautioned” is\nused in the sense of told, but the directive “not to move” is explicit. Moreover, the whole\nsentence leaves the discretion of how to move contractors in the military zone to “MSC\ncommanders,” which Lt. Col. O’Connor exercised by requiring military convoys.\n\n\n\n                                           190\n\f       Notwithstanding the government’s position that the requirement to travel in\nconvoys was a sovereign act, during performance of plaintiff’s bottled water BPA, the\ngovernment acknowledged some demurrage responsibility for delays caused by, among\nother reasons, insufficient number of military convoys. For example, on April 5, 2005,\nthe government increased the price it was paying for bottled water in exchange for\ncontractors not filing further demurrage claims. The following email was sent by Mr.\nCockerham to bottled water contractors:\n\n      Dear Vendors we have constantly been bombarded with Demurge [sic]\n      charges and claims from trucks being tied up over 7 days or water held up\n      at the border [sic] Vehicles shot up or vehicles having to bring equipment\n      back on the return trip. Therefore to elimate [sic] all the paperwork and\n      cliams [sic]. The C-4 and I have sit [sic] down and calculated the average\n      claims and came up with an average number of 2.578 KWD to cover the\n      case of water, the delivery plus the demurge [sic] charges. This will make\n      business easier for us and it will get your money quicker rather than the\n      claims process. All previous claims prior to APR 05 will continue to be\n      processed. We hope that you will find our 1 [sic] offer more than accepted\n      [sic] with the increase in your quote. Some will gain more other,\n      sometimes this will be to the government [sic] economic advantage and\n      other times it will be to the vendors advantage so it will balance out at the\n      end. Thank you all.\n\nThe parties stipulated that, “[o]n April 6, 2005, Gulf Group confirmed to the current\ncontracting officer, John Cockerham, that Gulf Group had received the proposed\nrevised price of 2.578 KD per case of bottled water and had accepted the newly\nadjusted rate per case in exchange for not making any more demurrage claims past\nApril 1, 2005.”\n\n       On September 12, 2005, Derrick Shoemake and Mr. Cockerham jointly signed a\nMemorandum for Record containing information similar to Mr. Cockerham’s earlier\nemail. The September 12, 2005 Memorandum stated:\n\n      The average price of a case of bottle water for delivery to Northern or\n      Western Iraq is 2.0 KD/case. This price includes direct delivery of a case\n      of water to Iraq under hostile conditions, however, this price does not\n      include demurge [sic] charges, storage fees, a guaranteed minimal\n      delivery, back-haul reinburstment [sic] in support of Heavy Lift VI or\n      frivolous claims for trucks that are attacked or damaged due to an IED\n      (unless completely destroyed). These claims were totaling in the\n      millions.... This counter offer [of 2.578 KD/case] allows the vendor to have\n      trucks delayed from returning indefinitely rather than paying delay charges\n      after seven (7) days without demurge [sic] charges (the average delay is\n      19 days before all trucks are return [sic] from delivery). This system\n      allows the vendor to store water for emergency pushes and timely pushes\n      during normal request without storage fees.\n\n\n                                          191\n\f(emphasis in original).\n\n      At trial, Mr. Cockerham offered further information about the price increases in\nthe September 12, 2005 Memorandum. Mr. Cockerham explained that the purpose of\nthe Memorandum was to reduce the costs to the government of processing the claims\n“because it was consuming the time of a couple officers constantly having to make\nadjustment payments and it was with finance and also having to request additional\nfunds to cover the demurrage charges.” Mr. Cockerham stated that the demurrage\ncharges\n\n       were encountered a couple ways, one being trucks held up for return, also\n       trucks who had claims against the government that were either destroyed\n       from IEDs or so forth, things of that nature.... And also for paying for\n       storage, additional storage when the trucks couldn’t move. Several of the\n       companies had set up warehouses on the border to offload the trucks and\n       then reload them because of the long delays.\n\nWith regard to including the storage expenses in the delay charges, Mr. Cockerham\nstated: “We just kind of put it all under that because any delays we were putting them\nbasically under demurrage claims,” and, “[w]e ended up with a small room full of boxes\nof claims of demurrage charges.” When questioned, Mr. Cockerham agreed that there\nwere hundreds of claims. As to how many demurrage claims the government received,\nMr. Cockerham testified: “I can’t say how many.... I’ll say the average was about two a\nweek.”\n\n       The record reflects that the Army had entered into numerous agreements to\ndeliver bottled water, including the bottled water BPA with Gulf Group. Mr. Cockerham\ndid not remember all the companies specifically, but the parties stipulated that, for\nexample, in 2004, StarCon, another contractor supplying bottled water to the\ngovernment in Iraq, “submitted a claim for demurrage expenses incurred from delays of\nthe convoys,” and “[o]n December 4, 2004 StarCon’s claim for demurrage expenses\nwas approved by the issuance of a BPA Call.” Mr. Cockerham also stated, although\ngiving conflicting testimony, that he remembered a demurrage claim from IAP, a bottled\nwater contractor, being paid. He also testified that, “[t]here was one in-house policy,\nand I forget the exact days on it, but I believe it was just standard if a truck was held\nseven days past the required time given for delivery they were paid.”\n\n        Defendant notes with respect to the government’s interaction with other\ncontractors, “the sovereign acts inquiry does not rest upon a mechanical determination\nof how many contractors are affected, but rather focuses upon the nature and scope of\nthe governmental action.” Conner Bros. Constr. Co. v. Geren, 550 F.3d at 1378. The\nevidence in the record suggests that the Army may have required substantially all Army\ncontractors, and of particular relevance here, all bottled water contractors, to travel in\nmilitary convoys. Although she was, at times, nervous and slightly confused on how to\ninterpret the precise language of the FRAGO, Lt. Col. O’Connor testified that she\nuniformly enforced the requirement to travel in military convoys, regardless of the\n\n\n                                           192\n\fvarious interpretations of the FRAGO. Moreover, the requirement for bottled water\ncontractors in the war theatre, to carry an essential commodity for the troops in safety,\nin order to ensure uncontaminated arrival, combined with the desire to secure the safety\nof contractor and military personnel in the war zone, leads the court to conclude that,\nwhen directing that the water had to be transported in military convoys, the government\nwas acting in its sovereign capacity, rather than in its contracting capacity, even though\nthe government appears to have paid a number of demurrage claims. It would be\nunreasonable to conclude that any contractor could move freely without supervision or\nprotection to deliver water to the troops in the war zone. The water and the personnel\nhad to be secured and delivered safely with no possibility of harm or contamination.\n\n        As argued by defendant, “[t]he requirement that trucks move in military-protected\nconvoys was not directed at nullifying contractor rights or relieving the Government of its\ncontract obligations; rather, the purpose of that requirement was to protect convoy\nmovements, both ‘unit moves’ of soldiers and equipment, and ‘logistics sustainment’\nmoves that included contractors,” and to keep safe the essential commodity\ntransported. The effect of the requirement to travel in military convoys on Gulf Group’s\n“contract rights was incidental to the achievement of a broader governmental objective\nrelating to national security and therefore did not give rise to governmental liability.”\nConner Bros. Constr. Co. v. Geren, 550 F.3d at 1379. As the Federal Circuit noted in\nConner Brothers, “[t]he key issue here—as in all sovereign act cases—is not whether\nthe government had the authority to exclude Conner for national security purposes, but\nrather who should bear the cost of an action that was admittedly in the public interest: a\nsingle contractor or the taxpayers at large. The answer to that question turns on\nwhether the governmental action was public and general, not whether it served the\npublic interest.” Id. at 1378 n.1.\n\n       In an order issued by the court prior to trial, the court denied the defendant’s\nmotion for summary judgment to invoke the Sovereign Acts Doctrine “based on a failure\nof proof in the record before the court” at that time before trial. This current opinion is\nissued following a lengthy trial, after review of all the information now in the record\nregarding the period during which Gulf Group was performing under the bottled water\nBPA, including the testimony of numerous witnesses and the documentation introduced\ninto the record. Based on the record before the court, and particularly in the bottled\nwater BPA case, Case No. 07-82C, the court finds that under the facts presented, the\nrequirement for Gulf Group to travel in convoys was a sovereign act.\n\n        Even if the requirement to travel in convoys was a sovereign act, “‘it does not\nfollow that discharge will always be available, for the common-law doctrine of\nimpossibility imposes additional requirements before a party may avoid liability for\nbreach.’” Carabetta Enters., Inc. v. United States, 482 F.3d at 1365. Thus, under “the\nsecond part of the sovereign acts doctrine analysis, which addresses whether the\nsovereign act would otherwise release the Government from liability under ordinary\nprinciples of contract law,” Klamath Irrigation Dist. v. United States, 635 F.3d at 522\n(citing Stockton E. Water Dist. v. United States, 583 F.3d at 1366), the issue is whether\nthe government has shown that, “‘the...actions made it impossible for’” the Army to fulfill\n\n\n                                           193\n\fits obligations under the bottled water BPA. Id. (quoting Stockton E. Water Dist. v.\nUnited States, 583 F.3d at 1367). “[T]he doctrine of impossibility of performance\n‘excuses delay or non-performance of a contract where the agreed upon performance\nhas been rendered ‘commercially impracticable’ by an unforeseen supervening event\nnot within the contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was formed.’”\nSeaboard Lumber Co. v. United States, 308 F.3d at 1294 (quoting Hercules Inc. v.\nUnited States, 24 F.3d 188, 204 (Fed. Cir. 1994), cert. granted, 514 U.S. 1049 (1995),\nand aff’d, 516 U.S. 417 (1996)). “‘[T]he doctrine of impossibility does not require a\nshowing of actual or literal impossibility of performance but only a showing of\ncommercial impracticability.’” Klamath Irrigation Dist. v. United States, 635 F.3d at 522\n(quoting Seaboard Lumber Co. v. United States, 308 F.3d at 1294). “[T]he\nnonoccurrence of the act in question must have been a basic assumption of the\ncontract, and the government must not have assumed the risk that such an act would\noccur.” Conner Bros. Constr. Co. v. Geren, 550 F.3d at 1379 (citing United States v.\nWinstar Corp., 518 U.S. at 905; Seaboard Lumber Co. v. United States, 308 F.3d at\n1294).\n\n       The court concludes that the agreed-upon performance of timely deliveries was\nmade impossible by the necessity of traveling in convoys and unforeseen delays in a\nwar zone. Moreover, regarding the second prong of the Sovereign Acts Doctrine test,\nthe “Special Instructions” as part of the bottled water BPA, quoted above, demonstrates\nthat the government did not assume the risk of delays in getting the bottled water into\nIraq. The second prong of the Sovereign Acts Doctrine test, is therefore, satisfied.\nThere is no allegation here that the Army refused to pay Gulf Group for the deliveries of\nbottled water.\n\n        Left unresolved, however, is whether the government should be held liable for\nplaintiff’s transporting government equipment on return trips, including for delays\ncaused by the convoy escort requirement, although plaintiff had no obligation to do so\nunder the bottled water BPA. Both the trial testimony and the post-trial briefings did not\nfully address the return trips. With regard to the hauling of equipment, Mr. Cockerham\nexplained that the government had a Heavy Lift contract in place at a cost of $37 billion\nfor the purpose of returning equipment from Iraq to Kuwait, which was not being used\nbecause the government, instead, was loading the equipment on incoming bottled water\ntrucks for the return trip. The Army benefited economically from the convoy requirement\napplied to Gulf Group’s bottled water trucks by having the military equipment\ntransported on the return trips for free and by not having to use and pay other\ncontractors to transport the equipment. According to Mr. Cockerham, the government\nalso benefited because the bottled water trucks were used to store the equipment to be\ntransported back to Kuwait “until such time as the government can make arrangement\nto get it back or get it to the right unit.” Because of the convoy escort requirement, the\nArmy was able to more closely control the departure time of Gulf Group’s trucks from\nIraq. Saud Al Tawash testified that insufficient military convoys on the return trips to\nKuwait caused further delays for Gulf Group.\n\n\n\n\n                                           194\n\f        Defendant makes two arguments against defendant’s obligation to pay plaintiff\nfor any return trips. Defendant argues that plaintiff’s allegedly inflated claim and\nviolation of the False Claims Act with regard to the bottled water BPA claims, precludes\nany award to Gulf Group. The court has concluded, however, that there was no\nviolation of the False Claims Act regarding the bottled water BPA. Defendant further\nargues that, if there were an insufficient number of convoys on the return trips, that too\nwas a sovereign act. Defendant argues: “The number of military escorts for convoys\nwas a function of the decision making of the President of the United States. That too\nwas a sovereign act; it was not directed at nullifying contractor rights or relieving the\nGovernment of its contractual obligations, but directed at the broader governmental\nobjective of national security.” Defendant, however, fails to address the fact that some\nof the delays were also caused by the hauling of equipment on the return trips.\n\n       Defendant’s second argument takes the Sovereign Acts Doctrine to the extreme.\nUnder defendant’s interpretation, any decision made by Army personnel in the war\ntheatre ultimately would have been a function of the decision making of the President of\nthe United States in furtherance of national security, and potentially could render any\nclaims by a contractor null. Unlike the trips to Iraq, the claims for return trips are not\ncovered by the Sovereign Acts Doctrine. It does not appear that the government\ngenerally ordered Gulf Group or any other contractor to transport equipment back from\nIraq.\n\n        But, regardless of whether the decision to use bottled water trucks to carry other\nequipment was a sovereign act, and regardless of whether any delays caused by the\nconvoy requirement are excused by the doctrine of impossibility, plaintiff has not met its\nburden of proof with respect to its claims for demurrage monies owed for the return\ntrips.174 As noted above, neither the trial testimony nor the post-trial briefings fully\naddressed the return trips and whether the government had an obligation to\ncompensate Gulf Group for these trips. In a supplemental brief, defendant notes\nplaintiff stated that, “there is not actual evidence in the record of this case regarding the\nexact number of days the roads were closed due to religious holidays or road side\nbombing,” to which defendant does not disagree. Defendant also takes issue with the\nchart prepared by plaintiff in response to the court’s order, arguing the Gantt chart does\nnot identify the days of delay that, allegedly, were government-caused, versus which\ndays were caused by factors outside the government’s control. Unfortunately for\nplaintiff, the evidence in the record currently before the court does not segregate return-\ntrip delay days that were caused by the government from return-trip delay days that\nwere caused by factors outside the government’s control. Although plaintiff alleged that,\nbetween November 2004 and March 2005, there were a total of 3,511 days of delay,\ncompared to defendant’s calculation of 3,513 days of delay, Gulf Group fails to account\nseparately for delays that were caused by the convoy requirement or the hauling of\nequipment. Defendant notes, “[d]elivery trucks traveling in military convoys were\n174\n   Similar to the camp package BPA, latrine, and dumper claims, defendant concedes\nthat Gulf Group incurred demurrage expenses. Unlike the camp package BPA, latrine,\nand dumpster claims, however, it is not clear that defendant is responsible for the\nexpenses that plaintiff incurred.\n\n                                            195\n\fdelayed at various times because of IEDs and observance of religious holidays by Iraqi\nnationals.” Saud Al Tawash testified generally, but without specifics:\n\n      Because the operation didn’t become efficient, we didn’t have the trucks\n      back from Iraq, we had to store the water and we had to incur expenses\n      both local transportation and the warehousing. We warehoused, we\n      couldn’t warehouse this water anywhere. Because of the issues with the\n      climate and the issues of security. This bottled water is again going for\n      the troops. We had to put this in a climate controlled warehouse and\n      secured. So we chose the warehouse in the Free Trade Zone because\n      it’s inside a militarized, it’s operated by the military of Kuwait. And this\n      particular facility was Gulf Telecom's facility. So Gulf Telecom leased it to\n      Gulf Group during this time.\n\n       As noted by defendant, “Gulf Group provides no objective evidence, such as a\npick-up schedule from the factory [sic] or testimony from factory personnel, that\ndemonstrates the existence of a pick-up schedule or a requirement to pick up water\naccording to a particular schedule.” Without more than Saud Al Tawash’s general\ntestimony, the plaintiff has not demonstrated the specific return trip delay days that were\ngovernment-caused. Plaintiff, thus, has failed to meet its burden to prove the costs\nassociated with the government-caused delays resulting from return trips.175 Due to the\n175\n    Gulf Group argues that it requested that the government produce data from “the\nCombat Logistics Patrols (CLP) Tracker,” to allow plaintiff to differentiate between\ngovernment-caused delays and non-government-caused delays, but that the\ngovernment was not able to locate the requested data. According to plaintiff, the\ngovernment’s failure to provide this data “should be grounds for the formulation of an\nadverse inference preventing the Government from arguing as it does here, that Gulf\nGroup cannot carry its burden of proof, and that the documents in question would show\nthat the delays were all related to the convoy requirement.” The Federal Circuit has\nrecognized:\n\n      The general rules of evidence law create an adverse inference when\n      evidence has been destroyed and “(1)...the party having control over the\n      evidence had an obligation to preserve it at the time it was destroyed;\n      (2)...the records were destroyed with a culpable state of mind; and\n      (3)...the destroyed evidence was relevant to the party’s claim or defense\n      such that a reasonable trier of fact could find that it would support that\n      claim or defense.”\n\nSee Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (alterations in\noriginal) (quoting Residential Funding Corp. v. DeGeorge Fin. Corp., 306 F.3d 99, 107\n(2d Cir. 2002)). Although a finding of spoliation would permit the court to assume that\nthe records at issue were favorable to Gulf Group’s position, see Lab. Corp. of Am. v.\nUnited States, 108 Fed. Cl. 549, 557 (2012), Gulf Group has the burden of proving the\nnecessary elements for the court to find that the application of an adverse inference is\nwarranted. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d at 1375; K-Con Bldg. Sys., Inc. v.\n\n                                           196\n\fapplication of the Sovereign Acts Doctrine and plaintiff’s unfortunate failure to carry its\nburden for proving responsibility for the costs of the return trips, plaintiff is not entitled to\nrecover for its bottled water BPA demurrage claims.\n\n                                        CONCLUSION\n\n        The court’s conclusion in the above-captioned cases is based on an unusual set\nof circumstances. Although Gulf Group and Saud Al Tawash relied on their advisors as\nto how to submit claims to the United States government and how to file complaints in\nthis court, the failure of those advisors to provide competent advice and Gulf Group’s\nand Saud Al Tawash’s reckless disregard for the accuracy of Gulf Group’s camp\npackage BPA, latrine contract, and dumpster contract claims leads the court to\nconclude that Gulf Group violated the False Claims Act when it submitted inflated and\nbaseless claims to the contracting officer in 2005 and 2007. Because defendant has\nnot demonstrated that it suffered damages as a result of plaintiff’s submission of its\nclaims, plaintiff is liable only for the maximum statutory penalty of $11,000.00 per claim,\nfor a total amount of $66,000.00 for six violations of the False Claims Act. Although\nGulf Group’s failure to understand the basic requirements for submitting a claim to the\ngovernment leads the court to conclude that Gulf Group violated the False Claims Act,\nthe deficiencies in Gulf Group’s camp package BPA, latrine contract, and dumpster\ncontract claims also lead the court to conclude that Gulf Group did not intend to deceive\nthe government, which is required to establish liability under the Contract Disputes Act\nor to warrant forfeiture under the Special Plea in Fraud statute. In addition, defendant’s\nfailure to establish that plaintiff intended to deceive the government or that plaintiff’s\ncontracts were tainted by a conflict of interest leads the court to conclude that the\nrescission or disgorgement of the camp package or bottled water BPA calls is not\nwarranted.\n\n        Although the court does not condone the manner in which Gulf Group submitted\nits claims to the contracting officer, defendant’s behavior in this case was equally\nproblematic with regard to its termination of the latrine and dumpster contracts.\nAlthough the record reflects a number of purported, and shifting, justifications offered by\ndefendant’s personnel for terminating Gulf Group’s latrine and dumpster contracts for\nconvenience, none of the justifications presented to the court were reasonable or\nconsistent with the government’s obligation to act in good faith. The government’s\n\nUnited States, 106 Fed. Cl. 652, 664 (2012) (citation omitted); Morse Diesel Int’l, Inc. v.\nUnited States, 81 Fed. Cl. 220, 222 (2008) (citation omitted). Gulf Group did not move\nfor a finding of spoliation and did not attempt to prove the elements of spoliation that\nwould justify an application of an adverse inference in the bottled water BPA case. Gulf\nGroup has, therefore, failed to meet its burden of proof with respect to the bottled water\nBPA claims in a variety of ways. See Precision Pine & Timber, Inc. v. United States,\n596 F.3d at 833 (“[T]he party seeking damages has the burden of proving them with\n‘reasonable certainty.’”); see also Ariz. Pub. Serv. Co. v. United States, 93 Fed. Cl. at\n390 (noting that, although there was “no doubt” that the plaintiff incurred costs, the\nplaintiff “did not show to a degree of reasonable certainty that the costs could be tied\ndirectly to its mitigation efforts”).\n\n                                              197\n\fallegations with respect to the alleged security incident and Gulf Group’s performance\nunder the latrine and dumpster contracts were without basis. The record before the\ncourt indicates that government personnel were simply motivated, as Col. Hess\ndescribed, “to get Gulf Group off the bases,” while at the same time contracting with\nGulf Group for other services, including continuation of calls under the bottled water\nBPA.\n\n        The court concludes, therefore, that the government abused its discretion in\nterminating Gulf Group’s latrine and dumpster contracts, thereby entitling Gulf Group to\nlost profits for the base period of the latrine contract in the amount of 92,443.724 KD,\nplus interest. The record establishes that plaintiff would not have made a profit during\nthe base period of the dumpster contract. Given defendant’s concession of the costs\nplaintiff incurred in preparing to perform the dumpster contract, therefore, Gulf Group is\nentitled to 47,881.664 KD, plus interest, which amounts to the costs Gulf Group incurred\nin preparing to perform the dumpster contract, less the value of the loss Gulf Group\nwould have incurred in performing during the base period of the dumpster contract.\n\n        In contrast to the latrine and dumpster contracts, Gulf Group did not establish\nthat defendant abused its discretion in terminating the camp package BPA call for Camp\nBuehring. Defendant has advanced a good faith, reasonable explanation for its\ntermination of the call for Camp Buehring. The record before the court indicates that\ndefendant terminated the call for Camp Buehring for reasons primarily unrelated to its\ntermination of the latrine and dumpster contracts. Although Saud Al Tawash and Gulf\nGroup may have anticipated receiving an award of a call for Camp Virginia, defendant\nwas not contractually obligated to make such an award. Gulf Group is, therefore, only\nentitled to recover the costs it incurred in preparing to perform the call for Camp\nBuehring, which amounts to 19,323.000 KD, plus interest, as a result of the\ngovernment’s termination for convenience.\n\n       Gulf Group advanced a consistent and understandable claim under the bottled\nwater BPA for demurrage costs associated with what plaintiff alleges were government-\ncaused delays. To the extent that any delays were caused by the government’s\nrequirement that Gulf Group deliver bottled water into Iraq in military convoys, the court\nconcludes that Gulf Group may not recover for the additional costs it incurred by these\ndelays because the requirement to travel in military convoys was a sovereign act.\nMoreover, the court concludes that it would have been commercially and otherwise\nimpossible for the government to have avoided causing delays by not requiring Gulf\nGroup to deliver bottled water in military convoys, that the parties did not foresee that\nthe requirement to travel in military convoys would cause delays, and that the\ngovernment did not assume the risk of any delays caused in the delivery of bottled\nwater into Iraq. The Sovereign Acts Doctrine, therefore, precludes Gulf Group from\nrecovering for the delays caused by the requirement to travel in military convoys when\ndelivering bottled water into Iraq. With respect to the return-trip delays, although plaintiff\nclearly provided a service to the defendant, the court concludes that, given the nature of\ntransportation conditions in the theatre at the time, including numerous possible delay\n\n\n\n                                            198\n\ffactors, Gulf Group did not present the court with sufficient evidence to determine that\nthe government is responsible for any return-trip delays.\n\n      IT IS SO ORDERED.\n\n                                                      s/Marian Blank Horn\n                                                      MARIAN BLANK HORN\n                                                               Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                          199\n\f",

W.L.L. (Gulf Group), in the United States Court of\nFederal Claims.1 The cases arise from four awards to Gulf Group by the United States\nArmy in 2004. In the lead case, Case No. 06-835C (the camp package BPA case), Gulf\n\n1\n  The original complaints were filed as follows: Case No. 06-835C, the camp package\nblanket purchase agreement (BPA) case was filed on December 8, 2006; Case No. 06-\n858C, the latrine case, was filed on December 15, 2006; Case No. 06-853C, the\n\fGroup alleges that the government’s termination of its BPA call under a general\nservices contract was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion. Gulf Group also\nalleges that the camp package BPA call termination was made in bad faith.2 In Case\nNo. 06-858C (the latrine case), Gulf Group alleges that the government’s termination of\nits contract to supply latrines to Camp Arifjan in Kuwait was arbitrary, capricious, and an\nabuse of discretion. Gulf Group also alleges that the latrine contract termination was\nmade in bad faith. In Case No. 06-853C (the dumpster case), Gulf Group alleges that\nthe government’s termination of its contract to supply dumpsters to Camp Arifjan in\nKuwait was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion. Gulf Group also alleges\nthat the termination of the dumpster contract was made in bad faith. In Case No. 07-\n82C (the bottled water BPA case), Gulf Group alleges that the government’s\nrequirement that it travel in military convoys to deliver bottled water to base camps in\nIraq and Kuwait3 and on return trips resulted in significant delays, as a result of which\nplaintiff incurred additional costs. Gulf Group contends that the government breached\nits duty of good faith and fair dealing in delaying plaintiff’s delivery of bottled water and\nthat, because of the breach, the government is responsible for demurrage expenses.\n\ndumpster case, was filed on December 19, 2006; Case No. 07-82C, the bottled water\nBPA case, was filed on February 1, 2007. The cases were consolidated on August 28,\n2008. The complaints in each case, however, have been amended multiple times, with\nthe final amendment in the camp package BPA case dated May 6, 2011, the final\namendment in the latrine case dated February 25, 2011, the final amendment in the\ndumpster case dated February 25, 2011, and the final amendment in the bottled water\nBPA case dated February 25, 2011. Some of the cases were stayed pending decisions\nof the contracting officer. Subsequently, the second amended complaints in the camp\npackage BPA case, latrine case, and dumpster case raised allegations of abuse of\ndiscretion and bad faith on the part of the United States. The cases also were stayed\nfor a considerable period of time at the request of defendant to accommodate ongoing\ncriminal investigations and prosecutions, which are addressed more fully below.\n2\n  Although plaintiff alleged bad faith in the second amended complaints in the camp\npackage BPA case, the latrine case, and the dumpster case, plaintiff subsequently\ndropped all allegations concerning bad faith in each of the cases in which it originally\nwas raised. As confirmed in an April 22, 2011 Order issued by this court, “[i]n a\nconference the court held with the parties on April 8, 2011, plaintiff’s counsel advised\nthe court that, upon reflection, counsel does not wish to pursue a bad faith claim on the\npart of the government, but that plaintiff’s counsel intends to proceed with the allegation\nthat government officials acted arbitrarily and capriciously with respect to the\ncancellation of Gulf Group’s contract.” Thereafter, in its third amended complaint in\nCase No. 06-835C (the camp package BPA), filed on May 6, 2011, plaintiff dropped its\nbad faith claim against the government. Plaintiff reiterated at closing argument, “there is\nno bad faith claim in any one of these four cases, 06-835, 06-858, 06-853, and 07-082.”\n3\n  The court notes that the bottled water BPA statement of work states that water was to\nbe delivered to camps in Kuwait, whereas the “Special Instructions” in the bottled water\nBPA, discussed more fully below, indicate that water was to be delivered in Kuwait and\nIraq.\n\n                                             2\n\f       The government filed counterclaims and affirmative defenses in each of the four\nconsolidated cases. Regarding the camp package BPA case, Case No. 06-835C,\ndefendant alleges violations of the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3729 (2000),\namended by Fraud Enforcement & Recovery Act of 2009 (FERA), Pub. L. No. 111–21,\n123 Stat. 1617,4 the Contract Disputes Act, 41 U.S.C. § 604 (2000) (current version at\n41 U.S.C. § 7103(c)(2) (Supp. V 2011)), and the Special Plea in Fraud statute, 28\nU.S.C. § 2514 (2000).5 Defendant seeks forfeiture of plaintiff’s entire camp package\nBPA claim under the Special Plea in Fraud statute, damages in the amount of plaintiff’s\nunsupported claim, as well as defendant’s cost of reviewing plaintiff’s alleged false claim\nunder the Contract Disputes Act, and treble damages and allowable civil penalties\nunder the False Claims Act. Defendant also seeks rescission of the calls issued under\nthe camp package BPA, which the government alleges were obtained by plaintiff\nthrough bribery, conflict of interest, and fraud, and defendant seeks disgorgement of all\nmonies the United States paid for calls issued under the camp package BPA, plus\ncosts.\n\n       In the latrine case, Case No. 06-858C, defendant alleges violations of the False\nClaims Act, the Contract Disputes Act, and the Special Plea in Fraud statute.\nDefendant seeks forfeiture of plaintiff’s entire claim under the Special Plea in Fraud\nstatute, damages in the amount of plaintiff’s unsupported claim, as well as defendant’s\ncost of reviewing plaintiff’s allegedly false claim under the Contract Disputes Act, and\nallowable civil penalties under the False Claims Act, plus costs. Although defendant\nargues that the latrine contract also was tainted by bribery, conflict of interest, and\nfraud, defendant does not seek rescission of the latrine contract.\n\n        In the dumpster case, Case No. 06-853C, defendant alleges violations of the\nFalse Claims Act, the Contract Disputes Act, and the Special Plea in Fraud statute. As\nin the latrine case, defendant seeks forfeiture of plaintiff’s entire claim under the Special\nPlea in Fraud statute, damages in the amount of plaintiff’s unsupported claim, as well as\ndefendant’s cost of reviewing plaintiff’s allegedly false claim under the Contract\nDisputes Act, and allowable civil penalties under the False Claims Act, plus costs. As in\nthe latrine case, although defendant argues that the dumpster contract was tainted by\nbribery, conflict of interest, and fraud, defendant does not seek rescission of the\ndumpster contract.\n4\n  The 2009 amendments to the False Claims Act apply retroactively to claims pending\non or after June 7, 2008. See United States ex rel. Bennett v. Medtronic, Inc., 747 F.\nSupp. 2d 745, 762-63 (S.D. Tex. 2010). Although the amended version of the False\nClaims Act could potentially apply to a submission that plaintiff made in 2011, the court\nrefers to the previous version of the False Claims Act because, as indicated below,\nplaintiff’s conduct in 2011 does not implicate liability under the False Claims Act.\n5\n  The court notes that some courts refer to the Special Plea in Fraud statute as the\n“Forfeiture of Fraudulent Claims Act” or “FFCA.” See, e.g., Ulysses, Inc. v. United\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed.

United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed. Cl.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">447</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 458, appeal dismissed (Fed. Cir. 2012).\n\n                                             3\n\f       As to the bottled water BPA case, Case No. 07-82C, defendant alleges violations\nof the False Claims Act, the Contract Disputes Act, and the Special Plea in Fraud\nstatute. As in the camp package BPA case, defendant seeks forfeiture of plaintiff’s\nentire claim under the Special Plea in Fraud statute, damages in the amount of plaintiff’s\nunsupported claim and the cost of reviewing plaintiff’s allegedly false claim under the\nContract Disputes Act, and treble damages, as well as allowable civil penalties under\nthe False Claims Act. Defendant also seeks rescission of the BPA calls, which\ndefendant alleges were obtained by plaintiff through bribery, conflict of interest, and\nfraud, and seeks disgorgement of all monies the United States paid for calls issued\nunder the bottled water BPA, plus costs.\n\n        Pursuant to the False Claims Act, the government alleges that Gulf Group\nknowingly submitted false or fraudulent claims to the government on the camp package\nBPA, the latrine contract, the dumpster contract, and the bottled water BPA. Regarding\nthe camp package BPA, defendant claims that plaintiff violated the False Claims Act in\nsubmitting invoices for a call issued under the camp package BPA and in submitting to\nthe government its claims for monies due because the award of the camp package BPA\nwas tainted by bribery, plaintiff inflated the amount of its claims relating to BPA call\n00016 for services and supplies it had not rendered, and plaintiff supported at least one\nof its claims with an invoice for services rendered by another government contractor,\nGreen Valley Company (Green Valley).7 According to defendant, plaintiff also inflated\n6\n Camp package BPA call 0001 was issued pursuant to the camp package BPA on\nSeptember 30, 2004, for items covered by the camp package BPA for Camp Buehring.\n7\n  The parties stipulated that, “[o]n September 28, 2004, Gulf Group and Green Valley\nentered into a joint venture agreement to perform certain contracts,” including for\nsupplies and equipment and other necessary expenses, under which Suresh Pulikkal, a\nlegal consultant for Gulf Telecom, a wholly owned subsidiary of Gulf Group, and other\ncompanies in the region, was given power of attorney to act for Green Valley. Saud Al\nTawash, the General Manager of Gulf Group, testified that, to the best of his\nrecollection, Gulf Group did not perform any projects with Green Valley under the brief\njoint venture agreement between the two companies. Saud Al Tawash also testified,\nhowever, that Gulf Group had contacted Green Valley in connection with securing\nequipment to perform under the camp package BPA call for Camp Buehring. Palm\nSprings General Trading and Contracting Establishment (Palm Springs), a separate\ncompany established by Saud Al Tawash, apparently also had a joint venture with\nGreen Valley. Saud Al Tawash testified that, although Palm Springs and Green Valley\nhad worked together on a project, he terminated the joint venture between Palm Springs\nand Green Valley shortly after a December 2004 meeting about waste management\nfraud perpetrated by Green Valley employees. Saud Al Tawash testified that\ngovernment personnel were confused about the relationship between Palm Springs and\nGreen Valley and a contract performed by the two companies was modified in an\nattempt to clarify the confusion. When asked about the relationship between Palm\nSprings and Green Valley, Saud Al Tawash offered the following testimony:\n\n\n                                            4\n\fthe amount of its latrine and dumpster contract claims for services and supplies it did\nnot render, inflated the amount due on its claims for demurrage under the bottled water\nBPA, and obtained the bottled water BPA, and latrine and dumpster contracts through\nbribery.\n\n        Pursuant to the Contracts Disputes Act, defendant alleges that Gulf Group\ncannot support the monetary claims submitted in the above-captioned cases due to\nmisrepresentation of fact or fraud. In each case, defendant asserts that plaintiff\nsubmitted a claim for an amount significantly greater than the contract or BPA call price.\nAs to the camp package BPA, defendant contends that plaintiff claimed $4,544,339.84,8\nalthough BPA call 0001 was only for $1,447,457.22, the call was only twelve days into\nperformance when it was terminated, and as with the False Claims Act allegations,\nplaintiff supported its claim with an invoice from Green Valley. Under the latrine\ncontract, defendant alleges that plaintiff claimed $4,558,428.60, although the contract\nwas only for $613,142.86, the contract was terminated after twenty days of\nperformance, and the contract was obtained through bribery. Defendant also alleges\nthat plaintiff certified entitlement to $999,994.67 under the dumpster contract, although\nthe contract was only for $346,998.00, the contract was terminated thirty-two days into\nthe performance period, and the contract was tainted by bribery. Defendant further\nargues that plaintiff claimed $1,065,711.39 for demurrage under the bottled water BPA,\nalthough its documented demurrage charges do not total $1,065,711.39. Defendant\nalso alleges that the bottled water BPA was obtained through bribery. Therefore,\ndefendant contends, plaintiff must pay the government the amount of money it has\nclaimed which is unsupported, plus the government’s costs generated in reviewing the\nclaims.\n\n     Pursuant to the Special Plea in Fraud statute, asserted in Case No. 06-835C, the\ncamp package BPA case, Case No. 06-858C, the latrine case, Case No. 06-853C, the\ndumpster case, and Case No. 07-82C, the bottled water BPA case, the government\n\n      Q: So these [Palm Springs and Green Valley] are two completely separate\n      companies?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\n      Q: There’s no comingling of funds, there’s no joint employees, there’s\n      nothing that is in common to each other?\n\n      A: If Green Valley was my company why would I ask for a modification on\n      this contract?\n\n      Q: Why would you even need a joint venture?\n\n      A: Why would I need a joint venture, right.\n8\n The parties have, by stipulation, generally converted Kuwaiti dinars (KD) into United\nStates dollars (USD) using a 1:3.571 rate throughout their pleadings.\n\n                                            5\n\falleges that the contracts and BPA calls were awarded in exchange for “money, trips,\nand other things of value” given by Gulf Group to Carolyn Blake, the sister of John\nCockerham, a former Army Major, contract specialist, and contracting officer at Camp\nArifjan, Kuwait, who was involved in the award, and terminations, of some of Gulf\nGroup’s contracts. Defendant asserts that Gulf Group’s actions constitute fraud under\nthe Special Plea in Fraud statute, requiring forfeiture of plaintiff’s claims, as Gulf\nGroup’s actions created an unlawful conflict of interest and violated 18 U.S.C.\n§ 201(b)(1) (2000), which prohibits the offering or promising of anything of value to a\npublic official with the intent to influence an official act. Defendant further alleges that\nGulf Group violated the Special Plea in Fraud statute by submitting false claims under\neach contract and BPA call to the United States government for an amount of money “to\nwhich it knew or knows it was not entitled.” Defendant also contends that Gulf Group’s\ncamp package and bottled water BPAs were void from the beginning, because they\nwere tainted by bribery, conflict of interest, and fraud, entitling the government to the\nrescission of the calls and the disgorgement of all amounts paid to Gulf Group under the\ncalls issued for the BPAs.\n\nContract Awards\n\n       Gulf Group is owned by members of the Al Tawash family, including Saud Al\nTawash. Saud Al Tawash, a Kuwaiti citizen, was the General Manager and one of the\ndirectors of Gulf Group in 2004 and 2005, the time period pertinent to the contracts and\nBPAs at issue. Saud Al Tawash also was the Managing Director of Gulf Telecom,\nwhich employed Ms. Blake. Saud Al Tawash was the primary point of contact for the\nUnited States for both Gulf Group and Gulf Telecom.\n\n       On September 30, 2004, Maj. Gloria Davis,9 who was at the time the chief of\nArmy contracting at Camp Arifjan, awarded the camp package BPA to Gulf Group. The\nparties stipulated that the camp package BPA, W912D1-04-A-0047, called for “the\nprovision of tent packages, portable latrines, light sets, bulk water, dumpsters, and\ngenerators for use in Kuwait.” The period of performance on the camp package BPA\nwas September 30, 200410 through September 30, 2006, with a BPA master dollar limit\nof $10,000,000.00, and a BPA call limit of $7,000,000.00. On September 30, 2004, Maj.\n9\n  On December 12, 2006, after speaking with the Army’s Criminal Investigation Division\n(CID) at Camp Victory, Maj. Davis committed suicide. The Wall Street Journal reported\nthat “[o]n December 11, 2006, CID agents met Maj. Davis at Camp Victory in Baghdad’s\nGreen Zone to ask about $225,000 found in her offshore accounts. Sometime after\nmidnight, the CID investigators escorted Maj. Davis to her quarters, agreeing to resume\ndebriefing the next morning. Before dawn, she used her own sidearm to commit\nsuicide.”\n10\n   There is a slight discrepancy in the camp package BPA as to the period of\nperformance. In one section, the camp package BPA states the period of performance\nbegins on September 30, 2004, but in another section, the camp package BPA states\nthat the period of performance begins on October 1, 2004.\n\n\n                                             6\n\fDavis issued call No. 0001 for Camp Buehring pursuant to the master camp package\nBPA in the amount of $1,447,457.22, with a period of performance from December 15,\n2004 through June 15, 2005. Maj. Davis modified the camp package BPA call twice on\nSeptember 30, 2004, under Modification No. 101 and Modification No. 102.\n\n        John Cockerham was on the Contract Review Board that recommended award of\nthe camp package BPA to Gulf Group, but he was not the contract specialist or the\ncontracting officer. The parties stipulated that “Mr. Cockerham was employed by the\nDepartment of Defense (‘DoD’) as a Major in the Army attached to the Army Contracting\nActivity, Fort Sam Houston Army Post, San Antonio, Texas, from on or about June\n2004, until on or about July 2007.” The parties also stipulated: “From on or about June\n30, 2004, through late December 2005, Mr. Cockerham was deployed to Camp Arifjan,\nKuwait, first as a contract specialist and then as a contracting officer upon obtaining a\ncontracting warrant,” initially for five million dollars. Mr. Cockerham reported to Col.\nJohn Hess, the Director of Contracting at Camp Arifjan in Kuwait. Mr. Cockerham was\nresponsible for soliciting and reviewing bids for Department of Defense contracts in\nsupport of Army operations in the Middle East, and was authorized to award contracts\nafter receipt of his contracting warrant in October 2004. Mr. Cockerham has been\nconvicted of conspiracy, bribery, and money laundering in connection with his\nassignment in Kuwait. Mr. Cockerham is currently serving his prison sentence at a\nfederal facility in Texas. Mr. Cockerham was in federal custody when he testified at trial\nin the four above-captioned cases.\n\n        On September 28, 2004, Maj. Davis awarded Gulf Group a fixed-price contract\nfor the provision of latrines and latrine services at Camp Arifjan. The contract, W912D1-\n04-P-0932, required four hundred new latrines with daily cleaning services. Mr.\nCockerham was the contract specialist assigned to the contract award. Although Mr.\nCockerham was not a member of the Contract Review Board that recommended that\nthe latrine contract be awarded to Gulf Group, he signed the Contract Review Board’s\nContract Review Memorandum as the point of contact for the latrine contract. The base\nperiod of the latrine contract was listed as September 28, 2004 through January 21,\n2005, with additional option periods totaling twenty-nine months, which could have\ncaused the contract to be extended through early 2007. After a modification, the\ncontract price for the base period of the latrine contract was $613,142.86.11 The option\nperiods were priced at a combined $4,444,752.28.12 Thus, the total potential price of\nthe latrine contract was $5,057,895.14.\n11\n  The latrine contract indicates that the base period price of 171,680.000 KD was\nequivalent to $613,142.86, which is the figure that defendant cites in its briefs. Although\nan application of the conversion rate to which the parties have stipulated results in a\nbase period price of $613,069.28, the court uses the price that appears on the face of a\ncontract or call, rather than the conversion rate to which the parties have stipulated,\nwhen the contract or call provides a USD figure.\n12\n  The prices for the base and option periods are listed in the original contract in USD,\nbut a modification to the contract listed the prices for the base period in USD and KD,\nand for the option periods in KD. The KD numbers are calculated into USD in plaintiff’s\n\n                                            7\n\f      On September 20, 2004,13 Maj. Davis awarded a fixed-price contract, W912D1-\n04-P-0897, to Gulf Group for the provision of dumpsters and dumpster services at\nCamp Arifjan. Mr. Cockerham testified that he “thought” he was the contract specialist\nassigned during the award of the dumpster contract. Mr. Cockerham signed a Contract\nReview Board Memorandum as the point of contact for the dumpster contract, although\nhe was not a member of the Contract Review Board that recommended award of the\ndumpster contract to Gulf Group. The base period of the dumpster contract was listed\nas September 25, 2004 through March 24, 2005. There were five additional option\nperiods of six months each following the base period, which were available to extend\nthe contract through September 24, 2007. The price awarded for the base period of the\ndumpster contract was $346,998.00. The combined price of the option periods was\n$1,110,621.72.     Thus, the total potential price of the dumpster contract was\n$1,457,619.72.\n\n       On September 28, 2004, Maj. Davis awarded the bottled water BPA, W912D1-\n04-A-0052, to Gulf Group for the provision of bottled water. Although Mr. Cockerham,\nthe contract specialist, was not a warranted contracting officer at the time the BPA was\nawarded, and he was not a member of the Contract Review Board that reviewed the\naward of the bottled water BPA, his name appears next to the duty position “Contracting\nOfficer” in the Contract Review Board Memorandum. The base period of performance\nfor the bottled water BPA was September 28, 2004 through September 28, 2006. The\ncontract called for the supply and delivery of bottled water to locations in Kuwait and\nIraq. The BPA master dollar limit on the bottled water BPA was $10,000,000.00, and\nthe BPA call limit was $7,000,000.00. The performance period was extended to\nSeptember 7, 2008 by Modification P00001, which also deleted the original\n$10,000,000.00 BPA call limit. Modification P00001 was signed by Mr. Cockerham as\nthe contracting officer on December 20, 2005.\n\n       A number of separate incidents are relevant to understanding the events related\nto each of the contracts and BPAs at issue in the above-captioned cases. The parties\nstipulated that, subsequent to the award of the BPAs and contracts, “COL Patrick\n\nclaim. Defendant does not dispute plaintiff’s numbers and agrees that the correct base\nperiod price is represented by the USD and KD figures listed in the contract\nmodification. Therefore, the total, possible award for the latrine contract appears to\nhave been $5,057,895.14. In his decision on Gulf Group’s claim with respect to the\nlatrine contract, which is described below, contracting officer Joseph Libbey, a\nwarranted level-3, maximum level, contracting officer, stated that the price reflected on\nthe contract for the base period was inaccurate. The latrine contract, however, states\nthe price of each line item. The court, therefore, refers to the amounts listed on the face\nof the modification to the contract.\n13\n   According to the parties’ joint stipulation of facts, the dumpster contract was entered\ninto on September 26, 2004. This appears to be an error, however, as the contract\nperformance period is listed as starting on September 25, 2004, and the signatures on\nthe dumpster contract are both dated September 20, 2004.\n\n                                            8\n\fDardis, the ‘Camp Buehring Mayor,’ sent MAJ Robert McKinzie and MAJ Terry England\nto conduct a site visit of Gulf Group’s yard at Amgarah on or about October 6, 2004.”\nAccording to Saud Al Tawash and his brother, Megbel Al Tawash, a director of Gulf\nGroup, and Gulf Group’s Operations Manager in 2004 and 2005, the visit was\nconducted to inspect Gulf Group’s preparations for the camp package BPA. Saud Al\nTawash and Megbel Al Tawash testified that this first site visit was very quick and\nunannounced, and, although the inspectors “were not happy,” they did not explain their\nconcerns to Megbel Al Tawash, who had received them. Nevertheless, the government\nmoved up the period of performance of Gulf Group’s camp package BPA call for Camp\nBuehring from December 15, 2004 to November 15, 2004 due to a surge. A second\nsite visit was conducted on October 13, 2004, by Lt. Theodore Rivera, Capt. William\nTrimble, Jr., and Capt. Ryan N. Novak, who were assigned to the contracting office at\nCamp Arifjan. The purpose of the second site visit was to ensure that Gulf Group was\nprepared to carry out the camp package BPA call. Saud Al Tawash was present during\nthis second site visit, apparently conducted a day after the termination of the camp\npackage BPA call at issue, at which time he first learned that the date of the camp\npackage BPA call was being accelerated due to the surge. Bobby Wilson, Gulf Group’s\nProject Manager in Kuwait, also was present during this second inspection and\nindicated that the contracting office inspectors were satisfied with their review.\nRegarding the second site visit, defendant’s October 20, 2004 Memorandum for the\nRecord14 on the subject of “Gulf Group Cancellation” states:\n\n      During the site visit, the government was able to evaluate the Gulf Group’s\n      capabilities of meeting the surge. All the equipment (dumpsters, latrines,\n      generators) on site was brand new and Saud [sic] Tawash (General\n      Manager) produced copies of the purchase orders for the fire-retardant\n      tents. Saud informed the CO’s [contracting officers] that he currently has\n      a contract at Camp Arifjan supplying dumpsters and latrines. The CO’s\n      believed Gulf Group were [sic] able to do the job and do the job well. Gulf\n      Group had the technical and logistical expertise, manpower, material, and\n      equipment, and it was our firm recommendation to allow Gulf Group to\n      continue with this contract.... On 14 Oct 2004, the 3 CO’s arranged a\n      meeting with Major Cockerham and Mr. Tijani to meet GG [Gulf Group].\n      Prior to meeting with GG, the government personnel discussed GG’s\n      capabilities.... He blessed their capabilities and informed the CO’s he\n      would follow up with Lt. Col Hess.\n\n      At trial, Capt. Novak remembered preparing a memorandum on the subject of\nGulf Group’s readiness to perform the camp package BPA, along with Capt. Trimble\n14\n   The October 20, 2004 Memorandum for Record introduced as an exhibit at trial is\nunsigned. Additionally, at the end of the unsigned memorandum, there were hand-\nwritten notations. At trial, it was not established who wrote the October 20, 2004\nMemorandum for Record, or who authored the hand-written notes on the document,\nwith various witnesses disavowing responsibility for the Memorandum for Record and\nMr. Cockerham challenging some of the statements attributed to him in the\nmemorandum.\n\n                                          9\n\fand Lt. Rivera, and Capt. Novak agreed with the impression that Gulf Group could do\nthe job well.      Capt. Novak indicated remembering a document similar to the\nmemorandum quoted above. He testified, however, that he did not believe the\nmemorandum quoted above is the exact memorandum he prepared because of the\nphrase, “blessed their capabilities,” which he said “just seems out of place to me.” Capt.\nNovak acknowledged that the memorandum quoted above could have been a draft of\nthe final memorandum he prepared. Capt. Trimble did not remember writing the\nmemorandum quoted above or any similar memorandum, or assisting anyone in writing\nsuch a memorandum, but stated that “[w]e left with the impression that they could\nperform the work.” Capt. Trimble also agreed with statements in the memorandum,\nincluding, “[t]he CO [contracting officer] believed Gulf Group were [sic] able to do the job\nand do the job well,” and noted that “Gulf Group had the technical and logistical\nexpertise, manpower, material, and equipment and it was our firm recommendation to\nallow Gulf Group to continue with the contract.”\n\n       With regard to Gulf Group’s performance on the dumpster contract, according to\nthe testimony of M. Sgt. Edward Sivert,15 a contracting officer’s representative who\nmaintained life support systems, including dumpsters, at Camp Arifjan from March 2004\nto February 2005, there were issues with Gulf Group not having enough dumpsters to\nreplace Future Services, a rival contractor, when Gulf Group took over performance of\ndumpster services at Camp Arifjan between mid-September and October 10, 2004.\nM. Sgt. Sivert testified that, as a result of this dumpster shortage, trash appeared on the\nground in different areas of Camp Arifjan over the course of a week or so, although no\nitem of trash necessarily had been on the ground for a full week. According to plaintiff,\nthe government had reduced the number of dumpsters below the number required from\nprevious contractors.16 Following the termination of Gulf Group’s dumpster contract, the\ngovernment awarded the contract to another contractor, Green Valley, and required two\nhundred sixty-five dumpsters, which was thirty-two more dumpsters than the\ngovernment had ordered plaintiff to provide. M. Sgt. Sivert explained that the trash on\nthe ground was not necessarily caused by the alleged reduction in the number of\ngovernment-requested dumpsters because some of the dumpsters had been located at\nthe ball field, which was closed. When asked, “if there is trash on the ground because\nthere is no [sic] sufficient dumpsters, whose fault is it,” M. Sgt. Sivert replied “probably\nthe government’s at that time, if there was enough dumpsters to put there.” M. Sgt.\nSivert further explained that not all of the other dumpster contracts had run out by\nSeptember 30, 2004, and that both Future Services and Gulf Group had dumpsters on\nbase at the same time. M. Sgt. Sivert noted that he was not present when Gulf Group\nallegedly had insufficient dumpsters on site. He also testified that he remembered Gulf\n\n15\n   Edward Sivert was a Sergeant First Class, rather than a Master Sergeant, during the\ntime of the relevant BPAs and contracts.\n16\n   According to a spreadsheet introduced into the record, which plaintiff asserts was\nprepared by a Maj. Ken Braddock, there were three hundred fifty-one dumpsters that\nwere expired and renewed between June 2003 and September 2004. The Army\ncontracted with Gulf Group for the provision of two hundred thirty-three dumpsters.\n\n                                            10\n\fGroup’s dumpsters being blue and Future Services’ dumpsters being “[g]oldish brown.”\nSaud Al Tawash testified, however, that Gulf Group’s dumpsters were painted red.\n\n       According to Saud Al Tawash, there was an incident with trash on the ground in\nSeptember 2004, which he attributed to “dirty competitors or dirty practices.” Saud Al\nTawash testified that other contractors had flipped over their own dumpsters, causing\ntrash to pile up on the ground. Megbel Al Tawash also testified that he believed the\ntrash on the ground on the first day of Gulf Group’s performance resulted from other\ncompanies tipping over their dumpsters. Mr. Cockerham, who was a contract specialist\nat Camp Arifjan at the time, testified that he had never heard of any problems with Gulf\nGroup’s dumpsters.\n\n         According to Joseph Libbey, the contracting officer who issued the final decisions\non Gulf Group’s latrine and dumpster contracts and camp package BPA claims, a police\nreport that was in the contract files, which he reviewed while considering Gulf Group’s\nclaims, indicated that employees of Gulf Group were scavenging through dumpsters at\nCamp Arifjan. The police report that Mr. Libbey referred to, however, was addressed to\nanother contractor, Gulf Company, as opposed to plaintiff Gulf Group. During testimony\nat trial, Mr. Libbey indicated that “I took Gulf Company to mean Gulf Group, I mean it’s\ngot Gulf and then Co. over here.” The parties have stipulated, however, that “Gulf\nCompany is not associated or related in any way with Gulf Group, Gulf Telecom, or any\nof the Al Tawash family members.” The two companies are distinct organizations, and\nthe record does not reflect that the government has ever issued any cure notices to Gulf\nGroup regarding performance under the dumpster contract. Moreover, Saud Al Tawash\ntestified that he received no performance complaints related to the dumpsters under the\ncontract.\n\n       Gulf Group’s performance of the latrine contract appears to have been\ncontentious since its inception, or even before, as Mr. Cockerham testified at trial that,\nprior to the initiation of contract performance on the latrine contract, Col. Hess had\nreceived a telephone call from Sally Ziedan of the incumbent contractor, Future\nServices, who was “livid going off about how dare he. How could he let Maj.\nCockerham go ahead and award the latrine contract to Gulf Group and how much\nexperience they had, and she was just raving.”17\n\n        Mohammed Al Tawash, Saud Al Tawash’s and Megbel Al Tawash’s brother, was\nasked to oversee the servicing of the four hundred Gulf Group latrines. Mohammed Al\nTawash also was a shareholder in Gulf Group, although, according to his testimony, he\nonly worked for Gulf Group on one occasion, October 7, 2004, which was his first time\nat Camp Arifjan. On that day, Mohammed Al Tawash carried a notepad, asked the\nmilitary escorts for a map, and asked questions about the location of the cafeteria and\nother buildings where latrines were to be placed. Mohammed Al Tawash testified that\nhe requested the information because Gulf Group did not have a service route for the\nlatrines, and a map could enable Gulf Group to be more efficient and effective in its\nperformance of the latrine contract. The parties stipulated that, “[o]n October 7, 2004,\n17\n     According to Mr. Cockerham, Future Services’ bid had arrived two days late.\n\n                                            11\n\ffour Gulf Group employees, were detained by Military Police and/or Counterintelligence\nofficers at Camp Arifjan. After being questioned, they were released to the Kuwait\nMinistry of the Interior” and a Military Police Report was generated regarding the\nincident. The police report stated that Mohammed Al Tawash asked questions\nregarding locations on base for latrine placement.\n\n        According to Mohammed Al Tawash, the military escorts answered his questions\nand he did not remember the escorts questioning his need for information or the\nbuilding locations. The military escorts worked in three hour shifts and, after the second\nshift, Mohammed Al Tawash and the three other Gulf Group employees with him\nreturned to the security station, hoping that a third escort could be arranged.18 At that\ntime, Mohammed Al Tawash and the other three Gulf Group employees were detained\nand interviewed by military police, who were not in uniform, but dressed in what\nMohammed Al Tawash testified was “evening night out attire.” The military police did\nnot search him or the vehicle the Gulf Group employees were driving. Mohammed Al\nTawash was not asked to sign any paperwork, nor was he fingerprinted. The notepad\nhe used to draw a service map and to take notes on the latrines that had already been\nserviced was confiscated and not returned. The military police turned the Gulf Group\nemployees over to the Kuwait Ministry of the Interior, and they were transported to a\npolice station. According to Mohammed Al Tawash, at the police station a detective\nasked them questions, requested their civil identifications, ran a background check, and\ncleared them shortly before midnight on the same day, October 7, 2004. Mohammed Al\nTawash testified that they were released, no charges were filed against them, and they\nwere not asked to return for a hearing. According to Saud Al Tawash, none of Gulf\nGroup’s employees were barred from the United States military camps as a result of this\nincident or any other incident. Mohammed Al Tawash testified that he was not able to\nfinish cleaning the latrines that day, but believed a vacuum truck returned to finish the\njob. He was unsure how many latrines remained to be serviced. Mr. Wilson testified\nthat he had heard that Mohammed Al Tawash had been using a GPS on base, and had\na cell phone with him at the time he inquired about the latrines, but could not confirm the\naccuracy of the information. Capt. Novak also reported hearing something about a GPS\nincident and Gulf Group, but he did not necessarily remember anything about workers\nasking allegedly suspicious questions. Mr. Wilson indicated that he “grilled him\n[Mohammed Al Tawash] pretty hard” about the alleged security incident afterward and\ninstructed him, as a precaution, not to ask similar types of questions on base.\n\n        According to Col. Laurence Portouw, the Third Army Assistant Chief of Staff who\nran the intelligence organization for the staff that supported the General at the Third\nArmy at Camp Arifjan and in Atlanta, Georgia, one of his staff officers told him about the\nalleged security incident involving Gulf Group personnel and said that the contract was\ngoing to be cancelled. Col. Portouw was asked whether he could have the cancellation\ndelayed so that the incident could be examined. Thereafter, Col. Portouw called Col.\nBrick Miller, Commander of the Area Support Group in Kuwait, stationed at Camp\nArifjan, about the incident. During this call, Col. Portouw asked Col. Miller to delay\n18\n  At trial, Mohammed Al Tawash was unclear as to whether he asked questions of both\nthe first and second shifts of escorts, or only of a single shift.\n\n                                            12\n\fcancellation of Gulf Group’s contract so the intelligence organization could look into the\nincident. Ultimately, a case was not opened on the incident involving Gulf Group\nbecause, according to Col. Portouw, “there was no substance to it” and the questions\nasked by Mohammed Al Tawash were “innocent.”\n\n        According to Col. Miller, he received a telephone call asking him to delay\ntermination of Gulf Group’s contract, but he does not recall who the call was from,\nalthough he admitted that “it could very well” have been from Col. Portouw.19 Col. Miller\nalso indicated that during this telephone call he was informed that the Counter\nIntelligence Team was looking into whether Gulf Group was involved in detonating\nimprovised explosive devices (IEDs) using cell phones, and he “took that as they [Gulf\nGroup] were aiding and abetting those that detonated IED’s with cell phones.”\nAccording to Col. Miller, he notified Col. Hess of the request to delay cancellation, and it\nwas his understanding that Col. Hess then deferred the termination.20 Col. Portouw,\nhowever, testified that he did not tell Col. Miller that Gulf Group employees were\nsuspected of detonating IEDs with cell phones because he was “not even sure I knew\nwho the company was at the time.” According to Capt. Jacquelyn Olsa,21 the S222\nintelligence officer at Camp Arifjan in October 2004, who reported to Col. Miller, she did\nnot have any discussions with Col. Miller about IEDs related to Gulf Group. She did\nbelieve, however, that she would have discussed the alleged security incident with Col.\nMiller, although she did not specifically remember doing so.\n\n        Col. Portouw indicated that such incident reports were not frequent, but also not\nuncommon, and that, “invariably we found out that they were curiosity-generated reports\nand simply required explaining to the employee why they shouldn’t do that.” Capt. Olsa\nindicated that similar incidents would typically occur “once a week,” although she\nindicated that she would “recommend a bar for these types of activities.” Col. Miller felt\nthe incident was not particularly important. When asked, Col. Hess agreed that the\nfailure to give a contractor a schematic plan of the camp could complicate performance,\nparticularly during startup, and that a layout with the number and locations of latrines\nwould be of considerable use to a new contractor. Like Col. Hess, Maj. Timothy Petty,\nthe support operations officer under the director of logistics at Camp Arifjan who\n\n19\n   In a July 7, 2010 email to Capt. Lisa Satterfield of the office of the Judge Advocate\nGeneral, Col. Miller indicated that he had received a phone call from “[t]he CFLCC/3rd\nAR C2/G2, a COL whose name escapes me,” and the officer stated that he had heard\nthe contractor would be terminated for deficiency and asked for a delay of the\ntermination.\n20\n  As described in greater detail below, Col. Hess testified that he reviewed Gulf Group’s\ncontract files and found no documentation linking the Al Tawash family to terrorists, anti-\nAmerican groups, the Taliban, Saddam Hussein, or any other enemies of America.\n21\n     At the relevant time, in Kuwait in 2004, Capt. Olsa was known as Capt. Hellmeier.\n22\n     The S2 refers to an intelligence officer at the coordinating staff level.\n\n                                                13\n\foversaw latrine contracts, testified that the provision of a map of where latrines should\nbe located was a good idea.\n\n        As a result of the alleged security incident, Col. Miller sent warning letters on\nOctober 21, 2004 to Saud Al Tawash, Marcos Sotos, Bobby Wilson, Mohammed Al\nTawash,23 Fizan Abdula, Mohadien Asif, and Munir Ahmed regarding Gulf Group and its\nemployees not following certain unspecified security regulations. According to Saud Al\nTawash, only four of the letter recipients (Mohammed Al Tawash, Fizan Abdula,\nMohadien Asif, and Munir Ahmed) had been involved in the incident. Although not\nconsistent with other testimony he offered at trial, Col. Miller testified that he first\nbecame aware of the alleged security incident concerning Gulf Group when he signed\nthese warning letters. Col. Miller indicated that “[t]housands” of warning letters such as\nthese were sent at that point in time in Kuwait and that this incident had “[n]othing to do\nwith” the termination of Gulf Group’s contracts and camp package BPA call.\n\n        In addition to testifying about the alleged security incident, Col. Miller also\ntestified about a latrine incident. According to Col. Miller, on a day in September or\nOctober 2004, he was summoned by Maj. Gen. Gary Spear24 to view about twenty\nlatrines in front of headquarters and facing the dining facility, which, according to Col.\nMiller, were “in a deplorable state of affairs or condition.” Col. Miller agreed with\nplaintiff’s counsel’s characterization of Maj. Gen. Spear having a “one-sided\nconversation” with Col. Miller, and which Col. Miller characterized as “a chewing out,\nbasically,” about fixing the latrines. Col. Miller testified that liquids were “overflowing out\nof the toilets,” and that it was a “life health safety issue” affecting “all of the latrines that\nwere there, because we opened every door.” At the trial, Col. Miller further described\nthe overflowing latrines as follows: “It’s coming over. It’s on the floor. It’s on the seat.”\nAccording to Col. Miller, either Col. Fugate, Col. Miller’s executive officer, or Col. Hess\nwas with him when he viewed the latrines, but he was not sure which officer was with\nhim. Col. Miller testified that either he told Col. Hess to fix the issue or had Col. Fugate\ntell Col. Hess to get it fixed. According to Col. Miller, there were no subsequent\ncomplaints, and Maj. Gen. Spear did not summon him again to view the latrines.\n\n        Joseph Libbey wrote in his contracting officer’s final decision on Gulf Group’s\ncontract and BPA claims that Maj. Gen. Spear not once, but twice, had “summoned\nColonel Miller and LTC Hess to, again, observe the deplorable conditions of the\nlatrines.” When Col. Hess testified at trial, he did not recall the latrine incident, and\ntestified that he did not recall ever seeing even one latrine overflowing. When\nquestioned about Mr. Libbey’s contracting officer’s final decision, which found, in part,\n“[b]arely a week had passed from the first latrine inspection when the General again\nsummoned Colonel Miller and LTC Hess to again observe the deplorable conditions of\nthe latrines,” Col. Hess testified that he certainly did not recall a second latrine incident\na week after the alleged first incident. Furthermore, contrary to Col. Miller’s testimony,\n23\n   The letter to Mohammed Al Tawash was incorrectly directed to “Mohammed\nAltawash.”\n24\n     Maj. Gen. Spear is sometimes referred to as Maj. Gen. “Spears” in the trial transcript.\n\n                                               14\n\fCol. Hess testified that no one ever directed him to fix the dirty latrine. According to Mr.\nCockerham, the dirty latrine was in front of Maj. Gen. Spear’s office, and it was a one-\ntime issue in which one latrine was not cleaned, and was subsequently corrected. Mr.\nCockerham testified that he believed the latrine issue was used as an excuse to\nterminate Gulf Group’s latrine contract because Maj. Petty wanted to consolidate two\nlatrine contractors into one, and because Maj. Petty preferred Future Services as the\ncontractor.\n\n         According to Maj. Petty, he learned of a latrine problem while he was at a\nmeeting at Camp Doha, through a call from Lt. Col. Platt, who told him that “he had\nreceived a phone call, that they were, that they [the latrines] were just really dirty,\ndisgusting, and I needed to get it fixed.” Maj. Petty testified that he personally inspected\na group of eight to ten Gulf Group latrines in a high-traffic area between the dining\nfacility and headquarters after 5 p.m., which had “feces above the rim.” He indicated\nthat “there was one that was extremely bad and then the others were just unkept,” but\nthat all but one were usable. He did not recall seeing any debris in the basin of the\nlatrines. After seeing the latrines, Maj. Petty called one of the non-commissioned\nofficers in his office, which may have been M. Sgt. Seibert,25 who served the role of\ncontracting officer representative for Gulf Group’s latrine contract, to make him aware of\nthe situation. Maj. Petty did not recall any specific conversation with Col. Hess about\nthe latrine issue, but did make Col. Miller, who was at the same meeting at Camp Doha,\naware of the situation. According to Maj. Petty, Gulf Group was contacted to resolve\nthe issue, which he believes Gulf Group resolved the following day, and there were no\nfurther incidents.\n\n       Saud Al Tawash testified that he never received a non-conformance report or\nwritten complaint about Gulf Group’s latrine contract. Saud Al Tawash did, however,\nreceive a call about a single overflowing latrine next to the dining facility, which,\naccording to his on-site superintendent, was filled with empty plastic bottles, even inside\nthe sewage tank “as if somebody was storing plastic bottles.” According to Saud Al\nTawash, Gulf Group’s latrines were unplumbed, such that it was “not possible” for them\nto overflow. Saud Al Tawash also testified, however, that the single, overflowing latrine\nwas an “isolated event.” Saud Al Tawash believed that this incident was due to people\nstoring plastic bottles in the latrine for recycling, or a cultural issue for third country\nnationals on Camp Arifjan, who were not used to unplumbed latrines.\n\n       According to trial testimony from Megbel Al Tawash, Gulf Group’s office received\na call that one latrine had feces up to the brim, which plaintiff’s on-site supervisor\ncleaned that same day. Megbel Al Tawash indicated that a Gulf Group latrine was\n“overflowing with bottles of water and feces.” Megbel Al Tawash testified that Future\nServices had about eight to ten latrines in the same area near the mess hall. Mr.\nWilson testified that, because the latrines from various companies all looked the same,\n\n25\n  Maj. Petty testified that “M. Sgt. Seibert” oversaw the latrine contract. It is unclear\nwhether Maj. Petty’s testimony refers to M. Sgt. Sivert, who as indicated above,\nmaintained life support systems at Camp Arifjan, including dumpsters.\n\n                                            15\n\fit was possible that the dirty latrine, or the latrines involved in the incident, belonged to\nanother contractor.\n\n        Maj. Petty testified that Future Services still had latrines in place when Jasmine\nInternational Trading & Service Company (Jasmine) and Gulf Group first arrived, so that\nthese new contractors would know where to put the latrines, and that, as a result, two\nsets of latrines may have been in a particular area at the same time. Maj. Petty also\ntestified that, to the best of his recollection, servicing the latrines once a day would have\nbeen sufficient. The statement of work for Gulf Group’s latrine contract stated, in part:\n\n       4.2 Cleaning. The Contractor will empty and clean each latrine daily by\n       wiping down interior walls and seat with mild disinfectant water or solution\n       (that is nonharmful to the skin and eyes) and will provide steam cleaning\n       reconditioning services once a month. The Contractor will provide all\n       materials, equipment, personnel, chemicals, and cleaning supplies to\n       include using an approved disinfectant. The Contractor will provide a\n       Material Safe Data Sheet to the COR for any chemicals used in this\n       contract. The cleaning services will include the following:\n\n       4.2.1 Daily. The Contractor will vacuum sewage from the basin. Debris\n       such as cans, bottles, rags, sticks, etc. will be removed from the waste\n       tank, collected and hauled away for proper disposal. No debris will be\n       allowed to contaminate the outside area around the chemical latrine. The\n       Contractor will be responsible for cleanup of any spills. After all sewage\n       and debris have been removed the Contractor will wash the toilet seat,\n       urinal, and adjacent area around the toilet seat with the approved cleaning\n       solution and remove all built up dirt and waste by scrubbing with a nylon\n       hand brush. The Contractor will fill the empty basin with a mixture of two\n       (2) cups disinfectant solution and ten (10) gallons fresh water. The\n       Contractor will refill toilet paper dispensers and hand sanitation gel\n       dispensers. The Contractor will leave the area in and around the latrines\n       in a sanitary state.\n\n(emphasis in original). Based on his experience, Col. Hess believed that a contract that\nonly required service of latrines once a day in high-traffic areas like the mess hall or\nheadquarters may have set a contractor up for failure because these areas should have\nbeen cleaned twice a day. Steven Perry, a former Army Colonel and plaintiff’s expert\non issues of Army contracting and standard practices and procedures for Army\ncontracting,26 also testified that, if the government sets a once-per-day cleaning\nrequirement for latrines, but has not anticipated the extent of the usage, the state of\nuncleanliness of the latrines may not be attributable to the contractor, but rather to faulty\n26\n   Mr. Perry was qualified as an expert in the standard practices and procedures of\nArmy contracting, including the subjects of the solicitation, award, management,\nadministration, closeout, and termination of contracts. Mr. Perry also was qualified as\nan expert on the interrelationship and interface of those same practices and procedures\nwith basic principles of command and control.\n\n                                             16\n\fspecifications, and that, if the specification underestimates usage, the specifications\nmay need to be altered. Moreover, according to Mr. Perry, if bottles of water were\nfound in a latrine, it would be the fault of the “end-user,” not of the contractor.\n\n        Mr. Perry further stated that “in a latrine contracting situation, you get all kinds of\ngarbage dumped in the latrines all the time. That happens to be a performance issue.\nThat is why this type of contract is very hard to manage.” During his testimony, Col.\nMiller also indicated that latrines are “a subject that you have to watch,” and that he\nwould expect that, if a contracting officer representative had seen the latrine incident, a\nnon-conformance report would have been prepared “[a]t some point.” In contrast, Col.\nHess testified that “we generally did not have problems with latrine contracts.”\nAccording to Col. Hess, a contractor missing a group of latrines during servicing was not\nuncommon and was not considered a serious offense warranting termination for default.\nCol. Hess further testified that, to his knowledge, his contracting office had no\nperformance problems with Gulf Group and that Gulf Group’s latrine contract was not\nterminated for failure to clean the latrines. Mr. Perry also testified that he does not think\nlatrine contracts are “hard to manage, as long as you set in place what needs to be\ndone.”\n\n       There is confusion and inconsistency in the record as to the timing of the latrine\nincident relative to the alleged security incident involving Mohammed Al Tawash. In his\nJuly 7, 2010 email to Capt. Satterfield, Col. Miller indicated, almost six years after the\nevent in question, that he believed the latrine incident occurred in the week prior to the\nalleged security incident. According to Maj. Petty, the support operations officer at\nCamp Arifjan who oversaw numerous latrine contracts, the alleged security incident\noccurred before the latrine incident, the latter of which occurred in the “October time\nframe.” Maj. Petty testified that, “[i]nitially before the deposition and we met, I would\nhave said it [the questions incident] was after the dirty latrines. But after reviewing the\nnotes that you [plaintiff’s counsel] showed me to refresh my memory, that it was before.”\nAccording to Mr. Wilson, the latrine incident was before the alleged security incident.\nMr. Wilson stated, “you know, first it was this issue in the latrine, and the next thing it’s\nthe issue of Mohammed. And the next thing it’s the issue of a counterintelligence\nmeasure.…”\n\nTerminations of the Camp Package BPA Call, the Latrine Contract, and the\nDumpster Contract\n\n        Maj. Davis terminated Gulf Group’s camp package BPA call at Camp Buehring\non October 12, 2004, through Modification 103. According to the parties’ joint\nstipulation of facts, the camp package BPA call was terminated for the government’s\nconvenience, although this is not clearly indicated on Modification 103. The\nmodification stated: “The purpose of this modification is to cancel the BPA call with Gulf\nGroup. Gulf Group has no issues with this cancellation and will accept it at no cost to\nthe government.” Despite terminating the camp package BPA call, the government had\nsufficient funds to pay for, and continued to be in need of, the camp package services.\nThe same day the cancellation was issued, Future Services was awarded two BPA calls\n\n\n                                              17\n\ffor Camp Buehring for approximately the same amount of goods and services as Gulf\nGroup’s cancelled camp package BPA call.\n\n       Plaintiff’s initial submission to the contracting officer in relation to the camp\npackage BPA call termination indicated that the termination was made in order to award\nGulf Group another BPA call. Plaintiff’s statement was supported by some of the\ntestimony at trial, which indicated that the termination of the Camp Buehring camp\npackage call was conditioned on the award to Gulf Group of a camp package call for\nCamp Virginia. During cross-examination at trial, Saud Al Tawash indicated that he\nmay have agreed to the termination of the Camp Buehring camp package call based\nupon the assurance that he would receive a camp package call for Camp Virginia.\nSaud Al Tawash testified that he had asked for the paperwork to be sent over for the\nproposed swap, which he never received. The parties have stipulated that “BPA Call\nNo. 0002 under Master BPA 0047 for general camp package services at Camp Virginia\nwas prepared for Gulf Group but never signed.” Saud Al Tawash indicated at trial that\nhe had received an undated hand-written note from Mr. Cockerham, stating:\n\n      Here is a copy of the cancellation to Camp Buehring. This cancellation\n      was made because we were giving you a larger camp call Virginia.\n      Virginia award was verbal with the agreement to cancel Buehring. Virginia\n      was not awarded on paper as a command directive. The original\n      cancellation was sent out 13 Oct 04. But here is another copy as\n      requested. Thank you.\n\n        From this note, Saud Al Tawash testified that he understood that the Army would\nnot award Camp Virginia to Gulf Group. Mr. Cockerham testified, however, that he may\nhave sent the note as a “reassurance” and that the note was intended to convey that a\ncall for Camp Virginia had been verbally “awarded,” but that Col. Hess had ordered\ncontracting personnel not to award Camp Virginia “on paper” because he may have\nbeen considering another contractor for the Camp Virginia call and because Col. Hess\n“was checking on...some other issues from perhaps a security report.” Instead, the\ncamp package call for Camp Virginia was initially awarded to StarCon, Ltd. (StarCon),\nbut the BPA call issued under that BPA was cancelled on October 11, 2004 by Maj.\nDavis, and ultimately was awarded to Kamal Al Sultan Company (KMS) on October 14,\n2004.\n\n        On October 18, 2004, Mr. Cockerham issued Modification P00002, which\nterminated plaintiff’s latrine contract pursuant to 48 C.F.R. § 52.212-4. The description\nof Modification P00002 reads: “This contract is being canceled due to command\ndirective of the ASG [Army Support Group] commander SWA COL Brick Miller 3rd Army\nArcent Kuwait. The contract is canceled under the terms of 52.212-1, 52-212-4 [sic],\n52.249-4.” According to the parties’ joint stipulation of facts, the latrine contract was\ncancelled on October 24, 2004, pursuant to Modification P00003, but the description of\nModification P00003 reads: “Modification to this previously canceled contract by order of\nthe ASG Commander Kuwait COL Miller. This mod is to remove money from previously\ncanceled contract that was ordered [sic] to be canceled. Contract was canceled in\n\n\n                                           18\n\faccordance with FAR Part 52.212-4.” Despite terminating Gulf Group’s latrine contract,\nthe government had sufficient funds to pay for, and continued to be in need of, the\nlatrine services. The parties stipulated that “[a]ll or part of the service that was initially\nawarded to Gulf Group under the latrine contract was awarded to Jasmine.” Following\ntermination of the latrine contract, the government continued to place orders for latrines\nwith Gulf Group for other locations, including Camp Victory, Camp Crossing, and the\nAsh Shuaybah Sea Port of Debarkation.\n\n       On October 22, 2004, Mr. Cockerham issued Modification P00005 on behalf of\nthe Army, which terminated Gulf Group’s dumpster contract for the convenience of the\ngovernment.27 Modification P00005 reads: “Contract is cancelled by order of the ASG\nCommander Kuwait COL Brick Miller. Contract was canceled in accordance with FAR\nPart 52.212-4 Termination for Convenience of the Government.” Despite terminating\nthe dumpster contract, the government had sufficient funds to pay for, and continued to\nbe in need of, the dumpster services. Prior to the termination of Gulf Group’s dumpster\ncontract, on October 14, 2004, the government sent a request to Fouad Salem of Abdul\nHameed Salem, seeking a quote for dumpster services at Camp Arifjan, to which Fouad\nSalem responded. Four days later, on October 18, 2004, and before plaintiff’s dumpster\ncontract was cancelled, a contract for dumpster services was awarded to Green Valley.\nAfter Gulf Group’s dumpster contract was terminated, however, the government\ncontinued to order dumpsters from Gulf Group for the Ash Shuaybah Sea Port of\nDebarkation.\n\n        Despite the language contained in the modifications terminating the camp\npackage BPA call and the latrine and dumpster contracts, at trial, a number of\nwitnesses offered contradictory testimony as to the reasons for the multiple\nterminations. Although contradicted by other witnesses, Col. Miller indicated that he did\nnot direct, nor was he involved in, the termination of the camp package BPA call, the\nlatrine contract, or the dumpster contract.28 Col. Miller stated that contracting was a\n\n27\n   The parties’ joint stipulation of facts states that Mr. Cockerham issued the termination\non October 22, 2004. Although Mr. Cockerham signed the modification terminating the\ncontract on October 21, 2004, October 22, 2004 is shown as the “effective date” of the\ntermination. Gulf Group was faxed the modification on October 28, 2004.\n28\n   For example, during direct examination, Col. Miller was presented with a copy of\nModification P00005 to the dumpster contract, which stated: “Contract is canceled by\norder of the ASG Commander Kuwait COL Brick Miller. Contract was canceled in\naccordance with FAR Part 52-212-4 Termination for Convenience of the Government.”\nAfter the Modification P00005 to the dumpster contract was read into the record, Col.\nMiller and plaintiff’s counsel had the following exchange:\n\n       Q: Is that statement true and correct?\n\n       A: No, sir.\n\n\n                                             19\n\fcompletely separate command structure from his own command, and that he did not\nhave the authority to terminate or award contracts. Col. Miller also testified, however,\nthat the Gulf Group terminations were not related to the alleged security incident,\nindicating at least some awareness of the whole situation. In addition, according to\nClea Efthimiadis, a United States Army29 civilian attorney assigned to Camp Arifjan at\nthe time, Col. Miller represented to her that Gulf Group’s latrine contract “was\nterminated because they couldn’t do the job,” and that the contract was terminated for\ndefault based on a “repeated failure to perform to the statement of work.” As noted\nabove, however, Gulf Group’s contracts and camp package BPA call were terminated\nfor the convenience of the government.30\n\n      Q: Do you have any idea on your -- this is going back to your knowledge\n      and -- mind you -- why Major Cockerham would have said that you\n      ordered this termination?\n\n      A: Can you be more specific than, “any idea?” Any idea at that time? Any\n      idea now? Any idea hearsay?\n\n      Q: Very good point. In -- you’ll notice the effective date of this is October\n      22, 2004. In 2004, did you have any idea -- did you even know that this\n      contract had been canceled?\n\n      A: Sir, I couldn’t have told you that this contract even existed in this form.\n      Because I didn’t talk to contractors. I didn’t --\n\n      Q: This is not your command.\n\n      A: -- correct. I had no reason to look at these, nor do I have any reason to\n      look at when they cancel them.\n29\n  Although formerly a civilian attorney for the United States Army, Ms. Efthimiadis was\nan attorney for the United States Navy when she testified in the above-captioned cases.\n30\n   The distinction between termination for default or cause and termination for\nconvenience is evident from the termination clauses in the camp package BPA:\n\n      Termination for the Government’s convenience.              The Government\n      reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole\n      convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall\n      immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and\n      all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms\n      of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid a percentage of the contract\n      price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of\n      termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to\n      the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping\n      system, have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be\n      required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost\n\n                                            20\n\f        Col. Hess, the head of contracting at Camp Arifjan at the relevant time, offered\ninconsistent and self-serving testimony at trial, but generally testified that he believed\nGulf Group’s camp package BPA call, latrine contract, and dumpster contract were\nterminated because of security concerns, and that Col. Miller gave a directive or order\nto terminate the contracts. According to Col. Hess’ testimony, Col. Hess ordered Mr.\nCockerham to terminate Gulf Group’s latrine and dumpster contracts, and Col. Hess\nordered Maj. Davis to terminate Gulf Group’s camp package BPA call, because “[w]e\nwere ordered to get Gulf Group off the bases, the camps.” Col. Hess indicated that this\norder to remove Gulf Group from the bases did not come from Col. Mark Neumann, the\nPrincipal Assistant Responsible for Contracting at Camp Arifjan in October 2004, to\nwhom Col. Hess reported, or anyone in ARCENT (United States Army Central\nCommand). He also stated that he had reviewed the contract files, and that none of the\nfiles included any documentation linking the Al Tawash family to terrorists, anti-\nAmerican groups, the Taliban, Saddam Hussein, or any other enemies of America.\nAccording to Mr. Wilson, however, Col. Hess told him that Gulf Group’s contracts were\nterminated due to “counterintelligence on the Al Tawash family, and they have ties [to]\nAl Qaeda and Saddam Hussein.” Notably, Col. Hess testified that the government\nterminated Gulf Group for convenience, rather than for default, so that Gulf Group could\nfile claims for reimbursement because the government did not “want to cause any\nundue hardship” to Gulf Group. Col. Hess further stated that he does not believe that a\ntermination for default is proper even if a contractor is suspected of anti-American ties\nor sentiments.\n\n       According to Col. Portouw, the Gulf Group cancellations “had something to do\nwith performance with latrines,” but he did not recall who told him that and did not\nindicate to which Gulf Group contract he was referring because he never referred\nspecifically to any particular contract during his testimony. According to Maj. Petty’s\nrecollection, Gulf Group’s contracts were terminated because of the alleged security\n\n\n\n      principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government\n      any right to audit the Contractor’s records. The Contractor shall not be\n      paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could\n      have been avoided.\n\n      Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or\n      any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or\n      if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or\n      fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances\n      of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the\n      Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for\n      supplies or services not accepted, and the Contract shall be liable to the\n      Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is\n      determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for\n      default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.\n\n                                           21\n\fincident, as opposed to the dirty latrine incident.31 Maj. Petty testified that he had never\nheard of Gulf Group having any affiliation with the Taliban.\n\n       Capt. Novak also testified that a Gulf Group contract was terminated because of\na “security incident.” Capt. Novak disagreed with the decision to terminate Gulf Group’s\ncamp package BPA call, and although he was at first unable to meet with Col. Hess,\nCapt. Novak did meet with Col. Neumann32 to discuss his disagreement with the\ntermination. Capt. Novak also indicated that he did not feel that he was going outside\nthe chain-of-command or risking his career by doing so. Eventually, Capt. Novak was\nable to meet with Col. Hess to voice his disagreement with the decision to terminate\nGulf Group’s camp package BPA call. Capt. Novak also met with Tijani Saani, a civilian\nassigned to the contracting office at Camp Arifjan, who was the deputy to Col. Hess,\nabout the decision. Capt. Trimble also spoke to Col. Neumann about terminating Gulf\nGroup’s camp package BPA call and told Col. Neumann that he believed Gulf Group\nwas capable of performing. Capt. Trimble indicated that he had heard that Gulf Group’s\ncamp package BPA call was going to be terminated because the camp “mayors”\npreferred to keep their current contractors to avoid interruption of services.\n\n       Mr. Cockerham testified that he terminated Gulf Group’s latrine and dumpster\ncontracts based on a direct order from Col. Hess, who himself had been ordered to\nterminate the contracts by Col. Miller. According to Mr. Cockerham, a termination for\nconvenience in the interest of national security relieves the government of liability for\n“any losses.”33 Mr. Cockerham stated, however, the termination has to be or should be\nheavily documented, which is why he requested a report to document the file, to protect\nthe contracting office and the government. According to Mr. Cockerham, Col. Hess\ndirected him to cancel Gulf Group’s contracts “in the interest of security, national\nsecurity.” Mr. Cockerham further testified that Col. Hess said that a call for Camp\nVirginia should not be awarded to Gulf Group because they were a security risk.\nAccording to Mr. Cockerham, he asked Col. Miller and Col. Hess for a security incident\nreport, or even just the incident number, to attach to the latrine and dumpster contract\ncancellations, but they never gave him one. Capt. Trimble testified that Mr. Cockerham\nwas upset that he never received a Memorandum of Record from Col. Hess, stating that\nCol. Hess directed Mr. Cockerham to cancel Gulf Group’s contracts. At trial, Col. Hess\n31\n   Maj. Petty’s testimony on this point appears to be related to the termination of three of\nplaintiff’s contracts, the camp package BPA call and the latrine and dumpster contracts,\nalthough his testimony is not explicit in this regard.\n32\n   Although the trial transcript refers to “Col. Newman,” other areas of Capt. Novak’s\ntestimony refer to Col. Neumann, Col. Hess’ superior and the Principal Assistant\nResponsible for Contracting at Camp Arifjan.\n33\n    Mr. Cockerham subsequently elaborated that in his mind, “[t]he only time the\ngovernment can possibly get around reimbursing in the interest of convenience is in the\ninterest of national security.” It is unclear from Mr. Cockerham’s testimony whether he\nbelieved that a termination for convenience in the interest of national security absolves\nthe government of all liability or only liability relating to “losses.”\n\n                                            22\n\fdenied that either Mr. Cockerham or Maj. Davis had asked for a security incident report\nin order to support the cancellations of the contracts or the camp package BPA call.\n\n        The October 20, 2004 Memorandum for Record, which Capt. Novak stated is\nsimilar to the one he wrote with Capt. Trimble and Lt. Rivera, provides that, “Major\nCockerham informed the CO’s to cancel the [camp package] BPA call to Gulf Group\ndue to their inexperience in building tents,” and that the contract should be awarded to\nBritish Link Kuwait, although its prices were “unreasonably” high. At trial, however, Mr.\nCockerham denied having told Capt. Trimble, Capt. Novak, and Lt. Rivera that Gulf\nGroup’s camp package BPA call was being terminated due to Gulf Group’s\ninexperience in building tents, or that it was in the government’s best interest to award\nthe call to British Link Kuwait. Mr. Cockerham testified he believed that Tijani Saani told\nCapt. Trimble, Capt. Novak, and Lt. Rivera that the statements were coming from Mr.\nCockerham, when they actually came from Col. Hess.\n\n         Joseph Libbey stated in his contracting officer’s final decisions, and testified at\ntrial, that he believed that the contracts were terminated due to dumpster diving and\nrummaging through camp dumpsters, perhaps the latrine issue, and security reasons.\nIn Mr. Libbey’s final decision for the dumpster contract he stated: “On 9 October 2004,\nsix Gulf Group employees were detained for security violations involving traveling on\nCamp Arifjan without their required escort, and rummaging through a dumpster. At\nleast four of these individuals were barred from Camp Arifjan by Colonel Miller on 16\nand 18 October 2004.” The contractor allegedly involved in dumpster diving, however,\nwas Gulf Company, not Gulf Group. At trial, Mr. Libbey testified that he “took Gulf\nCompany to mean Gulf Group.” Mr. Libbey’s final decision on Gulf Group’s dumpster\ncontract also stated:\n\n       The Government originally contemplated terminating Gulf Group’s\n       contracts for failure to comply with security regulations; however, due to\n       the global war on terror operational tempo in the area, and a desire to\n       maintain a friendly working relationship with local contractors that often\n       include prominent Kuwaiti families, the Government decided to terminate\n       the contract for the convenience of the Government.34\n\n        According to Saud Al Tawash and Mr. Wilson, they first learned that Gulf Group’s\nlatrine and dumpster contracts and camp package BPA call were being terminated\nthrough their competitors. According to Saud Al Tawash, he first heard rumors about\nthe cancellations from an individual working with a competitor, Jasmine, who told him\n“they’re going to cancel all your contracts because they have a report of an intelligence\nthat you guys are related to terrorist groups and you’re anti-American.” Saud Al Tawash\nalso testified that Mr. Wilson was then told “directly from the contracting office” that\n34\n   Mr. Libbey testified that Mr. Randall Kemplin, a government civilian counsel who\nworked with Mr. Libbey on the claims, wrote the above quoted paragraph, which was\nincorporated into Mr. Libbey’s contracting officer’s final decision. Although Mr. Libbey\nwas not aware of how Mr. Kemplin had obtained the information, Mr. Libbey stated he\nwas “good with it.”\n\n                                            23\n\fthere was a “security” and a “counter intelligence concern,” and that the contracting\noffice alleged that the alleged security incident was the reason for the cancellations. At\ntrial, Saud Al Tawash also pointed out that the contracting officer, Mr. Libbey, made a\nfinal determination that the contracts were terminated due to the alleged security\nincident. Saud Al Tawash testified that Capt. Trimble, Capt. Novak, Lt. Rivera, and\nTijani Saani all told him that the contracts were terminated as a result of a concern for\nsecurity. Saud Al Tawash also indicated that he had heard that the promised award of\nCamp Virginia had been put on hold, with the possibility of cancellation, due to the\nsecurity concerns.\n\n        According to testimony offered by Mr. Wilson, on October 17 or 18, 2004, he\nspoke with Mr. Cockerham, Tijani Saani, and Col. Hess about the Gulf Group\ncancellations and prepared a report about those discussions. Mr. Wilson testified that\nMr. Cockerham told him that the cancellations were coming from above him at “the\ngeneral level.” Mr. Wilson also stated that Col. Hess told him that the cancellations had\nto do with security and counterintelligence, and that the Army Support Group\ncommander made the decision to cancel. According to Mr. Wilson, Tijani Saani told him\nthat they were cancelling all of Gulf Group’s contracts for security reasons, but that\n“we’ll try to get you guys some work.” Mr. Wilson also spoke to Col. Hess over the\ntelephone. Mr. Wilson stated Col. Hess did not want to talk to him, and was “really\nnervous, talking in circles.” According to Mr. Wilson, Col. Hess stated during this\ntelephone call that Gulf Group’s contracts were terminated due to “counterintelligence\non the Al Tawash family, and they have ties [to] Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein.” Mr.\nWilson also heard someone comment that Gulf Group was a “bunch of kids” and\nneeded to be “taken out,” although he could not remember if he heard this from an Army\nofficer or from one of Gulf Group’s competitors.\n\n        Col. Khalid Al Salal, a retired intelligence officer for the Kuwait Ministry of\nDefense, who had left the ministry, but maintained communication with the security and\nintelligence office, testified as a witness for plaintiff and stated that Gulf Group, Gulf\nTelecom, and Saud Al Tawash were all cleared by Kuwaiti security and passed\nbackground checks. Col. Al Salal further testified that the Al Tawash family is very well-\nknown in Kuwait, and that he had never heard of any links between the Al Tawash\nfamily and the Taliban, Saddam Hussein, or other anti-American groups. Maj. Petty\nsimilarly testified that he never heard that Gulf Group was suspected of having\nconnections with the Taliban. Mr. Cockerham testified that he heard a number of\nrumors about Gulf Group’s involvement with the Taliban and other similar groups, which\nhe believed were not true.\n\n       Ferdinand Peters, the attorney retained by Gulf Group in October 2004, testified\nthat he met separately with Col. Hess, Col. Miller, Mr. Cockerham, and Tijani Saani, and\nwas given “a variety of reasons” by “everyone” for the termination of Gulf Group’s latrine\nand dumpster contracts and camp package BPA call. Mr. Peters testified that “I can\nonly say that there were multiple reasons given.” Mr. Peters indicated that he was “told\nabout security problems, and words had come up in various discussions as connections\nto terrorists, cell phone use, personnel of Gulf Group asking questions and being a\n\n\n                                           24\n\fsecurity threat, or whatever. Things like that.” Mr. Peters recalled that, in his meeting\nwith Col. Miller, Col. Miller had “mentioned” the latrine incident to Mr. Peters, and may\nhave indicated that Gulf Group was suspected of being allied with anti-American\ninterests. Mr. Peters could not “remember exactly what was stated,” but indicated that\n“[i]t was so serious of what we were being told that efforts were being made by the\nfamily to figure out through Congressional action and like that on what was going on\nhere.”\n\n       After speaking with Mr. Wilson and hearing rumors from his competitors, Saud Al\nTawash contacted Congressman Trent Franks, who was “an old family friend,” to\ninquire on Gulf Group’s behalf about rumors of Al Tawash family links to anti-American\ngroups because “it was hurting our family reputation.” According to Saud Al Tawash,\nCongressman Franks called Col. Miller, Col. Hess, Tijani Saani, and Mr. Cockerham to\n“restore my family’s reputation” and to “chat with the right people from in the upper\nchannels at the military to find out if this is truth [sic].” In an October 27, 2004 email\naddressed to Gen. Keith Alexander and Gen. Steven Whitcomb, Congressman Franks\nstated: “I am respectfully asking the military command to issue a letter stating\ncategorically that the cancellation of the subject contracts was in no way related to any\ncounterintelligence, espionage, or security concern connected to the Al-Tawash family\nor the Gulf Group.” Gen. Whitcomb forwarded the email to Col. Miller, Col. Richard\nMcEvoy, and Col. Louis Yuengert, requesting a status update. Col. McEvoy responded\nthat the letter had been taken care of by the Army. Col. Miller recalled receiving a\ntelephone call from Congressman Franks about the Al Tawash family, followed shortly\nby a telephone call from Gen. Alexander on the same subject. Col. Hess testified that\nhe did “not remember being called by Congressman Franks.” On November 3, 2004,\nCol. Hess was directed, he assumed by Col. Miller,35 to write a letter to Mohammed Al\n35\n     Col. Hess’ testimony at trial was as follows:\n\n         Q: Looking at Exhibit 147, this being a letter from the Department of the\n         Army dated November 3, 2004 to Mohammed Al Tawash, with what\n         purports to be your signature. Is that indeed your signature?\n\n         A: Yes, it is.\n\n         Q: Did anyone order you to write this letter?\n\n         A: I don’t remember, but I wrote the letter so I presume I was directed to\n         write the letter.\n                                             …\n\n         Q: Do you recall receiving a direct order commanding you to write the\n         letter, or did someone simply ask if you might accommodate them by\n         writing the letter?\n\n         A: Instead of saying yes or no, can I explain my recollection of the letter?\n\n\n                                               25\n\fTawash about the cancellation of Gulf Group’s latrine contract, which, according to\nSaud Al Tawash, was drafted in response to Congressman Franks’ inquiries. Saud Al\nTawash testified that he did not know why the letter from Col. Hess was addressed to\nhis brother, Mohammed Al Tawash. The letter stated, in pertinent part:\n\n       Please rest assured that the Gulf Group’s contract to service portable\n       latrines at Army camps in Kuwait was not terminated because of security\n       reasons. While it is true that some employees of the Gulf Group have\n       been either barred from the installation or warned because they had not\n       followed the rules for contract employees on the installation, these\n       incidents did not cause the termination of the contract.\n\n       The contracting officer terminated the contract because circumstances\n       arose that caused the contracting officer to conclude that it was in the best\n       interest of the Army to terminate the contract. Since the contract was\n       terminated for convenience of the government, the Gulf Group should not\n       suffer any repercussions to its reputation or competitive standing. The\n       Gulf Group is fully eligible to compete for other Army contracts in Kuwait.\n       I hope this clarifies this unfortunate misunderstanding.\n\n       Col. Hess further testified that “Colonel Miller actually wanted to author a letter to\nsend to the Al Tawash family and I recommended against that, that this was a\ncontractual issue and any such letter ought to be coming from the contracting office.”\nAccording to Col. Hess, the security and espionage concerns about Gulf Group “turned\nout to be unfounded,” but the statement in the letter that Gulf Group’s latrine contract\n“was not terminated because of security reasons” was “false.” In other words, based on\nCol. Hess’ testimony, Gulf Group was terminated for security reasons, but those same\nsecurity concerns later turned out to be unfounded. Also according to Col. Hess, the\n\n       Q: Please do. Yes, sir.\n\n       A: My recollection of the letter was we went through all the security stuff,\n       all the concerns about espionage in the previous few exhibits we went\n       through, and it turned out to be unfounded. This is my recollection. As\n       such, we still had a viable contractor that we could do business with. The\n       purpose of this letter was to put Gulf Group on notice that we still would\n       like to consider them to do Army contracting, to engage, to bid on Army\n       requirements in the future.\n\n       Q: Who directed you to send this letter?\n\n       A: I don’t recall specifics.\n\n       Q: It was Colonel Brick Miller, wasn’t it?\n\n       A: I’m going to have to make the assumption that it was the ASG, Colonel\n       Miller. He was my primary customer.\n\n                                             26\n\fstatement that some Gulf Group employees had been barred was, likewise, untrue and\ninaccurate based on his recollections, but he had obtained that information to insert into\nthe letter from Col. Miller. Col. Hess indicated that he also had help from the ASG\nJudge Advocate General’s office when composing the November 3, 2004 letter, but did\nnot identify by name any individuals who aided him.\n\nBottled Water Delays\n\n       Gulf Group’s bottled water BPA calls were not cancelled at the time of the\nOctober 2004 terminations of the camp package BPA call, the latrine contract, and the\ndumpster contract, and Gulf Group continued to supply bottled water to the Army under\nthe bottled water BPA in 2005. According to the parties’ joint stipulation of facts,\nbetween November 1, 2004 and March 31, 2005, United States government contractors\nsupplying bottled water in Iraq were required to travel in military convoys. The convoy\nrequirement was issued to ensure the prompt delivery of bottled water and for the\nprotection of personnel and supplies. During this time period, all of Gulf Group’s\ndeliveries of bottled water to camps in Iraq were made by trucks traveling to and from\nIraq and Kuwait with military convoys. The trucks were delayed at times for a number of\nreasons, including IEDs and observance of religious holidays by Iraqi nationals. The\nparties have jointly stipulated that “[a]dditionally, the delays occasionally were caused\nby the Government not having sufficient escorts.” According to Saud Al Tawash, most\nGulf Group trucks going into Iraq around April 2005 were delayed more than a week.\n\n       Saud Al Tawash testified that, pursuant to Gulf Group’s bottled water BPA, Gulf\nGroup was required to contact certain Army officials to obtain delivery instructions. The\nbottled water BPA refers to these requirements as “Special Instructions,” which state in\npart:\n\n      Purchased For: US Army Various Locations in Kuwait and Iraq. Surface\n      to some of the locations are unimproved which could cause delays in\n      deliveries. Contractor shall do everything possible to ensure deliveries are\n      made on time. The contractor is liable for all equipment and personnel\n      necessary to deliver to the proper quantities. The US Military is not liable\n      for damages caused to transportation assets or equipment necessary to\n      deliver the items.\n\n      Personnel to contact for directions and acess [sic] to various locations are\n      as follows:\n\n      MAJ Banks:36 968-4819\n      CPT Sharp:37 970-5952\n\n36\n  According to the parties’ joint stipulation of facts, “Major Banks was the chief of the\nbottled water branch until October 2004, when she was replaced by LTC Derrick\nShoemake,” who was the chief of the bottled water branch at Camp Arifjan during April\n2005.\n\n                                           27\n\f       Saud Al Tawash further testified that the Army officers gave Gulf Group convoy\nnumbers, which he understood to be a requirement that Gulf Group travel in convoys.\nAccording to Mr. Wilson, at a post-award vendor meeting attended by Lt. Col. Derrick L.\nShoemake, chief of the bottled water branch at Camp Arifjan, Mr. Cockerham, and Sgt.\nDiane Brooks, all the bottled water contractors were told that they were required to\nmove in convoys. Also at the post-award vendor meeting, Mr. Wilson was told to follow\nthe instructions to travel with convoys given by Lt. Col. Shoemake and Sgt. Brooks. Mr.\nWilson stated that contractors could hire private protection, but that even then they\nwould have had to coordinate transportation with the Army. Mr. Wilson explained that\nGulf Group could not have transported the water without the military convoys because\nthere was significant fear over the physical safety of the water and potential biological\nadditives, such that “if you showed up at a front gate of an army base unescorted with\ntruck loads of water, you’re probably going to be shot.” Mr. Wilson also testified that\nrules and regulations were posted on a wall at Camp Navistar, a convoy consolidation\npoint in Kuwait, specifying that trucks “must stay in convoy, they must be escorted all\ntimes.”\n\n       Lt Col. Mary O’Connor, a battalion commander and chief of transportation\nresponsible for the movement of control teams at convoy support centers throughout\nIraq in 2004 and 2005, testified that all trucks in Iraq were required to move in military\nconvoys, and that she knew this to be the case because she was in charge of this\nprocess. Lt. Col. O’Connor identified a specific “fragmentary order” (FRAGO) as the\ndocument requiring all vehicles used in support of the military to travel in convoys. The\nFRAGO provides:\n\n      The purpose of this FRAGO is to enhance and convoy [sic] security\n      measures to protect the force by providing convoy commanders and unit\n      commanders tools to ensure that all measures have been properly taken\n      to safeguard personnel and equipment. Unit/convoy commanders are\n      personally responsible for the conduct and protection of convoy\n      operations. MNF-I units will monitor their convoys, and exercises control\n      measures implemented by unit commanders.\n\n      3.C. (U) Tasks to Subordinate Unites. [sic]\n\n      3.C.1.

There will be two vehicles minimum during daylight hours, and\n         three vehicles minimum during the hours of darkness. There will be at\n         least two soldiers per vehicle and three in the trail vehicle to provide a\n         turret or rear gunner for tactical vehicle movements.\n\n         3.D.2. Non-tactical vehicle (NTV) movements used to transport\n         military members, DOD civilians, and DOD contractors are cautioned\n         not to move outside secure zones without security as set forth by\n         MSC38 commanders. As far as practical use armored/add on armored\n         commercial vehicles to move off FOBS. The use and number of NTVS to\n         support movement requirements is delegated to the MS[] commanders.\n         However, the number of NTVs used should consider current AIF TTPS,\n         emergency cross loading of personnel requirements and safety. NTVs will\n         posses [sic] communication IAW Para 5.A.2. below, and have\n         communication with the security escort.\n\n         3.D.3. Convoy commanders are responsible for the self-protection\n         capability within their convoy. There will be at least one rifle in each\n         vehicle for all movements. Tactical vehicle movements must have 360\n         degree security consisting of an M249 or above from the turret or out the\n         back with the “canvas” removed. All military personnel will carry personal\n         weapons, wear fragmentation protective vest, ballistic eye protection, and\n         combat helmet. A minimum of one vehicle will maintain communications\n         contact with coalition forces. Convoys will not have lights on during\n         daylight operations. During night operations white lights will be used, and\n         they will have NVDS in each vehicle.\n\n         3.D.4. Prior to all movements, convoy commanders will conduct\n         coordination and include communications equipment sufficient to\n         communicate with other MSCS when traveling through their AOR.\n         Advanced notification to other MSCS will minimize potential fratricide of\n         blue on blue forces. All vehicles must log out with parent unit and provide\n         ETA to destination. All vehicles must report at destination to their parent\n         unit.\n\n         3.D.5. Breakdown procedures, convoy commanders are responsible for\n         self-recovery capability within each convoy. Recovery equipment will be\n         available to each convoy. Commanders will take all reasonable measures\n         to recover vehicles and will abandon vehicles as last resort only. They will\n         recover the vehicle to the nearest CSO or LSA if possible. If not, leave\n         appropriate security personnel and an operational vehicle with it until it\n         can be recovered.\n\n         3.D.6. All MSCS will report deteriorating road conditions to MNCI, upon\n         reporting to convoy support center operations cell(s), convoy commanders\n38\n     It appears that MSC stands for Major Subordinate Command.\n\n                                             29\n\f       will report locations where maintenance is required and where engineer\n       work could mitigate areas of vulnerability.\n\n       3.D.7.

All soldiers\n       operating or riding in tactical and NTV vehicles must wear regulation gear\n       as stated in paragraph 3.D.3. above.\n\n        The FRAGO does not specifically refer to government contractors. Lt. Col.\nO’Connor testified, albeit inconsistently, that it was understood that, if a contractor was\nsupporting the military, it was “assumed in the order that they would – that we would\nprotect them.” Nevertheless, Lt. Col. O’Connor testified that the language “DOD\ncontractors are cautioned not to move outside secure zones without security as set forth\nby MSC commanders. As far as practical use armored/add on armored commercial\nvehicles to move off FOBS,” was a recommendation, rather than an order, until a more\nstringent order was delivered. Lt. Col. O’Connor also testified that she had not seen a\nmore stringent order. She then stated that the existing order was intended to require\ncivilian contractors to travel in military convoys. Lt. Col. O’Connor also testified that\nthere were no exceptions to this convoy requirement, however, she conceded that some\ncontractors violated the convoy requirement. She also acknowledged that the Army\ncould not control the travel of all civilians. Although her testimony regarding the number\nof days of travel time between Kuwait and Iraq was inconsistent, she did indicate,\nhowever, perfect travel conditions were rare in Iraq at the time.\n\n       Regarding the cause of the bottled water transportation delays, Saud Al Tawash\nstated that, having been to the border between Kuwait and Iraq, he had personal\nknowledge of Gulf Group trucks delayed at the border due to insufficient escorts, which\nwas “the only cause” of delay. He stated, however, that he did not travel with the Gulf\nGroup trucks beyond the border to deliver the water into Iraq. According to Saud Al\nTawash, it was Lt. Col. Shoemake and KBR, another contractor, through whom Saud Al\nTawash learned that the truck delays in Iraq were caused by lack of escorts. Mr. Wilson\nstated that he had learned from the truck drivers that the delays in the delivery of bottled\nwater were caused by “security and the lack of escorts,” as well as convoy priorities. He\n\n\n                                            30\n\ffurther indicated the delays were also caused by IEDs and accidents. Mr. Wilson also\ntestified that Gulf Group trucks were being delayed at the bases because they also were\nbeing used to store water and to haul military equipment on their return trips, despite\nGulf Group’s contract and arrangement with the trucking company that there only would\nbe one-way hauls. Neither Saud Al Tawash nor Mr. Wilson, personally, were on board\nthe trucks that delivered bottled water for Gulf Group into Iraq.\n\n        Megbel Al Tawash testified that he knew from project managers and from\ncoordinating with Expeditors, the company Gulf Group had hired to transport the bottled\nwater, that the lack of escorts “was the main problem” Gulf Group experienced with the\ndelivery of bottled water to Iraq. Megbel Al Tawash further stated that he personally\nobserved Gulf Group trucks used by the military to haul equipment, specifically\nHumvees, on return trips from Iraq. Lt. Col. O’Connor agreed that it was “quite\npossible” that bottled water trucks coming back from Iraq into Kuwait were loaded with\nmilitary equipment. Mr. Cockerham testified that “quite often what they would do is put\nequipment on the trucks that were designated just for carrying water,” and that he\nbelieved Gulf Group’s bottled water trucks were being used to haul military equipment\non the return trips. Mr. Cockerham stated that there was no agreement between the\nbottled water contractors and the government to use the bottled water trucks for hauling\nmilitary equipment on return trips. The parties also have stipulated that, “[t]here was no\nagreement between Gulf Group and the Government to use some or all of Gulf Group’s\ntrucks that delivered bottled water to camps in Iraq, to transport military equipment back\nto Kuwait on their return trips from Iraq.” The Army had another contract in place to\ntake equipment out of Iraq, but it apparently was not always used.\n\n       Due to the acknowledged delays in the delivery of bottled water, the government\noffered to increase the amount it was paying to the bottled water contractors to cover\ndemurrage charges. Between November 1, 2004 and March 31, 2005, Gulf Group\ncharged 2.400 KD per case for bottled water. The parties stipulated, “[o]n April 5, 2005,\na contracting officer, John Cockerham, submitted a proposal to all contractors supplying\nbottled water to camps in Iraq to increase the price of the bottled water to 2.578 KD per\ncase, in exchange for the contractors not charging the Government for additional\nexpenses including demurrage incurred in the deliveries.” Mr. Cockerham’s email\nstated: “All previous claims prior to APR 05 will continue to be processed.” According to\nthe parties’ joint stipulation of facts, Gulf Group received, and accepted, the proposal of\nthe higher rate per case in exchange for not making any more claims for demurrage\nincurred after April 1, 2005.\n\nPlaintiff’s Submissions and Claims\n\n      On December 15, 2005, Gulf Group submitted a claim under the bottled water\nBPA for 298,435.000 KD in demurrage for delays incurred between November 2004\nand March 2005 to Mr. Cockerham, who was the contract specialist for the bottled water\nBPA in Kuwait.39 The following day, December 16, 2005, Gulf Group submitted three\n39\n   The KD value later was calculated to be equivalent to $1,035,802.23 in plaintiff’s\noriginal complaint in the bottled water case, Case No. 07-82C, and $1,065,711.39 in its\n\n                                            31\n\f“Claim & Settlement Offers”40 to Mr. Cockerham, proposing settlement in the amount of\n$4,544,339.84 for the termination of the camp package BPA call, in the amount of\n$4,558,428.60 for the termination of the latrine contract, and in the amount of\n$999,994.67 for the termination of the dumpster contract.41 The 2005 Claim and\nSettlement Offers also asserted that Gulf Group was entitled to $10,000,000.00 for the\ntermination of the camp package BPA call, $5,058,428.5942 for the termination of the\nlatrine contract, and $1,110,621.72 for the termination of the dumpster contract. Saud\nAl Tawash signed the cover letter to Gulf Group’s four submissions to Mr. Cockerham in\n2005, and all four submissions were certified by plaintiff’s attorney at the time,\nFerdinand Peters.\n\n       On October 19, 2006, the Camp Arifjan contracting office files were searched,\nbut there was no record of Gulf Group’s December 15 and 16, 2005 submissions. Gulf\nGroup then re-submitted the same Claim and Settlement Offers between October 20,\n2006 and October 22, 2006, and the submissions were put on the contracting command\nlog. Mr. Cockerham testified that he had received the 2005 latrine and dumpster Claim\nand Settlement Offers twice, and that he does not know if Gulf Group’s initial\nsubmissions were logged, although they would have been placed in a box in the\ncontracting office. Although not clearly referring to plaintiff’s 2006 resubmissions, Mr.\nCockerham also testified that he made minimal efforts to ensure that Gulf Group’s Claim\n\nsecond amended complaint in the bottled water case. In plaintiff’s first amended\ncomplaint in the bottled water case, plaintiff simply listed the amount as 298,435.000 KD\nwithout a USD equivalent.\n40\n   As indicated below, it is not immediately clear that the 2005 submissions relating to\nthe terminations of the camp package BPA call, the latrine contract, and the dumpster\ncontract, constituted “claims” under the Contract Disputes Act. Defendant’s post-trial\nbriefs generically refer to plaintiff’s 2005 submissions as “claims,” but defendant initially\nargued that the Claim and Settlement Offers did not constitute claims under the\nContract Disputes Act. In discussing plaintiff’s submissions with respect to the court’s\njurisdiction under the Contract Disputes Act, therefore, the court distinguishes between\nthe “Claim and Settlement Offers” that plaintiff submitted in 2005, and the “claims” that\nplaintiff submitted in 2007 and 2011. The court includes the 2005 Claim and Settlement\nOffers in general references to “claims” elsewhere in this opinion, however, because the\n2005 submissions constitute claims in other contexts, such as under the False Claims\nAct. See 48 C.F.R. § 49.001 (2005) (“A settlement proposal is included within the\ngeneric meaning of the word ‘claim’ under false claims acts (see 18 U.S.C. 287 and 31\nU.S.C. 3729).”).\n41\n  The parties’ joint stipulation of facts lists plaintiff’s 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer as\nseeking $5,058,428.59. That is the full amount that plaintiff claimed it was owed, but\nplaintiff’s submission offered to settle for $4,558,428.60.\n42\n  In calculating plaintiff’s claimed entitlement to $5,058,428.59, plaintiff’s 2005 Claim\nand Settlement Offer appears to have used a different conversion rate between KD and\nUSD than the rate stipulated to by the parties.\n\n                                             32\n\fand Settlement Offers were processed, indicating that the “[o]nly thing I really remember\ndoing was just notifying the chief that this was the second time....”\n\n       The record is unclear as to whether the government ever reviewed plaintiff’s\n2005 Claim and Settlement Offers. Mr. Cockerham, however, confirmed at trial that he\nwrote the notations on the Claim and Settlement Offers that appear in the record\nrelating to the camp package BPA call, the latrine contract, and the dumpster contract,\nindicating that the Claim and Settlement Offers in the record are the Claim and\nSettlement Offers that Mr. Cockerham received on December 16, 2005, rather than the\ncopies of the Claim and Settlement Offers that plaintiff re-submitted between October\n20, 2006 and October 22, 2006. Although raising more questions than it addressed, Mr.\nLibbey’s contracting officer’s final decision for plaintiff’s 2007 camp package BPA claim\nattempted to explain what had happened to the 2005 Claim and Settlement Offers,\nstating:\n\n      The settlement offer [for the camp package BPA] was one of three\n      termination packages Major Cockerham allegedly received from Mr.\n      Surresh Pulikkal [sic] of Gulf Group43 in October 2005. Major Cockerham\n      allegedly signed for the three settlement proposals, and handed them off\n      to the Claims Section in the contracting office. These matters are\n      “alleged” as the Government has no evidence to establish these events\n      actually occurred. Major Cockerham and Gloria Davis, the awarding\n      contracting officer, came under investigation for improper and illegal\n      contracting activity after the subject contract was awarded....\n\n      Gulf Group representatives returned to the Contracting Command in late\n      November 2005 and again in December 2005 to check on the status of\n      the settlement offer. No record could be found that it had been submitted,\n      so Mr. Surresh Pulikkal [sic] was asked to resubmit the settlement offer.\n      Mr. Pulikkal subsequently gave a settlement offer to Major Cockerham,\n      who signed for it acknowledging receipt....\n\n      Gulf Group Representatives Saud Al Tawash and Allen Tadayon met with\n      LTC David Pershing, Commander, United States Army Contracting\n      Command, Southwest Asia-Kuwait (USACC), Major Marcellus Newson,\n      Contracting Officer, and Captain Andrew Gast, Contracting Claims Officer,\n      both of USACC, on or about 19 October 2006 to discuss the following\n      topics.... Concern over an earlier termination for convenience.... Their\n      settlement offers....\n\n\n\n43\n  Although defendant has repeatedly described Suresh Pulikkal as a Gulf Group\nemployee, Saud Al Tawash testified that Suresh Pulikkal was a legal consultant for a\nnumber of the companies that Saud Al Tawash managed, describing him as “our legal\ncounsel…a legal consultant.” Mr. Cockerham also confirmed that Suresh Pulikkal\n“worked with several companies.”\n\n                                           33\n\f      Mr. Tadayon asked about the settlement offer Gulf Group had submitted,\n      inquiring about its status. Captain Gast was directed by LTC Pershing\n      during the meeting to check his files for its status. Captain Gast checked\n      his file log for disputes and reported there was no record of any settlement\n      offers being filed by Gulf Group....\n\n      Captain Gast checked with other members of the Claims Team on 20\n      October 2006, specifically asking Major Paul Bidinger, Contracting Claims\n      Officer, Third Army, U.S. ARCENT, about the Gulf Group’s inquiry. Major\n      Bidinger reported back to Captain Gast the same day that he could not\n      find Gulf Group’s name on the disputes lists....\n\n      On 22 October 2006, Gulf Group representative Allen Tadayon provided\n      Captain Gast with a copy of the settlement offer by email. Captain Gast\n      reviewed the documents briefly and noted they were missing the required\n      certification....\n\n      On 22 October 2006, Mr. Tadayon emailed three “certifications” signed by\n      Gulf Group’s counsel to Captain Ghast [sic].\n\n      On 15 November 2006, Mr. Tadayon requested an appointment with\n      Captain Gast to discuss the settlement offer. Captain Gast responded on\n      16 November 2006 that the only appointments he was making was for\n      current disputes and ratifications he was working on....\n\n      Mr. Tadayon communicated again with Captain Gast on or about 17\n      November 2006 concerning the status of the three settlement offers.\n      Captain Gast stated he had not yet begun to work on them. This was the\n      last communication Captain Gast had with Gulf Group concerning its\n      documents.\n\n       It appears from Mr. Libbey’s summary of the events surrounding the submission\nof plaintiff’s 2005 Claim and Settlement Offers, and from Mr. Cockerham’s testimony\nregarding his receipt of plaintiff’s Claim and Settlement Offers, that plaintiff may also\nhave originally submitted the Claim and Settlement Offers to Mr. Cockerham in October\n2005, prior to the December 16, 2005 submissions in the record. That plaintiff\npreviously submitted the camp package BPA, latrine contract, and dumpster contract\nClaim and Settlement Offers is consistent with the October 2005 date that appears on\nthe cover letters to each submission.\n\n       Plaintiff interpreted the lack of a response to its 2005 submissions for almost a\nyear to be a deemed denial of its “claims” pursuant to 41 U.S.C. §§ 605(c)(1), (c)(3)\n(2005) (current versions at 41 U.S.C. § 7103(f)(1), (f)(3) (Supp. V 2011)).44 Based on\n44\n   In Case No. 06-835C, the camp package BPA case, plaintiff asserts that the sixty\ndays under 41 U.S.C. § 605 began to run on October 10, 2005. In Case No. 06-853C,\nthe dumpster case, plaintiff asserts that the sixty days began to run on October 20,\n\n                                           34\n\fthis perceived denial of its “claims,” Gulf Group ultimately filed the four suits which are\ncurrently consolidated before this court. The parties stipulated that, “[o]n December 8,\n2006, Gulf Group commenced [the camp package BPA case in the United States Court\nof Federal Claims] seeking $7,000,000.00, plus interest, costs, and attorney fees arising\nfrom the contracting officer’s deemed denial of its claim” for the cancellation of the camp\npackage BPA call. The parties also stipulated that, “[o]n December 15, 2006, Gulf\nGroup commenced [the latrine case in the United States Court of Federal Claims]\nseeking $6,000,000, plus interest, costs, and attorney fees arising from the termination”\nof the latrine contract. The parties further stipulated that, “[o]n December 19, 2006, Gulf\nGroup commenced [the dumpster case in the United States Court of Federal Claims]\nseeking $1,800,000, plus interest, costs, and attorney fees arising from the cancellation”\nof the dumpster contract. Finally, the parties stipulated that, “[o]n February 1, 2007,\nGulf Group commenced [the bottled water case in the United States Court of Federal\nClaims] seeking $1,035,802.23, plus interest, costs, and attorney fees arising from calls\nissued pursuant to” the bottled water BPA.\n\n        In the camp package BPA case, the latrine case, the dumpster case, and the\nbottled water BPA case, defendant requested that the judges initially assigned to each\ncase stay the proceedings in each case because defendant believed, with respect to\neach Claim and Settlement Offer, “that plaintiff’s submission constitute[d] a ‘termination\nsettlement offer,’” rather than a “claim” under the Contract Disputes Act, which,\naccording to defendant, deprived this court of jurisdiction over plaintiff’s complaints.\nThe judges initially assigned to the camp package BPA case, the latrine case, and the\ndumpster case, each agreed to stay the cases pending a decision by the contracting\nofficer on each of plaintiff’s “claims.”45 On March 26, 2007, Gulf Group presented\n“revised” claims to the contracting officer, certified by plaintiff’s replacement attorney,\nand current attorney of record, Ms. Iliaura Hands, for $7,000,000.00, $1,800,000.00,\nand $6,000,000.00, arising from the camp package BPA, the latrine contract, and the\ndumpster contract, respectively.46 In addition, Ms. Hands signed the cover letter to all of\n\n2005. In Case No. 06-858C, the latrine case, plaintiff references two dates, October 17,\n2005 and December 16, 2005, from which the sixty days could have run. In Case No.\n07-82C, the bottled water BPA case, plaintiff asserts that the agency’s sixty days began\nto run on December 15, 2005.\n45\n   The undersigned judge denied defendant’s request to stay the bottled water BPA\ncase. The bottled water BPA case did not involve a termination for convenience. With\nrespect to the 2005 bottled water BPA Claim and Settlement Offer, the language that\nplaintiff used in requesting a decision, and the context in which plaintiff’s submission\nwas made, indicated that plaintiff had asserted a “claim” under the Contract Disputes\nAct. The undersigned judge, however, subsequently stayed all four of the consolidated\ncases at the request of the United States Department of Justice because of related\nongoing criminal investigations and prosecutions.\n46\n   In its pleadings to the court, plaintiff submitted a different version of the revised claim\nfor the dumpster contract than the version of the revised claim that was admitted at trial.\nAlthough the differences between the versions are minimal, this discrepancy is one of\n\n                                             35\n\fthe revised claims. Each revised claim included a copy of the relevant 2005 Claim and\nSettlement Offer, which contained a cover letter that was signed by Saud Al Tawash,\nand which was certified by plaintiff’s previous attorney, Ferdinand Peters.\n\n       On May 21, 2007, Joseph Libbey reviewed Gulf Group’s revised claims and\nissued final decisions on the revised camp package BPA, latrine contract, and dumpster\ncontract claims. Mr. Libbey awarded Gulf Group $33,053.57, $149,285.71, and\n$57,833.00, plus interest, for its camp package BPA, latrine contract, and dumpster\ncontract claims, respectively. The parties stipulated that “Mr. Libbey did not interview\nanyone in preparation of the final decisions.” Randall Kemplin, a civilian attorney for the\nArmy, wrote portions of the final decision from information he received from Army\nattorney Clea Efthimiadis, who, in turn, obtained information on the terminations of Gulf\nGroup’s contracts from Col. Brick Miller, Tijani Saani, and Mr. Cockerham.47\n\n        After Mr. Libbey issued his contracting officer’s final decisions, Gulf Group filed\namended complaints before this court in each of the three cases he addressed, the\ncamp package BPA and the latrine and dumpster contracts. The original complaint in\nthe bottled water BPA case was also subsequently amended. In its amended\ncomplaints, plaintiff altered the amounts sought in each case, except the bottled water\nBPA case, the only case on which Mr. Libbey did not issue a contracting officer’s final\ndecision. In its original complaint in Case No. 06-835C, the camp package BPA case,\nplaintiff sought $7,000,000.00. In its first amended complaint in the camp package BPA\ncase, plaintiff sought $2,682,160.86.48 In its second amended complaint in the camp\npackage BPA case, plaintiff sought $3,463,287.57.49 Subsequently, in its third\n\n\n\n\nnumerous deficiencies in plaintiff’s submissions to the court. Additionally, as discussed\nbelow with respect to the dumpster contract, the copy of Saud Al Tawash’s signature\npage from the 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer is dated October 20, 2004.\n47\n Ms. Efthimiadis testified that she did not contact Col. Hess regarding plaintiff’s claims.\nWhen questioned, Ms. Efthimiadis stated:\n\n      I was in the middle of starting the litigation report, I did not complete the\n      litigation report. I did not interview all the witnesses or take even written\n      statements from them as is required in [sic] litigation report. The uptempo\n      in Kuwait was tremendous, the workload was tremendous at that time.\n48\n   Plaintiff sought $1,447,457.22 in lost profits, $1,234,703.64 in preparatory expenses,\nlegal fees, costs incurred in preparing a settlement of plaintiff’s claims, and interest.\n49\n   Plaintiff sought $3,387,247.64 in lost profits, $69,002.43 in preparatory expenses,\n$7,037.50 in fees and costs incurred in preparing the settlement for plaintiff’s claims,\nprejudgment interest, cost of litigation, and attorneys’ fees.\n\n\n                                            36\n\famended complaint in the camp package BPA case, plaintiff now seeks $922,851.84.50\nIn 2011, plaintiff submitted a second revised claim for the camp package BPA to Maj.\nDaniel Everett,51 which mirrored the amounts plaintiff claimed in its third amended\ncomplaint. In its original complaint in Case No. 06-858C, the latrine case, plaintiff\nsought $6,000,000.00. In its first amended complaint in the latrine case, plaintiff sought\n1,572,967.611 KD.52 In its second amended complaint in the latrine case, plaintiff now\nseeks $2,830,662.20.53 In its original complaint in Case No. 06-853C, the dumpster\ncase, plaintiff sought $1,800,000.00. In its first amended complaint in the dumpster\ncase, plaintiff sought $1,946,721.78.54 In its second amended complaint in the\ndumpster case, plaintiff now seeks $780,031.63.55 In its original complaint in Case No.\n07-82C, the bottled water BPA case, plaintiff sought 298,435.000 KD, calculated as\n$1,035,802.23. In its first amended complaint in the bottled water BPA case, plaintiff\nsought 298,435.000 KD. In its second amended complaint in the bottled water BPA\ncase, plaintiff now seeks 298,435.000 KD, calculated as $1,065,711.39, for demurrage\nand related expenses.56\n\n    The total potential contract prices and the amounts claimed by Gulf Group can be\nsummarized as follows:\n50\n   Plaintiff seeks $846,811.91 in lost profits, $69,002.43 in preparatory expenses,\n$7,037.50 in fees and other costs, prejudgment interest, costs of litigation and attorneys’\nfees.\n51\n   Contrary to plaintiff’s assertion that the judge directed plaintiff to submit a revised\nclaim to Maj. Everett, a member of the Army JAG Corps assisting defendant, the court\ndirected plaintiff to file revisions to any of the complaints filed in the four above-\ncaptioned cases, if appropriate.\n52\n   Plaintiff sought 1,416,360.000 KD in lost profits, 156,607.611 KD in preparatory\nexpenses, legal fees, costs incurred in preparing a settlement of plaintiff’s claims, and\ninterest. Plaintiff did not convert the amount to USD.\n53\n   Plaintiff seeks $2,724,795.96 in lost profits, $91,978.74 in preparatory expenses,\n$13,887.50 in fees and other costs, plus prejudgment interest, costs of litigation and\nattorneys’ fees.\n54\n   Plaintiff sought $1,457,619.72 in lost profits, $489,102.06 in preparatory expenses,\nlegal fees, costs incurred in preparing the settlement of the claims, and interest.\n55\n   Plaintiff asserts in its second amended complaint in the dumpster case that it seeks\n$780,131.63, but the total of the various amounts listed by plaintiff is only $780,031.63.\nPlaintiff seeks $483,322.42 in lost profits, $282,871.71 for preparatory expenses,\n$13,837.50 for fees and other costs, prejudgment interest, costs of litigation and\nattorneys’ fees.\n56\n  It appears that plaintiff’s original complaint used a different currency conversion rate\nthan the currency conversion rate stipulated to by the parties.\n\n                                            37\n\fBPA/Contract         Maximum          2005 Claim &        2007 Claim     2011 Claim      Original      Additional\n                   Potential Price   Settlement Offer                                   Complaint      Complaints\n\nCamp               BPA Limit:        Claimed             $7,000,000.00   $922,851.84   $7,000,000.00   1st Amended:\nPackage            $10,000,000.00    Entitlement:                                                      $2,682,160.86\n                                     $10,000,000.0057\n                   Call Limit:                                                                         2d Amended:\n                   $7,000,000.00     Settlement Offer:                                                 $3,463,287.57\n                                     $4,544,339.84\n                   Call 0001                                                                           3d Amended:\n                   Price:                                                                              $922,851.84\n                   $1,447,457.22\n\nLatrine            Total:            Claimed             $6,000,000.00   N/A           $6,000,000.00   1st Amended:\n                   $5,057,895.14     Entitlement:                                                      1,572,967.611\n                                     $5,058,428.59                                                     KD\n                   Base Period:\n                   $613,142.86       Settlement Offer:                                                 2d Amended:\n                                     $4,558,428.60                                                     $2,830,662.20\n\n\nDumpster           Total:            Claimed             $1,800,000.00   N/A           $1,800,000.00   1st Amended:\n                   $1,457,619.72     Entitlement:                                                      $1,946,721.78\n                                     $1,110,621.7258\n                   Base Period:                                                                        2d Amended:\n                   $346,998.00       Settlement Offer:                                                 $780,031.63\n                                     $999,994.67\n\nBottled Water      BPA Limit:        298,435 KD          N/A             N/A           298,435 KD      1st Amended:\n                   $10,000,000.00                                                      calculated at   298,435 KD\n                                                                                       $1,035,802.23\n                   Call Limit:                                                                         2d Amended:\n                   $7,000,000.00                                                                       298,435 KD\n                                                                                                       calculated at\n                                                                                                       $1,065,711.39\n\n          57\n             Mr. Peters testified that he did not remember if the 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer\n          for the camp package BPA claimed entitlement to $10,000,000.00, but later testified that\n          the 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer did not claim entitlement to $10,000,000.00,\n          guessing it claimed entitlement to $5,000,000.00. The only number that is referenced in\n          the Claim and Settlement Offer other than the amount of plaintiff’s settlement proposal\n          is the $10,000,000.00 figure. In this column, the court refers to the “claimed” amount as\n          the amount to which plaintiff stated it was entitled in the claim, other than the settlement\n          offer.\n          58\n            According to Mr. Peters, only the option periods were added to the dumpster contract\n          Claim and Settlement Offer, without the base period. The dumpster contract Claim and\n          Settlement Offer, however, asserted entitlement to the total contract price. Including the\n          base period, the amount to which plaintiff appeared to assert it was entitled was\n          $1,457,619.72.\n\n                                                          38\n\f       The 2005 Claim and Settlement Offers for the camp package BPA and latrine\nand dumpster contracts included settlement offers lower than the total amount to which\nGulf Group believed it was entitled, which, notwithstanding an apparent omission of the\nbase period price in the dumpster Claim and Settlement Offer, the Claim and Settlement\nOffers included the price of the base period and all option periods for the latrine and\ndumpster contracts. Gulf Group’s camp package BPA, latrine, and dumpster Claim and\nSettlement Offers described the total potential awards as “contract costs...added to the\nanticipated contract profit.”59 Saud Al Tawash indicated that he believed Gulf Group\nwould have performed the option periods on the latrine contract because Camp Arifjan\nwas permanent and there would be a need beyond the base period for Gulf Group’s\nservices. Saud Al Tawash further testified that Maj. Davis informed Gulf Group that, if\nthey performed well on the latrine contract, they would be completing the full potential\nperiod of the contract, including all of the option periods. Saud Al Tawash also\nexplained that he expected to perform the option periods of the latrine contract because\nthe capital expenditures necessary to acquire the materials and equipment needed to\nperform the contract would not have been covered by the base period alone.60\nAccording to Saud Al Tawash, he also understood the period of performance on the\ndumpster contract to be for three years because Maj. Davis told him Camp Arifjan was a\npermanent camp and that, if Gulf Group performed well, then they would have the\ncontract for the full three-year term, inclusive of the base period and all of the option\nperiods. When asked whether Gulf Group understood it was not guaranteed the option\nperiods, Saud Al Tawash explained on cross examination:\n\n        A: No, we didn’t understand if we were guaranteed -- to be given\n        guaranteed or not guaranteed? We did not understand that.\n\n        Q: What was Gulf Group’s understanding with regard to the option\n        period?\n\n        A: We had no understanding. We understood that this contract starts\n        from this day and finishes from this day. That was our understanding.\n\n\n\n59\n   At times, plaintiff appears to indicate in its post-trial briefs that it did not separately\nseek costs in its submissions to the contracting officer. Plaintiff’s 2005 Claim and\nSettlement Offers for the camp package BPA, the latrine contract, and the dumpster\ncontract, however, stated that “[t]his offer includes reimbursement for both costs and\nlost profits” and that “Gulf Enterprises should also be compensated fully for the costs\nincurred in furtherance of the contract.” In both its 2005 submissions to the contracting\nofficer and the 2006 complaints filed in this court, therefore, plaintiff sought lost profits\nand costs as a result of defendant’s alleged breach of the camp package BPA call, the\nlatrine contract, and the dumpster contract.\n60\n   As discussed below, plaintiff’s lost profits calculation indicates that plaintiff’s costs\nwould have exceeded its profits for the base period of the dumpster contract, rather\nthan the latrine contract.\n\n                                             39\n\f        Q: When you say start this date and ends this date, you’re talking about\n        the base period?\n\n        A: Talking about the contract overall period which is from A through Z, the\n        duration of the contract itself.\n\n        Q: Are you saying you didn’t understand that there were option periods in\n        the contract?\n\n        A: I believed that the understanding we had at that time was that the\n        contract is the contract in a normal sense, the base period. We did not\n        understand this options that reflect in like a contract within a contract.\n        We did not understand that. Now we are understanding that this is quite\n        different from our understanding from that time. In Kuwait most waste\n        management contracts are for three years, municipal. So this contract\n        being two to three years, we thought that this is the time that we have to\n        perform the contract.\n\n      An August 20, 2004 Memorandum titled, “Determination and Findings Use of\nOptions,” signed by Maj. Davis, stated:\n\n       Upon the basis of the following findings and determinations which I hereby\n       make, the Dumpster Service contract requires the use of options as\n       defined by FAR 17.202, Use of Options.... It is in the Government’s best\n       interest to include these options. There is an anticipated need for the\n       service beyond the contract period and the government risks potential\n       costs of disrupted support in re-competing the contract.... There is a\n       reasonable likelihood that the options will be exercised.\n\nThe memorandum was not circulated to contractors, including Gulf Group. At trial,\nSaud Al Tawash did not remember if he had seen the document before, but stated that\nit confirmed his understanding of what Maj. Davis had told him at the time of contract\naward.\n\n        Gulf Group’s first attorney, Ferdinand Peters, testified that he believed the Army\nowed Gulf Group for the option periods and included them in the 2005 Claim and\nSettlement Offers. Attorney Peters testified that his legal research indicated that plaintiff\nwas entitled to lost profits, and that he believed there was a sound basis for claiming\nlost profits for both the base periods and the option periods, without deducting expenses\nfor the base period or the option periods. Attorney Peters further stated that the lost\nprofits were the total contract price.61 Terry Carlson, an expert in government contract\n61\n  Under cross-examination, government counsel asked Mr. Peters, “you testified earlier\nthat you got the amount of lost profits by summing up the values that appeared in all\noption periods; is that right?” Mr. Peters replied: “Right. It is clearly stated. We even\nchose the lines from the government contracts where they came from.”\n\n                                             40\n\faccounting hired by Gulf Group to determine lost profit calculations on Gulf Group’s\ncamp package BPA, latrine, and dumpster claims, also included the base period and all\noptions periods when determining lost profits on the camp package BPA call, latrine\ncontract, and dumpster contract. Mr. Carlson testified that his calculations were\nreasonable, accurate, and correct based on a good faith effort to account for every\nsingle item of costs, and that option periods were reasonably included in the 2005 Claim\nand Settlement Offers.\n\n       Although Saud Al Tawash and Attorney Peters testified that the 2005 Claim and\nSettlement Offers were based on the base period and option periods, included in each\nClaim and Settlement Offer was an expense table, which Saud Al Tawash and Mr.\nPeters testified was only incorporated to show that Gulf Group was prepared to perform,\nand not to claim that Gulf Group had actually incurred all of the expenses listed. Mr.\nPeters testified that he could not calculate projected costs and, thus, did not include the\nexpense tables to suggest such costs as a basis for the amounts claimed, because\nthere had not been any performance. Attorney Peters also testified that he “didn’t put\nany costs in because I didn’t have any cost data.... And I felt that if the government was\nusing bad faith to terminate these agreements, then they should pay everything, and\nthat was a legitimate basis for the claim.”\n\n        In the 2005 camp package BPA Claim and Settlement Offer, Gulf Group listed in\nthe expense table, in Kuwaiti dinars, 12,200.000 KD for sixty-one dumpsters,\n28,000.000 KD for two vacuum tankers, 22,945.000 KD for a tower light system,\n241,962.000 KD for tents, 3,490.000 KD for electric generators, 22,120.000 KD for one\nhundred fifty-eight latrines, and 15,000.000 KD for a potable water truck. The 2005\nlatrine Claim and Settlement Offer expense table listed as expenses, in Kuwaiti dinars,\n14,437.359 KD for one hundred fifty-nine drop tanks, 36,984.985 KD for shipment\nexpenses, 11,478.000 KD for equipment leasing and services, 3,805.000 KD for truck\nrentals, 31,300.000 KD for agreements for specialized labor and equipment,\n19,195.126 KD for installation, management, and consulting, 1,014.500 KD for\nmiscellaneous costs, and 153,900.00 in Euros for six hundred drop tanks.62 The 2005\ndumpster Claim and Settlement Offer’s expense table included, in Kuwaiti dinars,\n127,740.000 KD for a dumpster container purchase, 72,000.000 KD for subcontracting\npapers, invoices, and receipts for dumpster service, and 761.200 KD in miscellaneous\npayments. Also included in each Claim and Settlement Offer was a copy of purchase\norders and invoices for some, but not all, of the items listed in each expense table.\n\n        Of the items listed in the expense tables, Gulf Group subsequently maintained\nthat it purchased one tower light, one tent, one generator, and fifty dumpsters for the\ncamp package BPA call, which it reflected in a 2011 notice to the court. Regarding the\n2005 camp package BPA Claim and Settlement Offer, Saud Al Tawash testified that the\nArmy would have understood Gulf Group was not submitting the expense table as a\nbasis for the amounts listed in the Claim and Settlement Offer because “[t]here was [sic]\nno receipt vouchers, no checks, no wire transfers for the PO’s [Purchase Order’s] that\n62\n  The claim lists a total of 171,044.970 KD, which purportedly includes the 153,900.00\nEuro expense.\n\n                                            41\n\fhave been not purchased.” The contract for the latrines required only six hundred\nlatrines, and Saud Al Tawash testified that the seven hundred fifty-nine latrines listed in\nthe 2005 latrine Claim and Settlement Offer’s expense table was a mistake made by\nGulf Group’s accounting department. Gulf Group eventually revised its latrine Claim\nand Settlement Offer to reflect the purchase of only four hundred latrines. Saud Al\nTawash explained that Gulf Group had taken mitigation efforts to sell many of the\nlatrines, reducing its actual costs from the costs shown in the 2005 expense table.\nWhen questioned about the latrine Claim and Settlement Offer, Mr. Peters\nacknowledged that the terminology he had used was “a little bit misleading.” Mr. Peters\nstated that he understood at the time that Gulf Group had obligated itself to buy the\nitems listed in the expense table, not that Gulf Group had actually made the purchases.\nMr. Peters stated, however, that he did not intend for the expense tables to be\nconsidered a basis for the amount submitted in the latrine Claim and Settlement Offer.\nMr. Peters also testified, “I admit this is pretty aggressive in what we are going for here,\nbut I had a bad faith situation, and a bad faith termination. So there was no reason not\nbe aggressive with the military.” Mr. Peters indicated that he expected the latrine Claim\nand Settlement Offer would be a starting point for settlement negotiations with the Army.\nGulf Group also revised its claim for the dumpster contract, reducing the contract\npreparatory expenses to 59,927.871 KD. The 2005 expense table for the dumpster\nClaim and Settlement Offer showed expenses of 200,501.220 KD.\n\n       When asked why the 2005 Claim and Settlement Offers on the camp package\nBPA and latrine and dumpster contracts were revised in the 2007 revised claims and in\nthe complaints filed in this court, Saud Al Tawash testified that he relied on the advice of\nboth attorneys Gulf Group hired to assist Gulf Group in putting together submissions for\nthe contracting officer and the court. He stated that the complaints were “revised\nbecause we saw errors in the first claim, in the initial claim, and we seeked [sic] help\nfrom a U.S. CPA [Certified Public Accountant], who helped us determine what would be\nthe best way to -- the best method and the acceptable method by the U.S. government\nstandards to file a revised claim.” Saud Al Tawash stated that Gulf Group believed\n“[w]e are entitled to what we are [sic] deserved,” but admitted that Gulf Group had made\nsome mistakes with respect to the various amounts that it claimed.\n\n       Although Saud Al Tawash recognized that he had signed the cover pages to the\n2005 Claim and Settlement Offers, he indicated that he did not look at the various\nsubmissions in detail until his deposition. He stated that he had trusted Attorney Peters\nto prepare the Claim and Settlement Offers properly, and that he glanced at the cover\npage of each Claim and Settlement Offer before signing it, but did not understand all of\nthe technical matters therein about the law and accounting. Saud Al Tawash stated that\nhe considered it the responsibility of everyone involved with the various submissions to\nthe contracting officer to ensure that the submissions were accurate. Saud Al Tawash\nexplained that he followed Attorney Peters’ recommendations because he had never\nfiled a claim with the United States government before and did not understand the\nprocess. Finally, Saud Al Tawash stated that he believed that the amounts claimed\nwere correct at the time they were originally presented. Yet, when questioned at trial,\nSaud Al Tawash did not know why Gulf Group claimed more than the full price of the\n\n\n                                            42\n\flatrine and dumpster contracts in its 2007 revised claims. In 2007, Gulf Group claimed\n$6,000,000.00 pursuant to the latrine contract, although the latrine contract, including all\nof the option periods, was worth only $5,057,895.14. Similarly, the dumpster contract,\nincluding all the option periods, was worth up to $1,457,619.72, but Gulf Group claimed\n$1,800,000.00 in 2007.\n\n        Regarding Gulf Group’s bottled water BPA demurrage claim, Saud Al Tawash\ntestified that the 85.000 KD/day demurrage expenses were the result of various costs,\nincluding the fees charged by its trucking company, Expeditors, for each of the 3,511\ndays of delay, but also other fees related to the delays, such as insurance for the water,\ntemporary storage, loading and unloading, salaries, vehicles, staging area, and local\ntransportation charges. The water had to be stored for climate and security reasons\nwhile Gulf Group awaited the next convoy. Saud Al Tawash testified that, although Gulf\nGroup’s demurrage claim was denied, he believed that the Army had awarded costs for\nother contractors’ demurrage expenses. The parties stipulated that, “[s]ometime prior to\nDecember 24, 2004 another contractor supplying bottled water to the US Government in\nIraq, StarCon Ltd., submitted a claim for demurrage expenses incurred from delays of\nthe convoys,” which was approved by the issuance of a BPA call on December 24,\n2004. According to Mr. Cockerham, the Army also awarded demurrage to a company\nidentified as IAP. Mr. Cockerham testified that there were, on average, two demurrage\nclaims submitted each week around April 2005, and that, in total, hundreds of\ndemurrage claims were submitted. Mr. Cockerham recalled the government policy on\ndemurrage being that the Army would pay if a truck was held seven days past the\nrequired time given for delivery, including reimbursement for offloading, storage,\nreloading, and delays at the government’s port.\n\nCertifications\n\nCamp Package BPA\n\n      With respect to the camp package BPA, Saud Al Tawash signed the October 10,\n2005 cover letter to plaintiff’s Claim and Settlement Offer. Mr. Peters certified the Claim\nand Settlement Offer. Plaintiff included an unsigned copy of Standard Form 1436 in its\nClaim and Settlement Offer. Standard Form 1436, which is titled “Settlement Proposal\n(Total Cost Basis),” contains the following statement under the heading\n“CERTIFICATE:”\n\n       (a) AS TO THE CONTRACTOR’S OWN CHARGES. The proposed\n       settlement (exclusive of charges set forth in Item 14) and supporting\n       schedules and explanations have been prepared from the books of\n       account and records of the Contractor in accordance with recognized\n       commercial accounting practices; they include only those charges\n       allocable to the terminated portion of this contract; they have been\n       prepared with knowledge that they will, or may, be used directly or\n       indirectly as the basis of settlement of a termination settlement proposal or\n\n\n\n                                            43\n\f      claim against an agency of the United States; and the charges as stated\n      are fair and reasonable.\n\n48 C.F.R. 53.301–1436 (2005) (emphasis in original). The signature block of the form\ncontains the phrase “BY (Signature of authorized official).” Id. (emphasis in original).\nBoth the 2005 camp package BPA Claim and Settlement Offer and the Standard Form\n1436 included in the submission sought $4,544,399.84. Ms. Hands signed the cover\nletter and certification to plaintiff’s 2007 revised camp package BPA claim.63 Plaintiff’s\n2007 revised claim requested $7,000,000.00. Although plaintiff attached its 2005 Claim\nand Settlement Offer to its 2007 revised claim, plaintiff inexplicably replaced the\nunsigned copy of Standard Form 1436 included in its 2005 camp package BPA Claim\nand Settlement Offer with a signed copy of the Standard Form 1436 included in\nplaintiff’s 2005 dumpster Claim and Settlement Offer. Plaintiff submitted a second\nrevised camp package BPA claim to Maj. Everett on April 12, 2011. Plaintiff’s second\nrevised claim sought $922,851.84 and was similarly certified by Ms. Hands.\n\nLatrine Contract\n\n       With respect to the latrine contract, Saud Al Tawash signed the October 17, 2005\ncover letter to the Claim and Settlement Offer. Attorney Peters certified the 2005 Claim\nand Settlement Offer. Saud Al Tawash’s signature, dated October 17, 2004,64 appears\n63\n   The language that Ms. Hands used to certify plaintiff’s 2007 revised claim deviates\nfrom the language set forth in the Contract Disputes Act and the FAR implementing\nregulations. Ms. Hands’ certification states:\n\n      I hereby certify that the claim herein is made in good faith and that the\n      supporting data submitted is accurate and complete to the best of my\n      knowledge and belief, that the amount requested herein accurately\n      reflects the contract adjustment for which the contractor believes the US\n      Government is liable, and that I am duly authorized to certify the claim on\n      behalf of the contractor, Gulf Group General Enterprises, Co. W.L.L. as its\n      attorney in fact.\n\nThe Contract Disputes Act and the FAR implementing regulations prescribe the\nfollowing language:\n\n      I certify that the claim is made in good faith; that the supporting data are\n      accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that the\n      amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which\n      the contractor believes the Government is liable; and that I am duly\n      authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the contractor.\n\nSee 48 C.F.R. § 33.207 (2005).\n64\n  Saud Al Tawash appears to have erroneously indicated that he signed the Standard\nForm included in plaintiff’s latrine Claim and Settlement Offer in 2004, rather than 2005.\n\n                                           44\n\fon the Standard Form 1436 included in the Claim and Settlement Offer. Both the Claim\nand Settlement Offer and the Standard Form 1436 included in the Claim and Settlement\nOffer seek $4,558,428.60. Ms. Hands signed the cover letter and certification to\nplaintiff’s 2007 revised latrine claim.65   Plaintiff’s 2007 revised claim requests\n$6,000,000.00. The Standard Form 1436 included with plaintiff’s 2007 revised claim is\nidentical to the copy of the Standard Form 1436 included in plaintiff’s 2005 Claim and\nSettlement Offer.\n\nDumpster Contract\n\n        With respect to the dumpster contract, Saud Al Tawash signed the October 20,\n2005 cover letter to the Claim and Settlement Offer. Attorney Peters certified the 2005\nClaim and Settlement Offer. The stand-alone copies of plaintiff’s Claim and Settlement\nOffer that appear in the record include an unsigned copy of Standard Form 1436. Both\nthe Claim and Settlement Offer and the Standard Form 1436 included in the Claim and\nSettlement Offer sought $999,994.67. Ms. Hands signed the cover letter and\ncertification to plaintiff’s 2007 revised dumpster claim.66 Plaintiff’s 2007 revised claim\nrequested $1,800,000.00. The Standard Form 1436 that plaintiff included in its 2007\nrevised claim appears to be a copy of the Standard Form 1436 included in plaintiff’s\n2005 Claim and Settlement Offer, except that the copy included in plaintiff’s 2007\nrevised claim contains Saud Al Tawash’s signature, dated October 20, 2004.67\n\nBottled Water BPA\n\n       With respect to the bottled water BPA, Saud Al Tawash signed the December 1,\n2005 cover letter to the Claim and Settlement Offer. Attorney Peters certified plaintiff’s\n2005 Claim and Settlement Offer.68 Saud Al Tawash’s signature, dated December 1,\n2005, appears on the Standard Form 1436 included in plaintiff’s 2005 Claim and\nSettlement Offer. Both the 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer and the Standard Form\n1436 included in the claim seek 298,435.000 KD. Plaintiff did not submit a revised\nbottled water BPA claim.\n\n65\n   The language that Ms. Hands used to certify plaintiff’s 2007 revised latrine claim\nsimilarly deviates from the language prescribed by the Contract Disputes Act and the\nFAR implementing regulations.\n66\n  The language that Ms. Hands used to certify plaintiff’s 2007 revised dumpster claim\nsimilarly deviates from the language prescribed by the Contract Disputes Act and the\nFAR implementing regulations.\n67\n  Saud Al Tawash appears to have erroneously indicated that he signed the Standard\nForm included in plaintiff’s dumpster claim in 2004, rather than 2005.\n68\n   At trial, the parties failed to introduce a signed copy of plaintiff’s 2005 bottled water\nBPA Claim and Settlement Offer and the corresponding Standard Form 1436. Plaintiff\nincluded a signed copy of both forms in its original complaint.\n\n                                            45\n\fJohn Cockerham and Carolyn Blake\n\n        John Cockerham and Carolyn Blake each testified in the above-captioned\nconsolidated cases in San Antonio, Texas.69 When they testified before this court they\nwere both incarcerated and serving federal, criminal prison sentences. The parties\nstipulated that Mr. Cockerham was a member of the Army procurement team in Kuwait\nand was introduced to Saud Al Tawash at Saud Al Tawash’s home in Kuwait in 2002.\nSaud Al Tawash testified that he first met Mr. Cockerham in 2002 or 2003 in the\n“Diwanya”70 at his house. Mr. Cockerham testified that he believes, however, he was\nbriefly introduced to Saud Al Tawash by a “Mr. Eli or Elias” during one of his earlier\ntours of Kuwait at the end of 2002 at a Ramadan “social dinner.” Mr. Cockerham also\ntestified that he has been to dinner at Saud Al Tawash’s house twice. According to Mr.\nCockerham’s testimony at trial, he thought of, and still thinks of, Saud Al Tawash as a\nfriend. Saud Al Tawash testified that Mr. Cockerham and Mr. Cockerham’s wife\nattended Saud Al Tawash’s wedding on February 4, 2006, in New Orleans, Louisiana.\nMr. Cockerham also testified that he was the only person from the Army contracting\noffice who attended Saud Al Tawash’s wedding. Saud Al Tawash and Joanne Hands,\nSaud Al Tawash’s fiancé at the time, now wife, also visited Mr. Cockerham at his home\nin San Antonio, Texas, in the spring of 2005 to congratulate Mr. Cockerham on the birth\nof his daughter, and brought toys for Mr. Cockerham’s children. Joanne Hands testified\nthat she remembers Saud Al Tawash saying “a friend or something had a baby,” and\nthat she first met Mr. Cockerham at this visit to his house where they had conversations\nlike one would have with a friend.\n\n        Saud Al Tawash described Mr. Cockerham as an “older acquaintance” with\nwhom he had a “professional relationship.” Saud Al Tawash stated that the only social\nactivity he engaged in with Mr. Cockerham in September or October of 2004 was in the\n“Diwanya.” Saud Al Tawash also testified to hosting a change-over ceremony for Mr.\nCockerham at the end of 2005, in which Mr. Cockerham received a small wooden\nsouvenir boat, because Mr. Cockerham was leaving Kuwait. Saud Al Tawash testified\nthat a number of Army contracting officers and Carolyn Blake, Mr. Cockerham’s sister,\nwere in attendance. According to Saud Al Tawash, “[i]t’s a common practice in Kuwait\nwhen a new group -- an old group leaves and a new group comes in that we have these\nchange-over ceremonies.” According to Mr. Cockerham, he believes the last time he\nsaw Saud Al Tawash was for “a quick lunch” in Austin, Texas, in March or April of 2006.\n\n\n\n69\n   Throughout the testimony of Mr. Cockerham, and especially Ms. Blake, there were\nmany inconsistencies and numerous memory lapses. Unfortunately, the same was true\nfor some of the government witnesses, such as Col. Miller and Col. Hess. Although\nthere were some inconsistencies in Saud Al Tawash’s testimony, he struck the court as\nsincerely trying accurately to recall the events of 2004 and 2005.\n70\n   Saud Al Tawash testified that a “Diwanya” (which he spelled out for the court reporter)\nis an “open door,” and “you could receive strangers coming to a Diwanya because\nusually Diwanya is not inside the house, the main quarters of houses.”\n\n                                           46\n\f       In 2004, Saud Al Tawash met Carolyn Blake, Mr. Cockerham’s sister, in Kuwait.\nAccording to Ms. Blake, she went to Kuwait after she had contacted her sister-in-law,\nMr. Cockerham’s wife, to ask Mr. Cockerham if they were hiring females in Kuwait. Mr.\nCockerham recommended that Ms. Blake visit Kuwait to see if the culture was\namenable to her. Ms. Blake’s first trip to Kuwait was from August 16, 2004 through\nAugust 22, 2004. According to Ms. Blake, Mr. Cockerham picked her up at the airport\nwith Diaa Salem, who was identified as the owner of Jasmine, and Diaa Salem gave her\nan amount of Kuwaiti dinars, but the testimony is unclear as to whether the amount was\n500.000 KD or an amount equal to $500.00. Ms. Blake testified that she was under the\nimpression that Mr. Cockerham and Diaa Salem talked about her working for Saud Al\nTawash. Ms. Blake also testified that during this visit, Mr. Cockerham was trying to\narrange an interview at Camp Arifjan for a clerical position.\n\n        The testimony is not clear as to when Saud Al Tawash met Ms. Blake for the first\ntime and if Saud Al Tawash knew she was Mr. Cockerham’s sister at the time, although\nthe parties stipulated that Saud Al Tawash met Ms. Blake for the first time in Kuwait,\nwhen Mr. Cockerham introduced her as his sister and mentioned that she was\nsearching for a job. According to Ms. Blake, she believed that when she first arrived in\nKuwait, Saud Al Tawash knew that she and Mr. Cockerham “were family.” Ms. Blake\ntestified that her first introduction to Saud Al Tawash occurred at the Crowne Plaza\nhotel where she was staying. Ms. Blake testified that she had never heard of Saud Al\nTawash, Gulf Telecom, Gulf Group, or Palm Springs71 before arriving in Kuwait on\nAugust 16, 2004. Mr. Cockerham testified that he was not aware that Saud Al Tawash\nwas interested in hiring expatriates prior to Ms. Blake’s move to Kuwait, and that he\nbelieves Saud Al Tawash first met Ms. Blake at Camp Doha, Kuwait, when she was\ngiven a temporary badge. According to Saud Al Tawash, Mr. Cockerham referred to\nMs. Blake as “Sis” when they were first introduced, but Saud Al Tawash indicated he did\nnot realize that Ms. Blake was Mr. Cockerham’s sister until she later returned to Kuwait\nfor work.\n\n       Ms. Blake testified that she told Saud Al Tawash during her first visit to Kuwait\nthat she wanted to come back to Kuwait to work there. According to Saud Al Tawash,\nafter Ms. Blake returned to the United States, Saud Al Tawash offered her a job as a\n“marketing consultant” for Gulf Telecom call centers, which Ms. Blake accepted. Ms.\nBlake testified that when she returned to Kuwait:\n\n      I believe it was Mr. Al Tawash or his brother Michel [sic]. I think they were\n      trying to help me find employment, so John [Cockerham] got them to help\n      me, more or less like, to pay for an apartment or something like that until I\n      could find a job and then after not being able to find a job, then, Saud\n      talked more about well he would just try to hire me and find a position or\n      make a position for me and he would just try to set it up as me being a\n      consultant.\n71\n    According to the parties’ joint stipulation of facts, “[i]n July 2005, Mr. [Saud] Al\nTawash became the sole owner of Palm Springs General Trading and Contracting\nEstablishment (‘Palm Springs’).”\n\n                                           47\n\f        According to Saud Al Tawash, the job offer to Ms. Blake was an offer with the\nsame benefits as those given to other Americans working for Gulf Telecom. Saud Al\nTawash testified that these benefits included “housing, travel allowance or tickets,\ntuition and vehicle, phone.” Saud Al Tawash gave the following explanation of Ms.\nBlake’s qualifications: “She’s an American. She understands the culture very well of the\nmilitary. She understands the American culture. She knows the holidays. She’s\nsomebody who has experience with that environment,” and “[s]he’s American citizen\nand clients are Americans. She’s ex-military; she has retail experience; she has\nexperience in security as a guard and she has the personality to -- the attitude, for this\nparticular position. She’s educated. She has a degree. She has also a -- quite a good\nknowledge of the different demographics and segments of the military.” Immediately\nprior to accepting Gulf Telecom’s job offer, Ms. Blake was employed in the United\nStates as both an assistant school teacher and a shopping mall security guard. Ms.\nBlake testified that she also had worked as a clerk in a gas station. Mr. Cockerham\ntestified that Saud Al Tawash hired Ms. Blake as an “English speaking liaison” and to do\n“some office work and research work” and that both Ms. Blake and Saud Al Tawash told\nhim that Ms. Blake was doing administrative paperwork for Saud Al Tawash. Mr.\nCockerham also indicated that Ms. Blake had military training and experience, which is\nlisted on the résumé that Ms. Blake prepared in 2006 or 2007, although not on the\nrésumé that appears to have been prepared prior to working for Gulf Telecom.\n\n        According to Saud Al Tawash, Ms. Blake’s position had been open to others and\nhe had interviewed other individuals for the job, but he did not remember the names of\nthe other candidates. Saud Al Tawash testified that he did not believe it was a conflict\nof interest to hire Ms. Blake “because she was not working on any contracts then or\nafter.” Saud Al Tawash testified that he did not tell Mr. Cockerham that he had hired\nMs. Blake, although Ms. Blake testified that Mr. Cockerham knew that the Al Tawash\nfamily was trying to help her get a job. Mr. Cockerham testified that Ms. Blake told him\nthat she had worked out temporary employment with Saud Al Tawash, and that Gulf\nTelecom paid her a salary, but that he was not then aware of Ms. Blake’s employment\nconditions. Mr. Cockerham testified that he did not tell anybody in the Army that Saud\nAl Tawash had hired his sister.\n\n       Ms. Blake testified that after she accepted the job, she was met at the airport in\nKuwait on August 27, 2004 by Mr. Cockerham, Maj. Davis, Saud Al Tawash, and Diaa\nSalem. Subsequently, Megbel Al Tawash helped Ms. Blake locate housing in Kuwait.\nMegbel Al Tawash cashed a 1,200.000 KD check for her, and paid Ms. Blake that\namount in cash every month as her salary, which he delivered to her in envelopes at her\napartment. Ms. Blake was paid twice as much in salary as Megbel Al Tawash. She had\nasked for $4,000.00 or more per month in wages. Saud Al Tawash testified that Ms.\nBlake was graded higher and, therefore, entitled to a higher wage than the local staff\nbecause she knew the American culture and the English language, which presented a\nbarrier for local workers when communicating with the Army. Ms. Blake testified that\nshe believed her salary could have been paid to her in cash or “they can send it to your\naccount.” Saud Al Tawash testified that Ms. Blake was paid in cash rather than wire\ntransfers because “[s]he didn’t ask it to be wired to the United States, she asked to be\n\n\n                                           48\n\fpaid locally in Kuwait.” Saud Al Tawash further explained that Ms. Blake was paid in\ncash because she could not obtain a local bank account and that cash payments were a\ncommon practice in Kuwait. Mr. Wilson testified that he did not have a Kuwaiti bank\naccount when he first arrived in Kuwait so Gulf Group wired his salary to his United\nStates account, but he was not paid in cash. Megbel Al Tawash testified that he did not\nremember paying cash to any other Gulf Telecom employee, although he believes\nShane Mi, a Gulf Telecom employee, also initially was paid in cash. Mr. Cockerham\ntestified that he never received any of Ms. Blake’s salary and did not know how much\nmoney she earned.\n\n        The parties stipulated that, “[w]hile employed in Kuwait, Ms. Blake was given the\ntask of calling members of the Kuwaiti public to ask if they were interested in buying\nwater purification systems by cold-calling from a telephone book,” but she testified that\nshe failed to sell a single system. The parties also stipulated that Ms. Blake did not\nspeak Arabic. According to Saud Al Tawash, the call centers at which Ms. Blake was\nsupposed to work were on military bases, and she never went to them because she did\nnot have the requisite paperwork to obtain a civil identification. Saud Al Tawash\ntestified at trial that, although he realized Ms. Blake could not work in the call centers in\nlate fall 2004, he “could not cancel her employment because [he] had a close contract\nwith her.” Saud Al Tawash explained that a close contract is “when you enter into a\ncontract with your employer and employee regarding the duration period that you’re\nagreed on.” Saud Al Tawash stated that, on such a contract, “I cannot fire her at that\ntime because she had her kids in school and it wasn’t the right thing to do. And I was\nobligated by law because of a fixed contract I had to pay her anyway because of the\nremainder of her contract.” According to Saud Al Tawash, under Kuwaiti labor law, he\nwas obligated to pay Ms. Blake for the full, one-year-term of her contract, including\nindemnity, salary, and benefits, starting in August 2004, even if he fired her. In\nresponse to a question how long did she have use of a company vehicle, Ms. Blake\nstated, “I think it was December ’05, no, December ’04 until June ’07.” It does not\nappear, however, that there is other testimony regarding Ms. Blake being employed by\na Gulf entity until June 2007, and Ms. Blake testified she was no longer in\ncommunication with Saud Al Tawash after December 2006. In fact, Ms. Blake offered\nconfused and inconsistent testimony on many issues throughout the course of the trial.\n\n        Ms. Blake testified that she thought she was working for Gulf Telecom or Gulf\nGroup, “but I never did work for anyone.” The parties stipulated that, “[w]hile in Kuwait\nin October 2005, Ms. Blake also worked for Mr. Saud Al Tawash’s uncle at Jireh\nSprings [General Trading & Contracting Establishment],” to whom she was referred and\nrecommended by Saud Al Tawash. In a résumé that Ms. Blake prepared at the end of\n2006 or early in 2007 and introduced at trial, Ms. Blake listed the following under the\n“Employment” heading: “Gulf Group Enterprise - Consultant” and “Jireah [sic] Springs -\nSales Representative.” Upon being asked why she listed Gulf Group, rather than Gulf\nTelecom as her employer, Ms. Blake testified that she “really didn’t know who I was\nemployed by,” but that she “thought it was Gulf Telecom” and also thought she was\nsupposed to be working for Jireh Springs in 2005 or 2006. Additionally, Ms. Blake\ntestified that she never did any work for Jireh Springs from 2004 to 2007. According to\n\n\n                                             49\n\fSaud Al Tawash, Ms. Blake’s passport lists Gulf Telecom, in Arabic, on her October 9,\n2004 Kuwait residency permit, because Gulf Telecom was her visa sponsor and\nemployer at the time. Mr. Cockerham testified that Saud Al Tawash told him Jireh\nSprings would sponsor Ms. Blake and that Ms. Blake told Mr. Cockerham that she was\nin fact sponsored by Jireh Springs. It also appears that Jireh Springs considered Ms.\nBlake to be an employee in February 2006, based on a letter from Jireh Springs to the\nCommercial Bank of Kuwait regarding the transfer of salary funds to three Jireh Springs\nemployees, including Carolyn Blake. The letter stated: “They work for the Jireh Springs\nGeneral Trading and Contracting Establishment.”\n\n        As one of her employment benefits, Gulf Telecom paid tuition for Ms. Blake’s\nchildren to attend the American International School in Kuwait, which, according to Ms.\nBlake, amounted to about $20,000.00 per year. Ms. Blake also testified that Saud Al\nTawash provided her with a vehicle while she was in Kuwait. According to Mr. Wilson,\nGulf Group purchased similar vehicles for at least four employees. Ms. Blake further\ntestified that Saud Al Tawash paid for travel and a hotel for her and her children for a\ntrip to Dubai and that Saud Al Tawash gave her between $1,500.00 and $2,000.00 in\nspending money. According to Saud Al Tawash, this trip to Dubai was deducted from\nMs. Blake’s monthly cash envelopes, and he did not give her spending money for\npersonal trips. According to Ms. Blake, Saud Al Tawash paid for another trip, to\nBahrain, including hotel costs, to get a blood test for a visa, with spending money, in the\namount of about $1,000.00. Saud Al Tawash testified that the trip to Bahrain, on\nFebruary 3, 2005, was to further Ms. Blake’s application to obtain residency in Kuwait.\nMs. Blake additionally stated that she returned to the United States for a vacation in\nJune 2005, but was not asked to retrieve any of the documents required for her to\nobtain an identification. The parties stipulated that, “[i]n March 2005, Gulf Group wired\n$9,478 to Ms. Blake for her to pay taxes due upon property she owned in the United\nStates.” Saud Al Tawash testified that this payment was “helping her out with payments\nthat she required for tax and credit cards” and that “this amount would have been\ndeducted from her -- it was like an advance payment that was paid from our company.”\nDuring his rebuttal testimony, Saud Al Tawash testified that this wire payment was to\nreimburse Ms. Blake for her travel expenses. He explained that “she voiced her\nconcern that taxes are up and she has a lot of credit card bills and the agreement\nbetween the company that we reimburse or [sic] staff for airline tickets, so she asked if\nshe could get paid, urgently because she had to meet the first of April deadline.”\nAccording to Ms. Blake, when she told him she “didn’t need that much,” he replied,\n“don’t worry about it, just use it if you need it for your other bills.”\n\n       Regarding Ms. Blake’s relationship to the Al Tawash family, Ms. Blake testified\n“we were like family” and that she “really loved the Al Tawash family.” Ms. Blake\nattended dinners at the Al Tawash home, including when Saud Al Tawash was present.\nAccording to Ms. Blake, she was invited, but did not go on the honeymoon of Saud Al\nTawash and Joanne Hands. Ms. Blake testified, “[s]o, I spoke to her so I said Joanne,\nSaud has invited us all to go with you all on your honeymoon to Sharm el Sheikh and\nso, she said, yes, girl, it will be fine, we will have fun.” Joanne Hands, however, testified\nthat nobody but her husband, Saud Al Tawash, accompanied her on their honeymoon in\n\n\n                                             50\n\fthe Maldives, not Sharm el Sheikh as Ms. Blake testified, and that she did not invite Ms.\nBlake on her honeymoon. Joanne Hands further testified that the Al Tawash family took\na vacation in the summer of 2006 to Sharm el-Sheikh, but neither Ms. Blake nor anyone\noutside the family was invited or came on that trip.\n\n       When questioned about whether he had improperly tried to influence the award\nof any Army contracts, Saud Al Tawash adamantly denied any such allegations.72\nSaud Al Tawash also pointed out that there were contracts for which he submitted bids\nto Mr. Cockerham, which were not awarded to Saud Al Tawash’s company, although\nthere were several smaller contracts, valued at $100,000.00 or less, that Mr.\nCockerham awarded to Gulf Group after the terminations of the camp package BPA call\nand the latrine and dumpster contracts.73 Saud Al Tawash forcibly and credibly denied\nobtaining inside information not otherwise available to the public, influencing anyone in\nthe contracting office, offering to give money, gifts, favors, or property to anyone in the\ncontracting office, paying anyone’s debts, or hiring anyone in exchange for favorable\ntreatment as a contractor, including the contracts and BPA call awards at issue in this\ncase. Saud Al Tawash also testified that he never had an agreement with Mr.\nCockerham for contracting actions, the purchase of land, or investment in any\ncompanies Mr. Cockerham owned. Mr. Cockerham similarly testified that he never had\na conversation with Saud Al Tawash about business opportunities. Saud Al Tawash\nexplained that he had, however, heard of other contractors bribing Army officers for\nfavorable consideration.\n\n       The parties stipulated that, “[o]n February 4, 2008, Saud Al Tawash met with Mr.\nMark Pletcher, Ms. Emily Allen, Mr. Richard Evans, attorneys for the Department of\nJustice, as well as with Mr. Larry S. Moreland and Mr. Sergio Gamino of the U.S. Army\nCID.” At the trial before this court, Saud Al Tawash testified that he told federal\ninvestigators he had heard that Tijani Saani and former Army Maj. James Momon, Jr.74\nwere soliciting bribes, and that Green Valley had been debarred for bribing Mr. Momon.\nDuring this meeting, which was prior to Mr. Momon pleading guilty to participation in a\n72\n   For example, on direct examination, plaintiff’s counsel asked Saud Al Tawash if he\nhad given anything of value to Maj. Cockerham in order to receive the award of “the\nInternet Café, the UPS [uninterruptable power supply] contract, the light set contract or\nthe wash rack contract?” to which Saud Al Tawash replied: “No ma’am.”\n73\n  Mr. Wilson noted, for example, that after the terminations of the camp package BPA\ncall, the latrine contract, and the dumpster contract, Gulf Group “built a loading ramp at\nShuait for the departing troops, that was like an $80,000 small job, then at Kuwait Naval\nBase we did some construction work on one of the piers that had been hit by a ship and\nbent....”\n74\n  According to the parties’ joint stipulation of facts, “Mr. Momon was employed by the\nDoD as a Major with the Army deployed to Camp Arifjan, Kuwait where he served as a\ncontract specialist from about September 21, 2005 through August 10, 2006.”\nAccording to Saud Al Tawash, Mr. Cockerham introduced Saud Al Tawash to Mr.\nMomon at the end of 2005.\n\n                                            51\n\fbribery scheme and involvement in a criminal conspiracy to accept bribes, Saud Al\nTawash also told the investigators that Mr. Momon had solicited a bribe from him, and\nthat he, Saud Al Tawash, had rejected the solicitation.\n\n       Saud Al Tawash testified that he first learned that Mr. Cockerham and Ms. Blake\nwere involved in bribery allegations related to other contractors from the news media in\n2007 or 2008. According to Saud Al Tawash, a number of Gulf Group bottled water\ncompetitors, including Jasmine and Allied Arms, were debarred for bribing Mr.\nCockerham. In addition, Saud Al Tawash testified that he believed there was a\nproposed debarment against Jireh Springs, and perhaps against Palm Springs, for\nbribing Mr. Cockerham, although in response to the questions, “as of today has Palm\nSprings ever been debarred? Completely debarred?” Saud Al Tawash responded “no.”\n\n        At trial, Mr. Cockerham was questioned about his undated, hand-written\n“appreciation payments” list, which was introduced into evidence, and which included\nabbreviations of names of contractors and numeric values. Mr. Cockerham testified “[i]t\nwas money, a list of either money anticipated receiving or received,” on his behalf, by\nhis wife, Carolyn Blake, or Kermit Cruz, who established a business at the direction of\nMr. Cockerham. According to Mr. Cockerham, “AA” on the “appreciation payments” list\nrefers to Allied Arms, “Jireh” refers to Jireh Ventures, “Jas” refers to Jasmine\nInternational, “Zenith” refers to Ghopal Zenith, “Falah” refers to the owner of Trans\nOrient, “F.S.” refers to Future Services, “KMS” refers to Kamal Sultan, and “Terry” refers\nto a representative of Freedom Catering Company. “Lee Dynamics” and “Green Valley”\nboth appear on the “appreciation payments” list as well. Mr. Cockerham testified he\nbegan receiving payments from contractors on the list in August 2005 to “show some\nappreciation” for his work in preventing bottled water contracts from being cancelled and\ngetting contractors off of the contracting office blacklist. Mr. Cockerham also stated that\nthese “appreciation payments” were for a church that he was in the process of starting\nand for displaced women with whom Ms. Blake was working. Mr. Cockerham noted that\n“I was just thinking, you know, be able to help a lot of people and definitely wouldn’t\nhave to ever worry about taking up a collection.…” Mr. Cockerham testified that, of the\nfourteen contractors that he saved from cancellation, five of them were bottled water\ncontractors that appear on the “appreciation payments” list: Allied Arms, Jasmine, Trans\nOrient, Zenith, and Freedom Catering Company. According to Mr. Cockerham,\nalthough Gulf Group was one of the fourteen bottled water contractors that he saved\nfrom cancellation, Gulf Group did not give any “appreciation payments” to him, his\nsister, his wife, or Kermit Cruz. Moreover, as noted above, Mr. Cockerham also signed\nthe cancellations of Gulf Group’s latrine and dumpster contracts. According to Saud Al\nTawash, Mr. Cockerham did ask him to donate to a “fictional church,” which “[t]o me,\nthat was a big no no because to me that is a bribe.” Saud Al Tawash testified that he\nnever had any agreement with Mr. Cockerham to do business of any kind.\n\n        Allied Arms is included on the “appreciation payments” list as giving two million\ndollars to Ms. Blake, which Mr. Cockerham testified was given to Ms. Blake on his\nbehalf and at his direction. According to Mr. Cockerham, he “told [Ms. Blake] to just put\nit in a safe deposit box” “for what we were wanting to do with the church, the mission,\n\n\n                                            52\n\fthe school, the daycare, the boys’ center and on and on.” Mr. Cockerham testified that\nMs. Blake understood that this money was for the church, as opposed to personal\nspending, but that she could keep ten percent of whatever money she received from the\nbottled water contractors on Mr. Cockerham’s behalf.\n\n        Lee Dynamics also is referenced on the “appreciation payments” list, and Mr.\nCockerham testified at trial that he had gotten them off of the contracting office blacklist.\nAccording to Mr. Cockerham, they were under the mistaken impression that he was\ninfluencing a contract award to them, and they had, in return, “expressed like $300,000\nor whatever” so he told them, “if you want to give something to somebody, I said give it\nto Maj. Davis’ daughter for dental school.” Mr. Cockerham further testified that the\nrepresentative from Lee Dynamics “was persisting and by this time I was thinking about\nthe church and all of this stuff, and so I was like, well, if you want to give something, you\ncan, but I say, you know, understand this, you don’t have to.” Similarly, Green Valley75\nis referenced on the “appreciation payments” list, and Mr. Cockerham testified that the\namount listed from Green Valley also was “showing me appreciation.” Mr. Cockerham\ntestified, however, that Green Valley did not pay him any “appreciation payments” until\nthe summer of 2005. Mr. Cockerham clarified that he did not receive any “appreciation\npayments” or indicate that he would be willing to accept any “appreciation payments”\nduring the time period in which Gulf Group’s camp package BPA call for Camp\nBuehring, latrine contract, and dumpster contract were awarded and terminated. Mr.\nCockerham also testified that one of the names blacked out on the “appreciation\npayments” list is Mr. Ishmal, an employee of Green Valley, who, Mr. Cockerham\nspeculated, “worked with a couple of other different companies.” Mr. Cockerham stated\nthat he told Mr. Ishmal to give money to a church in Israel, but that Mr. Ishmal was\nunable to so. According to Mr. Cockerham, while Mr. Cockerham was on leave in the\nSpring or Summer of 2005, Mr. Ishmal, the Green Valley employee, visited San Antonio,\nTexas, and left an ATM card with $250,000.00 on it for Mr. Cockerham in the backseat\nof a van, which Mr. Cockerham never used and ended up shredding. Mr. Cockerham\ntestified that the money from Green Valley did not come from Saud Al Tawash.\n\n        According to Mr. Cockerham, another contractor on the list, “Jireh” was Jireh\nVentures, a company that Mr. Cockerham directed Mr. Cruz to establish in San Antonio\nfor “providing supplies and so forth for vendors overseas that needed things from the\nstates.” Mr. Cockerham testified that neither Saud Al Tawash nor Jamal Al Dahma,\nSaud Al Tawash’s uncle, had any involvement with Jireh Ventures. Mr. Cockerham\ntestified at trial before this court that, in a January 2007 meeting with investigators, he\nexplained to Ann Brickley and Mark Pletcher of the Department of Justice that “Jireh” on\nthe appreciation list was a Kuwaiti company. Mr. Cockerham’s testimony on Jireh\nVentures, however, was contradictory and disjointed. Mr. Cockerham also stated\nshortly thereafter: “No, I don’t think -- I don’t think I told them it was a Kuwait company.”\nMr. Cockerham also testified that, although he was aware that Mr. Al Dahma was\nrelated to Saud Al Tawash, he could not recall if he knew Mr. Al Dahma was Saud Al\nTawash’s uncle. Mr. Cockerham also testified that Mr. Al Dahma did not pay him any\n75\n  As noted above, Saud Al Tawash testified he had no financial interest in Green\nValley.\n\n                                             53\n\fmoney. According to Mr. Cockerham, his 2007 statements to Department of Justice\ninvestigators, that he had asked Mr. Cruz to start Jireh Ventures so that Mr. Al Dahma\ncould transfer money to it and that he had held up a large BPA call to Jireh Springs\nbecause Mr. Al Dahma did not want to pay him, were “not true,” and he was pressured\ninto making them. In a BPA call for bottled water in Kuwait issued by Mr. Cockerham to\nJireh Springs, however, Mr. Cockerham listed Ms. Blake as the point of contact for the\nArmy and Nathan Blake, Ms. Blake’s teenage son, as the point of contact for the\ncontractor. In total, Mr. Cockerham testified that he received “close to seven” million\ndollars from the contractors on the “appreciation payments” list.76\n\n       In addition, after being questioned by the federal investigators and after the\ninvestigators searched Mr. Cockerham’s house, Mr. Cockerham testified that he drafted,\nbut never sent, the note, reproduced below, to Ms. Blake telling her, among other\nthings, to “Get Rid of Everything.” The full text of the hand-written note, as introduced\ninto evidence at trial, reads:\n\n       1. Carolyn Get Rid of Everything\n       2. Do not talk to them at All\n       3. Make sure no excess money is lying around. Put it all in the bank.\n       4. Make sure no keys are laying around.\n       5. Tell Saud if ask to don’t confess to anything. Tell them they can talk to\n       his lawyer that he never called Fernand Peters [sic] gave me a penny for a\n       contract. We will do business later in trading.\n       6. Tell Carolyn start business in Dubai.\n       7. It’s perfect legal for Carolyn to work for him doing admin paperwork as\n       long as he and I didn’t have an agreement. She never work on nor\n       prepared any contracts or worked in that Department. She got the job on\n       her own.\n\n(emphasis, capitalization, and strike-through in original).\n\n        According to Mr. Cockerham’s testimony at trial, “[e]verything” in the first line of\nthe note referred to “appreciation payments” by bottled water contractors, as well as Ms.\nBlake’s employment relationship with Saud Al Tawash. Mr. Cockerham further testified\nthat “them” in the second entry of the note refers to federal investigators. The note\nstated, “[d]o not talk to them at All,” and “[t]ell Saud if ask to don’t confess to anything.”\nMr. Cockerham explained that when he wrote, regarding Saud Al Tawash, “[w]e will do\nbusiness later in trading,” he “thought there might be perhaps an opportunity in the\nfuture,” despite the fact that he had not had any business with Saud Al Tawash prior to\nwriting this note. In another hand-written note, written during the same time period, but\nalso never sent, Mr. Cockerham wrote to Ms. Blake:\n\n\n\n76\n    Information in the indictments against Mr. Cockerham, Ms. Blake, and Mr.\nCockerham’s wife suggests that Mr. Cockerham accepted as much as $9.6 million in\nbribes.\n\n                                             54\n\f      0.

According to Mr. Cockerham, these notes were “just\nbrainstorming,” and there were “about 70 pages of these notes, just -- I’m just on a\nmental rampage, just everything I can -- that was coming to mind....”\n\n       Besides meeting with Mr. Cockerham, federal investigators called Ms. Blake in\nFebruary 2007 and requested to meet with her. According to Ms. Blake, before meeting\nwith the investigators, she called Megbel Al Tawash, and he suggested that she meet\nwith them at a restaurant, rather than her apartment “[b]ecause the apartment was not\nmy apartment.” According to Ms. Blake, she did not tell Mr. Cockerham that the\ninvestigators wanted to meet with her. Ms. Blake testified that she met with the federal\ninvestigators a few weeks later and they asked her about money she had received from\ncertain people whose names she had written in a list.\n\n       On a list Ms. Blake prepared of people who gave her money, contractors were\nassigned “some type of American name because I didn’t know how to spell their\nnames.” According to Ms. Blake’s testimony, “Felicia Hamilton” refers to Mr. Falah,\n“Julie Landsheen” refers to Justin Lee, “Destiny Carter” refers to Diaa Salem, and\n“Sharon Miller” perhaps refers to Mr. Shawak. Ms. Blake testified that the people\nnamed on the list gave her $3,135,120.00, which she eventually gave back, “except for\nthe amount for the tuition and for the amount to pay for a plane ticket for the kids to\ncome home.” According to Ms. Blake, none of the names on the list refer to Saud Al\nTawash, Megbel Al Tawash, or Suresh Pulikkal, a legal consultant for Gulf Group, and\nshe never considered any of the money she received from Gulf Telecom or the Al\nTawash family to be a bribe toward obtaining army contracts through Mr. Cockerham.\n\n       A few months prior to meeting with the investigators, in December 2006, Ms.\nBlake claims that the Al Tawash family “just wouldn’t talk to me no more” and would not\nreturn her phone calls about paying her children’s tuition. Mr. Cockerham testified that\nhe told Ms. Blake to talk to Saud Al Tawash about paying the tuition and that he also\n\n\n                                          55\n\f“mentioned it to him one time that she was concerned about the tuition in time for the\nkids so that they wouldn’t be put out of school....” Around this same time period,\naccording to Ms. Blake, Mr. Cockerham sent Ms. Blake’s niece, to “just give the money\nback, back to the contractors because the Feds had been asking questions about it.”\nAccording to Ms. Blake, she gave money back to the contractors on January 3, 2007.\n\n       According to Ms. Blake, although members of the Al Tawash family were not\nreturning her calls in December 2006, after Ms. Blake met with the federal investigators\nin early 2007, Saud Al Tawash called and said he wanted to meet with her at the\ncollege where his wife worked. Ms. Blake stated that she met with Saud Al Tawash at\nthe college for about ten or fifteen minutes and he “wanted to know why the Feds\nwanted to meet with me or something like that and that he said something else about if\nJohn gets ousted or something....” According to Saud Al Tawash, he never used the\nword “ousted” in his conversations with Ms. Blake and he does not “even know what it\nmeans.” Ms. Blake testified that she told Mr. Cockerham around April 2007 that the Al\nTawash family had stopped communicating with her.\n\n       Eventually, Mr. Cockerham was indicted and convicted, and he entered a plea\nagreement as a result of bribery in connection with the “appreciation payments.” Ms.\nBlake also was indicted and convicted, and she entered a plea agreement, confessing\nthat she had received bribe payments from government contractors on Mr. Cockerham’s\nbehalf. According to the joint stipulation of facts in the above-captioned cases, “none of\nthe contractors from whom Blake received bribe money included Mr. Saud Al Tawash,\nGulf Group, Gulf Telecom, Palm Springs, Mr. Jamal Al Dahma or Jireh Springs.” The\nparties also stipulated that, “[t]he Indictment obtained against Cockerham does not\nmention any of the contracts that are the subject of this litigation or any contract ever\nissued to Gulf Group, Gulf Telecom, or Saud Al Tawash.” In addition, the parties\nstipulated that “[t]he Indictment obtained against Cockerham also does not mention any\ncontracts awarded to Jireh Springs.” The plea agreements signed by Mr. Cockerham\nand Ms. Blake also do not mention any members of the Al Tawash family, Gulf Group,\nGulf Telecom, Palm Springs, Mr. Al Dahma, or Jireh Springs. In fact, the plea\nagreements do not mention any contractor by name. According to Mr. Cockerham, he\nwas arrested in late July 2007, and he had not exchanged any communications with\nSaud Al Tawash, including phone calls or emails, since his arrest, until his testimony\nduring the trial before this court.\n\n                                     DISCUSSION\n\n        Gulf Group’s complaints allege abuse of discretion and arbitrary and capricious\naction by the Army concerning the terminations, and, therefore, breaches of the camp\npackage BPA call, the latrine contract, and the dumpster contract. Plaintiff also claims\nwhat appear to be expectancy damages and preparation costs for breaches of the camp\npackage BPA, the latrine contract, and the dumpster contract.

The False Claims Act and the Contract Disputes Act\n\n        Defendant alleges that plaintiff violated the False Claims Act in the submission of\nits claims to the government under the camp package BPA and the bottled water BPA,\nas well as under the latrine contract and the dumpster contract. Defendant also asserts\nthat plaintiff submitted claims for the camp package BPA call and bottled water BPA\n\n\n                                              58\n\fcalls, as well as for the latrine contract and dumpster contract, for an amount\nsignificantly greater than what was owed, and that, under the antifraud provision of the\nContract Disputes Act, plaintiff must pay the government the money it has claimed\nwhich is not supported, plus the government’s costs in reviewing the claims.\n\n       On December 15, 2005, Gulf Group submitted a Claim and Settlement Offer to\nMr. Cockerham under the bottled water BPA for 298,435.000 KD in demurrage for\ndelays incurred between November 2004 and March 2005. Saud Al Tawash signed the\ncover letter to the bottled water BPA Claim and Settlement Offer and the Claim and\nSettlement Offer was signed and certified by plaintiff’s attorney at the time, Ferdinand\nPeters. On December 16, 2005, Gulf Group submitted a Claim and Settlement Offer to\nMr. Cockerham for $4,544,339.84 for the camp package BPA. Mr. Peters and Saud Al\nTawash disagreed at trial as to who chose the settlement amount, with each testifying\nthat the other chose it. Within the settlement offer, plaintiff asserted that it was entitled\nto the master BPA limit of $10,000,000.00.\n\n        On December 16, 2005, Gulf Group also submitted Claim and Settlement Offers\nto Mr. Cockerham in the amount of $4,558,428.60 for the latrine contract and\n$999,994.67 for the dumpster contract.78 Saud Al Tawash signed the cover letter to the\n2005 Claim and Settlement Offers relating to the latrine contract and the dumpster\ncontract, and the Claim and Settlement Offers were certified by plaintiff’s attorney at the\ntime, Ferdinand Peters. On March 26, 2007, Gulf Group presented revised claims to\nJoseph Libbey, the contracting officer, certified by plaintiff’s replacement attorney and\ncurrent attorney of record, Iliaura Hands, for $7,000,000.00 for the camp package BPA,\n$6,000,000.00 for the latrine contract, and $1,800,000.00 for the dumpster contract. On\nMay 21, 2007, Mr. Libbey issued separate final decisions on the camp package BPA,\nthe latrine contract, and the dumpster contract termination claims.\n\n        The total price of the camp package BPA call No. 0001 was $1,447,457.22. In its\noriginal complaint in Case No. 06-835C, the camp package BPA case, plaintiff sought\n$7,000,000.00. In its first amended complaint in the camp package BPA case, plaintiff\nsought $2,682,160.86. In its second amended complaint in the camp package BPA\ncase, plaintiff sought $3,463,297.57. In its third amended complaint in the camp\npackage BPA case, plaintiff now seeks $922,851.84. The total price of the base period\nof the latrine contract was $613,142.86. In its original complaint in Case No. 06-858C,\nthe latrine case, plaintiff sought $6,000,000.00. In its first amended complaint in the\nlatrine case, plaintiff sought 1,572,967.611 KD. In its second amended complaint in the\nlatrine case, plaintiff now seeks $2,830,662.20. The total price of the base period of the\ndumpster contract was $346,998.00. In its original complaint in Case No. 06-853C, the\ndumpster case, plaintiff sought $1,800,000.00. In its first amended complaint in the\ndumpster case, plaintiff sought $1,946,721.78. In its second amended complaint in the\ndumpster case, plaintiff now seeks $780,031.63. In its original complaint in Case No.\n78\n  As indicated above, on October 19, 2006, the Camp Arifjan contracting office files\nwere searched, but there was no record of claim submissions from Gulf Group on\nDecember 15 and 16, 2005. Gulf Group, therefore, re-submitted its Claim and\nSettlement Offers and, this time, the claims were put on the contracting command log.\n\n                                             59\n\f07-82C, the bottled water BPA case, plaintiff sought 298,435.000 KD, calculated as\n$1,035,802.23. In its first amended complaint in the bottled water BPA case, plaintiff\nsought 298,435.000 KD. In its second amended complaint in the bottled water BPA\ncase, plaintiff now seeks 298,435.000 KD, calculated as $1,065,711.39, for demurrage\nand related expenses. For each of the amended complaints in the camp package BPA,\nthe latrine case, and the dumpster case, plaintiff altered the amount of money sought.\n\n       As noted above, with respect to the camp package BPA, Saud Al Tawash signed\nthe October 10, 2005 cover letter to plaintiff’s Claim and Settlement Offer and Attorney\nPeters certified plaintiff’s 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer. Plaintiff included an\nunsigned copy of Standard Form 1436 (Rev. 5/04) in its 2005 Claim and Settlement\nOffer. Standard Form 1436, which is titled “Settlement Proposal (Total Cost Basis),”\ncontains the following statement under the heading “CERTIFICATE:”\n\n      (a) AS TO THE CONTRACTOR’S OWN CHARGES. The proposed\n      settlement (exclusive of charges set forth in Item 14) and supporting\n      schedules and explanations have been prepared from the books of\n      account and records of the Contractor in accordance with recognized\n      commercial accounting practices; they include only those charges\n      allocable to the terminated portion of this contract; they have been\n      prepared with knowledge that they will, or may, be used directly or\n      indirectly as the basis of settlement of a termination settlement proposal or\n      claim against an agency of the United States; and the charges as stated\n      are fair and reasonable.\n\n48 C.F.R. 53.301–1436 (emphasis in original). The signature block of the form contains\nthe phrase “BY (Signature of authorized official).” Id. (emphasis in original). Both the\n2005 camp package BPA Claim and Settlement Offer and the Standard Form 1436\nincluded in the Claim and Settlement Offer sought $4,544,399.84. Ms. Hands signed\nthe cover letter and certification to plaintiff’s 2007 revised camp package BPA claim.79\n\n79\n   The language that Ms. Hands used to certify plaintiff’s 2007 revised claim deviates\nfrom the language set forth in the Contract Disputes Act and the FAR implementing\nregulations. Ms. Hands’ certification states:\n\n      I hereby certify that the claim herein is made in good faith and that the\n      supporting data submitted is accurate and complete to the best of my\n      knowledge and belief, that the amount requested herein accurately\n      reflects the contract adjustment for which the contractor believes the US\n      Government is liable, and that I am duly authorized to certify the claim on\n      behalf of the contractor, Gulf Group General Enterprises, Co. W.L.L. as its\n      attorney in fact.\n\nThe Contract Disputes Act and FAR implementing regulations prescribe the following\nlanguage:\n\n\n                                           60\n\fPlaintiff’s 2007 revised claim requested $7,000,000.00. Although plaintiff attached its\n2005 Claim and Settlement Offer to its 2007 revised claim, plaintiff inexplicably replaced\nthe unsigned copy of Standard Form 1436 included in its 2005 Claim and Settlement\nOffer with a signed copy of the Standard Form 1436 relating to plaintiff’s dumpster\nclaim. Plaintiff submitted a second revised camp package BPA claim to Maj. Daniel\nEverett on April 12, 2011. Plaintiff’s second revised claim sought $922,851.84 and was\nsimilarly certified by Ms. Hands.\n\n        With respect to the latrine contract claim, Saud Al Tawash signed the October\n17, 2005 cover letter to plaintiff’s Claim and Settlement Offer and Attorney Peters\ncertified plaintiff’s 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer. Saud Al Tawash’s signature, dated\nOctober 17, 2004,80 appears on the Standard Form 1436 included in plaintiff’s 2005\nClaim and Settlement Offer. Both the 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer and the\nStandard Form 1436 included in the Claim and Settlement Offer sought $4,558,428.60.\nMs. Hands signed the cover letter and certification to plaintiff’s 2007 revised latrine\nclaim,81 which requested $6,000,000.00. The Standard Form 1436 included with\nplaintiff’s 2007 revised claim is identical to the copy of the Standard Form 1436 included\nin plaintiff’s 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer.\n\n        With respect to the dumpster contract claim, Saud Al Tawash signed the October\n20, 2005 cover letter to plaintiff’s Claim and Settlement Offer and Attorney Peters\ncertified plaintiff’s 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer. The stand-alone copies of plaintiff’s\n2005 Claim and Settlement Offer that appear in the record include an unsigned copy of\nStandard Form 1436. Both the 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer and the Standard\nForm 1436 included in the Claim and Settlement Offer sought $999,994.67. Ms. Hands\nsigned the cover letter and certification to plaintiff’s 2007 revised dumpster claim,82\nwhich requested $1,800,000.00. The Standard Form 1436 that plaintiff included in its\n2007 revised claim appears to be a copy of the Standard Form 1436 included in\n\n       I certify that the claim is made in good faith; that the supporting data are\n       accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that the\n       amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which\n       the contractor believes the Government is liable; and that I am duly\n       authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the contractor.\n\nSee 48 C.F.R. § 33.207.\n80\n  Saud Al Tawash appears erroneously to have indicated that he signed the Standard\nForm included in plaintiff’s latrine Claim and Settlement Offer in 2004, rather than 2005.\n81\n   The language that Ms. Hands used to certify plaintiff’s 2007 revised latrine claim\nsimilarly deviates from the language prescribed by the Contract Disputes Act and the\nFAR implementing regulations.\n82\n  The language that Ms. Hands used to certify plaintiff’s 2007 revised dumpster claim\nsimilarly deviates from the language prescribed by the Contract Disputes Act and the\nFAR implementing regulations.\n\n                                            61\n\fplaintiff’s 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer, except that the copy included in plaintiff’s\n2007 revised claim contains Saud Al Tawash’s signature, dated October 20, 2004.83\n\n        With respect to the bottled water BPA claim, Saud Al Tawash signed the\nDecember 1, 2005 cover letter to plaintiff’s Claim and Settlement Offer. Attorney Peters\ncertified plaintiff’s 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer. Saud Al Tawash’s signature, dated\nDecember 1, 2005, appears on the Standard Form 1436 included in plaintiff’s 2005\nClaim and Settlement Offer. Both the 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer and the\nStandard Form 1436 included in the Claim and Settlement Offer sought 298,435.000\nKD.\n\n        It is not clear from the face of the 2005 Claim and Settlement Offers that plaintiff\nsubmitted to Mr. Cockerham for the termination of camp package BPA call, the latrine\ncontract, and the dumpster contract whether the Claim and Settlement Offers\nconstituted “claims” under the Contract Disputes Act.84 The United States Court of\nAppeals for the Federal Circuit has indicated that a submission to a contracting officer\nconstitutes a claim if it is “(1) a written demand, (2) seeking, as a matter of right, (3) the\npayment of money in a sum certain.” See Northrop Grumman Computing Sys., Inc. v.\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">709</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1107</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1112 (Fed.

Although Gulf Group referred to each submission as “an\noffer for settlement,” included Standard Form 1436, “Settlement Proposal (Total Cost\nBasis),” and cited provisions of the FAR relating to settlement, the cover letter to each\n2005 Claim and Settlement Offer, each of which was signed by Saud Al Tawash, stated\nthat “[w]e hereby submitting [sic] our claim,” requested “approval for our claim,” and\nindicated that Gulf Group had attached supporting documentation in support of its\n“claim.” Moreover, each 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer included the certification\nrequired by the Contract Disputes Act for claims seeking more than $100,000.00.\nFurthermore, in each of Gulf Group’s 2007 submissions to the contracting officer with\nrespect to the camp package BPA and latrine and dumpster contracts,85 Iliaura Hands,\nplaintiff’s replacement attorney, referred to the previous submission as the “initially\nsubmitted certified claim,” designated the corresponding cover letter as “Mr. Al\nTawash’s claim letter,” and stated that “a Settlement Proposal in the Standard Form\n1436 and a Claim & Settlement Offer letter” was “[i]ncluded in Gulf Group’s claim.” The\n2007 submissions purported to withdraw each initial “settlement offer,” but also\n\n85\n  Prior to the above-captioned cases being consolidated before the undersigned judge,\nGulf Group submitted its 2007 revised claim to the contracting officer with respect to the\ncamp package BPA claim, as well as the latrine and dumpster contract claims, after\ndefendant requested the then-presiding judges, to whom each of the cases individually\nhad been assigned, to issue a stay in each case pursuant to 41 U.S.C. § 605(c)(5), “so\nthat the contracting officer can issue a decision regarding plaintiff’s ‘claim and\nsettlement offer.’” The bottled water BPA case was not stayed at that time.\nSubsequent stay requests were granted by the undersigned judge in each of the\nconsolidated cases to accommodate related ongoing criminal investigations.\n\n                                           64\n\findicated that Gulf Group “hereby re-submit[s] a claim under the Contract Dispute [sic]\nAct.”\n\n        At least one decision issued by the United States Court of Appeals for the\nFederal Circuit has indicated, however, that a contracting officer’s failure to respond to a\nsettlement proposal may not be sufficient to demonstrate a breakdown in the settlement\nprocess, precluding the “deemed denial” of a settlement proposal from allowing the\nsettlement proposal to ripen into a claim. Specifically, in Walsky Construction Co. v.\nUnited States, the contractor submitted “a termination for convenience settlement\nproposal to the contracting officer, which also contained what purported to be a\ncertification submitted pursuant to the Contract Disputes Act....” See Walsky Constr.\nCo. v. United States, No. 98–5112, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1312</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">13376</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (Fed. Cir.\n1999) (unpublished table decision). The Federal Circuit concluded, however, that the\n“deemed denial” of the settlement proposal did not cause the settlement proposal to\nripen into a claim, even though the contractor waited almost a year after transmitting its\nsettlement proposal before bringing suit in the United States Court of Federal Claims.\nThe Federal Circuit reasoned that the “deemed denial” of the settlement proposal did\nnot constitute an impasse in negotiations between the parties. See id. at *2–3.\n\n        The court recognizes the similarity between the submissions at issue in Walsky\nConstruction Co. v. United States and the submissions at issue in the camp package\nBPA, latrine, and dumpster cases. The context in which the settlement proposals were\nsubmitted, however, is different. After submitting the termination settlement proposal,\nthe contractor in Walsky Construction Co. v. United States requested that the\ngovernment “‘set a negotiations date,’” the government indicated that settlement was “‘a\ndefinite priority,’” and the government updated the contractor as to the status of its\nreview of the settlement proposal. See id. at *3. In contrast, the record before this court\ndoes not reflect that the settlement proposals that Gulf Group submitted for the\ntermination of the camp package BPA call, the latrine contract, and the dumpster\ncontract were subject to further discussions between the parties. Instead, the record\nreflects that government personnel may have lost the initial submission of the Claim and\nSettlement Offers in October 2005, that government personnel could not\ncontemporaneously locate a copy of the Claim and Settlement Offers that plaintiff\nsubmitted on December 16, 2005, which now inexplicably appear in the record before\nthe court, and that government personnel refused to meet with plaintiff’s representatives\nin November 2006, approximately a year after plaintiff had made its submissions. Mr.\nLibbey, the contracting officer who issued the final decisions on the camp package BPA\ncall, and latrine and dumpster contracts, testified, apparently with respect to plaintiff’s\n2005 submissions, that “the government didn’t answer the claim,” that he could not even\nremember whether plaintiff had submitted a termination for convenience settlement, and\nthat the “government was in error” with regard to “the delay in processing.” Although\n“[o]bjective evidence that negotiations had been abandoned by the parties is necessary\nbefore the negotiations can be found to have reached an impasse,” see Rex Sys., Inc.\nv. Cohen, 224 F.3d at 1372–73, at least one authority has recognized that, when a\nsettlement proposal, which also is styled as a claim under the Contract Disputes Act, is\nnot subject to any form of negotiation, an impasse in negotiations may result, allowing\n\n\n                                            65\n\fthe settlement proposal to ripen into a claim under the Contract Disputes Act. See\nePlus Tech., Inc. v. FEC, CBCA No. 2,573, 12–2 BCA ¶ 35114 (“In looking at the\ncircumstances presented here, we see a settlement proposal as well as a certified claim\nbeing presented to the contracting officer. No attempt was made by the contracting\nofficer to contact the appellant to discuss either the settlement proposal or the certified\nclaim. After more than six months had passed, the contractor got fed up, filed the\nappeal, and refused to negotiate on the settlement proposal or certified claim.”).\nNotwithstanding the potentially broad holding of the unpublished table decision in\nWalsky Construction Co. v. United States, therefore, the court determines that the\nparties had reached an impasse with regard to plaintiff’s Claim and Settlement Offers\nand that the settlement proposals included in the Claim and Settlement Offer\nsubmissions with respect to the camp package BPA and the latrine and dumpster\ncontracts had ripened into claims under the Contract Disputes Act when the plaintiff filed\nthe complaints in the above-captioned cases based on a deemed denial of plaintiff’s\nclaims.\n\n       Accordingly, because the 2005 Claim and Settlement Offers had ripened into\nclaims under the Contract Disputes Act, and because settlement proposals constitute\nclaims under the False Claims Act, see 48 C.F.R. § 49.001 (“A settlement proposal is\nincluded within the generic meaning of the word ‘claim’ under false claims acts (see 18\nU.S.C. 287 and 31 U.S.C. 3729).”), the court examines plaintiff’s liability under the False\nClaims Act and the Contract Disputes Act for its 2005, 2007, and 2011 submissions for\nthe camp package BPA, and its 2005 and 2007 submissions for the latrine and\ndumpster contracts.\n\n      The False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3729, provides that any person who –\n\n             (1) knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, to an\n             officer or employee of the United States Government or a\n             member of the Armed Forces of the United States a false or\n             fraudulent claim for payment or approval;\n\n             (2) knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a\n             false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim\n             paid or approved by the Government;\n\n             (3) conspires to defraud the Government by getting a false\n             or fraudulent claim allowed or paid;\n\n             (4) has possession, custody, or control of property or money\n             used, or to be used, by the Government and, intending to\n             defraud the Government or willfully to conceal the property,\n             delivers, or causes to be delivered, less property than the\n             amount for which the person receives a certificate or receipt;\n\n\n\n\n                                            66\n\f             (5) authorized to make or deliver a document certifying\n             receipt of property used, or to be used, by the Government\n             and, intending to defraud the Government, makes or delivers\n             the receipt without completely knowing that the information\n             on the receipt is true;\n\n             (6) knowingly buys, or receives as a pledge of an obligation\n             or debt, public property from an officer or employee of the\n             Government, or a member of the Armed Forces, who\n             lawfully may not sell or pledge the property; or\n\n             (7) knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a\n             false record or statement to conceal, avoid, or decrease an\n             obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the\n             Government,\n\n      is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of not less than\n      $5,000 and not more than $10,00086 plus 3 times the amount of damages\n      which the Government sustains because of the act of that person....\n86\n   “The Department of Justice, by regulation, has increased the penalties for FCA [False\nClaims Act] violations to a minimum of $5,500.00 and a maximum of $11,000.00.”\nAlcatec, LLC v.

In its counterclaims in Case No. 06-835C, the camp package\nBPA, and Case No. 07-82C, the bottled water BPA, defendant requests treble\ndamages, but in its post-trial briefing defendant addresses only statutory penalties.\nNeither plaintiff nor defendant address the number of claims at issue in the alleged\nFalse Claims Act violation(s) pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 3729. Plaintiff’s position appears\nto be that, even if the court finds violation(s) of the False Claims Act, defendant should\n\n                                           67\n\f31 U.S.C. § 3729(a) (emphasis in original). The term “claim” is defined in the False\nClaims Act as:\n\n       Includ[ing] any request or demand, whether under a contract or otherwise,\n       for money or property which is made to a contractor, grantee, or other\n       recipient if the United States Government provides any portion of the\n       money or property which is requested or demanded, or if the Government\n       will reimburse such contractor, grantee, or other recipient for any portion\n       of the money or property which is requested or demanded.\n\n31 U.S.C. § 3729(c). The False Claims Act also states:\n\n       the terms “knowing” and “knowingly” mean that a person, with respect to\n       information –\n\n              (1) has actual knowledge of the information;\n\n              (2) acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the\n              information; or\n\n              (3) acts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the\n              information,\n\n       and no proof of specific intent to defraud is required.\n\n31 U.S.C. § 3729(b).\n\n        Congress rejected requiring a specific intent to defraud under the False Claims\nAct. See 31 U.S.C. § 3729(b). Instead, Congress adopted a knowing standard, defined\nas “actual knowledge of the falsity,” acting in “deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity,”\nor “acting in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity.” Id. The standard was designed to\naddress “the problem of the ‘ostrich-like’ refusal to learn of information which an\nindividual, in the exercise of prudent judgment, had reason to know.” See S. Rep. No.\n99-345, at 21 (1986), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5266, 5286. Thus, the False\nClaims Act covers not just those who set out to defraud the government, but also those\nwho ignore obvious deficiencies in a claim.\n\n       Therefore, the critical issue before the court is whether plaintiff had “knowledge,”\nas defined by the False Claims Act to include reckless disregard, that the claims plaintiff\nsubmitted to the government were false or fraudulent. To prove a violation of the False\n\nnot recover because it has not proven damages. As discussed below, however, under\nthe False Claims Act, the wrongdoer still may be held liable for the statutory penalty,\neven if the government is not injured by the conduct. The court has the discretion to\nimpose penalties within the statutory range. See Morse Diesel Int’l, Inc. v.

Bornstein analyzed an earlier version of the False Claims Act, but the\nguidance of the United State Supreme Court remains relevant to the court’s\ninterpretation of amended versions of the False Claims Act.

See 41 U.S.C. § 609.\nThe FAR also indicates that a “written demand or written assertion by the Contractor\nseeking the payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim under the Act [the\nContract Disputes Act] until certified.” See 48 C.F.R. § 52.233–1 (2005).

The Contract Disputes Act, however, explicitly\ngrants a reviewing court the authority to “retrocede authority to the contracting officer”\nwhen the court “possess[es] jurisdiction over a claim based on a deemed denial.” See\nUnited Partition Sys., Inc. v.

The\njudges previously assigned to the camp package BPA, latrine, and dumpster cases,\ntherefore, stayed proceedings pending the issuance of a final decision by the\ncontracting officer. Although Gulf Group’s revised claims submitted to the contracting\nofficer in 2007 did not each constitute a new claim under the Contract Disputes Act, the\ncontracting officer was not deprived of jurisdiction to render a final decision during the\nlitigation of the above-captioned cases as would typically be the case after a contractor\nfiles a complaint in the Court of Federal Claims because the judges previously assigned\nto the camp package BPA, latrine, and dumpster cases exercised their authority to “stay\nthe proceedings to obtain a decision on the claim by the contracting officer.” See 41\nU.S.C. § 605(c)(5).\n\n                                            76\n\fpackage BPA, did not constitute new claims under the Contract Disputes Act, however,\ndoes not indicate whether the revised claims constituted additional claims under the\nFalse Claims Act.

See Daewoo Eng’g & Constr. Co. v. United\nStates, 73 Fed. Cl. at 560 n.19. Unlike the contractor in Daewoo Engineering &\nConstruction Co., in which the plaintiff was assessed a single penalty under the False\nClaims Act after revising its single claim to the contracting officer during litigation, Gulf\nGroup submitted its revised, certified claims to the contracting officer for “a final\ndecision...awarding Gulf Group full compensation for its damages....” See id. at 560\nn.19, 573 (indicating that the revised claim amount that was discussed at trial in\nDaewoo was never certified and submitted to a contracting officer). In its revised 2007\nclaims, Gulf Group even requested that the contracting officer disregard its initial claims.\nThe court concludes, therefore, that Gulf Group’s submission of revised claims in 2007\nand potentially the submission of its second revised claim for the camp package BPA in\n2011,93 in the specific circumstances presented by the facts of this case, constituted a\n“request or demand...for money,” which was “present[ed]...to an officer or employee of\nthe United States Government...for payment or approval,” thereby creating the potential\nfor additional liability under the False Claims Act.

The Camp Package BPA Claims under the False Claims Act and the Contract\n       Disputes Act\n\n       The camp package BPA call for Camp Buehring was awarded to plaintiff on\nSeptember 30, 2004 and terminated on October 12, 2004. Gulf Group submitted a\nclaim to the government on the camp package BPA call, first to the Army, and then\nincorporated those claims in the original complaint filed in this court as Case No. 06-\n835C. The original complaint filed in this court in the camp package BPA case was\namended three times. Additionally, plaintiff resubmitted its camp package BPA claim to\nthe contracting officer in 2007 and again in 2011.94 In each instance, plaintiff alleged it\nwas owed monies based on its contractual relationship with the government, which the\nArmy had refused to pay. In its third amended complaint filed in this court regarding the\ncamp package BPA, plaintiff alleges:\n\n\n\n93\n  A number of differences between the 2007 and 2011 submissions, including that the\nArmy lacked authority to issue a decision on plaintiff’s 2011 submission, give the court\npause in concluding that the 2011 submission constitutes a claim under the False\nClaims Act. Regardless of whether the 2011 submission constitutes a claim under the\nFalse Claims Act, Gulf Group’s 2011 submission does not implicate liability under the\nFalse Claims Act.\n94\n  Gulf Group’s 2011 claim was submitted to a contracting officer “in the care of” Maj.\nEverett.\n\n                                             77\n\f       Gulf Group was fully prepared to perform under the...BPA Call and was\n       ready to continue to fully perform for the complete duration of the BPA Call\n       any subsequent BPA Call Modifications or additional separate BPA Calls,\n       including other future extensions of the Master BPA.\n\n       On or about October 12, 2004, after Gulf Group had commenced\n       preparations to perform its contractual duties and had incurred substantial\n       preparatory costs to perform under the Master BPA, the U.S. Army\n       Contracting Command SWA-Kuwait (ARCENT) Contracting Officer, Gloria\n       D. Davis, issued BPA Call Modification Number 000103 which cancelled\n       and terminated the BPA Call without warning or valid justification and\n       without any benefit ensuring [sic] to the Government.\n\n(internal citation omitted).\n\n      In its third amended answer to plaintiff’s complaint in the camp package BPA\ncase, No. 06-835C, defendant responds by alleging that:\n\n       Gulf Group is unable to support its claim,95 as alleged above, due to a\n       misrepresentation of fact or fraud. Gulf Group knowingly and deliberately\n       certified entitlement to $4,544,339.8496 for Call 0001, despite that: (a) the\n       total contract award was $1,447,457; (b) the contract was terminated 12\n       days into the performance period; and (c) Gulf Group submitted an invoice\n       from Green Valley generated by a Gulf Group employee97 to support its\n95\n   Defendant’s answers to plaintiff’s complaints in the camp package BPA case and the\nlatrine and dumpster cases interchangeably refer to plaintiff’s “certified claim” and\nplaintiff’s “claims” when discussing the False Claims Act. Defendant’s answers,\nhowever, seek “civil penalties as are allowable by law…per violation.” As indicated\nabove, plaintiff’s submissions in 2005 and 2007 create the potential for liability under the\nFalse Claims Act.\n96\n   Defendant’s third amended answer interprets plaintiff’s settlement offer as the amount\nto which plaintiff claimed entitlement in its 2005 camp package BPA claim. As indicated\nabove, plaintiff asserted entitlement to more than the amount of its settlement offer in its\n2005 claim.\n97\n   In its third amended answer, defendant argued that the Green Valley invoice was\nincluded in the camp package BPA claim to evidence the purchase of one hundred fifty-\neight latrines and one potable water tanker, and highlighted that the invoice had the\nmobile telephone number of Suresh Pulikkal, who defendant described as a “Gulf Group\nemployee.” As noted above, Suresh Pulikkal appears to have been a legal consultant\nfor a number of different companies. Saud Al Tawash explained that Suresh Pulikkal\nwas “the project coordinator” for Gulf Group and Green Valley’s joint venture. The joint\nventure agreement between Gulf Group and Green Valley indicated that Suresh\nPulikkal had authority to act on the behalf of Green Valley. In addition, plaintiff asserted\nthat the invoice from Green Valley was not included in the claim calculation, but was\n\n                                            78\n\f       claim. Accordingly, Gulf Group is liable to the United States pursuant to\n       the Contract Disputes Act, 41 U.S.C. § 7103(c)(2), for the unsupported\n       claim, plus the Government’s costs attributable to reviewing the claim.\n\nDefendant continues:\n\n       Gulf Group knowingly presented and caused to be presented, to officers\n       and employees of the United States Government, and to members of the\n       Armed Forces of the United States, false or fraudulent claims for payment\n       or approval, in submitting invoices for all calls under BPA 0047 and in\n       submitting its certified claim to the contracting officer(s). The claims for\n       payment were false or fraudulent because: (a) Gulf Group inflated the\n       amount of its claim for Call 0001 for supplies and services it did not\n       render; (b) Gulf Group submitted an invoice from Green Valley generated\n       by a Gulf Group employee to support its claim for Call 0001; and (c) the\n       award of BPA 0047 contract was tainted by bribery.98\n\n        In a post-trial brief, defendant contends that plaintiff violated the False Claims Act\nbecause the amounts it claimed, when plaintiff submitted its claims in 2005 and 2007 on\nthe camp package BPA claim, were without basis and inflated, and because plaintiff\nsought payment for expenses it never had incurred. Defendant also argues that plaintiff\nis liable to the United States in the amount of $6,674,502.13, pursuant to the antifraud\nprovision of the Contract Disputes Act, for the amounts it claimed when plaintiff\nsubmitted its claims in 2007. Defendant identifies $5,545,505.28 as the unsupported\namount of plaintiff’s 2007 claim, which asserted entitlement to the BPA call limit,\n$7,000,000.00, and attorneys’ fees, which were later identified as amounting to\n$7,037.50, even though the price of the call was $1,447,457.22.99 In addition,\ndefendant argues that plaintiff asserted entitlement to $1,128,996.85 in unsupported\ncosts in its 2005 and 2007 submissions. Defendant not only contends that plaintiff\n\nincluded with the claim documents to show that plaintiff was ready to perform and that it\nhad a good faith belief that the government would award other calls under the camp\npackage BPA to Gulf Group or extend the call already awarded.\n98\n  As is discussed more fully below regarding defendant’s allegations of bribery, Saud Al\nTawash testified forcefully that he did not obtain inside information from Mr. Cockerham,\nMaj. Davis, or anyone else in the contracting office, and that he and his company did\nnot offer money, gifts, or favors to Mr. Cockerham, Maj. Davis, or any other official in the\ncontract office in order to receive any inside information or award of any of the\ncontracts, BPAs, or BPA calls. The court had considerable opportunity to observe Saud\nAl Tawash in the courtroom, including during his lengthy direct testimony, cross-\nexamination, and rebuttal, to reach its conclusion that Saud Al Tawash offered sincere\nand credible testimony.\n99\n  Defendant does not address the fact that plaintiff’s claim to attorneys’ fees arises out\nof Attorney Peters’ preparation of plaintiff’s 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer, rather\nthan plaintiff’s 2007 claim.\n\n                                             79\n\fsought costs it had not incurred, but also that the claimed amount was merely a\nnegotiating ploy.\n\n       Plaintiff argues in response that it “sought full contract value including the base\nperiod and all options that Gulf Group believed would have performed if the contracts\nwere not improperly terminated, which is also the total amount the Government would\nhave spent to obtain the services.” Plaintiff contends that it sought payment for the full\ncontract price, including the option periods, based on case law, which plaintiff asserts\nestablished that a contractor may recover for unexercised option periods if the\ngovernment made an arbitrary and capricious or bad faith100 decision not to exercise the\noptions.\n\n       The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit stated in White v.\nDelta Construction International, Inc.:\n\n       The primary objective of damages for breach of contract is to place the\n       non-breaching party “in as good a position pecuniarily as he would have\n       been by performance of the contract.” Miller v.

Plaintiff subsequently\ndropped all allegations concerning bad faith in each case. As confirmed in an April 22,\n2011 Order issued by this court, “[i]n a conference the court held with the parties on\nApril 8, 2011, plaintiff’s counsel advised the court that, upon reflection, counsel does not\nwish to pursue a bad faith claim on the part of the government, but that plaintiff’s\ncounsel intends to proceed with the allegation that government officials acted arbitrarily\nand capriciously with respect to the cancellation of Gulf Group’s contract.” Thereafter,\nin its third amended complaint in Case No. 06-835C (the camp package BPA), filed on\nMay 6, 2011, plaintiff dropped its bad faith claim against the government. At closing\nargument, in response to the question from the court, “there is no bad faith claim in any\none of these four cases, 06-835, 06-858, 06-853, and 07-082, is that correct?” plaintiff’s\ncounsel responded, “[t]hat is correct.”\n\n                                            80\n\f      fully performed the contract.” Miller, 266 U.S. at 260, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100507\"><a href=\"/opinion/100507/miller-v-robertson/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Bank, FSB v. United States, 239 F.3d at 1380.\n\n       Plaintiff admits that the claims it submitted relevant to the camp package BPA in\n2005 and 2007 were incorrect. Plaintiff argues, however, that the mistakes made in\nsubmitting the camp package BPA claims in 2005 and 2007 were innocent mistakes\nand, thus, should not be actionable under the False Claims Act or the Contract Disputes\nAct. Plaintiff further argues that the expense table that was included in the 2005 camp\npackage BPA claim was not attached to show expenses actually incurred, or as a basis\nfor the amount claimed, but rather to show that plaintiff was prepared to perform. At\nclosing argument, plaintiff’s current attorney of record, Ms. Hands, who prepared,\nsigned, and certified plaintiff’s revised camp package BPA claim in 2007, stated: “I\nmade a mistake. I misunderstood the claims. I thought that we could collect full\ncontract value, plus the expenses. I misunderstood the expenses to be the full amount\non those expense tables,” and “I read those expense tables as including all of the\nexpenses.” Plaintiff also responds to defendant’s counterclaims by arguing that it had a\nlegal and factual basis for claiming the full amount of the camp package BPA call 0001,\n\n                                           81\n\fstating: “Gulf Group had a good faith basis for claiming the full $7,000,000 call limit and\nGulf Group did not submit a claim for costs as the Government interpreted or\nmaintained that it had actually paid $1,183,838.72 in costs.”\n\n      According to plaintiff, Maj. Davis, on behalf of the Army, had informed Saud Al\nTawash that Gulf Group would receive multiple calls under the camp package BPA if it\nperformed well.101 Moreover, even after camp package BPA call 0001 was terminated,\nGulf Group received other calls for latrines and dumpster services under the camp\npackage BPA. Plaintiff states that “Mr. Al Tawash thus had every expectation that the\nArmy would either amend BPA Call 001 [sic] to issue additional requests for camp\npackages or individual items listed on the BPA Call up to the maximum Call limit of\n$7,000,000, and even up to the full Master BPA aggregate of $10,000,000.”\n\n       During cross-examination, Attorney Peters, plaintiff’s prior attorney, revealed his\nviews regarding his decision to seek the entire amount of the camp package BPA, and\nhis misunderstanding of what had occurred:\n\n       Q: So the future work under this call, or the future work under the entire\n       BPA?\n\n       A: The entire BPA.\n\n       Q: And when you put whatever number, the $5 million, in the claim, you\n       put it in because you believed the termination for the BPA call was based\n       on the Army’s bad faith and abuse of discretion; isn’t that right?\n\n       A: Yes, but I might have been -- I might have made a mistake on this one.\n       I might have misunderstood and thought that the entire BPA was being\n       canceled, or was being withdrawn, because I was going by what I had\n       been told by Hess and everyone else that they were canceling everything\n       that my clients had with them.\n\n       Q: Did you ask anyone at Gulf Group whether Gulf Group received further\n       calls under this BPA?\n\n       A: I probably didn’t because I thought that everything had been canceled.\n\n        The extent to which Attorney Peters did a disservice to his client and opened up\nthe possibility of a False Claims Act counterclaim and a Contract Disputes Act\ncounterclaim regarding his client’s claims, as a result of advice that he gave to his client,\nis further illustrated by this exchange on direct examination of Mr. Peters at trial:\n101\n    Maj. Davis both awarded and terminated plaintiff’s camp package BPA call. Unlike\nthe other contracts, Mr. Cockerham had more limited involvement with the camp\npackage BPA call. He was not the contract specialist or contracting officer on the camp\npackage BPA, but was listed on the Contract Review Board that recommended award\nof the camp package BPA to Gulf Group.\n\n                                             82\n\f       Q: And when you submitted this claim did you intend to submit a\n       fraudulent claim?\n\n       A: Never.\n\n       Q: And when you submitted these claims did you knowingly submit a false\n       claim?\n\n       A: No, I would never submit anything fraudulently at all for a variety of\n       reasons. One, having to do with my oath as an officer, and as an attorney\n       who values his license, and ability to practice law, and I will not\n       compromise myself for any client ever.\n\n       Q: Did Gulf Group ask you to submit a claim that was inflated?\n\n       A: No.\n\n       Q: Did Gulf Group ask you to submit a claim that was false?\n\n       A: No, they relied on me to know what the American law was, and I felt\n       that what I submitted was correct. If I had submitted anything less, then I\n       would be guilty of malpractice for not submitting the full amount that under\n       the circumstances would be correct in a court of law based on my review\n       of case law, et cetera, and the rules that guide us in this endeavor.\n\n       Plaintiff insists that it did not include a claim for the expenses listed on the\nexpense table for the camp package BPA. Plaintiff also asserts that the invoice from\nGreen Valley was included with the camp package BPA claim documents only to show\nthat plaintiff was ready to perform and that it had a good faith belief that the government\nwould award other calls under the camp package BPA or extend the call awarded.\nAccording to plaintiff, the Green Valley invoice was not included in the claim calculation.\n\n        In 2005, plaintiff submitted its Claim and Settlement Offer to the Army for the\ncamp package BPA, certified by Attorney Peters, with a cover letter and settlement offer\nin the amount of $4,544,339.84, both signed by Saud Al Tawash. Neither Attorney\nPeters nor Saud Al Tawash offered any specific basis for the settlement amount\nincluded, other than Attorney Peters testifying that he generally instructed his clients to\noffer “something less” than the total claim amount. The camp package BPA call No.\n0001 was in the amount of $1,447,457.22. In its 2007 revised claim submitted to the\nArmy, which was prepared, signed, and certified by plaintiff’s second attorney, and\ncurrent attorney of record, Iliaura Hands, as well as in its original complaint filed in this\ncourt, also submitted by Ms. Hands as attorney of record in the above-captioned cases,\nplaintiff claimed $7,000,000.00, the price of the camp package BPA call limit. In its first\namended complaint in the camp package BPA case, plaintiff sought $3,463,297.57, in\nits second amended complaint plaintiff sought $3,463,287.57, and in its third amended\n\n\n                                             83\n\fcomplaint plaintiff now seeks $922,851.34. Each of the three amended complaints was\nsubmitted by Ms. Hands as plaintiff’s attorney of record.\n\n        The amounts plaintiff claimed in its successive claims and complaints were\ninconsistent and submitted without reasonable explanation of the original submission to\nthe contracting officer, and without reasons and justifications for the amendments to the\ncomplaints or claims. Plaintiff sought amounts that would have placed plaintiff in a\nbetter position than if camp package BPA call 0001 had been fully performed. Had the\nmaximum value of the calls been issued under the camp package BPA, plaintiff would\nhave incurred expenses, which would have reduced its gross profits under any given\ncamp package BPA call. In its 2007 claim, plaintiff sought the entire call limit of\n$7,000,00.00, an amount that far exceeded any potential profit on the $1,447,457.22\nBPA call 0001. Although plaintiff’s 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer, which was\nincorporated into plaintiff’s 2007 claim, acknowledged that the law directs that contract\ndamages place the wronged party in as good a position as it would have been but for\nthe breach, the claims plaintiff submitted in 2005 and 2007 would have put plaintiff in a\nfar better position. Unfortunately for plaintiff, which has indicated it acted on its\nattorneys’ advice, Gulf Group is bound by its attorneys’ mistakes and errors. See Link\nv.

Attorney Hands\nstated at closing arguments that she did not know that some of the expenses listed had\nactually not been incurred. Although Attorney Peters may wish he had made clear that\nthe tables were submitted for the limited purpose to which he testified at trial, and\nAttorney Hands may have been ignorant of whether all the expenses were incurred or\nnot, post-action explanations do not assist plaintiff. The 2005 and 2007 claims to the\nArmy, and the original complaint in this case, all list the full potential value of the camp\npackage BPA call as the sum to which plaintiff believed it was entitled, not the expenses\nlisted in the expense table, which was submitted with the certified claim, and which\namounted to 345,717.000 KD.\n\n        At the time that Gulf Group submitted its 2005 camp package BPA Claim and\nSettlement Offer, it knew which items in the expense table it had already purchased and\nwhich items no longer would be needed because the camp package BPA call for Camp\nBuehring had been terminated. Yet, it was not until Gulf Group submitted its second\nrevised claim to Maj. Everett in 2011 that Gulf Group adjusted the expense table to\nreflect that some items had been purchased and other items had not. Indeed, Gulf\nGroup actually purchased only 19,255.000 KD worth of equipment, not 345,717.000 KD\nworth of equipment, as reflected in the submitted expense table. The assertion of\nentitlement to the full potential value of all calls issued under the camp package BPA\nand the incorrect expense table, to which both attorneys contributed, and which Saud Al\nTawash, as plaintiff’s principal, failed to oversee, resulted in submission of conflicting,\nincorrect, and reckless claims to the United States by plaintiff.\n\n      Moreover, the invoices and purchase orders submitted muddle the issues. The\ndocumentary support submitted for the 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer for the camp\npackage BPA is little more than a perplexing disarray of documents, which serves only\nto complicate an amount sought that is without legal or logical basis. Despite plaintiff’s\n\n\n                                            85\n\fafter the fact argument to the contrary, it does not appear from the claim as filed that the\nexpense table was included to prove the preparedness to perform. Rather, the cover\npage to the 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer states: “we request your kind attention and\napproval for our claim and [sic] submitting this claim with [sic] following documents for\nreimbursement of both costs and profits....:”\n\n       1)   Form 1438 Settlement proposal\n       2)   Claim and Settlement Offer\n       3)   Appendix: 1. Contract\n       4)   Appendix: 2. Cancellation Documents\n       5)   Appendix: 3. Expense Table\n       6)   Appendix: 4. Expense Documents\n       7)   Appendix: 5. Pictures of dumpsters and vehicles.\n\n(emphasis added). The 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer certified by Attorney Peters\nstates, “[t]his offer includes reimbursement for both costs and lost profits.... The\ncontract costs, when added to the anticipated contract profit, total $10,000,000.00 the\nfull contract price.” This puzzling statement appears to assert that Gulf Group is entitled\nto be paid either for the costs it already incurred, thus the inclusion of the expense table\nand expense documents for items which, as now established, were not all purchased, or\nfor the costs plaintiff would have incurred had the contract been performed with all\npotential calls exercised, a notion that is similarly unsupportable, as the costs of\nperforming the contract are the responsibility of the contractor and are deducted from\npotential net profit in breach-damage computations. See Bluebonnet Sav. Bank, FSB v.\nUnited States, 339 F.3d at 1345.\n\n        Additionally, although the 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer offered to settle for\n$4,544,339.84, less than the BPA master dollar limit of $10,000,000.00, plaintiff appears\nto believe that, had the camp package BPA call not been terminated, the government\nwould have issued calls to plaintiff up to the full master dollar limit of $10,000,000.00,\nalthough plaintiff offers no reasonable explanation or evidence in the record for this\nbelief.    The camp package BPA was not a guaranteed set of calls worth\n$10,000,000.00, rather, $10,000,000.00 was the maximum value of all calls which could\nbe issued under the camp package BPA. Furthermore, only camp package BPA call\n0001, worth $1,447,457.22, was terminated, and the limit of that camp package BPA\ncall was only $7,000,000.00. Indeed, there were other calls issued under the camp\npackage BPA to Gulf Group from 2004 to 2005, for which plaintiff was paid a total of\n$3,112,498.24. At trial, Attorney Peters testified that he may have been mistaken in\nthinking that the entire camp package BPA had been cancelled, rather than call 0001\nwith its $7,000,00.00 limit. Regardless, the camp package BPA call 0001 at issue was\nonly worth $1,447,457.22, and was terminated only twelve days after it was awarded.\n\n       Finally, the fact that Saud Al Tawash testified that he and Gulf Group did not\nknow how to compile a claim to be submitted to the United States government does not\nobviate Gulf Group’s responsibilities, or Saud Al Tawash’s responsibilities as the\nGeneral Manager of Gulf Group, nor does plaintiff’s and Saud Al Tawash’s reliance on\nthe attorneys absolve the plaintiff of its responsibilities for submitting inflated and\n\n                                            86\n\fdeficient claims. See Link v. Wabash R.R., 370 U.S. at 633-34. Saud Al Tawash\nsigned the cover letter for the 2005 camp package BPA claim, as well the settlement\noffer form. He testified at trial, however, that he did not look at the claim in detail until\nhis deposition, despite acknowledging that it was the responsibility of everyone involved\nwith the claims to make sure they were accurate. Plaintiff is bound by the actions of its\nattorneys and its General Manager, Saud Al Tawash. Plaintiff chose to rely on its\nattorneys to prepare and submit its claims. By giving its attorneys the authority to certify\nthe claims on Gulf Group’s behalf, and failing to review the submissions, plaintiff cannot\nnow hide behind the mistakes of its attorneys to avoid liability under the False Claims\nAct. It appears from the record that plaintiff, in the personages of Attorney Peters,\nAttorney Hands, and Saud Al Tawash, did not conduct even a minimal inquiry into the\naccuracy of the claims submitted. Had they done so, they would have seen the\ninconsistency of the claims and the expense table. They also should have seen the\nlack of foundation for the information included in the table. Moreover, had any one of\nthem carefully reviewed the various claims, they should have noticed that the claims\nwere for more than the BPA call amount. In addition, the attorneys should have been\nmore conversant with government contract law, including the legal status of options,\nBPAs, and calls. According to his testimony, Saud Al Tawash was a business major\nand graduate of Tulane University, who has multiple business holdings and experience\nrunning companies, including performance of other United States government contracts.\nIt is hard for this court to imagine that, had Saud Al Tawash appropriately reviewed the\n2005 Claim and Settlement Offer, he would not have realized that plaintiff stood to\nrecoup more money from its 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer than it would have made,\neven had the master dollar limit of the BPA been reached and had BPA call 0001 not\nbeen terminated. Plaintiff cannot escape the fact that it sought the BPA call dollar limit\nof $7,000,000.00 in its 2007 claim on a terminated call that was worth only\n$1,447,457.22.\n\n        As noted above, a failure to make a minimal examination of records can\nconstitute deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard, for which a contractor may be\nfound liable under the False Claims Act. See Miller v. United States, 213 Ct. Cl. at 70,\n550 F.2d at 23; United States v. TDC Mgmt. Corp., 24 F.3d at 298. The submissions\nwere prepared by Gulf Group in such a “sloppy or unsupervised fashion” that the\ngovernment was overbilled. See 132 Cong. Rec. H9,382-03. Plaintiff, as the claim\napplicant, is responsible for the accuracy of the claims presented to the government,\nregardless of who prepared them and how they were prepared. Plaintiff’s submissions\ncontain far more than mere math errors, innocent mistakes, or flawed reasoning. See\nWang ex rel. United States v. FMC Corp., 975 F.2d at 1420-21. The claims were false\non their face and lacked a reasonable basis. The facts as established in testimony at\ntrial and in the trial exhibits, including plaintiff’s written submissions to the Army, lead\nthe court to conclude that plaintiff’s varied, ill-considered, and jumbled camp package\nBPA claims in 2005 and 2007 were submitted with reckless disregard as to their truth or\nfalsity, and, therefore, under the statutory definition, constitute “false claims,” pursuant\nto 31 U.S.C. § 3729. Plaintiff’s 2011 submission addressed many of the deficiencies in\nthe previous claims and, therefore, even if considered a claim, does not serve as the\nbasis for additional liability under the False Claims Act.\n\n\n                                             87\n\f        Despite the established liability under the False Claims Act, based on reckless\ndisregard, and defendant’s correct assertion that Gulf Group submitted a claim for the\ncamp package BPA claim in excess of the amount of the camp package BPA call 0001,\ndefendant has not proven that the claims were made with intent to deceive the\ngovernment on the part of Gulf Group and Saud Al Tawash. At trial, Saud Al Tawash\ntestified that he believed the claim was correct when it was submitted. The court finds\nthe testimony of Saud Al Tawash to be sincere and credible, although he was far too\ntrusting of his attorneys. Plaintiff Gulf Group, through Saud Al Tawash, was relying on\nthe experience of Attorney Peters and of Attorney Hands in American law and\ngovernment contracts law when the claims were submitted to the United States\ngovernment.\n\n       Attorney Peters confirmed at trial that Gulf Group did not ask for an inflated or\nfalse claim to be submitted. Attorney Peters stated that it was his experience, as a\nformer military commander, that the Army would “not change horses in midstream” and\nwould continue the calls on BPAs. Attorney Peters also testified that the expense table\nwas included to show that Gulf Group was prepared to perform, not that Gulf Group was\nclaiming costs it had not incurred. Similarly, Attorney Hands appears to have honestly\nmistaken what costs plaintiff had incurred and to have had an honest belief in plaintiff’s\nflawed reasoning presented in the early claims and complaints.\n\n       At trial Saud Al Tawash readily admitted that Gulf Group had made mistakes in\nsubmitting the camp package BPA claims to the government. Saud Al Tawash pointed\nto his unfamiliarity with how to submit claims to the United States government and lack\nof understanding of the American claims process, as well as his status as a foreign\nnational, as having played a large role in what occurred. Saud Al Tawash conceded:\n\n      Yes, we did have mistakes in our claims because we don’t have\n      experience. But here we have contract in office from the leading military\n      in the world that we have high respect for and look very high up at which\n      are well-trained and well looked at and, you know, what we’ve been taught\n      in school was the opposite of what’s been actually in reality. We were\n      taught in school that there’s arbitration. There’s, you know, courts in\n      Paris, courts in locally with the Chamber of Commerce. None of that\n      happened. I mean, in Kuwait, we will never, never get to a court. They’ll\n      try to resolve it even at the police station, imagine, before it even goes up\n      to -- because it takes a lot of resources from both sides. I mean, this case\n      has been very expensive for us and I’m sure for the government. And had\n      we sat down in 2004 -- in 2005 and tried to resolve these issues, we would\n      not be here, sir.\n\n       In Daewoo, the Court of Federal Claims noted that Daewoo submitted an inflated\nclaim to get the government to “pay attention.” Daewoo Eng’g & Constr. Co. v. United\nStates, 73 Fed. Cl. at 585. The Court of Federal Claims stated:\n\n\n\n                                           88\n\f       The Project Manager testified at one point that Daewoo filed at least $50\n       million of the claim to indicate “the seriousness of the situation” and to get\n       the Government to “pay attention” so it would agree to a cheaper method\n       of constructing embankments. If so, this is further evidence of bad faith. It\n       means that Daewoo submitted a certified claim as a negotiating ploy; that\n       is, for a reason other than an attempt to recover money for which Daewoo\n       believed the Government is liable.\n\nId. (citations and footnote omitted). As noted by the Federal Circuit in affirming the trial\ncourt’s decision in Daewoo, “[i]It is well established that a baseless certified claim is a\nfraudulent claim.” Daewoo Eng’g & Constr. Co. v. United States, 557 F.3d at 1339.\n\n        Attorney Peters testified he expected the 2005 camp package BPA Claim and\nSettlement Offer would be a starting point for settlement negotiations. At a minimum,\ncounsel for plaintiff, if not Saud Al Tawash, as plaintiff’s representative, should have\nknown that to submit a claim that could not be substantiated as amounting to the actual\nvalue of the claim resulted in the making of a false claim. Although Gulf Group may\nnow understand that some of its claims were incorrect, and this court concludes that the\n2005 and 2007 camp package BPA claims were submitted with reckless disregard in\nviolation of the False Claims Act, there is insufficient evidence in the record to find that\nGulf Group intended to deceive or mislead the government, as required under the\nContract Disputes Act, when it submitted its camp package BPA claims.103\n\nB.     The Latrine Contract Claims under the False Claims Act and the Contract\n       Disputes Act\n\n        In response to plaintiff’s various complaints in the latrine case, defendant alleges\nthat plaintiff violated the False Claims Act by submitting claims for services and supplies\nunder the latrine contract, which were not provided. Defendant asserts that the claimed\nexpenses plaintiff had not incurred included expenses for all of the potential option\nperiods for the latrine contract. According to defendant, the amount in plaintiff’s 2007\nclaim and original complaint exceeds the total possible contract price. Defendant also\nalleges that “Gulf Group is liable to the United States pursuant to the Contract Disputes\nAct, 41 U.S.C. § 7103(c)(2), for the unsupported claim, plus the Government’s costs\nattributable to reviewing the claim,” because “Gulf Group knowingly and deliberately\ncertified entitlement to $4,558,428.60 for Contract 0932 [the latrine contract], despite\nthat: (a) the total contract award was $613,142.86; (b) the contract was terminated 25\ndays [sic] into the performance period; and (c) this contract was obtained through\n\n\n\n103\n   Because the court finds that plaintiff is not liable for the amount of its unsubstantiated\ncamp package BPA claims under the Contract Disputes Act, the court does not further\naddress defendant’s position that the amount of plaintiff’s settlement offer constitutes\nthe amount of its 2005 certified claim, rather than the amount for which plaintiff asserted\nentitlement.\n\n\n                                             89\n\fbribery.”104 Defendant identifies $5,373,469.64 as the unsupported amount of plaintiff’s\n2007 claim, which asserted entitlement to more than the total potential contract price,\n$6,000,000.00, and attorneys’ fees, which, according to defendant, were later identified\nas $13,387.50,105 even though the base period price of the latrine contract was\n$613,142.86. In addition, defendant argues that plaintiff asserted entitlement to\n$266,335.04106 in unsupported costs in its 2005 and 2007 submissions. Defendant\nasserts that the claimed amount, including the costs not incurred, was merely a\nnegotiating ploy. Defendant argues, with respect to plaintiff’s 2007 latrine claim\npresented to the Army for $6,000,000.00, that “the only reasonable explanation of the\nlatrine claim amount is that it was a negotiating ploy, and not an amount to which Gulf\nGroup could have honestly believed it was entitled.”\n\n        Plaintiff argues that it sought the full contract price for the base period and the\noption periods for the latrine contract because it believed that but for the terminations, it\nwould have performed the full potential term of the contract, and that this amount was\nthe sum that the government would have paid for its services. Plaintiff contends that it\nsought payment for the full contract price, including all the option periods, based on\ncase law, which plaintiff asserts establishes that a contractor may recover for\nunexercised option periods if the government made an arbitrary, capricious, or bad faith\ndecision not to exercise the option periods. Plaintiff also asserts that the government,\nthrough Maj. Davis, expressly told the bidders submitting proposals on the latrine\ncontract to include option periods because Maj. Davis believed there was a reasonable\nlikelihood the option periods would be exercised. Furthermore, plaintiff argues the\noption periods were in fact exercised with respect to other contractors who received\ncontracts for the same latrine services Gulf Group had been awarded. According to\nplaintiff, Maj. Davis told Saud Al Tawash that the contracts were “long-term” and for\npermanent camps, and that the Army required Gulf Group to supply brand new latrines\n104\n     As with the camp package BPA, defendant’s second amended answer interprets\nplaintiff’s settlement offer as the amount to which plaintiff claimed entitlement in its 2005\nlatrine contract claim. As indicated above, plaintiff asserted entitlement to more than\nthe amount of its settlement offer in its 2005 claim. The allegation regarding bribery is\ndiscussed below.\n105\n     Defendant inaccurately alleges that plaintiff claimed entitlement to $13,387.50 in\nlegal fees. A “notice of filing revised claim” that plaintiff filed in the latrine case in 2011\nclaimed entitlement to a total of $13,837.50, although the individual entries\ncorresponding to the legal fees plaintiff claims amount to $13,887.50. In addition,\nalthough defendant includes legal fees, which should be not recoverable given the\ninflated amount submitted by plaintiff with respect to the camp package BPA claim,\ndefendant inexplicably treats the legal fees that plaintiff incurred as recoverable with\nrespect to the latrine contract claim.\n106\n    As indicated below, in the court’s discussion of plaintiff’s claims, defendant\ninexplicably indicated that plaintiff had validly incurred 68,289.630 KD of costs that\nplaintiff did not claim in its 2011 notice for the latrine contract, potentially confusing\nplaintiff’s identification of 68,910.000 KD of costs plaintiff claimed to have avoided.\n\n                                              90\n\fon the contract, although the base period of the contract was only for four months.\nPlaintiff also indicates that Attorney Peters informed plaintiff it was the Army’s policy not\nto interrupt service, based on his own personal experience in Bosnia.\n\n       As with the camp package BPA claims, plaintiff contends that the expense table,\nattached as an appendix to the 2005 latrine contract Claim and Settlement Offer, was\nincluded merely to show that plaintiff was prepared to perform, and was not to be\nconsidered part of its claim. Moreover, plaintiff states that it was reasonable to submit a\nclaim in excess of the total potential contract price because an additional amount for\ninterest and attorneys’ fees normally would be granted.\n\n        Moreover, as with the 2005 camp package BPA Claim and Settlement Offer,\nplaintiff’s 2005 latrine Claim and Settlement Offer was prepared and certified by\nAttorney Peters, and the cover letter were signed by Saud Al Tawash. In the 2005\nlatrine Claim and Settlement Offer, plaintiff offered settlement in the amount of\n$4,558,428.60, an amount less than that to which plaintiff believed it was entitled, which\nplaintiff calculated to be $5,058,428.59 for the full potential contract price, including the\nbase period and all option periods. The 2005 latrine Claim and Settlement Offer stated\nthat Gulf Group “should be allowed full profit,” and “should also be compensated fully for\nthe costs incurred in furtherance of the contract. The contract costs, when added to the\nanticipated contract profit, total $5,058,428.59, the full contract price.” Nevertheless,\nGulf Group indicated it was “willing at this time to accept $4,558,428.60 as full and final\nsettlement.” Neither Saud Al Tawash nor Attorney Peters gave an explanation of the\nbasis for the proposed settlement amount. Attorney Peters did state at trial, however, “I\nadmit this is pretty aggressive in what we are going for here, but I had a bad faith\nsituation, and a bad faith termination. So there was no reason not to be aggressive with\nthe military.” As noted above, plaintiff dropped any possible claims of bad faith in any of\nthe four above-captioned cases. Attorney Peters also indicated that the final settlement\namount was approximately five to ten percent lower than the claimed amount.\n\n        In its 2007 claim submitted to the Army for the latrine contract, plaintiff increased\nthe amount sought to a sum larger than the total potential contract price, $6,000,000.00.\nThe 2007 claim did not deduct any costs that Gulf Group would have incurred had the\ncontract been fully performed. As with the initial camp package BPA claim, Gulf Group\nwould have been better off receiving the claimed amount than had it performed and had\nthe government awarded every option period of the latrine contract, a result which the\nlaw does not allow. See White v. Delta Constr. Int’l, Inc., 285 F.3d at 1043 (“[T]he non-\nbreaching party is ‘not entitled to be put in a better position by the recovery than if the\n[other party] had fully performed the contract.’” (second bracket in original) (quoting\nMiller v. Robertson, 266 U.S. at 260)).\n\n        Saud Al Tawash testified that he did not know why the 2005 latrine Claim and\nSettlement Offer was submitted for more than the entire contract price. In a post-trial\nbrief, however, plaintiff argued that it sought more than the potential contract price in\n\n\n\n\n                                             91\n\forder to include interest and attorneys’ fees.107 The 2007 claim submitted to the\ncontracting officer states that it seeks preparatory expenses, unpaid services rendered,\nlost profits, legal fees, and interest, despite the fact that in the 2006 original complaint\nfor the latrine case, Case No. 06-858C, which claimed $6,000,000.00, plaintiff asked for\nthat sum, “together with interest, costs and attorney fees.” In its first amended\ncomplaint in the latrine case, Case No. 06-858C, plaintiff sought 1,572,967.611 KD,\nwhich is more than the full latrine contract price, including the base and option periods,\nas calculated by plaintiff in its 2005 claim. In its second amended complaint, plaintiff\nnow seeks $2,830.662.20 on the latrine contract.\n\n        As with plaintiff’s 2005 camp package BPA Claim and Settlement Offer, Gulf\nGroup included with its latrine 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer an expense table, listing\ncost items it would never incur, nor could incur, given the cancellation of the contract\ntwenty days after contract award. The expense table shows a total under the “Expense”\ncolumn of 171,044.970 KD. The expense table also shows an expenditure for seven\nhundred fifty-six latrines. Saud Al Tawash testified the number of latrines on the\nexpense table was a mistake made by Gulf Group’s accounting department, given that\nthe latrine contract only called for four hundred latrines. The record reflects that Gulf\nGroup purchased six hundred latrines, of which only four hundred were intended for the\nlatrine contract at issue before this court. Attorney Peters and Saud Al Tawash gave\nthe same explanation in their trial testimony for including the expense table in the 2005\nlatrine Claim and Settlement Offer as had been offered regarding the 2005 camp\npackage BPA Claim and Settlement Offer, namely that it was only offered for proof that\nplaintiff was prepared to perform. At trial, Attorney Peters acknowledged that the\nterminology he used in the latrine Claim and Settlement Offer was “a little bit\nmisleading.” Mr. Peters also alleged that the Claim and Settlement Offers were to be a\nstarting point for settlement negotiations with the Army.\n\n        Despite plaintiff’s assertions that plaintiff had case law support for including the\noption periods in their contract claims, plaintiff ultimately conceded at closing argument\nthat no such case law exists in direct support of its position. Instead, plaintiff argued\nthat the principle of the law should be analogized, such that a finding of a bad faith\ntermination on a primary contract also would permit damages on unexercised option\nperiods. The case law plaintiff cites as providing a basis for seeking lost profits on\noption periods refers to situations in which the wronged contractor can prove that the\ngovernment chose, in bad faith, not to exercise the option periods, see Hi-Shear Tech.\nCorp. v. United States, 356 F.3d at 1374, 1375, 1380; Blackstone Consulting, Inc. v.\nGen. Servs. Admin., CBCA 718, 08-1 BCA ¶ 33,770; Greenlee Constr., Inc. v. Gen.\nServs. Admin., CBCA 416, 07-1 BCA ¶ 33,514, and not to situations in which the\ngovernment chose to terminate a contract during a base period without ever reaching or\neven making a decision as to the option periods. In the latrine case currently before the\ncourt, there is no evidence that, had the contract not been terminated, the government\n107\n   For much of its argument in its post-trial briefing, plaintiff combines the discussion of\nthe latrine and dumpster claims. It appears that when plaintiff stated that it claimed\nmore than the contract price because it included interest and attorneys’ fees, plaintiff\nwas applying the statement to both the latrine and dumpster claims.\n\n                                            92\n\fwould have exercised the option periods, or would have not exercised option periods in\nbad faith. Nor is the government generally obligated to exercise an option. See Gov’t\nSys. Advisors, Inc. v. United States, 847 F.2d at 813 (“An option is normally an option,\nand nothing in [the provision at issue], or in any other contract clause, limited the\ncircumstances under which the government could decline to exercise that bargained-for\nright in this case.”); see also Sundowner 102, LLC v. United States, 108 Fed. Cl. at 741.\n\n        As with plaintiff’s 2005 camp package BPA Claim and Settlement Offer submitted\nto the Army, Saud Al Tawash admitted having failed to review the 2005 latrine Claim\nand Settlement Offer before it was submitted, despite signing the cover page. Saud Al\nTawash cannot hide behind the mistakes of plaintiff’s attorneys for a claim he also\nsigned, and which he did not investigate before he approved it. At trial, Saud Al Tawash\ntestified that Mr. Peters “didn’t give me a justification [for the 2005 latrines claim\namount] but he did tell me that what is the amount of the contract.” In response to the\nquestion, “Did you ask Mr. Peters for a justification for this claim amount?” Saud Al\nTawash responded, “No, but I think that there is a, I think he put here this number....”\nWhen asked “[w]hat was the purpose of submitting a claim for $5 million along with a\nsettlement amount of $4.5 million?” Saud Al Tawash testified that “you’d have to ask\nMr. Peters.”\n\n        In sum, the submission of both the 2005 and 2007 latrine claims, like the camp\npackage BPA claims, were made in reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the\ninformation contained therein. Plaintiff did not conduct even a minimal inquiry into the\nbasis for the claims, see Daewoo Eng’g & Constr. Co. v. United States, 557 F.3d at\n1340; see also United States v. TDC Mgmt. Corp., 24 F.3d at 298, and prepared them\nin such a “sloppy or unsupervised fashion” that the government was overbilled. See\n132 Cong. Rec. H9,382-03. Plaintiff is responsible as the applicant for the claimed\namounts and for the accuracy of the claims, regardless of who prepared them. See\nMiller v. United States, 213 Ct. Cl. at 70, 550 F.2d at 23; see also Comm. Contractors,\nInc. v. United States, 154 F.3d at 1362. The numbers included in the submissions\ncontained more than mere math errors or flawed reasoning. See Wang ex rel. United\nStates v. FMC Corp., 975 F.2d at 1420-21. Had Saud Al Tawash reviewed the latrine\nclaims, as he should have, he would have realized they were in error. As a\nbusinessman, Saud Al Tawash should have understood that claiming more than the\nvalue of a contract is improper and not to undertake even a basic level of due diligence\nis unacceptable. The errors were particularly egregious in that the 2007 claim was for\nnearly one million dollars more than the entire contract price, even if plaintiff had not\nbeen in error in claiming option periods. The 2005 and 2007 latrine claims were\nsubmitted with reckless disregard as to their truth or falsity, and, therefore, under the\nstatutory definition, were “false claims,” pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 3729.\n\n       As with the camp package BPA claims, despite finding a violation of the False\nClaims Act, and defendant’s correct assertion that Gulf Group submitted claims in\nexcess of the amount of the terminated latrine contract, defendant has not proven that\nthe claims were made with the intent to deceive the government, as required for liability\nunder the Contract Disputes Act. As quoted above, at trial, Saud Al Tawash admitted to\n\n\n                                           93\n\fhaving made mistakes and testified that he honestly believed the 2005 latrine claim was\ncorrect when it was submitted. The court had considerable opportunity to judge Saud Al\nTawash’s credibility during the course of his testimony and finds him sincere and\ncredible. Moreover, plaintiff was relying on Attorneys Peters’ and Hands’ experience in\nAmerican law and their supposed understanding of how to submit contract claims to the\nUnited States government. Plaintiff appears to have misunderstood, and was given\nimproper legal advice as to how to calculate and submit a government contract claim,\nas well as how to calculate the amount to which plaintiff could be entitled. Plaintiff’s\nnew attorney of record similarly adopted the flawed reasoning. Although the latrine\nclaims were submitted with a reckless disregard for their accuracy, reckless disregard\ndoes not prove an intent to deceive under the Contract Disputes Act. Plaintiff should\nnot be held liable under the Contract Disputes Act for the latrine contract claims\nbecause defendant has not proven an intent to deceive on the part of Saud Al Tawash\nand Gulf Group.108\n\nC.     The Dumpster Contract Claims under the False Claims Act and the Contract\n       Disputes Act\n\n        In response to plaintiff’s complaint in the dumpster case, Case No. 06-853C,\ndefendant alleges that plaintiff violated the False Claims Act in its submission of the\n2005 and 2007 dumpster claims because plaintiff inflated its claims to include services\nand supplies plaintiff never provided. Defendant states that plaintiff had no legal basis\nfor claiming the option periods in its dumpster claim; sought payment for expenses it did\nnot incur; and asked for a sum greater than the entire contract price, including all of the\noption periods. Defendant also claims that Gulf Group “is unable to support its\n[dumpster] claim, as alleged above, due to a misrepresentation of fact or fraud,” and\nthat “Gulf Group knowingly and deliberately certified entitlement to $999,994.67109 for\nContract 0897, despite the fact that: (a) the total contract award was for $346,998.00;\n(b) the contract was terminated 33 days [sic] into the performance period; and (c) the\ncontract is tainted by bribery.” According to the defendant, “Gulf Group is liable to the\nUnited States pursuant to the Contract Disputes Act, 41 U.S.C. § 7103(c)(2), for the\nunsupported claim, plus the Government’s costs attributable to reviewing the claim.”\nDefendant identifies $1,439,614.50 as the unsupported amount of plaintiff’s 2007 claim,\nwhich asserted entitlement to more than the total potential contract price,\n$1,800,000.00, and attorneys’ fees, which, according to defendant, later were identified\n\n108\n    As with the camp package BPA claims, because the court finds that plaintiff is not\nliable for the amount of its unsubstantiated latrine contract claims under the Contract\nDisputes Act, the court does not further address defendant’s position that the amount of\nplaintiff’s settlement offer constitutes the amount of its 2005 certified claim for the latrine\ncontract.\n109\n     As with the camp package BPA and latrine contract claims, defendant’s answer\ninterprets plaintiff’s settlement offer as the amount to which plaintiff claimed entitlement\nin its 2005 dumpster contract claim. As indicated above, plaintiff asserted entitlement to\nmore than the amount of its settlement offer in its 2005 claim.\n\n                                              94\n\fas $13,387.50,110 even though the base period price of the dumpster contract was\n$346,998.00. In addition, defendant argues that plaintiff asserted entitlement to\n$415,195.29111 in unsupported costs in its 2005 and 2007 submissions. Defendant also\ncontends that plaintiff sought costs it had not incurred and that the claimed amount was\nmerely a negotiating ploy.\n\n       Plaintiff offered the same arguments regarding the dumpster claims as it did with\nrespect to the camp package BPA claims and the latrine claims, namely that the law\nprovides for lost profits on option periods when the decision not to exercise the options\nwas made in bad faith or as a result of an abuse of discretion. As noted above,\nhowever, plaintiff ultimately conceded to the court at closing argument that no such\ncase law exists in direct support of its position, and argued the principle of the law\nshould be analogized, such that a finding of a bad faith termination during the base\nperiod of a contract also would permit damages on unexercised option periods. As\nnoted above, the case law plaintiff cites as providing a basis for seeking lost profits on\noption periods refers to situations in which the wronged contractor can prove that the\ngovernment chose, in bad faith, not to exercise the option periods, see Hi-Shear Tech.\nCorp. v. United States, 356 F.3d at 1374, 1375, 1380; Blackstone Consulting, Inc. v.\nGen. Servs. Admin., CBCA 718, 08-1 BCA ¶ 33,770; Greenlee Constr., Inc. v. Gen.\nServs. Admin., CBCA 416, 07-1 BCA ¶ 33,514, and not to situations in which the\ngovernment chose to terminate a contract during the base period without ever reaching\nor even making a decision as to the option periods.\n\n        Plaintiff also argued, as it did with respect to the camp package BPA and the\nlatrine claims, that the expense table in the dumpster claims was included merely to\ndemonstrate readiness to perform the contract, that plaintiff claimed more than the\ncontract price because it was including interest and attorneys’ fees, and that the Army\nsignaled to plaintiff that the option periods were likely to be exercised. Plaintiff contends\nthat by requiring plaintiff to supply dumpsters with lids, which plaintiff had to special\norder, the government must have intended to exercise the option periods. For the\nreasons discussed above with respect to the camp package BPA claims and latrine\nclaims, the court finds that plaintiff also acted with reckless disregard when submitting\nits dumpster claims.\n110\n    Similar to the latrine claim, defendant inaccurately alleges that plaintiff claimed\nentitlement to $13,387.50 in legal fees with respect to the dumpster claim. Plaintiff’s\n2011 notice for the dumpster contract claimed entitlement to a total of $13,837.50. The\nindividual entries corresponding to legal fees plaintiff claims in the 2011 notice for the\ndumpster contract, however, amount to $13,887.50. Also similar to the latrine contract\nclaim submitted by plaintiff, although defendant includes legal fees, which should be not\nrecoverable given the inflated amount submitted by plaintiff with respect to the camp\npackage BPA claim, defendant inexplicably treats the legal fees that plaintiff incurred as\nrecoverable with respect to the dumpster contract claim.\n111\n    As indicated below, defendant inexplicably indicated that plaintiff had validly incurred\n20,540.000 KD of costs that plaintiff actually claimed to have avoided in its 2011 notice\nfor the dumpster contract.\n\n                                             95\n\f        The price for the base period of the dumpster contract was $346,998.00 and the\nsum of the all the option periods was $1,110,621.72. Therefore, the total potential price\nof the dumpster contract, including the base period and option periods, was\n$1,457,619.72.112 In its 2007 dumpster claim submitted to the Army, plaintiff nearly\ndoubled the amount sought, even from its 2005 settlement offer of $999,994.67 to\n$1,800,000.00, although this amount exceeded the total potential contract price by\napproximately $350,000.00. The $1,800,000.00 figure was the amount of damages\nclaimed in plaintiff’s December 19, 2006 original complaint in this court in Case No. 06-\n853C, the dumpster case.113 In plaintiff’s first amended complaint, plaintiff increased its\nclaim for damages to $1,946,721.78, which is nearly $500,000.00 more than the total\ncontract price, including all option periods. In its second amended complaint, plaintiff\ndrastically reduced the amount it is claiming to $780,031.63, which is still $400,000.00\nmore than the entire base period value of $346,998.00. As with plaintiff’s other claims,\nregarding its dumpster claim, plaintiff also argues that a wronged party is to be put in as\ngood a position as it would have been but for the breach. By claiming the amounts\nplaintiff claimed, however, plaintiff has asked to be put in a better position than it was in\nbefore the alleged breach. Moreover, plaintiff’s inflated numbers were substantially\nhigher than the full value of the contract, despite the fact that plaintiff’s dumpster\ncontract was terminated less than a month after it was awarded.\n\n        At trial, Saud Al Tawash testified he did not know why Gulf Group had claimed\nmore than the full contract price for the dumpster contract. Saud Al Tawash and\nplaintiff’s original attorney, Mr. Peters, offered the same explanations as he had offered\nwith respect to the camp package BPA claims and the latrine claims, testifying that the\nexpense table was included merely to show that Gulf Group was prepared to perform.\nPlaintiff’s expense table for the dumpster claim shows a total under the expense column\nof 200,501.200 KD, although Gulf Group later revealed it had spent only 59,927.871\nKD. Although Attorney Peters testified at trial that the expense table was not included\nas support for the claim, that fact was entirely unclear in the claim as submitted,\nparticularly given that the claim states in one section, “[t]his offer includes\nreimbursement of both costs and lost profits,” which could indicate costs incurred, while\nin another section, the claim suggests that costs and profits total $1,110,621.72, which\nappears to encompass the unincurred costs. Furthermore, regarding the 2005\n\n112\n    At trial, it appeared from Saud Al Tawash’s testimony that he believed the base\nperiod and the option periods for the dumpster contract together totaled $1,110,621.72.\nThis view is reflected in the 2005 claim to the Army, which stated, “it [Gulf Group]\nplaintiff should be allowed full profit. Gulf Enterprises also should be compensated fully\nfor the costs incurred in furtherance of the contract. The contract costs, when added to\nthe anticipated contract profit, total $1,110,621.72.”\n113\n    Plaintiff alleged that “[a]s a result of the Government’s cancellation of the Contract\nsolely for the convenience of the Government, Gulf Group incurred damages in the form\nof preparatory expenses, unpaid services actually rendered, lost profits, and legal fees\nin the amount presently estimated to be $1,800,000.”\n\n                                             96\n\fdumpster Claim and Settlement Offer, Saud Al Tawash similarly admitted that he signed\nthe cover page of the dumpster claim without reviewing the details of the claim.\n\n        Plaintiff’s actions with regard to the submission of the dumpster claims were in\nreckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the claims. As with the camp package BPA\nclaims and the latrine contract claims, plaintiff did not conduct even a minimal inquiry\ninto the claims, see Miller v. United States, 213 Ct. Cl. at 70, 550 F.2d at 23; see also\nUnited States v. Krizek, 111 F.3d at 942; United States v. TDC Mgmt. Corp., 24 F.3d at\n298, and the dumpster claims were prepared in such a “sloppy or unsupervised fashion”\nthat the government was overbilled. See 132 Cong. Rec. H9,382-03. Plaintiff is\nresponsible as the applicant for the accuracy of the claims, regardless of who prepared\nthem. See Daewoo Eng’g & Constr. Co. v. United States, 557 F.3d at 1340; see also\nComm. Contractors, Inc. v. United States, 154 F.3d at 1362. The submissions were the\nresult of more than mere math errors or flawed reasoning. See Wang ex rel. United\nStates v. FMC Corp., 975 F.2d at 1420-21. Had Saud Al Tawash reviewed the claims\nsubmitted under the dumpster contract, the court finds it difficult to believe that he would\nnot have realized that the claims were significantly inflated, particularly considering that\nthe 2007 claim was for a far greater amount than the total potential contract price. The\n2005 and 2007 dumpster claims were submitted with reckless disregard as to their truth\nor falsity, and, therefore, under the statutory definition of “false claims” pursuant to 31\nU.S.C. § 3729, violated the False Claims Act.\n\n       For the same reasons articulated above with respect to the camp package BPA\nclaims and the latrine contract claims, although plaintiff is liable under the False Claims\nAct for submitting claims in reckless disregard of their truth or falsity, that failure does\nnot automatically result in a finding of plaintiff’s intent to deceive when submitting the\ndumpster contract claims under the Contract Disputes Act. As noted above, the court\nhad considerable opportunity to observe Saud Al Tawash in the courtroom as plaintiff’s\nprincipal representative, including during lengthy testimony, cross-examination, and\nrebuttal, to reach its conclusion that, although Saud Al Tawash admitted to having made\nmistakes when submitting the dumpster contract claims, Saud Al Tawash offered\nsincere and credible testimony that revealed no intent to deceive. Defendant has not\nproven an intent to deceive on the part of plaintiff regarding the dumpster contract\nclaims and, therefore, has not proven liability under the Contract Disputes Act.114\n\nD.     The Bottled Water BPA Demurrage Claim under the False Claims Act and the\n       Contract Disputes Act\n\n      In its second amended answer to plaintiff’s complaint under the bottled water\nBPA, Case No. 07-82C, defendant asserts that plaintiff’s demurrage claim arising under\nthe bottled water BPA was inflated because it sought reimbursement for demurrage\n114\n    Because the court finds that plaintiff is not liable for the amount of its unsubstantiated\ndumpster contract claims under the Contract Disputes Act, the court does not further\naddress defendant’s position that the amount of plaintiff’s settlement offer constitutes\nthe amount to which plaintiff would be liable when its 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer\nripened into a claim.\n\n                                             97\n\fexpenses that were not incurred. In its briefing to this court, defendant argues that\nplaintiff submitted an 85.000 KD/day claim for demurrage for charges from its trucking\ncompany, Expeditors, although Expeditors charged only between 50.000 and 60.000\nKD/day. Defendant also contends that plaintiff’s claim was fraudulent because it did not\nconsider whether any of the delays were caused by entities other than the Army (citing\nDaewoo Eng’g & Constr. Co. v. United States, 557 F.3d at 1338).\n\n        In response, plaintiff states that the amount it claimed for demurrage has\nconsistently been 298,435.000 KD, and that the 85.000 KD/day rate included not only\nthe charges from Expeditors, but also charges for cargo insurance, administrative and\nlogistical expenses, staging area and warehouse rentals to store the water, local\ntransportation, labor, and equipment handling. Plaintiff admits, however, that its claim\nwas not complete when submitted, and failed to include all the documents necessary to\nfully support the charges it had incurred in addition to those from Expeditors.\n\n      Unlike plaintiff’s claims under the camp package BPA, the latrine contract, and\nthe dumpster contract, Gulf Group’s bottled water BPA demurrage claim remained\nconstant throughout the period between when the claim was filed with the Army and\nwhen the complaint and amended complaints were filed in this court in Case No. 07-\n82C. Also unlike plaintiff’s other three claims, plaintiff did not submit a revised bottled\nwater demurrage claim to the Army. In 2005, Gulf Group submitted a claim to the\ncontracting officer for 298,435.000 KD. In its first complaint filed in the United States\nCourt of Federal Claims, plaintiff again sought 298,435.000 KD. In its first amended\ncomplaint, it requested the same amount, and in its second amended complaint, plaintiff\nagain sought 298,435.000 KD. Thus, in stark contrast to its camp package BPA, latrine\ncontract, and dumpster contract claims, plaintiff has presented a consistent request for\nthe demurrage damages it alleges it incurred performing under the bottled water BPA.\n\n        Attorney Peters prepared plaintiff’s 2005 bottled water BPA demurrage claim and\npresented it to the Army on behalf of plaintiff, as he had done for the 2005 camp\npackage BPA, latrine, and dumpster Claim and Settlement Offers. In the case of the\nbottled water demurrage claims, however, Attorney Peters buttressed the claim with\nmore documentation, attempting to show the basis for the dinars charged. Although the\n2005 bottled water demurrage claim was incomplete, because the 2005 claim included\nonly documentation showing the charges from Expeditors, the company Gulf Group\nhired to transport the water, plaintiff subsequently provided the court with a chart\nbreaking down each demurrage expense incurred. The chart lists detailed\nexpenditures, often by date and name, for insurance, staff salaries, vehicles,\nwarehousing, staging area rent, local transportation, and loading and unloading, and it\nprovides a brief description of the nature of the charges. Plaintiff has admitted that its\n2005 bottled water demurrage claim was incomplete. The demurrage chart and the\nadditional documentation attached to the demurrage chart was not included in the 2005\nbottled water claim. In this instance, the court finds that plaintiff’s error was an “honest\nmistake.” See Riley Constr. Corp. v. United States, 65 Fed. Cl. at 269; see also United\nStates v. Sci. Applications Int’l Corp., 626 F.3d at 1274-75. There is no indication that\nplaintiff’s failure to include the demurrage chart and the additional documentation\n\n\n                                            98\n\fattached to the demurrage chart was done with a reckless disregard for the truth or\nfalsity of the claim. The chart submitted to the court shows the dinars claimed, which\nappear to be a specific replication of the expenditures plaintiff claims it incurred as a\nresult of bottled water delays.\n\n        Reviewing the invoices from Expeditors in the 2005 bottled water demurrage\nclaim, it is apparent that Expeditors was not charging 85.000 KD/day. For example,\nExpeditors charged 720.000 KD for one truck’s delay of twelve days, a total of 60.000\nKD/day, not 85.000 KD. Although this fact may have been confusing to the contracting\nofficer, Mr. Libbey, nowhere in the 2005 bottled water demurrage claim does plaintiff\nstate that its expenses arose solely from Expeditors. Rather, plaintiff’s claim states that\nit is for “demurrage charges for delays,” and that Gulf Group “incurred delay\n(demurrage) and damages.” Plaintiff initially should have included the invoices from the\nother sources of the demurrage charges, but this absence does not indicate a reckless\ndisregard for the accuracy of the charges or that plaintiff’s claim was false. Plaintiff’s\nclaim for the bottled water BPA demurrage was far more straightforward and\ntransparent than plaintiff’s camp package BPA, latrine contract, and dumpster contract\nclaims. Although somewhat incomplete, the presentation of the demurrage claim does\nnot meet the reckless disregard standard regarding liability under the False Claims Act.\nIn the case of the demurrage claim, Saud Al Tawash and Mr. Peters presented claims\nwith substantiation attached, albeit, as it turned out, incomplete information. The court\ncannot condone Saud Al Tawash, as the General Manager and representative of Gulf\nGroup, for his minimal role in preparing the demurrage certified claim, nor the apparent\nblind faith he placed in his advisors to accurately present plaintiff’s claim. The testimony\nSaud Al Tawash offered throughout the trial to the court, however, was sincere and\noffered without reservation. With respect to the bottled water demurrage claim, there\nwas an attempt to document the claim and the claim numbers remained consistent, for\nwhich reason the requisite intent under the False Claims Act is found not to have been\npresent regarding the bottled water demurrage claims. Although Saud Al Tawash\nappears not to have reviewed this claim to any greater extent than he did the other\nclaims at issue in these cases, he was a fortunate beneficiary of a claim submission\nwhich met the most minimum standards and requirements for presenting a claim. As\ndefendant has not proven a knowing presentation of a false claim under the False\nClaims Act, defendant is likewise unable to prove an intent to deceive the government\nunder the Contract Disputes Act regarding the bottled water BPA demurrage claim.\n\nII.    Special Plea in Fraud\n\n        Defendant also argues that all plaintiff’s claims should be forfeited under the\nSpecial Plea in Fraud statute, 28 U.S.C. § 2514, due to bribery in violation of 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2514, conflict of interest in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 208(a) (2000), and the submission\nof false claims. The Special Plea in Fraud statute provides:\n\n       A claim against the United States shall be forfeited to the United States by\n       any person who corruptly practices or attempts to practice any fraud\n\n\n\n                                            99\n\f       against the United States in the proof, statement, establishment, or\n       allowance thereof.\n\n       In such cases the United States Court of Federal Claims shall specifically\n       find such fraud or attempt and render judgment of forfeiture.\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2514; see also Daewoo Eng’g & Constr. Co. v. United States, 557 F.3d at\n1341.\n\n         Previous decisions by Judges of the United States Court of Federal Claims have\nindicated that “[t]he statutory forfeiture contemplated by 28 U.S.C. § 2514 is broad. The\nCourt of Claims has held that, upon a finding that claims are based on ‘a contract under\nwhich [a contractor] practiced fraud against the Government,’ as defined by this statute,\n‘all of his claims under that contract will be forfeited pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2514.’ Little\nv.

Plaintiff\nmaintains that Ms. Blake was not financially dependent on Mr. Cockerham, pursued\njobs in Kuwait of her own volition, and learned of certain jobs in Kuwait without her\nbrother’s input, including sending résumés to companies in Kuwait without her brother’s\naid. Plaintiff cites Mr. Cockerham’s testimony that he did not receive anything of value\nfrom Saud Al Tawash or Gulf Group. Also, according to plaintiff, it was not Mr.\nCockerham’s decision to award the camp package BPA, nor did he make the decision\nto award the camp package BPA call at issue before the court. In fact, Maj. Davis\nawarded all the contracts at issue in this case. Plaintiff also argues that Mr. Cockerham\ncould have tried to stop the camp package termination and to defy the order to him to\nterminate plaintiff’s latrine and dumpster contracts, but did not, indicating that he felt he\nwas under no obligation to plaintiff. Moreover, plaintiff notes that Mr. Cockerham\nawarded some contracts on which plaintiff had submitted bids to other contractors,\nwhich, according to plaintiff and according to Mr. Cockerham’s later convictions, appear\nto have bribed Mr. Cockerham. Plaintiff also argues that Gulf Group had both a factual\nand legal basis for claiming the option periods, and that the expense tables, which the\ngovernment interprets as claiming unincurred costs, were included with the claims only\nto show that Gulf Group was prepared to perform.\n\n        Section 201(b)(1) of Title 18 of the United States Code, “Bribery of Public\nOfficials and Witnesses,” provides:\n\n       (b) Whoever—\n\n              (1) directly or indirectly, corruptly gives, offers or promises\n              anything of value to any public official or person who has\n              been selected to be a public official, or offers or promises\n              any public official or any person who has been selected to\n              be a public official to give anything of value to any other\n              person or entity, with intent--\n\n\n\n                                            105\n\f                       (A) to influence any official act; or\n\n                       (B) to influence such public official or person\n                       who has been selected to be a public official\n                       to commit or aid in committing, or collude in,\n                       or allow, any fraud, or make opportunity for\n                       the commission of any fraud, on the United\n                       States; or\n\n                       (C) to induce such public official or such\n                       person who has been selected to be a public\n                       official to do or omit to do any act in violation\n                       of the lawful duty of such official or person….\n\n         shall be fined under this title or not more than three times the monetary\n         equivalent of the thing of value, whichever is greater, or imprisoned for not\n         more than fifteen years, or both, and may be disqualified from holding any\n         office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 201(b)(1) (emphasis in original).\n\n         The conflict of interest statute, 18 U.S.C. § 208(a), provides:\n\n         Except as permitted by subsection (b) hereof, whoever, being an officer or\n         employee of the executive branch of the United States Government, or of\n         any independent agency of the United States, a Federal Reserve bank\n         director, officer, or employee, or an officer or employee of the District of\n         Columbia, including a special Government employee, participates\n         personally and substantially as a Government officer or employee, through\n         decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, the rendering of advice,\n         investigation, or otherwise, in a judicial or other proceeding, application,\n         request for a ruling or other determination, contract, claim, controversy,\n         charge, accusation, arrest, or other particular matter in which, to his\n         knowledge, he, his spouse, minor child, general partner, organization in\n         which he is serving as officer, director, trustee, general partner or\n         employee, or any person or organization with whom he is negotiating or\n         has any arrangement concerning prospective employment, has a financial\n         interest--\n\n         Shall be subject to the penalties set forth in section 216 of this title.119\n\n\n119\n      18 U.S.C. § 216 provides:\n\n         (a) The punishment for an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 207, 208,\n         or 209 of this title is the following:\n\n\n                                               106\n\f18 U.S.C. § 208(a). The statute at 18 U.S.C. § 208(a) explicitly includes the wrongdoer\nand “his or her spouse and minor child” as members of the family unit, which indicates\nthat the statute does not facially apply to relationships between siblings, such as exists\nbetween Mr. Cockerham and Ms. Blake. See Slattery v. United States, 635 F.3d at\n1324 (“[T]he express mention of one thing excludes all others.”).\n\n      48 C.F.R. § 3.101-1 states:\n\n      Government business shall be conducted in a manner above reproach\n      and, except as authorized by statute or regulation, with complete\n      impartiality and with preferential treatment for none. Transactions relating\n      to the expenditure of public funds require the highest degree of public trust\n      and an impeccable standard of conduct. The general rule is to avoid\n      strictly any conflict of interest or even the appearance of a conflict of\n      interest in Government-contractor relationships. While many Federal laws\n      and regulations place restrictions on the actions of Government personnel,\n      their official conduct must, in addition, be such that they would have no\n      reluctance to make a full public disclosure of their actions.\n\n48 C.F.R. § 3.101-1 (2005). Regarding conflicts of interest generally, there need not\nhave been any actual profit from the conflict of interest; the mere temptation of dishonor\nis enough to prevent the contracting agent from acting in the government’s best\ninterests. See United States v. Miss. Valley Generating Co., 364 U.S. at 549-50.\n\n\n             (1) Whoever engages in the conduct constituting the offense\n             shall be imprisoned for not more than one year or fined in\n             the amount set forth in this title, or both.\n\n             (2) Whoever willfully engages in the conduct constituting the\n             offense shall be imprisoned for not more than five years or\n             fined in the amount set forth in this title, or both.\n\n      (b) The Attorney General may bring a civil action in the appropriate United\n      States district court against any person who engages in conduct\n      constituting an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 207, 208, or 209 of\n      this title and, upon proof of such conduct by a preponderance of the\n      evidence, such person shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than\n      $50,000 for each violation or the amount of compensation which the\n      person received or offered for the prohibited conduct, whichever amount is\n      greater. The imposition of a civil penalty under this subsection does not\n      preclude any other criminal or civil statutory, common law, or\n      administrative remedy, which is available by law to the United States or\n      any other person.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 216 (2000) (emphasis in original).\n\n                                           107\n\f       Although there is disparate testimony in the record as to how and when John\nCockerham met Saud Al Tawash, Saud Al Tawash testified that he first met Mr.\nCockerham in 2002 or 2003 in the “Diwanya” at his house. Mr. Cockerham testified that\nhe believed, however, he was briefly introduced to Saud Al Tawash by a “Mr. Eli or\nElias” during one of his earlier tours of Kuwait at the end of 2002 at a Ramadan “social\ndinner.” John Cockerham testified that he arrived in Kuwait for the tour of duty most\nrelevant to the above-captioned cases on June 30, 2004, and was “acting as a contract\nspecialist for the first few months.” Mr. Cockerham testified he “was a contract\nspecialist until about the end of October, of which [sic] I was promoted to Major and\nthen received a warrant for a very short time until December of ‘04. I was acting as the\nassistant Chief of Contracting during that time from October to December. At that point\nthen my warrant was relinquished and I went back to being an assistant contract\nspecialist until December of ’05.” According to his testimony, he and other Army officers\nwere responsible for soliciting and receiving bids for Department of Defense contracts in\nsupport of Army operations in the Middle East.\n\n        Some of the contacts between John Cockerham and members of the Al Tawash\nfamily were clearly social. Some of the contacts involved Ms. Blake’s employment. Still\nother contacts between Mr. Cockerham and Saud Al Tawash were with regard to the\ncontracts plaintiff had been awarded by the United States government. Mr. Cockerham\nmade a trip to visit Saud Al Tawash and his then-fiancé, now-wife, at their home in the\nUnited States and Mr. Cockerham attended their wedding. Mr. Cockerham stated at\ntrial that he introduced Carolyn Blake to Saud Al Tawash as his sister, and indicated\nthat she was looking for a job in Kuwait.120 Ms. Blake was offered and accepted a job in\nAugust 2004 with Gulf Telecom, a wholly owned subsidiary of Gulf Group, of which\nSaud Al Tawash was the Managing Director. Ms. Blake’s job in Kuwait apparently\ninvolved cold-calling members of the Kuwaiti public from a telephone book to sell water\npurification systems, despite the fact that Ms. Blake did not speak Arabic. According to\nthe joint stipulation of facts submitted by the parties, Ms. Blake did not sell a single\nsystem. While in Kuwait, she also worked for Saud Al Tawash’s uncle at Jireh Springs\nupon the recommendation of Saud Al Tawash. When she arrived in Kuwait to begin her\nemployment, she was met at the airport by Mr. Cockerham, Maj. Davis, Saud Al\nTawash, and Diaa Salem. Saud Al Tawash’s brother, Megbel Al Tawash, helped Ms.\nBlake find an apartment. Her monthly salary of 1,200.000 KD was delivered to her at\nher apartment in cash every month. Saud Al Tawash testified that Ms. Blake was paid\nin cash because she could not obtain a local bank account under the law in Kuwait, and\nthat cash payments were a common practice in Kuwait. In March 2005, Ms. Blake was\nwired $9,478.00 to help her pay taxes on property she owned in the United States.\n\n\n\n120\n    The testimony as to when Saud Al Tawash knew Ms. Blake was Mr. Cockerham’s\nsister, however, is inconsistent. While Mr. Cockerham and Ms. Blake testified that Saud\nAl Tawash knew she was Mr. Cockerham’s sister during her first visit to Kuwait, and Ms.\nBlake testified that her brother knew the Al Tawash family was trying to help her get a\njob, Saud Al Tawash stated that he did not realize that Ms. Blake was Mr. Cockerham’s\nsister until after he had hired her.\n\n                                          108\n\f        Mr. Cockerham is serving a sentence for conviction of conspiracy, bribery, and\nmoney laundering in connection with his participation in bribery schemes while working\nas an Army Major and staff member of the contracts office at Camp Arifjan, and for a\ntime as a contracting officer. Mr. Cockerham testified that he received “close to seven”\nmillion dollars from the contractors on the “appreciation payments” list.121 Ms. Blake is\nserving a sentence for conviction of money laundering, and accepting more than\n$3,000,000.00 on Mr. Cockerham’s behalf. Although Mr. Cockerham listed Ms. Blake\nand her then-minor son, his nephew, as contractor contacts on some bottled water\ncontracts Mr. Cockerham managed, he did not list them on the bottled water BPA\nawarded to and performed by Gulf Group. Likewise, neither Ms. Blake nor her son was\nlisted on the camp package BPA, latrine or dumpster contracts awarded to Gulf Group.\nThe criminal convictions of both Mr. Cockerham and Ms. Blake for bribery are matters of\npublic record. The public record, and the record before this court, however, do not\nindicate that Gulf Group, Saud Al Tawash, or members of his family were involved in the\nbribery schemes that led to Mr. Cockerham’s and Ms. Blake’s convictions. At trial, Saud\nAl Tawash stated that he did not give anything to anyone or hire anyone, including Ms.\nBlake, in exchange for the award of any contract or BPA. Saud Al Tawash consistently\ndenied any intent to defraud the government. Mr. Cockerham also consistently denied\nhaving received or having been offered money, gifts or favors from Gulf Group or Saud\nAl Tawash in exchange for favors or inside information on government contracts.\n\n        For a period of time during the history of the four above-captioned cases, this\ncourt, at the request of the Department of Justice, stayed all four of the cases, pending\nconclusion of Mr. Cockerham’s and Ms. Blake’s criminal proceedings in United States\nDistrict Court for the Western District of Texas. Although both Mr. Cockerham and Ms.\nBlake pled guilty to bribery, conspiracy, and money laundering in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Western District of Texas, the issue before this court is whether\nGulf Group, Saud Al Tawash, or Al Tawash family members engaged in activities which\nwould trigger liability under the Special Plea in Fraud Statute or common law fraud with\nrespect to the relevant BPAs and contracts. Although the court concludes that false\nclaims were submitted to the government for work performed and/or not performed, the\nsubmission of false claims does not establish that plaintiff or any members of the Al\nTawash family were engaged in bribery, conspiracy, money laundering, or that Gulf\nGroup submitted claims with the intent to defraud the government.\n\n      The government suggests the following scenario for consideration:\n\n      At about the same time as the payments to Ms. Blake began, Mr.\n      Cockerham became involved in the process of the Army’s award to Gulf\n      Group of contracts for dumpsters and latrines. He signed a memorandum\n      for record memorializing that the Army would award a latrine contract to\n      Gulf Group, prepared the contract folder for review by the Army’s contract\n      review board, and served as the point of contact for the board’s contract\n121\n   As indicated above, information in the indictments against Mr. Cockerham, Ms.\nBlake, and Mr. Cockerham’s wife suggests that Mr. Cockerham accepted as much as\n$9.6 million in bribes.\n\n                                          109\n\f       award action. Indeed, in September 2004, the Army awarded to Gulf\n       Group Contract No. W912D1-04-P-0932, a firm, fixed-priced contract for\n       the provision and servicing of latrines.\n\n       Mr. Cockerham also signed a memorandum for record stating that Gulf\n       Group “is recommended for award of [a dumpster] contract”; in September\n       2004, the Army awarded to Gulf Group Contract No. W912D1-04-P-0897,\n       a firm, fixed-priced contract for the provision and servicing of dumpsters.\n\n       Later, in December 2004, Mr. Cockerham issued two calls to Gulf Group\n       for bottled water, pursuant to Blanket Purchase Agreement (“BPA”) No.\n       W912D1-04-A-0052, a BPA between the Army and Gulf Group. The Army\n       would pay Gulf Group over 492,000 Kuwaiti dinar (“KD”) (over $1.6\n       million) for that bottled water. In addition, from December 2004 through\n       December 2005, Mr. Cockerham issued several “camp set” calls to Gulf\n       Group, pursuant to BPA No. W912D1-04-A-0047, another BPA between\n       Gulf Group and the Army. The Army would pay Gulf Group over $2.6\n       million for those camp sets.\n\n       While he was working on Gulf Group contracts, Mr. Cockerham\n       understood that Gulf Group was paying Ms. Blake. However, Mr.\n       Cockerham never informed the Army of that understanding. Saud Al\n       Tawash, for his part, never informed Mr. Cockerham’s superiors or\n       colleagues in the contracting office of his arrangement with Mr.\n       Cockerham’s sister.\n\n(internal citations omitted; footnote omitted). Defendant also asserts that “the Army paid\nGulf Group $2,545,273.21 pursuant to camp set calls issued by Mr. Cockerham\npursuant to the camp set BPA,” and that the payments to Ms. Blake “were in exchange\nfor contracting actions favorable to Gulf Group.”\n\n        Saud Al Tawash’s decision to employ Carolyn Blake concurrent with the time\nGulf Group sought, was awarded, and performed on United States government\ncontracts and BPA calls in Kuwait and Iraq, which were awarded by the office in which\nMr. Cockerham worked, require scrutiny. As discussed above, however, the record\nbefore the court does not establish any payments from plaintiff, Saud Al Tawash, any\nother Gulf Group employee, or member of the Al Tawash family to Mr. Cockerham,\nalthough Mr. Cockerham received payments from contractors other than Gulf Group,\nresulting in Mr. Cockerham’s and Ms. Blake’s convictions. Both Mr. Cockerham and\nMs. Blake pled guilty at their criminal proceedings, as a result of which, no transcripts of\ntrials with details of what occurred are available, nor do the plea transcripts offer much\nfactual detail. From the record before this court, it appears that Ms. Blake was hired to\nwork for Gulf Telecom, not Gulf Group. Mr. Cockerham also testified at trial that Ms.\nBlake told him that she had worked out temporary employment with Saud Al Tawash\nand that Gulf Telecom paid her a salary, but that Mr. Cockerham was not aware at the\ntime of Ms. Blake’s employment conditions.\n\n\n                                            110\n\f       The exhibits before this court include a note, which is addressed to no one and\nappears never to have been sent, drafted by Mr. Cockerham after being questioned by\nfederal investigators in 2007. Based on the trial testimony, the note is a stream of\nconsciousness written to himself, similar to other such rambling notes in the record.\nThe note reads:\n\n      1. Carolyn Get Rid of Everything\n      2. Do not talk to them at All\n      3. Make sure no excess money is lying around. Put it all in the bank.\n      4. Make sure no keys are laying around.\n      5. Tell Saud if ask to don’t confess to anything. Tell them they can talk to\n      his lawyer that he never called Fernand Peters [sic] gave me a penny for a\n      contract. We will do business later in trading.\n      6. Tell Carolyn start business in Dubai.\n      7. It’s perfect legal for Carolyn to work for him doing admin paperwork as\n      long as he and I didn’t have an agreement. She never work on nor\n      prepared any contracts or worked in that Department. She got the job on\n      her own.\n\n(emphasis and strike-through in original).\n\nMr. Cockerham testified at trial that he drafted, but never sent, the note to Ms. Blake or\nanyone else. This disjointed note is consistent with other disjointed writings in the\nrecord authored by Mr. Cockerham, also addressed to no one, and consistent with his\nsometimes contradictory and rambling testimony offered at trial. Taken together with\nhis testimony, Mr. Cockerham’s notes appear to be stream-of-consciousness notes to\nhimself. At trial, Mr. Cockerham stated that these notes were “just brainstorming,” and\nthere were “about 70 pages of these notes, just -- I’m just on a mental rampage, just\neverything I can -- that was coming to mind….” For example, another handwritten note\nin the record discussed by Mr. Cockerham at trial, perhaps drafted with Ms. Blake in\nmind, but also never sent, states:\n\n      0.

Marriage Kuwaiti Only / Non American\n       10. Sponsor Aunt/ Legal/ work / no exchange for...for Jireah Ad[] Mission work,\n           Christian counselor\n\n(all punctuation in original).\n\n       Defendant argued in a post-trial brief that\n\n       the instructions contain falsehoods that demonstrate that Mr. Cockerham\n       and Saud Al Tawash were engaged in bribery. The instructions state that\n       Ms. Blake “got the job on her own” even though she obtained her situation\n       with Saud Al Tawash only after Mr. Cockerham introduced her to Mr. Al\n       Tawash as his sister and mentioned to him that she was looking for work\n       in Kuwait. The instructions also state that Ms. Blake did “admin\n       paperwork” for Saud Al Tawash, even though Ms. Blake never worked for\n       anyone in Kuwait. The falsity of those statements demonstrates that,\n       contrary to what Mr. Cockerham wrote, he and Saud Al Tawash had an\n       agreement. That agreement was that Gulf Group would give Mr.\n       Cockerham something of value; that is, money to a sister with whom he\n       was close, in exchange for favorable contracting actions toward Gulf\n       Group. Indeed, if Mr. Cockerham did not have such an agreement with\n       Saud Al Tawash, there would have been no need for Mr. Cockerham to\n       write down the instruction that his sister inform Saud Al Tawash of the\n       absence of such an agreement, or that she “get rid of everything.”\n\n(internal citation omitted).\n\n        At trial, Saud Al Tawash and Megbel Al Tawash each adamantly, and\nspecifically, denied involvement in any fraudulent activity, including any involvement in\ntrading favors, money, or jobs for favorable contract treatment. Saud Al Tawash\ntestified at length during the trial. Despite exhibiting poor and overly trusting judgment,\npoor choice of friends and advisors, and failure to conduct careful review of the claims\nsubmitted by plaintiff to the government, Saud Al Tawash’s testimony seemed\nstraightforward and did not appear fallacious to the trial judge. Moreover, Saud Al\nTawash’s testimony stood up during aggressive cross-examination. Although perhaps\nnaïve about how to interact with the Army while seeking and performing government\ncontracts, and how his hospitability would be interpreted, Saud Al Tawash impressed\nthe court during three weeks of trial as credible, sincere, and cooperative, as well as\neager to refute any charges or implications of illicit or anti-American activity, which he\nadamantly denied. There is insufficient evidence in the record to indicate that plaintiff or\nany member of the Al Tawash family paid money in exchange for favors. Saud Al\nTawash also appeared to the court to be an individual who believed he could offer good\nservice to support the war and who was supportive of United States efforts in the region,\nwhile at the same time operating successful businesses.\n\n\n\n\n                                            112\n\f        Saud Al Tawash testified that he hired Ms. Blake because of her English skills.122\nSaud Al Tawash also explained that he hired Ms. Blake because he was looking for an\nAmerican employee to work with Gulf Telecom’s American clients. Saud Al Tawash\ntestified:\n\n      She’s an American. She understands the culture very well of the military.\n      She understands the American culture. She knows the holidays. She’s\n      somebody who has experience with that environment…. She’s American\n      citizen and clients are Americans. She’s ex-military; she has retail\n      experience; she has experience in security as a guard and she has the\n      personality to -- the attitude, for this particular position. She’s educated.\n      She has a degree. She has also a -- quite a good knowledge of the\n      different demographics and segments of the military.\n\n        According to Saud Al Tawash, Ms. Blake was offered the same benefits that\nwere offered to other Americans working for Gulf Telecom. According to Ms. Blake,\nSaud Al Tawash supplied her with materials to set up a small home office in her\napartment, and while Ms. Blake was supposed to work in call centers, a lack of\npaperwork made it impossible for her to do so. In addition, a stand-off with AT & T\nprevented Gulf Telecom from opening several of the call centers that were planned.\nDespite Ms. Blake’s inability to perform the job she was hired to do, and her testimony,\n“I never did work for anyone,” Gulf Telecom continued paying Ms. Blake for the\nremainder of the year, pursuant to the requirements of Kuwaiti labor laws. The\nevidence in the record of the pay and benefits Ms. Blake received may be troubling from\nan American perspective, but alone is not sufficient to establish that plaintiff or Saud Al\nTawash engaged in bribery or attempted to gain influence with Mr. Cockerham through\nMs. Blake’s employment. Rather Kuwaiti labor law obligations and Saud Al Tawash’s\nKuwaiti sense of hospitality to foreigners, which also was testified to during the trial,\nsuggest a difference in culture, but not necessarily criminal, or civilly actionable,\nbehavior on the part of plaintiff or members of the Al Tawash family. Saud Al Tawash\nalso testified that he did not understand that hiring Ms. Blake would be a conflict of\ninterest. Saud Al Tawash stated: “As long as she doesn’t work on contracts that are --\nno, I did not think of it as a conflict of interest because she was not working on any\ncontracts then or after.” The record does not establish that the hiring of Ms. Blake by\nSaud Al Tawash was intended as a bribe or as a way to influence Mr. Cockerham in his\ncapacity as a member of the contract office in Kuwait. Moreover, defendant has not\nprovided the court with any regulation or law which would have required plaintiff to\ninform the Army of the employment of Mr. Cockerham’s sibling, Ms. Blake, by Gulf\nTelecom. The subsequent convictions of Mr. Cockerham and Ms. Blake, without\nestablishing a link to plaintiff Gulf Group, or Saud Al Tawash, also do not support that\nplaintiff or Saud Al Tawash were guilty of any acts of bribery or intent to influence\ngovernment contract activity.\n\n122\n   Mr. Cockerham also testified, regarding Gulf Telecom’s hiring of his sister, “as I\nmentioned earlier, one of the things that, the reason for hiring her was, one, for English\nspeaking liaison.”\n\n                                           113\n\f        Although not the most coherent or credible witnesses at trial, neither Mr.\nCockerham nor Ms. Blake implicated Gulf Group, Saud Al Tawash, or other members of\nthe Al Tawash family in improper or illicit activities of any kind. John Cockerham and\nCarolyn Blake, although convicted of bribery with respect to other contractors, both\naffirmatively and repeatedly denied any involvement by the plaintiff or the Al Tawash\nfamily in any bribery scheme or trading Ms. Blake’s employment for government favors.\nMr. Cockerham’s scribbled, apparently free-association notes that are in the record\nsuggest he had a relationship with Saud Al Tawash. The Al Tawash name, however,\ndoes not appear on the list of individuals identified as having made payments to Mr.\nCockerham, nor does Gulf Group, or Gulf Telecom, appear on the list of corporations\nnamed, which lists “AA,” an abbreviation for Allied Arms, “Jireh,”123 a reference to Jireh\nVentures, “Jas,” a reference to Jasmine International, “Zenith,” a reference to Ghopal\nZenith, “Lee Dynamics,” “Green Valley,”124 “Falah,” a reference to the owner of Trans\nOrient, “FS,” a reference to Future Services, “KMS,” a reference to Kamal Sultan, and\n“Terry,” a reference to Terry Hall from Freedom Catering Company. The exhibits in the\nrecord, including the hand-written notes authored by Mr. Cockerham, do not connect\nplaintiff, Saud Al Tawash, or any member of the Al Tawash family with any illicit contract\nactivity involving Mr. Cockerham or any other public official in the United States Army.\nObserving both Ms. Blake and Mr. Cockerham on the witness stand, when asked about\ntheir relationships with plaintiff and Saud Al Tawash, their repeated denials of fraudulent\nactivity involving plaintiff or members of the Al Tawash family seemed plausible,\nacknowledging, of course, their suspect credibility as convicted felons. Moreover, Mr.\nCockerham was the individual who terminated Gulf Group’s latrine and dumpster\ncontracts within weeks of their having been awarded to plaintiff.\n\n123\n    Mr. Cockerham stated that “Jireh” in his list of bribes referred to Jireh Ventures, not\nJireh Springs, the latter a Kuwaiti company apparently run by Jamal Al Dahma, an uncle\nof Saud Al Tawash. At trial, Mr. Cockerham stated that Jamal Al Dahma was not\ninvolved in Jireh Ventures. Mr. Cockerham also testified that he asked Mr. Cruz to start\na business in San Antonio, Texas, which was called Jireh Ventures, for the purpose of\nproviding supplies to entities in Kuwait from the United States. When he met with Ann\nBrickley and Mark Pletcher of the Department of Justice, Mr. Cockerham told them,\nhowever, that Jireh Ventures was a Kuwaiti company. At trial, Mr. Cockerham stated\nthat “the final report that was actually written up was their [the Department of Justice’s]\nreport. It was not really from the briefings. And so I was basically toward the end told\nwhat I would say.”\n124\n    Mr. Cockerham explained that one of Green Valley’s translators falsely told his\nemployers that he had landed a contract for Green Valley through Mr. Cockerham, and\nthat Green Valley had to pay both Mr. Cockerham and the translator. Mr. Cockerham\ntestified that the money he received from Green Valley, a company with which Gulf\nGroup had a joint venture for a short period of time in 2004, was not from Saud Al\nTawash and that he had received payments from Green Valley in the summer of 2005,\nafter the critical dates at issue in the above-captioned cases in 2004. There is\ninsufficient evidence in the record that, if bribe money came from Green Valley, any\nmoney flowed through, or was in anyway associated with, plaintiff or Saud Al Tawash.\n\n                                           114\n\f       Defendant also asserts that Saud Al Tawash’s reaction when he heard that\nrepresentatives of the federal investigation had contacted Mr. Cockerham and Ms.\nBlake “demonstrate that Saud Al Tawash and Mr. Cockerham were engaged in bribery.”\nDefendant points out that Saud Al Tawash contacted Ms. Blake and asked her what the\ninvestigators wanted, raising Mr. Cockerham by name. This reaction, without more,\nhowever, does not establish that Saud Al Tawash had engaged in acts of bribery and\ndefendant’s allegations to the contrary are merely speculation. Saud Al Tawash’s\nactions just as well could have been generated by curiosity regarding several individuals\nhe knew and considered friends, and with whom he had been in contact in Kuwait.\nSaud Al Tawash and Mr. Cockerham indeed appear to have become social friends.\nAccording to the testimony, Mr. Cockerham developed a number of social friendships\nwith local citizens in Kuwait during his time in Kuwait.\n\n      Moreover, none of the many government witnesses who served in Kuwait with\nMr. Cockerham, civilian or military, including those who worked in the contracting office,\neven intimated that there was an improper relationship based on bribery between Gulf\nGroup or Saud Al Tawash and any employees of the United States. In fact, Gulf Group\nwas not treated with special handling, quite the contrary, with the latrine and dumpster\ncontracts terminated shortly after they were awarded by Mr. Cockerham.\n\n        Significantly, from the record before the court, it is not clear that Mr. Cockerham\nhad sufficient authority to have influenced the award or management of contracts within\nthe structure of the Army contracting office at Camp Arifjan. Although he held a warrant\nfor a short period of time, many contracting decisions seem to have been directed by\nofficials above his pay grade. Maj. Davis awarded each of the contracts and BPAs at\nissue. At the time the contracts were awarded to plaintiff, Mr. Cockerham was not a\ncontracting officer, but rather a contract specialist. Mr. Cockerham testified that he “was\na contract specialist until about the end of October” 2004, after the award of the BPAs\nand contracts at issue in September 2004. Maj. Trimble testified that he did not believe\nthat a contract specialist has the ability to influence the award of a contract, although a\ncontract specialist could make a recommendation. Mr. Cockerham also testified that a\ncontract specialist cannot influence the award of a contract and that the contract\nspecialist merely passed on the recommendation from the Office of the Chief of\nContracting. Col. Hess, the head of contracting at Camp Arifjan, also noted that the\ncontract specialist assembles a package for the Contract Review Board with a\nrecommendation of who should receive the contract. It is clear contract specialists,\nwithout a warrant, cannot sign awards of contracts. See Stout Road Assocs., Inc. v.\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed. Cl.</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 756 (2008) (“Only government officials who possess a\nContracting Officer's warrant are authorized to bind the United States to a contract.”\n(citing 48 C.F.R. § 1.602-1)).\n\n       In sum, defendant has not adequately connected the dots between Mr.\nCockerham and Gulf Group or Saud Al Tawash to support defendant’s allegations of\nbribery with an intent to influence the award of government contracts. Regarding the\ncamp package BPA, the award was made by Maj. Davis on September 30, 2004. Mr.\nCockerham was on the Contract Review Board that recommended award of the camp\n\n\n                                           115\n\fpackage BPA to Gulf Group, but defendant has not demonstrated that Mr. Cockerham\nwas bribed by plaintiff or that Mr. Cockerham significantly, or improperly, influenced or\ncaused the award of the BPA to plaintiff. For example, there is no evidence in the\nrecord from others on the Contract Review Board that Mr. Cockerham was particularly\ninsistent that the camp package BPA be awarded to plaintiff. The latrine contract was\nawarded by Maj. Davis on September 28, 2004, and Mr. Cockerham was the contract\nspecialist assigned to the contract. The dumpster contract was awarded by Maj. Davis\non September 20, 2004. Mr. Cockerham served as the contract specialist for the latrine\nand dumpster contracts. With respect to the dumpster contract, oddly, Mr. Cockerham\nsigned the Contract Review Board Memorandum, even though he was not a member of\nthe Contract Review Board that recommended the award of the dumpster contract.\nDefendant, however, has not demonstrated that Mr. Cockerham used his influence to\nunfairly cause awards or other favorable action on the latrine or dumpster contracts to\nGulf Group. Finally, for the bottled water BPA, the award was made by Maj. Davis on\nSeptember 28, 2004, with Mr. Cockerham as the contract specialist. Like the dumpster\ncontract, Mr. Cockerham signed a Contract Review Board Memorandum, but indicated\nthat his duty position was that of a “Contracting Officer” even though he was not a\nmember of the Contract Review Board for the bottled water BPA. Mr. Cockerham,\nhowever, did terminate the latrine and dumpster contracts, shortly after the awards were\nmade, actions obviously unfavorable to plaintiff.\n\n        Although there may have been numerous irregularities in how the Army\nproceeded to award and manage the BPA calls and contracts at Camp Arifjan, including\nincidents of bribery involving Mr. Cockerham with other contractors, defendant has not\ndemonstrated that plaintiff or members of the Al Tawash family were involved in any\nacts of bribery. Ms. Blake was employed by Gulf Telecom at a time when Gulf Group\nwas awarded contracts and while Mr. Cockerham was working in the contracting office.\nThere is no evidence, however, that, but for the hiring of Ms. Blake, Gulf Group, a\ncontractor which had been awarded and held other United States contracts in support of\nthe activities in the Iraq war theatre, independently would not have won the contracts.\nSignificantly, Mr. Cockerham was the Army official who terminated the latrine and\ndumpster contracts, and, as reflected in the October 20, 2004 Memorandum for Record,\npurportedly recommended terminating the camp package BPA call for Camp Buehring.\nThe government has offered no explanation as to why Mr. Cockerham would terminate\nthe latrine and dumpster contracts and recommend terminating the camp package BPA\ncall for Camp Buehring, if he were involved in a scheme to award contracts to plaintiff\nand assist Gulf Group to gain advantages in the contracting process. In fact, the record\nsuggests Mr. Cockerham did not take very good care of his friend, Saud Al Tawash, or\nof Gulf Group.\n\n        Although the defendant has not demonstrated an intent to defraud the\ngovernment under the Special Plea in Fraud statute, an additional question remains as\nto whether Ms. Blake’s employment created a conflict of interest which allows for\nrescission or disgorgement. The court finds that the evidence in the record is\ninsufficient to conclude that Ms. Blake’s employment relationship with Gulf Telecom and\nher relationship to Mr. Cockerham tainted the award of the BPAs and contracts at issue.\n\n\n                                          116\n\fThe court recognizes that Mr. Cockerham violated statutes and regulations with respect\nto contractors other than plaintiff, for which he is currently serving a federal prison\nsentence, but defendant has not presented the court with evidence indicating that Mr.\nCockerham’s potential violations had an impact on the award of the contracts or BPAs\nto plaintiff which are at issue in the above-captioned cases, or that Gulf Telecom’s\nemployment of Ms. Blake created a conflict of interest. Although Mr. Cockerham should\nnot necessarily be considered the most reliable of witnesses, he continued to insist\nthroughout the proceedings before this court that he did not receive any payments from\nor give special favors to Saud Al Tawash or Gulf Group. Mr. Cockerham repeatedly\ninsisted that Saud Al Tawash was a friend.\n\n       That Gulf Telecom was identified as a wholly owned subsidiary of Gulf Group\nthat employed Ms. Blake while Mr. Cockerham was involved in discussions preceding\nthe award of Gulf Group’s contracts and was involved in contract management, certainly\nmight be considered less than wise under American standards. The court notes,\nhowever, that 18 U.S.C § 208 does not appear to apply to conflicts of interest arising out\nof the employment of a government employee’s sibling. In addition, other potentially\napplicable regulations, such as 5 C.F.R. § 2635.502, which prohibits a government\nemployee from participating in a matter that “is likely to have a direct and predictable\neffect on the financial interest of a member of his household, or knows that a person\nwith whom he has a covered relationship is or represents a party to such matter,” do not\nclearly apply to the employment Ms. Blake, Mr. Cockerham’s sister, entered into with\nGulf Telecom. See Letter to a Designated Agency Ethics Official, OGE Informal\nAdvisory Letter 85 X 14, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">57313</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3 (Sept. 23, 1985) (indicating that “no\ncriminal conflict of interest statutes” applied to a government employee’s work on a\nmatter that may have affected the financial interest of his sibling, but recommending that\nthe employee “might wish to recuse himself...because of the degree of appearance of\npotential partiality”). Defendant has not demonstrated that Mr. Cockerham was placed\nin a position that ordinarily would lead a court to assume that his judgment was impaired\nin his official capacity with respect to Gulf Group, when compared to the authorities on\nwhich defendant relies. See, e.g., United States v. Miss. Valley Generating Co., 364\nU.S. at 556 (concluding that a government advisor’s position as an officer who shared in\na company’s profits “at the very least” created an indirect financial interest in a\ngovernment contract when there was a substantial likelihood that a financing agreement\nrelated to the contract would be awarded to the company); K & R Eng’g Co. v. United\nStates, 222 Ct. Cl. at 344, 616 F.2d at 470 (concluding that a government employee’s\nadministration of contracts in which he received a percentage of the profits realized\ncreated a conflict of interest).\n\n        The record before the court does not indicate that Gulf Group’s contracts were\ntainted by an impermissible conflict of interest. Gulf Group appears to have been an\n“innocent contractor” that entered legitimately into a government contract, despite Mr.\nCockerham’s improper and illegal conduct in other regards. See Godley v. United\nStates, 5 F.3d at 1475 (“Illegal acts by a Government contracting agent do not alone\ntaint a contract and invoke the void ab initio rule. Rather, the record must show some\ncausal link between the illegality and the contract provisions.”). Although the decisions\n\n\n                                           117\n\fleading to Ms. Blake’s employment by Saud Al Tawash and Gulf Telecom may have\nbeen naïve by American standards, the record before the court does not establish that\nplaintiff received special treatment from Mr. Cockerham or that Saud Al Tawash’s\nrelationship with Ms. Blake was such that the court can conclude that any impropriety\ntook place, or that Saud Al Tawash or Gulf Group engaged in actions which evidence\nan intent to bribe or defraud the United States.\n\nA.    The Camp Package BPA Claims Under the Special Plea in Fraud Statute\n\n        In its third amended answer to plaintiff’s complaint, defendant alleges that\nplaintiff’s claims must be forfeited under the Special Plea in Fraud statute and that the\ncalls issued under plaintiff’s camp package BPA and, as addressed below, bottled water\nBPA, must be rescinded due to bribery, conflict of interest, and fraud. Defendant\nasserts that Gulf Group artificially inflated its camp package BPA claim, and that,\nwithout a plausible basis for the amount sought, the claim was fraudulent. Defendant\ndid not directly raise claims of rescission and disgorgement for the dumpster or latrine\ncontracts. Defendant contends with respect to the camp package BPA that plaintiff\nsought payment for expenses it had not incurred. According to defendant, Gulf Group\nrepresented in its 2005 claim that it had spent 345,717.000 KD, when it had spent only\n19,323.000 KD. Additionally, defendant insists that the camp package BPA claims were\nfraudulent because, at trial, Saud Al Tawash and Mr. Peters disagreed as to the amount\nof the 2005 claim, and neither admitted devising the settlement offer amount. Finally,\ndefendant states, “Gulf Group fraudulently viewed the pre-2011 version of the camp set\nclaim [sic] an opening gambit in the negotiation of a settlement amount, rather than the\namount to which it was entitled.” (citing Daewoo Eng’g and Constr. Co. v. United\nStates, 73 Fed. Cl. at 596). Defendant, therefore, claims that plaintiff must disgorge the\namounts the government paid to plaintiff under the camp package BPA, and, as\ndiscussed below, the bottled water BPA.\n\n        Defendant argues that Ms. Blake was hired in exchange for Mr. Cockerham\ntaking favorable contracting actions toward plaintiff, which defendant asserts\ndemonstrates both a conflict of interest and bribery. According to defendant, Ms. Blake\nwas hired and began receiving payments shortly before plaintiff was awarded the BPA\ncalls and other contracts, and Ms. Blake never did any work for the payments she\nreceived. The statutes to which defendant points in its counterclaims, violations of\nwhich defendant claims demonstrate fraud, are 18 U.S.C. § 201(b)(1) and 18 U.S.C.\n§ 208(a), both of which are criminal statutes. As noted above, although both Mr.\nCockerham and Ms. Blake have been criminally convicted of conspiracy, bribery, and\nmoney laundering, their convictions were based on transactions involving contractors\nother than plaintiff Gulf Group or members of the Al Tawash family. Defendant argues\nthat “[p]rotection of the integrity of the Federal procurement process from the fraudulent\nactivities of unscrupulous Government contractors and dishonest Government agents\nrequires a refund to the Government of sums already paid to such a contractor pursuant\nto the contract. A contractor must disgorge the amounts received under a contract\ntainted by conflict-of-interest.” (citing K & R Eng’g Co. v. United States, 222 Ct. Cl. at\n354, 616 F.2d at 476). Defendant also claims that payments to Ms. Blake constituted a\n\n\n                                           118\n\fviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 201(b)(1), and that these payments also created a common law\nconflict of interest. Plaintiff responds that the government has not cited to any legal\nbasis for its rescission and disgorgement claims, and that the federal Conflict of Interest\nstatute, 18 U.S.C. § 208(a), is not applicable.\n\n        The court finds it difficult to understand how plaintiff’s two attorneys, Attorney\nPeters and Attorney Hands, could have thought Gulf Group was entitled to the master\nBPA limit of the camp package BPA or the limit of camp package BPA call 0001 when\ncall 0001 was worth only $1,447,457.22, despite testimony from Attorney Peters that he\nbelieved the claim was correct at the time it was submitted. Although the attorneys\nwere legally incorrect and reckless in preparing the claims, and Saud Al Tawash failed\nto properly review the claims, which resulted in a violation of the False Claims Act, the\ncourt concludes that plaintiff and Saud Al Tawash do not appear to have had the\nspecific intent necessary to prove fraud under the Special Plea in Fraud statute. See\nDaewoo Eng’g & Constr. Co. v. United States, 73 Fed. Cl. at 584 (noting that, under the\nSpecial Plea in Fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 2514, “[m]ere negligence is not sufficient”);\nsee also Miller v. United States, 213 Ct. Cl. at 69, 550 F.2d at 22 (“[F]raud, resulting in\nforfeiture, can be found only on the basis of clear and convincing evidence. An intent to\ndeceive the Government must be proved.”) (citations omitted). Saud Al Tawash should\nnot have blindly trusted his advisors before signing the documents, but the record\nbefore the court does not demonstrate that there were intentional, corrupt, or fraudulent\npractices engaged in by plaintiff or Saud Al Tawash during the course of the award or\nperformance under the camp package BPA.\n\n        In addition, as discussed above, defendant has not convinced the court that there\nis sufficient evidence in the record of a conflict of interest or bribery linked to the award\nor management of the camp package BPA or of an intent to defraud, warranting\nrescission or disgorgement. The record contains no evidence that Gulf Group had the\nintent to deceive the government in obtaining its camp package BPA or camp package\nBPA calls. Defendant offered, as part of its evidence, that plaintiff failed to inform the\nArmy of Gulf Telecom’s hiring of Ms. Blake. As noted above, however, defendant has\ncited no regulation or law which would have required plaintiff to inform the Army of Ms.\nBlake’s employment by Gulf Telecom and the record does not establish that the\nrelationship between Saud Al Tawash and Ms. Blake was such that the court must\nassume an impropriety had taken place. Moreover, Mr. Cockerham’s other illegal\nactivities have not been linked to a taint in Gulf Group’s contracts. Defendant,\ntherefore, has failed to demonstrate entitlement to forfeiture under the Special Plea in\nFraud or rescission and disgorgement under common law fraud with regard to the camp\npackage BPA.\n\nB.     The Latrine and Dumpster Claims Under the Special Plea in Fraud Statute\n\n     With respect to the Special Plea in Fraud statute, defendant makes identical\narguments with regard to forfeiture of plaintiff’s claims under both the latrine and\ndumpster contracts. In its filing, plaintiff also combines its responses to the latrine and\ndumpster contract counterclaims. The court, therefore, addresses the Special Plea in\n\n\n                                            119\n\fFraud issues raised by these two contracts together.125 Defendant provides the same\narguments as it does with regard to the camp package BPA, including that plaintiff\nviolated the Special Plea in Fraud statute by bribing Mr. Cockerham under 18 U.S.C.\n§ 201(b)(1), which also created a conflict of interest, and by submitting claims for\namounts to which it knew it was not entitled. According to defendant, Saud Al Tawash\nand Mr. Cockerham entered into an arrangement whereby Ms. Blake would be\nemployed and Mr. Cockerham would award contracts to Gulf Group. Defendant alleges\nby way of example for the dumpster contract:\n\n      Mr. Cockerham’s sister began receiving monthly payments from Gulf\n      Group’s operations manager, at the behest of Gulf Group’s general\n      manager, both of whom were directors of Gulf Group. Mr. Cockerham\n      was aware of those payments, and understood them to be from Gulf\n      Group. In September 2004, Mr. Cockerham signed a memorandum for\n      record stating that Gulf Group “is recommended for award of [a dumpster]\n      contract.” The Army awarded the dumpster contract, Contract No.\n      W912D1-04-P-0897, to Gulf Group in September 2004. The dumpster\n      contract was not terminated until October 22, 2004. Both Gulf Group and\n      Mr. Cockerham understood the nature of the arrangement.\n\n        As described above, defendant alleges that neither Mr. Cockerham nor Saud Al\nTawash told the Army about Ms. Blake’s employment, that Saud Al Tawash questioned\nMs. Blake about her meeting with the federal investigators, and that Mr. Cockerham\nwrote a note indicating that Saud Al Tawash should not “confess to anything.”\nDefendant further alleges that plaintiff submitted inflated claims to the government that\nwere unsupported and fraudulent. Finally, defendant contends that the inflated amounts\nclaimed were merely a negotiating ploy, as indicated by Mr. Peters’ testimony, and that\nplaintiff submitted the claims to Mr. Cockerham with reason to believe he would act\nfavorably on them.\n\n        Plaintiff responds using many of the same arguments that it asserted with regard\nto the False Claims Act, including that it had a legal basis for claiming lost profits on\nunexercised option years and that the Army indicated to plaintiff there was a reasonable\nlikelihood the options would be exercised. Plaintiff further argues that the expense\ntables submitted were not part of the latrine and dumpster claims, but “were included\nsimply to demonstrate that Gulf Group was prepared to perform under the contract if it\nhad been given a fair opportunity to do so.” Plaintiff also denies that the claim amounts\nsought were a negotiating ploy. As to defendant’s bribery and conflict of interest\nallegations, plaintiff contends that Mr. Cockerham had no authority to make the award of\nthe contracts, and that Saud Al Tawash asked Ms. Blake about her meeting with the\nfederal investigators as “a conscientious individual who takes very seriously any federal\ninvestigation involving someone with whom he had been involved.” Plaintiff further\nurges that Mr. Cockerham’s hand-written notes do not prove that Gulf Group or Saud Al\nTawash were involved in bribing Mr. Cockerham. Finally, plaintiff points out that,\n125\n    As noted above, defendant did not directly raise claims of rescission and\ndisgorgement for the latrine contract and dumpster contract.\n\n                                          120\n\fconsidering all the contractors Ms. Blake and Mr. Cockerham listed and admitted had\nbribed them, neither Ms. Blake nor Mr. Cockerham ever implicated plaintiff or any\nmembers of the Al Tawash family.\n\n       The government must prove by clear and convincing evidence that plaintiff\nintended to defraud the government for the court to conclude that forfeiture is warranted\nunder the Special Plea in Fraud statute. See Daewoo Eng’g & Constr. Co. v. United\nStates, 557 F.3d at 1341. As discussed above in the discussion of the False Claims\nand Contract Disputes Acts, the evidence offered as to Jireh Springs and Green Valley\ndoes not conclusively implicate Gulf Group, Saud Al Tawash, or any other member of\nthe Al Tawash family. Regarding defendant’s allegations of fraudulent false claims with\nrespect to the latrine and dumpster contracts, despite the fact that much of plaintiff’s\nreasoning with regard to the availability of lost profits was erroneous for option years\nand unissued calls, the court finds Saud Al Tawash to have been a sincere and credible\nwitness. Saud Al Tawash testified that Maj. Davis told him that Camp Arifjan would be\npermanent, and that if Gulf Group performed well it would have the dumpster and latrine\ncontracts for the full term, including all option periods. Saud Al Tawash also explained\nthat he expected to perform the option periods of the latrine contract, for example\nbecause the price of the base period alone would not cover the capital expenditures\nnecessary to perform the latrine contract.126 Saud Al Tawash’s testimony is, in part,\ncorroborated by an Army memorandum of August 20, 2004, signed by Maj. Davis,\nwhich states that the Army anticipated needing the option periods of the dumpster\ncontract and that there was a likelihood that the options would be exercised. The\ndetermination of the memorandum concluded: “Based on the above information, in\naccordance with FAR 17.202, I hereby determine that the Dumpster Service Contract\ndoes require the use of options.”127 Moreover, following the terminations of the latrine\nand dumpster contracts, the necessary services were carried on by other contractors,\nincluding Green Valley and Jasmine, respectively, indicating that defendant was still in\nneed of, and had the ability to pay for, the latrine and dumpster services. Additionally,\nboth Attorney Peters and Mr. Carlson, plaintiff’s expert, stated that they believed the\noption periods were recoverable.\n\n        Defendant’s arguments implicating the Special Plea in Fraud violations regarding\nthe latrine and dumpster claims are substantially the same as the arguments it made on\nthe same issue with regard to the camp package BPA claim. With respect to all three\nclaims, the camp package BPA, the latrine contract, and the dumpster contract, the\ncourt finds that defendant has failed to prove with clear and convincing evidence that\nplaintiff presented a false claim with the intent to defraud the government, or that the\ndumpster or latrine contracts, as a whole, were tainted by bribery or a conflict of\ninterest. Moreover, the fact is that Mr. Cockerham terminated both the latrine and\n126\n    Plaintiff’s lost profits calculation indicates that plaintiff’s costs would have exceeded\nits profits for the base period of the dumpster contract, rather than the latrine contract.\n127\n   FAR 17.202 indicates when a contracting officer “may include options” in a contract,\nbut does not indicate that the government must exercise an option. See 48 C.F.R.\n§ 17.202 (2005).\n\n                                            121\n\fdumpster contracts shortly after they were awarded to plaintiff. If the award of contracts\nwas the result of bribery, conflict of interest, and fraud involving Mr. Cockerham, it gives\nthe court pause that Mr. Cockerham also was the official who terminated the same\ncontracts. Because defendant has failed to prove an intent to defraud the government\nwith respect to its latrine and dumpster claims, forfeiture of plaintiff’s claims is\ninappropriate.\n\nC.     The Bottled Water BPA Demurrage Claim Under the Special Plea in Fraud\n       Statute\n\n        With respect to the bottled water BPA, defendant asserts that plaintiff’s claims\nshould be forfeited under the Special Plea in Fraud statute as a result of plaintiff’s\nbribery of Mr. Cockerham in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 201(b)(1), which also created a\nconflict of interest, and because plaintiff submitted the 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer\nfor amounts to which it knew it was not entitled. Defendant also alleges that calls\nissued under plaintiff’s bottled water BPA must be rescinded due to bribery, conflict of\ninterest, and fraud. In its post-trial brief, defendant claims that plaintiff’s 2005 bottled\nwater BPA demurrage claim indicates it was seeking excess payment for charges made\nby Expeditors, Gulf Group’s trucking company, because the claim provided that Gulf\nGroup was “submitting this claim with the following documents for reimbursement of our\ndemurrage payments.” (emphasis added). Yet, defendant contends that Expeditors did\nnot charge the 85.000 KD/day as requested in the claim; rather, Expeditors charged\n50.000 to 60.000 KD/day. Defendant asserts that by claiming more than Expeditors\ncharged, plaintiff intended to deceive the government. Additionally, defendant argues\nthat plaintiff fraudulently assigned all of the delays encountered to the government.\n\n       Defendant provided the same rationale regarding the bottled water BPA as it did\nfor the camp package BPA regarding its request for rescission and disgorgement. By\nway of example, defendant claims that Ms. Blake was paid, but never worked, that the\npayments were made to her in exchange for the award of contracts to plaintiff by Mr.\nCockerham, and that Saud Al Tawash asked Ms. Blake about her conversation with\nfederal investigators. Defendant also relies on Mr. Cockerham’s note in the record,\nalbeit apparently undelivered, referring to “Saud” and instructing Ms. Blake to get rid of\neverything. Defendant believes that the note contained falsehoods (i.e., that Ms. Blake\ngot her job on her own and Ms. Blake did paperwork for Saud Al Tawash). Defendant\nclaims the following with respect to the note:\n\n       the instructions contain falsehoods that demonstrate that Mr. Cockerham\n       and Saud Al Tawash were engaged in bribery. The instructions state that\n       Ms. Blake ‘got the job on her own’ even though she obtained her situation\n       with Saud Al Tawash only after Mr. Cockerham introduced her to Mr. Al\n       Tawash as his sister and mentioned to him that she was looking for work\n       in Kuwait. The instructions also state that Ms. Blake did “admin\n       paperwork” for Saud Al Tawash, even though Ms. Blake never worked for\n       anyone in Kuwait.\n\n\n\n                                            122\n\f(internal citations omitted). Finally, defendant notes that neither Mr. Cockerham nor\nSaud Al Tawash told the Army about Ms. Blake’s job with Gulf Telecom, but defendant\nhas not identified a statute or regulation requiring Mr. Cockerham to do so. Defendant\nasserts that the calls issued under plaintiff’s bottled water BPA must be rescinded due\nto bribery, conflict of interest, and fraud. Defendant also claims that plaintiff must\ndisgorge the amounts the government paid to plaintiff under the bottled water BPA\nclaims.\n\n       Plaintiff argues that Mr. Cockerham and Saud Al Tawash testified that Mr.\nCockerham did not help Saud Al Tawash obtain the bottled water BPA and that Saud Al\nTawash did not offer him anything in exchange for or to prompt the award of the bottled\nwater BPA. According to plaintiff, Gulf Telecom had a legitimate need for Ms. Blake’s\nservices and had been seeking an American employee before discovering that Ms.\nBlake was inquiring about work in Kuwait. Plaintiff argues that Ms. Blake sought a job in\nKuwait independent of her brother’s influence, that she was unable to work in the end\ndue to issues beyond her control, that Gulf Telecom was required to pay her regardless\nof her failure to provide actual services pursuant to Kuwaiti law, and that her salary and\nbenefits were commensurate with other local companies. Plaintiff also notes that the\namount of Gulf Group’s bottled water BPA claim has remained consistent since the\n2005 claim. Plaintiff points to a chart in the record evidencing the expenses included in\nthe bottled water claim. Furthermore, Saud Al Tawash testified that the 85.000 KD/day\namount included expenses in addition to those charged by Expeditors.\n\n       The court does not find clear and convincing evidence of fraudulent claims or\nbribery under the bottled water BPA and, therefore, defendant has failed to prove its\nSpecial Plea in Fraud counterclaim or that the calls issued under the bottled water BPA\nshould be rescinded. The government has not proven that plaintiff knowingly submitted\nthe bottled water BPA claim with the intent to defraud the government or that plaintiff’s\nbottled water BPA was tainted by bribery. Unlike the camp package BPA, latrine, and\ndumpster claims, defendant did not prove a violation of the False Claims Act with\nrespect to the bottled water BPA claim, which has a lower threshold of proof and intent\nthan the Special Plea in Fraud statute. The amount plaintiff seeks in connection with\nthe bottled water BPA claim has remained consistent from when the claim was first\nsubmitted. Gulf Group initially attempted to document the expenses incurred, although,\nin addition to the information plaintiff included with its bottled water BPA claim, plaintiff\nalso should have included information which demonstrated expenses charged other\nthan by Expeditors. The failure to include such information, which was produced later,\ndoes not evidence fraud. At most, the failure to attach the documentation for expenses\nother than for Expeditors demonstrates negligence and ineptitude, which do not\nimplicate forfeiture under the Special Plea in Fraud statute. See Miller v. United States,\n213 Ct. Cl. at 69, 550 F.2d at 22; Daewoo Eng’g & Constr. Co. v. United States, 73 Fed.\nCl. at 584. Despite defendant’s argument that plaintiff’s claim implies that it is seeking\nonly reimbursement for charges made by Expeditors, nowhere in the claim does plaintiff\nactually make such a statement. Rather, the bottled water BPA demurrage claim states\nthat it is for “demurrage charges for delays,” and that Gulf Group “incurred delay\n(demurrage) and damages.” The language of the 2005 bottled water BPA demurrage\n\n\n                                            123\n\fclaim can be read to encompass all damages arising from delays, including charges\nasserted by entities other than Expeditors. The bottled water BPA claim states, “in\nfurtherance of the contract we shipped the bottled water to Iraq. But we have incurred\ndelay (demurrage) and damages for delivering bottled water to Iraq. Even though we\nhave had [sic] taken all the necessary requirements to perform its obligations both\nanticipated and ultimate as per the scope of work and were doing the services.” The\nbottled water BPA claim continues: “Gulf Group followed Arcent requirements for\nshipment which resulted in delays (by the US military) that resulted in extra costs to Gulf\nEnterprises, and such delays resulted in the demurrage charges as provided in a\nsummary table and detailed line item listing at Appendix 3.” Although the only expense\ndocuments originally included in the claim were from Expeditors and Gulf Group, the\ncourt does not conclude from its statement that the claim was for “demurrage damages\nfor delay” that plaintiff only sought reimbursement for charges made by Expeditors.\n\n       Also, as discussed above, defendant has not demonstrated a conflict of interest\ninvolving Mr. Cockerham, with regard to Gulf Group or any member of the Al Tawash\nfamily or that the relationship between Saud Al Tawash and Ms. Blake was such that\nthe court must assume that there was an impropriety which took place related to the\ncontract at issue. Defendant also has not proven that the hiring of, and payments to,\nMs. Blake were linked to contract awards to plaintiff or favorable contracting actions by\nMr. Cockerham. Based on the record before the court, the defendant has not met its\nburden to prove a violation of the Special Plea in Fraud provisions regarding the bottled\nwater BPA by clear and convincing evidence, by showing that plaintiff knowingly\npresented a false claim with the intent to defraud the government, or that the bottled\nwater BPA was tainted by bribery. Defendant also has not demonstrated the existence\nof a conflict of interest or proven its counterclaim for common law fraud, including\nrescission and disgorgement.\n\n       In sum, the defendant has failed to prove that forfeiture is warranted under the\nSpecial Plea in Fraud statute or that the commission of common law fraud related to\nany of the four above-captioned cases warrants rescission and disgorgement. A finding\nof False Claims Act liability without a finding of Special Plea in Fraud is not logically\ninconsistent.128 As a Judge of the Court of Federal Claims has noted, “the\n128\n   The court in Liquidating Trustee Ester DuVal of KI Liquidation, Inc. v. United States,\nnoted that:\n\n       The evidence that would negate the level of intent under the FCA, as\n      opposed to the forfeiture statute, involves different findings of fact. The\n      application of these facts should not be conflated, as the legal\n      requirements of the statutes differ significantly: first, § 2514 requires an\n      elevated burden of proof, i.e., clear and convincing evidence, Daewoo\n      Eng’g, 557 F.3d at 1341, not a preponderance of the evidence standard\n      as required by the FCA, see id. at 1340; second, § 2514 requires proof of\n      the intent to deceive, whereas the FCA requires knowledge, a general-\n      intent standard, and explicitly stipulates that proof of specific intent is not\n      required.\n\n                                           124\n\fconsequences of each—forfeiture of plaintiff’s entire claim versus comparatively\nminimal penalties under the FCA—exemplify the perceived gravitas of the fraud under\neach statute.” Liquidating Trustee Ester DuVal of KI Liquidation, Inc. v. United States,\n89 Fed. Cl. at 41-42. Although plaintiff was found to have violated the False Claims Act\nfor the camp package BPA claims, latrine claims, and dumpster claims, defendant has\nfailed to demonstrate liability under the Contract Disputes Act or that forfeiture is\nwarranted under the Special Plea in Fraud statute in all four cases, and has failed to\nprove the common law fraud counterclaim for rescission and disgorgement for the camp\npackage and bottled water BPAs. The court, therefore, turns to plaintiff’s claims.\n\nIII.   Contract Terminations and Abuse of Discretion\n\n       Plaintiff’s camp package BPA call, latrine contract, and dumpster contract each\nwere terminated by the government for convenience in October 2004.129 Plaintiff claims\nthat the government decisions to terminate its camp package BPA call and latrine and\ndumpster contracts were abuses of discretion.130 Plaintiff asserts that the terminations\nfor convenience by the government were not properly based on convenience131\n\n\nLiquidating Trustee Ester DuVal of KI Liquidation, Inc. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed. Cl.</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n41-42 (2009)\n129\n   None of the calls issued under Gulf Group’s bottled water BPA were cancelled in\nOctober 2004. Gulf Group continued to supply bottled water to the Army in 2005.\n130\n   As noted above, plaintiff had alleged bad faith on the part of the government in the\nterminations of the camp package BPA call and the dumpster and latrine contracts.\nPlaintiff subsequently dropped all allegations concerning bad faith in each case, and\nconfirmed at closing arguments, “there is no bad faith claim in any one of these four\ncases, 06-835, 06-858, 06-853, and 07-082.”\n131\n   The standard termination for convenience clause, 38 C.F.R. § 52.212-4 (2003), was\nincorporated by reference into plaintiff’s contracts. The clause states:\n\n       Termination for the Government’s convenience.              The Government\n       reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole\n       convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall\n       immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and\n       all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms\n       of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid a percentage of the contract\n       price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of\n       termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to\n       the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping\n       system, have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be\n       required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost\n       principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government\n       any right to audit the Contractor’s records. The Contractor shall not be\n\n                                            125\n\fbecause the government continued to require the camp package, latrine, and dumpster\nservices, and contracted with other contractors to provide the same services after\nterminating plaintiff. According to plaintiff, the terminations could not have been\nproperly based on default because plaintiff had not committed any error justifying\ndefault terminations under the camp package BPA or the latrine and dumpster\ncontracts.\n\n       Defendant argues that the camp package BPA call for Camp Buehring was\nterminated for convenience in order to award a call for a larger camp, Camp Virginia, to\nGulf Group because the Army had determined that Gulf Group was better suited to the\nlarger camp. Although plaintiff’s 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer references the\nplanned award of a call for Camp Virginia and there is evidence in the record that\ninformal discussions about offering a call for Camp Virginia to plaintiff had occurred, the\nCamp Virginia call never was awarded to plaintiff. As for the latrine and dumpster\ncontracts, defendant argues the contracts were terminated for convenience in response\nto security concerns arising from the alleged security incident involving Mohammed Al\nTawash when he sought to map the dumpster locations in order to initiate contract\nperformance. Defendant concedes that the security concerns later were determined to\nbe unfounded, but maintains that the concerns were legitimate at the time of the\nterminations.\n\n       The camp package BPA call for Camp Buehring was awarded on September 30,\n2004 by Maj. Davis, but was terminated twelve days later on October 12, 2004, when\nMaj. Davis issued Modification 103 on behalf of the Army. The Modification stated: “The\npurpose of this modification is to cancel the BPA Call with Gulf Group. Gulf Group has\nno issues with this cancellation and will accept it at no cost to the government.”\nDespite terminating the camp package BPA call, the government had sufficient funds to\npay for, continued to be in need of, and contracted for the camp package services. The\ncontracting officer’s May 21, 2007 final decision on the camp package BPA claim,\nsigned by Joseph Libbey,132 stated:\n\n      paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could\n      have been avoided.\n\n38 C.F.R. § 52.212-4.\n132\n   Mr. Libbey was not an ideal witness for the government. He often was defensive\nand struggled to explain his final decisions, which were confusing and unsupported. At\none point during trial, he stated:\n\n      I am not buying that there is a conspiracy to wrongfully have terminated\n      Gulf Group. Makes no sense to me. You’ve certainly pointed out some\n      factual errors in the letter, you’re a full time professional attorney, you\n      know, you’ve done that, you certainly have made me look a fool on some\n      things today. But nonetheless, no, under the context these letters were\n      written under, you know, I stand by them. There are some factual errors\n      that the Judge will have to take in. This idea about a conspiracy in terms\n\n                                           126\n\f      Gulf Group erroneously treats the BPA W912D1-04-A-0047 as a contract.\n      They demand the maximum ordering limit for a BPA call as termination\n      costs. They also fail to reduce the maximum call order amount demanded\n      by any of the orders placed against the BPA and for which they received\n      payment. Gulf Group alleges the contract/BPA was terminated, yet only\n      one call was in fact terminated, not the entire BPA as alleged.\n\n        The latrine contract was awarded on September 28, 2004 by Maj. Davis, but was\nterminated pursuant to 48 C.F.R. § 52.212-4 twenty days later on October 18, 2004,\nwhen Mr. Cockerham issued Modification P00002 on behalf of the Army. Modification\nP00002 stated: “This contract is being canceled due to command directive of the ASG\ncommander SWA COL Brick Miller 3rd Army Arcent Kuwait. The contract is canceled\nunder the terms of 52.212-1, 52-212-4 [sic], 52.249-4.” The parties stipulated that: “The\nGovernment did not terminate Gulf Group for default under Contract W912D1-04-P-\n0932,” and, “[a]t the time Contract W912D1-04-P-0932 was terminated, the Government\nhad not issued any Cure Notices to Gulf Group regarding Gulf Group’s performance of\nits contractual obligations under that contract, and none was ever issued at any time\nthereafter.” Despite terminating Gulf Group’s latrine contract, the government had\nsufficient funds to pay for, continued to be in need of, and continued to contract for the\nlatrine services.\n\n      Sixteen days after the October 18, 2004 termination of the latrine contract, Col.\nHess, the head of contracting at Camp Arifjan, sent a letter to Mohammed Al Tawash.\nThe November 3, 2004 letter stated:\n\n      Recently, a contracting officer in my office terminated a service contract\n      [the latrine contract] held by Gulf Group General Enterprises, a company\n      operated by the Al-Tawash family. There has been some concern\n      expressed that the incident unfairly tarnished the good name of the Al-\n      Tawash family, which is a highly respected, prominent Kuwaiti family.\n\n      Please rest assured that the Gulf Group’s contract to service portable\n      latrines at Army camps in Kuwait was not terminated because of security\n      reasons. While it is true that some employees of the Gulf Group have\n      been either barred from the installation or warned because they had not\n      followed the rules for contract employees on the installation, these\n      incidents did not cause the termination of the contract.\n\n      The contracting officer terminated the contract because circumstances\n      arose that caused the contracting officer to conclude that it was in the best\n      interest of the Army to terminate the contract. Since the contract was\n      terminated for convenience of the government, the Gulf Group should not\n\n\n      of the wrongful termination and all that, I’m going to have leave that in the\n      Judge’s hands. All I can offer is I don’t believe it.\n\n                                           127\n\f       suffer any repercussions to its reputation or competitive standing. The\n       Gulf Group is fully eligible to compete for other Army contracts in Kuwait.\n       I hope this clarifies this unfortunate misunderstanding.\n\n       On May 21, 2007, Joseph Libbey issued his contracting officer’s final decision on\nthe latrine contract claim, which stated that “the performance failures and security\nfactors prompting the termination to show the decision that termination was in the best\ninterests of the Government was a valid decision and not an abuse of discretion and not\ndone in bad faith.” The same decision noted, however, “[o]n 3 November 2004, LTC\nHess sent a letter to Mohammed Abdulaziz Al Tawash responding to the apparent Gulf\nGroup inquiry as to whether or not the security violations had prompted the termination\n[of the latrine contract]. LTC Hess stated the latrine contract services were not\nterminated because of security concerns.” At trial, Col. Hess testified that he directly\nordered Mr. Cockerham to terminate Gulf Group’s latrine and dumpster contracts, and\nordered Maj. Davis to terminate Gulf Group’s camp package BPA call, likely at the\nbehest of Col. Miller, because “[w]e were ordered to get Gulf Group off the bases, the\ncamps.” At trial, Col. Miller testified that the terminations were not related to the alleged\nsecurity incident. Col. Miller also testified that, due to a separation in command, he\ncould not give Col. Hess orders relating to contracting and that, due to the nature of his\nposition, had he ordered a contracting officer to terminate a contract, he would have\nbeen issuing an “illegal command.”\n\n       The dumpster contract, which was awarded on September 20, 2004 by Maj.\nDavis, was terminated thirty-two days later on October 22, 2004, when Mr. Cockerham\nexecuted Modification P00005 on behalf of the Army, terminating the dumpster contract\nfor the convenience of the government. Despite what Col. Miller testified, Modification\n0005 stated: “Contract is cancelled by order of the ASG Commander Kuwait COL Brick\nMiller. Contract was canceled in accordance with FAR Part 52.212-4 Termination for\nConvenience of the Government.”\n\n       The parties stipulated that: “The Government did not terminate Gulf Group for\ndefault under Contract W912D1-04-P-0897,” the dumpster contract, and “[a]t the time\nContract W912D1-04-P-0897 was terminated, the Government had not issued any Cure\nNotices to Gulf Group regarding Gulf Group’s performance of its contractual obligations\nunder that contract, and none was ever issued at any time thereafter.” Despite the\ntermination of Gulf Group’s dumpster contract, the government had sufficient funds to\npay for, continued to be in need of, and contracted for the dumpster services. In fact,\nafter terminating plaintiff’s latrine contract and dumpster contract, the government\ncontinued to place orders for dumpsters from Gulf Group for other locations.\n\n      Joseph Libbey’s May 21, 2007 contracting officer’s decision on the dumpster\ncontract claim stated:\n\n       On 7 October 2004, four Gulf Group employees were being escorted\n       when one began asking suspicious questions about base personnel\n       housing and base security arrangements. The four were detained and\n\n\n                                            128\n\f         released to the Kuwait Ministry of Interior. On 21 October 2004, the\n         individual asking about base security was barred from Camp Arifjan by\n         Col. Brick T. Miller, ASG Commander.133 The remaining individuals were\n         issued letters of warning regarding compliance with base security.\n\n         Mr. Libbey’s contracting officer’s decision on the dumpster claim continued:\n\n         On 18 October 2004, another Gulf Group employee was barred from\n         Camp Arifjan by Colonel Miller for traveling on base without his required\n         escort. Colonel Miller wrote to Mr. [Saud] Al Tawash of Gulf Group on 21\n         October 2004 expressing deep concern over Gulf Group and its\n         employees not following and enforcing security regulations. Colonel Miller\n         warned Mr. [Saud Al] Tawash that further violations might result in Mr.\n         Tawash and Gulf Group being barred from all ASG Kuwait installations.\n\nMr. Libbey’s contracting officer’s decision on the dumpster contract claim further stated:\n“On 9 October 2004, six Gulf Group employees were detained for security violations\ninvolving traveling on Camp Arifjan without their required escort, and rummaging\nthrough a dumpster. At least four of these individuals were barred from Camp Arifjan by\nColonel Miller on 16 and 18 October 2004.”134\n\n         The contracting officer’s decision on the dumpster contract claim also stated:\n\n         The Government originally contemplated terminating Gulf Group’s contract\n         for failure to comply with security regulations; however, due to the global\n         war on terror operational tempo in this area, and a desire to maintain a\n         friendly working relationship with local contractors that often include\n         prominent Kuwaiti families, the Government decided to terminate the\n         contract for the convenience of the Government. The Government is not\n         attempting to change the basis for contract termination; but simply notes\n         that because of repeated security violations it was in the best interest of\n         the Government and not an abuse of discretion or bad faith to terminate\n         the [dumpster] contract for convenience.\n\n     An unsigned letter, purportedly written by Col. Miller on October 29, 2004 to\nMohammed Al Tawash, appears to contradict Mr. Libbey’s retrospective explanation:\n\n         Dear Mr. Al-Tawash:\n\n         Recently I directed that a contract between the United States Army and\n         Gulf Group General Enterprises be terminated for the convenience of the\n         United States Government. Based upon the terms of the contract and\n133\n      This statement in not accurate, as the individuals were not barred from Camp Arifjan.\n134\n   As noted above, Mr. Libbey, the contracting officer, incorrectly identified Gulf\nCompany employees as Gulf Group employees.\n\n                                             129\n\f       lack of sufficient equipment and personnel for Gulf Group to perform the\n       services, I directed the termination of the contract. My concern for the\n       health of my Soldiers caused me to conclude that it was in the best\n       interest of the Army to terminate the contract. Because I terminated the\n       contract for the convenience of the Army, there are no repercussions upon\n       the Gulf Group for failing to perform under the contract. Gulf Group is not\n       barred from competing for other Army contracts and is fully eligible to\n       compete for other Army contracts in Kuwait. I apologize for any\n       misunderstanding and the Army looks forward to Gulf Group competing for\n       future contracts.\n\n       Respectfully,\n\n       Brick T. Miller\n       Colonel, U.S. Army\n       Commanding\n\nIt is unclear, however, as to which contract Col. Miller’s letter refers. The reference to\nlack of sufficient equipment and concern for the health of his soldiers could refer to any\nof the contracts. Moreover, the letter in the record is unsigned. Upon being shown the\nletter quoted immediately above at trial, Col. Hess, the head of contracting at Camp\nArifjan, stated, “I don’t recall seeing this letter before.”\n\n       As noted by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, agency\npersonnel are presumed to act in good faith, and a claimant must present significant\nproof of bad faith to overcome that presumption.

The contracting officer should exercise the Government’s right to\n      terminate a contract for commercial items either for convenience or for\n      cause only when such a termination would be in the best interests of the\n      Government. The contracting officer should consult with counsel prior to\n      terminating for cause.\n\n48 C.F.R. § 12.403(b) (2005). The FAR requires only that a termination for\nconvenience be in the best interests of the government. See 48 C.F.R. § 49.101\n(2005). Plaintiff argues that the terminations of the camp package BPA call, latrine\ncontract, and dumpster contract were not in the Army’s best interests, given its\ncontinuing needs for each of those services. Plaintiff also argues that the terminations\nwere made in violation of 48 C.F.R. § 12.403(b). The termination for convenience\nclause “‘gives the Government the broad right to terminate without cause and limits the\ncontractor’s recovery to costs incurred, profit on work done, and costs of preparing the\ntermination settlement proposal.’” Enron Fed. Solutions, Inc. v. United States, 80 Fed.\nCl. 382, 406 n.21 (2008) (quoting John Cibinic, Jr. and Ralph C. Nash, Jr.,\nAdministration of Government Contracts 1073 (3d ed. 1995)).\n\n       A contracting officer, however, may not terminate a contract “simply to acquire a\nbetter bargain from another source.” Krygoski Constr. Co. v. United States, 94 F.3d at\n1541 (citing Torncello v. United States, 231 Ct. Cl. at 48, 681 F.2d at 772). Similarly,\nthe government is not permitted to enter into a contract without any intention of\nupholding it. See Caldwell & Santmyer, Inc. v. Glickman, 55 F.3d at 1582.

Regarding the latrine\n\n                                           132\n\fand dumpster contracts, the phrase, “Termination for Convenience of the Government”\nwas used, the termination for convenience clause was specifically invoked, and a\ncommand directive was invoked. Additionally, Col. Hess’ November 3, 2004 letter to\nMohammed Al Tawash affirmatively stated the latrine contract was “terminated for\nconvenience of the government.” The government also tried to hide behind security\nconcerns to justify not awarding the Camp Virginia call to plaintiff after terminating the\nCamp Buehring call and for terminating the latrine contract and dumpster contract. The\nalleged security incident involving Mohammed Al Tawash occurred on October 7, 2004\nin close proximity to the contract terminations, which all occurred in close proximity to\none another. As noted above, the camp package BPA call was terminated on October\n12, 2004, the latrine contract was terminated on October 18, 2004, and the dumpster\ncontract was terminated on October 22, 2004. At the time of the terminations, however,\nthe October 7, 2004 alleged security incident had not been verified as a security threat.\nThere are also numerous inconsistencies as to reasons for the terminations of the Gulf\nGroup contracts offered by Army personnel at the time and more recently.\n\n        The alleged security incident occurred on Mohammed Al Tawash’s first and only\nday working for Gulf Group. He appears to have been in college at the time and was\neager to make a good impression in his family’s business. He testified that he asked for\na map “[b]ecause we never really had a plan or say a service route or Gulf Group to\nidentify where their latrines were.... To make our job a lot more easier; a lot more\nefficient and to be more effective with how Gulf Group performs with this company.”\nHaving had an opportunity to observe Mohammed Al Tawash at trial, the court found\nhim to be a sincere and credible witness. Although the court understands how\nMohammed Al Tawash’s questions could have sparked suspicion at the time, on a\nmilitary base in a war zone, the court finds the questions to have been innocent and\nwell-motivated, geared to benefiting contract performance. Apparently, the Army also\nfound the questions to have been innocent because the government opened no\ninvestigation or case file, allowed Gulf Group and its employees continued access to the\nbase, and even wrote a letter of explanation on November 3, 2004, within a month of\nthe incident and within days of the terminations of the latrine and dumpster contracts.\nThe explanation letter, quoted above, from Col. Hess addressed to Mohammed Al\nTawash, made clear that the contract was not terminated for security reasons, although\nit incorrectly indicated that certain Gulf Group employees had been barred from Camp\nArifjan, while, at the same time, indicating that Gulf Group should not suffer any\nrepercussions as a result of the incident.\n\n        The government had a duty to substantiate its security concerns before using\nthem as a basis for termination for any of Gulf Group’s contracts. Terminating any of\nGulf Group BPAs or contracts based on security reasons, without finding a need to even\nopen a case or begin a formal investigation, in a situation in which the questions asked\nby Mohammed Al Tawash could have been, and turned out to be, appropriate and\ngermane to improving contract performance, is not reasonable or best practices, and is\narbitrary and capricious.

Hess was able to state, within days of the latrine contract termination, that the\nsecurity concerns were not an issue also indicates that an investigation into the incident\nwould have been relatively simple to conduct.\n\n        According to Mr. Wilson, Gulf Group’s Project Manager in Kuwait, Col. Hess\nstated to him that “counterintelligence on the Al Tawash family,” indicated they have ties\nto “Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein,” a charge which is not substantiated anywhere in\nthe record and seems to have appeared from nowhere at the time of the alleged\nsecurity incident, just at the time of the terminations, and was quickly dismissed and\ndisavowed. The record contains no evidence whatsoever linking Gulf Group, Saud Al\nTawash, or any other member of the Al Tawash family to terrorists or to any anti-\nAmerican group. Plaintiff also offered the testimony of Col. Al Salal, who at the time of\nthe trial was a retired Kuwaiti Colonel and, after his retirement from the military was a\nDefense Attaché at the Kuwait Embassy in Saudi Arabia. Col. Al Salal testified that Gulf\nGroup, Gulf Telecom, and Saud Al Tawash were all cleared by Kuwaiti security, that the\nAl Tawash family is well-known in Kuwait, and that he had never heard of any ties\nbetween the Al Tawash family and the Taliban, Saddam Hussein, or other anti-\nAmerican groups. Moreover, none of the members of the Al Tawash family who\ntestified at trial demonstrated any traces of anti-American sentiment. To the contrary,\neach member of the Al Tawash family who testified at the trial, and especially Saud Al\nTawash, seemed to be eager to properly perform well on the contracts at issue in the\nabove-captioned cases, and perform properly on other contracts Gulf Group held at the\ntime. Moreover, Gulf Group continued to perform for the United States government in\nsupport of the United States mission in the region, even following the terminations of the\ncamp package BPA call and the latrine and dumpster contracts.\n\nA.     The Camp Package BPA Call Termination\n\n        As noted above, the camp package BPA call 0001 was terminated on October\n12, 2004 when Maj. Davis issued Modification 103 on behalf of the Army, which stated:\n“The purpose of this modification is to cancel the BPA Call with Gulf Group. Gulf Group\nhas no issues with this cancellation and will accept it at no cost to the government.”\nPlaintiff insists that Maj. Davis did not exercise her own discretion in terminating the\ncamp call 0001, but was acting at the direction of Col. Hess.135 The termination clauses\nin the camp package BPA state:\n\n       (l) Termination for the Government’s convenience. The Government\n       reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole\n       convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall\n135\n    Col. Hess indicated during his testimony at trial that he may have ordered Maj. Davis\nto terminate the camp package BPA call, but also indicated that he may have issued an\norder to terminate the camp package BPA call at Col. Miller’s direction. Col. Hess\ngenerally appeared eager at trial to shift the focus of the testimony from his role in any\nof the contracts at issue, despite his role as head of contracting activity at Camp Arifjan.\n\n                                            134\n\f       immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and\n       all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms\n       of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid a percentage of the contract\n       price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of\n       termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to\n       the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping\n       system, have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be\n       required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost\n       principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government\n       any right to audit the Contractor’s records. The Contractor shall not be\n       paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could\n       have been avoided.\n\n       (m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract,\n       or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor,\n       or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions,\n       or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate\n       assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause,\n       the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for\n       supplies or services not accepted, and the Contract shall be liable to the\n       Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is\n       determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for\n       default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.\n\nAs indicated in plaintiff’s third amended complaint, regarding the claim associated with\nthe termination of the camp package BPA call:\n\n       This claim was initially submitted for a final decision as required under 41\n       U.S.C. §§ [sic] 605 to the then acting contracting officer Major John\n       Cockerham on October 10, 2005, and again on December 16, 2005 in the\n       form of a termination settlement proposal and claim. Gulf Group never\n       received from the Army a response to the claim or a decision to the initial\n       claim. The claim then was re-submitted to other Contracting Officers on\n       October 22, 2006 and again by court order on March 26, 2007, with the\n       most recent submission on April 12, 2011 as ordered by this honorable\n       court136 clarifying Gulf Group’s claim and to expressly state that the\n       termination of BPA Call No. 0001 was arbitration [sic] and capricious.\n\n       Plaintiff’s third amended complaint for the camp package BPA case also alleges:\n\n       The Government’s termination of the contract was not properly based on\n       convenience inasmuch as the Government needed the services, had the\n       requisite funding to fully pay for them at the contract price and indeed\n       contracted with another contractor to provide the same services at the\n136\n    As discussed above, the court did not direct plaintiff to submit a new, certified claim\nto defendant, but rather indicated that plaintiff could, if appropriate, revise its complaint.\n\n                                            135\n\f      same level of demand and for the same period of performance. Moreover,\n      the termination was of no benefit to the Army.\n\nPlaintiff also alleges in the third amended complaint in Case No. 06-835, the camp\npackage BPA case:\n\n      The Government’s termination of this contract was wrongful and a breach\n      of contract emanating from arbitrary and capricious conduct as well as an\n      abuse of discretion inasmuch as the Government broke its promise to\n      award [the contract for Camp] Virginia and the purported basis for\n      termination was a supposed security risk presented by Gulf Group that did\n      not in fact exist and was not documented prior to, at the time of or any\n      time subsequent to termination.\n\n       Plaintiff argues that, to the extent defendant based the termination of its camp\npackage BPA call on security reasons, the termination was an abuse of discretion\nbecause the Army rapidly was able to determine that Gulf Group was not a security risk.\nSimilarly, plaintiff argues that defendant’s assertion that the camp package BPA call for\nCamp Buehring was cancelled in order to award Gulf Group a call for Camp Virginia\ndoes not make the termination reasonable. Although plaintiff’s 2005 camp package\nBPA Claim and Settlement Offer refers to the award of Camp Virginia and there is some\nindication in the record that discussions were held about awarding the larger Camp\nVirginia camp package BPA call to plaintiff, the award did not occur. Plaintiff now terms\nthe discussions a “bait and switch.” The government, in terminating the camp package\nBPA call, wrote, “Gulf Group has no issues with this cancellation and will accept it at no\ncost to the government.” According to Gulf Group, however, no one on behalf of Gulf\nGroup agreed to the termination. Although the record is not clear as to whether an\nagreement to exchange Camp Buehring for Camp Virginia was reached, none was ever\nsigned. Saud Al Tawash’s testimony at trial indicated that there were discussions, that\nhe requested that any proposed exchange of camps to Gulf Group be put in writing, but\nnone ever was, and that Gulf Group’s alleged oral agreement to a termination may have\nbeen contingent in his mind upon an award of Camp Virginia.\n\n        Defendant argues that because of the proposed future camp package BPA call\nfor Camp Virginia, plaintiff “does not claim” that the termination of the camp package\nBPA for Camp Buehring was unreasonable. Defendant interprets plaintiff’s argument to\nbe that the government breached the camp package BPA call “by deciding, after having\nterminated the camp package BPA [call], not to issue to Gulf Group a call for Camp\nVirginia.” Defendant asserts that plaintiff’s argument fails because once the camp\npackage BPA call for Camp Buehring was terminated, there was no contract remaining\nto be breached even when the Army decided not to award the Camp Virginia call to\nplaintiff. Defendant states, “[b]ecause the decision not to award a Camp Virginia call did\nnot breach Call 0001, the Court should reject any claim that the termination of Call 0001\nbreached that contract,” and there was no formal contractual agreement to award a call\nfor Camp Virginia.\n\n\n\n                                           136\n\f       At trial, the testimony from numerous witnesses was inconsistent as to the\nreason why the camp package BPA call for Camp Buehring was terminated. Saud Al\nTawash and Mr. Cockerham both testified that they had been informed by the Army that\nGulf Group’s camp package BPA call for Camp Buehring was going to be terminated in\norder to award Gulf Group a larger camp, Camp Virginia. According to Saud Al\nTawash, “Major Gloria [Davis] has called us and told us that Camp Buehring was going\nto be -- they were going to give us a larger camp, which was Camp Virginia, in lieu of\nCamp Buehring.... They will cancel Buehring, in order to give us Camp Virginia, which\nis a larger camp.” When asked, “[a]nd do you remember when she called?” Saud Al\nTawash answered: “Somewhere around that time frame, the second week of October.”\nMr. Cockerham testified that he knew of the cancellation “because of the office talk, and\nmy desk was like three spaces over from CPT Trimble. Just the talk between he and\nMAJ Davis was that it was going to be cancelled because they were planning on giving\na larger camp to them [Gulf Group].” Mr. Cockerham also offered a rough time frame\nfor the cancellation discussions, stating that the decision to give Camp Virginia to Gulf\nGroup had been made before he became interim Chief of Contracting, which he had\npreviously stated occurred in late October 2004. Mr. Cockerham’s testimony also\nindicated that the Army may have decided to place a hold on the award to plaintiff of the\nCamp Virginia call as a result of the alleged security incident.\n\n        The chronology of events is uncertain regarding the termination of camp package\nBPA call. The camp package BPA call for Camp Buehring was awarded on September\n30, 2004. The alleged security incident occurred on October 7, 2004. The camp\npackage BPA call for Camp Buehring was terminated on October 12, 2004. Oddly, the\nArmy’s second site visit to determine plaintiff’s readiness to perform the camp package\nBPA and to discuss moving up the start date was conducted by Capt. Trimble, Capt.\nNovak, and Lt. Rivera on October 13, 2004, the day after the camp package BPA call\nfor Camp Buehring was terminated. Saud Al Tawash testified that he learned in the\nsecond week of October that the camp package BPA call for Camp Buehring would be\nterminated in exchange for Camp Virginia. There is nothing in the record to clarify\nwhether Saud Al Tawash was informed of the Army’s decision to terminate the Camp\nBuehring call before or after the alleged security incident. Mr. Cockerham’s testimony\nat trial is equally unhelpful, suggesting only that the decision to terminate was made\nbefore the end of October. Despite terminating three of plaintiff’s contracts, defendant\ndid not move to bar plaintiff from future contracts in the war zone and, in fact, continued\nto work with plaintiff on other contracts plaintiff had been awarded, including the bottled\nwater BPA, also at issue in the above-captioned, consolidated cases.\n\n      Mr. Cockerham’s testimony also was not wholly consistent. An unsigned\nOctober 20, 2004 Memorandum for Record,137 similar to a separate memorandum\n137\n    As discussed above, there was no agreement as to who authored the unsigned\nOctober 20, 2004 Memorandum for Record. At trial, Capt. Novak remembered\npreparing a memorandum on this subject in a combined effort between himself, Capt.\nTrimble, and Lt. Rivera. Capt. Novak remembered a document similar to the\nmemorandum quoted above. He testified, however, he did not believe the\nmemorandum in the record is the exact memorandum that he prepared because of the\n\n                                           137\n\fwritten by Capt. Trimble, Capt. Novak, and Lt. Rivera, stated that Mr. Cockerham\ninformed them that the termination of the camp package BPA call was due to Gulf\nGroup’s inexperience. The Memorandum for Record begins: “This memorandum\nconsists of a list of events that describes the background behind the Contracting\nOfficer’s decision and the direct order that was given to cancel all of Gulf Group’s\nContracts.” The Memorandum for Record also states, “Major Cockerham informed the\nCO’s [Capt. Trimble, Capt. Novak, and Lt. Rivera] to cancel the BPA call to Gulf Group\ndue to their inexperience in building tents. Furthermore, Major Cockerham stated that it\nwas in the government’s best interest to place a call to British Link Kuwait, although\ntheir prices were unreasonably high.” At trial, however, Mr. Cockerham denied having\never made such statements. According to Mr. Cockerham, it was Tijani Saani who gave\nCapt. Trimble, Capt. Novak, and Lt. Rivera the information for the October 20, 2004\nMemorandum for Record. Mr. Cockerham testified he believed Tijani Saani had\nindicated that the information was from Mr. Cockerham, but Mr. Cockerham believed\nthat the information actually was from Col. Hess.\n\n        Additional witnesses at trial offered other reasons for the termination of the camp\npackage BPA call. For example, Mr. Wilson, Gulf Group’s Project Manager in Kuwait,\ntestified that Col. Hess told him the Camp Package BPA call and the latrine and\ndumpster contracts were terminated because of terrorist links. Capt. Trimble testified\nthat he knew nothing about the Camp Buehring call being cancelled for a Camp Virginia\ncall but that the camp mayors preferred to continue with their old contractors, while the\nunsigned Memorandum for Record asserted that it “was in the government’s best\ninterest to place a call to British Link Kuwait.” Mr. Libbey indicated in his contracting\nofficer’s final decisions that the contracts were terminated for dumpster diving.138 At\ntrial, Mr. Libbey stated:\n\n      Q: So the lawyers didn’t tell you about that, the reasons for terminating the\n      contract?\n\n      A: No, no, I believe it was due to the going into the dumpster. I do not\n      know anything about, what was it you implied?\n\n      Q: A security risk, a security concern that the family of the company\n      represented to the Army, to the government, to the United States.\n\nphrase in the memorandum, “blessed their capabilities,” which he said “just seems out\nof place to me.” Capt. Novak acknowledged, however, that this memorandum could\nhave been a draft of the final memorandum he prepared. Capt. Trimble did not\nremember writing this memorandum or a similar memorandum, or assisting anyone in\nwriting such a memorandum.\n138\n   At trial, the testimony of Mr. Libbey addressed the camp package BPA, the latrine\ncontract, and the dumpster contract collectively, as he spoke generally about the\n“contracts” and the “final decisions” for much of his testimony. As noted above, Mr.\nLibbey’s testimony at trial was defensive and not clear as to the reasons for the\nterminations or the basis for his final decisions.\n\n                                           138\n\f      A: Going through the dumpsters, that act in and of itself by the workers is\n      a security risk.\n\n        At trial Saud Al Tawash denied the government’s characterization and\nstatements regarding the termination of the camp package BPA call for Camp Buehring,\nand in particular that Gulf Group had no issue with the termination and would accept the\ntermination at no cost to the government. Saud Al Tawash stated: “No, I asked for the\npaperwork [regarding the Camp swap for Camp Virginia] to be sent over.” He also\ntestified that the Camp Virginia papers were never sent to him. The following exchange\nbetween plaintiff’s attorney and Saud Al Tawash indicates that Saud Al Tawash may\nhave spoken to Army personnel about swapping camps:\n\n      Q: And if you read the statement in that item, it says, “the purpose of this\n      notification is to cancel the BPA call with Gulf Group. Gulf Group has no\n      issue in the cancellation and will accept it at no cost to the government.”\n      Did you have any issues as to the cancellation of Camp Buehring at no\n      cost to the government?\n\n      A: Yes, because what was told to me was they’re going to give me -- give\n      our company, Gulf Group General Enterprises, the BPA call for Camp\n      Virginia in lieu of, in exchange of Camp Buehring.\n\n      Q: So, your agreement was conditioned upon them giving you Virginia; is\n      that correct?\n\n      A: Yes.\n                                           ...\n\n      Q: By the time the officers came to your yard, you had no idea of this\n      agreement or did you, to switch Virginia for Buehring?\n\n      A: At the time, I don’t think so. It happened right around that time, though,\n      a day after, two days after, yeah.\n\n       Saud Al Tawash testified that he had attempted to discuss the cancellations of\nthe Camp Buehring call with Col. Hess, but that “[h]e wouldn’t meet with me. I tried to\nmeet with him in the office. I came to Arifjan. He wouldn’t meet with me.” The\nmodification that terminated the camp package BPA call for Camp Buehring does not\nmention any exchange of Camp Buehring for Camp Virginia, or any other camp\npackage BPA call. Moreover, it is odd that the camp package BPA call was terminated\njust twelve days after it was awarded, especially because the parties have stipulated the\nArmy still required the Camp Buehring services and had funding available.\n\n       Plaintiff relies on Col. Hess’ testimony for the assertion that Maj. Davis did not\nexercise her own discretion in the termination of the Camp Buehring call, but, rather,\n\n\n                                          139\n\ffollowed an order from a superior. During his testimony to the court, Col. Hess\nconfirmed that he was the person who had ordered Maj. Davis to terminate the camp\npackage BPA call:\n\n       Q: When Gloria Davis terminated the BPA Call for the camp package on\n       Camp Buehring, was she exercising her discretion?\n\n       A: No.\n\n       Q: Was she following a direct order?\n\n       A: Yes.\n                                             …\n\n       Q: When you ordered Gloria Davis to terminate the BPA camp package\n       for Camp Buehring, did she ask you for a security report or some type of\n       document to back up and document the file?\n\n       A: No.\n\n       When she terminated the Camp Buehring call, BPA call 0001, Maj. Davis may\nhave been acting at the direction of Col. Hess, who, although he was not the assigned\ncontracting officer on the Camp Buehring camp package BPA call, was the Director of\nContracting at Camp Arifjan. Maj. Davis, a warranted contracting officer, was directly\nbelow Col. Hess in the chain of command within the contracting office. Col. Hess did\nnot explicitly testify that Col. Miller directed him to have the BPA call terminated, but he\ndid state “that we were told, directed either directly by Colonel Miller or through his staff\nsections, to get that contractor [Gulf Group] off the installation.” At trial, Col. Miller\ndenied having given such a direction.\n\n       Maj. Davis, however, was unavailable to testify, having committed suicide after\nbeing questioned by Army CID about funds in offshore accounts. Neither Col. Miller nor\nCol. Hess offered explanations for the termination of the Camp Buehring call, although\nCol. Hess indicated he had ordered the termination, possibly at the behest of Col. Miller.\nThe most coherent explanation of the decision to terminate the Camp Buehring call and\nthe decision not to award Camp Virginia to Gulf Group may come from Mr. Cockerham’s\ntestimony at trial.\n\n       As indicated above, Mr. Cockerham sent the following note to Saud Al Tawash\nregarding the termination of the Camp Buehring call:\n\n       Here is a copy of the cancellation to Camp Buehring. This cancellation\n       was made because we were giving you a larger camp call Virginia.\n       Virginia award was verbal with the agreement to cancel Buehring. Virginia\n       was not awarded on paper as a command directive. The original\n\n\n\n                                            140\n\f      cancellation was sent out 13 Oct 04.         But here is another copy as\n      requested. Thank you.\n\nAlthough Saud Al Tawash testified that he interpreted Mr. Cockerham’s note to be a\nnotice that Gulf Group would not receive the award of a Camp Virginia call, Mr.\nCockerham testified that the note may have served as a “reassurance” to Gulf Group,\nexplaining that he intended to convey that, although Army personnel had verbally\nindicated that Gulf Group would receive the award of a Camp Virginia call, the formal\naward had been placed on hold at the direction of Col. Hess. Mr. Cockerham stated\nthat Col. Hess may have been considering another contractor for the Camp Virginia call\nand that Col. Hess “was checking on…some other issues from perhaps a security\nreport.” Mr. Cockerham estimated that the direction not to award a Camp Virginia call to\nGulf Group and the cancellation of Gulf Group’s latrine contract and dumpster contract\noccurred “within a week period of that whole time.” From Mr. Cockerham’s testimony,\ntherefore, it appears that Army personnel may have been directed to place the award of\nthe Camp Virginia call on hold as a result of what appears to be the same alleged\nsecurity incident that led to the terminations of the latrine contract and dumpster\ncontract.\n\n        “‘In the absence of bad faith or a clear abuse of discretion the contracting\nofficer’s election to terminate is conclusive.’” See Caldwell & Santmyer, Inc. v.\nGlickman, 55 F.3d at 1581 (quoting Salsbury Indus. v. United States, 905 F.2d at 1521).\nPlaintiff must present clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption that\ngovernment agents act in good faith. See Am-Pro Protective Agency, Inc. v. United\nStates, 281 F.3d at 1239–40. Plaintiff argues that “[t]he Government’s termination of\nthe contract was not properly based on convenience inasmuch as the Government\nneeded the services, had the requisite funding to fully pay for them at the contract price\nand indeed contracted with another contractor to provide the same services at the same\nlevel of demand and for the same period of performance.” A demonstration that the\ngovernment entered into a contract with no intention of honoring it may be sufficient to\nshow bad faith or an abuse of discretion.

The record, however,\nalso does not support a performance-based reason to have terminated plaintiff’s camp\npackage BPA call.139 Defendant has consistently maintained that the Army terminated\n139\n    The unsigned October 20, 2004 Memorandum for Record and the October 29, 2004\nletter purportedly written by Col. Miller refer to performance-related issues, but the\nunsigned Memorandum for Record was renounced by various witnesses at trial and the\n\n                                           141\n\fthe Camp Buehring call in order to award Gulf Group a call for Camp Virginia.\nDefendant alleges that the security concerns only factored into the Army’s decision not\nto award Gulf Group a call for Camp Virginia. Plaintiff’s counsel argued, however, that\nthe decision to terminate the Camp Buehring call and the subsequent decision not to\naward a Camp Virginia call cannot be considered separately because they were part of\na “single but two-prong transaction.” Although Saud Al Tawash was not able to identify\nthe exact date on which Maj. Davis had proposed swapping Camp Buehring for Camp\nVirginia, it appears from the record that Saud Al Tawash had indicated he was\namenable to the swap, and that he may even have agreed to the termination of the\nCamp Buehring call on the condition that Gulf Group be awarded a Camp Virginia call.\nConsistent with this understanding, the Army appears to have prepared a call for Camp\nVirginia, although it never issued the call to Gulf Group.\n\n       The timeline of events indicates that the alleged security incident may have\nfactored into the Army’s decision not to award a Camp Virginia call to Gulf Group, but\ndoes not necessarily demonstrate that the alleged security incident motivated the\nArmy’s decision to terminate the Camp Buehring call. The alleged security incident\noccurred on Thursday, October 7, 2004, and the Camp Buehring call was terminated on\nTuesday, October 12, 2004. The latrine and dumpster contracts were not terminated\nuntil Monday, October 18, 2004 and Friday, October 22, 2004, respectively. Although\nthe alleged security incident occurred before the termination of the camp package call\nfor Camp Buehring, Mr. Cockerham’s testimony regarding the hand-written note that he\nsent to Saud Al Tawash indicates that the termination of the Camp Buehring call also\nmay have resulted from discussions that preceded the October 7, 2004 alleged security\nincident, even though, at one point during his testimony, Saud Al Tawash indicated that\nan actual agreement to swap camps may have been formed after October 7, 2004.\nAccording to Mr. Cockerham, the alleged security incident did not impact Gulf Group’s\nperformance under the camp package BPA until Col. Hess put the formal award of a\nCamp Virginia call on hold pending a review of a “security report.” Mr. Cockerham’s\nexplanation that the Camp Buehring call was terminated by agreement also is\nconsistent with the different language used in the camp package BPA call termination,\nversus the latrine contract and dumpster contract terminations. The termination of the\ncamp package BPA call for Camp Buehring indicated that Gulf Group was aware of,\nand had even agreed to the termination, while the latrine and dumpster contract\nterminations indicated that they were issued “by order of the ASG Commander Kuwait\nCOL Brick Miller” and cited provisions of the FAR relating to terminations for\nconvenience.\n\n       Moreover, numerous Army personnel testified that defendant believed that Gulf\nGroup was fully capable of performing under the camp package BPA, despite the\nOctober 29, 2004 unsigned letter purportedly from Col. Miller. The Army continued to\nissue calls to Gulf Group under the camp package BPA after the alleged security\nincident was resolved. Approximately two months after the termination of the Camp\nBuehring call, for example, Army personnel awarded Gulf Group a call for Camp Victory\n\nunsigned letter purportedly written by Col. Miller was contradictory to the conclusions of\nthe officers who conducted the second site visit.\n\n                                           142\n\fand a call for a naval base in Kuwait, as well as for the Ash Shuaybah Sea Port of\nDebarkation. In fact, the Army continued to issue camp package BPA calls to Gulf\nGroup through 2005 and 2006.\n\n        Although the timeline of events is far from clear, the record reflects a sufficient\nand possible good faith explanation for the termination of the Camp Buehring call.\nPlaintiff recognizes in its post-trial briefing, Maj. Davis’ death makes the details of the\ntermination of the Camp Buehring call “less apparent” than the details of the latrine\ncontract and dumpster contract terminations. Although Maj. Davis was unavailable to\ntestify as to her reasons for terminating the Camp Buehring call, both Saud Al Tawash\nand Mr. Cockerham confirmed that, at some point, the Army had decided to cancel the\nCamp Buehring call in order to award a Camp Virginia call to Gulf Group. Although the\nalleged security incident may have caused Col. Hess not to implement the decision to\naward Camp Virginia to plaintiff, the record suggests that Col. Hess may have\ncountermanded the decision to award Gulf Group a Camp Virginia call after the\ntermination of the Camp Buehring call, and after the alleged security incident had\noccurred. Given the timing of events and the testimony of Saud Al Tawash and Mr.\nCockerham, the court does not agree with plaintiff that the termination of the Camp\nBuehring call and the decision not to award a Camp Virginia call to Gulf Group are\nnecessarily part of the same transaction. Although the court recognizes that the record\nreflects unanswered questions with regard to the termination of the Camp Buehring call,\nplaintiff has failed to present the court with clear and convincing evidence to rebut the\npresumption that Army personnel terminated the Camp Buehring call in order to award\na Camp Virginia call in good faith. See Am–Pro Protective Agency, Inc. v. United\nStates, 281 F.3d at 1240–41. Although the government officials may have indicated a\nwillingness to award a Camp Virginia call to plaintiff in exchange for the Camp Buehring\ncall, there was no contractual obligation on the part of the government to award the\nCamp Virginia call to Gulf Group. Considering the high burden that plaintiff must\novercome to show that Maj. Davis abused her discretion when she terminated the\nCamp Buehring call, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that defendant abused its\ndiscretion in terminating plaintiff’s Camp Buehring call for the convenience of the\ngovernment.\n\n        Although proof that a termination for convenience was an abuse of discretion\nrenders the terminated contract breached, Krygoski Constr. Co. v. United States, 94\nF.3d at 1541, “[i]n the absence of bad faith or clear abuse of discretion, the contracting\nofficer’s election to terminate for the government’s convenience is conclusive.” T & M\nDistribs., Inc. v. United States, 185 F.3d at 1283. The termination for convenience of\nthe camp package BPA was within the contracting officer’s discretion and, therefore, the\ntermination of the camp package BPA call was not a breach of contract. The plaintiff’s\nthird amended complaint in Case No. 06-835C, the camp package BPA claim, alleges\nthat:\n\n      The Government, by virtue of its arbitrary decision to cancel the contract\n      without just cause, diverted business away from Gulf Group and thereby\n      caused Gulf Group to sustain substantial damages. The Government is\n\n\n                                           143\n\f      required to fully compensate Gulf Group for those damages and to put\n      Gulf Group in as good a position as it would have been had the\n      Government not cancelled the contract, including fair compensation for the\n      preparatory expenses incurred in furtherance of the contract and in\n      pursuing the claim submitted to the Contracting Officers, as well as profits\n      Gulf Group would have generated under the BPA Call and Master BPA\n      upon which Gulf Group fully relied, interest, legal fees and costs of\n      litigation.\n\n      As a result of the Government’s arbitrary and wrongful termination of the\n      contract, Gulf Group is entitled to damages in the form of preparatory\n      expenses of KWD 19,323.000 equivalent to U.S. $69,002.43 calculated at\n      the exchange rate of 1 KWD @ U.S. $3.571; fees and costs incurred in\n      the preparation and presentation of a termination claim and settlement\n      proposal that was presented to the Contracting Officers in Kuwait in the\n      sum of U.S. $7,037.50; in addition to lost profits of KWD 237,135.791\n      equivalent to U.S. $846,811.91 calculated at the exchange rate of 1 KWD\n      @ 3.571 representing the lost profits for the entire 6 months duration of\n      the BPA Call that was awarded. Gulf Group also is entitled to prejudgment\n      interest under the Contract Dispute [sic] Act, the specific sum of which will\n      be proven at the time of trial.\n\n(internal citations omitted; emphasis in original). As there was no “arbitrary and\nwrongful termination of the contract” with respect to the camp package BPA call, plaintiff\ncannot recover on the camp package BPA call on the basis of a breach. Moreover, as\nnoted above, plaintiff’s argument by analogy that lost profits could be included for other\ncalls issued under the BPA relies on situations in which the wronged contractor can\nprove that the government chose, in bad faith, not to exercise the option periods.140\nSee, e.g., Hi-Shear Tech. Corp. v. United States, 356 F.3d at 1374, 1375, 1380;\nBlackstone Consulting, Inc. v. Gen. Servs. Admin., CBCA 718, 08-1 BCA ¶ 33,770;\nGreenlee Constr., Inc. v. Gen. Servs. Admin., CBCA 416, 07-1 BCA ¶ 33,514. As the\ncourt also determined above, there is no evidence that, had the camp package BPA call\nnot been terminated, the government would have continued placing orders under the\ncamp package BPA or would have abused its discretion in not placing orders under the\nBPA. The government is not obligated to issue orders under a BPA or exercise an\noption that is not otherwise restricted. See, e.g., Gov’t Sys. Advisors, Inc. v. United\nStates, 847 F.2d at 813 (“An option is normally an option, and nothing in [the provision\nat issue], or in any other contract clause, limited the circumstances under which the\ngovernment could decline to exercise that bargained-for right in this case.”).\nFurthermore, anticipatory profits are generally not an available remedy when the\ngovernment terminates a contract for convenience.

Libbey of the U.S. Army\n       Contracting Agency for Southwest Asia - Kuwait, issued a final decision on\n       the camp package BPA granting in part and denying in part Gulf Group’s\n       claim for damages, awarding compensation in the amount of $33,053.57\n       plus interest. Gulf Group seeks additional compensation be awarded by\n       this Court for its damages that were denied all as it will be shown at the\n       time of trial.\n\n(internal citation omitted). The majority of the testimony at trial addressed the award of\nthe contracts and BPAs, the alleged security incident and the government’s reaction to\nthe incident, the hiring of Ms. Blake, Saud Al Tawash’s relationship with Mr. Cockerham,\nand the inflated claims. Little testimony at trial specifically addressed the denied\nelements of Gulf Group’s 2007 claim on the camp package BPA before Mr. Libbey.\n\n        The task before the court to determine if plaintiff is entitled to additional\ncompensation under the existing termination for convenience of the camp package BPA\ncall also is made more difficult by the numerous and different claim amounts submitted\nto Mr. Libbey in the form of certified claims, and to this court in the form of complaints\nand amended complaints. Plaintiff has sought various amounts for recovery on the\ncamp package BPA claim, including $10,000,000.00 in its 2005 Claim and Settlement\nOffer to Mr. Cockerham, which also proposed a $4,544,339.84 “settlement offer,” and\n$7,000,000.00 in its 2007 claim to Mr. Libbey. In its original complaint in Case No. 06-\n835C, the camp package BPA case, plaintiff sought $7,000,000.00. In its first amended\ncomplaint in the camp package BPA case, plaintiff sought $2,682,160.86.141 In its\nsecond amended complaint in the camp package BPA case, plaintiff sought\n$3,463,287.57.142 Subsequently, in its third amended complaint in the camp package\ncase, plaintiff now seeks $922,851.84.143\n\n      Few exhibits introduced at trial offer any support for plaintiff’s specific claims after\nthe contracting officer’s final decision.

For example, Saud Al Tawash tried to explain\nthe reduction in the number of tower lights as follows:\n\n       Q: And did you, in fact, obtain or purchase from Kuwait Leaders 13\n       magnum tower lights?\n\n       A: We only purchased one from them.\n\n       Q: Why?\n\n       A: They had one that was available to us. The rest was not available. And\n       so, we purchased what they have, so we can bring it in, into the yard and\n       spec it out.\n\n                                             147\n\f       Q: Show it to the Army, is that –\n\n       A: We had -- we brought it into our yard, yeah, and our project manager at\n       that time, Mr. Bobby Wilson, he wanted to see the equipment and make\n       sure that this is the right specs to the Army. So, they had one delivered to\n       us prior to ordering the rest of the 13, because they’re expensive.\n\n        Plaintiff included in its 2011 notice and 2011 submission to Maj. Everett the\nidentical forms, purchase orders, checks, and hand-written notes included in the original\n2005 Claim and Settlement Offer to Mr. Cockerham. Plaintiff did not, however, identify\nthe differences in its costs in the 2011 notice and the third amended complaint from the\namounts awarded by Mr. Libbey in his May 21, 2007 contracting officer’s final decision\non the camp package BPA claim. In his final decision, Mr. Libbey wrote:\n\n       I determine Gulf Group is entitled to KD 1,765 for lights, KD 4,000 for\n       tents, and KD 3,490 for generators. This represents the percentage of\n       contract performance of the contract performed before contract\n       termination for which Gulf Group has not been compensated. Gulf Group\n       has not shown they incurred costs for water, and the only loss Gulf Group\n       incurred for dumpsters and latrines is anticipatory profit, which is not\n       allowable in this case. Gulf Group has failed to provide information\n       regarding settlement proposal preparation costs, and has failed to provide\n       information regarding legal costs incurred from perusing this matter before\n       the Court of Federal Claims. Therefore, no costs have been established\n       for submittal and pursuit of the termination settlement proposal. Gulf\n       Group is entitled to $33,053.57, plus interest. I believe this [sic] a fair and\n       reasonable settlement.\n\n        Notably, Mr. Libbey determined that Gulf Group was entitled to the same amount\nfor the tower lights, tents, and generators as plaintiff claims in its revised settlement. No\nsupport was given at trial for the added claim of Mr. Biju Mathew, and the testimony by\nSaud Al Tawash in support of the fifty dumpsters was confused and unsupported. At\ntrial, Saud Al Tawash provided the following testimony:\n\n       Q: What is the document at page 263?\n\n       A: This is a PO [Purchase Order] to Malika factory for steel works. They’re\n       the steel fabricator for the dumpsters.\n\n       Q: And are these the dumpsters that were required under BPA call\n       number one, Mr. Al Tawash?\n\n       A: Yeah, 61 pieces.\n\n\n\n\n                                            148\n\f       Q: And the size of the dumpsters, is that the correct size that was required\n       under the BPA?\n\n       A: This is the right size, six cubic feet\n\n       Q: So is this -- what is this?\n\n       A: This is dumpsters and it was ordered by Gulf Group.\n\n       Q: So is this for the 61 dumpsters that you had placed the purchase order\n       for with the Malika factory?\n\n       A: Yeah.\n\n       Q: And I see quantity 50, not 61. Do you know why?\n\n       A: As I said earlier, we may have had the inventory for the product, so\n       whatever the balance that we’re not having in the inventory, we would go\n       out on the market and purchase it, to have -- be prepared and readiness\n       for the contract.\n\n        The balance of the testimony did not clarify the discrepancies between the\nnumber of dumpsters, nor was there a demonstration that Gulf Group had actually paid\nfor the balance of the fifty dumpsters. Plaintiff only submitted an invoice for the\ndumpsters in its 2011 notice for the camp package BPA, without explaining whether the\npurchase of the dumpsters was attributable to Gulf Group’s performance of the camp\npackage BPA. In addition, plaintiff did not substantiate that it incurred additional costs\nfor the services of an accountant.144\n\n        Notwithstanding plaintiff’s minimal effort to demonstrate that it should be\ncompensated for the costs attributable to the purchase of dumpsters and Mr. Mathew’s\naccounting services, defendant has conceded that these costs were incurred in\nplaintiff’s performance of the contract. The parties stipulated that “Gulf Group ordered\n61 (6cm) dumpsters for use in the performance of BPA Call 0001 pursuant to BPA\nW912D1-04-A-0047, only [sic] 50 were delivered at a cost of 10,000 kd.” Defendant\nalso conceded in its post-trial brief that Gulf Group “actually spent only 19,323\nKD…preparing to perform Call 0001,” citing to the amount claimed in plaintiff’s 2011\nnotice. Defendant did not argue that costs associated with the dumpsters and Mr.\nMathew’s services could have been mitigated or avoided, or are otherwise not\nrecoverable. Instead, defendant treated the costs as validly incurred in plaintiff’s\npreparation to perform the Camp Buehring call. The court concludes, therefore, that\ndefendant has conceded that plaintiff incurred costs, both in purchasing the fifty\n144\n   The amount that plaintiff claims that it incurred for accounting services appears to be\nconsistent with the amount that plaintiff attributes to accounting services in its lost profit\ncalculations with respect to the camp package BPA, the latrine contract, and the\ndumpster contract.\n\n                                              149\n\fdumpsters and in utilizing Mr. Mathew’s services, in preparation of performing the camp\npackage BPA call. Plaintiff is entitled to 19,323.000 KD, plus interest, which is the full\namount of costs claimed in plaintiff’s 2011 notice, less attorneys’ fees.\n\n         In plaintiff’s 2011 notice for the camp package BPA, plaintiff also seeks “legal\nexpenses incurred in preparation of the claim” as a result of Ferdinand Peters’ work on\nplaintiff’s 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer. The FAR provides that settlement\nexpenses, including “[a]ccounting, legal, clerical, and similar costs reasonably\nnecessary for...[t]he preparation and presentation, including supporting data, of\nsettlement claims to the contracting officer,” may be recoverable in the event of a\ncontract termination. See 48 C.F.R. § 31.205–42 (2005). Attorney Peters provided, at\nbest, incorrect information during the preparation of the 2005 camp package BPA Claim\nand Settlement Offer. Attorney Peters, in part, is why defendant has alleged that Gulf\nGroup submitted false claims relating to the termination of the camp package BPA call.\nAttorneys’ fees incurred in the submission of a “meritless” settlement proposal, which\nresults in a “legally insufficient and factually unsupportable” claim, are not recoverable.\nSee OK’s Cascade Co. v.

Md. May 18, 2011). In its 2005 camp package BPA\nClaim and Settlement Offer, Gulf Group followed required procedures in proposing a\nsettlement to the contracting officer following a termination for convenience. See 48\nC.F.R. § 49.602–1(b) (“Standard Form 1436, Settlement Proposal (Total Cost Basis),\nshall be used to submit settlement proposals resulting from the termination of fixed-price\ncontracts....”). Gulf Group, however, did not engage in typical settlement negotiations\nas it asserted entitlement to a fixed amount in addition to making a settlement proposal.\nAs indicated above, Gulf Group’s 2005 camp package BPA Claim and Settlement Offer\nwas unsupported and without a legal or factual basis. Although Gulf Group’s 2011\nsubmission to Maj. Everett may have included some additional factual information and\ntried to correct legal errors in its 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer, Gulf Group cannot\nrecover attorneys’ fees for claims submitted to the contracting officer after litigation has\ncommenced. See OK’s Cascade Co. v. United States, 97 Fed. Cl. at 649 (“[T]o the\nextent settlement proposal costs were incurred after the commencement of this\nlitigation, the costs are improper because the FAR provides for settlement costs\nsubmitted to the contracting officer as a result of the termination.”). Moreover, costs\nincurred in submitting a claim to a contracting officer are not otherwise generally\nrecoverable. See Scott Timber Co. v.

The court, therefore, denies\nplaintiff’s request for additional compensation arising from Attorney Peters’ services in\n\n\n\n                                            150\n\fthe preparation of plaintiff’s 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer for the camp package\nBPA.\n\n       In sum, the court finds that camp package BPA call No. 0001 was not breached\nby the government’s termination on October 12, 2004. Because defendant conceded\nthat plaintiff is entitled to costs incurred in preparing to perform the contract, the court\nawards plaintiff 19,323.000 KD, plus interest, under the camp package BPA.\n\nB.     The Latrine and Dumpster Contract Terminations\n\n        In plaintiff’s second amended complaints in both Case No. 06-858C, the latrine\ncase, and Case No. 06-853C, the dumpster case, plaintiff alleges “[t]he Government’s\ntermination of the contract was not properly based on convenience inasmuch as the\nGovernment needed the services, had the requisite funding to fully pay for them at the\ncontract price and contracted with one or more other contractors to provide the same\nservices at the same level of demand.” Plaintiff further claims that Gulf Group had done\nnothing to merit terminations for default for either the latrine or dumpster contracts,\nusing the exact same language in each of the second amended complaints: “Gulf Group\nhad not committed any default or breach justifying termination nor done or failed to do\nanything that would be a justifiable cause for termination.” Defendant similarly provided\nthe same responses in its answers to plaintiff’s second amended complaints in the\nlatrine and dumpster cases, denying plaintiff’s allegations. Because the language of\nplaintiff’s allegations and defendant’s responses, are virtually identical in both cases, the\ncourt analyzes the terminations of the latrine and dumpster contracts together.\n\n       The latrine contract, W912D1-04-P-0932, was terminated pursuant to 48 C.F.R.\n§ 52.212-4, on October 18, 2004, when Mr. Cockerham issued Modification P00002 on\nbehalf of the Army. Modification P00002 stated: “This contract is being canceled due to\ncommand directive of the ASG commander SWA COL Brick Miller 3rd Army Arcent\nKuwait. The contract is canceled under the terms of 52.212-1, 52-212-4 [sic], 52.249-\n4.” The parties stipulated that: “The Government did not terminate Gulf Group for\ndefault under Contract W912D1-04-P-0932 [the latrine contract]. At the time Contract\nW912D1-04-P-0932 was terminated, the Government had not issued any cure notices\nto Gulf Group regarding Gulf Group’s performance of its contractual obligations under\nthat contract, and none was ever issued at any time thereafter.” Despite terminating\nGulf Group’s latrine contract, the government had sufficient funds to pay for, and\ncontinued to be in need of, the latrine services.\n\n        The dumpster contract, W912D1-04-P-0897, was terminated pursuant to 48\nC.F.R. § 52.212-4, on October 22, 2004, when Mr. Cockerham issued Modification\nP00005 on behalf of the Army, which terminated the dumpster contract for the\nconvenience of the government. Like the latrine contract termination, the modification\nissued to cancel the dumpster contract stated: “Contract is canceled by order of the\nASG Commander Kuwait COL Brick Miller. Contract was canceled in accordance with\nFAR Part 52-212-4 Termination for Convenience of the Government,” which, as with the\nlatrine contract, was incorporated by reference into the dumpster contract. The parties\n\n\n                                            151\n\fstipulated that: “The Government did not terminate Gulf Group for default under\nContract W912D1-04-P-0897,” and “[a]t the time Contract W912D1-04-P-0897 was\nterminated, the Government had not issued any Cure Notices to Gulf Group regarding\nGulf Group’s performance of its contractual obligations under that contract, and none\nwas ever issued at any time thereafter.” Despite the termination of Gulf Group’s\ndumpster contract, the government had sufficient funds to pay for, and continued to be\nin need of, the dumpster services.\n\n       The latrine and dumpster contracts incorporated by reference the standard\ntermination for convenience and the termination for cause clauses, identical to the\nclauses in the camp package BPA quoted above. The latrine contract also incorporated\nby reference 48 C.F.R. § 52.249–1 (1984), Termination for Convenience of the\nGovernment (Fixed–Price) (Short Form), which states: “The Contracting Officer, by\nwritten notice, may terminate this contract, in whole or in part, when it is in the\nGovernment’s interest. If this contract is terminated, the rights, duties, and obligations of\nthe parties, including compensation to the Contractor, shall be in accordance with Part\n49 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation in effect on the date of this contract.” In\naddition, the latrine contract incorporated by reference 48 C.F.R § 52.249–4 (1984),\nTermination for Convenience of the Government (Services) (Short Form), which states:\n“The Contracting Officer, by written notice, may terminate this contract, in whole or in\npart, when it is in the Government’s interest. If this contract is terminated, the\nGovernment shall be liable only for payment under the payment provisions of this\ncontract for services rendered before the effective date of termination.”145\n\n        In defendant’s second post-trial brief, defendant states that “Mr. Cockerham\nissued a contract modification terminating the latrine contract for the convenience of the\nGovernment, effective October 18, 2004,” and “Mr. Cockerham issued a contract\nmodification terminating the dumpster contract for the convenience of the Government,\neffective October 22, 2004.” Defendant asserts that either Mr. Cockerham exercised his\nown discretion by agreeing with the directions from Col. Miller to terminate the\ncontracts, or implemented the terminations at the direction of Col. Hess, Director of\nContracting at Camp Arifjan. At trial, it remained unclear as to who was responsible for\nthe order to terminate the latrine contract and the dumpster contract, with conflicting\ntestimony offered, including from Col. Hess and Col. Miller. Col. Hess testified that Col.\nMiller ordered that Gulf Group’s latrine and dumpster contracts be terminated, and Col.\nMiller denied that he had ordered the terminations.\n\n      In the same post-trial brief, however, defendant insists that the latrine contract\nwas terminated for the convenience of the government due to force protection and\n145\n   The preamble to the 48 C.F.R. § 52.249–4 states: “As prescribed in 49.502(c), insert\nthe following clause in solicitations and contracts for services, regardless of value, when\na fixed-price contract is contemplated and the Contracting Officer determines that\nbecause of the kind of services required, the successful offeror will not incur substantial\ncharges in preparation for and in carrying out the contract, and would, if terminated for\nthe convenience of the Government, limit termination settlement charges to services\nrendered before the date of termination.” See 48 C.F.R. § 52.249–4.\n\n                                            152\n\fsecurity issues, and that the Army did not breach the contracts. Defendant argues that\n“the latrine contract was terminated for the convenience of the Government for security\nreasons.” In the same brief regarding the dumpster contract, defendant also asserts,\n“[d]espite what Col. Miller and Col. Hess may believe, the October 7, 2004 security\nincident is almost certainly what set in motion the termination of the dumpster contract.”\n(internal citation omitted). Mr. Cockerham testified that he requested a meeting to\ndocument the security issues before terminating the latrine and dumpster contracts, but\ncould not get one with Col. Hess. In the answer to the third amended complaint in the\ncamp package BPA case, Case No. 06-835C, and in the answer to the second\namended complaint in both the latrine case, Case No. 06-858C, and the dumpster case,\nCase No. 06-853C, defendant admitted “that Lieutentant [sic] Colonel Hess did not\nprovide former Major Cockerham with a security report.”\n\n        Defendant argues that the alleged security incident, in which Mohammed Al\nTawash was detained after asking questions, taking notes, and making drawings of\nlocations of buildings on the military base in order to assist in determining placement\nlocations for dumpsters under the plaintiff’s contract with the government, including the\nlocations for where the general officer lived and whether the water and communications\ntowers were the highest points on base, was initially reported as a potential criminal or\nterrorist incident. At trial, during direct examination of Col. Hess, plaintiff’s counsel read\nback Col. Hess’ deposition testimony to him, in which he stated\n\n       there was concern raised by the security and intel community on [Camp]\n       Arifjan that the company or owners of the company were involved, and I\n       don’t recall even with whom, but they were involved with people of\n       interest, be it, I’m not sure if it was Taliban, I’m not sure if it was Saddam\n       Hussein’s outfit, any of that, but they were concerned about the\n       involvement of the owners of this company being involved with enemies of\n       America.\n\n       Although defendant continued to assert that at the time of the terminations the\nArmy believed there were security concerns, on November 3, 2004, just sixteen days\nafter plaintiff’s latrine contract was terminated, and just twelve days after plaintiff’s\ndumpster contract was terminated, defendant wrote the apology letter signed by Col.\nHess, indicating that the Army had determined that Gulf Group, in fact, did not pose a\nsecurity threat. Defendant, however, adds a curious aside in its second post-trial brief:\n“Although the contract had been terminated because of security concerns, the\ncontracting command acceded to the congressman’s specific request, and wrote that\nthe latrine contract ‘was not terminated because of security reasons.’” Presumably, if\nthe security concerns were real, the senior officers responsible would have investigated\nthe relevant facts before quickly issuing a letter denying any official security concerns.\nAs noted above, courts assume government officials act in good faith. The Army acting\non or acceding to the request of a United States Congressman, if a real security threat\nexisted, would undermine that assumption.\n\n\n\n\n                                            153\n\f       The government did not even open a case or launch an investigation into the\nalleged security incident before terminating the latrine or dumpster contracts,\nsuggesting that terminations may already have been part of the government’s plan prior\nto the alleged security incident. For example, the parties have stipulated that “[a]ll or\npart of the service that was initially awarded to Gulf Group under the latrine contract\nwas awarded to Jasmine.” Col. Hess testified at trial, after reviewing the joint exhibits,\nthat Jasmine was awarded a latrine contract on October 18, 2004, the same day Gulf\nGroup’s latrine contract was cancelled. At trial, Saud Al Tawash testified that “Jasmine\npicked up where I left. Jasmine is a competitor, and they absorbed -- when we were\ncanceled, Jasmine took over our portion of the contract from Camp Arifjan.” In addition,\nbefore the Army terminated Gulf Group’s dumpster contract, it sent out a request to\nanother contractor, Fouad Salem of Abdul Hameed Salem, seeking a quote for\ndumpster services at Camp Arifjan. The request was sent out on October 14, 2004, but\nthe cancellation of Gulf Group’s dumpster contract was not signed until October 21,\n2004. Also, before the Army terminated the dumpster contract, it awarded a dumpster\ncontract to another contractor, Green Valley, on October 18, 2004. The government\ncontinued to require, and had available funds to pay for the dumpster services.\n\n      The record, including the trial testimony, reveals varied and inconsistent\nexplanations by defendant’s witnesses concerning the reasons for the terminations of\nGulf Group’s contracts. On November 3, 2004, Col. Hess sent the letter to Mohammed\nAl Tawash regarding cancellation of Gulf Group’s latrine contract, which stated in part:\n\n      Please rest assured that the Gulf Group’s contract to service portable\n      latrines at Army camps in Kuwait was not terminated because of security\n      reasons. While it is true that some employees of the Gulf Group have\n      been either barred from the installation or warned because they had not\n      followed the rules for contract employees on the installation, these\n      incidents did not cause the termination of the contract.\n\n      The contracting officer terminated the contract because circumstances\n      arose that caused the contracting officer to conclude that it was in the best\n      interest of the Army to terminate the contract. Since the contract was\n      terminated for convenience of the government, the Gulf Group should not\n      suffer any repercussions to its reputation or competitive standing. The\n      Gulf Group is fully eligible to compete for other Army contracts in Kuwait.\n      I hope this clarifies this unfortunate misunderstanding.146\n146\n    At trial, among other evasive and contradictory statements he made, Col. Hess\nattempted to distance himself from the November 3, 2004 apology letter, when he\ntestified:\n\n      Q: The first sentence in the third paragraph [of the November 3, 2004,\n      apology letter, quoted above,] recites, and I quote, “the contracting officer\n      terminated the contract because circumstances arose that caused the\n      contracting officer to conclude that it was in the best interest of the Army\n      to terminate the contract.” In the previous paragraph we said that security\n\n                                           154\n\f        According to Col. Hess’ recollection at trial regarding the November 3, 2004 letter\nto Mohammed Al Tawash, the security and espionage concerns about Gulf Group\n“turned out to be unfounded,” and the statement that some Gulf Group employees had\nbeen barred was, likewise, untrue and inaccurate. Col. Hess indicated he had obtained\nthat information to insert into the letter from Col. Miller. At trial, Col. Hess elaborated:\n\n       My recollection of the letter was we went through all the security stuff, all\n       the concerns about espionage in the previous few exhibits we went\n       through, and it turned out to be unfounded. This is my recollection. As\n       such, we still had a viable contractor that we could do business with. The\n       purpose of this letter was to put Gulf Group on notice that we still would\n       like to consider them to do Army contracting, to engage, to bid on Army\n       requirements in the future.\n\nCol. Hess further indicated at trial that the contracts were terminated for convenience,\nrather than for default, because the government did not “want to cause any undue\nhardship” for Gulf Group. At trial, however, Col. Hess testified that he believed Gulf\nGroup’s latrine and dumpster contracts were terminated for security reasons by the\ncontracting officer at Col. Miller’s request. Col. Hess stated, “[w]e were ordered to get\nGulf Group off the bases, the camps,” and that “[m]y concern was to get the contractor\noff Brick Miller’s installations.…”\n\n       Col. Miller, however, denied directing the termination of the contracts and stated\nthat he did not have the authority to order the terminations. Adding to the confusion\nsurrounding the termination of the latrine and dumpster contracts, and, despite noting\nthat his command was completely separate from contracting, Col. Miller, nonetheless,\nstated that the terminations were not related to the alleged security incident, suggesting\nthat he had personal knowledge about the basis for the terminations, although he did\nnot elaborate.\n\n       According to Maj. Petty’s recollection, some or all of Gulf Group’s contracts were\nterminated because of the alleged security incident. Capt. Novak testified that one of\nGulf Group’s contracts was terminated because of a security incident, but he did not\nknow which one. Col. Portouw thought the cancellations were related to poor latrine\nperformance. Mr. Cockerham testified that Col. Hess directed him to cancel Gulf\nGroup’s contracts for national security reasons. Col. Hess testified that Mr. Cockerham\nwas following a command directive when he terminated the dumpster contract and was\nnot exercising his own discretion. Mr. Cockerham confirmed that Col. Hess had\ndirected him to cancel the dumpster contract. Mr. Cockerham also testified:\n\n\n       reasons were not the basis for the termination. What did you have in mind\n       in writing this third sentence as the circumstances that were in the best\n       interest of the Army?\n\n       A: I’m not sure what I meant by that sentence.\n\n                                            155\n\f         Q: Did I understand your testimony correctly that you supported Colonel\n         Miller’s and Colonel’s Hess’ decision to terminate Gulf Group’s contracts\n         in the name of national security, but not for any other reason?\n\n         A: Correct.\n\n         Q: So if the reason for terminating Gulf Group’s contracts was not a\n         national security, you would have not supported that decision, would you?\n\n         A: No.\n\n       Clea Efthimiadis, a civilian Army lawyer assigned to Camp Arifjan, testified that\nCol. Miller told her that plaintiff’s latrine contract “was terminated because they couldn’t\ndo the job,” and that the contract was terminated for default based on a “repeated failure\nto perform to the statement of work.” Gulf Group’s latrine contract, however, was not\nterminated for default, which conflicts with Ms. Efthimiadis’ alleged conversation with\nCol. Miller.\n\n       Mr. Libbey, the contracting officer who supposedly reviewed all contract files\nbefore issuing his final decision, testified he thought the terminations were due to the\noverflowing latrine incident, dumpster diving, and security concerns. Mr. Libbey’s\ncontracting officer’s final decision for the latrine contract stated:\n\n         The latrine inspection revealed that the vast majority of latrines were in a\n         deplorable state of disrepair and the contractor was unsatisfactorily\n         performing the terms and conditions of the contract. Gulf Group was\n         advised of their poor performance and given an opportunity to remedy the\n         situation,147 but apparently their equipment capabilities (two waste tankers\n         with two drivers) and staff were incapable of meeting the terms of the\n         contract. At this same time, a substantial number of Gulf Group\n         employees were being barred from the base for installation security\n         infractions, which might have had a contributing affect [sic] on Gulf\n         Group’s inability to perform in an acceptable manner. Barely a week had\n         passed from the first latrine inspection when the General again summoned\n         Colonel Miller and LTC Hess to again observe the deplorable conditions of\n         the latrines.\n\n       A report prepared by counterintelligence at Camp Arifjan detailed the alleged\nsecurity incident, but at the end stated: “On 14 October, the Gulf Group General\nEnterprise [latrine] contract on Camp Arifjan was terminated by the Director of\nContracting at the request of the ASG-KU Commander, for not meeting the contractual\nobligation to clean the port-a-johns on Camp Arifjan twice per day.” As discussed\nbelow, however, the requirements of the latrine contract are conflicting with regard to\nthe cleaning requirements.\n\n147\n      There is no indication in the record that plaintiff was given any cure notices.\n\n                                              156\n\f        Mr. Libbey’s contracting officer’s final decision for the dumpster contract stated:\n“On 9 October 2004, six Gulf Group employees were detained for security violations\ninvolving traveling on Camp Arifjan without their required escort, and rummaging\nthrough a dumpster. At least four of these individuals were barred from Camp Arifjan by\nCol. Miller on 16 and 18 October 2004.” Plaintiff and its employees, however, were not\nbarred from Camp Arifjan. It was employees of Gulf Company, not Gulf Group, who\nhad been caught dumpster diving, and there was no relationship between these two\ndistinct companies. In addition, it appears that Mr. Libbey was confused about which\nGulf Group employees were issued letters of warning from the Army as a result of the\nalleged security incident involving Mohammed Al Tawash.\n\n        Mr. Peters, plaintiff’s first attorney, testified at trial that, after the terminations, he\nmet with Col. Hess, Col. Miller, Mr. Cockerham, and Tijani Saani in Kuwait and was\ngiven multiple reasons for the terminations. Mr. Peters testified that, after conversations\nwith various individuals, “[i]t was apparent to me that there were different reasons being\ngiven in meetings and/or in discussions with various people, like Colonel Brick Miller.”\nAttorney Peters further testified that Mr. Cockerham “told me a variety of things,”\nincluding that a general, whose name Mr. Peters did not recall, “had used a satellite\nlatrine portable, or attempted to use it, and it was not cleaned up. And for some reason,\non a brand new contract that had been awarded, my client was blamed for it. That was\none thing I was told. I was told other things, too.” Mr. Peters also testified that during\nhis meeting with Col. Miller, Col. Miller “mentioned” a latrine incident to Mr. Peters and\nmade statements that the plaintiff may have been allied with anti-Americans. Reflecting\non his meetings with the Army officials in Kuwait, Mr. Peters testified that:\n\n       I can only say that there were multiple reasons given [for the contract\n       terminations]. I do remember that Colonel Hess wrote a letter to the Al\n       Tawash family, not completely satisfactory, but saying that they were not a\n       problem, but it was not clear exactly what he was saying in the letter. I\n       remember that he was the contracting officer, and I wanted a General\n       grade office to write a letter so that it would have more impact, and that\n       was not forthcoming, and so I found that very questionable.\n\n        Saud Al Tawash stated he first learned about the impending terminations of the\nlatrine and dumpster contracts from competitors, including Jasmine, which indicated to\nSaud Al Tawash that the contracts would be cancelled because Gulf Group was\nallegedly anti-American and had ties to terrorist groups. According to Saud Al Tawash,\nCapt. Trimble, Capt. Novak, Lt. Rivera, and Tijani Saani all told him that there was a\nsecurity concern with Gulf Group. According to Mr. Wilson, Col. Hess told him that the\ncancellations had to do with security and counterintelligence and that the ASG\ncommander made the decision to cancel. Mr. Wilson also testified that he tried to speak\nto Col. Hess over the phone, but Col. Hess did not want to talk to him and was “really\nnervous, talking in circles.” Mr. Wilson further testified that Col. Hess stated during this\nphone call that Gulf Group’s contracts were terminated due to “counterintelligence on\nthe Al Tawash family, and they have ties [to] Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein.”\n\n\n\n                                               157\n\fAccording to notes summarizing the cancellation of Gulf Group’s contracts,148 Mr.\nWilson also heard someone comment that Gulf Group was “nothing but a bunch of kids\nand they [the Army] were going to get them out,” although he could not remember if he\nheard this from an Army officer or from one of Gulf Group’s competitors. Despite telling\nMr. Wilson, plaintiff’s Project Manager, that the Army was terminating Gulf Group’s\ncontracts for the alleged security risk, Tijani Saani, who worked in the contract office at\nCamp Arifjan, reportedly told Mr. Wilson that “we’ll try to get you guys some work....”\nMr. Wilson also stated that Col. Hess had said the Army was going to give plaintiff\nfurther work, and that either Mr. Cockerham or Capt. Novak said the same.149\n\n       It is odd that if the Army had truly considered Gulf Group a security threat,\ndefendant would have terminated plaintiff’s latrine and dumpster contracts for\nconvenience, rather than for cause, thereby allowing Gulf Group potentially to obtain\ndamages for the termination, and not barring Gulf Group from obtaining future contracts.\nNor is it likely that senior Army officials like Col. Hess would write letters to members of\nthe Al Tawash family stating, in part, “[p]lease rest assured that the Gulf Group’s\ncontract to service portable latrines at Army camps in Kuwait was not terminated\nbecause of security reasons,” if security concerns remained or were the justification for\nthe terminations.\n\n        Despite the varied reasons witnesses offered at trial for the terminations,\ndefendant would have this court believe that the Army terminated Gulf Group’s latrine\nand dumpster contracts due to the alleged security incident, which appears to have\nbeen innocent in origin, for which only a few Gulf Group employees received warning\nletters, and regarding which an investigation was never opened. Moreover, after the\nincident occurred, the Army continued to allow Gulf Group and its employees, including\nthose involved in the incident, to carry out their operations in the camp. The employees\nwho were detained for questioning were quickly released and no charges were filed\nagainst any individual or plaintiff. The individuals involved were not even asked to\nreturn for a hearing. Saud Al Tawash confirmed that neither Gulf Group nor any of Gulf\nGroup’s employees were barred from the camp because of the October 7, 2004 alleged\nsecurity incident or any other security concerns, and Gulf Group continued to perform\nwork for the United States government in the war theatre. The only consequence to\nplaintiff for the alleged security incident was that warning letters were sent to several\nGulf Group personnel on October 21, 2004. As indicated by Saud Al Tawash in his trial\n148\n    At trial, Mr. Wilson indicated that he did not prepare the summary of the notes,\nincluded as a plaintiff’s exhibit. When asked who prepared the summary he stated: “I’m\nassuming Mr. Peters.”\n149\n    It is difficult to tell from Mr. Wilson’s testimony which individual indicated the\ngovernment would provide more work for the plaintiff. Mr. Wilson stated: “Major\nCockerham was the same with me throughout the whole time. His basic stance was\nwhat happened and how this was handled was not right and that you know, they had –\nCaptain Novak had done a very good report on the company. A very nice PowerPoint\npresentation, come out, put his hands on everything and he said, we’re going to try to\nget you guys work.”\n\n                                            158\n\ftestimony, moreover, only some of the recipients of the warning letters were even\ninvolved in the alleged security incident.\n\n       Col. Portouw testified that no case was opened on the incident because “there\nwas no substance to it” and the questions of the Gulf Group employees were “innocent.”\nCol. Portouw also testified that, while incidents like this were not frequent, they were not\nuncommon, and “invariably we found that they were curiosity-generated reports and\nsimply required explaining to the employee why they shouldn’t do that.” Even Col. Hess\nand Maj. Petty testified that a map of the camp, as requested by Mohammed Al\nTawash, had it been provided at the start of performance, would have been useful. As\nto the warning letters sent to Gulf Group and the employees involved in the incident,\nCol. Miller also indicated that “[t]housands” of such letters were sent out at that point in\ntime in Kuwait and that the incident had “[n]othing to do with” the termination of plaintiff’s\ncontracts.\n\n        The incident involving Mohammed Al Tawash did not merit or receive great\nattention from the Army and was hardly substantial enough to warrant contract\ntermination actions. Moreover, Mohammed Al Tawash’s questions to determine\nlocations for the latrines appear to have been innocent and in furtherance of a legitimate\ncontract purpose. Indeed, on November 3, 2004, just sixteen days after terminating the\ncontract and less than four weeks after the alleged security incident, the Army issued a\nletter of apology, stating that Gulf Group’s latrine contract was not terminated for\nsecurity concerns. The court finds that there is no evidence in the record that Gulf\nGroup, Saud Al Tawash, or any member of the Al Tawash family had any terrorist ties\nor posed a security threat. Gulf Group has continued to do business with the United\nStates government. The alleged security incident, therefore, was an insufficient and\ndisingenuous basis for the terminations of plaintiff’s latrine and dumpster contracts.\n\n        Evidence as to a legitimate basis for terminating the latrine and dumpster\ncontracts, besides security reasons, also is lacking in the record. According to M. Sgt.\nSivert, Gulf Group did not have enough dumpsters to replace its predecessor, Future\nServices, resulting in trash appearing on the ground. At trial, M. Sgt. Sivert testified that\n“Gulf Group did not have all their dumpsters to replace the ones that Future Services\nwas taking away, and so there was a short time span that when the Future Service’s\n[sic] contract ran out, they came and got their dumpsters, and then because there was\nno dumpsters to replace them with, Food Services [sic] was actually putting some of the\ntrash and stuff on the ground, and we had to go back there and get it cleaned up after\nthey had put it on the ground.” After terminating Gulf Group’s dumpster contract, the\ngovernment awarded the services to another contractor, but required thirty-two more\ndumpsters than had been required from plaintiff. M. Sgt. Sivert explained that not all of\nthe other dumpster contracts had run out by September 30, 2004, and that both Future\nServices and Gulf Group had dumpsters on the base at Camp Arifjan. M. Sgt. Sivert\nremembered Gulf Group’s dumpsters being blue and Future Services’ dumpsters being\ngoldish brown. Saud Al Tawash, however, testified that Gulf Group’s dumpsters were\nred. Therefore, there is an additional issue as to the color of Gulf Group’s dumpsters,\nand there is testimony indicating that Gulf Group may not have been the lone contractor\n\n\n                                            159\n\fwith dumpsters in place at the time, calling into question whether Gulf Group’s\ndumpsters or another contractor’s dumpsters were overflowing. Saud Al Tawash also\ntestified that the trash may have been caused by competitors flipping over their own\ndumpsters, although there is no independent evidence in the record of other contractors\ndoing so. Megbel Al Tawash testified that, during the entire period of performance for\nthe dumpster contract, there were no complaints regarding plaintiff’s dumpster service\nat Camp Arifjan, nor did Gulf Group receive any nonconformance reports or any cure\nnotices from the government. In sum, there is in the record before the court insufficient\nevidence to prove that the trash on the ground or any other deficiencies in performance\nprompted or offered support for the terminations.\n\n        As to the allegations regarding any dirty latrines, there is conflicting evidence in\nthe record as to how many latrines were affected, the condition of the implicated\nlatrines, how often they were to be maintained, which latrines were involved, and who\nwas instructed by which employee of defendant to remedy the issue. Col. Miller\ntestified that about twenty latrines were overflowing onto the floor. Col. Miller stated that\neither Col. Hess or Col. Fugate was with him when he viewed the latrines. Col. Hess\ndid not remember any dirty latrine incident and did not recall seeing any overflowing,\nunplumbed latrines. Col. Hess testified that no one directed him to fix any dirty latrines.\nCol. Hess stated that Gulf Group was not terminated for poor performance under the\nlatrine contract.\n\n        Mr. Cockerham stated that only one latrine was not cleaned. Maj. Petty testified\nthat he inspected a group of eight to ten latrines which had “feces above the rim.” He\nstated that only one was extremely bad and unusable; the others were merely unkept.\nIn addition to Saud Al Tawash trying to explain that the latrines he provided were\nunplumbed and could not have overflowed, Megbel Al Tawash testified that Gulf\nGroup’s office received a phone call that one latrine had feces up to the brim, but it was\ncleaned that same day. Megbel Al Tawash also stated that Future Services had eight to\nten latrines in the same area near the mess hall, and Mr. Wilson stated that latrines\nfrom various companies looked the same. Maj. Petty also testified that Future Services\nstill had latrines in place when contractors Jasmine and Gulf Group first arrived.\n\n        Plaintiff argues that the contract only called for once-per-day cleaning of the\nlatrines. Indeed, the statement of work for the latrine contract states:\n\n       4.2 Cleaning. The Contractor will empty and clean each latrine daily by\n       wiping down interior walls and seat with mild disinfectant water or solution\n       (that is nonharmful to the skin and eyes) and will provide steam cleaning\n       reconditioning services once a month. The Contractor will provide all\n       materials, equipment, personnel, chemicals, and cleaning supplies to\n       include using an approved disinfectant. The Contractor will provide a\n       Material Safe Data Sheet to the COR [contracting officer’s representative]\n       for any chemicals used in this contract. The cleaning services will include\n       the following:\n\n\n\n                                            160\n\f       4.2.1 Daily. The Contractor will vacuum sewage from the basin. Debris\n       such as cans, bottles, rags, sticks, etc. will be removed from the waste\n       tank, collected and hauled away for proper disposal. No debris will be\n       allowed to contaminate the outside area around the chemical latrine. The\n       Contractor will be responsible for cleanup of any spills. After all sewage\n       and debris have been removed the Contractor will wash the toilet seat,\n       urinal, and adjacent area around the toilet seat with the approved cleaning\n       solution and remove all built up dirt and waste by scrubbing with a nylon\n       hand brush. The Contractor will fill the empty basin with a mixture of two\n       (2) cups disinfectant solution and ten (10) gallons fresh water. The\n       Contractor will refill toilet paper dispensers and hand sanitation gel\n       dispensers. The Contractor will leave the area in and around the latrines\n       in a sanitary state.\n\n(emphasis in original). At the end of the same section, however, the contract states,\n“[t]he vendor must use NEW Latrines and must take into consideration that they are\nbidding on the daily servicing of the latrines also latrines must be checked and cleaned\ntwice a day.” (emphasis in original).\n\n        According to Maj. Petty, servicing latrines once a day would have been sufficient.\nCol. Hess, however, stated that where latrines are located in high-traffic areas, like the\nmess hall or headquarters, a once-a-day service requirement may set a contractor up\nfor failure as these latrines need to be serviced twice per day. Steven Perry, a former\nArmy Colonel, and plaintiff’s expert on the issue of Army contracting and standard\npractices and procedures for Army contracting, testified that faulty specifications may\nhave been the cause of unclean latrines if the government had not anticipated the\nextent of usage. Mr. Perry also stated that, if bottles of water were found in a latrine, as\nsuggested in some of the testimony to the court, it would be the end user’s fault, not the\ncontractor’s. Mr. Perry indicated that latrine contracts can be difficult to manage,\nalthough Col. Hess and Maj. Petty disagreed.\n\n        Therefore, if the latrine incident was the only basis for the termination of the\nlatrine contract, especially without issuance of a cure notice, it appears to have been an\ninsufficient basis for termination of the latrine contract. There is conflicting evidence as\nto how many latrines were dirty, the extent of the uncleanliness, whether Gulf Group’s\nlatrines were the ones at issue, and whether Gulf Group was informed of any problems.\nMoreover, if, as suggested, plaintiff was responsive to a request to clean, there was an\ninsufficient basis to terminate the plaintiff’s latrine contract, particularly given that the\nspecifications were conflicting. Moreover, Col. Hess testified that a contractor missing a\ngroup of latrines during servicing was not uncommon and did not warrant termination for\ndefault. Col. Hess further stated that his contracting office did not have performance\nproblems with Gulf Group, and its latrine contract was not terminated for failure to meet\nits contractual obligations on the latrine contract. At the time the government terminated\nthe latrine contract, the Army continued to need the services and had the funds to pay.\nIn fact, the joint stipulation of facts submitted to the court by both parties states that,“[a]ll\nor part of the services that were initially awarded to Gulf Group under [the latrine\n\n\n                                              161\n\fcontract] was awarded to another Government contractor, Jasmine International\nTrading & Service Company.” Following termination of plaintiff’s latrine contract, the\ngovernment placed orders with Gulf Group for latrines at other locations, indicating that\nthe Army believed in Gulf Group’s ability to supply latrines and to service them.\n\n        In plaintiff’s second amended complaint for the latrine case, plaintiff alleges:\n\n        As a result of the Government’s arbitrary and wrongful termination of the\n        contract, Gulf Group is entitled to damages in the form of preparatory\n        expenses of KWD 25,757.137, equivalent to $91,978.74 calculated at the\n        exchange rate of 1 KWD @ U.S. $3.571, fees and costs incurred in the\n        preparation and presentation of a termination claim and settlement\n        proposal that was presented to the Contracting Officer in the sum of\n        $13,887.50, in addition to lost profits of KWD 763,034.432 equivalent to\n        $2,724,795.96 calculated at the exchange rate of 1 KWD @ U.S. $3.571,\n        for a grand total of $2,830,662.20 in damages plus prejudgment interest\n        under the Contract Dispute [sic] Act, 41 U.S.C. §611, the specific sum of\n        which will be proven at the time of trial.150\n\n(emphasis in original) (internal citations omitted). Plaintiff further alleges that “[o]n May\n21, 2007 the Contracting Officer Joe L. Libbey of the U.S. Army Contracting Agency for\nSouthwest Asia - Kuwait issued a final decision in which it granted in part and denied in\npart Gulf Group’s claim for damages, awarding compensation in the amount of\n$149,285.71 plus interest. Gulf Group disputes the computation of the award made by\nthe Contracting Officer seeks additional compensation be awarded by this Court for its\ndamages that were denied all as it will be shown at the time of trial.” (emphasis in\noriginal) (internal citation omitted).\n\n        In plaintiff’s second amended complaint for the dumpster case, plaintiff alleges\nthat:\n\n        As a result of the Government’s arbitrary and wrongful termination of the\n        contract, Gulf Group is entitled to damages in the form of preparatory\n        expenses of KWD 79,213.585,151 equivalent to $282,871.71 calculated at\n        the exchange rate of 1 KWD @ U.S. $3.571, fees and costs incurred in\n        the preparation and presentation of a termination claim and settlement\n        proposal that was presented to the Contracting Officer in the sum of\n150\n    Plaintiff also alleges that, “[t]he Government’s termination of this [latrine] contract\nwas arbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion. Indeed, termination was in bad\nfaith inasmuch as the purported basis for termination was a supposed security risk\npresented by Gulf Group that was not documented prior to, at the time of or any time\nsubsequent to termination.” As indicated above, plaintiff has abandoned any allegations\nof bad faith.\n151\n   Plaintiff’s 2011 notice subsequently reduced the amount of costs plaintiff claimed to\nhave incurred to 59,927.871 KD.\n\n                                             162\n\f       $13,837.50, in addition to lost profits of KWD 135,346.518 equivalent to\n       $483,322.42 calculated at the exchange rate of 1 KWD @ U.S. $3.571, for\n       a grand total of $780,131.63 in damages plus prejudgment interest under\n       the Contract Dispute [sic] Act, 41 U.S.C. §611, the specific sum of which\n       will be proven at the time of trial.152\n\n(internal citations omitted; emphasis in original). Plaintiff further alleges that “[o]n May\n21, 2007 the Contracting Officer Joe L. Libbey of the U.S. Army Contracting Agency for\nSouthwest Asia – Kuwait, issued a final decision in which he granted in part and denied\nin part Gulf Group’s claim for damages, awarding compensation in the amount of\n$57,833.00 plus interest. Gulf Group seeks additional compensation be awarded by this\nCourt for its damages that were denied all as it will be shown at the time of trial.”\n(emphasis in original) (internal citation omitted).\n\n      Proof that a contract terminated for convenience was an abuse of discretion\nrenders that contract breached. See Krygoski Constr. Co. v. United States, 94 F.3d at\n1541; see also NCLN20, Inc. v. United States, 99 Fed. Cl. at 758. Therefore, the Army\nbreached the latrine and dumpster contracts by improperly terminating them. The\nRestatement (Second) of Contracts provides, with respect to plaintiff’s burden to prove\ndamages:\n\n       A party cannot recover damages for breach of a contract for loss beyond\n       the amount that the evidence permits to be established with reasonable\n       certainty.... Courts have traditionally required greater certainty in the proof\n       of damages for a breach of a contract than in the proof of damages for a\n       tort. The requirement does not mean, however, that the injured party is\n       barred from recovery unless he establishes the total amount of his [or her]\n       loss. It merely excludes those elements of loss that cannot be proved with\n       reasonable certainty.\n\nRestatement (Second) of Contracts § 352 cmt. a (1981). Although there may be\nuncertainty “‘as to the extent of the damage,’” a court cannot avoid its obligation to\nprovide relief when there is no uncertainty “‘as to the fact of damage.’” See S.W.

In situations in which the plaintiff seeks to recover costs that have been\nincurred, the plaintiff must demonstrate with reasonable certainty that the costs are\nrecoverable. See Ariz. Pub. Serv.

However, such costs must be established according to the standards\nand burdens described in this Opinion. Plaintiff did not show to a degree of reasonable\ncertainty that those costs could be tied directly to its mitigation efforts.”).\n\n        Plaintiff’s citations to cases supporting that lost profits could have included the\noption periods rely on situations in which the wronged contractor can prove that the\ngovernment chose, in bad faith, not to exercise the option periods. See Hi-Shear Tech.\nCorp. v. United States, 356 F.3d at 1374, 1375, 1380; Blackstone Consulting, Inc. v.\nGen. Servs. Admin., CBCA 718, 08-1 BCA ¶ 33,770; Greenlee Constr., Inc. v. Gen.\nServs. Admin., CBCA 416, 07-1 BCA ¶ 33,514. As the court determined above,\nhowever, there is no evidence that, had the latrine and dumpster contracts not been\nterminated, the government would have exercised the option periods, or would have not\nexercised them in bad faith or as a result of an abuse of discretion. Given that the\nlatrine and dumpster contracts were terminated in the course of performance of the\nbase period, and that the government is not obligated to exercise an option that is not\notherwise restricted, plaintiff cannot claim entitlement to compensation for unexercised\noption periods. See Gov’t Sys. Advisors, Inc. v. United States, 847 F.2d at 813 (“An\noption is normally an option, and nothing in [the provision at issue], or in any other\ncontract clause, limited the circumstances under which the government could decline to\nexercise that bargained-for right in this case.”).          In Marketing & Management\nInformation, Inc. v. United States, the plaintiff argued that it was entitled to damages\nrelating to two, one-year option periods because, according to the plaintiff, it was\nforeseeable that the options would have been exercised had the underlying contract not\nbeen breached. See Mktg. & Mgmt. Info., Inc. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed. Cl.</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 130\n(2004). Noting that, “where a contract is renewable solely at the option of the\ngovernment, the government is under no obligation to exercise the option,” the court\nconcluded that “breach damages for the two option years would be inherently\nspeculative.” See id. (citing Gov’t Sys. Advisors, Inc. v. United States, 847 F.2d at 813).\n\n\n                                            164\n\fThe court reasoned that an award of damages for lost profits relating to two option\nyears that the government was free to exercise would put the plaintiff in a better position\nthan had the breach never occurred. See Mktg. & Mgmt. Info., Inc. v. United States, 62\nFed. Cl. at 131. Although a claim that the government failed to exercise an option in\nbad faith, or as the result of an abuse of discretion, may entitle a plaintiff to relief, the\nabuse of discretion in the latrine and dumpster cases is linked to the underlying\ncontracts at issue, not the government’s option to extend those contracts. In\ncircumstances where the government breaches an underlying contract, especially when\nthe breach occurs early in the performance of the contract, an abuse of discretion giving\nrise to that breach generally only entitles a plaintiff to damages relating to the base year\nof the contract.

As noted above, plaintiff has\nsought various amounts for recovery on the latrine and dumpster contract claims. In its\n2005 Claim and Settlement Offer to Mr. Cockerham for the latrine contract, plaintiff\nclaimed entitlement to $5,058,428.59, and submitted a “settlement offer of\n$4,558,428.60.” In its 2007 certified claim for the latrine contract, plaintiff claimed\n$6,000,000.00. Likewise in its original complaint in Case No. 06-858C, the latrine case,\nplaintiff sought $6,000,000.00. In its first amended complaint in the latrine case, plaintiff\nsought 1,572,967.611 KD.153 In its second amended complaint in the latrine case,\nplaintiff now seeks $2,830,662.20.154 In its 2005 Claim and Settlement Offer to Mr.\nCockerham for the dumpster contract, plaintiff claimed entitlement to $1,110,621.72,\nand submitted a “settlement offer of $999,994.67.” In its 2007 certified claim for the\ndumpster contract, plaintiff claimed $1,800,000.00. In its original complaint in Case No.\n06-853C, the dumpster case, plaintiff also sought $1,800,000.00. In its first amended\ncomplaint in the dumpster case, plaintiff sought $1,946,721.78.155 In its second\namended complaint in the dumpster case, plaintiff now seeks $780,031.63.156\n153\n    Plaintiff sought 1,416,360.000 KD in lost profits, 156,607.611 KD in preparatory\nexpenses, legal fees, costs incurred in preparing a settlement of plaintiff’s claims, and\ninterest. Plaintiff did not convert the amounts to USD.\n154\n      Plaintiff now seeks $2,724,795.96 in lost profits, $91,978.74 in preparatory\nexpenses, $13,887.50 in fees and other costs, plus prejudgment interest, costs of\nlitigation and attorneys’ fees.\n155\n   Plaintiff sought $1,457,619.72 in lost profits, $489,102.06 in preparatory expenses,\nlegal fees, costs incurred in preparing the settlement of the claims, and interest.\n156\n   Plaintiff asserts in its second amended complaint in the dumpster case that it seeks\n$780,131.63, but the total of the various amounts listed by plaintiff is only $780,031.63.\n\n                                            165\n\f         As indicated above, the majority of the testimony at trial addressed the award of\nthe contracts, the alleged security incident, the hiring of Ms. Blake, Saud Al Tawash’s\nrelationship with Mr. Cockerham, and the inflated claims. Little testimony at trial\nspecifically addressed the denied elements of Gulf Group’s 2007 latrine contract and\ndumpster contract claims before Mr. Libbey. Moreover, plaintiff’s exhibits at trial on the\ncosts Gulf Group incurred in performing the latrine contract for a brief period of time\nincluded only a handful of unclear charts, spreadsheets, and a handful of invoices or\nrecords. In addition, only a small number of the joint exhibits offer any support for the\nspecific claims after the contracting officer’s final decision on the latrine contract claim.\nThe most specific information is included in the 2011 notice for the latrine case, in which\nplaintiff indicates: “Pursuant to the Court’s Order dated December 9, 2010, Gulf Group\nGeneral Enterprises, Co. W.L.L. hereby submits its revised claim together with\nsupporting documents and an explanation of the reasons for the revisions.” The 2011\nnotice for the latrine claim, included as a joint exhibit at trial, included a chart similar to\nthe one included for the 2011 notice for the camp package BPA claim. The chart for the\nlatrine contract claim listed thirty-three individual claims, reducing the revised amount\nfor thirteen claims, removing eight individual claims, listing no change for nine individual\nclaims, and submitting three entirely new claims. Plaintiff included the identical forms,\npurchase orders, checks, and invoices included in the original 2005 Claim and\nSettlement Offer to Mr. Cockerham with the 2011 notice.\n\n        Plaintiff also did not identify the differences in its costs in the 2011 notice for the\nlatrine claim and the second amended complaint on the latrine contract from the\namounts awarded by Mr. Libbey in his May 21, 2007 contracting officer’s final decision.\nIn his contracting officer’s final decision on the latrine contract claim, Mr. Libbey wrote:\n\n       I determine Gulf Group is entitled to one month of contract performance.\n       Actual performance was less than one month, but I believe Gulf Group\n       incurred costs on at least a monthly basis; therefore, a full month of\n       contract performance represents the percentage of the contract performed\n       before contract termination. Gulf Group is entitled to $149,285.71, for one\n       month’s performance plus interest. I believe this [sic] a fair and\n       reasonable settlement.\n\nIn a footnote, Mr. Libbey stated: “This amount is one month of service for 400 latrines as\nproposed by Gulf Group and is not the erroneous amount noted in footnote 1 above.”\nMr. Libbey appears to have misinterpreted the price of the contract by not relying on the\nprice as it appears in the contract in reaching his decision on the latrine contract.\nPlaintiff did not make an effort to segregate what, according to Mr. Libbey, would have\nbeen covered by one month’s worth of performance, $149,285.71, instead claiming\n\n\n\nPlaintiff seeks $483,322.42 in lost profits, $282,871.71 for preparatory expenses,\n$13,837.50 for fees and other costs, prejudgment interest, costs of litigation and\nattorneys’ fees.\n\n                                             166\n\f$91,978.736.157 Moreover, plaintiff did not draw a nexus between each of the revised\nclaim amounts and the supporting documentation attached to the claim.\n\n       The testimony at trial by Saud Al Tawash also did not specifically link any of the\nclaimed amounts to actual, documented expenditures by Gulf Group made in\nconnection with preparing to perform the latrine contract. For example, on cross\nexamination, regarding the purchase of latrines referred to in the 2011 second revised\nclaim, and included as supporting documentation attached to that claim, Saud Al\nTawash testified:\n\n      Q: This is the Joint Exhibit 85 which is the revised claim with regard to the\n      latrines which was filed with the court in January of this year?\n\n      A: Yes. sir.\n\n      Q: This reduces the amount of latrines purchased?\n\n      A: Yes, fir [sic]. From 600 to 400 latrines.\n\n      Q: Reducing the amount from the initial claim column from 52,000 dinars\n      to 37,000 dinars?\n\n      A: Reducing the preparatory expenses from the summary of the initial-\n      claim to this revision.\n\n      Q: On the second page, page 1878, you also reduced the –\n\n      A: The adjustment like air freight, custom duty, freight forwarding charges.\n      Based on a pro rata. They took the amount of the invoice of 600, they\n      prorated it on 400 and they submitted those bills in here, sir.\n\n      Q: At the bottom of this the amount is reduced from – There’s mitigation\n      again?\n\n      A: Yes. We were able to sell a lot of these latrines, not all of them, we still\n      have some stuck in Kuwait, but we sold a lot of them and we almost got\n      the full value, remarkably, from the sale of them. And this, I think if I add it\n      up I think we got close to 78,000 KD. That’s quarter million dollars worth\n      of mitigation efforts. We put ads in paper and sold them. These latrines\n      are very hard to sell in Kuwait because they’re spec’d out for military in\n      that region of the world. We had issues trying to sell them, but we were\n      lucky that we have been able to get this in the mitigation effort.\n\n\n\n157\n   Plaintiff’s 2011 notice for the latrine claim rounded to three decimal places in\nconverting between Kuwaiti dinars and United States dollars.\n\n                                            167\n\f       This testimony was representative of Saud Al Tawash’s testimony on the specific\nclaims on the latrine contract. As noted above, Saud Al Tawash was able to note the\ndifference in the amount of certain items from the original claims and the 2011 notices,\nbut was not able to offer support for the costs alleged. Instead, the testimony was often\na recitation of the items listed in the 2011 notice for the latrine claim, rather than a\nsubstantiation of the supporting documents. Moreover, a large portion of Saud Al\nTawash’s testimony regarding the specific claims on the latrine and dumpster contracts\nwas driven by explaining why Gulf Group, Saud Al Tawash as the General Manager of\nGulf Group, and Gulf Group’s attorneys submitted the particular claims filed and\ncomplaints filed.\n\n        Like the camp package BPA claim, however, defendant appears to have\nconceded that plaintiff incurred all of the costs that plaintiff identified in its 2011 notice in\nits performance for the latrine contract. Defendant stipulated that “Gulf Group\npurchased a total of 600 latrines, 400 of which were for use in the performance of\nContract No. W912-D1-04-P-0932.” Defendant also stated in post-trial brief that Gulf\nGroup actually incurred costs in the amount of 94,047.000 KD in its performance of the\nlatrine contract, which was well above the 25,757.137 KD that plaintiff claimed to have\nincurred in its 2011 notice. Defendant apparently treated the approximate costs that\nplaintiff deducted as a result of its mitigation efforts as costs that plaintiff incurred in its\nperformance of the contract. Defendant also did not demonstrate that plaintiff failed to\nadequately mitigate its costs. See Koby v.

Defendant’s failure to rebut plaintiff’s claims with respect to the costs plaintiff\nincurred in its performance of the latrine contract is problematic.\n\n        Similarly, because little testimony at trial specifically addressed the denied\nelements of Gulf Group’s 2007 dumpster claim, and because plaintiff’s trial exhibits on\nthe costs it incurred in performing the dumpster contract for a brief period of time\nincluded only a small number of unclear charts, spreadsheets, and a handful of invoices\nor records, and only one or two of the joint exhibits offer any support for the specific\nclaims after the contracting officer’s final decision on the dumpster contract claim, the\nmost specific, relevant information may come from the 2011 notice on the dumpster\nclaim. In the 2011 notice of filing of revised claims, plaintiff indicates: “Gulf Group\nGeneral Enterprises, Co. W.L.L. hereby submits its revised claim together with\nsupporting documents and an explanation of the reasons for the revisions.” The 2011\nnotice for the dumpster contract, included as a joint exhibit at trial, contained a chart\nsimilar to the 2011 notices for the camp package BPA and latrine claims. The chart for\nthe dumpster claim listed nineteen individual claims, removing one claim, reducing the\nrevised amount for five claims, listing no change for four individual claims, and\nsubmitting nine entirely new individual claims. Plaintiff included the identical forms,\npurchase orders, checks, and invoices included in the original 2005 Claim and\nSettlement Offer to Mr. Cockerham with the 2011 notice.158 Plaintiff also did not identify\nthe differences in its costs in the 2011 notice and the second amended complaint for the\n158\n   Plaintiff’s 2011 notice also included summaries of payments to various employees\nnot included in the original claim.\n\n                                              168\n\fdumpster contract from the amounts awarded by Mr. Libbey in its May 21, 2007\ncontracting officer’s final decision.\n\n      In his contracting officer’s final decision on the dumpster contract claims, Mr.\nLibbey wrote:\n\n      I determine Gulf Group is entitled to one month of contract performance.\n      Actual performance was less than one month, but I believe Gulf Group\n      incurred costs on at least a monthly basis; therefore, a full month of\n      contract performance represents the percentage of the contract performed\n      before contract termination. Gulf Group is entitled to $57,833.00, for one\n      month’s performance plus interest. I believe this [sic] a fair and\n      reasonable settlement.\n\nPlaintiff did not make an effort to segregate what, according to Mr. Libbey, would have\nbeen covered by one month’s worth of performance, the $57,833.00, instead claiming\n$214,002.427.159 Moreover, as with the latrine contract claim, plaintiff was unable to\ndraw a nexus between each of the revised claim amounts and the supporting\ndocumentation attached to the claim. Testimony at trial by Saud Al Tawash also did not\nspecifically link any of the claimed amounts to actual, documented expenditures by Gulf\nGroup. For example, on direct examination regarding the purchase of compactors\nreferred to in the 2011 notice, and included as supporting documentation attached to\nthat notice, Saud Al Tawash testified:\n\n      Q: What is this document that we see on page 1116 [an exhibit attached\n      to plaintiff’s 2011 notice on the dumpster contract claim]?\n\n      A: This is the company that does the steel fabrications called Malika\n      Factory Steel Works. They manufacture dumpsters, and they’re what we\n      call in the industry body builder.\n\n      Q: Okay. And are they invoicing you for any particular equipment,\n      service? What is this for?\n\n      A: Yeah, this is the garbage compactor maintenance. The referred the\n      hydraulics, change hoses oil seals, jacks. This is just an invoice for the\n      garbage compactor to be installed on the trucks.\n\n      Q: And was this a used compactor or a new compactor? Why did it need\n      service?\n\n      A: Because we bought used compactors. They’re international trucks, and\n      they were the type of trucks that were approved to be used for this\n\n159\n    Plaintiff’s 2011 notice for the dumpster contract claim rounded to three decimal\nplaces in converting between Kuwaiti dinars and United States dollars.\n\n                                         169\n\f       contract. They’re American trucks, and they had American compactors\n       manufactured by Hill Industries.\n\nThis was the sum-total of the testimony on the compactors by Saud Al Tawash, who\noffered the most in-depth testimony on the specific dumpster claims. For the next item\non the 2011 notice, the red 20-cubic meter dumpsters, the entirety of Saud Al Tawash’s\ntestimony was:\n\n       Q: All right, so turn to the next page 1118 [an exhibit attached to plaintiff’s\n       2011 notice on the dumpster contract claim]. If you can tell us, what is\n       this?\n\n       A: This is an invoice for the 20-cubic meter dumpsters painted in red\n       which is the Gulf Group identity. Every contractor had a different color like\n       some of them are blue. Some of the other contractors have yellow. Our\n       color was red for Gulf Group, and the Malika that has manufactured the\n       dumpsters for us and painted them in the red color. And the first line item\n       is for the dumpsters. The second line item is for six-cubic meter\n       dumpsters, 230. And the third line item is the hooks for the trucks for roll\n       on, roll off. These are the mechanical mechanism that we installed on the\n       chassis truck to haul away the 20-cubic meter dumpster.\n\n       Q: And is this an invoice for the purchase of these items that Gulf Group\n       made?\n\n       A: Yes ma’am.\n\n       Q: All right.\n\n        As with the camp package BPA claim and the latrine claim, however, the\ngovernment appears to have conceded that plaintiff incurred all of the costs that plaintiff\nidentified in its 2011 notice regarding its performance of the dumpster contract.\nDefendant stipulated, for example, that “Gulf Group paid Abdul Hameed Salem (‘AHS’)\n12,000 kd for the service to the 6cm dumpsters and 990 kd for the service to the 20 cm\ndumpsters by its subcontractor in the performance of Contract No. W912DI-04-P-0897.”\nDefendant also stated in its post-trial brief that Gulf Group actually incurred costs in the\namount of 80,467.871 KD in its performance of the dumpster contract, which was well\nabove the 59,927.871 KD that plaintiff claimed to have incurred in its 2011 notice.\nDefendant apparently treated 68,910.000 KD of costs that plaintiff deducted as a result\nof its mitigation efforts as costs that plaintiff incurred in its performance of the contract.\nDefendant also did not demonstrate that plaintiff failed to adequately mitigate its costs.\nSee Koby v. United States, 53 Fed. Cl. at 497 (citations omitted).\n\n       In contrast to Gulf Group’s minimal effort to prove the amount of costs it incurred\nin performance of the latrine and dumpster contracts, Gulf Group has presented the\ncourt with a more understandable and complete explanation of its lost profits claims with\n\n\n                                            170\n\frespect to the latrine and dumpster contracts.

Co. v. United States, 94 F.3d at 1541, which\namounts to a breach of contract, may entitle a plaintiff to expectancy damages. Id. at\n1545. In support of its claims for lost profits, plaintiff offered the testimony of Terry\nCarlson, qualified as an expert in government contract accounting, with experience\nworking for the Defense Contract Audit Agency, as well as for private companies. Mr.\nCarlson testified that he had reviewed a spreadsheet prepared by Gulf Group’s\naccounting department, which delineated the amount Gulf Group was to receive under\nthe latrine and dumpster contracts, line items for each cost that Gulf Group expected to\nincur in performing the latrine and dumpster contracts, as well as Gulf Group’s expected\nprofit over the base periods and each option period for the latrine and dumpster\ncontracts. Mr. Carlson also reviewed the latrine and dumpster contracts, schedules\nprepared by Gulf Group, depositions that were taken in the above-captioned cases, Gulf\nGroup’s claims to the contracting officer, as well as its complaints, and the contracting\nofficer’s findings with respect to the termination of the latrine and dumpster contracts.\nPlaintiff’s expert testified that he suggested changes to Gulf Group’s lost profits\ncalculation, including the correction of errors in plaintiff’s initial calculation of its\nexpenses. In helping plaintiff to revise its initial calculation of lost profits, plaintiff’s\nexpert testified that he also reviewed available documentation of projected expenses.\nMr. Carlson testified that he accounted for deficiencies in plaintiff’s accounting system\nby individually reviewing invoices in support of each cost listed by plaintiff. Plaintiff’s\nexpert also testified that plaintiff had properly calculated the depreciation of plaintiff’s\nassets. Although plaintiff’s expert testified that business practices in Kuwait prevented\nhim from calculating depreciation in a traditional manner, he counseled plaintiff and\nSaud Al Tawash on calculating depreciation of assets based on “a reasonable useful\nlife” of the assets at issue. After reviewing plaintiff’s documentation, and accounting for\ndeficiencies in plaintiff’s accounting system, plaintiff’s expert testified that he was\nreasonably certain that plaintiff’s final lost profits calculation was accurate. Plaintiff’s\nexpert ultimately concluded that the spreadsheet prepared by Gulf Group reflected “the\ndifference between the revenue that they expected and the expected costs to perform,”\n\n\n                                            172\n\fwhich amounted to “the profit that they would have incurred had they been allowed to\nperform the contract as they had planned.”160\n\n        On cross-examination, defendant primarily highlighted that Mr. Carlson had relied\non discussions with Saud Al Tawash and an individual from Gulf Group’s accounting\ndepartment to determine a reasonable approximation for the useful life of Gulf Group’s\nassets, that plaintiff’s expert mostly reviewed invoices, rather than cancelled checks to\ndetermine plaintiff’s projected costs, and plaintiff’s asserted entitlement to compensation\nrelating to option periods not exercised by the government. Although defendant had\nindicated to the court that it intended to call a certified public accountant in response to\nplaintiff’s expert, after hearing the testimony presented by plaintiff’s expert, Mr. Carlson,\ndefendant informed the court that it did not “need” to present expert testimony related to\nplaintiff’s lost profits calculation.\n\n        As indicated above, the court disagrees with plaintiff’s expert, Mr. Carlson, that\nplaintiff is entitled to lost profits for each unexercised option period, but plaintiff has\nestablished that defendant is liable for damages arising out of its breach of contract\nduring the base period of the latrine and dumpster contracts. See Krygoski Constr. Co.\nv. United States, 94 F.3d at 1541, 1545. “In cases where the responsibility for damage\nis clear…‘it is enough if the evidence adduced is sufficient to enable a court or jury to\nmake a fair and reasonable approximation.’” See Hughes Commc’ns Galaxy, Inc. v.\nUnited States, 47 Fed. Cl. at 239 (quoting S.W. Elecs. & Mfg. Corp. v. United States,\n228 Ct. Cl. at 351, 655 F.2d at 1088 (citation omitted)). Plaintiff calculated its lost profits\ndirectly from the subject matter of the contract, which plaintiff presumably entered into\nfor the purpose of making a profit, establishing a link between plaintiff’s losses and\ndefendant’s breach, and indicating that it was foreseeable that lost profits would be a\nprobable result of defendant’s breach. See Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"721429\"><a href=\"/opinion/721429/wells-fargo-bank-na-plaintiffcross-appellant-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1012</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1023 (Fed.

Moreover, the testimony of plaintiff’s expert and his\nsupporting documentation, as well as plaintiff’s documentation of costs, indicate that the\nfinal calculation of lost profits that plaintiff presented to the court constitutes a projection\nof the “‘fair and reasonable approximation of the damages’” plaintiff suffered, which\nsatisfies the requirement that plaintiff prove its lost profits with reasonable certainty.\nSee Energy Capital Corp. v. United States, 302 F.3d at 1329 (quoting Locke v. United\nStates, 141 Ct. Cl. at 267–68, 283 F.2d at 524).\n\n160\n    The spreadsheet prepared by Gulf Group inaccurately indicates that the base period\nof the latrine contract was from September 2, 2004 to January 1, 2005. The base\nperiod of the latrine contract, which was awarded on September 28, 2004, actually was\nfrom September 28, 2004 to January 21, 2005. Mr. Carlson confirmed at trial that the\nlost profits associated with the inaccurate time period reflected in the spreadsheet\nprepared by Gulf Group correspond to the base period of the latrine contract.\nDefendant did not challenge the inaccurate time period listed in the spreadsheet and the\ntime periods listed in plaintiff’s calculation of lost profits for the latrine contract. The\nspreadsheet accurately reflects the base period of the dumpster contract and the period\nof performance for the camp package BPA call for Camp Buehring.\n\n                                             173\n\f       Although plaintiff claims lost profits for both the latrine and dumpster contracts,\nand the evidence plaintiff presented allows the court to make a fair and reasonable\napproximation of the plaintiff’s profit and losses, the evidence before the court indicates\nthat plaintiff would have made a profit on the dumpster contract only if defendant had\nexercised the option periods to the dumpster contract. The testimony of plaintiff’s\nexpert and supporting documentation indicate that plaintiff would have obtained profits\nduring the base period of the latrine contract, but that plaintiff would have suffered a\nloss during the base period of the dumpster contract. Plaintiff, therefore, is entitled to\nlost profits as a result of defendant’s termination of the latrine contract only in the\namount of 92,443.724 KD, which is the amount endorsed by plaintiff’s expert, Mr.\nCarlson, as well as interest on that amount.\n\n        That plaintiff would not have made a profit on the dumpster contract, however,\ndoes not preclude plaintiff from recovering the costs it incurred in preparing to perform\nthe contract as a result of defendant’s breach. A measure of damages that allows a\nnon-breaching party to incur the full amount of costs incurred in preparing to perform a\ncontract “‘rests on the premise that the injured party’s reliance interest is no greater than\nthe party’s expectation interest.’” See Bausch & Lomb Inc. v.

The court, therefore,\napplies the generally accepted principle of reducing plaintiff’s reliance damages\nresulting from defendant’s breach of contract by the value of the loss that plaintiff\nexpected to incur in performing the contract, entitling plaintiff to 47,881.664 KD, plus\ninterest.162\n\n        Although plaintiff seeks lost profits in addition to preparatory expenses, plaintiff\nhas not demonstrated that it is entitled to costs in addition to lost profits on its latrine\ncontract claims. Plaintiff cites United States v. Behan for the proposition that it can\nrecover costs it incurred in performing the latrine and dumpster contracts, as well as lost\nprofits. See United States v. Behan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91040\"><a href=\"/opinion/91040/united-states-v-behan/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">338</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1884). In United States v. Behan,\nthe United States Supreme Court stated while discussing lost profits that “it would seem\nto be quite clear that the claimant ought at least to be made whole for his [or her] losses\nand expenditures.” See id. at 344. Even Gulf Group recognizes, however, the plaintiff\nin United States v. Behan failed to prove entitlement to lost profits, and therefore,\npursued its costs as an alternative measure of damages. See id. at 342–43. The\nSupreme Court recognized that “losses...may consist of two heads of classes of\ndamage—actual outlay and anticipated profits.” Id. at 345. The Supreme Court also\nrecognized, however, that these classes of damages are generally pursued in the\nalternative. See id. If a plaintiff chooses to pursue lost profits, then the ordinary rule of\ndamages being measured by “‘the difference between the cost of doing the work and\nwhat he has to receive for it’” applies. Id. The Supreme Court’s holding in United\nStates v. Behan, therefore, applied the established principle that recovery of a form of\nexpectancy damages generally precludes recovery of reliance damages. See\nRestatement (Second) Contracts § 349 (noting that “[a]s an alternative” to expectation\ndamages, “the injured party has a right to damages based on his reliance interest,\nincluding expenditures made in preparation for performance or in performance, less any\nloss that the party in breach can prove with reasonable certainty the injured party would\nhave suffered had the contract been performed.”); see also Stovall v. United States, 94\n\ncontract been fully performed is “unrelated to putting the plaintiff back in the position he\nor she would have occupied if the contract had not been made.” See Westfed Holdings,\nInc. v. United States, 52 Fed. Cl. at 155 (citing L. Albert & Son v. Armstrong Rubber\nCo., 178 F.2d at 189); Christopher T. Wonnell, 38 San Diego L. Rev. 53, 114 (2001),\nExpectation, Reliance, and the Two Contractual Wrongs (noting that the reduction of a\nnon-breaching party’s expected loss in performing a contract from the expenditures that\nthe non-breaching party made in preparing to perform the contract is a “hybrid remedy\nof ‘reliance limited by expectation’ which seems to be justifiable neither by reliance nor\nexpectation theory.”).\n162\n    The court would likely reach the same result if it were to determine Gulf Group’s\nrecovery arose from defendant’s termination of the dumpster contract for convenience,\nrather than from defendant’s breach of the dumpster contract. The FAR permits Gulf\nGroup to recover expenses it incurred in preparing to perform the dumpster contract.\nSee 48 C.F.R. § 52.249–2(g)(2)(i) (2005). The FAR also accounts for losses, see, e.g.,\n48 C.F.R. § 49.203 (2005), and recovery in such situations is a form of reliance\ndamages. See Hi-Shear Tech. Corp. v. United States, 356 F.3d at 1383.\n\n                                            </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span>\n\f<span class=\"reporter\">Fed.

Plaintiff\nis precluded from recovering expenditures that would likely factor into the calculation of\nplaintiff’s lost profits. In addition, as indicated above with respect to Gulf Group’s claim\nfor attorneys’ fees in connection with defendant’s termination of the camp package BPA,\nplaintiff is similarly precluded from recovering costs incurred in preparation of its 2005\nClaim and Settlement Offers for the latrine and dumpster contracts because the 2005\nsubmissions to the contracting officer were without factual or legal basis.\n\n       In sum, the court finds that defendant breached both plaintiff’s latrine contract\nand dumpster contract in terminating both contracts without establishing a legitimate\nbasis for doing so. The court finds that plaintiff is entitled to lost profits as a result of\ndefendant’s breach of the latrine contract, in the amount of 92,443.724 KD, plus\ninterest. In addition, due to defendant’s concession that plaintiff incurred costs in\npreparing to perform the dumpster contract, plaintiff is entitled to the amount claimed in\nits 2011 notice in the dumpster claim, less the loss that plaintiff expected to incur in\nperforming the base period of the contract, or 47,881.664 KD, plus interest.\n\nIV.    The Bottled Water BPA Demurrage Claim\n\n       On September 28, 2004, Maj. Davis awarded the bottled water BPA to Gulf\nGroup for the provision of bottled water to the Army. Although Mr. Cockerham was the\ncontract specialist, he was not a warranted contracting officer at the time the bottled\nwater BPA was awarded. He also was not a member of the Contract Review Board that\nreviewed the offers for the bottled water BPA. Nonetheless, Mr. Cockerham is listed as\nthe contracting officer in the Contract Review Board Memorandum. The base period of\nperformance for the bottled water BPA was September 28, 2004 through September 28,\n2006. The bottled water BPA called for the supply and delivery of bottled water to\nlocations in Kuwait and Iraq. The BPA master dollar limit on the contract was\n$10,000,000.00, and the BPA call limit was $7,000,000.00.\n\n        Modification P00001 to the bottled water BPA, signed on December 20, 2005 by\nMr. Cockerham, deleted the original $10,000,000.00 BPA limit and extended the period\nof performance end date from September 28, 2006 to September 7, 2008. The final\nbottled water BPA call in the record is call No. 0011, dated July 31, 2005. The period of\nperformance for call No. 0011 was July 31, 2005 to September 2005. The parties\nstipulated that the Army made nine payments to Gulf Group under nine different BPA\ncalls, the final payment pursuant to call No. 0011. The parties also have stipulated that\nthe nine payments totaled 2,762,543.767 KD, or $9,865,043.79, using a 1.000 KD to\n3.571 USD conversion rate. Each BPA call and call modification included in the Joint\nExhibits provides for a delivery time. For example, call No. 0002 had calls for\n“approximately 40,920 cases per week for 4 weeks,” and call No. 00202 had calls for\n“approximately 18,750 cases per week for 4 weeks.”\n\n\n                                            176\n\f        In its second amended complaint in the bottled water BPA case, plaintiff refers to\nthe following language incorporated by reference into the bottled water BPA: “The\nGovernment shall not be liable for any delivery, storage, demurrage, accessorial, or\nother charges involved before the actual delivery (or ‘constructive placement’ as defined\nin carrier tariffs) of the supplies to the destination, unless such charges are caused by\nan act or order of the Government acting in its contractual capacity.” Plaintiff claims that\nthis language renders the “Government liable for reimbursement of extra expenses\nincurred for delays when the delay is attributable or caused by an act or order of the\nGovernment in its contractual capacity.”\n\n      Plaintiff also alleges that, under § 205 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts:\n“Every contract imposes upon each party a duty of good faith and fair dealing in its\nperformance and its enforcement.” Plaintiff continues:\n\n       Accordingly, by virtue of its decision to delay the convoys and the return of\n       Gulf Group’s trucks, in accordance with the principle articulated in §205 of\n       the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, the Government is required to\n       compensate Gulf Group fully and place Gulf Group in the same position it\n       would have been, had there been no delays by the convoys, including\n       reimbursement for the demurrage incurred by Gulf Group which is the\n       subject of this litigation, plus interest.\n\n       Plaintiff’s second amended complaint in the bottled water BPA case, Case No.\n07-82C, further alleges “[t]he delays experienced by the Army convoys for Gulf Group’s\ntrucks were not attributable to Gulf Group but were entirely attributable to the U.S.\nGovernment.” In the joint stipulation of facts, however, the parties agree that some of\nthe delays were caused by religious holidays and IEDs, in addition to those that may\nhave been caused by the government. The parties, however, do not agree on the\ncause of all the delay claims filed by plaintiff or as to which delays should have been\nanticipated by plaintiff under the terms of the contract.\n\n       The parties stipulated that:\n\n       The convoy requirement was necessary for security purposes, i.e., to\n       protect people and supplies because of hostilities in Iraq which resulted in\n       people being killed or injured and supplies and equipment being lost. The\n       convoy was also necessary to ensure the actual and prompt delivery of\n       supplies by Government contractors. Delivery trucks traveling in military\n       convoys were delayed at various times because of a variety of reasons\n       including improvised explosive devices and observance of religious\n       holidays by Iraqi nationals. Additionally, the delays occasionally were\n       caused by the Government not having sufficient escorts. There was no\n       agreement between Gulf Group and the Government to use some or all of\n       Gulf Group’s trucks that delivered bottled water to camps in Iraq, to\n       transport military equipment back to Kuwait on their return trips from Iraq.\n\n\n                                            177\n\f(emphasis in original; internal citations and stipulation numbers removed).\n\n      The bottled water BPA included the following “Special Instructions:”\n\n      Purchased For: US Army Various Locations in Kuwait and Iraq. Surface to\n      some of the locations are unimproved which could cause delays in\n      deliveries. Contractor shall do everything possible to ensure deliveries are\n      made on time.

The\n      Government shall not be liable for any delivery, storage, demurrage,\n      accessorial, or other charges involved before the actual delivery (or\n      “constructive placement” as defined in carrier tariffs) or the supplies to the\n      destination, unless such charges are caused by an act or order of the\n      Government acting in its contractual capacity. If rail carrier is used,\n      supplies shall be delivered to the specified unloading platform of the\n163\n   As noted above, according to the parties’ joint stipulation of facts, “Major Banks was\nthe chief of the bottled water branch until October 2004, when she was replaced by LTC\nDerrick Shoemake,” who was the chief of the bottled water branch at Camp Arifjan\nduring April 2005. Mr. Shoemake pled guilty in June 2011 to two counts of bribery, and\nwas subsequently sentenced to forty-one months in prison.\n164\n    As noted above, Capt. Sharp was Maj. Banks’ deputy at the time the “Special\nInstructions” were issued.\n\n                                           178\n\f       consignee.

If the contractor uses rail carrier or freight forwarder for less\n       than carload shipments, the contractor shall ensure that the carrier will\n       furnish tailgate delivery, when required, if transfer to truck is required to\n       complete delivery to consignee.\n\n48 C.F.R. § 52.247-34(a) (1991).\n\n        Defendant contends that the military convoy requirement was not contractual\nbecause the clause merely provided contact information for Army officers as to “whom a\ncontractor may contact for information.” According to Saud Al Tawash, the Army\nofficers Gulf Group contacted gave them convoy numbers, and he understood from the\nArmy officers’ direction that it was a requirement to travel in convoys.165 Megbel Al\nTawash also understood that there was a military convoy requirement and testified, in\nresponse to the question, “[a]nd how did you know that you [Gulf Group] were required\nto move in military convoys?” “Because I had spoken to Major, well he’s Lieutenant\nColonel now, Major Shoemake. He said it was the vitality of the water as a sent com166\nvia item it had to be escorted in, so nobody should tamper with it or, God knows you\nshouldn’t play with it, you know?” According to Megbel Al Tawash, Gulf Group obtained\nthe convoy information from Mr. Shoemake, Sgt. Mentor, or Sgt. Brooks via email or,\nmost often, by telephone. Megbel Al Tawash also stated that Gulf Group could not\nhave moved without convoys.\n\n       When asked, “[c]ould Gulf Group have gone into Iraq with the bottled water\ntrucks on its own without the military convoys?” Bobby Wilson, Gulf Group’s Project\nManager in Kuwait, similarly testified, “[n]o,” and in response to the question “[a]nd why\ndo you say that,” Mr. Wilson replied “Because water is a sensitive item. It’s a food item\nand that has to be under military control and at that time too, there were still a lot of the\nscare and whatnot over biological weapons, chemical warfare and whatnot and if you\nshowed up at a front gate of an army base unescorted with truck loads of water, you’re\nprobably going to be shot.” Mr. Wilson also stated that all of the bottled water\n165\n   Saud Al Tawash also testified, however, that he had traveled without a military escort\nfor another company, which managed the United States Program for Iraqi\nReconstruction in 2003-2004. It is not clear whether the alleged requirement to travel in\nconvoys had been imposed at that time and there is no indication that the merchandise\nwhich was being transported was water or food, for which there were additional security\nconcerns.\n166\n   The phrase “sent com” appears in the trial transcript, which is probably a reference\nto CENTCOM (United States Central Command).\n\n                                            179\n\fcontractors were told at a vendor meeting that they had to travel in military convoys.\nMr. Wilson testified that, although Gulf Group could have used private security, he\nwould not have done so without written approval from the Army. According to Mr.\nWilson, regulations posted on the wall at NAVSTAR, a border crossing at the Kuwait-\nIraq northern border, provided that “the trucks must stay in convoy, they must be\nescorted at all times and so on and so forth, I don’t remember exactly how it was\nworded but those rules and regulations and requirements were posted there on the\nbulletin board inside the movement controls office.” Mr. Wilson testified that the\nrequirements and rules were posted so everyone could read them.\n\n        Plaintiff has not alleged improper termination of any calls issued under the\nbottled water BPA. The only time period at issue in plaintiff’s bottled water BPA\ndemurrage claim is between November 1, 2004 and March 31, 2005, as indicated in\nplaintiff’s claim and second amended complaint. Defendant has not questioned the\ntimeframe claimed by plaintiff. In the claim submitted to Mr. Cockerham on December\n1, 2005, plaintiff stated: “This is an offer for settlement under FAR Part 49 with regard to\ncontract #912D1-04-A-0052 which is between US Army Contracting Command SWA-\nKuwait (‘Arcent’), and Gulf Group General Enterprises Co. W.L.L., (‘Gulf Enterprises’)\nawarded in 2004, with the period of performance being November 01, 2004, and March\n31, 2005.”\n\n        Plaintiff argues that its bottled water trucks were required to travel in convoys\npursuant to the bottled water BPA. The parties stipulated that “[b]etween November 1,\n2004 and March 31, 2005, all of Gulf Group’s deliveries of bottled water to camps in Iraq\nwere made by trucks traveling to and from Iraq and Kuwait with Army Convoys.”\nPlaintiff asserts that, as a result of the convoy requirement and insufficient military\nescorts, its bottled water trucks were delayed and, therefore, that the government\nshould be held liable for delay damages. Plaintiff also asserts that the government-\ncaused delays made its performance more onerous than it had expected, and that the\ndelays frustrated its expectations under the bottled water BPA. Plaintiff, therefore,\nseeks demurrage for the delays caused by the government.\n\n       According to plaintiff, “Gulf Group and its transportation contractor Expeditor’s\ntracked the delays of the trucks and determined that between November 2004 and\nMarch 2005 there were a total of 3511 days of delays,”167 which is an average of 702.2\ndays of delay per month. (internal citation and footnote omitted). Plaintiff has submitted\na Gantt chart,168 detailing how many days of delay each of its trucks incurred. The chart\nassumes that the trips were anticipated to take five days and demonstrates that the\n167\n   In its post-trial briefing, the defendant calculated that there were 3,513 demurrage\ndays.\n168\n   Saud Al Tawash described plaintiff’s Gantt chart as “basically data derived from the\noperation. And what we do with this data, this is a document that we and Expeditors\nwork on to make sure that there is no, that the actual data that’s shared between the\ntwo offices are correct and accurate and we need to analyze them so that we can\nproblem solve.”\n\n                                            180\n\fdelay days were incurred in three hundred seventy-four trips, with an average of 9.387\ndays of delay per trip.169 The chart was included in plaintiff’s claim for demurrage\nsubmitted to Mr. Cockerham at Camp Arifjan as an appendix, and labeled: “Gant [sic]\nChart with Tables.” Plaintiff insists that the trial testimony offered by Megbel Al Tawash\nand Mr. Wilson establishes that there were delays attributable to delivering the bottled\nwater and attributable to the return trips, as the result of transporting United States\ngovernment property on return trips. Plaintiff indicates that five “free” days comprise the\nstandard round-trip trucking distance pre-delays, and that these days are not included in\nthe delay days shown on plaintiff’s Gantt chart.\n\n        Defendant argues both that the bottled water BPA did not require contractors to\ntravel in military convoys and that the requirement to travel in military convoys applied to\nall contractors, and even to the movement of military equipment on military trucks which\ntransported food (which included water), fuel, ammunition, maintenance parts, and\nmilitary equipment such as tents and generators. In a post-trial brief, defendant\nattempted to explain why Gulf Group only should be awarded demurrage, if at all, for\ndelays on the return trips, and that the return trip delays estimated on plaintiff’s Gantt\nchart should be reduced by the five “free” days allowed by Expeditors before demurrage\nwas to be charged.\n\n         As noted above, the parties stipulated that the convoy requirement was issued\nfor security purposes to protect people and secure the safety of supplies during\nhostilities in Iraq, and to ensure the prompt delivery of bottled water. The parties also\nstipulated that some delays were caused by IEDs, observance of religious holidays by\nIraqi nationals, and by the government not having sufficient escorts. In a footnote to a\npost-trial brief, however, plaintiff argues that the stipulation merely refers to general\nconvoy delays, not necessarily to delays relative to the bottled water convoys. Plaintiff\nargues that the government breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing in delaying\nplaintiff’s delivery of bottled water, and that, because of the breach, the government is\nresponsible for demurrage expenses.\n\n       In general, “[e]very contract, as an aspect of the duty of good faith and fair\ndealing, imposes an implied obligation ‘that neither party will do anything that will hinder\nor delay the other party in performance of the contract.’” Essex Electro Eng’rs, Inc. v.\nDanzig, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770228\"><a href=\"/opinion/770228/essex-electro-engineers-incappellant-v-richard-j-danzig-secretary-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1283</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1291 (Fed.

Moreover, defendant argues,\nthe requirement that trucks move in military protected convoys was imposed by Multi-\nNational Force Iraq,171 not by Army Contracting Command. Consequently, according to\ndefendant, the convoy requirement was a sovereign act, and any effects upon Gulf\nGroup from the convoy requirement do not give rise to government liability. Defendant\npoints to the trial testimony of Lt. Col. Mary O’Connor, who, as noted above, was a\nbattalion commander and chief of transportation at Balad Air Base in Iraq between\nOctober 2004 and November 2005. Lt. Col. O’Connor testified that she was responsible\nfor setting up convoys in Iraq, and that the number of military escorts available was a\ndecision made by the President of the United States. Defendant also argues that “any\ndelays that follows [sic] from that, [the requirement to travel in convoys] that any delays\nthat were experienced on the return trip also are precluded because, once the water is\ndelivered in Iraq, performance is complete and there’s no reason that the government\nshould be responsible for any delays on the return.” Therefore, defendant argues, “[t]he\nGovernment is not responsible for any costs arising from bottled water trucks being\nrequired to travel in military-protected convoys, because that requirement was a\nsovereign act.”\n\n\n\n170\n   In the court’s February 23, 2010 Order, the court denied defendant’s motion for\nsummary judgment on the issue of the Sovereign Acts Doctrine before trial for “failure of\nproof in the record.”\n171\n  At the time of the convoys, Multi-National Force Iraq was the headquarters for all the\nArmy units in Iraq.\n\n                                            182\n\f       Defendant claims that under the bottled water BPA, Gulf Group assumed\nresponsibility for delivery of any merchandise. As indicated above, 48 C.F.R. § 52.247-\n34, “F.o.b. Destination,” was incorporated into Gulf Group’s bottled water BPA, and\nstates, “[t]he Government shall not be liable for any delivery, storage, demurrage,\naccessorial, or other charges involved before the actual delivery (or ‘constructive\nplacement’ as defined in carrier tariffs) or the supplies to the destination, unless such\ncharges are caused by an act or order of the Government acting in its contractual\ncapacity.”172 At the same time, defendant argues, perhaps in the alternative, that the\ncontract clause, which plaintiff cites, titled “Special Instructions,” simply provided contact\ninformation for Army officers for “directions and acess [sic] to various locations,” and\nstated, “the contractor is liable for all equipment and personnel necessary to deliver the\nproper quantities.” Therefore, defendant states, “[a]ny effects upon contract rights were\nincidental to the achievement of the broader governmental objective, related to national\nsecurity, of protecting convoy movements in Iraq.”\n\n        Plaintiff insists that the Sovereign Acts Doctrine does not apply because the\norders issued by the Army were not “public and general,” but rather “limited and\nspecific, and tailored especially to vital commodities like water, food and ammunition.”\nPlaintiff argues that the specific FRAGO introduced into the record, and discussed\nbelow, is advisory in nature and did not require all contractors to travel in convoys.\nSpecifically, plaintiff maintains that “[t]he Government...has not produced sufficient\ncredible evidence in support [of the Sovereign Acts Doctrine], failing inclusive to\nproduce the alleged written order that the Government claims was issued requiring that\neverything and everyone moving in Iraq must follow the military convoys.” Plaintiff\nviews the convoy requirement as arising out of the “Special Instructions” provision of the\nbottled water BPA. As a result, plaintiff argues that the convoy requirement cannot be\nconsidered a “sovereign act” because it had the substantial effect of hindering plaintiff’s\nperformance, which released the government from its obligation to follow the covenant\nof good faith and fair dealing implied in the parties’ contract. Plaintiff also highlights that\nthe government obtained an economic advantage from the convoy requirement\nbecause defendant used plaintiff’s bottled water trucks to transport military equipment\non return trips for free.\n\n       According to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit:\n\n       The sovereign acts defense was born of a trio of cases decided by the\n       Court of Claims in the nineteenth century.

She also stated that the introductory phrase, “[t]he purposes of the\nFRAGO is to enhance convoy security measures to protect the force,” required\nmovement in convoys in “militarease.” Regarding the language of the FRAGO, Lt.

And further in the order, it\ndoes talk about - it talks about non-tactical vehicles, which would be contract trucks.”\nShe stated she was referring to the phrase in the FRAGO, “cautioned not to move\noutside secured zones without security as set forth by MSC commanders.” (emphasis\nremoved). Lt. Col. O’Connor continued that if a commander suggested that she do\nsomething she would consider it an order. Immediately thereafter, however, she\nresponded on cross-examination that she would have discretion in implementing an\norder, and the ultimate decision would lie with her. The following exchange took place\nat trial:\n\n       Q: Would your discretion have any play into the determination of whether-\n\n       A: Yes\n\n       Q: - to follow –\n\n\n                                           188\n\f         A: Yes.\n\n         Q: - the commanders recommendations or suggestions?\n\n         A: Ethics and morales173 [sic].\n\n         Q: So if you think it’s ethical and morally advisable, the suggestion then by\n         your commander, you followed?\n\n         A: Yes, ma’am.\n\n         Q: The ultimate decision is yours, not the commanders; correct?\n\n         A: Yes, ma’am.\n\n         Q: So, in the military world, when a commander gives you an order, you\n         have no discretion?\n\n         A: I’ll do that.\n\n         Q: You must comply?\n\n         A: I’ll do that.\n\nIn response to the next question, with specific reference to the FRAGO, Lt. Col.\nO’Connor admitted that a suggestion is not an order. She testified:\n\n         Q: Now this language you just read at Section 3.D.2., I believe, says,\n         “non-tactical vehicles movements used to transport military members,\n         DOD civilians, and DOD contractors are cautioned not to move outside\n         secured zones without security.” The word “caution,” isn’t that a\n         suggestion, a recommendation, an advice?\n\n         A: Yes.\n\n         Q: So that’s not an order, is it?\n\n         A: No, at this point, I would say it’s not.\n\n        As indicated above, Lt. Col. O’Connor’s testimony was, at times, contradictory.\nShe offered confusing testimony on whether the FRAGO was an order, or left discretion\nto officers to decide whether a convoy was required. She responded to a question on\ncross-examination as to whether the language of the FRAGO indicated “that there is an\nobligation to provide convoys for the military?” by stating, “[t]o us, yes, ma’am.” Lt. Col.\n173\n      The word “morales” appears in the trial transcript.\n\n                                                189\n\fO’Connor attempted to explain her vacillation, by stating that “more stringent\nrestrictions” were placed on the FRAGO by lower-level commanding officers, who were\napparently authorized to make the FRAGO “more stringent and more plain to the people\nthat have to execute it.” Although Lt. Col. O’Connor testified that she was aware that\nprivate security firms may have been moving without convoys, and although more\nstringent orders were not introduced into evidence, Lt. Col. O’Connor also stated that\nshe knew “that every night a movement order was published and executed and no\ntrucks moved in that country that supported the United States Army, Air Force, or\nMarine Corps without a military convoy that was protected and executed by [sic] section\nand the infantry brigade that protected my section.”\n\n       Although defendant relies on Lt. Col. O’Connor’s testimony, including her\nstatement that the number of military escorts available was a decision made by the\nPresident of the United States, to support defendant’s argument that the FRAGO was a\nrequirement for Gulf Group to move in military convoys in support of the Army, and\nhighlights that Lt. Col. O’Connor “was responsible for all the movement control teams at\nmultiple convoy support centers throughout Iraq, as well as for setting up the convoys\nthat moved support into Iraq,” defendant also appears to attempt to distance itself from\nthe inconsistencies in Lt. Col. O’Connor’s testimony. According to defendant,\n“regardless of whether Lt. Col. O’Connor correctly interpreted whatever order she\nunderstood imposed the requirement that trucks move in military-protected convoys, her\nimplementation of that requirement constitutes a sovereign act.”\n\n        Plaintiff insists that the orders to travel in military convoys were contractual\nbecause the “Special Instructions” in the bottled water BPA instructed Gulf Group to\ncontact two certain Army officers for “directions and access to various locations.” Even\nif plaintiff was contractually bound to contact two particular Army officials, prior to\nmoving merchandise, however, the requirement to travel in convoys was a sovereign\nact if Army personnel were generally directed to require contractors to travel in convoys.\nPlaintiff argues that the first sentence of ¶ 3.D.2 of the relevant FRAGO, which states\nthat “[n]on-tactical vehicle (NTV) movements used to transport military members,\nDOD civilians, and DOD contractors are cautioned not to move outside secure\nzones without security as set forth by MSC commanders,” uses discretionary,\nrather than mandatory language. (emphasis in original). Throughout the FRAGO,\nhowever, there are mandatory descriptions of how protective measures were to be\nimplemented, such as “convoys will not have lights on,” and “there will be two vehicles\nminimum during daylight hours.” (emphasis added). In addition, although plaintiff\nidentifies the term “cautioned” as a non-mandatory phrase, the word “cautioned” must\nbe read in the context of the sentence in which it is contained: “[n]on-tactical vehicle\n(NTV) movements used to transport military members, DOD civilians, and DOD\ncontractors are cautioned not to move outside secure zones without security as set forth\nby MSC commanders.” (underlining added; bolding removed). The word “cautioned” is\nused in the sense of told, but the directive “not to move” is explicit. Moreover, the whole\nsentence leaves the discretion of how to move contractors in the military zone to “MSC\ncommanders,” which Lt. Col. O’Connor exercised by requiring military convoys.\n\n\n\n                                           190\n\f       Notwithstanding the government’s position that the requirement to travel in\nconvoys was a sovereign act, during performance of plaintiff’s bottled water BPA, the\ngovernment acknowledged some demurrage responsibility for delays caused by, among\nother reasons, insufficient number of military convoys. For example, on April 5, 2005,\nthe government increased the price it was paying for bottled water in exchange for\ncontractors not filing further demurrage claims. The following email was sent by Mr.\nCockerham to bottled water contractors:\n\n      Dear Vendors we have constantly been bombarded with Demurge [sic]\n      charges and claims from trucks being tied up over 7 days or water held up\n      at the border [sic] Vehicles shot up or vehicles having to bring equipment\n      back on the return trip. Therefore to elimate [sic] all the paperwork and\n      cliams [sic]. The C-4 and I have sit [sic] down and calculated the average\n      claims and came up with an average number of 2.578 KWD to cover the\n      case of water, the delivery plus the demurge [sic] charges. This will make\n      business easier for us and it will get your money quicker rather than the\n      claims process. All previous claims prior to APR 05 will continue to be\n      processed. We hope that you will find our 1 [sic] offer more than accepted\n      [sic] with the increase in your quote. Some will gain more other,\n      sometimes this will be to the government [sic] economic advantage and\n      other times it will be to the vendors advantage so it will balance out at the\n      end. Thank you all.\n\nThe parties stipulated that, “[o]n April 6, 2005, Gulf Group confirmed to the current\ncontracting officer, John Cockerham, that Gulf Group had received the proposed\nrevised price of 2.578 KD per case of bottled water and had accepted the newly\nadjusted rate per case in exchange for not making any more demurrage claims past\nApril 1, 2005.”\n\n       On September 12, 2005, Derrick Shoemake and Mr. Cockerham jointly signed a\nMemorandum for Record containing information similar to Mr. Cockerham’s earlier\nemail. The September 12, 2005 Memorandum stated:\n\n      The average price of a case of bottle water for delivery to Northern or\n      Western Iraq is 2.0 KD/case. This price includes direct delivery of a case\n      of water to Iraq under hostile conditions, however, this price does not\n      include demurge [sic] charges, storage fees, a guaranteed minimal\n      delivery, back-haul reinburstment [sic] in support of Heavy Lift VI or\n      frivolous claims for trucks that are attacked or damaged due to an IED\n      (unless completely destroyed). These claims were totaling in the\n      millions.... This counter offer [of 2.578 KD/case] allows the vendor to have\n      trucks delayed from returning indefinitely rather than paying delay charges\n      after seven (7) days without demurge [sic] charges (the average delay is\n      19 days before all trucks are return [sic] from delivery). This system\n      allows the vendor to store water for emergency pushes and timely pushes\n      during normal request without storage fees.\n\n\n                                          191\n\f(emphasis in original).\n\n      At trial, Mr. Cockerham offered further information about the price increases in\nthe September 12, 2005 Memorandum. Mr. Cockerham explained that the purpose of\nthe Memorandum was to reduce the costs to the government of processing the claims\n“because it was consuming the time of a couple officers constantly having to make\nadjustment payments and it was with finance and also having to request additional\nfunds to cover the demurrage charges.” Mr. Cockerham stated that the demurrage\ncharges\n\n       were encountered a couple ways, one being trucks held up for return, also\n       trucks who had claims against the government that were either destroyed\n       from IEDs or so forth, things of that nature.... And also for paying for\n       storage, additional storage when the trucks couldn’t move. Several of the\n       companies had set up warehouses on the border to offload the trucks and\n       then reload them because of the long delays.\n\nWith regard to including the storage expenses in the delay charges, Mr. Cockerham\nstated: “We just kind of put it all under that because any delays we were putting them\nbasically under demurrage claims,” and, “[w]e ended up with a small room full of boxes\nof claims of demurrage charges.” When questioned, Mr. Cockerham agreed that there\nwere hundreds of claims. As to how many demurrage claims the government received,\nMr. Cockerham testified: “I can’t say how many.... I’ll say the average was about two a\nweek.”\n\n       The record reflects that the Army had entered into numerous agreements to\ndeliver bottled water, including the bottled water BPA with Gulf Group. Mr. Cockerham\ndid not remember all the companies specifically, but the parties stipulated that, for\nexample, in 2004, StarCon, another contractor supplying bottled water to the\ngovernment in Iraq, “submitted a claim for demurrage expenses incurred from delays of\nthe convoys,” and “[o]n December 4, 2004 StarCon’s claim for demurrage expenses\nwas approved by the issuance of a BPA Call.” Mr. Cockerham also stated, although\ngiving conflicting testimony, that he remembered a demurrage claim from IAP, a bottled\nwater contractor, being paid. He also testified that, “[t]here was one in-house policy,\nand I forget the exact days on it, but I believe it was just standard if a truck was held\nseven days past the required time given for delivery they were paid.”\n\n        Defendant notes with respect to the government’s interaction with other\ncontractors, “the sovereign acts inquiry does not rest upon a mechanical determination\nof how many contractors are affected, but rather focuses upon the nature and scope of\nthe governmental action.” Conner Bros. Constr. Co. v. Geren, 550 F.3d at 1378. The\nevidence in the record suggests that the Army may have required substantially all Army\ncontractors, and of particular relevance here, all bottled water contractors, to travel in\nmilitary convoys. Although she was, at times, nervous and slightly confused on how to\ninterpret the precise language of the FRAGO, Lt. Col. O’Connor testified that she\nuniformly enforced the requirement to travel in military convoys, regardless of the\n\n\n                                           192\n\fvarious interpretations of the FRAGO. Moreover, the requirement for bottled water\ncontractors in the war theatre, to carry an essential commodity for the troops in safety,\nin order to ensure uncontaminated arrival, combined with the desire to secure the safety\nof contractor and military personnel in the war zone, leads the court to conclude that,\nwhen directing that the water had to be transported in military convoys, the government\nwas acting in its sovereign capacity, rather than in its contracting capacity, even though\nthe government appears to have paid a number of demurrage claims. It would be\nunreasonable to conclude that any contractor could move freely without supervision or\nprotection to deliver water to the troops in the war zone. The water and the personnel\nhad to be secured and delivered safely with no possibility of harm or contamination.\n\n        As argued by defendant, “[t]he requirement that trucks move in military-protected\nconvoys was not directed at nullifying contractor rights or relieving the Government of its\ncontract obligations; rather, the purpose of that requirement was to protect convoy\nmovements, both ‘unit moves’ of soldiers and equipment, and ‘logistics sustainment’\nmoves that included contractors,” and to keep safe the essential commodity\ntransported. The effect of the requirement to travel in military convoys on Gulf Group’s\n“contract rights was incidental to the achievement of a broader governmental objective\nrelating to national security and therefore did not give rise to governmental liability.”\nConner Bros. Constr. Co. v. Geren, 550 F.3d at 1379. As the Federal Circuit noted in\nConner Brothers, “[t]he key issue here—as in all sovereign act cases—is not whether\nthe government had the authority to exclude Conner for national security purposes, but\nrather who should bear the cost of an action that was admittedly in the public interest: a\nsingle contractor or the taxpayers at large. The answer to that question turns on\nwhether the governmental action was public and general, not whether it served the\npublic interest.” Id. at 1378 n.1.\n\n       In an order issued by the court prior to trial, the court denied the defendant’s\nmotion for summary judgment to invoke the Sovereign Acts Doctrine “based on a failure\nof proof in the record before the court” at that time before trial. This current opinion is\nissued following a lengthy trial, after review of all the information now in the record\nregarding the period during which Gulf Group was performing under the bottled water\nBPA, including the testimony of numerous witnesses and the documentation introduced\ninto the record. Based on the record before the court, and particularly in the bottled\nwater BPA case, Case No. 07-82C, the court finds that under the facts presented, the\nrequirement for Gulf Group to travel in convoys was a sovereign act.\n\n        Even if the requirement to travel in convoys was a sovereign act, “‘it does not\nfollow that discharge will always be available, for the common-law doctrine of\nimpossibility imposes additional requirements before a party may avoid liability for\nbreach.’” Carabetta Enters., Inc. v. United States, 482 F.3d at 1365. Thus, under “the\nsecond part of the sovereign acts doctrine analysis, which addresses whether the\nsovereign act would otherwise release the Government from liability under ordinary\nprinciples of contract law,” Klamath Irrigation Dist. v. United States, 635 F.3d at 522\n(citing Stockton E. Water Dist. v. United States, 583 F.3d at 1366), the issue is whether\nthe government has shown that, “‘the...actions made it impossible for’” the Army to fulfill\n\n\n                                           193\n\fits obligations under the bottled water BPA. Id. (quoting Stockton E. Water Dist. v.\nUnited States, 583 F.3d at 1367). “[T]he doctrine of impossibility of performance\n‘excuses delay or non-performance of a contract where the agreed upon performance\nhas been rendered ‘commercially impracticable’ by an unforeseen supervening event\nnot within the contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was formed.’”\nSeaboard Lumber Co. v.

United States, 635 F.3d at 522\n(quoting Seaboard Lumber Co. v. United States, 308 F.3d at 1294). “[T]he\nnonoccurrence of the act in question must have been a basic assumption of the\ncontract, and the government must not have assumed the risk that such an act would\noccur.” Conner Bros. Constr. Co. v. Geren, 550 F.3d at 1379 (citing United States v.\nWinstar Corp., 518 U.S. at 905; Seaboard Lumber Co. v. United States, 308 F.3d at\n1294).\n\n       The court concludes that the agreed-upon performance of timely deliveries was\nmade impossible by the necessity of traveling in convoys and unforeseen delays in a\nwar zone. Moreover, regarding the second prong of the Sovereign Acts Doctrine test,\nthe “Special Instructions” as part of the bottled water BPA, quoted above, demonstrates\nthat the government did not assume the risk of delays in getting the bottled water into\nIraq. The second prong of the Sovereign Acts Doctrine test, is therefore, satisfied.\nThere is no allegation here that the Army refused to pay Gulf Group for the deliveries of\nbottled water.\n\n        Left unresolved, however, is whether the government should be held liable for\nplaintiff’s transporting government equipment on return trips, including for delays\ncaused by the convoy escort requirement, although plaintiff had no obligation to do so\nunder the bottled water BPA. Both the trial testimony and the post-trial briefings did not\nfully address the return trips. With regard to the hauling of equipment, Mr. Cockerham\nexplained that the government had a Heavy Lift contract in place at a cost of $37 billion\nfor the purpose of returning equipment from Iraq to Kuwait, which was not being used\nbecause the government, instead, was loading the equipment on incoming bottled water\ntrucks for the return trip. The Army benefited economically from the convoy requirement\napplied to Gulf Group’s bottled water trucks by having the military equipment\ntransported on the return trips for free and by not having to use and pay other\ncontractors to transport the equipment. According to Mr. Cockerham, the government\nalso benefited because the bottled water trucks were used to store the equipment to be\ntransported back to Kuwait “until such time as the government can make arrangement\nto get it back or get it to the right unit.” Because of the convoy escort requirement, the\nArmy was able to more closely control the departure time of Gulf Group’s trucks from\nIraq. Saud Al Tawash testified that insufficient military convoys on the return trips to\nKuwait caused further delays for Gulf Group.\n\n\n\n\n                                           194\n\f        Defendant makes two arguments against defendant’s obligation to pay plaintiff\nfor any return trips. Defendant argues that plaintiff’s allegedly inflated claim and\nviolation of the False Claims Act with regard to the bottled water BPA claims, precludes\nany award to Gulf Group. The court has concluded, however, that there was no\nviolation of the False Claims Act regarding the bottled water BPA. Defendant further\nargues that, if there were an insufficient number of convoys on the return trips, that too\nwas a sovereign act. Defendant argues: “The number of military escorts for convoys\nwas a function of the decision making of the President of the United States. That too\nwas a sovereign act; it was not directed at nullifying contractor rights or relieving the\nGovernment of its contractual obligations, but directed at the broader governmental\nobjective of national security.” Defendant, however, fails to address the fact that some\nof the delays were also caused by the hauling of equipment on the return trips.\n\n       Defendant’s second argument takes the Sovereign Acts Doctrine to the extreme.\nUnder defendant’s interpretation, any decision made by Army personnel in the war\ntheatre ultimately would have been a function of the decision making of the President of\nthe United States in furtherance of national security, and potentially could render any\nclaims by a contractor null. Unlike the trips to Iraq, the claims for return trips are not\ncovered by the Sovereign Acts Doctrine. It does not appear that the government\ngenerally ordered Gulf Group or any other contractor to transport equipment back from\nIraq.\n\n        But, regardless of whether the decision to use bottled water trucks to carry other\nequipment was a sovereign act, and regardless of whether any delays caused by the\nconvoy requirement are excused by the doctrine of impossibility, plaintiff has not met its\nburden of proof with respect to its claims for demurrage monies owed for the return\ntrips.174 As noted above, neither the trial testimony nor the post-trial briefings fully\naddressed the return trips and whether the government had an obligation to\ncompensate Gulf Group for these trips. In a supplemental brief, defendant notes\nplaintiff stated that, “there is not actual evidence in the record of this case regarding the\nexact number of days the roads were closed due to religious holidays or road side\nbombing,” to which defendant does not disagree. Defendant also takes issue with the\nchart prepared by plaintiff in response to the court’s order, arguing the Gantt chart does\nnot identify the days of delay that, allegedly, were government-caused, versus which\ndays were caused by factors outside the government’s control. Unfortunately for\nplaintiff, the evidence in the record currently before the court does not segregate return-\ntrip delay days that were caused by the government from return-trip delay days that\nwere caused by factors outside the government’s control. Although plaintiff alleged that,\nbetween November 2004 and March 2005, there were a total of 3,511 days of delay,\ncompared to defendant’s calculation of 3,513 days of delay, Gulf Group fails to account\nseparately for delays that were caused by the convoy requirement or the hauling of\nequipment. Defendant notes, “[d]elivery trucks traveling in military convoys were\n174\n   Similar to the camp package BPA, latrine, and dumper claims, defendant concedes\nthat Gulf Group incurred demurrage expenses. Unlike the camp package BPA, latrine,\nand dumpster claims, however, it is not clear that defendant is responsible for the\nexpenses that plaintiff incurred.\n\n                                            195\n\fdelayed at various times because of IEDs and observance of religious holidays by Iraqi\nnationals.” Saud Al Tawash testified generally, but without specifics:\n\n      Because the operation didn’t become efficient, we didn’t have the trucks\n      back from Iraq, we had to store the water and we had to incur expenses\n      both local transportation and the warehousing. We warehoused, we\n      couldn’t warehouse this water anywhere. Because of the issues with the\n      climate and the issues of security. This bottled water is again going for\n      the troops. We had to put this in a climate controlled warehouse and\n      secured. So we chose the warehouse in the Free Trade Zone because\n      it’s inside a militarized, it’s operated by the military of Kuwait. And this\n      particular facility was Gulf Telecom's facility. So Gulf Telecom leased it to\n      Gulf Group during this time.\n\n       As noted by defendant, “Gulf Group provides no objective evidence, such as a\npick-up schedule from the factory [sic] or testimony from factory personnel, that\ndemonstrates the existence of a pick-up schedule or a requirement to pick up water\naccording to a particular schedule.” Without more than Saud Al Tawash’s general\ntestimony, the plaintiff has not demonstrated the specific return trip delay days that were\ngovernment-caused. Plaintiff, thus, has failed to meet its burden to prove the costs\nassociated with the government-caused delays resulting from return trips.175 Due to the\n175\n    Gulf Group argues that it requested that the government produce data from “the\nCombat Logistics Patrols (CLP) Tracker,” to allow plaintiff to differentiate between\ngovernment-caused delays and non-government-caused delays, but that the\ngovernment was not able to locate the requested data. According to plaintiff, the\ngovernment’s failure to provide this data “should be grounds for the formulation of an\nadverse inference preventing the Government from arguing as it does here, that Gulf\nGroup cannot carry its burden of proof, and that the documents in question would show\nthat the delays were all related to the convoy requirement.” The Federal Circuit has\nrecognized:\n\n      The general rules of evidence law create an adverse inference when\n      evidence has been destroyed and “(1)...the party having control over the\n      evidence had an obligation to preserve it at the time it was destroyed;\n      (2)...the records were destroyed with a culpable state of mind; and\n      (3)...the destroyed evidence was relevant to the party’s claim or defense\n      such that a reasonable trier of fact could find that it would support that\n      claim or defense.”\n\nSee Jandreau v.

Although Gulf Group and Saud Al Tawash relied on their advisors as\nto how to submit claims to the United States government and how to file complaints in\nthis court, the failure of those advisors to provide competent advice and Gulf Group’s\nand Saud Al Tawash’s reckless disregard for the accuracy of Gulf Group’s camp\npackage BPA, latrine contract, and dumpster contract claims leads the court to\nconclude that Gulf Group violated the False Claims Act when it submitted inflated and\nbaseless claims to the contracting officer in 2005 and 2007. Because defendant has\nnot demonstrated that it suffered damages as a result of plaintiff’s submission of its\nclaims, plaintiff is liable only for the maximum statutory penalty of $11,000.00 per claim,\nfor a total amount of $66,000.00 for six violations of the False Claims Act. Although\nGulf Group’s failure to understand the basic requirements for submitting a claim to the\ngovernment leads the court to conclude that Gulf Group violated the False Claims Act,\nthe deficiencies in Gulf Group’s camp package BPA, latrine contract, and dumpster\ncontract claims also lead the court to conclude that Gulf Group did not intend to deceive\nthe government, which is required to establish liability under the Contract Disputes Act\nor to warrant forfeiture under the Special Plea in Fraud statute. In addition, defendant’s\nfailure to establish that plaintiff intended to deceive the government or that plaintiff’s\ncontracts were tainted by a conflict of interest leads the court to conclude that the\nrescission or disgorgement of the camp package or bottled water BPA calls is not\nwarranted.\n\n        Although the court does not condone the manner in which Gulf Group submitted\nits claims to the contracting officer, defendant’s behavior in this case was equally\nproblematic with regard to its termination of the latrine and dumpster contracts.\nAlthough the record reflects a number of purported, and shifting, justifications offered by\ndefendant’s personnel for terminating Gulf Group’s latrine and dumpster contracts for\nconvenience, none of the justifications presented to the court were reasonable or\nconsistent with the government’s obligation to act in good faith. The government’s\n\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed. Cl.</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 664 (2012) (citation omitted); Morse Diesel Int’l, Inc. v.\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed. Cl.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 222 (2008) (citation omitted). Gulf Group did not move\nfor a finding of spoliation and did not attempt to prove the elements of spoliation that\nwould justify an application of an adverse inference in the bottled water BPA case. Gulf\nGroup has, therefore, failed to meet its burden of proof with respect to the bottled water\nBPA claims in a variety of ways. See Precision Pine & Timber, Inc. v. United States,\n596 F.3d at 833 (“[T]he party seeking damages has the burden of proving them with\n‘reasonable certainty.’”); see also Ariz. Pub. Serv. Co. v. United States, 93 Fed. Cl. at\n390 (noting that, although there was “no doubt” that the plaintiff incurred costs, the\nplaintiff “did not show to a degree of reasonable certainty that the costs could be tied\ndirectly to its mitigation efforts”).\n\n                                              197\n\fallegations with respect to the alleged security incident and Gulf Group’s performance\nunder the latrine and dumpster contracts were without basis. The record before the\ncourt indicates that government personnel were simply motivated, as Col. Hess\ndescribed, “to get Gulf Group off the bases,” while at the same time contracting with\nGulf Group for other services, including continuation of calls under the bottled water\nBPA.\n\n        The court concludes, therefore, that the government abused its discretion in\nterminating Gulf Group’s latrine and dumpster contracts, thereby entitling Gulf Group to\nlost profits for the base period of the latrine contract in the amount of 92,443.724 KD,\nplus interest. The record establishes that plaintiff would not have made a profit during\nthe base period of the dumpster contract. Given defendant’s concession of the costs\nplaintiff incurred in preparing to perform the dumpster contract, therefore, Gulf Group is\nentitled to 47,881.664 KD, plus interest, which amounts to the costs Gulf Group incurred\nin preparing to perform the dumpster contract, less the value of the loss Gulf Group\nwould have incurred in performing during the base period of the dumpster contract.\n\n        In contrast to the latrine and dumpster contracts, Gulf Group did not establish\nthat defendant abused its discretion in terminating the camp package BPA call for Camp\nBuehring. Defendant has advanced a good faith, reasonable explanation for its\ntermination of the call for Camp Buehring. The record before the court indicates that\ndefendant terminated the call for Camp Buehring for reasons primarily unrelated to its\ntermination of the latrine and dumpster contracts. Although Saud Al Tawash and Gulf\nGroup may have anticipated receiving an award of a call for Camp Virginia, defendant\nwas not contractually obligated to make such an award. Gulf Group is, therefore, only\nentitled to recover the costs it incurred in preparing to perform the call for Camp\nBuehring, which amounts to 19,323.000 KD, plus interest, as a result of the\ngovernment’s termination for convenience.\n\n       Gulf Group advanced a consistent and understandable claim under the bottled\nwater BPA for demurrage costs associated with what plaintiff alleges were government-\ncaused delays. To the extent that any delays were caused by the government’s\nrequirement that Gulf Group deliver bottled water into Iraq in military convoys, the court\nconcludes that Gulf Group may not recover for the additional costs it incurred by these\ndelays because the requirement to travel in military convoys was a sovereign act.\nMoreover, the court concludes that it would have been commercially and otherwise\nimpossible for the government to have avoided causing delays by not requiring Gulf\nGroup to deliver bottled water in military convoys, that the parties did not foresee that\nthe requirement to travel in military convoys would cause delays, and that the\ngovernment did not assume the risk of any delays caused in the delivery of bottled\nwater into Iraq. The Sovereign Acts Doctrine, therefore, precludes Gulf Group from\nrecovering for the delays caused by the requirement to travel in military convoys when\ndelivering bottled water into Iraq. With respect to the return-trip delays, although plaintiff\nclearly provided a service to the defendant, the court concludes that, given the nature of\ntransportation conditions in the theatre at the time, including numerous possible delay\n\n\n\n                                            198\n\ffactors, Gulf Group did not present the court with sufficient evidence to determine that\nthe government is responsible for any return-trip delays.\n\n      IT IS SO ORDERED.\n\n                                                      s/Marian Blank Horn\n                                                      MARIAN BLANK HORN\n                                                               Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                          199\n\f</pre>",
