The issues\n\ninclude challenges to: the sufficiency of the evidence, the award of injunctive relief, the\n\nadmission of expert testimony, and the viability of judgment following a default judgment\n\nagainst one of the original defendants. We affirm the trial court’s judgment.\n\n                                         BACKGROUND\n\n       In the early 1950s, the Vogts purchased a nineteen-acre tract of land in Kendall County,\n\nTexas. The couple has lived on this property since it was purchased. In 1975, the Vogts\n\npurchased an adjacent 0.911-acre tract (“the one-acre tract”). The Vogts’ deed to the one-acre\n\ntract expressly granted the Vogts a twenty-foot easement for ingress and egress from the\n\nhighway to the one-acre tract. This easement was the only way for the Vogts to access the one-\n\nacre tract without trespassing or driving through a field and across a drainage ditch on the\n\nnineteen-acre tract.\n\n       In 2005, a real estate developer, Trada Partners VI, LP, purchased the property adjoining\n\nthe Vogts’ one-acre tract. The property purchased by Trada Partners adjoined the Vogts’ twenty-\n\nfoot easement. The City of Boerne notified the Vogts about a public meeting scheduled to\n\ndiscuss Trada Partners’s rezoning request with regard to the property. Trada Partners wanted to\n\nbuild a development on the property, which was to be called The Village at Stone Creek. The\n\ndevelopment would consist of thirty-two four-plex apartment buildings. At the time of the\n\npurchase, the adjoining property contained a few buildings and a baseball field.\n\n       According to the Vogts, at the public meeting they met John Sieckert who was either the\n\npresident or vice president of Trada Partners. Mr. Vogt testified he welcomed Sieckert to the\n\nneighborhood and advised him about the twenty-foot easement. According to Marin, Mr. Vogt\n\n\n\n                                               -2-\n\f                                                                                               04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nagreed to swap his easement for another easement to be provided as part of the new\n\ndevelopment. The new easement would be paved and gated. Marin contends Trada Partners’s\n\ndevelopment moved forward in reliance upon Mr. Vogt’s representation that he would “swap\n\neasement for easement,” and it was only after Trada Partners had expended millions of dollars on\n\nthe development that the Vogts filed suit. 1 Mr. Vogt denied he ever agreed to swap his current\n\neasement for a new easement, admitting only that on a single occasion he “casually mentioned to\n\nsomeone with the City of Boerne that he might be willing to exchange easements” if it would\n\nenable to him to access his one-acre tract. Mr. Vogt denied ever speaking to anyone with Trada\n\nPartners or Marin about this, and claimed no one from Trada Partners or Marin ever even offered\n\nto exchange easements with him or provide the Vogts with a new easement. It is undisputed\n\nthere was no written agreement concerning an exchange of easements.\n\n        In any event, Mr. Vogt ultimately became concerned when he saw dirt and debris being\n\npiled onto his easement and tried to contact someone at Trada Partners. Mr. Vogt testified that in\n\nJanuary 2006, he met with Sieckert and showed him how construction crews were piling dirt on\n\nthe easement. According to Mr. Vogt, Sieckert stated, “If you think . . . we’re going to change\n\nour plans because you say that’s your easement . . . you’re greatly mistaken.” Despite Sieckert’s\n\nalleged statement, the subdivision plat for the development expressly recognized the Vogts’ “20'\n\ningress and egress easement.”\n\n        There was testimony that during construction, Trada Partners built pads, hauled in dirt,\n\nand raised the level of the property, including the easement, by as much as two-and-a-half feet.\n\nAfter Marin acquired part of the development, it continued the construction, encroaching on the\n\neasement and raising the level of the property. In February of 2006, Mr. Vogt sent a letter to\n\n\n1\n Initially, the Vogts sued only Trada Partners. However, after construction of the development was complete, the\nVogts named subsequent purchasers of property within the development as defendants.\n\n                                                      -3-\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nTrada Partners that provided the developer with deed record references for the easement. Mr.\n\nVogt testified he sent the letter because Trada Partners and Marin had erected a fence that\n\nblocked ingress and egress by way of the easement, built a rock and dirt wall on the easement,\n\nand dug a large ditch that prohibited passage. In response, Mr. Vogt received a letter from\n\ncounsel for Trada Partners advising Mr. Vogt that Trada Partners had provided him with a\n\n“private gate” for access, but the easement had been terminated by eminent domain, had been\n\nunusable for years, and had been abandoned by non-use. According to Mr. Vogt, none of these\n\nstatements was true, and we have found nothing in the record to support any of Trada Partners’s\n\nassertions. Trada Partners’s attorney concluded the letter by directing Mr. Vogt to “cease and\n\ndesist” from attempts to use the easement–despite the fact the Vogts owned the easement by\n\nrecorded deed.\n\n       After receiving the letter, Mr. Vogt hired an attorney, who wrote a letter to Trada\n\nPartners’s attorney advising him the Vogts had a valid, recorded easement memorialized in the\n\nplats Trada Partners filed with the City of Boerne. He further advised Trada Partners’s attorney\n\nthe easement never terminated and had been in use by the Vogts until that use was barred by\n\nTrada Partners’s actions. The letter demanded the easement be returned to its original condition.\n\nEvidence in the record shows Trada Partners did not restore the easement, but continued\n\nencroaching on and blocking the easement. At this point, the Vogts filed suit against Trada\n\nPartners. Marin and the other buyers were later added as defendants in the suit after they\n\nacquired portions of the development.\n\n       In the suit, the Vogts alleged the development encroached upon their easement, rendering\n\nit unusable. They further asserted the alterations, specifically increases in elevation, caused the\n\ndiversion of the natural flow of surface water onto the easement and the Vogts’ property, both\n\n\n\n                                               -4-\n\f                                                                                      04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nnineteen and one-acre tracts, resulting in flooding. The Vogts sought temporary and permanent\n\ninjunctive relief, requiring the removal of any structures interfering with the easement, or\n\ndamages for the loss of use of the easement and for damages due to surface water diversion.\n\n       Before trial, the trial court granted a temporary injunction in favor of the Vogts. Trada\n\nPartners VI, LP v. Vogt, No. 04-06-00723-CV, 2007 WL 163181, at *1 (Tex. App.—San\n\nAntonio Jan. 24, 2007, no pet.). The temporary injunction enjoined Trada Partners and Marin\n\nfrom interfering with the Vogts’ use of the easement. Id. Trada Partners and Marin appealed the\n\ngranting of the temporary injunction, and this court reversed, holding the Vogts had failed to\n\n“establish a sufficient probability of irreparable injury in the absence of a temporary injunction”\n\nbecause Mr. Vogt admitted the obstruction of the easement did not completely deprive the Vogts\n\nof access to the one-acre parcel; they could access the one-acre parcel through their other tract of\n\nland, which was contiguous to the one-acre tract. Id. at *1-*2. Because the Vogts would only\n\nsuffer inconvenience if the injunction was lifted, they did not establish a sufficient probability of\n\nirreparable injury, an element that must be established to obtain a temporary injunction. Id. at\n\n*2.\n\n       Trada Partners and Marin answered the suit. Marin asserted a general denial and the\n\naffirmative defenses of estoppel, consent, fraud, and failure to mitigate. Marin later asserted a\n\ncounterclaim seeking declaratory relief, specific performance, a finding of promissory estoppel,\n\ninjunctive relief and damages based on the Vogts’ alleged negligent misrepresentations, fraud,\n\nbreach of contract, and trespass.\n\n       After suit was filed, the Vogts and Trada Partners entered into a Rule 11 agreement that\n\nprovided: (1) the Vogts owned the easement, which was recorded in the deed records; (2) Trada\n\nPartners would not challenge the existence of continuing validity of the easement nor assert it\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f                                                                                   04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nhas been extinguished in any manner; and (3) the Vogts were entitled to “repair and maintain the\n\nEasement at their discretion” as long as they did not “unduly interfere with the servient estate,”\n\ni.e., the development. When the easement became impassable, the Vogts’ counsel advised\n\ncounsel for Trada Partners by letter that if the easement were not restored to allow ingress and\n\negress, the Vogts would exercise their rights under the Rule 11 agreement to maintain the\n\neasement themselves. When no action was taken, the Vogts hired a contractor to return the\n\neasement to its original condition, and the Vogts’ counsel notified Trada Partners’s attorney, who\n\nnow represented Marin as well, of their intentions. In response, Trada Partners’s attorney asked\n\nfor the name of the contractor , claiming it was to coordinate activities. The Vogts’ attorney\n\ndisclosed the name of the contractor. Thereafter, someone from Trada Partners contacted the\n\ncontractor and threatened him with “immediate legal action” if during the work on the easement\n\nhe impeded the construction process or trespassed on property outside the easement.           The\n\ncontractor was also advised that if he worked on the easement, he needed to contact counsel for\n\nTrada Partners and Marin because the attorney would need to “depose [him] regarding [the]\n\nexact and complete scope of work” he intended to perform for the Vogts. The contractor, fearing\n\ninvolvement in the pending legal proceedings, refused to do the work for the Vogts, as did any\n\nother contractor in the area.\n\n       The Vogts then attempted to do the work themselves, which ultimately resulted in a\n\nreport of criminal mischief and criminal trespass by someone from Trada Partners to the Boerne\n\nPolice Department. Later, in 2008, Mr. Vogt was arrested after there was a second report from\n\nSusan Rogers, the manager of the apartments on the development, and a Trada Partners\n\nconstruction superintendent, that Mr. Vogt had damaged fencing and marked encroachments on\n\nthe easement with orange spray paint. Sieckert was contacted during the police investigation and\n\n\n\n                                               -6-\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nadvised the investigator that Mr. Vogt had damaged the property once before, and suspected he\n\nwas responsible for this second round of “criminal mischief.” The Boerne investigator also had\n\ncontact with the attorney for Trada Partners and Marin, who advised him “Vogt had no need to\n\nuse Trada’s property since Vogt could access all of his property through his own property . . .\n\n[and] Trada has also provided a paved route through the property and a private gate for Vogt’s\n\nproperty, but Vogt does not acknowledge it.” The attorney did not advise the investigator about\n\nthe Rule 11 agreement that allowed the Vogts to remove encroachments on the easement if Trada\n\nPartners and Marin refused. It was only after Mr. Vogt and his son showed the investigator the\n\nRule 11 agreement and asked the attorney about it that the attorney acknowledged its existence.\n\nHowever, counsel for Trada Partners and Marin told the investigator this court’s judgment in the\n\ntemporary injunction action “overturned” the Rule 11 agreement and gave Trada Partners and\n\nMarin the right to build on the easement. The attorney told the investigator, based on this court’s\n\nopinion, Trada Partners and Marin could block the entire easement if they so chose. The\n\ninvestigator called Sieckert again and Sieckert told him Rogers was his agent and would provide\n\nan affidavit on his behalf, which she did. Based on information provided to the Boerne Police\n\nDepartment by Trada Partners and Marin, Mr. Vogt was arrested for felony criminal mischief.\n\nTrada Partners and Marin allegedly reported that Mr. Vogt had moved dirt and damaged fencing,\n\nbut eventually claimed he had caused some major structural damage costing thousands of dollars\n\nto repair. Although Mr. Vogt was ultimately “no-billed” by the grand jury, he was arrested,\n\nfingerprinted, and had his mug shot taken. Mr. Vogt testified that as a former Chief Deputy\n\nSheriff and constable, he was extremely embarrassed by the arrest, especially after his mug shot\n\nwas broadcast on television and counsel for Trada Partners and Marin talked about the case on\n\n\n\n\n                                               -7-\n\f                                                                                        04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nthe news of a San Antonio television station. This incident resulted in the Vogts asserting a\n\nclaim for malicious prosecution.\n\n            When the case was called for trial on May 5, 2009, Trada Partners, which the trial court\n\nfound received notice of the trial setting, failed to appear. Accordingly, on October 12, 2009, the\n\ntrial court entered a default judgment against Trada Partners. The damages awarded to the Vogts\n\nagainst Trada Partners in the default judgment mirrored the damages ultimately found by the jury\n\nat trial.\n\n            A jury trial was held between the Vogts and the remaining defendants. After all the\n\nevidence was heard, the jury was asked, generally, whether:\n\n            $improvements on the development encroached on the Vogts’ easement, and if\n            so, what sum of money would fairly and reasonably compensate the Vogts for\n            loss of use of the easement from the time of the first encroachment to the present;\n\n            $the development resulted in a diversion of surface water onto the Vogts’ one-\n            acre tract, whether damages from the diversion were permanent or temporary, and\n            if there was a diversion caused by the development, what sum of money would\n            fairly and reasonably compensate the Vogts for loss of use of the one-acre tract\n            and the difference in market value of the one-acre tract after the water diversion;\n\n            $the diversion of surface water caused damage to the Vogts’ nineteen-acre tract,\n            whether such damage was permanent or temporary, and if there was a diversion,\n            what sum of money would fairly and reasonably compensate the Vogts for loss of\n            use of the nineteen-acre tract and the difference in market value of the nineteen-\n            acre tract after the water diversion;\n\n            $the act of diverting the surface water onto the Vogts’ nineteen-acre tract was\n            done with malice, and if so, what sum of damages should be awarded as\n            exemplary damages for the malicious act; and\n\n            $Marin maliciously prosecuted Mr. Vogt, and if so, what sum of money would\n            fairly and reasonably compensate him for his injuries.\n\n            The jury answered “yes” to all the liability questions and, where appropriate, found the\n\nproperty damage permanent. The jury awarded the Vogts a total of $1,691,372 for their claims\n\nof encroachment, surface water diversion, and malicious prosecution.

The\n\ntrial court also awarded the Vogts’ $50,732.51 in attorney’s fees and contingent appellate\n\nattorney’s fees. 2 In addition to the compensatory relief, the trial court also awarded the Vogts’\n\ninjunctive relief, requiring all encroachments be removed from the Vogts’ easement.\n\n           Marin filed for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a motion for new trial; both\n\nwere denied. Thereafter, Marin perfected this appeal.\n\n                                                        ANALYSIS\n\n           On appeal, Marin raises nine issues, contending:\n\n           $the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the award of\n           injunctive relief;\n\n           $the trial court erred in denying the motions for judgment notwithstanding the\n           verdict and for new trial because the verdict cannot support the judgment award\n           of damages for loss of use of the easement due to encroachment;\n\n           $the award of injunctive relief and damages for encroachment is erroneous\n           because it amounts to an improper double recovery;\n\n           $the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of expert Wayne Godsey because\n           his causation opinion regarding the surface water diversion was unreliable, based\n           on a faulty foundation, and amounted to mere speculation and supposition;\n\n           $the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of expert Lonnie Marquardt\n           because his opinions on the issue of damages for the surface water diversion and\n           the appraised value of the Vogts’ property were based on improper methodology\n           and a faulty foundation, and amounted to mere speculation and supposition;\n\n           $the trial court erred in admitting testimony from the Vogts’ experts despite\n           timely objections;\n\n           $the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the jury’s finding\n           regarding the Vogts’ surface water diversion claims because there is no evidence\n           or insufficient evidence of causation and damages;\n\n           $the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the jury’s malicious\n           prosecution finding because the Vogts failed to prove certain required elements of\n           the claim; and\n2\n    The parties had agreed to submit the issue of attorney’s fees to the trial court for determination.\n\n                                                             -9-\n\f                                                                                       04-10-00602-CV\n\n\n\n\n       $the trial court erred in granting judgment for the Vogts because the default\n       judgment taken against Trada Partners disposed of all parties and issues in the\n       suit.\n\n                                          Injunctive Relief\n\n       In its first issue, Marin contends “the evidence adduced at trial is legally and, in the\n\nalternative, factually insufficient to support the injunctive relief granted by the trial court because\n\nof the “‘law of the case.’” However, in an appeal from a permanent injunction, the standard of\n\nreview is clear abuse of discretion. Triantaphyllis v. Gamble, 93 S.W.3d 398, 402 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2000, pet. denied); W. Wendell Hall et al., Hall’s Standards of Review in\n\nTexas, 42 ST. MARY’S L.J. 1, 121 (2010). Although a litigant is entitled to a jury trial when\n\nseeking injunctive relief, the jury only determines ultimate factual issues. W. Wendell Hall et\n\nal., Hall’s Standards of Review in Texas, 42 ST. MARY’S L.J. 1, 121 (2010). The trial court\n\ndetermines the “expediency, necessity or propriety” of any award of this form of equitable relief.\n\nId. (quoting Priest v. Tex. Animal Health Comm’n, 780 S.W.2d 874, 875 (Tex. App.—Dallas\n\n1989, no writ)).\n\n       In its final judgment, the trial court awarded the Vogts permanent injunctive relief. More\n\nspecifically, the trial court found that because of Marin’s action in encroaching upon the Vogts’\n\neasement, the Vogts’ one-acre tract “no longer [had] passable deeded access making it\n\nunmarketable,” and emergency personnel could not access the one-acre tract via the one-acre\n\ntract’s 911 address. Concluding the Vogts had no adequate remedy at law and would continue to\n\nsuffer irreparable injury and imminent harm as a result of the encroachment, the trial court\n\nordered that “all buildings, fences, culverts, curbs, sidewalks, air conditioning units, and any\n\nother items and structures . . . that encroach on the easement and interfere with use of the entire\n\ntwenty (20) foot easement” be removed. The trial court then permanently enjoined further\n\n                                                 - 10 -\n\f                                                                                      04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nbuilding, construction, or alterations that would interfere with or obstruct the Vogts’ use of the\n\neasement. This relief is the subject of Marin’s first issue.\n\n       As noted above, prior to trial, the Vogts sought a temporary injunction to restrain Trada\n\nPartners and Marin from interfering with the Vogts’ use of the easement. Id. The trial court\n\ngranted the requested injunctive relief on October 6, 2006. Id. Trada Partners and Marin\n\nappealed the granting of the temporary injunction, contending the Vogts had not established they\n\nwould suffer a probable irreparable injury in the absence of a temporary injunction. Id.\n\n       This court agreed, holding the Vogts had failed to “establish a sufficient probability of\n\nirreparable injury in the absence of a temporary injunction” because Mr. Vogt admitted the\n\nobstruction of the easement did not completely deprive the Vogts of access to the one-acre\n\nparcel; they could access the one-acre parcel through their other tract of land, which was\n\ncontiguous to the one-acre tract.       Id. at *1-*2.     Because the Vogts would suffer only\n\ninconvenience if the injunction was lifted, they did not establish a sufficient probability of\n\nirreparable injury, an element that must be established to obtain a temporary injunction. Id. at\n\n*2. In rendering our decision, we noted that our review was confined to the validity of the trial\n\ncourt’s October 6, 2006 order. Id. at *1 (citing Reagan Nat’l Adver. v. Vanderhoof Family Trust,\n\n82 S.W.3d 366, 370 (Tex. App.—Austin 2002, no pet.)).\n\n       Marin contends that our holding in the temporary injunction opinion operates as law of\n\nthe case to preclude any award of injunctive relief. Marin argues that because this court found\n\nthe Vogts have alternate access to the one-acre tract through the nineteen-acre tract, there has\n\nbeen no change in the factual circumstances so as to permit injunctive relief. Marin claims the\n\nlaw of the case doctrine requires we sustain their first issue. Marin is incorrect.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 11 -\n\f                                                                                     04-10-00602-CV\n\n\n       Under the law of the case doctrine, a question of law previously decided on appeal\n\ngoverns a case throughout its subsequent stages. Jones & Gonzalez, P.C. v. Trinh, 340 S.W.3d\n\n830, 836 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2011, no pet.) (citing Hudson v. Wakefield, 711 S.W.2d 628,\n\n630 (Tex. 1986)); Lifshutz v. Lifshutz, 199 S.W.3d 9, 20 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2006, pet.\n\ndenied). The doctrine operates to narrow the issues in successive stages of litigation and is based\n\non goals of uniformity of decisions and judicial economy. Lifshutz, 199 S.W.3d at 20 (citing\n\nHudson, 711 S.W.2d at 630). The doctrine applies only to questions of law and not to questions\n\nof fact. Id. For example, in an earlier opinion in Trinh, this court had held Trinh breached a\n\nlease as a matter of law because he failed to obtain insurance coverage. Trihn v. Richter, No. 04-\n\n04-00644-CV, 2005 WL 2989278, *1 (Tex. App.—San Antonio Nov. 9, 2005, no pet.) (mem.\n\nop.). We remanded the matter to the trial court for further proceedings. Id. When the matter\n\nreturned to this court on appeal after proceedings on remand, we held the trial court erred in\n\nsubmitting the breach of lease issue to the jury on remand because we had already determined\n\nthat issue as a matter of law and it was the law of the case for all subsequent proceedings. Trinh,\n\n340 S.W.3d at 836.\n\n       In the matter before us, the issue that Marin claims is “law of the case” and should govern\n\nin this appeal was not a question of law previously decided by this court, but a finding that the\n\nVogts had failed to prove facts necessary to establish irreparable harm for purposes of the\n\ntemporary injunction.    There is nothing in our opinion to suggest we held there was no\n\nirreparable harm as a matter of law. We did not rule the evidence “legally insufficient,” which\n\nwould have invoked the doctrine. See Lifshutz, 199 S.W.3d at 20. A ruling on a question of law\n\nis essential to the applicability of the law of the case doctrine. Id. (citing Hudson, 711 S.W.2d at\n\n630). Accordingly, because we did not rule upon a question of law in our previous opinion, the\n\n\n\n                                               - 12 -\n\f                                                                                  04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nlaw of the case doctrine is inapplicable and the trial court did not commit a clear abuse of\n\ndiscretion in granting the permanent injunction based on Marin’s law of the case argument.\n\n       Moreover, the granting of the temporary injunction order and the subsequent appeal both\n\ntook place in 2006; the trial on the merits took place in 2009. Obviously, circumstances could\n\nhave changed or the Vogts could have presented different or more compelling evidence in 2009\n\nthan they did in 2006. Their failure or inability to present such evidence in 2006 is no bar to\n\npresentation of such evidence in 2009 in support of their request for a permanent injunction.\n\nClearly, facts and circumstances may change over the course of three years. See Persyn v.\n\nIshihara, 608 S.W.2d 279, 280 (Tex. Civ. App.—San Antonio 1980, no writ) (holding that\n\ngranting or refusing of temporary injunction is subject to “very different character of appellate\n\nreview” from granting or refusing of permanent injunction).\n\n       The foregoing challenge is the only challenge to injunctive relief contained in Marin’s\n\nopening brief. However, in its reply brief, Marin raises a myriad of other issues relating to the\n\npermanent injunction, including: (1) there is no evidence of irreparable harm that would allow\n\nthe award of a permanent injunction because the evidence shows the Vogts have other means to\n\naccess the one-acre tract; (2) there is insufficient evidence specifically describing the\n\nencroachments and the property boundaries so as to permit an award of a permanent injunction;\n\n(3) there is no jury question or finding regarding the true and correct location of the boundary\n\nline; (4) the uncontroverted evidence showed the encroachment of Marin’s culvert/drainage\n\nbasin extends onto a Texas Department of Highways right of way, not the easement, and\n\ntherefore the trial court erred in submitting jury question eleven; (5) the permanent injunction\n\nlacks “the necessary specificity for enforcement and violate[s] Rule 683 of the Texas Rules of\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 13 -\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nCivil Procedure”; and (6) the permanent injunction is unconstitutional because it is too vague to\n\nbe enforced.\n\n       We decline to address these issues. Although related to the award of injunctive relief, the\n\nissues Marin raises in the reply brief are wholly different from the single issue raised and argued\n\nin Marin’s opening brief, which only challenged the permanent injunction based on the law of\n\nthe case doctrine. See Bankhead v. Maddox, 135 S.W.3d 162, 164 (Tex. App.—Tyler 2004, no\n\npet.) (holding issues raised for first time in reply brief may not be considered, except perhaps in\n\nexceptional cases) (citing Krumb v. Porter, 152 S.W.2d 495, 496 (Tex. Civ. App.—San Antonio\n\n1941, writ ref’d)); see also Anderson Prod. Inc. v. Koch Oil Co., 929 S.W.2d 416, 424 (Tex.\n\n1996) (court declined to consider issue first raised in reply brief); Lopez v. Montemayor, 131\n\nS.W.3d 54, 61 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2003, pet. denied) (court declined to consider issue not\n\nraised in appellant’s original brief or raised in response to appellee’s brief). The many issues\n\nraised in Marin’s reply brief with regard to the permanent injunction were not raised in the\n\noriginal brief, and cannot be said to be responsive to the arguments contained in the Vogts’ brief,\n\nother than for the fact that they relate to the injunction. See Tex. R. App. P. 38.3 (stating\n\nappellant may file reply brief addressing any matter in appellee’s brief); Lopez, 131 S.W.3d at\n\n61. Accordingly, these issues are not properly before the court.\n\n                                           Loss of Use\n\n       In the charge, the jury was asked to determine the value of the Vogts’ loss of use of the\n\neasement from the date of the first encroachment to the present.             The jury answered,\n\n“$30,000.00.” Marin asserts the trial court erred in granting judgment for the Vogts on their loss\n\nof use claims because “there was no evidence or insufficient evidence that any of the\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 14 -\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nAppellants/Defendants were involved in the design, construction or placement of any structures\n\nor other constructions [sic] onto the easement or of damages for loss of use of easement.”\n\n                                 Design, Construction, Placement\n\n       In the jury charge, the jury was asked in questions one through nine if improvements\n\nfrom the eight lots in the development and the property owned by Marin encroached upon the\n\neasement owned by the Vogts. Marin seems to contend that even though the jury answered\n\n“yes” to each question, judgment could not be entered against it or the other property owners\n\nbecause there was no evidence any individual property owner “designed, constructed or placed\n\nany structures, improvements or other construction onto the easement.” Rather, the evidence at\n\ntrial showed only that the individual property owners, including Marin, purchased specific lots\n\nfrom the developer, Trada Partners. Thus, it seems Marin’s position is that a property owner\n\ncannot be responsible for loss of use even if his property encroaches upon the property of\n\nanother, rendering it useless, unless the property owner designed, constructed, or placed the\n\nencroachment on the property of another.\n\n       Marin does not cite any authority, nor have we found any, for the proposition that a\n\nproperty owner who encroaches upon the property of another must have designed, built, or\n\nplaced the encroachment on the other person’s property to be held liable for loss of use. And, in\n\nfact, the authority cited by the Vogts is contrary to Marin’s assertion.\n\n       In Allen v. Va. Hill Water Supply Corp., the defendant’s predecessor in title constructed a\n\nbuilding that encroached onto the adjacent lot owned by the plaintiff. 609 S.W.2d 633, 634\n\n(Tex. Civ. App.—Tyler 1980, no writ). When the defendant purchased his lot, he did not know\n\nthe building on the lot encroached upon the neighboring lot. Id. Nevertheless, he was sued by\n\nthe plaintiff and the trial court ordered him to remove the encroaching portion of the building and\n\n\n\n                                                - 15 -\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nto pay damages to the plaintiff. Id. On appeal, the defendant claimed, as Marin does here, he\n\nshould not be held liable for removing a building which he had no part in placing upon the\n\nplaintiff’s property. Id. Rejecting the defendant’s argument, the court of appeals held that even\n\nthough the building was built by the defendant’s predecessor in title and possession, the\n\ndefendant was required to remove the encroaching portion of the building and to pay the plaintiff\n\ndamages. Id. at 636.\n\n        Here, as in Allen, the fact that Trada Partners designed, built, and placed the\n\nencroachments on the easement does not absolve the individual property owners from liability to\n\nthe Vogts. See id. The mere fact of ownership of an encroaching structure is sufficient to\n\nestablish liability. See id.\n\n        In addition to the foregoing argument, Marin also makes a somewhat confusing\n\nargument, which is intertwined with the first argument, about the ambiguity of the verdict and its\n\ninsufficiency to support the judgment. Perhaps Marin is contending that because questions one\n\nthrough eight in the jury charge did not specifically ask the jury if the lot owned by a particular\n\nperson encroached upon the Vogts’ easement, i.e., “Did improvements on Lot 1 owned by X\n\nencroach on the Vogts’ easement?”, but merely asked if improvements on “Lot 1,” “Lot 2,” etc.\n\nencroached upon the easement, judgment against the specific landowners was improper. This\n\nargument is without merit.\n\n        First, this argument was not raised during the jury charge conference, or in either the\n\nmotion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or motion for new trial. Therefore, it has been\n\nwaived. See TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a). Substantively, there is a good reason Marin did not raise\n\nthe argument below, and we find it disingenuous that Marin chose to assert it on appeal. In the\n\ncourt below, Marin’s attorney, on behalf of Marin and the individual owners, and counsel for\n\n\n\n                                               - 16 -\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nVogt specifically agreed the encroachment claims against the individual lot owners would be\n\nsubmitted to the jury on a lot-by-lot basis rather than by using the name of the individual owner\n\nof the lot:\n\n        The Court: Counsel, before we bring the jury in, do you want to make that\n        stipulation in the record?\n\n        Mr. Schulte [Vogts’ counsel]: Yes, the parties have agreed as follows:\n\n        As to lots 1 through 8, we have stipulated that the owners of those lots are the\n        parties identified yesterday, Derra Edwards, Lot 1: Shees, Lot 2; Dresden &\n        Goldberg Investco, Lot 3; Leal Urgin is Lot 4; G2 Assets was Lot 5; The Boerne\n        Trust was Lot 6; Hugh Lam was Lot 7; and the Maganaris Trust was Lot 8.\n\n                                          *       *         *\n\n        The Court: Is that your stipulation, also, Mr. Prins?\n\n        Mr. Prins [Counsel for Marin]: Yes, it is, Judge.\n\n        The Court: On behalf of all your clients?\n\n        Mr. Prins: Yes.\n\n        The Court: And, likewise, the reason we are doing the stipulation on Lots 1\n        through 8, I don’t think you – references in proposed Question 1 through 8 in the\n        Court’s Charge deal with the encroachment of the easement or extension onto the\n        easement of the Vogts, and rather than name each person in each question, if there\n        is a finding of Lot 1 as referenced in the question, will pertain to that – that\n        particular owner as just stipulated to, Lot 2 and so forth. Is that understood,\n        counsel?\n\n        Mr. Prins: Yes.\n\n\n        Based on the exchange quoted above, Marin is complaining about alleged charge error\n\nand error in the judgment that occurred as a result of its own stipulation. Marin, through counsel,\n\nspecifically stipulated to submit the questions regarding encroachment onto the easement by lot\n\nnumber rather than by owner and agreed that any finding by lot number would relate to the\n\nspecific lot owner as stated in the stipulation–thereby justifying a judgment based on the lot\n\n                                                - 17 -\n\f                                                                                   04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nfinding.    This agreement entered in open court on the record amounts to a valid Rule 11\n\nagreement to which Marin is bound. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 11. With regard to question nine, it did\n\nnot submit the encroachment issue by lot, but asked if property owned by Marin encroached on\n\nthe easement. This jury finding clearly supports the judgment against Marin for loss of use.\n\nThus, contrary to Marin’s assertions, we need not speculate as to what the jury intended when\n\nanswering questions one through nine. Based on the jury findings and the parties’ stipulation,\n\nwe can determine exactly which property owned by which owner encroached, according to the\n\njury, on the Vogts’ easement. Thus, Marin’s argument is erroneous and unsubstantiated by the\n\nrecord.\n\n          With regard to the damage question, jury question number ten, if Marin is likewise\n\ncontending this submission was erroneous because it did not sufficiently tie damages to each\n\nindividual defendant, this claim is waived. See Barnett v. Coppell N. Tex. Court, Ltd., 123\n\nS.W.3d 804, 820 (Tex.

Marin did not object to the use\n\nof a broad form damage question for damages, nor did it request that damages be parsed into\n\nseparate questions for each individual property owner.\n\n\n\n                                              - 18 -\n\f                                                                                  04-10-00602-CV\n\n\n                                Insufficient Evidence of Damages\n\n       Although Marin broadly asserts there is no evidence or insufficient evidence as to\n\ndamages for loss of use, Marin wholly fails to argue this assertion. Marin merely states, with\n\nregard to damages: (1) “Appellants/Defendants also objected to Question 10 on the basis that\n\nthere was no evidence of damages that have been quantified for loss of use of easement[;]” and\n\n(2) “Further, the submission of Question 10 was improper because there was no evidence of\n\ninsufficient evidence of quantified damages for loss of use of easement.”        Marin’s actual\n\nargument is limited to the issues discussed above.\n\n       Accordingly, we hold Marin has waived its sufficiency challenge to the amount of\n\ndamages by failing to properly brief the issue. Rule 38.1(i) of the Texas Rules of Appellate\n\nProcedure requires an appellant’s brief to contain a clear and concise argument for the\n\ncontentions made. TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i). This requirement is not satisfied by conclusory\n\nstatements. Taylor v. Meador, 326 S.W.3d 682, 683 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2010, no pet.); see\n\nEastin v. Dial, 288 S.W.3d 491, 501 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2009, pet. denied) (holding\n\ncontention that affidavit in support of attorney’s fees was conclusory was waived for failure to\n\npresent argument or cite authority). A failure to provide substantive analysis of an issue waives\n\nthe complaint. Id.\n\n       As reflected in the description of Marin’s “argument” in support of its sufficiency claim\n\nas to damages for loss of use, Marin’s brief failed to meet the basic requirements of a clear and\n\nconcise argument containing substantive analysis. Rather, the brief contains three conclusory\n\nstatements (the description of the issue and the two statements set out above), each of which\n\nessentially says there was no evidence of damages. See, e.g., Garza v. Garza, No. 02-04-220-\n\nCV, 2005 WL 1047589, *1 n.2 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2005, pet. denied) (mem. op.) (holding\n\n\n\n                                              - 19 -\n\f                                                                                   04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nappellant’s one-sentence complaint that “the evidence is insufficient to support the judgment”\n\nwas waived based on inadequate briefing). Marin has therefore waived this portion of issue two\n\ndue to inadequate briefing. See generally Fredonia State Bank v. Gen. Am. Life Ins. Co., 881\n\nS.W.2d 279, 284 (Tex. 1994) (holding error may be waived by inadequate briefing).\n\n                                   Improper Double Recovery\n\n       Marin contends, in its third issue, that the trial court erred in awarding the Vogts both\n\ndamages for loss of use and a permanent injunction because it amounts to an improper double\n\nrecovery. Whether the Vogts received a double recovery is a question of law, and therefore in\n\nreviewing this issue, we conduct a de novo review. See In re Humphreys, 880 S.W.2d 402, 404\n\n(Tex. 1994) (holding questions of law are always subject to de novo review); George v. Price,\n\n321 S.W.3d 164, 166 (Tex. App.—Eastland 2010, no pet.) (same); Calstar Props., L.L.C. v. City\n\nof Fort Worth, 129 S.W.3d 433, 440 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2004, no pet.) (recognizing that\n\nwhether plaintiff received double recovery is question of law).\n\n       A party is entitled to bring suit and seek damages on alternative theories; however, the\n\nplaintiff may not recover on both theories because these would amount to a “double recovery.”\n\nWaite Hill Servs., Inc. v. World Class Metal Works, Inc., 959 S.W.2d 182, 184 (Tex. 1998);\n\nFoley v. Parlier, 68 S.W.3d 870, 882 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2002, no pet.). A double recovery\n\nexists when a plaintiff is awarded more than one recovery for the same injury. Waite Hill Servs.,\n\n959 S.W.2d at 184; Foley, 68 S.W.3d at 882-83. “Texas law does not permit double recovery.”\n\nParkway Co. v. Woodruff, 901 S.W.2d 434, 441 (Tex. 1995). The prohibition against double\n\nrecovery is a corollary to the one satisfaction rule, Foley, 68 S.W.3d at 883, which provides that\n\na plaintiff may recover only for the damages suffered as a result of a particular injury. Utts v.\n\nShort, 81 S.W.3d 822, 833 (Tex. 2002).\n\n\n\n                                              - 20 -\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00602-CV\n\n\n       In this case, the jury was asked to determine, in the event it found any encroachment\n\nupon the Vogts’ easement, what sum of money would compensate the Vogts for the loss of use\n\nof the easement. The jury was specifically instructed that in considering damages for the Vogts’\n\nloss of use, it should consider the value of the use from the date of the first encroachment to the\n\npresent. The jury was not asked about future damages for loss of use of the easement. Having\n\nfound there were encroachments upon the easement, the jury answered the loss of use damage\n\nquestion and found $30,000.00 would compensate the Vogts for their loss from the date of the\n\nfirst encroachment to the present. In its judgment, the trial court awarded the Vogts $30,000.00\n\nfor loss of use of the easement. The trial court also awarded the Vogts a permanent injunction,\n\nwhich required removal of the encroachments.\n\n       As noted above, the Vogts did not ask for future damages for their lost use of the\n\neasement. Rather, they sought only past damages. The permanent injunction, which required\n\nremoval of the encroachments, would negate any future losses based on an inability to use the\n\neasement because once the encroachments are removed, the Vogts will again be free to access\n\nthe easement. Accordingly, we hold there was no double recovery. The supreme court has\n\nspecifically recognized that only when a judgment awards “both an injunction and damages as to\n\nfuture effects” is there an impermissible double recovery. Schneider v. Nat’l Carriers, Inc. v.\n\nBates, 147 S.W.3d 264, 284 (Tex. 2004). In the absence of an award of future damages, there is\n\nno double recovery. See id. As one court of appeals recognized, an award of permanent\n\ninjunctive relief and past damages was not a double recovery because no future damages were\n\nawarded. F.S. New Prods., Inc. v. Strong Indus., Inc., 129 S.W.3d 606, 631-32 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2004), rev’d in part on other grounds, 221 S.W.3d 550 (Tex. 2006).\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 21 -\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00602-CV\n\n\n       These more recent cases, as noted in the Vogts’ brief, simply restate longstanding Texas\n\nlaw. As stated by the Second Court of Appeals in 1945, in a case rejecting the appellant’s\n\nargument that allowing the appellee to recover damages for past loss of value of their lands and\n\nto obtain a permanent injunction preventing future interference with that use was an improper\n\ndouble recovery:\n\n       There is no election of remedies in a case of this character. The equitable remedy\n       by injunctions to stop a wrong and remedy it, when it can be done, is not an\n       inconsistent remedy to the injured party’s right to have redress during the time the\n       wrong existed. In this state legal and equitable rights are blended and a choice of\n       remedies for either equitable or legal relief is not required in a case like this.\n\nCity of Wichita Falls v. Bruner, 191 S.W.2d 912, 920 (Tex. Civ. App.—Fort Worth 1945, writ\n\nref’d w.o.m.).\n\n       Marin’s complaint is identical to that rejected by the courts in F.S. New Prods. and\n\nBruner, and the trial court’s award of past damages and a future injunction is in line with the\n\nsupreme court’s statements in Bates. The Vogts were not awarded future damages and an\n\ninjunction; rather, they received damages to redress the time when they lost the use of their\n\neasement due to the encroachments, and injunction to prevent future loss of use. Accordingly,\n\nwe overrule this issue\n\n                                Admission of Expert Testimony\n\n       The Vogts alleged Trada Partners and Marin, through construction of the development,\n\ndiverted the natural flow of surface water in violation of the Texas Water Code, resulting in\n\ndamage to both the one-acre and nineteen-acre tracts.        In issues four through six, Marin\n\nchallenges the admission of expert testimony presented by the Vogts in support of this allegation.\n\n       In issues four and five, Marin challenges the admission of testimony from Wayne\n\nGodsey, a civil engineer who testified about surface water diversion, and Lonnie Marquardt, a\n\n\n\n                                              - 22 -\n\f                                                                                      04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nreal estate appraiser who testified about damages based on the alleged surface water diversion.\n\nIssue six seems to be nothing more than a general procedural complaint about the admission of\n\nthe expert testimony complained of in issues four and five. It seems that Marin is generally\n\narguing the Vogts failed to establish the admissibility of their experts’ testimony–that is precisely\n\nwhat is under review in issues four and five. Accordingly, issue six does not require separate\n\nreview. We will therefore proceed with our review of issues four and five.\n\n       “If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to\n\nunderstand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by\n\nknowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion\n\nor otherwise.” Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. v. Mendez, 204 S.W.3d 797, 800 (Tex. 2006) (quoting\n\nTEX. R. EVID. 702); see also Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 588-89 (1993).\n\nExpert testimony is admissible when the expert is qualified and his testimony is relevant and\n\nbased on a reliable foundation. Mendez, 204 S.W.3d at 800. If the expert’s scientific evidence is\n\nspeculative or unreliable, it is not evidence. Id. The trial court’s determination that these\n\nrequirements are met is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Id. A trial court abuses its discretion if\n\nit acts without reference to any guiding rules or principles. Id. Admitting expert testimony that\n\ndoes not meet the reliability requirement is an abuse of discretion. Id.\n\n       The supreme court has held that bare, baseless opinions will not support a judgment, even\n\nin the absence of an objection:\n\n       [A]lthough expert opinion testimony often provides valuable evidence in a case,\n       “it is the basis of the witness’s opinion, and not the witness’s qualifications or his\n       bare opinions alone, that can settle an issue as a matter of law; a claim will not\n       stand or fall on the mere ipse dixit of a credentialed witness.” Burrow v. Arce,\n       997 S.W.2d 229, 235 (Tex. 1999). Opinion testimony that is conclusory or\n       speculative is not relevant evidence, because it does not tend to make the\n       existence of a material fact “more or less probable.” See TEX. R. EVID. 401. This\n       Court has labeled such testimony as “incompetent evidence,” and has often held\n\n                                                - 23 -\n\f                                                                                       04-10-00602-CV\n\n\n        that such conclusory testimony cannot support a judgment. [citations omitted]\n        Furthermore, this Court has held such conclusory statement cannot support a\n        judgment even when no objection was made to the statement at trial. [citations\n        omitted]\n\nCity of San Antonio v. Pollock, 284 S.W.3d 809, 816 (Tex. 2009) (quoting Coastal Transp. Co.\n\nv. Crown Central Petrol. Corp., 136 S.W.3d 227, 232 (Tex. 2004)). The supreme court has held\n\nthat when testimony is challenged as conclusory or speculative, no objection is necessary\n\nbecause there is no need for the court to go beyond the face of the record to test its reliability. Id.\n\nOnly when the reliability of the expert’s testimony is challenged based on underlying\n\nmethodology, technique, or foundational data used by the expert is a timely objection required\n\nbecause then the trial court is required to go beyond the face of the record to determine\n\nreliability. Id.\n\n                                           Civil Engineer\n\n        In support of their claim of diversion, the Vogts proffered the testimony of Wayne\n\nGodsey to establish the actions of Trada Partners and Marin caused the surface water diversion\n\nthat allegedly resulted in flooding of the Vogts’ property. In issue four, Marin complains about\n\nthe admission of Wayne Godsey’s testimony, arguing the trial court erred in admitting Godsey’s\n\ntestimony because his causation opinion was “unreliable and based on a faulty foundation and\n\namounted to no more than a mere speculation and supposition.” The Vogts respond by arguing\n\n(1) Marin waived error by failing to object on the exact grounds raised on appeal, and (2)\n\ncontrary to Marin’s argument, Godsey’s testimony was not on the design of the drainage culvert\n\nso his failure to study the design plan or determine what caused the culvert to overflow is not\n\nfatal to his testimony.\n\n        First of all, with regard to waiver, the supreme court’s holding in Pollack disposes of the\n\nVogts’ claim that Marin has waived error with regard to Godsey’s testimony. We hold that\n\n                                                 - 24 -\n\f                                                                                   04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nMarin’s contention on appeal, and at trial, was that Godsey’s testimony was pure speculation.\n\nThis is the type of challenge for which an objection is not required because the court need look\n\nno further than the face of the record to determine the reliability of the expert’s opinion. See\n\nPollock, 284 S.W.3d at 816. Accordingly we must review this issue.\n\n       Godsey is a civil engineer with twenty-five years’ experience in civil engineering, design,\n\nplanning, and construction management, and owns a firm specializing in “drainage and\n\ninfrastructure design related with drainage and land development projects.” The firm’s work\n\nincludes surface water control, flood studies, and dam inspections and design. Godsey testified\n\nhe has been involved in a project similar to the Trada Partners’s development.\n\n       When he was first contacted by Mr. Vogt, he told him he would like to take a look at the\n\ndevelopment before agreeing to do any work on the Vogts’ behalf. He testified he and Mr. Vogt\n\ndrove around the project, which was still under construction, and at that time he noticed several\n\nareas that impacted historical drainage patterns relative to the Vogts’ property. After this first\n\ninspection, he agreed to work for the Vogts, stating he believed they had been impacted because\n\nof the development.\n\n       Godsey testified he conducted a site visit and inspection, and then reviewed construction\n\nplans for the development that Mr. Vogt provided and others that were on file with the City of\n\nBoerne. He reviewed drainage documents from Pape-Dawson, the engineering firm hired to\n\nwork on the development, which were provided by the Vogts’ attorney. He also received\n\ninformation from Mr. Vogt about the flooding and viewed pictures of the flooding. Godsey was\n\nadvised by Mr. Vogt that until the new development, the Vogts’ property had never flooded as it\n\ndid after the construction of the development.         Godsey testified Mr. Vogt told him that\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 25 -\n\f                                                                                      04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nhistorically there was a ditch that took surface water through the property upon which the\n\ndevelopment was built.\n\n       Godsey used a drainage flow diagram from the Pape-Dawson files to show the jury the\n\nhistorical flow of surface water before the development. According to Godsey, before the\n\ndevelopment, rainwater would drain off through the development tract, but by elevating portions\n\nof the development, the water flow was redirected so that the overflow drained onto the Vogts’\n\nproperty when, during a heavy rainfall, a culvert backed up. Godsey testified he viewed the\n\nproperty and observed the increase in elevation in relation to the Vogts’ property.\n\n       Godsey was also asked about a culvert that apparently backed up during a large\n\nrainstorm. Godsey testified based on his inspection and the information provided by Mr. Vogt\n\nand the documents he reviewed, there were several reasons the culvert may have overflowed.\n\nOn voir dire and during cross-examination, Godsey admitted he had not seen the culvert design,\n\nhad no opinion whether the design was improper because he had not seen it, and admitted any\n\nopinion he had on what might have happened was a “potential” opinion because he was unaware\n\nof the actual design of the culvert. Godsey also admitted he did not know why the culvert\n\nbacked up, and the only information he had regarding the culvert came from Mr. Vogt. He\n\nadmitted he knew nothing about the design of the culvert, had no knowledge if the culvert’s\n\ncapacity was exceeded, and could only speculate that the culvert had been blocked by debris.\n\nGodsey stated he could not opine on any other possible causes–other than those he relayed\n\nduring his direct testimony–but admitted he did not know what caused the culvert in this case to\n\nback up. He admitted his opinion on the cause of the back up in this case applies to any back up\n\nin any culvert.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 26 -\n\f                                                                                   04-10-00602-CV\n\n\n       Marin contends Godsey’s testimony is speculative and cannot support a finding of\n\ncausation because he cannot definitively say why the culvert backed up. The Vogts contend\n\nMarin has misinterpreted Godsey’s testimony. After a thorough and detailed review of Godsey’s\n\ntestimony, we agree with the Vogts.\n\n       Godsey’s opinion was that the Vogts’ property flooded because of an increase in\n\nelevation of the development relative to the Vogts’ property.       This testimony was neither\n\nspeculative nor otherwise unreliable. Godsey specifically testified the increase in elevation\n\naltered historical surface water drainage patterns, and his testimony was based on his own visual\n\ninspection of the property where he noted diversions from the historical drainage patterns due to\n\nincreases in elevation, as well as a drainage area map used by Pape-Dawson, the company that\n\nconstructed the development. Godsey opined that historically water drained back onto the\n\nproperty upon which the development was constructed, but Trada Partners and Marin “blocked\n\nthat flow” by increasing the elevation of the development in relation to the Vogts’ property,\n\nforcing the surface water to flood the Vogts’ property. We hold this testimony is neither\n\nspeculative nor unreliable, and is supported by a proper predicate and a proper foundation.\n\n       As for Marin’s claims about Godsey’s testimony regarding the culvert, we agree it is\n\nindeed speculative–Godsey could not say what actually blocked the culvert and caused it to\n\noverflow. However, we do not interpret Godsey’s testimony to suggest the culvert was the cause\n\nof the surface water diversion that resulted in the flooding of the Vogts’ property. As Godsey\n\nnoted, before the development, “the ground was lower and there was a ditch that headed off . . .\n\nand the water would just head off . . . through the baseball field property.” However, as a result\n\nof the development, the property was elevated, precluding historical run-off through the\n\ndevelopment property. Thus, we hold Godsey did not opine that the culvert caused the flooding;\n\n\n\n                                              - 27 -\n\f                                                                                     04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nrather, he opined that the increase in elevation due to construction of the development caused\n\nsurface water diversion that resulted in flooding of the Vogts’ property. We find Marin’s\n\ncomplaints about the speculative nature of the “culvert testimony” unconvincing and we overrule\n\nMarin’s challenge to Godsey’s testimony.\n\n                                      Real Estate Appraiser\n\n       Marin also complains the trial court erred in admitting the expert testimony of Lonnie\n\nMarquardt on the issue of damages for the alleged surface water diversion. Marin contends “his\n\nmethodology was improper, his opinion was based on a faulty foundation, and his opinion\n\namounted to no more than speculation and supposition.” Although this is the complaint stated in\n\nMarin’s fifth issue, a review of its argument reveals Marin is challenging the admission of\n\nMarquardt’s testimony based on improper methodology and lack of foundation.\n\n       The Vogts contend, as they did with regard to Godsey’s testimony, that Marin failed to\n\npreserve this issue for our review. Again, we disagree, but for a different reason. Because Marin\n\nis challenging the reliability of Marquardt’s testimony based on alleged improper methodology\n\nand lack of foundation, an objection was required. See Pollock, 284 S.W.3d at 816. However,\n\ncontrary to the Vogts’ assertion, Marin did object–in writing before trial and during Marquardt’s\n\ntestimony–in a manner sufficient to apprise the trial court of its complaints and allow the trial\n\ncourt to rule. See TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a). We will, therefore, review this issue.\n\n       Marquardt is an independent real estate broker and appraiser. He testified he is certified\n\nby the State, and has a “GAA,” which means he is a general accredited appraiser through the\n\nNational Association of Realtors. Marquardt stated he has been accepted as an expert appraiser\n\nfor the Texas Department of Transportation and numerous federal, district, and county courts in\n\nsouth Texas.\n\n\n\n                                               - 28 -\n\f                                                                                   04-10-00602-CV\n\n\n       Marquardt testified he was asked by the Vogts to evaluate whether their property–both\n\nthe one-acre and nineteen-acre tracts–have suffered a diminution in value. As to the one-acre\n\ntract, Marquardt was tasked with determining whether it had been devalued due to the loss of the\n\neasement and the potential for flooding. With regard to the nineteen-acre tract, he was only to\n\ndetermine any decrease in value based on the potential for flooding.\n\n       Marquardt stated that to make his determination, he performed what is known as a\n\n“before and after” analysis for each property. For the one-acre tract, Marquardt had to develop\n\nan estimate of the market value of the one-acre tract assuming legal ingress and egress provided\n\nby a twenty-foot wide passable easement and no surface water flooding. He would then develop\n\nan estimate of the market value of the one-acre tract as “landlocked” and prone to flooding due\n\nto significant surface water drainage. Marquardt specifically stated he developed his estimate\n\nbased on the one-acre tract as a property independent from the nineteen-acre tract. To develop\n\nhis estimate, he researched comparable sales in an attempt to find the best comparison possible.\n\n“Comparables,” according to Marquardt, are normally relied upon by appraisers in making these\n\ntypes of determinations. Marquardt also prepared his appraisal using the “highest and best use”\n\nanalysis, which requires the appraiser to consider what is the potential best use for the property\n\nbeing appraised, i.e., residential, commercial, agricultural, etc.\n\n       Using the foregoing methodology, Marquardt testified that the value of the one-acre tract\n\nbefore the loss of the easement and before it was subject to flooding was $2.00 per square foot,\n\nfor a total value of $79,366.32 given the size of the property. However, in the absence of a\n\npassable easement and a likelihood of flooding due to surface water diversion, the market value\n\nof the property fell to $0.20 per square foot, for a total value of $7,936.63. This meant a change\n\n\n\n\n                                                 - 29 -\n\f                                                                                   04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nin value due to the loss of the easement and the increased chance of flooding of $71,429.69. The\n\njury found the Vogts’ damages to be $71,000.00 for Marin’s alleged diversion of surface water.\n\n       Marquardt stated he used the same methodology for the nineteen-acre tract, and\n\ndetermined its value before the alleged increased potential for flooding to be $3.50 per square\n\nfoot, for a total value of $1,219,680.00. Marquardt indicated that in making this determination,\n\nthe highest and best use analysis called for him to consider only the eight acres on Highway 87\n\nfor commercial use–the remaining acreage was insignificant in this context. Marquardt then\n\ntestified the value of the nineteen-acre tract, given the flooding problems, decreased in value to\n\n$2.10 per square foot, for a total value of $731,808.00.       This was a change in value of\n\n$487,872.00, which was the exact amount awarded by the jury.\n\n       Marin first argues the trial court should have excluded Marquardt’s testimony because\n\ndiminution of value was the improper measure of damages, and therefore Marquardt’s opinion\n\nwas based on an improper foundation and methodology. Marin’s argument is based on its\n\ncontention that the damages to the Vogts’ property were “temporary” as opposed to\n\n“permanent.” However, we need not decide if Marquardt used an improper damage model\n\nbecause Marin failed to raise an issue on appeal challenging the jury’s findings that the damage\n\nto both the one-acre and nineteen-acre tracts was permanent.\n\n       Unchallenged jury findings are binding on this court. See Abatement, Inc. v. Williams,\n\n324 S.W.3d 858, 862 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2010, pet. denied); Carbona v. CH\n\nMed., Inc., 266 S.W.3d 675, 687 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2008, no pet.). Thus, the jury’s finding that\n\nthe damage to the one-acre and nineteen-acre tracts was “permanent” is binding on this court. Id.\n\nAnd, case law holds that diminution in value is the proper measure of damages for permanent\n\ninjury to land. Royce Homes, L.P. v. Humphrey, 244 S.W.3d 570, 577 (Tex. App.—Beaumont\n\n\n\n                                              - 30 -\n\f                                                                                  04-10-00602-CV\n\n\n2008, pet. denied); Mieth v. Ranchquest, Inc., 177 S.W.3d 296, 303 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st\n\nDist.] 2005, no pet.); Rocho v. U.S. Home/Homecraft Corp., 653 S.W.2d 53, 56 (Tex. App.—San\n\nAntonio 1983, writ ref’d n.r.e.). Accordingly, because the jury found the damage to the Vogts’\n\nland is permanent, and we are bound by this finding, the diminution in value model used by\n\nMarquardt was the proper measure of damages.\n\n       Marin also challenges the reliability of Marquardt’s testimony based on his considering\n\nof “highest and best use” given Mr. Vogts’ testimony that he did not intend to sell, develop, or\n\notherwise change the use of his property. However, Mr. Vogt explained that although he had no\n\npresent intention to sell the property, he was “just short of 80” and he did not mean to imply by\n\nhis testimony that his children or other successors in interest might have the same intentions.\n\nMoreover, Mr. Vogt testified he did not believe he could even sell the one-acre tract given the\n\nabsence of the easement.\n\n       Marin has not cited any authority, nor have we found any, to suggest that an appraiser\n\nmay not use “best and highest use” when appraising property for a diminution in value. In fact,\n\nin condemnation cases, the supreme court has held a factfinder may consider the highest and best\n\nuse of land in determining market value. Exxon Pipeline Co. v. Zwahr, 88 S.W.3d 623, 628\n\n(Tex. 2002). Moreover, in determining fair market value in condemnation proceedings, the\n\npreferred method is to use comparable sales, just as Marquardt did here, and in making that\n\ndetermination, consideration of highest and best use is proper. See City of Sugarland v. Home\n\nand Hearth Sugarland, L.P., 215 S.W.3d 503, 512 (Tex. App.—Eastland 2007, pet. denied). We\n\ncan find no reason to hold highest and best use inapplicable here, particularly given Marquardt’s\n\nundisputed testimony that appraised market value assumes “highest and best use” even if the\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 31 -\n\f                                                                                      04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nproperty is not currently being used that way, and there is “no such thing” as appraising based on\n\n“current use.”\n\n       The only authority cited by Marin simply recognizes that when valuing property using\n\ncomparables, the property used for comparison must actually compare to the property being\n\nvalued. See Guadalupe-Blanco River Auth. v. Kraft, 77 S.W.3d 805, 806-07 (Tex. 2002). In that\n\ncase, the court found the expert’s testimony unreliable because he did not use a comparable sale\n\nof property for his comparison; rather, he could not find a comparable sale, so he “reconfigured”\n\nthe client’s easement to a rectangular 3.2 acre tract and hypothetically “relocated” it to facilitate\n\nhis comparative analysis. Id. Here, there is no suggestion Marquardt did not use comparable\n\nsales or “reconfigured” the Vogts’ property because he was unable to find comparable sales.\n\nThus, the authority cited by Marin is inapplicable.\n\n       Next, Marin claims Marquardt’s testimony was unreliable because “he did not follow the\n\nmethodology necessary for the admission of appraisal evidence.” Marin is contending that\n\nbecause Marquardt did not prepare a complete appraisal report in accordance with the Uniform\n\nStandards of Professional Appraisal Practice (“USPAP”), which would have been twenty-five to\n\nthirty pages in length and contained certain information his summary report did not, Marquardt\n\ndid not use proper methodology, rendering his opinion unreliable. We disagree.\n\n       First, Marquardt specifically testified he did all the work necessary for a complete\n\nUSPAP report, he simply did not prepare a complete report, but instead prepared a summary\n\nreport. Marquardt described all of the items that would be in a full report as opposed to a\n\nsummary, e.g., identity of the client, intended users, intended use of appraisal, identify property,\n\nsigned certification, etc. Although he did not prepare a full report, Marquardt testified he used\n\nthe methodology required by the USPAP. The case cited by Marin to suggest Marquardt’s\n\n\n\n                                                - 32 -\n\f                                                                                     04-10-00602-CV\n\n\ntestimony was inadmissible is inapposite. See Bufkin v. Bufkin, 259 S.W.3d 343 (Tex. App.—\n\nDallas 2008, pets. denied). In that case, the court held the expert appraiser’s testimony regarding\n\nthe value of a ranch was properly stricken because he admitted using a method suggested by the\n\nattorney that was not proper under the USPAP and he had never valued real estate “that way”\n\nbefore. Id. at 351-52. Here, Marquardt used USPAP methodology, he simply did not prepare a\n\nfull report. Marin has cited no authority to suggest that the failure to prepare a specific kind of\n\nreport, when a summary report and testimony contains the necessary information required by the\n\naccepted methodology, renders an expert’s testimony unreliable.\n\n       Finally, Marin argues Marquardt’s testimony was unreliable and should have been\n\nexcluded because it was based on information provided by the Vogts, which was insufficient.\n\nWe disagree. Marquardt was asked to determine the value of damages assuming a lost easement\n\nand flooding–this is exactly what he did.\n\n                                    Surface Water Diversion\n\n       As previously noted, the Vogts sought damages for Marin’s alleged diversion of surface\n\nwater. In its seventh issue, Marin contends the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to\n\nsupport the jury’s findings of causation and damage with regard to this claim.\n\n       When reviewing a legal sufficiency or “no evidence challenge,” we determine “whether\n\nthe evidence at trial would enable reasonable and fair-minded people to reach the verdict under\n\nreview.” City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 827 (Tex. 2005). We view the evidence in\n\nthe light most favorable to the verdict, crediting favorable evidence if reasonable jurors could\n\nand disregarding contrary evidence unless reasonable jurors could not. Id. We must assume\n\njurors credited testimony favorable to the verdict and disbelieved testimony contrary to it.” Id. at\n\n819. We will sustain a legal sufficiency challenge when: (1) there is a complete absence of\n\n\n\n                                               - 33 -\n\f                                                                                      04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nevidence of a vital fact; (2) the court is barred by rules of law or evidence from giving weight to\n\nthe only evidence offered to prove a vital fact; (3) the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no\n\nmore than a mere scintilla; or (4) the evidence conclusively establishes the opposite of the vital\n\nfact. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc. v. Havner, 953 S.W.2d 706, 711 (Tex. 1997). In contrast, when\n\nreviewing a factual sufficiency challenge, we consider and weigh all the evidence supporting and\n\ncontradicting the finding. Plas-Tex, Inc. v. U.S. Steel Corp., 772 S.W.2d 442, 445 (Tex. 1989).\n\nWe will set aside the finding only if the evidence is so weak or the finding is so against the great\n\nweight and preponderance of the evidence that it is clearly wrong and unjust. Dow Chem. Co. v.\n\nFrancis, 46 S.W.3d 237, 242 (Tex. 2001). In undertaking either review, we are mindful that\n\njurors are the sole judges of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given their\n\ntestimony. City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 819. Jurors may choose to believe one witness and\n\ndisbelieve another. Id. We may not substitute our judgment for that of the jury, even if we\n\nmight reach a different answer based on the evidence. Id.\n\n                                             Causation\n\n       In challenging the sufficiency of the evidence supporting causation, Marin first contends\n\nthe speculative nature and basis of Godsey’s testimony–the only causation testimony with regard\n\nto surface water diversion–renders the evidence legally and factually insufficient. Because we\n\nhave held Godsey’s testimony was not speculative, and that it was based on more than anecdotal\n\nevidence, we hold this contention is without merit. Godsey’s testimony was based on more than\n\nMr. Vogts’ words and flooding photographs. Godsey based his testimony on his own experience\n\nregarding development of properties in light of surface water flow, his personal view of the\n\nproperties, and documents showing historical drainage patterns on the property.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 34 -\n\f                                                                                  04-10-00602-CV\n\n\n       Marin next contends that even if Godsey’s testimony is reliable, there is still “no\n\nevidence” of surface water diversion because Godsey’s testimony establishes the water that was\n\ndiverted was not “surface water” because the water allegedly diverted was controlled by a\n\nculvert. See TEX. WATER CODE ANN. § 11.086 (West 2008).\n\n       Section 11.086 of the Texas Water Code provides that no person may divert the natural\n\nflow of surface water in a manner that damages the property of another. Id. § 11.086(a). If a\n\nperson’s property is injured by an overflow of water caused by an unlawful diversion, that person\n\nmay seek remedies at law and in equity, including damages. Id. § 11.086(b).\n\n       Marin’s argument is based on its misplaced belief, as discussed with regard to the\n\nadmissibility of Godsey’s testimony, that the water that flooded the Vogts’ property was water\n\nfrom the culvert, and that the Vogts sought recovery because rainwater was improperly\n\ncontrolled by a ditch or culvert. Rather, the Vogts alleged surface water was diverted by an\n\nincrease in elevation, the building of earthen pads, and the deposit of debris and erection of\n\nbarriers. As we noted above, Godsey did not opine that the back up and overflow of water from\n\nthe culvert resulted in the flooding of the Vogts’ property. Rather, Godsey testified that when\n\nthe elevation of the development was increased relative to the Vogts’ property, historical\n\ndrainage patterns for surface water were altered and this caused the flooding. Thus, Godsey was\n\ntalking about surface water, i.e., water that is diffused over the ground from falling rain or\n\nmelting snow. See Dietrick v. Goodman, 123 S.W.3d 413, 419 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th\n\nDist.] 2004, no pet.). If anything, Godsey’s testimony was that surface water could not be\n\ncontrolled by the culvert because of the disparity in elevation between the development and the\n\nVogts’ property. Thus, we hold the evidence is legally sufficient to establish that the water\n\nwhich Godsey asserted flooded the Vogts’ property was not under the control of the culvert so as\n\n\n\n                                              - 35 -\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nto remove it from the category of surface water for purposes of section 11.086 of the Water\n\nCode. See id. (noting that chief characteristic of surface water is that it does not follow defined\n\ncourse or channel and does not gather into or form natural body of water). We hold this case\n\ninvolved a classic example of surface water – water diffused over the ground from falling rain –\n\ndiverted by a change in elevation because of the construction of the development. Accordingly,\n\nwe overrule this issue.\n\n                                            Damages\n\n       Marin also contends the evidence of damages for surface water diversion is insufficient–\n\nspecifically legally insufficient. Marin reurges its argument that the damage to the Vogts’ land\n\nby flooding, if any, was temporary, and therefore Marquardt used an improper damage model.\n\nFor the reasons discussed in the portion of the opinion reviewing the admissibility of\n\nMarquardt’s testimony, we overrule this issue.\n\n                                     Malicious Prosecution\n\n       In its eighth issue, Marin contends the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to\n\nsupport Mr. Vogts’ claim for malicious prosecution. We note Marin has not challenged, in any\n\nway, the jury’s damage award of $1,000,000.00 to Mr. Vogt based on his claim for malicious\n\nprosecution. Rather, Marin has challenged only certain elements of the claim. Specifically,\n\nMarin challenges the evidence to support the elements of procurement of prosecution, innocence,\n\nabsence of probable cause, and malice. We note that with regard to this issue, the jury finding in\n\nfavor of Mr. Vogt on malicious prosecution was against Marin only, not the individual property\n\nowners.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 - 36 -\n\f                                                                                     04-10-00602-CV\n\n\n                                       Standard of Review\n\n       The applicable standard of review is that previously stated for legal and factual\n\nsufficiency. See City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 827; Plas-Tex, Inc., 772 S.W.2d at 445; Dow\n\nChem. Co., 46 S.W.3d at 242. As always, we must remember jurors are the sole judges of the\n\ncredibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony, and may choose to believe\n\nsome witnesses and not others. City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 819.\n\n                                            Application\n\n       Texas courts have long recognized a cause of action for those unjustifiably subjected to\n\ncriminal proceedings, but has made it clear that such a cause of action, known as malicious\n\nprosecution, must sometimes yield to society’s interest in encouraging its citizens to report\n\ncrimes whether real or merely perceived. Kroger Tex. Ltd. P’ship v. Suberu, 216 S.W.3d 788,\n\n792 (Tex. 2006). The elements necessary to recover for malicious prosecution reflect a balance\n\nof these interests. Id. To recover for malicious prosecution, a plaintiff must prove: (1) a criminal\n\nproceeding was commenced against the plaintiff; (2) the defendant initiated or procured the\n\nproceeding; (3) the proceeding was terminated in the plaintiff’s favor; (4) the plaintiff was\n\ninnocent of the crime charged; (5) the defendant lacked probable cause to initiate the criminal\n\nproceeding; (6) the defendant acted with malice; and (7) the plaintiff suffered damages. Id.\n\n(citing Richey v. Brookshire Grocery Co., 952 S.W.2d 515, 517 (Tex. 1997)). The fifth and sixth\n\nelements protect a defendant from a jury’s “natural inclination” to punish a defendant who\n\nerroneously, but with cause and no malice, commenced criminal proceedings that resulted in an\n\nexoneration. Suberu, 216 S.W.3d at 792.\n\n       To understand the origins of the criminal proceedings against Mr. Vogt, we must begin\n\nwith the July 26, 2006 Rule 11 agreement between Trada Partners and the Vogts. After the\n\n\n\n                                               - 37 -\n\f                                                                                   04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nVogts filed suit, they entered into a Rule 11 agreement with Trada Partners concerning the\n\neasement. In the Rule 11 agreement, the parties agreed, among other things, that the Vogts\n\nowned the easement and were entitled to “repair and maintain the Easement at their discretion”\n\nas long as they did not “unduly interfere with the servient estate,” i.e., the development. In\n\nAugust 2006, when the easement became impassable due to the activities of Trada Partners and\n\nMarin, the Vogts’ counsel advised counsel for Trada Partners and Marin by letter that if the\n\neasement were not restored to allow ingress and egress, the Vogts would exercise their rights\n\nunder the Rule 11 agreement to maintain the easement themselves. When no action was taken,\n\nthe Vogts hired a contractor to return the easement to its original condition, and the Vogts’\n\ncounsel notified the attorney who represented Marin as well as Trada Partners of their intentions.\n\nIn response, the attorney for Trada Partners and Marin asked for the name of the contractor in\n\norder to coordinate activities.    The Vogts’ attorney disclosed the name of the contractor.\n\nThereafter, someone from Trada Partners contacted the contractor, Bradley Construction, and\n\nthreatened “immediate legal action” if during the work on the easement there was any\n\nimpediment to the construction process or any trespass on property outside the easement.\n\nBradley Construction was also advised that if it worked on the easement, it would have to\n\ncontact counsel for Trada Partners and Marin because he would need to “depose [the company]\n\nregarding [the] exact and complete scope of work” it intended to perform for the Vogts. The\n\ncontractor, fearing involvement in the pending legal proceedings, refused to do the work for the\n\nVogts, as did any other contractor in the area.\n\n       The Vogts then attempted to do the work themselves, which ultimately resulted in a\n\nSeptember 19, 2006 report of criminal mischief and criminal trespass by Daniel Hill, a\n\nconstruction assistant superintendent for Trada Partners, to the Boerne Police Department. Hill\n\n\n\n                                                  - 38 -\n\f                                                                                   04-10-00602-CV\n\n\ntold the investigator dirt had been moved onto Trada Partner’s property, and there was damage\n\nfrom excavation and to fencing along the easement. Hill advised that Trada Partners would file\n\ncharges or criminal trespass and criminal mischief against those involved. On September 21,\n\n2006, Mr. Vogt went to the police department to speak to the Chief of Police about the incident.\n\nMr. Vogt admitting moving the dirt from the easement, but advised that Trada Partners had no\n\nauthority to impede his use of the easement. It seems nothing came of this initial report; no\n\ncharges were filed.\n\n       However, on Friday January 11, 2008, a second report involving Mr. Vogt and the\n\neasement was made to the Boerne Police Department. Susan Rogers, a Trada Partners employee,\n\nand the construction superintendent, Salvador Feliciano-Piedra, met with an officer concerning a\n\nreport of criminal mischief. Feliciano-Piedra advised the investigator that someone had cut\n\nsection of a steel fence and used orange spray paint to paint “Xs” on curbs, sidewalks, trees, and\n\nair conditioning units. Feliciano-Piedra advised the investigator about the ongoing lawsuit with\n\nthe Vogts, and eventually provided a damage estimate of between $8,924.72 and $31,864.72.\n\n       The investigator spoke with some workers who apparently witnessed the spray painting,\n\nbut he also spoke with John Sieckert, who was an officer with Trada Partners and associated with\n\nMarin. Sieckert called to advise that charges would be filed against the person responsible.\n\nSieckert told the investigator “Vogt had already damaged some of their properties when they first\n\nstarted construction.” Sieckert said he suspected Vogt was responsible for this criminal mischief\n\nas well.\n\n       The investigator then spoke with Mr. Vogt and his son. They provided the investigator\n\nwith a copy of the Rule 11 agreement, which gave the Vogts the right to maintain the easement.\n\nMr. Vogt admitted spray painting encroaching curbs, sidewalks, trees, and air conditioning units\n\n\n\n                                              - 39 -\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nand cutting the fence, but advised that he took the action because the damaged items obstructed\n\nhis easement. Thereafter, the investigator spoke with the attorney, who represented both Trada\n\nPartners and Marin. The attorney advised the investigator that this court’s opinion lifting the\n\ntemporary injunction overturned the Rule 11 agreement and gave “them the right to build on the\n\neasement since there are other ways for the Vogts to access the back property.” See Trada\n\nPartners VI, 2007 WL 163181, at *1. This court’s opinion did not hold as counsel for Trada\n\nPartners and Marin claimed, nor did the opinion in any way suggest such a result. See id.\n\nRather, our opinion merely held the Vogts had failed to establish irreparable harm for purposes\n\nof the temporary injunction. Id. We certainly did not state or even intimate that the existing\n\nRule 11 agreement was no longer effective, nor did we state or intimate that encroachment upon\n\nthe Vogts’ easement was permitted. Id. Nevertheless, counsel for Trada Partners and Marin told\n\nthe investigator he believed “Trada could completely block the easement since there is other\n\naccess.”\n\n       The investigator wanted to speak with Sieckert again, so he called him, but Sieckert was\n\nout. Sieckert called back and the investigator asked him to provide an affidavit regarding the\n\nfiling of charges. Sieckert stated he would designate Rogers as his agent for purposes of the\n\naffidavit, and that he would call her and have her contact investigators. At Sieckert’s request,\n\nRogers provided an affidavit in which she stated Sieckert designated her as his agent for\n\npurposes of filing charges and that she did wish to file charges for the property damage.\n\n       Thereafter, the investigator, who had been in contact with the Kendall County District\n\nAttorney’s office, obtained an arrest warrant for Mr. Vogt for the offense of criminal mischief, a\n\nstate jail felony given the estimated amount of damages. Mr. Vogt turned himself in, was\n\narrested, fingerprinted, and had his mug shot taken. Although Mr. Vogt was ultimately “no-\n\n\n\n                                               - 40 -\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nbilled” by the grand jury, he testified that as a former Chief Deputy Sheriff and constable, he was\n\nextremely embarrassed by the arrest, especially after his mug shot was broadcast on television\n\nand counsel for Trada Partners and Marin talked about the case on the news of a San Antonio\n\ntelevision station.\n\n        1. Procurement\n\n        Marin first argues there is no evidence or insufficient evidence to establish Marin\n\ninstigated or procured any criminal proceeding against Mr. Vogt. According to the Texas\n\nSupreme Court, procurement, which is the causation element of a malicious prosecution action,\n\noccurs when a person’s actions are enough to cause the prosecution, and but for the person’s\n\nactions the prosecution would not have occurred. Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc. v. Lieck, 881\n\nS.W.2d 288, 293 (Tex. 1994). A person does not procure a prosecution, however, when the\n\ndecision to prosecute is left to the discretion of a law enforcement official or grand jury unless\n\nthe person provides information he knows is false. Id.; King v. Graham, 126 S.W.3d 75, 78\n\n(Tex. 2003).\n\n        Marin argues the only evidence shows a Trada Partners employee, Rogers, made the call\n\nin January 2008 that led to the arrest of Mr. Vogt; Marin had nothing to do with it. However, as\n\nthe Vogts point out, although a Trada Partners employee did make the initial call, there was\n\ninvolvement by Marin agents as well, specifically Marin’s attorney and Sieckert, and Trada\n\nPartners’s involvement does not permit Marin to escape liability because a criminal prosecution\n\nmay be procured by more than one person. Lieck, 881 S.W.2d at 293; Daniels v. Kelly, No. 04-\n\n09-00817-CV, 2010 WL 2935789, at * 4 (Tex. App.—San Antonio Jul. 28, 2010, no pet.) (mem.\n\nop.).\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 41 -\n\f                                                                                   04-10-00602-CV\n\n\n       A malicious prosecution action against a corporate entity may be based on an agent\n\ntaking action to procure a prosecution. See Eans v. Grocery Supply Co., 580 S.W.2d 17, 21-22\n\n(Tex. Civ. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1979, no writ) (malicious prosecution judgment upheld\n\nagainst corporation based on actions of corporate employees). There is evidence in the record\n\nshowing the attorney, who represented not only Trada Partners but also Marin, provided\n\nextensive, but false, information to the Boerne Police Department investigator, essentially\n\nadvising him that Mr. Vogt had no right to the easement after our opinion in the temporary\n\ninjunction case. Additionally, Sieckert was involved in procuring the prosecution of Mr. Vogt.\n\nSieckert was not only a principal in Trada Partners, but according to evidence in the record, also\n\ninvolved in the operation of Marin. The Vogts’ exhibit 53, which was admitted into evidence, is\n\na letter from the Kendall County Abstract Company to “Mr. John W. Sieckert” at “Marin Real\n\nEstate Partners, LP,” enclosing a title commitment regarding the purchase of property in the\n\ndevelopment. And, Mr. Vogt testified it was his understanding that Sieckert “was also involved\n\nwith Marin Partners.” Marin never introduced any evidence to suggest Sieckert was not a\n\nprincipal or agent of Marin. Thus, there is some evidence Sieckert was associated not only with\n\nTrada Partners, but with Marin. Sieckert designated Rogers as his agent for the purposes of\n\nprocuring charges against Mr. Vogt by the submission of an affidavit. Moreover, Sieckert\n\nadvised the investigator that he wanted charges filed against the perpetrator and told the\n\ninvestigator “Vogt had already damaged some of their properties when they first started\n\nconstruction,” and he suspected Vogt was responsible for this criminal mischief as well.\n\n       Accordingly, we hold there is evidence a reasonable jury could have credited in order to\n\nfind Marin, along with Trada Partners, procured the prosecution, and that the evidence is not so\n\nweak as to render the jury’s verdict unjust.\n\n\n\n                                               - 42 -\n\f                                                                                     04-10-00602-CV\n\n\n       Marin posits a second argument as to procurement, stating that even if Marin did take\n\naction in assisting the investigator, there is still no evidence of procurement because it was up to\n\nlaw enforcement to decide whether to arrest and prosecute Mr. Vogt. Marin correctly points out,\n\nas noted above, a person does not procure a prosecution when the decision to prosecute is left to\n\nthe discretion of a law enforcement official or grand jury. Id.; King v. Graham, 126 S.W.3d 75,\n\n78 (Tex. 2003). However, if a person knowingly provides false information to those responsible\n\nfor procuring the prosecution, the person has procured the prosecution for purposes of a\n\nmalicious prosecution action.     Id.   This exception is satisfied not only when actual false\n\ninformation is provided, but when the reporting person fails to report facts that might establish\n\nthe accused is not guilty of any offense. Eans, 580 S.W.2d at 20 (holding circumstantial\n\nevidence was sufficient for jury to have concluded corporation procured prosecution where\n\nreporting persons failed to disclose material facts favorable to accused).\n\n       We hold there is sufficient evidence in this case to establish the attorney for Marin and\n\nSieckert, as an agent for Marin, knowingly provided false information to the investigator, thereby\n\ntriggering the “false information” exception. No attorney could have reasonably believed that\n\nour opinion in the temporary injunction case (1) overturned the Rule 11 agreement, which\n\npermitted the Vogts to remove encroachments on their easement, or (2) allowed Trada Partners\n\nor any other entity to encroach at will upon the easement. And, the jury could have found false\n\nthe statement provided by counsel for Trada Partners and Marin that the Vogts had been\n\nprovided a paved route to the one-acre tract, but refused to use it. Mr. Vogt testified at trial the\n\nhe did not receive a key to the gate on the paved road until a month before the 2009 trial, and he\n\ndid not receive the code for the gate at the other end of the paved road until he testified at trial\n\nthat he did not have the code. All of this was long after counsel for Trada Partners and Marin\n\n\n\n                                               - 43 -\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nprovided information to the investigator in 2008. Additionally, Sieckert advised the investigator\n\nin a phone call that Mr. Vogt had previously damaged “their properties,” which the jury could\n\nhave found was false based on Mr. Vogt’s testimony.          Mr. Vogt specifically testified the\n\ninformation provided by Sieckert was untrue, as was the information provided by the attorney.\n\n       Based on the foregoing, we hold there is evidence a reasonable jury could have credited\n\nin order to find that the attorney for Trada Partners and Marin and Sieckert, as agents of Marin,\n\nprovided false information to authorities, thereby placing Marin within the exception to the rule\n\nthat procurement is negated if the prosecution is actually instituted by law enforcement.\n\n       2. Innocence\n\n       Marin next argues the evidence is legally and factually insufficient as to the element of\n\ninnocence. Marin contends the grand jury’s failure to indict Mr. Vogt is insufficient to establish\n\nhis innocence, arguing the Vogts were required to provide more proof. Marin argues the Vogts\n\ncannot provide such evidence because Mr. Vogt admitted “vandalizing” the property, but simply\n\nescaped prosecution for his crime.\n\n       A person commits the offense of criminal mischief if, without the effective consent of the\n\nowner, he intentionally or knowingly damages, destroys, tampers with, or makes markings on the\n\nowner’s tangible property. TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. § 28.03 (West 2011) (emphasis added). We\n\nhold there is evidence from which the jury could have determined Mr. Vogt did not act “without\n\nthe effective consent of the owner” when he cut the fence and spray painted the items\n\nencroaching upon his easement.\n\n       At trial, the Vogts introduced the Rule 11 agreement, which was signed by counsel for\n\nTrada Partners and Marin. Pertinent portions of the agreement were read to the jury, specifically\n\nthose portions recognizing the Vogts’ ownership of the easement and their right to “repair and\n\n\n\n                                               - 44 -\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nmaintain the Easement at their discretion so long as not to unduly interfere with the servient\n\nestate.” And, contrary to counsel’s assertion, our opinion in the temporary injunction appeal did\n\nnot vacate or otherwise overturn this agreement. See Trada Partners VI, 2007 WL 163181, at\n\n*1. In fact, the Rule 11 agreement is not mentioned anywhere in our opinion. Id. Mr. Vogt\n\ntestified that he took the actions he did in January of 2008, cutting the fence and marking\n\nsidewalks, curbs, and air conditioning units, in preparation for removing them from the\n\neasement.\n\n       We hold, based on the Rule 11 agreement and Mr. Vogt’s testimony, there was sufficient\n\nevidence, both legally and factually, for the jury to answer Question 18. More specifically, the\n\njury could have found, pursuant to the Rule 11 agreement, that Mr. Vogt had the consent of the\n\nowner to take the actions he did, especially given that all of the items cut and marked were on the\n\neasement, and not on the servient estate.\n\n       In two sentences, Marin also complains that because there was no issue submitted to the\n\njury on “innocence,” the trial court erred in rending judgment for the Vogts on the malicious\n\nprosecution claim. First, the trial court used broad form submission, as required by Texas law.\n\nSee TEX. R. CIV. P. 277 (stating broad form submission shall be used whenever feasible); see\n\nalso Romero v. KPH Consol., Inc., 166 S.W.3d 212, 230 (Tex. 2005) (reaffirming use of broad\n\nform submission whenever practicable). This is true even after the court’s decisions in Crown\n\nLife Ins. Co. v. Casteel, 22 S.W.3d 378 (Tex. 2000) and Harris County v. Smith, 96 S.W.3d 230\n\n(Tex. 2002). See Romero, 166 S.W.3d at 226 (recognizing that in certain cases broad from\n\nsubmission is not appropriate, e.g., invalid theories of liability or damages submitted with valid\n\ntheories of liability in a single broad form question). As recognized by the supreme court, broad\n\nform submission must be used unless extraordinary circumstances exist. Tex. Dep’t of Human\n\n\n\n                                               - 45 -\n\f                                                                                      04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nServs. v. E.B., 802 S.W.2d 647, 649 (Tex. 1990). Second, the malicious prosecution charge\n\ngiven to the jury was the long-standing charge contained in the Texas Pattern Jury Charge. See\n\nSTATE BAR    OF   TEX., TEXAS PATTERN JURY CHARGES–GENERAL NEGLIGENCE, INTENTIONAL\n\nPERSONAL TORTS, PJC 6.4 (2010). Although the Texas Pattern Jury Charges are a guide and not\n\nbinding on the court, well-settled pattern jury charges should not be embellished with addendum.\n\nH.E. Butt Grocery Co. v. Bilotto, 928 S.W.2d 197, 201 (Tex. 1996); Weeks Marine, Inc. v.\n\nSalinas, 225 S.W.3d 311, 319 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2007, pet. dism’d). Marin has not\n\nargued the current jury charge is insufficient.\n\n       Moreover, Marin did not object based on the absence of an issue, instruction, or\n\ndefinition of “innocence,” nor did it submit in writing a substantially correct issue, instruction, or\n\ndefinition. Thus, Marin has waived any complaint. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 274 (requiring party\n\nobjecting to charge to point out distinctly objectionable matter and grounds for objection; in\n\nabsence of proper objection, error is waived); see also Ford Motor Co. v. Ledesma, 242 S.W.3d\n\n32, 43 (Tex. 2007) (recognizing requirements of Rule 274); Sears Roebuck & Co. v. Abell, 157\n\nS.W.3d 886, 892 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2005 pet. denied) (holding Rule 274 is to be strictly\n\nconstrued, requiring objections to jury charge to specify error and legal basis of objection).\n\nAccordingly, Marin’s complaint is overruled.\n\n       3. Probable Cause\n\n       Marin next challenges the sufficiency of the evidence on the element of probable cause.\n\nMarin correctly points out that a malicious prosecution case begins with the presumption that the\n\ndefendant acted reasonably and had probable cause to initiate the prosecution. See Suberu, 216\n\nS.W.3d at 793. However, the plaintiff can rebut this presumption by producing evidence that the\n\nmotives, grounds, beliefs, or other information upon which the defendant acted did not constitute\n\n\n\n                                                  - 46 -\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nprobable cause.    Id.   Marin contends the Vogts failed to produce evidence to rebut the\n\npresumption that Marin had probable cause to report Mr. Vogt for the offense of criminal\n\nmischief. Marin also points out that when it reasonably appears to a citizen that a crime has been\n\ncommitted, the citizen has no duty before filing charges to inquire as to whether the suspect\n\nmight have had an alibi or explanation for his action. See id. at 794; First Valley Bank v. Martin,\n\n144 S.W.3d 466, 470 (Tex. 2004).\n\n       Marin is correct regarding the presumption and the absence of duty to inquire as to why\n\nthe person against whom charges are filed acted as he did. However, the Vogts counter that the\n\nrecord is replete with evidence they produced showing Marin filed charges against Mr. Vogt not\n\nbecause they sincerely believed he had committed criminal mischief, but because Marin and\n\nTrada Partners, through their agents, were doing anything and everything in their power to\n\nintimidate the Vogts into giving up their easement and to gain an advantage against the Vogts in\n\nthe civil suit. Thus, according to the Vogts, they rebutted the presumption, the burden shifted to\n\nMarin to establish probable cause, and the issue became one for the jury. See Thrift v. Hubbard,\n\n974 S.W.2d 70, 79 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1998, pet. denied).\n\n       The Vogts point to evidence showing: (1) Sieckert’s hostility toward the Vogts–“If you\n\nthink . . . we’re going to change our plans because you say that’s your easement . . . you’re\n\ngreatly mistaken.”; (2) Sieckert’s increasing frustration with the Vogts’ refusal to give up the\n\neasement, e.g., Sieckert’s statement to Pape-Dawson Construction about the Vogts’ complaints\n\nand attempts to stop the development; (3) intimidation of a contractor who planned to assist the\n\nVogts in clearing the easement; (4) Sieckert’s knowledge from the outset that the Vogts owned\n\nthe easement; (5) the Rule 11 agreement, memorializing the Vogts’ rights to use and maintain the\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 47 -\n\f                                                                                   04-10-00602-CV\n\n\neasement; and (6) the provision of false evidence to authorities by Sieckert and counsel for Trada\n\nPartners and Marin during the criminal mischief investigation.\n\n       This is certainly some evidence rebutting the presumption that Marin filed charges\n\nagainst Mr. Vogt simply because he cut some fencing and spray painted sidewalks and air\n\nconditioning units belonging to Trada Partners and Marin. The jury could have believed filing\n\ncharges was the culmination of a campaign by Trada Partners and Marin to wrest the easement\n\nfrom the Vogts by whatever means possible. See, e.g., Thrift, 974 S.W.2d at 79-80 (holding jury\n\ncould have found defendant filed criminal complaint “to gain an advantage in the civil litigation\n\nstemming from these same facts.”).      And although we recognize a person has no duty to\n\ninvestigate if there was some reason to justify an accused’s action, Marin had no need to\n\ninvestigate in this case because it knew Mr. Vogt was simply doing what he had been trying to\n\ndo all along–retain the use of his easement and maintain it for use as permitted under the Rule 11\n\nagreement. See Suberu, 216 S.W.3d at 794; Martin, 144 S.W.3d at 470.\n\n       Marin did not present any testimony to establish probable cause once the Vogts presented\n\nevidence rebutting the presumption. In fact, the only evidence presented by Marin was the\n\ntestimony of a single property owner who testified she did not design or develop anything, but\n\nsimply purchased the property as an investment. Accordingly, we hold there was evidence from\n\nwhich the jury could have found an absence of probable cause.\n\n       4. Malice\n\n       Finally, Marin contends there was no evidence or insufficient evidence of malice by\n\nMarin. Marin argues that because it had a legal right to report Mr. Vogt’s vandalism, there can\n\nbe no finding of malice. See Closs v. Goose Creek Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist., 874 S.W.2d 859,\n\n878 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 1994, no writ) (holding that summary judgment evidence\n\n\n\n                                              - 48 -\n\f                                                                                      04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nestablished ranger with DPS did not act with malice because he was “charged with the duty to\n\ninvestigate reported criminal activity” and averred his actions were not undertaken for improper\n\npurpose but only in capacity as ranger).\n\n         A person acts with malice in a malicious prosecution case when he acts with ill will or\n\nevil motive to the injury of another, or acts in reckless disregard of the rights of another and with\n\nindifference as to whether the other person is injured so as to amount to wanton and willful\n\naction knowingly and unreasonably done. Id. Malice can be established by either direct or\n\ncircumstantial evidence and may be inferred from a lack of probable cause. Thrift, 974 S.W.2d\n\nat 80.\n\n         Of course a person has the legal right to report a crime. See Closs, 874 S.W.2d at 878.\n\nHowever, if a person reports a crime with an improper purpose, or in reckless disregard of the\n\nrights of another in a knowing and unreasonable manner, that is malice. Id. With regard to this\n\ncase, given the evidence that Marin lacked probable cause to report Mr. Vogt, and that it acted to\n\nintimidate the Vogts or gain an advantage in the civil suit, the jury could have inferred Marin\n\nacted with “ill will or evil motive.” Moreover, malice is shown by the false statements provided\n\nto investigators by Sieckert and counsel for Trada Partners and Marin regarding Mr. Vogt’s prior\n\nactions and the status of the Vogts’ rights to the easement, as well as their failure to disclose the\n\nexistence of the Rule 11 agreement and the Vogts’ rights thereunder when first questioned by the\n\ninvestigator. See, e.g., Richey, 952 S.W.2d at 519-20 (holding that in malicious prosecution\n\naction, failing to fully and fairly disclose all relevant facts or knowingly providing false\n\ninformation to police is relevant to malicious intent of defendant); Thrift, 974 S.W.2d at 80\n\n(holding defendant’s failure to disclose exculpatory facts was sufficient to demonstrate malice).\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 49 -\n\f                                                                                     04-10-00602-CV\n\n\n       Based on the standards of review, the applicable law, and the evidence, we hold there was\n\nsufficient evidence, which the jury could have credited and believed, to sustain the Vogts’ claim\n\nfor malicious prosecution. As previously noted, jurors are the sole judges of the credibility of the\n\nwitnesses and the weight to be given their testimony, and may believe one witness and not\n\nanother. City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 819.\n\n                           Effect of Default Judgment Against Trada\n\n       As noted above, when the trial court called the case for trial on May 5, 2009, Trada\n\nPartners, which had filed an answer, failed to appear. The case proceeded to trial and verdict\n\nwithout Trada Partners. Thereafter, on October 12, 2009, the trial court entered a default\n\njudgment against Trada Partners and in favor of the Vogts. The default judgment recites that it\n\n“disposes of all issues and claims as between John E. Vogt and Nelda L. Vogt and Trada\n\nPartners VI, LP.” The judgment further states that it is severed, but failed to assign a separate\n\ndocket number.\n\n       Marin suggests, in its ninth issue, that the rendition of the default judgment against Trada\n\nPartners and the subsequent rendition of a separate judgment disposing of the Vogts’ claims\n\nagainst Marin violates the “one judgment rule” contained in Rule 301 of the Texas Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure. In support of its contention, Marin argues the default judgment was a final judgment,\n\nand given the absence of a severance, the subsequent rendition of judgment against Marin was\n\nprohibited by Rule 301.\n\n       First, there is nothing in the record showing Marin raised this issue in the trial court.\n\nAlthough we have found no cases specifically holding that a complaint involving violation of the\n\n“one judgment rule” requires an objection in the trial court before it can be asserted on appeal,\n\nRule 33.1(a) of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure states that before a complaint can be\n\n\n\n                                               - 50 -\n\f                                                                                     04-10-00602-CV\n\n\npresented for appellate review, the record must show the complaint was presented to the trial\n\ncourt by “timely request, objection, or motion” that states the ground for the ruling sought with\n\nsufficient specificity to make the trial court aware of the complaint, and the trial court ruled.\n\nTEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a). The only exceptions to the preservation requirement of Rule 33.1(a) in\n\ncivil cases are rare instances of “fundamental error,” which the supreme court has held includes\n\ncases in which the face of the record shows the court lacked jurisdiction or in certain types of\n\nerror in juvenile delinquency cases. In re B.L.D., 113 S.W.3d 340, 350 (Tex. 2003). Even\n\nconstitutional error can be waived if not raised in the trial court. See In re L.M.I., 119 S.W.3d\n\n707, 711 (Tex. 2003); City of San Antonio v. Schautteet, 706 S.W.2d 103, 104 (Tex. 1986) (per\n\ncuriam). Given Marin’s failure to bring this issue to the attention of the trial court, any error is\n\nwaived. However, even if Marin had not waived this issue, it has no substantive merit.\n\n       Substantively, Marin contends there was no severance in this case, making the October\n\n12, 2009 default judgment the “sole final judgment,” and thereby precluding the subsequent\n\njudgment rendered in April 2010 against Marin. Marin is incorrect.\n\n       When the trial court rendered the default judgment against Trada Partners, it specifically\n\nstated in the judgment that the judgment against Trada Partners “is hereby severed from this\n\ncause.” Marin seems to contend this was not effective to sever the Vogts’ claims against Trada\n\nPartners from the remainder of the suit because: (1) there was no separate severance order, or the\n\nlanguage in the judgment was somehow conditional; and (2) the trial court failed to include a\n\ndocket number in the judgment for the severed cause, rendering the severance ineffective.\n\n       First, Marin has cited no authority for the proposition that a severance must be contained\n\nin an order separate from the judgment. There is nothing in Texas law to prohibit a trial court\n\nfrom including a severance order within the judgment to be severed–in fact, this is quite\n\n\n\n                                               - 51 -\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00602-CV\n\n\ncommon. Moreover, the language in the trial court’s order was not conditional; rather, the court\n\nspecifically ordered the judgment against Trada Partners severed from the Vogts’ claims against\n\nthe remaining defendants. Accordingly, the severance was not ineffective for either of these\n\nreasons.\n\n       Nor is the severance ineffective because it failed to assign a docket number to the severed\n\ncause. Although the judgment stated it was assigned a new docket number, the blank for the new\n\ndocket number was not filled in, i.e., no new docket number was assigned to the severed cause.\n\nThe supreme court has held the granting of a severance is effective when signed. McRoberts v.\n\nRyals, 863 S.W.2d 450, 452-53 (Tex. 1993); Finlan v. Peavy, 205 S.W.3d 647, 651 (Tex. App.—\n\nWaco 2006, no pet.). The severance becomes effective without the district clerk’s assignment of\n\na new docket number and without the creation of a separate physical file. Id. Moreover, the\n\nseverance is effective immediately whether or not the clerk ever creates a physically separate file\n\nor assigns a new number to it. Id. Accordingly, the severance was not ineffective for the trial\n\ncourt’s failure to assign a separate docket number to the severed cause. See id.\n\n       Therefore, contrary to Marin’s assertions, there was an effective severance. The question\n\nthen becomes, what effect does an effective severance have on Marin’s “one judgment rule”\n\nargument? The answer: it defeats it.\n\n       A severance divides a lawsuit into two or more separate and independent causes that may\n\nbe resolved separately. In re Liu, 290 S.W.3d 550, 519-20 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2009, no\n\npet.) (citing Hall v. City of Austin, 450 S.W.2d 836, 837-38 (Tex. 1970)). When a severance is\n\ngranted, the separated causes proceed to individual judgments–judgments that are separately\n\nfinal and appealable. Liu, 290 S.W.3d at 520 (citing Hall, 450 S.W.2d at 838); see Van Dyke v.\n\nBoswell, O’Toole, Davis & Pickering, 697 S.W.2d 381, 383 (Tex. 1985). In other words, after a\n\n\n\n                                               - 52 -\n\f                                                                                04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nseverance, there are two separate causes resulting in two separate judgments. Accordingly, the\n\n“one judgment rule,” which states “one final judgment shall be rendered in any cause” is not\n\nimplicated because there are two causes with separate judgments.\n\n       Because there was an effective severance, the “one judgment rule” is not implicated, and\n\ntherefore Marin’s argument is without merit and the issue is overruled.\n\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n       Based on the foregoing, we overrule all of Marin’s issues and affirm the trial court’s\n\njudgment in favor of the Vogts.\n\n                                                 Marialyn Barnard, Justice\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 53 -\n\f",

The issues\n\ninclude challenges to: the sufficiency of the evidence, the award of injunctive relief, the\n\nadmission of expert testimony, and the viability of judgment following a default judgment\n\nagainst one of the original defendants. We affirm the trial court’s judgment.\n\n                                         BACKGROUND\n\n       In the early 1950s, the Vogts purchased a nineteen-acre tract of land in Kendall County,\n\nTexas. The couple has lived on this property since it was purchased. In 1975, the Vogts\n\npurchased an adjacent 0.911-acre tract (“the one-acre tract”). The Vogts’ deed to the one-acre\n\ntract expressly granted the Vogts a twenty-foot easement for ingress and egress from the\n\nhighway to the one-acre tract. This easement was the only way for the Vogts to access the one-\n\nacre tract without trespassing or driving through a field and across a drainage ditch on the\n\nnineteen-acre tract.\n\n       In 2005, a real estate developer, Trada Partners VI, LP, purchased the property adjoining\n\nthe Vogts’ one-acre tract. The property purchased by Trada Partners adjoined the Vogts’ twenty-\n\nfoot easement. The City of Boerne notified the Vogts about a public meeting scheduled to\n\ndiscuss Trada Partners’s rezoning request with regard to the property. Trada Partners wanted to\n\nbuild a development on the property, which was to be called The Village at Stone Creek. The\n\ndevelopment would consist of thirty-two four-plex apartment buildings. At the time of the\n\npurchase, the adjoining property contained a few buildings and a baseball field.\n\n       According to the Vogts, at the public meeting they met John Sieckert who was either the\n\npresident or vice president of Trada Partners. Mr. Vogt testified he welcomed Sieckert to the\n\nneighborhood and advised him about the twenty-foot easement. According to Marin, Mr. Vogt\n\n\n\n                                               -2-\n\f                                                                                               04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nagreed to swap his easement for another easement to be provided as part of the new\n\ndevelopment. The new easement would be paved and gated. Marin contends Trada Partners’s\n\ndevelopment moved forward in reliance upon Mr. Vogt’s representation that he would “swap\n\neasement for easement,” and it was only after Trada Partners had expended millions of dollars on\n\nthe development that the Vogts filed suit. 1 Mr. Vogt denied he ever agreed to swap his current\n\neasement for a new easement, admitting only that on a single occasion he “casually mentioned to\n\nsomeone with the City of Boerne that he might be willing to exchange easements” if it would\n\nenable to him to access his one-acre tract. Mr. Vogt denied ever speaking to anyone with Trada\n\nPartners or Marin about this, and claimed no one from Trada Partners or Marin ever even offered\n\nto exchange easements with him or provide the Vogts with a new easement. It is undisputed\n\nthere was no written agreement concerning an exchange of easements.\n\n        In any event, Mr. Vogt ultimately became concerned when he saw dirt and debris being\n\npiled onto his easement and tried to contact someone at Trada Partners. Mr. Vogt testified that in\n\nJanuary 2006, he met with Sieckert and showed him how construction crews were piling dirt on\n\nthe easement. According to Mr. Vogt, Sieckert stated, “If you think . . . we’re going to change\n\nour plans because you say that’s your easement . . . you’re greatly mistaken.” Despite Sieckert’s\n\nalleged statement, the subdivision plat for the development expressly recognized the Vogts’ “20'\n\ningress and egress easement.”\n\n        There was testimony that during construction, Trada Partners built pads, hauled in dirt,\n\nand raised the level of the property, including the easement, by as much as two-and-a-half feet.\n\nAfter Marin acquired part of the development, it continued the construction, encroaching on the\n\neasement and raising the level of the property. In February of 2006, Mr. Vogt sent a letter to\n\n\n1\n Initially, the Vogts sued only Trada Partners. However, after construction of the development was complete, the\nVogts named subsequent purchasers of property within the development as defendants.\n\n                                                      -3-\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nTrada Partners that provided the developer with deed record references for the easement. Mr.\n\nVogt testified he sent the letter because Trada Partners and Marin had erected a fence that\n\nblocked ingress and egress by way of the easement, built a rock and dirt wall on the easement,\n\nand dug a large ditch that prohibited passage. In response, Mr. Vogt received a letter from\n\ncounsel for Trada Partners advising Mr. Vogt that Trada Partners had provided him with a\n\n“private gate” for access, but the easement had been terminated by eminent domain, had been\n\nunusable for years, and had been abandoned by non-use. According to Mr. Vogt, none of these\n\nstatements was true, and we have found nothing in the record to support any of Trada Partners’s\n\nassertions. Trada Partners’s attorney concluded the letter by directing Mr. Vogt to “cease and\n\ndesist” from attempts to use the easement–despite the fact the Vogts owned the easement by\n\nrecorded deed.\n\n       After receiving the letter, Mr. Vogt hired an attorney, who wrote a letter to Trada\n\nPartners’s attorney advising him the Vogts had a valid, recorded easement memorialized in the\n\nplats Trada Partners filed with the City of Boerne. He further advised Trada Partners’s attorney\n\nthe easement never terminated and had been in use by the Vogts until that use was barred by\n\nTrada Partners’s actions. The letter demanded the easement be returned to its original condition.\n\nEvidence in the record shows Trada Partners did not restore the easement, but continued\n\nencroaching on and blocking the easement. At this point, the Vogts filed suit against Trada\n\nPartners. Marin and the other buyers were later added as defendants in the suit after they\n\nacquired portions of the development.\n\n       In the suit, the Vogts alleged the development encroached upon their easement, rendering\n\nit unusable. They further asserted the alterations, specifically increases in elevation, caused the\n\ndiversion of the natural flow of surface water onto the easement and the Vogts’ property, both\n\n\n\n                                               -4-\n\f                                                                                      04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nnineteen and one-acre tracts, resulting in flooding. The Vogts sought temporary and permanent\n\ninjunctive relief, requiring the removal of any structures interfering with the easement, or\n\ndamages for the loss of use of the easement and for damages due to surface water diversion.\n\n       Before trial, the trial court granted a temporary injunction in favor of the Vogts. Trada\n\nPartners VI, LP v. Vogt, No. 04-06-00723-CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">163181</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1 (Tex. App.—San\n\nAntonio Jan. 24, 2007, no pet.). The temporary injunction enjoined Trada Partners and Marin\n\nfrom interfering with the Vogts’ use of the easement. Id. Trada Partners and Marin appealed the\n\ngranting of the temporary injunction, and this court reversed, holding the Vogts had failed to\n\n“establish a sufficient probability of irreparable injury in the absence of a temporary injunction”\n\nbecause Mr. Vogt admitted the obstruction of the easement did not completely deprive the Vogts\n\nof access to the one-acre parcel; they could access the one-acre parcel through their other tract of\n\nland, which was contiguous to the one-acre tract. Id. at *1-*2. Because the Vogts would only\n\nsuffer inconvenience if the injunction was lifted, they did not establish a sufficient probability of\n\nirreparable injury, an element that must be established to obtain a temporary injunction. Id. at\n\n*2.\n\n       Trada Partners and Marin answered the suit. Marin asserted a general denial and the\n\naffirmative defenses of estoppel, consent, fraud, and failure to mitigate. Marin later asserted a\n\ncounterclaim seeking declaratory relief, specific performance, a finding of promissory estoppel,\n\ninjunctive relief and damages based on the Vogts’ alleged negligent misrepresentations, fraud,\n\nbreach of contract, and trespass.\n\n       After suit was filed, the Vogts and Trada Partners entered into a Rule 11 agreement that\n\nprovided: (1) the Vogts owned the easement, which was recorded in the deed records; (2) Trada\n\nPartners would not challenge the existence of continuing validity of the easement nor assert it\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f                                                                                   04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nhas been extinguished in any manner; and (3) the Vogts were entitled to “repair and maintain the\n\nEasement at their discretion” as long as they did not “unduly interfere with the servient estate,”\n\ni.e., the development. When the easement became impassable, the Vogts’ counsel advised\n\ncounsel for Trada Partners by letter that if the easement were not restored to allow ingress and\n\negress, the Vogts would exercise their rights under the Rule 11 agreement to maintain the\n\neasement themselves. When no action was taken, the Vogts hired a contractor to return the\n\neasement to its original condition, and the Vogts’ counsel notified Trada Partners’s attorney, who\n\nnow represented Marin as well, of their intentions. In response, Trada Partners’s attorney asked\n\nfor the name of the contractor , claiming it was to coordinate activities. The Vogts’ attorney\n\ndisclosed the name of the contractor. Thereafter, someone from Trada Partners contacted the\n\ncontractor and threatened him with “immediate legal action” if during the work on the easement\n\nhe impeded the construction process or trespassed on property outside the easement.           The\n\ncontractor was also advised that if he worked on the easement, he needed to contact counsel for\n\nTrada Partners and Marin because the attorney would need to “depose [him] regarding [the]\n\nexact and complete scope of work” he intended to perform for the Vogts. The contractor, fearing\n\ninvolvement in the pending legal proceedings, refused to do the work for the Vogts, as did any\n\nother contractor in the area.\n\n       The Vogts then attempted to do the work themselves, which ultimately resulted in a\n\nreport of criminal mischief and criminal trespass by someone from Trada Partners to the Boerne\n\nPolice Department. Later, in 2008, Mr. Vogt was arrested after there was a second report from\n\nSusan Rogers, the manager of the apartments on the development, and a Trada Partners\n\nconstruction superintendent, that Mr. Vogt had damaged fencing and marked encroachments on\n\nthe easement with orange spray paint. Sieckert was contacted during the police investigation and\n\n\n\n                                               -6-\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nadvised the investigator that Mr. Vogt had damaged the property once before, and suspected he\n\nwas responsible for this second round of “criminal mischief.” The Boerne investigator also had\n\ncontact with the attorney for Trada Partners and Marin, who advised him “Vogt had no need to\n\nuse Trada’s property since Vogt could access all of his property through his own property . . .\n\n[and] Trada has also provided a paved route through the property and a private gate for Vogt’s\n\nproperty, but Vogt does not acknowledge it.” The attorney did not advise the investigator about\n\nthe Rule 11 agreement that allowed the Vogts to remove encroachments on the easement if Trada\n\nPartners and Marin refused. It was only after Mr. Vogt and his son showed the investigator the\n\nRule 11 agreement and asked the attorney about it that the attorney acknowledged its existence.\n\nHowever, counsel for Trada Partners and Marin told the investigator this court’s judgment in the\n\ntemporary injunction action “overturned” the Rule 11 agreement and gave Trada Partners and\n\nMarin the right to build on the easement. The attorney told the investigator, based on this court’s\n\nopinion, Trada Partners and Marin could block the entire easement if they so chose. The\n\ninvestigator called Sieckert again and Sieckert told him Rogers was his agent and would provide\n\nan affidavit on his behalf, which she did. Based on information provided to the Boerne Police\n\nDepartment by Trada Partners and Marin, Mr. Vogt was arrested for felony criminal mischief.\n\nTrada Partners and Marin allegedly reported that Mr. Vogt had moved dirt and damaged fencing,\n\nbut eventually claimed he had caused some major structural damage costing thousands of dollars\n\nto repair. Although Mr. Vogt was ultimately “no-billed” by the grand jury, he was arrested,\n\nfingerprinted, and had his mug shot taken. Mr. Vogt testified that as a former Chief Deputy\n\nSheriff and constable, he was extremely embarrassed by the arrest, especially after his mug shot\n\nwas broadcast on television and counsel for Trada Partners and Marin talked about the case on\n\n\n\n\n                                               -7-\n\f                                                                                        04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nthe news of a San Antonio television station. This incident resulted in the Vogts asserting a\n\nclaim for malicious prosecution.\n\n            When the case was called for trial on May 5, 2009, Trada Partners, which the trial court\n\nfound received notice of the trial setting, failed to appear. Accordingly, on October 12, 2009, the\n\ntrial court entered a default judgment against Trada Partners. The damages awarded to the Vogts\n\nagainst Trada Partners in the default judgment mirrored the damages ultimately found by the jury\n\nat trial.\n\n            A jury trial was held between the Vogts and the remaining defendants. After all the\n\nevidence was heard, the jury was asked, generally, whether:\n\n            $improvements on the development encroached on the Vogts’ easement, and if\n            so, what sum of money would fairly and reasonably compensate the Vogts for\n            loss of use of the easement from the time of the first encroachment to the present;\n\n            $the development resulted in a diversion of surface water onto the Vogts’ one-\n            acre tract, whether damages from the diversion were permanent or temporary, and\n            if there was a diversion caused by the development, what sum of money would\n            fairly and reasonably compensate the Vogts for loss of use of the one-acre tract\n            and the difference in market value of the one-acre tract after the water diversion;\n\n            $the diversion of surface water caused damage to the Vogts’ nineteen-acre tract,\n            whether such damage was permanent or temporary, and if there was a diversion,\n            what sum of money would fairly and reasonably compensate the Vogts for loss of\n            use of the nineteen-acre tract and the difference in market value of the nineteen-\n            acre tract after the water diversion;\n\n            $the act of diverting the surface water onto the Vogts’ nineteen-acre tract was\n            done with malice, and if so, what sum of damages should be awarded as\n            exemplary damages for the malicious act; and\n\n            $Marin maliciously prosecuted Mr. Vogt, and if so, what sum of money would\n            fairly and reasonably compensate him for his injuries.\n\n            The jury answered “yes” to all the liability questions and, where appropriate, found the\n\nproperty damage permanent. The jury awarded the Vogts a total of $1,691,372 for their claims\n\nof encroachment, surface water diversion, and malicious prosecution. The trial court thereafter\n\n                                                   -8-\n\f                                                                                                          04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nentered a judgment based on the jury’s verdict, awarding the Vogts $1,691,372 in damages. The\n\ntrial court also awarded the Vogts’ $50,732.51 in attorney’s fees and contingent appellate\n\nattorney’s fees. 2 In addition to the compensatory relief, the trial court also awarded the Vogts’\n\ninjunctive relief, requiring all encroachments be removed from the Vogts’ easement.\n\n           Marin filed for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a motion for new trial; both\n\nwere denied. Thereafter, Marin perfected this appeal.\n\n                                                        ANALYSIS\n\n           On appeal, Marin raises nine issues, contending:\n\n           $the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the award of\n           injunctive relief;\n\n           $the trial court erred in denying the motions for judgment notwithstanding the\n           verdict and for new trial because the verdict cannot support the judgment award\n           of damages for loss of use of the easement due to encroachment;\n\n           $the award of injunctive relief and damages for encroachment is erroneous\n           because it amounts to an improper double recovery;\n\n           $the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of expert Wayne Godsey because\n           his causation opinion regarding the surface water diversion was unreliable, based\n           on a faulty foundation, and amounted to mere speculation and supposition;\n\n           $the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of expert Lonnie Marquardt\n           because his opinions on the issue of damages for the surface water diversion and\n           the appraised value of the Vogts’ property were based on improper methodology\n           and a faulty foundation, and amounted to mere speculation and supposition;\n\n           $the trial court erred in admitting testimony from the Vogts’ experts despite\n           timely objections;\n\n           $the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the jury’s finding\n           regarding the Vogts’ surface water diversion claims because there is no evidence\n           or insufficient evidence of causation and damages;\n\n           $the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the jury’s malicious\n           prosecution finding because the Vogts failed to prove certain required elements of\n           the claim; and\n2\n    The parties had agreed to submit the issue of attorney’s fees to the trial court for determination.\n\n                                                             -9-\n\f                                                                                       04-10-00602-CV\n\n\n\n\n       $the trial court erred in granting judgment for the Vogts because the default\n       judgment taken against Trada Partners disposed of all parties and issues in the\n       suit.\n\n                                          Injunctive Relief\n\n       In its first issue, Marin contends “the evidence adduced at trial is legally and, in the\n\nalternative, factually insufficient to support the injunctive relief granted by the trial court because\n\nof the “‘law of the case.’” However, in an appeal from a permanent injunction, the standard of\n\nreview is clear abuse of discretion.

App.—Dallas\n\n1989, no writ)).\n\n       In its final judgment, the trial court awarded the Vogts permanent injunctive relief. More\n\nspecifically, the trial court found that because of Marin’s action in encroaching upon the Vogts’\n\neasement, the Vogts’ one-acre tract “no longer [had] passable deeded access making it\n\nunmarketable,” and emergency personnel could not access the one-acre tract via the one-acre\n\ntract’s 911 address. Concluding the Vogts had no adequate remedy at law and would continue to\n\nsuffer irreparable injury and imminent harm as a result of the encroachment, the trial court\n\nordered that “all buildings, fences, culverts, curbs, sidewalks, air conditioning units, and any\n\nother items and structures . . . that encroach on the easement and interfere with use of the entire\n\ntwenty (20) foot easement” be removed. The trial court then permanently enjoined further\n\n                                                 - 10 -\n\f                                                                                      04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nbuilding, construction, or alterations that would interfere with or obstruct the Vogts’ use of the\n\neasement. This relief is the subject of Marin’s first issue.\n\n       As noted above, prior to trial, the Vogts sought a temporary injunction to restrain Trada\n\nPartners and Marin from interfering with the Vogts’ use of the easement. Id. The trial court\n\ngranted the requested injunctive relief on October 6, 2006. Id. Trada Partners and Marin\n\nappealed the granting of the temporary injunction, contending the Vogts had not established they\n\nwould suffer a probable irreparable injury in the absence of a temporary injunction. Id.\n\n       This court agreed, holding the Vogts had failed to “establish a sufficient probability of\n\nirreparable injury in the absence of a temporary injunction” because Mr. Vogt admitted the\n\nobstruction of the easement did not completely deprive the Vogts of access to the one-acre\n\nparcel; they could access the one-acre parcel through their other tract of land, which was\n\ncontiguous to the one-acre tract.       Id. at *1-*2.     Because the Vogts would suffer only\n\ninconvenience if the injunction was lifted, they did not establish a sufficient probability of\n\nirreparable injury, an element that must be established to obtain a temporary injunction. Id. at\n\n*2. In rendering our decision, we noted that our review was confined to the validity of the trial\n\ncourt’s October 6, 2006 order. Id. at *1 (citing Reagan Nat’l Adver. v.

Marin argues that because this court found\n\nthe Vogts have alternate access to the one-acre tract through the nineteen-acre tract, there has\n\nbeen no change in the factual circumstances so as to permit injunctive relief. Marin claims the\n\nlaw of the case doctrine requires we sustain their first issue.

Trinh,\n\n340 S.W.3d at 836.\n\n       In the matter before us, the issue that Marin claims is “law of the case” and should govern\n\nin this appeal was not a question of law previously decided by this court, but a finding that the\n\nVogts had failed to prove facts necessary to establish irreparable harm for purposes of the\n\ntemporary injunction.    There is nothing in our opinion to suggest we held there was no\n\nirreparable harm as a matter of law. We did not rule the evidence “legally insufficient,” which\n\nwould have invoked the doctrine. See Lifshutz, 199 S.W.3d at 20. A ruling on a question of law\n\nis essential to the applicability of the law of the case doctrine. Id. (citing Hudson, 711 S.W.2d at\n\n630).

Obviously, circumstances could\n\nhave changed or the Vogts could have presented different or more compelling evidence in 2009\n\nthan they did in 2006. Their failure or inability to present such evidence in 2006 is no bar to\n\npresentation of such evidence in 2009 in support of their request for a permanent injunction.\n\nClearly, facts and circumstances may change over the course of three years.

However, in its reply brief, Marin raises a myriad of other issues relating to the\n\npermanent injunction, including: (1) there is no evidence of irreparable harm that would allow\n\nthe award of a permanent injunction because the evidence shows the Vogts have other means to\n\naccess the one-acre tract; (2) there is insufficient evidence specifically describing the\n\nencroachments and the property boundaries so as to permit an award of a permanent injunction;\n\n(3) there is no jury question or finding regarding the true and correct location of the boundary\n\nline; (4) the uncontroverted evidence showed the encroachment of Marin’s culvert/drainage\n\nbasin extends onto a Texas Department of Highways right of way, not the easement, and\n\ntherefore the trial court erred in submitting jury question eleven; (5) the permanent injunction\n\nlacks “the necessary specificity for enforcement and violate[s] Rule 683 of the Texas Rules of\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 13 -\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nCivil Procedure”; and (6) the permanent injunction is unconstitutional because it is too vague to\n\nbe enforced.\n\n       We decline to address these issues. Although related to the award of injunctive relief, the\n\nissues Marin raises in the reply brief are wholly different from the single issue raised and argued\n\nin Marin’s opening brief, which only challenged the permanent injunction based on the law of\n\nthe case doctrine.

Accordingly, these issues are not properly before the court.\n\n                                           Loss of Use\n\n       In the charge, the jury was asked to determine the value of the Vogts’ loss of use of the\n\neasement from the date of the first encroachment to the present.             The jury answered,\n\n“$30,000.00.” Marin asserts the trial court erred in granting judgment for the Vogts on their loss\n\nof use claims because “there was no evidence or insufficient evidence that any of the\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 14 -\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nAppellants/Defendants were involved in the design, construction or placement of any structures\n\nor other constructions [sic] onto the easement or of damages for loss of use of easement.”\n\n                                 Design, Construction, Placement\n\n       In the jury charge, the jury was asked in questions one through nine if improvements\n\nfrom the eight lots in the development and the property owned by Marin encroached upon the\n\neasement owned by the Vogts. Marin seems to contend that even though the jury answered\n\n“yes” to each question, judgment could not be entered against it or the other property owners\n\nbecause there was no evidence any individual property owner “designed, constructed or placed\n\nany structures, improvements or other construction onto the easement.” Rather, the evidence at\n\ntrial showed only that the individual property owners, including Marin, purchased specific lots\n\nfrom the developer, Trada Partners. Thus, it seems Marin’s position is that a property owner\n\ncannot be responsible for loss of use even if his property encroaches upon the property of\n\nanother, rendering it useless, unless the property owner designed, constructed, or placed the\n\nencroachment on the property of another.\n\n       Marin does not cite any authority, nor have we found any, for the proposition that a\n\nproperty owner who encroaches upon the property of another must have designed, built, or\n\nplaced the encroachment on the other person’s property to be held liable for loss of use. And, in\n\nfact, the authority cited by the Vogts is contrary to Marin’s assertion.\n\n       In Allen v. Va. Hill Water Supply Corp., the defendant’s predecessor in title constructed a\n\nbuilding that encroached onto the adjacent lot owned by the plaintiff. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1623124\"><a href=\"/opinion/1623124/allen-v-virginia-hill-water-supply-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">609</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">633</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 634\n\n(Tex. Civ. App.—Tyler 1980, no writ). When the defendant purchased his lot, he did not know\n\nthe building on the lot encroached upon the neighboring lot. Id. Nevertheless, he was sued by\n\nthe plaintiff and the trial court ordered him to remove the encroaching portion of the building and\n\n\n\n                                                - 15 -\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nto pay damages to the plaintiff. Id. On appeal, the defendant claimed, as Marin does here, he\n\nshould not be held liable for removing a building which he had no part in placing upon the\n\nplaintiff’s property. Id. Rejecting the defendant’s argument, the court of appeals held that even\n\nthough the building was built by the defendant’s predecessor in title and possession, the\n\ndefendant was required to remove the encroaching portion of the building and to pay the plaintiff\n\ndamages. Id. at 636.\n\n        Here, as in Allen, the fact that Trada Partners designed, built, and placed the\n\nencroachments on the easement does not absolve the individual property owners from liability to\n\nthe Vogts. See id. The mere fact of ownership of an encroaching structure is sufficient to\n\nestablish liability. See id.\n\n        In addition to the foregoing argument, Marin also makes a somewhat confusing\n\nargument, which is intertwined with the first argument, about the ambiguity of the verdict and its\n\ninsufficiency to support the judgment. Perhaps Marin is contending that because questions one\n\nthrough eight in the jury charge did not specifically ask the jury if the lot owned by a particular\n\nperson encroached upon the Vogts’ easement, i.e., “Did improvements on Lot 1 owned by X\n\nencroach on the Vogts’ easement?”, but merely asked if improvements on “Lot 1,” “Lot 2,” etc.\n\nencroached upon the easement, judgment against the specific landowners was improper. This\n\nargument is without merit.\n\n        First, this argument was not raised during the jury charge conference, or in either the\n\nmotion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or motion for new trial. Therefore, it has been\n\nwaived. See TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a). Substantively, there is a good reason Marin did not raise\n\nthe argument below, and we find it disingenuous that Marin chose to assert it on appeal. In the\n\ncourt below, Marin’s attorney, on behalf of Marin and the individual owners, and counsel for\n\n\n\n                                               - 16 -\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nVogt specifically agreed the encroachment claims against the individual lot owners would be\n\nsubmitted to the jury on a lot-by-lot basis rather than by using the name of the individual owner\n\nof the lot:\n\n        The Court: Counsel, before we bring the jury in, do you want to make that\n        stipulation in the record?\n\n        Mr. Schulte [Vogts’ counsel]: Yes, the parties have agreed as follows:\n\n        As to lots 1 through 8, we have stipulated that the owners of those lots are the\n        parties identified yesterday, Derra Edwards, Lot 1: Shees, Lot 2; Dresden &\n        Goldberg Investco, Lot 3; Leal Urgin is Lot 4; G2 Assets was Lot 5; The Boerne\n        Trust was Lot 6; Hugh Lam was Lot 7; and the Maganaris Trust was Lot 8.\n\n                                          *       *         *\n\n        The Court: Is that your stipulation, also, Mr. Prins?\n\n        Mr. Prins [Counsel for Marin]: Yes, it is, Judge.\n\n        The Court: On behalf of all your clients?\n\n        Mr. Prins: Yes.\n\n        The Court: And, likewise, the reason we are doing the stipulation on Lots 1\n        through 8, I don’t think you – references in proposed Question 1 through 8 in the\n        Court’s Charge deal with the encroachment of the easement or extension onto the\n        easement of the Vogts, and rather than name each person in each question, if there\n        is a finding of Lot 1 as referenced in the question, will pertain to that – that\n        particular owner as just stipulated to, Lot 2 and so forth. Is that understood,\n        counsel?\n\n        Mr. Prins: Yes.\n\n\n        Based on the exchange quoted above, Marin is complaining about alleged charge error\n\nand error in the judgment that occurred as a result of its own stipulation. Marin, through counsel,\n\nspecifically stipulated to submit the questions regarding encroachment onto the easement by lot\n\nnumber rather than by owner and agreed that any finding by lot number would relate to the\n\nspecific lot owner as stated in the stipulation–thereby justifying a judgment based on the lot\n\n                                                - 17 -\n\f                                                                                   04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nfinding.    This agreement entered in open court on the record amounts to a valid Rule 11\n\nagreement to which Marin is bound. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 11. With regard to question nine, it did\n\nnot submit the encroachment issue by lot, but asked if property owned by Marin encroached on\n\nthe easement. This jury finding clearly supports the judgment against Marin for loss of use.\n\nThus, contrary to Marin’s assertions, we need not speculate as to what the jury intended when\n\nanswering questions one through nine. Based on the jury findings and the parties’ stipulation,\n\nwe can determine exactly which property owned by which owner encroached, according to the\n\njury, on the Vogts’ easement. Thus, Marin’s argument is erroneous and unsubstantiated by the\n\nrecord.\n\n          With regard to the damage question, jury question number ten, if Marin is likewise\n\ncontending this submission was erroneous because it did not sufficiently tie damages to each\n\nindividual defendant, this claim is waived.

The jury was specifically instructed that in considering damages for the Vogts’\n\nloss of use, it should consider the value of the use from the date of the first encroachment to the\n\npresent. The jury was not asked about future damages for loss of use of the easement. Having\n\nfound there were encroachments upon the easement, the jury answered the loss of use damage\n\nquestion and found $30,000.00 would compensate the Vogts for their loss from the date of the\n\nfirst encroachment to the present. In its judgment, the trial court awarded the Vogts $30,000.00\n\nfor loss of use of the easement. The trial court also awarded the Vogts a permanent injunction,\n\nwhich required removal of the encroachments.\n\n       As noted above, the Vogts did not ask for future damages for their lost use of the\n\neasement. Rather, they sought only past damages. The permanent injunction, which required\n\nremoval of the encroachments, would negate any future losses based on an inability to use the\n\neasement because once the encroachments are removed, the Vogts will again be free to access\n\nthe easement. Accordingly, we hold there was no double recovery. The supreme court has\n\nspecifically recognized that only when a judgment awards “both an injunction and damages as to\n\nfuture effects” is there an impermissible double recovery. Schneider v.

The Vogts were not awarded future damages and an\n\ninjunction; rather, they received damages to redress the time when they lost the use of their\n\neasement due to the encroachments, and injunction to prevent future loss of use.

In issues four through six, Marin\n\nchallenges the admission of expert testimony presented by the Vogts in support of this allegation.\n\n       In issues four and five, Marin challenges the admission of testimony from Wayne\n\nGodsey, a civil engineer who testified about surface water diversion, and Lonnie Marquardt, a\n\n\n\n                                              - 22 -\n\f                                                                                      04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nreal estate appraiser who testified about damages based on the alleged surface water diversion.\n\nIssue six seems to be nothing more than a general procedural complaint about the admission of\n\nthe expert testimony complained of in issues four and five.

Id.\n\nOnly when the reliability of the expert’s testimony is challenged based on underlying\n\nmethodology, technique, or foundational data used by the expert is a timely objection required\n\nbecause then the trial court is required to go beyond the face of the record to determine\n\nreliability. Id.\n\n                                           Civil Engineer\n\n        In support of their claim of diversion, the Vogts proffered the testimony of Wayne\n\nGodsey to establish the actions of Trada Partners and Marin caused the surface water diversion\n\nthat allegedly resulted in flooding of the Vogts’ property. In issue four, Marin complains about\n\nthe admission of Wayne Godsey’s testimony, arguing the trial court erred in admitting Godsey’s\n\ntestimony because his causation opinion was “unreliable and based on a faulty foundation and\n\namounted to no more than a mere speculation and supposition.” The Vogts respond by arguing\n\n(1) Marin waived error by failing to object on the exact grounds raised on appeal, and (2)\n\ncontrary to Marin’s argument, Godsey’s testimony was not on the design of the drainage culvert\n\nso his failure to study the design plan or determine what caused the culvert to overflow is not\n\nfatal to his testimony.\n\n        First of all, with regard to waiver, the supreme court’s holding in Pollack disposes of the\n\nVogts’ claim that Marin has waived error with regard to Godsey’s testimony. We hold that\n\n                                                 - 24 -\n\f                                                                                   04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nMarin’s contention on appeal, and at trial, was that Godsey’s testimony was pure speculation.\n\nThis is the type of challenge for which an objection is not required because the court need look\n\nno further than the face of the record to determine the reliability of the expert’s opinion. See\n\nPollock, 284 S.W.3d at 816. Accordingly we must review this issue.\n\n       Godsey is a civil engineer with twenty-five years’ experience in civil engineering, design,\n\nplanning, and construction management, and owns a firm specializing in “drainage and\n\ninfrastructure design related with drainage and land development projects.” The firm’s work\n\nincludes surface water control, flood studies, and dam inspections and design. Godsey testified\n\nhe has been involved in a project similar to the Trada Partners’s development.\n\n       When he was first contacted by Mr. Vogt, he told him he would like to take a look at the\n\ndevelopment before agreeing to do any work on the Vogts’ behalf. He testified he and Mr. Vogt\n\ndrove around the project, which was still under construction, and at that time he noticed several\n\nareas that impacted historical drainage patterns relative to the Vogts’ property. After this first\n\ninspection, he agreed to work for the Vogts, stating he believed they had been impacted because\n\nof the development.\n\n       Godsey testified he conducted a site visit and inspection, and then reviewed construction\n\nplans for the development that Mr. Vogt provided and others that were on file with the City of\n\nBoerne. He reviewed drainage documents from Pape-Dawson, the engineering firm hired to\n\nwork on the development, which were provided by the Vogts’ attorney. He also received\n\ninformation from Mr. Vogt about the flooding and viewed pictures of the flooding. Godsey was\n\nadvised by Mr. Vogt that until the new development, the Vogts’ property had never flooded as it\n\ndid after the construction of the development.         Godsey testified Mr. Vogt told him that\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 25 -\n\f                                                                                      04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nhistorically there was a ditch that took surface water through the property upon which the\n\ndevelopment was built.\n\n       Godsey used a drainage flow diagram from the Pape-Dawson files to show the jury the\n\nhistorical flow of surface water before the development. According to Godsey, before the\n\ndevelopment, rainwater would drain off through the development tract, but by elevating portions\n\nof the development, the water flow was redirected so that the overflow drained onto the Vogts’\n\nproperty when, during a heavy rainfall, a culvert backed up. Godsey testified he viewed the\n\nproperty and observed the increase in elevation in relation to the Vogts’ property.\n\n       Godsey was also asked about a culvert that apparently backed up during a large\n\nrainstorm. Godsey testified based on his inspection and the information provided by Mr. Vogt\n\nand the documents he reviewed, there were several reasons the culvert may have overflowed.\n\nOn voir dire and during cross-examination, Godsey admitted he had not seen the culvert design,\n\nhad no opinion whether the design was improper because he had not seen it, and admitted any\n\nopinion he had on what might have happened was a “potential” opinion because he was unaware\n\nof the actual design of the culvert. Godsey also admitted he did not know why the culvert\n\nbacked up, and the only information he had regarding the culvert came from Mr. Vogt. He\n\nadmitted he knew nothing about the design of the culvert, had no knowledge if the culvert’s\n\ncapacity was exceeded, and could only speculate that the culvert had been blocked by debris.\n\nGodsey stated he could not opine on any other possible causes–other than those he relayed\n\nduring his direct testimony–but admitted he did not know what caused the culvert in this case to\n\nback up. He admitted his opinion on the cause of the back up in this case applies to any back up\n\nin any culvert.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 26 -\n\f                                                                                   04-10-00602-CV\n\n\n       Marin contends Godsey’s testimony is speculative and cannot support a finding of\n\ncausation because he cannot definitively say why the culvert backed up. The Vogts contend\n\nMarin has misinterpreted Godsey’s testimony. After a thorough and detailed review of Godsey’s\n\ntestimony, we agree with the Vogts.\n\n       Godsey’s opinion was that the Vogts’ property flooded because of an increase in\n\nelevation of the development relative to the Vogts’ property.       This testimony was neither\n\nspeculative nor otherwise unreliable. Godsey specifically testified the increase in elevation\n\naltered historical surface water drainage patterns, and his testimony was based on his own visual\n\ninspection of the property where he noted diversions from the historical drainage patterns due to\n\nincreases in elevation, as well as a drainage area map used by Pape-Dawson, the company that\n\nconstructed the development. Godsey opined that historically water drained back onto the\n\nproperty upon which the development was constructed, but Trada Partners and Marin “blocked\n\nthat flow” by increasing the elevation of the development in relation to the Vogts’ property,\n\nforcing the surface water to flood the Vogts’ property. We hold this testimony is neither\n\nspeculative nor unreliable, and is supported by a proper predicate and a proper foundation.\n\n       As for Marin’s claims about Godsey’s testimony regarding the culvert, we agree it is\n\nindeed speculative–Godsey could not say what actually blocked the culvert and caused it to\n\noverflow. However, we do not interpret Godsey’s testimony to suggest the culvert was the cause\n\nof the surface water diversion that resulted in the flooding of the Vogts’ property. As Godsey\n\nnoted, before the development, “the ground was lower and there was a ditch that headed off . . .\n\nand the water would just head off . . . through the baseball field property.” However, as a result\n\nof the development, the property was elevated, precluding historical run-off through the\n\ndevelopment property. Thus, we hold Godsey did not opine that the culvert caused the flooding;\n\n\n\n                                              - 27 -\n\f                                                                                     04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nrather, he opined that the increase in elevation due to construction of the development caused\n\nsurface water diversion that resulted in flooding of the Vogts’ property. We find Marin’s\n\ncomplaints about the speculative nature of the “culvert testimony” unconvincing and we overrule\n\nMarin’s challenge to Godsey’s testimony.\n\n                                      Real Estate Appraiser\n\n       Marin also complains the trial court erred in admitting the expert testimony of Lonnie\n\nMarquardt on the issue of damages for the alleged surface water diversion. Marin contends “his\n\nmethodology was improper, his opinion was based on a faulty foundation, and his opinion\n\namounted to no more than speculation and supposition.” Although this is the complaint stated in\n\nMarin’s fifth issue, a review of its argument reveals Marin is challenging the admission of\n\nMarquardt’s testimony based on improper methodology and lack of foundation.\n\n       The Vogts contend, as they did with regard to Godsey’s testimony, that Marin failed to\n\npreserve this issue for our review. Again, we disagree, but for a different reason. Because Marin\n\nis challenging the reliability of Marquardt’s testimony based on alleged improper methodology\n\nand lack of foundation, an objection was required. See Pollock, 284 S.W.3d at 816. However,\n\ncontrary to the Vogts’ assertion, Marin did object–in writing before trial and during Marquardt’s\n\ntestimony–in a manner sufficient to apprise the trial court of its complaints and allow the trial\n\ncourt to rule. See TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a). We will, therefore, review this issue.\n\n       Marquardt is an independent real estate broker and appraiser. He testified he is certified\n\nby the State, and has a “GAA,” which means he is a general accredited appraiser through the\n\nNational Association of Realtors. Marquardt stated he has been accepted as an expert appraiser\n\nfor the Texas Department of Transportation and numerous federal, district, and county courts in\n\nsouth Texas.\n\n\n\n                                               - 28 -\n\f                                                                                   04-10-00602-CV\n\n\n       Marquardt testified he was asked by the Vogts to evaluate whether their property–both\n\nthe one-acre and nineteen-acre tracts–have suffered a diminution in value. As to the one-acre\n\ntract, Marquardt was tasked with determining whether it had been devalued due to the loss of the\n\neasement and the potential for flooding. With regard to the nineteen-acre tract, he was only to\n\ndetermine any decrease in value based on the potential for flooding.\n\n       Marquardt stated that to make his determination, he performed what is known as a\n\n“before and after” analysis for each property. For the one-acre tract, Marquardt had to develop\n\nan estimate of the market value of the one-acre tract assuming legal ingress and egress provided\n\nby a twenty-foot wide passable easement and no surface water flooding. He would then develop\n\nan estimate of the market value of the one-acre tract as “landlocked” and prone to flooding due\n\nto significant surface water drainage. Marquardt specifically stated he developed his estimate\n\nbased on the one-acre tract as a property independent from the nineteen-acre tract. To develop\n\nhis estimate, he researched comparable sales in an attempt to find the best comparison possible.\n\n“Comparables,” according to Marquardt, are normally relied upon by appraisers in making these\n\ntypes of determinations. Marquardt also prepared his appraisal using the “highest and best use”\n\nanalysis, which requires the appraiser to consider what is the potential best use for the property\n\nbeing appraised, i.e., residential, commercial, agricultural, etc.\n\n       Using the foregoing methodology, Marquardt testified that the value of the one-acre tract\n\nbefore the loss of the easement and before it was subject to flooding was $2.00 per square foot,\n\nfor a total value of $79,366.32 given the size of the property. However, in the absence of a\n\npassable easement and a likelihood of flooding due to surface water diversion, the market value\n\nof the property fell to $0.20 per square foot, for a total value of $7,936.63. This meant a change\n\n\n\n\n                                                 - 29 -\n\f                                                                                   04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nin value due to the loss of the easement and the increased chance of flooding of $71,429.69. The\n\njury found the Vogts’ damages to be $71,000.00 for Marin’s alleged diversion of surface water.\n\n       Marquardt stated he used the same methodology for the nineteen-acre tract, and\n\ndetermined its value before the alleged increased potential for flooding to be $3.50 per square\n\nfoot, for a total value of $1,219,680.00. Marquardt indicated that in making this determination,\n\nthe highest and best use analysis called for him to consider only the eight acres on Highway 87\n\nfor commercial use–the remaining acreage was insignificant in this context. Marquardt then\n\ntestified the value of the nineteen-acre tract, given the flooding problems, decreased in value to\n\n$2.10 per square foot, for a total value of $731,808.00.       This was a change in value of\n\n$487,872.00, which was the exact amount awarded by the jury.\n\n       Marin first argues the trial court should have excluded Marquardt’s testimony because\n\ndiminution of value was the improper measure of damages, and therefore Marquardt’s opinion\n\nwas based on an improper foundation and methodology. Marin’s argument is based on its\n\ncontention that the damages to the Vogts’ property were “temporary” as opposed to\n\n“permanent.” However, we need not decide if Marquardt used an improper damage model\n\nbecause Marin failed to raise an issue on appeal challenging the jury’s findings that the damage\n\nto both the one-acre and nineteen-acre tracts was permanent.\n\n       Unchallenged jury findings are binding on this court.

Williams,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2271931\"><a href=\"/opinion/2271931/abatement-inc-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">324</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">858</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 862 (Tex.

Accordingly, because the jury found the damage to the Vogts’\n\nland is permanent, and we are bound by this finding, the diminution in value model used by\n\nMarquardt was the proper measure of damages.\n\n       Marin also challenges the reliability of Marquardt’s testimony based on his considering\n\nof “highest and best use” given Mr. Vogts’ testimony that he did not intend to sell, develop, or\n\notherwise change the use of his property. However, Mr. Vogt explained that although he had no\n\npresent intention to sell the property, he was “just short of 80” and he did not mean to imply by\n\nhis testimony that his children or other successors in interest might have the same intentions.\n\nMoreover, Mr. Vogt testified he did not believe he could even sell the one-acre tract given the\n\nabsence of the easement.\n\n       Marin has not cited any authority, nor have we found any, to suggest that an appraiser\n\nmay not use “best and highest use” when appraising property for a diminution in value. In fact,\n\nin condemnation cases, the supreme court has held a factfinder may consider the highest and best\n\nuse of land in determining market value. Exxon Pipeline Co. v. Zwahr, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1877294\"><a href=\"/opinion/1877294/exxon-pipeline-co-v-zwahr/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">623</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 628\n\n(Tex. 2002). Moreover, in determining fair market value in condemnation proceedings, the\n\npreferred method is to use comparable sales, just as Marquardt did here, and in making that\n\ndetermination, consideration of highest and best use is proper. See City of Sugarland v. Home\n\nand Hearth Sugarland, L.P., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1593566\"><a href=\"/opinion/1593566/city-of-sugar-land-v-home-and-hearth/\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">503</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 512 (Tex. App.—Eastland 2007, pet. denied). We\n\ncan find no reason to hold highest and best use inapplicable here, particularly given Marquardt’s\n\nundisputed testimony that appraised market value assumes “highest and best use” even if the\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 31 -\n\f                                                                                      04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nproperty is not currently being used that way, and there is “no such thing” as appraising based on\n\n“current use.”\n\n       The only authority cited by Marin simply recognizes that when valuing property using\n\ncomparables, the property used for comparison must actually compare to the property being\n\nvalued. See Guadalupe-Blanco River Auth. v. Kraft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2007757\"><a href=\"/opinion/2007757/guadalupe-blanco-river-authority-v-kraft/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">805</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 806-07 (Tex. 2002). In that\n\ncase, the court found the expert’s testimony unreliable because he did not use a comparable sale\n\nof property for his comparison; rather, he could not find a comparable sale, so he “reconfigured”\n\nthe client’s easement to a rectangular 3.2 acre tract and hypothetically “relocated” it to facilitate\n\nhis comparative analysis. Id. Here, there is no suggestion Marquardt did not use comparable\n\nsales or “reconfigured” the Vogts’ property because he was unable to find comparable sales.\n\nThus, the authority cited by Marin is inapplicable.\n\n       Next, Marin claims Marquardt’s testimony was unreliable because “he did not follow the\n\nmethodology necessary for the admission of appraisal evidence.” Marin is contending that\n\nbecause Marquardt did not prepare a complete appraisal report in accordance with the Uniform\n\nStandards of Professional Appraisal Practice (“USPAP”), which would have been twenty-five to\n\nthirty pages in length and contained certain information his summary report did not, Marquardt\n\ndid not use proper methodology, rendering his opinion unreliable. We disagree.\n\n       First, Marquardt specifically testified he did all the work necessary for a complete\n\nUSPAP report, he simply did not prepare a complete report, but instead prepared a summary\n\nreport. Marquardt described all of the items that would be in a full report as opposed to a\n\nsummary, e.g., identity of the client, intended users, intended use of appraisal, identify property,\n\nsigned certification, etc. Although he did not prepare a full report, Marquardt testified he used\n\nthe methodology required by the USPAP. The case cited by Marin to suggest Marquardt’s\n\n\n\n                                                - 32 -\n\f                                                                                     04-10-00602-CV\n\n\ntestimony was inadmissible is inapposite. See Bufkin v. Bufkin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2333852\"><a href=\"/opinion/2333852/bufkin-v-bufkin/\"><span class=\"volume\">259</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">343</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. App.—\n\nDallas 2008, pets. denied). In that case, the court held the expert appraiser’s testimony regarding\n\nthe value of a ranch was properly stricken because he admitted using a method suggested by the\n\nattorney that was not proper under the USPAP and he had never valued real estate “that way”\n\nbefore. Id. at 351-52. Here, Marquardt used USPAP methodology, he simply did not prepare a\n\nfull report. Marin has cited no authority to suggest that the failure to prepare a specific kind of\n\nreport, when a summary report and testimony contains the necessary information required by the\n\naccepted methodology, renders an expert’s testimony unreliable.\n\n       Finally, Marin argues Marquardt’s testimony was unreliable and should have been\n\nexcluded because it was based on information provided by the Vogts, which was insufficient.\n\nWe disagree. Marquardt was asked to determine the value of damages assuming a lost easement\n\nand flooding–this is exactly what he did.\n\n                                    Surface Water Diversion\n\n       As previously noted, the Vogts sought damages for Marin’s alleged diversion of surface\n\nwater. In its seventh issue, Marin contends the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to\n\nsupport the jury’s findings of causation and damage with regard to this claim.\n\n       When reviewing a legal sufficiency or “no evidence challenge,” we determine “whether\n\nthe evidence at trial would enable reasonable and fair-minded people to reach the verdict under\n\nreview.” City of Keller v.

Id.\n\n                                             Causation\n\n       In challenging the sufficiency of the evidence supporting causation, Marin first contends\n\nthe speculative nature and basis of Godsey’s testimony–the only causation testimony with regard\n\nto surface water diversion–renders the evidence legally and factually insufficient. Because we\n\nhave held Godsey’s testimony was not speculative, and that it was based on more than anecdotal\n\nevidence, we hold this contention is without merit. Godsey’s testimony was based on more than\n\nMr. Vogts’ words and flooding photographs. Godsey based his testimony on his own experience\n\nregarding development of properties in light of surface water flow, his personal view of the\n\nproperties, and documents showing historical drainage patterns on the property.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 34 -\n\f                                                                                  04-10-00602-CV\n\n\n       Marin next contends that even if Godsey’s testimony is reliable, there is still “no\n\nevidence” of surface water diversion because Godsey’s testimony establishes the water that was\n\ndiverted was not “surface water” because the water allegedly diverted was controlled by a\n\nculvert. See TEX. WATER CODE ANN. § 11.086 (West 2008).\n\n       Section 11.086 of the Texas Water Code provides that no person may divert the natural\n\nflow of surface water in a manner that damages the property of another. Id. § 11.086(a). If a\n\nperson’s property is injured by an overflow of water caused by an unlawful diversion, that person\n\nmay seek remedies at law and in equity, including damages. Id. § 11.086(b).\n\n       Marin’s argument is based on its misplaced belief, as discussed with regard to the\n\nadmissibility of Godsey’s testimony, that the water that flooded the Vogts’ property was water\n\nfrom the culvert, and that the Vogts sought recovery because rainwater was improperly\n\ncontrolled by a ditch or culvert. Rather, the Vogts alleged surface water was diverted by an\n\nincrease in elevation, the building of earthen pads, and the deposit of debris and erection of\n\nbarriers. As we noted above, Godsey did not opine that the back up and overflow of water from\n\nthe culvert resulted in the flooding of the Vogts’ property. Rather, Godsey testified that when\n\nthe elevation of the development was increased relative to the Vogts’ property, historical\n\ndrainage patterns for surface water were altered and this caused the flooding. Thus, Godsey was\n\ntalking about surface water, i.e., water that is diffused over the ground from falling rain or\n\nmelting snow. See Dietrick v. Goodman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1495842\"><a href=\"/opinion/1495842/dietrich-v-goodman/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">413</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 419 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th\n\nDist.] 2004, no pet.). If anything, Godsey’s testimony was that surface water could not be\n\ncontrolled by the culvert because of the disparity in elevation between the development and the\n\nVogts’ property. Thus, we hold the evidence is legally sufficient to establish that the water\n\nwhich Godsey asserted flooded the Vogts’ property was not under the control of the culvert so as\n\n\n\n                                              - 35 -\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nto remove it from the category of surface water for purposes of section 11.086 of the Water\n\nCode. See id. (noting that chief characteristic of surface water is that it does not follow defined\n\ncourse or channel and does not gather into or form natural body of water). We hold this case\n\ninvolved a classic example of surface water – water diffused over the ground from falling rain –\n\ndiverted by a change in elevation because of the construction of the development. Accordingly,\n\nwe overrule this issue.\n\n                                            Damages\n\n       Marin also contends the evidence of damages for surface water diversion is insufficient–\n\nspecifically legally insufficient. Marin reurges its argument that the damage to the Vogts’ land\n\nby flooding, if any, was temporary, and therefore Marquardt used an improper damage model.\n\nFor the reasons discussed in the portion of the opinion reviewing the admissibility of\n\nMarquardt’s testimony, we overrule this issue.\n\n                                     Malicious Prosecution\n\n       In its eighth issue, Marin contends the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to\n\nsupport Mr. Vogts’ claim for malicious prosecution. We note Marin has not challenged, in any\n\nway, the jury’s damage award of $1,000,000.00 to Mr. Vogt based on his claim for malicious\n\nprosecution. Rather, Marin has challenged only certain elements of the claim. Specifically,\n\nMarin challenges the evidence to support the elements of procurement of prosecution, innocence,\n\nabsence of probable cause, and malice. We note that with regard to this issue, the jury finding in\n\nfavor of Mr. Vogt on malicious prosecution was against Marin only, not the individual property\n\nowners.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 - 36 -\n\f                                                                                     04-10-00602-CV\n\n\n                                       Standard of Review\n\n       The applicable standard of review is that previously stated for legal and factual\n\nsufficiency.

The fifth and sixth\n\nelements protect a defendant from a jury’s “natural inclination” to punish a defendant who\n\nerroneously, but with cause and no malice, commenced criminal proceedings that resulted in an\n\nexoneration. Suberu, 216 S.W.3d at 792.\n\n       To understand the origins of the criminal proceedings against Mr. Vogt, we must begin\n\nwith the July 26, 2006 Rule 11 agreement between Trada Partners and the Vogts. After the\n\n\n\n                                               - 37 -\n\f                                                                                   04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nVogts filed suit, they entered into a Rule 11 agreement with Trada Partners concerning the\n\neasement. In the Rule 11 agreement, the parties agreed, among other things, that the Vogts\n\nowned the easement and were entitled to “repair and maintain the Easement at their discretion”\n\nas long as they did not “unduly interfere with the servient estate,” i.e., the development. In\n\nAugust 2006, when the easement became impassable due to the activities of Trada Partners and\n\nMarin, the Vogts’ counsel advised counsel for Trada Partners and Marin by letter that if the\n\neasement were not restored to allow ingress and egress, the Vogts would exercise their rights\n\nunder the Rule 11 agreement to maintain the easement themselves. When no action was taken,\n\nthe Vogts hired a contractor to return the easement to its original condition, and the Vogts’\n\ncounsel notified the attorney who represented Marin as well as Trada Partners of their intentions.\n\nIn response, the attorney for Trada Partners and Marin asked for the name of the contractor in\n\norder to coordinate activities.    The Vogts’ attorney disclosed the name of the contractor.\n\nThereafter, someone from Trada Partners contacted the contractor, Bradley Construction, and\n\nthreatened “immediate legal action” if during the work on the easement there was any\n\nimpediment to the construction process or any trespass on property outside the easement.\n\nBradley Construction was also advised that if it worked on the easement, it would have to\n\ncontact counsel for Trada Partners and Marin because he would need to “depose [the company]\n\nregarding [the] exact and complete scope of work” it intended to perform for the Vogts. The\n\ncontractor, fearing involvement in the pending legal proceedings, refused to do the work for the\n\nVogts, as did any other contractor in the area.\n\n       The Vogts then attempted to do the work themselves, which ultimately resulted in a\n\nSeptember 19, 2006 report of criminal mischief and criminal trespass by Daniel Hill, a\n\nconstruction assistant superintendent for Trada Partners, to the Boerne Police Department. Hill\n\n\n\n                                                  - 38 -\n\f                                                                                   04-10-00602-CV\n\n\ntold the investigator dirt had been moved onto Trada Partner’s property, and there was damage\n\nfrom excavation and to fencing along the easement. Hill advised that Trada Partners would file\n\ncharges or criminal trespass and criminal mischief against those involved. On September 21,\n\n2006, Mr. Vogt went to the police department to speak to the Chief of Police about the incident.\n\nMr. Vogt admitting moving the dirt from the easement, but advised that Trada Partners had no\n\nauthority to impede his use of the easement. It seems nothing came of this initial report; no\n\ncharges were filed.\n\n       However, on Friday January 11, 2008, a second report involving Mr. Vogt and the\n\neasement was made to the Boerne Police Department. Susan Rogers, a Trada Partners employee,\n\nand the construction superintendent, Salvador Feliciano-Piedra, met with an officer concerning a\n\nreport of criminal mischief. Feliciano-Piedra advised the investigator that someone had cut\n\nsection of a steel fence and used orange spray paint to paint “Xs” on curbs, sidewalks, trees, and\n\nair conditioning units. Feliciano-Piedra advised the investigator about the ongoing lawsuit with\n\nthe Vogts, and eventually provided a damage estimate of between $8,924.72 and $31,864.72.\n\n       The investigator spoke with some workers who apparently witnessed the spray painting,\n\nbut he also spoke with John Sieckert, who was an officer with Trada Partners and associated with\n\nMarin. Sieckert called to advise that charges would be filed against the person responsible.\n\nSieckert told the investigator “Vogt had already damaged some of their properties when they first\n\nstarted construction.” Sieckert said he suspected Vogt was responsible for this criminal mischief\n\nas well.\n\n       The investigator then spoke with Mr. Vogt and his son. They provided the investigator\n\nwith a copy of the Rule 11 agreement, which gave the Vogts the right to maintain the easement.\n\nMr. Vogt admitted spray painting encroaching curbs, sidewalks, trees, and air conditioning units\n\n\n\n                                              - 39 -\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nand cutting the fence, but advised that he took the action because the damaged items obstructed\n\nhis easement. Thereafter, the investigator spoke with the attorney, who represented both Trada\n\nPartners and Marin. The attorney advised the investigator that this court’s opinion lifting the\n\ntemporary injunction overturned the Rule 11 agreement and gave “them the right to build on the\n\neasement since there are other ways for the Vogts to access the back property.” See Trada\n\nPartners VI, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">163181</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1. This court’s opinion did not hold as counsel for Trada\n\nPartners and Marin claimed, nor did the opinion in any way suggest such a result. See id.\n\nRather, our opinion merely held the Vogts had failed to establish irreparable harm for purposes\n\nof the temporary injunction. Id. We certainly did not state or even intimate that the existing\n\nRule 11 agreement was no longer effective, nor did we state or intimate that encroachment upon\n\nthe Vogts’ easement was permitted. Id. Nevertheless, counsel for Trada Partners and Marin told\n\nthe investigator he believed “Trada could completely block the easement since there is other\n\naccess.”\n\n       The investigator wanted to speak with Sieckert again, so he called him, but Sieckert was\n\nout. Sieckert called back and the investigator asked him to provide an affidavit regarding the\n\nfiling of charges. Sieckert stated he would designate Rogers as his agent for purposes of the\n\naffidavit, and that he would call her and have her contact investigators. At Sieckert’s request,\n\nRogers provided an affidavit in which she stated Sieckert designated her as his agent for\n\npurposes of filing charges and that she did wish to file charges for the property damage.\n\n       Thereafter, the investigator, who had been in contact with the Kendall County District\n\nAttorney’s office, obtained an arrest warrant for Mr. Vogt for the offense of criminal mischief, a\n\nstate jail felony given the estimated amount of damages. Mr. Vogt turned himself in, was\n\narrested, fingerprinted, and had his mug shot taken. Although Mr. Vogt was ultimately “no-\n\n\n\n                                               - 40 -\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nbilled” by the grand jury, he testified that as a former Chief Deputy Sheriff and constable, he was\n\nextremely embarrassed by the arrest, especially after his mug shot was broadcast on television\n\nand counsel for Trada Partners and Marin talked about the case on the news of a San Antonio\n\ntelevision station.\n\n        1. Procurement\n\n        Marin first argues there is no evidence or insufficient evidence to establish Marin\n\ninstigated or procured any criminal proceeding against Mr. Vogt. According to the Texas\n\nSupreme Court, procurement, which is the causation element of a malicious prosecution action,\n\noccurs when a person’s actions are enough to cause the prosecution, and but for the person’s\n\nactions the prosecution would not have occurred.

However, as\n\nthe Vogts point out, although a Trada Partners employee did make the initial call, there was\n\ninvolvement by Marin agents as well, specifically Marin’s attorney and Sieckert, and Trada\n\nPartners’s involvement does not permit Marin to escape liability because a criminal prosecution\n\nmay be procured by more than one person.

There is evidence in the record\n\nshowing the attorney, who represented not only Trada Partners but also Marin, provided\n\nextensive, but false, information to the Boerne Police Department investigator, essentially\n\nadvising him that Mr. Vogt had no right to the easement after our opinion in the temporary\n\ninjunction case. Additionally, Sieckert was involved in procuring the prosecution of Mr. Vogt.\n\nSieckert was not only a principal in Trada Partners, but according to evidence in the record, also\n\ninvolved in the operation of Marin. The Vogts’ exhibit 53, which was admitted into evidence, is\n\na letter from the Kendall County Abstract Company to “Mr. John W. Sieckert” at “Marin Real\n\nEstate Partners, LP,” enclosing a title commitment regarding the purchase of property in the\n\ndevelopment. And, Mr. Vogt testified it was his understanding that Sieckert “was also involved\n\nwith Marin Partners.” Marin never introduced any evidence to suggest Sieckert was not a\n\nprincipal or agent of Marin. Thus, there is some evidence Sieckert was associated not only with\n\nTrada Partners, but with Marin. Sieckert designated Rogers as his agent for the purposes of\n\nprocuring charges against Mr. Vogt by the submission of an affidavit. Moreover, Sieckert\n\nadvised the investigator that he wanted charges filed against the perpetrator and told the\n\ninvestigator “Vogt had already damaged some of their properties when they first started\n\nconstruction,” and he suspected Vogt was responsible for this criminal mischief as well.\n\n       Accordingly, we hold there is evidence a reasonable jury could have credited in order to\n\nfind Marin, along with Trada Partners, procured the prosecution, and that the evidence is not so\n\nweak as to render the jury’s verdict unjust.\n\n\n\n                                               - 42 -\n\f                                                                                     04-10-00602-CV\n\n\n       Marin posits a second argument as to procurement, stating that even if Marin did take\n\naction in assisting the investigator, there is still no evidence of procurement because it was up to\n\nlaw enforcement to decide whether to arrest and prosecute Mr. Vogt.

And, the jury could have found false\n\nthe statement provided by counsel for Trada Partners and Marin that the Vogts had been\n\nprovided a paved route to the one-acre tract, but refused to use it. Mr. Vogt testified at trial the\n\nhe did not receive a key to the gate on the paved road until a month before the 2009 trial, and he\n\ndid not receive the code for the gate at the other end of the paved road until he testified at trial\n\nthat he did not have the code. All of this was long after counsel for Trada Partners and Marin\n\n\n\n                                               - 43 -\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nprovided information to the investigator in 2008. Additionally, Sieckert advised the investigator\n\nin a phone call that Mr. Vogt had previously damaged “their properties,” which the jury could\n\nhave found was false based on Mr. Vogt’s testimony.          Mr. Vogt specifically testified the\n\ninformation provided by Sieckert was untrue, as was the information provided by the attorney.\n\n       Based on the foregoing, we hold there is evidence a reasonable jury could have credited\n\nin order to find that the attorney for Trada Partners and Marin and Sieckert, as agents of Marin,\n\nprovided false information to authorities, thereby placing Marin within the exception to the rule\n\nthat procurement is negated if the prosecution is actually instituted by law enforcement.\n\n       2. Innocence\n\n       Marin next argues the evidence is legally and factually insufficient as to the element of\n\ninnocence. Marin contends the grand jury’s failure to indict Mr. Vogt is insufficient to establish\n\nhis innocence, arguing the Vogts were required to provide more proof. Marin argues the Vogts\n\ncannot provide such evidence because Mr. Vogt admitted “vandalizing” the property, but simply\n\nescaped prosecution for his crime.\n\n       A person commits the offense of criminal mischief if, without the effective consent of the\n\nowner, he intentionally or knowingly damages, destroys, tampers with, or makes markings on the\n\nowner’s tangible property. TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. § 28.03 (West 2011) (emphasis added). We\n\nhold there is evidence from which the jury could have determined Mr. Vogt did not act “without\n\nthe effective consent of the owner” when he cut the fence and spray painted the items\n\nencroaching upon his easement.\n\n       At trial, the Vogts introduced the Rule 11 agreement, which was signed by counsel for\n\nTrada Partners and Marin. Pertinent portions of the agreement were read to the jury, specifically\n\nthose portions recognizing the Vogts’ ownership of the easement and their right to “repair and\n\n\n\n                                               - 44 -\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nmaintain the Easement at their discretion so long as not to unduly interfere with the servient\n\nestate.” And, contrary to counsel’s assertion, our opinion in the temporary injunction appeal did\n\nnot vacate or otherwise overturn this agreement. See Trada Partners VI, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">163181</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at\n\n*1. In fact, the Rule 11 agreement is not mentioned anywhere in our opinion. Id. Mr. Vogt\n\ntestified that he took the actions he did in January of 2008, cutting the fence and marking\n\nsidewalks, curbs, and air conditioning units, in preparation for removing them from the\n\neasement.\n\n       We hold, based on the Rule 11 agreement and Mr. Vogt’s testimony, there was sufficient\n\nevidence, both legally and factually, for the jury to answer Question 18. More specifically, the\n\njury could have found, pursuant to the Rule 11 agreement, that Mr. Vogt had the consent of the\n\nowner to take the actions he did, especially given that all of the items cut and marked were on the\n\neasement, and not on the servient estate.\n\n       In two sentences, Marin also complains that because there was no issue submitted to the\n\njury on “innocence,” the trial court erred in rending judgment for the Vogts on the malicious\n\nprosecution claim.

Probable Cause\n\n       Marin next challenges the sufficiency of the evidence on the element of probable cause.\n\nMarin correctly points out that a malicious prosecution case begins with the presumption that the\n\ndefendant acted reasonably and had probable cause to initiate the prosecution. See Suberu, 216\n\nS.W.3d at 793. However, the plaintiff can rebut this presumption by producing evidence that the\n\nmotives, grounds, beliefs, or other information upon which the defendant acted did not constitute\n\n\n\n                                                  - 46 -\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00602-CV\n\n\nprobable cause.    Id.   Marin contends the Vogts failed to produce evidence to rebut the\n\npresumption that Marin had probable cause to report Mr. Vogt for the offense of criminal\n\nmischief. Marin also points out that when it reasonably appears to a citizen that a crime has been\n\ncommitted, the citizen has no duty before filing charges to inquire as to whether the suspect\n\nmight have had an alibi or explanation for his action. See id. at 794; First Valley Bank v. Martin,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894602\"><a href=\"/opinion/894602/first-valley-bank-of-los-fresnos-v-martin/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 470 (Tex. 2004).\n\n       Marin is correct regarding the presumption and the absence of duty to inquire as to why\n\nthe person against whom charges are filed acted as he did. However, the Vogts counter that the\n\nrecord is replete with evidence they produced showing Marin filed charges against Mr. Vogt not\n\nbecause they sincerely believed he had committed criminal mischief, but because Marin and\n\nTrada Partners, through their agents, were doing anything and everything in their power to\n\nintimidate the Vogts into giving up their easement and to gain an advantage against the Vogts in\n\nthe civil suit. Thus, according to the Vogts, they rebutted the presumption, the burden shifted to\n\nMarin to establish probable cause, and the issue became one for the jury. See Thrift v. Hubbard,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2418612\"><a href=\"/opinion/2418612/thrift-v-hubbard/\"><span class=\"volume\">974</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 79 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1998, pet. denied).\n\n       The Vogts point to evidence showing: (1) Sieckert’s hostility toward the Vogts–“If you\n\nthink . . . we’re going to change our plans because you say that’s your easement . . . you’re\n\ngreatly mistaken.”; (2) Sieckert’s increasing frustration with the Vogts’ refusal to give up the\n\neasement, e.g., Sieckert’s statement to Pape-Dawson Construction about the Vogts’ complaints\n\nand attempts to stop the development; (3) intimidation of a contractor who planned to assist the\n\nVogts in clearing the easement; (4) Sieckert’s knowledge from the outset that the Vogts owned\n\nthe easement; (5) the Rule 11 agreement, memorializing the Vogts’ rights to use and maintain the\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 47 -\n\f                                                                                   04-10-00602-CV\n\n\neasement; and (6) the provision of false evidence to authorities by Sieckert and counsel for Trada\n\nPartners and Marin during the criminal mischief investigation.\n\n       This is certainly some evidence rebutting the presumption that Marin filed charges\n\nagainst Mr. Vogt simply because he cut some fencing and spray painted sidewalks and air\n\nconditioning units belonging to Trada Partners and Marin. The jury could have believed filing\n\ncharges was the culmination of a campaign by Trada Partners and Marin to wrest the easement\n\nfrom the Vogts by whatever means possible. See, e.g., Thrift, 974 S.W.2d at 79-80 (holding jury\n\ncould have found defendant filed criminal complaint “to gain an advantage in the civil litigation\n\nstemming from these same facts.”).      And although we recognize a person has no duty to\n\ninvestigate if there was some reason to justify an accused’s action, Marin had no need to\n\ninvestigate in this case because it knew Mr. Vogt was simply doing what he had been trying to\n\ndo all along–retain the use of his easement and maintain it for use as permitted under the Rule 11\n\nagreement. See Suberu, 216 S.W.3d at 794; Martin, 144 S.W.3d at 470.\n\n       Marin did not present any testimony to establish probable cause once the Vogts presented\n\nevidence rebutting the presumption. In fact, the only evidence presented by Marin was the\n\ntestimony of a single property owner who testified she did not design or develop anything, but\n\nsimply purchased the property as an investment. Accordingly, we hold there was evidence from\n\nwhich the jury could have found an absence of probable cause.\n\n       4. Malice\n\n       Finally, Marin contends there was no evidence or insufficient evidence of malice by\n\nMarin. Marin argues that because it had a legal right to report Mr. Vogt’s vandalism, there can\n\nbe no finding of malice. See Closs v. Goose Creek Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2438153\"><a href=\"/opinion/2438153/closs-v-goose-creek-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">859</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n878 (Tex.

Id. Malice can be established by either direct or\n\ncircumstantial evidence and may be inferred from a lack of probable cause. Thrift, 974 S.W.2d\n\nat 80.\n\n         Of course a person has the legal right to report a crime. See Closs, 874 S.W.2d at 878.\n\nHowever, if a person reports a crime with an improper purpose, or in reckless disregard of the\n\nrights of another in a knowing and unreasonable manner, that is malice. Id. With regard to this\n\ncase, given the evidence that Marin lacked probable cause to report Mr. Vogt, and that it acted to\n\nintimidate the Vogts or gain an advantage in the civil suit, the jury could have inferred Marin\n\nacted with “ill will or evil motive.” Moreover, malice is shown by the false statements provided\n\nto investigators by Sieckert and counsel for Trada Partners and Marin regarding Mr. Vogt’s prior\n\nactions and the status of the Vogts’ rights to the easement, as well as their failure to disclose the\n\nexistence of the Rule 11 agreement and the Vogts’ rights thereunder when first questioned by the\n\ninvestigator. See, e.g., Richey, 952 S.W.2d at 519-20 (holding that in malicious prosecution\n\naction, failing to fully and fairly disclose all relevant facts or knowingly providing false\n\ninformation to police is relevant to malicious intent of defendant); Thrift, 974 S.W.2d at 80\n\n(holding defendant’s failure to disclose exculpatory facts was sufficient to demonstrate malice).\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 49 -\n\f                                                                                     04-10-00602-CV\n\n\n       Based on the standards of review, the applicable law, and the evidence, we hold there was\n\nsufficient evidence, which the jury could have credited and believed, to sustain the Vogts’ claim\n\nfor malicious prosecution. As previously noted, jurors are the sole judges of the credibility of the\n\nwitnesses and the weight to be given their testimony, and may believe one witness and not\n\nanother. City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 819.\n\n                           Effect of Default Judgment Against Trada\n\n       As noted above, when the trial court called the case for trial on May 5, 2009, Trada\n\nPartners, which had filed an answer, failed to appear. The case proceeded to trial and verdict\n\nwithout Trada Partners. Thereafter, on October 12, 2009, the trial court entered a default\n\njudgment against Trada Partners and in favor of the Vogts. The default judgment recites that it\n\n“disposes of all issues and claims as between John E. Vogt and Nelda L. Vogt and Trada\n\nPartners VI, LP.” The judgment further states that it is severed, but failed to assign a separate\n\ndocket number.\n\n       Marin suggests, in its ninth issue, that the rendition of the default judgment against Trada\n\nPartners and the subsequent rendition of a separate judgment disposing of the Vogts’ claims\n\nagainst Marin violates the “one judgment rule” contained in Rule 301 of the Texas Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure. In support of its contention, Marin argues the default judgment was a final judgment,\n\nand given the absence of a severance, the subsequent rendition of judgment against Marin was\n\nprohibited by Rule 301.\n\n       First, there is nothing in the record showing Marin raised this issue in the trial court.\n\nAlthough we have found no cases specifically holding that a complaint involving violation of the\n\n“one judgment rule” requires an objection in the trial court before it can be asserted on appeal,\n\nRule 33.1(a) of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure states that before a complaint can be\n\n\n\n                                               - 50 -\n\f                                                                                     04-10-00602-CV\n\n\npresented for appellate review, the record must show the complaint was presented to the trial\n\ncourt by “timely request, objection, or motion” that states the ground for the ruling sought with\n\nsufficient specificity to make the trial court aware of the complaint, and the trial court ruled.\n\nTEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a). The only exceptions to the preservation requirement of Rule 33.1(a) in\n\ncivil cases are rare instances of “fundamental error,” which the supreme court has held includes\n\ncases in which the face of the record shows the court lacked jurisdiction or in certain types of\n\nerror in juvenile delinquency cases.

Given Marin’s failure to bring this issue to the attention of the trial court, any error is\n\nwaived. However, even if Marin had not waived this issue, it has no substantive merit.\n\n       Substantively, Marin contends there was no severance in this case, making the October\n\n12, 2009 default judgment the “sole final judgment,” and thereby precluding the subsequent\n\njudgment rendered in April 2010 against Marin. Marin is incorrect.\n\n       When the trial court rendered the default judgment against Trada Partners, it specifically\n\nstated in the judgment that the judgment against Trada Partners “is hereby severed from this\n\ncause.” Marin seems to contend this was not effective to sever the Vogts’ claims against Trada\n\nPartners from the remainder of the suit because: (1) there was no separate severance order, or the\n\nlanguage in the judgment was somehow conditional; and (2) the trial court failed to include a\n\ndocket number in the judgment for the severed cause, rendering the severance ineffective.\n\n       First, Marin has cited no authority for the proposition that a severance must be contained\n\nin an order separate from the judgment. There is nothing in Texas law to prohibit a trial court\n\nfrom including a severance order within the judgment to be severed–in fact, this is quite\n\n\n\n                                               - 51 -\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00602-CV\n\n\ncommon. Moreover, the language in the trial court’s order was not conditional; rather, the court\n\nspecifically ordered the judgment against Trada Partners severed from the Vogts’ claims against\n\nthe remaining defendants. Accordingly, the severance was not ineffective for either of these\n\nreasons.\n\n       Nor is the severance ineffective because it failed to assign a docket number to the severed\n\ncause. Although the judgment stated it was assigned a new docket number, the blank for the new\n\ndocket number was not filled in, i.e., no new docket number was assigned to the severed cause.\n\nThe supreme court has held the granting of a severance is effective when signed.

See id.\n\n       Therefore, contrary to Marin’s assertions, there was an effective severance. The question\n\nthen becomes, what effect does an effective severance have on Marin’s “one judgment rule”\n\nargument? The answer: it defeats it.\n\n       A severance divides a lawsuit into two or more separate and independent causes that may\n\nbe resolved separately.
