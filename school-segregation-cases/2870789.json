S 1983 case is before us on interlocutory\nappeal. The defendants, members of the Gander Hill Prison\n\fMulti-Disciplinary Team (\"MDT\") and the Delaware\nDepartment of Corrections Central Institutional\nClassification Committee (\"CICC\"), challenge the District\nCourt’s denial of their summary judgment motion for\nabsolute or qualified immunity from Delaware prisoner\nJerome Hamilton’s lawsuit alleging violations of the Eighth\nAmendment. The defendants contend that they are entitled\nto absolute immunity because they acted pursuant to a\ncourt order or otherwise in a quasi-judicial capacity.\nAlternatively, they argue that they should receive qualified\nimmunity because they did not violate Hamilton’s Eighth\nAmendment rights or because their actions were objectively\nreasonable. We agree with the District Court that on this\nrecord the defendants are not absolutely immune on the\nground that they acted pursuant to a court order. We\nremand, however, for the District Court to analyze under\nthe legal tests noted below whether the defendants are\nentitled either to absolute immunity for acting in a quasi-\njudicial capacity or to qualified immunity.\n\n                                2\n\n\nFACTS1\n\nOn August 5, 1992, Hamilton’s cellmate in Delaware’s\nGander Hill prison attacked and injured him.2 Hamilton\nalleges that his cellmate was able to commit this assault\nbecause the defendant prison officials acted with deliberate\nindifference to his safety.\n\nHamilton has been the victim of numerous attacks from\nother inmates throughout his lengthy stint in the Delaware\nprison system, some of which we described in a prior\nappeal in this case. See Hamilton v. Leavy, 117 F.3d 742,\n744-45 (3d Cir. 1997) (Hamilton I). For Hamilton’s safety,\nprison officials have transferred him among various prisons\nboth in and outside Delaware and have placed him in\nprotective custody.\n\nIn 1986 Hamilton cooperated with a drug trafficking\ninvestigation at the Gander Hill prison that ended with the\narrest of prison officials and inmates. He became known as\na \"snitch\" and, as a result, prison officials repeatedly had to\nplace him in protective custody. In 1990 prison officials\ntransferred Hamilton to a Virginia prison \"[b]ecause there\nappeared to be no safe place for Hamilton in the Delaware\nprisons.\" Id. at 745.\n\nAfter the move to Virginia, however, Hamilton initiated\ntwo civil lawsuits in Delaware state courts, and he was\nreturned in December 1991 to the Gander Hill prison to\nenable him to prosecute those actions effectively. He\nbrought one of the lawsuits against state officials. Deputy\nAttorney General John Polk defended that case. Judge\nClarence Taylor of the Delaware Superior Court, who\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. The District Court ruled on the defendants’ motion for summary\njudgment and so viewed the facts in the light most favorable to\n\fHamilton, the non-moving party. As we explain below, we do not have\njurisdiction to review the District Court’s fact-finding in this case. We\ntherefore rely upon its opinion to lay out the facts upon which we rule,\nas well as our prior opinion in Hamilton v. Leavy, 117 F.3d 742 (3d Cir.\n1997), to which the District Court referred readers for further factual\nbackground.\n\n2. We follow the practice of the parties and the District Court by referring\nto the prison by its colloquial name, Gander Hill; its official title is the\nMulti-Purpose Criminal Justice Facility.\n\n                                3\n\n\npresided over the case, held a hearing on December 13,\n1991, and addressed the question where Hamilton could be\nhoused while discovery took place.\n\nDeputy A.G. Polk suggested to the Court that Hamilton\nbe kept in Delaware for a \"month or so.\" When Judge\nTaylor expressed concern that the Delaware prison system\nbe able to take the \"special precautions\" necessary for\nHamilton, Polk volunteered to check with the appropriate\nofficials whether this was possible, and the Court granted\na recess for him to do so. After the recess, Polk informed\nthe Court that an official from the Delaware Department of\nCorrections Compact had \"reiterated to [him] that Mr.\nHamilton is in need of protective custody,\" but that the\nDepartment could \"accommodate\" Hamilton for two months\nat either Gander Hill or the Sussex Correctional Institution.\nPolk then stated that he had requested that the\nDepartment keep Hamilton at Gander Hill.3\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. The exchange went as follows:\n\n       The Court: . . . [O]n your suggestion that   he be kept here in\n       Delaware for the next month or so, I think   that ought to be cleared\n       with the prison people because it involves   special precautions . . . ,\n       whether they are in a position to maintain   those-- that precaution\n       during the period you’re talking about.\n\n       Deputy A.G.: I would undertake that task of clearing it with the\n       Department, Your Honor.\n\n        . . .\n\n       The Court: . . . [I]f it doesn’t pose a problem to the prison\n       administration for him to be detained up here for a month or longer\n       in order for him to have access to the lawbooks and get out his\n       discovery and so on while he’s up here, then that would seem like\n       the best solution to move this case forward from where it is today.\n       . . .\n\n       [Recess held to allow the Deputy A.G. to check with prison officials\n       regarding housing Hamilton in Delaware.]\n\n       Deputy A.G.: Your Honor, I’ve called the deputy administrator for the\n       Delaware Department of Corrections Compact and they’ve indicated\n       that a one to two-month stay by Mr. Hamilton in Delaware is\n\f       something they can accommodate.\n\n                                4\n\n\nThe Court next informed Hamilton:\n\n       Let’s leave it that way, then. So, you’ll -- you are to be\n       detained up here at the State Gander Hill Prison for a\n       length of time up to two months, and it will be\n       dependent [on] what reports I get back from the Deputy\n       Attorney General, from you and what progress is made\n       toward resolving this thing without further trial. .. .\n       Prison will have you up to two months and during that\n       time Mr. Polk will cooperate with you and try to work\n       out something . . . .\n\nThe docket entry for December 13 states: \"Detained at\nGander Hill up to 2 months in protective custody.\"\n\nHamilton was still at the Gander Hill prison on March 5,\n1992, almost three months later, when Judge Taylor sent a\nletter to the Deputy A.G.:\n\n        At a hearing held on December 13, 1991, you were\n       ordered to supply petitioner Jerome Hamilton with\n       answers to petitioner’s requests for admissions by\n       December 27, 1991 . . . .\n\n        [T]he Interstate Corrections Compact Administrator\n       has contacted my office to see if the petitioner can be\n       returned to the prison from which he had been\n       transferred for the purpose of resolving this case.\n\n        You have failed to comply with my order of December\n       13, 1991. If Gander Hill Prison needs action, then you\n       should take immediate action to comply with the order\n       of December 13, 1991. Until you comply with the\n       Order, there is no alternative but to keep petitioner\n       Hamilton at the Gander Hill facility.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n       The Court: They can?\n\n       Deputy A.G.: They can accommodate. She reiterated to me that Mr.\n       Hamilton is in need of protective custody, and I said can you\n       accommodate him in Delaware. She said he can be accommodated\n       in Gander Hill or SCI [Sussex Correctional Institution]. My request\n       of the Department -- and I don’t think that there would be a\n       problem in adhering to this -- is that he be housed up here in\n       Gander Hill.\n\n                                5\n\n\n        IT IS SO ORDERED.\n\nLater that month, Hamilton, still in the Gander Hill\nprison, filed a grievance against a correctional officer there\nfor calling him in front of other prisoners \"a good telling\n\fmother f_____g snitcher.\" Witnesses confirmed this incident.\nThe Resident Grievance Resolution Committee, composed of\nfive prison officials, recommended to the Deputy Warden\nthat \"a thorough investigation\" take place because\ncomments that a prisoner is a \"snitch\" have the potential to\ncause \"a major disturbance and require[ ] immediate\naction.\" The Deputy Warden concluded on June 15, 1992,\nthat the correctional officer did make the statement.\n\nThree days later, the MDT -- made up of defendants\nFaith Leavy, Pamela Faulkner (now Minor), and William\nQueener -- reviewed Hamilton’s file, summarized his\nsituation in a written report, and unanimously\nrecommended that he be placed in protective custody. After\nreviewing the MDT report and recommendation, the CICC,\nwhich had the authority to place Hamilton in protective\ncustody, decided on June 24, 1992, to take \"no action\" on\nthe report, which meant that Hamilton remained without\nadditional safety precautions in the Gander Hill general\nprison population. The members of the CICC are also\ndefendants in this lawsuit.\n\nA month after the \"no action\" decision, inmate Steven\nClayton joined the prison population at Gander Hill and\nsometime before August 5, 1992, became Hamilton’s\ncellmate. That day, Clayton attacked Hamilton, fracturing\nhis jaw and sending him to the hospital, where he had two\nmetal plates inserted. Clayton pled guilty to the assault and\nstated that he attacked Hamilton because he was\"a\nsnitcher on inmates and officers\" at Gander Hill.\n\nCoincidentally, on the same day as the assault (August\n5), Judge Haile Alford, who had taken over Hamilton’s civil\ncase in the Delaware Superior Court when Judge Taylor\nretired, wrote a letter to Hamilton, informing him:\n\n       Judge Taylor ordered you held at Gander Hill until the\n       Deputy Attorney General had attempted to resolve this\n       matter with you without further trial. A review of the\n       file in this case reveals that Deputy Attorney General\n\n                                6\n\n\n       John Polk, after writing to the Court anticipating a\n       settlement of this claim[,] has requested a trial date\n       and that a Scheduling Order in this matter has been\n       entered, setting a trial date of March 31, 1993.\n\n       The letter from the Court dated March 5, 1992, does\n       not order that you are to be held at Gander Hill until\n       the completion of your case. Because this case is now\n       set down for trial, the conditions that caused you to be\n       incarcerated at Gander Hill have changed, and there is\n       no longer a reason in [this case] for you to remain at\n       that specific facility.\n\nPROCEEDINGS\n\nHamilton filed this S 1983 lawsuit on June 20, 1994, in\n\fthe District Court for the District of Delaware against MDT\nmembers Leavy, Faulkner, and Queener, and against\nFrances Lewis, chair of the CICC, alleging deliberate\nindifference to Hamilton’s safety in violation of his Eighth\nAmendment right to be free of cruel and unusual\npunishment. The Court entered summary judgment in favor\nof the MDT defendants because they \"were without\nauthority to effectuate their own recommendation that\nHamilton be placed in protective custody, [and therefore]\nthey could not be found to have deliberately disregarded\nserious risks to his safety.\" Hamilton I, 117 F.3d at 748.\nThe Court also granted summary judgment to defendant\nLewis on the ground that no reasonable factfinder could\nfind that she knew that keeping Hamilton in the Gander\nHill general prison population without additional safety\nprecautions put Hamilton in substantial risk of suffering\nserious harm.\n\nHamilton appealed, and in June 1997 our Court\nreversed. See id. at 744. As to the MDT defendants, we\nnoted Hamilton’s argument that the MDT could have\nprovided him with additional protection by, for instance,\nputting him in administrative segregation, even if the MDT\ndid not have the authority to place him in protective\ncustody. See id. at 748. We concluded that the \"failure of\nthe MDT defendants to take additional steps beyond the\nrecommendation of protective custody could be viewed by a\n\n                                7\n\n\nfactfinder as the sort of deliberate indifference to inmate\nsafety that the Constitution forbids.\" Id. at 749. As to\ndefendant Lewis, we explained that she \"was made aware of\na substantial risk to Hamilton’s safety when she reviewed\nthe MDT’s unanimous recommendation to place Hamilton\nin protective custody\" and, accordingly, that\"a factfinder\ncould infer that Lewis knew that the threat to Hamilton’s\nsafety was imminent.\" Id. at 747.\n\nBack in the District Court, Hamilton amended his\ncomplaint to add additional defendants: George Dixon, Jack\nStephenson, Deborah Craig, Joanne Smith, Dennis Loebe,\nEldora Tillery, Francis Cockroft, Jerry Borga, and Richard\nShockley, all members of CICC when the assault occurred.\nOn July 27, 2001, the District Court denied the defendants’\nsecond motion for summary judgment. They timely\nappealed.\n\nJURISDICTION\n\nWe generally have jurisdiction to review only \"final\ndecisions\" of district courts. 28 U.S.C. S 1291. A denial of\nsummary judgment, from which the defendants appeal\nhere, usually does not qualify as a final decision for\npurposes of S 1291 because, far from finally deciding the\ncase, it is a decision to permit the litigation to continue. See\nGiuffre v. Bissell, 31 F.3d 1241, 1245 (3d Cir. 1994). Under\nthe collateral order doctrine, however, we have jurisdiction\nto review the District Court’s decision if it (1) conclusively\n\fdetermines a disputed question, (2) resolves an important\nissue completely separate from the merits of the action, and\n(3) is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final\njudgment. See Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 524-25\n(1985) (citing Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337\nU.S. 541, 546 (1949)).\n\nPre-trial denials of absolute or qualified immunity are\nfrequently appropriate for appellate review under the\ncollateral order doctrine. An appeal from such a denial may\nconclusively determine the disputed question of the\ndefendants’ entitlement to immunity, a question that is\nconceptually separate from the merits of the case. See id. at\n527-28. And because immunity is intended to protect the\n\n                                  8\n\n\ndefendant \"from   suit,\" id. at 526 (emphasis in original) --\nnot simply from   an adverse judgment at the conclusion of\nlitigation -- a   grant of immunity after a final judgment\n\"would come too   late.\" Johnson v. Jones , 515 U.S. 304, 312\n(1995).\n\nWe have jurisdiction to review a pre-trial denial of\nimmunity under the collateral order doctrine only to the\nextent that it raises questions of law. See Giuffre, 31 F.3d\nat 1245 (\"[A]n order denying qualified or absolute\nimmunity, to the extent that the order turns on an issue of\nlaw, is immediately appealable under the collateral order\ndoctrine.\") (citation omitted). We may not review the District\nCourt’s \"identification of the facts that are subject to\ngenuine dispute,\" but instead we review the legal issues in\nlight of the facts that the District Court determined had\nsufficient evidentiary support for summary judgment\npurposes. See Ziccardi v. City of Philadelphia , 288 F.3d 57,\n59, 61 (3d Cir. 2002).4 And, of course, we give de novo\nreview to those legal issues. Giuffre, 31 F.3d at 1251.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nA. Absolute immunity for actions taken pursuant to a\n       court order\n\nThe defendants assert that they should receive absolute\nimmunity from Hamilton’s claim that they violated the\nEighth Amendment because the conduct (or lack thereof)\nfor which they are sued was taken pursuant to a court\norder. As the defendants see it, the Superior Court’s orders\n-- Judge Taylor’s December 13 oral decision and docket\norder and his March 5 letter to the Deputy A.G.--\nprohibited the defendants from moving Hamilton from the\nGander Hill prison. The defendants argue that the Delaware\nprison system did not at that time provide for protective\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. The facts sufficiently proven for summary judgment purposes include\nthose facts not subject to genuine dispute as well as those facts that are\nsubject to such dispute, viewed in the light most favorable to Hamilton,\nthe non-moving party. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242,\n\f255 (1986) (\"The evidence of the non-movant is to be believed, and all\njustifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.\").\n\n                                9\n\n\ncustody at Gander Hill, so they could not have placed\nHamilton in protective custody without violating the\nSuperior Court’s order to keep him at Gander Hill.\n\nThe defendants are correct that action taken pursuant to\na facially valid court order receives absolute immunity from\nS 1983 lawsuits for damages. See Wolfe v. City of Pittsburgh,\n140 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1998); Richman v. Sheahan, 270\nF.3d 430, 437 (7th Cir. 2001).5 The District Court so\nrecognized but nonetheless denied the defendants’ motion\nfor absolute immunity because they had not established\nthat they acted pursuant to a court order. The Court\nconcluded instead that the Superior Court’s orders did not\nprohibit the defendants from moving Hamilton from the\nGander Hill prison to another facility in order to place him\nin protective custody and that, even if the orders had\nprohibited such action, they did not also prevent the\ndefendants from otherwise providing Hamilton with effective\nprotection at Gander Hill.\n\nHamilton contends, however, that the question whether\nthe defendants acted pursuant to an order of the Superior\nCourt is one of fact and therefore an issue we cannot\naddress. In the end, whether a defendant is entitled to\nabsolute immunity is a question of law, see Carver v.\nFoerster, 102 F.3d 96, 99 (3d Cir. 1996) (\"Absolute\nimmunity is an issue of law . . . .\"); In re Montgomery\nCounty, 215 F.3d 367, 372 (3d Cir. 2000) (\"Absolute\nimmunity is a purely legal question . . . .\"), but we agree\nwith Hamilton that this ultimately legal issue can also\ninvolve factual questions.\n\nIndeed, in Lockhart v. Hoenstine, 411 F.2d 455 (3d Cir.\n1969), we treated the question whether a defendant acted\npursuant to a court order -- the question presented here --\nas one of fact. Id. at 460. The disputed question there\nconcerned whether a court had issued an order to the\ndefendant -- the court’s prothonotary -- not to accept the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. This type of immunity is sometimes referred to as \"quasi-judicial\"\nimmunity. We reserve this moniker, however, for another form of\nimmunity asserted by the defendants (for acting in a role that is\nfunctionally comparable to that of a judge, rather than under the\nauthority of a court order), discussed in Section B below.\n\n                                10\n\n\nplaintiff ’s papers for filing. Id. at 457-58. Here, in contrast,\nthe key issue is not factually whether the Superior Court\nentered an order at all, but is instead what the Superior\nCourt’s orders mean. This is a question of law, see Apex\nFountain Sales, Inc. v. Kleinfeld, 818 F.2d 1089, 1097 (3d\n\fCir. 1987) (The \"construction of . . . [a] court order\" is \"a\npurely legal issue.\"), which we can review. We turn now to\nthat question.\n\nThe defendants repeat to this Court their contention,\nrejected by the District Court, that the Superior Court’s\norders forbade them from moving Hamilton from the\nGander Hill prison to another facility where he could be\nplaced in protective custody. We agree with the District\nCourt’s conclusion.\n\nThe Superior Court’s order of December 13, 1991, did not\nby itself prohibit moving Hamilton. To recap, on December\n13 Judge Taylor agreed to the Deputy A.G.’s request that\nHamilton be detained in a Delaware prison only after\nreceiving assurances that the Delaware Department of\nCorrections could take the \"special precautions\" necessary\nfor Hamilton’s safety. It was at the Deputy A.G.’s request\nthat the Superior Court ordered that Hamilton be kept at\nGander Hill rather than at the Sussex Correctional\nInstitution. And the December 13 docket entry states that\nHamilton is to be housed at Gander Hill \"up to 2 months in\nprotective custody.\"\n\nThe December 13, 1991 colloquy with Judge Taylor\n(which in his March 5, 1992 letter he referred to as an\norder) did not require Hamilton’s detention for more than a\nperiod of two months at Gander Hill, instead of at Sussex\nor another prison. But especially it cannot be interpreted to\nhave required his detention at Gander Hill if the prison\nofficials there became unable (or unwilling) to keep\nHamilton in \"protective custody\" or to provide some other\nform of \"special precautions\" for his safety. Accordingly, the\norder did not prohibit the MDT or the CICC in the summer\nof 1992 (the key time period) from placing Hamilton in a\nfacility that could provide him with protective custody.\n\nWe reach the same conclusion as to the March 5 letter.\nAgain, that letter, addressed to Deputy A.G. Polk,\n\n                                11\n\n\nconcluded: \"Until you comply with the Order, there is no\nalternative but to keep petitioner Hamilton at the Gander\nHill facility.\" This statement did not require that the\ndefendants keep Hamilton at Gander Hill indefinitely, as\nthey seem to argue. Instead, it explicitly states that it will\noperate only until the time that the Deputy A.G. complied\nwith \"the Order.\" Read in context, the \"Order\" with which\nthe Deputy A.G. must comply refers to the Superior Court’s\nDecember 13 order that the Deputy A.G. participate in\ndiscovery, communicate with Hamilton, and inform the\nCourt of the results of this process.\n\nJudge Alford’s letter of August 5 is in accord with our\nunderstanding of the March 5 letter. She explained that\n\"Judge Taylor ordered [Hamilton] held at Gander Hill until\nthe Deputy Attorney General had attempted to resolve this\nmatter with [Hamilton] without further trial.\" And further:\n\f\"The letter from the Court dated March 5, 1992, does not\norder that [Hamilton was] to be held at Gander Hill until\nthe completion of [the civil] case.\" Finally, Judge Alford’s\nletter also tells us that by August 5 the Deputy A.G. had\nreported to the Superior Court on the progress of the civil\nsuit litigation and that trial had been set, putting an end to\nthe March 5 requirement that Hamilton stay at Gander Hill.\n\nAccordingly, neither of the Superior Court orders explains\nadequately the defendants’ failure to remove Hamilton from\nGander Hill. They are therefore not entitled to absolute\nimmunity on this ground.\n\nThe District Court also held that the Superior Court’s\norders \"would not have prevented the defendants from\nproviding Hamilton with effective protection at Gander Hill\"\nand thus, on this ground as well, the orders did not provide\nabsolute immunity to the defendants. We again agree with\nthe District Court.\n\nThe Tenth Circuit has addressed an analogous issue. In\nTurney v. O’Toole, 898 F.2d 1470 (10th Cir. 1990), also a\nS 1983 case, a state court ordered the seventeen-year-old\nplaintiff confined at a state hospital for mental health\ntreatment. Id. at 1471. At the hospital, the plaintiff was\nplaced in the adult maximum security unit. Id. at 1472.\n\"When efforts to find a more suitable placement failed,\" the\n\n                                12\n\n\nplaintiff obtained a writ of habeas corpus ordering his\nrelease. Id. The plaintiff then sued the superintendent and\na psychologist at the hospital, alleging violations of S 1983.\nThe District Court granted absolute immunity to the\ndefendants on the ground that they were acting pursuant\nto the court order. Id.\n\nThe Tenth Circuit reversed in part, holding that the\ndefendants \"were absolutely immune from liability arising\nfrom the fact of [the plaintiff ’s] confinement, but that they\nwere only qualifiedly immune from liability arising from the\nconditions in which he was held.\" Id. The Court explained:\n\n       [T]his absolute immunity [for the plaintiff ’s\n       confinement] extended only to acts prescribed by[the\n       court’s] order, . . . and . . . all the order decreed was\n       [the plaintiff ’s] confinement at [the hospital]. It did not\n       dictate any specific placement or treatment within the\n       facility. Therefore, the defendants are not absolutely\n       immune from liability arising from [the plaintiff ’s]\n       placement in the maximum security ward.\n\nId. at 1474 (citations omitted); see also Nixon v. Fitzgerald,\n457 U.S. 731, 755 (1982) (\"In defining the scope of an\nofficial’s absolute privilege, this Court has recognized that\nthe sphere of protected action must be related closely to the\nimmunity’s justifying purposes.\").\n\nThe Superior Court’s orders entered in this case did not\n\fdirect the defendants -- expressly or otherwise-- to confine\nHamilton in conditions that they knew posed a substantial\nrisk of serious harm. The Superior Court’s concern that a\nDelaware facility take \"special precautions\" to ensure\nHamilton’s safety and the December 13 docket entry noting\nthat Hamilton was to be kept in \"protective custody\" made\nclear that he must remain safe.\n\nEven if the Superior Court had not stated such explicit\nconcern for Hamilton’s safety (indeed ordered that he be\nplaced in protective custody), nothing else in the Court’s\norders provides a basis to interpret them as having\nprohibited any of the defendants from taking steps to\nprovide Hamilton with effective protection. In accord with\nthe Tenth Circuit’s decision in Turney, we hold that the\nSuperior Court’s December 13 and March 5 orders cannot\n\n                                13\n\n\nimmunize the defendants for their allegedly\nunconstitutional failure to take action to protect Hamilton.\n\n* * *\n\nWe conclude that the defendants are not entitled to\nabsolute immunity from Hamilton’s Eighth Amendment\nclaim on the basis of the Superior Court’s orders\nconcerning Hamilton’s confinement in Delaware. We\ntherefore affirm the District Court’s decision denying the\ndefendants’ motion for summary judgment on this ground.\n\nB. Quasi-judicial absolute immunity\n\nThe defendants also argue that they are entitled to\nabsolute immunity because they acted in quasi-judicial\ncapacities when, in the case of the CICC defendants, they\ndecided to take \"no action\" on the MDT’s recommendation\nthat Hamilton be placed in protective custody, and when, in\nthe case of the MDT defendants, they chose to take no\nsteps to secure Hamilton’s safety other than the\nrecommendation they made to the CICC. The District\nCourt, citing Cleavinger v. Saxoner, 474 U.S. 193 (1985),\nheld that the defendants could not receive quasi-judicial\nabsolute immunity because \"this type of immunity generally\ndoes not extend to prison officials.\"\n\nQuasi-judicial absolute immunity attaches when a public\nofficial’s role is \"functionally comparable\" to that of a judge.\nButz v. Economou, 438 U.S. 478, 513 (1978). To determine\nthis, a court must consider whether the official acted\nindependently and what procedural safeguards attended\nhis/her decision-making process. See Cleavinger , 474 U.S.\nat 202. Cleavinger concerned whether members of a prison\ndisciplinary committee could receive quasi-judicial\nimmunity. Before holding that they could not, the Supreme\nCourt analyzed the independence and safeguards\naccompanying the committee’s decision-making process. Id.\nat 202-06. In so doing, the Court did not hold per se that\nprison officials can never receive quasi-judicial immunity.\n\fThough the District   Court may be correct that prison\nofficials generally   cannot receive quasi-judicial immunity,\nCleavinger requires   that it analyze whether the particular\ndefendants here are   entitled to that immunity. The District\n\n                                  14\n\n\nCourt did not do so. Also, we do not know what facts\npertaining to the committees’ independence and safeguards\nwere sufficiently proven for summary judgment purposes.\n\nWe recently announced in Forbes v. Township of Lower\nMerion, 313 F.3d 144, 146 (3d Cir. 2002), a supervisory\nrule requiring district courts to set out what facts they\nrelied on and the legal reasoning they used to determine\nwhether to grant a summary judgment motion for qualified\nimmunity. We now extend this rule to require district\ncourts to provide the same information when deciding\nmotions for summary judgment based on absolute\nimmunity defenses. Accordingly, we remand to the District\nCourt in order for it to reconsider whether the defendants\nare entitled to quasi-judicial absolute immunity. 6\n\nC. Qualified immunity\n\nFinally, the defendants contend that they are entitled to\nqualified immunity either because Hamilton has not raised\na genuine issue of material fact whether the defendants\nviolated his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel\nand unusual punishment or because no clearly established\nlaw prohibited the defendants’ conduct at the time they\nacted. The District Court rejected this claim, and we\nremand for further consideration of the issues.\n\nIn determining whether to grant summary judgment on\nqualified immunity grounds, a court must first consider\nwhether \"[t]aken in the light most favorable to the party\nasserting the injury, do the facts alleged show the officer’s\nconduct violated a constitutional right.\" Saucier v. Katz,\n533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001). \"[I]f a violation could be made\nout on a favorable view of the parties’ submissions, the\nnext, sequential step is to ask whether the right was clearly\nestablished.\" Id.\n\nThe defendants violated Hamilton’s Eighth Amendment\nrights only if they acted with deliberate indifference to his\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. On remand, if the defendants direct the Court to any evidence\npertaining to the independence and safeguards of their decision-making\nprocesses (they did not do so here), it may be useful to compare this\nevidence with the independence and safeguards considered insufficient\nin Cleavinger to warrant quasi-judicial immunity.\n\n                                  15\n\n\nsafety; in other words, to be liable, the defendants must\n\fhave known that Hamilton \"face[d] a substantial risk of\nserious harm\" and they must have \"disregard[ed] that risk\nby failing to take reasonable measures to abate it.\" Farmer\nv. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 847 (1994). As noted above, in\nHamilton I, 117 F.3d at 745-49, we held that Hamilton had\nraised a genuine issue of material fact whether defendants\nLeavy, Faulkner, Queener, and Lewis acted with deliberate\nindifference to Hamilton’s safety in violation of the Eighth\nAmendment.\n\nThe District Court’s opinion did not discuss whether a\nconstitutional violation occurred other than to note that we\nheld in Hamilton I that a genuine issue of material fact\nexisted as to the reasonableness of the defendants’\nconduct. The Court then skipped ahead to address the\nsecond prong in the qualified immunity analysis. It seems\nto us likely that, in so doing, the Court tacitly applied the\nlaw of the case doctrine, reasoning that Hamilton I had\nconclusively resolved for summary judgment purposes the\nfirst prong of the qualified immunity analysis.\n\nThe law of the case doctrine \"limits relitigation of an\nissue once it has been decided\" in an earlier stage of the\nsame litigation. In re Continental Airlines, Inc., 279 F.3d\n226, 232 (3d Cir. 2002). We apply the doctrine with the\nintent that it will promote finality, consistency, and judicial\neconomy. In re City of Philadelphia Litig., 158 F.3d 711,\n717-18 (3d Cir. 1998). Reconsideration of a previously\ndecided issue may, however, be appropriate in certain\ncircumstances, including when the record contains new\nevidence. Id. at 718; Bridge v. United States Parole Comm’n,\n981 F.2d 97, 103 (3d Cir. 1992). This exception to the law\nof the case doctrine makes sense because when the record\ncontains new evidence, \"the question has not really been\ndecided earlier and is posed for the first time.\" Bridge, 981\nF.2d at 103. But this is so only if the new evidence differs\nmaterially from the evidence of record when the issue was\nfirst decided and if it provides less support for that\ndecision. City of Philadelphia Litig., 158 F.3d at 720.\nAccordingly, if the evidence at the two stages of litigation is\n\"substantially similar,\" or if the evidence at the latter stage\nprovides more support for the decision made earlier, the\nlaw of the case doctrine will apply. Id.\n\n                                16\n\n\nOur decision in Hamilton I that the record evidence did\nnot permit the entry of summary judgment in favor of the\ndefendants in the case at that time (Leavy, Faulkner,\nQueener, and Lewis) does constitute the law of the case as\nto that evidence and those defendants. Between Hamilton I\nand the District Court’s rejection of the qualified immunity\ndefense, however, the parties engaged in discovery and\nsupplemented the record. If the record now contains\nevidence materially deviating from the evidence in the\nrecord when we decided Hamilton I, the application of the\nlaw of the case doctrine may be inapplicable to the\ndefendants in Hamilton I. Because of the factual nature of\nthis determination, and because we cannot be certain that\n\fthe District Court applied the law of the case doctrine, we\nremand for the Court to decide in the first instance whether\nthat doctrine applies.\n\nBetween Hamilton I and the District Court’s decision,\nHamilton also amended the complaint to include additional\ndefendants. We agree with the Seventh Circuit that\"[t]he\nlaw of the case doctrine should not be read so rigidly that\nit precludes a party from raising an argument that it had\nno prior opportunity to raise.\" United States v. Dexter, 165\nF.3d 1120, 1124 (7th Cir. 1999) (quoting Bagola v. Kindt,\n131 F.3d 632, 637 (7th Cir. 1997)). The defendants added\nsince Hamilton I lacked the opportunity to argue that they\nhad not violated Hamilton’s Eighth Amendment rights. On\nremand, they will have the opportunity to do so. We\nrecognize, however, that the Hamilton I decision, though\n\"not controlling, . . . is highly persuasive authority for the\nissues it addressed.\" Id.\n\nTurning to the second prong of the qualified immunity\ndefense, the District Court held that \"Hamilton’s right to be\nprotected from known risks was clearly established in\nAugust 5, 1992.\" As we have previously explained, however,\n\"to defeat qualified immunity it is not sufficient that the\nright at issue be clearly established as a general matter.\nRather, the question is whether a reasonable public official\nwould know that his or her specific conduct violated clearly\nestablished rights.\" Grant v. City of Pittsburgh, 98 F.3d 116,\n121 (3d Cir. 1996) (citing Anderson v. Creighton , 483 U.S.\n635, 636-37 (1987)) (emphasis in original); Saucier, 533\n\n                                17\n\n\nU.S. at 202. Because we do not know what \"specific\nconduct\" the District Court on remand will consider\nsufficiently established for summary judgment purposes,\nwe remand without addressing the question whether\nHamilton can withstand the defendants’ summary\njudgment motion to the extent it argues that they did not\nviolate any clearly established law.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe District Court correctly concluded that the\ndefendants have not established that they are entitled to\nabsolute immunity on the ground that the Superior Court’s\norders prohibited them from providing Hamilton with\neffective safety measures. We remand, however, for the\nCourt to reconsider whether they are entitled to quasi-\njudicial absolute immunity. Finally, the District Court on\nremand should address also the applicability of the law of\nthe case doctrine and whether the defendants should\nreceive qualified immunity.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\f18\n\f",

S 1983 case is before us on interlocutory\nappeal. The defendants, members of the Gander Hill Prison\n\fMulti-Disciplinary Team (\"MDT\") and the Delaware\nDepartment of Corrections Central Institutional\nClassification Committee (\"CICC\"), challenge the District\nCourt’s denial of their summary judgment motion for\nabsolute or qualified immunity from Delaware prisoner\nJerome Hamilton’s lawsuit alleging violations of the Eighth\nAmendment. The defendants contend that they are entitled\nto absolute immunity because they acted pursuant to a\ncourt order or otherwise in a quasi-judicial capacity.\nAlternatively, they argue that they should receive qualified\nimmunity because they did not violate Hamilton’s Eighth\nAmendment rights or because their actions were objectively\nreasonable. We agree with the District Court that on this\nrecord the defendants are not absolutely immune on the\nground that they acted pursuant to a court order. We\nremand, however, for the District Court to analyze under\nthe legal tests noted below whether the defendants are\nentitled either to absolute immunity for acting in a quasi-\njudicial capacity or to qualified immunity.\n\n                                2\n\n\nFACTS1\n\nOn August 5, 1992, Hamilton’s cellmate in Delaware’s\nGander Hill prison attacked and injured him.2 Hamilton\nalleges that his cellmate was able to commit this assault\nbecause the defendant prison officials acted with deliberate\nindifference to his safety.\n\nHamilton has been the victim of numerous attacks from\nother inmates throughout his lengthy stint in the Delaware\nprison system, some of which we described in a prior\nappeal in this case. See Hamilton v. Leavy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"743078\"><a href=\"/opinion/743078/jerome-k-hamilton-v-faith-leavy-pamela-faulkner-william-queener-frances/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">742</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n744-45 (3d Cir. 1997) (Hamilton I). For Hamilton’s safety,\nprison officials have transferred him among various prisons\nboth in and outside Delaware and have placed him in\nprotective custody.\n\nIn 1986 Hamilton cooperated with a drug trafficking\ninvestigation at the Gander Hill prison that ended with the\narrest of prison officials and inmates. He became known as\na \"snitch\" and, as a result, prison officials repeatedly had to\nplace him in protective custody. In 1990 prison officials\ntransferred Hamilton to a Virginia prison \"[b]ecause there\nappeared to be no safe place for Hamilton in the Delaware\nprisons.\" Id. at 745.\n\nAfter the move to Virginia, however, Hamilton initiated\ntwo civil lawsuits in Delaware state courts, and he was\nreturned in December 1991 to the Gander Hill prison to\nenable him to prosecute those actions effectively. He\nbrought one of the lawsuits against state officials. Deputy\nAttorney General John Polk defended that case. Judge\nClarence Taylor of the Delaware Superior Court, who\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. The District Court ruled on the defendants’ motion for summary\njudgment and so viewed the facts in the light most favorable to\n\fHamilton, the non-moving party. As we explain below, we do not have\njurisdiction to review the District Court’s fact-finding in this case. We\ntherefore rely upon its opinion to lay out the facts upon which we rule,\nas well as our prior opinion in Hamilton v. Leavy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"743078\"><a href=\"/opinion/743078/jerome-k-hamilton-v-faith-leavy-pamela-faulkner-william-queener-frances/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">742</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir.\n1997), to which the District Court referred readers for further factual\nbackground.\n\n2. We follow the practice of the parties and the District Court by referring\nto the prison by its colloquial name, Gander Hill; its official title is the\nMulti-Purpose Criminal Justice Facility.\n\n                                3\n\n\npresided over the case, held a hearing on December 13,\n1991, and addressed the question where Hamilton could be\nhoused while discovery took place.\n\nDeputy A.G. Polk suggested to the Court that Hamilton\nbe kept in Delaware for a \"month or so.\" When Judge\nTaylor expressed concern that the Delaware prison system\nbe able to take the \"special precautions\" necessary for\nHamilton, Polk volunteered to check with the appropriate\nofficials whether this was possible, and the Court granted\na recess for him to do so. After the recess, Polk informed\nthe Court that an official from the Delaware Department of\nCorrections Compact had \"reiterated to [him] that Mr.\nHamilton is in need of protective custody,\" but that the\nDepartment could \"accommodate\" Hamilton for two months\nat either Gander Hill or the Sussex Correctional Institution.\nPolk then stated that he had requested that the\nDepartment keep Hamilton at Gander Hill.3\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. The exchange went as follows:\n\n       The Court: . . . [O]n your suggestion that   he be kept here in\n       Delaware for the next month or so, I think   that ought to be cleared\n       with the prison people because it involves   special precautions . . . ,\n       whether they are in a position to maintain   those-- that precaution\n       during the period you’re talking about.\n\n       Deputy A.G.: I would undertake that task of clearing it with the\n       Department, Your Honor.\n\n        . . .\n\n       The Court: . . . [I]f it doesn’t pose a problem to the prison\n       administration for him to be detained up here for a month or longer\n       in order for him to have access to the lawbooks and get out his\n       discovery and so on while he’s up here, then that would seem like\n       the best solution to move this case forward from where it is today.\n       . . .\n\n       [Recess held to allow the Deputy A.G. to check with prison officials\n       regarding housing Hamilton in Delaware.]\n\n       Deputy A.G.: Your Honor, I’ve called the deputy administrator for the\n       Delaware Department of Corrections Compact and they’ve indicated\n       that a one to two-month stay by Mr. Hamilton in Delaware is\n\f       something they can accommodate.\n\n                                4\n\n\nThe Court next informed Hamilton:\n\n       Let’s leave it that way, then. So, you’ll -- you are to be\n       detained up here at the State Gander Hill Prison for a\n       length of time up to two months, and it will be\n       dependent [on] what reports I get back from the Deputy\n       Attorney General, from you and what progress is made\n       toward resolving this thing without further trial. .. .\n       Prison will have you up to two months and during that\n       time Mr. Polk will cooperate with you and try to work\n       out something . . . .\n\nThe docket entry for December 13 states: \"Detained at\nGander Hill up to 2 months in protective custody.\"\n\nHamilton was still at the Gander Hill prison on March 5,\n1992, almost three months later, when Judge Taylor sent a\nletter to the Deputy A.G.:\n\n        At a hearing held on December 13, 1991, you were\n       ordered to supply petitioner Jerome Hamilton with\n       answers to petitioner’s requests for admissions by\n       December 27, 1991 . . . .\n\n        [T]he Interstate Corrections Compact Administrator\n       has contacted my office to see if the petitioner can be\n       returned to the prison from which he had been\n       transferred for the purpose of resolving this case.\n\n        You have failed to comply with my order of December\n       13, 1991. If Gander Hill Prison needs action, then you\n       should take immediate action to comply with the order\n       of December 13, 1991. Until you comply with the\n       Order, there is no alternative but to keep petitioner\n       Hamilton at the Gander Hill facility.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n       The Court: They can?\n\n       Deputy A.G.: They can accommodate. She reiterated to me that Mr.\n       Hamilton is in need of protective custody, and I said can you\n       accommodate him in Delaware. She said he can be accommodated\n       in Gander Hill or SCI [Sussex Correctional Institution]. My request\n       of the Department -- and I don’t think that there would be a\n       problem in adhering to this -- is that he be housed up here in\n       Gander Hill.\n\n                                5\n\n\n        IT IS SO ORDERED.\n\nLater that month, Hamilton, still in the Gander Hill\nprison, filed a grievance against a correctional officer there\nfor calling him in front of other prisoners \"a good telling\n\fmother f_____g snitcher.\" Witnesses confirmed this incident.\nThe Resident Grievance Resolution Committee, composed of\nfive prison officials, recommended to the Deputy Warden\nthat \"a thorough investigation\" take place because\ncomments that a prisoner is a \"snitch\" have the potential to\ncause \"a major disturbance and require[ ] immediate\naction.\" The Deputy Warden concluded on June 15, 1992,\nthat the correctional officer did make the statement.\n\nThree days later, the MDT -- made up of defendants\nFaith Leavy, Pamela Faulkner (now Minor), and William\nQueener -- reviewed Hamilton’s file, summarized his\nsituation in a written report, and unanimously\nrecommended that he be placed in protective custody. After\nreviewing the MDT report and recommendation, the CICC,\nwhich had the authority to place Hamilton in protective\ncustody, decided on June 24, 1992, to take \"no action\" on\nthe report, which meant that Hamilton remained without\nadditional safety precautions in the Gander Hill general\nprison population. The members of the CICC are also\ndefendants in this lawsuit.\n\nA month after the \"no action\" decision, inmate Steven\nClayton joined the prison population at Gander Hill and\nsometime before August 5, 1992, became Hamilton’s\ncellmate. That day, Clayton attacked Hamilton, fracturing\nhis jaw and sending him to the hospital, where he had two\nmetal plates inserted. Clayton pled guilty to the assault and\nstated that he attacked Hamilton because he was\"a\nsnitcher on inmates and officers\" at Gander Hill.\n\nCoincidentally, on the same day as the assault (August\n5), Judge Haile Alford, who had taken over Hamilton’s civil\ncase in the Delaware Superior Court when Judge Taylor\nretired, wrote a letter to Hamilton, informing him:\n\n       Judge Taylor ordered you held at Gander Hill until the\n       Deputy Attorney General had attempted to resolve this\n       matter with you without further trial. A review of the\n       file in this case reveals that Deputy Attorney General\n\n                                6\n\n\n       John Polk, after writing to the Court anticipating a\n       settlement of this claim[,] has requested a trial date\n       and that a Scheduling Order in this matter has been\n       entered, setting a trial date of March 31, 1993.\n\n       The letter from the Court dated March 5, 1992, does\n       not order that you are to be held at Gander Hill until\n       the completion of your case. Because this case is now\n       set down for trial, the conditions that caused you to be\n       incarcerated at Gander Hill have changed, and there is\n       no longer a reason in [this case] for you to remain at\n       that specific facility.\n\nPROCEEDINGS\n\nHamilton filed this S 1983 lawsuit on June 20, 1994, in\n\fthe District Court for the District of Delaware against MDT\nmembers Leavy, Faulkner, and Queener, and against\nFrances Lewis, chair of the CICC, alleging deliberate\nindifference to Hamilton’s safety in violation of his Eighth\nAmendment right to be free of cruel and unusual\npunishment. The Court entered summary judgment in favor\nof the MDT defendants because they \"were without\nauthority to effectuate their own recommendation that\nHamilton be placed in protective custody, [and therefore]\nthey could not be found to have deliberately disregarded\nserious risks to his safety.\" Hamilton I, 117 F.3d at 748.\nThe Court also granted summary judgment to defendant\nLewis on the ground that no reasonable factfinder could\nfind that she knew that keeping Hamilton in the Gander\nHill general prison population without additional safety\nprecautions put Hamilton in substantial risk of suffering\nserious harm.\n\nHamilton appealed, and in June 1997 our Court\nreversed. See id. at 744. As to the MDT defendants, we\nnoted Hamilton’s argument that the MDT could have\nprovided him with additional protection by, for instance,\nputting him in administrative segregation, even if the MDT\ndid not have the authority to place him in protective\ncustody. See id. at 748. We concluded that the \"failure of\nthe MDT defendants to take additional steps beyond the\nrecommendation of protective custody could be viewed by a\n\n                                7\n\n\nfactfinder as the sort of deliberate indifference to inmate\nsafety that the Constitution forbids.\" Id. at 749. As to\ndefendant Lewis, we explained that she \"was made aware of\na substantial risk to Hamilton’s safety when she reviewed\nthe MDT’s unanimous recommendation to place Hamilton\nin protective custody\" and, accordingly, that\"a factfinder\ncould infer that Lewis knew that the threat to Hamilton’s\nsafety was imminent.\" Id. at 747.\n\nBack in the District Court, Hamilton amended his\ncomplaint to add additional defendants: George Dixon, Jack\nStephenson, Deborah Craig, Joanne Smith, Dennis Loebe,\nEldora Tillery, Francis Cockroft, Jerry Borga, and Richard\nShockley, all members of CICC when the assault occurred.\nOn July 27, 2001, the District Court denied the defendants’\nsecond motion for summary judgment.

Absolute immunity for actions taken pursuant to a\n       court order\n\nThe defendants assert that they should receive absolute\nimmunity from Hamilton’s claim that they violated the\nEighth Amendment because the conduct (or lack thereof)\nfor which they are sued was taken pursuant to a court\norder. As the defendants see it, the Superior Court’s orders\n-- Judge Taylor’s December 13 oral decision and docket\norder and his March 5 letter to the Deputy A.G.--\nprohibited the defendants from moving Hamilton from the\nGander Hill prison. The defendants argue that the Delaware\nprison system did not at that time provide for protective\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. The facts sufficiently proven for summary judgment purposes include\nthose facts not subject to genuine dispute as well as those facts that are\nsubject to such dispute, viewed in the light most favorable to Hamilton,\nthe non-moving party.

City of Pittsburgh,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"752956\"><a href=\"/opinion/752956/june-m-wolfe-joseph-j-campisi-paul-r-renk-steven-r-gardner-george-t/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">236</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 240 (3d Cir. 1998); Richman v.

The Court\nconcluded instead that the Superior Court’s orders did not\nprohibit the defendants from moving Hamilton from the\nGander Hill prison to another facility in order to place him\nin protective custody and that, even if the orders had\nprohibited such action, they did not also prevent the\ndefendants from otherwise providing Hamilton with effective\nprotection at Gander Hill.\n\nHamilton contends, however, that the question whether\nthe defendants acted pursuant to an order of the Superior\nCourt is one of fact and therefore an issue we cannot\naddress. In the end, whether a defendant is entitled to\nabsolute immunity is a question of law, see Carver v.\nFoerster, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"730993\"><a href=\"/opinion/730993/phyllis-carver-thomas-fox-april-moore-roberta-rudolph-v-tom-foerster-an/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 99 (3d Cir. 1996) (\"Absolute\nimmunity is an issue of law . . . .\"); In re Montgomery\nCounty, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769046\"><a href=\"/opinion/769046/in-re-montgomery-county-montgomery-county-commissioners-mario-mele-richard/\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 372 (3d Cir. 2000) (\"Absolute\nimmunity is a purely legal question . . . .\"), but we agree\nwith Hamilton that this ultimately legal issue can also\ninvolve factual questions.\n\nIndeed, in Lockhart v.

Id. at 460. The disputed question there\nconcerned whether a court had issued an order to the\ndefendant -- the court’s prothonotary -- not to accept the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. This type of immunity is sometimes referred to as \"quasi-judicial\"\nimmunity. We reserve this moniker, however, for another form of\nimmunity asserted by the defendants (for acting in a role that is\nfunctionally comparable to that of a judge, rather than under the\nauthority of a court order), discussed in Section B below.\n\n                                10\n\n\nplaintiff ’s papers for filing. Id. at 457-58. Here, in contrast,\nthe key issue is not factually whether the Superior Court\nentered an order at all, but is instead what the Superior\nCourt’s orders mean. This is a question of law, see Apex\nFountain Sales, Inc. v. Kleinfeld, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488530\"><a href=\"/opinion/488530/apex-fountain-sales-inc-v-kleinfeld-ernie-flo-aire-inc-kearney/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1089</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1097 (3d\n\fCir. 1987) (The \"construction of . . . [a] court order\" is \"a\npurely legal issue.\"), which we can review. We turn now to\nthat question.\n\nThe defendants repeat to this Court their contention,\nrejected by the District Court, that the Superior Court’s\norders forbade them from moving Hamilton from the\nGander Hill prison to another facility where he could be\nplaced in protective custody. We agree with the District\nCourt’s conclusion.\n\nThe Superior Court’s order of December 13, 1991, did not\nby itself prohibit moving Hamilton. To recap, on December\n13 Judge Taylor agreed to the Deputy A.G.’s request that\nHamilton be detained in a Delaware prison only after\nreceiving assurances that the Delaware Department of\nCorrections could take the \"special precautions\" necessary\nfor Hamilton’s safety. It was at the Deputy A.G.’s request\nthat the Superior Court ordered that Hamilton be kept at\nGander Hill rather than at the Sussex Correctional\nInstitution. And the December 13 docket entry states that\nHamilton is to be housed at Gander Hill \"up to 2 months in\nprotective custody.\"\n\nThe December 13, 1991 colloquy with Judge Taylor\n(which in his March 5, 1992 letter he referred to as an\norder) did not require Hamilton’s detention for more than a\nperiod of two months at Gander Hill, instead of at Sussex\nor another prison. But especially it cannot be interpreted to\nhave required his detention at Gander Hill if the prison\nofficials there became unable (or unwilling) to keep\nHamilton in \"protective custody\" or to provide some other\nform of \"special precautions\" for his safety. Accordingly, the\norder did not prohibit the MDT or the CICC in the summer\nof 1992 (the key time period) from placing Hamilton in a\nfacility that could provide him with protective custody.\n\nWe reach the same conclusion as to the March 5 letter.\nAgain, that letter, addressed to Deputy A.G. Polk,\n\n                                11\n\n\nconcluded: \"Until you comply with the Order, there is no\nalternative but to keep petitioner Hamilton at the Gander\nHill facility.\" This statement did not require that the\ndefendants keep Hamilton at Gander Hill indefinitely, as\nthey seem to argue. Instead, it explicitly states that it will\noperate only until the time that the Deputy A.G. complied\nwith \"the Order.\" Read in context, the \"Order\" with which\nthe Deputy A.G. must comply refers to the Superior Court’s\nDecember 13 order that the Deputy A.G. participate in\ndiscovery, communicate with Hamilton, and inform the\nCourt of the results of this process.\n\nJudge Alford’s letter of August 5 is in accord with our\nunderstanding of the March 5 letter. She explained that\n\"Judge Taylor ordered [Hamilton] held at Gander Hill until\nthe Deputy Attorney General had attempted to resolve this\nmatter with [Hamilton] without further trial.\" And further:\n\f\"The letter from the Court dated March 5, 1992, does not\norder that [Hamilton was] to be held at Gander Hill until\nthe completion of [the civil] case.\" Finally, Judge Alford’s\nletter also tells us that by August 5 the Deputy A.G. had\nreported to the Superior Court on the progress of the civil\nsuit litigation and that trial had been set, putting an end to\nthe March 5 requirement that Hamilton stay at Gander Hill.\n\nAccordingly, neither of the Superior Court orders explains\nadequately the defendants’ failure to remove Hamilton from\nGander Hill. They are therefore not entitled to absolute\nimmunity on this ground.\n\nThe District Court also held that the Superior Court’s\norders \"would not have prevented the defendants from\nproviding Hamilton with effective protection at Gander Hill\"\nand thus, on this ground as well, the orders did not provide\nabsolute immunity to the defendants. We again agree with\nthe District Court.\n\nThe Tenth Circuit has addressed an analogous issue. In\nTurney v. O’Toole, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538580\"><a href=\"/opinion/538580/rocky-james-turney-v-james-otoole-individually-as-superintendent-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1470</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th Cir. 1990), also a\nS 1983 case, a state court ordered the seventeen-year-old\nplaintiff confined at a state hospital for mental health\ntreatment. Id. at 1471. At the hospital, the plaintiff was\nplaced in the adult maximum security unit. Id. at 1472.\n\"When efforts to find a more suitable placement failed,\" the\n\n                                12\n\n\nplaintiff obtained a writ of habeas corpus ordering his\nrelease. Id. The plaintiff then sued the superintendent and\na psychologist at the hospital, alleging violations of S 1983.\nThe District Court granted absolute immunity to the\ndefendants on the ground that they were acting pursuant\nto the court order. Id.\n\nThe Tenth Circuit reversed in part, holding that the\ndefendants \"were absolutely immune from liability arising\nfrom the fact of [the plaintiff ’s] confinement, but that they\nwere only qualifiedly immune from liability arising from the\nconditions in which he was held.\" Id. The Court explained:\n\n       [T]his absolute immunity [for the plaintiff ’s\n       confinement] extended only to acts prescribed by[the\n       court’s] order, . . . and . . . all the order decreed was\n       [the plaintiff ’s] confinement at [the hospital]. It did not\n       dictate any specific placement or treatment within the\n       facility. Therefore, the defendants are not absolutely\n       immune from liability arising from [the plaintiff ’s]\n       placement in the maximum security ward.\n\nId. at 1474 (citations omitted); see also Nixon v. Fitzgerald,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110762\"><a href=\"/opinion/110762/nixon-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 755 (1982) (\"In defining the scope of an\nofficial’s absolute privilege, this Court has recognized that\nthe sphere of protected action must be related closely to the\nimmunity’s justifying purposes.\").\n\nThe Superior Court’s orders entered in this case did not\n\fdirect the defendants -- expressly or otherwise-- to confine\nHamilton in conditions that they knew posed a substantial\nrisk of serious harm. The Superior Court’s concern that a\nDelaware facility take \"special precautions\" to ensure\nHamilton’s safety and the December 13 docket entry noting\nthat Hamilton was to be kept in \"protective custody\" made\nclear that he must remain safe.\n\nEven if the Superior Court had not stated such explicit\nconcern for Hamilton’s safety (indeed ordered that he be\nplaced in protective custody), nothing else in the Court’s\norders provides a basis to interpret them as having\nprohibited any of the defendants from taking steps to\nprovide Hamilton with effective protection. In accord with\nthe Tenth Circuit’s decision in Turney, we hold that the\nSuperior Court’s December 13 and March 5 orders cannot\n\n                                13\n\n\nimmunize the defendants for their allegedly\nunconstitutional failure to take action to protect Hamilton.\n\n* * *\n\nWe conclude that the defendants are not entitled to\nabsolute immunity from Hamilton’s Eighth Amendment\nclaim on the basis of the Superior Court’s orders\nconcerning Hamilton’s confinement in Delaware. We\ntherefore affirm the District Court’s decision denying the\ndefendants’ motion for summary judgment on this ground.\n\nB. Quasi-judicial absolute immunity\n\nThe defendants also argue that they are entitled to\nabsolute immunity because they acted in quasi-judicial\ncapacities when, in the case of the CICC defendants, they\ndecided to take \"no action\" on the MDT’s recommendation\nthat Hamilton be placed in protective custody, and when, in\nthe case of the MDT defendants, they chose to take no\nsteps to secure Hamilton’s safety other than the\nrecommendation they made to the CICC. The District\nCourt, citing Cleavinger v. Saxoner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111547\"><a href=\"/opinion/111547/cleavinger-v-saxner/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1985),\nheld that the defendants could not receive quasi-judicial\nabsolute immunity because \"this type of immunity generally\ndoes not extend to prison officials.\"\n\nQuasi-judicial absolute immunity attaches when a public\nofficial’s role is \"functionally comparable\" to that of a judge.\nButz v. Economou, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109932\"><a href=\"/opinion/109932/butz-v-economou/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 513 (1978). To determine\nthis, a court must consider whether the official acted\nindependently and what procedural safeguards attended\nhis/her decision-making process. See Cleavinger , 474 U.S.\nat 202. Cleavinger concerned whether members of a prison\ndisciplinary committee could receive quasi-judicial\nimmunity. Before holding that they could not, the Supreme\nCourt analyzed the independence and safeguards\naccompanying the committee’s decision-making process. Id.\nat 202-06. In so doing, the Court did not hold per se that\nprison officials can never receive quasi-judicial immunity.\n\fThough the District   Court may be correct that prison\nofficials generally   cannot receive quasi-judicial immunity,\nCleavinger requires   that it analyze whether the particular\ndefendants here are   entitled to that immunity. The District\n\n                                  14\n\n\nCourt did not do so. Also, we do not know what facts\npertaining to the committees’ independence and safeguards\nwere sufficiently proven for summary judgment purposes.\n\nWe recently announced in Forbes v. Township of Lower\nMerion, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780125\"><a href=\"/opinion/780125/lorenzo-a-forbes-ella-m-forbes-in-their-own-right-and-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 146 (3d Cir. 2002), a supervisory\nrule requiring district courts to set out what facts they\nrelied on and the legal reasoning they used to determine\nwhether to grant a summary judgment motion for qualified\nimmunity. We now extend this rule to require district\ncourts to provide the same information when deciding\nmotions for summary judgment based on absolute\nimmunity defenses. Accordingly, we remand to the District\nCourt in order for it to reconsider whether the defendants\nare entitled to quasi-judicial absolute immunity. 6\n\nC. Qualified immunity\n\nFinally, the defendants contend that they are entitled to\nqualified immunity either because Hamilton has not raised\na genuine issue of material fact whether the defendants\nviolated his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel\nand unusual punishment or because no clearly established\nlaw prohibited the defendants’ conduct at the time they\nacted. The District Court rejected this claim, and we\nremand for further consideration of the issues.\n\nIn determining whether to grant summary judgment on\nqualified immunity grounds, a court must first consider\nwhether \"[t]aken in the light most favorable to the party\nasserting the injury, do the facts alleged show the officer’s\nconduct violated a constitutional right.\" Saucier v.

Brennan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 847 (1994). As noted above, in\nHamilton I, 117 F.3d at 745-49, we held that Hamilton had\nraised a genuine issue of material fact whether defendants\nLeavy, Faulkner, Queener, and Lewis acted with deliberate\nindifference to Hamilton’s safety in violation of the Eighth\nAmendment.\n\nThe District Court’s opinion did not discuss whether a\nconstitutional violation occurred other than to note that we\nheld in Hamilton I that a genuine issue of material fact\nexisted as to the reasonableness of the defendants’\nconduct. The Court then skipped ahead to address the\nsecond prong in the qualified immunity analysis. It seems\nto us likely that, in so doing, the Court tacitly applied the\nlaw of the case doctrine, reasoning that Hamilton I had\nconclusively resolved for summary judgment purposes the\nfirst prong of the qualified immunity analysis.\n\nThe law of the case doctrine \"limits relitigation of an\nissue once it has been decided\" in an earlier stage of the\nsame litigation. In re Continental Airlines, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776403\"><a href=\"/opinion/776403/in-re-continental-airlines-inc-debtor-eastern-pilots-merger-committee/\"><span class=\"volume\">279</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">226</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 232 (3d Cir. 2002). We apply the doctrine with the\nintent that it will promote finality, consistency, and judicial\neconomy. In re City of Philadelphia Litig., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758670\"><a href=\"/opinion/758670/in-re-city-of-philadelphia-litigation-dc-civil-no-85-cv-02745-ramona/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">711</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n717-18 (3d Cir. 1998). Reconsideration of a previously\ndecided issue may, however, be appropriate in certain\ncircumstances, including when the record contains new\nevidence. Id. at 718; Bridge v. United States Parole Comm’n,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596407\"><a href=\"/opinion/596407/william-w-bridge-v-united-states-parole-commission-and-jt-holland/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 103 (3d Cir. 1992). This exception to the law\nof the case doctrine makes sense because when the record\ncontains new evidence, \"the question has not really been\ndecided earlier and is posed for the first time.\" Bridge, 981\nF.2d at 103. But this is so only if the new evidence differs\nmaterially from the evidence of record when the issue was\nfirst decided and if it provides less support for that\ndecision. City of Philadelphia Litig., 158 F.3d at 720.\nAccordingly, if the evidence at the two stages of litigation is\n\"substantially similar,\" or if the evidence at the latter stage\nprovides more support for the decision made earlier, the\nlaw of the case doctrine will apply. Id.\n\n                                16\n\n\nOur decision in Hamilton I that the record evidence did\nnot permit the entry of summary judgment in favor of the\ndefendants in the case at that time (Leavy, Faulkner,\nQueener, and Lewis) does constitute the law of the case as\nto that evidence and those defendants. Between Hamilton I\nand the District Court’s rejection of the qualified immunity\ndefense, however, the parties engaged in discovery and\nsupplemented the record. If the record now contains\nevidence materially deviating from the evidence in the\nrecord when we decided Hamilton I, the application of the\nlaw of the case doctrine may be inapplicable to the\ndefendants in Hamilton I. Because of the factual nature of\nthis determination, and because we cannot be certain that\n\fthe District Court applied the law of the case doctrine, we\nremand for the Court to decide in the first instance whether\nthat doctrine applies.\n\nBetween Hamilton I and the District Court’s decision,\nHamilton also amended the complaint to include additional\ndefendants. We agree with the Seventh Circuit that\"[t]he\nlaw of the case doctrine should not be read so rigidly that\nit precludes a party from raising an argument that it had\nno prior opportunity to raise.\" United States v. Dexter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"760896\"><a href=\"/opinion/760896/united-states-v-terence-d-dexter/\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1120</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1124 (7th Cir. 1999) (quoting Bagola v. Kindt,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749335\"><a href=\"/opinion/749335/loren-bagola-v-thomas-kindt/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">632</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 637 (7th Cir. 1997)). The defendants added\nsince Hamilton I lacked the opportunity to argue that they\nhad not violated Hamilton’s Eighth Amendment rights. On\nremand, they will have the opportunity to do so. We\nrecognize, however, that the Hamilton I decision, though\n\"not controlling, . . . is highly persuasive authority for the\nissues it addressed.\" Id.\n\nTurning to the second prong of the qualified immunity\ndefense, the District Court held that \"Hamilton’s right to be\nprotected from known risks was clearly established in\nAugust 5, 1992.\" As we have previously explained, however,\n\"to defeat qualified immunity it is not sufficient that the\nright at issue be clearly established as a general matter.\nRather, the question is whether a reasonable public official\nwould know that his or her specific conduct violated clearly\nestablished rights.\" Grant v.

Because we do not know what \"specific\nconduct\" the District Court on remand will consider\nsufficiently established for summary judgment purposes,\nwe remand without addressing the question whether\nHamilton can withstand the defendants’ summary\njudgment motion to the extent it argues that they did not\nviolate any clearly established law.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe District Court correctly concluded that the\ndefendants have not established that they are entitled to\nabsolute immunity on the ground that the Superior Court’s\norders prohibited them from providing Hamilton with\neffective safety measures. We remand, however, for the\nCourt to reconsider whether they are entitled to quasi-\njudicial absolute immunity. Finally, the District Court on\nremand should address also the applicability of the law of\nthe case doctrine and whether the defendants should\nreceive qualified immunity.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\f18\n\f</pre>",
