Jett v. Dallas Independent School District, 491\n\nU.S. 701, 109 S.Ct. 2702, 105 L.Ed.2d 598 (1989).\n\n     The facts and procedural posture of the case are reflected in\n\nthe Supreme Court's opinion and in our earlier opinions herein.\n\nJett v. Dallas Independent School District, 798 F.2d 748, rehearing\n\ndenied, 837 F.2d 1244 (5th Cir.1988).          For present purposes, it\n\nsuffices   to   note   that   plaintiff-appellee   Norman   Jett   (Jett),\n\nformerly a teacher, coach, and athletic director at South Oak Cliff\n\nHigh School (South Oak Cliff) in the Dallas Independent School\n\nDistrict (DISD), brought this suit under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1983\n\nagainst the DISD and the South Oak Cliff principal, Dr. Frederick\n\nTodd (Principal Todd), complaining that his transfer from South Oak\n\nCliff to a teaching position without any coaching duties at another\n\n     *\n      This decision is rendered by a quorum pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n§ 46(d).\n\fDISD school violated his constitutional rights to equal protection\n\nof the laws and freedom of speech.           The transfer was made on the\n\nrecommendation of Principal Todd and was ordered and approved by\n\nthe DISD superintendent, Dr. Linus Wright (Superintendent Wright),\n\nwho was not made a defendant.          Principal Todd did not purport to\n\norder the transfer and he had no authority to do so.                   No action\n\nrespecting the transfer was taken by the DISD board of trustees,\n\nnor was that matter ever brought, or sought to be brought, before\n\nthe board of trustees.      Jett, who is white, claimed that Principal\n\nTodd, who is black, was improperly motivated in making his transfer\n\nrecommendation by racial considerations and by Jett's exercise of\n\nhis   First   Amendment     rights,    and   that    he,   Jett,       had   told\n\nSuperintendent    Wright,     before    Wright      approved     the    transfer\n\nrecommendation, that Principal Todd's real reason for recommending\n\nthe transfer was that he wanted to replace Jett with a black\n\ncoach.1\n\n      The case was tried to a jury, which awarded Jett damages\n\nagainst the DISD and Principal Todd individually, finding that\n\nPrincipal     Todd's    transfer   recommendation       was      substantially\n\nmotivated by both Jett's race and his exercise of First Amendment\n\nrights and that the DISD's transfer of Jett \"was based solely on\n\nDefendant     Todd's     recommendation       without      any     independent\n\ninvestigation.\"        Following remittitur of some of the damages,\n\n\n      1\n     As noted in our prior opinion, Todd testified race played no\npart in his recommendation, and Wright testified that neither\nJett's race nor his having made statements to the media played any\npart in his decision and that he was unaware that Todd had based\nhis recommendation on remarks Jett made to the media. Jett, 798\nF.2d at 761.\n\fjudgment on the verdict was entered for Jett and against the DISD\n\nand Principal Todd.\n\n        On the appeal to this Court by the DISD and Principal Todd, we\n\naffirmed the district court insofar as it held Principal Todd\n\nliable for making his transfer recommendation on the basis of\n\nJett's race and First Amendment protected speech.2                 We reversed and\n\nremanded Jett's section 1983 equal protection and First Amendment\n\nclaims      against   the    DISD    because     the    district    court's   jury\n\ninstructions failed to state that the DISD \"could be bound by the\n\nprincipal or superintendent only if he was delegated policy making\n\nauthority (or if he participated in a well settled custom that\n\nfairly represented official policy and actual or constructive\n\nknowledge of the custom was attributable to the governing body or\n\nan official delegated policy making authority).\" Jett, 798 F.2d at\n\n759.3       We   further    held    that   the   same    standards    applied   to\n\n        2\n      Jett also alleged in the district court, and the jury found,\nthat he had a property interest in his position at South Oak Cliff\nwhich the DISD deprived him of without due process of law, and that\nthe DISD constructively discharged him from its employment. We\nreversed and rendered judgment against Jett on these claims,\nholding that as a matter of law Jett was not constructively\ndischarged and that his transfer from South Oak Cliff did not\ndeprive him of a property interest as his full agreed compensation\nwas continued.    These matters are no longer at issue.     Nor is\nPrincipal Todd's personal liability any longer at issue, as he and\nJett settled while the case was pending rehearing in this Court.\nSee Jett, 491 U.S. at 707-709, 109 S.Ct. at 2708.\n    3\n     We further held that the charge was deficient even if it were\nassumed that Superintendent Wright, having the final authority in\ndeciding whether a given transfer of a particular teacher-coach\nwould be made, also had the requisite policymaking authority in\nrespect to such transfers, because nothing in the charge required\nthe jury to find \"that Wright's decision was in fact improperly\nmotivated or that Wright knew or believed that (or was consciously\nindifferent to whether) Todd's recommendation was so motivated.\"\nId. at 760. We noted in this connection that \"Todd clearly was not\na policymaker.\" Id. at 761.\n\fgovernmental liability under section 1981, and accordingly reversed\n\nand remanded Jett's section 1981 claim against the DISD.    Id. at\n\n761-763.\n\n     The Supreme Court granted Jett's petition for certiorari on\n\nthe section 1981 issue and also granted the DISD's cross-petition.\n\n488 U.S. 940, 109 S.Ct. 363, 102 L.Ed.2d 353 (1988).     As to the\n\nformer, the Court held that:\n\n     \"... the express \"action at law' provided by § 1983 for the\n     \"deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured\n     by the Constitution and laws,' provides the exclusive federal\n     damages remedy for the violation of the rights guaranteed by\n     § 1981 when the claim is pressed against a state actor. Thus\n     to prevail on his claim for damages against the school\n     district, petitioner must show that the violation of his\n     \"right to make contracts' protected by § 1981 was caused by a\n     custom or policy within the meaning of Monell [v. New York\n     City Dept. of Social Services, [436 U.S. 658] 98 S.Ct. 2018\n     [56 L.Ed.2d 611] (1978) ] and subsequent cases.\" Jett, 491\n     U.S. at 735, 109 S.Ct. at 2722.4\n\nThe Court accordingly affirmed our judgment \"to the extent that it\n\nholds that the school district may not be held liable for its\n\nemployees' violation of the rights enumerated in § 1981 under a\n\ntheory of respondeat superior.\"   Id. 491 U.S. at 738, 109 S.Ct. at\n\n2724.\n\n     With respect to the DISD's sections 1981 and 1983 liability\n\nunder the standards of Monell and subsequent cases, the Supreme\n\nCourt determined, as we had, that the jury charge in this respect\n\n\"was manifest error\" because it assumed that either Principal Todd\n\nor Superintendent Wright was a DISD policymaker or that respondeat\n\n\n        4\n      The Court had earlier \"assume[d] ... without deciding, that\npetitioner's rights under § 1981 have been violated by his removal\nand reassignment\" since the DISD had never argued \"that § 1981 does\nnot reach petitioner's employment injuries.\" Id. 491 U.S. at 711,\n109 S.Ct. at 2710.\n\fsuperior was applicable.       Id. 491 U.S. at 737, 109 S.Ct. at 2723.\n\nThe Court then reviewed the standards for \"determining where\n\npolicymaking authority lies for purposes of section 1983\" as\n\nenunciated in the plurality opinion in St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485\n\nU.S. 112, 108 S.Ct. 915, 99 L.Ed.2d 107 (1988).         Jett 491 U.S. at\n\n737, 109 S.Ct. at 2723.        It stated that \" \"whether a particular\n\nofficial has \"final policymaking authority\" is a question of state\n\nlaw,' \" id. (quoting Praprotnik, 485 U.S. at 122-24, 108 S.Ct. at\n\n924, quoting Pembaur v. Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469 at 483-84, 106\n\nS.Ct.   1292   at    1300   (1986)   (plurality   opinion)),   that   \"the\n\nidentification of those officials whose decisions represent the\n\nofficial policy of the local governmental unit is itself a legal\n\nquestion to be resolved by the trial judge,\" and that:\n\n     \"Reviewing the relevant legal materials, including state and\n     local positive law, as well as \" \"custom or usage\" having the\n     force of law,' Praprotnik, supra [485 U.S.] at 124, n. 1, 108\n     S.Ct. at 924, n. 1, the trial judge must identify those\n     officials or governmental bodies who speak with final\n     policymaking authority for the local governmental actor\n     concerning the action alleged to have caused the particular\n     constitutional or statutory violation at issue.\" Jett, 491\n     U.S. at 737, 109 S.Ct. at 2723.\n\nThe Court noted that the DISD \"urges us to review Texas law and\n\ndetermine that neither Principal Todd nor Superintendent Wright\n\npossessed the authority to make final policy decisions concerning\n\nthe transfer of school district personnel\" and that \"Jett seems to\n\nconcede that Principal Todd did not have policymaking authority as\n\nto employee transfers ... but argues that Superintendent Wright had\n\nbeen delegated [such] authority....\"         Id. 491 U.S. at 738, 109\n\nS.Ct. at 2723.      The Court then concluded by stating:\n\n     \"We decline to resolve this issue on the record before us. We\n     think the Court of Appeals, whose expertise in interpreting\n\f      Texas law is greater than our own, is in a better position to\n      determine whether Superintendent Wright possessed final\n      policymaking authority in the area of employee transfers, and\n      if so whether a new trial is required to determine the\n      responsibility of the school district for the actions of\n      Principal Todd in light of this determination.... We remand\n      the case to the Court of Appeals for it to determine where\n      final policymaking authority as to employee transfers lay in\n      light of the principles enunciated by the plurality opinion in\n      Praprotnik and outlined above.\"     Id. 491 U.S. at 738, 109\n      S.Ct. at 2724 (emphasis added).\n\n      Preliminarily,         we   observe   that      the    Court's   remand    order\n\nfocuses on whether Superintendent Wright, not Principal Todd, had\n\nthe   requisite        relevant    policymaking       authority.       There    is   no\n\nevidence that Principal Todd had such authority, and Jett does not\n\nclaim otherwise.           We further note that the Court adverted to the\n\npossibility       of   a   new    trial   only   if    it    were   determined    that\n\nSuperintendent Wright had such policymaking authority.5                        In this\n\nconnection, there is no evidence or claim of any practice or custom\n\nof transferring DISD personnel on the basis of race, the exercise\n\nof First Amendment rights, or similar constitutionally proscribed\n\nbasis.        The only evidence of official DISD policy in this respect\n\nwas that it proscribed any such action.6                    Thus, the only possible\n\n      5\n      A new trial might be required in that instance—indeed would\nbe under our prior opinion—because the jury charge did not\ncondition DISD's liability on a finding (and the evidence did not\nestablish as a matter of law) that \"Wright knew or believed that\n(or, perhaps, was consciously indifferent to whether) Todd's\nrecommendation was ... based\" on Jett's race or exercise of First\nAmendment rights. Jett, 798 F.2d at 761. See note 3, supra.\n          6\n       The only evidence of DISD policy on discrimination was a\nwritten policy adopted by the DISD board of trustees that included\nthe following:\n\n               \"On the basis of an individual's race, color, religion,\n               sex, national origin, or age, the District shall not fail\n               or refuse to hire or discharge, nor shall it otherwise\n               discriminate against any individual with respect to\n               compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of\n\fbasis for DISD liability is if Superintendent Wright \"possessed\n\nfinal policy making authority as to employee transfers,\" a question\n\nthat the Court has directed be decided \"in light of the principles\n\nenunciated by the plurality opinion in Praprotnik and outlined\n\nabove.\"     Jett, 491 U.S. at 738, 109 S.Ct. at 2724.\n\n         The Praprotnik plurality and the Supreme Court's opinion in\n\nJett make clear that this is a question of state law.          Texas law is\n\nclear that final policymaking authority in an independent school\n\ndistrict, such as the DISD, rests with the district's board of\n\ntrustees.     Texas Education Code § 23.01 provides that \"The public\n\nschools of an independent school district shall be under the\n\ncontrol and management of a board of seven trustees.\"7                   The\n\nEducation Code further provides that \"[t]he trustees shall have the\n\nexclusive power to manage and govern the public free schools of the\n\ndistrict,\"    id.   §   23.26(b)   (emphasis   added),   and   that   \"[t]he\n\ntrustees may adopt such rules, regulations, and by-laws as they may\n\n\n             employment; nor shall the District limit, segregate, or\n             classify its employees, or applicants for employment, in\n             any way that would deprive or tend to deprive any\n             individual of employment opportunities or otherwise\n             affect the individual's status as employee.\"\n\n     The only evidence respecting DISD policy concerning basing\n     employee transfers on their First Amendment protected speech\n     was the following testimony of Superintendent Wright on\n     examination by Jett's counsel:\n\n             \"Q. Surely, Mr. Wright, it is not consistent with your\n             own policy and the policy of the DISD to use as a reason\n             for demotion or transfer the public speech or remarks\n             made by one of your employees, is it?\n\n             A. Not at all.\"\n     7\n      Section 23.023 provides that districts \"with 64,000 or more\nstudents in average daily attendance shall be under the management\nand control of a board of nine trustees.\"\n\fdeem proper.\"     Id. § 23.26(d).     Nothing in the Texas Education Code\n\npurports to give the Superintendent any policymaking authority or\n\nthe power to make rules or regulations, whether as to teacher or\n\nteacher/coach transfers or otherwise.8         It is to be noted that the\n\nEducation Code gives the board of trustees not only what might be\n\ndescribed as a form of legislative power over the district they\n\nserve—the power to make \"rules, regulations and by-laws\"—but also\n\na   form   of   executive    power,   the   power     to   \"control\"   and   the\n\n\"exclusive\" power to \"manage\" as well as to \"govern\" the district.\n\n      This has been recognized in Texas appellate court decisions.\n\nThus, in Pena v. Rio Grande City Consolidated Independent School\n\nDistrict, 616 S.W.2d 658 (Tex.Civ.App.—Eastland, 1981, n.w.h.) the\n\ncourt    held   that   the   superintendent    of     an   independent    school\n\ndistrict was not an \"officer\" of the district for purposes of\n\nTex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann.        art.   5996a   (Vernon    Supp.1980-81),      which\n\nprohibited \"any officer of any ... school district\" from voting\n\nfor, confirming, or appointing to \"any ... employment or duty ...\n\nany person\" within a certain degree of relationship to the officer.\n\nTo determine \"officer\" status, the court applied the test of\n\nwhether the individual's exercise of governmental power was \"\n\n\"largely independent of the control of others.' \"              Id. at 660.    It\n\nheld that the superintendent did not meet that test.                     It also\n\nstated in this connection that \"[a] superintendent is merely an\n\nemployee or agent of the school board,\" id. at 659 (emphasis\n\n     8\n     After the events here in issue, the Texas legislature enacted\nsection 13.351 of the Education Code (Acts 1984, 68th Leg., 2nd\nC.S., ch. 28, art. III, part F, § 1), which provides that \"[t]he\nsuperintendent is the educational leader and the administrative\nmanager of the school district.\"\n\fadded), and \"[a] school superintendent merely performs functions\n\ndelegated to him by the trustees who do not by such delegation\n\nabdicate their     statutory     authority       or   control.\"      Id.     at   660\n\n(emphasis added).         The Pena opinion was cited with approval in\n\nHinojosa    v.   State,    648   S.W.2d    380    (Tex.App.,       Austin,    1983,\n\ndiscretionary review refused), where another Texas appellate court\n\nstated \"the Education Code ... gives the trustees the exclusive\n\npower to manage and govern the school district. The superintendent\n\nand his subordinates were but employees or agents of the trustees.\"\n\nId. at 386 (emphasis in original).           We are aware of no decision\n\nwhich holds that under Texas law a school superintendent has\n\npolicymaking     authority.      Indeed,    Jett      does   not   argue     to   the\n\ncontrary.\n\n        Jett does contend that the DISD trustees had delegated final\n\npolicymaking authority as to employee transfers to Superintendent\n\nWright.     He points to the fact that a DISD policy adopted by the\n\nboard of trustees made the superintendent the final decisionmaker\n\non an employee's challenge to his or her proposed transfer,9 and to\n\n    9\n     This six-page policy governed both voluntary and involuntary\ntransfers. Provisions respecting involuntary transfers included\nthose arising from reduced enrollment or budget (providing, inter\nalia, for selection \"based on the amount of seniority within\ncertified fields, subject to departmental/extracurricular duties\"\nand for restoration to position if justified by subsequent\nenrollment or budget increase before instruction had begun) and\nthose for other reasons. As to the latter, the policy provides:\n\n            \"Any time during a school year that an immediate\n            supervisor wishes to request the transfer of an employee\n            for the ensuing school year, he or she shall complete the\n            prescribed form, conduct a conference with the employee,\n            secure the signature of the employee and forward the form\n            to   the    office   of    the   Subdistrict    assistant\n            superintendent. The Subdistrict assistant superintendent\n            shall receive the request and issue an approval or\n\fSuperintendent    Wright's   testimony   that     he    was     the    final\n\n\n\n          denial. If the request is approved, it shall then be\n          forwarded to the personnel services department for\n          processing, pending vacancies.\"\n\n          The policy provides for appeal as follows:\n\n          \"For the purpose of this policy, the appeal procedure is\n          available only for those receiving involuntary transfers\n          and shall not be deemed a formal grievance. District\n          intent is to provide an expedited hearing for employees\n          involuntarily transferred who feel that District policies\n          were violated, action was arbitrary or capricious, or\n          that constitutionally protected rights were violated.\n          Formal   appeals   shall  be   heard   at   the   General\n          Superintendent level, and the General Superintendent\n          shall exercise final jurisdiction. Employees requesting\n          hearings shall do so in accordance with the following\n          guidelines:\n\n          1. Within ten days after receipt of involuntary transfer\n               notice, employees shall call or write the employee\n               relations office to schedule an appointment to\n               discuss the transfer and related concerns for the\n               appeal.\n\n          2. The employee relations office shall make every effort\n               to resolve the problem informally.\n\n          3. If efforts to resolve the problem informally are not\n               successful,   an   appeal   committee   shall   be\n               established.

In Pembaur and Praprotnik the Court carefully\n\ndistinguished between those having mere decisionmaking authority\n\nand those having policymaking authority.   Pembaur first noted that\n\n\"municipal liability may be imposed for a single decision by\n\nmunicipal policymakers under appropriate circumstances,\" id. 475\n\nU.S. at 480, 106 S.Ct. at 1298, and that \"where action is directed\n\nby those who establish governmental policy, the municipality is\n\nequally responsible whether that action is to be taken only once or\n\nto be taken repeatedly.\"   Id. 475 U.S. at 481, 106 S.Ct. at 1299.\n\nPembaur went on, however, to emphasize that, for the municipality\n\nto be liable, the decision (whether or not one of policy) must be\n\nmade by an official with final policymaking authority in respect to\n\nthe matter decided, viz:\n\n     \"Municipal liability attaches only where the decisionmaker\n     possesses final authority to establish municipal policy with\n     respect to the action ordered. [footnote omitted] The fact\n     that a particular official—even a policymaking official—has\n     discretion in the exercise of particular functions does not,\n     without more, give rise to municipal liability based on an\n     exercise of that discretion. [citation and footnote omitted]\n     The official must also be responsible for establishing final\n     government policy respecting such activity before the\n     municipality can be held liable.12\"\n\n     —————\n     12\n       Thus, for example, the County Sheriff mmay have discretion\n     to hire and fire employees without also being the county\n     official responsible for establishing county employment\n\f     policy.   If this were the case, the Sheriff's decisions\n     respecting employment would not give rise to municipal\n     liability, although similar decisions with respect to law\n     enforcement practices, over which the Sheriff is the official\n     policymaker, would give rise to municipal liability. Instead,\n     if county employment policy was set by the Board of County\n     Commissioners, only that body's decisions would provide a\n     basis for county liability. This would be true even if the\n     Board left the Sheriff discretion to hire and fire employees\n     and   the   Sheriff   exercised    that   discretion  in   an\n     unconstitutional manner; the decision to act unlawfully would\n     not be a decision of the Board.        However, if the Board\n     delegated its power to establish final employment policy to\n     the Sheriff, the Sheriff's decisions would represent county\n     policy and could give rise to municipal liability.\" Id. 475\n     U.S. at 484 & n. 12, 106 S.Ct. at 1299-1300 & n. 12.\n\n     The   example    of   the   County   Sheriff     and    Board   of    County\n\nCommissioners clearly reflects that the Court sharply distinguished\n\nbetween decisionmakers and final policymakers.               This example was\n\nelevated from footnote to text in Praprotnik, where the Court held\n\nthat it was error to base liability on the employment decisions of\n\nofficials lacking final policymaking authority in that area, viz:\n\n     \"This case therefore resembles the hypothetical example in\n     Pembaur: \"[I]f [city] employment policy was set by the [Mayor\n     and Aldermen and by the Civil Service Commission], only\n     [those] bod[ies'] decisions would provide a basis for [city]\n     liability. This would be true even if the [Mayor and Aldermen\n     and the Commission] left the [appointing authorities]\n     discretion to hire and fire employees and [they] exercised\n     that discretion in an unconstitutional manner....' 475 U.S.,\n     at 483, n. 12, 106 S.Ct., at 1300, n. 12.\" Praprotnik, 485\n     U.S. at 130, 108 S.Ct. at 927.\n\nPraprotnik similarly states that \"the authority to make municipal\n\npolicy is necessarily the authority to make final policy....                   When\n\nan official's discretionary decisions are constrained by policies\n\nnot of that official's making, those policies, rather than the\n\nsubordinate's      departures    from     them,     are     the   act     of   the\n\nmunicipality,\" id. 485 U.S. at 127, 108 S.Ct. at 926 (emphasis in\n\noriginal),   and    that   \"[s]imply    going     along   with    discretionary\n\fdecisions made by one's subordinates, however, is not a delegation\n\nto them of the authority to make policy.\"            Id. 485 U.S. at 130, 108\n\nS.Ct. at 927.       The Court then observed:\n\n     \"It would be a different matter if a particular decision by a\n     subordinate was cast in the form of a policy statement and\n     expressly approved by the supervising policymaker. It would\n     also be a different matter if a series of decisions by a\n     subordinate official manifested a \"custom or usage' of which\n     the supervisor must have been aware. See supra, 485 U.S. at\n     127, 108 S.Ct. at 926. In both those cases, the supervisor\n     could realistically be deemed to have adopted a policy that\n     happened to have been formulated or initiated by a\n     lower-ranking official.\" Id. 485 U.S. at 130, 108 S.Ct. at\n     926-27.\n\nFinally, Praprotnik expressly rejected the concept of \"de facto\n\nfinal policymaking authority.\"            Id. 485 U.S. at 129, 108 S.Ct. at\n\n927.10\n\n     While Praprotnik and Pembaur do not expressly use the word\n\n\"final\" in their examples of officials who have decisionmaking but\n\nnot policymaking authority, that much seems clearly implied in the\n\ndescription    of    the   situation      as   one   where   the   policymaking\n\nauthority \"left the [decisionmaking official] discretion to hire\n\nand fire employees,\" there being no suggestion of any qualification\n\nsuch as \"initial\" discretion or the decisionmaker's action being\n\nsubject to appeal or the like.            The same conclusion follows from\n\nPraprotnik    's    statement   as   to    discretionary     decisions   of   an\n\nofficial being constrained by policies not of his own making, as\n\n\n         10\n       \"Nor do we believe that we have left a \"gaping hole' in §\n1983 that needs to be filled with the vague concept of \"de facto\nfinal policymaking authority.' Post [485 U.S., at 144, 108 S.Ct.],\nat 935. Except perhaps as a step towards overruling Monell and\nadopting the doctrine of respondeat superior, ad hoc searches for\nofficials possessing such \"de facto' authority would serve\nprimarily to foster needless unpredictability in the application of\n§ 1983.\" Id.\n\fthat applies even to individual decisions which are not reviewable.\n\n     The Seventh Circuit expressly took this view of the matter in\n\nAuriemma v. Rice, 957 F.2d 397 (7th Cir.1992), where it held that\n\nthe Chicago Superintendent of Police, Fred Rice, was not a city\n\npolicymaker respecting police officer demotions that were allegedly\n\nracially motivated, notwithstanding that he had final authority to\n\nmake the complained of demotions.11      We took essentially the same\n\n     11\n          The Auriemma Court observed:\n\n             \"On the plaintiffs' own theory, the buck stops with Fred\n             Rice.   (The complaint alleges that Rice cleared his\n             decisions with Harold Washington, then the mayor, but\n             this is immaterial;    the mayor is an executive, not\n             legislative, official in Chicago's system of government.)\n             Unless an entirely executive decision establishes\n             municipal policy because it is final, the plaintiffs must\n             lose.\n\n                  To state the issue in this way is to imply the\n             answer.   For what can it mean to say \"no vicarious\n             liability' unless there is a distinction between creation\n             and implementation of rules? Any city acts exclusively\n             through agents; the city is just a name for a complex of\n             persons. If it were enough to point to the agent whose\n             act was the final one in a particular case, we would have\n             vicarious liability. Action in the course of one's duty\n             is the basis of vicarious liability. That a particular\n             agent is the apex of a bureaucracy makes the decision\n             \"final' but does not forge a link between \"finality' and\n             \"policy'.... One may doubt the footing of Monell ... but\n             that decision is not to be sabotaged by calling the chief\n             bureaucrat who signs off on a particular action the\n             city's \"policymaker' for that action.\" Id. at 399-400.\n\n             \" \"[R]esponsibility for making law or setting policy'—the\n             objective under Praprotnik of our search through local\n             law—is authority to adopt rules for the conduct of\n             government. Authority to make a final decision need not\n             imply authority to establish rules. In Chicago it does\n             not.   The Superintendent of Police in Chicago had no\n             power to countermand the statutes regulating the\n             operation of the department. The chief has \"complete\n             authority to administer the department in a manner\n             consistent with the ordinances of the city, the laws of\n             the state, and the rules and regulations of the police\n             board.' ...

City of Slidell, 728\n\nF.2d 762, 735 F.2d 861 (5th Cir.1984), where \"we rejected the line\n\nof   authority   ...   which   would   permit   policy   or   custom   to   be\n\nattributed to the city itself by attribution to any and all\n\nofficers endowed with final or supervisory power or authority.\"\n\nId. 735 F.2d at 862.12\n\n      Although several policies of the DISD board of trustees were\n\nput in evidence,13 none purported to grant Superintendent Wright\n\npolicymaking authority respecting employee transfers.

And you were then of the opinion and still are that\n          that was the only procedure, that is the informal meeting\n          and conference that had transpired that existed within\n          the D.I.S.D. to deal with the Jett situation?\n\n          A. No, it was not the only procedure but it just happened\n          that the end results would have ended up the same because\n          it would still have to come to me for the final decision.\n          Coach Jett could have had the opportunity—whether he was\n          aware of it or not I am not sure—of appealing the\n          decision of Dr. Todd and [sic] which time I would have\n          appointed a panel to hear that. They would have still\n          made the recommendation to me. Since Coach Jett came to\n          me directly as Mr. Santillo directed him then that\n          procedure was bypassed.\n\n          Q. Are you in agreement with Dr. Todd's testimony\n          yesterday however that under the written transfer policy\n          of the District that Coach Jett actually would have been\n          entitled to a hearing [sic] this matter?\n\n          A. If he had asked for   it before he came to me and if he\n          had wanted it then we    could have gone through a formal\n          hearing process but I    considered that he considered he\n          was having his hearing   when he was there with me.\n\n          Q. Okay. I see. Well, in fact—let me just find that\n          policy real quickly. Looking at Plaintiff's Exhibit 9\n          under your Provisions for Involuntary Transfer it states\n          that the first thing that has to be done is that the\n          immediate supervisor shall complete the prescribed form,\n          conduct a conference with the employee, secure the\n          signature of the employee and forward the form to the\n          office of the sub District Superintendent, doesn't it?\n\n          A. In that case they are talking about teachers.\n\n          Q. Excuse me.   Is that what it says?\n\n          A. That is what it says, yes.\n\n          Q. And it doesn't say teacher.      It says any employee,\n          right?\n\n          A. Right.\n\fQ. And if the transfer provisions were pertinent just as\nDr. Todd said yesterday he didn't follow that, did he?\n\nA. Not per se, no.\n\nQ. Well, he didn't do any of that, did he?\n\nA. He made a recommendation to his immediate supervisor\nthat Dr. Todd be involuntarily transferred to another\nposition.\n\nQ. I think you misspoke. You said Dr. Todd. You mean\nDr. Todd made a recommendation to his supervisor that he\nbe transferred?\n\nA. Yes, sir.\n\nQ. Yes, sir. But it doesn't say to his supervisor, does\nit? It says it shall be sent to the office of the sub\nDistrict Assistant Superintendent, doesn't it?\n\nA. In the case of a teacher that would apply. In the\ncase of a Coach or an Athletic Director it would go to\nthe Athletic Department.\n\nQ. First of all, I thought you told us a few minutes ago\nthat the policy of the District where they say teachers\nare customarily applied to Coaches and Athletic\nDirectors?\n\nA. Except that we have a gray area that is not covered\nhere, Mr. Hill, in that Area Superintendents don't make\nthe decision on Athletic Directors and Coaches per se.\nThat is left up between the Athletic Department and the\nprincipal and myself.\n\nQ. Is there any written statement of that?\n\nA. No, sir, there is not.\n\nQ. Well, in addition to that Coach Jett was being\ntransferred involuntarily and a teacher too, wasn't he?\n\nA. Correct.\n\nQ. So these policies would be pertinent to Coach Jett,\nwouldn't they?\n\nA. That is what I meant a moment ago that he could have\nmade such a request if he was aware of it. I doubt he\nwas aware of it.\n\fto establish that the DISD board of trustees had delegated to\n\n\n\n         Q. Now, with respect to Coaches and Athletic Directors I\n         believe you have indicated several times here there is no\n         specific policy that covers that?\n\n         A. Not per se, no.\n\n         Q. But you have developed some practices that you attempt\n         to follow within the District when those problems arise?\n\n         A. That is correct.\n\n         Q. And typically how is that situation handled?\n\n         A. Well, we try to follow the same procedures of trying\n         to make sure that employees' considerations, employees\n         are considered and the person making the recommendation\n         considered and in the case of Athletic Director and Coach\n         then it generally goes to the Administrator of Athletics\n         which is Mr. John Kincaid and the principal to help work\n         out those differences and then if it can't be resolved\n         there then it is supposed to go to their immediate\n         supervisor and then on up the ladder to me which I am the\n         end of the appeal just like I am with teachers or anyone\n         else.\n\n         Q. (By Mr. Townend) Superintendent Wright, when a problem\n         arises between a principal and a Head Coach such as with\n         Dr. Todd and Mr. Jett, can you describe the normal\n         approaches or the normal ways in which that problem is\n         dealt with within the District?\n\n         [Court overrides objection by Jett's counsel.]\n\n         A. Well, it is not only normal policy and practice but it\n         is not stipulated personnel policy but it is stipulated\n         in other administrative policies that any problem that\n         arises as far as an employee, it goes through channels.\n         In the case of athletics it goes from the principal to\n         the Administrator for Athletics and to the Assistant\n         Superintendent for district wide programs who has the\n         responsibility for Athletics and from that person to the\n         Superintendent.\n\n         If it is a teacher problem it goes from the principal to\n         the   Area   Administrator    to  the    Area   Assistant\n         Superintendent to the Superintendent so there is a\n         channel for any problem that occurs that would be handled\n         and that is not only normal but it is prescribed by\n         policy under administration, not only personnel.\"\n         (Emphasis added).\n\fSuperintendent       Wright    final   policymaking         authority      concerning\n\nemployee transfers. Wright's testimony contains no such assertion.\n\nHe was merely interpreting or applying the written policy of the\n\nDISD trustees, and, apparently, he was doing so erroneously, as the\n\nparts of the policy addressed (see note 9, supra ) speak of\n\n\"employee\"      or    \"employees,\"      not        teachers     or      coaches      or\n\nteacher/coaches.15      Moreover, Wright's testimony in this regard is\n\nplainly directed only to the particular administrative channel to\n\nbe initially followed by the supervisor requesting a transfer be\n\nmade, namely whether the request is to go to \"the Subdistrict\n\nassistant superintendent\" as the policy says (see quotation at end\n\nof first paragraph of note 9, supra ) or whether, as Wright\n\nconstrued it, that did not apply to coaches (or teacher/coaches)\n\nand that instead in such a case the supervisor's request would\n\ninitially go to the DISD's Athletic Department.16                    Even if Wright\n\nhad the authority to provide for such a bureaucratic channel for\n\nteacher/coach transfer requests to initially follow, this would not\n\nsuffice to show that he had relevant substantive policymaking\n\nauthority respecting teacher/coach transfers, which is the only\n\nissue here.\n\n         Jett   contends      that   Wright       had   a   policy    of    approving\n\ninvoluntary     transfers     sought   by     a    principal    even       though   the\n\n\n    15\n      In other parts of the policy it does refer to \"teachers\" and\nto \"coaches,\" and, indeed, to \"nurses,\" thus also indicating that\nthe broader word \"employee\" or \"employees\" was used advisedly.\n         16\n          Wright did not testify that the three-person hearing\ncommittee procedures (see quoted material in last paragraph of note\n9, supra ) were different for coaches or teacher/coaches than for\nteachers.\n\fprincipal was motivated by the employee's race or exercise of First\n\nAmendment     rights,   so    long     as    there   was   an    irreconcilable\n\npersonality    conflict      between   the    principal    and   the   employee.\n\nAssuming, arguendo, that there was sufficient evidence for the jury\n\nto infer that such a consideration motivated Wright's action in\n\nrespect to Jett, it was certainly not the basis Wright articulated\n\nfor his decision,17 and there is no evidence that it was his policy.\n\nJett relies on Wright's testimony that \"[w]e had something here\n\n     17\n      Principal Todd made various specific complaints about Jett,\nincluding Jett's poor attendance at faculty meetings, equipment\npurchasing policies, and lesson plan preparation. Wright testified\nthat he discussed these matters with Jett, who told Wright \"he\n[Jett] thought ... that whenever he [Todd] forced him [Jett] to\ncome to teachers' meetings or faculty meetings and keep records of\ninventory and things like that that he [Jett] thought that was\nunreasonable,\" and that Wright then told Jett \"I don't consider\nthat unreasonable.\" Wright further testified:\n\n            \"... I told Coach Jett that I felt that Dr. Todd was only\n            carrying out his responsibilities as principal and that\n            those were the kinds of things I expected him to do and\n            that if, you know, if he was being unreasonable that was\n            one thing but as far as the actual accountability of\n            expecting an accounting for money and requiring him not\n            make unauthorized purchases and requiring him to attend\n            faculty meetings or requiring he have lesson plans, all\n            of those were in the area of expectation of the teacher\n            or Coach or any other employee in that building.\"\n\n            Wright further testified:\n\n            \"Q. (By Mr. Townend) In your first conference did Mr.\n            Jett suggest to you that Dr. Todd be transferred?\n\n            A. Yes, sir, he did. He felt that Mr. McWhorter had been\n            unsuccessful and had been transferred and that he had\n            such a successful record that he felt that Dr. Todd was\n            the one in error. That is when I came to the conclusion\n            that there were differences that were not resolvable and\n            I told Coach Jett at the time that if I have to make a\n            decision between the principal and the coach it is\n            obvious that the principal is responsible for the school\n            and would be the one to stay unless he was in error\n            himself and I hadn't found anywhere where Dr. Todd was in\n            error.\" (Emphasis added).\n\fthat is unfortunate that happens a lot of time between two people\n\nand when it occurs someone has to give and I have to make that\n\njudgment decision as to who has to go and in this case it was coach\n\nJett.\"     This is not inconsistent with Wright's testimony (see note\n\n17) that he approved the Jett transfer because the differences were\n\nirreconcilable \"and I haven't found anywhere where Dr. Todd was in\n\nerror,\" and certainly does not support an inference that Wright\n\ngenerally approved transfer recommendations despite their being\n\nunconstitutionally motivated.        More significantly, such would be\n\ncontrary to the policies of the DISD board of trustees and there is\n\nnothing to suggest that they knew or can be assumed to have known\n\nthat Wright acted on such a basis.        As previously observed, there\n\nis no evidence of any other unconstitutionally motivated employee\n\ntransfer (or other personnel action) being taken or approved by\n\nWright.     This is a single incident case.\n\n         The evidence is simply not sufficient to support a finding\n\nthat Superintendent Wright possessed final policymaking authority\n\nin   the    area   of   employee   transfers.   Under   Texas   law   such\n\npolicymaking authority rested exclusively with the DISD board of\n\ntrustees, and there is no evidence they had delegated it to\n\nSuperintendent Wright.       Jett in substance argues for the kind of\n\n\"de facto final policymaking authority\" rejected in Praprotnik.\n\n485 U.S. at 129, 108 S.Ct. at 927.       Moreover, there is no evidence\n\nthat Superintendent Wright's decision in Jett's case either \"was\n\ncast in the form of a policy statement and expressly approved by\n\nthe\" DISD board or that \"a series of decisions by\" Wright in this\n\narea \"manifested a \"custom or usage' of which the\" DISD board \"must\n\fhave been aware.\"   Praprotnik, 485 U.S. at 130, 108 S.Ct. at 926-\n\n27.\n\n      Accordingly, the judgment against the DISD and in favor of\n\nJett is reversed and the cause is remanded with directions to enter\n\njudgment in favor of the DISD as respects all of Jett's claims\n\nagainst it.\n\n      REVERSED and REMANDED with DIRECTIONS\n\n                              . . . . .\n\n\n\n                              . . . . .\n\n\n\n                              . . . . .\n\n\n\n                              . . . . .\n\f",

For present purposes, it\n\nsuffices   to   note   that   plaintiff-appellee   Norman   Jett   (Jett),\n\nformerly a teacher, coach, and athletic director at South Oak Cliff\n\nHigh School (South Oak Cliff) in the Dallas Independent School\n\nDistrict (DISD), brought this suit under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1983\n\nagainst the DISD and the South Oak Cliff principal, Dr. Frederick\n\nTodd (Principal Todd), complaining that his transfer from South Oak\n\nCliff to a teaching position without any coaching duties at another\n\n     *\n      This decision is rendered by a quorum pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n§ 46(d).\n\fDISD school violated his constitutional rights to equal protection\n\nof the laws and freedom of speech.           The transfer was made on the\n\nrecommendation of Principal Todd and was ordered and approved by\n\nthe DISD superintendent, Dr. Linus Wright (Superintendent Wright),\n\nwho was not made a defendant.          Principal Todd did not purport to\n\norder the transfer and he had no authority to do so.                   No action\n\nrespecting the transfer was taken by the DISD board of trustees,\n\nnor was that matter ever brought, or sought to be brought, before\n\nthe board of trustees.      Jett, who is white, claimed that Principal\n\nTodd, who is black, was improperly motivated in making his transfer\n\nrecommendation by racial considerations and by Jett's exercise of\n\nhis   First   Amendment     rights,    and   that    he,   Jett,       had   told\n\nSuperintendent    Wright,     before    Wright      approved     the    transfer\n\nrecommendation, that Principal Todd's real reason for recommending\n\nthe transfer was that he wanted to replace Jett with a black\n\ncoach.1\n\n      The case was tried to a jury, which awarded Jett damages\n\nagainst the DISD and Principal Todd individually, finding that\n\nPrincipal     Todd's    transfer   recommendation       was      substantially\n\nmotivated by both Jett's race and his exercise of First Amendment\n\nrights and that the DISD's transfer of Jett \"was based solely on\n\nDefendant     Todd's     recommendation       without      any     independent\n\ninvestigation.\"        Following remittitur of some of the damages,\n\n\n      1\n     As noted in our prior opinion, Todd testified race played no\npart in his recommendation, and Wright testified that neither\nJett's race nor his having made statements to the media played any\npart in his decision and that he was unaware that Todd had based\nhis recommendation on remarks Jett made to the media. Jett, 798\nF.2d at 761.\n\fjudgment on the verdict was entered for Jett and against the DISD\n\nand Principal Todd.\n\n        On the appeal to this Court by the DISD and Principal Todd, we\n\naffirmed the district court insofar as it held Principal Todd\n\nliable for making his transfer recommendation on the basis of\n\nJett's race and First Amendment protected speech.2                 We reversed and\n\nremanded Jett's section 1983 equal protection and First Amendment\n\nclaims      against   the    DISD    because     the    district    court's   jury\n\ninstructions failed to state that the DISD \"could be bound by the\n\nprincipal or superintendent only if he was delegated policy making\n\nauthority (or if he participated in a well settled custom that\n\nfairly represented official policy and actual or constructive\n\nknowledge of the custom was attributable to the governing body or\n\nan official delegated policy making authority).\" Jett, 798 F.2d at\n\n759.3       We   further    held    that   the   same    standards    applied   to\n\n        2\n      Jett also alleged in the district court, and the jury found,\nthat he had a property interest in his position at South Oak Cliff\nwhich the DISD deprived him of without due process of law, and that\nthe DISD constructively discharged him from its employment. We\nreversed and rendered judgment against Jett on these claims,\nholding that as a matter of law Jett was not constructively\ndischarged and that his transfer from South Oak Cliff did not\ndeprive him of a property interest as his full agreed compensation\nwas continued.    These matters are no longer at issue.     Nor is\nPrincipal Todd's personal liability any longer at issue, as he and\nJett settled while the case was pending rehearing in this Court.\nSee Jett, 491 U.S. at 707-709, 109 S.Ct. at 2708.\n    3\n     We further held that the charge was deficient even if it were\nassumed that Superintendent Wright, having the final authority in\ndeciding whether a given transfer of a particular teacher-coach\nwould be made, also had the requisite policymaking authority in\nrespect to such transfers, because nothing in the charge required\nthe jury to find \"that Wright's decision was in fact improperly\nmotivated or that Wright knew or believed that (or was consciously\nindifferent to whether) Todd's recommendation was so motivated.\"\nId. at 760. We noted in this connection that \"Todd clearly was not\na policymaker.\" Id. at 761.\n\fgovernmental liability under section 1981, and accordingly reversed\n\nand remanded Jett's section 1981 claim against the DISD.

The Court then concluded by stating:\n\n     \"We decline to resolve this issue on the record before us. We\n     think the Court of Appeals, whose expertise in interpreting\n\f      Texas law is greater than our own, is in a better position to\n      determine whether Superintendent Wright possessed final\n      policymaking authority in the area of employee transfers, and\n      if so whether a new trial is required to determine the\n      responsibility of the school district for the actions of\n      Principal Todd in light of this determination.... We remand\n      the case to the Court of Appeals for it to determine where\n      final policymaking authority as to employee transfers lay in\n      light of the principles enunciated by the plurality opinion in\n      Praprotnik and outlined above.\"     Id. 491 U.S. at 738, 109\n      S.Ct. at 2724 (emphasis added).\n\n      Preliminarily,         we   observe   that      the    Court's   remand    order\n\nfocuses on whether Superintendent Wright, not Principal Todd, had\n\nthe   requisite        relevant    policymaking       authority.       There    is   no\n\nevidence that Principal Todd had such authority, and Jett does not\n\nclaim otherwise.           We further note that the Court adverted to the\n\npossibility       of   a   new    trial   only   if    it    were   determined    that\n\nSuperintendent Wright had such policymaking authority.5                        In this\n\nconnection, there is no evidence or claim of any practice or custom\n\nof transferring DISD personnel on the basis of race, the exercise\n\nof First Amendment rights, or similar constitutionally proscribed\n\nbasis.        The only evidence of official DISD policy in this respect\n\nwas that it proscribed any such action.6                    Thus, the only possible\n\n      5\n      A new trial might be required in that instance—indeed would\nbe under our prior opinion—because the jury charge did not\ncondition DISD's liability on a finding (and the evidence did not\nestablish as a matter of law) that \"Wright knew or believed that\n(or, perhaps, was consciously indifferent to whether) Todd's\nrecommendation was ... based\" on Jett's race or exercise of First\nAmendment rights. Jett, 798 F.2d at 761. See note 3, supra.\n          6\n       The only evidence of DISD policy on discrimination was a\nwritten policy adopted by the DISD board of trustees that included\nthe following:\n\n               \"On the basis of an individual's race, color, religion,\n               sex, national origin, or age, the District shall not fail\n               or refuse to hire or discharge, nor shall it otherwise\n               discriminate against any individual with respect to\n               compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of\n\fbasis for DISD liability is if Superintendent Wright \"possessed\n\nfinal policy making authority as to employee transfers,\" a question\n\nthat the Court has directed be decided \"in light of the principles\n\nenunciated by the plurality opinion in Praprotnik and outlined\n\nabove.\"     Jett, 491 U.S. at 738, 109 S.Ct. at 2724.\n\n         The Praprotnik plurality and the Supreme Court's opinion in\n\nJett make clear that this is a question of state law.          Texas law is\n\nclear that final policymaking authority in an independent school\n\ndistrict, such as the DISD, rests with the district's board of\n\ntrustees.     Texas Education Code § 23.01 provides that \"The public\n\nschools of an independent school district shall be under the\n\ncontrol and management of a board of seven trustees.\"7                   The\n\nEducation Code further provides that \"[t]he trustees shall have the\n\nexclusive power to manage and govern the public free schools of the\n\ndistrict,\"    id.   §   23.26(b)   (emphasis   added),   and   that   \"[t]he\n\ntrustees may adopt such rules, regulations, and by-laws as they may\n\n\n             employment; nor shall the District limit, segregate, or\n             classify its employees, or applicants for employment, in\n             any way that would deprive or tend to deprive any\n             individual of employment opportunities or otherwise\n             affect the individual's status as employee.\"\n\n     The only evidence respecting DISD policy concerning basing\n     employee transfers on their First Amendment protected speech\n     was the following testimony of Superintendent Wright on\n     examination by Jett's counsel:\n\n             \"Q. Surely, Mr. Wright, it is not consistent with your\n             own policy and the policy of the DISD to use as a reason\n             for demotion or transfer the public speech or remarks\n             made by one of your employees, is it?\n\n             A.

The superintendent\n\nand his subordinates were but employees or agents of the trustees.\"\n\nId. at 386 (emphasis in original).           We are aware of no decision\n\nwhich holds that under Texas law a school superintendent has\n\npolicymaking     authority.      Indeed,    Jett      does   not   argue     to   the\n\ncontrary.\n\n        Jett does contend that the DISD trustees had delegated final\n\npolicymaking authority as to employee transfers to Superintendent\n\nWright.     He points to the fact that a DISD policy adopted by the\n\nboard of trustees made the superintendent the final decisionmaker\n\non an employee's challenge to his or her proposed transfer,9 and to\n\n    9\n     This six-page policy governed both voluntary and involuntary\ntransfers. Provisions respecting involuntary transfers included\nthose arising from reduced enrollment or budget (providing, inter\nalia, for selection \"based on the amount of seniority within\ncertified fields, subject to departmental/extracurricular duties\"\nand for restoration to position if justified by subsequent\nenrollment or budget increase before instruction had begun) and\nthose for other reasons. As to the latter, the policy provides:\n\n            \"Any time during a school year that an immediate\n            supervisor wishes to request the transfer of an employee\n            for the ensuing school year, he or she shall complete the\n            prescribed form, conduct a conference with the employee,\n            secure the signature of the employee and forward the form\n            to   the    office   of    the   Subdistrict    assistant\n            superintendent. The Subdistrict assistant superintendent\n            shall receive the request and issue an approval or\n\fSuperintendent    Wright's   testimony   that     he    was     the    final\n\n\n\n          denial. If the request is approved, it shall then be\n          forwarded to the personnel services department for\n          processing, pending vacancies.\"\n\n          The policy provides for appeal as follows:\n\n          \"For the purpose of this policy, the appeal procedure is\n          available only for those receiving involuntary transfers\n          and shall not be deemed a formal grievance. District\n          intent is to provide an expedited hearing for employees\n          involuntarily transferred who feel that District policies\n          were violated, action was arbitrary or capricious, or\n          that constitutionally protected rights were violated.\n          Formal   appeals   shall  be   heard   at   the   General\n          Superintendent level, and the General Superintendent\n          shall exercise final jurisdiction.

The employee relations office shall make every effort\n               to resolve the problem informally.\n\n          3. If efforts to resolve the problem informally are not\n               successful,   an   appeal   committee   shall   be\n               established. The committee shall be composed of:\n\n          a. One classroom teacher.\n\n          b. One principal.\n\n          c.     One   ombudsperson   appointed        by     the     General\n                 Superintendent.\n\n          4.

In Pembaur and Praprotnik the Court carefully\n\ndistinguished between those having mere decisionmaking authority\n\nand those having policymaking authority.   Pembaur first noted that\n\n\"municipal liability may be imposed for a single decision by\n\nmunicipal policymakers under appropriate circumstances,\" id. 475\n\nU.S. at 480, 106 S.Ct. at 1298, and that \"where action is directed\n\nby those who establish governmental policy, the municipality is\n\nequally responsible whether that action is to be taken only once or\n\nto be taken repeatedly.\"   Id. 475 U.S. at 481, 106 S.Ct. at 1299.\n\nPembaur went on, however, to emphasize that, for the municipality\n\nto be liable, the decision (whether or not one of policy) must be\n\nmade by an official with final policymaking authority in respect to\n\nthe matter decided, viz:\n\n     \"Municipal liability attaches only where the decisionmaker\n     possesses final authority to establish municipal policy with\n     respect to the action ordered. [footnote omitted] The fact\n     that a particular official—even a policymaking official—has\n     discretion in the exercise of particular functions does not,\n     without more, give rise to municipal liability based on an\n     exercise of that discretion. [citation and footnote omitted]\n     The official must also be responsible for establishing final\n     government policy respecting such activity before the\n     municipality can be held liable.12\"\n\n     —————\n     12\n       Thus, for example, the County Sheriff mmay have discretion\n     to hire and fire employees without also being the county\n     official responsible for establishing county employment\n\f     policy.   If this were the case, the Sheriff's decisions\n     respecting employment would not give rise to municipal\n     liability, although similar decisions with respect to law\n     enforcement practices, over which the Sheriff is the official\n     policymaker, would give rise to municipal liability. Instead,\n     if county employment policy was set by the Board of County\n     Commissioners, only that body's decisions would provide a\n     basis for county liability. This would be true even if the\n     Board left the Sheriff discretion to hire and fire employees\n     and   the   Sheriff   exercised    that   discretion  in   an\n     unconstitutional manner; the decision to act unlawfully would\n     not be a decision of the Board.        However, if the Board\n     delegated its power to establish final employment policy to\n     the Sheriff, the Sheriff's decisions would represent county\n     policy and could give rise to municipal liability.\" Id. 475\n     U.S. at 484 & n. 12, 106 S.Ct. at 1299-1300 & n. 12.\n\n     The   example    of   the   County   Sheriff     and    Board   of    County\n\nCommissioners clearly reflects that the Court sharply distinguished\n\nbetween decisionmakers and final policymakers.               This example was\n\nelevated from footnote to text in Praprotnik, where the Court held\n\nthat it was error to base liability on the employment decisions of\n\nofficials lacking final policymaking authority in that area, viz:\n\n     \"This case therefore resembles the hypothetical example in\n     Pembaur: \"[I]f [city] employment policy was set by the [Mayor\n     and Aldermen and by the Civil Service Commission], only\n     [those] bod[ies'] decisions would provide a basis for [city]\n     liability. This would be true even if the [Mayor and Aldermen\n     and the Commission] left the [appointing authorities]\n     discretion to hire and fire employees and [they] exercised\n     that discretion in an unconstitutional manner....' 475 U.S.,\n     at 483, n. 12, 106 S.Ct., at 1300, n. 12.\" Praprotnik, 485\n     U.S. at 130, 108 S.Ct. at 927.\n\nPraprotnik similarly states that \"the authority to make municipal\n\npolicy is necessarily the authority to make final policy....                   When\n\nan official's discretionary decisions are constrained by policies\n\nnot of that official's making, those policies, rather than the\n\nsubordinate's      departures    from     them,     are     the   act     of   the\n\nmunicipality,\" id. 485 U.S. at 127, 108 S.Ct. at 926 (emphasis in\n\noriginal),   and    that   \"[s]imply    going     along   with    discretionary\n\fdecisions made by one's subordinates, however, is not a delegation\n\nto them of the authority to make policy.\"            Id. 485 U.S. at 130, 108\n\nS.Ct. at 927.       The Court then observed:\n\n     \"It would be a different matter if a particular decision by a\n     subordinate was cast in the form of a policy statement and\n     expressly approved by the supervising policymaker. It would\n     also be a different matter if a series of decisions by a\n     subordinate official manifested a \"custom or usage' of which\n     the supervisor must have been aware. See supra, 485 U.S. at\n     127, 108 S.Ct. at 926. In both those cases, the supervisor\n     could realistically be deemed to have adopted a policy that\n     happened to have been formulated or initiated by a\n     lower-ranking official.\" Id. 485 U.S. at 130, 108 S.Ct. at\n     926-27.\n\nFinally, Praprotnik expressly rejected the concept of \"de facto\n\nfinal policymaking authority.\"            Id. 485 U.S. at 129, 108 S.Ct. at\n\n927.10\n\n     While Praprotnik and Pembaur do not expressly use the word\n\n\"final\" in their examples of officials who have decisionmaking but\n\nnot policymaking authority, that much seems clearly implied in the\n\ndescription    of    the   situation      as   one   where   the   policymaking\n\nauthority \"left the [decisionmaking official] discretion to hire\n\nand fire employees,\" there being no suggestion of any qualification\n\nsuch as \"initial\" discretion or the decisionmaker's action being\n\nsubject to appeal or the like.            The same conclusion follows from\n\nPraprotnik    's    statement   as   to    discretionary     decisions   of   an\n\nofficial being constrained by policies not of his own making, as\n\n\n         10\n       \"Nor do we believe that we have left a \"gaping hole' in §\n1983 that needs to be filled with the vague concept of \"de facto\nfinal policymaking authority.'

(The complaint alleges that Rice cleared his\n             decisions with Harold Washington, then the mayor, but\n             this is immaterial;    the mayor is an executive, not\n             legislative, official in Chicago's system of government.)\n             Unless an entirely executive decision establishes\n             municipal policy because it is final, the plaintiffs must\n             lose.\n\n                  To state the issue in this way is to imply the\n             answer.   For what can it mean to say \"no vicarious\n             liability' unless there is a distinction between creation\n             and implementation of rules? Any city acts exclusively\n             through agents; the city is just a name for a complex of\n             persons. If it were enough to point to the agent whose\n             act was the final one in a particular case, we would have\n             vicarious liability. Action in the course of one's duty\n             is the basis of vicarious liability. That a particular\n             agent is the apex of a bureaucracy makes the decision\n             \"final' but does not forge a link between \"finality' and\n             \"policy'.... One may doubt the footing of Monell ... but\n             that decision is not to be sabotaged by calling the chief\n             bureaucrat who signs off on a particular action the\n             city's \"policymaker' for that action.\" Id. at 399-400.\n\n             \" \"[R]esponsibility for making law or setting policy'—the\n             objective under Praprotnik of our search through local\n             law—is authority to adopt rules for the conduct of\n             government. Authority to make a final decision need not\n             imply authority to establish rules. In Chicago it does\n             not.

In that case they are talking about teachers.\n\n          Q. Excuse me.   Is that what it says?\n\n          A. That is what it says, yes.\n\n          Q. And it doesn't say teacher.      It says any employee,\n          right?\n\n          A. Right.\n\fQ. And if the transfer provisions were pertinent just as\nDr. Todd said yesterday he didn't follow that, did he?\n\nA. Not per se, no.\n\nQ. Well, he didn't do any of that, did he?\n\nA. He made a recommendation to his immediate supervisor\nthat Dr. Todd be involuntarily transferred to another\nposition.\n\nQ. I think you misspoke. You said Dr. Todd. You mean\nDr. Todd made a recommendation to his supervisor that he\nbe transferred?\n\nA. Yes, sir.\n\nQ. Yes, sir. But it doesn't say to his supervisor, does\nit? It says it shall be sent to the office of the sub\nDistrict Assistant Superintendent, doesn't it?\n\nA. In the case of a teacher that would apply. In the\ncase of a Coach or an Athletic Director it would go to\nthe Athletic Department.\n\nQ. First of all, I thought you told us a few minutes ago\nthat the policy of the District where they say teachers\nare customarily applied to Coaches and Athletic\nDirectors?\n\nA. Except that we have a gray area that is not covered\nhere, Mr. Hill, in that Area Superintendents don't make\nthe decision on Athletic Directors and Coaches per se.\nThat is left up between the Athletic Department and the\nprincipal and myself.\n\nQ. Is there any written statement of that?\n\nA. No, sir, there is not.\n\nQ. Well, in addition to that Coach Jett was being\ntransferred involuntarily and a teacher too, wasn't he?\n\nA. Correct.\n\nQ. So these policies would be pertinent to Coach Jett,\nwouldn't they?\n\nA. That is what I meant a moment ago that he could have\nmade such a request if he was aware of it. I doubt he\nwas aware of it.\n\fto establish that the DISD board of trustees had delegated to\n\n\n\n         Q. Now, with respect to Coaches and Athletic Directors I\n         believe you have indicated several times here there is no\n         specific policy that covers that?\n\n         A. Not per se, no.\n\n         Q. But you have developed some practices that you attempt\n         to follow within the District when those problems arise?\n\n         A. That is correct.\n\n         Q. And typically how is that situation handled?\n\n         A. Well, we try to follow the same procedures of trying\n         to make sure that employees' considerations, employees\n         are considered and the person making the recommendation\n         considered and in the case of Athletic Director and Coach\n         then it generally goes to the Administrator of Athletics\n         which is Mr. John Kincaid and the principal to help work\n         out those differences and then if it can't be resolved\n         there then it is supposed to go to their immediate\n         supervisor and then on up the ladder to me which I am the\n         end of the appeal just like I am with teachers or anyone\n         else.\n\n         Q. (By Mr. Townend) Superintendent Wright, when a problem\n         arises between a principal and a Head Coach such as with\n         Dr. Todd and Mr. Jett, can you describe the normal\n         approaches or the normal ways in which that problem is\n         dealt with within the District?\n\n         [Court overrides objection by Jett's counsel.]\n\n         A. Well, it is not only normal policy and practice but it\n         is not stipulated personnel policy but it is stipulated\n         in other administrative policies that any problem that\n         arises as far as an employee, it goes through channels.\n         In the case of athletics it goes from the principal to\n         the Administrator for Athletics and to the Assistant\n         Superintendent for district wide programs who has the\n         responsibility for Athletics and from that person to the\n         Superintendent.\n\n         If it is a teacher problem it goes from the principal to\n         the   Area   Administrator    to  the    Area   Assistant\n         Superintendent to the Superintendent so there is a\n         channel for any problem that occurs that would be handled\n         and that is not only normal but it is prescribed by\n         policy under administration, not only personnel.\"\n         (Emphasis added).\n\fSuperintendent       Wright    final   policymaking         authority      concerning\n\nemployee transfers. Wright's testimony contains no such assertion.\n\nHe was merely interpreting or applying the written policy of the\n\nDISD trustees, and, apparently, he was doing so erroneously, as the\n\nparts of the policy addressed (see note 9, supra ) speak of\n\n\"employee\"      or    \"employees,\"      not        teachers     or      coaches      or\n\nteacher/coaches.15      Moreover, Wright's testimony in this regard is\n\nplainly directed only to the particular administrative channel to\n\nbe initially followed by the supervisor requesting a transfer be\n\nmade, namely whether the request is to go to \"the Subdistrict\n\nassistant superintendent\" as the policy says (see quotation at end\n\nof first paragraph of note 9, supra ) or whether, as Wright\n\nconstrued it, that did not apply to coaches (or teacher/coaches)\n\nand that instead in such a case the supervisor's request would\n\ninitially go to the DISD's Athletic Department.16                    Even if Wright\n\nhad the authority to provide for such a bureaucratic channel for\n\nteacher/coach transfer requests to initially follow, this would not\n\nsuffice to show that he had relevant substantive policymaking\n\nauthority respecting teacher/coach transfers, which is the only\n\nissue here.\n\n         Jett   contends      that   Wright       had   a   policy    of    approving\n\ninvoluntary     transfers     sought   by     a    principal    even       though   the\n\n\n    15\n      In other parts of the policy it does refer to \"teachers\" and\nto \"coaches,\" and, indeed, to \"nurses,\" thus also indicating that\nthe broader word \"employee\" or \"employees\" was used advisedly.\n         16\n          Wright did not testify that the three-person hearing\ncommittee procedures (see quoted material in last paragraph of note\n9, supra ) were different for coaches or teacher/coaches than for\nteachers.\n\fprincipal was motivated by the employee's race or exercise of First\n\nAmendment     rights,   so    long     as    there   was   an    irreconcilable\n\npersonality    conflict      between   the    principal    and   the   employee.\n\nAssuming, arguendo, that there was sufficient evidence for the jury\n\nto infer that such a consideration motivated Wright's action in\n\nrespect to Jett, it was certainly not the basis Wright articulated\n\nfor his decision,17 and there is no evidence that it was his policy.\n\nJett relies on Wright's testimony that \"[w]e had something here\n\n     17\n      Principal Todd made various specific complaints about Jett,\nincluding Jett's poor attendance at faculty meetings, equipment\npurchasing policies, and lesson plan preparation. Wright testified\nthat he discussed these matters with Jett, who told Wright \"he\n[Jett] thought ... that whenever he [Todd] forced him [Jett] to\ncome to teachers' meetings or faculty meetings and keep records of\ninventory and things like that that he [Jett] thought that was\nunreasonable,\" and that Wright then told Jett \"I don't consider\nthat unreasonable.\" Wright further testified:\n\n            \"... I told Coach Jett that I felt that Dr. Todd was only\n            carrying out his responsibilities as principal and that\n            those were the kinds of things I expected him to do and\n            that if, you know, if he was being unreasonable that was\n            one thing but as far as the actual accountability of\n            expecting an accounting for money and requiring him not\n            make unauthorized purchases and requiring him to attend\n            faculty meetings or requiring he have lesson plans, all\n            of those were in the area of expectation of the teacher\n            or Coach or any other employee in that building.\"\n\n            Wright further testified:\n\n            \"Q. (By Mr. Townend) In your first conference did Mr.\n            Jett suggest to you that Dr. Todd be transferred?\n\n            A. Yes, sir, he did. He felt that Mr. McWhorter had been\n            unsuccessful and had been transferred and that he had\n            such a successful record that he felt that Dr. Todd was\n            the one in error. That is when I came to the conclusion\n            that there were differences that were not resolvable and\n            I told Coach Jett at the time that if I have to make a\n            decision between the principal and the coach it is\n            obvious that the principal is responsible for the school\n            and would be the one to stay unless he was in error\n            himself and I hadn't found anywhere where Dr. Todd was in\n            error.\" (Emphasis added).\n\fthat is unfortunate that happens a lot of time between two people\n\nand when it occurs someone has to give and I have to make that\n\njudgment decision as to who has to go and in this case it was coach\n\nJett.\"     This is not inconsistent with Wright's testimony (see note\n\n17) that he approved the Jett transfer because the differences were\n\nirreconcilable \"and I haven't found anywhere where Dr. Todd was in\n\nerror,\" and certainly does not support an inference that Wright\n\ngenerally approved transfer recommendations despite their being\n\nunconstitutionally motivated.        More significantly, such would be\n\ncontrary to the policies of the DISD board of trustees and there is\n\nnothing to suggest that they knew or can be assumed to have known\n\nthat Wright acted on such a basis.        As previously observed, there\n\nis no evidence of any other unconstitutionally motivated employee\n\ntransfer (or other personnel action) being taken or approved by\n\nWright.     This is a single incident case.\n\n         The evidence is simply not sufficient to support a finding\n\nthat Superintendent Wright possessed final policymaking authority\n\nin   the    area   of   employee   transfers.   Under   Texas   law   such\n\npolicymaking authority rested exclusively with the DISD board of\n\ntrustees, and there is no evidence they had delegated it to\n\nSuperintendent Wright.       Jett in substance argues for the kind of\n\n\"de facto final policymaking authority\" rejected in Praprotnik.\n\n485 U.S. at 129, 108 S.Ct. at 927.       Moreover, there is no evidence\n\nthat Superintendent Wright's decision in Jett's case either \"was\n\ncast in the form of a policy statement and expressly approved by\n\nthe\" DISD board or that \"a series of decisions by\" Wright in this\n\narea \"manifested a \"custom or usage' of which the\" DISD board \"must\n\fhave been aware.\"   Praprotnik, 485 U.S. at 130, 108 S.Ct. at 926-\n\n27.\n\n      Accordingly, the judgment against the DISD and in favor of\n\nJett is reversed and the cause is remanded with directions to enter\n\njudgment in favor of the DISD as respects all of Jett's claims\n\nagainst it.\n\n      REVERSED and REMANDED with DIRECTIONS\n\n                              . . . . .\n\n\n\n                              . . . . .\n\n\n\n                              . . . . .\n\n\n\n                              . . . . .\n\f</pre>",
