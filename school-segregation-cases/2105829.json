No. 93-D-479)\n\n\nSubmitted on the briefs:\n\nVincent C. Todd, Lakewood, Colorado, for Plaintiff-Appellee.\n\nKen Salazar, Attorney General, Grace A. Belsches, Special Assistant Attorney\nGeneral, Denver, Colorado, for Defendants-Appellants.\n\fBefore PORFILIO , McKAY , and LUCERO , Circuit Judges.\n\n\nPORFILIO , Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n      Defendants George E. Sullivan and H.B. Johnson appeal from the district\n\ncourt’s judgment following trial to the court in favor of plaintiff Akeem Abdul\n\nMakin on his 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim for violation of his First Amendment right\n\nto exercise his religion while incarcerated in the Colorado prison system. We\n\nagree with the district court that defendants violated Mr. Makin’s rights, but\n\nconclude that the court improperly determined the amount of damages awarded to\n\nhim. We therefore affirm the judgment on liability, but vacate the damages award\n\nand remand for further proceedings.   1\n\n\n\n                                          I\n\n      In 1993 and 1994, Mr. Makin was incarcerated under the jurisdiction of the\n\nColorado Department of Corrections, confined in 1993 at the Colorado Territorial\n\nCorrectional Facility and in 1994 at the Colorado State Penitentiary. He is a\n\nfollower of Islam, and in both years wanted to observe the Muslim holy month of\n\n\n\n1\n      After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined\nunanimously to grant the parties’ request for a decision on the briefs without oral\nargument. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore\nordered submitted without oral argument.\n\n                                          -2-\n\fRamadan. Critical to the observance of Ramadan is the requirement that Muslims\n\nfast between dawn and sunset each day. Mr. Makin contended that defendants\n\nimproperly interfered with his ability to fast during Ramadan in 1993 and 1994,\n\nand brought this § 1983 action alleging that by doing so, they violated his First\n\nAmendment right to the free exercise of his religion. Prior to trial, the district\n\ncourt dismissed all defendants except Messrs. Sullivan, Johnson and Gasko. In\n\n1993, Mr. Sullivan was the deputy director of operations for the Department of\n\nCorrections, and Mr. Johnson was the superintendent of the Colorado Territorial\n\nCorrectional Facility and Mr. Sullivan’s subordinate. Mr. Gasko replaced Mr.\n\nSullivan as deputy director in 1994. Following a trial to the court, the court held\n\nthat Mr. Makin’s rights had been violated in 1993 but not in 1994, and it found\n\nMessrs. Sullivan and Johnson liable for the 1993 violation. Because Mr. Makin\n\ndoes not cross-appeal the district court’s conclusion there was no violation in\n\n1994, we focus only on activities relating to Ramadan in 1993.\n\n      As part of the settlement agreement resolving a lawsuit alleging that the\n\nDepartment of Corrections was inattentive to the needs of its Muslim inmates, the\n\nDepartment hired Imam Mohammed Kharrubi to advise it on Islamic practices. In\n\nthis position, Imam Kharrubi worked with food service and security personnel to\n\narrange for provision of timely and nutritional meals to Muslim inmates\n\nparticipating in Ramadan--that is, meals provided between sunset and dawn that\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fwere nutritionally equivalent to the three meals provided each day at the regular\n\ntimes. Department policy with respect to Ramadan stated that “‘[i]nmates\n\nparticipating in the fast of Ramadan shall be given the opportunity to receive at\n\nleast two hot meals during the time period between sunset and dawn for each . . .\n\nday of the fast.’” Appellants’ App. Vol. II at 247 (quoting exhibit 32).   2\n                                                                               A\n\nFebruary 19, 1993 memo to the kitchen staff at the Territorial Correctional\n\nFacility explained meal procedures to be generally followed during Ramadan that\n\nyear:\n\n              “The observance of the Islamic month of Ramadan is\n        scheduled this year from February 23rd through March 24, 1993.\n        Muslims must fast from . . . two hours prior to sunrise until after\n        sunset during the entire month. Those inmates participating will be\n        escorted by security to the north dining hall for breakfast at 4 a.m.\n        Supper is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. also in the north dining hall.”\n\nId. Vol. I at 33 (quoting exhibit A7). By memorandum dated February 1, 1993,\n\nMr. Sullivan directed that the general meal procedures would not apply to inmates\n\nin segregation. The memo stated that “[d]uring the month of Ramadan inmates in\n\nsegregation will be unable to participate in special feeding activities. Regular\n\nmeals with alternative meatless entrees will be made available through the usual\n\nmeal delivery system.”    Id. at 34. Mr. Johnson implemented the directive at the\n\n\n\n2\n       None of the parties submitted copies of the trial exhibits to this court with\nthe record on appeal. To the extent we can refer to them at all, we rely on\nquotations and references contained in the trial transcript or district court orders.\n\n                                            -4-\n\fTerritorial Correctional Facility. Prisoners in segregation ate their meals in their\n\ncells, and the “usual meal delivery system” made meals available to prisoners in\n\nsegregation only during the period after dawn and prior to sunset.\n\n       During Ramadan in 1993, Mr. Makin was housed in punitive segregation\n\nfor possession of dangerous contraband. To maintain his fast, he was unable to\n\neat his meals when delivered. He was able to keep his meal trays in his cell until\n\nafter sundown and eat what he could then. That included his supper and food\n\nsuch as dry cereal and crackers that he saved from lunch and breakfast;   3\n                                                                              he also\n\ncould keep cereal and crackers in his cell overnight to eat before dawn. Mr.\n\nMakin was able to maintain his fast for the entire month, although he contended\n\nthat it was extremely difficult to do that and that, as a result, he was unable to\n\nenjoy the full spiritual experience of Ramadan.\n\n       Applying the standards relevant to the alleged denial of a prisoner’s\n\nfundamental constitutional rights,    see Turner v. Safley , 482 U.S. 78, 89-90\n\n(1987), O’Lone v. Estate of Shabazz    , 482 U.S. 342, 348-50 (1987), the district\n\ncourt concluded that defendants Sullivan and Johnson had violated Mr. Makin’s\n\nFirst Amendment right to the free exercise of his religion. It computed damages\n\nfor denial of this right on a per diem basis of $300 or $9,000 for the entire month\n\n\n3\n       Mr. Makin testified that the temperature in the segregated cells was very\nhigh, 75 to 80 degrees, and he could not save other food items from breakfast or\nlunch because they would spoil. There was no contradictory testimony.\n\n                                           -5-\n\fof Ramadan, assessed jointly and severally against defendants. On appeal,\n\ndefendants challenge the district court’s ruling on three grounds: (1) the court\n\nerred in rejecting their defense of qualified immunity; (2) the denial of special\n\nmeal accommodations during Ramadan did not violate Mr. Makin’s First\n\nAmendment rights; and (3) the court’s determination of damages was incorrect.\n\n                                             II\n\n       Even though they are incarcerated, prisoners retain fundamental\n\nconstitutional rights.   See Turner , 482 U.S. at 84. These rights include the\n\nreasonable opportunity to pursue one’s religion as guaranteed by the free exercise\n\nclause of the First Amendment.      See Shabazz , 482 U.S. at 348;   Mosier v.\n\nMaynard , 937 F.2d 1521, 1525 (10th Cir. 1991). However, because of the\n\ninherent difficulties and concerns in running a prison, “what constitutes a\n\nreasonable opportunity must be evaluated with reference to legitimate penological\n\nobjectives of the prison.”    Id. Thus, the standard for reviewing the validity of a\n\nprison regulation or policy affecting a prisoner’s fundamental constitutional right,\n\nsuch as the free exercise of his or her religion, is this: “when a prison regulation\n\nimpinges on inmates’ constitutional rights, the regulation is valid if it is\n\nreasonably related to legitimate penological interests.”    Turner , 482 U.S. at 89.\n\nThis reasonableness inquiry considers several factors: (1) whether there exists a\n\nrational connection between the prison policy or regulation and a legitimate\n\n\n                                             -6-\n\fgovernmental interest advanced as its justification; (2) whether there are\n\nalternative means of exercising the right notwithstanding the policy or regulation;\n\n(3) what effect accommodating the exercise of the right would have on guards,\n\nother prisoners, and prison resources generally; and (4) whether there are ready,\n\neasy-to-implement alternatives that would accommodate the prisoner’s rights.      See\n\nid. at 89-91; Mosier , 937 F.2d at 1525. Like the district court, we assess the\n\nparties’ contentions within this framework.\n\n                              A. Qualified Immunity\n\n      As a preliminary matter, defendants contend that the district court erred in\n\ndenying their claim that they were qualifiedly immune from liability for any\n\nimproper infringement on Mr. Makin’s right to freely exercise his religion. “The\n\ndoctrine of qualified immunity provides that ‘[w]hen government officials are\n\nperforming discretionary functions, they will not be held liable for their conduct\n\nunless their actions violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of\n\nwhich a reasonable person would have known.’”       Mitchell v. Maynard , 80 F.3d\n\n1433, 1447 (10th Cir. 1996) (quoting    Pueblo Neighborhood Health Centers, Inc.\n\nv. Losavio , 847 F.2d 642, 645 (10th Cir.1988) (further quotation omitted)).\n\nDefendants contend they are entitled to qualified immunity because at the time of\n\nthe relevant events, there was no clearly established law, that is, Supreme Court\n\nor Tenth Circuit authority, “which sets forth the parameters of special feeding\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\faccommodation for the celebration of Ramadan in the prison setting especially for\n\nthose inmates whose own voluntary behavior landed them in segregation.”\n\nAppellants’ Br. at 15.\n\n       Defendants first raised this issue in a motion for summary judgment that\n\nwas referred to a magistrate judge. The magistrate judge issued a report\n\nrecommending that the motion be denied:\n\n              The current record does not support the defendants’ claim of\n       qualified immunity. Mr. Makin’s right to reasonable access to his\n       religiously required diet was clearly established at the time of the\n       violations alleged in his complaint. The defendants’ motion for\n       summary judgment does not address the question of whether the\n       restrictions placed on Mr. Makin’s religious diet were reasonable\n       under the Turner standard. Therefore, summary judgment cannot be\n       granted on that basis.\n\nAppellants’ App. Vol. I at 11. Defendants did not object to the recommendation,\n\nand the district court accepted it.   See id. at 16. Defendants re-raised the issue of\n\nqualified immunity at trial. Noting that defendants had not objected to the\n\nmagistrate judge’s recommendation and that the court had earlier adopted it, the\n\ncourt determined that the recommendation stood as law of the case and would not\n\nreconsider it.\n\n       Defendants contend that the district court erred in ruling that the qualified\n\nimmunity determination was law of the case not subject to further consideration at\n\nthe time of trial. Without citing authority, they contend that the failure to file\n\nwritten objections to a magistrate judge’s recommendation based on an erroneous\n\n                                            -8-\n\fdetermination of the law, as opposed to an erroneous determination of fact, does\n\nnot bar subsequent review by either the district court or, anticipating a potential\n\nwaiver problem on appeal, this court. They contend the error of law was the\n\n“Magistrate’s ruling the law was clearly established requiring prison officials to\n\nprovide special feeding accommodation for the Ramadan fast on the grounds that\n\nreligious diet must be accommodated.” Appellants’ Br. at 12.\n\n       Regardless of whether defendants’ failure to object to the magistrate\n\njudge’s recommendation made the court’s adoption of that recommendation law\n\nof the case in a technical sense, their failure to object precludes our consideration\n\nof their qualified immunity argument on appeal. The magistrate judge’s\n\nrecommendation effectively involved two legal determinations--that the relevant\n\nlegal issue was Mr. Makin’s “right to reasonable access to his religiously required\n\ndiet” and that that right was clearly established at the time of the violations\n\nalleged in his complaint.   See Romero v. Fay , 45 F.3d 1472, 1475 (10th Cir.1995).\n\nBut contrary to defendants’ unsupported contention, the failure to object to a\n\nmagistrate judge’s recommendation “waives appellate review of both factual        and\n\nlegal questions,” Moore v. United States , 950 F.2d 656, 659 (10th Cir. 1991)\n\n(emphasis added), absent other considerations not applicable here. The fact that\n\nthe magistrate judge’s recommendation also concluded there were unresolved\n\nfactual issues precluding summary judgment does not detract from its legal\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fdeterminations nor relieve defendants of their obligation to object to those\n\ndeterminations to preserve their right to appellate review. We therefore will not\n\nconsider defendants’ qualified immunity argument.    4\n\n\n\n                    B. Violation of First Amendment Rights\n\n      Defendants next challenge the district court’s determination that the denial\n\nof special meal accommodations during Ramadan violated Mr. Makin’s First\n\nAmendment rights. Their argument takes two tracks. First, they argue that there\n\nwas no violation because Mr. Makin was able to fast for the entire month of\n\nRamadan despite their failure to deliver his meals at times when he could eat.\n\nSecond, they contend that any infringement on his rights was justified by\n\nlegitimate penological interests in deterrence of improper conduct, rehabilitation,\n\nprison security, and budgetary considerations. We review the district court’s\n\n\n4\n        Moreover, even were we to consider this argument on the merits, we would\nfind it unpersuasive. They frame the inquiry into the right that must be clearly\nestablished--“the parameters of special feeding accommodation for the celebration\nof Ramadan”--much too narrowly.           See LaBounty v. Coughlin , 137 F.3d 68, 73-74\n(2d Cir. 1998); Melton v. City of Okla. City , 879 F.2d 706, 729 n.37 (10th Cir.\n1989) (“[S]tructuring the inquiry [into what right must be clearly established] too\nnarrowly would render the defense [of qualified immunity] available to all public\nofficials except in those rare cases in which a precedential case existed which was\n‘on all fours’ factually with the case at bar.”) (quotation omitted),   modified in\npart on other grounds on reh’g , 928 F.2d 920 (10th Cir. 1991) (en banc). The\ngeneral right to the reasonable opportunity to exercise one’s religion, clearly\nestablished, e.g., by Turner, Shabazz , and Mosier , best encompasses the alleged\nconduct. Cf. LaFevers v. Saffle , 936 F.2d 1117, 1119 (10th Cir. 1991)\n(recognizing constitutional protection for dietary restrictions based on religious\nbeliefs).\n\n                                         -10-\n\ffactual findings underlying its reasonableness determination for clear error,         see,\n\ne.g. , Grimsley v. MacKay , 93 F.3d 676, 679 (10th Cir. 1996), but our review of\n\nthe ultimate reasonableness inquiry is de novo,     see Mosier , 937 F.2d at 1525.\n\n       Before addressing defendants’ specific arguments, we must note the limited\n\nbreadth of the issue presented for review. That issue,     as defined by defendants , is\n\nwhether they improperly infringed on Mr. Makin’s right to exercise his right to\n\nobserve Ramadan in 1993. It is not the broader issue of whether their actions\n\nimproperly infringed on his right to exercise his belief in Islam in a more general\n\nsense, as was the case, for example, in    Shabazz . See 482 U.S. at 352.    5\n                                                                                 By\n\nlimiting our focus to the observance of Ramadan, however, we do not mean to\n\ndiminish the significance of Ramadan as part of the Five Pillars of Islam.            See,\n\ne.g. , Appellants’ App. Vol. II at 20-21, 30, 63.\n\n\n\n\n5\n        In Shabazz , Muslim prisoners challenged regulations restricting their ability\nto attend a congregational service called Jumu’ah. In its analysis, the Court said\n“we think it appropriate to see whether under these regulations [the prisoners]\nretain the ability to participate in other Muslim religious ceremonies,” including\nRamadan. 482 U.S. at 352. After noting the prisoners did retain that ability, the\nCourt concluded that “this ability on the part of [the prisoners] to participate in\nother religious observances of their faith supports the conclusion that the\nrestrictions at issue here were reasonable.”   Id. We note that the record on appeal\nin this case says little about any other Islamic observances or practices in which\nMr. Makin was able to participate.\n\n                                            -11-\n\f       The district court rejected defendants’ argument that the fact that Mr.\n\nMakin was able to fast the entire month of Ramadan absolved them of any\n\nliability their restrictions on meal service may have warranted:\n\n       Although Mr. Makin was able to engage in the fast through personal\n       sacrifice by the act of simply not eating his breakfast or lunch and\n       trying to save food from his dinner tray to eat after sundown, it is\n       clear to this Court that the qualitative spiritual experience that was\n       eloquently described by Mr. Makin, and which was corroborated by\n       the testimony of the Islamic coordinator, was substantially\n       diminished by the regulations in place.\n\nAppellants’ App. Vol. I at 39-40. Although defendants’ argument could be\n\nviewed as relating to the   Turner factor regarding alternative means of exercising\n\nthe right, their argument appears to go to the more fundamental proposition that\n\nMr. Makin’s rights were not infringed at all. As did the district court, we address\n\nthe argument in that posture.\n\n       At trial, Imam Kharrubi explained the religious experience of Ramadan as\n\nfollows:\n\n       The month of Ramadan is a special season. Muslims believe that\n       during that month there are more angels around. Rewards are\n       multiplied, and sins are multiplied as well. So we--we are highly\n       encouraged by these perceptions, of course, by the practice within\n       our community to avoid all kinds of sins, gossip, backbiting, and all\n       the other bad things. And, of course, maximize our good behavior\n       and good practices.\n\n       And it’s basically a special season to maximize spirituality, getting\n       closer to God. Blessings is much easier to receive in Ramadan than\n       otherwise.\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\f      ....\n\n      . . . Islam emphasizes discipline, and it’s through discipline and\n      through adherence to these practices that you would grow spiritually.\n      This growth that’s gained through the practice itself is . . . something\n      similar to the word zakat, which is charity, the third pillar of Islam.\n      And basically, when you give in charity, you gain purification of\n      your soul. When you practice--when you pray, when you fast, when\n      you do all the other good deeds that you’re required to do, that’s\n      when you get spiritual growth and purification.\n\n      If . . . somebody practices fasting, they would get a blessing from\n      God. And through the practice of that self-discipline, they would get\n      purification as well.\n\n      If a person was not allowed to fast or if a person was not in the\n      position, was not able to fast, then with still through their intention\n      wanted to fast but could not, would get a blessing from God, but\n      would miss out on the purification or the growth that would be\n      received through the actual practice itself.\n\nAppellants’ App. Vol. II at 64-66. Mr. Makin further explained the beneficial\n\nexperience of Ramadan, and the negative effect of defendants’ restrictions on\n\nmeal service and his opposition to those restrictions, as follow:\n\n      That I would ordinarily attain [during Ramadan] would be a state of\n      peace of mind, a state of knowing and feeling that everybody\n      throughout the year that has not had food, they are also feeling the\n      pains that I’m also feeling. And it is our way of getting in touch\n      with the inner forces within us.\n\n      ....\n\n      . . .Within the month of Ramadan, that I supposed to be within a\n      peaceful state of mind. I do not supposed to engage in war,\n      arguments or nothing like that. When I’m placed within a position to\n      where I’m now must engage within this [complaints to prison\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\f      authorities regarding meal accommodations], all right, that my nice,\n      peaceful aura is now broken. . . .\n\n      ....\n\n      [as to physical deprivation] It was horrible. It’s standing around\n      sweating, being in bed sweating, It’s--during Ramadan you’re going\n      to encounter, you know, the urge to eat. You’re going to feel hungry.\n      Compound that on with having extremely hot [he testified the cells\n      were very hot], and you’re also engaged within this close\n      confinement and also engaged in combativeness to trying to get it so\n      that you can at least eat right.\n\nId. at 30-32.\n\n      As noted above, the district court relied on this testimony in finding an\n\ninfringement on Mr. Makin’s right to freely exercise his religion because\n\ndefendants actions substantially diminished his qualitative spiritual experience.\n\nDefendants essentially argue that the burden they placed on Mr. Makin’s ability to\n\nfast during Ramadan should be ignored because he overcame that burden and did\n\nfast. We reject this argument for several reasons. First, it is founded on the\n\nunacceptable notion that prison authorities may burden the observance of\n\nreligious practices for no legitimate reason at all. Second, it makes the question\n\nof the legitimacy of government action dependent on the personal strength of the\n\nindividual affected.\n\n      Third, and what the district court found most important, it ignores the\n\nreligious experiential aspects of Ramadan beyond the fasting itself. There is no\n\nquestion, as the district court found based on undisputed evidence, that Mr. Makin\n\n                                        -14-\n\fsincerely holds his religious beliefs.     See generally Mosier , 937 F.2d at 1526-27\n\n(discussing requirement that religious beliefs be sincerely held to be protected).\n\nShould defendants be implicitly inviting us to question the validity or importance\n\nof these other aspects of Ramadan as described by Mr. Makin (and Imam\n\nKharrubi), we heartily reject their invitation.       See, e.g. , Employment Division v.\n\nSmith , 494 U.S. 872, 887 (1990) (“Repeatedly and in many different contexts, we\n\nhave warned that courts must not presume to determine the place of a particular\n\nbelief in a religion or the plausibility of a religious claim.”);       Hernandez v.\n\nCommissioner , 490 U.S. 680, 699 (1989) (“It is not within the judicial ken to\n\nquestion the centrality of particular beliefs or practices to a faith, or the validity\n\nof particular litigants’ interpretations of those creeds.”);        United States v. Seeger ,\n\n380 U.S. 163, 184-85 (1965) (“Religious experiences which are as real as life to\n\nsome may be incomprehensible to others. . . . [A court’s] task is to decide whether\n\nthe beliefs professed by [an individual] are sincerely held and whether they are, in\n\nhis own scheme of things, religious.”) (quotation omitted).\n\n       As the testimony by Imam Kharrubi and Mr. Makin demonstrated, and the\n\ndistrict court held, the burden defendants placed on Mr. Makin diminished the\n\nspiritual experience he otherwise could gain through Ramadan. This is sufficient\n\nto constitute an infringement on his right to freely exercise his religion. A\n\ncomplete denial of the ability to observe a religious practice is not required to\n\n\n                                              -15-\n\fdemonstrate an infringement, though the fact that a spiritual experience was only\n\ndiminished rather than denied may factor into the strength of the penological\n\ninterests necessary to justify the infringement. We thus turn to defendants’\n\nargument that legitimate penological interests warranted their interference with\n\nMr. Makin’s rights.\n\n      Defendants contend that the Ramadan policy for inmates in segregation\n\nserved four governmental interests: deterrence, rehabilitation, security and\n\nbudget. Defendants argue generally that restricting a prisoner’s right to exercise\n\nhis religion while in punitive segregation “deter[s] inmates from behaving in a\n\nmanner which caused them to be placed in segregation.” Appellants’ Br. at 7.\n\nHowever, they cite neither evidence indicating that the policy had any deterrent or\n\nrehabilitative goal, nor authority supporting their implied contention that\n\nrestriction of religious freedom is a proper tool for deterring improper conduct.\n\nCf. Young v. Coughlin , 866 F.2d 567, 570 (2d Cir. 1989) (“It also was error to\n\nassume that prison officials were justified in limiting appellant’s free exercise\n\nrights simply because [he] was in disciplinary confinement.”). Moreover,\n\ndefendants ignore Mr. Sullivan’s testimony that deterrence and rehabilitation were\n\nnot considerations in promulgating the policy. As he explained:\n\n      The intent [of the policy] would not have been rehabilitation or\n      deterrence. The intent would have been to simply meet the\n      operational security needs of the prison with the limited staff we had\n      available. We just simply didn’t have the staff available and the\n\n                                         -16-\n\f       resources available to accommodate the program for those inmates in\n       segregation.\n\n              There was no processing of goals and objectives of corrections\n       in terms of, is this rehabilitative or a deterrence effect? That was not\n       in the process. The process was very limited to the availability of\n       staff necessary to carry out the program.\n\nAppellants’ App. Vol. II at 91.\n\n       Mr. Sullivan’s testimony does support the general idea that the policy\n\nserved the related interests of security and budgetary considerations, but he did\n\nnot further elaborate on these interests, and the record does not contain other\n\nevidence of their relevance or applicability. Based on Mr. Johnson’s testimony\n\nthat the security and budgetary impact of accommodating Mr. Makin in\n\nsegregation would have been minimal, the district court found the security and\n\nbudgetary interests to be nonexistent.   6\n                                             Defendants contend that the district court\n\n\n6\n       The court based its finding primarily on its questioning of Mr. Johnson on\nthis point as follows:\n\n              THE COURT: . . . Let’s assume that instead of being told that\n       inmates in segregation would be unable to participate in special\n       feeding activities, you were told they would be allowed to participate\n       in special feeding activities, how would you have accommodated that\n       directive?\n\n             THE WITNESS: I would have realigned the staff. I would\n       have made special provisions, as I did for Ramadan itself.\n\n              THE COURT: So could you have accommodated that request\n       so that inmates--\n                                                               (continued...)\n\n                                             -17-\n\fimproperly dismissed budgetary concerns because the directive applied to all\n\nprisons and prisoners within the Department of Corrections system, not just\n\n\n\n6\n    (...continued)\n                THE WITNESS: Could I have accommodated it? Absolutely.\n\n               THE COURT: Okay. How would you have done that?\n\n                 THE WITNESS: I would have probably brought in overtime\n         staff, and I would have taken--when we brought the inmates over to\n         the general mess hall, then I would have had staff pick up the food\n         from the general mess hall and deliver it to the administrative\n         segregation.\n\n               THE COURT: Okay. You’re talking about the inmates who\n         were taken at 4 a.m. for breakfast in the . . . general population, and\n         you would have taken a food tray back to the inmates in segregation.\n\n                THE WITNESS: Yes. And I would have taken it within the\n         time frames the same as we ran our other program.\n\n               THE COURT: Okay. And then in the evening, because the\n         policy specified that those who were in the general population would\n         have their dinner meal at 6:30 p.m., which would have been after\n         sundown, you would have done the same thing in the evening?\n\n               THE WITNESS: Yes, sir, I would have.\n\n                THE COURT: Okay. So really the only reason that you didn’t\n         do that for Mr. Makin was because you had gotten this directive from\n         Mr. Sullivan which said that inmates in segregation would be unable\n         to participate in special feeding activities. Is that what you are\n         saying?\n\n               THE WITNESS: Yes, sir.\n\nAppellants’ App. Vol. II at 183-84.\n\n                                           -18-\n\fTerritorial and Mr. Makin. However, as noted above, they presented no evidence\n\nof the budgetary or security impact of accommodating prisoners in segregation at\n\nthese other facilities. Given the evidence before the district court, its finding that\n\nthere were no legitimate budgetary and security interests behind the policy is not\n\nclearly erroneous.\n\n       We thus agree with the district court that the directive infringed on Mr.\n\nMakin’s right to exercise his religion and that defendants did not put forth any\n\nlegitimate penological interests to justify that infringement. Defendants therefore\n\ndenied Mr. Makin a reasonable opportunity to pursue his religion, and are liable\n\nfor damages under § 1983.\n\n                                       C. Damages\n\n       Defendants contend that should we agree with the district court that they\n\nviolated Mr. Makin’s constitutional rights, we should vacate the district court’s\n\ncompensatory damages award of $9,000 because Mr. Makin did not suffer any\n\nactual injury. They contend that only an award of $1 in nominal damages is\n\nappropriate. While we agree the district court improperly determined the amount\n\nof damages, we do not agree that Mr. Makin is entitled only to nominal damages.\n\n       Damages are available for violations of § 1983 “to compensate persons for\n\ninjuries caused by the deprivation of constitutional rights.”   Carey v. Piphus , 435\n\nU.S. 247, 254 (1978). A damages award must be based on actual injuries;        id. at\n\n\n                                            -19-\n\f264; “the abstract value of a constitutional right may not form the basis for\n\n§ 1983 damages.”    Memphis Community Sch. Dist. v. Stachura      , 477 U.S. 299, 308\n\n(1986).\n\n      The district court concluded that “[t]he best way that the Court can quantify\n\na damage figure is on a per diem basis,   i.e. , that a certain amount per day be\n\nawarded which represents what this Court believes to be a reasonable damage\n\naward to this Plaintiff who was   unconstitutionally denied his ability to freely\n\nexercise his religion for the month of Ramadan in 1993.” Appellants’ App. Vol. I\n\nat 42-43 (emphasis added). In doing so, the court incorrectly based its award on\n\nthe abstract value of the constitutional right rather than on the actual injuries Mr.\n\nMakin suffered from the denial of that right, and we must vacate its award. We\n\ndisagree with defendants, however, that there was no evidence of actual damages\n\nand that we must therefore impose nominal damages of only $1. Mr. Makin’s\n\ntestimony provides some evidence that he suffered mental or emotional distress as\n\na result of defendants’ actions for which he may recover.     See Carey , 435 U.S. at\n\n264. We leave for the district court’s determination on remand the amount of\n\ndamages, if any, the evidence supports.\n\n                                           III\n\n      In sum, we conclude that the district court correctly held that defendants’\n\nfailure to accommodate Mr. Makin’s meal requirements during Ramadan in 1993\n\n\n                                           -20-\n\fviolated his First Amendment right to freely exercise his religion, but that the\n\ndistrict court improperly determined the amount of damages. The judgment of the\n\ndistrict court in favor of Mr. Makin is therefore AFFIRMED in part, the award of\n\ndamages is VACATED, and the case is remanded to the district court for\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -21-\n\f",

Johnson appeal from the district court's judgment following trial to the court in favor of plaintiff Akeem Abdul Makin on his 42 U.S.C.  1983 claim for violation of his First Amendment right to exercise his religion while incarcerated in the Colorado prison system. We agree with the district court that defendants violated Mr. Makin's rights, but conclude that the court improperly determined the amount of damages awarded to him. We therefore affirm the judgment on liability, but vacate the damages award and remand for further proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* In 1993 and 1994, Mr. Makin was incarcerated under the jurisdiction of the Colorado Department of Corrections, confined in 1993 at the Colorado Territorial Correctional Facility and in 1994 at the Colorado State Penitentiary. He is a follower of Islam, and in both years wanted to observe the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Critical to the observance of Ramadan is the requirement that Muslims fast between dawn and sunset each day. Mr. Makin contended that defendants improperly interfered with his ability to fast during Ramadan in 1993 and 1994, and brought this  1983 action alleging that by doing so, they violated his First Amendment right to the free exercise of his religion. Prior to trial, the district court dismissed all defendants except Messrs. Sullivan, Johnson and Gasko. In 1993, Mr. Sullivan was the deputy director of operations for the Department of Corrections, and Mr. Johnson was the superintendent of the Colorado Territorial Correctional Facility and Mr. Sullivan's subordinate. Mr. Gasko replaced Mr. Sullivan as deputy director in 1994. Following a trial to the court, the court held that Mr. Makin's rights had been violated in 1993 but not in 1994, and it found Messrs. Sullivan and Johnson liable for the 1993 violation. Because Mr. Makin does not cross-appeal the district court's conclusion there was no violation in 1994, we focus only on activities relating to Ramadan in 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part of the settlement agreement resolving a lawsuit alleging that the Department of Corrections was inattentive to the needs of its Muslim inmates, the Department hired Imam Mohammed Kharrubi to advise it on Islamic practices. In this position, Imam Kharrubi worked with food service and security personnel to arrange for provision of timely and nutritional meals to Muslim inmates participating in Ramadan--that is, meals provided between sunset and dawn that were nutritionally equivalent to the three meals provided each day at the regular times. Department policy with respect to Ramadan stated that \"'[i]nmates participating in the fast of Ramadan shall be given the opportunity to receive at least two hot meals during the time period between sunset and dawn for each . . . day of the fast.'\" Appellants' App. Vol. II at 247 (quoting exhibit 32).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> A February 19, 1993 memo to the kitchen staff at the Territorial Correctional Facility explained meal procedures to be generally followed during Ramadan that year:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The observance of the Islamic month of Ramadan is scheduled this year from February 23rd through March 24, 1993. Muslims must fast from . . . two hours prior to sunrise until after sunset during the entire month. Those inmates participating will be escorted by security to the north dining hall for breakfast at 4 a.m. Supper is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. also in the north dining hall.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. Vol. I at 33 (quoting exhibit A7). By memorandum dated February 1, 1993, Mr. Sullivan directed that the general meal procedures would not apply to inmates in segregation. The memo stated that \"[d]uring the month of Ramadan inmates in segregation will be unable to participate in special feeding activities. Regular meals with alternative meatless entrees will be made available through the usual meal delivery system.\" Id. at 34. Mr. Johnson implemented the directive at the Territorial Correctional Facility. Prisoners in segregation ate their meals in their cells, and the \"usual meal delivery system\" made meals available to prisoners in segregation only during the period after dawn and prior to sunset.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During Ramadan in 1993, Mr. Makin was housed in punitive segregation for possession of dangerous contraband. To maintain his fast, he was unable to eat his meals when delivered. He was able to keep his meal trays in his cell until after sundown and eat what he could then. That included his supper and food such as dry cereal and crackers that he saved from lunch and breakfast;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> he also could keep cereal and crackers in his cell overnight to eat before dawn. Mr. Makin was able to maintain his fast for the entire month, although he contended that it was extremely difficult to do that and that, as a result, he was unable to enjoy the full spiritual experience of Ramadan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the standards relevant to the alleged denial of a prisoner's fundamental constitutional rights, see Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89-90 (1987), O'Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U.S. 342, 348-50 (1987), the district court concluded that defendants Sullivan and Johnson had violated Mr. Makin's First Amendment right to the free exercise of his religion. It computed damages for denial of this right on a per diem basis of $300 or $9,000 for the entire month of Ramadan, assessed jointly and severally against defendants. On appeal, defendants challenge the district court's ruling on three grounds: (1) the court erred in rejecting their defense of qualified immunity; (2) the denial of special meal accommodations during Ramadan did not violate Mr. Makin's First Amendment rights; and (3) the court's determination of damages was incorrect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though they are incarcerated, prisoners retain fundamental constitutional rights. See Turner, 482 U.S. at 84. These rights include the reasonable opportunity to pursue one's religion as guaranteed by the free exercise clause of the First Amendment. See Shabazz, 482 U.S. at 348; Mosier v. Maynard, 937 F.2d 1521, 1525 (10th Cir. 1991). However, because of the inherent difficulties and concerns in running a prison, \"what constitutes a reasonable opportunity must be evaluated with reference to legitimate penological objectives of the prison.\" Id. Thus, the standard for reviewing the validity of a prison regulation or policy affecting a prisoner's fundamental constitutional right, such as the free exercise of his or her religion, is this: \"when a prison regulation impinges on inmates' constitutional rights, the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.\" Turner, 482 U.S. at 89. This reasonableness inquiry considers several factors: (1) whether there exists a rational connection between the prison policy or regulation and a legitimate governmental interest advanced as its justification; (2) whether there are alternative means of exercising the right notwithstanding the policy or regulation; (3) what effect accommodating the exercise of the right would have on guards, other prisoners, and prison resources generally; and (4) whether there are ready, easy-to-implement alternatives that would accommodate the prisoner's rights. See id. at 89-91; Mosier, 937 F.2d at 1525. Like the district court, we assess the parties' contentions within this framework.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Qualified Immunity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a preliminary matter, defendants contend that the district court erred in denying their claim that they were qualifiedly immune from liability for any improper infringement on Mr. Makin's right to freely exercise his religion. \"The doctrine of qualified immunity provides that '[w]hen government officials are performing discretionary functions, they will not be held liable for their conduct unless their actions violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.'\" Mitchell v. Maynard, 80 F.3d 1433, 1447 (10th Cir. 1996) (quoting Pueblo Neighborhood Health Centers, Inc. v. Losavio, 847 F.2d 642, 645 (10th Cir.1988) (further quotation omitted)). Defendants contend they are entitled to qualified immunity because at the time of the relevant events, there was no clearly established law, that is, Supreme Court or Tenth Circuit authority, \"which sets forth the parameters of special feeding accommodation for the celebration of Ramadan in the prison setting especially for those inmates whose own voluntary behavior landed them in segregation.\" Appellants' Br. at 15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants first raised this issue in a motion for summary judgment that was referred to a magistrate judge. The magistrate judge issued a report recommending that the motion be denied:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The current record does not support the defendants' claim of qualified immunity. Mr. Makin's right to reasonable access to his religiously required diet was clearly established at the time of the violations alleged in his complaint. The defendants' motion for summary judgment does not address the question of whether the restrictions placed on Mr. Makin's religious diet were reasonable under the Turner standard. Therefore, summary judgment cannot be granted on that basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' App. Vol. I at 11. Defendants did not object to the recommendation, and the district court accepted it. See id. at 16. Defendants re-raised the issue of qualified immunity at trial. Noting that defendants had not objected to the magistrate judge's recommendation and that the court had earlier adopted it, the court determined that the recommendation stood as law of the case and would not reconsider it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants contend that the district court erred in ruling that the qualified immunity determination was law of the case not subject to further consideration at the time of trial. Without citing authority, they contend that the failure to file written objections to a magistrate judge's recommendation based on an erroneous determination of the law, as opposed to an erroneous determination of fact, does not bar subsequent review by either the district court or, anticipating a potential waiver problem on appeal, this court. They contend the error of law was the \"Magistrate's ruling the law was clearly established requiring prison officials to provide special feeding accommodation for the Ramadan fast on the grounds that religious diet must be accommodated.\" Appellants' Br. at 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regardless of whether defendants' failure to object to the magistrate judge's recommendation made the court's adoption of that recommendation law of the case in a technical sense, their failure to object precludes our consideration of their qualified immunity argument on appeal. The magistrate judge's recommendation effectively involved two legal determinations--that the relevant legal issue was Mr. Makin's \"right to reasonable access to his religiously required diet\" and that that right was clearly established at the time of the violations alleged in his complaint. See Romero v. Fay, 45 F.3d 1472, 1475 (10th Cir.1995). But contrary to defendants' unsupported contention, the failure to object to a magistrate judge's recommendation \"waives appellate review of both factual and legal questions,\" Moore v. United States, 950 F.2d 656, 659 (10th Cir. 1991) (emphasis added), absent other considerations not applicable here. The fact that the magistrate judge's recommendation also concluded there were unresolved factual issues precluding summary judgment does not detract from its legal determinations nor relieve defendants of their obligation to object to those determinations to preserve their right to appellate review. We therefore will not consider defendants' qualified immunity argument.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Violation of First Amendment Rights</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants next challenge the district court's determination that the denial of special meal accommodations during Ramadan violated Mr. Makin's First Amendment rights. Their argument takes two tracks. First, they argue that there was no violation because Mr. Makin was able to fast for the entire month of Ramadan despite their failure to deliver his meals at times when he could eat. Second, they contend that any infringement on his rights was justified by legitimate penological interests in deterrence of improper conduct, rehabilitation, prison security, and budgetary considerations. We review the district court's factual findings underlying its reasonableness determination for clear error, see, e.g., Grimsley v. MacKay, 93 F.3d 676, 679 (10th Cir. 1996), but our review of the ultimate reasonableness inquiry is de novo, see Mosier, 937 F.2d at 1525.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before addressing defendants' specific arguments, we must note the limited breadth of the issue presented for review. That issue, as defined by defendants, is whether they improperly infringed on Mr. Makin's right to exercise his right to observe Ramadan in 1993. It is not the broader issue of whether their actions improperly infringed on his right to exercise his belief in Islam in a more general sense, as was the case, for example, in Shabazz. See 482 U.S. at 352.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> By limiting our focus to the observance of Ramadan, however, we do not mean to diminish the significance of Ramadan as part of the Five Pillars of Islam. See, e.g., Appellants' App. Vol. II at 20-21, 30, 63.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected defendants' argument that the fact that Mr. Makin was able to fast the entire month of Ramadan absolved them of any liability their restrictions on meal service may have warranted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Mr. Makin was able to engage in the fast through personal sacrifice by the act of simply not eating his breakfast or lunch and trying to save food from his dinner tray to eat after sundown, it is clear to this Court that the qualitative spiritual experience that was eloquently described by Mr. Makin, and which was corroborated by the testimony of the Islamic coordinator, was substantially diminished by the regulations in place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' App. Vol. I at 39-40. Although defendants' argument could be viewed as relating to the Turner factor regarding alternative means of exercising the right, their argument appears to go to the more fundamental proposition that Mr. Makin's rights were not infringed at all. As did the district court, we address the argument in that posture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Imam Kharrubi explained the religious experience of Ramadan as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The month of Ramadan is a special season. Muslims believe that during that month there are more angels around. Rewards are multiplied, and sins are multiplied as well. So we--we are highly encouraged by these perceptions, of course, by the practice within our community to avoid all kinds of sins, gossip, backbiting, and all the other bad things. And, of course, maximize our good behavior and good practices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And it's basically a special season to maximize spirituality, getting closer to God. Blessings is much easier to receive in Ramadan than otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . Islam emphasizes discipline, and it's through discipline and through adherence to these practices that you would grow spiritually. This growth that's gained through the practice itself is . . . something similar to the word zakat, which is charity, the third pillar of Islam. And basically, when you give in charity, you gain purification of your soul. When you practice--when you pray, when you fast, when you do all the other good deeds that you're required to do, that's when you get spiritual growth and purification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If . . . somebody practices fasting, they would get a blessing from God. And through the practice of that self-discipline, they would get purification as well. If a person was not allowed to fast or if a person was not in the position, was not able to fast, then with still through their intention wanted to fast but could not, would get a blessing from God, but would miss out on the purification or the growth that would be received through the actual practice itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' App. Vol. II at 64-66. Mr. Makin further explained the beneficial experience of Ramadan, and the negative effect of defendants' restrictions on meal service and his opposition to those restrictions, as follow:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That I would ordinarily attain [during Ramadan] would be a state of peace of mind, a state of knowing and feeling that everybody throughout the year that has not had food, they are also feeling the pains that I'm also feeling. And it is our way of getting in touch with the inner forces within us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . .Within the month of Ramadan, that I supposed to be within a peaceful state of mind. I do not supposed to engage in war, arguments or nothing like that. When I'm placed within a position to where I'm now must engage within this [complaints to prison authorities regarding meal accommodations], all right, that my nice, peaceful aura is now broken. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[as to physical deprivation] It was horrible. It's standing around sweating, being in bed sweating, It's--during Ramadan you're going to encounter, you know, the urge to eat. You're going to feel hungry. Compound that on with having extremely hot [he testified the cells were very hot], and you're also engaged within this close confinement and also engaged in combativeness to trying to get it so that you can at least eat right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 30-32.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted above, the district court relied on this testimony in finding an infringement on Mr. Makin's right to freely exercise his religion because defendants actions substantially diminished his qualitative spiritual experience. Defendants essentially argue that the burden they placed on Mr. Makin's ability to fast during Ramadan should be ignored because he overcame that burden and did fast. We reject this argument for several reasons. First, it is founded on the unacceptable notion that prison authorities may burden the observance of religious practices for no legitimate reason at all. Second, it makes the question of the legitimacy of government action dependent on the personal strength of the individual affected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, and what the district court found most important, it ignores the religious experiential aspects of Ramadan beyond the fasting itself. There is no question, as the district court found based on undisputed evidence, that Mr. Makin sincerely holds his religious beliefs. See generally Mosier, 937 F.2d at 1526-27 (discussing requirement that religious beliefs be sincerely held to be protected). Should defendants be implicitly inviting us to question the validity or importance of these other aspects of Ramadan as described by Mr. Makin (and Imam Kharrubi), we heartily reject their invitation. See, e.g., Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 887 (1990) (\"Repeatedly and in many different contexts, we have warned that courts must not presume to determine the place of a particular belief in a religion or the plausibility of a religious claim.\"); Hernandez v. Commissioner, 490 U.S. 680, 699 (1989) (\"It is not within the judicial ken to question the centrality of particular beliefs or practices to a faith, or the validity of particular litigants' interpretations of those creeds.\"); United States v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163, 184-85 (1965) (\"Religious experiences which are as real as life to some may be incomprehensible to others. . . . [A court's] task is to decide whether the beliefs professed by [an individual] are sincerely held and whether they are, in his own scheme of things, religious.\") (quotation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the testimony by Imam Kharrubi and Mr. Makin demonstrated, and the district court held, the burden defendants placed on Mr. Makin diminished the spiritual experience he otherwise could gain through Ramadan. This is sufficient to constitute an infringement on his right to freely exercise his religion. A complete denial of the ability to observe a religious practice is not required to demonstrate an infringement, though the fact that a spiritual experience was only diminished rather than denied may factor into the strength of the penological interests necessary to justify the infringement. We thus turn to defendants' argument that legitimate penological interests warranted their interference with Mr. Makin's rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants contend that the Ramadan policy for inmates in segregation served four governmental interests: deterrence, rehabilitation, security and budget. Defendants argue generally that restricting a prisoner's right to exercise his religion while in punitive segregation \"deter[s] inmates from behaving in a manner which caused them to be placed in segregation.\" Appellants' Br. at 7. However, they cite neither evidence indicating that the policy had any deterrent or rehabilitative goal, nor authority supporting their implied contention that restriction of religious freedom is a proper tool for deterring improper conduct. Cf. Young v. Coughlin, 866 F.2d 567, 570 (2d Cir. 1989) (\"It also was error to assume that prison officials were justified in limiting appellant's free exercise rights simply because [he] was in disciplinary confinement.\"). Moreover, defendants ignore Mr. Sullivan's testimony that deterrence and rehabilitation were not considerations in promulgating the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">As he explained:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The intent [of the policy] would not have been rehabilitation or deterrence. The intent would have been to simply meet the operational security needs of the prison with the limited staff we had available. We just simply didn't have the staff available and the resources available to accommodate the program for those inmates in segregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no processing of goals and objectives of corrections in terms of, is this rehabilitative or a deterrence effect? That was not in the process. The process was very limited to the availability of staff necessary to carry out the program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' App. Vol. II at 91.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Sullivan's testimony does support the general idea that the policy served the related interests of security and budgetary considerations, but he did not further elaborate on these interests, and the record does not contain other evidence of their relevance or applicability. Based on Mr. Johnson's testimony that the security and budgetary impact of accommodating Mr. Makin in segregation would have been minimal, the district court found the security and budgetary interests to be nonexistent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Defendants contend that the district court improperly dismissed budgetary concerns because the directive applied to all prisons and prisoners within the Department of Corrections system, not just Territorial and Mr. Makin. However, as noted above, they presented no evidence of the budgetary or security impact of accommodating prisoners in segregation at these other facilities. Given the evidence before the district court, its finding that there were no legitimate budgetary and security interests behind the policy is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We thus agree with the district court that the directive infringed on Mr. Makin's right to exercise his religion and that defendants did not put forth any legitimate penological interests to justify that infringement. Defendants therefore denied Mr. Makin a reasonable opportunity to pursue his religion, and are liable for damages under  1983.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Damages</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants contend that should we agree with the district court that they violated Mr. Makin's constitutional rights, we should vacate the district court's compensatory damages award of $9,000 because Mr. Makin did not suffer any actual injury. They contend that only an award of $1 in nominal damages is appropriate. While we agree the district court improperly determined the amount of damages, we do not agree that Mr. Makin is entitled only to nominal damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Damages are available for violations of  1983 \"to compensate persons for injuries caused by the deprivation of constitutional rights.\" Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247, 254 (1978). A damages award must be based on actual injuries; id. at 264; \"the abstract value of a constitutional right may not form the basis for  1983 damages.\" Memphis Community Sch. Dist. v. Stachura, 477 U.S. 299, 308 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that \"[t]he best way that the Court can quantify a damage figure is on a per diem basis, i.e., that a certain amount per day be awarded which represents what this Court believes to be a reasonable damage award to this Plaintiff who was unconstitutionally denied his ability to freely exercise his religion for the month of Ramadan in 1993.\" Appellants' App. Vol. I at 42-43 (emphasis added). In doing so, the court incorrectly based its award on the abstract value of the constitutional right rather than on the actual injuries Mr. Makin suffered from the denial of that right, and we must vacate its award. We disagree with defendants, however, that there was no evidence of actual damages and that we must therefore impose nominal damages of only $1. Mr. Makin's testimony provides some evidence that he suffered mental or emotional distress as a result of defendants' actions for which he may recover. See Carey, 435 U.S. at 264. We leave for the district court's determination on remand the amount of damages, if any, the evidence supports.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we conclude that the district court correctly held that defendants' failure to accommodate Mr. Makin's meal requirements during Ramadan in 1993 violated his First Amendment right to freely exercise his religion, but that the district court improperly determined the amount of damages. The judgment of the district court in favor of Mr. Makin is therefore AFFIRMED in part, the award of damages is VACATED, and the case is remanded to the district court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties' request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument.

They frame the inquiry into the right that must be clearly established--\"the parameters of special feeding accommodation for the celebration of Ramadan\"--much too narrowly. See LaBounty v. Coughlin, 137 F.3d 68, 73-74 (2d Cir. 1998); Melton v. City of Okla. City, 879 F.2d 706, 729 n.37 (10th Cir. 1989) (\"[S]tructuring the inquiry [into what right must be clearly established] too narrowly would render the defense [of qualified immunity] available to all public officials except in those rare cases in which a precedential case existed which was 'on all fours' factually with the case at bar.\") (quotation omitted), modified in part on other grounds on reh'g, 928 F.2d 920 (10th Cir. 1991) (en banc). The general right to the reasonable opportunity to exercise one's religion, clearly established, e.g., by Turner, Shabazz, and Mosier, best encompasses the alleged conduct. Cf. LaFevers v. Saffle, 936 F.2d 1117, 1119 (10th Cir. 1991) (recognizing constitutional protection for dietary restrictions based on religious beliefs).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> In Shabazz, Muslim prisoners challenged regulations restricting their ability to attend a congregational service called Jumu'ah. In its analysis, the Court said \"we think it appropriate to see whether under these regulations [the prisoners] retain the ability to participate in other Muslim religious ceremonies,\" including Ramadan. 482 U.S. at 352. After noting the prisoners did retain that ability, the Court concluded that \"this ability on the part of [the prisoners] to participate in other religious observances of their faith supports the conclusion that the restrictions at issue here were reasonable.\" Id. We note that the record on appeal in this case says little about any other Islamic observances or practices in which Mr. Makin was able to participate.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The court based its finding primarily on its questioning of Mr. Johnson on this point as follows:</p>\n        <p>THE COURT: . . . Let's assume that instead of being told that inmates in segregation would be unable to participate in special feeding activities, you were told they would be allowed to participate in special feeding activities, how would you have accommodated that directive?</p>\n        <p>THE WITNESS: I would have realigned the staff. I would have made special provisions, as I did for Ramadan itself.</p>\n        <p>THE COURT: So could you have accommodated that request so that inmates--</p>\n        <p>THE WITNESS: Could I have accommodated it? Absolutely.</p>\n        <p>THE COURT: Okay. How would you have done that?</p>\n        <p>THE WITNESS: I would have probably brought in overtime staff, and I would have taken--when we brought the inmates over to the general mess hall, then I would have had staff pick up the food from the general mess hall and deliver it to the administrative segregation.</p>\n        <p>THE COURT: Okay. You're talking about the inmates who were taken at 4 a.m. for breakfast in the . . . general population, and you would have taken a food tray back to the inmates in segregation.</p>\n        <p>THE WITNESS: Yes. And I would have taken it within the time frames the same as we ran our other program.</p>\n        <p>THE COURT: Okay. And then in the evening, because the policy specified that those who were in the general population would have their dinner meal at 6:30 p.m., which would have been after sundown, you would have done the same thing in the evening?</p>\n        <p>THE WITNESS: Yes, sir, I would have.</p>\n        <p>THE COURT: Okay. So really the only reason that you didn't do that for Mr. Makin was because you had gotten this directive from Mr. Sullivan which said that inmates in segregation would be unable to participate in special feeding activities. Is that what you are saying?</p>\n        <p>THE WITNESS: Yes, sir.</p>\n        <p>Appellants' App. Vol. II at 183-84.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Sullivan and H.B. Johnson appeal from the district court's judgment following trial to the court in favor of plaintiff Akeem Abdul Makin on his 42 U.S.C.  1983 claim for violation of his First Amendment right to exercise his religion while incarcerated in the Colorado prison system. We agree with the district court that defendants violated Mr. Makin's rights, but conclude that the court improperly determined the amount of damages awarded to him. We therefore affirm the judgment on liability, but vacate the damages award and remand for further proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* In 1993 and 1994, Mr. Makin was incarcerated under the jurisdiction of the Colorado Department of Corrections, confined in 1993 at the Colorado Territorial Correctional Facility and in 1994 at the Colorado State Penitentiary. He is a follower of Islam, and in both years wanted to observe the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Critical to the observance of Ramadan is the requirement that Muslims fast between dawn and sunset each day. Mr. Makin contended that defendants improperly interfered with his ability to fast during Ramadan in 1993 and 1994, and brought this  1983 action alleging that by doing so, they violated his First Amendment right to the free exercise of his religion. Prior to trial, the district court dismissed all defendants except Messrs. Sullivan, Johnson and Gasko. In 1993, Mr. Sullivan was the deputy director of operations for the Department of Corrections, and Mr. Johnson was the superintendent of the Colorado Territorial Correctional Facility and Mr. Sullivan's subordinate. Mr. Gasko replaced Mr. Sullivan as deputy director in 1994. Following a trial to the court, the court held that Mr. Makin's rights had been violated in 1993 but not in 1994, and it found Messrs. Sullivan and Johnson liable for the 1993 violation. Because Mr. Makin does not cross-appeal the district court's conclusion there was no violation in 1994, we focus only on activities relating to Ramadan in 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part of the settlement agreement resolving a lawsuit alleging that the Department of Corrections was inattentive to the needs of its Muslim inmates, the Department hired Imam Mohammed Kharrubi to advise it on Islamic practices. In this position, Imam Kharrubi worked with food service and security personnel to arrange for provision of timely and nutritional meals to Muslim inmates participating in Ramadan--that is, meals provided between sunset and dawn that were nutritionally equivalent to the three meals provided each day at the regular times. Department policy with respect to Ramadan stated that \"'[i]nmates participating in the fast of Ramadan shall be given the opportunity to receive at least two hot meals during the time period between sunset and dawn for each . . . day of the fast.'\" Appellants' App. Vol. II at 247 (quoting exhibit 32).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> A February 19, 1993 memo to the kitchen staff at the Territorial Correctional Facility explained meal procedures to be generally followed during Ramadan that year:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The observance of the Islamic month of Ramadan is scheduled this year from February 23rd through March 24, 1993. Muslims must fast from . . . two hours prior to sunrise until after sunset during the entire month.

Vol. I at 33 (quoting exhibit A7). By memorandum dated February 1, 1993, Mr. Sullivan directed that the general meal procedures would not apply to inmates in segregation. The memo stated that \"[d]uring the month of Ramadan inmates in segregation will be unable to participate in special feeding activities. Regular meals with alternative meatless entrees will be made available through the usual meal delivery system.\" Id. at 34. Mr. Johnson implemented the directive at the Territorial Correctional Facility. Prisoners in segregation ate their meals in their cells, and the \"usual meal delivery system\" made meals available to prisoners in segregation only during the period after dawn and prior to sunset.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During Ramadan in 1993, Mr. Makin was housed in punitive segregation for possession of dangerous contraband. To maintain his fast, he was unable to eat his meals when delivered. He was able to keep his meal trays in his cell until after sundown and eat what he could then. That included his supper and food such as dry cereal and crackers that he saved from lunch and breakfast;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> he also could keep cereal and crackers in his cell overnight to eat before dawn. Mr. Makin was able to maintain his fast for the entire month, although he contended that it was extremely difficult to do that and that, as a result, he was unable to enjoy the full spiritual experience of Ramadan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the standards relevant to the alleged denial of a prisoner's fundamental constitutional rights, see Turner v.

It computed damages for denial of this right on a per diem basis of $300 or $9,000 for the entire month of Ramadan, assessed jointly and severally against defendants. On appeal, defendants challenge the district court's ruling on three grounds: (1) the court erred in rejecting their defense of qualified immunity; (2) the denial of special meal accommodations during Ramadan did not violate Mr. Makin's First Amendment rights; and (3) the court's determination of damages was incorrect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though they are incarcerated, prisoners retain fundamental constitutional rights. See Turner, 482 U.S. at 84. These rights include the reasonable opportunity to pursue one's religion as guaranteed by the free exercise clause of the First Amendment. See Shabazz, 482 U.S. at 348; Mosier v. Maynard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564405\"><a href=\"/opinion/564405/cd-mosier-v-gary-maynard-doc-dan-reynolds-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">937</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1521</span></a></span>, 1525 (10th Cir. 1991). However, because of the inherent difficulties and concerns in running a prison, \"what constitutes a reasonable opportunity must be evaluated with reference to legitimate penological objectives of the prison.\" Id. Thus, the standard for reviewing the validity of a prison regulation or policy affecting a prisoner's fundamental constitutional right, such as the free exercise of his or her religion, is this: \"when a prison regulation impinges on inmates' constitutional rights, the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.\" Turner, 482 U.S. at 89. This reasonableness inquiry considers several factors: (1) whether there exists a rational connection between the prison policy or regulation and a legitimate governmental interest advanced as its justification; (2) whether there are alternative means of exercising the right notwithstanding the policy or regulation; (3) what effect accommodating the exercise of the right would have on guards, other prisoners, and prison resources generally; and (4) whether there are ready, easy-to-implement alternatives that would accommodate the prisoner's rights. See id. at 89-91; Mosier, 937 F.2d at 1525. Like the district court, we assess the parties' contentions within this framework.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Qualified Immunity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a preliminary matter, defendants contend that the district court erred in denying their claim that they were qualifiedly immune from liability for any improper infringement on Mr. Makin's right to freely exercise his religion. \"The doctrine of qualified immunity provides that '[w]hen government officials are performing discretionary functions, they will not be held liable for their conduct unless their actions violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.'\" Mitchell v. Maynard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"715843\"><a href=\"/opinion/715843/carl-demetrius-mitchell-v-gary-d-maynard-director-of-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1433</span></a></span>, 1447 (10th Cir. 1996) (quoting Pueblo Neighborhood Health Centers, Inc. v. Losavio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"506294\"><a href=\"/opinion/506294/medicaremedicaid-gu-37414-pueblo-neighborhood-health-centers-inc-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">642</span></a></span>, 645 (10th Cir.1988) (further quotation omitted)). Defendants contend they are entitled to qualified immunity because at the time of the relevant events, there was no clearly established law, that is, Supreme Court or Tenth Circuit authority, \"which sets forth the parameters of special feeding accommodation for the celebration of Ramadan in the prison setting especially for those inmates whose own voluntary behavior landed them in segregation.\" Appellants' Br. at 15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants first raised this issue in a motion for summary judgment that was referred to a magistrate judge. The magistrate judge issued a report recommending that the motion be denied:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The current record does not support the defendants' claim of qualified immunity. Mr. Makin's right to reasonable access to his religiously required diet was clearly established at the time of the violations alleged in his complaint. The defendants' motion for summary judgment does not address the question of whether the restrictions placed on Mr. Makin's religious diet were reasonable under the Turner standard. Therefore, summary judgment cannot be granted on that basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' App. Vol. I at 11. Defendants did not object to the recommendation, and the district court accepted it. See id. at 16. Defendants re-raised the issue of qualified immunity at trial. Noting that defendants had not objected to the magistrate judge's recommendation and that the court had earlier adopted it, the court determined that the recommendation stood as law of the case and would not reconsider it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants contend that the district court erred in ruling that the qualified immunity determination was law of the case not subject to further consideration at the time of trial. Without citing authority, they contend that the failure to file written objections to a magistrate judge's recommendation based on an erroneous determination of the law, as opposed to an erroneous determination of fact, does not bar subsequent review by either the district court or, anticipating a potential waiver problem on appeal, this court. They contend the error of law was the \"Magistrate's ruling the law was clearly established requiring prison officials to provide special feeding accommodation for the Ramadan fast on the grounds that religious diet must be accommodated.\" Appellants' Br. at 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regardless of whether defendants' failure to object to the magistrate judge's recommendation made the court's adoption of that recommendation law of the case in a technical sense, their failure to object precludes our consideration of their qualified immunity argument on appeal. The magistrate judge's recommendation effectively involved two legal determinations--that the relevant legal issue was Mr. Makin's \"right to reasonable access to his religiously required diet\" and that that right was clearly established at the time of the violations alleged in his complaint. See Romero v. Fay, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"687365\"><a href=\"/opinion/687365/paul-romero-v-damon-fay-bob-stover-chief-of-police-and-albuquerque/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1472</span></a></span>, 1475 (10th Cir.1995). But contrary to defendants' unsupported contention, the failure to object to a magistrate judge's recommendation \"waives appellate review of both factual and legal questions,\" Moore v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572765\"><a href=\"/opinion/572765/dennis-wayne-moore-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">656</span></a></span>, 659 (10th Cir. 1991) (emphasis added), absent other considerations not applicable here. The fact that the magistrate judge's recommendation also concluded there were unresolved factual issues precluding summary judgment does not detract from its legal determinations nor relieve defendants of their obligation to object to those determinations to preserve their right to appellate review. We therefore will not consider defendants' qualified immunity argument.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Violation of First Amendment Rights</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants next challenge the district court's determination that the denial of special meal accommodations during Ramadan violated Mr. Makin's First Amendment rights. Their argument takes two tracks. First, they argue that there was no violation because Mr. Makin was able to fast for the entire month of Ramadan despite their failure to deliver his meals at times when he could eat. Second, they contend that any infringement on his rights was justified by legitimate penological interests in deterrence of improper conduct, rehabilitation, prison security, and budgetary considerations. We review the district court's factual findings underlying its reasonableness determination for clear error, see, e.g., Grimsley v. MacKay, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"153791\"><a href=\"/opinion/153791/grimsley-v-mackay/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">676</span></a></span>, 679 (10th Cir. 1996), but our review of the ultimate reasonableness inquiry is de novo, see Mosier, 937 F.2d at 1525.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before addressing defendants' specific arguments, we must note the limited breadth of the issue presented for review. That issue, as defined by defendants, is whether they improperly infringed on Mr. Makin's right to exercise his right to observe Ramadan in 1993. It is not the broader issue of whether their actions improperly infringed on his right to exercise his belief in Islam in a more general sense, as was the case, for example, in Shabazz. See 482 U.S. at 352.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> By limiting our focus to the observance of Ramadan, however, we do not mean to diminish the significance of Ramadan as part of the Five Pillars of Islam. See, e.g., Appellants' App. Vol. II at 20-21, 30, 63.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected defendants' argument that the fact that Mr. Makin was able to fast the entire month of Ramadan absolved them of any liability their restrictions on meal service may have warranted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Mr. Makin was able to engage in the fast through personal sacrifice by the act of simply not eating his breakfast or lunch and trying to save food from his dinner tray to eat after sundown, it is clear to this Court that the qualitative spiritual experience that was eloquently described by Mr. Makin, and which was corroborated by the testimony of the Islamic coordinator, was substantially diminished by the regulations in place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' App. Vol. I at 39-40. Although defendants' argument could be viewed as relating to the Turner factor regarding alternative means of exercising the right, their argument appears to go to the more fundamental proposition that Mr. Makin's rights were not infringed at all. As did the district court, we address the argument in that posture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Imam Kharrubi explained the religious experience of Ramadan as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The month of Ramadan is a special season. Muslims believe that during that month there are more angels around. Rewards are multiplied, and sins are multiplied as well. So we--we are highly encouraged by these perceptions, of course, by the practice within our community to avoid all kinds of sins, gossip, backbiting, and all the other bad things. And, of course, maximize our good behavior and good practices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And it's basically a special season to maximize spirituality, getting closer to God. Blessings is much easier to receive in Ramadan than otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . Islam emphasizes discipline, and it's through discipline and through adherence to these practices that you would grow spiritually. This growth that's gained through the practice itself is . . . something similar to the word zakat, which is charity, the third pillar of Islam. And basically, when you give in charity, you gain purification of your soul. When you practice--when you pray, when you fast, when you do all the other good deeds that you're required to do, that's when you get spiritual growth and purification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If . . . somebody practices fasting, they would get a blessing from God. And through the practice of that self-discipline, they would get purification as well. If a person was not allowed to fast or if a person was not in the position, was not able to fast, then with still through their intention wanted to fast but could not, would get a blessing from God, but would miss out on the purification or the growth that would be received through the actual practice itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' App. Vol. II at 64-66. Mr. Makin further explained the beneficial experience of Ramadan, and the negative effect of defendants' restrictions on meal service and his opposition to those restrictions, as follow:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That I would ordinarily attain [during Ramadan] would be a state of peace of mind, a state of knowing and feeling that everybody throughout the year that has not had food, they are also feeling the pains that I'm also feeling. And it is our way of getting in touch with the inner forces within us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . .Within the month of Ramadan, that I supposed to be within a peaceful state of mind. I do not supposed to engage in war, arguments or nothing like that. When I'm placed within a position to where I'm now must engage within this [complaints to prison authorities regarding meal accommodations], all right, that my nice, peaceful aura is now broken. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[as to physical deprivation] It was horrible. It's standing around sweating, being in bed sweating, It's--during Ramadan you're going to encounter, you know, the urge to eat. You're going to feel hungry. Compound that on with having extremely hot [he testified the cells were very hot], and you're also engaged within this close confinement and also engaged in combativeness to trying to get it so that you can at least eat right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 30-32.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted above, the district court relied on this testimony in finding an infringement on Mr. Makin's right to freely exercise his religion because defendants actions substantially diminished his qualitative spiritual experience. Defendants essentially argue that the burden they placed on Mr. Makin's ability to fast during Ramadan should be ignored because he overcame that burden and did fast. We reject this argument for several reasons. First, it is founded on the unacceptable notion that prison authorities may burden the observance of religious practices for no legitimate reason at all. Second, it makes the question of the legitimacy of government action dependent on the personal strength of the individual affected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, and what the district court found most important, it ignores the religious experiential aspects of Ramadan beyond the fasting itself. There is no question, as the district court found based on undisputed evidence, that Mr. Makin sincerely holds his religious beliefs. See generally Mosier, 937 F.2d at 1526-27 (discussing requirement that religious beliefs be sincerely held to be protected). Should defendants be implicitly inviting us to question the validity or importance of these other aspects of Ramadan as described by Mr. Makin (and Imam Kharrubi), we heartily reject their invitation. See, e.g., Employment Division v. Smith, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112404\"><a href=\"/opinion/112404/employment-div-dept-of-human-resources-of-ore-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">872</span></a></span>, 887 (1990) (\"Repeatedly and in many different contexts, we have warned that courts must not presume to determine the place of a particular belief in a religion or the plausibility of a religious claim.\"); Hernandez v.

[A court's] task is to decide whether the beliefs professed by [an individual] are sincerely held and whether they are, in his own scheme of things, religious.\") (quotation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the testimony by Imam Kharrubi and Mr. Makin demonstrated, and the district court held, the burden defendants placed on Mr. Makin diminished the spiritual experience he otherwise could gain through Ramadan. This is sufficient to constitute an infringement on his right to freely exercise his religion. A complete denial of the ability to observe a religious practice is not required to demonstrate an infringement, though the fact that a spiritual experience was only diminished rather than denied may factor into the strength of the penological interests necessary to justify the infringement. We thus turn to defendants' argument that legitimate penological interests warranted their interference with Mr. Makin's rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants contend that the Ramadan policy for inmates in segregation served four governmental interests: deterrence, rehabilitation, security and budget. Defendants argue generally that restricting a prisoner's right to exercise his religion while in punitive segregation \"deter[s] inmates from behaving in a manner which caused them to be placed in segregation.\" Appellants' Br. at 7. However, they cite neither evidence indicating that the policy had any deterrent or rehabilitative goal, nor authority supporting their implied contention that restriction of religious freedom is a proper tool for deterring improper conduct. Cf. Young v. Coughlin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"517603\"><a href=\"/opinion/517603/jerry-young-aka-ramadan-v-thomas-a-coughlin-iii-k-weaver/\"><span class=\"volume\">866</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">567</span></a></span>, 570 (2d Cir. 1989) (\"It also was error to assume that prison officials were justified in limiting appellant's free exercise rights simply because [he] was in disciplinary confinement.\"). Moreover, defendants ignore Mr. Sullivan's testimony that deterrence and rehabilitation were not considerations in promulgating the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">As he explained:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The intent [of the policy] would not have been rehabilitation or deterrence. The intent would have been to simply meet the operational security needs of the prison with the limited staff we had available. We just simply didn't have the staff available and the resources available to accommodate the program for those inmates in segregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no processing of goals and objectives of corrections in terms of, is this rehabilitative or a deterrence effect? That was not in the process. The process was very limited to the availability of staff necessary to carry out the program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' App. Vol. II at 91.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Sullivan's testimony does support the general idea that the policy served the related interests of security and budgetary considerations, but he did not further elaborate on these interests, and the record does not contain other evidence of their relevance or applicability. Based on Mr. Johnson's testimony that the security and budgetary impact of accommodating Mr. Makin in segregation would have been minimal, the district court found the security and budgetary interests to be nonexistent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Defendants contend that the district court improperly dismissed budgetary concerns because the directive applied to all prisons and prisoners within the Department of Corrections system, not just Territorial and Mr. Makin. However, as noted above, they presented no evidence of the budgetary or security impact of accommodating prisoners in segregation at these other facilities. Given the evidence before the district court, its finding that there were no legitimate budgetary and security interests behind the policy is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We thus agree with the district court that the directive infringed on Mr. Makin's right to exercise his religion and that defendants did not put forth any legitimate penological interests to justify that infringement. Defendants therefore denied Mr. Makin a reasonable opportunity to pursue his religion, and are liable for damages under  1983.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Damages</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants contend that should we agree with the district court that they violated Mr. Makin's constitutional rights, we should vacate the district court's compensatory damages award of $9,000 because Mr. Makin did not suffer any actual injury. They contend that only an award of $1 in nominal damages is appropriate. While we agree the district court improperly determined the amount of damages, we do not agree that Mr. Makin is entitled only to nominal damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Damages are available for violations of  1983 \"to compensate persons for injuries caused by the deprivation of constitutional rights.\" Carey v. Piphus, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109815\"><a href=\"/opinion/109815/carey-v-piphus/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></a></span>, 254 (1978). A damages award must be based on actual injuries; id. at 264; \"the abstract value of a constitutional right may not form the basis for  1983 damages.\" Memphis Community Sch. Dist. v. Stachura, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111721\"><a href=\"/opinion/111721/memphis-community-school-dist-v-stachura/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span>, 308 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that \"[t]he best way that the Court can quantify a damage figure is on a per diem basis, i.e., that a certain amount per day be awarded which represents what this Court believes to be a reasonable damage award to this Plaintiff who was unconstitutionally denied his ability to freely exercise his religion for the month of Ramadan in 1993.\" Appellants' App. Vol. I at 42-43 (emphasis added). In doing so, the court incorrectly based its award on the abstract value of the constitutional right rather than on the actual injuries Mr. Makin suffered from the denial of that right, and we must vacate its award. We disagree with defendants, however, that there was no evidence of actual damages and that we must therefore impose nominal damages of only $1. Mr. Makin's testimony provides some evidence that he suffered mental or emotional distress as a result of defendants' actions for which he may recover. See Carey, 435 U.S. at 264. We leave for the district court's determination on remand the amount of damages, if any, the evidence supports.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we conclude that the district court correctly held that defendants' failure to accommodate Mr. Makin's meal requirements during Ramadan in 1993 violated his First Amendment right to freely exercise his religion, but that the district court improperly determined the amount of damages. The judgment of the district court in favor of Mr. Makin is therefore AFFIRMED in part, the award of damages is VACATED, and the case is remanded to the district court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties' request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument.

In its analysis, the Court said \"we think it appropriate to see whether under these regulations [the prisoners] retain the ability to participate in other Muslim religious ceremonies,\" including Ramadan. 482 U.S. at 352. After noting the prisoners did retain that ability, the Court concluded that \"this ability on the part of [the prisoners] to participate in other religious observances of their faith supports the conclusion that the restrictions at issue here were reasonable.\" Id. We note that the record on appeal in this case says little about any other Islamic observances or practices in which Mr. Makin was able to participate.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The court based its finding primarily on its questioning of Mr. Johnson on this point as follows:</p>\n        <p>THE COURT: . . . Let's assume that instead of being told that inmates in segregation would be unable to participate in special feeding activities, you were told they would be allowed to participate in special feeding activities, how would you have accommodated that directive?</p>\n        <p>THE WITNESS: I would have realigned the staff. I would have made special provisions, as I did for Ramadan itself.</p>\n        <p>THE COURT: So could you have accommodated that request so that inmates--</p>\n        <p>THE WITNESS: Could I have accommodated it? Absolutely.</p>\n        <p>THE COURT: Okay. How would you have done that?</p>\n        <p>THE WITNESS: I would have probably brought in overtime staff, and I would have taken--when we brought the inmates over to the general mess hall, then I would have had staff pick up the food from the general mess hall and deliver it to the administrative segregation.</p>\n        <p>THE COURT: Okay. You're talking about the inmates who were taken at 4 a.m. for breakfast in the . . . general population, and you would have taken a food tray back to the inmates in segregation.</p>\n        <p>THE WITNESS: Yes. And I would have taken it within the time frames the same as we ran our other program.</p>\n        <p>THE COURT: Okay. And then in the evening, because the policy specified that those who were in the general population would have their dinner meal at 6:30 p.m., which would have been after sundown, you would have done the same thing in the evening?</p>\n        <p>THE WITNESS: Yes, sir, I would have.</p>\n        <p>THE COURT: Okay. So really the only reason that you didn't do that for Mr. Makin was because you had gotten this directive from Mr. Sullivan which said that inmates in segregation would be unable to participate in special feeding activities. Is that what you are saying?</p>\n        <p>THE WITNESS: Yes, sir.</p>\n        <p>Appellants' App. Vol. II at 183-84.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
