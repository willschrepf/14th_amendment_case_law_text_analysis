Even in the few areas where they were\npermitted to open, new group homes were required to submit\nto a permit process. Existing group homes also had to\nundergo the same permit process in order to continue their\noperations. Among the factors to be considered when\ngranting or denying a permit to any group home was the\nnumber of other such facilities in the neighborhood.\n\n    On its face, the Ordinance did not single out group\nhomes; persons recovering from addiction are protected from\nhousing discrimination under state and federal anti-\ndiscrimination laws. Instead, the Ordinance facially imposed\nrestrictions on some other types of group living arrangements\nas well. At the same time, the City did not impose similar\n\n\n  1\n    We follow the parties’ convention in referring to addiction recovery\nfacilities as “group homes.” The term “group homes” is not defined in the\nOrdinance or in any relevant statute, however. As used by the parties and\nin this opinion, the term refers only to addiction recovery facilities and not\nto any other sort of communal living arrangement.\n\f6   PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH\n\nregulations on properties rented by homeowners to\nvacationing tourists, despite the fact that such rental\nproperties may cause similar social problems as group homes.\nOn advice of counsel, the City had initially planned to\nregulate such rental properties in order to avoid the\nappearance of discriminating against group homes, but it\nbacked down from doing so in the face of opposition from a\nnumber of City residents.\n\n    Taken in the light most favorable to the non-moving\nparty, Plaintiffs’ evidence shows that the City’s purpose in\nenacting the Ordinance was to exclude group homes from\nmost residential districts and to bring about the closure of\nexisting group homes in those areas. The evidence also\nshows that the Ordinance regulated other types of group\nresidential arrangements primarily for the purpose of\nmaintaining a veneer of neutrality. Several existing group\nhomes, which, as a result of the Ordinance, were required to\napply for a use permit in order to continue operating in\nresidential areas, sued the City, alleging that the Ordinance\ndiscriminated against them as facilities that provide housing\nopportunities for disabled individuals recovering from\naddiction. The district court acknowledged the evidence that\nthe City acted with a discriminatory motive but found that\nevidence “irrelevant” because, it stated, the City had not\ntreated group homes any worse than certain other group\nliving arrangements.\n\n    We reverse and hold that the district court erred in\ndisregarding the evidence that the City’s sole objective in\nenacting and enforcing its Ordinance was to discriminate\nagainst persons deemed to be disabled under state and federal\nhousing discrimination laws. Although plaintiffs in an anti-\ndiscrimination lawsuit may survive summary judgment by\n\f     PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH            7\n\nidentifying similarly situated individuals who were treated\nbetter than themselves, this is not the only way to\ndemonstrate that intentional discrimination has occurred.\nWhere, as here, there is direct or circumstantial evidence that\nthe defendant has acted with a discriminatory purpose and has\ncaused harm to members of a protected class, such evidence\nis sufficient to permit the protected individuals to proceed to\ntrial under a disparate treatment theory. This is no less true\nwhere, as here, the defendant is willing to harm certain\nsimilarly-situated individuals who are not members of the\ndisfavored group in order to accomplish a discriminatory\nobjective, while preserving the appearance of neutrality.\n\n    We also hold that the district court erred in concluding\nthat the Plaintiffs failed to create a triable issue of fact as to\nwhether the losses that their businesses suffered were caused\nby the enactment and enforcement of the Ordinance. The\nPlaintiffs presented evidence that they experienced a\nsignificant decline in business after the Ordinance’s\nenactment, that the publicity surrounding the Ordinance\ngreatly reduced referrals, and that current and prospective\nresidents expressed concern about whether the group home\nPlaintiffs would close. By requiring the Plaintiffs to prove\nmore, the district court failed to draw all reasonable\ninferences in their favor, as it was required to do at summary\njudgment. In addition, we hold that the costs borne by the\nPlaintiffs to present their permit applications and the costs\nspent assuring the public that they were still operating despite\nthe City’s efforts to close them are compensable. Finally, we\nhold that the district court erred in dismissing Plaintiff\nWiseman’s claim for emotional distress, but correctly\ndismissed Plaintiff Bridgeman’s similar claim.\n\f8       PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH\n\n                    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n                                   I\n\n    Newport Beach (“the City”) is a Southern California\nbeachfront community with about 80,000 residents and is one\nof the wealthiest cities in the United States.2 In the late 1990s\n“group homes” began opening in increasing numbers in the\nCity, particularly in the beachfront neighborhoods of West\nNewport and Balboa Park. Group homes are residential\nfacilities in which individuals recovering from drug and\nalcohol addiction temporarily reside. They provide a\ncommunal living environment in which residents help each\nother to recover from their addictions. In order to preserve a\nsubstance-free environment, group homes limit occupancy to\npersons who are sober; a resident who uses drugs or alcohol\nis immediately evicted. Because individuals recovering from\naddiction need to stay for varying lengths of time, they do not\ntypically sign written leases. Typically, group home\noperators meet with and screen potential residents in advance\nto ensure that they are serious about pursuing a sober\nlifestyle.\n\n    By April 2007, the City contained 73 group homes, 48 of\nwhich were licensed treatment facilities and 25 of which were\nunlicensed sober houses.3 At that time the City also had 801\n\n\n    2\n    It is also the setting for the popular television show The O.C., now\nplaying on secondary runs. Also currently showing on Netflix is Arrested\nDevelopment.\n    3\n   There are two types of group homes. Unlicensed “sober houses,” also\nknown as “sober living homes,” are group homes occupied by persons in\nrecovery with no formal substance abuse treatment program. Licensed\n\f     PAC.

These homes are usually rented for\nprofit for a period of 30 days or fewer to tourists who elect\nNewport Beach as a beach vacation destination. Like group\nhomes, short-term lodgings cater to a revolving clientele that\ncan cause strains on neighborhood resources. In Newport\nBeach, “short term lodgings” are generally referred to as\n“vacation homes,” and we use the terms interchangeably.\n\n    The three group home Plaintiffs, Pacific Shores Properties\nLLC (“Pacific Shores”), Newport Coast Recovery LLC\n(“NCR”), and Yellowstone Women’s First Step House, Inc.\n(“Yellowstone”) (collectively, “the Group Homes”) were part\nof the influx of group homes into Newport Beach during the\nmid-to-late 1990s and the early 2000s. The individual\nPlaintiffs are, respectively, one of the owners and two former\nresidents of Pacific Shores. Pacific Shores and Yellowstone\noperate unlicensed sober houses, while NCR is a state-\nlicensed facility. Each Group Home spent hundreds of\nthousands of dollars purchasing and renovating the homes it\noperates.\n\n    The increasing number of group homes in Newport Beach\ngenerated escalating hostility on the part of some City\nresidents who, in a series of public meetings, repeatedly\ndescribed the persons in recovery as “not true handicapped,”\n“criminals,” “gang members,” and “druggies,” among other\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia Alcohol and Drug Program (“ADP”) facilities, by contrast,\nprovide substance abuse treatment on site.\n\f10 PAC.

Because the City’s intent in passing these\nmeasures is central to this appeal, we recount their history in\ndetail.\n\n                                    II\n\n    The City’s attempts to formally address group homes\nbegan at a City Council meeting on January 23, 2007. At that\nmeeting, members of the public expressed their displeasure\nwith group homes and submitted a petition signed by 88\nresidents asking the City Council to address the issue.\nShortly before that meeting, in an email to a concerned\ncitizen, then-Mayor Rosansky wrote, “I suspect that these\n[group home] facilities do nothing to really solve the problem\nbut only serve as wherehouses [sic] for alcoholics and drug\naddicts until they really hit bottom.”\n\n     The City Council decided to form an Intense Residential\nOccupancy Committee (“IROC”) “to review and understand\nthe state and federal laws and regulations that limit [the]\nCity’s ability to regulate” and “to research and identify\nsolutions to the problems and make . . . recommendations to\nthe [C]ity [C]ouncil for changes to regulations applicable to\nall residential uses in a manner that preserves the residential\n\n\n  4\n   One City resident described the attitude in Newport Beach towards\ngroup homes in particularly stark terms: “the idea of the guys with torches\nand pitchforks coming off the bridge is much closer to the sentiment [in\none neighborhood] than the oh, ho-hum we want to help some poor\ndruggy for the tenth time go through the system.”\n\f     PAC.

CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH          11\n\ncharacter of our neighborhoods.” Eight members were\nappointed to the IROC, including then-Mayor Rosansky,\nanother council member, and Planning Commissioner\nMichael Toerge, as well as several private citizens.\n\n    The IROC’s work culminated in a proposed ordinance\nthat imposed a moratorium on establishing or operating any\nnew “transitory uses” in a residential district for a period of\n45 days, including group homes and short term lodgings.\nAngry citizens protested the freeze on the latter category, i.e.,\nvacation homes. Craig Batley, a realtor and a member of the\nIROC, e-mailed City Council members to express the view\nthat “the focus needs to be on Group Homes and only Group\nHomes.” At a City Council meeting on April 24, 2007,\ncitizens submitted a 400-signature petition against including\nshort term lodgings in the moratorium. The City nevertheless\nenacted the moratorium as drafted. In a newspaper article\npublished shortly thereafter, the City Attorney expressed the\nview that regulating only group homes would be\ndiscriminatory absent a showing that they caused different\nsocial problems than short-term lodgings.\n\n    In order to demonstrate that group homes did cause\ndifferent social problems than vacation homes, the City\nconducted a citizen survey on the respective impacts of each\ntype of housing. The City had never conducted a survey in\nconnection with legislation before. The survey was\ndistributed to four neighborhoods, three of which were the\n“[n]eighborhoods that seemed to generate the most\ncomplaints about [group homes].” One citizen opposed to\ngroup homes had one hundred surveys left on her doorstep to\npersonally distribute.\n\f12 PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH\n\n    The City Attorney prepared a report summarizing the 47\nsurvey responses the City received and recommending that\nthe City Council lift the moratorium with respect to vacation\nhomes. The City Attorney’s report also suggested amending\nthe City Code to separately address problems caused by\nshort-term lodgings, although the proposed amendments were\nnever enacted. On May 30, 2007, the City Council passed\nOrdinance 2007-10 (“the revised Moratorium”), which\nfollowed the report’s recommendation to lift the freeze on\nshort-term lodging permits, but continued to prohibit new\ngroup homes. The revised Moratorium was renewed for an\nadditional year on October 30, 2007. The district court found\nthat the revised Moratorium was facially discriminatory\nbecause it singled out group homes for adverse treatment.\n\n    Around spring or fall of 2007, the City created an\n“Interdepartmental Group Homes Task Force,” headed by\nAssistant City Manager David Kiff to “verify” the number\nand location of group homes in the City, and to enforce code\nviolations against them, including violations of the then-\napplicable moratorium. The City hired James Sinasek to\nwork with Kiff. During the second half of 2007, Sinasek\ninvestigated group homes by searching the internet to locate\nthem and posing as a potential client. He visited suspected\ngroup home sites, observed the properties, and photographed\nresidents, vehicles, and license plates at or around the\nproperties. Both Kiff and Sinasek attended meetings at the\nhomes of members of the Concerned Citizens of Newport\nBeach (“CCNB”), a citizen advocacy group opposed to group\nhomes, at which CCNB members provided lists of additional\nsuspected group home sites for Kiff and Sinasek to\n\f     PAC.

At a Planning Commission meeting\non June 21, 2007, the City Planner and outside counsel,\nGoldfarb & Lipman (“Goldfarb”) presented a draft ordinance\nto the Commission. The draft regulated both group homes\nand short-term lodgings because Goldfarb advised that doing\nso was necessary to avoid enacting an unlawful\ndiscriminatory ordinance. Commissioner Toerge, a member\nof the IROC, argued that the City needed to “be more\naggressive” because it was “inundated” with group homes; he\nendorsed an alternate draft prepared by attorneys employed\nby the CCNB.          Goldfarb subsequently prepared a\nmemorandum explaining why the CCNB’s proposed\nordinance would be discriminatory.\n\n    Nonetheless, the City Planner prepared a revised\nordinance that did not regulate short-term lodgings. On\nSeptember 20, 2007, an attorney from Goldfarb testified to\nthe City Council that not regulating vacation homes might\nraise concerns about discrimination, and stated that “[t]here\nare still other non-conforming uses that are not necessarily\nresidential care facilities [i.e., group homes]. We seem to not\nknow exactly how many of those there are . . . but I think you\ngrasp the situation that it does—it does change the overall\nimpression.” Most public comments from City residents\nexpressed frustration that the Commission had rejected as\nfacially discriminatory the CCNB’s more aggressive\n\n  5\n    These lists included the meeting sites for members of Alcoholics\nAnonymous and Narcotics Anonymous.\n\f14 PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH\n\nordinance.   Commissioner Toerge suggested that the\nCommission should not be considering legal discrimination\nconcerns: “I mean save that for the courtroom.” The\nPlanning Commission approved the revised draft.\n\n    While the Planning Commission was considering drafts\nof the Ordinance, the City Council formed an Ad Hoc\nCommittee on Group Residential Legal Review whose sole\npurpose was to replace Goldfarb, the firm advising the City\nthat failure to regulate short-term lodgings would be\ndiscriminatory, with new special counsel. This Committee’s\nwork resulted in the city hiring new counsel, Richards,\nWatson, & Gershon PC, the firm that represents the City in\nthis appeal.\n\n    On October 9, 2007, the City Council formed an\nadditional Ad Hoc Committee on Group Residential Uses to\nwork with new counsel on revising the draft ordinance that\nhad been recommended by the Planning Commission. The\ncommittee was chaired by Council Member Henn and\nincluded two other council members. No such Committee\nhad ever been formed by the city before and its meetings\nwere not open to the public.\n\n    On January 8, 2008, the Committee proposed another\ndraft ordinance to the City Council. Unlike the draft\napproved by the Planning Commission, this one provided that\nhearing officers who were to adjudicate group homes’ use\npermit applications were to consider as a factor the\nconcentration of group homes in the neighborhood. Council\nMember Henn defended the Ordinance against residents who\nwanted to limit the density of group homes even more\nexplicitly. He explained that the Ordinance had four\nobjectives. The first was to ensure that no new group homes\n\f       PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH                15\n\nwould open in Newport Beach: “Do you get my drift? No\nnew ones anywhere unless an applicant can somehow prove\na need for special accommodation under federal law.” The\nsecond objective was to “assure that those homes that do\noperate in [the] community must meet the requirements of the\nstringent process and agree to strict operational guidelines or\ntheir permit will be revoked.” Third, the City would “assure\nthat there will be strict enforcement of the new ordinances\ngoing forward.” The fourth objective was “to substantially\nrelieve the existing overconcentration of group homes and\ntheir adverse impacts.”\n\n    Henn continued: “We have carefully evaluated the idea of\nsimply banning all unlicensed [group] homes in all but the\nmultifamily areas of the Peninsula. The siren song of that\nsolution was carefully evaluated, and unfortunately, as in so\nmany facets of life, our ideal must be tempered by reality.”\nHe explained that “to do so would risk an immediately\nsuccessful court challenge that would immediately enjoin the\nCity from executing the ordinance . . . while we fight it in\ncourt.” He concluded saying, “I believe that taken together\nthese findings and requirements will, in fact, result in a\nsubstantial reduction in the number of group homes on the\nPeninsula. . . . I ask you judge us by our actual results.”6\n\n    On January 22, 2008, the City Council met to approve the\nOrdinance and yet again confronted citizens who felt that the\nOrdinance should be even stricter and expressly regulate the\nconcentration of group homes. Outside counsel explained\nthat the approach adopted by the Ordinance—case-by-case\n\n\n   6\n     Although Henn at one point stated that the City wished to ban\nunlicensed homes, the larger context of his remarks suggests that the City\npreferred to ban all group homes, both licensed and unlicensed.\n\f16 PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH\n\nanalysis of each facility by a Hearing Officer—was harder to\nchallenge in court than a strict limit on the density of group\nhomes. Counsel assured the public that the Ordinance\nallowed “plenty of . . . hooks and standards for a [H]earing\n[O]fficer to apply [to deny a permit application].” Council\nMember Henn described the use permit process imposed by\nthe Ordinance as “a very substantive attack” on the “issue of\noverconcentration [of group homes.]” Henn also pointed out\nthat he was “not aware of any other city in the State of\nCalifornia that has adopted an ordinance that’s as aggressive\nas [the City’s] in terms of the location of new [group\nhomes].” Then, immediately after Henn’s comments, the\nCity Council approved the Ordinance, which prohibits new\ngroup homes in most residential areas, requires existing group\nhomes in those areas to submit to a burdensome permit\nprocess, and subjects those seeking to establish group homes\nin the limited areas in which they are still permitted to operate\nto the same onerous permit process.\n\n                              III\n\n    The Ordinance is codified as part of Title 20 of the City\nof Newport Beach Municipal Code (“NBMC”). Prior to the\nOrdinance’s enactment, the City treated group homes as\n“single housekeeping units.” “Single housekeeping units” are\ngenerally permitted to locate in all residential zones without\nany special permit. The Ordinance’s key innovation was to\namend the definition of “single housekeeping unit” to exclude\ngroup homes. This was accomplished in two critical ways:\nthe amended definition added the requirements that (1) a\nsingle housekeeping unit have a single, written lease and (2)\nthe residents themselves must decide who will be a member\nof the household.

As\n“residential care facilities,” group homes now face significant\nrestrictions on location, and otherwise, to which they were\nnot subject prior to the Ordinance’s enactment when they\ntypically qualified as “single housekeeping units” and were\nable to operate freely in all residential areas. Under the\nOrdinance, as “residential care facilities,” new group homes\nmay not locate in most residential zones under any\ncircumstances, although they may locate in “multi-family”\nresidential zones if they obtain a special use permit.

None of the Group Home Plaintiffs here\nfall in that category.\n 8\n   The NBMC distinguishes between “general” residential care facilities\n(those with more than six residents) and “small” residential care facilities\n(those with six or fewer residents), although the difference is not relevant\nhere. California law requires that licensed facilities with six residents or\nfewer be treated as single-family dwellings for zoning purposes by all\nmunicipalities. As a result such facilities are classified as “small licensed\nresidential care facilities” under the NBMC and treated the same as single\nfamily homes. All unlicensed residential care facilities, on the other hand,\nare “general residential care facilities” subject to the Ordinance, regardless\nof size.

Such living arrangements, whether new or pre-existing,\nare flatly prohibited from existing in any residential zone. There is no\nevidence, however, that more than a minimal number of “group\nresidential” living arrangements existed in residential zones at the time\nthat the Ordinance was enacted. NBMC §§ 20.05.030(C), 20.10.020. In\nany event, it seems unlikely that any significant number of such\nestablishments would have existed in the residential areas of Newport\nBeach.\n\f        PAC.

The\napplication was denied, and before its appeal could be heard,\nPacific Shores submitted an amended reasonable\naccommodation request seeking to be allowed to continue\noperations at two of its three houses with a maximum of 12\nresidents per facility, instead of 18. That request was granted.\n\n    The Ordinance shut down other group homes. On July\n30, 2008, Kiff gave a public presentation defending the\nOrdinance’s efficacy. Kiff explained that the Ordinance had\nforced group homes “to fight, stay, or leave,” and noted that\nof just over 600 group home beds in the City prior to the\nOrdinance, 220 were at facilities that would soon be required\nto close. According to Kiff, housing opportunities in group\nhomes were set to decline by 40% citywide “with all of the\nuse permit hearings yet to come.” He commented that Pacific\nShores was the City’s “most aggressive challenger” and that\n“they [we]re not going quietly.” Kiff ended his presentation\nstating that anti-discrimination laws “make[] me mad, too”\nbut that “as long as I’m here, you have my commitment—and\nI know you do of the City Council—to trying to bring owner-\noccupied back to West Newport.”\n\n    As Kiff predicted, by February 2009, more than 25 Group\nHomes—about one third of the number of Group Homes that\nhad existed in 2007—had either closed or were pending\nclosure.

The City’s actions were particularly well known\nwithin the community of providers and therapists in Orange\nCounty and Southern California, and the City acknowledged\nas much in its communications with citizens. The managers\nand staff at the Group Homes spent substantial portions of\ntheir time contacting referral sources to assure them that,\ndespite negative publicity, the Group Homes were not\nclosing. Both Pacific Shores and NCR hired web consultants\nto improve their web ranking so that their webpages\n“appeared above web pages about the City’s actions to close”\nthem.\n\n    Each of the Group Homes experienced a dramatic decline\nin revenues of between 40% and 50% in the two years after\nthe Ordinance’s enactment. NCR closed in 2009 as a result\nof its declining business.        In addition, as the City\nacknowledged at oral argument, prior to reducing its\nreasonable accommodation request to only 12 beds per\nhomes, Pacific Shores had a higher occupancy rate at both of\nthe two homes for which its request was granted, so it lost\nsubstantial revenue as a result of the new 12 bed limitation.\n\n\n\n  12\n     Doing so would have been difficult.

NCR and Yellowstone\nfiled a separate suit alleging nearly identical claims. All of\nthe Plaintiffs sought damages as well as declaratory and\ninjunctive relief. The district court disposed of most of the\nPlaintiffs’ claims in two separate summary judgment rulings.\n\n    First, the district court granted summary judgment to the\nCity “with respect to [all of the] Plaintiffs’ disparate\ntreatment and selective enforcement claims brought under the\nFHA, ADA, FEHA, and the Equal Protection Clause,”\nbecause the Plaintiffs failed to show that they were “treated\ndifferently than similarly situated non-disabled individuals in\nthe enforcement of Ordinance 2008-5.” In so doing, the court\nacknowledged “the large amount of evidence . . . regarding\nNewport Beach’s allegedly discriminatory intent,” but\nconcluded that it was “irrelevant.” However, the district\ncourt denied the City summary judgment as to Pacific Shores’\nclaim that the Revised Moratorium was discriminatory,\nholding that it was facially discriminatory against group\nhomes.13\n\n\n 13\n    Pacific Shores was the only plaintiff to challenge the enforcement of\nthe Revised Moratorium because it was the only plaintiff against whom it\nwas enforced.\n\f24 PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH\n\n    In a second summary judgment order, the district court\ndismissed all of the Group Homes’ remaining claims for\ndamages, determining that none of the Group Homes had\ndemonstrated that any of the harm they suffered was caused\nby the Revised Moratorium or the Ordinance as opposed to\nother causes for which the City was not responsible, such as\nthe downturn in the economy or hostility of City residents\ntowards group homes. The district court also dismissed the\ntwo individual residents’ damages claims, concluding that\nneither produced any evidence of having suffered\ncompensable emotional distress.\n\n    In order to obtain a final judgment, the Plaintiffs\nvoluntarily dismissed their remaining claims with prejudice,\nincluding their claims to injunctive relief under a disparate\nimpact theory and their challenges to the City’s adjudication\nof each Group Home’s particular use permit and reasonable\naccommodation applications. The district court entered final\njudgment in favor of the City on March 14, 2011.\n\n    The Plaintiffs timely appealed for review of two issues:\n(1) “whether the district court erred in granting summary\njudgment against plaintiffs on their intentional discrimination\nclaims despite substantial evidence that the City enacted a\nzoning ordinance for the purpose of discriminating against\nhousing for disabled persons and enforced that ordinance to\neffect its discriminatory purpose” and (2) “whether the\ndistrict court erred in granting summary judgment against\nplaintiffs, who were the targets of the discriminatory\nordinance enacted and enforced by the City, on the grounds\nthat plaintiffs could not show that the City was the cause of\nany of their injuries.” We have jurisdiction pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\f       PAC.

Finally, group homes such as the ones at issue\nhere are “dwellings” under 42 U.S.C. § 3602(b), and\ntherefore the FHA prohibits discriminatory actions that\nadversely affect the availability of such group homes.

SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH\n\n    Quite properly, the City does not challenge any of these\nfoundational principles. Instead, the primary liability-phase\nquestion presented here is whether the district court properly\ndismissed the Plaintiffs’ disparate treatment claims for failure\nto demonstrate that any similarly situated entity was treated\nworse than the Plaintiffs under the Ordinance. The Plaintiffs\nargue that it was error to disregard the large amount of\nevidence in the record suggesting that the Ordinance was\nenacted for the discriminatory purpose of harming group\nhomes and thereby limiting the housing opportunities\navailable to individuals recovering from addiction. We now\nturn to that question.\n\n                                   B\n\n    Our cases clearly establish that plaintiffs who allege\ndisparate treatment under statutory anti-discrimination laws\nneed not demonstrate the existence of a similarly situated\nentity who or which was treated better than the plaintiffs in\norder to prevail.

As described above, we have\nunambiguously rejected this position previously, and we do\nso again now. McDonnell-Douglas simply permits a plaintiff\nto raise an inference of discrimination by identifying a\nsimilarly situated entity who was treated more favorably. It\nis not a straightjacket requiring the plaintiff to demonstrate\nthat such similarly situated entities exist.\n\n    This case demonstrates why requiring anti-discrimination\nplaintiffs to prove the existence of a better-treated entity\nwould lead to unacceptable results. According to the district\ncourt’s theory, Plaintiffs in anti-discrimination suits would be\nunable to demonstrate the discriminatory intent of a\ndefendant that openly admitted its intent to discriminate, so\nlong as the defendant (a) relies on a facially neutral law or\npolicy and (b) is willing to “overdiscriminate” by enforcing\nthe facially neutral law or policy even against similarly-\nsituated individuals who are not members of the disfavored\ngroup. Such a rule presents the “grotesque scenario where a[]\n[defendant] can effectively immunize itself from suit if it is\nso thorough in its discrimination that all similarly situated\n\f32 PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH\n\n[entities] are victimized.”22 Abdu-Brisson v. Delta Air Lines,\nInc., 239 F.3d 456, 468 (2d Cir. 2001).\n\n     This “grotesque scenario” is not the law. Id. A\nwillingness to inflict collateral damage by harming some, or\neven all, individuals from a favored group in order to\nsuccessfully harm members of a disfavored class does not\ncleanse the taint of discrimination; it simply underscores the\ndepth of the defendant’s animus. See, e.g., Griffin v. Cnty.\nSch. Bd. of Prince Edward Cnty., 377 U.S. 218, 231 (1964)\n(holding that although a county has the legal power to close\nall of its public schools, it could not do so for the purpose of\npreventing children from attending desegregated schools). As\none district court observed in a case quite similar to this one,\n“that an ordinance also discriminates against individuals\nunprotected by the FHA does not eliminate a FHA violation.”\nChildren’s Alliance, 950 F. Supp. at 1496 n.8.23\n\n 22\n    Another possibility where no similarly situated entity will be available\nis where the nature of the defendant’s discrimination is such that no such\nentity could exist. For example, in Pyke v. Cuomo, 258 F.3d 107, 109 (2d\nCir. 2001), Native Americans alleging that state police officials\ndeliberately provided reduced police services on reservations were not\nrequired to show that similarly situated groups were better treated because\nit would be impossible to identify any other group “whose situation is\nsimilar to Native Americans living on a reservation and exercising a\nsubstantial measure of self-government independent of New York State.”\n   23\n      Children’s Alliance involved the use of a “proxy classification,” a\nvariation on the overdiscrimination theme. Proxy discrimination is a form\nof facial discrimination. It arises when the defendant enacts a law or\npolicy that treats individuals differently on the basis of seemingly neutral\ncriteria that are so closely associated with the disfavored group that\ndiscrimination on the basis of such criteria is, constructively, facial\ndiscrimination against the disfavored group. For example, discriminating\nagainst individuals with gray hair is a proxy for age discrimination\nbecause “the ‘fit’ between age and gray hair is sufficiently close.”\n\f      PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH                  33\n\n    The principle that overdiscrimination is prohibited\nundergirds all of constitutional and statutory anti-\ndiscrimination law, although it often goes unsaid precisely\nbecause it is so foundational. Discriminatory laws, policies,\nor actions will often have negative effects (whether intended\nor not) on individuals who do not belong to the disfavored\ngroup. This does not, however, change the fact that such\nlaws, policies, or actions are discriminatory when they are\nundertaken for the purpose of harming protected individuals.\n\n    Arlington Heights itself relies on the assumption that\noverdiscrimination is illegal. The issue in Arlington Heights\nwas whether a Chicago suburb’s denial of a rezoning\napplication for construction of an affordable housing complex\nwas racially motivated. Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 259.\nAlthough on the facts of the case the Court held that the\nevidence did not support the Plaintiffs’ allegations that a\ndiscriminatory motive was at work, the Court’s analysis\npresumed that the Plaintiffs would have prevailed if they had\ndemonstrated that Arlington Heights denied the rezoning\napplication in order to limit housing opportunities for\nminorities. See id. at 270. This would have been so even\nthough the racial minorities who were denied housing\nopportunities would not have been treated any worse than the\n\n\nMcWright v. Alexander, 982 F.2d 222, 228 (7th Cir. 1992). The\ndifference between proxy discrimination and facially neutral\noverdiscrimination is merely one of degree. In a case of proxy\ndiscrimination the defendant discriminates against individuals on the basis\nof criteria that are almost exclusively indicators of membership in the\ndisfavored group. By contrast, facially neutral overdiscrimination arises\nwhen the defendant exhibits a willingness to distinguish amongst\nindividuals on the basis of facially neutral criteria, knowing (but\naccepting) that some individuals who are not members of the disfavored\ngroup will suffer alongside the targeted individuals.\n\f34 PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH\n\nlow-income white individuals who would also have been\ndeprived of the same housing opportunities.\n\n    Similarly, in Hunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S. 222 (1985),\nthe Supreme Court unanimously struck down a provision of\nthe Alabama constitution that disenfranchised individuals\nconvicted of crimes involving moral turpitude. The provision\nwas facially neutral because it applied to persons of all races.\nId. at 227. However, there was compelling evidence that the\nprovision was adopted at the turn of the 20th century for the\npurpose of disenfranchising black voters who were convicted\nof such crimes at a far higher rate than white voters.\nAssuming, arguendo, that the disenfranchisement provision\nwould be constitutional if it were passed in modern times\nwithout the intent to discriminate against racial minorities, the\nCourt nonetheless held that because it had been enacted for a\ndiscriminatory purpose it “violates equal protection under\nArlington Heights.” Id. at 233. The 1903 Alabama\nlegislature’s willingness (or intent) to also disenfranchise\nwhite individuals convicted of crimes of moral turpitude was\nirrelevant; all that mattered was that the act “would not have\nbeen adopted . . . in the absence of the racially discriminatory\nmotivation.”24 Id. at 231.\n\n\n\n\n   24\n      The City’s and its amicus’ reliance on United States v. O’Brien,\n391 U.S. 367 (1968), for the proposition that courts may not invalidate a\nlaw that was motivated by animus purely on the basis of the legislature’s\nintent is therefore misplaced. O’Brien does not apply to equal protection\ncases or cases involving statutory anti-discrimination law where the very\nnature of the legal inquiry is whether an action taken by the legislature\nwas motivated by animus. See City of Columbia v. Omni Outdoor\nAdvertising, Inc., 499 U.S. 365, 377 n.6 (1991) (making this point and\nciting Arlington Heights); see also Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc.\n\f     PAC.

City of\nModesto, 583 F.3d at 697. Neighborhoods party to the\nagreement were more likely to be annexed by Modesto at\nsome point in the future. Id. at 703–04. Modesto argued that\nthe excluded neighborhoods could not maintain an intentional\ndiscrimination claim because the excluded communities had\nsignificant white populations, and those white residents\nwould also suffer as a result of the alleged discrimination.\nWe rejected that argument, concluding that the relevant\nquestion was whether the excluded neighborhoods were\ntreated differently because of their overall racial composition,\nnot whether Modesto’s discriminatory actions would affect\nonly racial minorities. See id. at 704. In other words,\nModesto’s willingness to discriminate against both minorities\nand white citizens living in majority-minority communities\ndid not cleanse it of any discriminatory intent that it may have\nharbored.\n\n    Other Circuits have similarly condemned instances of\noverdiscrimination. For example, in Town of Clarkton v.\nNAACP, 682 F.2d 1055 (4th Cir. 1982), the Fourth Circuit\nheld that Clarkton had intentionally discriminated against\nAfrican Americans when it withdrew from a multi-county\n\n\nv.

Rather, because “it is the black population that will\nsuffer . . . in a disproportionate manner,” the town’s actions\nwere still discriminatory. Id. at 1066 (emphasis added).\nSimilarly, in Abdu-Brisson, the Second Circuit held that an\nairline could be guilty of age discrimination if it intentionally\nimposed unfavorable employment conditions upon all of the\nemployees it inherited after its purchase of a competitor\nairline in order to discriminate against the portion of the\ninherited employees who were elderly. 239 F.3d at 467–68.\n\n    Here, the district court relied on Gamble v. City of\nEscondido, 104 F.3d 300 (9th Cir. 1997); Schwarz v. City of\nTreasure Island, 544 F.3d 1201 (11th Cir. 2008); and Oxford\nHouse-C v. City of St. Louis, 77 F.3d 249 (8th Cir. 1996), in\nconcluding that plaintiffs in disparate treatment suits must\nidentify a similarly situated entity. None of these cases\nsupports such a proposition. In Gamble, we relied in part on\nthe absence of a similarly situated entity to dismiss a case\nproceeding under a McDonnell Douglas theory. 104 F.3d at\n305. Gamble therefore has no application here. As to\nSchwarz and Oxford House, both cases, unlike this one,\ninvolved the enforcement of pre-existing, facially neutral\nzoning laws against group homes, and neither case involved\nany suggestion that the zoning laws in question had been\nenacted with a discriminatory purpose. Schwarz, 544 F.3d at\n1206–11, 1216; Oxford House-C, 77 F.3d at 252.\nAccordingly, again, neither case is relevant here.\n\f    PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V.

This precise\nsituation arose shortly thereafter. In Caron Found. of Florida\nInc. v. City of Delray Beach, 879 F.Supp. 2d 1353 (S.D. Fla.\n2012), a district court confronted exactly the circumstances\nforeseen in Schwarz. In Caron, the City of Delray enacted a\nzoning ordinance much like the one in Schwarz, but there was\nevidence that Delray’s ordinance was enacted in reaction to\nan increase in group homes and with the intent to discriminate\nagainst them. Caron, 879 F.Supp. 2d at 1361–63, 1367–70.\nApplying Schwarz, the district court in Caron correctly, in\nour view, determined that the zoning laws in question were\ndiscriminatory in light of their apparent discriminatory\npurpose. The circumstances in Caron are nearly identical to\nthe ones alleged in this case. See also Nevada Fair Housing\nCtr. v. Clark Cnty., 565 F. Supp. 2d 1178 (D.

Taken in\nthe light most favorable to the non-moving party, the\nlegislative history indicates that the Ordinance was enacted\nfor the purpose of eliminating or reducing the number of\ngroup homes throughout the City. The Plaintiffs have come\nforward with statistics, provided by the City, that the\nOrdinance had the effect of reducing group home beds by\n40%. The Plaintiffs also provided evidence that group homes\nwere specifically targeted for enforcement. The City created\na task force to locate group homes, undertake surveillance of\nthem, and enforce the zoning code strictly against them.\n\f38 PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V.

Although the Ordinance,\nunlike the amended Moratorium, was facially neutral, the\nPlaintiffs have provided evidence that it had (and, according\nto Council Member Henn, was designed to have) the same\neffect on group homes as the Moratorium: It ensured as a\npractical matter that no new group homes opened in Newport\nBeach.\n\n    Council Member Henn also promised that the Ordinance\nwould reduce the number of pre-existing group homes. At\nthe same meeting, Council Member Henn explained that the\ndrafters of the Ordinance would have preferred to simply ban\nall group homes, but that only a facially neutral Ordinance\nstood any hope of surviving the anticipated legal challenge.\nIn response to criticism from residents that the Ordinance was\nnot a blunt enough instrument to rapidly expel group homes\nfrom the City, Henn urged the critics to “judge us by our\nactual results.” Nonetheless, because of pressure from\ncitizens who owned short-term lodgings, the City Council\n\f        PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH              39\n\nmade the ordinance narrower than outside counsel, Goldfarb,\nhad initially advised. Goldfarb was fired, and the final\nOrdinance was drafted with the assistance of new counsel\nwho consulted with the CCNB to develop an Ordinance that\napplied to a much narrower selection of facilities. Cf. Church\nof the Lukumi Babulu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialea, 508 U.S.\n508, 538–41 (1993) (describing as a “religious gerrymander”\na city’s enactment of facially neutral regulations regarding\nanimal slaughter that had the (intended) effect of prohibiting\nSanteria worship, while simultaneously permitting exceptions\nthat allowed other types of animal slaughter carried out by\nmore favored groups).25 In short, a jury could find, based on\nthe record before us, that the primary purpose of the\nOrdinance was to shut down group homes and prevent new\nones from opening in Newport Beach, but to do so in facially\nneutral terms to avoid invalidation by a court.26\n\n  25\n      Although Lukumi Babulu was a Free Exercise case, rather than a\nstatutory discrimination challenge under the FHA, the Court’s analysis of\ndiscriminatory intent in Lukumi Babulu was guided in part by the\nArlington Heights factors. Lukumi Babalu, 508 U.S. at 540.\n   26\n      The foregoing account of the City’s legislative motive does not\nexamine the role that City residents’ animus played in bringing about the\nOrdinance. Every public meeting leading up to the City Council’s\nultimate enactment of the Ordinance was marked by angry comments from\ncitizens who referred to the disabled residents of the group homes as\n“criminals,” “gang members,” “druggies,” “not true handicapped” and\nother derogatory terms. The record suggests that City Council members\nwere responsive to the public’s views.\n\n     It is beyond dispute that legislatures may not “defer[] to the\n[discriminatory] wishes or objections of some fraction of the body\npolitic.” City of Cleburne, Texas v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432,\n448 (1985). A jury could certainly infer from this record that private\ncitizens’ “hostility motivated the City in initiating and continuing its\nenforcement efforts.” Tsombanidis, 352 F.3d at 580; see also Metoyer v.\n\f40 PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH\n\n    A jury could also conclude that the Ordinance was\ndesigned to eliminate group homes rather than to serve as a\nneutral amendment to the City’s zoning laws. The Ordinance\namended the definition of “single housekeeping unit” to\nexclude living arrangements in which residents (1) are not all\nsignatories to a single written lease and (2) do not choose\ntheir own housemates. NBMC § 20.03.030. These\ncharacteristics subject group homes, but not vacation homes,\nto a more restrictive zoning regime. To be sure, the\nOrdinance affects adversely some other facilities that are not\ngroup homes. “Group residential” arrangements such as\n“boarding or rooming houses, dormitories, fraternities,\nsororities, and private residential clubs” are now completely\nprohibited in residential zones. NBMC § 20.05.030(C). The\nrecord, however, includes evidence that this aspect of the\nOrdinance has been enforced against few, if any, facilities.\nTherefore it appears either to be the case that very few “group\nresidential” facilities that were not group homes existed when\nthe Ordinance was enacted, or if such facilities existed, the\nCity did not enforce the Ordinance against them. In either\ncase, all group homes were ultimately affected by the\nOrdinance and few other facilities were.\n\n    Finally, the City engaged in three notable procedural\nirregularities leading up to the enactment of the Ordinance.\nFirst, it created an ad hoc committee that met privately and\noff the record, something the City had never done before, to\n\n\n\n\nChasman, 504 F.3d 919, 938 (9th Cir. 2007) (noting that discrimination\narises in the Title VII context when a third-party’s animus “affected” the\ndecisionmaker).\n\f      PAC.

Gov’t Code § 54952.2. This\nappears to be incorrect. Section 54952.2 prohibits private meetings of a\n“majority of members of a legislative body.” Id. The ad hoc committee\nhad three members, whereas the Newport Beach City Council appears to\nhave seven members (one of whom serves as Mayor).                   See\nhttp://www.newportbeachca.gov/index.aspx?page=74 (last visited Oct. 27,\n2012).\n   28\n      The City did not rely on objective measures, such as the number of\nformal police complaints about activities at group homes, as a basis for\nenacting the Ordinance. In fact, a memo from Goldfarb states that\nvacation homes generate more calls to the police than group homes, and\na letter submitted to the City by a group home that is not a plaintiff here\nprovided statistics showing that its facility had generated fewer calls for\nservice than other residential units on the same block and fewer calls for\nservice than had been the case at the same property prior to the opening\nof the group home.\n\f42 PAC.

The City\nfails to appreciate that it was the imposition of the Ordinance\nitself that triggered the Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries. We have\nrecognized that it is unlawful discrimination to subject\nindividuals to “the rigors of the governmental or\nadministrative process . . . with an intent to burden, hinder, or\npunish them by reason of their [membership in a protected\nclass.]” Flores v. Pierce, 617 F.2d 1396, 1391 (9th Cir.\n1980) (Kennedy, J.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 875 (1980).\n\n    That is what is alleged to have happened here. Prior to\nthe Ordinance, group homes were classified as single\nhousekeeping units and therefore were able to operate freely\nin residential zones, subject only to the restrictions that\ngoverned other residences. After the Ordinance’s enactment,\nhowever, every group home was required to submit a detailed\napplication for a special use permit and/or reasonable\naccommodation in order to continue operating and to attend\n\n\n 29\n    For similar reasons, we also agree with the Plaintiffs that they created\na triable issue of fact with respect to their discriminatory enforcement\nclaims. The evidence that the Ordinance was enacted with discriminatory\nintent also provides support for the Plaintiffs’ claim that the City’s\nenforcement strategy was similarly calculated to accomplish a\ndiscriminatory goal, as does the City’s actual enforcement strategy.\n\f      PAC.

See Flores,\n617 F.2d at 1391. This would be true even if such permits\nwere granted freely, which is decidedly not the case here.\n\n    Plaintiffs have introduced evidence that the Ordinance\nhad at least two kinds of adverse effects upon them, either of\nwhich would be sufficient to allow them to maintain an action\nunder the FHA or ADA. First, the unrebutted evidence shows\nthat the Group Homes expended substantial time, effort, and\nresources applying for special use permits and reasonable\naccommodations, none of which would have been necessary\nhad the Ordinance not been enacted. See, e.g., Walker,\n272 F.3d at 1124–25 (staff time spent responding to\nintentionally discriminatory actions by a municipality is an\ninjury sufficient to confer standing under the FHA and\nFEHA). Second, Plaintiffs have produced evidence that the\nOrdinance led to the closure of approximately one third of the\nCity’s Group Homes and barred new group homes from being\nestablished in all but multi-family residential zones. This\nresulted in a reduced diversity of housing options for the\ndisabled individuals served by group homes. See Olmstead\n\n\n 30\n    Although the reasonable accommodation process ostensibly allowed\nexceptions to the City’s zoning policy that would be consistent with state\nand federal anti-discrimination laws, it was as complex, time-consuming,\nand restrictive as the special use permit process.

For these reasons, the City’s waiver\nargument based upon the fact that the Group Homes no\nlonger challenge the City’s denial of their permit applications\nis irrelevant. The Plaintiffs show they were harmed by the\nimposition of the discriminatory permit regime, and this is\nmore than sufficient for them to maintain a claim for\ndisparate treatment based upon the imposition of the permit\nrequirement itself.31\n\n    The City’s argument that the Plaintiffs cannot use\nstatistical evidence to demonstrate that the Ordinance\ndiscriminated against them simply because they voluntarily\ndismissed their disparate impact claims is also unavailing.\nFirst, the City misdescribes the posture of this case. The\nPlaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claim to injunctive relief\nunder a disparate impact theory, but did not dismiss their\nclaims to damages under that theory. Those damages claims\nwere dismissed by the district court in the second summary\njudgment order relating to damages, and the Plaintiffs have\nappealed that ruling.

According to the City, Pacific Shores did not suffer\nany adverse effects as a result of the Ordinance because it was granted a\nreasonable accommodation for twelve beds. This argument suffers from\nthe same defect: the very requirement to apply for a reasonable\naccommodation adversely affected Pacific Shores. Just as plaintiffs in a\ndiscrimination action need not have applied for a permit in order to allege\nthat a permit requirement is discriminatory, see City of Modesto, 583 F.3d\nat 705 n.7, so too may plaintiffs challenge a discriminatory permit regime\neven if they begrudgingly apply for a permit in order to minimize the harm\nthey suffer under that regime.\n\f     PAC.

As we explained in\nConvoy Company, “[t]he issue is not whether [the Plaintiffs]\nwould have paid the [employees’] salaries” absent the\ndefendant’s wrongdoing, but, rather, whether the Plaintiffs\nwere “deprived of the services [they] paid for” because of the\nneed for the employees to divert their attention to minimize\nthe damage from the defendant’s misconduct. 672 F.2d at\n785. The staff time spent preparing and presenting permit\n\f     PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH         47\n\napplications under the Ordinance would have otherwise been\nspent promoting the Group Homes’ business and serving their\nresidents. This diversion of time therefore represents a loss\nfor which the Group Homes may recover. Walker, 272 F.3d\nat 1124–25.\n\n    The Group Homes may also recover the legal costs they\nspent preparing their permit and reasonable use applications\nand presenting those applications before City hearing officers\nand the City Council. The district court’s conclusion that\nsuch costs were “better resolved” through an application for\nattorney’s fees was, therefore, erroneous. We have held that\nattorney’s fees may be recovered as damages in a civil rights\naction where the fees were necessary to obtain a permit in a\nproceeding that only occurred as a result of city officials’\ndiscriminatory animus. See Flores, 617 F.2d at 1392 (9th Cir.\n1980); accord Sherwin Manor Nursing Ctr. v. McAuliffe,\n37 F.3d 1216, 1221–22 (7th Cir. 1994). In Flores, Judge\n(now Justice) Kennedy upheld an award of attorney’s fees, as\ndamages, to § 1983 plaintiffs for the legal services necessary\nto combat the city’s challenge to the plaintiffs’ liquor license\napplication where city officials had deliberately delayed the\napplication because of racial animus. 617 F.2d at 1388, 1392;\nsee also Barlow v. Ground, 943 F.2d 1132, 1136 (9th Cir.\n1991) (holding that a § 1983 plaintiff could recover attorney’s\nfees as damages where those fees were incurred defending\nagainst criminal charges that directly resulted from the\ndefendant police officer’s wrongful arrest of the plaintiff).\nJust as the plaintiffs in Flores and Barlow were entitled to\nattorneys fees spent combating wrongfully instituted legal\nproceedings, so too may the Group Homes here recover the\nattorney’s fees necessary to comply with the use permit\nrequirement that the City imposed for an allegedly\ndiscriminatory reason.\n\f48 PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH\n\n                               B\n\n    The district court acknowledged that the Group Homes\nexperienced a dramatic decline in business shortly after the\nenactment of the Ordinance. It found, however, that the\nPlaintiffs did not adequately raise a triable issue of fact as to\nwhether the City’s actions caused these business losses. In\nreaching this determination, the district court misapplied\nwell-established principles of causation and failed to draw\nevery inference in the Group Homes’ favor, as it was required\nto do at the summary judgment stage.\n\n    We begin with the principle that a “damages action under\nthe FHA sounds basically in tort—the statute merely defines\na new legal duty, and authorizes the courts to compensate a\nplaintiff for the injury caused by the defendant’s wrongful\nbreach.” Garcia v. Brockway, 526 F.3d 456, 464 (9th Cir.\n2008) (en banc) (brackets omitted) (quoting Curtis v. Loether,\n415 U.S. 189, 195 (1974)); see also Henrietta D v.\nBloomberg, 331 F.3d 261, 278–79 (2d Cir. 2003) (applying\ncommon law tort principles of causation to the ADA).\nAccordingly, general tort principles of causation usually\ngovern statutory discrimination cases except when there is a\nstatutory command to the contrary. See, e.g., Silver Sage\nPartners v. City of Desert Hot Springs, 251 F.3d 814, 819–21,\n824–25 (9th Cir. 2001) (applying general tort principles to the\ncalculation of damages under the FHA); Samaritan Inns, Inc.\nv. District of Columbia, 114 F.3d 1227, 1234–35 (D.C. Cir.\n1997) (same).\n\n    At tort, plaintiffs bear the burden of demonstrating that\nthe defendant’s conduct caused some harm suffered by the\nplaintiffs. However, the plaintiffs are “not required to\neliminate entirely all possibility that the defendant’s conduct\n\f       PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH                       49\n\nwas not a cause. It is enough that [they] introduce[] evidence\nfrom which reasonable men may conclude that it is more\nprobable that the event was caused by the defendant than that\nit is not.” Restatement (Second) of Torts § 433B, cmt. b\n(1965) (hereinafter “Restatement”). Moreover, “[t]he\nplaintiff doesn’t have to prove a series of negatives; he\ndoesn’t have to ‘offer evidence which positively excludes[s]\nevery other possible cause of the accident.’” BCS Servs., Inc.\nv. Heartwood 88, LLC, 637 F.3d 750, 757 (7th Cir. 2011)\n(quoting Carlson v. Chisholm-Moore Hoist Corp., 281 F.2d\n766, 770 (2d Cir. 1960) (Friendly, J.)), cert. denied,\n132 S. Ct. 253 (2011). Rather, plaintiffs can demonstrate\ncausation by proving that the defendant’s wrongful conduct\nwas a “substantial factor” in bringing about the harm in\nquestion. Restatement § 431(a); see also Benefiel v. Exxon\nCorp., 959 F.2d 805, 807 (9th Cir. 1992) (describing the\n“substantial factor” test as a “uniformly accepted principle[]\nof tort law”). The doctrine of proximate cause serves merely\nto protect defendants from unforeseeable results of their\nnegligence when “too many unexpected things [have]\nhappen[ed] between the defendant’s wrongdoing and the\nplaintiff’s injury.”32 BCS Services, 637 F.3d at 754.\n\n\n\n\n  32\n    The fact that FHA plaintiffs’ injuries must be proximately caused by\nthe defendant’s discriminatory acts does not, of course, mean that\ndefendants are not liable for foreseeable, but indirect, effects of\ndiscrimination. For example, in Silver Sage we held that a city that\nwrongfully withheld its approval of a fair housing project could be held\nliable not just to the developers of the project for their lost profits, but also\nto a real estate broker and a businessman who, respectively, did not\nreceive broker’s fees and syndication fees that would have been paid had\nthe project gone forward. 251 F.3d at 822–23; see also San Pedro Hotel\nCo., 159 F.3d at 475.\n\f50 PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH\n\n     Causation is an intensely factual question that should\ntypically be resolved by a jury. See, e.g., White v. Roper,\n901 F.2d 1501, 1505–06 (9th Cir. 1990) (citing W. Prosser &\nW. Keeton, The Law of Torts, §§ 41, 42, 45 (5th ed. 1984));\nRestatement § 434(2). Juries are expected to rely on their\ncommon sense in resolving questions of causation. Indeed,\nit is jurors’ “common experience of living on a populated\nplanet” that renders them at least as reliable, if not more so,\nthan a single judge at assessing issues of causation. David W.\nRobertson, The Common Sense of Cause In Fact, 75 Tex. L.\nRev. 1765, 1769 (1997). As the Seventh Circuit has\nrecognized, “[o]nce a plaintiff presents evidence that he\nsuffered the sort of injury that would be the expected\nconsequence of the defendant’s wrongful conduct, he has\ndone enough to withstand summary judgment on the ground\nof absence of causation.” BCS Services, 637 F.3d at 758.\nContrary to the Plaintiffs’ suggestion, these principles are not\na matter of burden-shifting—plaintiffs always bear the burden\nof proving that the defendant’s actions caused their\ninjuries—but rather a simple recognition that making\nreasonable inferences about causation is one of the things that\njuries do best.\n\n    We applied these principles in Mead v. Retail Clerks Int’l\nAssoc., Local Union No. 839, 523 F.2d 1371 (9th Cir. 1975),\nwhen we held that a trier of fact could infer that a union’s\nillegal strike had “materially contributed” to the employer’s\nlost sales (and therefore was a substantial factor in bringing\nthe loss about) because the “injury alleged . . . was precisely\nthe type of loss that the claimed violations . . . would be likely\nto cause.” Id. at 1378 (quoting Zenith Radio Corp. v.\nHazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 125 (1969)). This\nwas so even though the union, much like the City in this case,\nargued that it was equally likely that the lost sales were\n\f     PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH          51\n\nattributable to adverse business conditions and negative\npublicity regarding the employer’s labor practices. Id. at\n1376.\n\n    Although Mead drew this principle from cases arising in\nthe anti-trust context, we recognized that these anti-trust cases\nmerely “incorporat[e] common law principles of causation,”\nalbeit with appropriate modifications. Id. Further, just as in\nMead, here, there is “an exact parallel between the problem\nfaced by a plaintiff attempting to show that lost profits\nresulted from anti-competitive activity rather than from other\nfactors affecting the business,” and the problem faced by the\nGroup homes in attempting to prove that their losses were\ncaused by the defendant’s alleged intentional discrimination.\nId. at 1378. In both kinds of cases, “damage issues . . . are\nrarely susceptible of the kind of concrete, detailed proof of\ninjury which is available in other contexts.” Id. at 1377\n(quoting Zenith Radio Corp., 395 U.S. at 123.)\n\n     Here, as in Mead, we ask not whether the Group Homes\nhave proven that all of their business losses were attributable\nto the Ordinance’s enactment and enforcement, but rather, we\nexamine whether they created a triable issue of fact that the\nCity’s actions “materially contributed” to these losses.\nAlthough the City and the district court are correct that the\nGroup Homes did not submit declarations from particular\nresidents stating that they left because of the City’s actions,\nthere was no requirement that they do so. Drawing all\ninferences in the Group Homes’ favor as we are required to\ndo, we conclude that they submitted ample evidence that the\nCity contributed to their losses.\n\n   Just like the employer in Mead, the Group Homes\nsubmitted evidence that their business declined and that the\n\f52 PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH\n\nresulting losses were both a predictable, and desired, result of\nthe City’s actions. The Group Homes’ managers stated that\nthey attract new residents primarily through referrals from\ncare providers and their websites. There was evidence that\nboth referral sources were affected by the Ordinance. The\nCity’s enforcement of the Ordinance was widely publicized\nin the care provider community and “[f]ew counselors and\ntherapists wanted to refer their clients to [the Group Homes]\nbecause of the City’s actions” as a result. NCR’s manager\ndescribed its referrals as “dr[ying] up completely” after the\nCity’s second denial of its permit application. The managers\nalso explained that “our internet presence was drowned out\nby other web pages concerning the City’s actions.” In\naddition, current and prospective residents expressed concern\nto the managers about whether the Group Homes would\nclose. A jury could infer from these facts that prospective\nresidents were not referred to or deliberately stayed away\nfrom the Group Homes, and opted to reside elsewhere, as a\nresult of the Ordinance’s enactment and enforcement, without\nhearing any particular individual testify that he did so.\n\n    Indeed, prior to taking the opposite stance in litigation,\ncity officials themselves credited the Ordinance with harming\ngroup homes. At a public meeting, Kiff stated that the\nOrdinance had been responsible for a reduction in bed counts\nof as much as 40% and described it as a key step to\n“bring[ing] owner-occupied back.”           In enacting the\nOrdinance, Council Member Henn promised City residents\nthat it would “result in a substantial reduction in the\nnumber of group homes on the Peninsula” and asked to be\n“judge[d] . . . by our actual results.”\n\n   Each of the Group Homes presented evidence that it\nexperienced a precipitous decline in business after the\n\f       PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH                 53\n\npassage of the Ordinance. Yellowstone’s revenues declined\nover 50% between 2007 and 2009. NCR’s dropped over 40%\nbetween 2007 and 2008; it closed in 2009 due to insufficient\nbusiness.33 Pacific Shores’ business also declined nearly 50%\nin 2008. Furthermore, it served fewer residents than it\notherwise would have due to the 12-bed occupancy limitation\nit accepted in order to secure approval of its reasonable\naccommodation application.34\n\n    In sum, a jury could easily infer that the City’s actions\nmaterially contributed to the Group Homes’ losses. The\nmanagers all stated that the Ordinance’s enactment and\nenforcement led to reduced referrals, evidence showed that\nclosing group homes was one of the Ordinance’s primary\ngoals, and the Group Homes’ revenues plummeted in the\nimmediate aftermath of the Ordinance’s enactment.\n\n   This conclusion is not altered by the fact that some of the\nnegative publicity about the Group Homes, which may have\ncontributed to their business losses, was generated by the\nCCNB and other third-party sources. At least some of the\nnegative publicity that allegedly harmed the Group Homes’\n\n 33\n    The City also argues that because NCR’s permit application was not\nfinally denied until January 2009, it could not have suffered any losses\nprior to that time. This argument is simply wrong. A jury could certainly\nconclude that the threat of eventual closure contributed to NCR’s decline\nin business even prior to the final denial of its permit application.\n  34\n     There is no merit to the City’s contention that these losses are not\nrecoverable because Pacific Shores itself requested the 12-bed limitation.\nThis argument disregards the fact that Pacific Shores’ request for a 12-bed\nlimitation was a result of the Hearing Officer’s two prior denials of its\nrequest for an 18-bed reasonable accommodation. In any event, as we\nhave already explained, no such limitation would have applied if the City\nhad not adopted the Ordinance in the first place.\n\f54 PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH\n\nbusinesses was generated by the City itself, including on its\nown website and in a letter circulated to all residents of\nNewport Beach. In addition, the press coverage from third-\nparty sources was a foreseeable result of the enactment and\nenforcement of the Ordinance, and therefore a jury could find\nthat it was proximately caused by the City. See Restatement\n§§ 431, 440, 441, 442A; see also Farr v. NC Mach. Co.,\n186 F.3d 1165, 1169–70 (9th Cir. 1999) (applying the\nRestatement); Johnson v. Duffy, 588 F.2d 740, 743–44 (9th\nCir. 1978). In other words, the Group Homes have produced\nsufficient evidence that “the [discriminatory] policy at issue\nand the particular injury alleged are not only closely related,\nthey are cause and effect.” Harper v. City of Los Angeles,\n533 F.3d 1010, 1027 (9th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks\nand citation omitted).\n\n    Given that a jury could conclude that the City materially\ncontributed to the Group Homes’ decline in business, the\nGroup Homes were not obligated to prove their losses with\nprecision. As the Supreme Court has explained:\n\n       Where the tort itself is of such a nature as to\n       preclude the ascertainment of the amount of\n       damages with certainty it would be a\n       perversion of fundamental principles of\n       justice to deny all relief to the injured person,\n       and thereby relieve the wrongdoer from\n       making any amend for his acts. In such case,\n       while the damages may not be determined by\n       mere speculation or guess, it will be enough if\n       the evidence show the extent of the damages\n       as a matter of just and reasonable inference,\n       although the result be only approximate.\n\f     PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH          55\n\nStory Parchment Co. v. Paterson Parchment Paper Co.,\n282 U.S. 555, 563 (1931); see BCS Services, 637 F.3d at 759.\nThe City argues that this principle is confined to the anti-trust\ncontext, but this view is undermined by cases from this court\nand others. The D.C. Circuit has described Story Parchment\nas a “seminal” case that “states the American rule on\ndamages,” Hill v. Iraq, 328 F.3d 680, 684 (D.C. Cir. 2003),\nand it has been relied on to lower plaintiffs’ burden of proof\nregarding the quantum of damages in FHA cases, see Silver\nSage, 251 F.3d at 820 n.6; Samaritan, 114 F.3d at 1235, and\nin countless other statutory tort-like contexts. See, e.g., Hill,\n328 F.3d at 684 (Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act); Fidelity\nInterior Const., Inc. v. S.E. Carpenters Reg’l Council of\nUnited Bhd. of Carpenters and Joiners, 675 F.3d 1250,\n1264–65 (11th Cir. 2012) (Labor Management Relations\nAct); Comcast of Illinois X v. Multi-Vision Elec., Inc.,\n491 F.3d 938, 947 (8th Cir. 2007) (Cable Communications\nPolicy Act); Yonkers Branch-N.A.A.C.P. v.

Because the Group Homes submitted ample\nevidence from which a jury could infer that they lost some\nbusiness as a result of the Ordinance, a jury would be entitled\nto determine the precise quantum of damages by drawing\n“just and reasonable” inferences from the evidence, given that\nthe City’s enactment of the Ordinance was an act that\n“preclude[d] the ascertainment” of what portion of the Group\n\f56 PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH\n\nHomes’ decline in business was attributable to other causes.35\nStory Parchment, 282 U.S. at 563; see, e.g., Gilchrist v. Jim\nSlemons Imports, Inc., 803 F.2d 1488, 1501 (9th Cir. 1986)\n(holding that a jury reasonably estimated a terminated\nemployee’s lost commissions by relying on the commissions\nhe earned the previous year, even though that year had been\nabnormally profitable).\n\n                                    C\n\n    For similar reasons, the Group Homes also created a\ntriable issue of fact regarding causation as to the expenses\nthey incurred contacting referral sources and advertising to\ncombat the widespread impression that the City was forcing\nthem to close. The Group Homes’ managers each testified\nthat they expended substantial amounts of time combating the\nperception that they were on the verge of closure. As we\nexplained above, diverted staff time is a compensable harm\nunder the FHA and ADA. As to causation, the managers\nthemselves explained that their promotional efforts were not\nundertaken because of a general, unexplained, drop in\nbusiness, but rather because their referral sources were\nconcerned whether they could remain open and provide a\nhealthy atmosphere as a result of the Ordinance. Similarly,\nPacific Shores increased its advertising expenditures in 2008\nfor the purpose of “inform[ing] the public that its Newport\nBeach houses were open and provided a safe place for sober\nliving.” In addition, Pacific Shores and NCR each hired a\nweb consultant to assist them with promoting their presence\non the internet because publicity surrounding the City’s\n\n\n 35\n    The City, of course, would be free at trial to present proof to the jury\nthat a significant portion of the Group Homes’ losses were attributable to\nother causes such as the downturn in the economy.\n\f     PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH           57\n\nenforcement efforts appeared prominently in response to\ninternet searches. The Group Homes’ managers’ testimony,\nwhich a reasonable jury could certainly credit, creates a\ntriable issue of fact as to whether these expenses were\nincurred as a result of the Ordinance and the district court\nclearly erred in concluding otherwise.\n\n                               D\n\n    Finally, the individual Plaintiffs also challenge the district\ncourt’s dismissal of their damages claims for emotional\ndistress. Damages are available under the FHA for any\nunusual level of anxiety, embarrassment, or humiliation\nsuffered by plaintiffs as a result of a defendant’s\ndiscriminatory actions, and a plaintiff’s testimony is\nsufficient to create a triable issue of fact as to such emotional\ndistress. See 24 C.F.R. § 180.670(b)(3)(i) (HUD regulations\nrecognizing availability of damages for “humiliation and\nembarrassment”); see also Krueger v. Cuomo, 115 F.3d 487,\n492 (7th Cir. 1997) (tenant’s testimony sufficient to establish\nFHA liability for emotional distress where her landlord’s\ndiscriminatory actions made her “feel ‘real dirty,’ ‘like a bad\nperson,’ and ‘scared’ her”); Banai v.

SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH\n\n    Wiseman, a resident at Pacific Shores, testified at his\ndeposition that he experienced anxiety as a result of Pacific\nShores’ potential closure. The anxiety was sufficiently acute\nthat he visited a doctor and was prescribed medication to\nmanage his symptoms. This testimony created a triable issue\nof fact as to whether he suffered compensable emotional\ndistress. The City argues that Wiseman waived his damages\nclaim based on statements made at his deposition that he did\nnot believe the City owed him damages. In context, those\nstatements constitute an expression of Wiseman’s resentment\ntowards the City rather than a “voluntary, deliberate, and\ninformed” declaration of waiver. See Stroman v. West Coast\nGrocery Co., 884 F.2d 458, 462 (9th Cir. 1989) (recognizing\nthat waivers of civil rights claims must be “voluntary,\ndeliberate, and informed” (citation omitted)).\n\n    We agree with the district court, however, that Bridgeman\ndid not create a triable issue of fact as to whether she suffered\ncompensable emotional distress. Bridgeman—a resident at\nPacific Shores—stated only that she was “kind of upset”\nabout the possible closure of Pacific Shores. However, she\nalso stated that she did not feel any stress as a result.\nAlthough an FHA plaintiff can certainly recover for distress,\neven if that distress does not physically manifest itself or\nnecessitate pscyhological counseling, Bridgeman’s mild\nannoyance at the Ordinance is insufficient to support a claim\nfor emotional distress damages.\n\n                        CONCLUSION\n\n    For the foregoing reasons we reverse the district court’s\ndismissal of the Plaintiffs’ disparate treatment claims.

Even in the few areas where they were\npermitted to open, new group homes were required to submit\nto a permit process. Existing group homes also had to\nundergo the same permit process in order to continue their\noperations. Among the factors to be considered when\ngranting or denying a permit to any group home was the\nnumber of other such facilities in the neighborhood.\n\n    On its face, the Ordinance did not single out group\nhomes; persons recovering from addiction are protected from\nhousing discrimination under state and federal anti-\ndiscrimination laws. Instead, the Ordinance facially imposed\nrestrictions on some other types of group living arrangements\nas well. At the same time, the City did not impose similar\n\n\n  1\n    We follow the parties’ convention in referring to addiction recovery\nfacilities as “group homes.” The term “group homes” is not defined in the\nOrdinance or in any relevant statute, however. As used by the parties and\nin this opinion, the term refers only to addiction recovery facilities and not\nto any other sort of communal living arrangement.\n\f6   PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH\n\nregulations on properties rented by homeowners to\nvacationing tourists, despite the fact that such rental\nproperties may cause similar social problems as group homes.\nOn advice of counsel, the City had initially planned to\nregulate such rental properties in order to avoid the\nappearance of discriminating against group homes, but it\nbacked down from doing so in the face of opposition from a\nnumber of City residents.\n\n    Taken in the light most favorable to the non-moving\nparty, Plaintiffs’ evidence shows that the City’s purpose in\nenacting the Ordinance was to exclude group homes from\nmost residential districts and to bring about the closure of\nexisting group homes in those areas. The evidence also\nshows that the Ordinance regulated other types of group\nresidential arrangements primarily for the purpose of\nmaintaining a veneer of neutrality. Several existing group\nhomes, which, as a result of the Ordinance, were required to\napply for a use permit in order to continue operating in\nresidential areas, sued the City, alleging that the Ordinance\ndiscriminated against them as facilities that provide housing\nopportunities for disabled individuals recovering from\naddiction. The district court acknowledged the evidence that\nthe City acted with a discriminatory motive but found that\nevidence “irrelevant” because, it stated, the City had not\ntreated group homes any worse than certain other group\nliving arrangements.\n\n    We reverse and hold that the district court erred in\ndisregarding the evidence that the City’s sole objective in\nenacting and enforcing its Ordinance was to discriminate\nagainst persons deemed to be disabled under state and federal\nhousing discrimination laws. Although plaintiffs in an anti-\ndiscrimination lawsuit may survive summary judgment by\n\f     PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH            7\n\nidentifying similarly situated individuals who were treated\nbetter than themselves, this is not the only way to\ndemonstrate that intentional discrimination has occurred.\nWhere, as here, there is direct or circumstantial evidence that\nthe defendant has acted with a discriminatory purpose and has\ncaused harm to members of a protected class, such evidence\nis sufficient to permit the protected individuals to proceed to\ntrial under a disparate treatment theory. This is no less true\nwhere, as here, the defendant is willing to harm certain\nsimilarly-situated individuals who are not members of the\ndisfavored group in order to accomplish a discriminatory\nobjective, while preserving the appearance of neutrality.\n\n    We also hold that the district court erred in concluding\nthat the Plaintiffs failed to create a triable issue of fact as to\nwhether the losses that their businesses suffered were caused\nby the enactment and enforcement of the Ordinance. The\nPlaintiffs presented evidence that they experienced a\nsignificant decline in business after the Ordinance’s\nenactment, that the publicity surrounding the Ordinance\ngreatly reduced referrals, and that current and prospective\nresidents expressed concern about whether the group home\nPlaintiffs would close. By requiring the Plaintiffs to prove\nmore, the district court failed to draw all reasonable\ninferences in their favor, as it was required to do at summary\njudgment. In addition, we hold that the costs borne by the\nPlaintiffs to present their permit applications and the costs\nspent assuring the public that they were still operating despite\nthe City’s efforts to close them are compensable. Finally, we\nhold that the district court erred in dismissing Plaintiff\nWiseman’s claim for emotional distress, but correctly\ndismissed Plaintiff Bridgeman’s similar claim.\n\f8       PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH\n\n                    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n                                   I\n\n    Newport Beach (“the City”) is a Southern California\nbeachfront community with about 80,000 residents and is one\nof the wealthiest cities in the United States.2 In the late 1990s\n“group homes” began opening in increasing numbers in the\nCity, particularly in the beachfront neighborhoods of West\nNewport and Balboa Park. Group homes are residential\nfacilities in which individuals recovering from drug and\nalcohol addiction temporarily reside. They provide a\ncommunal living environment in which residents help each\nother to recover from their addictions. In order to preserve a\nsubstance-free environment, group homes limit occupancy to\npersons who are sober; a resident who uses drugs or alcohol\nis immediately evicted. Because individuals recovering from\naddiction need to stay for varying lengths of time, they do not\ntypically sign written leases. Typically, group home\noperators meet with and screen potential residents in advance\nto ensure that they are serious about pursuing a sober\nlifestyle.\n\n    By April 2007, the City contained 73 group homes, 48 of\nwhich were licensed treatment facilities and 25 of which were\nunlicensed sober houses.3 At that time the City also had 801\n\n\n    2\n    It is also the setting for the popular television show The O.C., now\nplaying on secondary runs. Also currently showing on Netflix is Arrested\nDevelopment.\n    3\n   There are two types of group homes. Unlicensed “sober houses,” also\nknown as “sober living homes,” are group homes occupied by persons in\nrecovery with no formal substance abuse treatment program. Licensed\n\f     PAC.

These homes are usually rented for\nprofit for a period of 30 days or fewer to tourists who elect\nNewport Beach as a beach vacation destination. Like group\nhomes, short-term lodgings cater to a revolving clientele that\ncan cause strains on neighborhood resources. In Newport\nBeach, “short term lodgings” are generally referred to as\n“vacation homes,” and we use the terms interchangeably.\n\n    The three group home Plaintiffs, Pacific Shores Properties\nLLC (“Pacific Shores”), Newport Coast Recovery LLC\n(“NCR”), and Yellowstone Women’s First Step House, Inc.\n(“Yellowstone”) (collectively, “the Group Homes”) were part\nof the influx of group homes into Newport Beach during the\nmid-to-late 1990s and the early 2000s. The individual\nPlaintiffs are, respectively, one of the owners and two former\nresidents of Pacific Shores. Pacific Shores and Yellowstone\noperate unlicensed sober houses, while NCR is a state-\nlicensed facility. Each Group Home spent hundreds of\nthousands of dollars purchasing and renovating the homes it\noperates.\n\n    The increasing number of group homes in Newport Beach\ngenerated escalating hostility on the part of some City\nresidents who, in a series of public meetings, repeatedly\ndescribed the persons in recovery as “not true handicapped,”\n“criminals,” “gang members,” and “druggies,” among other\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia Alcohol and Drug Program (“ADP”) facilities, by contrast,\nprovide substance abuse treatment on site.\n\f10 PAC.

Because the City’s intent in passing these\nmeasures is central to this appeal, we recount their history in\ndetail.\n\n                                    II\n\n    The City’s attempts to formally address group homes\nbegan at a City Council meeting on January 23, 2007. At that\nmeeting, members of the public expressed their displeasure\nwith group homes and submitted a petition signed by 88\nresidents asking the City Council to address the issue.\nShortly before that meeting, in an email to a concerned\ncitizen, then-Mayor Rosansky wrote, “I suspect that these\n[group home] facilities do nothing to really solve the problem\nbut only serve as wherehouses [sic] for alcoholics and drug\naddicts until they really hit bottom.”\n\n     The City Council decided to form an Intense Residential\nOccupancy Committee (“IROC”) “to review and understand\nthe state and federal laws and regulations that limit [the]\nCity’s ability to regulate” and “to research and identify\nsolutions to the problems and make . . . recommendations to\nthe [C]ity [C]ouncil for changes to regulations applicable to\nall residential uses in a manner that preserves the residential\n\n\n  4\n   One City resident described the attitude in Newport Beach towards\ngroup homes in particularly stark terms: “the idea of the guys with torches\nand pitchforks coming off the bridge is much closer to the sentiment [in\none neighborhood] than the oh, ho-hum we want to help some poor\ndruggy for the tenth time go through the system.”\n\f     PAC.

Craig Batley, a realtor and a member of the\nIROC, e-mailed City Council members to express the view\nthat “the focus needs to be on Group Homes and only Group\nHomes.” At a City Council meeting on April 24, 2007,\ncitizens submitted a 400-signature petition against including\nshort term lodgings in the moratorium. The City nevertheless\nenacted the moratorium as drafted. In a newspaper article\npublished shortly thereafter, the City Attorney expressed the\nview that regulating only group homes would be\ndiscriminatory absent a showing that they caused different\nsocial problems than short-term lodgings.\n\n    In order to demonstrate that group homes did cause\ndifferent social problems than vacation homes, the City\nconducted a citizen survey on the respective impacts of each\ntype of housing. The City had never conducted a survey in\nconnection with legislation before. The survey was\ndistributed to four neighborhoods, three of which were the\n“[n]eighborhoods that seemed to generate the most\ncomplaints about [group homes].” One citizen opposed to\ngroup homes had one hundred surveys left on her doorstep to\npersonally distribute.\n\f12 PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH\n\n    The City Attorney prepared a report summarizing the 47\nsurvey responses the City received and recommending that\nthe City Council lift the moratorium with respect to vacation\nhomes. The City Attorney’s report also suggested amending\nthe City Code to separately address problems caused by\nshort-term lodgings, although the proposed amendments were\nnever enacted. On May 30, 2007, the City Council passed\nOrdinance 2007-10 (“the revised Moratorium”), which\nfollowed the report’s recommendation to lift the freeze on\nshort-term lodging permits, but continued to prohibit new\ngroup homes. The revised Moratorium was renewed for an\nadditional year on October 30, 2007. The district court found\nthat the revised Moratorium was facially discriminatory\nbecause it singled out group homes for adverse treatment.\n\n    Around spring or fall of 2007, the City created an\n“Interdepartmental Group Homes Task Force,” headed by\nAssistant City Manager David Kiff to “verify” the number\nand location of group homes in the City, and to enforce code\nviolations against them, including violations of the then-\napplicable moratorium. The City hired James Sinasek to\nwork with Kiff. During the second half of 2007, Sinasek\ninvestigated group homes by searching the internet to locate\nthem and posing as a potential client. He visited suspected\ngroup home sites, observed the properties, and photographed\nresidents, vehicles, and license plates at or around the\nproperties. Both Kiff and Sinasek attended meetings at the\nhomes of members of the Concerned Citizens of Newport\nBeach (“CCNB”), a citizen advocacy group opposed to group\nhomes, at which CCNB members provided lists of additional\nsuspected group home sites for Kiff and Sinasek to\n\f     PAC.

At a Planning Commission meeting\non June 21, 2007, the City Planner and outside counsel,\nGoldfarb & Lipman (“Goldfarb”) presented a draft ordinance\nto the Commission. The draft regulated both group homes\nand short-term lodgings because Goldfarb advised that doing\nso was necessary to avoid enacting an unlawful\ndiscriminatory ordinance. Commissioner Toerge, a member\nof the IROC, argued that the City needed to “be more\naggressive” because it was “inundated” with group homes; he\nendorsed an alternate draft prepared by attorneys employed\nby the CCNB.          Goldfarb subsequently prepared a\nmemorandum explaining why the CCNB’s proposed\nordinance would be discriminatory.\n\n    Nonetheless, the City Planner prepared a revised\nordinance that did not regulate short-term lodgings. On\nSeptember 20, 2007, an attorney from Goldfarb testified to\nthe City Council that not regulating vacation homes might\nraise concerns about discrimination, and stated that “[t]here\nare still other non-conforming uses that are not necessarily\nresidential care facilities [i.e., group homes]. We seem to not\nknow exactly how many of those there are . . . but I think you\ngrasp the situation that it does—it does change the overall\nimpression.” Most public comments from City residents\nexpressed frustration that the Commission had rejected as\nfacially discriminatory the CCNB’s more aggressive\n\n  5\n    These lists included the meeting sites for members of Alcoholics\nAnonymous and Narcotics Anonymous.\n\f14 PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH\n\nordinance.   Commissioner Toerge suggested that the\nCommission should not be considering legal discrimination\nconcerns: “I mean save that for the courtroom.” The\nPlanning Commission approved the revised draft.\n\n    While the Planning Commission was considering drafts\nof the Ordinance, the City Council formed an Ad Hoc\nCommittee on Group Residential Legal Review whose sole\npurpose was to replace Goldfarb, the firm advising the City\nthat failure to regulate short-term lodgings would be\ndiscriminatory, with new special counsel. This Committee’s\nwork resulted in the city hiring new counsel, Richards,\nWatson, & Gershon PC, the firm that represents the City in\nthis appeal.\n\n    On October 9, 2007, the City Council formed an\nadditional Ad Hoc Committee on Group Residential Uses to\nwork with new counsel on revising the draft ordinance that\nhad been recommended by the Planning Commission. The\ncommittee was chaired by Council Member Henn and\nincluded two other council members. No such Committee\nhad ever been formed by the city before and its meetings\nwere not open to the public.\n\n    On January 8, 2008, the Committee proposed another\ndraft ordinance to the City Council. Unlike the draft\napproved by the Planning Commission, this one provided that\nhearing officers who were to adjudicate group homes’ use\npermit applications were to consider as a factor the\nconcentration of group homes in the neighborhood. Council\nMember Henn defended the Ordinance against residents who\nwanted to limit the density of group homes even more\nexplicitly. He explained that the Ordinance had four\nobjectives. The first was to ensure that no new group homes\n\f       PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH                15\n\nwould open in Newport Beach: “Do you get my drift? No\nnew ones anywhere unless an applicant can somehow prove\na need for special accommodation under federal law.” The\nsecond objective was to “assure that those homes that do\noperate in [the] community must meet the requirements of the\nstringent process and agree to strict operational guidelines or\ntheir permit will be revoked.” Third, the City would “assure\nthat there will be strict enforcement of the new ordinances\ngoing forward.” The fourth objective was “to substantially\nrelieve the existing overconcentration of group homes and\ntheir adverse impacts.”\n\n    Henn continued: “We have carefully evaluated the idea of\nsimply banning all unlicensed [group] homes in all but the\nmultifamily areas of the Peninsula. The siren song of that\nsolution was carefully evaluated, and unfortunately, as in so\nmany facets of life, our ideal must be tempered by reality.”\nHe explained that “to do so would risk an immediately\nsuccessful court challenge that would immediately enjoin the\nCity from executing the ordinance . . . while we fight it in\ncourt.” He concluded saying, “I believe that taken together\nthese findings and requirements will, in fact, result in a\nsubstantial reduction in the number of group homes on the\nPeninsula. . . . I ask you judge us by our actual results.”6\n\n    On January 22, 2008, the City Council met to approve the\nOrdinance and yet again confronted citizens who felt that the\nOrdinance should be even stricter and expressly regulate the\nconcentration of group homes. Outside counsel explained\nthat the approach adopted by the Ordinance—case-by-case\n\n\n   6\n     Although Henn at one point stated that the City wished to ban\nunlicensed homes, the larger context of his remarks suggests that the City\npreferred to ban all group homes, both licensed and unlicensed.\n\f16 PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH\n\nanalysis of each facility by a Hearing Officer—was harder to\nchallenge in court than a strict limit on the density of group\nhomes. Counsel assured the public that the Ordinance\nallowed “plenty of . . . hooks and standards for a [H]earing\n[O]fficer to apply [to deny a permit application].” Council\nMember Henn described the use permit process imposed by\nthe Ordinance as “a very substantive attack” on the “issue of\noverconcentration [of group homes.]” Henn also pointed out\nthat he was “not aware of any other city in the State of\nCalifornia that has adopted an ordinance that’s as aggressive\nas [the City’s] in terms of the location of new [group\nhomes].” Then, immediately after Henn’s comments, the\nCity Council approved the Ordinance, which prohibits new\ngroup homes in most residential areas, requires existing group\nhomes in those areas to submit to a burdensome permit\nprocess, and subjects those seeking to establish group homes\nin the limited areas in which they are still permitted to operate\nto the same onerous permit process.\n\n                              III\n\n    The Ordinance is codified as part of Title 20 of the City\nof Newport Beach Municipal Code (“NBMC”). Prior to the\nOrdinance’s enactment, the City treated group homes as\n“single housekeeping units.” “Single housekeeping units” are\ngenerally permitted to locate in all residential zones without\nany special permit. The Ordinance’s key innovation was to\namend the definition of “single housekeeping unit” to exclude\ngroup homes. This was accomplished in two critical ways:\nthe amended definition added the requirements that (1) a\nsingle housekeeping unit have a single, written lease and (2)\nthe residents themselves must decide who will be a member\nof the household. As a result of these amendments, group\nhomes no longer qualify as “single housekeeping units”\n\f         PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH                  17\n\nbecause the residents do not sign written leases and are\nchosen by staff (instead of by each other) to ensure the\nmaintenance of a sober environment.7\n\n    Instead, under the Ordinance, group homes are now\nregulated as “residential care facilities”—i.e., facilities in\nwhich disabled individuals reside together but not as a “single\nhousekeeping unit.”8 NBMC § 20.05.030(H)-(J). As\n“residential care facilities,” group homes now face significant\nrestrictions on location, and otherwise, to which they were\nnot subject prior to the Ordinance’s enactment when they\ntypically qualified as “single housekeeping units” and were\nable to operate freely in all residential areas. Under the\nOrdinance, as “residential care facilities,” new group homes\nmay not locate in most residential zones under any\ncircumstances, although they may locate in “multi-family”\nresidential zones if they obtain a special use permit. NBMC\n§ 20.10.020. Group homes that already existed in any\n\n\n     7\n      A very small number of facilities are run by the residents alone,\nwithout the supervision of an operator, and thus may still qualify as\n“single housekeeping units.” Those few facilities might therefore remain\nunregulated by the Ordinance. None of the Group Home Plaintiffs here\nfall in that category.\n 8\n   The NBMC distinguishes between “general” residential care facilities\n(those with more than six residents) and “small” residential care facilities\n(those with six or fewer residents), although the difference is not relevant\nhere. California law requires that licensed facilities with six residents or\nfewer be treated as single-family dwellings for zoning purposes by all\nmunicipalities. As a result such facilities are classified as “small licensed\nresidential care facilities” under the NBMC and treated the same as single\nfamily homes. All unlicensed residential care facilities, on the other hand,\nare “general residential care facilities” subject to the Ordinance, regardless\nof size. Similarly, all licensed facilities with more than six residents are\n“general residential care facilities.”\n\f18 PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V.

NBMC\n§§ 20.62.080(A)(4), 20.62.090, 20.91A.020. Thus, the\npractical result of the Ordinance is that group homes are\ntreated far less favorably than they were prior to the\nOrdinance’s enactment.9\n\n    The extensive conditions and findings that a hearing\noffice must make in order to issue a special use permit in a\nresidential zone are set forth in NBMC § 20.91A. Among\nother factors, the hearing officer must consider whether\ngranting a permit to a particular residential care facility would\nbe “compatible with the character of the surrounding\nneighborhood” and whether granting the use permit will\nresult in a concentration of more than roughly 1–2 such\n\n\n\n\n 9\n   As we explain in more detail, infra, the district court mistakenly relied\non the fact that the Ordinance imposes even more restrictive regulations\non other types of “group residential” living arrangements. “Group\nresidential” living arrangements, a classification that was newly\nintroduced by the Ordinance, are “[s]hared living quarters, occupied by\ntwo or more persons not living together as a single housekeeping unit” and\n“include[], without limitation, boarding or rooming houses, dormitories,\nfraternities, sororities, and private residential clubs.”           NBMC\n§ 20.05.030(C). Such living arrangements, whether new or pre-existing,\nare flatly prohibited from existing in any residential zone. There is no\nevidence, however, that more than a minimal number of “group\nresidential” living arrangements existed in residential zones at the time\nthat the Ordinance was enacted. NBMC §§ 20.05.030(C), 20.10.020. In\nany event, it seems unlikely that any significant number of such\nestablishments would have existed in the residential areas of Newport\nBeach.\n\f        PAC.

Use permit\ndenials may be appealed to the City Council under a\nsubstantial evidence standard of review.

NBMC § 20.91A.020. The managers of all three\nfacilities testified that the permit application process was\nburdensome, time-consuming, and costly, requiring hundreds\nof hours of staff time as well as tens of thousands of dollars\nin legal assistance to prepare and present the permit\napplications. The public hearings held regarding the Group\nHomes’ permit applications were attended by City residents\nwho repeated the same slurs and stereotypes about persons in\nrecovery that had been common during prior public\ngatherings and yelled at the Group Homes’ managers and\nattorneys.\n\n    On April 14, 2009, after two public hearings, the hearing\nofficer denied Yellowstone’s use permit and reasonable\naccommodation applications in their entirety, finding that\nYellowstone was not qualified for a special use permit\nbecause it had not fully complied with zoning laws when it\nwas first opened; the City Council affirmed that denial.\nNCR’s applications for a use permit and reasonable\naccommodation were denied on September 17, 2009, in part\nbecause of its proximity to another group home, as well as a\n\n\n  11\n     The City did serve abatement notices on some of these commercial\nentities on July 12, 2010, shortly after the Plaintiffs relied on the City’s\nfailure to enforce the Ordinance against these entities in their opposition\nto the City’s summary judgment motion.\n\f     PAC.

NCR appealed\nto the City Council, obtained a remand, was denied again, and\nthen appealed a second time, but was forced by economic\npressures to close prior to having its second appeal heard.\n\n    On September 23, 2008, Pacific Shores submitted a\nreasonable accommodation application for 18 beds at each of\nits facilities, but did not apply for a use permit. The\napplication was denied, and before its appeal could be heard,\nPacific Shores submitted an amended reasonable\naccommodation request seeking to be allowed to continue\noperations at two of its three houses with a maximum of 12\nresidents per facility, instead of 18. That request was granted.\n\n    The Ordinance shut down other group homes. On July\n30, 2008, Kiff gave a public presentation defending the\nOrdinance’s efficacy. Kiff explained that the Ordinance had\nforced group homes “to fight, stay, or leave,” and noted that\nof just over 600 group home beds in the City prior to the\nOrdinance, 220 were at facilities that would soon be required\nto close. According to Kiff, housing opportunities in group\nhomes were set to decline by 40% citywide “with all of the\nuse permit hearings yet to come.” He commented that Pacific\nShores was the City’s “most aggressive challenger” and that\n“they [we]re not going quietly.” Kiff ended his presentation\nstating that anti-discrimination laws “make[] me mad, too”\nbut that “as long as I’m here, you have my commitment—and\nI know you do of the City Council—to trying to bring owner-\noccupied back to West Newport.”\n\n    As Kiff predicted, by February 2009, more than 25 Group\nHomes—about one third of the number of Group Homes that\nhad existed in 2007—had either closed or were pending\nclosure. By March 2010, only four group homes had been\n\f22 PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V.

The City’s actions were particularly well known\nwithin the community of providers and therapists in Orange\nCounty and Southern California, and the City acknowledged\nas much in its communications with citizens. The managers\nand staff at the Group Homes spent substantial portions of\ntheir time contacting referral sources to assure them that,\ndespite negative publicity, the Group Homes were not\nclosing. Both Pacific Shores and NCR hired web consultants\nto improve their web ranking so that their webpages\n“appeared above web pages about the City’s actions to close”\nthem.\n\n    Each of the Group Homes experienced a dramatic decline\nin revenues of between 40% and 50% in the two years after\nthe Ordinance’s enactment. NCR closed in 2009 as a result\nof its declining business.        In addition, as the City\nacknowledged at oral argument, prior to reducing its\nreasonable accommodation request to only 12 beds per\nhomes, Pacific Shores had a higher occupancy rate at both of\nthe two homes for which its request was granted, so it lost\nsubstantial revenue as a result of the new 12 bed limitation.\n\n\n\n  12\n     Doing so would have been difficult. Under the limitations imposed\nby the Ordinance, only 33 out of 16,811 residential parcels in the City are\npossible sites for a new group home.\n\f      PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH                23\n\n                     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n    This is a consolidated appeal of two separate lawsuits\nresulting from the Ordinance’s enactment and enforcement.\nPacific Shores, its owner Alice Connor, and two Pacific\nShores residents sued the City alleging discrimination under\nthe federal Fair Housing Act (“FHA”), the Americans with\nDisabilities Act (“ADA”), California Fair Employment and\nHousing Act (“FEHA”), and the Equal Protection Clause, as\nwell as assorted other state and federal statutory and\nconstitutional claims not at issue here. NCR and Yellowstone\nfiled a separate suit alleging nearly identical claims. All of\nthe Plaintiffs sought damages as well as declaratory and\ninjunctive relief. The district court disposed of most of the\nPlaintiffs’ claims in two separate summary judgment rulings.\n\n    First, the district court granted summary judgment to the\nCity “with respect to [all of the] Plaintiffs’ disparate\ntreatment and selective enforcement claims brought under the\nFHA, ADA, FEHA, and the Equal Protection Clause,”\nbecause the Plaintiffs failed to show that they were “treated\ndifferently than similarly situated non-disabled individuals in\nthe enforcement of Ordinance 2008-5.” In so doing, the court\nacknowledged “the large amount of evidence . . . regarding\nNewport Beach’s allegedly discriminatory intent,” but\nconcluded that it was “irrelevant.” However, the district\ncourt denied the City summary judgment as to Pacific Shores’\nclaim that the Revised Moratorium was discriminatory,\nholding that it was facially discriminatory against group\nhomes.13\n\n\n 13\n    Pacific Shores was the only plaintiff to challenge the enforcement of\nthe Revised Moratorium because it was the only plaintiff against whom it\nwas enforced.\n\f24 PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH\n\n    In a second summary judgment order, the district court\ndismissed all of the Group Homes’ remaining claims for\ndamages, determining that none of the Group Homes had\ndemonstrated that any of the harm they suffered was caused\nby the Revised Moratorium or the Ordinance as opposed to\nother causes for which the City was not responsible, such as\nthe downturn in the economy or hostility of City residents\ntowards group homes. The district court also dismissed the\ntwo individual residents’ damages claims, concluding that\nneither produced any evidence of having suffered\ncompensable emotional distress.\n\n    In order to obtain a final judgment, the Plaintiffs\nvoluntarily dismissed their remaining claims with prejudice,\nincluding their claims to injunctive relief under a disparate\nimpact theory and their challenges to the City’s adjudication\nof each Group Home’s particular use permit and reasonable\naccommodation applications. The district court entered final\njudgment in favor of the City on March 14, 2011.\n\n    The Plaintiffs timely appealed for review of two issues:\n(1) “whether the district court erred in granting summary\njudgment against plaintiffs on their intentional discrimination\nclaims despite substantial evidence that the City enacted a\nzoning ordinance for the purpose of discriminating against\nhousing for disabled persons and enforced that ordinance to\neffect its discriminatory purpose” and (2) “whether the\ndistrict court erred in granting summary judgment against\nplaintiffs, who were the targets of the discriminatory\nordinance enacted and enforced by the City, on the grounds\nthat plaintiffs could not show that the City was the cause of\nany of their injuries.” We have jurisdiction pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\f       PAC.

As described above, we have\nunambiguously rejected this position previously, and we do\nso again now. McDonnell-Douglas simply permits a plaintiff\nto raise an inference of discrimination by identifying a\nsimilarly situated entity who was treated more favorably. It\nis not a straightjacket requiring the plaintiff to demonstrate\nthat such similarly situated entities exist.\n\n    This case demonstrates why requiring anti-discrimination\nplaintiffs to prove the existence of a better-treated entity\nwould lead to unacceptable results. According to the district\ncourt’s theory, Plaintiffs in anti-discrimination suits would be\nunable to demonstrate the discriminatory intent of a\ndefendant that openly admitted its intent to discriminate, so\nlong as the defendant (a) relies on a facially neutral law or\npolicy and (b) is willing to “overdiscriminate” by enforcing\nthe facially neutral law or policy even against similarly-\nsituated individuals who are not members of the disfavored\ngroup. Such a rule presents the “grotesque scenario where a[]\n[defendant] can effectively immunize itself from suit if it is\nso thorough in its discrimination that all similarly situated\n\f32 PAC.

Proxy discrimination is a form\nof facial discrimination. It arises when the defendant enacts a law or\npolicy that treats individuals differently on the basis of seemingly neutral\ncriteria that are so closely associated with the disfavored group that\ndiscrimination on the basis of such criteria is, constructively, facial\ndiscrimination against the disfavored group. For example, discriminating\nagainst individuals with gray hair is a proxy for age discrimination\nbecause “the ‘fit’ between age and gray hair is sufficiently close.”\n\f      PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH                  33\n\n    The principle that overdiscrimination is prohibited\nundergirds all of constitutional and statutory anti-\ndiscrimination law, although it often goes unsaid precisely\nbecause it is so foundational. Discriminatory laws, policies,\nor actions will often have negative effects (whether intended\nor not) on individuals who do not belong to the disfavored\ngroup. This does not, however, change the fact that such\nlaws, policies, or actions are discriminatory when they are\nundertaken for the purpose of harming protected individuals.\n\n    Arlington Heights itself relies on the assumption that\noverdiscrimination is illegal. The issue in Arlington Heights\nwas whether a Chicago suburb’s denial of a rezoning\napplication for construction of an affordable housing complex\nwas racially motivated. Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 259.\nAlthough on the facts of the case the Court held that the\nevidence did not support the Plaintiffs’ allegations that a\ndiscriminatory motive was at work, the Court’s analysis\npresumed that the Plaintiffs would have prevailed if they had\ndemonstrated that Arlington Heights denied the rezoning\napplication in order to limit housing opportunities for\nminorities. See id. at 270. This would have been so even\nthough the racial minorities who were denied housing\nopportunities would not have been treated any worse than the\n\n\nMcWright v.

The\ndifference between proxy discrimination and facially neutral\noverdiscrimination is merely one of degree. In a case of proxy\ndiscrimination the defendant discriminates against individuals on the basis\nof criteria that are almost exclusively indicators of membership in the\ndisfavored group. By contrast, facially neutral overdiscrimination arises\nwhen the defendant exhibits a willingness to distinguish amongst\nindividuals on the basis of facially neutral criteria, knowing (but\naccepting) that some individuals who are not members of the disfavored\ngroup will suffer alongside the targeted individuals.\n\f34 PAC.

However, there was compelling evidence that the\nprovision was adopted at the turn of the 20th century for the\npurpose of disenfranchising black voters who were convicted\nof such crimes at a far higher rate than white voters.\nAssuming, arguendo, that the disenfranchisement provision\nwould be constitutional if it were passed in modern times\nwithout the intent to discriminate against racial minorities, the\nCourt nonetheless held that because it had been enacted for a\ndiscriminatory purpose it “violates equal protection under\nArlington Heights.” Id. at 233.

SHORES PROPERTIES V.

The Ordinance\namended the definition of “single housekeeping unit” to\nexclude living arrangements in which residents (1) are not all\nsignatories to a single written lease and (2) do not choose\ntheir own housemates. NBMC § 20.03.030. These\ncharacteristics subject group homes, but not vacation homes,\nto a more restrictive zoning regime. To be sure, the\nOrdinance affects adversely some other facilities that are not\ngroup homes. “Group residential” arrangements such as\n“boarding or rooming houses, dormitories, fraternities,\nsororities, and private residential clubs” are now completely\nprohibited in residential zones. NBMC § 20.05.030(C). The\nrecord, however, includes evidence that this aspect of the\nOrdinance has been enforced against few, if any, facilities.\nTherefore it appears either to be the case that very few “group\nresidential” facilities that were not group homes existed when\nthe Ordinance was enacted, or if such facilities existed, the\nCity did not enforce the Ordinance against them.

See Flores,\n617 F.2d at 1391. This would be true even if such permits\nwere granted freely, which is decidedly not the case here.\n\n    Plaintiffs have introduced evidence that the Ordinance\nhad at least two kinds of adverse effects upon them, either of\nwhich would be sufficient to allow them to maintain an action\nunder the FHA or ADA. First, the unrebutted evidence shows\nthat the Group Homes expended substantial time, effort, and\nresources applying for special use permits and reasonable\naccommodations, none of which would have been necessary\nhad the Ordinance not been enacted. See, e.g., Walker,\n272 F.3d at 1124–25 (staff time spent responding to\nintentionally discriminatory actions by a municipality is an\ninjury sufficient to confer standing under the FHA and\nFEHA). Second, Plaintiffs have produced evidence that the\nOrdinance led to the closure of approximately one third of the\nCity’s Group Homes and barred new group homes from being\nestablished in all but multi-family residential zones. This\nresulted in a reduced diversity of housing options for the\ndisabled individuals served by group homes. See Olmstead\n\n\n 30\n    Although the reasonable accommodation process ostensibly allowed\nexceptions to the City’s zoning policy that would be consistent with state\nand federal anti-discrimination laws, it was as complex, time-consuming,\nand restrictive as the special use permit process.

For these reasons, the City’s waiver\nargument based upon the fact that the Group Homes no\nlonger challenge the City’s denial of their permit applications\nis irrelevant. The Plaintiffs show they were harmed by the\nimposition of the discriminatory permit regime, and this is\nmore than sufficient for them to maintain a claim for\ndisparate treatment based upon the imposition of the permit\nrequirement itself.31\n\n    The City’s argument that the Plaintiffs cannot use\nstatistical evidence to demonstrate that the Ordinance\ndiscriminated against them simply because they voluntarily\ndismissed their disparate impact claims is also unavailing.\nFirst, the City misdescribes the posture of this case. The\nPlaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claim to injunctive relief\nunder a disparate impact theory, but did not dismiss their\nclaims to damages under that theory. Those damages claims\nwere dismissed by the district court in the second summary\njudgment order relating to damages, and the Plaintiffs have\nappealed that ruling.

According to the City, Pacific Shores did not suffer\nany adverse effects as a result of the Ordinance because it was granted a\nreasonable accommodation for twelve beds. This argument suffers from\nthe same defect: the very requirement to apply for a reasonable\naccommodation adversely affected Pacific Shores. Just as plaintiffs in a\ndiscrimination action need not have applied for a permit in order to allege\nthat a permit requirement is discriminatory, see City of Modesto, 583 F.3d\nat 705 n.7, so too may plaintiffs challenge a discriminatory permit regime\neven if they begrudgingly apply for a permit in order to minimize the harm\nthey suffer under that regime.\n\f     PAC.

The Group Homes argue that they submitted\nsufficient evidence to survive summary judgment with\nrespect to whether the City caused them to incur three\nseparate categories of damages: (1) costs of complying with\nthe Ordinance, i.e., diverted staff time and legal expenses; (2)\nlost income as a result of the business climate resulting from\nthe Ordinance; and (3) costs associated with counteracting the\nimpression that the Group Homes were being shut down by\nthe City.

The Group Homes’ managers stated that\nthey attract new residents primarily through referrals from\ncare providers and their websites. There was evidence that\nboth referral sources were affected by the Ordinance. The\nCity’s enforcement of the Ordinance was widely publicized\nin the care provider community and “[f]ew counselors and\ntherapists wanted to refer their clients to [the Group Homes]\nbecause of the City’s actions” as a result. NCR’s manager\ndescribed its referrals as “dr[ying] up completely” after the\nCity’s second denial of its permit application. The managers\nalso explained that “our internet presence was drowned out\nby other web pages concerning the City’s actions.” In\naddition, current and prospective residents expressed concern\nto the managers about whether the Group Homes would\nclose. A jury could infer from these facts that prospective\nresidents were not referred to or deliberately stayed away\nfrom the Group Homes, and opted to reside elsewhere, as a\nresult of the Ordinance’s enactment and enforcement, without\nhearing any particular individual testify that he did so.\n\n    Indeed, prior to taking the opposite stance in litigation,\ncity officials themselves credited the Ordinance with harming\ngroup homes. At a public meeting, Kiff stated that the\nOrdinance had been responsible for a reduction in bed counts\nof as much as 40% and described it as a key step to\n“bring[ing] owner-occupied back.”           In enacting the\nOrdinance, Council Member Henn promised City residents\nthat it would “result in a substantial reduction in the\nnumber of group homes on the Peninsula” and asked to be\n“judge[d] . . . by our actual results.”\n\n   Each of the Group Homes presented evidence that it\nexperienced a precipitous decline in business after the\n\f       PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V. CITY OF NEWPORT BEACH                 53\n\npassage of the Ordinance. Yellowstone’s revenues declined\nover 50% between 2007 and 2009.

Furthermore, it served fewer residents than it\notherwise would have due to the 12-bed occupancy limitation\nit accepted in order to secure approval of its reasonable\naccommodation application.34\n\n    In sum, a jury could easily infer that the City’s actions\nmaterially contributed to the Group Homes’ losses. The\nmanagers all stated that the Ordinance’s enactment and\nenforcement led to reduced referrals, evidence showed that\nclosing group homes was one of the Ordinance’s primary\ngoals, and the Group Homes’ revenues plummeted in the\nimmediate aftermath of the Ordinance’s enactment.\n\n   This conclusion is not altered by the fact that some of the\nnegative publicity about the Group Homes, which may have\ncontributed to their business losses, was generated by the\nCCNB and other third-party sources. At least some of the\nnegative publicity that allegedly harmed the Group Homes’\n\n 33\n    The City also argues that because NCR’s permit application was not\nfinally denied until January 2009, it could not have suffered any losses\nprior to that time. This argument is simply wrong. A jury could certainly\nconclude that the threat of eventual closure contributed to NCR’s decline\nin business even prior to the final denial of its permit application.\n  34\n     There is no merit to the City’s contention that these losses are not\nrecoverable because Pacific Shores itself requested the 12-bed limitation.\nThis argument disregards the fact that Pacific Shores’ request for a 12-bed\nlimitation was a result of the Hearing Officer’s two prior denials of its\nrequest for an 18-bed reasonable accommodation. In any event, as we\nhave already explained, no such limitation would have applied if the City\nhad not adopted the Ordinance in the first place.\n\f54 PAC. SHORES PROPERTIES V.

As to causation, the managers\nthemselves explained that their promotional efforts were not\nundertaken because of a general, unexplained, drop in\nbusiness, but rather because their referral sources were\nconcerned whether they could remain open and provide a\nhealthy atmosphere as a result of the Ordinance. Similarly,\nPacific Shores increased its advertising expenditures in 2008\nfor the purpose of “inform[ing] the public that its Newport\nBeach houses were open and provided a safe place for sober\nliving.” In addition, Pacific Shores and NCR each hired a\nweb consultant to assist them with promoting their presence\non the internet because publicity surrounding the City’s\n\n\n 35\n    The City, of course, would be free at trial to present proof to the jury\nthat a significant portion of the Group Homes’ losses were attributable to\nother causes such as the downturn in the economy.\n\f     PAC.
