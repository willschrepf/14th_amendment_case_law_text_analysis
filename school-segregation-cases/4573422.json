Solosky, FOX ROTHSCHILD LLP,\nWashington, D.C., for Appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                                 3\n\fWYNN, Circuit Judge:\n\n      The Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”), 29 U.S.C. §§ 201 et seq., requires\n\ncovered employers to pay their employees both a minimum wage and overtime\n\npay, id. §§ 206, 207. In these consolidated cases, two groups of satellite television\n\ntechnicians (“Plaintiffs”) allege that DIRECTV and DirectSat (collectively,\n\n“Defendants”), through a web of agreements with various affiliated and\n\nunaffiliated service providers, jointly employed Plaintiffs,1 and therefore are\n\njointly and severally liable for any violations of the FLSA’s substantive provisions.\n\nSee 29 C.F.R. § 791.2(a).\n\n      The district court dismissed Plaintiffs’ action on the pleadings, holding that\n\nPlaintiffs failed to adequately allege that DIRECTV and DirectSat jointly\n\nemployed Plaintiffs. In so doing, the district court relied on out-of-circuit authority\n\nthat we have since rejected as unduly restrictive in light of the broad reach of the\n\nFLSA. Analyzing Plaintiffs’ allegations under the legal standard adopted by this\n\nCircuit and construing those allegations liberally, as we must when ruling on a\n\nmotion to dismiss, Wright v. North Carolina, 787 F.3d 256, 263 (4th Cir. 2015),\n\nwe conclude that Plaintiffs’ factual allegations state a claim under the FLSA.\n\nAccordingly, we reverse.\n\n      1\n         As explained in greater detail below, infra Part I.A., Plaintiffs each bring a\nclaim under the FLSA against Defendant DIRECTV, with two Plaintiffs bringing a\nparallel claim against Defendant DirectSat. For purposes of clarity, the allegations\nset out in the Amended Consolidated Complaint are attributed to all Plaintiffs.\n                                          4\n\f                                           I.\n\n                                           A.\n\n      Plaintiffs appeal from an order granting Defendants’ motion to dismiss\n\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Accordingly, we recount the facts\n\nas alleged by Plaintiffs, accepting them as true and drawing all reasonable\n\ninferences in Plaintiffs’ favor. See E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Kolon Indus.,\n\nInc., 637 F.3d 435, 440 (4th Cir. 2011).\n\n      As the nation’s largest satellite television provider, DIRECTV engages\n\nthousands of technicians to install and repair satellite systems for customers\n\nthroughout the country.     In addition to employing some technicians directly,\n\nDIRECTV controls and manages many technicians through the DIRECTV\n\n“Provider Network.” J.A. 93. According to the Amended Consolidated Complaint\n\n(“Complaint”), this network is organized as a pyramid, with DIRECTV contracting\n\nwith certain intermediary entities known as “Home Service Providers” and\n\n“Secondary Service Providers.” J.A. 93–94. These intermediary entities generally\n\ncontract with “a patchwork of largely captive entities”—referred to in the\n\nComplaint as “subcontractors”—which in turn contract directly with individual\n\ntechnicians throughout the country. J.A. 94.\n\n      Following DIRECTV’s acquisition of numerous Home and Secondary\n\nService Providers, Defendant DirectSat was one of three “independent” Home\n\n\n                                           5\n\fService Providers remaining in the DIRECTV Provider Network at the time this\n\naction was initiated.2 In this capacity, DirectSat served as a middle-manager\n\nbetween DIRECTV and individual technicians who contracted directly with\n\nDIRECTV, as well as between DIRECTV and various subcontractors that hired\n\nindividual technicians. Specifically, DirectSat, like the other Home and Secondary\n\nService Providers, implemented and enforced DIRECTV’s hiring criteria for\n\ntechnicians, relayed scheduling decisions from DIRECTV to technicians using\n\nDIRECTV’s centralized work-assignment system, and otherwise supervised\n\ntechnicians under its purview. DirectSat also maintained a “contractor file” for\n\neach of its technicians, which Plaintiffs describe as “analogous to a personnel file”\n\nand which were “regulated and audited by DIRECTV.” J.A. 94–95. And, in\n\naccordance with its agreement with DIRECTV, DirectSat required technicians to\n\nobtain DIRECTV equipment and attend DIRECTV-mandated trainings at\n\nDirectSat facilities.\n\n      Each Plaintiff alleges that, between 2007 and 2014, he worked as a\n\ntechnician for DIRECTV, an intermediary provider, a subcontractor, or some\n\ncombination of those entities. Plaintiffs Lewis and Wood allege that they were\n\nemployed by DirectSat, while the five remaining Plaintiffs allege that they worked\n\n      2\n        Plaintiffs allege that DIRECTV “regularly infuses these [providers] with\nwhat it labels internally as ‘extraordinary advance payments’” and frequently\nacquires providers when “litigation or other circumstances” present a potential\nbusiness risk for DIRECTV. J.A. 97.\n                                         6\n\ffor other providers not named as defendants in this action. During their respective\n\nperiods of employment, Plaintiffs were each generally classified by their employer\n\nor employers as an independent contractor. 3     In all instances, each Plaintiff’s\n\nprincipal job duty was to install and repair DIRECTV equipment.\n\n      Regardless of the identity of Plaintiffs’ nominal employers, DIRECTV\n\nprimarily directed and controlled Plaintiffs’ work. In particular, Plaintiffs allege\n\nthat DIRECTV was the “primary, if not the only” client of each of the providers\n\nwho served as Plaintiffs’ direct employers and was the “source of substantially all\n\nof each [p]rovider’s income.” J.A. 93–94. At the same time, DIRECTV dictated\n\nnearly every aspect of Plaintiffs’ work through its agreements with the various\n\nproviders that directly employed technicians.     Among other provisions, these\n\nagreements required that all technicians—and therefore Plaintiffs—pass pre-\n\nscreening checks and background checks, review training materials published by\n\nDIRECTV, and become certified by the Satellite Broadcasting & Communications\n\nAssociation. The agreements likewise required technicians to purchase and wear\n\nDIRECTV shirts, carry DIRECTV identification cards, and display the DIRECTV\n\nlogo on their vehicles.     Those who did not satisfy DIRECTV’s eligibility\n\nrequirements could not carry out a technician’s primary task: installing and\n\nrepairing DIRECTV satellite equipment.\n\n      3\n       Plaintiff Hall was initially classified as a direct employee of a provider in\nAugust 2009, but was reclassified as an independent contractor in November 2011.\n                                         7\n\f      In addition to these eligibility requirements, DIRECTV, through its provider\n\nagreements, required technicians to receive their work assignments through a\n\ncentralized system operated by DIRECTV.          DIRECTV also mandated that\n\ntechnicians check in with DIRECTV before and after completing each assigned\n\njob, conduct installations and repairs strictly according to DIRECTV’s\n\nstandardized policies and procedures, and interact with DIRECTV employees to\n\nactivate satellite television service during each installation.     The provider\n\nagreements also authorized DIRECTV employees to exercise quality control\n\noversight over technicians, categorizing technicians’ work as either compensable\n\nor noncompensable and imposing various compensation-related penalties for\n\nunsatisfactory service. Finally, the provider agreements allowed DIRECTV to\n\neffectively terminate technicians by ceasing to assign them work orders through\n\nthe company’s centralized work-assignment system.\n\n                                        B.\n\n      Claiming that they each regularly worked in excess of forty hours per week\n\nwithout receiving overtime pay while serving as DIRECTV technicians, Plaintiffs\n\ninitiated this action in November 2013.4      Specifically, Plaintiffs alleged that\n\n\n      4\n         Plaintiffs pursued their overtime and minimum wage claims, either\ncollectively or individually, in various federal jurisdictions before their claims\nwere ultimately transferred to and consolidated in the United States District Court\nfor the District of Maryland. Hall v. DIRECTV, Nos. JFM-14-2355, JFM-14-3261,\n2015 WL 4064692, at *1 n.2 (D. Md. June 30, 2015). In each instance in which\n                                        8\n\fDefendants qualified as their joint employers during the relevant period, such that\n\nDefendants’ failure to provide overtime pay for these additional hours violated the\n\nFLSA’s overtime and minimum wage requirements. In addition to their claims\n\nunder the FLSA, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated three Maryland wage\n\nand hour statutes: (1) the Maryland Wage and Hour Law, Md. Code Ann., Lab. &\n\nEmpl. §§ 3-401 et seq.; (2) the Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Law, Md.\n\nCode Ann., Lab. & Empl. §§ 3-501 et seq.; and (3) the Maryland Workplace Fraud\n\nAct, Md. Code Ann., Lab. & Empl. §§ 3-901 et seq.\n\n      Defendants each moved to dismiss Plaintiffs’ Complaint pursuant to Federal\n\nRule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). On June 30, 2015, the district court granted\n\nDefendants’ motions and dismissed Plaintiffs’ claims in their entirety. See Hall v.\n\nDIRECTV, Nos. JFM-14-2355, JFM-14-3261, 2015 WL 4064692, at *1 (D. Md.\n\nJune 30, 2015).\n\n      In so doing, the district court devised and applied a two-step inquiry to\n\ndetermine whether Plaintiffs alleged a plausible FLSA joint employment claim.\n\nThe court reasoned that the “first question that must be resolved is whether an\n\nindividual worker is ‘an employee’” of each putative joint employer within the\n\nmeaning of the statute. Id. at *2. Only if Plaintiffs qualified as employees—and\n\nnot independent contractors—could the court reach what it deemed the second step\n\nthey were previously considered, Plaintiffs’ claims were dismissed without\nprejudice. Id.\n                                        9\n\fof the inquiry: “whether an entity other than the entity with which the individual\n\n[plaintiff] had a direct relationship is a ‘joint employer’ of [the plaintiff].” Id.\n\n      The district court looked to Schultz v. Capital International Securities Inc.,\n\n466 F.3d 298 (4th Cir. 2006), to determine whether a worker qualifies as an\n\n“employee” within the meaning of the FLSA. Hall, 2015 WL 4064692, at *2.\n\nSchultz, relying on United States v. Silk, 331 U.S. 704 (1947), applied six factors to\n\ndetermine whether a worker falls within the definition of an “employee” under the\n\nFLSA and, thus, benefits from the statute’s protections. Schultz, 466 F.3d at 304–\n\n05. These factors include: “(1) the degree of control that the putative employer has\n\nover the manner in which the work is performed; (2) the worker’s opportunities for\n\nprofit or loss dependent on his managerial skill; (3) the worker’s investment in\n\nequipment or material, or his employment of other workers; (4) the degree of skill\n\nrequired for the work; (5) the permanence of the working relationship; and (6) the\n\ndegree to which the services rendered are an integral part of the putative\n\nemployer’s business.” Id. (citing authorities).\n\n      Apparently assuming that Plaintiffs were not purely independent contractors\n\noutside of the FLSA’s scope, the district court went on to consider whether\n\nDIRECTV was Plaintiffs’ “joint employer” for purposes of the FLSA. Hall, 2015\n\nWL 4064692, at *2. In doing so, the district court employed a four-factor test\n\noriginally set forth by the Ninth Circuit in Bonnette v. California Health and\n\n\n                                           10\n\fWelfare Agency, 704 F.2d 1465, 1470 (9th Cir. 1983).           See Hall, 2015 WL\n\n4064692, at *2; see also Roman v. Guapos III, Inc., 970 F. Supp. 2d 407, 413 (D.\n\nMd. 2013). Under this test, the district court considered whether DIRECTV:\n\n(1) had the power to hire and fire the employee; (2) supervised and controlled\n\nemployee work schedules or conditions of employment; (3) determined the rate\n\nand method of payment; and (4) maintained employment records. Hall, 2015 WL\n\n4064692, at *2.\n\n      Courts applying the Bonnette test, including the Bonnette Court itself, have\n\nemphasized that no single factor is dispositive in determining whether a particular\n\nentity qualifies as a joint employer. Bonnette, 704 F.2d at 1470; see also Skrzecz v.\n\nGibson Island Corp., No. CIV.A. RDB-13-1796, 2014 WL 3400614, at *7 (D. Md.\n\nJuly 11, 2014). Nonetheless, while acknowledging that Plaintiffs “alleged facts\n\nsufficient to show that DIRECTV at least indirectly supervised [Plaintiffs’] work\n\nand directly controlled their schedules,” the district court dismissed this\n\narrangement as “not surprising” in light of DIRECTV’s interest in maintaining its\n\ngoodwill with consumers. Hall, 2015 WL 4064692, at *2. Instead, the district\n\ncourt observed that the “ultimate test of employment is the hiring and firing of\n\nemployees and the setting of their compensation amounts.” Id. Reasoning that\n\nPlaintiffs failed to allege that DIRECTV directly hired or fired technicians working\n\nfor its providers or otherwise controlled those technicians’ compensation, the\n\n\n                                         11\n\fdistrict court concluded that the Complaint did not allege facts sufficient to\n\nestablish that DIRECTV jointly employed Plaintiffs. Id.\n\n      Seeking to bolster this conclusion, the district court identified as relevant\n\nother considerations untethered to both the standard articulated in Bonnette and the\n\nsimilar standard applied by the district court itself. Specifically, the court posited\n\nthat “if the entities that were part of the [DIRECTV] Provider System were\n\nundercapitalized and merely charades created by DIRECTV that followed every\n\nsuggestion and payment decision made by DIRECTV, that would show, perhaps\n\nconclusively, DIRECTV’s joint employer status.”                Id. (emphasis added).\n\nHowever, because “nothing . . . implie[d] that the companies in the DIRECTV\n\nProvider Network were undercapitalized or slavishly followed every suggestion\n\nmade by DIRECTV in regard to the status and method of payment of the\n\ntechnicians with whom they had a relationship[,]” the district court concluded that\n\nPlaintiffs failed to state a claim. Id. Instead, the district court found that Plaintiffs’\n\nallegations “show[ed] only that DIRECTV adopted a reasonable business model\n\nthat allowed for the decentralization of decision-making authority regarding the\n\nemployment of technicians who install its equipment.” Id. According to the\n\ndistrict court, such a “reasonable business model” did not support a finding of joint\n\nemployment for purposes of the FLSA. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                           12\n\f      Having found that Plaintiffs failed to state an actionable FLSA claim against\n\nDIRECTV, the district court summarily concluded that Plaintiffs’ claims under the\n\nMaryland wage and hour statutes also failed. Id. at *3. Specifically, the district\n\ncourt observed that the definitions of “employer” embraced by the Maryland wage\n\nand hour statutes were either coextensive with or narrower than that set forth under\n\nthe FLSA. Id. As such, just as DIRECTV did not qualify as Plaintiffs’ joint\n\nemployer under the FLSA, the district court reasoned that the company could not\n\nbe held liable as a joint employer in connection with Plaintiffs’ state law claims.\n\nId. This timely appeal followed.\n\n                                           II.\n\n      We review de novo the district court’s dismissal of a complaint under\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). E.I. du Pont de Nemours, 637 F.3d at\n\n440. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires only “a short and plain\n\nstatement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” FED. R. CIV.\n\nP. 8(a)(2). When ruling on a motion to dismiss, courts must accept as true all of\n\nthe factual allegations contained in the complaint and draw all reasonable\n\ninferences in favor of the plaintiff. E.I. du Pont de Nemours, 637 F.3d at 440; see\n\nalso Anderson v. Found. for Advancement, Educ. & Emp’t of Am. Indians, 155\n\nF.3d 500, 505 (4th Cir. 1998) (explaining that federal “pleading standards require\n\nthe complaint be read liberally in favor of the plaintiff”).\n\n\n                                          13\n\f      To survive a motion to dismiss, Plaintiffs’ factual allegations, taken as true,\n\nmust “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Robertson v. Sea Pines\n\nReal Estate Co., 679 F.3d 278, 288 (4th Cir. 2012) (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556\n\nU.S. 662, 678 (2009)). The plausibility standard is not a probability requirement,\n\nbut “asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.”\n\nIqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 556\n\n(2007)). Although it is true that “the complaint must contain sufficient facts to\n\nstate a claim that is plausible on its face, it nevertheless need only give the\n\ndefendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds on which it rests.”\n\nWright, 787 F.3d at 263 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Thus, we\n\nhave emphasized that “a complaint is to be construed liberally so as to do\n\nsubstantial justice.” Id.\n\n      Under this standard, we reverse the district court’s dismissal of Plaintiffs’\n\nclaims for two reasons. First, the district court applied an improper legal test for\n\ndetermining whether entities constitute joint employers for purposes of the FLSA.\n\nSecond, the district court misapplied the plausibility standard set forth in Twombly\n\nand Iqbal by subjecting Plaintiffs to evidentiary burdens inapplicable at the\n\npleading stage and by failing to credit key factual allegations regarding\n\nDefendants’ control and oversight of Plaintiffs’ work as DIRECTV technicians.\n\nAs explained below, when considered under the appropriate joint employment test\n\n\n                                        14\n\fand the proper standard for Rule 12(b)(6) motions, Plaintiffs’ factual allegations\n\nplausibly demonstrate that DIRECTV and DirectSat jointly employed Plaintiffs\n\nduring the relevant period.\n\n                                       III.\n\n      The Department of Labor regulation implementing the FLSA distinguishes\n\n“separate and distinct employment” from “joint employment.”            29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 791.2(a). “Separate employment” exists when “all the relevant facts establish\n\nthat two or more employers are acting entirely independently of each other and are\n\ncompletely disassociated with respect to the” individual’s employment. Id. By\n\ncontrast, “joint employment” exists when “employment by one employer is not\n\ncompletely disassociated from employment by the other employer(s).” Id. When\n\ntwo or more entities are found to jointly employ a particular worker, “all of the\n\nemployee’s work for all of the joint employers during the workweek is considered\n\nas one employment for purposes of the [FLSA].” Id. (emphasis added). Thus, for\n\nexample, all hours worked by the employee on behalf of each joint employer are\n\ncounted together to determine whether the employee is entitled to overtime pay\n\nunder the FLSA. Id.\n\n      Notwithstanding the regulation’s seemingly straightforward language, courts\n\nhave long struggled to articulate a coherent test for distinguishing separate\n\nemployment from joint employment.         As we have explained, much of this\n\n\n                                       15\n\fconfusion stems from the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Bonnette v. California Health\n\nand Welfare Agency, 704 F.2d 1465 (9th Cir. 1983). Salinas v. Commercial\n\nInteriors, Inc., No. 15-1915, slip op. at 17–18 (argued Oct. 27, 2016). Bonnette\n\ndrew on common-law agency principles, as well as the test used to address the\n\ndistinct question of whether a particular worker is an employee or independent\n\ncontractor, to adopt a multifactor test purporting to differentiate separate\n\nemployment from joint employment by focusing on a putative joint employer’s\n\nright to control an FLSA plaintiff’s work. 704 F.2d at 1470. The court identified\n\nfour nonexclusive factors to guide this inquiry: “whether the alleged employer (1)\n\nhad the power to hire and fire the employees, (2) supervised and controlled\n\nemployee work schedules or conditions of employment, (3) determined the rate\n\nand method of payment, and (4) maintained employment records.” Id.\n\n      Following Bonnette, a number of courts, including district courts within this\n\nCircuit, have applied this four-factor test to determine whether two or more entities\n\nconstitute joint employers under the FLSA. Salinas, No. 15-1915, slip op. at 18–\n\n19 (collecting cases). At the same time, however, several circuits (including the\n\nNinth Circuit, itself) have liberalized the Bonnette test to reflect Congress’s\n\noriginal intent for the FLSA to extend protections beyond common-law\n\nemployment relationships. Id. at 19–20. As a result, at the time the district court\n\nconsidered Defendants’ motions to dismiss in this case, courts in various\n\n\n                                         16\n\fjurisdictions within this Circuit and throughout the country applied numerous,\n\ndistinct, multifactor joint employment tests. 5 Id.\n\n      Perhaps reflecting this uncertain state of the law, the district court’s review\n\nof Plaintiffs’ joint employment allegations in this case is somewhat disjointed. As\n\ndiscussed above, supra Part I.B., the district court began its analysis by proposing\n\nan analytical framework under which it would first decide whether Plaintiffs fell\n\nwithin the FLSA’s definition of “employee.” Hall, 2015 WL 4064692, at *2.\n\nApparently assuming, without analysis, that Plaintiffs were employees within the\n\nFLSA’s scope, the court went on to consider whether Defendants qualified as\n\nPlaintiffs’ joint employers under the statute. Id. Applying the four-factor Bonnette\n\ntest, the district court concluded that Plaintiffs failed to plausibly allege that\n\nDefendants were their joint employers during the relevant period. Id.\n\n      The district court’s analysis of Plaintiffs’ joint employment claims suffers\n\nfrom two basic flaws. First, the district court errantly concluded that a worker\n\nmust be an employee—as opposed to an independent contractor—as to each\n\nputative joint employer when considered separately for the entities to constitute\n\njoint employers under the FLSA. As a result of this misinterpretation, the district\n\ncourt incorrectly treated a worker’s status as an employee or independent\n\n      5\n        Notably, in another FLSA action, the trial judge in this case applied a five-\nfactor joint employment test that differed from the Bonnette-based test that he\napplied in this case, notwithstanding that the two cases were decided only a few\nmonths apart. See Salinas, No. 15-1915, slip op. at 9–10.\n                                          17\n\fcontractor as to each putative joint employer as a threshold inquiry to be decided\n\nprior to determining whether the two entities are completely disassociated.\n\nSecond, the district court improperly relied on Bonnette to determine whether\n\nDefendants jointly employed Plaintiffs, leading the court to ignore important,\n\nrelevant aspects of Plaintiffs’ employment arrangement during their respective\n\ntenures as DIRECTV technicians.6 We discuss each of these errors in turn.\n\n                                           A.\n\n         First, the district court’s treatment of whether Plaintiffs were employees—as\n\nopposed to independent contractors—of DIRECTV and DirectSat as a threshold\n\nquestion inverted the two-step inquiry we have adopted in FLSA joint employment\n\ncases.\n\n         We addressed the proper order of analysis in FLSA joint employment\n\nactions in Schultz. There, we established a two-step framework for determining\n\nwhether a defendant may be held liable for an alleged FLSA violation under a joint\n\nemployment theory. 466 F.3d at 305–09. Under this framework, we first must\n\ndetermine whether the defendant and one or more additional entities shared, agreed\n\n\n         6\n         As previously described, despite its recitation of the Bonnette factors, the\ndistrict court’s analysis turned largely on its misapprehension of Plaintiffs’\nallegations regarding the degree to which Defendants maintained the authority to\nhire and fire or otherwise set the rate of compensation for DIRECTV technicians\nlike Plaintiffs. In this sense, even assuming that the Bonnette-like test applied by\nthe district court was the appropriate joint employment test, the district court’s\ndismissal of Plaintiffs’ overtime claims was in error.\n                                           18\n\fto allocate responsibility for, or otherwise codetermined the key terms and\n\nconditions of the plaintiff’s work. Id.; Salinas, No. 15-1915, slip op. at 29–31.\n\nThe second step of the analysis—which asks whether a worker was an employee or\n\nindependent contractor for purposes of the FLSA—depends in large part upon the\n\nanswer to the first step. Namely, if we determine that the defendant and another\n\nentity codetermined the key terms and conditions of the worker’s employment,\n\nthen we must consider whether the two entities’ combined influence over the terms\n\nand conditions of the worker’s employment render the worker an employee as\n\nopposed to an independent contractor.        By contrast, if the two entities are\n\ndisassociated with regard to the key terms and conditions of the worker’s\n\nemployment, we must consider whether the worker is an employee or independent\n\ncontractor with regard to each putative employer separately.\n\n      In adopting this framework, we explained that the joint employment doctrine\n\nis premised on the theory that, when two or more entities jointly employ a worker,\n\nthe worker’s entire “employment arrangement must be viewed as ‘one\n\nemployment’ for purposes of determining whether the [worker was an] employee[]\n\nor independent contractor[] under the FLSA.” Schultz, 466 F.3d at 307 (quoting 29\n\nC.F.R. § 791.2(a)). In other words, if a worker performs work for two or more\n\nentities that are “not completely disassociated” with respect to that worker’s\n\nemployment, 29 C.F.R. § 791.2(a), courts must aggregate the levers of influence\n\n\n                                        19\n\fover the key terms and conditions of the worker’s employment exercised by all of\n\nthe entities when determining whether the worker is an “employee” within the\n\nmeaning of the FLSA.        Accordingly, the district court in this case erred by\n\nconsidering whether Plaintiffs qualified as employees “without first determining\n\nwhether a joint employment relationship existed” between DIRECTV, DirectSat,\n\nand Plaintiffs’ other putative joint employers. 7 Schultz, 466 F.3d at 309.\n\n      Focusing first on the relationship between putative joint employers is\n\nessential to accomplishing the FLSA’s “remedial and humanitarian” purpose.\n\nPurdham v. Fairfax Cty. Sch. Bd., 637 F.3d 421, 427 (4th Cir. 2011) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted) (quoting Tenn. Coal, Iron & R.R. Co. v. Muscoda Local\n\nNo. 123, 321 U.S. 590, 597 (1944)). Indeed, a worker who performs services for\n\ntwo or more entities that are “not completely disassociated” with respect to his\n\nwork may not amount to an “employee” protected by the FLSA when his\n\nrelationship to each entity is considered separately, but may come within the\n\nstatutory definition of an “employee” when his relationships to all of the relevant\n\nentities are considered in the aggregate. By ignoring the relationships between and\n\namong these entities vis-à-vis the worker, the framework deployed by the district\n\n      7\n         Schultz acknowledged that in a small subset of cases this sequence of\nanalyses may be unnecessary, 466 F.3d at 306 n.1, such as when the levers of\ninfluence over the essential terms and conditions of an individual’s work exercised\nby putative joint employers would not give rise to an employer-employee\nrelationship, regardless of whether the putative joint employers’ levers of influence\nare considered in the aggregate.\n                                         20\n\fcourt erroneously failed to take account of a worker’s entire employment when\n\nconsidering whether he or she is covered by the FLSA. This approach departs\n\nfrom the framework we set forth in Schultz and risks creating significant gaps in\n\nthe broad, protective coverage Congress sought to ensure in adopting the FLSA.\n\n      Although our two-step test will, consistent with congressional intent, extend\n\nFLSA protection to individuals who are independent contractors when their work\n\nfor each entity is considered separately but employees when their work is\n\nconsidered in the aggregate, it will not automatically render every independent\n\ncontractor who performs services for two or more entities an “employee” within\n\nthe FLSA’s scope. Rather, under this two-step inquiry, individuals who bear true\n\nhallmarks of independent contractor status will remain outside of the FLSA’s\n\nscope even if they perform work for two or more entities that are “not completely\n\ndisassociated” with respect to those individuals’ work. For instance, two\n\nbusinesses agreeing to share the services of a single handyman may not be\n\n“completely disassociated” when they arrange for the handyman to perform\n\nservices on their premises at mutually acceptable times. But, if the handyman\n\nowns his own tools and provides his own materials, can choose to stop working for\n\neither or both businesses of his own accord, and is not an integral part of either\n\nbusiness’s principal purpose, he may nonetheless remain an independent contractor\n\nfor purposes of the FLSA. Accordingly, the businesses, despite their incomplete\n\n\n                                        21\n\fdisassociation, would have no obligations under the FLSA with respect to the\n\nhandyman. 8\n\n      Through properly segregating and organizing these two distinct questions,\n\nthe analytical framework we embraced in Schultz “leads to a proper determination\n\nof whether, as a matter of economic reality, the [plaintiffs] were dependent on the\n\njoint employers or whether they were in business for themselves.” 466 F.3d at\n\n307. By contrast, by inverting that framework, the district court in this case failed\n\nto consider whether Defendants’ shared influence over Plaintiffs’ day-to-day work\n\nrendered Plaintiffs economically dependent on DIRECTV and DirectSat during\n\ntheir respective periods of employment, such that Plaintiffs constituted\n\n“employees” under the FLSA.\n\n                                         B.\n\n                                         1.\n\n      Although the district court’s inversion of the two-step Schultz framework\n\nalone would warrant reversal, the district court compounded its error by relying on\n\nBonnette to consider the sufficiency of Plaintiffs’ joint employment allegations.\n\n\n\n      8\n        By the same token, a business that is deemed a joint employer under the\nFLSA as to some of its workers will not automatically be required to comply with\nthe FLSA with respect to all of its workers. Some workers may be independent\ncontractors ineligible for FLSA protection even though they perform services for\nthe defendant and at least one other entity that is “not completely disassociated”\nwith respect to the plaintiff’s work.\n                                         22\n\f      We recently joined many of our sister circuits in concluding that the\n\nBonnette Court’s reliance on common-law agency principles ignores Congress’s\n\nintent to ensure that the FLSA protects workers whose employment arrangements\n\ndo not conform to the bounds of common-law agency relationships. Salinas, No.\n\n15-1915, slip op. at 21. In instructing district courts not to follow Bonnette, we\n\nemphasized two additional concerns with existing joint employment tests. Id.\n\nSpecifically, we explained that these tests: “(1) improperly focus on the\n\nrelationship between the employee and putative joint employer, rather than on the\n\nrelationship between the putative joint employers, and (2) incorrectly frame the\n\njoint employment inquiry as solely a question of an employee’s ‘economic\n\ndependence’ on a putative joint employer.” Id.\n\n      With this in mind, instead of adopting a previously existing test, we\n\narticulated a new standard that draws on the history and purpose of the FLSA, as\n\nwell as the Department of Labor regulation that implements the statute and\n\nrecognizes the existence of joint employment arrangements. Id. at 30–32. Under\n\nour framework, the “fundamental question” guiding the joint employment analysis\n\nis “whether two or more persons or entities are ‘not completely disassociated’ with\n\nrespect to a worker such that the persons or entities share, agree to allocate\n\nresponsibility for, or otherwise codetermine—formally or informally, directly or\n\n\n\n\n                                        23\n\findirectly—the essential terms and conditions of the worker’s employment.” Id. at\n\n31.\n\n      To assist lower courts in determining whether the relationship between two\n\nentities gives rise to joint employment, we identified the following six,\n\nnonexhaustive factors to consider:\n\n      (1)   Whether, formally or as a matter of practice, the putative joint\n            employers jointly determine, share, or allocate the ability to\n            direct, control, or supervise the worker, whether by direct or\n            indirect means;\n\n      (2)   Whether, formally or as a matter of practice, the putative joint\n            employers jointly determine, share, or allocate the power to—\n            directly or indirectly—hire or fire the worker or modify the\n            terms or conditions of the worker’s employment;\n\n      (3)   The degree of permanency and duration of the relationship\n            between the putative joint employers;\n\n      (4)   Whether through shared management or a direct or indirect\n            ownership interest, one putative joint employer controls, is\n            controlled by, or is under common control with the other\n            putative joint employer;\n\n      (5)   Whether the work is performed on a premises owned or\n            controlled by one or more of the putative joint employers,\n            independently or in connection with one another; and\n\n      (6)   Whether, formally or as a matter of practice, the putative joint\n            employers jointly determine, share, or allocate responsibility\n            over functions ordinarily carried out by an employer, such as\n            handling payroll; providing workers’ compensation insurance;\n            paying payroll taxes; or providing the facilities, equipment,\n            tools, or materials necessary to complete the work.\n\n\n\n                                       24\n\fId. at 31–32. Further, because the status of a particular employment relationship is\n\nhighly fact-dependent, we emphasized that the absence of a single factor—or even\n\na majority of factors—is not determinative of whether joint employment does or\n\ndoes not exist. Id. at 32–33.\n\n      Much like its misapplication of the two-step framework set forth in Schultz,\n\nthe district court’s reliance on the Bonnette factors in this case rendered the court’s\n\nconsideration of Plaintiffs’ joint employment allegations fundamentally flawed and\n\nunduly restrictive.9 In particular, the district court’s control-based analysis omitted\n\nconsideration of the relationship between the putative joint employers and thus\n\nignored important elements of coordination between Defendants, as well as many\n\nof Defendants’ shared levers of influence over Plaintiffs’ work as DIRECTV\n\ntechnicians. Because the district court applied an improper test in determining\n\nwhether Plaintiffs were “separate[ly]” or “joint[ly]” employed, the court erred in\n\ngranting Defendants’ motions to dismiss.\n\n                                          2.\n\n      Beyond this initial error, we also reject the district court’s assertion that an\n\nFLSA defendant, like DIRECTV, that does not directly employ a plaintiff is\n\nsubject to joint employment liability only if the plaintiff’s direct employer\n\n      9\n         Given the confused state of FLSA joint employment case law—and that\nthis Court had not yet identified factors for courts to consider in distinguishing\nseparate employment from joint employment at the time the district court rendered\nits decision—this error is more than understandable.\n                                          25\n\f“slavishly followed every suggestion made by [the defendant] in regard to the\n\nstatus and method of payment of the [plaintiff].” Hall, 2015 WL 4064692, at *2\n\n(emphasis added). As we explained previously, to determine whether “separate” or\n\n“joint” employment exists, courts must focus on whether putative joint employers\n\n“share, agree to allocate responsibility for, or otherwise codetermine” the essential\n\nterms and conditions of a worker’s employment. Salinas, No. 15-1915, slip op. at\n\n4 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the FLSA does not require that an entity have\n\nunchecked—or even primary—authority over all—or even most—aspects of a\n\nworker’s employment for the entity to qualify as a joint employer. Rather, the\n\nentity must only play a role in establishing the key terms and conditions of the\n\nworker’s employment.\n\n      For this reason, we further reject the district court’s conclusion that for\n\njoint—as opposed to separate—employment to exist, a majority of factors must\n\nweigh in favor of joint employment. Hall, 2015 WL 4064692, at *2 (finding no\n\njoint employment under the four-factor Bonnette test, notwithstanding that\n\nPlaintiffs “alleged facts sufficient to show that DIRECTV at least indirectly\n\nsupervised their work and directly controlled their schedules,” because the\n\nremaining three factors weighed in favor of separate employment).                The\n\nDepartment of Labor’s regulation implementing the joint employment doctrine\n\nrequires that the “determination of whether the employment by the employers is to\n\n\n                                         26\n\fbe considered joint employment or separate and distinct employment for purposes\n\nof the [FLSA] depends upon all the facts in the particular case.” 29 C.F.R. §\n\n791.2(a) (emphasis added).      To that end, the nonexclusive factors we have\n\nidentified to guide the first step of the joint employment inquiry “offer[] a way to\n\nthink about [whether entities are joint or separate employers,] not an algorithm.”\n\nReyes v. Remington Hybrid Seed Co., 495 F.3d 403, 408 (7th Cir. 2007).\n\nAccordingly, “toting up a score is not enough.” Id. Rather, “one factor alone”—\n\nsuch as DIRECTV’s supervision and control of Plaintiffs’ schedules—can give rise\n\nto a reasonable inference that plaintiffs will be able to develop evidence\n\nestablishing “that two or more persons or entities are ‘not completely\n\ndisassociated’ with respect to a worker’s employment if the [allegations]\n\nsupporting that factor demonstrate that the person or entity has a substantial role in\n\ndetermining the terms and conditions of a worker’s employment.” Salinas, No. 15-\n\n1915, slip op. at 32–33.\n\n      This is particularly true at the pleading stage, when plaintiffs have had no\n\n“opportunity for discovery as to payroll and taxation documents, disciplinary\n\nrecords, internal corporate communications, or leadership and ownership\n\nstructures.” Thompson v. Real Estate Mortg. Network, 748 F.3d 142, 145 (3d Cir.\n\n2014); see also Ash v. Anderson Merchandisers, LLC, 799 F.3d 957, 961 (8th Cir.\n\n2015) (holding that, at the pleading stage, plaintiffs relying on a joint employer\n\n\n                                         27\n\ftheory are “not required to determine conclusively which [defendant] was their\n\nemployer . . . or describe in detail the employer’s corporate structure”).\n\n      We likewise reject the district court’s suggestion that an FLSA plaintiff may\n\nhold a defendant that does not directly employ the plaintiff liable as a joint\n\nemployer only if the plaintiff alleges that his direct employer was\n\n“undercapitalized” and that the arrangement between the defendant and the direct\n\nemployer was a “mere[] charade[].” Hall, 2015 WL 4064692, at *2. To be sure,\n\n“facts demonstrating that two entities jointly engaged in a bad faith effort to evade\n\ncompliance with the FLSA . . . will provide strong evidence that the entities are\n\n‘not completely disassociated’ with respect to that worker’s employment.”\n\nSalinas, No. 15-1915, slip op. at 39. But bad faith is not a precondition to liability\n\nas a joint employer. Id. at 39–40.\n\n      Additionally, even if allegations of bad faith were required—which they are\n\nnot—Plaintiffs explicitly allege that the DIRECTV Provider Network was\n\n“purposefully designed to exercise the right of control over DIRECTV’s technician\n\ncorps while avoiding the responsibility of complying with the requirements of the\n\nFLSA.” J.A. 97 (emphasis added). Thus, the challenged employment scheme\n\n“ensure[s] [that] DIRECTV controls its technicians’ work, while deliberately\n\ndisclaiming their status as employees under state and federal employment laws.”\n\nId. at 101 (emphasis added). The district court improperly failed to credit these\n\n\n                                          28\n\fallegations of bad faith—despite the requirement that it do so in ruling on a motion\n\nto dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6)—in dismissing Plaintiffs’ claim.\n\n                                        C.\n\n      The district court’s errors notwithstanding, we may affirm the disposition of\n\nDefendants’ motions to dismiss “on any grounds supported by the record,\n\nnotwithstanding the reasoning of the district court.” Tankersley v. Almand, 837\n\nF.3d 390, 395 (4th Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, to\n\ndetermine whether reversal is warranted in this case, we must consider whether,\n\napplying the appropriate legal standards, Plaintiffs’ allegations are sufficient to\n\nstate a plausible FLSA joint employment claim against Defendants.\n\n                                         1.\n\n      As previously explained, to determine whether Plaintiffs have alleged a\n\nplausible FLSA joint employment claim, we must first consider whether—taking\n\nPlaintiffs’ allegations, and all reasonable inferences therefrom, as true—\n\nDefendants were “entirely independent” with respect to Plaintiffs’ work as\n\nDIRECTV technicians, 29 C.F.R. § 791.2(a), or, instead, codetermined the\n\nessential terms and conditions of that work, Salinas, No. 15-1915, slip op. at 30.\n\nAnalyzing this fundamental question using the six factors set forth above to guide\n\nour inquiry, we conclude that Plaintiffs’ factual allegations establish that\n\n\n\n\n                                        29\n\fDIRECTV, DirectSat, and other members of the DIRECTV Provider Network\n\njointly determined the key terms and conditions of Plaintiffs’ employment.\n\n      To begin with, Plaintiffs allege that DIRECTV, DirectSat, and the other\n\nHome and Secondary Service Providers instituted and operated a fissured\n\nemployment scheme, governed by a web of provider agreements, that endured\n\nthroughout Plaintiffs’ periods of employment as DIRECTV technicians and was\n\nessential to the installation and repair of DIRECTV’s own products. DIRECTV\n\nwas the principal—and, in many cases, only—client of the lower-level\n\nsubcontractors, and DIRECTV often infused capital into or formally “absorb[ed]”\n\nthe subcontractors when necessary. J.A. 97.\n\n      Moreover, according to the Complaint, DIRECTV and DirectSat allocated,\n\nthrough provider agreements with one another and with subcontractors in the\n\nProvider Network, the authority to direct, control, and supervise nearly every\n\naspect of Plaintiffs’ day-to-day job duties. For example, through these contractual\n\narrangements, DIRECTV compelled Plaintiffs to obtain their work schedules and\n\njob assignments through DIRECTV’s centralized system and to follow\n\n“particularized methods and standards of installation to assure DIRECTV’s\n\nequipment is installed according to the dictates of DIRECTV’s policies and\n\nprocedures.” J.A. 96. And DIRECTV’s provider agreements also allowed the\n\ncompany “to control nearly every facet of the technicians’ work,” including by\n\n\n                                        30\n\frequiring Plaintiffs to hold themselves out as representatives of the company, to\n\nwear DIRECTV uniforms, to carry DIRECTV identification cards, and to display\n\nthe company’s logo on their vehicles when performing work for the company. J.A.\n\n96–97.\n\n        Contrary to the district court’s assertion that Plaintiffs failed to allege “facts\n\nthat would show that DIRECTV has the power to hire and fire technicians [or]\n\ndetermine their rate and method of payment,” Hall, 2015 WL 4064692, at *2, the\n\nComplaint is replete with allegations that DIRECTV, DirectSat, and other\n\nmembers of the Provider Network shared authority over hiring, firing, and\n\ncompensation. Regarding hiring and firing, the Complaint alleges that “DIRECTV\n\nset forth the qualification ‘hiring’ criteria” for technicians, including Plaintiffs,\n\nwhile DirectSat and other Home and Secondary Service Providers “implemented\n\nand enforced those qualifications.”        J.A. 94.    And although Plaintiffs’ direct\n\nemployers had formal firing authority, DIRECTV used its centralized work-\n\nassignment system to effectively terminate technicians by ceasing to assign them\n\nwork.\n\n        DIRECTV and members of its Provider Network also shared authority over\n\ntechnicians’ compensation.       Whereas DirectSat or other subcontractors issued\n\nPlaintiffs’ paychecks, DIRECTV played an integral role in setting Plaintiffs’\n\ncompensation.      For instance, the Complaint alleges that DIRECTV retained\n\n\n                                            31\n\fauthority in its provider agreements to determine whether work performed by\n\nDIRECTV       technicians,   including    Plaintiffs,   was    “compensable”     or\n\n“noncompensable.” J.A. 100. Plaintiffs characterize this compensation scheme as\n\na “piece-rate” system, through which Plaintiffs were paid a particular rate based on\n\nthe specific tasks they performed. Id. A piece-rate system is permissible under the\n\nFLSA only where the parties agree that all of an employee’s hours, including\n\nnonproductive hours, are compensated and included in the employee’s total\n\nworking time and where the employer continues to comply with the statute’s\n\novertime provisions. See 29 C.F.R. § 778.318.\n\n      In addition to compensable work, Plaintiffs also regularly performed\n\nadditional tasks that, although essential to the installation and operation of\n\nDIRECTV products, went uncompensated by either DIRECTV or its providers.\n\nThis work included “assembling satellite dishes, driving to and between job\n\nassignments, reviewing and receiving schedules, calling customers to confirm\n\ninstallations, obtaining required supplies, assisting other technicians with\n\ninstallations, performing required customer educations, contacting DIRECTV to\n\nreport in or activate service, working on installations that were not completed, and\n\n. . . perform[ing] additional work on installations previously completed.” J.A. 103.\n\nDIRECTV also retained authority over compensation by imposing “chargebacks\n\nand/or rollbacks” on a technician’s pay when DIRECTV determined, in its sole\n\n\n                                         32\n\fauthority, that the technician provided unsatisfactory service. Id. at 101. By\n\nmaintaining authority to determine what work would be deemed compensable and\n\nto impose chargebacks, DIRECTV retained significant authority over the manner\n\nand method by which Plaintiffs and other technicians were paid for their work.\n\n      Regarding DirectSat, Plaintiffs Lewis and Wood assert that the company—\n\nin its role as a middle-manager in the DIRECTV Provider Network—implemented\n\nDIRECTV’s hiring and training criteria, relayed scheduling decisions to\n\nDIRECTV technicians, and required technicians to obtain DIRECTV equipment\n\nand attend DIRECTV-mandated trainings at its facilities. Moreover, Lewis and\n\nWood allege that DirectSat maintained employment records for all technicians who\n\nperformed work for the company, which records DIRECTV reviewed and audited.\n\n      Of course, later discovery may demonstrate that DIRECTV and DirectSat\n\ndid not “share, agree to allocate responsibility for, or otherwise codetermine . . . the\n\nessential terms and conditions of” Plaintiffs’ employment, Salinas, No. 15-1915,\n\nslip op. at 31, or that neither Lewis nor Wood was employed, either directly or\n\nindirectly, by DirectSat.    At this stage of the litigation, however, Plaintiffs’\n\nallegations are sufficient to make out a plausible claim that DirectSat was “not\n\ncompletely disassociated” from DIRECTV and other service providers with regard\n\nto setting the essential conditions under which Plaintiffs Lewis and Wood worked\n\nin their capacities as DIRECTV technicians.\n\n\n                                          33\n\f                                        2.\n\n      Having established that Plaintiffs’ allegations sufficiently demonstrate that\n\nDIRECTV and DirectSat were not completely disassociated with respect to\n\nPlaintiffs’ work as DIRECTV technicians, we now turn to the second step of the\n\njoint employment inquiry. In particular, we must consider whether, from the\n\nperspective of Plaintiffs’ “one employment” with DIRECTV and DirectSat (or\n\nother applicable entities within DIRECTV’s tiered structure), Plaintiffs have\n\nsufficiently alleged that they were employees, as opposed to independent\n\ncontractors, for purposes of the FLSA. Schultz, 466 F.3d at 307. Under the one-\n\nemployment theory described above, we consider the entire context of Plaintiffs’\n\nwork on behalf of DIRECTV and DirectSat and aggregate those aspects of that\n\nwork that Defendants, either jointly or individually, influenced, controlled, or\n\ndetermined. Id.\n\n      To determine whether Plaintiffs are properly classified as employees or\n\nindependent contractors under the FLSA, we focus on the “‘economic realities’ of\n\nthe relationship” between the defendants and the plaintiffs. Id. at 304 (quoting\n\nHenderson v. Inter–Chem Coal Co., 41 F.3d 567, 570 (10th Cir. 1994)). In\n\nparticular, we consider whether, in performing their work as DIRECTV\n\ntechnicians, Plaintiffs were “economically dependent” on Defendants or, instead,\n\nwere “in business for [themselves].” Id. at 304. To make this determination, we\n\n\n                                        34\n\flook to the six factors identified by the Supreme Court in United States v. Silk, 331\n\nU.S. 704 (1947). These factors include: “(1) the degree of control that the putative\n\nemployer[s] ha[ve] over the manner in which the work is performed; (2) the\n\nworker’s opportunities for profit or loss dependent on his managerial skill; (3) the\n\nworker’s investment in equipment or material, or his employment of other\n\nworkers; (4) the degree of skill required for the work; (5) the permanence of the\n\nworking relationship; and (6) the degree to which the services rendered are an\n\nintegral part of the putative employer[s’] business.” Id. at 304–05.\n\n      With these factors in mind, we conclude that Plaintiffs’ allegations\n\ndemonstrate that Plaintiffs were effectively economically dependent on Defendants\n\nwhile serving as DIRECTV technicians. As alleged by Plaintiffs, Defendants\n\ncollectively influenced nearly every aspect of Plaintiffs’ work as DIRECTV\n\ntechnicians.   In particular, through its agreements with lower-level providers,\n\nDIRECTV largely determined who would be hired as a DIRECTV technician and\n\nexclusively determined the manner in which technicians would be compensated for\n\ntheir time. Although technicians, like Plaintiffs, largely supplied their own tools,\n\nDIRECTV provided the materials to be installed for DIRECTV customers and\n\ndetermined whether Plaintiffs’ pay for performing particular services would be\n\ndeducted for any reason previously established by DIRECTV.                Therefore,\n\n\n\n\n                                         35\n\fPlaintiffs could not increase their take-home pay through their own ingenuity or\n\nskill.\n\n         Through its required training materials and centralized work-assignment\n\nsystem, DIRECTV also dictated the manner in which technicians performed their\n\nwork and controlled whether and when Plaintiffs could install and repair\n\nDIRECTV products. DIRECTV so extensively controlled Plaintiffs’ day-to-day—\n\nindeed, hour-to-hour—work that the company not only required technicians to use\n\nequipment belonging to DIRECTV, but in fact expected technicians to hold\n\nthemselves out as the company’s representatives to customers by wearing\n\nDIRECTV uniforms and nametags and driving vehicles emblazoned with\n\nDIRECTV’s logo.         Finally, Plaintiffs’ work was integral to DIRECTV’s\n\nbusiness—absent Plaintiffs’ work installing and repairing DIRECTV satellite\n\nsystems, DIRECTV would be unable to convey its product to consumers.\n\n         At the same time, although DirectSat apparently maintained relatively\n\nlimited authority over the manner in which technicians working under its purview\n\nperformed their work, Plaintiffs Lewis and Wood allege that the company was\n\nresponsible for implementing and enforcing many of DIRECTV’s mandates for its\n\ntechnicians.    As noted, this arrangement endured throughout these Plaintiffs’\n\nrespective periods of employment as technicians, during which time their\n\ninstallation and repair activities were essential to DIRECTV’s provision of satellite\n\n\n                                         36\n\ftelevision service to its customers. As such, and because we consider Plaintiffs’\n\nemployment for DIRECTV and DirectSat in the aggregate, these allegations amply\n\ndemonstrate that Plaintiffs, like other DIRECTV technicians, were economically\n\ndependent on DIRECTV and its affiliate providers in connection with their work\n\non the company’s behalf. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have stated a plausible claim that\n\nDIRECTV—and, as to Plaintiffs Wood and Lewis, DirectSat—was their joint\n\nemployer under the FLSA and that Plaintiffs were “employees” within the meaning\n\nof the FLSA.\n\n                             *            *             *\n\n      In sum, Plaintiffs adequately allege that DIRECTV, DirectSat, and\n\nsubcontractors in the DIRECTV Provider Network shared responsibility for and\n\ncodetermined the essential terms and conditions of Plaintiffs’ employment as\n\ntechnicians. Plaintiffs’ allegations further establish that—when viewed from the\n\nperspective of Plaintiffs’ “one employment” with DIRECTV, DirectSat, and other\n\nsubcontractors in the Provider Network—Plaintiffs were economically dependent\n\non—and therefore jointly employed by—DIRECTV and DirectSat. Accordingly,\n\nthe district court erred in dismissing Plaintiffs’ FLSA claims on grounds that\n\nPlaintiffs failed to adequately establish joint employment. 10\n\n\n      10\n        Defendants agree that Plaintiffs’ claims under the Maryland Wage and\nHour Law “stand or fall on the success” of their FLSA claims. Appellees’ Br. at\n37–38 (citing Turner v. Human Genome Sci., Inc., 292 F. Supp. 2d 738, 744 (D.\n                                          37\n\f                                         IV.\n\n      Finally, Defendants ask, in the alternative, that we affirm the district court’s\n\ndismissal of Plaintiffs’ FLSA claims on the ground that Plaintiffs fail to articulate a\n\nsufficiently detailed accounting of the number of uncompensated hours they\n\nMd. 2003)). Consequently, our resolution of the FLSA joint employment question\nalso resolves Plaintiffs’ claims under this parallel Maryland statute.\n\n      At the same time, however, Plaintiffs concede that the definitions of\n“employer” included in the Maryland Workplace Fraud Act and the Maryland\nWage Payment and Collection Law are “technically narrower” than the definition\nembraced by the FLSA. Appellants’ Br. at 16 (internal quotations omitted)\n(quoting Skrzecz, 2014 WL 3400614, at *7 n.7). Because the district court errantly\nconcluded that Plaintiffs failed to adequately allege joint employment for purposes\nof the FLSA, it did not address whether Defendants constitute “employers” for\npurposes of the Workplace Fraud Act and Wage Payment and Collection Law.\nHall, 2015 WL 4064692, at *3. We remand those claims to the district court to\nreconsider whether Plaintiffs have stated a claim under the relevant state-law tests\nand the proper standard for reviewing motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).\n\n       We further note that, in passing upon Plaintiffs’ state law claims, the district\ncourt incorrectly suggested that the Maryland Wage and Hour Law and Workplace\nFraud Act share a common definition of covered “employers,” while the state’s\nWage Payment and Collection Law employs a narrower definition of that term.\nSee Hall, 2015 WL 4064692, at *3. In fact, it is the Workplace Fraud Act and\nWage Payment and Collection Law that share a substantially similar definition,\nwhich diverges slightly from the definitions included in the FLSA and the\nanalogous Wage and Hour Law. Compare 29 U.S.C.A. § 203(d) (FLSA, defining\n“employer” to include “any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an\nemployer in relation to an employee . . . ”) and Md. Code Ann., Lab. & Empl. § 3-\n401 (Wage and Hour Law, defining “employer” to include “a person who acts\ndirectly or indirectly in the interest of another employer with an employee”), with\nMd. Code Ann., Lab. & Empl. § 3-501(b) (Wage Payment and Collection Law,\ndefining “employer” to include “any person who employs an individual . . . or a\nsuccessor of the person”) and Md. Code Ann., Lab. & Empl. § 3-901(c)\n(Workplace Fraud Act, defining “employer” to mean “any person that employs an\nindividual . . . .”).\n                                          38\n\fworked during their respective periods of employment to state a claim for unpaid\n\novertime wages under the FLSA. Courts are divided as to the level of detail an\n\nFLSA overtime claimant must provide to overcome a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to\n\ndismiss. See Butler v. DirectSat USA, LLC, 800 F. Supp. 2d 662, 667–68 (D. Md.\n\n2011) (summarizing differing approaches). On one hand, a number of lower courts\n\nhave adopted an approach under which plaintiffs are required to provide an\n\napproximation of the number of hours for which they were inadequately\n\ncompensated to state a plausible overtime claim. See, e.g., Jones v. Casey’s Gen.\n\nStores, 538 F. Supp. 2d 1094, 1102–03 (S.D. Iowa 2008). Although the precise\n\ndegree of specificity required under this standard is less than clear, courts have\n\nexpressed well-founded skepticism of such an unduly demanding pleading\n\nstandard in overtime cases. See Butler, 800 F. Supp. 2d at 668 (noting that,\n\n“[w]hile [the d]efendants might appreciate having [the p]laintiffs’ estimate of the\n\novertime hours worked . . . , it would be subject to change during discovery and\n\nif/when the size of the collective action grows and thus of limited value” at the\n\npleading stage); see also Landers v. Quality Commc’ns, Inc., 771 F.3d 638, 645\n\n(9th Cir. 2014), cert. denied, 135 S. Ct. 1845 (2015) (observing that “most (if not\n\nall) of the detailed information concerning a plaintiff-employee’s compensation\n\nand schedule is in the control of the defendants” (citing Pruell v. Caritas Christi,\n\n678 F.3d 10, 15 (1st Cir. 2012))).\n\n\n                                        39\n\f      On the other hand, at least three other circuits have adopted a more lenient\n\napproach, requiring plaintiffs only to “sufficiently allege 40 hours of work in a\n\ngiven workweek as well as some uncompensated time in excess of the 40 hours.”\n\nLundy v. Catholic Health Sys. of Long Island Inc., 711 F.3d 106, 114 (2d Cir.\n\n2013); Davis v. Abington Mem. Hosp., 765 F.3d 236, 241–43 (3d Cir. 2014)\n\n(adopting Lundy standard); Landers, 771 F.3d at 644–45 (same); see also Manning\n\nv. Bos. Med. Ctr. Corp., 725 F.3d 34, 46–47 (1st Cir. 2013) (applying the Lundy\n\nstandard to conclude that plaintiffs alleged sufficient facts to survive dismissal); cf.\n\nSec’y of Labor v. Labbe, 319 F. App’x 761, 763 (11th Cir. 2008) (per curiam)\n\n(unpublished) (reasoning that, given the relative simplicity of FLSA overtime\n\nclaims, extensive pleading is generally unnecessary and allowing claims to proceed\n\nbased on allegations that defendant “repeatedly violated stated provisions of the\n\nFLSA by failing to pay covered employees minimum hourly wages and to\n\ncompensate employees who worked in excess of forty hours a week at the\n\nappropriate rates”).\n\n      Reviewing these decisions, we are persuaded to adopt the latter approach.\n\nThus, to make out a plausible overtime claim, a plaintiff must provide sufficient\n\nfactual allegations to support a reasonable inference that he or she worked more\n\nthan forty hours in at least one workweek and that his or her employer failed to pay\n\nthe requisite overtime premium for those overtime hours. Under this standard,\n\n\n                                          40\n\fplaintiffs seeking to overcome a motion to dismiss must do more than merely\n\nallege that they regularly worked in excess of forty hours per week without\n\nreceiving overtime pay. See Pruell, 678 F.3d at 13; Dejesus v. HF Mgmt. Servs.,\n\nLLC, 726 F.3d 85, 90 (2d Cir. 2013) (explaining that the “requirement that\n\nplaintiffs must allege overtime without compensation in a ‘given’ workweek [is]\n\nnot an invitation to provide an all-purpose pleading template alleging overtime in\n\n‘some or all workweeks’”).\n\n      At the same time, however, we emphasize that the standard we today adopt\n\ndoes not require plaintiffs to identify a particular week in which they worked\n\nuncompensated overtime hours.      Rather, this standard is intended “to require\n\nplaintiffs to provide some factual context that will ‘nudge’ their claim ‘from\n\nconceivable to plausible.’” Dejesus, 726 F.3d at 90 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at\n\n570). Thus, to state a plausible FLSA overtime claim, plaintiffs “must provide\n\nsufficient detail about the length and frequency of their unpaid work to support a\n\nreasonable inference that they worked more than forty hours in a given week.”\n\nNakahata v. N.Y.-Presbyterian Healthcare Sys., Inc., 723 F.3d 192, 201 (2d Cir.\n\n2013). A plaintiff may meet this initial standard “by estimating the length of her\n\naverage workweek during the applicable period and the average rate at which she\n\nwas paid, the amount of overtime wages she believes she is owed, or any other\n\nfacts that will permit the court to find plausibility.” Landers, 771 F.3d at 645\n\n\n                                       41\n\f(emphasis added) (citing Pruell, 678 F.3d at 14); see also Davis, 765 F.3d at 243\n\n(explaining that “a plaintiff’s claim that she ‘typically’ worked forty hours per\n\nweek, worked extra hours during such a forty-hour week, and was not\n\ncompensated for extra hours beyond forty hours he or she worked during one or\n\nmore of those forty-hour weeks, would suffice” (emphasis in original)).\n\n      Applying this standard here, we conclude that Plaintiffs’ allegations provide\n\na sufficient basis to support a reasonable inference that Plaintiffs worked\n\nuncompensated overtime hours while serving as DIRECTV technicians.             The\n\ngravamen of Plaintiffs’ Complaint is that, under DIRECTV’s piece-rate\n\ncompensation system (the terms of which Plaintiffs allege were not properly\n\nmemorialized, as required by the FLSA), Plaintiffs consistently performed\n\nsignificant work for which they received inadequate compensation. As a result,\n\nPlaintiffs assert that, taking into account their total compensation and the number\n\nof hours they worked on behalf of Defendants, their final pay “did not reflect\n\ncompensation for all hours worked and they were not properly compensated for\n\novertime hours.” J.A. 104.\n\n      As compared to a more traditional overtime claim based on an employee’s\n\nstandard hourly wage, Defendants’ alleged piece-rate compensation system\n\npresents certain additional complexity under the FLSA. See 29 U.S.C. § 207(g)\n\n(setting out various methods by which an employer may comply with the statute’s\n\n\n                                        42\n\fovertime provisions under a piece-rate compensation scheme). At this stage of the\n\nlitigation, however, we need not wade into these murky waters. Instead, our\n\nconsideration of the sufficiency of Plaintiffs’ claims must again focus on the\n\ndegree to which Plaintiffs have alleged that they worked more than forty hours in a\n\nworkweek and were not properly compensated for those additional hours.\n\nLanders, 771 F.3d at 645 (applying the Lundy standard to consider overtime\n\nallegations arising out of an employer’s piece-rate compensation system).\n\n      In this case, in addition to their common allegations regarding the nature and\n\nstructure of the DIRECTV Provider Network, Plaintiffs each describe in some\n\ndetail their regular work schedules, rates of pay, and uncompensated work time.\n\nSpecifically, each Plaintiff provides an approximation of his general workweek,\n\nwith each Plaintiff alleging that he typically worked in excess (and, in some cases,\n\nwell in excess) of forty hours per week. Supplementing these initial allegations,\n\neach Plaintiff further estimates the number of hours he worked in any given week,\n\nincluding a breakdown of the number of compensable and noncompensable hours\n\nhe typically worked, as well as his average weekly pay and the amount by which\n\nthis weekly compensation was typically reduced through DIRECTV-imposed\n\npenalties and unreimbursed business expenses.\n\n      This final level of granularity, coupled with Plaintiffs’ common allegations\n\nregarding the types of work DIRECTV designated as compensable and\n\n\n                                        43\n\fnoncompensable, ultimately nudges Plaintiffs’ claims against Defendants from the\n\nmerely conceivable to the plausible. At this initial stage, that is all that is required\n\nto overcome Defendants’ motion to dismiss.            Cf. Landers 771 F.3d at 646\n\n(dismissing FLSA claims where the complaint lacked “any detail regarding a given\n\nworkweek when [the plaintiff] worked in excess of forty hours and was not paid\n\novertime for that given workweek and/or was not paid minimum wages”).\n\nAlthough Plaintiffs may ultimately be unable to substantiate their allegations\n\nthrough discovery, they have sufficiently alleged a plausible claim to unpaid\n\novertime for their work on behalf of Defendants.\n\n      The district court’s summary dismissal of Plaintiffs Wood and Lewis’s\n\nclaims against DirectSat suffers from a similar infirmity. 11 Contrary to the district\n\n\n\n      11\n         In disposing of these claims, which are pursued only by Plaintiffs Wood\nand Lewis, the district court first questioned the sufficiency of these Plaintiffs’\nallegations regarding when they were employed by DirectSat and suggested,\nwithout explanation or citation, that their claims against the company “may be\ntime-barred.” Hall, 2015 WL 4064692, at *3. In fact, however, Wood and Lewis\nspecifically allege that they worked as satellite technicians for DIRECTV,\nDirectSat, and other entities until 2011 and 2012, respectively.\n\n      In addition to DIRECTV and DirectSat, each of these Plaintiffs indicates\nthat he worked as a DIRECTV satellite technician for at least one other entity\nduring the relevant period, with Plaintiff Lewis indicating that he was involuntarily\nterminated by an entity called Commercial Wiring Incorporated in December 2012.\nImportantly, plaintiffs alleging joint employment under the FLSA need not\n“determine conclusively which [defendant] was their employer at the pleadings\nstage or describe in detail the employer’s corporate structure.” Ash, 799 F.3d at\n961. Rather, at this preliminary stage, it is enough that both Lewis and Wood\n                                          44\n\fcourt’s submission that these Plaintiffs’ allegations suggest that they were “paid an\n\namount greater than that required by the FLSA,” Hall, 2015 WL 4064692, at *3,\n\nboth Lewis and Wood expressly allege that they regularly performed\n\nuncompensated overtime work for Defendants during the course of their\n\nemployment as DIRECTV technicians.\n\n      Though again unsupported by any citation or other reasoning, the district\n\ncourt’s suggestion that Plaintiffs Lewis and Wood fail to state a claim because their\n\nfinal pay was “greater than required under the FLSA” suggests a fundamental\n\nmisapprehension of the statute’s requirements. In addition to setting a federal\n\nminimum wage, the FLSA separately requires employers to pay their workers an\n\novertime premium for hours worked in excess of forty per week. 29 U.S.C. § 207.\n\nFor this reason, even assuming Plaintiffs Lewis and Wood each received an\n\neffective hourly wage above the minimum rate established by the FLSA, their\n\novertime claims against Defendants are sufficiently pleaded to survive the present\n\nmotions to dismiss.\n\n                                         V.\n\n      Under the appropriate legal standards, Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts\n\nto make out a plausible claim that Defendants jointly employed them as DIRECTV\n\ntechnicians. As such, Defendants may be held jointly and severally liable in the\n\nallege that they worked as DIRECTV technicians for DirectSat during the relevant\nperiod to overcome Defendants’ motions to dismiss.\n                                         45\n\fevent that Plaintiffs performed uncompensated overtime work for Defendants\n\nduring Plaintiffs’ respective periods of employment.    Because Plaintiffs have\n\nsufficiently pleaded (1) that DIRECTV—and, as to Plaintiffs Lewis and Wood,\n\nDirectSat—jointly employed them as satellite technicians and (2) that they are\n\nowed some amount of unpaid overtime compensation, we reverse the district\n\ncourt’s dismissal of Plaintiffs’ FLSA and Maryland state-law claims against\n\nDefendants and remand these consolidated cases for further proceedings consistent\n\nwith this opinion.\n\n                                                  REVERSED AND REMANDED\n\n\n\n\n                                       46\n\f",

In addition to employing some technicians directly,\n\nDIRECTV controls and manages many technicians through the DIRECTV\n\n“Provider Network.” J.A. 93. According to the Amended Consolidated Complaint\n\n(“Complaint”), this network is organized as a pyramid, with DIRECTV contracting\n\nwith certain intermediary entities known as “Home Service Providers” and\n\n“Secondary Service Providers.” J.A. 93–94. These intermediary entities generally\n\ncontract with “a patchwork of largely captive entities”—referred to in the\n\nComplaint as “subcontractors”—which in turn contract directly with individual\n\ntechnicians throughout the country. J.A. 94.\n\n      Following DIRECTV’s acquisition of numerous Home and Secondary\n\nService Providers, Defendant DirectSat was one of three “independent” Home\n\n\n                                           5\n\fService Providers remaining in the DIRECTV Provider Network at the time this\n\naction was initiated.2 In this capacity, DirectSat served as a middle-manager\n\nbetween DIRECTV and individual technicians who contracted directly with\n\nDIRECTV, as well as between DIRECTV and various subcontractors that hired\n\nindividual technicians. Specifically, DirectSat, like the other Home and Secondary\n\nService Providers, implemented and enforced DIRECTV’s hiring criteria for\n\ntechnicians, relayed scheduling decisions from DIRECTV to technicians using\n\nDIRECTV’s centralized work-assignment system, and otherwise supervised\n\ntechnicians under its purview. DirectSat also maintained a “contractor file” for\n\neach of its technicians, which Plaintiffs describe as “analogous to a personnel file”\n\nand which were “regulated and audited by DIRECTV.” J.A. 94–95. And, in\n\naccordance with its agreement with DIRECTV, DirectSat required technicians to\n\nobtain DIRECTV equipment and attend DIRECTV-mandated trainings at\n\nDirectSat facilities.\n\n      Each Plaintiff alleges that, between 2007 and 2014, he worked as a\n\ntechnician for DIRECTV, an intermediary provider, a subcontractor, or some\n\ncombination of those entities. Plaintiffs Lewis and Wood allege that they were\n\nemployed by DirectSat, while the five remaining Plaintiffs allege that they worked\n\n      2\n        Plaintiffs allege that DIRECTV “regularly infuses these [providers] with\nwhat it labels internally as ‘extraordinary advance payments’” and frequently\nacquires providers when “litigation or other circumstances” present a potential\nbusiness risk for DIRECTV. J.A. 97.\n                                         6\n\ffor other providers not named as defendants in this action. During their respective\n\nperiods of employment, Plaintiffs were each generally classified by their employer\n\nor employers as an independent contractor. 3     In all instances, each Plaintiff’s\n\nprincipal job duty was to install and repair DIRECTV equipment.\n\n      Regardless of the identity of Plaintiffs’ nominal employers, DIRECTV\n\nprimarily directed and controlled Plaintiffs’ work. In particular, Plaintiffs allege\n\nthat DIRECTV was the “primary, if not the only” client of each of the providers\n\nwho served as Plaintiffs’ direct employers and was the “source of substantially all\n\nof each [p]rovider’s income.” J.A. 93–94. At the same time, DIRECTV dictated\n\nnearly every aspect of Plaintiffs’ work through its agreements with the various\n\nproviders that directly employed technicians.     Among other provisions, these\n\nagreements required that all technicians—and therefore Plaintiffs—pass pre-\n\nscreening checks and background checks, review training materials published by\n\nDIRECTV, and become certified by the Satellite Broadcasting & Communications\n\nAssociation. The agreements likewise required technicians to purchase and wear\n\nDIRECTV shirts, carry DIRECTV identification cards, and display the DIRECTV\n\nlogo on their vehicles.     Those who did not satisfy DIRECTV’s eligibility\n\nrequirements could not carry out a technician’s primary task: installing and\n\nrepairing DIRECTV satellite equipment.\n\n      3\n       Plaintiff Hall was initially classified as a direct employee of a provider in\nAugust 2009, but was reclassified as an independent contractor in November 2011.\n                                         7\n\f      In addition to these eligibility requirements, DIRECTV, through its provider\n\nagreements, required technicians to receive their work assignments through a\n\ncentralized system operated by DIRECTV.          DIRECTV also mandated that\n\ntechnicians check in with DIRECTV before and after completing each assigned\n\njob, conduct installations and repairs strictly according to DIRECTV’s\n\nstandardized policies and procedures, and interact with DIRECTV employees to\n\nactivate satellite television service during each installation.     The provider\n\nagreements also authorized DIRECTV employees to exercise quality control\n\noversight over technicians, categorizing technicians’ work as either compensable\n\nor noncompensable and imposing various compensation-related penalties for\n\nunsatisfactory service. Finally, the provider agreements allowed DIRECTV to\n\neffectively terminate technicians by ceasing to assign them work orders through\n\nthe company’s centralized work-assignment system.\n\n                                        B.\n\n      Claiming that they each regularly worked in excess of forty hours per week\n\nwithout receiving overtime pay while serving as DIRECTV technicians, Plaintiffs\n\ninitiated this action in November 2013.4      Specifically, Plaintiffs alleged that\n\n\n      4\n         Plaintiffs pursued their overtime and minimum wage claims, either\ncollectively or individually, in various federal jurisdictions before their claims\nwere ultimately transferred to and consolidated in the United States District Court\nfor the District of Maryland.

In each instance in which\n                                        8\n\fDefendants qualified as their joint employers during the relevant period, such that\n\nDefendants’ failure to provide overtime pay for these additional hours violated the\n\nFLSA’s overtime and minimum wage requirements. In addition to their claims\n\nunder the FLSA, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated three Maryland wage\n\nand hour statutes: (1) the Maryland Wage and Hour Law, Md. Code Ann., Lab. &\n\nEmpl. §§ 3-401 et seq.; (2) the Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Law, Md.\n\nCode Ann., Lab. & Empl. §§ 3-501 et seq.; and (3) the Maryland Workplace Fraud\n\nAct, Md. Code Ann., Lab. & Empl. §§ 3-901 et seq.\n\n      Defendants each moved to dismiss Plaintiffs’ Complaint pursuant to Federal\n\nRule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). On June 30, 2015, the district court granted\n\nDefendants’ motions and dismissed Plaintiffs’ claims in their entirety. See Hall v.\n\nDIRECTV, Nos.

Md.\n\nJune 30, 2015).\n\n      In so doing, the district court devised and applied a two-step inquiry to\n\ndetermine whether Plaintiffs alleged a plausible FLSA joint employment claim.\n\nThe court reasoned that the “first question that must be resolved is whether an\n\nindividual worker is ‘an employee’” of each putative joint employer within the\n\nmeaning of the statute.

Schultz, 466 F.3d at 304–\n\n05. These factors include: “(1) the degree of control that the putative employer has\n\nover the manner in which the work is performed; (2) the worker’s opportunities for\n\nprofit or loss dependent on his managerial skill; (3) the worker’s investment in\n\nequipment or material, or his employment of other workers; (4) the degree of skill\n\nrequired for the work; (5) the permanence of the working relationship; and (6) the\n\ndegree to which the services rendered are an integral part of the putative\n\nemployer’s business.” Id. (citing authorities).\n\n      Apparently assuming that Plaintiffs were not purely independent contractors\n\noutside of the FLSA’s scope, the district court went on to consider whether\n\nDIRECTV was Plaintiffs’ “joint employer” for purposes of the FLSA.

In doing so, the district court employed a four-factor test\n\noriginally set forth by the Ninth Circuit in Bonnette v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">407</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 413 (D.\n\nMd. 2013). Under this test, the district court considered whether DIRECTV:\n\n(1) had the power to hire and fire the employee; (2) supervised and controlled\n\nemployee work schedules or conditions of employment; (3) determined the rate\n\nand method of payment; and (4) maintained employment records.

Bonnette, 704 F.2d at 1470; see also Skrzecz v.\n\nGibson Island Corp., No. CIV.A. RDB-13-1796, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3400614</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7 (D. Md.\n\nJuly 11, 2014). Nonetheless, while acknowledging that Plaintiffs “alleged facts\n\nsufficient to show that DIRECTV at least indirectly supervised [Plaintiffs’] work\n\nand directly controlled their schedules,” the district court dismissed this\n\narrangement as “not surprising” in light of DIRECTV’s interest in maintaining its\n\ngoodwill with consumers. Hall, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4064692</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2. Instead, the district\n\ncourt observed that the “ultimate test of employment is the hiring and firing of\n\nemployees and the setting of their compensation amounts.” Id. Reasoning that\n\nPlaintiffs failed to allege that DIRECTV directly hired or fired technicians working\n\nfor its providers or otherwise controlled those technicians’ compensation, the\n\n\n                                         11\n\fdistrict court concluded that the Complaint did not allege facts sufficient to\n\nestablish that DIRECTV jointly employed Plaintiffs. Id.\n\n      Seeking to bolster this conclusion, the district court identified as relevant\n\nother considerations untethered to both the standard articulated in Bonnette and the\n\nsimilar standard applied by the district court itself. Specifically, the court posited\n\nthat “if the entities that were part of the [DIRECTV] Provider System were\n\nundercapitalized and merely charades created by DIRECTV that followed every\n\nsuggestion and payment decision made by DIRECTV, that would show, perhaps\n\nconclusively, DIRECTV’s joint employer status.”                Id. (emphasis added).\n\nHowever, because “nothing . . . implie[d] that the companies in the DIRECTV\n\nProvider Network were undercapitalized or slavishly followed every suggestion\n\nmade by DIRECTV in regard to the status and method of payment of the\n\ntechnicians with whom they had a relationship[,]” the district court concluded that\n\nPlaintiffs failed to state a claim. Id. Instead, the district court found that Plaintiffs’\n\nallegations “show[ed] only that DIRECTV adopted a reasonable business model\n\nthat allowed for the decentralization of decision-making authority regarding the\n\nemployment of technicians who install its equipment.” Id. According to the\n\ndistrict court, such a “reasonable business model” did not support a finding of joint\n\nemployment for purposes of the FLSA. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                           12\n\f      Having found that Plaintiffs failed to state an actionable FLSA claim against\n\nDIRECTV, the district court summarily concluded that Plaintiffs’ claims under the\n\nMaryland wage and hour statutes also failed. Id. at *3. Specifically, the district\n\ncourt observed that the definitions of “employer” embraced by the Maryland wage\n\nand hour statutes were either coextensive with or narrower than that set forth under\n\nthe FLSA. Id. As such, just as DIRECTV did not qualify as Plaintiffs’ joint\n\nemployer under the FLSA, the district court reasoned that the company could not\n\nbe held liable as a joint employer in connection with Plaintiffs’ state law claims.\n\nId. This timely appeal followed.\n\n                                           II.\n\n      We review de novo the district court’s dismissal of a complaint under\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). E.I. du Pont de Nemours, 637 F.3d at\n\n440. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires only “a short and plain\n\nstatement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” FED.

The plausibility standard is not a probability requirement,\n\nbut “asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.”\n\nIqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v.

Although it is true that “the complaint must contain sufficient facts to\n\nstate a claim that is plausible on its face, it nevertheless need only give the\n\ndefendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds on which it rests.”\n\nWright, 787 F.3d at 263 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Thus, we\n\nhave emphasized that “a complaint is to be construed liberally so as to do\n\nsubstantial justice.” Id.\n\n      Under this standard, we reverse the district court’s dismissal of Plaintiffs’\n\nclaims for two reasons. First, the district court applied an improper legal test for\n\ndetermining whether entities constitute joint employers for purposes of the FLSA.\n\nSecond, the district court misapplied the plausibility standard set forth in Twombly\n\nand Iqbal by subjecting Plaintiffs to evidentiary burdens inapplicable at the\n\npleading stage and by failing to credit key factual allegations regarding\n\nDefendants’ control and oversight of Plaintiffs’ work as DIRECTV technicians.\n\nAs explained below, when considered under the appropriate joint employment test\n\n\n                                        14\n\fand the proper standard for Rule 12(b)(6) motions, Plaintiffs’ factual allegations\n\nplausibly demonstrate that DIRECTV and DirectSat jointly employed Plaintiffs\n\nduring the relevant period.\n\n                                       III.\n\n      The Department of Labor regulation implementing the FLSA distinguishes\n\n“separate and distinct employment” from “joint employment.”            29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 791.2(a). “Separate employment” exists when “all the relevant facts establish\n\nthat two or more employers are acting entirely independently of each other and are\n\ncompletely disassociated with respect to the” individual’s employment. Id. By\n\ncontrast, “joint employment” exists when “employment by one employer is not\n\ncompletely disassociated from employment by the other employer(s).” Id. When\n\ntwo or more entities are found to jointly employ a particular worker, “all of the\n\nemployee’s work for all of the joint employers during the workweek is considered\n\nas one employment for purposes of the [FLSA].” Id. (emphasis added). Thus, for\n\nexample, all hours worked by the employee on behalf of each joint employer are\n\ncounted together to determine whether the employee is entitled to overtime pay\n\nunder the FLSA. Id.\n\n      Notwithstanding the regulation’s seemingly straightforward language, courts\n\nhave long struggled to articulate a coherent test for distinguishing separate\n\nemployment from joint employment.         As we have explained, much of this\n\n\n                                       15\n\fconfusion stems from the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Bonnette v.

Salinas v. Commercial\n\nInteriors, Inc., No. 15-1915, slip op. at 17–18 (argued Oct. 27, 2016). Bonnette\n\ndrew on common-law agency principles, as well as the test used to address the\n\ndistinct question of whether a particular worker is an employee or independent\n\ncontractor, to adopt a multifactor test purporting to differentiate separate\n\nemployment from joint employment by focusing on a putative joint employer’s\n\nright to control an FLSA plaintiff’s work. 704 F.2d at 1470. The court identified\n\nfour nonexclusive factors to guide this inquiry: “whether the alleged employer (1)\n\nhad the power to hire and fire the employees, (2) supervised and controlled\n\nemployee work schedules or conditions of employment, (3) determined the rate\n\nand method of payment, and (4) maintained employment records.” Id.\n\n      Following Bonnette, a number of courts, including district courts within this\n\nCircuit, have applied this four-factor test to determine whether two or more entities\n\nconstitute joint employers under the FLSA. Salinas, No. 15-1915, slip op. at 18–\n\n19 (collecting cases). At the same time, however, several circuits (including the\n\nNinth Circuit, itself) have liberalized the Bonnette test to reflect Congress’s\n\noriginal intent for the FLSA to extend protections beyond common-law\n\nemployment relationships. Id. at 19–20. As a result, at the time the district court\n\nconsidered Defendants’ motions to dismiss in this case, courts in various\n\n\n                                         16\n\fjurisdictions within this Circuit and throughout the country applied numerous,\n\ndistinct, multifactor joint employment tests. 5 Id.\n\n      Perhaps reflecting this uncertain state of the law, the district court’s review\n\nof Plaintiffs’ joint employment allegations in this case is somewhat disjointed. As\n\ndiscussed above, supra Part I.B., the district court began its analysis by proposing\n\nan analytical framework under which it would first decide whether Plaintiffs fell\n\nwithin the FLSA’s definition of “employee.” Hall, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4064692</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2.\n\nApparently assuming, without analysis, that Plaintiffs were employees within the\n\nFLSA’s scope, the court went on to consider whether Defendants qualified as\n\nPlaintiffs’ joint employers under the statute. Id. Applying the four-factor Bonnette\n\ntest, the district court concluded that Plaintiffs failed to plausibly allege that\n\nDefendants were their joint employers during the relevant period. Id.\n\n      The district court’s analysis of Plaintiffs’ joint employment claims suffers\n\nfrom two basic flaws. First, the district court errantly concluded that a worker\n\nmust be an employee—as opposed to an independent contractor—as to each\n\nputative joint employer when considered separately for the entities to constitute\n\njoint employers under the FLSA. As a result of this misinterpretation, the district\n\ncourt incorrectly treated a worker’s status as an employee or independent\n\n      5\n        Notably, in another FLSA action, the trial judge in this case applied a five-\nfactor joint employment test that differed from the Bonnette-based test that he\napplied in this case, notwithstanding that the two cases were decided only a few\nmonths apart. See Salinas, No. 15-1915, slip op. at 9–10.\n                                          17\n\fcontractor as to each putative joint employer as a threshold inquiry to be decided\n\nprior to determining whether the two entities are completely disassociated.\n\nSecond, the district court improperly relied on Bonnette to determine whether\n\nDefendants jointly employed Plaintiffs, leading the court to ignore important,\n\nrelevant aspects of Plaintiffs’ employment arrangement during their respective\n\ntenures as DIRECTV technicians.6 We discuss each of these errors in turn.\n\n                                           A.\n\n         First, the district court’s treatment of whether Plaintiffs were employees—as\n\nopposed to independent contractors—of DIRECTV and DirectSat as a threshold\n\nquestion inverted the two-step inquiry we have adopted in FLSA joint employment\n\ncases.\n\n         We addressed the proper order of analysis in FLSA joint employment\n\nactions in Schultz. There, we established a two-step framework for determining\n\nwhether a defendant may be held liable for an alleged FLSA violation under a joint\n\nemployment theory. 466 F.3d at 305–09. Under this framework, we first must\n\ndetermine whether the defendant and one or more additional entities shared, agreed\n\n\n         6\n         As previously described, despite its recitation of the Bonnette factors, the\ndistrict court’s analysis turned largely on its misapprehension of Plaintiffs’\nallegations regarding the degree to which Defendants maintained the authority to\nhire and fire or otherwise set the rate of compensation for DIRECTV technicians\nlike Plaintiffs. In this sense, even assuming that the Bonnette-like test applied by\nthe district court was the appropriate joint employment test, the district court’s\ndismissal of Plaintiffs’ overtime claims was in error.\n                                           18\n\fto allocate responsibility for, or otherwise codetermined the key terms and\n\nconditions of the plaintiff’s work. Id.; Salinas, No. 15-1915, slip op. at 29–31.\n\nThe second step of the analysis—which asks whether a worker was an employee or\n\nindependent contractor for purposes of the FLSA—depends in large part upon the\n\nanswer to the first step. Namely, if we determine that the defendant and another\n\nentity codetermined the key terms and conditions of the worker’s employment,\n\nthen we must consider whether the two entities’ combined influence over the terms\n\nand conditions of the worker’s employment render the worker an employee as\n\nopposed to an independent contractor.        By contrast, if the two entities are\n\ndisassociated with regard to the key terms and conditions of the worker’s\n\nemployment, we must consider whether the worker is an employee or independent\n\ncontractor with regard to each putative employer separately.\n\n      In adopting this framework, we explained that the joint employment doctrine\n\nis premised on the theory that, when two or more entities jointly employ a worker,\n\nthe worker’s entire “employment arrangement must be viewed as ‘one\n\nemployment’ for purposes of determining whether the [worker was an] employee[]\n\nor independent contractor[] under the FLSA.” Schultz, 466 F.3d at 307 (quoting 29\n\nC.F.R. § 791.2(a)). In other words, if a worker performs work for two or more\n\nentities that are “not completely disassociated” with respect to that worker’s\n\nemployment, 29 C.F.R. § 791.2(a), courts must aggregate the levers of influence\n\n\n                                        19\n\fover the key terms and conditions of the worker’s employment exercised by all of\n\nthe entities when determining whether the worker is an “employee” within the\n\nmeaning of the FLSA.        Accordingly, the district court in this case erred by\n\nconsidering whether Plaintiffs qualified as employees “without first determining\n\nwhether a joint employment relationship existed” between DIRECTV, DirectSat,\n\nand Plaintiffs’ other putative joint employers. 7 Schultz, 466 F.3d at 309.\n\n      Focusing first on the relationship between putative joint employers is\n\nessential to accomplishing the FLSA’s “remedial and humanitarian” purpose.\n\nPurdham v.

Indeed, a worker who performs services for\n\ntwo or more entities that are “not completely disassociated” with respect to his\n\nwork may not amount to an “employee” protected by the FLSA when his\n\nrelationship to each entity is considered separately, but may come within the\n\nstatutory definition of an “employee” when his relationships to all of the relevant\n\nentities are considered in the aggregate. By ignoring the relationships between and\n\namong these entities vis-à-vis the worker, the framework deployed by the district\n\n      7\n         Schultz acknowledged that in a small subset of cases this sequence of\nanalyses may be unnecessary, 466 F.3d at 306 n.1, such as when the levers of\ninfluence over the essential terms and conditions of an individual’s work exercised\nby putative joint employers would not give rise to an employer-employee\nrelationship, regardless of whether the putative joint employers’ levers of influence\nare considered in the aggregate.\n                                         20\n\fcourt erroneously failed to take account of a worker’s entire employment when\n\nconsidering whether he or she is covered by the FLSA. This approach departs\n\nfrom the framework we set forth in Schultz and risks creating significant gaps in\n\nthe broad, protective coverage Congress sought to ensure in adopting the FLSA.\n\n      Although our two-step test will, consistent with congressional intent, extend\n\nFLSA protection to individuals who are independent contractors when their work\n\nfor each entity is considered separately but employees when their work is\n\nconsidered in the aggregate, it will not automatically render every independent\n\ncontractor who performs services for two or more entities an “employee” within\n\nthe FLSA’s scope. Rather, under this two-step inquiry, individuals who bear true\n\nhallmarks of independent contractor status will remain outside of the FLSA’s\n\nscope even if they perform work for two or more entities that are “not completely\n\ndisassociated” with respect to those individuals’ work. For instance, two\n\nbusinesses agreeing to share the services of a single handyman may not be\n\n“completely disassociated” when they arrange for the handyman to perform\n\nservices on their premises at mutually acceptable times. But, if the handyman\n\nowns his own tools and provides his own materials, can choose to stop working for\n\neither or both businesses of his own accord, and is not an integral part of either\n\nbusiness’s principal purpose, he may nonetheless remain an independent contractor\n\nfor purposes of the FLSA. Accordingly, the businesses, despite their incomplete\n\n\n                                        21\n\fdisassociation, would have no obligations under the FLSA with respect to the\n\nhandyman. 8\n\n      Through properly segregating and organizing these two distinct questions,\n\nthe analytical framework we embraced in Schultz “leads to a proper determination\n\nof whether, as a matter of economic reality, the [plaintiffs] were dependent on the\n\njoint employers or whether they were in business for themselves.” 466 F.3d at\n\n307. By contrast, by inverting that framework, the district court in this case failed\n\nto consider whether Defendants’ shared influence over Plaintiffs’ day-to-day work\n\nrendered Plaintiffs economically dependent on DIRECTV and DirectSat during\n\ntheir respective periods of employment, such that Plaintiffs constituted\n\n“employees” under the FLSA.\n\n                                         B.\n\n                                         1.\n\n      Although the district court’s inversion of the two-step Schultz framework\n\nalone would warrant reversal, the district court compounded its error by relying on\n\nBonnette to consider the sufficiency of Plaintiffs’ joint employment allegations.\n\n\n\n      8\n        By the same token, a business that is deemed a joint employer under the\nFLSA as to some of its workers will not automatically be required to comply with\nthe FLSA with respect to all of its workers. Some workers may be independent\ncontractors ineligible for FLSA protection even though they perform services for\nthe defendant and at least one other entity that is “not completely disassociated”\nwith respect to the plaintiff’s work.\n                                         22\n\f      We recently joined many of our sister circuits in concluding that the\n\nBonnette Court’s reliance on common-law agency principles ignores Congress’s\n\nintent to ensure that the FLSA protects workers whose employment arrangements\n\ndo not conform to the bounds of common-law agency relationships. Salinas, No.\n\n15-1915, slip op. at 21. In instructing district courts not to follow Bonnette, we\n\nemphasized two additional concerns with existing joint employment tests. Id.\n\nSpecifically, we explained that these tests: “(1) improperly focus on the\n\nrelationship between the employee and putative joint employer, rather than on the\n\nrelationship between the putative joint employers, and (2) incorrectly frame the\n\njoint employment inquiry as solely a question of an employee’s ‘economic\n\ndependence’ on a putative joint employer.” Id.\n\n      With this in mind, instead of adopting a previously existing test, we\n\narticulated a new standard that draws on the history and purpose of the FLSA, as\n\nwell as the Department of Labor regulation that implements the statute and\n\nrecognizes the existence of joint employment arrangements. Id. at 30–32. Under\n\nour framework, the “fundamental question” guiding the joint employment analysis\n\nis “whether two or more persons or entities are ‘not completely disassociated’ with\n\nrespect to a worker such that the persons or entities share, agree to allocate\n\nresponsibility for, or otherwise codetermine—formally or informally, directly or\n\n\n\n\n                                        23\n\findirectly—the essential terms and conditions of the worker’s employment.” Id. at\n\n31.\n\n      To assist lower courts in determining whether the relationship between two\n\nentities gives rise to joint employment, we identified the following six,\n\nnonexhaustive factors to consider:\n\n      (1)   Whether, formally or as a matter of practice, the putative joint\n            employers jointly determine, share, or allocate the ability to\n            direct, control, or supervise the worker, whether by direct or\n            indirect means;\n\n      (2)   Whether, formally or as a matter of practice, the putative joint\n            employers jointly determine, share, or allocate the power to—\n            directly or indirectly—hire or fire the worker or modify the\n            terms or conditions of the worker’s employment;\n\n      (3)   The degree of permanency and duration of the relationship\n            between the putative joint employers;\n\n      (4)   Whether through shared management or a direct or indirect\n            ownership interest, one putative joint employer controls, is\n            controlled by, or is under common control with the other\n            putative joint employer;\n\n      (5)   Whether the work is performed on a premises owned or\n            controlled by one or more of the putative joint employers,\n            independently or in connection with one another; and\n\n      (6)   Whether, formally or as a matter of practice, the putative joint\n            employers jointly determine, share, or allocate responsibility\n            over functions ordinarily carried out by an employer, such as\n            handling payroll; providing workers’ compensation insurance;\n            paying payroll taxes; or providing the facilities, equipment,\n            tools, or materials necessary to complete the work.\n\n\n\n                                       24\n\fId. at 31–32. Further, because the status of a particular employment relationship is\n\nhighly fact-dependent, we emphasized that the absence of a single factor—or even\n\na majority of factors—is not determinative of whether joint employment does or\n\ndoes not exist. Id. at 32–33.\n\n      Much like its misapplication of the two-step framework set forth in Schultz,\n\nthe district court’s reliance on the Bonnette factors in this case rendered the court’s\n\nconsideration of Plaintiffs’ joint employment allegations fundamentally flawed and\n\nunduly restrictive.9 In particular, the district court’s control-based analysis omitted\n\nconsideration of the relationship between the putative joint employers and thus\n\nignored important elements of coordination between Defendants, as well as many\n\nof Defendants’ shared levers of influence over Plaintiffs’ work as DIRECTV\n\ntechnicians. Because the district court applied an improper test in determining\n\nwhether Plaintiffs were “separate[ly]” or “joint[ly]” employed, the court erred in\n\ngranting Defendants’ motions to dismiss.\n\n                                          2.\n\n      Beyond this initial error, we also reject the district court’s assertion that an\n\nFLSA defendant, like DIRECTV, that does not directly employ a plaintiff is\n\nsubject to joint employment liability only if the plaintiff’s direct employer\n\n      9\n         Given the confused state of FLSA joint employment case law—and that\nthis Court had not yet identified factors for courts to consider in distinguishing\nseparate employment from joint employment at the time the district court rendered\nits decision—this error is more than understandable.\n                                          25\n\f“slavishly followed every suggestion made by [the defendant] in regard to the\n\nstatus and method of payment of the [plaintiff].” Hall, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4064692</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2\n\n(emphasis added). As we explained previously, to determine whether “separate” or\n\n“joint” employment exists, courts must focus on whether putative joint employers\n\n“share, agree to allocate responsibility for, or otherwise codetermine” the essential\n\nterms and conditions of a worker’s employment. Salinas, No. 15-1915, slip op. at\n\n4 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the FLSA does not require that an entity have\n\nunchecked—or even primary—authority over all—or even most—aspects of a\n\nworker’s employment for the entity to qualify as a joint employer. Rather, the\n\nentity must only play a role in establishing the key terms and conditions of the\n\nworker’s employment.\n\n      For this reason, we further reject the district court’s conclusion that for\n\njoint—as opposed to separate—employment to exist, a majority of factors must\n\nweigh in favor of joint employment. Hall, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4064692</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (finding no\n\njoint employment under the four-factor Bonnette test, notwithstanding that\n\nPlaintiffs “alleged facts sufficient to show that DIRECTV at least indirectly\n\nsupervised their work and directly controlled their schedules,” because the\n\nremaining three factors weighed in favor of separate employment).                The\n\nDepartment of Labor’s regulation implementing the joint employment doctrine\n\nrequires that the “determination of whether the employment by the employers is to\n\n\n                                         26\n\fbe considered joint employment or separate and distinct employment for purposes\n\nof the [FLSA] depends upon all the facts in the particular case.” 29 C.F.R. §\n\n791.2(a) (emphasis added).

Rather, “one factor alone”—\n\nsuch as DIRECTV’s supervision and control of Plaintiffs’ schedules—can give rise\n\nto a reasonable inference that plaintiffs will be able to develop evidence\n\nestablishing “that two or more persons or entities are ‘not completely\n\ndisassociated’ with respect to a worker’s employment if the [allegations]\n\nsupporting that factor demonstrate that the person or entity has a substantial role in\n\ndetermining the terms and conditions of a worker’s employment.” Salinas, No. 15-\n\n1915, slip op. at 32–33.\n\n      This is particularly true at the pleading stage, when plaintiffs have had no\n\n“opportunity for discovery as to payroll and taxation documents, disciplinary\n\nrecords, internal corporate communications, or leadership and ownership\n\nstructures.” Thompson v.

Accordingly, to\n\ndetermine whether reversal is warranted in this case, we must consider whether,\n\napplying the appropriate legal standards, Plaintiffs’ allegations are sufficient to\n\nstate a plausible FLSA joint employment claim against Defendants.\n\n                                         1.\n\n      As previously explained, to determine whether Plaintiffs have alleged a\n\nplausible FLSA joint employment claim, we must first consider whether—taking\n\nPlaintiffs’ allegations, and all reasonable inferences therefrom, as true—\n\nDefendants were “entirely independent” with respect to Plaintiffs’ work as\n\nDIRECTV technicians, 29 C.F.R. § 791.2(a), or, instead, codetermined the\n\nessential terms and conditions of that work, Salinas, No. 15-1915, slip op. at 30.\n\nAnalyzing this fundamental question using the six factors set forth above to guide\n\nour inquiry, we conclude that Plaintiffs’ factual allegations establish that\n\n\n\n\n                                        29\n\fDIRECTV, DirectSat, and other members of the DIRECTV Provider Network\n\njointly determined the key terms and conditions of Plaintiffs’ employment.\n\n      To begin with, Plaintiffs allege that DIRECTV, DirectSat, and the other\n\nHome and Secondary Service Providers instituted and operated a fissured\n\nemployment scheme, governed by a web of provider agreements, that endured\n\nthroughout Plaintiffs’ periods of employment as DIRECTV technicians and was\n\nessential to the installation and repair of DIRECTV’s own products. DIRECTV\n\nwas the principal—and, in many cases, only—client of the lower-level\n\nsubcontractors, and DIRECTV often infused capital into or formally “absorb[ed]”\n\nthe subcontractors when necessary. J.A. 97.\n\n      Moreover, according to the Complaint, DIRECTV and DirectSat allocated,\n\nthrough provider agreements with one another and with subcontractors in the\n\nProvider Network, the authority to direct, control, and supervise nearly every\n\naspect of Plaintiffs’ day-to-day job duties. For example, through these contractual\n\narrangements, DIRECTV compelled Plaintiffs to obtain their work schedules and\n\njob assignments through DIRECTV’s centralized system and to follow\n\n“particularized methods and standards of installation to assure DIRECTV’s\n\nequipment is installed according to the dictates of DIRECTV’s policies and\n\nprocedures.” J.A. 96. And DIRECTV’s provider agreements also allowed the\n\ncompany “to control nearly every facet of the technicians’ work,” including by\n\n\n                                        30\n\frequiring Plaintiffs to hold themselves out as representatives of the company, to\n\nwear DIRECTV uniforms, to carry DIRECTV identification cards, and to display\n\nthe company’s logo on their vehicles when performing work for the company. J.A.\n\n96–97.\n\n        Contrary to the district court’s assertion that Plaintiffs failed to allege “facts\n\nthat would show that DIRECTV has the power to hire and fire technicians [or]\n\ndetermine their rate and method of payment,” Hall, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4064692</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2, the\n\nComplaint is replete with allegations that DIRECTV, DirectSat, and other\n\nmembers of the Provider Network shared authority over hiring, firing, and\n\ncompensation. Regarding hiring and firing, the Complaint alleges that “DIRECTV\n\nset forth the qualification ‘hiring’ criteria” for technicians, including Plaintiffs,\n\nwhile DirectSat and other Home and Secondary Service Providers “implemented\n\nand enforced those qualifications.”        J.A. 94.    And although Plaintiffs’ direct\n\nemployers had formal firing authority, DIRECTV used its centralized work-\n\nassignment system to effectively terminate technicians by ceasing to assign them\n\nwork.\n\n        DIRECTV and members of its Provider Network also shared authority over\n\ntechnicians’ compensation.       Whereas DirectSat or other subcontractors issued\n\nPlaintiffs’ paychecks, DIRECTV played an integral role in setting Plaintiffs’\n\ncompensation.      For instance, the Complaint alleges that DIRECTV retained\n\n\n                                            31\n\fauthority in its provider agreements to determine whether work performed by\n\nDIRECTV       technicians,   including    Plaintiffs,   was    “compensable”     or\n\n“noncompensable.” J.A. 100. Plaintiffs characterize this compensation scheme as\n\na “piece-rate” system, through which Plaintiffs were paid a particular rate based on\n\nthe specific tasks they performed. Id. A piece-rate system is permissible under the\n\nFLSA only where the parties agree that all of an employee’s hours, including\n\nnonproductive hours, are compensated and included in the employee’s total\n\nworking time and where the employer continues to comply with the statute’s\n\novertime provisions. See 29 C.F.R. § 778.318.\n\n      In addition to compensable work, Plaintiffs also regularly performed\n\nadditional tasks that, although essential to the installation and operation of\n\nDIRECTV products, went uncompensated by either DIRECTV or its providers.\n\nThis work included “assembling satellite dishes, driving to and between job\n\nassignments, reviewing and receiving schedules, calling customers to confirm\n\ninstallations, obtaining required supplies, assisting other technicians with\n\ninstallations, performing required customer educations, contacting DIRECTV to\n\nreport in or activate service, working on installations that were not completed, and\n\n. . . perform[ing] additional work on installations previously completed.” J.A. 103.\n\nDIRECTV also retained authority over compensation by imposing “chargebacks\n\nand/or rollbacks” on a technician’s pay when DIRECTV determined, in its sole\n\n\n                                         32\n\fauthority, that the technician provided unsatisfactory service. Id. at 101. By\n\nmaintaining authority to determine what work would be deemed compensable and\n\nto impose chargebacks, DIRECTV retained significant authority over the manner\n\nand method by which Plaintiffs and other technicians were paid for their work.\n\n      Regarding DirectSat, Plaintiffs Lewis and Wood assert that the company—\n\nin its role as a middle-manager in the DIRECTV Provider Network—implemented\n\nDIRECTV’s hiring and training criteria, relayed scheduling decisions to\n\nDIRECTV technicians, and required technicians to obtain DIRECTV equipment\n\nand attend DIRECTV-mandated trainings at its facilities. Moreover, Lewis and\n\nWood allege that DirectSat maintained employment records for all technicians who\n\nperformed work for the company, which records DIRECTV reviewed and audited.\n\n      Of course, later discovery may demonstrate that DIRECTV and DirectSat\n\ndid not “share, agree to allocate responsibility for, or otherwise codetermine . . . the\n\nessential terms and conditions of” Plaintiffs’ employment, Salinas, No. 15-1915,\n\nslip op. at 31, or that neither Lewis nor Wood was employed, either directly or\n\nindirectly, by DirectSat.    At this stage of the litigation, however, Plaintiffs’\n\nallegations are sufficient to make out a plausible claim that DirectSat was “not\n\ncompletely disassociated” from DIRECTV and other service providers with regard\n\nto setting the essential conditions under which Plaintiffs Lewis and Wood worked\n\nin their capacities as DIRECTV technicians.\n\n\n                                          33\n\f                                        2.\n\n      Having established that Plaintiffs’ allegations sufficiently demonstrate that\n\nDIRECTV and DirectSat were not completely disassociated with respect to\n\nPlaintiffs’ work as DIRECTV technicians, we now turn to the second step of the\n\njoint employment inquiry. In particular, we must consider whether, from the\n\nperspective of Plaintiffs’ “one employment” with DIRECTV and DirectSat (or\n\nother applicable entities within DIRECTV’s tiered structure), Plaintiffs have\n\nsufficiently alleged that they were employees, as opposed to independent\n\ncontractors, for purposes of the FLSA. Schultz, 466 F.3d at 307. Under the one-\n\nemployment theory described above, we consider the entire context of Plaintiffs’\n\nwork on behalf of DIRECTV and DirectSat and aggregate those aspects of that\n\nwork that Defendants, either jointly or individually, influenced, controlled, or\n\ndetermined. Id.\n\n      To determine whether Plaintiffs are properly classified as employees or\n\nindependent contractors under the FLSA, we focus on the “‘economic realities’ of\n\nthe relationship” between the defendants and the plaintiffs. Id. at 304 (quoting\n\nHenderson v. Inter–Chem Coal Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"683232\"><a href=\"/opinion/683232/ronald-e-henderson-v-inter-chem-coal-co-inc-nationwide-mining-inc-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">567</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 570 (10th Cir. 1994)). In\n\nparticular, we consider whether, in performing their work as DIRECTV\n\ntechnicians, Plaintiffs were “economically dependent” on Defendants or, instead,\n\nwere “in business for [themselves].” Id. at 304. To make this determination, we\n\n\n                                        34\n\flook to the six factors identified by the Supreme Court in United States v. Silk, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104447\"><a href=\"/opinion/104447/united-states-v-silk/\"><span class=\"volume\">331</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">704</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1947). These factors include: “(1) the degree of control that the putative\n\nemployer[s] ha[ve] over the manner in which the work is performed; (2) the\n\nworker’s opportunities for profit or loss dependent on his managerial skill; (3) the\n\nworker’s investment in equipment or material, or his employment of other\n\nworkers; (4) the degree of skill required for the work; (5) the permanence of the\n\nworking relationship; and (6) the degree to which the services rendered are an\n\nintegral part of the putative employer[s’] business.” Id. at 304–05.\n\n      With these factors in mind, we conclude that Plaintiffs’ allegations\n\ndemonstrate that Plaintiffs were effectively economically dependent on Defendants\n\nwhile serving as DIRECTV technicians. As alleged by Plaintiffs, Defendants\n\ncollectively influenced nearly every aspect of Plaintiffs’ work as DIRECTV\n\ntechnicians.   In particular, through its agreements with lower-level providers,\n\nDIRECTV largely determined who would be hired as a DIRECTV technician and\n\nexclusively determined the manner in which technicians would be compensated for\n\ntheir time. Although technicians, like Plaintiffs, largely supplied their own tools,\n\nDIRECTV provided the materials to be installed for DIRECTV customers and\n\ndetermined whether Plaintiffs’ pay for performing particular services would be\n\ndeducted for any reason previously established by DIRECTV.                Therefore,\n\n\n\n\n                                         35\n\fPlaintiffs could not increase their take-home pay through their own ingenuity or\n\nskill.\n\n         Through its required training materials and centralized work-assignment\n\nsystem, DIRECTV also dictated the manner in which technicians performed their\n\nwork and controlled whether and when Plaintiffs could install and repair\n\nDIRECTV products. DIRECTV so extensively controlled Plaintiffs’ day-to-day—\n\nindeed, hour-to-hour—work that the company not only required technicians to use\n\nequipment belonging to DIRECTV, but in fact expected technicians to hold\n\nthemselves out as the company’s representatives to customers by wearing\n\nDIRECTV uniforms and nametags and driving vehicles emblazoned with\n\nDIRECTV’s logo.         Finally, Plaintiffs’ work was integral to DIRECTV’s\n\nbusiness—absent Plaintiffs’ work installing and repairing DIRECTV satellite\n\nsystems, DIRECTV would be unable to convey its product to consumers.\n\n         At the same time, although DirectSat apparently maintained relatively\n\nlimited authority over the manner in which technicians working under its purview\n\nperformed their work, Plaintiffs Lewis and Wood allege that the company was\n\nresponsible for implementing and enforcing many of DIRECTV’s mandates for its\n\ntechnicians.    As noted, this arrangement endured throughout these Plaintiffs’\n\nrespective periods of employment as technicians, during which time their\n\ninstallation and repair activities were essential to DIRECTV’s provision of satellite\n\n\n                                         36\n\ftelevision service to its customers. As such, and because we consider Plaintiffs’\n\nemployment for DIRECTV and DirectSat in the aggregate, these allegations amply\n\ndemonstrate that Plaintiffs, like other DIRECTV technicians, were economically\n\ndependent on DIRECTV and its affiliate providers in connection with their work\n\non the company’s behalf. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have stated a plausible claim that\n\nDIRECTV—and, as to Plaintiffs Wood and Lewis, DirectSat—was their joint\n\nemployer under the FLSA and that Plaintiffs were “employees” within the meaning\n\nof the FLSA.\n\n                             *            *             *\n\n      In sum, Plaintiffs adequately allege that DIRECTV, DirectSat, and\n\nsubcontractors in the DIRECTV Provider Network shared responsibility for and\n\ncodetermined the essential terms and conditions of Plaintiffs’ employment as\n\ntechnicians. Plaintiffs’ allegations further establish that—when viewed from the\n\nperspective of Plaintiffs’ “one employment” with DIRECTV, DirectSat, and other\n\nsubcontractors in the Provider Network—Plaintiffs were economically dependent\n\non—and therefore jointly employed by—DIRECTV and DirectSat. Accordingly,\n\nthe district court erred in dismissing Plaintiffs’ FLSA claims on grounds that\n\nPlaintiffs failed to adequately establish joint employment. 10\n\n\n      10\n        Defendants agree that Plaintiffs’ claims under the Maryland Wage and\nHour Law “stand or fall on the success” of their FLSA claims.

Consequently, our resolution of the FLSA joint employment question\nalso resolves Plaintiffs’ claims under this parallel Maryland statute.\n\n      At the same time, however, Plaintiffs concede that the definitions of\n“employer” included in the Maryland Workplace Fraud Act and the Maryland\nWage Payment and Collection Law are “technically narrower” than the definition\nembraced by the FLSA.

We remand those claims to the district court to\nreconsider whether Plaintiffs have stated a claim under the relevant state-law tests\nand the proper standard for reviewing motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).\n\n       We further note that, in passing upon Plaintiffs’ state law claims, the district\ncourt incorrectly suggested that the Maryland Wage and Hour Law and Workplace\nFraud Act share a common definition of covered “employers,” while the state’s\nWage Payment and Collection Law employs a narrower definition of that term.\nSee Hall, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4064692</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3. In fact, it is the Workplace Fraud Act and\nWage Payment and Collection Law that share a substantially similar definition,\nwhich diverges slightly from the definitions included in the FLSA and the\nanalogous Wage and Hour Law. Compare 29 U.S.C.A. § 203(d) (FLSA, defining\n“employer” to include “any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an\nemployer in relation to an employee . . . ”) and Md. Code Ann., Lab. & Empl. § 3-\n401 (Wage and Hour Law, defining “employer” to include “a person who acts\ndirectly or indirectly in the interest of another employer with an employee”), with\nMd.

Rather, this standard is intended “to require\n\nplaintiffs to provide some factual context that will ‘nudge’ their claim ‘from\n\nconceivable to plausible.’” Dejesus, 726 F.3d at 90 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at\n\n570).

A plaintiff may meet this initial standard “by estimating the length of her\n\naverage workweek during the applicable period and the average rate at which she\n\nwas paid, the amount of overtime wages she believes she is owed, or any other\n\nfacts that will permit the court to find plausibility.” Landers, 771 F.3d at 645\n\n\n                                       41\n\f(emphasis added) (citing Pruell, 678 F.3d at 14); see also Davis, 765 F.3d at 243\n\n(explaining that “a plaintiff’s claim that she ‘typically’ worked forty hours per\n\nweek, worked extra hours during such a forty-hour week, and was not\n\ncompensated for extra hours beyond forty hours he or she worked during one or\n\nmore of those forty-hour weeks, would suffice” (emphasis in original)).\n\n      Applying this standard here, we conclude that Plaintiffs’ allegations provide\n\na sufficient basis to support a reasonable inference that Plaintiffs worked\n\nuncompensated overtime hours while serving as DIRECTV technicians.             The\n\ngravamen of Plaintiffs’ Complaint is that, under DIRECTV’s piece-rate\n\ncompensation system (the terms of which Plaintiffs allege were not properly\n\nmemorialized, as required by the FLSA), Plaintiffs consistently performed\n\nsignificant work for which they received inadequate compensation. As a result,\n\nPlaintiffs assert that, taking into account their total compensation and the number\n\nof hours they worked on behalf of Defendants, their final pay “did not reflect\n\ncompensation for all hours worked and they were not properly compensated for\n\novertime hours.” J.A. 104.\n\n      As compared to a more traditional overtime claim based on an employee’s\n\nstandard hourly wage, Defendants’ alleged piece-rate compensation system\n\npresents certain additional complexity under the FLSA. See 29 U.S.C. § 207(g)\n\n(setting out various methods by which an employer may comply with the statute’s\n\n\n                                        42\n\fovertime provisions under a piece-rate compensation scheme). At this stage of the\n\nlitigation, however, we need not wade into these murky waters. Instead, our\n\nconsideration of the sufficiency of Plaintiffs’ claims must again focus on the\n\ndegree to which Plaintiffs have alleged that they worked more than forty hours in a\n\nworkweek and were not properly compensated for those additional hours.\n\nLanders, 771 F.3d at 645 (applying the Lundy standard to consider overtime\n\nallegations arising out of an employer’s piece-rate compensation system).\n\n      In this case, in addition to their common allegations regarding the nature and\n\nstructure of the DIRECTV Provider Network, Plaintiffs each describe in some\n\ndetail their regular work schedules, rates of pay, and uncompensated work time.\n\nSpecifically, each Plaintiff provides an approximation of his general workweek,\n\nwith each Plaintiff alleging that he typically worked in excess (and, in some cases,\n\nwell in excess) of forty hours per week. Supplementing these initial allegations,\n\neach Plaintiff further estimates the number of hours he worked in any given week,\n\nincluding a breakdown of the number of compensable and noncompensable hours\n\nhe typically worked, as well as his average weekly pay and the amount by which\n\nthis weekly compensation was typically reduced through DIRECTV-imposed\n\npenalties and unreimbursed business expenses.\n\n      This final level of granularity, coupled with Plaintiffs’ common allegations\n\nregarding the types of work DIRECTV designated as compensable and\n\n\n                                        43\n\fnoncompensable, ultimately nudges Plaintiffs’ claims against Defendants from the\n\nmerely conceivable to the plausible. At this initial stage, that is all that is required\n\nto overcome Defendants’ motion to dismiss.            Cf. Landers 771 F.3d at 646\n\n(dismissing FLSA claims where the complaint lacked “any detail regarding a given\n\nworkweek when [the plaintiff] worked in excess of forty hours and was not paid\n\novertime for that given workweek and/or was not paid minimum wages”).\n\nAlthough Plaintiffs may ultimately be unable to substantiate their allegations\n\nthrough discovery, they have sufficiently alleged a plausible claim to unpaid\n\novertime for their work on behalf of Defendants.\n\n      The district court’s summary dismissal of Plaintiffs Wood and Lewis’s\n\nclaims against DirectSat suffers from a similar infirmity. 11 Contrary to the district\n\n\n\n      11\n         In disposing of these claims, which are pursued only by Plaintiffs Wood\nand Lewis, the district court first questioned the sufficiency of these Plaintiffs’\nallegations regarding when they were employed by DirectSat and suggested,\nwithout explanation or citation, that their claims against the company “may be\ntime-barred.” Hall, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4064692</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3. In fact, however, Wood and Lewis\nspecifically allege that they worked as satellite technicians for DIRECTV,\nDirectSat, and other entities until 2011 and 2012, respectively.\n\n      In addition to DIRECTV and DirectSat, each of these Plaintiffs indicates\nthat he worked as a DIRECTV satellite technician for at least one other entity\nduring the relevant period, with Plaintiff Lewis indicating that he was involuntarily\nterminated by an entity called Commercial Wiring Incorporated in December 2012.\nImportantly, plaintiffs alleging joint employment under the FLSA need not\n“determine conclusively which [defendant] was their employer at the pleadings\nstage or describe in detail the employer’s corporate structure.” Ash, 799 F.3d at\n961. Rather, at this preliminary stage, it is enough that both Lewis and Wood\n                                          44\n\fcourt’s submission that these Plaintiffs’ allegations suggest that they were “paid an\n\namount greater than that required by the FLSA,” Hall, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4064692</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3,\n\nboth Lewis and Wood expressly allege that they regularly performed\n\nuncompensated overtime work for Defendants during the course of their\n\nemployment as DIRECTV technicians.\n\n      Though again unsupported by any citation or other reasoning, the district\n\ncourt’s suggestion that Plaintiffs Lewis and Wood fail to state a claim because their\n\nfinal pay was “greater than required under the FLSA” suggests a fundamental\n\nmisapprehension of the statute’s requirements. In addition to setting a federal\n\nminimum wage, the FLSA separately requires employers to pay their workers an\n\novertime premium for hours worked in excess of forty per week. 29 U.S.C. § 207.\n\nFor this reason, even assuming Plaintiffs Lewis and Wood each received an\n\neffective hourly wage above the minimum rate established by the FLSA, their\n\novertime claims against Defendants are sufficiently pleaded to survive the present\n\nmotions to dismiss.\n\n                                         V.\n\n      Under the appropriate legal standards, Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts\n\nto make out a plausible claim that Defendants jointly employed them as DIRECTV\n\ntechnicians. As such, Defendants may be held jointly and severally liable in the\n\nallege that they worked as DIRECTV technicians for DirectSat during the relevant\nperiod to overcome Defendants’ motions to dismiss.\n                                         45\n\fevent that Plaintiffs performed uncompensated overtime work for Defendants\n\nduring Plaintiffs’ respective periods of employment.    Because Plaintiffs have\n\nsufficiently pleaded (1) that DIRECTV—and, as to Plaintiffs Lewis and Wood,\n\nDirectSat—jointly employed them as satellite technicians and (2) that they are\n\nowed some amount of unpaid overtime compensation, we reverse the district\n\ncourt’s dismissal of Plaintiffs’ FLSA and Maryland state-law claims against\n\nDefendants and remand these consolidated cases for further proceedings consistent\n\nwith this opinion.\n\n                                                  REVERSED AND REMANDED\n\n\n\n\n                                       46\n\f</pre>",
