GIBSON, Circuit Judge.     This appeal raises the\n\nquestion of whether the Eleventh Amendment prevents a disabled\n\nstudent from suing a state university for damages under Title II of\n\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§\n\n12131-12165.    Iván Toledo, a student at the University of Puerto\n\nRico who has schizoaffective disorder, brought an action under\n\nTitle II of the ADA alleging that the University and various\n\nUniversity officials discriminated against him on the basis of his\n\ndisability and failed to reasonably accommodate his disability.\n\nThe University moved to dismiss the Title II claims under Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 12(b)(6) and the Eleventh Amendment.     The district court\n\ngranted the motion on Eleventh Amendment immunity grounds, but\n\nlater reinstated the claims in the wake of the Supreme Court's\n\ndecision in Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004). The University\n\nfiled an interlocutory appeal to this court.   We have jurisdiction\n\nunder Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc.,\n\n506 U.S. 139 (1993), and we affirm.\n\n                                 I.\n\n          Because this case is at the motion to dismiss stage, we\n\naccept as true the facts alleged in the complaint and draw all\n\nreasonable     inferences   in   Toledo's    favor.      Educadores\n\nPuertorriqueños en Acción v. Hernández, 367 F.3d 61, 62 (1st Cir.\n\n2004); Neo Gen Screening, Inc. v. New England Newborn Screening\n\nProgram, 187 F.3d 24, 25 (1st Cir. 1999).   Toledo began his studies\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fat the University of Puerto Rico School of Architecture in the fall\n\nof   1999,    but     during   the    first    semester     his   mental   condition\n\ndeteriorated,        causing    him    to     experience     anxiety,   panic,    and\n\ndepression.         Because of his condition and the required treatment,\n\nhe was unable to attend classes regularly for part of the semester.\n\nWhen Toledo returned to a regular schedule, one of his professors\n\nrefused to accommodate his situation; because of the professor's\n\nrefusal to make any accommodation, Toledo turned in an incomplete\n\nassignment which the professor ridiculed in front of the class.\n\nToledo continued to request accommodation from the professor and\n\nschool administrators.          However, these requests were denied and he\n\ncompleted the semester with a grade of D in the course.\n\n              During the summer after his first year, Toledo suffered\n\nan emotional crisis, attempted suicide, and was hospitalized for\n\nsome time.      He was absent from school during the fall semester of\n\nhis second year for another hospital stay.                    When he returned to\n\nclasses, the school still refused to provide accommodation. Toledo\n\noften arrived up to 45 minutes late to class because of side\n\neffects      from    his   medication,        and   despite   presenting    medical\n\ncertificates and explaining his situation, his design professor\n\ntreated him differently from other students who arrived late.                     The\n\nprofessor also refused to grant him any additional time to complete\n\nhis work, causing Toledo to receive a failing grade in the class.\n\nLater,    the   dean       reprimanded      him     for   complaining   about    this\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\fprofessor on an evaluation form. Toledo had difficulty registering\n\nfor   classes   the   following     semester    due     to    his    poor      academic\n\nstanding. When the University refused to allow him to take courses\n\nat another university to preserve his standing, Toledo dropped out\n\nof school entirely.\n\n           After filing an administrative complaint with the United\n\nStates Department of Justice, Toledo filed a pro se complaint in\n\nthe United States District Court of Puerto Rico asserting claims\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983; the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 794; the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.; and the Constitution of\n\nthe   United    States,    among    other    claims.         The    University     and\n\nUniversity officials, who were sued in their official capacity,\n\nmoved to dismiss the Title II claims under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)\n\nand on Eleventh Amendment immunity grounds.                   The district court\n\ninitially granted this motion, but reinstated the claims upon\n\nToledo's motion after the Supreme Court's decision in Tennessee v.\n\nLane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004).            The University filed a motion for\n\nreconsideration under Rule 59(e), which was denied, and then filed\n\nthis interlocutory appeal.\n\n                                      II.\n\n           Congress       enacted    Title    II   of    the        ADA   to    combat\n\ndiscrimination by governmental entities in the operation of public\n\nservices, programs, and activities. It provides that \"no qualified\n\nindividual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability,\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fbe excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the\n\nservices,    programs,      or   activities   of   a   public    entity,      or   be\n\nsubjected to discrimination by any such entity.\"                   42 U.S.C. §\n\n12132.      The   statute    authorizes      private   suits    against       public\n\nentities    to    enforce   its   provisions.      See   42     U.S.C.    §    12133\n\n(incorporating by reference 29 U.S.C. § 794a).\n\n            The     Eleventh      Amendment     guarantees       that      private\n\nindividuals may not sue nonconsenting states1 in federal court.\n\nBd. of Trs. of the Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 363\n\n(2001).    Nevertheless, Congress can abrogate this immunity so long\n\nas it makes \"its intention to abrogate unmistakably clear in the\n\nlanguage of the statute\" and acts \"pursuant to a valid exercise of\n\nits power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"               Nevada Dep't of\n\nHuman Res. v. Hibbs, 538 U.S. 721, 726 (2003).                  With respect to\n\nTitle II, Congress has met the first requirement of unequivocally\n\nexpressing its intent to abrogate state sovereign immunity. See\n\nTennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 518 (2004) (citing 42 U.S.C. §\n\n12202).    As to the second requirement, the Supreme Court has held\n\nthat Title II of the ADA validly abrogates sovereign immunity as to\n\n\n     1\n      We have held on numerous occasions that Puerto Rico is a\nstate for Eleventh Amendment immunity purposes. See, e.g., De Leon\nLopez v. Corporacion Insular de Seguros, 931 F.2d 116, 121 (1st\nCir. 1991); Ramírez v. Puerto Rico Fire Serv., 715 F.2d 694, 697\n(1st Cir. 1983) (\"Puerto Rico, despite the lack of formal\nstatehood, enjoys the shelter of the Eleventh Amendment in all\nrespects.\"). The University of Puerto Rico is considered an arm of\nthe state within the purview of the Eleventh Amendment. Pinto v.\nUniv. of P.R., 895 F.2d 18, 18 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                       -6-\n\f(1) state conduct that actually violates the Constitution, United\n\nStates v. Georgia, 126 S. Ct. 877, 882 (2006), and (2) some classes\n\nof state conduct that do not facially violate the Constitution but\n\nare   prohibited   by   Title   II   in     order   to   \"prevent   and   deter\n\nunconstitutional conduct.\"      Lane, 541 U.S. at 518, 529.          Thus, in\n\norder to decide whether Toledo can sue the University for damages\n\nwe must determine \"on a claim-by-claim basis, (1) which aspects of\n\nthe state's alleged conduct violated Title II; (2) to what extent\n\nsuch misconduct also violated the Fourteenth Amendment; and (3)\n\ninsofar as such misconduct violated Title II but did not violate\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment, whether Congress's purported abrogation\n\nof sovereign immunity as to that class of conduct is nevertheless\n\nvalid.\"   Georgia, 126 S. Ct. at 882.\n\n                                     III.\n\n           Pursuant to the Supreme Court's direction in United\n\nStates v. Georgia, we first must ascertain if any aspect of the\n\nUniversity's alleged conduct states a claim for a violation of\n\nTitle II.2    To state a claim for a violation of Title II, a\n\nplaintiff must allege:     (1) that he is a qualified individual with\n\n\n      2\n      The United States, intervenor in this case, submitted a\nsupplemental letter brief after the Supreme Court's decision in\nGeorgia urging us to remand the case to the district court for the\ndetermination of whether Toledo validly alleged violations of Title\nII   and   whether   those   claims   would   independently   state\nconstitutional violations.     However, as this analysis simply\nrequires a legal determination under the standard set out in Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), and because a remand would further prolong the\nlengthy course of this litigation, we will address these questions.\n\n                                     -7-\n\fa disability; (2) that he was either excluded from participation in\n\nor denied the benefits of some public entity's services, programs,\n\nor activities or was otherwise discriminated against; and (3) that\n\nsuch exclusion, denial of benefits or discrimination was by reason\n\nof his disability.    Parker v. Universidad de Puerto Rico, 225 F.3d\n\n1, 4 (1st Cir. 2000); 42 U.S.C. § 12132.            Title II imposes an\n\naffirmative obligation on public entities to make their programs\n\naccessible to qualified individuals with disabilities, except where\n\ncompliance would result in a fundamental alteration of services or\n\nimpose an undue burden.    Parker, 225 F.3d at 5 (citing 28 C.F.R. §\n\n35.150).\n\n           Toledo's   Third   Amended   Complaint    alleges   that   the\n\nUniversity violated Title II of the ADA both by discriminating\n\nagainst him based on his disability and by failing to provide him\n\nwith reasonable accommodation.3 Toledo properly alleges that he is\n\na qualified individual with a disability as he alleges that he has\n\na mental impairment, schizoaffective disorder, that substantially\n\nlimits the major life activity of learning, and that save for his\n\ndisability he was qualified to participate in the architecture\n\n\n\n     3\n      Toledo's Third Amended Complaint also claims that the\nUniversity retaliated against him for demanding his rights under\nthe ADA, which would violate Title V of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §\n12203.   The district court did not evaluate this claim in the\nmotion to dismiss below and this interlocutory appeal only concerns\nthe reinstatement of Toledo's Title II claims. Accordingly, we do\nnot address whether Title V of the ADA validly abrogates state\nsovereign immunity.\n\n                                  -8-\n\fprogram at the University.              See 42 U.S.C. § 12131; 28 C.F.R. §\n\n35.104. He also sufficiently alleges that the University, a public\n\nentity governed by the ADA, engaged in conduct that violated Title\n\nII.   Toledo claims that he failed his design course as a result of\n\n\"discriminatory animus\" on the part of his professor and the dean,\n\nand that his design professor ignored him when he arrived late to\n\nclass unlike other tardy students without disabilities.                            Toledo\n\nalso avers that he was unable to fulfill the requirements of his\n\ncourses because of his disability and that his professors, his\n\nadvisor,    and     the    dean      all    refused        to    provide        reasonable\n\naccommodation      so    that   he   could       complete       his    course    work   and\n\nregister for classes.           For example, he states that his design\n\nprofessor suggested that he abandon his prescription medication\n\nbecause it was preventing him from arriving on time to class and\n\nadvised    him    that    she   would      not   grant     him    exceptions       or   any\n\nadditional time to complete his work.\n\n            The University may ultimately be able to negate the\n\ncharges    of    discrimination       or    show    that    the       two   instances   of\n\n\"discrimination\" in fact were simply the application of neutral\n\ncriteria that applied to disabled and nondisabled students alike.\n\nSee, e.g., Baird ex rel. Baird v. Rose, 192 F.3d 462, 467-68 (4th\n\nCir. 1999).       The University may also be able to show that it\n\nconsidered Toledo's accommodation requests but determined as a\n\nmatter of professional, academic judgment that such requests were\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\fnot reasonable because they would lower academic standards or\n\nsubstantially alter the degree program.           See Darian v. Univ. of\n\nMass. Boston, 980 F. Supp. 77, 88-89 (D. Mass. 1997).               However, at\n\nthis stage in the litigation, Toledo's complaint sufficiently\n\nalleges state conduct that violated Title II of the ADA.\n\n                                    IV.\n\n             The next step under United States v. Georgia is to\n\nevaluate whether any of the University's conduct that violated\n\nTitle   II   independently    states    a   violation   of    the   Fourteenth\n\nAmendment.    126 S. Ct. at 882.       There are two potential sources of\n\nconstitutional rights in the context of discrimination or a failure\n\nto accommodate a disability in public education:              the Due Process\n\nand the Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n             The Due Process Clause guarantees some notice and an\n\nopportunity to be heard before a student can be suspended or\n\nexpelled from school.        Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565, 574 (1975).\n\nThese rights are implicated when a student's future attendance at\n\na   public    institution    of   higher    education    is    in    jeopardy.\n\nSee Gorman v. Univ. of R.I., 837 F.2d 7 (1st Cir. 1988).              However,\n\nbecause Toledo voluntarily left the architecture program at the\n\nUniversity, his Title II claims raise no due process concerns.\n\n             The Equal Protection Clause requires states to treat\n\nalike all persons similarly situated. Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202,\n\n216 (1982).     To assess whether the University's conduct violated\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fthis guarantee, we must determine the appropriate level of scrutiny\n\nto be applied to Toledo's claims.              Unless state action burdens a\n\nsuspect class or impinges upon a fundamental right, we review equal\n\nprotection claims for a rational relationship between the disparity\n\nof treatment and a legitimate government purpose.             Heller v. Doe,\n\n509 U.S. 312, 319 (1993).\n\n            The disabled are not a suspect class for equal protection\n\npurposes.        City of Cleburne, Texas v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473\n\nU.S. 432, 439, 448-50 (1985). In addition, public education is not\n\na fundamental right.         San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez,\n\n411 U.S. 1, 35 (1973).         However, neither is education \"merely some\n\ngovernmental 'benefit' indistinguishable from other forms of social\n\nwelfare legislation.\"         Plyler, 457 U.S. at 221.     The Supreme Court\n\nhas \"repeatedly acknowledged the overriding importance of preparing\n\nstudents for work and citizenship, describing education as pivotal\n\nto   'sustaining      our    political   and    cultural   heritage'     with   a\n\nfundamental role in maintaining the fabric of society.\" Grutter v.\n\nBollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 331 (2003) (quoting Plyler, 457 U.S. at\n\n221); see also Brown v. Bd. of Educ., 347 U.S. 483, 493 (1954);\n\nBolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499-500 (1954).              Therefore, the\n\nSupreme Court struck down under heightened scrutiny the exclusion\n\nof a discrete group of children from a free public education\n\noffered     to    other     resident   children    as   violative   of    equal\n\nprotection.       Plyler, 457 U.S. at 230.\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\f              Nonetheless, aside from outright exclusion, the Supreme\n\nCourt continues to employ rational basis review for classifications\n\nthat burden the educational opportunities of a non-suspect class.\n\nSee Kadrmas v. Dickinson Public Sch., 487 U.S. 450, 459 (1988).\n\nTherefore, states may treat disabled students differently or refuse\n\nto make special accommodations for the disabled so long as the\n\nstates'   actions       are   rationally      related     to     some    legitimate\n\ngovernmental purpose.         Bd. of Trs. of the Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett,\n\n531 U.S. 356, 366-68 (2001).              States may not, however, treat\n\ndisabled students differently solely out of \"irrational prejudice.\"\n\nCleburne, 473 U.S. at 450.\n\n              With respect to Toledo's claims that the University\n\nfailed to accommodate his disability, he must allege that these\n\ndecisions were irrational and not motivated by any conceivable\n\nlegitimate reason.        See Garrett, 531 U.S. at 367-68; Heller, 509\n\nU.S. at 320.        Even reading Toledo's complaint generously, he has\n\nfailed to allege that the University's failure to accommodate his\n\nsituation was due to irrational prejudice and, indeed, rational\n\nbases for the actions are apparent from the face of the complaint.\n\nToledo alleges that the University failed to accommodate his\n\ndisability in the following ways:            his design professor refused to\n\nallow   him    to   regularly    arrive    late    to    class   and     made   class\n\nparticipation       a   substantial   part    of   the    grading       scheme,   two\n\nprofessors would not extend deadlines for written work, and the\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fUniversity declined to open an afternoon section of a required\n\ncourse when Toledo informed the Dean that he was unable to attend\n\nmorning sessions due to his medication.                All of these actions are\n\nrationally     related   to    the    University's       academic    mission      and\n\nbudgetary     constraints     and    thus   do   not    rise   to   the   level   of\n\nconstitutional violations.           See Heller, 509 U.S. at 320.\n\n            Toledo   also     contends      that   the     University     actively\n\ndiscriminated against him on the basis of his disability, rather\n\nthan merely failing to make accommodation.               Toledo claims that the\n\nDean and his professor gave him a failing grade in his design class\n\nbecause of their \"discriminatory animus\" and that his design\n\nprofessor treated him differently from other students who arrived\n\nlate to class.     Although there is no heightened pleading standard\n\nfor   civil     rights   claims,       mere      conclusory     allegations        of\n\ndiscrimination unsupported by any facts are insufficient for notice\n\npleading purposes.       See Educadores Puertorriqueños en Acción v.\n\nHernández, 367 F.3d 61, 68 (1st Cir. 2004).                In order to state a\n\nclaim for discrimination that violates equal protection, Toledo\n\nmust allege that he was intentionally treated differently from\n\nothers similarly situated and there was no rational basis for the\n\ndifference in treatment. Village of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528 U.S.\n\n562, 564 (2000) (per curiam).               However, Toledo admits in his\n\ncomplaint that he was repeatedly 45 minutes late to his design\n\nclass, absent for several weeks due to a hospital stay, and that\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fmany of his assignments were late or incomplete.                          He does not\n\nallege that any other students who had similar records received\n\nbetter than a failing grade.               Nor does he allege that any other\n\nlate-arriving students had the same record of repeated tardiness.\n\nSee   Aponte-Torres v. Univ. of P.R., 445 F.3d 50, 56-57 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).     Toledo has therefore failed to allege state conduct that\n\nindependently       states     a   claim     for    a   violation    of    the   Equal\n\nProtection Clause.\n\n                                           V.\n\n              Because Toledo has stated a claim that the University\n\nviolated Title II but not the Fourteenth Amendment, we must address\n\nwhether Congress's abrogation of sovereign immunity as to that\n\nclass    of     conduct   is   valid    as      a   prophylactic    measure      within\n\nCongress's § 5 power.          United States v. Georgia, 126 S. Ct. 877,\n\n882 (2006).       \"Legislation which deters or remedies constitutional\n\nviolations can fall within the sweep of Congress' enforcement power\n\neven if in the process it prohibits conduct which is not itself\n\nunconstitutional and intrudes into 'legislative spheres of autonomy\n\npreviously reserved to the States.'\"                    City of Boerne v. P.F.\n\nFlores, 521 U.S. 507, 518 (1997) (quoting Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer,\n\n427 U.S. 445, 455 (1976)); see also Nevada Dep't of Human Res. v.\n\nHibbs, 538 U.S. 721 (2003) (upholding Family and Medical Leave Act\n\nas      valid     prophylactic         legislation        designed        to     combat\n\n\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\funconstitutional sex discrimination although the state's leave\n\npolicy itself was constitutional).\n\n                To determine whether prophylactic legislation under § 5\n\nis valid, a court must consider: (1) the constitutional right or\n\nrights that Congress sought to protect when it enacted the statute;\n\n(2) whether there was a history of constitutional violations to\n\nsupport Congress's determination that prophylactic legislation was\n\nnecessary;       and   (3)     whether   the    statute    is    a    congruent      and\n\nproportional response to the history and pattern of constitutional\n\nviolations.        See Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 522-31 (2004)\n\n(describing the elements of the test first established by the\n\nSupreme Court in City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 529-36).\n\n                In applying the first two steps of the City of Boerne\n\ntest, the Court in Lane discussed the range of constitutional\n\nguarantees implicated by Title II and the history of constitutional\n\nviolations in all areas of public services, including health care,\n\nzoning, marriage, jury service, the penal system, public education,\n\nand voting.        Id. at 522-26.        The Court concluded that the \"sheer\n\nvolume     of     evidence     demonstrating     the    nature       and    extent   of\n\nunconstitutional discrimination against persons with disabilities\n\nin   the   provision      of    public   services,\"     made    it    \"clear    beyond\n\nperadventure that inadequate provision of public services and\n\naccess     to    public   facilities      was   an     appropriate         subject   for\n\nprophylactic legislation.\"           Id. at 528-29.        Then, at the third\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\fstep of the analysis, the Court chose to focus on the congruence\n\nand    proportionality       of   Title    II    as   applied   only   to    judicial\n\nservices, declining to consider Title II as an \"undifferentiated\n\nwhole.\"     Id. at 530.\n\n             Some appellate courts have chosen to interpret this\n\napproach    in   Lane   as    conclusively        establishing    that       Title   II\n\nsurvives the first two steps of the City of Boerne inquiry, leaving\n\nonly the congruence and proportionality of Title II at issue for\n\nfuture cases that concern other areas of government conduct.                     See,\n\ne.g., Constantine v. Rectors and Visitors of George Mason Univ.,\n\n411 F.3d 474, 487 (4th Cir. 2005); Cochran v. Pinchak, 401 F.3d\n\n184, 191 (3d Cir.), vacated pending decision in United States v.\n\nGeorgia, 412 F.3d 500 (3d Cir. 2005); Ass'n for Disabled Americans,\n\nInc. v. Fla. Int'l Univ., 405 F.3d 954, 958 (11th Cir. 2005).\n\nIndeed, we stated in Badillo-Santiago, M.D. v. Naveira-Merly, 378\n\nF.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir. 2004), that the Lane opinion establishes that\n\nTitle II as a whole satisfies the first two steps of City of\n\nBoerne.     However, that case was brought by a litigant who claimed\n\nthat    a   state   court     had    failed      to   accommodate      his    hearing\n\nimpairment, and so our decision involved a direct application of\n\nthe access to the courts holding of Lane. Therefore, our statement\n\nwas only dictum for purposes of Title II's application to other\n\nareas of government conduct.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\f            We believe the sounder approach is to focus the entire\n\nCity of Boerne test on the particular category of state conduct at\n\nissue.     As recognized by the Court in Lane, Title II \"reaches a\n\nwide array of official conduct in an effort to enforce an equally\n\nwide array of constitutional guarantees,\" applying \"not only to\n\npublic education and voting booth access but also to seating at\n\nstate-owned hockey rinks.\"         541 U.S. at 530.         The history of\n\ndiscrimination and the need for prophylaxis will vary greatly in\n\nthese different contexts.         It is necessary to understand the\n\nspecific constitutional rights and the history of constitutional\n\nviolations in the particular area at issue in order to determine\n\nthe congruence and proportionality of Title II's measures in that\n\narea.    While the Lane opinion does speak broadly about Title II in\n\nits discussion of the first two steps of the City of Boerne\n\ninquiry, the opinion separately addresses the particular rights at\n\nstake and the record of constitutional violations in the context of\n\njudicial services and later draws on that discussion in buttressing\n\nits     argument   that   Title   II     is   congruent   and   proportional\n\nlegislation as applied to judicial services. See Lane, 541 U.S. at\n\n523, 527, 531-32.\n\n            In order to apply the City of Boerne test to the class of\n\nconduct at issue here, we must ascertain the level of generality at\n\nwhich to conduct our inquiry.            The University contends that we\n\nshould limit our decision to the validity of Title II as it applies\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\fto the conduct of public universities, while the United States\n\ncontends that we should consider government conduct at all levels\n\nof public education.          In Lane, the Court decided the validity of\n\nTitle II as it applied to the class of cases implicating the\n\n\"accessibility of judicial services,\" including applications to\n\ncriminal defendants, civil litigants, jurors, public spectators,\n\nthe press, and witnesses. 514 U.S. at 531, 522-23.                    A number of\n\nthese statutory applications and the corresponding constitutional\n\nrights    that    they     implicated      were    neither    presented   by     the\n\nplaintiffs in Lane nor directly related to the facts of the case.\n\nThe Supreme Court's broad treatment of judicial services suggests\n\nthat we should consider Title II as it applies to public education\n\nin general.      The Lane opinion covered an even more varied range of\n\ngovernment conduct than the United States urges in this case, so we\n\nconclude that our analysis should be applied to public education\n\ngenerally.\n\n                                           A.\n\n            The    first      step   of   the    City   of   Boerne   analysis    is\n\nidentifying the constitutional rights that Congress sought to\n\nprotect by enacting Title II and applying it to public educational\n\ninstitutions.      Lane, 541 U.S. at 522.           The Supreme Court's Equal\n\nProtection Clause and Due Process Clause jurisprudence places a\n\nspecial   emphasis       on    the   constitutional      rights   implicated      by\n\ndiscrimination in public education, and Title II seeks to enforce\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\fthose rights by prohibiting discrimination against the disabled and\n\nproviding for accommodations of their special needs.\n\n               The Supreme Court has recognized the vital importance of\n\nall levels of public education in preparing students for work and\n\ncitizenship as well as the unique harm that occurs when some\n\nstudents are denied that opportunity.          See, e.g., Brown v. Bd. of\n\nEduc., 347 U.S. 483, 493 (1954) (\"[I]t is doubtful that any child\n\nmay reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the\n\nopportunity of an education\"); Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306,\n\n331 (2003) (\"[T]he diffusion of knowledge and opportunity through\n\npublic institutions of higher education must be accessible to all\n\nindividuals\").       The Court's decisions under the Equal Protection\n\nClause suggest that states cannot categorically deny disabled\n\nstudents access to public education.           See Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S.\n\n202, 221-22 (1982) (striking down on equal protection grounds the\n\ncomplete exclusion of the children of illegal aliens from public\n\nschools and noting that \"the benefits of education are not reserved\n\nto those whose productive utilization of them is a certainty\"); Bd.\n\nof Educ. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 200 (1982) (describing the\n\nEducation for All Handicapped Children Act, which requires states\n\nto    assure    disabled   students   access    to   public     education,   as\n\nproviding \"a 'basic floor of opportunity' consistent with equal\n\nprotection\"). In addition, the Due Process Clause protects against\n\nthe    arbitrary     exclusion   of    disabled      students    from   public\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\feducational institutions, in light of the property and liberty\n\ninterest in receiving a public education.                  See Bolling v. Sharpe,\n\n347 U.S. 497, 499-500 (1954); Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565, 574\n\n(1975); Gorman v. Univ. of R.I., 837 F.2d 7, 12 (1st Cir. 1988)\n\n(student's interest in pursuing a higher education is included\n\nwithin    the    Fourteenth     Amendment's     protection        of   liberty   and\n\nproperty).      Finally, with respect to the disabled students already\n\nattending public schools and universities, the Equal Protection\n\nClause prohibits \"irrational disability discrimination,\" therefore\n\nforbidding states from relying on irrational fears and prejudice to\n\ndiscriminate against disabled students or to deny them reasonable\n\naccommodation.       Lane, 541 U.S. at 522; Bd. of Trs. of the Univ. of\n\nAla. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 367 (2001).\n\n                                        B.\n\n            Having identified the constitutional rights implicated by\n\nthe states' treatment of the disabled in the area of public\n\neducation, we next consider whether there is a history of a\n\nviolation of those rights by the states.                   Lane, 541 U.S. at 523.\n\nMoreover,       we   evaluate    how    grave        and    how   widespread     the\n\nconstitutional        violations       were     in     order      to    judge    the\n\nappropriateness of prophylactic legislation.                  See Hibbs, 538 U.S.\n\nat 729.     We rely on the types of sources that the Supreme Court\n\n\n\n\n                                       -20-\n\fapproved of in Lane: state statutes, court decisions, and examples\n\nfrom the legislative history of the ADA.4\n\n            Historically, children with mental disabilities were\n\nlabeled \"ineducable\" and were categorically excluded from public\n\nschools to \"protect nonretarded children from them.\" Cleburne, 473\n\nU.S. at 463 (Marshall, J., concurring).           Congress first addressed\n\nthe   education   of   the   disabled     in   1966,   when    it    amended   the\n\nElementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to provide grants\n\nfor states to initiate and improve programs for the education of\n\nhandicapped children.        Pub. L. 89-750 § 161.         Yet by statute, a\n\nnumber of states continued to exclude children with disabilities\n\nfrom public education entirely.           See, e.g., Ala. Code § 21-1-10\n\n(1975); Del. Const. art. X, § 1 (1975); Neb. Rev. Stat. § 79-202\n\n(1971); N.C. Gen. Stat. § 115-165 (1966); Nev. Rev. Stat. § 392.050\n\n(1967); Tex. Code Ann. § 3260 (1990).\n\n            Numerous   lower      court   decisions    demonstrate      that   the\n\nstates were violating the Due Process and Equal Protection rights\n\nof    disabled   children    by    completely    denying      them   educational\n\nopportunities.      See, e.g., Pa. Ass'n for Retarded Children v.\n\nCommonwealth, 343 F. Supp. 279, 293, 297 (E.D.

No. 94-332, p.2 (1975)).\n\n            In response, in 1973 Congress enacted the Rehabilitation\n\nAct, 29 U.S.C. § 794, which forbids any program receiving federal\n\naid from discriminating against an individual by reason of a\n\nhandicap.    And in 1975 Congress went even further by enacting the\n\nEducation for All Handicapped Children Act, later renamed the\n\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act, which requires states\n\nreceiving federal funding for education to assure all handicapped\n\nchildren the right to a \"free appropriate public education.\"                 20\n\nU.S.C. § 1412(1).       The Supreme Court characterized this latter\n\nlegislation as intending to \"aid the States in complying with their\n\nconstitutional      obligations     to   provide     public   education      for\n\nhandicapped children.\"         Smith v. Robinson, 468 U.S. 992, 1009\n\n(1984).\n\n            Even   after     this   early   federal    legislation,     states\n\ncontinued    to    violate    the   constitutional     rights     of   disabled\n\nstudents.    See, e.g., Hairston v. Drosick, 423 F.

In addition, a\n\nnumber of cases brought under the Rehabilitation Act and the\n\nEducation of All Handicapped Children Act discuss the persistent\n\nnegative attitudes and irrational public fears that led to the\n\nexclusion of students with AIDS (who qualify as \"handicapped\") from\n\npublic schools, despite the lack of evidence of AIDS transmission\n\nin school settings.   See, e.g., Thomas v. Atascadero Unified Sch.\n\nDist., 662 F.Supp. 376 (C.D.Cal. 1986);   Robertson v. Granite City\n\nCmty. Unit Sch. Dist. No. 9, 684 F.Supp. 1002 (S.D. Ill. 1988); Doe\n\nv. Dolton Elem. Sch. Dist. No. 148, 694 F. Supp. 400 (N.D.

U.S. Civil Rights\n\nCommission, Accommodating the Spectrum of Individual Abilities 28-\n\n29 (1983).   Testimony before the House Committee on Education and\n\nLabor and the Senate Subcommittee on Disability Policy included\n\nstatements by numerous disabled individuals who had been excluded\n\nfrom participation or faced irrational prejudice at all levels of\n\n\n                               -24-\n\fpublic education. See generally, Staff of House Comm. on Education\n\nand Labor, 101st Cong., Legislative History of Pub. L. No. 101-336:\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act (Comm. Print 1990).\n\n      In sum, the thirty years preceding the enactment of the ADA\n\nevidence   a     widespread    pattern          of    states    unconstitutionally\n\nexcluding disabled children from public education and irrationally\n\ndiscriminating against disabled students within schools.                      Faced\n\nwith this record of persistent unconstitutional state action,\n\ncoupled with the inability of earlier federal legislation to solve\n\nthis \"difficult and intractable problem,\" Congress was justified in\n\nenacting prophylactic § 5 legislation in response.                   See Hibbs, 538\n\nU.S. at 735, 737.\n\n                                          C.\n\n           The remaining question is whether the provisions of Title\n\nII, as applied to public educational institutions, are a congruent\n\nand   proportional       response    to        this   history    and   pattern    of\n\nunconstitutional discrimination.               Lane, 541 U.S. at 530.      We must\n\ndetermine whether the application of Title II to public educational\n\ninstitutions is \"so out of proportion to a supposed remedial or\n\npreventive object that it cannot be understood as responsive to, or\n\ndesigned to prevent, unconstitutional behavior.\"                  City of Boerne,\n\n521 U.S. at 532.\n\n           Title    II    provides   that        otherwise     qualified   disabled\n\nstudents   may     not   be   excluded         from    educational     programs   or\n\n\n                                      -25-\n\factivities or otherwise discriminated against because of their\n\ndisabilities.       42 U.S.C. § 12132.        Schools and universities must\n\nmake \"reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or practices\" to\n\nensure that disabled students are able to participate in the\n\neducational program. In addition, they must remove \"architectural,\n\ncommunication, or transportation barriers\" and provide \"auxiliary\n\naids    and    services.\"      Lane,   541    U.S.    at     531-32   (discussing\n\nimplication of 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2)).\n\n               By requiring states to make special accommodations for\n\nthe disabled, Title II does impose a greater burden on states than\n\nthe    Fourteenth      Amendment   itself.     Garrett,      531   U.S.    at   367.\n\nNonetheless, Title II protects against the categorical exclusion\n\nand discrimination born of irrational fears that characterized past\n\nstate action with respect to disabled students.                Title II directs\n\nstates    to    make   reasonable   changes    to    their    programs     so   that\n\notherwise qualified disabled students can participate in public\n\neducation.      In addition, Title II addresses the fact that physical\n\nbarriers       historically   perpetuated      the   exclusion        of   disabled\n\nstudents.       See Garrett, 531 U.S. at 391 (App. C. to opinion of\n\nBreyer, J., dissenting) (collecting dozens of reports of the\n\ninaccessible facilities and programs at public schools and state\n\nuniversities) (cited in Lane, 541 U.S. at 526).\n\n               Title II's implementing regulations and the case law\n\ninterpreting the Act demonstrate that the obligations imposed by\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\fTitle II are limited in several ways that minimize the compliance\n\ncosts imposed on states.      States need not make structural changes\n\nto existing physical facilities if other methods can make the\n\nprogram or service accessible.         28 C.F.R. § 35.150(b) (2006).\n\nFurthermore, Title II requires only \"reasonable modifications\" to\n\nprograms and facilities and \"in no event is the entity required to\n\nundertake   measures   that   would    impose   an    undue   financial    or\n\nadministrative burden, threaten historic preservation interests, or\n\neffect a fundamental alteration in the nature of the service.\"\n\nLane at 532 (citing 28 C.F.R. § § 35.150(a)(2), (a)(3) (2003)); 28\n\nC.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7).    A state may take into account its limited\n\nresources as well as the needs of other students with disabilities\n\nin   determining   what   sorts   of     reasonable    modifications      are\n\nappropriate under Title II.     Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring,         527\n\nU.S. 581, 604, 607 (1999).        Finally, the ADA does not require\n\npublic schools and universities to accommodate disabled students if\n\nthe accommodation would substantially alter their programs or lower\n\nacademic standards, and courts give due deference to the judgment\n\nof education officials on these matters. See Bercovitch v. Baldwin\n\nSch., Inc., 133 F.3d 141, 152-53 (1st Cir. 1998); Darian v. Univ.\n\nof Mass. Boston, 980 F. Supp. 77, 88-89 (D. Mass. 1997).\n\n            The other appellate courts that have considered whether\n\nTitle II validly abrogates state sovereign immunity in the context\n\nof public education have concluded that it satisfies the City of\n\n\n                                  -27-\n\fBoerne inquiry.    See Ass'n for Disabled Americans v. Fla. Int'l\n\nUniv., 405 F.3d 954, 959 (11th Cir. 2005); Constantine v. Rectors\n\nand Visitors of George Mason Univ., 411 F.3d 474, 490 (4th Cir.\n\n2005). As the Eleventh Circuit emphasized in reaching its holding,\n\n\"Discrimination against disabled students in education affects\n\ndisabled persons' future ability to exercise and participate in the\n\nmost basic rights and responsibilities of citizenship, such as\n\nvoting and participation in public programs and services.\"   Ass'n\n\nfor Disabled Americans, 405 F.3d at 959.\n\n          We are similarly persuaded that Title II's prophylactic\n\nmeasures are justified by the persistent pattern of exclusion and\n\nirrational treatment of disabled students in public education,\n\ncoupled with the gravity of the harm worked by such discrimination.\n\nTitle II's provisions are consonant with the recognition in Plyler\n\nv. Doe that, without an education, individuals are deprived of \"the\n\nability to live within the structure of our civil institutions\" and\n\ntherefore foreclosed from \"any realistic possibility that they will\n\ncontribute in even the smallest way to the progress of our Nation.\"\n\n457 U.S. at 223.   Title II creates an affirmative obligation for\n\nstates to \"reasonably modify\" their programs so as to accommodate\n\nthe \"otherwise qualified\" disabled students of this nation. This\n\nobligation is not disproportionate to the need to protect against\n\nthe outright exclusion and irrational disability discrimination\n\nthat such students experienced in the recent past.\n\n\n                               -28-\n\f                               VI.\n\n          For the above reasons, we conclude that Title II, as it\n\napplies to the class of cases implicating the right of access to\n\npublic education, constitutes a valid exercise of Congress' § 5\n\nauthority to enforce the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nAccordingly, state sovereign immunity is not a defense to this\n\naction, and we affirm the district court's decision to reinstate\n\nToledo's Title II claims. Without a doubt, the district court will\n\nface further issues in evaluating Toledo's claim for relief, but as\n\nthe University is not entitled to sovereign immunity, those issues\n\nmust be addressed in further proceedings.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -29-\n\f",

Iv&#225;n Toledo, a student at the University of Puerto Rico who has schizoaffective disorder, brought an action under Title II of the ADA alleging that the University and various University officials discriminated against him on the basis of his disability and failed to reasonably accommodate his disability. The University moved to dismiss the Title II claims under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and the Eleventh Amendment. The district court granted the motion on Eleventh Amendment immunity grounds, but later reinstated the claims in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Tennessee v. Lane,</i> 541 U.S. 509, 124 S.Ct. 1978, 158 L.Ed.2d 820 (2004). The University filed an interlocutory appeal to this court. We have jurisdiction under <i>Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc.,</i> 506 U.S. 139, 113 S.Ct. 684, 121 L.Ed.2d 605 (1993), and we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this case is at the motion to dismiss stage, we accept as true the facts alleged in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in Toledo's favor. <i>Educadores Puertorrique&#241;os en Acci&#243;n v. Hern&#225;ndez,</i> 367 F.3d 61, 62 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Neo Gen Screening, Inc. v. New England Newborn Screening Program,</i> 187 F.3d 24, 25 (1st Cir.1999). Toledo began his studies at the University of Puerto Rico School of Architecture in the fall of 1999, but during the first semester his mental condition deteriorated, causing him to experience anxiety, panic, and depression. Because of his condition and the required treatment, he was unable to attend classes regularly for part of the semester. When Toledo returned to a regular schedule, one of his professors refused to accommodate his situation; because of the professor's refusal to make any accommodation, Toledo turned in an incomplete assignment which the professor ridiculed in front of the class. Toledo continued to request accommodation from the professor and school administrators. However, these requests were denied and he completed the semester with a grade of D in the course.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the summer after his first year, Toledo suffered an emotional crisis, attempted suicide, and was hospitalized for some time. He was absent from school during the fall semester of his second year for another hospital stay. When he returned to classes, the school still refused to provide accommodation. Toledo often arrived up to 45 minutes late to class because of side effects from his medication, and despite presenting medical certificates and explaining his situation, his design professor treated him differently from other students who arrived late. The professor also refused to grant him any additional time to complete his work, causing Toledo to receive a failing grade in the class. Later, the dean reprimanded him for complaining about this professor on an evaluation form. Toledo had difficulty registering for classes the following semester due to his poor academic standing. When the University refused to allow him to take courses at another university to preserve his standing, Toledo dropped out of school entirely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After filing an administrative complaint with the United States Department of Justice, Toledo filed a pro se complaint in the United States District Court of Puerto Rico asserting claims under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983; the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794; the ADA, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101 et seq.; and the Constitution of the United States, among other claims. The University and University officials, who were sued in their official capacity, moved to dismiss the Title II claims under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and on Eleventh Amendment immunity grounds. The district court initially granted this motion, but reinstated the claims upon Toledo's motion after the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Tennessee v. Lane,</i> 541 U.S. 509, 124 S.Ct. 1978, 158 L.Ed.2d 820 (2004). The University filed a motion for reconsideration under Rule 59(e), which was denied, and then filed this interlocutory appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress enacted Title II of the ADA to combat discrimination by governmental entities in the operation of public services, programs, and activities. It provides that \"no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12132. The statute authorizes private suits against public entities to enforce its provisions. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12133 (incorporating by reference 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Eleventh Amendment guarantees that private individuals may not sue nonconsenting states<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> in federal court. <i>Bd. of Trs. of the Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett,</i> 531 U.S. 356, 363, 121 S.Ct. 955, 148 L.Ed.2d 866 (2001). Nevertheless, Congress can abrogate this immunity so long as it makes \"its intention to abrogate unmistakably clear in the language of the statute\" and acts \"pursuant to a valid exercise of its power under &#167; 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" <i>Nevada Dep't of Human Res. v. Hibbs,</i> 538 U.S. 721, 726, 123 S.Ct. 1972, 155 L.Ed.2d 953 (2003). With respect to Title II, Congress has met the first requirement of unequivocally expressing its intent to abrogate state sovereign immunity. <i>See Tennessee v. Lane,</i> 541 U.S. 509, 518, 124 S.Ct. 1978, 158 L.Ed.2d 820 (2004) (citing 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12202). As to the second requirement, the Supreme Court has held that Title II of the ADA validly abrogates sovereign immunity as to (1) state conduct that actually violates the Constitution, <i>United States v. Georgia,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 877, 882, 163 L.Ed.2d 650 (2006), and (2) some classes of state conduct that do not facially violate the Constitution but are prohibited by Title II in order to \"prevent and deter unconstitutional conduct.\" <i>Lane,</i> 541 U.S. at 518, 529, 124 S.Ct. 1978. Thus, in order to decide whether Toledo can sue the University for damages we must determine \"on a claim-by-claim basis, (1) which aspects of the state's alleged conduct violated Title II; (2) to what extent such misconduct also violated the Fourteenth Amendment; and (3) insofar as such misconduct violated Title II but did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, whether Congress's purported abrogation of sovereign immunity as to that class of conduct is nevertheless valid.\" <i>Georgia,</i> 126 S.Ct. at 882.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to the Supreme Court's direction in <i>United States v. Georgia,</i> we first must ascertain if any aspect of the University's alleged conduct states a claim for a violation of Title II.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> To state a claim for a violation of Title II, a plaintiff must allege: (1) that he is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) that he was either excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of some public entity's services, programs, or activities or was otherwise discriminated against; and (3) that such exclusion, denial of benefits or discrimination was by reason of his disability. <i>Parker v. Universidad de Puerto Rico,</i> 225 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2000); 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12132. Title II imposes an affirmative obligation on public entities to make their programs accessible to qualified individuals with disabilities, except where compliance would result in a fundamental alteration of services or impose an undue burden. <i>Parker,</i> 225 F.3d at 5 (citing 28 C.F.R. &#167; 35.150).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Toledo's Third Amended Complaint alleges that the University violated Title II of the ADA both by discriminating against him based on his disability and by failing to provide him with reasonable accommodation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Toledo properly alleges that he is a qualified individual with a disability as he alleges that he has a mental impairment, schizoaffective disorder, that substantially limits the major life activity of learning, and that save for his disability he was qualified to participate in the architecture program at the University. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12131; 28 C.F.R. &#167; 35.104. He also sufficiently alleges that the University, a public entity governed by the ADA, engaged in conduct that violated Title II. Toledo claims that he failed his design course as a result of \"discriminatory animus\" on the part of his professor and the dean, and that his design professor ignored him when he arrived late to class unlike other tardy students without disabilities. Toledo also avers that he was unable to fulfill the requirements of his courses because of his disability and that his professors, his advisor, and the dean all refused to provide reasonable accommodation so that he could complete his course work and register for classes. For example, he states that his design professor suggested that he abandon his prescription medication because it was preventing him from arriving on time to class and advised him that she would not grant him exceptions or any additional time to complete his work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The University may ultimately be able to negate the charges of discrimination or show that the two instances of \"discrimination\" in fact were simply the application of neutral criteria that applied to disabled and nondisabled students alike. <i>See, e.g., Baird ex rel. Baird v. Rose,</i> 192 F.3d 462, 467-68 (4th Cir.1999). The University may also be able to show that it considered Toledo's accommodation requests but determined as a matter of professional, academic judgment that such requests were not reasonable because they would lower academic standards or substantially alter the degree program. <i>See Darian v. Univ. of Mass. Boston,</i> 980 F.Supp. 77, 88-89 (D.Mass.1997). However, at this stage in the litigation, Toledo's complaint sufficiently alleges state conduct that violated Title II of the ADA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next step under <i>United States v. Georgia</i> is to evaluate whether any of the University's conduct that violated Title II independently states a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. 126 S.Ct. at 882. There are two potential sources of constitutional rights in the context of discrimination or a failure to accommodate a disability in public education: the Due Process and the Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Due Process Clause guarantees some notice and an opportunity to be heard before a student can be suspended or expelled from school. <i>Goss v. Lopez,</i> 419 U.S. 565, 574, 95 S.Ct. 729, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 (1975). These rights are implicated when a student's future attendance at a public institution of higher education is in jeopardy. <i>See Gorman v. Univ. of R.I.,</i> 837 F.2d 7 (1st Cir.1988). However, because Toledo voluntarily left the architecture program at the University, his Title II claims raise no due process concerns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Equal Protection Clause requires states to treat alike all persons similarly situated. <i>Plyler v. Doe,</i> 457 U.S. 202, 216, 102 S.Ct. 2382, 72 L.Ed.2d 786 (1982). To assess whether the University's conduct violated this guarantee, we must determine the appropriate level of scrutiny to be applied to Toledo's claims. Unless state action burdens a suspect class or impinges upon a fundamental right, we review equal protection claims for a rational relationship between the disparity of treatment and a legitimate government purpose. <i>Heller v. Doe,</i> 509 U.S. 312, 319, 113 S.Ct. 2637, 125 L.Ed.2d 257 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The disabled are not a suspect class for equal protection purposes. <i>City of Cleburne, Texas v. Cleburne Living Ctr.,</i> 473 U.S. 432, 439, 448-50, 105 S.Ct. 3249, 87 L.Ed.2d 313 (1985). In addition, public education is not a fundamental right. <i>San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez,</i> 411 U.S. 1, 35, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973). However, neither is education \"merely some governmental `benefit' indistinguishable from other forms of social welfare legislation.\" <i>Plyler,</i> 457 U.S. at 221, 102 S.Ct. 2382. The Supreme Court has \"repeatedly acknowledged the overriding importance of preparing students for work and citizenship, describing education as pivotal to `sustaining our political and cultural heritage' with a fundamental role in maintaining the fabric of society.\" <i>Grutter v.

Therefore, the Supreme Court struck down under heightened scrutiny the exclusion of a discrete group of children from a free public education offered to other resident children as violative of equal protection. <i>Plyler,</i> 457 U.S. at 230, 102 S.Ct. 2382.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, aside from outright exclusion, the Supreme Court continues to employ rational basis review for classifications that burden the educational opportunities of a non-suspect class. <i>See Kadrmas v. Dickinson Public Sch.,</i> 487 U.S. 450, 459, 108 S.Ct. 2481, 101 L.Ed.2d 399 (1988). Therefore, states may treat disabled students differently or refuse to make special accommodations for the disabled so long as the states' actions are rationally related to some legitimate governmental purpose. <i>Bd. of Trs. of the Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett,</i> 531 U.S. 356, 366-68, 121 S.Ct. 955, 148 L.Ed.2d 866 (2001). States may not, however, treat disabled students differently solely out of \"irrational prejudice.\" <i>Cleburne,</i> 473 U.S. at 450, 105 S.Ct. 3249.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to Toledo's claims that the University failed to accommodate his disability, he must allege that these decisions were irrational and not motivated by any conceivable legitimate reason. <i>See Garrett,</i> 531 U.S. at 367-68, 121 S.Ct. 955; <i>Heller,</i> 509 U.S. at 320, 113 S.Ct. 2637. Even reading Toledo's complaint generously, he has failed to allege that the University's failure to accommodate his situation was due to irrational prejudice and, indeed, rational bases for the actions are apparent from the face of the complaint. Toledo alleges that the University failed to accommodate his disability in the following ways: his design professor refused to allow him to regularly arrive late to class and made class participation a substantial part of the grading scheme, two professors would not extend deadlines for written work, and the University declined to open an afternoon section of a required course when Toledo informed the Dean that he was unable to attend morning sessions due to his medication. All of these actions are rationally related to the University's academic mission and budgetary constraints and thus do not rise to the level of constitutional violations. <i>See Heller,</i> 509 U.S. at 320, 113 S.Ct. 2637.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Toledo also contends that the University actively discriminated against him on the basis of his disability, rather than merely failing to make accommodation. Toledo claims that the Dean and his professor gave him a failing grade in his design class because of their \"discriminatory animus\" and that his design professor treated him differently from other students who arrived late to class. Although there is no heightened pleading standard for civil rights claims, mere conclusory allegations of discrimination unsupported by any facts are insufficient for notice pleading purposes. <i>See Educadores Puertorrique&#241;os en Acci&#243;n v. Hern&#225;ndez,</i> 367 F.3d 61, 68 (1st Cir.2004). In order to state a claim for discrimination that violates equal protection, Toledo must allege that he was intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and there was no rational basis for the difference in treatment. <i>Village of Willowbrook v. Olech,</i> 528 U.S. 562, 564, 120 S.Ct. 1073, 145 L.Ed.2d 1060 (2000) (per curiam). However, Toledo admits in his complaint that he was repeatedly 45 minutes late to his design class, absent for several weeks due to a hospital stay, and that many of his assignments were late or incomplete. He does not allege that any other students who had similar records received better than a failing grade. Nor does he allege that any other late-arriving students had the same record of repeated tardiness. <i>See Aponte-Torres v. Univ. of P.R.,</i> 445 F.3d 50, 56-57 (1st Cir.2006). Toledo has therefore failed to allege state conduct that independently states a claim for a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Toledo has stated a claim that the University violated Title II but not the Fourteenth Amendment, we must address whether Congress's abrogation of sovereign immunity as to that class of conduct is valid as a prophylactic measure within Congress's &#167; 5 power. <i>United States v.

Lane,</i> 541 U.S. 509, 522-31, 124 S.Ct. 1978, 158 L.Ed.2d 820 (2004) (describing the elements of the test first established by the Supreme Court in <i>City of Boerne,</i> 521 U.S. at 529-36, 117 S.Ct. 2157).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In applying the first two steps of the <i>City of Boerne</i> test, the Court in <i>Lane</i> discussed the range of constitutional guarantees implicated by Title II and the history of constitutional violations in all areas of public services, including health care, zoning, marriage, jury service, the penal system, public education, and voting. <i>Id.</i> at 522-26, 117 S.Ct. 2157. The Court concluded that the \"sheer volume of evidence demonstrating the nature and extent of unconstitutional discrimination against persons with disabilities in the provision of public services,\" made it \"clear beyond peradventure that inadequate provision of public services and access to public facilities was an appropriate subject for prophylactic legislation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 528-29, 117 S.Ct. 2157. Then, at the third step of the analysis, the Court chose to focus on the congruence and proportionality of Title II as applied only to judicial services, declining to consider Title II as an \"undifferentiated whole.\" <i>Id.</i> at 530, 117 S.Ct. 2157.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some appellate courts have chosen to interpret this approach in <i>Lane</i> as conclusively establishing that Title II survives the first two steps of the <i>City of Boerne</i> inquiry, leaving only the congruence and proportionality of Title II at issue for future cases that concern other areas of government conduct. <i>See, e.g., Constantine v. Rectors and Visitors of George Mason Univ.,</i> 411 F.3d 474, 487 (4th Cir. 2005); <i>Cochran v. Pinchak,</i> 401 F.3d 184, 191 (3d Cir.), <i>vacated pending decision in</i> 412 F.3d 500 (3d Cir.2005); <i>Ass'n for Disabled Americans, Inc. v. Fla. Int'l Univ.,</i> 405 F.3d 954, 958 (11th Cir.2005). Indeed, we stated in <i>Badillo-Santiago, M.D. v. Naveira-Merly,</i> 378 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir. 2004), that the <i>Lane</i> opinion establishes that Title II as a whole satisfies the first two steps of <i>City of Boerne.</i> However, that case was brought by a litigant who claimed that a state court had failed to accommodate his hearing impairment, and so our decision involved a direct application of the access to the courts holding of <i>Lane.</i> Therefore, our statement was only dictum for purposes of Title II's application to other areas of government conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe the sounder approach is to focus the entire <i>City of Boerne</i> test on the particular category of state conduct at issue. As recognized by the Court in <i>Lane,</i> Title II \"reaches a wide array of official conduct in an effort to enforce an equally wide array of constitutional guarantees,\" applying \"not only to public education and voting booth access but also to seating at state-owned hockey rinks.\" 541 U.S. at 530, 124 S.Ct. 1978. The history of discrimination and the need for prophylaxis will vary greatly in these different contexts. It is necessary to understand the specific constitutional rights and the history of constitutional violations in the particular area at issue in order to determine the congruence and proportionality of Title II's measures in that area. While the <i>Lane</i> opinion does speak broadly about Title II in its discussion of the first two steps of the <i>City of Boerne</i> inquiry, the opinion separately addresses the particular rights at stake and the record of constitutional violations in the context of judicial services and later draws on that discussion in buttressing its argument that Title II is congruent and proportional legislation as applied to judicial services. <i>See Lane,</i> 541 U.S. at 523, 527, 531-32, 124 S.Ct. 1978.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to apply the <i>City of Boerne</i> test to the class of conduct at issue here, we must ascertain the level of generality at which to conduct our inquiry. The University contends that we should limit our decision to the validity of Title II as it applies to the conduct of public universities, while the United States contends that we should consider government conduct at all levels of public education. In <i>Lane,</i> the Court decided the validity of Title II as it applied to the class of cases implicating the \"accessibility of judicial services,\" including applications to criminal defendants, civil litigants, jurors, public spectators, the press, and witnesses. 514 U.S. at 531, 522-23, 115 S.Ct. 1597. A number of these statutory applications and the corresponding constitutional rights that they implicated were neither presented by the plaintiffs in <i>Lane</i> nor directly related to the facts of the case. The Supreme Court's broad treatment of judicial services suggests that we should consider Title II as it applies to public education in general. The <i>Lane</i> opinion covered an even more varied range of government conduct than the United States urges in this case, so we conclude that our analysis should be applied to public education generally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first step of the <i>City of Boerne</i> analysis is identifying the constitutional rights that Congress sought to protect by enacting Title II and applying it to public educational institutions. <i>Lane,</i> 541 U.S. at 522, 124 S.Ct. 1978. The Supreme Court's Equal Protection Clause and Due Process Clause jurisprudence places a special emphasis on the constitutional rights implicated by discrimination in public education, and Title II seeks to enforce those rights by prohibiting discrimination against the disabled and providing for accommodations of their special needs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has recognized the vital importance of all levels of public education in preparing students for work and citizenship as well as the unique harm that occurs when some students are denied that opportunity. <i>See, e.g., Brown v. Bd. of Educ.,</i> 347 U.S. 483, 493, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954) (\"[I]t is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education\"); <i>Grutter v.

The Court's decisions under the Equal Protection Clause suggest that states cannot categorically deny disabled students access to public education. <i>See Plyler v. Doe,</i> 457 U.S. 202, 221-22, 102 S.Ct. 2382, 72 L.Ed.2d 786 (1982) (striking down on equal protection grounds the complete exclusion of the children of illegal aliens from public schools and noting that \"the benefits of education are not reserved to those whose productive utilization of them is a certainty\"); <i>Bd. of Educ. v. Rowley,</i> 458 U.S. 176, 200, 102 S.Ct. 3034, 73 L.Ed.2d 690 (1982) (describing the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, which requires states to assure disabled students access to public education, as providing \"a `basic floor of opportunity' consistent with equal protection\"). In addition, the Due Process Clause protects against the arbitrary exclusion of disabled students from public educational institutions, in light of the property and liberty interest in receiving a public education. <i>See Bolling v. Sharpe,</i> 347 U.S. 497, 499-500, 74 S.Ct. 693, 98 L.Ed. 884 (1954); <i>Goss v. Lopez,</i> 419 U.S. 565, 574, 95 S.Ct. 729, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 (1975); <i>Gorman v. Univ. of R.I.,</i> 837 F.2d 7, 12 (1st Cir.1988) (student's interest in pursuing a higher education is included within the Fourteenth Amendment's protection of liberty and property). Finally, with respect to the disabled students already attending public schools and universities, the Equal Protection Clause prohibits \"irrational disability discrimination,\" therefore forbidding states from relying on irrational fears and prejudice to discriminate against disabled students or to deny them reasonable accommodation. <i>Lane,</i> 541 U.S. at 522, 124 S.Ct. 1978; <i>Bd. of Trs. of the Univ. of Ala. v.

Moreover, we evaluate how grave and how widespread the constitutional violations were in order to judge the appropriateness of prophylactic legislation. <i>See Hibbs,</i> 538 U.S. at 729, 123 S.Ct. 1972.

Furthermore, Title II requires only \"reasonable modifications\" to programs and facilities and \"in no event is the entity required to undertake measures that would impose an undue financial or administrative burden, threaten historic preservation interests, or effect a fundamental alteration in the nature of the service.\" <i>Lane</i> at 532, 124 S.Ct. 1978 (citing 28 C.F.R. &#167; &#167; 35.150(a)(2), (a)(3) (2003)); 28 C.F.R. &#167; 35.130(b)(7). A state may take into account its limited resources as well as the needs of other students with disabilities in determining what sorts of reasonable modifications are appropriate under Title II. <i>Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring,</i> 527 U.S. 581, 604, 607, 119 S.Ct. 2176, 144 L.Ed.2d 540 (1999). Finally, the ADA does not require public schools and universities to accommodate disabled students if the accommodation would substantially alter their programs or lower academic standards, and courts give due deference to the judgment of education officials on these matters. <i>See Bercovitch v. Baldwin Sch., Inc.,</i> 133 F.3d 141, 152-53 (1st Cir.1998); <i>Darian v. Univ. of Mass. Boston,</i> 980 F.Supp. 77, 88-89 (D.Mass. 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other appellate courts that have considered whether Title II validly abrogates state sovereign immunity in the context of public education have concluded that it satisfies the <i>City of Boerne</i> inquiry. <i>See Ass'n for Disabled Americans v. Fla. Int'l Univ.,</i> 405 F.3d 954, 959 (11th Cir. 2005); <i>Constantine v. Rectors and Visitors of George Mason Univ.,</i> 411 F.3d 474, 490 (4th Cir.2005). As the Eleventh Circuit emphasized in reaching its holding, \"Discrimination against disabled students in education affects disabled persons' future ability to exercise and participate in the most basic rights and responsibilities of citizenship, such as voting and participation in public programs and services.\" <i>Ass'n for Disabled Americans,</i> 405 F.3d at 959.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are similarly persuaded that Title II's prophylactic measures are justified by the persistent pattern of exclusion and irrational treatment of disabled students in public education, coupled with the gravity of the harm worked by such discrimination. Title II's provisions are consonant with the recognition in <i>Plyler v. Doe</i> that, without an education, individuals are deprived of \"the ability to live within the structure of our civil institutions\" and therefore foreclosed from \"any realistic possibility that they will contribute in even the smallest way to the progress of our Nation.\" 457 U.S. at 223, 102 S.Ct. 2382. Title II creates an affirmative obligation for states to \"reasonably modify\" their programs so as to accommodate the \"otherwise qualified\" disabled students of this nation. This obligation is not disproportionate to the need to protect against the outright exclusion and irrational disability discrimination that such students experienced in the recent past.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the above reasons, we conclude that Title II, as it applies to the class of cases implicating the right of access to public education, constitutes a valid exercise of Congress' &#167; 5 authority to enforce the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment. Accordingly, state sovereign immunity is not a defense to this action, and we affirm the district court's decision to reinstate Toledo's Title II claims. Without a doubt, the district court will face further issues in evaluating Toledo's claim for relief, but as the University is not entitled to sovereign immunity, those issues must be addressed in further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We have held on numerous occasions that Puerto Rico is a state for Eleventh Amendment immunity purposes<i>See, e.g., De Leon Lopez v.

Iv&#225;n Toledo, a student at the University of Puerto Rico who has schizoaffective disorder, brought an action under Title II of the ADA alleging that the University and various University officials discriminated against him on the basis of his disability and failed to reasonably accommodate his disability. The University moved to dismiss the Title II claims under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and the Eleventh Amendment. The district court granted the motion on Eleventh Amendment immunity grounds, but later reinstated the claims in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Tennessee v.

Toledo began his studies at the University of Puerto Rico School of Architecture in the fall of 1999, but during the first semester his mental condition deteriorated, causing him to experience anxiety, panic, and depression. Because of his condition and the required treatment, he was unable to attend classes regularly for part of the semester. When Toledo returned to a regular schedule, one of his professors refused to accommodate his situation; because of the professor's refusal to make any accommodation, Toledo turned in an incomplete assignment which the professor ridiculed in front of the class. Toledo continued to request accommodation from the professor and school administrators. However, these requests were denied and he completed the semester with a grade of D in the course.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the summer after his first year, Toledo suffered an emotional crisis, attempted suicide, and was hospitalized for some time. He was absent from school during the fall semester of his second year for another hospital stay. When he returned to classes, the school still refused to provide accommodation. Toledo often arrived up to 45 minutes late to class because of side effects from his medication, and despite presenting medical certificates and explaining his situation, his design professor treated him differently from other students who arrived late. The professor also refused to grant him any additional time to complete his work, causing Toledo to receive a failing grade in the class. Later, the dean reprimanded him for complaining about this professor on an evaluation form. Toledo had difficulty registering for classes the following semester due to his poor academic standing. When the University refused to allow him to take courses at another university to preserve his standing, Toledo dropped out of school entirely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After filing an administrative complaint with the United States Department of Justice, Toledo filed a pro se complaint in the United States District Court of Puerto Rico asserting claims under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983; the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794; the ADA, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101 et seq.; and the Constitution of the United States, among other claims. The University and University officials, who were sued in their official capacity, moved to dismiss the Title II claims under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and on Eleventh Amendment immunity grounds. The district court initially granted this motion, but reinstated the claims upon Toledo's motion after the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Tennessee v.

Nevertheless, Congress can abrogate this immunity so long as it makes \"its intention to abrogate unmistakably clear in the language of the statute\" and acts \"pursuant to a valid exercise of its power under &#167; 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" <i>Nevada Dep't of Human Res. v.

With respect to Title II, Congress has met the first requirement of unequivocally expressing its intent to abrogate state sovereign immunity. <i>See Tennessee v.

As to the second requirement, the Supreme Court has held that Title II of the ADA validly abrogates sovereign immunity as to (1) state conduct that actually violates the Constitution, <i>United States v. Georgia,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145697\"><a href=\"/opinion/145697/united-states-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus, in order to decide whether Toledo can sue the University for damages we must determine \"on a claim-by-claim basis, (1) which aspects of the state's alleged conduct violated Title II; (2) to what extent such misconduct also violated the Fourteenth Amendment; and (3) insofar as such misconduct violated Title II but did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, whether Congress's purported abrogation of sovereign immunity as to that class of conduct is nevertheless valid.\" <i>Georgia,</i> 126 S.Ct. at 882.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to the Supreme Court's direction in <i>United States v. Georgia,</i> we first must ascertain if any aspect of the University's alleged conduct states a claim for a violation of Title II.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> To state a claim for a violation of Title II, a plaintiff must allege: (1) that he is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) that he was either excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of some public entity's services, programs, or activities or was otherwise discriminated against; and (3) that such exclusion, denial of benefits or discrimination was by reason of his disability. <i>Parker v.

Title II imposes an affirmative obligation on public entities to make their programs accessible to qualified individuals with disabilities, except where compliance would result in a fundamental alteration of services or impose an undue burden. <i>Parker,</i> 225 F.3d at 5 (citing 28 C.F.R. &#167; 35.150).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Toledo's Third Amended Complaint alleges that the University violated Title II of the ADA both by discriminating against him based on his disability and by failing to provide him with reasonable accommodation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Toledo properly alleges that he is a qualified individual with a disability as he alleges that he has a mental impairment, schizoaffective disorder, that substantially limits the major life activity of learning, and that save for his disability he was qualified to participate in the architecture program at the University. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12131; 28 C.F.R. &#167; 35.104. He also sufficiently alleges that the University, a public entity governed by the ADA, engaged in conduct that violated Title II. Toledo claims that he failed his design course as a result of \"discriminatory animus\" on the part of his professor and the dean, and that his design professor ignored him when he arrived late to class unlike other tardy students without disabilities. Toledo also avers that he was unable to fulfill the requirements of his courses because of his disability and that his professors, his advisor, and the dean all refused to provide reasonable accommodation so that he could complete his course work and register for classes. For example, he states that his design professor suggested that he abandon his prescription medication because it was preventing him from arriving on time to class and advised him that she would not grant him exceptions or any additional time to complete his work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The University may ultimately be able to negate the charges of discrimination or show that the two instances of \"discrimination\" in fact were simply the application of neutral criteria that applied to disabled and nondisabled students alike. <i>See, e.g., Baird ex rel.

Even reading Toledo's complaint generously, he has failed to allege that the University's failure to accommodate his situation was due to irrational prejudice and, indeed, rational bases for the actions are apparent from the face of the complaint. Toledo alleges that the University failed to accommodate his disability in the following ways: his design professor refused to allow him to regularly arrive late to class and made class participation a substantial part of the grading scheme, two professors would not extend deadlines for written work, and the University declined to open an afternoon section of a required course when Toledo informed the Dean that he was unable to attend morning sessions due to his medication. All of these actions are rationally related to the University's academic mission and budgetary constraints and thus do not rise to the level of constitutional violations. <i>See Heller,</i> 509 U.S. at 320, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112896\"><a href=\"/opinion/112896/heller-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Toledo claims that the Dean and his professor gave him a failing grade in his design class because of their \"discriminatory animus\" and that his design professor treated him differently from other students who arrived late to class. Although there is no heightened pleading standard for civil rights claims, mere conclusory allegations of discrimination unsupported by any facts are insufficient for notice pleading purposes. <i>See Educadores Puertorrique&#241;os en Acci&#243;n v.

Nor does he allege that any other late-arriving students had the same record of repeated tardiness. <i>See Aponte-Torres v.

As recognized by the Court in <i>Lane,</i> Title II \"reaches a wide array of official conduct in an effort to enforce an equally wide array of constitutional guarantees,\" applying \"not only to public education and voting booth access but also to seating at state-owned hockey rinks.\" 541 U.S. at 530, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134743\"><a href=\"/opinion/134743/tennessee-v-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It is necessary to understand the specific constitutional rights and the history of constitutional violations in the particular area at issue in order to determine the congruence and proportionality of Title II's measures in that area. While the <i>Lane</i> opinion does speak broadly about Title II in its discussion of the first two steps of the <i>City of Boerne</i> inquiry, the opinion separately addresses the particular rights at stake and the record of constitutional violations in the context of judicial services and later draws on that discussion in buttressing its argument that Title II is congruent and proportional legislation as applied to judicial services. <i>See Lane,</i> 541 U.S. at 523, 527, 531-32, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134743\"><a href=\"/opinion/134743/tennessee-v-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The University contends that we should limit our decision to the validity of Title II as it applies to the conduct of public universities, while the United States contends that we should consider government conduct at all levels of public education. In <i>Lane,</i> the Court decided the validity of Title II as it applied to the class of cases implicating the \"accessibility of judicial services,\" including applications to criminal defendants, civil litigants, jurors, public spectators, the press, and witnesses. 514 U.S. at 531, 522-23, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117925\"><a href=\"/opinion/117925/california-dept-of-corrections-v-morales/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

A number of these statutory applications and the corresponding constitutional rights that they implicated were neither presented by the plaintiffs in <i>Lane</i> nor directly related to the facts of the case. The Supreme Court's broad treatment of judicial services suggests that we should consider Title II as it applies to public education in general. The <i>Lane</i> opinion covered an even more varied range of government conduct than the United States urges in this case, so we conclude that our analysis should be applied to public education generally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first step of the <i>City of Boerne</i> analysis is identifying the constitutional rights that Congress sought to protect by enacting Title II and applying it to public educational institutions. <i>Lane,</i> 541 U.S. at 522, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134743\"><a href=\"/opinion/134743/tennessee-v-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

U.S. Civil Rights Commission, <i>Accommodating the Spectrum of Individual Abilities</i> 28-29 (1983).

Faced with this record of persistent unconstitutional state action, coupled with the inability of earlier federal legislation to solve this \"difficult and intractable problem,\" Congress was justified in enacting prophylactic &#167; 5 legislation in response. <i>See Hibbs,</i> 538 U.S. at 735, 737, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127926\"><a href=\"/opinion/127926/nevada-department-of-human-resources-v-hibbs/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Nonetheless, Title II protects against the categorical exclusion and discrimination born of irrational fears that characterized past state action with respect to disabled students. Title II directs states to make reasonable changes to their programs so that otherwise qualified disabled students can participate in public education. In addition, Title II addresses the fact that physical barriers historically perpetuated the exclusion of disabled students. <i>See Garrett,</i> 531 U.S. at 391, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118407\"><a href=\"/opinion/118407/board-of-trustees-of-univ-of-ala-v-garrett/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Furthermore, Title II requires only \"reasonable modifications\" to programs and facilities and \"in no event is the entity required to undertake measures that would impose an undue financial or administrative burden, threaten historic preservation interests, or effect a fundamental alteration in the nature of the service.\" <i>Lane</i> at 532, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134743\"><a href=\"/opinion/134743/tennessee-v-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Finally, the ADA does not require public schools and universities to accommodate disabled students if the accommodation would substantially alter their programs or lower academic standards, and courts give due deference to the judgment of education officials on these matters. <i>See Bercovitch v.

Fla. Int'l Univ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76932\"><a href=\"/opinion/76932/association-for-disabled-v-fl-international-univ/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">954</span></a></span>, 959 (11th Cir. 2005); <i>Constantine v.

As the Eleventh Circuit emphasized in reaching its holding, \"Discrimination against disabled students in education affects disabled persons' future ability to exercise and participate in the most basic rights and responsibilities of citizenship, such as voting and participation in public programs and services.\" <i>Ass'n for Disabled Americans,</i> 405 F.3d at 959.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are similarly persuaded that Title II's prophylactic measures are justified by the persistent pattern of exclusion and irrational treatment of disabled students in public education, coupled with the gravity of the harm worked by such discrimination. Title II's provisions are consonant with the recognition in <i>Plyler v. Doe</i> that, without an education, individuals are deprived of \"the ability to live within the structure of our civil institutions\" and therefore foreclosed from \"any realistic possibility that they will contribute in even the smallest way to the progress of our Nation.\" 457 U.S. at 223, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110742\"><a href=\"/opinion/110742/plyler-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2382</span></a></span>. Title II creates an affirmative obligation for states to \"reasonably modify\" their programs so as to accommodate the \"otherwise qualified\" disabled students of this nation. This obligation is not disproportionate to the need to protect against the outright exclusion and irrational disability discrimination that such students experienced in the recent past.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the above reasons, we conclude that Title II, as it applies to the class of cases implicating the right of access to public education, constitutes a valid exercise of Congress' &#167; 5 authority to enforce the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment. Accordingly, state sovereign immunity is not a defense to this action, and we affirm the district court's decision to reinstate Toledo's Title II claims. Without a doubt, the district court will face further issues in evaluating Toledo's claim for relief, but as the University is not entitled to sovereign immunity, those issues must be addressed in further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We have held on numerous occasions that Puerto Rico is a state for Eleventh Amendment immunity purposes<i>See, e.g., De Leon Lopez v.
