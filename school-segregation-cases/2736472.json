The underlying lawsuit concerns the\r\nCity's placement of an electrical transmission line across open space park\r\nland. The land was acquired by the City as an approved venue project and funded\r\nthrough a venue tax. Hill brought several injunctive and declaratory judgment\r\nclaims against the City, but his appeal is based only on his claim that the\r\nCity breached its \"contract with the voters.\" Because we are\r\nconstrained by the plain language of section 334.041(b) of the Local Government\r\nCode, which grants the City broad authority to convey or otherwise dispose of\r\nan interest in an approved venue project, we affirm the trial court's judgment.<sup> (1)</sup> </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>Factual and Procedural\r\nBackground</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On May 6, 2000, City of San Antonio voters\r\napproved Proposition 3 which authorized an additional 1/8 of 1% sales and use\r\ntax, or \"venue tax,\" to fund the City's acquisition of land for use\r\nas linear parks along Salado and Leon Creeks and as open space parks over the\r\nEdwards Aquifer Recharge Zone; the project was designated an \"approved\r\nvenue project\" under Chapter 334 of the Texas Local Government Code. In\r\nFebruary 2002, using funds from the Proposition 3 venue tax, the City purchased\r\na portion of the Mayberry Ranch on the west side of Highway 211. In October\r\n2003, using Proposition 3 venue tax funds, the City purchased the Chris Hill\r\nTract - an unimproved 710 acre tract on the west side of Highway 211 which lies\r\nentirely in the Edwards Aquifer Recharge Zone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In early 2004, the City granted the San Antonio\r\nWater System (SAWS) a conservation easement in perpetuity on the Chris Hill\r\nTract, restricting the development and use of the property to low impact human\r\nactivities like hiking and camping, and related maintenance and infrastructure,\r\nand prohibiting any residential, commercial or industrial use. Also in early\r\n2004, after considering other alternatives to address increased demand for\r\nelectricity in the hill country, City Public Service (CPS) and the Lower\r\nColorado River Authority (LCRA) proposed constructing a 345,000 volt electrical\r\ntransmission line from the <span class=\"SpellE\">LCRA's</span> <span class=\"SpellE\">Cagnon</span>\r\nsubstation to <span class=\"SpellE\">CPS's</span> Kendall\r\nsubstation (the \"Project\"). As proposed, the transmission line would\r\nrun along the edge of the Mayberry and Chris Hill Tracts following an existing\r\nright-of-way adjacent to Highway 211, and would require placement of up to five\r\n17-story transmission towers. In January 2005, despite the City Planning Commission's\r\nrejection of the placement of the Project across Proposition 3 land, the City\r\nCouncil approved Ordinance 100326, granting CPS a limited easement over the two\r\nProposition 3 tracts for purposes of constructing, maintaining and operating\r\nthe Project. In a separate intra-jurisdictional agreement, CPS agreed to convey\r\nto the City 40 acres of additional open space land as compensating property. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Approximately one week after the City Council\r\napproved the Project, Hill filed suit in state district court seeking\r\ninjunctive and declaratory relief; Hill also challenged the Project in federal\r\ncourt and before the Public Utility Commission. Hill pled several declaratory\r\njudgment claims in the state case, including that Ordinance 100326 granting CPS\r\nan easement for the Project was void as a breach of the \"contract with the\r\nvoters\" created by Proposition 3 and its enabling resolution and\r\nordinances. The parties filed multiple partial summary judgment motions on the\r\nvarious claims raised by Hill. The trial court granted summary judgment in\r\nfavor of the City on Hill's claims under Article XI, § 11 of the Texas\r\nConstitution, the Texas Open Meetings Act and the City Charter. None of those\r\norders are challenged on appeal. The parties also filed cross-motions for\r\nsummary judgment on Hill's common law claim for breach of the City's\r\n\"contract with the voters,\" as well as his statutory claims under\r\nChapter 334 of the Local Government Code and Chapter 26 of the Texas Parks\r\nand Wildlife Code. The trial court overruled all of the parties' objections to\r\nthe summary judgment evidence, denied Hill's summary judgment motion, and\r\ngranted the City's summary judgment motion as to all of Hill's remaining\r\nclaims. The trial court further ordered Hill to pay $884,332 in attorney's fees\r\nto the City.<sup> (2)</sup> </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>Issue Presented</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On appeal, Hill challenges only the summary\r\njudgment in favor of the City on his common law breach of the \"contract\r\nwith the voters\" claim, and asserts the trial court instead should have granted\r\nsummary judgment for Hill on that claim. Hill also challenges the award of\r\nattorney's fees because they were not segregated by claim. The City's position\r\nin the trial court, and on appeal, is that it properly conveyed to CPS a\r\nlimited easement to use a small portion of the Proposition 3 land for the\r\nProject pursuant to the express statutory authority granted to it in section\r\n334.041(b) of the Local Government Code. Tex. Loc. <span class=\"SpellE\">Gov't</span>\r\nCode Ann. § 334.041(b) (Vernon 2005) (providing in relevant part, \"[a]\r\nmunicipality . . . may acquire, sell, lease, convey, or otherwise dispose of\r\nproperty or an interest in property, including an approved venue project, under\r\nterms and conditions determined by the municipality . . . \"). The basis of\r\nthe City's Third Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Hill's \"contract\r\nwith the voters\" claim was that the specific and broad grant of authority\r\nin section 334.041(b) conflicts with, and thus supersedes, the common law\r\ndoctrine of \"contract with the voters.\" On the other hand, Hill's\r\nsummary judgment motion asserted, in relevant part, that the City had not\r\n\"conveyed\" an interest in the property to CPS under section\r\n334.041(b), but rather the Ordinance had simply and plainly changed the\r\ndedicated use of the approved venue project and was thus unenforceable as a\r\nmatter of law. Hill also asserted that Chapter 334 does not abrogate or\r\n\"trump\" the common law doctrine of \"contract with the\r\nvoters,\" but instead works in harmony with, and is \"subject to,\"\r\nthe doctrine. While the trial court's order granting summary judgment for the\r\nCity does not recite the specific grounds on which it is based, the sole ground\r\nin the City's summary judgment motion with respect to Hill's \"contract\r\nwith the voters\" claim was that the express statutory language in section\r\n334.041(b) directly conflicts with, and thus supersedes, the common law\r\ncontract with the voters created by Proposition 3, and its enabling resolutions\r\nand ordinances. </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>Summary Judgment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><b>Standard of Review</b></em> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>When both parties move for summary judgment, and\r\nthe trial court grants one motion and denies the other, the appellate court\r\nconsiders the summary judgment evidence presented by both sides, determines all\r\nquestions presented, and, if it determines the trial court erred, renders the\r\njudgment the trial court should have rendered. <span class=\"GramE\"><em>Valence</em></span><span class=\"GramE\"><em> Operating\r\nCo. v.

In <span class=\"SpellE\"><em>McCraw</em></span>, a majority of the voters approved a\r\nfifteen-cent road tax to be levied by the county, as required by the Constitution;\r\nthe implementing statute further provided that the voters could repeal the road\r\ntax after two years, and that no bonds could be issued. <span class=\"GramE\"><em>Id.</em></span><span class=\"GramE\"> at 201.</span> The legislature subsequently enacted a statute\r\nauthorizing the commissioners' court to issue 40-year bonds on its own motion\r\nthat would constitute a charge against the fifteen-cent road tax. <span class=\"GramE\"><em>Id.</em></span><span class=\"GramE\"> at 202.</span> The Supreme Court concluded that, by authorizing\r\nthe county commissioners' court to issue the 40-year road-funding bonds without\r\na taxpayer vote, the legislature had impaired the voters' rights created at the\r\ntime they approved the fifteen-cent road tax, including the right to repeal the\r\ntax, thus violating not only the particular constitutional provision\r\nauthorizing the road tax to be imposed by the voters, but also article I,\r\nsection 16 prohibiting the impairment of contracts. <em>Id.</em>\r\nat 203; <em>see also San Antonio River Auth. v. <span class=\"SpellE\">Shepperd</span></em>,\r\n157 Tex. 73,\r\n299 S.W.2d 920, 924-26 (1957) (recognizing and applying the \"contract with\r\nthe voters\" concept).<sup> (3)</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As noted by both parties in their briefs, the\r\n\"contract with the voters\" doctrine encompasses two related\r\nprinciples governing (<span class=\"SpellE\">i</span>) the expenditure of the tax\r\nfunds for the approved purpose, and (ii) the continued use of the project for the\r\napproved purpose.

Loc. <span class=\"SpellE\">Gov't</span> Code\r\nAnn. § 334.041(a), (b) (Vernon 2005) (emphasis added); <em>see </em>Tex.

Hill argues the omission of express\r\nauthority to change the use of a venue project from section 334.041(b) gives\r\nrise to the \"clear implication\" that the use of an approved venue\r\nproject must not change - regardless of the City's conveyance of the project to\r\na private third party or other public entity. In essence, then, Hill argues\r\nthat section 334.041(b) is \"subject to,\" or incorporates, both\r\nprinciples of the \"contract with the voters\" doctrine. Therefore,\r\nthis appeal requires us to address the interplay between section 334.041(b) and\r\nthe common law \"contract with the voters\" concept with respect to the\r\napproved use of the Proposition 3 land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The City asserted at oral argument that the\r\ndispute can be resolved by answering two questions: (1) did the legislature\r\nhave the authority to supersede the common law \"contract with the voters\"\r\ndoctrine by contrary legislation? <span class=\"GramE\">and</span> (2) if so, did\r\nthe legislature do so in section 334.041(b)? The City contends the answer to\r\nboth questions is \"yes,\" and we are constrained to agree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><b>1. Legislative Authority to Supersede Common Law</b></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In construing statutes, courts begin by\r\ninterpreting the statutory language in a manner that renders it consistent with\r\nconstitutional requirements, if possible, because the legislature is presumed\r\nto have intended compliance with the constitution. <em>City of Houston v. Clark</em>,\r\n197 S.W.3d 314, 320 (Tex. 2006); <em>see also</em>\r\nTex. <span class=\"SpellE\">Gov't</span> Code Ann. § 311.021(1) (Vernon 2005)\r\n(\"[<span class=\"SpellE\">i</span>]n enacting a statute, it is presumed that\r\n... compliance with the constitutions of this state and the United States\r\nis intended\"). The courts further presume that statutes are enacted by the\r\nlegislature with full knowledge of, and reference to, the existing law. <span class=\"GramE\"><em>City of San Antonio v. Hardee</em>,\r\n70 S.W.3d 207, 213 (Tex.\r\nApp.--San Antonio 2001, no pet.).</span> When a statute directly conflicts with\r\na common law principle or claim, the statutory provision controls and preempts\r\nthe common law. <em>Cash America Int'l Inc. v.

Therefore, the answer to the\r\nfirst question concerning whether the legislature may enact legislation that\r\npreempts or supersedes a common law principle, even one that is\r\nconstitutionally-derived, is affirmative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><b>2. Interplay between § 334.041(b) and\r\n\"Contract with Voters\"</b></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reaching the crux of this appeal, we must next\r\ndetermine whether section 334.041(b) evidences the legislature's intent to\r\nsupersede the common law concept of \"contract with the voters,\"\r\nparticularly the second principle requiring continuous use for the dedicated\r\npublic purpose. In the trial court and on appeal, the City asserts that, under\r\nthe plain language of section 334.041(b), its \"contract with the\r\nvoters\" only extended to the first principle, <em>i.e.</em>, the initial\r\nexpenditure of the venue tax funds to acquire the property for use as park\r\nland. The City contends the broad grant of authority in section 334.041(b)\r\nsupersedes or preempts the second principle of \"contract with the\r\nvoters,\" and it therefore has no continuing obligation or duty to continue\r\nusing the acquired land for the dedicated public purpose, <em>i.e.</em>, as\r\nopen or linear park land. To illustrate, the City acknowledged at oral argument\r\nthat, according to its reading of the statute, it could use a voter-approved\r\nvenue tax to acquire land for construction of a major league baseball field as\r\na Chapter 334 \"approved venue project,\" and then later, under the\r\nauthority of section 334.041(b), convey that land, or a portion thereof, to a\r\nprivate third party for use as a toxic waste dump without violating its\r\n\"contract with the voters.\"<sup> (5)</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When construing a statute, the court's primary\r\npurpose is to give effect to the legislature's intent. <span class=\"GramE\"><em>Tex.</em></span><span class=\"GramE\"><em> Water <span class=\"SpellE\">Comm'n</span> v.

Applying the above principles of statutory construction, we must begin\r\nwith the presumptions that, when it enacted section 334.041(b), the legislature\r\nintended it to comply with the Constitution and it was aware of the\r\nconstitutionally-derived, common law concept of \"contract with the\r\nvoters.\" Next, we must construe the legislature's intent behind section\r\n334.041(b) based on the statute's plain language, considering it as a whole and\r\nwithin the context of Chapter 334. If we conclude the statutory text is\r\nunambiguous, we must adopt the interpretation supported by the plain language,\r\nunless it leads to absurd results. If we determine that the statute directly\r\nconflicts with the common law, the statute controls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at section 334.041 as a whole, and within\r\nthe context of Chapter 334, section 334.041 delineates the \"powers and\r\nduties\" of a municipality with respect to the \"planning, acquisition,\r\nestablishment, development, construction, or renovation\" of sports and\r\ncommunity venue projects. <span class=\"GramE\">Tex.</span><span class=\"GramE\"> Loc. <span class=\"SpellE\">Gov't</span> Code Ann. §§ 334.021(a), 334.041 (Vernon 2005).</span>\r\nAs noted, subsection (a) of section 334.041 grants a municipality the sweeping\r\npower to \"perform any act necessary to the full exercise of [its]\r\npowers\" under Chapter 334.

The remaining subsections (b) through (f) more\r\nspecifically describe the municipality's power to enter into contracts and take\r\ncertain actions with respect to acquiring and developing approved venue projects;\r\nsubsection (f) restricts the municipality's use of ad valorem taxes for an\r\napproved venue project. <span class=\"GramE\">Tex.</span><span class=\"GramE\"> Loc. <span class=\"SpellE\">Gov't</span> Code Ann. § 334.041(b)-(f) (Vernon 2005).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turning to the provision at issue, subsection (b)\r\nof section 334.041, the plain language of the first sentence gives a broad\r\nunequivocal grant of authority to a municipality to \"acquire, sell, lease,\r\nconvey, or otherwise dispose of property or an interest in property, including\r\nan approved venue project, <em>under terms and conditions determined by the\r\nmunicipality</em>.\" Tex. Loc. <span class=\"SpellE\">Gov't</span> Code Ann. §\r\n334.041(b) (emphasis added). By its plain language, it leaves the \"terms\r\nand conditions\" of such transactions completely to the municipality's\r\ndiscretion, and contains no express limitation or restriction on the\r\nmunicipality's power to \"convey or otherwise dispose of\" an interest\r\nin an approved venue project. Reading subsection (b) together with subsection\r\n(a)'s similarly unrestricted grant of authority to \"perform any act\r\nnecessary\" to exercise the municipality's powers under Chapter 334 compels\r\nus to conclude that by enacting section 334.041 the legislature intended to\r\nprovide municipalities with almost unlimited discretion and authority to\r\n\"acquire, sell, lease, convey, or otherwise dispose of\" approved\r\nvenue projects, or portions thereof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hill argues that the second sentence of section\r\n334.041(b) shows the legislature intended that the venue project property\r\ncontinue to be used for the dedicated purpose, despite any conveyance under\r\nsubsection (b). The second sentence provides that, in a subsection (b)\r\ntransaction between a municipality <span class=\"GramE\">or</span> county and\r\nanother public entity, the \"public purpose\" recognized in section\r\n334.044 is adequate consideration for the transaction. <span class=\"GramE\">Tex.\r\nLoc. <span class=\"SpellE\">Gov't</span> Code Ann. §§334.041(b), 334.044 (stating\r\nthat an approved venue project is held by the municipality or county for public\r\npurposes).</span> Hill asserts the second sentence of subsection (b) modifies\r\nthe broad powers granted in the first sentence, and clearly shows the\r\nlegislature intended to authorize a municipality to convey or dispose of an\r\ninterest in an approved venue project, but <em>only if</em> the dedicated\r\npublic purpose was continued. We respectfully disagree. If the legislature had\r\nintended to restrict a municipality's broad grant of power to dispose of an\r\ninterest in a venue project by making it \"subject to\" the continuous\r\nuse of the project for the dedicated purpose, it could have easily so provided.\r\nIt chose not to.<sup> (7)</sup> <em>See Fitzgerald, </em>996\r\nS.W.2d at 866 (\"it is a fair assumption that the Legislature tries to say\r\nwhat it means, and therefore the words it chooses should be the surest guide to\r\nlegislative intent\"); <em>see also Hardee</em>, 70 S.W.3d at 213\r\n(stating that if legislature wanted to exempt annexation challenges from\r\nmandamus and injunctive remedies provided for violations of Open Meetings Act,\r\nit could have done so, but did not).

The City responded at length, asserting that transfers of such\r\nproperty rights like easements and right-of-ways between the City, CPS and SAWS\r\nare distinguishable from transfers of fee simple property interests, and are\r\nproper \"conveyances\" of property interests under Chapter 334; it also\r\nasserted that transfers of such limited rights of access are commonplace and\r\nnecessary, attaching several examples of such agreements and conveyances to its\r\nsupplement to its Third Motion for Summary Judgment. We agree. The City's\r\nconveyance of a limited easement to CPS for extension of its electrical system,\r\nas occurred in this case, is distinguishable from the cases relied on by Hill\r\nbecause it is not a transfer of fee simple title to real property, but merely a\r\nlimited right of access necessary for the utility company to fulfill its\r\nindependent duty to maintain its utility system. <span class=\"GramE\"><em>See City\r\nof Robstown v.

Accordingly, we hold the trial court did not err in\r\ngranting summary judgment in favor of the City on Hill's \"contract with\r\nthe voters\" claim, and in denying summary judgment for Hill.<sup>\r\n(8)</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>Attorney's\r\nFees</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because the City prevailed on summary judgment,\r\nthe trial court awarded it $884,332 in <span class=\"SpellE\">unsegregated</span>\r\nattorney's fees for defending against Hill's various claims.<sup>\r\n(9)</sup> On appeal, Hill asserts the City was required to segregate its\r\nattorney's fees between claims because not all the claims asserted by Hill\r\nauthorized the recovery of attorney's fees - particularly, his claim for\r\ninjunctive relief based on a violation of Chapter 26 of the Texas Parks and\r\nWildlife Code. <em>See</em> Tex. Parks &amp; Wildlife Code Ann. §§ 26.001, <em>et\r\nseq.</em> (Vernon 2002) (containing no provision for recovery of attorney's\r\nfees based on a violation of the chapter). Hill does not claim the trial <span class=\"GramE\">court abused its discretion in awarding attorney's fees to the\r\nCity, or challenge</span> the amount of the fees as unreasonable. The City\r\nresponds that (<span class=\"SpellE\">i</span>) except for his request for an\r\ninjunction, all of Hill's claims were pled as claims for declaratory relief on\r\nwhich attorney's fees are recoverable, and (ii) Hill's request for injunctive\r\nrelief was intertwined with his substantive claims, and therefore the legal\r\nservices pertaining to each need not be segregated.

Code Ann. § 37.009 (Vernon 1997) (authorizing\r\naward of attorney's fees in suit for declaratory judgment). However, a review\r\nof Hill's pleadings does not support that statement. Hill filed a series of\r\namended petitions throughout the course of this lawsuit, which included many\r\ndifferent causes of action broadly pled under the following categories: (<span class=\"SpellE\">i</span>) \"constitutional violation\" of article XI, § 11\r\nof the Texas Constitution; (ii) violations of the Texas Open Meetings Act;\r\n(iii) violation of Chapter 26 of the Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife Code; (iv)\r\nbreach of contract; (v) fraud; (vi) application for temporary and permanent\r\ninjunction; and (vii) \"declaratory judgments\" seeking\r\n\"declaratory, injunctive and mandamus relief\" from enforcement of the\r\nCity Council's approval of the Project based on the various alleged statutory violations,\r\nincluding violations of Chapter 334 of the Local Government Code. Clearly then,\r\nHill pled other claims besides just declaratory judgment claims, particularly\r\nclaims for fraud and for injunctive relief based on various grounds. Moreover,\r\nunder <em>Chapa</em>, the determining factor as to whether fees must be\r\nsegregated is the type of legal services rendered with respect to the\r\nparticular claims, not simply the manner of pleading or the type of claim pled.\r\n<em>Chapa</em>, <span class=\"GramE\">212 S.W.3d at 313-14</span>. The test under <em>Chapa\r\n</em>is \"whether <em>discrete legal services</em> advance both a claim or\r\ndefense for which fees are recoverable and a claim or defense for which fees\r\nare unrecoverable . . . .\" <em>Nguyen</em>, <span class=\"GramE\">229 S.W.3d\r\nat 455</span>. The City's first attempt to justify the award of all its <span class=\"SpellE\">unsegregated</span> attorney's fees fails. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The City next asserts the exception to the\r\ngeneral duty to segregate fees, contending that all of Hill's claims were\r\n\"inextricably intertwined.\" Based on the record before us, we cannot\r\nagree that the City met its burden of establishing the exception to the general\r\nrule. First, <em>Chapa</em> clarified that intertwined facts alone are\r\ninsufficient to excuse segregation. In <em>Chapa</em> the Court expressly\r\ndisavowed the prior rule that suggested that a common set of underlying facts\r\nnecessarily makes all claims arising <span class=\"SpellE\">therefrom</span>\r\n\"inseparable\" and thus all legal fees recoverable. <em>Chapa</em>,\r\n212 S.W.3d at 313-14; <em>Varner</em>, 218 S.W.3d at 69 (noting that, \"[<span class=\"SpellE\">i</span>]n <em>Chapa</em>, we reestablished the rule that\r\nattorney's fees are recoverable only if necessary to recover on a contract or\r\nstatutory claim allowing them, and <em>eliminated</em> the exception for fees\r\nincurred solely on separate but arguably intertwined claims\") (emphasis\r\nadded).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, the City presented no proof that the\r\nlegal services rendered applied to all of Hill's claims, and could not be\r\nsegregated. The City's written request for attorney's fees was supported only\r\nby affidavits; there was no testimony or other evidence presented at the\r\nhearing on attorney's fees. The affidavits by the City's attorneys summarize\r\nthe total hours spent on the case by attorney time and paralegal time, describe\r\nthe hourly rates charged, and the total expenses incurred. Neither of the\r\naffidavits details the actual legal work performed. Neither of the affidavits\r\ncontains a statement that the legal services provided were intertwined and\r\ninseparable between claims, including those for injunctive relief. In other\r\nwords, the City presented no proof to support a finding under the <em>Chapa</em>\r\nstandard that the legal services provided in defending against the Chapter 26\r\ninjunction were the same as, or \"inextricably intertwined\" with, the\r\nlegal services rendered to defend against Hill's other claims. <em>See</em> <em>Nguyen</em>,\r\n229 S.W.3d at 455 (party seeking attorney's fees bears burden of demonstrating\r\nthat exception to duty to segregate fees applies). Because the City failed to\r\npresent any evidence supporting an exception, segregation of fees is required.\r\nBased on this record, the trial court erred in awarding the City attorney's\r\nfees for the total number of hours spent on the case. Accordingly, we reverse\r\nthe award of attorney's fees and remand for a new trial on the issue of\r\nattorney's fees. Tex. R.

The proposed amendment did\r\nnot pass. Hill asserts that the amendment's failure to pass shows Chapter 334\r\nwas understood by the drafters to require the continuation of the dedicated\r\npublic use; therefore, an amendment stating this requirement was not necessary.\r\nHill's argument is based on speculation as to the reason the amendment did not\r\npass. Moreover, legislators' statements during a debate cannot change the plain\r\nmeaning of the statute, which in this case grants broad unrestricted authority\r\nto municipalities to make conveyances of approved venue projects. <em>See\r\nFleming Foods of Tex., Inc., v. <span class=\"SpellE\">Rylander</span></em>, 6\r\nS.W.3d 278, 284 (Tex.\r\n1999) (legislative history cannot be used to alter or disregard express\r\nstatutory terms when their meaning is clear in context of entire code). <p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>7. </span><span>On the other hand, we note the legislature did choose\r\nto expressly codify the first principle of \"contract with the voters\"\r\nconcerning the initial use of the venue tax fund. <em>See</em> Tex. Loc. <span class=\"SpellE\">Gov't</span> Code Ann. § 334.042(d) (Vernon 2005) (providing,\r\n\"[t]he municipality or county may use money in the venue project fund to:\r\n(1) reimburse or pay the costs of planning, acquiring, establishing,\r\ndeveloping, constructing, or renovating one or more approved venue projects in\r\nthe municipality or county; (2) pay the principal of, interest on, and other\r\ncosts relating to bonds or other obligations issued by the municipality or\r\ncounty or to refund bonds, notes, or other obligations; or (3) pay the costs of\r\noperating or maintaining one or more approved venue projects\"). <p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>8. </span><span>We note, however, that the basic foundation of Hill's\r\ncomplaint is compelling - that at the time they approved Proposition 3 the\r\nvoters had no actual notice that the City could subsequently, on its own\r\ninitiative, without voter approval, convey an interest in the approved venue\r\nproject to a public or private entity for a different use of the property. If\r\nthe legislature believes voters should be informed, at the time they are asked\r\nto approve funding for a proposed venue project, that the municipality or\r\ncounty has the statutory authority to subsequently convey the venue project, or\r\nan interest in the project, for a different use without further voter approval,\r\nwe suggest the legislature consider amending Chapter 334 to include that\r\nrequirement. <p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>9. </span><span>It is undisputed that the City made no attempt to\r\nsegregate its attorney's fees. Further, we note that the attorney's fees were\r\nassessed only against plaintiffs Chris Hill and Gallagher Headquarters Ranch\r\nDevelopment, Ltd.; no fees were assessed against Julie Hooper because she did\r\nnot take an active role in the lawsuit. <p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",

The underlying lawsuit concerns the\r\nCity's placement of an electrical transmission line across open space park\r\nland. The land was acquired by the City as an approved venue project and funded\r\nthrough a venue tax. Hill brought several injunctive and declaratory judgment\r\nclaims against the City, but his appeal is based only on his claim that the\r\nCity breached its \"contract with the voters.\" Because we are\r\nconstrained by the plain language of section 334.041(b) of the Local Government\r\nCode, which grants the City broad authority to convey or otherwise dispose of\r\nan interest in an approved venue project, we affirm the trial court's judgment.<sup> (1)</sup> </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>Factual and Procedural\r\nBackground</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On May 6, 2000, City of San Antonio voters\r\napproved Proposition 3 which authorized an additional 1/8 of 1% sales and use\r\ntax, or \"venue tax,\" to fund the City's acquisition of land for use\r\nas linear parks along Salado and Leon Creeks and as open space parks over the\r\nEdwards Aquifer Recharge Zone; the project was designated an \"approved\r\nvenue project\" under Chapter 334 of the Texas Local Government Code. In\r\nFebruary 2002, using funds from the Proposition 3 venue tax, the City purchased\r\na portion of the Mayberry Ranch on the west side of Highway 211. In October\r\n2003, using Proposition 3 venue tax funds, the City purchased the Chris Hill\r\nTract - an unimproved 710 acre tract on the west side of Highway 211 which lies\r\nentirely in the Edwards Aquifer Recharge Zone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In early 2004, the City granted the San Antonio\r\nWater System (SAWS) a conservation easement in perpetuity on the Chris Hill\r\nTract, restricting the development and use of the property to low impact human\r\nactivities like hiking and camping, and related maintenance and infrastructure,\r\nand prohibiting any residential, commercial or industrial use. Also in early\r\n2004, after considering other alternatives to address increased demand for\r\nelectricity in the hill country, City Public Service (CPS) and the Lower\r\nColorado River Authority (LCRA) proposed constructing a 345,000 volt electrical\r\ntransmission line from the <span class=\"SpellE\">LCRA's</span> <span class=\"SpellE\">Cagnon</span>\r\nsubstation to <span class=\"SpellE\">CPS's</span> Kendall\r\nsubstation (the \"Project\"). As proposed, the transmission line would\r\nrun along the edge of the Mayberry and Chris Hill Tracts following an existing\r\nright-of-way adjacent to Highway 211, and would require placement of up to five\r\n17-story transmission towers. In January 2005, despite the City Planning Commission's\r\nrejection of the placement of the Project across Proposition 3 land, the City\r\nCouncil approved Ordinance 100326, granting CPS a limited easement over the two\r\nProposition 3 tracts for purposes of constructing, maintaining and operating\r\nthe Project. In a separate intra-jurisdictional agreement, CPS agreed to convey\r\nto the City 40 acres of additional open space land as compensating property. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Approximately one week after the City Council\r\napproved the Project, Hill filed suit in state district court seeking\r\ninjunctive and declaratory relief; Hill also challenged the Project in federal\r\ncourt and before the Public Utility Commission. Hill pled several declaratory\r\njudgment claims in the state case, including that Ordinance 100326 granting CPS\r\nan easement for the Project was void as a breach of the \"contract with the\r\nvoters\" created by Proposition 3 and its enabling resolution and\r\nordinances. The parties filed multiple partial summary judgment motions on the\r\nvarious claims raised by Hill. The trial court granted summary judgment in\r\nfavor of the City on Hill's claims under Article XI, § 11 of the Texas\r\nConstitution, the Texas Open Meetings Act and the City Charter. None of those\r\norders are challenged on appeal. The parties also filed cross-motions for\r\nsummary judgment on Hill's common law claim for breach of the City's\r\n\"contract with the voters,\" as well as his statutory claims under\r\nChapter 334 of the Local Government Code and Chapter 26 of the Texas Parks\r\nand Wildlife Code. The trial court overruled all of the parties' objections to\r\nthe summary judgment evidence, denied Hill's summary judgment motion, and\r\ngranted the City's summary judgment motion as to all of Hill's remaining\r\nclaims. The trial court further ordered Hill to pay $884,332 in attorney's fees\r\nto the City.<sup> (2)</sup> </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>Issue Presented</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On appeal, Hill challenges only the summary\r\njudgment in favor of the City on his common law breach of the \"contract\r\nwith the voters\" claim, and asserts the trial court instead should have granted\r\nsummary judgment for Hill on that claim. Hill also challenges the award of\r\nattorney's fees because they were not segregated by claim. The City's position\r\nin the trial court, and on appeal, is that it properly conveyed to CPS a\r\nlimited easement to use a small portion of the Proposition 3 land for the\r\nProject pursuant to the express statutory authority granted to it in section\r\n334.041(b) of the Local Government Code. Tex. Loc. <span class=\"SpellE\">Gov't</span>\r\nCode Ann. § 334.041(b) (Vernon 2005) (providing in relevant part, \"[a]\r\nmunicipality . . . may acquire, sell, lease, convey, or otherwise dispose of\r\nproperty or an interest in property, including an approved venue project, under\r\nterms and conditions determined by the municipality . . . \"). The basis of\r\nthe City's Third Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Hill's \"contract\r\nwith the voters\" claim was that the specific and broad grant of authority\r\nin section 334.041(b) conflicts with, and thus supersedes, the common law\r\ndoctrine of \"contract with the voters.\" On the other hand, Hill's\r\nsummary judgment motion asserted, in relevant part, that the City had not\r\n\"conveyed\" an interest in the property to CPS under section\r\n334.041(b), but rather the Ordinance had simply and plainly changed the\r\ndedicated use of the approved venue project and was thus unenforceable as a\r\nmatter of law. Hill also asserted that Chapter 334 does not abrogate or\r\n\"trump\" the common law doctrine of \"contract with the\r\nvoters,\" but instead works in harmony with, and is \"subject to,\"\r\nthe doctrine. While the trial court's order granting summary judgment for the\r\nCity does not recite the specific grounds on which it is based, the sole ground\r\nin the City's summary judgment motion with respect to Hill's \"contract\r\nwith the voters\" claim was that the express statutory language in section\r\n334.041(b) directly conflicts with, and thus supersedes, the common law\r\ncontract with the voters created by Proposition 3, and its enabling resolutions\r\nand ordinances. </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>Summary Judgment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><b>Standard of Review</b></em> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>When both parties move for summary judgment, and\r\nthe trial court grants one motion and denies the other, the appellate court\r\nconsiders the summary judgment evidence presented by both sides, determines all\r\nquestions presented, and, if it determines the trial court erred, renders the\r\njudgment the trial court should have rendered. <span class=\"GramE\"><em>Valence</em></span><span class=\"GramE\"><em> Operating\r\nCo. v.

In essence, then, Hill argues\r\nthat section 334.041(b) is \"subject to,\" or incorporates, both\r\nprinciples of the \"contract with the voters\" doctrine. Therefore,\r\nthis appeal requires us to address the interplay between section 334.041(b) and\r\nthe common law \"contract with the voters\" concept with respect to the\r\napproved use of the Proposition 3 land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The City asserted at oral argument that the\r\ndispute can be resolved by answering two questions: (1) did the legislature\r\nhave the authority to supersede the common law \"contract with the voters\"\r\ndoctrine by contrary legislation? <span class=\"GramE\">and</span> (2) if so, did\r\nthe legislature do so in section 334.041(b)?

Interplay between § 334.041(b) and\r\n\"Contract with Voters\"</b></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reaching the crux of this appeal, we must next\r\ndetermine whether section 334.041(b) evidences the legislature's intent to\r\nsupersede the common law concept of \"contract with the voters,\"\r\nparticularly the second principle requiring continuous use for the dedicated\r\npublic purpose. In the trial court and on appeal, the City asserts that, under\r\nthe plain language of section 334.041(b), its \"contract with the\r\nvoters\" only extended to the first principle, <em>i.e.</em>, the initial\r\nexpenditure of the venue tax funds to acquire the property for use as park\r\nland. The City contends the broad grant of authority in section 334.041(b)\r\nsupersedes or preempts the second principle of \"contract with the\r\nvoters,\" and it therefore has no continuing obligation or duty to continue\r\nusing the acquired land for the dedicated public purpose, <em>i.e.</em>, as\r\nopen or linear park land. To illustrate, the City acknowledged at oral argument\r\nthat, according to its reading of the statute, it could use a voter-approved\r\nvenue tax to acquire land for construction of a major league baseball field as\r\na Chapter 334 \"approved venue project,\" and then later, under the\r\nauthority of section 334.041(b), convey that land, or a portion thereof, to a\r\nprivate third party for use as a toxic waste dump without violating its\r\n\"contract with the voters.\"<sup> (5)</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When construing a statute, the court's primary\r\npurpose is to give effect to the legislature's intent. <span class=\"GramE\"><em>Tex.</em></span><span class=\"GramE\"><em> Water <span class=\"SpellE\">Comm'n</span> v.

Applying the above principles of statutory construction, we must begin\r\nwith the presumptions that, when it enacted section 334.041(b), the legislature\r\nintended it to comply with the Constitution and it was aware of the\r\nconstitutionally-derived, common law concept of \"contract with the\r\nvoters.\" Next, we must construe the legislature's intent behind section\r\n334.041(b) based on the statute's plain language, considering it as a whole and\r\nwithin the context of Chapter 334.

Reading subsection (b) together with subsection\r\n(a)'s similarly unrestricted grant of authority to \"perform any act\r\nnecessary\" to exercise the municipality's powers under Chapter 334 compels\r\nus to conclude that by enacting section 334.041 the legislature intended to\r\nprovide municipalities with almost unlimited discretion and authority to\r\n\"acquire, sell, lease, convey, or otherwise dispose of\" approved\r\nvenue projects, or portions thereof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hill argues that the second sentence of section\r\n334.041(b) shows the legislature intended that the venue project property\r\ncontinue to be used for the dedicated purpose, despite any conveyance under\r\nsubsection (b).

We respectfully disagree. If the legislature had\r\nintended to restrict a municipality's broad grant of power to dispose of an\r\ninterest in a venue project by making it \"subject to\" the continuous\r\nuse of the project for the dedicated purpose, it could have easily so provided.\r\nIt chose not to.<sup> (7)</sup> <em>See Fitzgerald, </em>996\r\nS.W.2d at 866 (\"it is a fair assumption that the Legislature tries to say\r\nwhat it means, and therefore the words it chooses should be the surest guide to\r\nlegislative intent\"); <em>see also Hardee</em>, 70 S.W.3d at 213\r\n(stating that if legislature wanted to exempt annexation challenges from\r\nmandamus and injunctive remedies provided for violations of Open Meetings Act,\r\nit could have done so, but did not).

Accordingly, we hold the trial court did not err in\r\ngranting summary judgment in favor of the City on Hill's \"contract with\r\nthe voters\" claim, and in denying summary judgment for Hill.<sup>\r\n(8)</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>Attorney's\r\nFees</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because the City prevailed on summary judgment,\r\nthe trial court awarded it $884,332 in <span class=\"SpellE\">unsegregated</span>\r\nattorney's fees for defending against Hill's various claims.<sup>\r\n(9)</sup> On appeal, Hill asserts the City was required to segregate its\r\nattorney's fees between claims because not all the claims asserted by Hill\r\nauthorized the recovery of attorney's fees - particularly, his claim for\r\ninjunctive relief based on a violation of Chapter 26 of the Texas Parks and\r\nWildlife Code. <em>See</em> Tex. Parks &amp; Wildlife Code Ann. §§ 26.001, <em>et\r\nseq.</em> (Vernon 2002) (containing no provision for recovery of attorney's\r\nfees based on a violation of the chapter). Hill does not claim the trial <span class=\"GramE\">court abused its discretion in awarding attorney's fees to the\r\nCity, or challenge</span> the amount of the fees as unreasonable. The City\r\nresponds that (<span class=\"SpellE\">i</span>) except for his request for an\r\ninjunction, all of Hill's claims were pled as claims for declaratory relief on\r\nwhich attorney's fees are recoverable, and (ii) Hill's request for injunctive\r\nrelief was intertwined with his substantive claims, and therefore the legal\r\nservices pertaining to each need not be segregated. We apply a hybrid standard\r\nof review to the issue of segregation because it is a mixed question of law and\r\nfact. <em>Tony <span class=\"SpellE\">Gullo</span> Motors I, L.P. v.

Thus, the general duty to\r\nsegregate fees applies, unless a party meets its burden of establishing that\r\nthe same discrete legal services were rendered with respect to both a\r\nrecoverable and unrecoverable claim. <span class=\"GramE\"><em>Chapa</em>, 212\r\nS.W.3d at 314; <em>Hong Kong Dev., Inc. v. Nguyen</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2349053\"><a href=\"/opinion/2349053/hong-kong-development-inc-v-nguyen/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></a></span>, 455 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st\r\nDist.] 2007, no pet.).</span> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In support of the fee award, the City first\r\nresponds that because Hill pled all of his various claims as part of a\r\ndeclaratory judgment action, for which attorney's fees are recoverable by <span class=\"GramE\">statute,</span> it had no duty to segregate fees because they all\r\nbecame recoverable claims. <em>See</em> Tex.\r\nCiv. <span class=\"SpellE\">Prac</span>. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 37.009 (Vernon 1997) (authorizing\r\naward of attorney's fees in suit for declaratory judgment). However, a review\r\nof Hill's pleadings does not support that statement. Hill filed a series of\r\namended petitions throughout the course of this lawsuit, which included many\r\ndifferent causes of action broadly pled under the following categories: (<span class=\"SpellE\">i</span>) \"constitutional violation\" of article XI, § 11\r\nof the Texas Constitution; (ii) violations of the Texas Open Meetings Act;\r\n(iii) violation of Chapter 26 of the Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife Code; (iv)\r\nbreach of contract; (v) fraud; (vi) application for temporary and permanent\r\ninjunction; and (vii) \"declaratory judgments\" seeking\r\n\"declaratory, injunctive and mandamus relief\" from enforcement of the\r\nCity Council's approval of the Project based on the various alleged statutory violations,\r\nincluding violations of Chapter 334 of the Local Government Code. Clearly then,\r\nHill pled other claims besides just declaratory judgment claims, particularly\r\nclaims for fraud and for injunctive relief based on various grounds. Moreover,\r\nunder <em>Chapa</em>, the determining factor as to whether fees must be\r\nsegregated is the type of legal services rendered with respect to the\r\nparticular claims, not simply the manner of pleading or the type of claim pled.\r\n<em>Chapa</em>, <span class=\"GramE\">212 S.W.3d at 313-14</span>. The test under <em>Chapa\r\n</em>is \"whether <em>discrete legal services</em> advance both a claim or\r\ndefense for which fees are recoverable and a claim or defense for which fees\r\nare unrecoverable . . . .\" <em>Nguyen</em>, <span class=\"GramE\">229 S.W.3d\r\nat 455</span>. The City's first attempt to justify the award of all its <span class=\"SpellE\">unsegregated</span> attorney's fees fails. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The City next asserts the exception to the\r\ngeneral duty to segregate fees, contending that all of Hill's claims were\r\n\"inextricably intertwined.\" Based on the record before us, we cannot\r\nagree that the City met its burden of establishing the exception to the general\r\nrule. First, <em>Chapa</em> clarified that intertwined facts alone are\r\ninsufficient to excuse segregation. In <em>Chapa</em> the Court expressly\r\ndisavowed the prior rule that suggested that a common set of underlying facts\r\nnecessarily makes all claims arising <span class=\"SpellE\">therefrom</span>\r\n\"inseparable\" and thus all legal fees recoverable. <em>Chapa</em>,\r\n212 S.W.3d at 313-14; <em>Varner</em>, 218 S.W.3d at 69 (noting that, \"[<span class=\"SpellE\">i</span>]n <em>Chapa</em>, we reestablished the rule that\r\nattorney's fees are recoverable only if necessary to recover on a contract or\r\nstatutory claim allowing them, and <em>eliminated</em> the exception for fees\r\nincurred solely on separate but arguably intertwined claims\") (emphasis\r\nadded).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, the City presented no proof that the\r\nlegal services rendered applied to all of Hill's claims, and could not be\r\nsegregated. The City's written request for attorney's fees was supported only\r\nby affidavits; there was no testimony or other evidence presented at the\r\nhearing on attorney's fees. The affidavits by the City's attorneys summarize\r\nthe total hours spent on the case by attorney time and paralegal time, describe\r\nthe hourly rates charged, and the total expenses incurred. Neither of the\r\naffidavits details the actual legal work performed. Neither of the affidavits\r\ncontains a statement that the legal services provided were intertwined and\r\ninseparable between claims, including those for injunctive relief. In other\r\nwords, the City presented no proof to support a finding under the <em>Chapa</em>\r\nstandard that the legal services provided in defending against the Chapter 26\r\ninjunction were the same as, or \"inextricably intertwined\" with, the\r\nlegal services rendered to defend against Hill's other claims. <em>See</em> <em>Nguyen</em>,\r\n229 S.W.3d at 455 (party seeking attorney's fees bears burden of demonstrating\r\nthat exception to duty to segregate fees applies). Because the City failed to\r\npresent any evidence supporting an exception, segregation of fees is required.\r\nBased on this record, the trial court erred in awarding the City attorney's\r\nfees for the total number of hours spent on the case. Accordingly, we reverse\r\nthe award of attorney's fees and remand for a new trial on the issue of\r\nattorney's fees. Tex. R.

In addition, high\r\nwires span the poles, overlapping the existing right-of-way along State Highway\r\n211.

The proposed amendment did\r\nnot pass. Hill asserts that the amendment's failure to pass shows Chapter 334\r\nwas understood by the drafters to require the continuation of the dedicated\r\npublic use; therefore, an amendment stating this requirement was not necessary.\r\nHill's argument is based on speculation as to the reason the amendment did not\r\npass. Moreover, legislators' statements during a debate cannot change the plain\r\nmeaning of the statute, which in this case grants broad unrestricted authority\r\nto municipalities to make conveyances of approved venue projects. <em>See\r\nFleming Foods of Tex., Inc., v. <span class=\"SpellE\">Rylander</span></em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2277356\"><a href=\"/opinion/2277356/fleming-foods-of-texas-inc-v-rylander/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">278</span></a></span>, 284 (Tex.\r\n1999) (legislative history cannot be used to alter or disregard express\r\nstatutory terms when their meaning is clear in context of entire code). <p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>7. </span><span>On the other hand, we note the legislature did choose\r\nto expressly codify the first principle of \"contract with the voters\"\r\nconcerning the initial use of the venue tax fund. <em>See</em> Tex. Loc. <span class=\"SpellE\">Gov't</span> Code Ann. § 334.042(d) (Vernon 2005) (providing,\r\n\"[t]he municipality or county may use money in the venue project fund to:\r\n(1) reimburse or pay the costs of planning, acquiring, establishing,\r\ndeveloping, constructing, or renovating one or more approved venue projects in\r\nthe municipality or county; (2) pay the principal of, interest on, and other\r\ncosts relating to bonds or other obligations issued by the municipality or\r\ncounty or to refund bonds, notes, or other obligations; or (3) pay the costs of\r\noperating or maintaining one or more approved venue projects\"). <p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>8. </span><span>We note, however, that the basic foundation of Hill's\r\ncomplaint is compelling - that at the time they approved Proposition 3 the\r\nvoters had no actual notice that the City could subsequently, on its own\r\ninitiative, without voter approval, convey an interest in the approved venue\r\nproject to a public or private entity for a different use of the property. If\r\nthe legislature believes voters should be informed, at the time they are asked\r\nto approve funding for a proposed venue project, that the municipality or\r\ncounty has the statutory authority to subsequently convey the venue project, or\r\nan interest in the project, for a different use without further voter approval,\r\nwe suggest the legislature consider amending Chapter 334 to include that\r\nrequirement. <p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>9. </span><span>It is undisputed that the City made no attempt to\r\nsegregate its attorney's fees. Further, we note that the attorney's fees were\r\nassessed only against plaintiffs Chris Hill and Gallagher Headquarters Ranch\r\nDevelopment, Ltd.; no fees were assessed against Julie Hooper because she did\r\nnot take an active role in the lawsuit. <p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",
