UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 14–981.      Argued December 9, 2015—Decided June 23, 2016\nThe University of Texas at Austin (University) uses an undergraduate\n  admissions system containing two components. First, as required by\n  the State’s Top Ten Percent Law, it offers admission to any students\n  who graduate from a Texas high school in the top 10% of their class.\n  It then fills the remainder of its incoming freshman class, some 25%,\n  by combining an applicant’s “Academic Index”—the student’s SAT\n  score and high school academic performance—with the applicant’s\n  “Personal Achievement Index,” a holistic review containing numerous\n  factors, including race. The University adopted its current admis-\n  sions process in 2004, after a year-long-study of its admissions pro-\n  cess—undertaken in the wake of Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306,\n  and Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 244—led it to conclude that its prior\n  race-neutral system did not reach its goal of providing the education-\n  al benefits of diversity to its undergraduate students.\n     Petitioner Abigail Fisher, who was not in the top 10% of her high\n  school class, was denied admission to the University’s 2008 freshman\n  class. She filed suit, alleging that the University’s consideration of\n  race as part of its holistic-review process disadvantaged her and oth-\n  er Caucasian applicants, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.\n  The District Court entered summary judgment in the University’s fa-\n  vor, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed. This Court vacated the judg-\n  ment, Fisher v. University of Tex. at Austin, 570 U. S. ___ (Fisher I),\n  and remanded the case to the Court of Appeals, so the University’s\n  program could be evaluated under the proper strict scrutiny stand-\n  ard. On remand, the Fifth Circuit again affirmed the entry of sum-\n  mary judgment for the University.\nHeld: The race-conscious admissions program in use at the time of peti-\n  tioner’s application is lawful under the Equal Protection Clause.\n\f2             FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEX. AT AUSTIN\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Pp. 6–20.\n       (a) Fisher I sets out three controlling principles relevant to as-\n    sessing the constitutionality of a public university’s affirmative ac-\n    tion program. First, a university may not consider race “unless the\n    admissions process can withstand strict scrutiny,” i.e., it must show\n    that its “purpose or interest is both constitutionally permissible and\n    substantial, and that its use of the classification is necessary” to ac-\n    complish that purpose. 570 U. S., at ___. Second, “the decision to\n    pursue the educational benefits that flow from student body diversity\n    is, in substantial measure, an academic judgment to which some, but\n    not complete, judicial deference is proper.” Id., at ___. Third, when\n    determining whether the use of race is narrowly tailored to achieve\n    the university’s permissible goals, the school bears the burden of\n    demonstrating that “available” and “workable” “race-neutral alterna-\n    tives” do not suffice. Id., at ___. Pp. 6–8.\n       (b) The University’s approach to admissions gives rise to an unusu-\n    al consequence here. The component with the largest impact on peti-\n    tioner’s chances of admission was not the school’s consideration of\n    race under its holistic-review process but the Top Ten Percent Plan.\n    Because petitioner did not challenge the percentage part of the plan,\n    the record is devoid of evidence of its impact on diversity. Remand\n    for further factfinding would serve little purpose, however, because at\n    the time of petitioner’s application, the current plan had been in ef-\n    fect only three years and, in any event, the University lacked author-\n    ity to alter the percentage plan, which was mandated by the Texas\n    Legislature. These circumstances refute any criticism that the Uni-\n    versity did not make good faith efforts to comply with the law. The\n    University, however, does have a continuing obligation to satisfy the\n    strict scrutiny burden: by periodically reassessing the admission pro-\n    gram’s constitutionality, and efficacy, in light of the school’s experi-\n    ence and the data it has gathered since adopting its admissions plan,\n    and by tailoring its approach to ensure that race plays no greater role\n    than is necessary to meet its compelling interests. Pp. 8–11.\n        (c) Drawing all reasonable inferences in her favor, petitioner has\n    not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that she was denied\n    equal treatment at the time her application was rejected. Pp. 11–19.\n          (1) Petitioner claims that the University has not articulated its\n    compelling interest with sufficient clarity because it has failed to\n    state more precisely what level of minority enrollment would consti-\n    tute a “critical mass.” However, the compelling interest that justifies\n    consideration of race in college admissions is not an interest in enrol-\n    ling a certain number of minority students, but an interest in obtain-\n    ing “the educational benefits that flow from student body diversity.”\n    Fisher I, 570 U. S., at ___. Since the University is prohibited from\n\f                      Cite as: 579 U. S. ____ (2016)                      3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  seeking a particular number or quota of minority students, it cannot\n  be faulted for failing to specify the particular level of minority en-\n  rollment at which it believes the educational benefits of diversity will\n  be obtained.\n     On the other hand, asserting an interest in the educational benefits\n  of diversity writ large is insufficient. A university’s goals cannot be\n  elusory or amorphous—they must be sufficiently measurable to per-\n  mit judicial scrutiny of the policies adopted to reach them. The rec-\n  ord here reveals that the University articulated concrete and precise\n  goals—e.g., ending stereotypes, promoting “cross-racial understand-\n  ing,” preparing students for “an increasingly diverse workforce and\n  society,” and cultivating leaders with “legitimacy in the eyes of the\n  citizenry”—that mirror the compelling interest this Court has ap-\n  proved in prior cases. It also gave a “reasoned, principled explana-\n  tion” for its decision, id., at ___, in a 39-page proposal written after a\n  year-long study revealed that its race-neutral policies and programs\n  did not meet its goals. Pp. 11–13.\n       (2) Petitioner also claims that the University need not consider\n  race because it had already “achieved critical mass” by 2003 under\n  the Top Ten Percent Plan and race-neutral holistic review. The rec-\n  ord, however, reveals that the University studied and deliberated for\n  months, concluding that race-neutral programs had not achieved the\n  University’s diversity goals, a conclusion supported by significant\n  statistical and anecdotal evidence. Pp. 13–15.\n       (3) Petitioner argues further that it was unnecessary to consider\n  race because such consideration had only a minor impact on the\n  number of minority students the school admitted. But the record\n  shows that the consideration of race has had a meaningful, if still\n  limited, effect on freshman class diversity. That race consciousness\n  played a role in only a small portion of admissions decisions should\n  be a hallmark of narrow tailoring, not evidence of unconstitutionali-\n  ty. P. 15.\n       (4) Finally, petitioner argues that there were numerous other\n  race-neutral means to achieve the University’s goals. However, as\n  the record reveals, none of those alternatives was a workable means\n  of attaining the University’s educational goals, as of the time of her\n  application.

UNIVERSITY\n          OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN, ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 23, 2016] \n\n\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The Court is asked once again to consider whether the\nrace-conscious admissions program at the University of\nTexas is lawful under the Equal Protection Clause.\n                             I\n   The University of Texas at Austin (or University) relies\nupon a complex system of admissions that has undergone\nsignificant evolution over the past two decades. Until\n1996, the University made its admissions decisions pri­\nmarily based on a measure called “Academic Index” (or\nAI), which it calculated by combining an applicant’s\nSAT score and academic performance in high school. In\nassessing applicants, preference was given to racial\nminorities.\n   In 1996, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit inval­\nidated this admissions system, holding that any considera­\ntion of race in college admissions violates the Equal Pro­\ntection Clause. See Hopwood v. Texas, 78 F. 3d 932, 934–\n935, 948.\n   One year later the University adopted a new admissions\npolicy. Instead of considering race, the University began\n\f2        FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEX. AT AUSTIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmaking admissions decisions based on an applicant’s AI\nand his or her “Personal Achievement Index” (PAI). The\nPAI was a numerical score based on a holistic review of an\napplication. Included in the number were the applicant’s\nessays, leadership and work experience, extracurricular\nactivities, community service, and other “special charac­\nteristics” that might give the admissions committee in­\nsight into a student’s background. Consistent with\nHopwood, race was not a consideration in calculating an\napplicant’s AI or PAI.\n  The Texas Legislature responded to Hopwood as well. It\nenacted H. B. 588, commonly known as the Top Ten Per­\ncent Law. Tex. Educ. Code Ann. §51.803 (West Cum.\nSupp. 2015). As its name suggests, the Top Ten Percent\nLaw guarantees college admission to students who gradu­\nate from a Texas high school in the top 10 percent of their\nclass. Those students may choose to attend any of the\npublic universities in the State.\n  The University implemented the Top Ten Percent Law\nin 1998. After first admitting any student who qualified\nfor admission under that law, the University filled the\nremainder of its incoming freshman class using a combi­\nnation of an applicant’s AI and PAI scores—again, without\nconsidering race.\n  The University used this admissions system until 2003,\nwhen this Court decided the companion cases of Grutter v.\nBollinger, 539 U. S. 306, and Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U. S.\n244. In Gratz, this Court struck down the University of\nMichigan’s undergraduate system of admissions, which at\nthe time allocated predetermined points to racial minority\ncandidates. See 539 U. S., at 255, 275–276. In Grutter,\nhowever, the Court upheld the University of Michigan\nLaw School’s system of holistic review—a system that did\nnot mechanically assign points but rather treated race as\na relevant feature within the broader context of a candi­\ndate’s application. See 539 U. S., at 337, 343–344. In\n\f                  Cite as: 579 U. S. ____ (2016)              3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nupholding this nuanced use of race, Grutter implicitly\noverruled Hopwood’s categorical prohibition.\n   In the wake of Grutter, the University embarked upon a\nyear-long study seeking to ascertain whether its admis­\nsions policy was allowing it to provide “the educational\nbenefits of a diverse student body . . . to all of the Univer­\nsity’s undergraduate students.” App. 481a–482a (affidavit\nof N. Bruce Walker ¶11 (Walker Aff.)); see also id., at\n445a–447a. The University concluded that its admissions\npolicy was not providing these benefits. Supp. App. 24a–\n25a.\n   To change its system, the University submitted a pro­\nposal to the Board of Regents that requested permission to\nbegin taking race into consideration as one of “the many\nways in which [an] academically qualified individual\nmight contribute to, and benefit from, the rich, diverse,\nand challenging educational environment of the Univer­\nsity.” Id., at 23a. After the board approved the proposal,\nthe University adopted a new admissions policy to imple­\nment it. The University has continued to use that admis­\nsions policy to this day.\n   Although the University’s new admissions policy was a\ndirect result of Grutter, it is not identical to the policy this\nCourt approved in that case. Instead, consistent with the\nState’s legislative directive, the University continues to fill\na significant majority of its class through the Top Ten\nPercent Plan (or Plan). Today, up to 75 percent of the\nplaces in the freshman class are filled through the Plan.\nAs a practical matter, this 75 percent cap, which has now\nbeen fixed by statute, means that, while the Plan contin­\nues to be referenced as a “Top Ten Percent Plan,” a stu­\ndent actually needs to finish in the top seven or eight\npercent of his or her class in order to be admitted under\nthis category.\n   The University did adopt an approach similar to the one\nin Grutter for the remaining 25 percent or so of the incom­\n\f4         FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEX. AT AUSTIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ning class. This portion of the class continues to be admit­\nted based on a combination of their AI and PAI scores.\nNow, however, race is given weight as a subfactor within\nthe PAI. The PAI is a number from 1 to 6 (6 is the best)\nthat is based on two primary components. The first com­\nponent is the average score a reader gives the applicant on\ntwo required essays. The second component is a full-file\nreview that results in another 1-to-6 score, the “Personal\nAchievement Score” or PAS. The PAS is determined by a\nseparate reader, who (1) rereads the applicant’s required\nessays, (2) reviews any supplemental information the\napplicant submits (letters of recommendation, resumes, an\nadditional optional essay, writing samples, artwork, etc.),\nand (3) evaluates the applicant’s potential contributions to\nthe University’s student body based on the applicant’s\nleadership      experience,    extracurricular    activities,\nawards/honors, community service, and other “special\ncircumstances.”\n   “Special circumstances” include the socioeconomic sta­\ntus of the applicant’s family, the socioeconomic status of\nthe applicant’s school, the applicant’s family responsibili­\nties, whether the applicant lives in a single-parent home,\nthe applicant’s SAT score in relation to the average SAT\nscore at the applicant’s school, the language spoken at the\napplicant’s home, and, finally, the applicant’s race. See\nApp. 218a–220a, 430a.\n   Both the essay readers and the full-file readers who\nassign applicants their PAI undergo extensive training to\nensure that they are scoring applicants consistently.\nDeposition of Brian Breman 9–14, Record in No. 1: 08–\nCV–00263, (WD Tex.), Doc. 96–3. The Admissions Office\nalso undertakes regular “reliability analyses” to “measure\nthe frequency of readers scoring within one point of each\nother.” App. 474a (affidavit of Gary M. Lavergne ¶8); see\nalso id., at 253a (deposition of Kedra Ishop (Ishop Dep.)).\nBoth the intensive training and the reliability analyses\n\f                 Cite as: 579 U. S. ____ (2016)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\naim to ensure that similarly situated applicants are being\ntreated identically regardless of which admissions officer\nreads the file.\n   Once the essay and full-file readers have calculated each\napplicant’s AI and PAI scores, admissions officers from\neach school within the University set a cutoff PAI/AI score\ncombination for admission, and then admit all of the\napplicants who are above that cutoff point. In setting the\ncutoff, those admissions officers only know how many\napplicants received a given PAI/AI score combination.\nThey do not know what factors went into calculating those\napplicants’ scores. The admissions officers who make the\nfinal decision as to whether a particular applicant will be\nadmitted make that decision without knowing the appli­\ncant’s race. Race enters the admissions process, then, at\none stage and one stage only—the calculation of the PAS.\n   Therefore, although admissions officers can consider\nrace as a positive feature of a minority student’s applica­\ntion, there is no dispute that race is but a “factor of a\nfactor of a factor” in the holistic-review calculus. 645\nF. Supp. 2d 587, 608 (WD Tex. 2009). Furthermore, con­\nsideration of race is contextual and does not operate as a\nmechanical plus factor for underrepresented minorities.\nId., at 606 (“Plaintiffs cite no evidence to show racial\ngroups other than African-Americans and Hispanics are\nexcluded from benefitting from UT’s consideration of race\nin admissions. As the Defendants point out, the consider­\nation of race, within the full context of the entire applica­\ntion, may be beneficial to any UT Austin applicant—\nincluding whites and Asian-Americans”); see also Brief for\nAsian American Legal Defense and Education Fund et al.\nas Amici Curiae 12 (the contention that the University\ndiscriminates against Asian-Americans is “entirely un­\nsupported by evidence in the record or empirical data”).\nThere is also no dispute, however, that race, when consid­\nered in conjunction with other aspects of an applicant’s\n\f6         FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEX. AT AUSTIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbackground, can alter an applicant’s PAS score. Thus,\nrace, in this indirect fashion, considered with all of the\nother factors that make up an applicant’s AI and PAI\nscores, can make a difference to whether an application is\naccepted or rejected.\n   Petitioner Abigail Fisher applied for admission to the\nUniversity’s 2008 freshman class. She was not in the top\n10 percent of her high school class, so she was evaluated\nfor admission through holistic, full-file review. Petition­\ner’s application was rejected.\n   Petitioner then filed suit alleging that the University’s\nconsideration of race as part of its holistic-review process\ndisadvantaged her and other Caucasian applicants, in\nviolation of the Equal Protection Clause. See U. S. Const.,\nAmdt. 14, §1 (no State shall “deny to any person within its\njurisdiction the equal protection of the laws”). The Dis­\ntrict Court entered summary judgment in the University’s\nfavor, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.\n   This Court granted certiorari and vacated the judgment\nof the Court of Appeals, Fisher v. University of Tex. at\nAustin, 570 U. S. ___ (2013) (Fisher I ), because it had\napplied an overly deferential “good-faith” standard in\nassessing the constitutionality of the University’s pro­\ngram. The Court remanded the case for the Court of\nAppeals to assess the parties’ claims under the correct\nlegal standard.\n   Without further remanding to the District Court, the\nCourt of Appeals again affirmed the entry of summary\njudgment in the University’s favor. 758 F. 3d 633 (CA5\n2014). This Court granted certiorari for a second time,\n576 U. S. ___ (2015), and now affirms.\n                             II\n  Fisher I set forth three controlling principles relevant to\nassessing the constitutionality of a public university’s\naffirmative-action program. First, “because racial charac­\n\f                   Cite as: 579 U. S. ____ (2016)              7\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nteristics so seldom provide a relevant basis for disparate\ntreatment,” Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469,\n505 (1989), “[r]ace may not be considered [by a university]\nunless the admissions process can withstand strict scru­\ntiny,” Fisher I, 570 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). Strict scru-\ntiny requires the university to demonstrate with clarity\nthat its “ ‘purpose or interest is both constitutionally per­\nmissible and substantial, and that its use of the classifica­\ntion is necessary . . . to the accomplishment of its pur­\npose.’ ” Ibid.\n   Second, Fisher I confirmed that “the decision to pursue\n‘the educational benefits that flow from student body\ndiversity’ . . . is, in substantial measure, an academic\njudgment to which some, but not complete, judicial defer­\nence is proper.” Id., at ___ (slip op, at 9). A university\ncannot impose a fixed quota or otherwise “define diversity\nas ‘some specified percentage of a particular group merely\nbecause of its race or ethnic origin.’ ” Ibid. Once, however,\na university gives “a reasoned, principled explanation” for\nits decision, deference must be given “to the University’s\nconclusion, based on its experience and expertise, that a\ndiverse student body would serve its educational goals.”\nIbid. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n   Third, Fisher I clarified that no deference is owed when\ndetermining whether the use of race is narrowly tailored\nto achieve the university’s permissible goals. Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 10). A university, Fisher I explained, bears the\nburden of proving a “nonracial approach” would not pro­\nmote its interest in the educational benefits of diversity\n“about as well and at tolerable administrative expense.”\nId., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (internal quotation marks omit­\nted). Though “[n]arrow tailoring does not require exhaus­\ntion of every conceivable race-neutral alternative” or\n“require a university to choose between maintaining a\nreputation for excellence [and] fulfilling a commitment to\nprovide educational opportunities to members of all racial\n\f8         FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEX. AT AUSTIN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ngroups,” Grutter, 539 U. S., at 339, it does impose “on the\nuniversity the ultimate burden of demonstrating” that\n“race-neutral alternatives” that are both “available” and\n“workable” “do not suffice.” Fisher I, 570 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 11).\n  Fisher I set forth these controlling principles, while\ntaking no position on the constitutionality of the admis­\nsions program at issue in this case. The Court held only\nthat the District Court and the Court of Appeals had\n“confined the strict scrutiny inquiry in too narrow a way\nby deferring to the University’s good faith in its use of\nracial classifications.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 12) The\nCourt remanded the case, with instructions to evaluate\nthe record under the correct standard and to determine\nwhether the University had made “a showing that its plan\nis narrowly tailored to achieve” the educational benefits\nthat flow from diversity. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13). On\nremand, the Court of Appeals determined that the pro­\ngram conformed with the strict scrutiny mandated by\nFisher I. See 758 F. 3d, at 659–660. Judge Garza\ndissented.\n                            III\n   The University’s program is sui generis. Unlike other\napproaches to college admissions considered by this Court,\nit combines holistic review with a percentage plan. This\napproach gave rise to an unusual consequence in this case:\nThe component of the University’s admissions policy that\nhad the largest impact on petitioner’s chances of admis­\nsion was not the school’s consideration of race under its\nholistic-review process but rather the Top Ten Percent\nPlan. Because petitioner did not graduate in the top 10\npercent of her high school class, she was categorically\nineligible for more than three-fourths of the slots in the\nincoming freshman class. It seems quite plausible, then,\nto think that petitioner would have had a better chance of\n\f                  Cite as: 579 U. S. ____ (2016)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbeing admitted to the University if the school used race-\nconscious holistic review to select its entire incoming class,\nas was the case in Grutter.\n   Despite the Top Ten Percent Plan’s outsized effect on\npetitioner’s chances of admission, she has not challenged\nit. For that reason, throughout this litigation, the Top Ten\nPercent Plan has been taken, somewhat artificially, as a\ngiven premise.\n   Petitioner’s acceptance of the Top Ten Percent Plan\ncomplicates this Court’s review. In particular, it has led to\na record that is almost devoid of information about the\nstudents who secured admission to the University through\nthe Plan. The Court thus cannot know how students\nadmitted solely based on their class rank differ in their\ncontribution to diversity from students admitted through\nholistic review.\n   In an ordinary case, this evidentiary gap perhaps could\nbe filled by a remand to the district court for further fact-\nfinding. When petitioner’s application was rejected, how­\never, the University’s combined percentage-plan/holistic­\nreview approach to admission had been in effect for just\nthree years. While studies undertaken over the eight\nyears since then may be of significant value in determin­\ning the constitutionality of the University’s current admis­\nsions policy, that evidence has little bearing on whether\npetitioner received equal treatment when her application\nwas rejected in 2008. If the Court were to remand, there­\nfore, further factfinding would be limited to a narrow 3­\nyear sample, review of which might yield little insight.\n   Furthermore, as discussed above, the University lacks\nany authority to alter the role of the Top Ten Percent Plan\nin its admissions process. The Plan was mandated by the\nTexas Legislature in the wake of Hopwood, so the Univer­\nsity, like petitioner in this litigation, has likely taken the\nPlan as a given since its implementation in 1998. If the\nUniversity had no reason to think that it could deviate\n\f10       FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEX. AT AUSTIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom the Top Ten Percent Plan, it similarly had no reason\nto keep extensive data on the Plan or the students admit­\nted under it—particularly in the years before Fisher I\nclarified the stringency of the strict-scrutiny burden for a\nschool that employs race-conscious review.\n   Under the circumstances of this case, then, a remand\nwould do nothing more than prolong a suit that has al­\nready persisted for eight years and cost the parties on both\nsides significant resources. Petitioner long since has\ngraduated from another college, and the University’s\npolicy—and the data on which it first was based—may\nhave evolved or changed in material ways.\n   The fact that this case has been litigated on a somewhat\nartificial basis, furthermore, may limit its value for pro­\nspective guidance. The Texas Legislature, in enacting the\nTop Ten Percent Plan, cannot much be criticized, for it\nwas responding to Hopwood, which at the time was bind­\ning law in the State of Texas. That legislative response, in\nturn, circumscribed the University’s discretion in crafting\nits admissions policy. These circumstances refute any\ncriticism that the University did not make good-faith\nefforts to comply with the law.\n   That does not diminish, however, the University’s con­\ntinuing obligation to satisfy the burden of strict scrutiny\nin light of changing circumstances. The University en-\ngages in periodic reassessment of the constitutionality, and\nefficacy, of its admissions program. See Supp. App. 32a;\nApp. 448a. Going forward, that assessment must be un­\ndertaken in light of the experience the school has accumu­\nlated and the data it has gathered since the adoption of its\nadmissions plan.\n   As the University examines this data, it should remain\nmindful that diversity takes many forms. Formalistic\nracial classifications may sometimes fail to capture diver­\nsity in all of its dimensions and, when used in a divisive\nmanner, could undermine the educational benefits the\n\f                  Cite as: 579 U. S. ____ (2016)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nUniversity values. Through regular evaluation of data\nand consideration of student experience, the University\nmust tailor its approach in light of changing circumstances,\nensuring that race plays no greater role than is neces-\nsary to meet its compelling interest. The University’s\nexamination of the data it has acquired in the years since\npetitioner’s application, for these reasons, must proceed\nwith full respect for the constraints imposed by the Equal\nProtection Clause. The type of data collected, and the\nmanner in which it is considered, will have a significant\nbearing on how the University must shape its admissions\npolicy to satisfy strict scrutiny in the years to come. Here,\nhowever, the Court is necessarily limited to the narrow\nquestion before it: whether, drawing all reasonable infer­\nences in her favor, petitioner has shown by a preponder­\nance of the evidence that she was denied equal treatment\nat the time her application was rejected.\n                             IV\n  In seeking to reverse the judgment of the Court of Ap­\npeals, petitioner makes four arguments. First, she argues\nthat the University has not articulated its compelling\ninterest with sufficient clarity. According to petitioner,\nthe University must set forth more precisely the level of\nminority enrollment that would constitute a “critical\nmass.” Without a clearer sense of what the University’s\nultimate goal is, petitioner argues, a reviewing court\ncannot assess whether the University’s admissions pro­\ngram is narrowly tailored to that goal.\n  As this Court’s cases have made clear, however, the\ncompelling interest that justifies consideration of race in\ncollege admissions is not an interest in enrolling a certain\nnumber of minority students. Rather, a university may\ninstitute a race-conscious admissions program as a means\nof obtaining “the educational benefits that flow from stu­\ndent body diversity.” Fisher I, 570 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n\f12        FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEX. AT AUSTIN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n9) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Grutter,\n539 U. S., at 328. As this Court has said, enrolling a\ndiverse student body “promotes cross-racial understand­\ning, helps to break down racial stereotypes, and enables\nstudents to better understand persons of different races.”\nId., at 330 (internal quotation marks and alteration omit­\nted). Equally important, “student body diversity promotes\nlearning outcomes, and better prepares students for an\nincreasingly diverse workforce and society.” Ibid. (inter­\nnal quotation marks omitted).\n   Increasing minority enrollment may be instrumental to\nthese educational benefits, but it is not, as petitioner\nseems to suggest, a goal that can or should be reduced to\npure numbers. Indeed, since the University is prohibited\nfrom seeking a particular number or quota of minority\nstudents, it cannot be faulted for failing to specify the\nparticular level of minority enrollment at which it believes\nthe educational benefits of diversity will be obtained.\n   On the other hand, asserting an interest in the educa­\ntional benefits of diversity writ large is insufficient. A\nuniversity’s goals cannot be elusory or amorphous—they\nmust be sufficiently measurable to permit judicial scrutiny\nof the policies adopted to reach them.\n   The record reveals that in first setting forth its current\nadmissions policy, the University articulated concrete and\nprecise goals. On the first page of its 2004 “Proposal to\nConsider Race and Ethnicity in Admissions,” the Univer-\nsity identifies the educational values it seeks to realize\nthrough its admissions process: the destruction of stereo­\ntypes, the “ ‘promot[ion of] cross-racial understanding,’ ”\nthe preparation of a student body “ ‘for an increasingly\ndiverse workforce and society,’ ” and the “ ‘cultivat[ion of] a\nset of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry.’ ”\nSupp. App. 1a; see also id., at 69a; App. 314a–315a (depo­\nsition of N. Bruce Walker (Walker Dep.)), 478a–479a\n(Walker Aff. ¶4) (setting forth the same goals). Later in\n\f                 Cite as: 579 U. S. ____ (2016)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe proposal, the University explains that it strives to\nprovide an “academic environment” that offers a “robust\nexchange of ideas, exposure to differing cultures, prepara­\ntion for the challenges of an increasingly diverse work­\nforce, and acquisition of competencies required of future\nleaders.” Supp. App. 23a. All of these objectives, as a\ngeneral matter, mirror the “compelling interest” this Court\nhas approved in its prior cases.\n   The University has provided in addition a “reasoned,\nprincipled explanation” for its decision to pursue these\ngoals. Fisher I, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 9). The Univer-\nsity’s 39-page proposal was written following a year-long\nstudy, which concluded that “[t]he use of race-neutral\npolicies and programs ha[d] not been successful” in\n“provid[ing] an educational setting that fosters cross-racial\nunderstanding, provid[ing] enlightened discussion and\nlearning, [or] prepar[ing] students to function in an in­\ncreasingly diverse workforce and society.” Supp. App. 25a;\nsee also App. 481a–482a (Walker Aff. ¶¶8–12) (describing\nthe “thoughtful review” the University undertook when it\nfaced the “important decision . . . whether or not to use\nrace in its admissions process”). Further support for the\nUniversity’s conclusion can be found in the depositions\nand affidavits from various admissions officers, all of\nwhom articulate the same, consistent “reasoned, princi­\npled explanation.” See, e.g., id., at 253a (Ishop Dep.),\n314a–318a, 359a (Walker Dep.), 415a–416a (Defendant’s\nStatement of Facts), 478a–479a, 481a–482a (Walker Aff.\n¶¶4, 10–13). Petitioner’s contention that the University’s\ngoal was insufficiently concrete is rebutted by the record.\n   Second, petitioner argues that the University has no\nneed to consider race because it had already “achieved\ncritical mass” by 2003 using the Top Ten Percent Plan and\nrace-neutral holistic review. Brief for Petitioner 46.\nPetitioner is correct that a university bears a heavy bur­\nden in showing that it had not obtained the educational\n\f14        FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEX. AT AUSTIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbenefits of diversity before it turned to a race-conscious\nplan. The record reveals, however, that, at the time of\npetitioner’s application, the University could not be faulted\non this score. Before changing its policy the University\nconducted “months of study and deliberation, including\nretreats, interviews, [and] review of data,” App. 446a, and\nconcluded that “[t]he use of race-neutral policies and\nprograms ha[d] not been successful in achieving” sufficient\nracial diversity at the University, Supp. App. 25a. At no\nstage in this litigation has petitioner challenged the Uni­\nversity’s good faith in conducting its studies, and the\nCourt properly declines to consider the extrarecord mate­\nrials the dissent relies upon, many of which are tangential\nto this case at best and none of which the University has\nhad a full opportunity to respond to. See, e.g., post, at 45–\n46 (opinion of ALITO, J.) (describing a 2015 report regard­\ning the admission of applicants who are related to ‘‘politi­\ncally connected individuals’’).\n   The record itself contains significant evidence, both\nstatistical and anecdotal, in support of the University’s\nposition. To start, the demographic data the University\nhas submitted show consistent stagnation in terms of the\npercentage of minority students enrolling at the Univer-\nsity from 1996 to 2002. In 1996, for example, 266 African-\nAmerican freshmen enrolled, a total that constituted 4.1\npercent of the incoming class. In 2003, the year Grutter\nwas decided, 267 African-American students enrolled—\nagain, 4.1 percent of the incoming class. The numbers for\nHispanic and Asian-American students tell a similar\nstory. See Supp. App. 43a. Although demographics alone\nare by no means dispositive, they do have some value as a\ngauge of the University’s ability to enroll students who can\noffer underrepresented perspectives.\n   In addition to this broad demographic data, the Univer­\nsity put forward evidence that minority students admitted\nunder the Hopwood regime experienced feelings of loneli­\n\f                 Cite as: 579 U. S. ____ (2016)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nness and isolation. See, e.g., App. 317a–318a.\n   This anecdotal evidence is, in turn, bolstered by further,\nmore nuanced quantitative data. In 2002, 52 percent of\nundergraduate classes with at least five students had no\nAfrican-American students enrolled in them, and 27 per­\ncent had only one African-American student. Supp. App.\n140a. In other words, only 21 percent of undergraduate\nclasses with five or more students in them had more than\none African-American student enrolled. Twelve percent of\nthese classes had no Hispanic students, as compared to 10\npercent in 1996. Id., at 74a, 140a. Though a college must\ncontinually reassess its need for race-conscious review,\nhere that assessment appears to have been done with care,\nand a reasonable determination was made that the Uni­\nversity had not yet attained its goals.\n   Third, petitioner argues that considering race was not\nnecessary because such consideration has had only a\n“ ‘minimal impact’ in advancing the [University’s] compel­\nling interest.” Brief for Petitioner 46; see also Tr. of Oral\nArg. 23:10–12; 24:13–25:2, 25:24–26:3. Again, the record\ndoes not support this assertion. In 2003, 11 percent of the\nTexas residents enrolled through holistic review were\nHispanic and 3.5 percent were African-American. Supp.\nApp. 157a. In 2007, by contrast, 16.9 percent of the Texas\nholistic-review freshmen were Hispanic and 6.8 percent\nwere African-American. Ibid. Those increases—of 54\npercent and 94 percent, respectively—show that consider­\nation of race has had a meaningful, if still limited, effect\non the diversity of the University’s freshman class.\n   In any event, it is not a failure of narrow tailoring for\nthe impact of racial consideration to be minor. The fact\nthat race consciousness played a role in only a small por­\ntion of admissions decisions should be a hallmark of nar­\nrow tailoring, not evidence of unconstitutionality.\n   Petitioner’s final argument is that “there are numerous\nother available race-neutral means of achieving” the Uni­\n\f16       FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEX. AT AUSTIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nversity’s compelling interest. Brief for Petitioner 47. A\nreview of the record reveals, however, that, at the time of\npetitioner’s application, none of her proposed alternatives\nwas a workable means for the University to attain the\nbenefits of diversity it sought. For example, petitioner\nsuggests that the University could intensify its outreach\nefforts to African-American and Hispanic applicants. But\nthe University submitted extensive evidence of the many\nways in which it already had intensified its outreach\nefforts to those students. The University has created\nthree new scholarship programs, opened new regional\nadmissions centers, increased its recruitment budget by\nhalf-a-million dollars, and organized over 1,000 recruit­\nment events. Supp. App. 29a–32a; App. 450a–452a (citing\naffidavit of Michael Orr ¶¶4–20). Perhaps more signifi­\ncantly, in the wake of Hopwood, the University spent\nseven years attempting to achieve its compelling interest\nusing race-neutral holistic review. None of these efforts\nsucceeded, and petitioner fails to offer any meaningful way\nin which the University could have improved upon them at\nthe time of her application.\n  Petitioner also suggests altering the weight given to\nacademic and socioeconomic factors in the University’s\nadmissions calculus. This proposal ignores the fact that\nthe University tried, and failed, to increase diversity\nthrough enhanced consideration of socioeconomic and\nother factors. And it further ignores this Court’s prece­\ndent making clear that the Equal Protection Clause does\nnot force universities to choose between a diverse student\nbody and a reputation for academic excellence. Grutter,\n539 U. S., at 339.\n  Petitioner’s final suggestion is to uncap the Top Ten\nPercent Plan, and admit more—if not all—the University’s\nstudents through a percentage plan. As an initial matter,\npetitioner overlooks the fact that the Top Ten Percent\nPlan, though facially neutral, cannot be understood apart\n\f                 Cite as: 579 U. S. ____ (2016)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom its basic purpose, which is to boost minority enroll­\nment. Percentage plans are “adopted with racially segre­\ngated neighborhoods and schools front and center stage.”\nFisher I, 570 U. S., at ___ (GINSBURG, J., dissenting) (slip\nop., at 2). “It is race consciousness, not blindness to race,\nthat drives such plans.” Ibid. Consequently, petitioner\ncannot assert simply that increasing the University’s\nreliance on a percentage plan would make its admissions\npolicy more race neutral.\n  Even if, as a matter of raw numbers, minority enroll­\nment would increase under such a regime, petitioner\nwould be hard-pressed to find convincing support for the\nproposition that college admissions would be improved if\nthey were a function of class rank alone. That approach\nwould sacrifice all other aspects of diversity in pursuit of\nenrolling a higher number of minority students. A system\nthat selected every student through class rank alone\nwould exclude the star athlete or musician whose grades\nsuffered because of daily practices and training. It would\nexclude a talented young biologist who struggled to main­\ntain above-average grades in humanities classes. And it\nwould exclude a student whose freshman-year grades were\npoor because of a family crisis but who got herself back on\ntrack in her last three years of school, only to find herself\njust outside of the top decile of her class.\n  These are but examples of the general problem. Class\nrank is a single metric, and like any single metric, it will\ncapture certain types of people and miss others. This does\nnot imply that students admitted through holistic review\nare necessarily more capable or more desirable than those\nadmitted through the Top Ten Percent Plan. It merely\nreflects the fact that privileging one characteristic above\nall others does not lead to a diverse student body. Indeed,\nto compel universities to admit students based on class\nrank alone is in deep tension with the goal of educational\ndiversity as this Court’s cases have defined it. See Grut-\n\f18        FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEX. AT AUSTIN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nter, supra, at 340 (explaining that percentage plans “may\npreclude the university from conducting the individualized\nassessments necessary to assemble a student body that is\nnot just racially diverse, but diverse along all the qualities\nvalued by the university”); 758 F. 3d, at 653 (pointing out\nthat the Top Ten Percent Law leaves out students “who\nfell outside their high school’s top ten percent but excelled\nin unique ways that would enrich the diversity of [the\nUniversity’s] educational experience” and “leaves a gap in\nan admissions process seeking to create the multi­\ndimensional diversity that [Regents of Univ. of Cal. v.\nBakke, 438 U. S. 265 (1978),] envisions”). At its center,\nthe Top Ten Percent Plan is a blunt instrument that may\nwell compromise the University’s own definition of the\ndiversity it seeks.\n   In addition to these fundamental problems, an admis­\nsions policy that relies exclusively on class rank creates\nperverse incentives for applicants.        Percentage plans\n“encourage parents to keep their children in low-\nperforming segregated schools, and discourage students\nfrom taking challenging classes that might lower their\ngrade point averages.” Gratz, 539 U. S., at 304, n. 10\n(GINSBURG, J., dissenting).\n   For all these reasons, although it may be true that the\nTop Ten Percent Plan in some instances may provide a\npath out of poverty for those who excel at schools lacking\nin resources, the Plan cannot serve as the admissions\nsolution that petitioner suggests. Wherever the balance\nbetween percentage plans and holistic review should rest,\nan effective admissions policy cannot prescribe, realisti­\ncally, the exclusive use of a percentage plan.\n   In short, none of petitioner’s suggested alternatives—\nnor other proposals considered or discussed in the course\nof this litigation—have been shown to be “available” and\n“workable” means through which the University could\nhave met its educational goals, as it understood and de­\n\f                  Cite as: 579 U.

Fisher I, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 11).\nThe University has thus met its burden of showing that\nthe admissions policy it used at the time it rejected peti­\ntioner’s application was narrowly tailored.\n                         *     *     *\n   A university is in large part defined by those intangible\n“qualities which are incapable of objective measurement\nbut which make for greatness.” Sweatt v. Painter, 339\nU. S. 629, 634 (1950). Considerable deference is owed to a\nuniversity in defining those intangible characteristics, like\nstudent body diversity, that are central to its identity and\neducational mission. But still, it remains an enduring\nchallenge to our Nation’s education system to reconcile the\npursuit of diversity with the constitutional promise of\nequal treatment and dignity.\n   In striking this sensitive balance, public universities,\nlike the States themselves, can serve as “laboratories for\nexperimentation.” United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549,\n581 (1995) (KENNEDY, J., concurring); see also New State\nIce Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U. S. 262, 311 (1932) (Brandeis,\nJ., dissenting). The University of Texas at Austin has a\nspecial opportunity to learn and to teach. The University\nnow has at its disposal valuable data about the manner in\nwhich different approaches to admissions may foster\ndiversity or instead dilute it. The University must con-\ntinue to use this data to scrutinize the fairness of its admis­\nsions program; to assess whether changing demographics\nhave undermined the need for a race-conscious policy; and\nto identify the effects, both positive and negative, of the\naffirmative-action measures it deems necessary.\n   The Court’s affirmance of the University’s admissions\npolicy today does not necessarily mean the University may\nrely on that same policy without refinement.

Rejecting the argument that we\nshould defer to UT’s judgment on those matters, we made\nit clear that UT was obligated (1) to identify the interests\njustifying its plan with enough specificity to permit a\nreviewing court to determine whether the requirements of\nstrict scrutiny were met, and (2) to show that those re­\nquirements were in fact satisfied. On remand, UT failed\nto do what our prior decision demanded. The University\nhas still not identified with any degree of specificity the\ninterests that its use of race and ethnicity is supposed to\nserve. Its primary argument is that merely invoking “the\neducational benefits of diversity” is sufficient and that it\nneed not identify any metric that would allow a court to\ndetermine whether its plan is needed to serve, or is actually\nserving, those interests. This is nothing less than the\nplea for deference that we emphatically rejected in our\n\f2         FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEX. AT AUSTIN\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nprior decision. Today, however, the Court inexplicably\ngrants that request.\n   To the extent that UT has ever moved beyond a plea for\ndeference and identified the relevant interests in more\nspecific terms, its efforts have been shifting, unpersuasive,\nand, at times, less than candid. When it adopted its race-\nbased plan, UT said that the plan was needed to promote\nclassroom diversity. See Supp. App. 1a, 24a–25a, 39a;\nApp. 316a. It pointed to a study showing that African-\nAmerican, Hispanic, and Asian-American students were\nunderrepresented in many classes. See Supp. App. 26a.\nBut UT has never shown that its race-conscious plan\nactually ameliorates this situation. The University pre­\nsents no evidence that its admissions officers, in adminis­\ntering the “holistic” component of its plan, make any effort\nto determine whether an African-American, Hispanic, or\nAsian-American student is likely to enroll in classes in\nwhich minority students are underrepresented.           And\nalthough UT’s records should permit it to determine with­\nout much difficulty whether holistic admittees are any\nmore likely than students admitted through the Top Ten\nPercent Law, Tex. Educ. Code Ann. §51.803 (West Cum.\nSupp. 2015), to enroll in the classes lacking racial or eth­\nnic diversity, UT either has not crunched those numbers\nor has not revealed what they show. Nor has UT ex­\nplained why the underrepresentation of Asian-American\nstudents in many classes justifies its plan, which discrim­\ninates against those students.\n   At times, UT has claimed that its plan is needed to\nachieve a “critical mass” of African-American and His­\npanic students, but it has never explained what this term\nmeans. According to UT, a critical mass is neither some\nabsolute number of African-American or Hispanic stu­\ndents nor the percentage of African-Americans or Hispan­\nics in the general population of the State. The term re­\nmains undefined, but UT tells us that it will let the courts\n\f                  Cite as: 579 U. S. ____ (2016)            3\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nknow when the desired end has been achieved. See App.\n314a–315a. This is a plea for deference—indeed, for blind\ndeference—the very thing that the Court rejected in\nFisher I.\n   UT has also claimed at times that the race-based com­\nponent of its plan is needed because the Top Ten Percent\nPlan admits the wrong kind of African-American and\nHispanic students, namely, students from poor families\nwho attend schools in which the student body is predomi­\nnantly African-American or Hispanic. As UT put it in its\nbrief in Fisher I, the race-based component of its admis­\nsions plan is needed to admit “[t]he African-American or\nHispanic child of successful professionals in Dallas.” Brief\nfor Respondents, O. T. 2012, No. 11–345, p. 34.\n   After making this argument in its first trip to this\nCourt, UT apparently had second thoughts, and in the\nlatest round of briefing UT has attempted to disavow ever\nhaving made the argument. See Brief for Respondents 2\n(“Petitioner’s argument that UT’s interest is favoring\n‘affluent’ minorities is a fabrication”); see also id., at 15.\nBut it did, and the argument turns affirmative action on\nits head. Affirmative-action programs were created to\nhelp disadvantaged students.\n   Although UT now disowns the argument that the Top\nTen Percent Plan results in the admission of the wrong\nkind of African-American and Hispanic students, the Fifth\nCircuit majority bought a version of that claim. As the\npanel majority put it, the Top Ten African-American and\nHispanic admittees cannot match the holistic African-\nAmerican and Hispanic admittees when it comes to “rec­\nords of personal achievement,” a “variety of perspectives”\nand “life experiences,” and “unique skills.” 758 F. 3d 633,\n653 (2014). All in all, according to the panel majority, the\nTop Ten Percent students cannot “enrich the diversity of\nthe student body” in the same way as the holistic admit-\ntees. Id., at 654. As Judge Garza put it in dissent, the\n\f4          FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEX. AT AUSTIN\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\npanel majority concluded that the Top Ten Percent admit-\ntees are “somehow more homogenous, less dynamic, and\nmore undesirably stereotypical than those admitted under\nholistic review.” Id., at 669–670 (Garza, J., dissenting).\n   The Fifth Circuit reached this conclusion with little\ndirect evidence regarding the characteristics of the Top\nTen Percent and holistic admittees. Instead, the assump­\ntion behind the Fifth Circuit’s reasoning is that most of\nthe African-American and Hispanic students admitted\nunder the race-neutral component of UT’s plan were able\nto rank in the top decile of their high school classes only\nbecause they did not have to compete against white and\nAsian-American students. This insulting stereotype is not\nsupported by the record. African-American and Hispanic\nstudents admitted under the Top Ten Percent Plan receive\nhigher college grades than the African-American and\nHispanic students admitted under the race-conscious\nprogram. See Supp. App. 164a–165a.\n   It should not have been necessary for us to grant review\na second time in this case, and I have no greater desire\nthan the majority to see the case drag on. But that need\nnot happen. When UT decided to adopt its race-conscious\nplan, it had every reason to know that its plan would have\nto satisfy strict scrutiny and that this meant that it would\nbe its burden to show that the plan was narrowly tailored\nto serve compelling interests. UT has failed to make that\nshowing. By all rights, judgment should be entered in\nfavor of petitioner.\n   But if the majority is determined to give UT yet another\nchance, we should reverse and send this case back to the\nDistrict Court.      What the majority has now done—\nawarding a victory to UT in an opinion that fails to ad­\ndress the important issues in the case—is simply wrong.\n                             I\n    Over the past 20 years, UT has frequently modified its\n\f                 Cite as: 579 U.

Admissions were based on two criteria:\n(1) the applicant’s Academic Index (AI), which was com­\nputed from standardized test scores and high school class\nrank, and (2) the applicant’s race. In 1996, the last year\nthis race-conscious system was in place, 4.1% of enrolled\nfreshmen were African-American, 14.7% were Asian-\nAmerican, and 14.5% were Hispanic. Supp. App. 43a.\n  The Fifth Circuit’s decision in Hopwood v. Texas, 78\nF. 3d 932 (1996), prohibited UT from using race in admis­\nsions. In response to Hopwood, beginning with the 1997\nadmissions cycle, UT instituted a “holistic review” process\nin which it considered an applicant’s AI as well as a Per­\nsonal Achievement Index (PAI) that was intended, among\nother things, to increase minority enrollment. The race-\nneutral PAI was a composite of scores from two essays and\na personal achievement score, which in turn was based on\na holistic review of an applicant’s leadership qualities,\nextracurricular activities, honors and awards, work expe­\nrience, community service, and special circumstances.\nSpecial consideration was given to applicants from poor\nfamilies, applicants from homes in which a language other\nthan English was customarily spoken, and applicants from\nsingle-parent households. Because this race-neutral plan\ngave a preference to disadvantaged students, it had the\neffect of “disproportionately” benefiting minority candi­\ndates. 645 F. Supp. 2d 587, 592 (WD Tex. 2009).\n  The Texas Legislature also responded to Hopwood. In\n1997, it enacted the Top Ten Percent Plan, which man­\ndated that UT admit all Texas seniors who rank in the top\n10% of their high school classes. This facially race-neutral\nlaw served to equalize competition between students who\n\f6         FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEX. AT AUSTIN\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nlive in relatively affluent areas with superior schools and\nstudents in poorer areas served by schools offering fewer\nopportunities for academic excellence. And by benefiting\nthe students in the latter group, this plan, like the race-\nneutral holistic plan already adopted by UT, tended to\nbenefit African-American and Hispanic students, who are\noften trapped in inferior public schools. 758 F. 3d, at 650–\n653.\n   Starting in 1998, when the Top Ten Percent Plan took\neffect, UT’s holistic, race-neutral AI/PAI system continued\nto be used to fill the seats in the entering class that were\nnot taken by Top Ten Percent students. The AI/PAI sys­\ntem was also used to determine program placement for\nall incoming students, including the Top Ten Percent\nstudents.\n   “The University’s revised admissions process, coupled\nwith the operation of the Top Ten Percent Law, resulted in\na more racially diverse environment at the University.”\nFisher I, 570 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3). In 2000, UT\nannounced that its “enrollment levels for African Ameri­\ncan and Hispanic freshmen have returned to those of\n1996, the year before the Hopwood decision prohibited the\nconsideration of race in admissions policies.” App. 393a;\nsee also Supp. App. 23a–24a (pre-Hopwood diversity levels\nwere “restored” in 1999); App. 392a–393a (“The ‘Top 10\nPercent Law’ is Working for Texas” and “has enabled us to\ndiversify enrollment at UT Austin with talented students\nwho succeed”). And in 2003, UT proclaimed that it had\n“effectively compensated for the loss of affirmative action.”\nId., at 396a; see also id., at 398a (“Diversity efforts at The\nUniversity of Texas at Austin have brought a higher num­\nber of freshman minority students—African Americans,\nHispanics and Asian-Americans—to the campus than\nwere enrolled in 1996, the year a court ruling ended the\nuse of affirmative action in the university’s enrollment\nprocess”).

Supp. App. 156a. The 2004 entering class thus\nhad a higher percentage of African-Americans, Asian-\nAmericans, and Hispanics than the class that entered in\n1996, when UT had last employed racial preferences.\n  Notwithstanding these lauded results, UT leapt at the\nopportunity to reinsert race into the process. On June 23,\n2003, this Court decided Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U. S.\n306 (2003), which upheld the University of Michigan Law\nSchool’s race-conscious admissions system. In Grutter, the\nCourt warned that a university contemplating the consid­\neration of race as part of its admissions process must\nengage in “serious, good faith consideration of workable\nrace-neutral alternatives that will achieve the diversity\nthe university seeks.” Id., at 339. Nevertheless, on the\nvery day Grutter was handed down, UT’s president an­\nnounced that “[t]he University of Texas at Austin will\nmodify its admissions procedures” in light of Grutter,\nincluding by “implementing procedures at the undergrad­\nuate level that combine the benefits of the Top 10 Percent\nLaw with affirmative action programs.” App. 406a–407a\n(emphasis added).1 UT purports to have later engaged in\n——————\n  1 See also Nissimov, UT To Resume Factoring in Applicants’ Race: UT\nTo Reintroduce Race-Based Criteria, Houston Chronicle, June 24, 2003,\np. 4A (“President Larry Faulkner said Monday his institution will\nquickly develop race-based admissions criteria by the fall that would be\nused for the summer and fall of 2004, after being given the green light\nto do so by Monday’s U.

UT decided to use racial prefer­\nences to benefit African-American and Hispanic students\nbecause it considers those groups “underrepresented\nminorities.” Supp. App. 25a; see also App. 445a–446a\n(defining “underrepresented minorities” as “Hispanic[s]\nand African Americans”). Even though UT’s classroom\nstudy showed that more classes lacked Asian-American\nstudents than lacked Hispanic students, Supp. App. 26a,\nUT deemed Asian-Americans “overrepresented” based on\nstate demographics, 645 F. Supp. 2d, at 606; see also ibid.\n(“It is undisputed that UT considers African-Americans\nand Hispanics to be underrepresented but does not con­\nsider Asian-Americans to be underrepresented”).\n   Although UT claims that race is but a “factor of a factor\nof a factor of a factor,” id., at 608, UT acknowledges that\n“race is the only one of [its] holistic factors that appears on\nthe cover of every application,” Tr. of Oral Arg. 54 (Oct. 10,\n2012). “Because an applicant’s race is identified at the\nfront of the admissions file, reviewers are aware of it\nthroughout the evaluation.” 645 F. Supp. 2d, at 597; see\nalso id., at 598 (“[A] candidate’s race is known throughout\nthe application process”). Consideration of race therefore\npervades every aspect of UT’s admissions process. See\nApp. 219a (“We are certainly aware of the applicant’s race.\nIt’s on the front page of the application that’s being read\n[and] is used in context with everything else that’s part of\nthe applicant’s file”).

According to UT, it has no way of making these\ndeterminations. See id., at 320a–322a. UT says that it\ndoes not tell its admissions officers how much weight to\ngive to race. See Deposition of Gary Lavergne 43–45,\nRecord in No. 1:08–CV–00263 (WD Tex.), Doc. 94–9\n(Lavergne Deposition). And because the influence of race\nis always “contextual,” UT claims, it cannot provide even a\nsingle example of an instance in which race impacted a\nstudent’s odds of admission. See App. 220a (“Q. Could you\ngive me an example where race would have some impact\non an applicant’s personal achievement score? A. To be\nhonest, not really . . . . [I]t’s impossible to say—to give you\nan example of a particular student because it’s all context-\nual”). Accordingly, UT asserts that it has no idea which\nstudents were admitted as a result of its race-conscious\nsystem and which students would have been admitted\nunder a race-neutral process. UT thus makes no effort to\nassess how the individual characteristics of students\nadmitted as the result of racial preferences differ (or do\nnot differ) from those of students who would have been\nadmitted without them.\n\f                 Cite as: 579 U.

UT therefore cannot satisfy strict scrutiny.\n   The majority acknowledges that “asserting an interest\nin the educational benefits of diversity writ large is insuf­\nficient,” and that “[a] university’s goals cannot be elusory\nor amorphous—they must be sufficiently measurable to\npermit judicial scrutiny of the policies adopted to reach\nthem.” Ante, at 12. According to the majority, however,\nUT has articulated the following “concrete and precise\ngoals”: “the destruction of stereotypes, the promot[ion of ]\ncross-racial understanding, the preparation of a student\nbody for an increasingly diverse workforce and society,\nand the cultivat[ion of] a set of leaders with legitimacy in\nthe eyes of the citizenry.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   These are laudable goals, but they are not concrete or\nprecise, and they offer no limiting principle for the use of\nracial preferences. For instance, how will a court ever be\nable to determine whether stereotypes have been ade­\nquately destroyed? Or whether cross-racial understanding\nhas been adequately achieved? If a university can justify\nracial discrimination simply by having a few employees\nopine that racial preferences are necessary to accomplish\nthese nebulous goals, see ante, at 12–13 (citing only self-\nserving statements from UT officials), then the narrow\ntailoring inquiry is meaningless.

And UT’s arguments to the contrary de­\npend on a series of invidious assumptions.\n                               1\n   First, both UT and the majority cite demographic data\nas evidence that African-American and Hispanic students\nare “underrepresented” at UT and that racial preferences\nare necessary to compensate for this underrepresentation.\nSee, e.g., Supp. App. 24a; ante, at 14. But neither UT nor\nthe majority is clear about the relationship between Texas\ndemographics and UT’s interest in obtaining a critical\nmass.\n   Does critical mass depend on the relative size of a\nparticular group in the population of a State? For exam­\nple, is the critical mass of African-Americans and Hispan­\nics in Texas, where African-Americans are about 11.8%\nof the population and Hispanics are about 37.6%, different\nfrom the critical mass in neighboring New Mexico, where\nthe African-American population is much smaller (about\n2.1%) and the Hispanic population constitutes a higher\npercentage of the State’s total (about 46.3%)?

UT’s extensive\nreliance on state demographics is also revealed by its\nsubstantial focus on increasing the representation of\nHispanics, but not Asian-Americans, see, e.g., 645 F. Supp.\n2d, at 606; Supp. App. 25a; App. 445a–446a, because\nHispanics, but not Asian-Americans, are underrepre-\nsented at UT when compared to the demographics of the\nState.2\n  On the other hand, UT’s counsel asserted that the criti­\ncal mass for the University is “not at all” dependent on the\ndemographics of Texas, and that UT’s “concept [of] critical\nmass isn’t tied to demographic[s].” Tr. of Oral Arg. 40, 49\n(Oct. 10, 2012).

Although UT claims an interest in the\neducational benefits of diversity, it appears to have paid\nlittle attention to anything other than the number of\nminority students on its campus and in its classrooms.\nUT’s 2004 Proposal illustrates this approach by repeatedly\nciting numerical assessments of the racial makeup of the\nstudent body and various classes as the justification for\nadopting a race-conscious plan. See, e.g., Supp. App. 24a–\n26a, 30a. Instead of focusing on the benefits of diversity,\n\f20        FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEX. AT AUSTIN\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nUT seems to have resorted to a simple racial census.\n   The majority, for its part, claims that “[a]lthough de­\nmographics alone are by no means dispositive, they do\nhave some value as a gauge of the University’s ability to\nenroll students who can offer underrepresented perspec­\ntives.” Ante, at 14. But even if UT merely “view[s] the\ndemographic disparity as cause for concern,” Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 29, and is seeking only to\nreduce—rather than eliminate—the disparity, that unde­\nfined goal cannot be properly subjected to strict scrutiny.\nIn that case, there is simply no way for a court to know\nwhat specific demographic interest UT is pursuing, why a\nrace-neutral alternative could not achieve that interest,\nand when that demographic goal would be satisfied. If a\ndemographic discrepancy can serve as “a gauge” that\njustifies the use of racial discrimination, ante, at 14, then\nracial discrimination can be justified on that basis until\ndemographic parity is reached. There is no logical stop­\nping point short of patently unconstitutional racial balanc­\ning. Demographic disparities thus cannot be used to\nsatisfy strict scrutiny here. See Croson, supra, at 498\n(rejecting a municipality’s assertion that its racial set-\naside program was justified in light of past discrimination\nbecause that assertion had “ ‘no logical stopping point’ ”\nand could continue until the percentage of government\ncontracts awarded to minorities “mirrored the percentage\nof minorities in the population as a whole”); Wygant v.\nJackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U.

The Pro­\nposal stressed that UT “has not reached a critical mass at\nthe classroom level.” Supp. App. 24a (emphasis added);\n\f                     Cite as: 579 U.

In support of this\nproposition, UT relied on a study of select classes contain­\ning five or more students. As noted above, the study\nindicated that 52% of these classes had no African-\nAmericans, 16% had no Asian-Americans, and 12% had no\nHispanics. Supp. App. 26a. The study further suggested\nthat only 21% of these classes had two or more African-\nAmericans, 67% had two or more Asian-Americans, and\n70% had two or more Hispanics. See ibid. Based on this\nstudy, UT concluded that it had a “compelling educational\ninterest” in employing racial preferences to ensure that it\ndid not “have large numbers of classes in which there are\nno students—or only a single student—of a given un­\nderrepresented race or ethnicity.” Id., at 25a.\n  UT now equivocates, disclaiming any discrete interest in\nclassroom diversity. See Brief for Respondents 26–27.\nInstead, UT has taken the position that the lack of class­\nroom diversity was merely a “red flag that UT had not yet\nfully realized” “the constitutionally permissible education­\nal benefits of diversity.” Brief for Respondents in No. 11–\n345, at 43. But UT has failed to identify the level of class­\nroom diversity it deems sufficient, again making it im-\npossible to apply strict scrutiny.3 A reviewing court can­\nnot determine whether UT’s race-conscious program\nwas necessary to remove the so-called “red flag” without\nunderstanding the precise nature of that goal or know-\ning when the “red flag” will be considered to have\ndisappeared.\n  Putting aside UT’s effective abandonment of its interest\nin classroom diversity, the evidence cited in support of\nthat interest is woefully insufficient to show that UT’s\n\n——————\n  3 IfUT’s goal is to have at least two African-Americans, two Hispan­\nics, and two Asian-Americans present in each of the relevant class­\nrooms, that goal is literally unreachable in classes of five and practi-\ncally unreachable in many other small classes.\n\f22         FISHER v.

As far as the\nrecord shows, UT failed to even scratch the surface of the\navailable data before reflexively resorting to racial prefer­\nences. For instance, because UT knows which students\nwere admitted through the Top Ten Percent Plan and\nwhich were not, as well as which students enrolled in\nwhich classes, it would seem relatively easy to determine\nwhether Top Ten Percent students were more or less likely\nthan holistic admittees to enroll in the types of classes\nwhere diversity was lacking. But UT never bothered to\nfigure this out. See ante, at 9 (acknowledging that UT\nsubmitted no evidence regarding “how students admitted\nsolely based on their class rank differ in their contribution\nto diversity from students admitted through holistic re­\nview”). Nor is there any indication that UT instructed\nadmissions officers to search for African-American and\nHispanic applicants who would fill particular gaps at the\nclassroom level. Given UT’s failure to present such evi­\ndence, it has not demonstrated that its race-conscious\npolicy would promote classroom diversity any better than\nrace-neutral options, such as expanding the Top Ten\nPercent Plan or using race-neutral holistic admissions.\n   Moreover, if UT is truly seeking to expose its students to\na diversity of ideas and perspectives, its policy is poorly\ntailored to serve that end. UT’s own study—which the\nmajority touts as the best “nuanced quantitative data”\nsupporting UT’s position, ante, at 15—demonstrated that\nclassroom diversity was more lacking for students classi­\nfied as Asian-American than for those classified as His­\npanic.

And unless\nthe University is engaged in unconstitutional racial bal­\nancing based on Texas demographics (where Hispanics\noutnumber Asian-Americans), see Part II–C–1, supra, it\nseemingly views the classroom contributions of Asian-\nAmerican students as less valuable than those of Hispanic\nstudents. In UT’s view, apparently, “Asian Americans are\nnot worth as much as Hispanics in promoting ‘cross-racial\nunderstanding,’ breaking down ‘racial stereotypes,’ and\nenabling students to ‘better understand persons of differ­\nent races.’ ” Brief for Asian American Legal Foundation\net al. as Amici Curiae 11 (representing 117 Asian-\nAmerican organizations). The majority opinion effectively\nendorses this view, crediting UT’s reliance on the class­\nroom study as proof that the University assessed its need\nfor racial discrimination (including racial discrimination\nthat undeniably harms Asian-Americans) “with care.”\nAnte, at 15.\n  While both the majority and the Fifth Circuit rely on\nUT’s classroom study, see ante, at 15; 758 F. 3d, at 658–\n659, they completely ignore its finding that Hispanics are\nbetter represented than Asian-Americans in UT class­\nrooms. In fact, they act almost as if Asian-American\nstudents do not exist.

In making this\nargument, the court below failed to mention Asian-Americans. The\nreason for this omission is obvious: As indicated in the very sources that\nthe Fifth Circuit relied on for this point, on the very pages it cited,\nAsian-American enrollees admitted to UT through holistic review have\nconsistently higher average SAT scores than white enrollees admitted\nthrough holistic review.

So why has UT lumped them to­\ngether and concluded that it is appropriate to discriminate\nagainst Asian-American students because they are\n“overrepresented” in the UT student body? UT has no\ngood answer. And UT makes no effort to ensure that it\nhas a critical mass of, say, “Filipino Americans” or “Cam­\nbodian Americans.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 52 (Oct. 10, 2012). As\nlong as there are a sufficient number of “Asian Ameri­\ncans,” UT is apparently satisfied.\n   UT’s failure to provide any definition of the various\nracial and ethnic groups is also revealing. UT does not\nspecify what it means to be “African-American,” “His-\npanic,” “Asian American,” “Native American,” or “White.”\nSupp. App. 30a. And UT evidently labels each student as\nfalling into only a single racial or ethnic group, see, e.g.,\nid., at 10a–13a, 30a, 43a–44a, 71a, 156a–157a, 169a–170a,\nwithout explaining how individuals with ancestors from\ndifferent groups are to be characterized. As racial and\nethnic prejudice recedes, more and more students will\nhave parents (or grandparents) who fall into more than\none of UT’s five groups.

UT\nassumes that if an applicant describes himself or herself\nas a member of a particular race or ethnicity, that appli­\ncant will have a perspective that differs from that of appli­\ncants who describe themselves as members of different\ngroups. But is this necessarily so? If an applicant has\none grandparent, great-grandparent, or great-great­\ngrandparent who was a member of a favored group, is that\nenough to permit UT to infer that this student’s classroom\ncontribution will reflect a distinctive perspective or set of\nexperiences associated with that group?

UT offers an enormous number of classes in a\nwide range of subjects, and it gives undergraduates a very\nlarge measure of freedom to choose their classes. UT also\noffers courses in subjects that are likely to have special\nappeal to members of the minority groups given preferen­\ntial treatment under its challenged plan, and this of\ncourse diminishes the number of other courses in which\nthese students can enroll.

At bottom, this argument relies on the unsup­\nported assumption that there is something deficient or at\nleast radically different about the African-American and\nHispanic students admitted through the Top Ten Percent\nPlan.\n   Throughout this litigation, UT has repeatedly shifted its\nposition on the need for intraracial diversity. Initially, in\nthe 2004 Proposal, UT did not rely on this alleged need at\nall.    Rather, the Proposal “examined two metrics—\nclassroom diversity and demographic disparities—that it\nconcluded were relevant to its ability to provide [the]\nbenefits of diversity.” Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 27–28. Those metrics looked only to the numbers\nof African-Americans and Hispanics, not to diversity\nwithin each group.\n   On appeal to the Fifth Circuit and in Fisher I, however,\nUT began to emphasize its intraracial diversity argument.\nUT complained that the Top Ten Percent Law hinders its\nefforts to assemble a broadly diverse class because the\nminorities admitted under that law are drawn largely\nfrom certain areas of Texas where there are majority-\nminority schools. These students, UT argued, tend to\ncome from poor, disadvantaged families, and the Univer-\nsity would prefer a system that gives it substantial leeway\nto seek broad diversity within groups of underrepresented\nminorities. In particular, UT asserted a need for more\nAfrican-American and Hispanic students from privileged\nbackgrounds. See, e.g., Brief for Respondents in No. 11–\n345, at 34 (explaining that UT needs race-conscious ad­\nmissions in order to admit “[t]he African-American or\n\f30        FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEX.

Thus, the Top\nTen Percent Law is faulted for admitting the wrong kind\nof African-American and Hispanic students.\n   The Fifth Circuit embraced this argument on remand,\nendorsing UT’s claimed need to enroll minorities from\n“high-performing,” “majority-white” high schools. 758\nF. 3d, at 653. According to the Fifth Circuit, these more\nprivileged minorities “bring a perspective not captured by”\nstudents admitted under the Top Ten Percent Law, who\noften come “from highly segregated, underfunded, and\nunderperforming schools.” Ibid. For instance, the court\ndetermined, privileged minorities “can enrich the diversity\nof the student body in distinct ways” because such stu­\ndents have “higher levels of preparation and better pro­\nspects for admission to UT Austin’s more demanding\ncolleges” than underprivileged minorities. Id., at 654; see\nalso Fisher, 631 F. 3d, at 240, n. 149 (concluding that\nthe Top Ten Percent Plan “widens the ‘credentials gap’\nbetween minority and non-minority students at the Uni­\nversity, which risks driving away matriculating minor­\nity students from difficult majors like business or the\nsciences”).\n   Remarkably, UT now contends that petitioner has “fab­\nricat[ed]” the argument that it is seeking affluent minori­\nties.

See Brief for Six Educational Non­\nprofit Organizations 12–13 (“Intraracial diversity . . . explodes\nperceived associations between racial groups and particular demographic\ncharacteristics, such as the ‘common stereotype of Black and Latina/o\nstudents[ ] that all students from these groups come from poor, inner-\ncity backgrounds.’ Schools like UT combat such stereotypes by seeking\nto admit African-American and Latino students from elevated socioeco­\nnomic and/or non-urban backgrounds” (citation omitted)); id., at 15\n(arguing that UT needs racial preferences to admit minority students\nfrom “elevated” “socioeconomic backgrounds,” because “such students\nare on a more equal social footing with the average nonminority stu­\ndent”); id., at 37–38 (“African-American and Latino students who may\ncome from higher socioeconomic status . . . may serve as ‘debiasing\nagent[s],’ promoting disequilibrium to disrupt stereotypical associa­\ntions.

AT AUSTIN\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nconclusion that it was “not getting a variety of perspec­\ntives among African-Americans or Hispanics” was the fact\nthat the Top Ten Percent Plan admits underprivileged\nminorities from highly segregated schools). In effect, UT\nasks the Court “to assume”—without any evidence—“that\nminorities admitted under the Top Ten Percent Law . . .\nare somehow more homogenous, less dynamic, and more\nundesirably stereotypical than those admitted under\nholistic review.” 758 F. 3d, at 669–670 (Garza, J., dissent­\ning). And UT’s assumptions appear to be based on the\npernicious stereotype that the African-Americans and\nHispanics admitted through the Top Ten Percent Plan\nonly got in because they did not have to compete against\nvery many whites and Asian-Americans. See Tr. of Oral\nArg. 42–43 (Dec. 9, 2015). These are “the very stereotypi­\ncal assumptions [that] the Equal Protection Clause for­\nbids.” Miller, 515 U. S., at 914. UT cannot satisfy its\nburden by attempting to “substitute racial stereotype for\nevidence, and racial prejudice for reason.” Calhoun v.\nUnited States, 568 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 4)\n(SOTOMAYOR, J., respecting denial of certiorari).\n   In addition to relying on stereotypes, UT’s argument\nthat it needs racial preferences to admit privileged minori­\nties turns the concept of affirmative action on its head.\nWhen affirmative action programs were first adopted, it\nwas for the purpose of helping the disadvantaged. See,\ne.g., Bakke, 438 U. S., at 272–275 (opinion of Powell, J.)\n(explaining that the school’s affirmative action program\nwas designed “to increase the representation” of “ ‘econom­\nically and/or educationally disadvantaged’ applicants”).\nNow we are told that a program that tends to admit poor\nand disadvantaged minority students is inadequate be­\ncause it does not work to the advantage of those who are\nmore fortunate. This is affirmative action gone wild.\n   It is also far from clear that UT’s assumptions\nabout the socioeconomic status of minorities admitted\n\f                 Cite as: 579 U.

In 2008,\nwhen petitioner applied to UT, approximately 79%\nof Texans aged 25 years or older had a high school\ndiploma, 17% had a bachelor’s degree, and 8% had a\ngraduate or professional degree. Dept. of Educ., Nat.\nCenter for Educ. Statistics, T. Snyder & S. Dillow,\nDigest of Education Statistics 2010, p. 29 (2011). In\ncontrast, 96% of African-Americans admitted through the\nTop Ten Percent Plan had a parent with a high\nschool diploma, 59% had a parent with a bachelor’s degree,\nand 26% had a parent with a graduate or professional\ndegree. See UT, Office of Admissions, Student Profile,\nAdmitted Freshman Class of 2008, p. 8 (rev. Aug. 1,\n2012) (2008 Student Profile), online at https://\nuteas.app.box.com/s/twqozsbm2vb9lhm14o0v0czvqs1ygzqr/\n1/7732448553/23476747441/1. Similarly, 83% of Hispan­\nics admitted through the Top Ten Percent Plan had a\nparent with a high school diploma, 42% had a parent with\na bachelor’s degree, and 21% had a parent with a graduate\nor professional degree. Ibid. As these statistics make\nplain, the minorities that UT characterizes as “coming\nfrom depressed socioeconomic backgrounds,” Tr. of Oral\nArg. 53 (Dec. 9, 2015), generally come from households\nwith education levels exceeding the norm in Texas.\n   Or consider income levels.      In 2008, the median\nannual household income in Texas was $49,453. United\nStates Census Bureau, A. Noss, Household Income for\nStates: 2008 and 2009, p. 4 (2010), online at\nhttps://www.census.gov/prod/2010pubs/acsbr09-2.pdf. The\nhousehold income levels for Top Ten Percent African-\nAmerican and Hispanic admittees were on par: Roughly\nhalf of such admittees came from households below the\nTexas median, and half came from households above the\nmedian. See 2008 Student Profile 6. And a large portion\nof these admittees are from households with income levels\n\f34       FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEX. AT AUSTIN\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nfar exceeding the Texas median. Specifically, 25% of\nAfrican-Americans and 27% of Hispanics admitted\nthrough the Top Ten Percent Plan in 2008 were raised in\nhouseholds with incomes exceeding $80,000. Ibid. In\nlight of this evidence, UT’s actual argument is not that it\nneeds affirmative action to ensure that its minority admit-\ntees are representative of the State of Texas. Rather, UT\nis asserting that it needs affirmative action to ensure that\nits minority students disproportionally come from families\nthat are wealthier and better educated than the average\nTexas family.\n   In addition to using socioeconomic status to falsely\ndenigrate the minority students admitted through the Top\nTen Percent Plan, UT also argues that such students are\nacademically inferior. See, e.g., Brief for Respondents in\nNo. 11–345, at 33 (“[T]he top 10% law systematically\nhinders UT’s efforts to assemble a class that is . . . aca­\ndemically excellent”). “On average,” UT claims, “African-\nAmerican and Hispanic holistic admits have higher SAT\nscores than their Top 10% counterparts.” Brief for Re­\nspondents 43, n. 8. As a result, UT argues that it needs\nrace-conscious admissions to enroll academically superior\nminority students with higher SAT scores. Regrettably,\nthe majority seems to embrace this argument as well. See\nante, at 16 (“[T]he Equal Protection Clause does not force\nuniversities to choose between a diverse student body and\na reputation for academic excellence”).\n   This argument fails for a number of reasons. First, it is\nsimply not true that Top Ten Percent minority admittees\nare academically inferior to holistic admittees. In fact, as\nUT’s president explained in 2000, “top 10 percent high\nschool students make much higher grades in college than\nnon-top 10 percent students,” and “[s]trong academic\nperformance in high school is an even better predictor of\nsuccess in college than standardized test scores.” App.\n393a–394a; see also Lavergne Deposition 41–42 (agreeing\n\f                     Cite as: 579 U.

Indeed, the statistics in the\nrecord reveal that, for each year between 2003 and 2007,\nAfrican-American in-state freshmen who were admitted\nunder the Top Ten Percent Law earned a higher mean\ngrade point average than those admitted outside of the\nTop Ten Percent Law.

These conclusions\ncorrespond to the results of nationwide studies showing\nthat high school grades are a better predictor of success in\ncollege than SAT scores.10\n  It is also more than a little ironic that UT uses the SAT,\nwhich has often been accused of reflecting racial and\ncultural bias,11 as a reason for dissatisfaction with poor\n——————\n  10 See, e.g., Strauss, Study: High School Grades Best Predictor\n\nof College Success—Not SAT/ACT Scores, Washington Post, Feb.\n21, 2014, online at https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer­\nsheet/wp/2014/02/21/a-telling-study-about-act-sat-scores/.\n  11 See, e.g., Freedle, Correcting the SAT’s Ethnic and Social-Class\n\nBias: A Method for Reestimating SAT Scores, 73 Harv.

S. 718, 730 (1982).\nInstead, it appears to be a post hoc rationalization.\n                                4\n   UT also alleges—and the majority embraces—an inter­\nest in avoiding “feelings of loneliness and isolation” among\nminority students. Ante, at 14–15; see Brief for Respond­\nents 7–8, 38–39. In support of this argument, they cite\nonly demographic data and anecdotal statements by UT\nofficials that some students (we are not told how many)\nfeel “isolated.” This vague interest cannot possibly satisfy\nstrict scrutiny.\n   If UT is seeking demographic parity to avoid isolation,\nthat is impermissible racial balancing. See Part II–C–1,\nsupra. And linking racial loneliness and isolation to state\ndemographics is illogical. Imagine, for example, that an\nAfrican-American student attends a university that is 20%\nAfrican-American. If racial isolation depends on a com­\nparison to state demographics, then that student is more\nlikely to feel isolated if the school is located in Mississippi\n(which is 37.0% African-American) than if it is located in\nMontana (which is 0.4% African-American).

In\nreality, however, the student may feel—if anything—less\nisolated in Mississippi, where African-Americans are more\nprevalent in the population at large.\n  If, on the other hand, state demographics are not driv­\ning UT’s interest in avoiding racial isolation, then its\ntreatment of Asian-American students is hard to under­\nstand. As the District Court noted, “the gross number of\nHispanic students attending UT exceeds the gross number\nof Asian-American students.” 645 F. Supp. 2d, at 606. In\n2008, for example, UT enrolled 1,338 Hispanic freshmen\nand 1,249 Asian-American freshmen. Supp. App. 156a.\nUT never explains why the Hispanic students—but not\nthe Asian-American students—are isolated and lonely\nenough to receive an admissions boost, notwithstanding\nthe fact that there are more Hispanics than Asian-\nAmericans in the student population. The anecdotal\nstatements from UT officials certainly do not indicate that\nHispanics are somehow lonelier than Asian-Americans.\n  Ultimately, UT has failed to articulate its interest in\npreventing racial isolation with any clarity, and it has\nprovided no clear indication of how it will know when such\nisolation no longer exists. Like UT’s purported interests\nin demographic parity, classroom diversity, and intrara­\ncial diversity, its interest in avoiding racial isolation can­\nnot justify the use of racial preferences.\n                                 D\n   Even assuming UT is correct that, under Grutter, it\nneed only cite a generic interest in the educational bene­\nfits of diversity, its plan still fails strict scrutiny because it\nis not narrowly tailored. Narrow tailoring requires “a\ncareful judicial inquiry into whether a university could\nachieve sufficient diversity without using racial classifica­\ntions.” Fisher I, 570 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10). “If a\n‘ “nonracial approach . . . could promote the substantial\n\f40          FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEX. AT AUSTIN\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ninterest about as well and at tolerable administrative\nexpense,” ’ then the university may not consider race.” Id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 11) (citations omitted). Here, there is no\nevidence that race-blind, holistic review would not achieve\nUT’s goals at least “about as well” as UT’s race-based\npolicy. In addition, UT could have adopted other ap­\nproaches to further its goals, such as intensifying its out­\nreach efforts, uncapping the Top Ten Percent Law, or\nplacing greater weight on socioeconomic factors.\n   The majority argues that none of these alternatives is “a\nworkable means for the University to attain the benefits of\ndiversity it sought.” Ante, at 16. Tellingly, however, the\nmajority devotes only a single, conclusory sentence to the\nmost obvious race-neutral alternative: race-blind, holistic\nreview that considers the applicant’s unique characteris­\ntics and personal circumstances. See ibid.14 Under a\nsystem that combines the Top Ten Percent Plan with race-\nblind, holistic review, UT could still admit “the star ath­\nlete or musician whose grades suffered because of daily\npractices and training,” the “talented young biologist who\nstruggled to maintain above-average grades in humanities\nclasses,” and the “student whose freshman-year grades\nwere poor because of a family crisis but who got herself\nback on track in her last three years of school.” Ante, at\n——————\n   14 The Court asserts that race-blind, holistic review is not a workable\n\nalternative because UT tried, and failed, to meet its goals via that\nmethod from 1996 to 2003. See ante, at 16 (“Perhaps more significantly,\nin the wake of Hopwood, the University spent seven years attempt­\ning to achieve its compelling interest using race-neutral holistic re­\nview”). But the Court never explains its basis for concluding that UT’s\nprevious system failed. We are not told how the Court is measuring\nsuccess or how it knows that a race-conscious program will satisfy UT’s\ngoals more effectively than race-neutral, holistic review. And although\nthe majority elsewhere emphasizes “the University’s continuing obliga­\ntion to satisfy the burden of strict scrutiny in light of changing circum­\nstances,” ante, at 10, its rejection of race-blind, holistic review relies\nexclusively on “evidence” predating petitioner’s suit by five years.\n\f                     Cite as: 579 U.

Because UT has\nfailed to provide any evidence whatsoever that race-\nconscious holistic review will achieve its diversity objec­\ntives more effectively than race-blind holistic review, it\ncannot satisfy the heavy burden imposed by the strict\nscrutiny standard.\n   The fact that UT’s racial preferences are unnecessary to\nachieve its stated goals is further demonstrated by their\nminimal effect on UT’s diversity. In 2004, when race was\nnot a factor, 3.6% of non-Top Ten Percent Texas enrollees\nwere African-American and 11.6% were Hispanic. See\nSupp. App. 157a. It would stand to reason that at least\nthe same percentages of African-American and Hispanic\nstudents would have been admitted through holistic re­\nview in 2008 even if race were not a factor. If that as­\nsumption is correct, then race was determinative for only\n15 African-American students and 18 Hispanic students in\n2008 (representing 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively, of the\ntotal enrolled first-time freshmen from Texas high\nschools). See ibid.15\n   The majority contends that “[t]he fact that race con­\nsciousness played a role in only a small portion of admis­\nsions decisions should be a hallmark of narrow tailoring,\n——————\n  15 In 2008, 1,208 first-time freshmen from Texas high schools enrolled\n\nat UT after being admitted outside the Top Ten Percent Plan. Supp.\nApp. 157a. Based on the 2004 statistics, it is reasonable to assume\nthat, if the University had undertaken a race-neutral holistic review in\n2008, 3.6% (43) of these students would have been African-American\nand 11.6% (140) would have been Hispanic. See ibid. Under the\nUniversity’s race-conscious holistic review, 58 African-American fresh­\nmen from Texas and 158 Hispanic freshmen from Texas were enrolled\nin 2008, thus reflecting an increase of only 15 African-American stu­\ndents and 18 Hispanic students. And if those marginal increases (of 15\nand 18 students) are divided by the number of total enrolled first-time\nfreshmen from Texas high schools (6,322), see ibid., the calculation\nyields the 0.2% and 0.3% percentages mentioned in the text above.\n\f42        FISHER v.

This\nargument directly contradicts this Court’s precedent.\nBecause racial classifications are “ ‘a highly suspect tool,’ ”\nGrutter, 539 U. S, at 326, they should be employed only\n“as a last resort,” Croson, 488 U. S., at 519 (opinion of\nKENNEDY, J.); see also Grutter, supra, at 342 (“[R]acial\nclassifications, however compelling their goals, are poten­\ntially so dangerous that they may be employed no more\nbroadly than the interest demands”). Where, as here,\nracial preferences have only a slight impact on minority\nenrollment, a race-neutral alternative likely could have\nreached the same result. See Parents Involved, 551 U. S.,\nat 733–734 (holding that the “minimal effect” of school\ndistricts’ racial classifications “casts doubt on the necessity\nof using [such] classifications” and “suggests that other\nmeans [of achieving their objectives] would be effective”).\nAs JUSTICE KENNEDY once aptly put it, “the small number\nof [students] affected suggests that the schoo[l] could have\nachieved [its] stated ends through different means.” Id.,\nat 790 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment). And in this case, a race-neutral alternative\ncould accomplish UT’s objectives without gratuitously\nbranding the covers of tens of thousands of applications\nwith a bare racial stamp and “tell[ing] each student he or\nshe is to be defined by race.” Id., at 789.\n                               III\n  The majority purports to agree with much of the above\nanalysis. The Court acknowledges that “ ‘because racial\ncharacteristics so seldom provide a relevant basis for\ndisparate treatment,’ ” “ ‘[r]ace may not be considered [by a\nuniversity] unless the admissions process can withstand\nstrict scrutiny.’ ” Ante, at 6–7. The Court admits that the\nburden of proof is on UT, ante, at 7, and that “a university\nbears a heavy burden in showing that it had not obtained\nthe educational benefits of diversity before it turned to a\n\f                 Cite as: 579 U.

And the Court recog­\nnizes that the record here is “almost devoid of information\nabout the students who secured admission to the Univer­\nsity through the Plan,” and that “[t]he Court thus cannot\nknow how students admitted solely based on their class\nrank differ in their contribution to diversity from students\nadmitted through holistic review.” Ante, at 9. This should\nbe the end of the case: Without identifying what was\nmissing from the African-American and Hispanic students\nit was already admitting through its race-neutral process,\nand without showing how the use of race-based admis­\nsions could rectify the deficiency, UT cannot demonstrate\nthat its procedure is narrowly tailored.\n   Yet, somehow, the majority concludes that petitioner\nmust lose as a result of UT’s failure to provide evidence\njustifying its decision to employ racial discrimination.\nTellingly, the Court frames its analysis as if petitioner\nbears the burden of proof here. See ante, at 11–19. But it\nis not the petitioner’s burden to show that the considera­\ntion of race is unconstitutional. To the extent the record is\ninadequate, the responsibility lies with UT. For “[w]hen a\ncourt subjects governmental action to strict scrutiny, it\ncannot construe ambiguities in favor of the State,” Parents\nInvolved, supra, at 786 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.), particu­\nlarly where, as here, the summary judgment posture\nobligates the Court to view the facts in the light most\nfavorable to petitioner, see Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co.\nv. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U. S. 574, 587 (1986).\n   Given that the University bears the burden of proof, it is\nnot surprising that UT never made the argument that it\nshould win based on the lack of evidence. UT instead\nasserts that “if the Court believes there are any deficien­\ncies in [the] record that cast doubt on the constitutionality\nof UT’s policy, the answer is to order a trial, not to grant\nsummary judgment.” Brief for Respondents 51; see also\nid., at 52–53 (“[I]f this Court has any doubts about how\n\f44         FISHER v.

Nevertheless, the majority cites three reasons\nfor breaking from the normal strict scrutiny standard.\nNone of these is convincing.\n                              A\n   First, the Court states that, while “th[e] evidentiary gap\nperhaps could be filled by a remand to the district court\nfor further factfinding” in “an ordinary case,” that will not\nwork here because “[w]hen petitioner’s application was\nrejected, . . . the University’s combined percentage-plan/\nholistic-review approach to admission had been in effect\nfor just three years,” so “further factfinding” “might yield\nlittle insight.” Ante, at 9. This reasoning is dangerously\nincorrect. The Equal Protection Clause does not provide a\n3-year grace period for racial discrimination. Under strict\nscrutiny, UT was required to identify evidence that race-\nbased admissions were necessary to achieve a compelling\ninterest before it put them in place—not three or more\nyears after. See ante, at 13–14 (“Petitioner is correct that\na university bears a heavy burden in showing that it had\nnot obtained the educational benefits of diversity before it\nturned to a race-conscious plan” (emphasis added)); Fisher\nI, 570 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (“[S]trict scrutiny im­\nposes on the university the ultimate burden of demon­\nstrating, before turning to racial classifications, that avail­\nable, workable race-neutral alternatives do not suffice”\n(emphasis added)). UT’s failure to obtain actual evidence\nthat racial preferences were necessary before resolving to\nuse them only confirms that its decision to inject race into\nadmissions was a reflexive response to Grutter,16 and that\nUT did not seriously consider whether race-neutral means\n\n——————\n  16 Recall that UT’s president vowed to reinstate race-conscious admis­\n\nsions within hours of Grutter’s release.

But UT has long been aware that\nit bears the burden of justifying its racial discrimination\nunder strict scrutiny. See, e.g., Brief for Respondents in\nNo. 11–345, at 22 (“It is undisputed that UT’s considera­\ntion of race in its holistic admissions process triggers strict\nscrutiny,” and “that inquiry is undeniably rigorous”).17 In\nlight of this burden, UT had every reason to keep data on\nthe students admitted through the Top Ten Percent Plan.\nWithout such data, how could UT have possibly identified\nany characteristics that were lacking in Top Ten Percent\nadmittees and that could be obtained via race-conscious\nadmissions? How could UT determine that employing a\nrace-based process would serve its goals better than, for\ninstance, expanding the Top Ten Percent Plan? UT could\n\n——————\n   17 See also, e.g., Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle\n\nSchool Dist. No. 1, 551 U.

Since UT described its\nadmissions policy to this Court in Fisher I, it has been\nrevealed that this description was incomplete. As ex­\nplained in an independent investigation into UT admis­\nsions, UT maintained a clandestine admissions system\nthat evaded public scrutiny until a former admissions\nofficer blew the whistle in 2014. See Kroll, Inc., Univer-\nsity of Texas at Austin—Investigation of Admissions Prac-\ntices and Allegations of Undue Influence 4 (Feb. 6, 2015)\n(Kroll Report). Under this longstanding, secret process,\nuniversity officials regularly overrode normal holistic\nreview to allow politically connected individuals—such as\ndonors, alumni, legislators, members of the Board of Re­\ngents, and UT officials and faculty—to get family members\nand other friends admitted to UT, despite having grades\nand standardized test scores substantially below the\nmedian for admitted students.

The Court did not\nembrace the notion that its decision to alter the stringency\nof the strict scrutiny standard somehow allowed the gov­\nernment to automatically prevail.\n                               C\n  Third, the majority notes that this litigation has per­\nsisted for many years, that petitioner has already gradu­\nated from another college, that UT’s policy may have\nchanged over time, and that this case may offer little\nprospective guidance. At most, these considerations coun­\nsel in favor of dismissing this case as improvidently granted.\nBut see, e.g., Gratz, 539 U. S., at 251, and n. 1, 260–\n262 (rejecting the dissent’s argument that, because the\ncase had already persisted long enough for the petitioners\nto graduate from other schools, the case should be dis­\nmissed); id., at 282 (Stevens, J., dissenting). None of these\nconsiderations has any bearing whatsoever on the merits\nof this suit. The majority cannot side with UT simply\nbecause it is tired of this case.\n                               IV\n     It is important to understand what is and what is not at\n—————— \n\nthe Supreme Court faulted the district court’s and this Court’s review \n\nof UT Austin’s means to achieve the permissible goal of diversity”); id.,\n\nat 665, n. 5 (Garza, J., dissenting) (“I agree with the majority that\n\nFisher represents a decisive shift in the law”). \n\n\f                 Cite as: 579 U.

What is not at stake is whether UT or\nany other university may adopt an admissions plan that\nresults in a student body with a broad representation of\nstudents from all racial and ethnic groups. UT previously\nhad a race-neutral plan that it claimed had “effectively\ncompensated for the loss of affirmative action,” App. 396a,\nand UT could have taken other steps that would have\nincreased the diversity of its admitted students without\ntaking race or ethnic background into account.\n  What is at stake is whether university administrators\nmay justify systematic racial discrimination simply by\nasserting that such discrimination is necessary to achieve\n“the educational benefits of diversity,” without explain­\ning—much less proving—why the discrimination is needed\nor how the discriminatory plan is well crafted to serve its\nobjectives. Even though UT has never provided any co­\nherent explanation for its asserted need to discriminate on\nthe basis of race, and even though UT’s position relies on a\nseries of unsupported and noxious racial assumptions, the\nmajority concludes that UT has met its heavy burden.\nThis conclusion is remarkable—and remarkably wrong.\n  Because UT has failed to satisfy strict scrutiny, I re­\nspectfully dissent.\n\f",

Argued December 9, 2015—Decided June 23, 2016\nThe University of Texas at Austin (University) uses an undergraduate\n  admissions system containing two components. First, as required by\n  the State’s Top Ten Percent Law, it offers admission to any students\n  who graduate from a Texas high school in the top 10% of their class.\n  It then fills the remainder of its incoming freshman class, some 25%,\n  by combining an applicant’s “Academic Index”—the student’s SAT\n  score and high school academic performance—with the applicant’s\n  “Personal Achievement Index,” a holistic review containing numerous\n  factors, including race.

She filed suit, alleging that the University’s consideration of\n  race as part of its holistic-review process disadvantaged her and oth-\n  er Caucasian applicants, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.\n  The District Court entered summary judgment in the University’s fa-\n  vor, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed.

UNIVERSITY OF TEX. AT AUSTIN\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Pp. 6–20.\n       (a) Fisher I sets out three controlling principles relevant to as-\n    sessing the constitutionality of a public university’s affirmative ac-\n    tion program. First, a university may not consider race “unless the\n    admissions process can withstand strict scrutiny,” i.e., it must show\n    that its “purpose or interest is both constitutionally permissible and\n    substantial, and that its use of the classification is necessary” to ac-\n    complish that purpose. 570 U. S., at ___. Second, “the decision to\n    pursue the educational benefits that flow from student body diversity\n    is, in substantial measure, an academic judgment to which some, but\n    not complete, judicial deference is proper.” Id., at ___. Third, when\n    determining whether the use of race is narrowly tailored to achieve\n    the university’s permissible goals, the school bears the burden of\n    demonstrating that “available” and “workable” “race-neutral alterna-\n    tives” do not suffice. Id., at ___. Pp. 6–8.\n       (b) The University’s approach to admissions gives rise to an unusu-\n    al consequence here. The component with the largest impact on peti-\n    tioner’s chances of admission was not the school’s consideration of\n    race under its holistic-review process but the Top Ten Percent Plan.\n    Because petitioner did not challenge the percentage part of the plan,\n    the record is devoid of evidence of its impact on diversity. Remand\n    for further factfinding would serve little purpose, however, because at\n    the time of petitioner’s application, the current plan had been in ef-\n    fect only three years and, in any event, the University lacked author-\n    ity to alter the percentage plan, which was mandated by the Texas\n    Legislature. These circumstances refute any criticism that the Uni-\n    versity did not make good faith efforts to comply with the law. The\n    University, however, does have a continuing obligation to satisfy the\n    strict scrutiny burden: by periodically reassessing the admission pro-\n    gram’s constitutionality, and efficacy, in light of the school’s experi-\n    ence and the data it has gathered since adopting its admissions plan,\n    and by tailoring its approach to ensure that race plays no greater role\n    than is necessary to meet its compelling interests. Pp. 8–11.\n        (c) Drawing all reasonable inferences in her favor, petitioner has\n    not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that she was denied\n    equal treatment at the time her application was rejected. Pp. 11–19.\n          (1) Petitioner claims that the University has not articulated its\n    compelling interest with sufficient clarity because it has failed to\n    state more precisely what level of minority enrollment would consti-\n    tute a “critical mass.” However, the compelling interest that justifies\n    consideration of race in college admissions is not an interest in enrol-\n    ling a certain number of minority students, but an interest in obtain-\n    ing “the educational benefits that flow from student body diversity.”\n    Fisher I, 570 U. S., at ___. Since the University is prohibited from\n\f                      Cite as: 579 U. S. ____ (2016)                      3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  seeking a particular number or quota of minority students, it cannot\n  be faulted for failing to specify the particular level of minority en-\n  rollment at which it believes the educational benefits of diversity will\n  be obtained.\n     On the other hand, asserting an interest in the educational benefits\n  of diversity writ large is insufficient. A university’s goals cannot be\n  elusory or amorphous—they must be sufficiently measurable to per-\n  mit judicial scrutiny of the policies adopted to reach them. The rec-\n  ord here reveals that the University articulated concrete and precise\n  goals—e.g., ending stereotypes, promoting “cross-racial understand-\n  ing,” preparing students for “an increasingly diverse workforce and\n  society,” and cultivating leaders with “legitimacy in the eyes of the\n  citizenry”—that mirror the compelling interest this Court has ap-\n  proved in prior cases. It also gave a “reasoned, principled explana-\n  tion” for its decision, id., at ___, in a 39-page proposal written after a\n  year-long study revealed that its race-neutral policies and programs\n  did not meet its goals. Pp. 11–13.\n       (2) Petitioner also claims that the University need not consider\n  race because it had already “achieved critical mass” by 2003 under\n  the Top Ten Percent Plan and race-neutral holistic review. The rec-\n  ord, however, reveals that the University studied and deliberated for\n  months, concluding that race-neutral programs had not achieved the\n  University’s diversity goals, a conclusion supported by significant\n  statistical and anecdotal evidence. Pp. 13–15.\n       (3) Petitioner argues further that it was unnecessary to consider\n  race because such consideration had only a minor impact on the\n  number of minority students the school admitted. But the record\n  shows that the consideration of race has had a meaningful, if still\n  limited, effect on freshman class diversity. That race consciousness\n  played a role in only a small portion of admissions decisions should\n  be a hallmark of narrow tailoring, not evidence of unconstitutionali-\n  ty. P. 15.\n       (4) Finally, petitioner argues that there were numerous other\n  race-neutral means to achieve the University’s goals. However, as\n  the record reveals, none of those alternatives was a workable means\n  of attaining the University’s educational goals, as of the time of her\n  application.

Until\n1996, the University made its admissions decisions pri­\nmarily based on a measure called “Academic Index” (or\nAI), which it calculated by combining an applicant’s\nSAT score and academic performance in high school. In\nassessing applicants, preference was given to racial\nminorities.\n   In 1996, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit inval­\nidated this admissions system, holding that any considera­\ntion of race in college admissions violates the Equal Pro­\ntection Clause. See Hopwood v. Texas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"714814\"><a href=\"/opinion/714814/cheryl-j-hopwood-v-state-of-texas-v-thurgood-marshall-legal-society-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">932</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 934–\n935, 948.\n   One year later the University adopted a new admissions\npolicy. Instead of considering race, the University began\n\f2        FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEX. AT AUSTIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmaking admissions decisions based on an applicant’s AI\nand his or her “Personal Achievement Index” (PAI). The\nPAI was a numerical score based on a holistic review of an\napplication. Included in the number were the applicant’s\nessays, leadership and work experience, extracurricular\nactivities, community service, and other “special charac­\nteristics” that might give the admissions committee in­\nsight into a student’s background. Consistent with\nHopwood, race was not a consideration in calculating an\napplicant’s AI or PAI.\n  The Texas Legislature responded to Hopwood as well. It\nenacted H. B. 588, commonly known as the Top Ten Per­\ncent Law. Tex. Educ. Code Ann. §51.803 (West Cum.\nSupp. 2015). As its name suggests, the Top Ten Percent\nLaw guarantees college admission to students who gradu­\nate from a Texas high school in the top 10 percent of their\nclass. Those students may choose to attend any of the\npublic universities in the State.\n  The University implemented the Top Ten Percent Law\nin 1998. After first admitting any student who qualified\nfor admission under that law, the University filled the\nremainder of its incoming freshman class using a combi­\nnation of an applicant’s AI and PAI scores—again, without\nconsidering race.\n  The University used this admissions system until 2003,\nwhen this Court decided the companion cases of Grutter v.\nBollinger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130155\"><a href=\"/opinion/130155/grutter-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, and Gratz v.

In Gratz, this Court struck down the University of\nMichigan’s undergraduate system of admissions, which at\nthe time allocated predetermined points to racial minority\ncandidates. See 539 U. S., at 255, 275–276. In Grutter,\nhowever, the Court upheld the University of Michigan\nLaw School’s system of holistic review—a system that did\nnot mechanically assign points but rather treated race as\na relevant feature within the broader context of a candi­\ndate’s application. See 539 U. S., at 337, 343–344. In\n\f                  Cite as: 579 U. S. ____ (2016)              3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nupholding this nuanced use of race, Grutter implicitly\noverruled Hopwood’s categorical prohibition.\n   In the wake of Grutter, the University embarked upon a\nyear-long study seeking to ascertain whether its admis­\nsions policy was allowing it to provide “the educational\nbenefits of a diverse student body . . . to all of the Univer­\nsity’s undergraduate students.” App. 481a–482a (affidavit\nof N. Bruce Walker ¶11 (Walker Aff.)); see also id., at\n445a–447a. The University concluded that its admissions\npolicy was not providing these benefits. Supp. App. 24a–\n25a.\n   To change its system, the University submitted a pro­\nposal to the Board of Regents that requested permission to\nbegin taking race into consideration as one of “the many\nways in which [an] academically qualified individual\nmight contribute to, and benefit from, the rich, diverse,\nand challenging educational environment of the Univer­\nsity.” Id., at 23a. After the board approved the proposal,\nthe University adopted a new admissions policy to imple­\nment it. The University has continued to use that admis­\nsions policy to this day.\n   Although the University’s new admissions policy was a\ndirect result of Grutter, it is not identical to the policy this\nCourt approved in that case. Instead, consistent with the\nState’s legislative directive, the University continues to fill\na significant majority of its class through the Top Ten\nPercent Plan (or Plan). Today, up to 75 percent of the\nplaces in the freshman class are filled through the Plan.\nAs a practical matter, this 75 percent cap, which has now\nbeen fixed by statute, means that, while the Plan contin­\nues to be referenced as a “Top Ten Percent Plan,” a stu­\ndent actually needs to finish in the top seven or eight\npercent of his or her class in order to be admitted under\nthis category.\n   The University did adopt an approach similar to the one\nin Grutter for the remaining 25 percent or so of the incom­\n\f4         FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEX. AT AUSTIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ning class. This portion of the class continues to be admit­\nted based on a combination of their AI and PAI scores.\nNow, however, race is given weight as a subfactor within\nthe PAI. The PAI is a number from 1 to 6 (6 is the best)\nthat is based on two primary components. The first com­\nponent is the average score a reader gives the applicant on\ntwo required essays. The second component is a full-file\nreview that results in another 1-to-6 score, the “Personal\nAchievement Score” or PAS. The PAS is determined by a\nseparate reader, who (1) rereads the applicant’s required\nessays, (2) reviews any supplemental information the\napplicant submits (letters of recommendation, resumes, an\nadditional optional essay, writing samples, artwork, etc.),\nand (3) evaluates the applicant’s potential contributions to\nthe University’s student body based on the applicant’s\nleadership      experience,    extracurricular    activities,\nawards/honors, community service, and other “special\ncircumstances.”\n   “Special circumstances” include the socioeconomic sta­\ntus of the applicant’s family, the socioeconomic status of\nthe applicant’s school, the applicant’s family responsibili­\nties, whether the applicant lives in a single-parent home,\nthe applicant’s SAT score in relation to the average SAT\nscore at the applicant’s school, the language spoken at the\napplicant’s home, and, finally, the applicant’s race. See\nApp. 218a–220a, 430a.\n   Both the essay readers and the full-file readers who\nassign applicants their PAI undergo extensive training to\nensure that they are scoring applicants consistently.\nDeposition of Brian Breman 9–14, Record in No. 1: 08–\nCV–00263, (WD Tex.), Doc. 96–3. The Admissions Office\nalso undertakes regular “reliability analyses” to “measure\nthe frequency of readers scoring within one point of each\nother.” App. 474a (affidavit of Gary M. Lavergne ¶8); see\nalso id., at 253a (deposition of Kedra Ishop (Ishop Dep.)).\nBoth the intensive training and the reliability analyses\n\f                 Cite as: 579 U. S. ____ (2016)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\naim to ensure that similarly situated applicants are being\ntreated identically regardless of which admissions officer\nreads the file.\n   Once the essay and full-file readers have calculated each\napplicant’s AI and PAI scores, admissions officers from\neach school within the University set a cutoff PAI/AI score\ncombination for admission, and then admit all of the\napplicants who are above that cutoff point. In setting the\ncutoff, those admissions officers only know how many\napplicants received a given PAI/AI score combination.\nThey do not know what factors went into calculating those\napplicants’ scores. The admissions officers who make the\nfinal decision as to whether a particular applicant will be\nadmitted make that decision without knowing the appli­\ncant’s race. Race enters the admissions process, then, at\none stage and one stage only—the calculation of the PAS.\n   Therefore, although admissions officers can consider\nrace as a positive feature of a minority student’s applica­\ntion, there is no dispute that race is but a “factor of a\nfactor of a factor” in the holistic-review calculus. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1498468\"><a href=\"/opinion/1498468/fisher-v-university-of-texas-at-austin/\"><span class=\"volume\">645</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

Furthermore, con­\nsideration of race is contextual and does not operate as a\nmechanical plus factor for underrepresented minorities.\nId., at 606 (“Plaintiffs cite no evidence to show racial\ngroups other than African-Americans and Hispanics are\nexcluded from benefitting from UT’s consideration of race\nin admissions. As the Defendants point out, the consider­\nation of race, within the full context of the entire applica­\ntion, may be beneficial to any UT Austin applicant—\nincluding whites and Asian-Americans”); see also Brief for\nAsian American Legal Defense and Education Fund et al.\nas Amici Curiae 12 (the contention that the University\ndiscriminates against Asian-Americans is “entirely un­\nsupported by evidence in the record or empirical data”).\nThere is also no dispute, however, that race, when consid­\nered in conjunction with other aspects of an applicant’s\n\f6         FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEX. AT AUSTIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbackground, can alter an applicant’s PAS score. Thus,\nrace, in this indirect fashion, considered with all of the\nother factors that make up an applicant’s AI and PAI\nscores, can make a difference to whether an application is\naccepted or rejected.\n   Petitioner Abigail Fisher applied for admission to the\nUniversity’s 2008 freshman class. She was not in the top\n10 percent of her high school class, so she was evaluated\nfor admission through holistic, full-file review. Petition­\ner’s application was rejected.\n   Petitioner then filed suit alleging that the University’s\nconsideration of race as part of its holistic-review process\ndisadvantaged her and other Caucasian applicants, in\nviolation of the Equal Protection Clause. See U. S. Const.,\nAmdt. 14, §1 (no State shall “deny to any person within its\njurisdiction the equal protection of the laws”).

S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). Strict scru-\ntiny requires the university to demonstrate with clarity\nthat its “ ‘purpose or interest is both constitutionally per­\nmissible and substantial, and that its use of the classifica­\ntion is necessary . . . to the accomplishment of its pur­\npose.’ ” Ibid.\n   Second, Fisher I confirmed that “the decision to pursue\n‘the educational benefits that flow from student body\ndiversity’ . . . is, in substantial measure, an academic\njudgment to which some, but not complete, judicial defer­\nence is proper.” Id., at ___ (slip op, at 9). A university\ncannot impose a fixed quota or otherwise “define diversity\nas ‘some specified percentage of a particular group merely\nbecause of its race or ethnic origin.’ ” Ibid. Once, however,\na university gives “a reasoned, principled explanation” for\nits decision, deference must be given “to the University’s\nconclusion, based on its experience and expertise, that a\ndiverse student body would serve its educational goals.”\nIbid.

Judge Garza\ndissented.\n                            III\n   The University’s program is sui generis. Unlike other\napproaches to college admissions considered by this Court,\nit combines holistic review with a percentage plan. This\napproach gave rise to an unusual consequence in this case:\nThe component of the University’s admissions policy that\nhad the largest impact on petitioner’s chances of admis­\nsion was not the school’s consideration of race under its\nholistic-review process but rather the Top Ten Percent\nPlan. Because petitioner did not graduate in the top 10\npercent of her high school class, she was categorically\nineligible for more than three-fourths of the slots in the\nincoming freshman class. It seems quite plausible, then,\nto think that petitioner would have had a better chance of\n\f                  Cite as: 579 U. S. ____ (2016)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbeing admitted to the University if the school used race-\nconscious holistic review to select its entire incoming class,\nas was the case in Grutter.\n   Despite the Top Ten Percent Plan’s outsized effect on\npetitioner’s chances of admission, she has not challenged\nit. For that reason, throughout this litigation, the Top Ten\nPercent Plan has been taken, somewhat artificially, as a\ngiven premise.\n   Petitioner’s acceptance of the Top Ten Percent Plan\ncomplicates this Court’s review. In particular, it has led to\na record that is almost devoid of information about the\nstudents who secured admission to the University through\nthe Plan. The Court thus cannot know how students\nadmitted solely based on their class rank differ in their\ncontribution to diversity from students admitted through\nholistic review.\n   In an ordinary case, this evidentiary gap perhaps could\nbe filled by a remand to the district court for further fact-\nfinding. When petitioner’s application was rejected, how­\never, the University’s combined percentage-plan/holistic­\nreview approach to admission had been in effect for just\nthree years. While studies undertaken over the eight\nyears since then may be of significant value in determin­\ning the constitutionality of the University’s current admis­\nsions policy, that evidence has little bearing on whether\npetitioner received equal treatment when her application\nwas rejected in 2008. If the Court were to remand, there­\nfore, further factfinding would be limited to a narrow 3­\nyear sample, review of which might yield little insight.\n   Furthermore, as discussed above, the University lacks\nany authority to alter the role of the Top Ten Percent Plan\nin its admissions process. The Plan was mandated by the\nTexas Legislature in the wake of Hopwood, so the Univer­\nsity, like petitioner in this litigation, has likely taken the\nPlan as a given since its implementation in 1998. If the\nUniversity had no reason to think that it could deviate\n\f10       FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEX. AT AUSTIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom the Top Ten Percent Plan, it similarly had no reason\nto keep extensive data on the Plan or the students admit­\nted under it—particularly in the years before Fisher I\nclarified the stringency of the strict-scrutiny burden for a\nschool that employs race-conscious review.\n   Under the circumstances of this case, then, a remand\nwould do nothing more than prolong a suit that has al­\nready persisted for eight years and cost the parties on both\nsides significant resources. Petitioner long since has\ngraduated from another college, and the University’s\npolicy—and the data on which it first was based—may\nhave evolved or changed in material ways.\n   The fact that this case has been litigated on a somewhat\nartificial basis, furthermore, may limit its value for pro­\nspective guidance. The Texas Legislature, in enacting the\nTop Ten Percent Plan, cannot much be criticized, for it\nwas responding to Hopwood, which at the time was bind­\ning law in the State of Texas. That legislative response, in\nturn, circumscribed the University’s discretion in crafting\nits admissions policy. These circumstances refute any\ncriticism that the University did not make good-faith\nefforts to comply with the law.\n   That does not diminish, however, the University’s con­\ntinuing obligation to satisfy the burden of strict scrutiny\nin light of changing circumstances. The University en-\ngages in periodic reassessment of the constitutionality, and\nefficacy, of its admissions program. See Supp. App. 32a;\nApp. 448a. Going forward, that assessment must be un­\ndertaken in light of the experience the school has accumu­\nlated and the data it has gathered since the adoption of its\nadmissions plan.\n   As the University examines this data, it should remain\nmindful that diversity takes many forms. Formalistic\nracial classifications may sometimes fail to capture diver­\nsity in all of its dimensions and, when used in a divisive\nmanner, could undermine the educational benefits the\n\f                  Cite as: 579 U. S. ____ (2016)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nUniversity values. Through regular evaluation of data\nand consideration of student experience, the University\nmust tailor its approach in light of changing circumstances,\nensuring that race plays no greater role than is neces-\nsary to meet its compelling interest. The University’s\nexamination of the data it has acquired in the years since\npetitioner’s application, for these reasons, must proceed\nwith full respect for the constraints imposed by the Equal\nProtection Clause. The type of data collected, and the\nmanner in which it is considered, will have a significant\nbearing on how the University must shape its admissions\npolicy to satisfy strict scrutiny in the years to come. Here,\nhowever, the Court is necessarily limited to the narrow\nquestion before it: whether, drawing all reasonable infer­\nences in her favor, petitioner has shown by a preponder­\nance of the evidence that she was denied equal treatment\nat the time her application was rejected.\n                             IV\n  In seeking to reverse the judgment of the Court of Ap­\npeals, petitioner makes four arguments. First, she argues\nthat the University has not articulated its compelling\ninterest with sufficient clarity. According to petitioner,\nthe University must set forth more precisely the level of\nminority enrollment that would constitute a “critical\nmass.” Without a clearer sense of what the University’s\nultimate goal is, petitioner argues, a reviewing court\ncannot assess whether the University’s admissions pro­\ngram is narrowly tailored to that goal.\n  As this Court’s cases have made clear, however, the\ncompelling interest that justifies consideration of race in\ncollege admissions is not an interest in enrolling a certain\nnumber of minority students. Rather, a university may\ninstitute a race-conscious admissions program as a means\nof obtaining “the educational benefits that flow from stu­\ndent body diversity.” Fisher I, 570 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n\f12        FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEX. AT AUSTIN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n9) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Grutter,\n539 U. S., at 328. As this Court has said, enrolling a\ndiverse student body “promotes cross-racial understand­\ning, helps to break down racial stereotypes, and enables\nstudents to better understand persons of different races.”\nId., at 330 (internal quotation marks and alteration omit­\nted). Equally important, “student body diversity promotes\nlearning outcomes, and better prepares students for an\nincreasingly diverse workforce and society.” Ibid. (inter­\nnal quotation marks omitted).\n   Increasing minority enrollment may be instrumental to\nthese educational benefits, but it is not, as petitioner\nseems to suggest, a goal that can or should be reduced to\npure numbers. Indeed, since the University is prohibited\nfrom seeking a particular number or quota of minority\nstudents, it cannot be faulted for failing to specify the\nparticular level of minority enrollment at which it believes\nthe educational benefits of diversity will be obtained.\n   On the other hand, asserting an interest in the educa­\ntional benefits of diversity writ large is insufficient. A\nuniversity’s goals cannot be elusory or amorphous—they\nmust be sufficiently measurable to permit judicial scrutiny\nof the policies adopted to reach them.\n   The record reveals that in first setting forth its current\nadmissions policy, the University articulated concrete and\nprecise goals. On the first page of its 2004 “Proposal to\nConsider Race and Ethnicity in Admissions,” the Univer-\nsity identifies the educational values it seeks to realize\nthrough its admissions process: the destruction of stereo­\ntypes, the “ ‘promot[ion of] cross-racial understanding,’ ”\nthe preparation of a student body “ ‘for an increasingly\ndiverse workforce and society,’ ” and the “ ‘cultivat[ion of] a\nset of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry.’ ”\nSupp. App. 1a; see also id., at 69a; App. 314a–315a (depo­\nsition of N. Bruce Walker (Walker Dep.)), 478a–479a\n(Walker Aff. ¶4) (setting forth the same goals). Later in\n\f                 Cite as: 579 U. S. ____ (2016)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe proposal, the University explains that it strives to\nprovide an “academic environment” that offers a “robust\nexchange of ideas, exposure to differing cultures, prepara­\ntion for the challenges of an increasingly diverse work­\nforce, and acquisition of competencies required of future\nleaders.” Supp. App. 23a. All of these objectives, as a\ngeneral matter, mirror the “compelling interest” this Court\nhas approved in its prior cases.\n   The University has provided in addition a “reasoned,\nprincipled explanation” for its decision to pursue these\ngoals. Fisher I, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 9). The Univer-\nsity’s 39-page proposal was written following a year-long\nstudy, which concluded that “[t]he use of race-neutral\npolicies and programs ha[d] not been successful” in\n“provid[ing] an educational setting that fosters cross-racial\nunderstanding, provid[ing] enlightened discussion and\nlearning, [or] prepar[ing] students to function in an in­\ncreasingly diverse workforce and society.” Supp. App. 25a;\nsee also App. 481a–482a (Walker Aff. ¶¶8–12) (describing\nthe “thoughtful review” the University undertook when it\nfaced the “important decision . . . whether or not to use\nrace in its admissions process”). Further support for the\nUniversity’s conclusion can be found in the depositions\nand affidavits from various admissions officers, all of\nwhom articulate the same, consistent “reasoned, princi­\npled explanation.” See, e.g., id., at 253a (Ishop Dep.),\n314a–318a, 359a (Walker Dep.), 415a–416a (Defendant’s\nStatement of Facts), 478a–479a, 481a–482a (Walker Aff.\n¶¶4, 10–13). Petitioner’s contention that the University’s\ngoal was insufficiently concrete is rebutted by the record.\n   Second, petitioner argues that the University has no\nneed to consider race because it had already “achieved\ncritical mass” by 2003 using the Top Ten Percent Plan and\nrace-neutral holistic review. Brief for Petitioner 46.\nPetitioner is correct that a university bears a heavy bur­\nden in showing that it had not obtained the educational\n\f14        FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEX. AT AUSTIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbenefits of diversity before it turned to a race-conscious\nplan. The record reveals, however, that, at the time of\npetitioner’s application, the University could not be faulted\non this score. Before changing its policy the University\nconducted “months of study and deliberation, including\nretreats, interviews, [and] review of data,” App. 446a, and\nconcluded that “[t]he use of race-neutral policies and\nprograms ha[d] not been successful in achieving” sufficient\nracial diversity at the University, Supp. App. 25a. At no\nstage in this litigation has petitioner challenged the Uni­\nversity’s good faith in conducting its studies, and the\nCourt properly declines to consider the extrarecord mate­\nrials the dissent relies upon, many of which are tangential\nto this case at best and none of which the University has\nhad a full opportunity to respond to. See, e.g., post, at 45–\n46 (opinion of ALITO, J.) (describing a 2015 report regard­\ning the admission of applicants who are related to ‘‘politi­\ncally connected individuals’’).\n   The record itself contains significant evidence, both\nstatistical and anecdotal, in support of the University’s\nposition. To start, the demographic data the University\nhas submitted show consistent stagnation in terms of the\npercentage of minority students enrolling at the Univer-\nsity from 1996 to 2002. In 1996, for example, 266 African-\nAmerican freshmen enrolled, a total that constituted 4.1\npercent of the incoming class. In 2003, the year Grutter\nwas decided, 267 African-American students enrolled—\nagain, 4.1 percent of the incoming class. The numbers for\nHispanic and Asian-American students tell a similar\nstory. See Supp. App. 43a. Although demographics alone\nare by no means dispositive, they do have some value as a\ngauge of the University’s ability to enroll students who can\noffer underrepresented perspectives.\n   In addition to this broad demographic data, the Univer­\nsity put forward evidence that minority students admitted\nunder the Hopwood regime experienced feelings of loneli­\n\f                 Cite as: 579 U. S. ____ (2016)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nness and isolation. See, e.g., App. 317a–318a.\n   This anecdotal evidence is, in turn, bolstered by further,\nmore nuanced quantitative data. In 2002, 52 percent of\nundergraduate classes with at least five students had no\nAfrican-American students enrolled in them, and 27 per­\ncent had only one African-American student. Supp. App.\n140a. In other words, only 21 percent of undergraduate\nclasses with five or more students in them had more than\none African-American student enrolled. Twelve percent of\nthese classes had no Hispanic students, as compared to 10\npercent in 1996. Id., at 74a, 140a. Though a college must\ncontinually reassess its need for race-conscious review,\nhere that assessment appears to have been done with care,\nand a reasonable determination was made that the Uni­\nversity had not yet attained its goals.\n   Third, petitioner argues that considering race was not\nnecessary because such consideration has had only a\n“ ‘minimal impact’ in advancing the [University’s] compel­\nling interest.” Brief for Petitioner 46; see also Tr. of Oral\nArg. 23:10–12; 24:13–25:2, 25:24–26:3. Again, the record\ndoes not support this assertion. In 2003, 11 percent of the\nTexas residents enrolled through holistic review were\nHispanic and 3.5 percent were African-American. Supp.\nApp. 157a. In 2007, by contrast, 16.9 percent of the Texas\nholistic-review freshmen were Hispanic and 6.8 percent\nwere African-American. Ibid. Those increases—of 54\npercent and 94 percent, respectively—show that consider­\nation of race has had a meaningful, if still limited, effect\non the diversity of the University’s freshman class.\n   In any event, it is not a failure of narrow tailoring for\nthe impact of racial consideration to be minor. The fact\nthat race consciousness played a role in only a small por­\ntion of admissions decisions should be a hallmark of nar­\nrow tailoring, not evidence of unconstitutionality.\n   Petitioner’s final argument is that “there are numerous\nother available race-neutral means of achieving” the Uni­\n\f16       FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEX. AT AUSTIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nversity’s compelling interest. Brief for Petitioner 47. A\nreview of the record reveals, however, that, at the time of\npetitioner’s application, none of her proposed alternatives\nwas a workable means for the University to attain the\nbenefits of diversity it sought. For example, petitioner\nsuggests that the University could intensify its outreach\nefforts to African-American and Hispanic applicants. But\nthe University submitted extensive evidence of the many\nways in which it already had intensified its outreach\nefforts to those students. The University has created\nthree new scholarship programs, opened new regional\nadmissions centers, increased its recruitment budget by\nhalf-a-million dollars, and organized over 1,000 recruit­\nment events. Supp. App. 29a–32a; App. 450a–452a (citing\naffidavit of Michael Orr ¶¶4–20). Perhaps more signifi­\ncantly, in the wake of Hopwood, the University spent\nseven years attempting to achieve its compelling interest\nusing race-neutral holistic review. None of these efforts\nsucceeded, and petitioner fails to offer any meaningful way\nin which the University could have improved upon them at\nthe time of her application.\n  Petitioner also suggests altering the weight given to\nacademic and socioeconomic factors in the University’s\nadmissions calculus. This proposal ignores the fact that\nthe University tried, and failed, to increase diversity\nthrough enhanced consideration of socioeconomic and\nother factors. And it further ignores this Court’s prece­\ndent making clear that the Equal Protection Clause does\nnot force universities to choose between a diverse student\nbody and a reputation for academic excellence. Grutter,\n539 U. S., at 339.\n  Petitioner’s final suggestion is to uncap the Top Ten\nPercent Plan, and admit more—if not all—the University’s\nstudents through a percentage plan. As an initial matter,\npetitioner overlooks the fact that the Top Ten Percent\nPlan, though facially neutral, cannot be understood apart\n\f                 Cite as: 579 U. S. ____ (2016)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom its basic purpose, which is to boost minority enroll­\nment. Percentage plans are “adopted with racially segre­\ngated neighborhoods and schools front and center stage.”\nFisher I, 570 U. S., at ___ (GINSBURG, J., dissenting) (slip\nop., at 2). “It is race consciousness, not blindness to race,\nthat drives such plans.” Ibid. Consequently, petitioner\ncannot assert simply that increasing the University’s\nreliance on a percentage plan would make its admissions\npolicy more race neutral.\n  Even if, as a matter of raw numbers, minority enroll­\nment would increase under such a regime, petitioner\nwould be hard-pressed to find convincing support for the\nproposition that college admissions would be improved if\nthey were a function of class rank alone. That approach\nwould sacrifice all other aspects of diversity in pursuit of\nenrolling a higher number of minority students. A system\nthat selected every student through class rank alone\nwould exclude the star athlete or musician whose grades\nsuffered because of daily practices and training. It would\nexclude a talented young biologist who struggled to main­\ntain above-average grades in humanities classes. And it\nwould exclude a student whose freshman-year grades were\npoor because of a family crisis but who got herself back on\ntrack in her last three years of school, only to find herself\njust outside of the top decile of her class.\n  These are but examples of the general problem. Class\nrank is a single metric, and like any single metric, it will\ncapture certain types of people and miss others. This does\nnot imply that students admitted through holistic review\nare necessarily more capable or more desirable than those\nadmitted through the Top Ten Percent Plan. It merely\nreflects the fact that privileging one characteristic above\nall others does not lead to a diverse student body. Indeed,\nto compel universities to admit students based on class\nrank alone is in deep tension with the goal of educational\ndiversity as this Court’s cases have defined it. See Grut-\n\f18        FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEX. AT AUSTIN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nter, supra, at 340 (explaining that percentage plans “may\npreclude the university from conducting the individualized\nassessments necessary to assemble a student body that is\nnot just racially diverse, but diverse along all the qualities\nvalued by the university”); </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 653 (pointing out\nthat the Top Ten Percent Law leaves out students “who\nfell outside their high school’s top ten percent but excelled\nin unique ways that would enrich the diversity of [the\nUniversity’s] educational experience” and “leaves a gap in\nan admissions process seeking to create the multi­\ndimensional diversity that [Regents of Univ. of Cal. v.\nBakke, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109930\"><a href=\"/opinion/109930/university-of-california-regents-v-bakke/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1978),] envisions”). At its center,\nthe Top Ten Percent Plan is a blunt instrument that may\nwell compromise the University’s own definition of the\ndiversity it seeks.\n   In addition to these fundamental problems, an admis­\nsions policy that relies exclusively on class rank creates\nperverse incentives for applicants.        Percentage plans\n“encourage parents to keep their children in low-\nperforming segregated schools, and discourage students\nfrom taking challenging classes that might lower their\ngrade point averages.” Gratz, 539 U. S., at 304, n. 10\n(GINSBURG, J., dissenting).\n   For all these reasons, although it may be true that the\nTop Ten Percent Plan in some instances may provide a\npath out of poverty for those who excel at schools lacking\nin resources, the Plan cannot serve as the admissions\nsolution that petitioner suggests. Wherever the balance\nbetween percentage plans and holistic review should rest,\nan effective admissions policy cannot prescribe, realisti­\ncally, the exclusive use of a percentage plan.\n   In short, none of petitioner’s suggested alternatives—\nnor other proposals considered or discussed in the course\nof this litigation—have been shown to be “available” and\n“workable” means through which the University could\nhave met its educational goals, as it understood and de­\n\f                  Cite as: 579 U.

Considerable deference is owed to a\nuniversity in defining those intangible characteristics, like\nstudent body diversity, that are central to its identity and\neducational mission. But still, it remains an enduring\nchallenge to our Nation’s education system to reconcile the\npursuit of diversity with the constitutional promise of\nequal treatment and dignity.\n   In striking this sensitive balance, public universities,\nlike the States themselves, can serve as “laboratories for\nexperimentation.” United States v.

The University of Texas at Austin has a\nspecial opportunity to learn and to teach. The University\nnow has at its disposal valuable data about the manner in\nwhich different approaches to admissions may foster\ndiversity or instead dilute it. The University must con-\ntinue to use this data to scrutinize the fairness of its admis­\nsions program; to assess whether changing demographics\nhave undermined the need for a race-conscious policy; and\nto identify the effects, both positive and negative, of the\naffirmative-action measures it deems necessary.\n   The Court’s affirmance of the University’s admissions\npolicy today does not necessarily mean the University may\nrely on that same policy without refinement.

See Fisher v. University of Tex. at Aus­\ntin, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">570</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">___ (2013) (Fisher I). In that decision, we\nheld that strict scrutiny requires the University of Texas\nat Austin (UT or University) to show that its use of race\nand ethnicity in making admissions decisions serves com­\npelling interests and that its plan is narrowly tailored to\nachieve those ends. Rejecting the argument that we\nshould defer to UT’s judgment on those matters, we made\nit clear that UT was obligated (1) to identify the interests\njustifying its plan with enough specificity to permit a\nreviewing court to determine whether the requirements of\nstrict scrutiny were met, and (2) to show that those re­\nquirements were in fact satisfied. On remand, UT failed\nto do what our prior decision demanded. The University\nhas still not identified with any degree of specificity the\ninterests that its use of race and ethnicity is supposed to\nserve. Its primary argument is that merely invoking “the\neducational benefits of diversity” is sufficient and that it\nneed not identify any metric that would allow a court to\ndetermine whether its plan is needed to serve, or is actually\nserving, those interests. This is nothing less than the\nplea for deference that we emphatically rejected in our\n\f2         FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEX. AT AUSTIN\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nprior decision. Today, however, the Court inexplicably\ngrants that request.\n   To the extent that UT has ever moved beyond a plea for\ndeference and identified the relevant interests in more\nspecific terms, its efforts have been shifting, unpersuasive,\nand, at times, less than candid. When it adopted its race-\nbased plan, UT said that the plan was needed to promote\nclassroom diversity. See Supp. App. 1a, 24a–25a, 39a;\nApp. 316a. It pointed to a study showing that African-\nAmerican, Hispanic, and Asian-American students were\nunderrepresented in many classes. See Supp. App. 26a.\nBut UT has never shown that its race-conscious plan\nactually ameliorates this situation. The University pre­\nsents no evidence that its admissions officers, in adminis­\ntering the “holistic” component of its plan, make any effort\nto determine whether an African-American, Hispanic, or\nAsian-American student is likely to enroll in classes in\nwhich minority students are underrepresented.           And\nalthough UT’s records should permit it to determine with­\nout much difficulty whether holistic admittees are any\nmore likely than students admitted through the Top Ten\nPercent Law, Tex. Educ. Code Ann. §51.803 (West Cum.\nSupp. 2015), to enroll in the classes lacking racial or eth­\nnic diversity, UT either has not crunched those numbers\nor has not revealed what they show. Nor has UT ex­\nplained why the underrepresentation of Asian-American\nstudents in many classes justifies its plan, which discrim­\ninates against those students.\n   At times, UT has claimed that its plan is needed to\nachieve a “critical mass” of African-American and His­\npanic students, but it has never explained what this term\nmeans. According to UT, a critical mass is neither some\nabsolute number of African-American or Hispanic stu­\ndents nor the percentage of African-Americans or Hispan­\nics in the general population of the State. The term re­\nmains undefined, but UT tells us that it will let the courts\n\f                  Cite as: 579 U. S. ____ (2016)            3\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nknow when the desired end has been achieved. See App.\n314a–315a. This is a plea for deference—indeed, for blind\ndeference—the very thing that the Court rejected in\nFisher I.\n   UT has also claimed at times that the race-based com­\nponent of its plan is needed because the Top Ten Percent\nPlan admits the wrong kind of African-American and\nHispanic students, namely, students from poor families\nwho attend schools in which the student body is predomi­\nnantly African-American or Hispanic. As UT put it in its\nbrief in Fisher I, the race-based component of its admis­\nsions plan is needed to admit “[t]he African-American or\nHispanic child of successful professionals in Dallas.” Brief\nfor Respondents, O. T. 2012, No. 11–345, p. 34.\n   After making this argument in its first trip to this\nCourt, UT apparently had second thoughts, and in the\nlatest round of briefing UT has attempted to disavow ever\nhaving made the argument. See Brief for Respondents 2\n(“Petitioner’s argument that UT’s interest is favoring\n‘affluent’ minorities is a fabrication”); see also id., at 15.\nBut it did, and the argument turns affirmative action on\nits head. Affirmative-action programs were created to\nhelp disadvantaged students.\n   Although UT now disowns the argument that the Top\nTen Percent Plan results in the admission of the wrong\nkind of African-American and Hispanic students, the Fifth\nCircuit majority bought a version of that claim. As the\npanel majority put it, the Top Ten African-American and\nHispanic admittees cannot match the holistic African-\nAmerican and Hispanic admittees when it comes to “rec­\nords of personal achievement,” a “variety of perspectives”\nand “life experiences,” and “unique skills.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">633</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n653 (2014). All in all, according to the panel majority, the\nTop Ten Percent students cannot “enrich the diversity of\nthe student body” in the same way as the holistic admit-\ntees. Id., at 654. As Judge Garza put it in dissent, the\n\f4          FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEX. AT AUSTIN\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\npanel majority concluded that the Top Ten Percent admit-\ntees are “somehow more homogenous, less dynamic, and\nmore undesirably stereotypical than those admitted under\nholistic review.” Id., at 669–670 (Garza, J., dissenting).\n   The Fifth Circuit reached this conclusion with little\ndirect evidence regarding the characteristics of the Top\nTen Percent and holistic admittees. Instead, the assump­\ntion behind the Fifth Circuit’s reasoning is that most of\nthe African-American and Hispanic students admitted\nunder the race-neutral component of UT’s plan were able\nto rank in the top decile of their high school classes only\nbecause they did not have to compete against white and\nAsian-American students. This insulting stereotype is not\nsupported by the record. African-American and Hispanic\nstudents admitted under the Top Ten Percent Plan receive\nhigher college grades than the African-American and\nHispanic students admitted under the race-conscious\nprogram. See Supp. App. 164a–165a.\n   It should not have been necessary for us to grant review\na second time in this case, and I have no greater desire\nthan the majority to see the case drag on. But that need\nnot happen. When UT decided to adopt its race-conscious\nplan, it had every reason to know that its plan would have\nto satisfy strict scrutiny and that this meant that it would\nbe its burden to show that the plan was narrowly tailored\nto serve compelling interests. UT has failed to make that\nshowing. By all rights, judgment should be entered in\nfavor of petitioner.\n   But if the majority is determined to give UT yet another\nchance, we should reverse and send this case back to the\nDistrict Court.      What the majority has now done—\nawarding a victory to UT in an opinion that fails to ad­\ndress the important issues in the case—is simply wrong.\n                             I\n    Over the past 20 years, UT has frequently modified its\n\f                 Cite as: 579 U.

Admissions were based on two criteria:\n(1) the applicant’s Academic Index (AI), which was com­\nputed from standardized test scores and high school class\nrank, and (2) the applicant’s race. In 1996, the last year\nthis race-conscious system was in place, 4.1% of enrolled\nfreshmen were African-American, 14.7% were Asian-\nAmerican, and 14.5% were Hispanic. Supp. App. 43a.\n  The Fifth Circuit’s decision in Hopwood v.

In response to Hopwood, beginning with the 1997\nadmissions cycle, UT instituted a “holistic review” process\nin which it considered an applicant’s AI as well as a Per­\nsonal Achievement Index (PAI) that was intended, among\nother things, to increase minority enrollment. The race-\nneutral PAI was a composite of scores from two essays and\na personal achievement score, which in turn was based on\na holistic review of an applicant’s leadership qualities,\nextracurricular activities, honors and awards, work expe­\nrience, community service, and special circumstances.\nSpecial consideration was given to applicants from poor\nfamilies, applicants from homes in which a language other\nthan English was customarily spoken, and applicants from\nsingle-parent households. Because this race-neutral plan\ngave a preference to disadvantaged students, it had the\neffect of “disproportionately” benefiting minority candi­\ndates. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1498468\"><a href=\"/opinion/1498468/fisher-v-university-of-texas-at-austin/\"><span class=\"volume\">645</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

In\n1997, it enacted the Top Ten Percent Plan, which man­\ndated that UT admit all Texas seniors who rank in the top\n10% of their high school classes. This facially race-neutral\nlaw served to equalize competition between students who\n\f6         FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEX.

And by benefiting\nthe students in the latter group, this plan, like the race-\nneutral holistic plan already adopted by UT, tended to\nbenefit African-American and Hispanic students, who are\noften trapped in inferior public schools. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 650–\n653.\n   Starting in 1998, when the Top Ten Percent Plan took\neffect, UT’s holistic, race-neutral AI/PAI system continued\nto be used to fill the seats in the entering class that were\nnot taken by Top Ten Percent students. The AI/PAI sys­\ntem was also used to determine program placement for\nall incoming students, including the Top Ten Percent\nstudents.\n   “The University’s revised admissions process, coupled\nwith the operation of the Top Ten Percent Law, resulted in\na more racially diverse environment at the University.”\nFisher I, 570 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3). In 2000, UT\nannounced that its “enrollment levels for African Ameri­\ncan and Hispanic freshmen have returned to those of\n1996, the year before the Hopwood decision prohibited the\nconsideration of race in admissions policies.” App. 393a;\nsee also Supp. App. 23a–24a (pre-Hopwood diversity levels\nwere “restored” in 1999); App. 392a–393a (“The ‘Top 10\nPercent Law’ is Working for Texas” and “has enabled us to\ndiversify enrollment at UT Austin with talented students\nwho succeed”). And in 2003, UT proclaimed that it had\n“effectively compensated for the loss of affirmative action.”\nId., at 396a; see also id., at 398a (“Diversity efforts at The\nUniversity of Texas at Austin have brought a higher num­\nber of freshman minority students—African Americans,\nHispanics and Asian-Americans—to the campus than\nwere enrolled in 1996, the year a court ruling ended the\nuse of affirmative action in the university’s enrollment\nprocess”).

Supp. App. 156a. The 2004 entering class thus\nhad a higher percentage of African-Americans, Asian-\nAmericans, and Hispanics than the class that entered in\n1996, when UT had last employed racial preferences.\n  Notwithstanding these lauded results, UT leapt at the\nopportunity to reinsert race into the process.

In Grutter, the\nCourt warned that a university contemplating the consid­\neration of race as part of its admissions process must\nengage in “serious, good faith consideration of workable\nrace-neutral alternatives that will achieve the diversity\nthe university seeks.” Id., at 339. Nevertheless, on the\nvery day Grutter was handed down, UT’s president an­\nnounced that “[t]he University of Texas at Austin will\nmodify its admissions procedures” in light of Grutter,\nincluding by “implementing procedures at the undergrad­\nuate level that combine the benefits of the Top 10 Percent\nLaw with affirmative action programs.” App. 406a–407a\n(emphasis added).1 UT purports to have later engaged in\n——————\n  1 See also Nissimov, UT To Resume Factoring in Applicants’ Race: UT\nTo Reintroduce Race-Based Criteria, Houston Chronicle, June 24, 2003,\np. 4A (“President Larry Faulkner said Monday his institution will\nquickly develop race-based admissions criteria by the fall that would be\nused for the summer and fall of 2004, after being given the green light\nto do so by Monday’s U.

According to UT, it has no way of making these\ndeterminations. See id., at 320a–322a. UT says that it\ndoes not tell its admissions officers how much weight to\ngive to race. See Deposition of Gary Lavergne 43–45,\nRecord in No. 1:08–CV–00263 (WD Tex.), Doc. 94–9\n(Lavergne Deposition). And because the influence of race\nis always “contextual,” UT claims, it cannot provide even a\nsingle example of an instance in which race impacted a\nstudent’s odds of admission. See App. 220a (“Q. Could you\ngive me an example where race would have some impact\non an applicant’s personal achievement score? A. To be\nhonest, not really . . . .

Accordingly, UT asserts that it has no idea which\nstudents were admitted as a result of its race-conscious\nsystem and which students would have been admitted\nunder a race-neutral process. UT thus makes no effort to\nassess how the individual characteristics of students\nadmitted as the result of racial preferences differ (or do\nnot differ) from those of students who would have been\nadmitted without them.\n\f                 Cite as: 579 U.

See, e.g., Supp. App. 24a–\n26a, 30a. Instead of focusing on the benefits of diversity,\n\f20        FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEX. AT AUSTIN\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nUT seems to have resorted to a simple racial census.\n   The majority, for its part, claims that “[a]lthough de­\nmographics alone are by no means dispositive, they do\nhave some value as a gauge of the University’s ability to\nenroll students who can offer underrepresented perspec­\ntives.” Ante, at 14. But even if UT merely “view[s] the\ndemographic disparity as cause for concern,” Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 29, and is seeking only to\nreduce—rather than eliminate—the disparity, that unde­\nfined goal cannot be properly subjected to strict scrutiny.\nIn that case, there is simply no way for a court to know\nwhat specific demographic interest UT is pursuing, why a\nrace-neutral alternative could not achieve that interest,\nand when that demographic goal would be satisfied. If a\ndemographic discrepancy can serve as “a gauge” that\njustifies the use of racial discrimination, ante, at 14, then\nracial discrimination can be justified on that basis until\ndemographic parity is reached.

In support of this\nproposition, UT relied on a study of select classes contain­\ning five or more students. As noted above, the study\nindicated that 52% of these classes had no African-\nAmericans, 16% had no Asian-Americans, and 12% had no\nHispanics. Supp. App. 26a. The study further suggested\nthat only 21% of these classes had two or more African-\nAmericans, 67% had two or more Asian-Americans, and\n70% had two or more Hispanics. See ibid. Based on this\nstudy, UT concluded that it had a “compelling educational\ninterest” in employing racial preferences to ensure that it\ndid not “have large numbers of classes in which there are\nno students—or only a single student—of a given un­\nderrepresented race or ethnicity.” Id., at 25a.\n  UT now equivocates, disclaiming any discrete interest in\nclassroom diversity. See Brief for Respondents 26–27.\nInstead, UT has taken the position that the lack of class­\nroom diversity was merely a “red flag that UT had not yet\nfully realized” “the constitutionally permissible education­\nal benefits of diversity.” Brief for Respondents in No. 11–\n345, at 43. But UT has failed to identify the level of class­\nroom diversity it deems sufficient, again making it im-\npossible to apply strict scrutiny.3 A reviewing court can­\nnot determine whether UT’s race-conscious program\nwas necessary to remove the so-called “red flag” without\nunderstanding the precise nature of that goal or know-\ning when the “red flag” will be considered to have\ndisappeared.\n  Putting aside UT’s effective abandonment of its interest\nin classroom diversity, the evidence cited in support of\nthat interest is woefully insufficient to show that UT’s\n\n——————\n  3 IfUT’s goal is to have at least two African-Americans, two Hispan­\nics, and two Asian-Americans present in each of the relevant class­\nrooms, that goal is literally unreachable in classes of five and practi-\ncally unreachable in many other small classes.\n\f22         FISHER v.

For instance, because UT knows which students\nwere admitted through the Top Ten Percent Plan and\nwhich were not, as well as which students enrolled in\nwhich classes, it would seem relatively easy to determine\nwhether Top Ten Percent students were more or less likely\nthan holistic admittees to enroll in the types of classes\nwhere diversity was lacking. But UT never bothered to\nfigure this out. See ante, at 9 (acknowledging that UT\nsubmitted no evidence regarding “how students admitted\nsolely based on their class rank differ in their contribution\nto diversity from students admitted through holistic re­\nview”). Nor is there any indication that UT instructed\nadmissions officers to search for African-American and\nHispanic applicants who would fill particular gaps at the\nclassroom level. Given UT’s failure to present such evi­\ndence, it has not demonstrated that its race-conscious\npolicy would promote classroom diversity any better than\nrace-neutral options, such as expanding the Top Ten\nPercent Plan or using race-neutral holistic admissions.\n   Moreover, if UT is truly seeking to expose its students to\na diversity of ideas and perspectives, its policy is poorly\ntailored to serve that end. UT’s own study—which the\nmajority touts as the best “nuanced quantitative data”\nsupporting UT’s position, ante, at 15—demonstrated that\nclassroom diversity was more lacking for students classi­\nfied as Asian-American than for those classified as His­\npanic.

So why has UT lumped them to­\ngether and concluded that it is appropriate to discriminate\nagainst Asian-American students because they are\n“overrepresented” in the UT student body? UT has no\ngood answer. And UT makes no effort to ensure that it\nhas a critical mass of, say, “Filipino Americans” or “Cam­\nbodian Americans.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 52 (Oct. 10, 2012). As\nlong as there are a sufficient number of “Asian Ameri­\ncans,” UT is apparently satisfied.\n   UT’s failure to provide any definition of the various\nracial and ethnic groups is also revealing. UT does not\nspecify what it means to be “African-American,” “His-\npanic,” “Asian American,” “Native American,” or “White.”\nSupp. App. 30a. And UT evidently labels each student as\nfalling into only a single racial or ethnic group, see, e.g.,\nid., at 10a–13a, 30a, 43a–44a, 71a, 156a–157a, 169a–170a,\nwithout explaining how individuals with ancestors from\ndifferent groups are to be characterized. As racial and\nethnic prejudice recedes, more and more students will\nhave parents (or grandparents) who fall into more than\none of UT’s five groups. According to census figures,\nindividuals describing themselves as members of multiple\nraces grew by 32% from 2000 to 2010.7 A recent survey\nreported that 26% of Hispanics and 28% of Asian-\nAmericans marry a spouse of a different race or ethnicity.8\n——————\n  6 And it is anybody’s guess whether this group also includes appli­\n\ncants “of full or partial Arab, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Georgian, Kurd­\nish, Persian, or Turkish descent, or whether such applicants are to be\nconsidered ‘White.’ ” Brief for Judicial Watch, Inc., et al. as Amici\nCuriae 16.\n  7 United States Census Bureau, 2010 Census Shows Multiple-Race\n\nPopulation Grew Faster Than Single-Race Population (Sept. 27, 2012),\nonline at https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/race/cb12­\n182.html.\n  8 W.

UT\nassumes that if an applicant describes himself or herself\nas a member of a particular race or ethnicity, that appli­\ncant will have a perspective that differs from that of appli­\ncants who describe themselves as members of different\ngroups. But is this necessarily so? If an applicant has\none grandparent, great-grandparent, or great-great­\ngrandparent who was a member of a favored group, is that\nenough to permit UT to infer that this student’s classroom\ncontribution will reflect a distinctive perspective or set of\nexperiences associated with that group?

UT offers an enormous number of classes in a\nwide range of subjects, and it gives undergraduates a very\nlarge measure of freedom to choose their classes. UT also\noffers courses in subjects that are likely to have special\nappeal to members of the minority groups given preferen­\ntial treatment under its challenged plan, and this of\ncourse diminishes the number of other courses in which\nthese students can enroll.

At bottom, this argument relies on the unsup­\nported assumption that there is something deficient or at\nleast radically different about the African-American and\nHispanic students admitted through the Top Ten Percent\nPlan.\n   Throughout this litigation, UT has repeatedly shifted its\nposition on the need for intraracial diversity. Initially, in\nthe 2004 Proposal, UT did not rely on this alleged need at\nall.    Rather, the Proposal “examined two metrics—\nclassroom diversity and demographic disparities—that it\nconcluded were relevant to its ability to provide [the]\nbenefits of diversity.” Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 27–28. Those metrics looked only to the numbers\nof African-Americans and Hispanics, not to diversity\nwithin each group.\n   On appeal to the Fifth Circuit and in Fisher I, however,\nUT began to emphasize its intraracial diversity argument.\nUT complained that the Top Ten Percent Law hinders its\nefforts to assemble a broadly diverse class because the\nminorities admitted under that law are drawn largely\nfrom certain areas of Texas where there are majority-\nminority schools. These students, UT argued, tend to\ncome from poor, disadvantaged families, and the Univer-\nsity would prefer a system that gives it substantial leeway\nto seek broad diversity within groups of underrepresented\nminorities. In particular, UT asserted a need for more\nAfrican-American and Hispanic students from privileged\nbackgrounds. See, e.g., Brief for Respondents in No. 11–\n345, at 34 (explaining that UT needs race-conscious ad­\nmissions in order to admit “[t]he African-American or\n\f30        FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEX.

For instance, the court\ndetermined, privileged minorities “can enrich the diversity\nof the student body in distinct ways” because such stu­\ndents have “higher levels of preparation and better pro­\nspects for admission to UT Austin’s more demanding\ncolleges” than underprivileged minorities.

Similarly, 83% of Hispan­\nics admitted through the Top Ten Percent Plan had a\nparent with a high school diploma, 42% had a parent with\na bachelor’s degree, and 21% had a parent with a graduate\nor professional degree. Ibid. As these statistics make\nplain, the minorities that UT characterizes as “coming\nfrom depressed socioeconomic backgrounds,” Tr. of Oral\nArg. 53 (Dec. 9, 2015), generally come from households\nwith education levels exceeding the norm in Texas.\n   Or consider income levels.      In 2008, the median\nannual household income in Texas was $49,453. United\nStates Census Bureau, A. Noss, Household Income for\nStates: 2008 and 2009, p. 4 (2010), online at\nhttps://www.census.gov/prod/2010pubs/acsbr09-2.pdf. The\nhousehold income levels for Top Ten Percent African-\nAmerican and Hispanic admittees were on par: Roughly\nhalf of such admittees came from households below the\nTexas median, and half came from households above the\nmedian. See 2008 Student Profile 6. And a large portion\nof these admittees are from households with income levels\n\f34       FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEX. AT AUSTIN\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nfar exceeding the Texas median. Specifically, 25% of\nAfrican-Americans and 27% of Hispanics admitted\nthrough the Top Ten Percent Plan in 2008 were raised in\nhouseholds with incomes exceeding $80,000. Ibid. In\nlight of this evidence, UT’s actual argument is not that it\nneeds affirmative action to ensure that its minority admit-\ntees are representative of the State of Texas. Rather, UT\nis asserting that it needs affirmative action to ensure that\nits minority students disproportionally come from families\nthat are wealthier and better educated than the average\nTexas family.\n   In addition to using socioeconomic status to falsely\ndenigrate the minority students admitted through the Top\nTen Percent Plan, UT also argues that such students are\nacademically inferior. See, e.g., Brief for Respondents in\nNo. 11–345, at 33 (“[T]he top 10% law systematically\nhinders UT’s efforts to assemble a class that is . . . aca­\ndemically excellent”). “On average,” UT claims, “African-\nAmerican and Hispanic holistic admits have higher SAT\nscores than their Top 10% counterparts.” Brief for Re­\nspondents 43, n. 8. As a result, UT argues that it needs\nrace-conscious admissions to enroll academically superior\nminority students with higher SAT scores. Regrettably,\nthe majority seems to embrace this argument as well. See\nante, at 16 (“[T]he Equal Protection Clause does not force\nuniversities to choose between a diverse student body and\na reputation for academic excellence”).\n   This argument fails for a number of reasons. First, it is\nsimply not true that Top Ten Percent minority admittees\nare academically inferior to holistic admittees. In fact, as\nUT’s president explained in 2000, “top 10 percent high\nschool students make much higher grades in college than\nnon-top 10 percent students,” and “[s]trong academic\nperformance in high school is an even better predictor of\nsuccess in college than standardized test scores.” App.\n393a–394a; see also Lavergne Deposition 41–42 (agreeing\n\f                     Cite as: 579 U.

In support of this argument, they cite\nonly demographic data and anecdotal statements by UT\nofficials that some students (we are not told how many)\nfeel “isolated.” This vague interest cannot possibly satisfy\nstrict scrutiny.\n   If UT is seeking demographic parity to avoid isolation,\nthat is impermissible racial balancing. See Part II–C–1,\nsupra. And linking racial loneliness and isolation to state\ndemographics is illogical. Imagine, for example, that an\nAfrican-American student attends a university that is 20%\nAfrican-American.

In\nreality, however, the student may feel—if anything—less\nisolated in Mississippi, where African-Americans are more\nprevalent in the population at large.\n  If, on the other hand, state demographics are not driv­\ning UT’s interest in avoiding racial isolation, then its\ntreatment of Asian-American students is hard to under­\nstand. As the District Court noted, “the gross number of\nHispanic students attending UT exceeds the gross number\nof Asian-American students.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">645</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Supp. App. 156a.\nUT never explains why the Hispanic students—but not\nthe Asian-American students—are isolated and lonely\nenough to receive an admissions boost, notwithstanding\nthe fact that there are more Hispanics than Asian-\nAmericans in the student population. The anecdotal\nstatements from UT officials certainly do not indicate that\nHispanics are somehow lonelier than Asian-Americans.\n  Ultimately, UT has failed to articulate its interest in\npreventing racial isolation with any clarity, and it has\nprovided no clear indication of how it will know when such\nisolation no longer exists. Like UT’s purported interests\nin demographic parity, classroom diversity, and intrara­\ncial diversity, its interest in avoiding racial isolation can­\nnot justify the use of racial preferences.\n                                 D\n   Even assuming UT is correct that, under Grutter, it\nneed only cite a generic interest in the educational bene­\nfits of diversity, its plan still fails strict scrutiny because it\nis not narrowly tailored. Narrow tailoring requires “a\ncareful judicial inquiry into whether a university could\nachieve sufficient diversity without using racial classifica­\ntions.” Fisher I, 570 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10). “If a\n‘ “nonracial approach . . . could promote the substantial\n\f40          FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEX.

Here, there is no\nevidence that race-blind, holistic review would not achieve\nUT’s goals at least “about as well” as UT’s race-based\npolicy. In addition, UT could have adopted other ap­\nproaches to further its goals, such as intensifying its out­\nreach efforts, uncapping the Top Ten Percent Law, or\nplacing greater weight on socioeconomic factors.\n   The majority argues that none of these alternatives is “a\nworkable means for the University to attain the benefits of\ndiversity it sought.” Ante, at 16. Tellingly, however, the\nmajority devotes only a single, conclusory sentence to the\nmost obvious race-neutral alternative: race-blind, holistic\nreview that considers the applicant’s unique characteris­\ntics and personal circumstances. See ibid.14 Under a\nsystem that combines the Top Ten Percent Plan with race-\nblind, holistic review, UT could still admit “the star ath­\nlete or musician whose grades suffered because of daily\npractices and training,” the “talented young biologist who\nstruggled to maintain above-average grades in humanities\nclasses,” and the “student whose freshman-year grades\nwere poor because of a family crisis but who got herself\nback on track in her last three years of school.” Ante, at\n——————\n   14 The Court asserts that race-blind, holistic review is not a workable\n\nalternative because UT tried, and failed, to meet its goals via that\nmethod from 1996 to 2003. See ante, at 16 (“Perhaps more significantly,\nin the wake of Hopwood, the University spent seven years attempt­\ning to achieve its compelling interest using race-neutral holistic re­\nview”). But the Court never explains its basis for concluding that UT’s\nprevious system failed. We are not told how the Court is measuring\nsuccess or how it knows that a race-conscious program will satisfy UT’s\ngoals more effectively than race-neutral, holistic review. And although\nthe majority elsewhere emphasizes “the University’s continuing obliga­\ntion to satisfy the burden of strict scrutiny in light of changing circum­\nstances,” ante, at 10, its rejection of race-blind, holistic review relies\nexclusively on “evidence” predating petitioner’s suit by five years.\n\f                     Cite as: 579 U.

Because UT has\nfailed to provide any evidence whatsoever that race-\nconscious holistic review will achieve its diversity objec­\ntives more effectively than race-blind holistic review, it\ncannot satisfy the heavy burden imposed by the strict\nscrutiny standard.\n   The fact that UT’s racial preferences are unnecessary to\nachieve its stated goals is further demonstrated by their\nminimal effect on UT’s diversity. In 2004, when race was\nnot a factor, 3.6% of non-Top Ten Percent Texas enrollees\nwere African-American and 11.6% were Hispanic. See\nSupp. App. 157a. It would stand to reason that at least\nthe same percentages of African-American and Hispanic\nstudents would have been admitted through holistic re­\nview in 2008 even if race were not a factor. If that as­\nsumption is correct, then race was determinative for only\n15 African-American students and 18 Hispanic students in\n2008 (representing 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively, of the\ntotal enrolled first-time freshmen from Texas high\nschools). See ibid.15\n   The majority contends that “[t]he fact that race con­\nsciousness played a role in only a small portion of admis­\nsions decisions should be a hallmark of narrow tailoring,\n——————\n  15 In 2008, 1,208 first-time freshmen from Texas high schools enrolled\n\nat UT after being admitted outside the Top Ten Percent Plan. Supp.\nApp. 157a. Based on the 2004 statistics, it is reasonable to assume\nthat, if the University had undertaken a race-neutral holistic review in\n2008, 3.6% (43) of these students would have been African-American\nand 11.6% (140) would have been Hispanic. See ibid. Under the\nUniversity’s race-conscious holistic review, 58 African-American fresh­\nmen from Texas and 158 Hispanic freshmen from Texas were enrolled\nin 2008, thus reflecting an increase of only 15 African-American stu­\ndents and 18 Hispanic students. And if those marginal increases (of 15\nand 18 students) are divided by the number of total enrolled first-time\nfreshmen from Texas high schools (6,322), see ibid., the calculation\nyields the 0.2% and 0.3% percentages mentioned in the text above.\n\f42        FISHER v.

This\nargument directly contradicts this Court’s precedent.\nBecause racial classifications are “ ‘a highly suspect tool,’ ”\nGrutter, 539 U. S, at 326, they should be employed only\n“as a last resort,” Croson, 488 U. S., at 519 (opinion of\nKENNEDY, J.); see also Grutter, supra, at 342 (“[R]acial\nclassifications, however compelling their goals, are poten­\ntially so dangerous that they may be employed no more\nbroadly than the interest demands”). Where, as here,\nracial preferences have only a slight impact on minority\nenrollment, a race-neutral alternative likely could have\nreached the same result. See Parents Involved, 551 U. S.,\nat 733–734 (holding that the “minimal effect” of school\ndistricts’ racial classifications “casts doubt on the necessity\nof using [such] classifications” and “suggests that other\nmeans [of achieving their objectives] would be effective”).\nAs JUSTICE KENNEDY once aptly put it, “the small number\nof [students] affected suggests that the schoo[l] could have\nachieved [its] stated ends through different means.” Id.,\nat 790 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment). And in this case, a race-neutral alternative\ncould accomplish UT’s objectives without gratuitously\nbranding the covers of tens of thousands of applications\nwith a bare racial stamp and “tell[ing] each student he or\nshe is to be defined by race.” Id., at 789.\n                               III\n  The majority purports to agree with much of the above\nanalysis. The Court acknowledges that “ ‘because racial\ncharacteristics so seldom provide a relevant basis for\ndisparate treatment,’ ” “ ‘[r]ace may not be considered [by a\nuniversity] unless the admissions process can withstand\nstrict scrutiny.’ ” Ante, at 6–7. The Court admits that the\nburden of proof is on UT, ante, at 7, and that “a university\nbears a heavy burden in showing that it had not obtained\nthe educational benefits of diversity before it turned to a\n\f                 Cite as: 579 U.

And the Court recog­\nnizes that the record here is “almost devoid of information\nabout the students who secured admission to the Univer­\nsity through the Plan,” and that “[t]he Court thus cannot\nknow how students admitted solely based on their class\nrank differ in their contribution to diversity from students\nadmitted through holistic review.” Ante, at 9. This should\nbe the end of the case: Without identifying what was\nmissing from the African-American and Hispanic students\nit was already admitting through its race-neutral process,\nand without showing how the use of race-based admis­\nsions could rectify the deficiency, UT cannot demonstrate\nthat its procedure is narrowly tailored.\n   Yet, somehow, the majority concludes that petitioner\nmust lose as a result of UT’s failure to provide evidence\njustifying its decision to employ racial discrimination.\nTellingly, the Court frames its analysis as if petitioner\nbears the burden of proof here. See ante, at 11–19. But it\nis not the petitioner’s burden to show that the considera­\ntion of race is unconstitutional. To the extent the record is\ninadequate, the responsibility lies with UT. For “[w]hen a\ncourt subjects governmental action to strict scrutiny, it\ncannot construe ambiguities in favor of the State,” Parents\nInvolved, supra, at 786 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.), particu­\nlarly where, as here, the summary judgment posture\nobligates the Court to view the facts in the light most\nfavorable to petitioner, see Matsushita Elec.

UT instead\nasserts that “if the Court believes there are any deficien­\ncies in [the] record that cast doubt on the constitutionality\nof UT’s policy, the answer is to order a trial, not to grant\nsummary judgment.” Brief for Respondents 51; see also\nid., at 52–53 (“[I]f this Court has any doubts about how\n\f44         FISHER v.

Nevertheless, the majority cites three reasons\nfor breaking from the normal strict scrutiny standard.\nNone of these is convincing.\n                              A\n   First, the Court states that, while “th[e] evidentiary gap\nperhaps could be filled by a remand to the district court\nfor further factfinding” in “an ordinary case,” that will not\nwork here because “[w]hen petitioner’s application was\nrejected, . . . the University’s combined percentage-plan/\nholistic-review approach to admission had been in effect\nfor just three years,” so “further factfinding” “might yield\nlittle insight.” Ante, at 9. This reasoning is dangerously\nincorrect. The Equal Protection Clause does not provide a\n3-year grace period for racial discrimination. Under strict\nscrutiny, UT was required to identify evidence that race-\nbased admissions were necessary to achieve a compelling\ninterest before it put them in place—not three or more\nyears after. See ante, at 13–14 (“Petitioner is correct that\na university bears a heavy burden in showing that it had\nnot obtained the educational benefits of diversity before it\nturned to a race-conscious plan” (emphasis added)); Fisher\nI, 570 U.

But UT has long been aware that\nit bears the burden of justifying its racial discrimination\nunder strict scrutiny. See, e.g., Brief for Respondents in\nNo. 11–345, at 22 (“It is undisputed that UT’s considera­\ntion of race in its holistic admissions process triggers strict\nscrutiny,” and “that inquiry is undeniably rigorous”).17 In\nlight of this burden, UT had every reason to keep data on\nthe students admitted through the Top Ten Percent Plan.\nWithout such data, how could UT have possibly identified\nany characteristics that were lacking in Top Ten Percent\nadmittees and that could be obtained via race-conscious\nadmissions? How could UT determine that employing a\nrace-based process would serve its goals better than, for\ninstance, expanding the Top Ten Percent Plan? UT could\n\n——————\n   17 See also, e.g., Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle\n\nSchool Dist.

UNIVERSITY OF TEX. AT AUSTIN\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nnot possibly make such determinations without studying\nthe students admitted under the Top Ten Percent Plan.\nIts failure to do so demonstrates that UT unthinkingly\nemployed a race-based process without examining whether\nthe use of race was actually necessary. This is not—as the\nCourt claims—a “good-faith effor[t] to comply with the\nlaw.” Ante, at 10.\n   The majority’s willingness to cite UT’s “good faith” as\nthe basis for excusing its failure to adduce evidence is\nparticularly inappropriate in light of UT’s well-\ndocumented absence of good faith. Since UT described its\nadmissions policy to this Court in Fisher I, it has been\nrevealed that this description was incomplete. As ex­\nplained in an independent investigation into UT admis­\nsions, UT maintained a clandestine admissions system\nthat evaded public scrutiny until a former admissions\nofficer blew the whistle in 2014. See Kroll, Inc., Univer-\nsity of Texas at Austin—Investigation of Admissions Prac-\ntices and Allegations of Undue Influence 4 (Feb. 6, 2015)\n(Kroll Report). Under this longstanding, secret process,\nuniversity officials regularly overrode normal holistic\nreview to allow politically connected individuals—such as\ndonors, alumni, legislators, members of the Board of Re­\ngents, and UT officials and faculty—to get family members\nand other friends admitted to UT, despite having grades\nand standardized test scores substantially below the\nmedian for admitted students. Id., at 12–14; see also\nBlanchard & Hoppe, Influential Texans Helped Under-\nqualified Students Get Into UT, Dallas Morning News,\nJuly 20, 2015, online at http://www.dallasnews.com/news/\neducation /headlines/ 20150720 - influential -texans-helped­\nunderqualified-students-get-into-ut.ece (“Dozens of highly\ninfluential Texans—including lawmakers, millionaire\ndonors and university regents—helped underqualified\nstudents get into the University of Texas, often by writing\nto UT officials, records show”).\n\f                     Cite as: 579 U. S. ____ (2016)                    47\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n   UT officials involved in this covert process intentionally\nkept few records and destroyed those that did exist. See,\ne.g., Kroll Report 43 (“Efforts were made to minimize\npaper trails and written lists during this end-of-cycle\nprocess. At one meeting, the administrative assistants\ntried not keeping any notes, but this proved difficult, so\nthey took notes and later shredded them. One administra­\ntive assistant usually brought to these meetings a stack of\nindex cards that were subsequently destroyed”); see also\nid., at 13 (finding that “written records or notes” of the\nsecret admissions meetings “are not maintained and are\ntypically shredded”). And in the course of this litigation,\nUT has been less than forthright concerning its treatment\nof well-connected applicants. Compare, e.g., Tr. of Oral\nArg. 51 (Dec. 9, 2015) (“University of Texas does not do\nlegacy, Your Honor”), and App. 281a (“[O]ur legacy policy\nis such that we don’t consider legacy”), with Kroll Report\n29 (discussing evidence that “alumni/legacy influence”\n“results each year in certain applicants receiving a com­\npetitive boost or special consideration in the admissions\nprocess,” and noting that this is “an aspect of the admis­\nsions process that does not appear in the public represen­\ntations of UT-Austin’s admissions process”). Despite UT’s\napparent readiness to mislead the public and the Court,\nthe majority is “willing to be satisfied by [UT’s] profession\nof its own good faith.”        Grutter, 539 U. S., at 394\n(KENNEDY, J., dissenting).18\n——————\n  18 The majority’s claim that UT has not “had a full opportunity to\n\nrespond to” the Kroll Report, ante, at 14, is simply wrong. The report\nwas discussed in no less than six of the briefs filed in this case. See\nBrief in Opposition 19–20, n. 2; Reply to Brief in Opposition 6; Brief for\nRespondents 51, n. 9; Brief for Cato Institute as Amicus Curiae 8–12\n(certiorari stage); Brief for Cato Institute as Amicus Curiae 12, and n. 4\n(merits stage); Brief for Judicial Education Project as Amicus Curiae 5–\n17. Not only did UT have an “opportunity to respond” to the Kroll\nReport—it did in fact respond at both the certiorari stage and the\nmerits stage. See Brief in Opposition 19–20, n. 2 (explicitly discussing\n\f48          FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEX. AT AUSTIN\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n   Notwithstanding the majority’s claims to the contrary,\nUT should have access to plenty of information about\n“how students admitted solely based on their class rank\ndiffer in their contribution to diversity from students\nadmitted through holistic review.” Ante, at 9. UT un­\ndoubtedly knows which students were admitted through\nthe Top Ten Percent Plan and which were admitted\nthrough holistic review. See, e.g., Supp. App. 157a. And it\nundoubtedly has a record of all of the classes in which\nthese students enrolled. See, e.g., UT, Office of the Reg­\nistrar,    Transcript—Official,      online    at     https://\nregistrar.utexas.edu/students/transcripts-official (instruct­\ning graduates on how to obtain a transcript listing a “com­\nprehensive record” of classes taken). UT could use this\ninformation to demonstrate whether the Top Ten Percent\nminority admittees were more or less likely than the\nholistic minority admittees to choose to enroll in the\ncourses lacking diversity.\n   In addition, UT assigns PAI scores to all students—\nincluding those admitted through the Top Ten Percent\nPlan—for purposes of admission to individual majors.\nAccordingly, all students must submit a full application\ncontaining essays, letters of recommendation, a resume, a\n——————\nthe “recently released Kroll Report”); Brief for Respondents 51, n. 9\n(similar). And the Court’s purported concern about reliance on “ex­\ntrarecord materials,” ante, at 14, rings especially hollow in light of its\nwillingness to affirm the decision below, which relied heavily on the\nFifth Circuit’s own extrarecord Internet research, see, e.g., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at\n650–653.\n   The majority is also wrong in claiming that the Kroll Report is “tan­\ngential to this case at best.” Ante, at 14. Given the majority’s blind\ndeference to the good faith of UT officials, evidence that those officials\n“failed to speak with the candor and forthrightness expected of people\nin their respective positions of trust and leadership,” Kroll, Inc., Uni­\nversity of Texas at Austin—Investigation of Admissions Practices and\nAllegations of Undue Influence 29 (Feb. 6, 2015), when discussing UT’s\nadmissions process is highly relevant.\n\f                      Cite as: 579 U.

Unless UT\nhas destroyed these files,19 it could use them to compare\nthe unique personal characteristics of Top Ten minority\nadmittees with those of holistic minority admittees, and to\ndetermine whether the Top Ten admittees are, in fact, less\ndesirable than the holistic admittees. This may require\nUT to expend some resources, but that is an appropriate\nburden in light of the strict scrutiny standard and the fact\nthat all of the relevant information is in UT’s possession.\nThe cost of factfinding is a strange basis for awarding a\nvictory to UT, which has a huge budget, and a loss to\npetitioner, who does not.\n   Finally, while I agree with the majority and the Fifth\nCircuit that Fisher I significantly changed the governing\nlaw by clarifying the stringency of the strict scrutiny\nstandard,20 that does not excuse UT from meeting that\n——————\n   19 UT’s current records retention policy requires it to retain student\n\nrecords, including application materials, for at least five years after a\nstudent graduates. See University of Texas at Austin, Records Reten­\ntion Schedule, Agency Item No. AALL358, p. 58 (Nov. 14, 2014), online\nat     https://www.tsl.texas.gov/sites/default/files/public/tslac/slrm/state/\nschedules/721.pdf. If this policy was in place when UT resumed race-\nconscious admissions in 2004, then it still had these materials when\npetitioner filed this suit in 2008, and likely still had them at the time of\nFisher I in 2013. At the very least, the application materials for the\n2008 freshman class appear to be subject to a litigation hold. See App.\n290a–292a. To the extent that UT failed to preserve these records, the\nconsequences of that decision should fall on the University, not on\npetitioner. Cf. Tyson Foods, Inc. v.

In Adarand, for instance, another case in\nwhich the Court clarified the rigor of the strict scrutiny\nstandard, the Court acknowledged that its decision “al­\nter[ed] the playing field in some important respects.” 515\nU. S., at 237. As a result, it “remand[ed] the case to the\nlower courts for further consideration in light of the prin­\nciples [it had] announced.” Ibid. (emphasis added). In\nother words, the Court made clear that—notwithstanding\nthe shift in the law—the government had to meet the\nclarified burden it was announcing. The Court did not\nembrace the notion that its decision to alter the stringency\nof the strict scrutiny standard somehow allowed the gov­\nernment to automatically prevail.\n                               C\n  Third, the majority notes that this litigation has per­\nsisted for many years, that petitioner has already gradu­\nated from another college, that UT’s policy may have\nchanged over time, and that this case may offer little\nprospective guidance. At most, these considerations coun­\nsel in favor of dismissing this case as improvidently granted.\nBut see, e.g., Gratz, 539 U. S., at 251, and n. 1, 260–\n262 (rejecting the dissent’s argument that, because the\ncase had already persisted long enough for the petitioners\nto graduate from other schools, the case should be dis­\nmissed); id., at 282 (Stevens, J., dissenting). None of these\nconsiderations has any bearing whatsoever on the merits\nof this suit.

What is not at stake is whether UT or\nany other university may adopt an admissions plan that\nresults in a student body with a broad representation of\nstudents from all racial and ethnic groups. UT previously\nhad a race-neutral plan that it claimed had “effectively\ncompensated for the loss of affirmative action,” App. 396a,\nand UT could have taken other steps that would have\nincreased the diversity of its admitted students without\ntaking race or ethnic background into account.\n  What is at stake is whether university administrators\nmay justify systematic racial discrimination simply by\nasserting that such discrimination is necessary to achieve\n“the educational benefits of diversity,” without explain­\ning—much less proving—why the discrimination is needed\nor how the discriminatory plan is well crafted to serve its\nobjectives. Even though UT has never provided any co­\nherent explanation for its asserted need to discriminate on\nthe basis of race, and even though UT’s position relies on a\nseries of unsupported and noxious racial assumptions, the\nmajority concludes that UT has met its heavy burden.\nThis conclusion is remarkable—and remarkably wrong.\n  Because UT has failed to satisfy strict scrutiny, I re­\nspectfully dissent.\n\f</pre>",
