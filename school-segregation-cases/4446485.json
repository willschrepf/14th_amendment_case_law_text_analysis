In regards to\nRigoberto Guerrero, I filed a prior 11.07 Writ on his behalf; however, that. Writ was\nsubsequently dismissed and has been refiled.

Hopefully, this will avert a·dismissal.\n\nAs per our discussion on 10/14/15, I hope that my clients' Petitions can be considered by the\nCourt now that I am in compliance with Rule 73.1(£).

Lucas is 14 years old and came in with his grandmother for discussion of genetic\n                      testing. My overall impression was that Lucas has a moderate form ofEhlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) type I\n\n\n            ••        characterized by tall stature, hypermobility, arthralgia, and some symptoms of paroxysmal orthostatic\n                      tachycardia syndrome (POTS). I had inquired of the GeneDx company what the family self-pay would be for\n                      exome sequencing that examines all23,000 human genes, and they responded that the family would have\n\n\n           ••         minimal out-of-pocket costs. I will now resend their new insurance information to confirm full insurance\n                      coverage, and we will try to arrange the exome test for Lucas, his mother in Flower Mound, and his father\n                      who is incarcerated in Tennessee Colony Texas. I will send a follow-up letter when we have the out-of-pocket\n\n\n          ••          estimates with potential blood draw mechanisms for the parents .\n\n                      PAST MEDICAL IDSTORY: I had previously documented the history of several infantile fractures which\n\n\n         ••           resulted in placement with his grandmother since age 1 year. He had some development delays with need for ECI\n                      that may have reflected healing from fractures since he has done well in school until recently. He had some physical\n                      therapy at age 8-9 years and he has had normal language. Symptoms such as joint popping, arthralgias, fractures in\n\n\n        ••\n                      his L foot, and stomach issues suggestive of IBS suggest the diagnosis ofEDS, and some urologic issues along with\n                      dry eyes have suggested POTS along with dizziness on standing, hypotension, enjoyment of salty foods, occasional\n                      fatigue and \"brain fog,\" the latter possibly accounting for some school difficulties. He was told that he has collapsed\n\n\n\n       ••\n                      arch~s in his feet.\n\n\n                      FAMILY IDSTORY: The previously documented family history indicates that Lucas has half-brothers Jacob and\n\n\n\n      ••\n                      Matthew, the latter with early fractures that in 2009 resulted in his father having criminal charges of child abuse\n                      with incarceration. Grandmother (mother of the three boys' father), does not have contact with these other\n                      grandchildren, but thinks that Jacob may have had an arm fracture. Grandmother is a nurse working in dialysis and\n\n\n\n     ••\n                      has had several symptoms ofEDS-joint pains with flexibility, migraines, menorrhagia, and endometriosis. She has\n                      another son in addition to Lucas' father with joint issues and a daughter who has a son, age 9, with flexibility,\n                      asthma, and eczema.\n\n\n\n    ••                PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Lucas was 6-2 'l'2(90th centile for age) and weighed 163 lbs (50th centile for age)\n                      with a head circumference of22.5 inches (901h centile for age). He continues to grow rapidly (6-1 at his last visit)\n                      and has a slender, fit build that will help prevent wear-and-tear joint injury.\n\n\n   ••                 H EENT: Normal hair pattern and texture with normal head shape; normal facial appearance with no subtle\n                      anomalies of the eyes, ears, or jaw..\n                      Back: Mild dextroscoliosis in thoracolumbar region with angle of about 5 degrees.\n\n\n  ••                  Extremities: Normal proportions with normal palmar creases. I previously documented moderately increased joint\n                      laxity with Beighton hypermobility scale of 5-6/9). He has long fingers and the thumb-little finger overlap around\n                      wrist (Walker-Murdoch) and thumb through fist (Hoffinan) signs were positive.\n\n\n ••                   Skin: Soft texture with hyperelasticity sufficient to give a 1 inch fold on his forearm .\n                      Neuro: No focal neurologic deficits. He is very interactive and conversational with obvious normal intelligence.

Lucas is 14 years old and came in with his grandmother for evaluation of a possible\n                               connective tissue dysplasia.

He has been in a boot twice for stress fractures in his L foot. His most severe\n                              symptoms are likely due to ms with severe stomach issues at ages 4-5 years after GE reflux as a baby. He\n                              has chronic constipation and Dr. Russo performed a normal endoscopy and biopsy. Also potentially related\n                              to dysautonomia are urology issues with need for stents in his ureters and an episode of urosepsis. He also\n\n\n      ••                      has had significant vision issues with dry eyes and poor vision evaluated at age 6-7 years. He was found to\n                              have vitamin A deficiency and now takes 25,000 units per day, also having other fat-soluble vitamin\n                              deficiencies such as vitamin K that could reflect bowel malabsorption-he is seeing Dr. Hutchinson of\n\n\n     ••                       endocrinology and Dr. Russo of Gl for these issues. He also has symptoms of POTS with an episode of\n                              severe shortness of breath and saw Dr. Zellers of cardiology with monitoring for arrhythmia that was\n                              apparently negative.

Many\n             physicians and geneticists continue to view EDS as a group of rare specific types, but my experience teaches that hypermobility\n\n\n     ••      disorders and EDS comprise a spectrum that is as common as diabetes. Most individuals have only hypermobility, a trait that they\n             take for granted and become aware of only when they have frequent sprains or wear-and-tear arthritis. Others have more severe\n             symptoms that can be disabling but not life-threatening, and the clinical diagnosis ofEDS emphasizes that patients have a true\n\n\n     ••      condition and that their anxiety, fatigue, and chronic pain are real symptoms rather than \"in their minds\" or branding them as\n             hypochondriacs. The Inspire website (https://www.inspire.com/groups/ehlers-danlos-national-foundationl) is an excellent and patient-\n             oriented source of information.\n\n\n\n     ••      Rarer, extreme'forms·'ofEDS-reflect single gencf(autosoin'al dominant)inheritante:-The severe types ofEDS along with other\n            members of the connective tissue dysplasia category like Marfan syndrome (exemplified by an Abe Lincoln build) or osteogenesis\n                                                                                                                                                --\n\n\n\n\n     ••\n            imperfecta (OI or brittle bone disease) exhibit autosomal dominant inheritance, meaning that affected individuals have one normal and\n            one abnormal gene. The abnormal gene dominates to cause connective tissue laxity-both genes make protein with the abnormal gene\n            making a deformed protein that interacts with the normal protein like bricks in a wall. The deformed brick (protein) makes the wall\n            wobbly and weak, translating to weaker and flexible skin, joints, and blood vessel walls. Severe forms ofEDS and related conditions\n\n\n   ••       can be diagnosed by targeted DNA testing-fibrillin gene testing for those with obvious Marfan syndrome, collagen type ill testing\n            for those with obvious EDS type IV. collagen I testing for those with obvious 01.\n\n\n\n    ••      Most EDS cases are cause by multiple genes and comprise a spectrum: Most patients with EDS exhibit overlapping symptoms of\n            joint popping/dislocation/injury with later arthritis, soft and elastic skin with unusual scars and bruising, migraines, heavy periods with\n            endometriosis, and dysautonomia (altered function of the autonomic nervous system) with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and\n\n\n  ••        paroxysmal orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). In EDS, POTS is due to pooling of blood in lower extremities when standing\n            with dizziness, fainting, fatigue, and \"brain fog\" (intervals of decreased focus and memory). Diagnosis ofEDS among many causes of\n            dysautonomia allows therapy by increasing intravascular volume with hydration and salt to increase brain perfusion. Patients with\n\n\n  ••        broader symptoms are likely to have multiple gene changes compatible with multifactorial causation.\n\n            EDS remains a clinical diagnosis: As of now the diagnosis ofEDS is clinical in most cases, meaning documentation of typical\n\n\n   ••       histories and physical findings (tall stature, lean build, hypermobility, skin elasticity). Patients can be grouped as hypermobile EDS\n            (REDS) or classical (CEDS with broad symptoms) but this is greatly oversimplified, as are the 7 types described by Beighton. I tend\n            to group patients with only skeletal symptoms as type II or ill (with associated stretch marks/scarring) and those with broader\n\n\n\n   ••\n            symptoms as type I. Since over 40 genes have been implicated in EDS, we can anticipate over 40 types with overlapping symptoms\n            when DNA testing of multiple genes becomes routine. At present the clinical diagnosis of connective tissue dysplasia or EDS\n            spectrum disorder is reasonable since it will guide patients and physicians to anticipate a broad range of medical complications and\n\n\n\n   ••\n            refute assumptions about mental illness or hypochondriasis .. The many possible gene changes make single gene (DNA) testing oflow\n            yield except in cases with obvious Marfan or EDS IV.\n\n\n\n\n  ••\n            Gene testing for EDS: Three levels of gene (DNA) testing include I) testing for Marfan and related Loeys-Dietz syndromes through\n            LabCorp (-$1600 and usually covered by insurance), 2) a 12-gene panel including Marfan, EDS type IV, and other rare forms ($3600\n            with guaranteed maximal $100 self-pay over insurance through the GeneDx company), and 3) exome sequencing examining the exons\n            (protein-coding regions)ofall23,000 genes in our genome (rapid parallel/(NextGen sequencing of parent-child trios for $9000\n\n\n   ••       through GeneDx with guaranteed max of$1000 self-pay over insurance). For the latter test, I can send insurance information to\n            GeneDx to ascertain each family's self-pay amount which sometimes is much less than $1000. Sadly, most genetic testing is not\n            covered by Medicaid or Medicare. Even a positive gene test may not lead to different therapy or management.\n\n\n  ••        EDS therapies: Arthritis is due to joint hypermobility with wear-and-tear injury (osteoarthritis), not from inflammation like\n            rheumatoid arthritis or that due to lupus and other rheumatic diseases. Thus therapy is preventive with common sense\n\n\n ••         recommendations for joint protection, favoring activities like swimming and avoiding those like long distance running, gymnastics,\n            etc. Patients should remain active with moderate weight-lifting and other reasonable activities to build muscles aronnd the joints,\n            preventing cycles of inactivity with increasing joint stiffuess and pain that present as chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia. The\n\n\n••          RICE (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) approach to injury can minimize ongoing joint damage, and susceptibility to injury plus\n            slow healing should prompt early orthopedic evaluation to exclude tears and fractures. POTS benefits from hydration (8 glasses fluid\n            per day), salt in the absence ofhypertension, and vitamins (C--2g per day, D >1000 units per day, Bl2-2.5 mg per day, daily\n\n\n••          multivitamin and mineral preparation). ms can be helped by avoiding fluids before meals with small feeds and, for some, low gluten.\n\n\n\n\n•\n\f                 ••        Jt\".-31-2013 WED 05:35AM\n                                                         I\n\n\n                                                        Rece lued:\n                                                                                                               rAX NU.\n                                                                                                               May 22 2013 05:33Pm\n                                                                                                                                                                         r.   uc:.\n\n\n\n\n                ••         MF 22-2013 WED 05:17PM                                                            FAX NO.                                              ?. 02\n\n\n\n               ••                                                             PHYSICIAN REFERRAL\n\n\n              ••                                  NOTE: Application cannot be processed without physician referral\n                      A TIENTION: Referring Physician -the following is REQUIRED data:\n                      1) Child's Nama and Dilte of Birth\n\n\n             ••       2) SgctiQLl.A and/or Section B completed in its ENTIRETY for determination of child's eligibility\n                      3) Phvsician Signature, Date, Medical License Number, and Demographics\n\n\n\n            ••        If you have any questions regarding the referral an~/or services that TSRHC provides, please contact the Pa1ient\n                      Access RN at (214) 559~7559 or 1 {800) 595-7604 .\n\n                                       Gl1~ {{~J()                             -~ uf? bet\"\\\n           ••         Child's name\n                                           Last\n                                                             1\n                                                                 LU r.et S\n                                                                  First          Middle                (SUfflk)\n                                                                                                                       Dat13 of birth   CPL l\n                                                                                                                                        Mo\n                                                                                                                                                    G tf\n                                                                                                                                                   Day\n                                                                                                                                                           f /\n                                                                                                                                                            Yr\n                                                                                                                                                                 qCfCj\n\n           •\n                      Section A- REQUEST FOR ORTHOPEDIC/MUSCULOSKELETAL\n                                                 ,                      EVALUATION (completed by MD)\n\n\n\n\n          ••\n          ••\n          ••\n          •••\n         ••                                                                                                                             --;:;;..,(<...-..'--r-~J'­\n        ••                                                                                                                      DATE\n                                                                                                                  MEDICAL WCENSl: # /,'?-1_                 i-f::;--\n\n       ••             PtiYSICIAN'S ADDRESS-...,,..,..-----------------------;:::--::--::-----\n                                       Straar                                   Suite #\n\n\n\n      ••                   City\n\n                      PHONE()t-fr        C(J;J.-. mY\n                                                                      State\n\n                                                                FAx<2/!D··· 'de r ..[f6f\n                                                                                              .   .

I was able to obtain whole exome sequencing\n             (WES) that examines all 23,000 genes and I now attach results of this testing that show a mutation\n\n ••          affecting the mitochondrial MT-COl gene that encodes one of many proteins that constitute a subunit of\n             cytochrome C oxidase, also known as Complex IV. The mutation changes the amino acid threonine (T)\n\n\n ••\n             to methionine: (M) at position 31 of the MT-CO 1 protein (p. T31 M), and is present in 40% of Lucas'\n             mitochondria (he thus has mixtures ofmutant and normal mitochondria in his cells, something called\n             heteroplasmy). This mut..1.tion was present in Lucas' mother at a lower level ofheteroplasmy. and has not\n\n\n ••          been observed in DNA databases from nonnal individuals-it is thus is not a common benign variation .\n             The report classifies it as a variant of unk11own significance. but I have now seen at least 6 patients with\n             EDs-dysautonomia symptoms that have mitochondrial mutations, and the essential role of mitochondrial\n\n••           complexlY in energy metabolism, particularly important in the brain, l1eart, nerve, and muscle, leads me\n             to suspect that such mitochondrial mutations a1·e a cause of AAD-EDS symptoms.\n\n\n  ••         It is likely that Lucas' half-brothers, at least one having early fractures that can occur with AAD-EDS,\n             have the same mitochondrial mutation from their mother since women pass on the mitochondria to all\n\n\n ••          children. We cannot predict the fraction of their mutant mitochondria compared to the 40% in Lucas .\n             Supporting the relevance ofthe mitochondrial MT-COl mutation to'AAD-EDS symptoms is the fact\n             that the matemal grandmother has some of these symptoms, likely havil1g the same MT-C01 mutation\n\n\n  ••         and passing it on to her daughter. Relatives could have testing for the particular MT-COI mutation at a\n             cost of $350 each, and this could be coordinated by Ms. Alderd1ce of the GeneDx company.\n\n\n   ••         These results do exclude severe forms·of cmmective tissue dysplasia such as Marfau syndrome, Ehlers-·\n              Danlos: syndrome type IV, or osteogenesis imperfecta since those genes were well-covered by the exome\n\n\n   ••         technology. The results also excluded mutations in 56 genes such as the breast-ovarian cancer/BRCA\n              genes, tenned incidental findings because they may not be related to the indication for testing. The latter\n              genes were screened in Lucas but not in his mother since only mutations found in his mother would be\n\n    ••        examined in her relatives .\n\n              I would emphasize that the there could be additional gene mutations contributihg to AAD.:.EDS\n\n     ••       symptoms in Lucas and his half. brothers that were not recognized by-this new WES teclmology.

There are also many human genes that do not have known functions\n          and/or have not been correlated with human disease~·-mutations in these genes may not be called as\n          disease. related by the computer software that examines the over 600 million DNA nucleotides (AGCT\n          letters) documented by whole exome sequencing. Finally, although most genes are covered from 90 to\n          97% of their length by the sequencing, some gene regions are not examined and thus mutations can be\n          missed. Because WES is a recent advance, additional studies on patients with connective tissue laxity\n          are certain to uncover more genes related to this disease spectnun. That 1s why GeneDx keeps a\n          database of new gene discoveries, updating prior patient repm1s if they have such mutations. The\n          company also offers to reanalyze the sequencing results every 3.4 years so that new gene discoveries\n          can be incorporated into the computer software.\n\n          I would still consider Lucas to have a diagnosis ofEDS-dysautonomia, now better described as AAD-\n          EDS because my genetic data is showing that any part of the joint (articulation)--skin, nerve, muscle,\n          bone, joint tissue, blood vessel~~can be impacted to cause the same pattem of symptoms (see\n          attachment). His clinical profile would fit with EDS type I or classic type since his hype1mobility is not\n\n!.        as dramatic as with EDS type III, although the types are being outdated by the new sequencing results.\n          Most importat1t is for Lucas and by implicatio11 his half:.brothers to follow joint protection and 11utrition\n\n\n\n•:        strategies in the attaclm1ent.

Cigarette smoke, probably due to\n             the carbon monoxide, is known to hasten the progression of some conditions. Remember that carbon monoxide kills\n             by inhibiting complex IV of OXPHOS, why make it worse? Cigarette smoke will make it worse.\n\n             MSG\n             MSG (monosodium glutamate) has for years been known to cause migraine headaches in otherwise healthy\n             individuals, and may trigger these events in susceptible people with mitochondrial disease. MSG is frequently added\n             to Chinese (and other Asian) foods, and is also found in high levels of dried and canned soup. Read the label and\n             avoid MSG if there is any sensitivity.\n             \"'Back to Top*\n\n             Vitamins and Cofactors\n             Vitamins and cofactors are compounds that are required in order for the chemical reactions, which make energy, to run\n             efficiently. By definition, a cofactor can be made by the body, whereas a vitamin cannot, and therefore must be eaten.\n             For most people, a regular diet contains aU the vitamins one could possibly need and their bodies can make as much\n             of any specific cofactor that it needs. For those with mitochondrial disorders, added vitamins and cofactors may be\n             useful.                                                                                                         ·\n             The use of supplemental vitamins and cofactors is largely unproven and their use is therefore controversial in patients\n             with mitochondrial diseases. For disorders of OXPHOS, coenzyme 010 is considered as a generally accepted\n\n\n\n\n:\n             effective therapy, although it may not ultimately be effective for an individual patient. Other treatments may be effective\n             in one disorder but not in others. Because of the varied nature of mitochondrial diseases some therapies may be\n             helpful in many, but not in all patients and therefore cannot be considered as ''proven and effective.\" Some treatments\n             should only be undertaken under the specific guidance of your physician. For specific information about the\n\n\n\n\n•'•\n             controversy, as it relates to your or your child's situation, ask your physician.

However, recognizing what may be stressful for patients allows one to\n        adjust the lifestyle. Many patients and their parents have already identified these stresses, despite not knowing why\n        the stresses were important, and avoid them_\n\n        Cold Stress is extremely important. Thermal regulation (temperature control) is not always normal in people with\n        mitochondrial diseases and exposure to cold can result in severe heat loss and trigger an energy crisis. When going\n        out. into the cold, all exposed body parts should be covered, and exposure to extreme cold should be avoided for\n        anything more than a short period. Over bundling can be a problem too (see below).\n\n        Heat Stress can be a problem in some people. This is especially true of those with an inability to sweat normally_ Heat\n        exhaustion and heat stroke may occur on hot days. It is typical for parents to describe that their child seems to ''wilt\" in\n        situations like hot classrooms or direct sunlight, whereas the other children function normally_ Light clothing is\n        important Patients should avoid direct sunlight on hot days and stay indoors if it is too warm outside_ An air·\n        conditioned environment may be needed.\n\n\n\n\n:       Starvation -avoid fasting_\n\n        Lack of sleep may possibly be harmful.\n        *Back to Top·~\n\n\n\n\n!       http://'Www.mitoaction.org/files/MitoToxins O.pdf\n        Pharmacologic Category Toxin Action Symptoms 1\n        .

There is a lot of data that suggests adults with low vita min-D levels are at risk for diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and a lot of\n                        cancers, and if kids start out with low levels and never increase them,.they may be putting themselves at risk for developing all of these diseases at a much eartier age.\"\n\n\n\n\n            ••          Vitamin Dis often called the \"sunshine vitamin\" because the human body makes it only when exposed to sunlight- although it only takes 10 to 15 minutes a day to make an adequate\n                        amount. Vitamin D, which helps the bones better absorb calcium, is also added to multivitamins and milk .\n\n                        In Melamed's study, the researchers looked at the vitamin D levels of more than 6,000 people ages 1 to 21.

(Children with darker skin are more likely to be\n                        deficient in vitamin D because they have more melanin than their fairer counterparts. Melanin is the pigment that gives skin color, but it may prevent the skin from absorbing enough\n                        sunlight to produce an adequate amount of vitamin D.)

Guerrero indicated he would feed M.G. and Lydia could go back to sleep.

James woke up at approximately 6:45a.m., but went back to sleep\n\n                on the living room couch. Lydia and Guerrero left at 9:45 a.m. for a meeting at J.G.'s new\n\n\n\n    ,.,.•       preschool. Cheryl and J.G. got out of bed at approximately l 0:15 a.m. M.G. woke up at about the\n\n                same time, and James got him from his crib. M.G. was crying constantly. Although James changed\n\n                M.G.'s diaper and attempted to feed M.G., he continued to cry. James thought M.G. was having a\n\n    ••    ••    reaction to the vaccinations. He called Lydia and asked her to buy some Children's Tylenol and\n\n                indicated he thought M.G: needed to see a doctor.          Cheryl then changed M.G.'s clothes in\n\n          •••   preparation for the visit to the doctor's office. M.G. cried constantly while Cheryl changed his\n\n\n         ••     clothes .\n\n\n        ••              When Guerrero and Lydia put M.G. into the car for the trip to Breeze's office, they noticed\n\n\n\n       ••       he was not using his left hand. Breeze ordered an x-ray of M.G.'s arm. The x-ray showed M.G. had\n\n                a broken humerus in his left arm and two broken ribs. ln Breeze's opinion, the broken humerus\n\n      ••        occurred within twelve hours of M.G. arriving at her office. According to Breeze, it takes a\n\n\n     ••         significant force to break the humerus. The break, along with the rib fractures, caused her to suspect\n\n\n\n    ••          abuse as the cause ofthe injuries. Breeze instructed Guerrero and Lydia to take M.G. to Children's\n\n                Medial Center.\n\n   ••                   Dr. Suzanne Dakil testified that, in August 2009, she was a pediatrician working in the\n\n\n  ••            Referral and Evaluation of At Risk Children program at Children's and evaluated M.G. at the\n\n\n\n\n~\n ••                                                               ...,\n                                                                -.)-\n\n\n\n\n••\n\f    ·,·•\n          •••       hospital. According to Dakil, the break of M.G.'s humerus had occurred within a \"day or two''\n            ••••\n          ·,·••     because there was no healing shown on the x-ray. The x-ray also showed healing fractures of the\n\n                    right lateral second through sixth ribs and of the left lateral second through fourth and sixth and\n\n\n\n           '•••;.   seventh ribs. These healing tractures were probably ten to fourteen days old. On September 9, 2009,\n\n                    additional x-rays were taken of M.G. These x-rays showed two additional healing fractures of the\n\n\n             •••    left eighth and ninth ribs. According to Dakil, these fractures were likely very new when M.G. was\n\n\n\n            ••      admitted into the hospital on August 26th and could not be seen until they had begun to heal. The\n\n\n\n           ••       two new fractures could have occurred at the same time as the broken arm. Dakil testified there were\n\n                    twelve total rib fractures that occurred at two ditTerent times .\n\n\n          ••                 Dakil testified a baby handles pain better than an adult. However, an infant will not tolerate\n\n\n         ••         the movement of a fracture. Dakil assumes the baby feels acute pain at the time the fracture occurs .\n\n\n\n        ••          However, if the baby is placed in a position where he is not moving, the baby will be tine until the\n\n                    fracture is moved again. If an adult is holding the baby or changing a diaper or clothes, the pain will\n\n\n       ••           be exquisite and the \"child will let you know.\" However, if the adult lays the baby down, the baby\n\n\n      ••            will be fine .\n\n\n\n     ••                     Dakil testified a broken humerus is a very rare injury and, in children under nine months of\n\n                    age, is almost always caused by abuse. Either a direct perpendicular blow to the arm or a direct\n\n     ••             bending of the arm is necessary to cause a transverse fracture of this long bone. Generally, the rib\n\n\n    ••              fractures are caused by compression, such as squeezing the ribs or pushing the ribs against a hard\n\n\n\n   ••               surface. The ribs are not easy to break and a \"good force\" is necessary to cause the fractures.

Lucas is 14 years old and came in with his grandmother for discussion of genetic\n                      testing. My overall impression was that Lucas has a moderate form ofEhlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) type I\n\n\n            ••        characterized by tall stature, hypermobility, arthralgia, and some symptoms of paroxysmal orthostatic\n                      tachycardia syndrome (POTS). I had inquired of the GeneDx company what the family self-pay would be for\n                      exome sequencing that examines all23,000 human genes, and they responded that the family would have\n\n\n           ••         minimal out-of-pocket costs. I will now resend their new insurance information to confirm full insurance\n                      coverage, and we will try to arrange the exome test for Lucas, his mother in Flower Mound, and his father\n                      who is incarcerated in Tennessee Colony Texas. I will send a follow-up letter when we have the out-of-pocket\n\n\n          ••          estimates with potential blood draw mechanisms for the parents .\n\n                      PAST MEDICAL IDSTORY: I had previously documented the history of several infantile fractures which\n\n\n         ••           resulted in placement with his grandmother since age 1 year. He had some development delays with need for ECI\n                      that may have reflected healing from fractures since he has done well in school until recently. He had some physical\n                      therapy at age 8-9 years and he has had normal language. Symptoms such as joint popping, arthralgias, fractures in\n\n\n        ••\n                      his L foot, and stomach issues suggestive of IBS suggest the diagnosis ofEDS, and some urologic issues along with\n                      dry eyes have suggested POTS along with dizziness on standing, hypotension, enjoyment of salty foods, occasional\n                      fatigue and \"brain fog,\" the latter possibly accounting for some school difficulties. He was told that he has collapsed\n\n\n\n       ••\n                      arch~s in his feet.\n\n\n                      FAMILY IDSTORY: The previously documented family history indicates that Lucas has half-brothers Jacob and\n\n\n\n      ••\n                      Matthew, the latter with early fractures that in 2009 resulted in his father having criminal charges of child abuse\n                      with incarceration. Grandmother (mother of the three boys' father), does not have contact with these other\n                      grandchildren, but thinks that Jacob may have had an arm fracture. Grandmother is a nurse working in dialysis and\n\n\n\n     ••\n                      has had several symptoms ofEDS-joint pains with flexibility, migraines, menorrhagia, and endometriosis. She has\n                      another son in addition to Lucas' father with joint issues and a daughter who has a son, age 9, with flexibility,\n                      asthma, and eczema.\n\n\n\n    ••                PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Lucas was 6-2 'l'2(90th centile for age) and weighed 163 lbs (50th centile for age)\n                      with a head circumference of22.5 inches (901h centile for age). He continues to grow rapidly (6-1 at his last visit)\n                      and has a slender, fit build that will help prevent wear-and-tear joint injury.\n\n\n   ••                 H EENT: Normal hair pattern and texture with normal head shape; normal facial appearance with no subtle\n                      anomalies of the eyes, ears, or jaw..\n                      Back: Mild dextroscoliosis in thoracolumbar region with angle of about 5 degrees.\n\n\n  ••                  Extremities: Normal proportions with normal palmar creases. I previously documented moderately increased joint\n                      laxity with Beighton hypermobility scale of 5-6/9). He has long fingers and the thumb-little finger overlap around\n                      wrist (Walker-Murdoch) and thumb through fist (Hoffinan) signs were positive.\n\n\n ••                   Skin: Soft texture with hyperelasticity sufficient to give a 1 inch fold on his forearm .\n                      Neuro: No focal neurologic deficits. He is very interactive and conversational with obvious normal intelligence. He\n                      has good coordination and balance as judged by tandem walk\n\n\n••\n•\n\f               ••\n              ••\n                                                                    RE: Lucas Guerrero BD: 9-4-1999\n\n\n\n\n              ••     IMPRESSION: My impression remains that Lucas has a moderate form ofEhlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) type I\n                     with evidence for skeletal, gastrointestinal and vascular changes. I cannot exclude a form ofMarfan syndrome\n                     although he has not yet had any aortic or cardiac changes, but the type IV EDS syndrome is unlikely since he does\n\n\n              ••     not have a pinched lower face or translucent skin .\n\n                     RECOMMENDATIONS: I will recontact the GeneDx company to ascertain what the self-pay costs would be for\n\n\n            ••       exome sequencing (list price fo $9000) based on their new insurance.

Lucas is 14 years old and came in with his grandmother for evaluation of a possible\n                               connective tissue dysplasia. My overall impression is that Lucas has a moderate form ofEhlers-\n\n\n            ••                 Danlos syndrome (EDS) type I characterized by hypermobility, arthralgia, and some symptoms of\n                               paroxysmal orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). I will inquire of the Gene Ox company what\n                               the family self-pay would be for exome sequencing that examines all 23,000 human genes and has the\n\n\n            ••                 best chance to define a mutation in one ofthe >100 genes implicated in connective tissue dysplasias or\n                               dysautonomia.

He was bottle-fed with some early feeding difficulties and there was a question\n\n\n          ••                   of tears in the cornea at one point. At age 2 months he was removed from parental custody after an arm\n                               fracture and others in multiple stages of healing were found-apparently vitamin D deficiency was also\n                               questioned.

He had some muscle weakness that needed physical\n\n\n\n        ••\n                               t}:lerapy at age 8-9 years and he has had nonnall~nguage .\n\n                              His muscle weakness may have reflected limitation from joint pain as he has popping joints and arthralgias,\n\n\n\n       ••\n                              particularly in his shoulders. He has been in a boot twice for stress fractures in his L foot. His most severe\n                              symptoms are likely due to ms with severe stomach issues at ages 4-5 years after GE reflux as a baby. He\n                              has chronic constipation and Dr. Russo performed a normal endoscopy and biopsy. Also potentially related\n                              to dysautonomia are urology issues with need for stents in his ureters and an episode of urosepsis. He also\n\n\n      ••                      has had significant vision issues with dry eyes and poor vision evaluated at age 6-7 years.

Wilson\n             What is EDS? Ehlers and Danlos were dermatologists who in the early 1900s descnbed a syndrome (pattern) caused by lax\n\n\n      ••     connective tissue highlighted by patients with hyperelastic skin. In 1977, Dr. Peter Beighton organized intervening literature by\n             postulating 7 EDS types, with type I involving skeletal problems plus extended complications of the bowel and circulatory system,\n             type II showing mainly hypermobility, type III having hypermobility with many stretch marks, and type IV with tight lower facies,\n\n\n       ••    thin aged skin, and lethal vessel ruptures. Types V-VII are more localized and rare, affecting gums or producing odd skin lesions .\n             Type IV was erroneously called the \"vascular\" type even though all forms ofEDS can have flexible and fragile blood vessels. Many\n             physicians and geneticists continue to view EDS as a group of rare specific types, but my experience teaches that hypermobility\n\n\n     ••      disorders and EDS comprise a spectrum that is as common as diabetes. Most individuals have only hypermobility, a trait that they\n             take for granted and become aware of only when they have frequent sprains or wear-and-tear arthritis. Others have more severe\n             symptoms that can be disabling but not life-threatening, and the clinical diagnosis ofEDS emphasizes that patients have a true\n\n\n     ••      condition and that their anxiety, fatigue, and chronic pain are real symptoms rather than \"in their minds\" or branding them as\n             hypochondriacs. The Inspire website (https://www.inspire.com/groups/ehlers-danlos-national-foundationl) is an excellent and patient-\n             oriented source of information.\n\n\n\n     ••      Rarer, extreme'forms·'ofEDS-reflect single gencf(autosoin'al dominant)inheritante:-The severe types ofEDS along with other\n            members of the connective tissue dysplasia category like Marfan syndrome (exemplified by an Abe Lincoln build) or osteogenesis\n                                                                                                                                                --\n\n\n\n\n     ••\n            imperfecta (OI or brittle bone disease) exhibit autosomal dominant inheritance, meaning that affected individuals have one normal and\n            one abnormal gene. The abnormal gene dominates to cause connective tissue laxity-both genes make protein with the abnormal gene\n            making a deformed protein that interacts with the normal protein like bricks in a wall. The deformed brick (protein) makes the wall\n            wobbly and weak, translating to weaker and flexible skin, joints, and blood vessel walls. Severe forms ofEDS and related conditions\n\n\n   ••       can be diagnosed by targeted DNA testing-fibrillin gene testing for those with obvious Marfan syndrome, collagen type ill testing\n            for those with obvious EDS type IV. collagen I testing for those with obvious 01.\n\n\n\n    ••      Most EDS cases are cause by multiple genes and comprise a spectrum: Most patients with EDS exhibit overlapping symptoms of\n            joint popping/dislocation/injury with later arthritis, soft and elastic skin with unusual scars and bruising, migraines, heavy periods with\n            endometriosis, and dysautonomia (altered function of the autonomic nervous system) with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and\n\n\n  ••        paroxysmal orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). In EDS, POTS is due to pooling of blood in lower extremities when standing\n            with dizziness, fainting, fatigue, and \"brain fog\" (intervals of decreased focus and memory). Diagnosis ofEDS among many causes of\n            dysautonomia allows therapy by increasing intravascular volume with hydration and salt to increase brain perfusion. Patients with\n\n\n  ••        broader symptoms are likely to have multiple gene changes compatible with multifactorial causation.\n\n            EDS remains a clinical diagnosis: As of now the diagnosis ofEDS is clinical in most cases, meaning documentation of typical\n\n\n   ••       histories and physical findings (tall stature, lean build, hypermobility, skin elasticity). Patients can be grouped as hypermobile EDS\n            (REDS) or classical (CEDS with broad symptoms) but this is greatly oversimplified, as are the 7 types described by Beighton. I tend\n            to group patients with only skeletal symptoms as type II or ill (with associated stretch marks/scarring) and those with broader\n\n\n\n   ••\n            symptoms as type I. Since over 40 genes have been implicated in EDS, we can anticipate over 40 types with overlapping symptoms\n            when DNA testing of multiple genes becomes routine. At present the clinical diagnosis of connective tissue dysplasia or EDS\n            spectrum disorder is reasonable since it will guide patients and physicians to anticipate a broad range of medical complications and\n\n\n\n   ••\n            refute assumptions about mental illness or hypochondriasis .. The many possible gene changes make single gene (DNA) testing oflow\n            yield except in cases with obvious Marfan or EDS IV.\n\n\n\n\n  ••\n            Gene testing for EDS: Three levels of gene (DNA) testing include I) testing for Marfan and related Loeys-Dietz syndromes through\n            LabCorp (-$1600 and usually covered by insurance), 2) a 12-gene panel including Marfan, EDS type IV, and other rare forms ($3600\n            with guaranteed maximal $100 self-pay over insurance through the GeneDx company), and 3) exome sequencing examining the exons\n            (protein-coding regions)ofall23,000 genes in our genome (rapid parallel/(NextGen sequencing of parent-child trios for $9000\n\n\n   ••       through GeneDx with guaranteed max of$1000 self-pay over insurance). For the latter test, I can send insurance information to\n            GeneDx to ascertain each family's self-pay amount which sometimes is much less than $1000. Sadly, most genetic testing is not\n            covered by Medicaid or Medicare. Even a positive gene test may not lead to different therapy or management.\n\n\n  ••        EDS therapies: Arthritis is due to joint hypermobility with wear-and-tear injury (osteoarthritis), not from inflammation like\n            rheumatoid arthritis or that due to lupus and other rheumatic diseases.

I was able to obtain whole exome sequencing\n             (WES) that examines all 23,000 genes and I now attach results of this testing that show a mutation\n\n ••          affecting the mitochondrial MT-COl gene that encodes one of many proteins that constitute a subunit of\n             cytochrome C oxidase, also known as Complex IV. The mutation changes the amino acid threonine (T)\n\n\n ••\n             to methionine: (M) at position 31 of the MT-CO 1 protein (p. T31 M), and is present in 40% of Lucas'\n             mitochondria (he thus has mixtures ofmutant and normal mitochondria in his cells, something called\n             heteroplasmy). This mut..1.tion was present in Lucas' mother at a lower level ofheteroplasmy. and has not\n\n\n ••          been observed in DNA databases from nonnal individuals-it is thus is not a common benign variation .\n             The report classifies it as a variant of unk11own significance. but I have now seen at least 6 patients with\n             EDs-dysautonomia symptoms that have mitochondrial mutations, and the essential role of mitochondrial\n\n••           complexlY in energy metabolism, particularly important in the brain, l1eart, nerve, and muscle, leads me\n             to suspect that such mitochondrial mutations a1·e a cause of AAD-EDS symptoms.\n\n\n  ••         It is likely that Lucas' half-brothers, at least one having early fractures that can occur with AAD-EDS,\n             have the same mitochondrial mutation from their mother since women pass on the mitochondria to all\n\n\n ••          children. We cannot predict the fraction of their mutant mitochondria compared to the 40% in Lucas .\n             Supporting the relevance ofthe mitochondrial MT-COl mutation to'AAD-EDS symptoms is the fact\n             that the matemal grandmother has some of these symptoms, likely havil1g the same MT-C01 mutation\n\n\n  ••         and passing it on to her daughter. Relatives could have testing for the particular MT-COI mutation at a\n             cost of $350 each, and this could be coordinated by Ms. Alderd1ce of the GeneDx company.\n\n\n   ••         These results do exclude severe forms·of cmmective tissue dysplasia such as Marfau syndrome, Ehlers-·\n              Danlos: syndrome type IV, or osteogenesis imperfecta since those genes were well-covered by the exome\n\n\n   ••         technology. The results also excluded mutations in 56 genes such as the breast-ovarian cancer/BRCA\n              genes, tenned incidental findings because they may not be related to the indication for testing. The latter\n              genes were screened in Lucas but not in his mother since only mutations found in his mother would be\n\n    ••        examined in her relatives .\n\n              I would emphasize that the there could be additional gene mutations contributihg to AAD.:.EDS\n\n     ••       symptoms in Lucas and his half. brothers that were not recognized by-this new WES teclmology.

There are also many human genes that do not have known functions\n          and/or have not been correlated with human disease~·-mutations in these genes may not be called as\n          disease. related by the computer software that examines the over 600 million DNA nucleotides (AGCT\n          letters) documented by whole exome sequencing. Finally, although most genes are covered from 90 to\n          97% of their length by the sequencing, some gene regions are not examined and thus mutations can be\n          missed. Because WES is a recent advance, additional studies on patients with connective tissue laxity\n          are certain to uncover more genes related to this disease spectnun. That 1s why GeneDx keeps a\n          database of new gene discoveries, updating prior patient repm1s if they have such mutations. The\n          company also offers to reanalyze the sequencing results every 3.4 years so that new gene discoveries\n          can be incorporated into the computer software.\n\n          I would still consider Lucas to have a diagnosis ofEDS-dysautonomia, now better described as AAD-\n          EDS because my genetic data is showing that any part of the joint (articulation)--skin, nerve, muscle,\n          bone, joint tissue, blood vessel~~can be impacted to cause the same pattem of symptoms (see\n          attachment). His clinical profile would fit with EDS type I or classic type since his hype1mobility is not\n\n!.        as dramatic as with EDS type III, although the types are being outdated by the new sequencing results.\n          Most importat1t is for Lucas and by implicatio11 his half:.brothers to follow joint protection and 11utrition\n\n\n\n•:        strategies in the attaclm1ent.

Cigarette smoke, probably due to\n             the carbon monoxide, is known to hasten the progression of some conditions. Remember that carbon monoxide kills\n             by inhibiting complex IV of OXPHOS, why make it worse? Cigarette smoke will make it worse.\n\n             MSG\n             MSG (monosodium glutamate) has for years been known to cause migraine headaches in otherwise healthy\n             individuals, and may trigger these events in susceptible people with mitochondrial disease. MSG is frequently added\n             to Chinese (and other Asian) foods, and is also found in high levels of dried and canned soup. Read the label and\n             avoid MSG if there is any sensitivity.\n             \"'Back to Top*\n\n             Vitamins and Cofactors\n             Vitamins and cofactors are compounds that are required in order for the chemical reactions, which make energy, to run\n             efficiently. By definition, a cofactor can be made by the body, whereas a vitamin cannot, and therefore must be eaten.\n             For most people, a regular diet contains aU the vitamins one could possibly need and their bodies can make as much\n             of any specific cofactor that it needs. For those with mitochondrial disorders, added vitamins and cofactors may be\n             useful.                                                                                                         ·\n             The use of supplemental vitamins and cofactors is largely unproven and their use is therefore controversial in patients\n             with mitochondrial diseases. For disorders of OXPHOS, coenzyme 010 is considered as a generally accepted\n\n\n\n\n:\n             effective therapy, although it may not ultimately be effective for an individual patient. Other treatments may be effective\n             in one disorder but not in others. Because of the varied nature of mitochondrial diseases some therapies may be\n             helpful in many, but not in all patients and therefore cannot be considered as ''proven and effective.\" Some treatments\n             should only be undertaken under the specific guidance of your physician.

However, recognizing what may be stressful for patients allows one to\n        adjust the lifestyle. Many patients and their parents have already identified these stresses, despite not knowing why\n        the stresses were important, and avoid them_\n\n        Cold Stress is extremely important. Thermal regulation (temperature control) is not always normal in people with\n        mitochondrial diseases and exposure to cold can result in severe heat loss and trigger an energy crisis. When going\n        out. into the cold, all exposed body parts should be covered, and exposure to extreme cold should be avoided for\n        anything more than a short period. Over bundling can be a problem too (see below).\n\n        Heat Stress can be a problem in some people. This is especially true of those with an inability to sweat normally_ Heat\n        exhaustion and heat stroke may occur on hot days. It is typical for parents to describe that their child seems to ''wilt\" in\n        situations like hot classrooms or direct sunlight, whereas the other children function normally_ Light clothing is\n        important Patients should avoid direct sunlight on hot days and stay indoors if it is too warm outside_ An air·\n        conditioned environment may be needed.\n\n\n\n\n:       Starvation -avoid fasting_\n\n        Lack of sleep may possibly be harmful.\n        *Back to Top·~\n\n\n\n\n!       http://'Www.mitoaction.org/files/MitoToxins O.pdf\n        Pharmacologic Category Toxin Action Symptoms 1\n        .

There is a lot of data that suggests adults with low vita min-D levels are at risk for diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and a lot of\n                        cancers, and if kids start out with low levels and never increase them,.they may be putting themselves at risk for developing all of these diseases at a much eartier age.\"\n\n\n\n\n            ••          Vitamin Dis often called the \"sunshine vitamin\" because the human body makes it only when exposed to sunlight- although it only takes 10 to 15 minutes a day to make an adequate\n                        amount. Vitamin D, which helps the bones better absorb calcium, is also added to multivitamins and milk .\n\n                        In Melamed's study, the researchers looked at the vitamin D levels of more than 6,000 people ages 1 to 21.

(Children with darker skin are more likely to be\n                        deficient in vitamin D because they have more melanin than their fairer counterparts. Melanin is the pigment that gives skin color, but it may prevent the skin from absorbing enough\n                        sunlight to produce an adequate amount of vitamin D.)

Guerrero indicated he would feed M.G. and Lydia could go back to sleep.

James woke up at approximately 6:45a.m., but went back to sleep\n\n                on the living room couch. Lydia and Guerrero left at 9:45 a.m. for a meeting at J.G.'s new\n\n\n\n    ,.,.•       preschool. Cheryl and J.G. got out of bed at approximately l 0:15 a.m. M.G. woke up at about the\n\n                same time, and James got him from his crib. M.G. was crying constantly. Although James changed\n\n                M.G.'s diaper and attempted to feed M.G., he continued to cry. James thought M.G. was having a\n\n    ••    ••    reaction to the vaccinations. He called Lydia and asked her to buy some Children's Tylenol and\n\n                indicated he thought M.G: needed to see a doctor.          Cheryl then changed M.G.'s clothes in\n\n          •••   preparation for the visit to the doctor's office. M.G. cried constantly while Cheryl changed his\n\n\n         ••     clothes .\n\n\n        ••              When Guerrero and Lydia put M.G. into the car for the trip to Breeze's office, they noticed\n\n\n\n       ••       he was not using his left hand. Breeze ordered an x-ray of M.G.'s arm. The x-ray showed M.G. had\n\n                a broken humerus in his left arm and two broken ribs. ln Breeze's opinion, the broken humerus\n\n      ••        occurred within twelve hours of M.G. arriving at her office. According to Breeze, it takes a\n\n\n     ••         significant force to break the humerus. The break, along with the rib fractures, caused her to suspect\n\n\n\n    ••          abuse as the cause ofthe injuries. Breeze instructed Guerrero and Lydia to take M.G. to Children's\n\n                Medial Center.\n\n   ••                   Dr. Suzanne Dakil testified that, in August 2009, she was a pediatrician working in the\n\n\n  ••            Referral and Evaluation of At Risk Children program at Children's and evaluated M.G. at the\n\n\n\n\n~\n ••                                                               ...,\n                                                                -.)-\n\n\n\n\n••\n\f    ·,·•\n          •••       hospital. According to Dakil, the break of M.G.'s humerus had occurred within a \"day or two''\n            ••••\n          ·,·••     because there was no healing shown on the x-ray. The x-ray also showed healing fractures of the\n\n                    right lateral second through sixth ribs and of the left lateral second through fourth and sixth and\n\n\n\n           '•••;.   seventh ribs. These healing tractures were probably ten to fourteen days old. On September 9, 2009,\n\n                    additional x-rays were taken of M.G. These x-rays showed two additional healing fractures of the\n\n\n             •••    left eighth and ninth ribs. According to Dakil, these fractures were likely very new when M.G. was\n\n\n\n            ••      admitted into the hospital on August 26th and could not be seen until they had begun to heal. The\n\n\n\n           ••       two new fractures could have occurred at the same time as the broken arm. Dakil testified there were\n\n                    twelve total rib fractures that occurred at two ditTerent times .\n\n\n          ••                 Dakil testified a baby handles pain better than an adult. However, an infant will not tolerate\n\n\n         ••         the movement of a fracture. Dakil assumes the baby feels acute pain at the time the fracture occurs .\n\n\n\n        ••          However, if the baby is placed in a position where he is not moving, the baby will be tine until the\n\n                    fracture is moved again. If an adult is holding the baby or changing a diaper or clothes, the pain will\n\n\n       ••           be exquisite and the \"child will let you know.\" However, if the adult lays the baby down, the baby\n\n\n      ••            will be fine .\n\n\n\n     ••                     Dakil testified a broken humerus is a very rare injury and, in children under nine months of\n\n                    age, is almost always caused by abuse. Either a direct perpendicular blow to the arm or a direct\n\n     ••             bending of the arm is necessary to cause a transverse fracture of this long bone. Generally, the rib\n\n\n    ••              fractures are caused by compression, such as squeezing the ribs or pushing the ribs against a hard\n\n\n\n   ••               surface. The ribs are not easy to break and a \"good force\" is necessary to cause the fractures.
