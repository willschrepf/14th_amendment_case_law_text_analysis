By memorandum and order dated November 25,\n1995, the district court granted Rockwood's motion.        It stated:\n\n     This matter is before the Court on Rockwood School\n     District's motion, G(1778)95 and G(1779)95, for final\n     judgment pursuant to Section XII.D. of the Settlement\n     Agreement. Rockwood sets forth facts showing that in the\n     1991-92 school year, the requirements entitling Rockwood\n     to final judgment were met:     Rockwood's enrollment of\n     voluntary transfer students (VTS) was within 10% of its\n     plan ratio, and the total number of VTS in the\n     participating county districts exceeded what that number\n     would have been had all districts been precisely at their\n     plan ratios.\n\n(Appellants' Jt. App. at 206.)     The Caldwell plaintiffs, the NAACP, and the\nBoard of Education of the City of St. Louis appeal.    We affirm the judgment\nof the district court.\n\n\n     Both this court and the Supreme Court have consistently held that a\nfederal   district   court   has   broad   discretionary   powers   in   school\ndesegregation cases.     See, e.g., Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of\nEduc., 402 U.S. 1, 16 (1971); Liddell VII, 731 F.2d 1794 (8th Cir. 1984);\nLiddell v. Board of Educ., 822 F.2d 1446\n\n\n\n\n                                       8\n\f(8th Cir. 1987).   We believe the district court appropriately exercised its\ndiscretion in this case.    The final judgment is consistent with the purpose\nof the settlement agreement in that it provides the black transfer students\nfrom the City of St. Louis and the suburban students with an integrated\neducation; in the process, it also substantially reduces segregation in the\nSt. Louis public schools.\n\n\n     The significance of the district court and this court approving the\nfinal judgment is clear from the terms of the settlement agreement, which\nspecifically provides that after a school district receives an order\ngranting it final judgment, it has a continuing obligation to:\n\n     cooperate in the recruitment and promotion of transfers\n     under Sections 4a, c, f and h of the agreement in\n     principle as implemented by Sections II and IX hereof, to\n     accept transfer students under Section 1 of the agreement\n     in principle as implemented by Section II hereof, and to\n     participate in the magnet program established under\n     Section 2 of the agreement in principle as implemented by\n     Section III hereof in order to reach and maintain the\n     plan goal (25 percent).\n\n(Appellants' Jt. App. at 108 (emphasis added).)        This settlement agreement,\nas we have previously stated, has been approved by this court en banc.\nThus, Rockwood has a continuing obligation to abide by the terms of the\nsettlement agreement, the State of Missouri has a continuing obligation to\nfund the transfers of black students from St. Louis to Rockwood, and the\ndistrict court has an obligation to actively supervise the interdistrict\nobligations of Rockwood until November 25, 1997.\n\n\n     On April 23, 1996, the district court referred the question of the\nState's   continuing   obligation   to       fund   various   components   of   the\ndesegregation remedy, including the interdistrict transfer component, to\na settlement coordinator, Dr. William H. Danforth.            Dr. Danforth has yet\nto submit his report and recommendations to\n\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\fthe district court.   Until this is done and the report is either accepted,\nrejected, or modified by the district court and until a decision has been\nmade by the parties with respect to whether they will or will not appeal\nto this court from the final decision of the district court, we will not\nanticipate our decision on the matter.    Accordingly, we affirm the decision\nof the district court as it grants Rockwood a final judgment and affirm the\ncontinuing obligation of the parties as stated above.\n\n\n     A true copy.\n\n\n         Attest:\n\n\n              CLERK, U. S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                                     10\n\f",

By memorandum and order dated November 25,\n1995, the district court granted Rockwood's motion.        It stated:\n\n     This matter is before the Court on Rockwood School\n     District's motion, G(1778)95 and G(1779)95, for final\n     judgment pursuant to Section XII.D. of the Settlement\n     Agreement. Rockwood sets forth facts showing that in the\n     1991-92 school year, the requirements entitling Rockwood\n     to final judgment were met:     Rockwood's enrollment of\n     voluntary transfer students (VTS) was within 10% of its\n     plan ratio, and the total number of VTS in the\n     participating county districts exceeded what that number\n     would have been had all districts been precisely at their\n     plan ratios.\n\n(Appellants' Jt. App. at 206.)     The Caldwell plaintiffs, the NAACP, and the\nBoard of Education of the City of St. Louis appeal.    We affirm the judgment\nof the district court.\n\n\n     Both this court and the Supreme Court have consistently held that a\nfederal   district   court   has   broad   discretionary   powers   in   school\ndesegregation cases.

We believe the district court appropriately exercised its\ndiscretion in this case.    The final judgment is consistent with the purpose\nof the settlement agreement in that it provides the black transfer students\nfrom the City of St. Louis and the suburban students with an integrated\neducation; in the process, it also substantially reduces segregation in the\nSt. Louis public schools.\n\n\n     The significance of the district court and this court approving the\nfinal judgment is clear from the terms of the settlement agreement, which\nspecifically provides that after a school district receives an order\ngranting it final judgment, it has a continuing obligation to:\n\n     cooperate in the recruitment and promotion of transfers\n     under Sections 4a, c, f and h of the agreement in\n     principle as implemented by Sections II and IX hereof, to\n     accept transfer students under Section 1 of the agreement\n     in principle as implemented by Section II hereof, and to\n     participate in the magnet program established under\n     Section 2 of the agreement in principle as implemented by\n     Section III hereof in order to reach and maintain the\n     plan goal (25 percent).\n\n(Appellants' Jt. App. at 108 (emphasis added).)        This settlement agreement,\nas we have previously stated, has been approved by this court en banc.\nThus, Rockwood has a continuing obligation to abide by the terms of the\nsettlement agreement, the State of Missouri has a continuing obligation to\nfund the transfers of black students from St. Louis to Rockwood, and the\ndistrict court has an obligation to actively supervise the interdistrict\nobligations of Rockwood until November 25, 1997.\n\n\n     On April 23, 1996, the district court referred the question of the\nState's   continuing   obligation   to       fund   various   components   of   the\ndesegregation remedy, including the interdistrict transfer component, to\na settlement coordinator, Dr. William H. Danforth.            Dr. Danforth has yet\nto submit his report and recommendations to\n\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\fthe district court.   Until this is done and the report is either accepted,\nrejected, or modified by the district court and until a decision has been\nmade by the parties with respect to whether they will or will not appeal\nto this court from the final decision of the district court, we will not\nanticipate our decision on the matter.    Accordingly, we affirm the decision\nof the district court as it grants Rockwood a final judgment and affirm the\ncontinuing obligation of the parties as stated above.\n\n\n     A true copy.\n\n\n         Attest:\n\n\n              CLERK, U.
