          "plain_text": "In the\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFor the Seventh Circuit\n\nNo. 01-1559\n\nJames Carl Higgs,\n\nPlaintiff-Appellant,\n\nv.\n\nWilliam E. Carver and James M. Wolfe,\n\nDefendants-Appellees.\n\nAppeal from the United States District Court\nfor the Southern District of Indiana, New Albany Division.\nNo. 99-148-C-H/G--David F. Hamilton, Judge.\n\nSubmitted February 21, 2002--Decided April 1, 2002\n\n\n\n  Before Posner, Easterbrook, and Ripple,\nCircuit Judges.\n\n  Posner, Circuit Judge. This prisoner’s\ncivil rights suit raises a multitude of\nclaims, but only two have sufficient\nmerit to warrant discussion.\n\n  While a pretrial detainee in an Indiana\ncounty jail, Higgs got into a fight with\nanother inmate and was placed in\n\"lockdown segregation,\" a form of\nsolitary confinement. He filed a\ngrievance with the jail authorities, who\nten days after he had been placed in\nlockdown segregation wrote him that he\nhad been \"placed on lockdown for\nrepeatedly threatening and harassing\nother inmates and has continued on\nlockdown as he has repeatedly cussed and\nattempted to intimidate correction\nstaff.\" His request for a hearing was\ndenied, and he spent a total of 34 days\nin segregation before being allowed to\nrejoin the general jail population.\n\n  A pretrial detainee cannot be placed in\nsegregation as a punishment for a\ndisciplinary infraction without notice\nand an opportunity to be heard; due\nprocess requires no less. Rapier v.\nHarris, 172 F.3d 999, 1004-05 (7th Cir.\n1999); Mitchell v. Dupnik, 75 F.3d 517,\n524-25 (9th Cir. 1996). But no process is\nrequired if he is placed in segregation\n\fnot as punishment but for managerial\nreasons. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520,\n535-41 (1979); Rapier v. Harris, supra,\n172 F.3d at 1002-06; Fuentes v. Wagner,\n206 F.3d 335, 341-42 (3d Cir. 2000).\nSuppose for example that the only vacant\ncell left in the jail was in the\nsegregation ward when a new prisoner\narrived; placing him in that cell would\nbe a managerial decision. Or suppose,\ncoming a little closer to this case, that\na prisoner was placed under particularly\nrestrictive conditions of confinement at\nthe jail because he was considered a\nsuicide risk. Again, no hearing would be\nrequired. Myers v. County of Lake, 30\nF.3d 847, 850 (7th Cir. 1994); Anderson\nv. County of Kern, 45 F.3d 1310, 1314-15\n(9th Cir. 1995). Ditto if he was placed\nin segregation to protect himself from\nother prisoners, or to protect jail staff\nfrom his violent propensities. Bell v.\nWolfish, supra, 441 U.S. at 547; Anderson\nv. County of Kern, supra, 45 F.3d at\n1314; Olgin v. Darnell, 664 F.2d 107, 109\n(5th Cir. 1981). As long as the purpose\nwas indeed a preventive rather than a\npunitive one, he would not be entitled to\nnotice and a hearing. Indeed a jail’s\nfailure to take steps to prevent harm to\nthe prisoner or to other prisoners might\ngive rise to meritorious suits against\nthe jail. See, e.g., Swofford v.\nMandrell, 969 F.2d 547, 549-50 (7th Cir.\n1992). In none of these cases would a\nhearing be practicable, or even useful,\nbecause managerial decisions do not have\nthe character of rulings applying legal\nstandards to facts, the kind of rulings\nfor which adjudicative hearings are\ndesigned.\n\n  Unfortunately we cannot determine from\nthe record whether Higgs was placed in\nlockdown segregation for preventive\npurposes or as punishment. The statement\nof the jail authorities that we quoted is\nthe only evidence, apart from the\nunexplained length of his detention;\nthere is no evidence on why 34 days\nrather than 24 or 44. And the statement\nis ambiguous; its wording is equally\nconsistent with a punitive purpose and\nwith a preventive purpose. The case must\nbe remanded for further proceedings on\nthis question.\n\n  And on another as well, the plaintiff’s\nclaim that he has been a victim of\nretaliation. In his amended complaint,\n\fHiggs charged that after bringing this\nsuit he was again placed in lockdown\nsegregation, for 11 days, to \"punish\" him\nfor filing the suit. The district court\ndismissed this part of the complaint for\nfailure to state a claim, on the ground\nthat the allegation of retaliation was\n\"conclusory\" and that Higgs had \"not\nalleged a chronology of events from which\nretaliation can be inferred.\" But as the\nSupreme Court and this court have\nemphasized, there are no special pleading\nrules for prisoner civil rights cases.\nSwierkiewicz v. Sorema, 122 S. Ct. 992,\n998-99 (2002); Leatherman v. Tarrant\nCounty Narcotics Intelligence &\nCoordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163, 168\n(1993); Kyle v. Morton High School, 144\nF.3d 448, 455 (7th Cir. 1998) (per\ncuriam). A complaint that complies with\nthe federal rules of civil procedure\ncannot be dismissed on the ground that it\nis conclusory or fails to allege facts.\nThe federal rules require (with\nirrelevant exceptions) only that the\ncomplaint state a claim, not that it\nplead the facts that if true would\nestablish (subject to any defenses) that\nthe claim was valid. Nance v. Vieregge,\n147 F.3d 589, 590-91 (7th Cir. 1998). All\nthat need be specified is the bare\nminimum facts necessary to put the\ndefendant on notice of the claim so that\nhe can file an answer. Beanstalk Group,\nInc. v. AM General Corp., No. 01-2164,\n2002 WL 406985, at *6 (7th Cir. March 15,\n2002). \"All that’s required to state a\nclaim in a complaint filed in a federal\ncourt is a short statement, in plain\n(that is, ordinary, nonlegalistic)\nEnglish, of the legal claim. . . . The\ncourts keep reminding plaintiffs that\nthey don’t have to file long complaints,\ndon’t have to plead facts, don’t have to\nplead legal theories.\" Kirksey v. R.J.\nReynolds Tobacco Co., 168 F.3d 1039, 1041\n(7th Cir. 1999). Had Higgs merely alleged\nthat the defendants had retaliated\nagainst him for filing a suit, without\nidentifying the suit or the act or acts\nclaimed to have constituted retaliation,\nthe complaint would be insufficient, cf.\nMuick v. Glenayre Electronics, 280 F.3d\n741, 743 (7th Cir. 2002), because the\ndefendants would not have known how\ntorespond. But Higgs specified both the\nsuit and the act of retaliation (namely\nplacing him in lockdown segregation for\n11 days), and this specification was\nenough to enable the defendants to file\n\fan answer. See, e.g., Johnson v. Stovall,\n233 F.3d 486, 489 (7th Cir. 2000). The\ndismissal for failure to state a claim\nwas therefore premature.\n\n  In all but these two respects, the\njudgment is affirmed.\n\nAffirmed in Part, Vacated in Part,\nand Remanded.\n\f",
