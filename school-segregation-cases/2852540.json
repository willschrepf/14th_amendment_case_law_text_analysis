Randa, Judge.\n\nArgued February 13, 2001--Decided September 21, 2001\n\n\n\n  Before Manion, Kanne, and Evans, Circuit\nJudges.\n\n  Kanne, Circuit Judge. Matt Sanville, a\nmentally ill inmate incarcerated at the\nWaupun Correctional Institution in\nWisconsin, committed suicide when he was\nleft unsupervised for approximately five\nhours. His mother, Martha Sanville, filed\nthis lawsuit in federal district court,\nalleging that a number of prison\nofficials violated Matt’s Eighth\nAmendment rights through their deliberate\nindifference to Matt’s/1 serious medical\nneeds. While we affirm the district\ncourt’s dismissal of plaintiff’s claims\nagainst the prison wardens and the\nmedical professionals who treated Matt,\nwe find that Mrs. Sanville has pleaded\nsufficient facts to survive a motion to\ndismiss her complaint against several\nprison guards. We thus affirm in part and\nreverse in part, and remand the remaining\nclaims for further proceedings.\n\nI.   History\n\f  Matt Sanville suffered, as do a\nsignificant number of prison inmates,\nfrom a serious mental health problem. At\nvarious times in his life, doctors\ndiagnosed Matt with major depressive\ndisorder, aggressive conduct disorder,\nbipolar disorder, dysthymic disorder,\nadjustment disorder, mixed personality\ndisorder, and manic depression. While\nthey might have disagreed as to Matt’s\nprecise medical condition, the doctors\nunanimously agreed that Matt needed to be\nmedicated to control his illness. His\nadult life was characterized by a history\nof suicide attempts, hospitalizations,\nand drug treatments directed towards\nmanaging his multiple mental disorders.\n\n  Matt did not agree that he needed to be\nmedicated and, during an unmedicated\nperiod in July 1997, he was arrested for\nassaulting his mother. When prosecutors\ncharged Matt with assault, his court-\nappointed attorney moved for a competency\nevaluation, which the state judge\nordered. The medical professional who\nexamined Matt, Harlan R. Heinz, Ph.D.,\nconcluded that he was \"significantly\ndepressed and acutely psychotic,\nrendering him incompetent to stand\ntrial.\" He also found that Matt 1)\n\"showed significant lack of insight by\nreporting his thinking was fine,\" 2) \"was\nnot able to make his needs known,\" and 3)\nwas \"not competent to refuse medication\nor treatment for his mental condition.\"\nMatt’s attorney agreed with this\nassessment and prepared an incompetency\ndefense.\n\n  Matt, however, would not admit his\nincompetency, and his first attorney\nwithdrew as a result. Matt’s second\nattorney acceded to Matt’s assessment of\nhis own competency and Matt was allowed\nto plead no contest to the battery\ncharge. His presentence investigation\nreport noted that Matt had received\nthirty conduct reports during his\nconfinement--for such infractions as\ncovering his cell light, plugging\ntoilets, and throwing feces and urine on\nstaff--all of which occurred while he was\nnot medicated. At sentencing on January\n5, 1998, Matt’s mother pleaded with the\ncourt not to send Matt to prison,\nasserting that he was not a danger as\nlong as he was medicated. The prosecutor\nconcurred, stating that he disagreed with\n\fthe PSI’s recommendation that Matt should\ngo to prison--he even went so far as to\nnote that \"I do not believe that sending\na person to the Wisconsin State Prison\nsystem is the best place to deal with a\nperson’s mental illness.\" Although the\nJudge noted that Matt was probably\nmentally ill, he sentenced him to the\nmaximum term in prison. Matt began\nserving his sentence at the Dodge\nCorrectional Institute (hereinafter\n\"Dodge\") on January 7, 1998.\n\n  Mrs. Sanville wrote a letter to the\nevaluator at Dodge explaining that Matt’s\nconduct was the result of mental illness\nand relaying the opinions conveyed about\nMatt’s mental health during the court\nproceedings. On Matt’s second day at\nDodge, Dr. Carl L. Cihlar, the first of\nthe doctor-defendants, performed an\nintake screening of Matt and incorrectly\nreported that Matt did not have a mental\nillness. While noting Matt’s history of\nsuicide attempts, the report also stated\nthat Matt had never taken any medication\nto help with \"anxiety, depression, mood\nswings, thinking problems, hearing voices\nor seeing things, or controlling [his]\nbehavior.\" Plaintiff alleges that Dr.\nCihlar was aware of Matt’s troubled\nhistory, including the conclusions of Dr.\nHeinz’s pretrial competency evaluation.\nTowards the end of the month, Matt was\nagain evaluated, this time by a\nclassification specialist at Dodge, and\nshe determined that Matt was presently\nmedicated with psychotropic drugs. Her\nreport also noted Matt’s numerous\nbehavioral problems during his\nunmedicated stay in the county jail.\n\n  Matt arrived at Waupun Correctional\nInstitution (WCI) on February 26, 1998. A\nweek after his admission, Matt was seen\nfor a psychiatric follow-up by Dr. Yogesh\nPareek, the second of the doctor-\ndefendants. Because Matt was having\nproblems with nausea and vomiting, Dr.\nPareek advised him to go off his\npsychotropic medication until the\nproblems subsided. As it turned out, Matt\nhad an inflamed appendix, which required\nan emergency appendectomy on March 6,\n1998.\n\n  While in the hospital, Matt remained off\nhis medication. On March 10, his mother\ncontacted the hospital to express concern\nthat Matt had been taken off his\n\fmedication. After the prison was\ncontacted, the staff physician assured\nher that Matt’s anti-psychotic medication\nhad been reordered.\n\n  On March 26, 1998, about a week after\nhis release from the hospital, Matt saw\nDr. Pareek for the second time. Dr.\nPareek noted that Matt had a \"history of\npsychotic disorder, but he [was] refusing\nto take medication\" and that Matt denied\n\"ever hearing voices or ever seeing\nthings [or] ever being paranoid.\" The\ndoctor decided to discontinue\npsychotropic medication \"at the patient’s\nrequest.\" His notes indicated that he\nwould \"see [Matt] again in eight weeks.\nThe patient is competent and he knows\nwhat is right and wrong.\" A week later,\nhowever, Matt and Dr. Pareek had another\nsession. Matt had not taken any\nmedication since the date of the\nappendicitis incident, March 5, and indi\ncated that he no longer wanted medication\nor psychiatric services. Dr. Pareek’s\ntreatment plan stated \"I will not\nschedule him as he is not taking any\nmedication and he does not want to.\"\n\n  While he was unmedicated, Matt’s\nbehavior became increasingly bizarre. In\nApril, he defied an order to return to\nhis cell, for which he was sent to\nsolitary confinement. In early May, he\nscrawled venomous, nonsensical threats on\nhis bed sheets (\"kill the rapest [sic]\nand snitches\" and \"go to hell\"). On June\n9, he flushed his socks and underwear\ndown the toilet. Yet he also displayed\nsome evidence of competence (perhaps\nconsistent with his diagnosis that he\nexhibited \"very paranoid behavior with\nsense of reality\"). The day prior to the\nsock flushing incident he requested that\nhe be placed in an anger management class\n(he was placed on a waiting list). He\nalso filed a lawsuit based upon the\nfailure of one correctional officer to\nrespond to his requests for medical\nattention during the appendicitis\nincident.\n\n  In late June, Matt asked to see a\npsychiatrist. When Dr. Pareek arrived,\nMatt reported no mental health concerns\nand persisted in his decision to remain\noff his medication. Dr. Pareek provided\nneither treatment nor medication to Matt.\nAt this point, Matt had lost seventeen\npounds since his admission to WCI.\n\f  On July 11, 1998, Matt assaulted another\ninmate and was placed in segregation.\nJust prior to being placed there, Matt\ndrafted a document that he entitled his\nlast will and testament. This document--\ncollected by correctional staff at an\nundetermined time--was addressed to\nMatt’s mother and contemplated Matt’s\nimminent death.\n\n  While in segregation, Matt’s bizarre\nbehavior continued. After receiving\nconduct reports for refusing to return\nhis meal tray and bag lunch, Matt was\nserved \"nutri-loaf\"--a meal ground up\ninto a loaf that could be eaten without\nutensils. He did not eat these loaves and\nthus began to lose weight rapidly. His\nsubsequent autopsy confirmed that he lost\nabout forty-five pounds during his five\nmonths at WCI, nearly twenty-five of\nwhich were in the final month of his life\n(after his placement in segregation).\nMatt wrote to his mother and complained\nabout the nutri-loaf;/2 upon receipt of\nthe letter, she called the manager of the\nHealth Services Unit at WCI and relayed\nher concern that Matt was paranoid,\nsuicidal, and in serious trouble.\n  On July 24, 1998, Dr. Stephen Fleck, the\nthird doctor-defendant, visited Matt in\nhis cell in response to Mrs. Sanville’s\nphone call. Dr. Fleck was, however,\nsatisfied with Matt’s insistence that he\nhad no plans to harm himself. Matt again\nrefused clinical and psychiatric\nservices. Dr. Fleck’s report did not make\nany reference to Matt’s weight.\n\n  Matt repeatedly asked the guards to\nbring him a regular meal but his requests\nwere ignored. He reported to many prison\nemployees that he was unable to eat the\nnutri-loaf. His failure to eat and his\ncorresponding weight loss was allegedly\nknown to, at a minimum, the prison guards\nwho fed him (including defendant Ivy\nScaburdine).\n\n  Matt mailed a letter to his mother on\nJuly 27, 1998, which prison officials\nread. The letter conveyed that Matt\nthought he was being retaliated against\nbecause of the lawsuit that he had filed,\nasked for help in finding an attorney,\nrequested clinical services, and again\ntold Mrs. Sanville that he was not eating\nthe nutri-loaf. That same day Matt\nrequested to see someone from clinical\n\fservices, and Dr. Fleck visited him at\nhis cell. Dr. Fleck’s report indicated\nthat Matt said his mood was not good but\nthat \"[h]e denied any thoughts and plans\nto harm himself . . . .\" The notes\ncontinued:\n\nI again recommended a face-to-face. He\nagain refused, stating \"I can take care\nof myself.\" I again suggested he put in\nan interview request to see Y. Pareek,\nM.D., Psychiatry, to discuss the option\nof medication. He stated, \"I don’t need\nany drugs, I’m handling it myself.\" . . .\nI will follow up in four to six weeks to\nmonitor his status.\n\nLater the same day, Matt again requested\nto see someone from clinical services.\nDr. Fleck received this request on July\n28, and scheduled an appointment for July\n30, 1998, three days after the request.\nMatt told prison guards sometime during\nthese two days that he was going to kill\nhimself, but no action was taken.\n\n  On July 29, 1998, the day of Matt’s\nsuicide, correctional officer Ivy\nScaburdine, one of the guard-defendants,\nmade her morning rounds to pass out\nbreakfast. Matt had covered all of the\nopenings in his cell with paper--the\nvents, the call box, and the window--so\nthat it was nearly impossible to see\ninside. This was in violation of prison\npolicy. Scaburdine did not serve Matt\nbreakfast, instead skipping his cell and\ncontinuing on her rounds. When she made\nthe rounds to serve lunch, Matt’s window\nwas still covered, thus she did not serve\nhim at that time either. All of the\ndefendant guards observed Matt’s covered\ncell window at some point during the day,\nbut none took any action.\n\n  While his cell window was covered, Matt\nripped his pillowcase into strips, wet\nthe strips in his sink, and then tied the\nstrips together, thus fashioning a noose.\nHe slid the noose around his neck and\ntied it to the handicap railing along the\nwest wall of his cell. He managed to\nposition himself so that his weight would\npull the noose tighter until he gradually\nlost consciousness and died.\n\n  At approximately 2:48 p.m., correctional\nofficer Eric Schroeder, one of the guard-\ndefendants, was making his rounds. When\nhe passed Matt’s cell he noticed that\n\f\"inmate Sanville was sitting on his floor\nin his cell up against the left wall of\nhis cell with the left side of his body\nagainst the wall.\" He further noted that\n\"[Matt] had his window partially covered\nwith toilet paper making it somewhat\ndifficult to see into his cell.\"\nSchroeder, who was not regularly assigned\nto the segregation unit, decided not to\ntake any action. He had been instructed\nthat he should assume inmates who ignored\nhim were simply refusing supplies.\n\n  Schroeder claims that he returned to\nMatt’s cell at 2:57 p.m. with officer\nGlenn Gilgenbach, another guard-\ndefendant. Gilgenbach offered Matt his\ndinner several times and Matt did not\nrespond. Schroeder wrote in his report\nthat \"I then went to the window and\nobserved that he hadn’t moved since\nsupplies were offered, nine minites [sic]\nago.\" Schroeder then attempted to call\nthe sergeant for the segregation block,\nAnn Ingolia, but was unable to reach her\nbecause the battery in his radio was\ndead.\n\n  At approximately 3:00 p.m., Schroeder\nleft to retrieve Ingolia. Ingolia\nfollowed Schroeder to the door of the\ncell, peered inside, and noticed that\nMatt had a sheet around his neck. She\ninstructed Gilgenbach and Schroeder to\ncontinue feeding the other inmates while\nshe called Captain Don Strahota to alert\nhim to a possible suicide. Ingolia then\nreturned to the cell to wait for the\nfirst responders. Upon arrival, they\nattempted unsuccessfully to revive Matt.\nAt 3:10 p.m., rescue efforts ceased and\nMatt was pronounced dead. Matt was last\nseen alive by the defendants at 10:00\na.m.\n\n  The prison file provided to the doctor\nwho performed the autopsy indicated \"a\npast history of suicide attempt\" and\nfurther disclosed that, as of February 7,\n1998, Matt was \"psychotic but in\nremission with a Navane treatment.\"\nMatt’s weight was estimated at 110-120\npounds. The autopsy concluded that \"[a]\ndiagnosis of suicide is reasonable but it\nsure would have been nice to have him\nmore persuaded to take medication and\nseek psychiatric help.\"\n\n  Mrs. Sanville filed this lawsuit in the\nUnited States District Court for the\n\fEastern District of Wisconsin on July 25,\n1999, raising federal claims under 42\nU.S.C. sec. 1983-- alleging that the\nvarious defendants violated Matt’s Eighth\nAmendment rights--and pendent state law\nnegligence and medical malpractice\nclaims. The defendants moved to dismiss\nthe action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and\nfiled a corresponding motion for a\nprotective order prohibiting discovery\nuntil the court ruled on the motion to\ndismiss. On June 29, 2000, the court\ngranted defendants’ motion to dismiss the\nfederal claims on qualified immunity\ngrounds and declined to retain\njurisdiction of the ancillary state law\nnegligence claims. See Sanville v.\nMcCaughtry, No. 99-C-715, slip op. (W.D.\nWis. June 28, 2000). Plaintiff appeals\nthis judgment.\n\nII.    Analysis\n\nA.    Standard of Review\n\n  We review dismissals under Rule 12(b)(6)\nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\nde novo, examining a plaintiff’s factual\nallegations and any inferences reasonably\ndrawn therefrom in the light most\nfavorable to the plaintiff. See Marshall-\nMosby v. Corporate Receivables, Inc., 205\nF.3d 323, 326 (7th Cir. 2000). Dismissal\nunder Rule 12(b)(6) is proper only if the\nplaintiff could prove no set of facts in\nsupport of her claims that would entitle\nher to relief. See Conley v. Gibson, 355\nU.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d\n80 (1957); Veazey v. Communications &\nCable of Chi., Inc., 194 F.3d 850, 854\n(7th Cir. 1999). \"[I]f it is possible to\nhypothesize a set of facts, consistent\nwith the complaint, that would entitle\nthe plaintiff to relief, dismissal under\nRule 12(b)(6) is inappropriate.\" Veazey,\n194 F.3d at 854 (citing Graehling v.\nVillage of Lombard, Ill., 58 F.3d. 295,\n297 (7th Cir. 1995)).\n\n  The district court ruled that the\ndefendants were entitled to qualified\nimmunity. See Sanville, slip op at 31.\n\"Qualified immunity shields government\nofficials performing discretionary\nfunctions from liability for civil\ndamages unless their conduct violates\nclearly established statutory or\nconstitutional rights of which a\nreasonable person would have known.\" See\n\fCampbell v. Peters, 256 F.3d 695, 699\n(7th Cir. 2001) (citing Anderson v.\nCreighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S. Ct.\n3034, 97 L. Ed. 2d 523 (1987)). We review\na district court’s grant of qualified\nimmunity de novo. See id.\n  Before we reach the merits of Mrs.\nSanville’s claims, there are two\nimportant issues which we must address,\nneither of which were discussed by the\ndistrict court or raised by the parties.\nPlaintiff alleges that the defendants are\nliable under 42 U.S.C. sec. 1983, which\n\"requires proof that the defendants were\nacting under color of state law and that\nthe defendants’ conduct violated the\nplaintiff’s rights, privileges, or\nimmunities secured by the Constitution or\nlaws of the United States.\" Chavez v.\nIll. State Police, 251 F.3d 612, 651 (7th\nCir. 2001) (quotation omitted). Mrs.\nSanville sued each of the defendants in\ntheir official and individual capacities,\nand the district court dismissed all of\nthese claims based upon the doctrine of\nqualified immunity. Sanville, slip op. at\n31. The dismissal of the official\ncapacity claims was not proper, as \"it is\nwell established that the qualified\nimmunity doctrine does not apply to\nofficial capacity claims.\" Ruffino v.\nSheahan, 218 F.3d 697, 700 (7th Cir.\n2000).\n\n  Yet there is another twist. Official\ncapacity suits are actions against the\ngovernment entity of which the official\nis a part. See Wolf-Lillie v. Sonquist,\n699 F.2d 864, 870 (7th Cir. 1983). To sue\nthe defendants in their official\ncapacities means that Mrs. Sanville is\nreally suing the state entities: the\nWaupun Correctional Institution and the\nDodge Correctional Institution./3 As we\nhave recognized previously, however,\n\"section 1983 does not authorize suits\nagainst states.\" Power v. Summers, 226\nF.3d 815, 818 (7th Cir. 2000). We\nconclude, therefore, that the official\ncapacity claims seeking money damages\nfrom the defendants should have been\ndismissed on the basis that they may not\nbe sustained under sec. 1983.\n\n  We thus turn to the remaining claims--\nthe individual capacity claims to which\nthe defendants asserted qualified\nimmunity as a defense. The court must\nfirst decide whether the plaintiff’s\nfactual allegations would, if proven,\n\f\"show the state actor’s conduct violated\na constitutional right.\" Billings v.\nMadison Metro. Sch. Dist., 259 F.3d 807,\n816 (7th Cir. 2001) (citing Saucier v.\nKatz, 121 S. Ct. 2151, 2156 (2001)). If\nso, then we proceed to the second step of\nthe analysis, which is to determine\n\"whether the right was clearly\nestablished.\" Id. In line with this\nframework, we begin by reviewing\nplaintiff’s substantive claim that the\ndefendants violated Matt’s Eighth\nAmendment rights; where necessary, we\nwill proceed to consider whether those\nrights were clearly established at the\ntime of the violation.\n\n\nB. Did the Defendants’ Conduct Violate\nMatt’s Eighth Amendment Rights?\n\n  Prison officials have a duty, in light\nof the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition\nagainst cruel and unusual punishment, to\n\"ensure that inmates receive adequate\nfood, clothing, shelter, and medical\ncare.\" Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825,\n832, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 128 L. Ed. 2d 811\n(1994). To determine whether an inmate’s\nEighth Amendment rights were violated by\na deprivation, we examine the\nallegedviolation both objectively and\nsubjectively. See id. at 834. \"First, the\ndeprivation alleged must be, objectively,\nsufficiently serious.\" Id. (quotation\nomitted). Second, the mental state of the\nprison official must have been \"one of\ndeliberate indifference to inmate health\nor safety.\" Id. (quotation omitted).\n\n  Plaintiff alleges, essentially, that the\nconditions of Matt’s incarceration were\nsuch that there was a substantial risk\nthat Matt would commit suicide and that\nthe defendants were deliberately\nindifferent to this risk. When a claim is\nbased upon the failure to prevent harm,\nin order to satisfy the first element the\nplaintiff must show that the inmate was\n\"incarcerated under conditions posing a\nsubstantial risk of serious harm.\" Id. It\ngoes without saying that \"[s]uicide is a\nserious harm.\" Estate of Cole by Pardue\nv. Fromm, 94 F.3d 254, 261 (7th Cir.\n1996) (quotation omitted); see also\nEstate of Novack ex rel. Turbin v. County\nof Wood, 226 F.3d 525, 529 (7th Cir.\n2000); Hall v. Ryan, 957 F.2d 402, 406\n(7th Cir. 1992) (recognizing that\nprisoners have a constitutional right \"to\n\fbe protected from self-destructive\ntendencies,\" including suicide) (citing\nJoseph v. Brierton, 739 F.2d 1244 (7th\nCir. 1984)). In this case, not only was\nthere a risk of serious harm but that\nharm actually materialized--Matt\ncommitted suicide. It would be difficult\nto think of a more serious deprivation\nthan to be deprived of life, and thus\nplaintiff’s claim clearly satisfies the\nfirst element. Cf. Reed v. McBride, 178\nF.3d 849, 852 (7th Cir. 1999) (\"A\ncondition is objectively serious if\nfailure to treat it could result in\nfurther significant injury or unnecessary\nand wanton infliction of pain.\")\n(internal quotation omitted) (collecting\ncases).\n\n  We should note that the injury could be\nframed in a more particularized fashion\nwith respect to the various groups of\ndefendants. The need for a mental illness\nto be treated could certainly be\nconsidered a serious medical need. See\nid. at 853 (citing Hudson v. McHugh, 148\nF.3d 859, 863 (7th Cir. 1998), for the\nproposition that unmedicated epilepsy\n\"posed a ’serious threat’ to a prisoner’s\nhealth\"). Further, there is the\nadditional possibility that Matt was\nphysically unable to eat the nutri-loaf\nthat he was being served (the complaint\nstates both that he refused his food and\nthat he was unable to eat it). We have\nheld that withholding food from an inmate\ncan, in some circumstances, satisfy the\nfirst Farmer prong. See id. (recognizing\nthat \"the amount and duration of the\ndeprivation\" would be relevant to whether\nthe deprivation amounted to an objective\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment).\nWhether these facts would support a\nfinding that Matt was denied food is not\nsomething we need to resolve, as we have\nalready concluded that Matt demonstrated\na serious medical need.\n\n  We therefore turn to the second element\nof the Farmer framework: whether the\ndefendants were deliberately indifferent\nto the risk that Matt would commit\nsuicide. See Pardue, 94 F.3d at 261. The\nmeaning of the \"deliberate indifference\"\nprong has recently been clarified by the\nSupreme Court: \"a prison official cannot\nbe found liable under the Eighth\nAmendment for denying an inmate humane\nconditions of confinement unless the\nofficial knows of and disregards an\n\fexcessive risk to inmate health or\nsafety; the official must both be aware\nof facts from which the inference could\nbe drawn that a substantial risk of\nserious harm exists, and he must also\ndraw the inference.\" Farmer, 511 U.S. at\n837. With this framework in mind, we\nconsider Mrs. Sanville’s claims against\nthe various defendants.\n\n1. The Medical Defendants: Cihlar,\nPareek, Fleck/4\n\n  Plaintiff alleges that the doctors knew\nthat Matt’s refusal to accept care was a\nsymptom of his mental illness and that by\ndeferring to his stated wishes, they\ndeliberately disregarded the substantial\nrisk that he would commit suicide. Thus,\nbecause they allowed him to remain\nunmedicated without taking further\nprecautions to ensure his safety,\nplaintiff alleges that the doctors were\ndeliberately indifferent to Matt’s\nserious medical need.\n\n  This situation is undeniably tragic. Yet\n\"a complaint that a physician has been\nnegligent in diagnosing or treating a\nmedical condition does not state a valid\nclaim of medical mistreatment under the\nEighth Amendment.\" Estelle v. Gamble, 429\nU.S. 97, 106, 97 S. Ct. 285, 50 L. Ed. 2d\n251 (1976). To avoid dismissal, Mrs.\nSanville must plead sufficient facts to\ndemonstrate that a fact-finder could\ninfer deliberate indifference from the\ndoctors’ treatment decisions.\n\"[D]eliberate indifference may be\ninferred . . . when the medical\nprofessional’s decision is such a\nsubstantial departure from accepted\nprofessional judgment, practice, or\nstandards as to demonstrate that the\nperson responsible did not base the\ndecision on such a judgment.\" Pardue, 94\nF.3d at 261-62. We examine Mrs.\nSanville’s claims against each of the\ndoctor-defendants in turn.\n\n  Plaintiff asserts that Dr. Cihlar,\nduring the screening interview at Dodge,\nincorrectly found that Matt did not have\na mental health illness and that he was\nnot medicated with anti-psychotics. While\nDr. Cihlar’s conclusions about Matt’s\nmental health may have been negligently\ndrawn, stating that Matt did not have a\nmental illness does not establish\ndeliberate indifference to Matt’s\n\fcondition. To violate the Eighth\nAmendment the official must knowingly\ndisregard a substantial risk to inmate\nhealth or safety, see Farmer, 511 U.S. at\n837. Not noticing that an inmate exhibits\na serious medical need does not violate\nthe Constitution because not noticing\nthat a need exists is not considered\n\"punishment\" under relevant Supreme Court\nprecedent. See id. at 837-38./5\nFurther, we note that his failure to\nrecognize Matt’s condition did not\nprevent Matt from getting subsequent\ntreatment for his mental illness.\n\n  Mrs. Sanville accuses Dr. Pareek and Dr.\nFleck of failing to provide treatment and\nmedication to Matt even though they were\naware of Matt’s history of mental\nillness, which was well-documented in his\nbase file at WCI. She also claimed that\nthey knew that Matt was incapable of\nmaking his own decisions regarding\nmedication and that he had a history of\nasking for help and then denying any need\nfor it. Dr. Pareek advised Matt to\ndiscontinue taking his medication--based\nupon his professional judgment that the\nmedicine was causing Matt’s stomachaches-\n-and later determined that Matt was\ncompetent and did not need to be\nmedicated. While plaintiff takes issue\nwith the correctness of these decisions,\na complaint that a physician negligently\ntreated Matt’s mental illness does not\nstate a valid Eighth Amendment medical\nmistreatment claim. See Estelle, 429 U.S.\nat 107. Plaintiff thus asserts that\nadvising Matt to stop taking his\nmedication was such a substantial\ndeparture from accepted professional\njudgment that a jury could infer\ndeliberate indifference. To determine\nwhether this is the case, we ask whether\na minimally competent doctor in Dr.\nPareek’s shoes would have been aware of a\nsubstantial risk that allowing Matt to\nremain unmedicated would result in\nserious harm. See Pardue, 94 F.3d at 262-\n63. Here, we cannot find that the risk\nwas such that Dr. Pareek’s actions were\ndeliberately indifferent. Matt saw Dr.\nPareek on March 5, March 26, April 2, and\nin late June of 1998. The last of these\ndates was over a month before Matt\ncommitted suicide. In April, Matt stated\nthat he no longer wanted medication or\npsychiatric services, and Dr. Pareek\ndeferred to those wishes. At the time of\nDr. Pareek’s June visit, Matt had been\n\foff his medication for three months\n(since March 5) and there is no\nindication that Matt was, at that time,\nsuicidal or in danger of harming himself.\nRecognizing that \"a medical professional\nmust consider [an inmate’s] conflicting\nrights,\" Dr. Pareek seemingly determined\nthat Matt’s desire to be free from\nmedication outweighed his right (or need)\nto receive psychotropic drugs for his\nmental illness. See Pardue, 94 F.3d at\n262 (noting that an inmate had both an\nEighth Amendment right to be restrained\nso that he would not injure himself and a\nFourteenth Amendment right to be free\nfrom restraint).\n\n  Although we wish Dr. Pareek could have\nprevented Matt’s suicide, physicians do\nnot practice with a crystal ball in hand.\nWe thus conclude that plaintiff has not\npresented evidence from which a trier of\nfact could find that Dr. Pareek was\ndeliberately indifferent to the\nsubstantial risk that Matt would commit\nsuicide. See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837.\n\n  Finally, we turn to Dr. Fleck. Dr. Fleck\nsaw Matt two times in the days\nimmediately preceding Matt’s suicide, and\nhis notes indicate that he was concerned\nabout Matt’s welfare. He recommended that\nMatt come in for a face-to-face visit and\nthat he see Dr. Pareek to discuss the\noption of medication. Matt responded by\nstating: \"I don’t need any drugs, I’m\nhandling it myself.\" Mrs. Sanville points\nout that Matt was dangerously underweight\nat the time of Dr. Fleck’s June 27, 1998\nvisit. She alleges that, by deferring to\nthe opinion of a mentally ill and\nsuicidal inmate, Dr. Fleck abdicated his\nprofessional judgment and that, at the\nleast, he should have taken extra\nprecautions with regard to Matt’s health\nand well-being. These claims are\nundeniably emotionally appealing. That a\ndoctor would defer to the discretion of a\nmentally ill inmate may be troubling to a\nlayperson, particularly when the doctor\nappeared to recognize that Matt needed to\nbe medicated. And we would hope that\nadditional precautions would have been\ntaken if they were thought to be\nnecessary. Plaintiff has not provided us\nwith any reason, however, to find that\nDr. Fleck’s choices were not made in the\nexercise of his professional judgment.\nWhile Mrs. Sanville would have preferred\nthe doctor to be less deferential to\n\fMatt’s requests and more forceful in pur\nsuing the option of medicating him, we\nagree with the district court that Dr.\nFleck’s actions and medical notes counsel\nagainst a finding of deliberate\nindifference. Sanville, slip op. at 21.\n\n  In sum, the evidence does not support a\nfinding that the medical professionals at\nWCI were deliberately indifferent to\nMatt’s serious medical needs. He was seen\nby medical professionals eleven times\nover the five months that he was\nincarcerated and most of these visits\ntook place shortly after they were\nrequested. Plaintiff points to Dr.\nFlick’s failure to see Matt promptly\nafter his July 27th request, yet Dr.\nFlick had already seen Matt once that\nday. There is no indication that the\ndoctor was aware that Matt was suicidal\nor in serious harm at that time (if, in\nfact, Matt was suicidal at that time).\nFurther, Dr. Flick did not even receive\nthe request until July 28th, at which\ntime he scheduled Matt for an appointment\non July 30th. Under the circumstances,\nthis delay cannot be considered\ndeliberately indifferent. See Gutierrez\nv. Peters, 111 F.3d 1364, 1374 (7th Cir.\n1997) (finding no deliberate indifference\nwhere the inmate \"repeatedly received\ntreatment over [a] ten-month period and\nthat at most he experienced an isolated\noccasion or two where he did not receive\nprompt treatment\"); cf. Reed, 178 F.3d at\n855-56 (distinguishing prior Seventh\nCircuit cases where \"the totality of the\n[inmate’s] medical care\" counseled\nagainst a finding of deliberate\nindifference, and holding that the court\nwas faced with one of those instances in\nwhich \"mistreatment for a short time\nwould be evidence of a culpable state of\nmind\") (quotation omitted).\n\n  It is troubling that this young man’s\nsuicide might have been prevented had he\nbeen taking his prescribed psychotropic\nmedication. The ultimate problem seems to\nbe that none of the doctors ever noted\nthat Matt might be a suicide risk, an\nobservation that would not have seemed\ntoo obscure considering his mental\nillness and history of suicide attempts.\nYet the doctors’ failure to correctly\ndiagnose and treat Matt is not, in this\ninstance, evidence of anything more than\nmedical malpractice. Though we find that\nplaintiff’s claims against the doctor-\n\fdefendants were properly dismissed by the\ndistrict court, we note that plaintiff is\ncertainly free to pursue her state law\nmedical malpractice claims in state\ncourt./6\n\n2. The Guards: Scaburdine, Schroeder,\nGilgenbach, John Does Nos. 1-5/7\n\n  Mrs. Sanville accuses several\ncorrectional officers at WCI of knowing\nthat Matt was likely to commit suicide\nbut failing to reasonably respond to this\nrisk. To be liable under the Eighth\nAmendment for an inmate’s suicide, \"a\nprison official must be cognizant of the\nsignificant likelihood that an inmate may\nimminently seek to take his own life and\nmust fail to take reasonable steps to\nprevent the inmate from performing this\nact.\" Turbin, 226 F.3d at 529 (citations\nomitted). However, \"an Eighth Amendment\nclaimant need not show that a prison\nofficial acted or failed to act believing\nthat harm actually would befall an\ninmate; it is enough that the official\nacted or failed to act despite his\nknowledge of a substantial risk of\nserious harm.\" Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842.\nWhether a prison official had the\nrequisite knowledge is a question of\nfact. See id. If \"the circumstances\nsuggest that the defendant-official being\nsued had been exposed to information\nconcerning the risk and thus ’must have\nknown’ about it, then such evidence could\nbe sufficient to permit a trier of fact\nto find that the defendant-official had\nactual knowledge of the risk.\" Id. 842-\n43. Prison officials can still show that\nthey were unaware of the risk--this is a\nsubjective inquiry--or that they were\naware of the risk but that they responded\nreasonably to it, \"even if the harm\nultimately was not averted.\" Id. at 844-\n45. Thus we ask 1) were the prison\nofficials aware of the substantial risk\nthat Matt might take his own life and, if\nso, 2) did they \"take reasonable steps to\nprevent the inmate from performing this\nact.\" Turbin, 226 F.3d at 529.\n\na.   Awareness of the Substantial Risk\n\n  Plaintiff claims that, once Matt covered\nhis cell openings with toilet paper, the\nguards were aware of the substantial risk\nthat Matt would commit suicide. She\nasserts that the guards already knew: 1)\nthat Matt had written a last will and\n\ftestament contemplating his imminent\ndeath and telling his mother how to carry\non his affairs after he died; 2) that\nMatt told certain guards that he planned\nto commit suicide; 3) that he had\nattempted suicide in the past; 4) that he\nhad a long history of mental illness; 5)\nthat he was not eating and was\ndangerously thin; and 6) that his mother\nhad called the prison to alert them that\nhe was paranoid, suicidal, and in\ntrouble.\n  It seems quite possible that, under the\nfacts as alleged by the plaintiff, the\nguards could have been aware of the risk\nthat Matt would commit suicide.\nParticularly if Matt told them that he\nwas suicidal, that alone should have been\nenough to \"impute awareness of a\nsubstantial risk of suicide.\" Turbin, 226\nF.3d at 529. It is true that \"strange be\nhavior alone, without indications that\nthat behavior has a substantial\nlikelihood of taking a suicidal turn, is\nnot sufficient to impute subjective\nknowledge of a high suicide risk to jail\npersonnel.\" Id. at 530. Thus, if the\ninmate was a normally functioning\nindividual with no history of mental\nillness or suicide attempts, who had not\nrecently lost nearly one-third of his\nbody weight or written letters to his\nmother contemplating his death, then\nmaybe papering up his cell would not be\nenough to put the guards on notice that\nsomething was wrong. Matt was not a\nnormally functioning individual, however,\nand it would not be inconsistent with the\nalleged facts to find that he did \"put\njail officials on notice that there was a\nsignificant likelihood that he would\nattempt to harm himself.\" Id. The Eighth\nAmendment does not allow officials to\nturn a blind eye to the activities of an\ninmate, particularly one who is suicidal.\nWe thus find that plaintiff’s complaint\nshould not have been dismissed because\nshe has alleged sufficient facts that, if\nproven, would entitle her to relief\nagainst the WCI guards. See Hall, 957\nF.2d at 405 (finding that plaintiff\nraised a genuine issue of material fact\nregarding the defendants’ knowledge of\nHoward’s suicidal tendencies); cf.\nTurbin, 226 F.3d at 534 (Williams, J.,\ndissenting) (\"[W]e have more than\nNovack’s strange and bizarre behavior. We\nalso have evidence that jail officials\nknew that Novack was a suicide risk and\nhad a possible mental illness.\").\n\f  Defendants contend that they were not\naware of any risk that Matt would harm\nhimself, and assert that plaintiff cannot\nsurvive the first Farmer prong. We find\ntheir arguments unconvincing. First,\ndefendants contend that the only way the\nguards would have known many of these\nfacts is if they had read Matt’s prison\nfile, which they characterize as an\nunreasonable endeavor. While we do not\nneed to address whether the guards should\nbe familiar with the mental health\nhistories of the prison’s inmates, it\nseems contrary to defendants’ assertions\nthat the guards could have been aware of\nmany of the facts alleged by plaintiff\nwithout reading Matt’s file (for example:\nthat Mrs. Sanville had called the prison\nto express concern over Matt’s condition,\nand that Matt had written a last will and\ntestament, lost a significant amount of\nweight, and said that he planned to\ncommit suicide). Second, defendants\nallege that the fact that Matt was\nrequesting food other than the nutri-loaf\nand that he had filed a complaint the\nweek before his suicide indicates that\nthe guards would not have thought that\nMatt was a substantial suicide risk. What\nthe guards thought, however, is not an\nissue for us to resolve--it is an issue\nfor a trier of fact. See Farmer, 511 U.S.\nat 842. Third, the defendants criticize\nthe plaintiff for doing nothing more than\nalleging facts. Yet, under the\nrequirements of notice pleading, Mrs.\nSanville does not have to prove her\nfactual and legal allegations at this\nstage, she need only show that relief is\npossible. See Conley, 355 U.S. at 45-46;\nBartholet v. Reishauer A.G. (Zurich), 953\nF.2d 1073, 1078 (7th Cir. 1992).\nPlaintiff has certainly met this\nstandard. Of course, this is not the end\nof the inquiry. During discovery, the\nparties will undoubtedly explore in\ngreater detail whether the \"prison\nofficial[s] had the requisite knowledge\nof a substantial risk\" to Matt’s health.\nFarmer, 511 U.S. at 842.\n\nb. Whether the Defendants Took\nReasonable Steps\n\n  While it remains to be seen whether the\ndefendants were actually aware of the\nsubstantial risk to Matt’s health, there\nseems to be no evidence that the\ndefendants \"[took] reasonable steps to\n\fprevent the inmate from [committing\nsuicide]\" as is required by our case law.\nTurbin, 226 F.3d at 529. Matt was last\nseen alive by the defendants at 10:00\na.m. In the five hours during which\nMatt’s cell window was covered with\ntoilet paper, there was no apparent\nattempt to discern whether he was stable.\nThe guards did not use the video camera\nto check on Matt, nor did anyone take any\naction until approximately 3:00 p.m. If\nthe defendants were aware of the alleged\nrisk, failing to determine what was going\non in Matt’s cell could easily be\nconsidered egregious enough to rise to\nthe level of deliberate indifference. The\nevidence here clearly supports an\ninference that at least some of the\nguards, if not all of them, were aware of\nMatt’s serious medical need and\ndemonstrated deliberate indifference to\nthat need.\n\n  There are a number of reasons why\ndefendants assert that the guards cannot\nbe found liable, none of which we find\nmeritorious. Contrary to defendants’\nallegations, the fact that we have\nalready found that the doctors cannot be\nheld liable does not erect a legal bar\nthat prevents anyone else in the prison\nfrom being held liable. See Estelle, 429\nU.S. at 107-08 (finding that the claims\nagainst the doctor defendants amounted,\nat most, to medical malpractice, but\nremanded to the Court of Appeals for\nconsideration of \"whether a cause of\naction has been stated against the other\nprison officials\" including the prison\nwarden). Defendants further assert that\nthe guards cannot be held liable because\nthey relied upon the doctors’\ndetermination that Matt was not a suicide\nrisk. The record, however, at least as\ncurrently developed, does not support\nthis assertion. There is no evidence\nindicating that any of the doctors\nactually determined that Matt was not\nsuicidal, much less that they then\ninformed the guards that Matt was not\nsuicidal and that the guards then decided\nnot to act based on that information. Our\nreview is intended to determine whether\nthe plaintiff could prevail under any set\nof facts, not whether the defendant could\nwin under any set of facts. Likewise, the\nfact that Matt was seen by mental health\nprofessionals eleven times during his\nincarceration does not prevent us from\nfinding that someone--whether a guard or\n\fa warden or otherwise--was deliberately\nindifferent to his serious medical needs.\nThe guards’ liability is not premised\nupon the acts or omissions of the medical\nprofessionals, it is premised upon their\nown deliberate indifference to Matt’s\ncondition.\n\n  We will thus consider, subsequently,\nwhether this was a clearly established\nlaw at the time of defendants’ actions to\ndetermine whether this claim should be\nreinstated. We first turn to consider\nplaintiff’s claims against the final\ngroup of defendants--the wardens.\n\n3. The Wardens: Warden Gary McCaughtry,\nDeputy Warden Jane Gamble\n\n  Mrs. Sanville alleges that the wardens\nfailed to adopt and enforce adequate\nsuicide prevention policies and that they\nalso failed to train and supervise the\nguards and doctors./8 Because we have\nalready determined that plaintiff’s\nofficial capacity claims against\nMcCaughtry and Gamble should have been\ndismissed, we need only consider the\nclaims against the wardens in their\nindividual capacities. The plaintiff\nfaces a substantial challenge because\nfailure to train claims are usually\nmaintained against municipalities, not\nagainst individuals, see, e.g., Williams\nv. Heavener, 217 F.3d 529, 532 (7th Cir.\n2000); Kitzman-Kelley v. Warner, 203 F.3d\n454, 459 (7th Cir. 2000), and, in the\nEighth Amendment context, such claims may\nonly be maintained against a\nmunicipality. See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 841\n(noting that the standard applied in City\nof Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 109 S.\nCt. 1197, 103 L. Ed. 2d 412 (1989), was\nnot \"an appropriate test for determining\nthe liability of prison officials under\nthe Eighth Amendment as interpreted in\nour cases\").\n\n  The doctrine of respondeat superior does\nnot apply to sec. 1983 actions; thus to\nbe held individually liable, a defendant\nmust be \"personally responsible for the\ndeprivation of a constitutional right.\"\nChavez, 251 F.3d at 651 (quotation\nomitted); see also Wolf-Lillie, 699 F.2d\nat 869 (\"Section 1983 creates a cause of\naction based upon personal liability and\npredicated upon fault.\"). A defendant\n\"will be deemed to have sufficient\npersonal responsibility if he directed\n\fthe conduct causing the constitutional\nviolation, or if it occurred with his\nknowledge or consent.\" Chavez, 251 F.3d\nat 652. This definition recognizes that\nthe individual does not have to have\nparticipated directly in the deprivation.\nSee McPhaul v. Board of Comm’rs of\nMadison Co., 226 F.3d 558, 566 (7th Cir.\n2000) (quotation omitted). Thus, a\nsupervisor may be liable for \"deliberate,\nreckless indifference\" to the misconduct\nof subordinates. See Chavez, 251 F.3d at\n651. (\"The supervisors must know about\nthe conduct and facilitate it, approve\nit, condone it, or turn a blind eye for\nfear of what they might see.\")\n(quotations omitted).\n\n  Mrs. Sanville accuses defendants of\ntolerating a number of transgressions\nwhich she contends rose to the level of\nsystematic failure: 1) on four separate\noccasions, three guards ignored the paper\non Matt’s cell; 2) the camera in his cell\nwas not active the entire three weeks he\nwas in segregation; 3) Matt lost nearly\none-third of his body weight while in\nsegregation; and 4) the guards allegedly\nreceived no suicide prevention training.\nNone of these allegations, however,\nsuggest that the wardens were personally\nresponsible for any deprivation. Nor does\nplaintiff allege that they \"turned a\nblind eye\" to any particular conduct of\nthe remaining defendants. We thus agree\nwith the district court that plaintiff\nhas alleged no facts that would support a\nfinding of liability with respect to the\nwardens.\n\nC. Was the Right Clearly Established at\nthe Time of the Violation?\n  We must now consider whether the guards\nmay be held liable under sec. 1983, or\nwhether they are entitled to qualified\nimmunity. We have recently set forth the\nframework for making this determination:\n\nQualified immunity protects government\nofficials from individual liability under\nSection 1983 for actions taken while\nperforming discretionary functions,\nunless their conduct violates clearly\nestablished statutory or constitutional\nrights of which a reasonable person would\nhave known. Thus, before liability will\nattach, the contours of the right must be\nsufficiently clear that a reasonable\nofficial would understand that what he is\ndoing violates that right.\n\fBrokaw v. Mercer County, 235 F.3d 1000,\n1022 (7th Cir. 2000) (internal quotation\nand citations omitted). There can be\nlittle debate that it was clearly\nestablished, long before 1998, \"that\nprison officials will be liable under\nSection 1983 for a pretrial detainee’s\nsuicide if they were deliberately\nindifferent to a substantial suicide\nrisk.\" Hall, 957 F.2d at 406. Further,\n\"[i]t was clearly established in 1986\nthat police officers could not be\ndeliberately indifferent to a detainee\nwho is in need of medical attention\nbecause of a mental illness or who is a\nsubstantial suicide risk. Deliberate\nindifference to a prisoner’s medical\nneeds constitutes cruel and unusual\npunishment in violation of the Eighth\nAmendment.\" Id. at 404-05. Thus, we find\nthat the guards are not immune from\nindividual liability in this case./9\n\nIII. Conclusion\n\n  In light of the foregoing analysis, we\nAFFIRM the district court’s dismissal of\nMrs. Sanville’s Eighth Amendment claims\nagainst the doctor-defendants and the\nwardens, and REVERSE the district court’s\ndismissal of her claims against the\nguards.\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n/1 For the sake of clarity, we will refer to Matt\nSanville as \"Matt,\" and to Martha Sanville as\n\"Mrs. Sanville.\"\n\n/2 He wrote a letter to his mom, dated July 23,\n1998, stating: \"the guards are trying to feed me\ngag loaf (nasty)--I can’t eat it.\"\n\n/3 We take judicial notice of the fact that both\nthese entities are state prisons: the Waupun\nCorrectional Institution is a state penitentiary\nand the Dodge Correctional Institution is the\ncorrectional treatment center at Waupun. See Wis.\nStat. sec. 302.01.\n\n/4 Plaintiff’s complaint also challenged the actions\nof Narinder Saini, Ph.D., and Gary Ankarlo, Ph.D.\nOn appeal, plaintiff did not present analysis\nwith respect to these doctors, thus we do not\naddress them here.\n\n/5 The Supreme Court has rejected the argument that,\nunder the subjective test for deliberate indif-\nference, \"prison officials will be free to ignore\n\fobvious dangers to inmates.\" Farmer, 511 U.S. at\n842. However, even if a risk is obvious--i.e.,\neven if it was well- documented in Matt’s file\nthat he had a mental illness that, if left\nuntreated, would pose substantial risk to his\nhealth--the prison official is not liable under\nthe Eighth Amendment if \"the obvious escaped\nhim.\" Id. at 843 n.8\n\n/6 The district court’s denial to exercise supple-\nmental jurisdiction over these claims is still\nappropriate given the disposition of those claims\nhere.\n\n/7 Plaintiff’s complaint also challenged the actions\nof Curtis Bender and Jodine Deppisch. On appeal,\nplaintiff did not present analysis with respect\nto these defendants, thus we do not address them\nhere.\n\n/8 The defendants contend that these allegations\nwere not in plaintiff’s district court complaint.\nWe found otherwise: both were included in Count\nI (alleging violations of Matt’s Eighth Amendment\nrights), paragraph 139.\n\n/9 The district court relied upon State Bank of St.\nCharles v. Camic, 712 F.2d 1140 (7th Cir. 1983),\nto support its conclusion that the defendants\nwere entitled to qualified immunity. See Sanville\nv. McCaughtry, No. 99-C-715, slip op. at 14 (W.D.\nWis. June 28, 2000). Camic did not address quali-\nfied immunity; rather, that case found that the\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment was\nproper because the plaintiff did not raise \"a\nquestion of material fact as to whether the\ndefendants had knowledge of . . . suicidal ten-\ndencies on the part of [the inmate].\" Camic, 712\nF.2d at 1146.\n\f",

Matt Sanville, a\nmentally ill inmate incarcerated at the\nWaupun Correctional Institution in\nWisconsin, committed suicide when he was\nleft unsupervised for approximately five\nhours. His mother, Martha Sanville, filed\nthis lawsuit in federal district court,\nalleging that a number of prison\nofficials violated Matt’s Eighth\nAmendment rights through their deliberate\nindifference to Matt’s/1 serious medical\nneeds. While we affirm the district\ncourt’s dismissal of plaintiff’s claims\nagainst the prison wardens and the\nmedical professionals who treated Matt,\nwe find that Mrs. Sanville has pleaded\nsufficient facts to survive a motion to\ndismiss her complaint against several\nprison guards. We thus affirm in part and\nreverse in part, and remand the remaining\nclaims for further proceedings.\n\nI.   History\n\f  Matt Sanville suffered, as do a\nsignificant number of prison inmates,\nfrom a serious mental health problem. At\nvarious times in his life, doctors\ndiagnosed Matt with major depressive\ndisorder, aggressive conduct disorder,\nbipolar disorder, dysthymic disorder,\nadjustment disorder, mixed personality\ndisorder, and manic depression. While\nthey might have disagreed as to Matt’s\nprecise medical condition, the doctors\nunanimously agreed that Matt needed to be\nmedicated to control his illness. His\nadult life was characterized by a history\nof suicide attempts, hospitalizations,\nand drug treatments directed towards\nmanaging his multiple mental disorders.\n\n  Matt did not agree that he needed to be\nmedicated and, during an unmedicated\nperiod in July 1997, he was arrested for\nassaulting his mother. When prosecutors\ncharged Matt with assault, his court-\nappointed attorney moved for a competency\nevaluation, which the state judge\nordered. The medical professional who\nexamined Matt, Harlan R. Heinz, Ph.D.,\nconcluded that he was \"significantly\ndepressed and acutely psychotic,\nrendering him incompetent to stand\ntrial.\" He also found that Matt 1)\n\"showed significant lack of insight by\nreporting his thinking was fine,\" 2) \"was\nnot able to make his needs known,\" and 3)\nwas \"not competent to refuse medication\nor treatment for his mental condition.\"\nMatt’s attorney agreed with this\nassessment and prepared an incompetency\ndefense.\n\n  Matt, however, would not admit his\nincompetency, and his first attorney\nwithdrew as a result. Matt’s second\nattorney acceded to Matt’s assessment of\nhis own competency and Matt was allowed\nto plead no contest to the battery\ncharge. His presentence investigation\nreport noted that Matt had received\nthirty conduct reports during his\nconfinement--for such infractions as\ncovering his cell light, plugging\ntoilets, and throwing feces and urine on\nstaff--all of which occurred while he was\nnot medicated. At sentencing on January\n5, 1998, Matt’s mother pleaded with the\ncourt not to send Matt to prison,\nasserting that he was not a danger as\nlong as he was medicated. The prosecutor\nconcurred, stating that he disagreed with\n\fthe PSI’s recommendation that Matt should\ngo to prison--he even went so far as to\nnote that \"I do not believe that sending\na person to the Wisconsin State Prison\nsystem is the best place to deal with a\nperson’s mental illness.\" Although the\nJudge noted that Matt was probably\nmentally ill, he sentenced him to the\nmaximum term in prison. Matt began\nserving his sentence at the Dodge\nCorrectional Institute (hereinafter\n\"Dodge\") on January 7, 1998.\n\n  Mrs. Sanville wrote a letter to the\nevaluator at Dodge explaining that Matt’s\nconduct was the result of mental illness\nand relaying the opinions conveyed about\nMatt’s mental health during the court\nproceedings. On Matt’s second day at\nDodge, Dr. Carl L. Cihlar, the first of\nthe doctor-defendants, performed an\nintake screening of Matt and incorrectly\nreported that Matt did not have a mental\nillness. While noting Matt’s history of\nsuicide attempts, the report also stated\nthat Matt had never taken any medication\nto help with \"anxiety, depression, mood\nswings, thinking problems, hearing voices\nor seeing things, or controlling [his]\nbehavior.\" Plaintiff alleges that Dr.\nCihlar was aware of Matt’s troubled\nhistory, including the conclusions of Dr.\nHeinz’s pretrial competency evaluation.\nTowards the end of the month, Matt was\nagain evaluated, this time by a\nclassification specialist at Dodge, and\nshe determined that Matt was presently\nmedicated with psychotropic drugs. Her\nreport also noted Matt’s numerous\nbehavioral problems during his\nunmedicated stay in the county jail.\n\n  Matt arrived at Waupun Correctional\nInstitution (WCI) on February 26, 1998. A\nweek after his admission, Matt was seen\nfor a psychiatric follow-up by Dr. Yogesh\nPareek, the second of the doctor-\ndefendants. Because Matt was having\nproblems with nausea and vomiting, Dr.\nPareek advised him to go off his\npsychotropic medication until the\nproblems subsided. As it turned out, Matt\nhad an inflamed appendix, which required\nan emergency appendectomy on March 6,\n1998.\n\n  While in the hospital, Matt remained off\nhis medication. On March 10, his mother\ncontacted the hospital to express concern\nthat Matt had been taken off his\n\fmedication. After the prison was\ncontacted, the staff physician assured\nher that Matt’s anti-psychotic medication\nhad been reordered.\n\n  On March 26, 1998, about a week after\nhis release from the hospital, Matt saw\nDr. Pareek for the second time. Dr.\nPareek noted that Matt had a \"history of\npsychotic disorder, but he [was] refusing\nto take medication\" and that Matt denied\n\"ever hearing voices or ever seeing\nthings [or] ever being paranoid.\" The\ndoctor decided to discontinue\npsychotropic medication \"at the patient’s\nrequest.\" His notes indicated that he\nwould \"see [Matt] again in eight weeks.\nThe patient is competent and he knows\nwhat is right and wrong.\" A week later,\nhowever, Matt and Dr. Pareek had another\nsession. Matt had not taken any\nmedication since the date of the\nappendicitis incident, March 5, and indi\ncated that he no longer wanted medication\nor psychiatric services. Dr. Pareek’s\ntreatment plan stated \"I will not\nschedule him as he is not taking any\nmedication and he does not want to.\"\n\n  While he was unmedicated, Matt’s\nbehavior became increasingly bizarre. In\nApril, he defied an order to return to\nhis cell, for which he was sent to\nsolitary confinement. In early May, he\nscrawled venomous, nonsensical threats on\nhis bed sheets (\"kill the rapest [sic]\nand snitches\" and \"go to hell\"). On June\n9, he flushed his socks and underwear\ndown the toilet. Yet he also displayed\nsome evidence of competence (perhaps\nconsistent with his diagnosis that he\nexhibited \"very paranoid behavior with\nsense of reality\"). The day prior to the\nsock flushing incident he requested that\nhe be placed in an anger management class\n(he was placed on a waiting list). He\nalso filed a lawsuit based upon the\nfailure of one correctional officer to\nrespond to his requests for medical\nattention during the appendicitis\nincident.\n\n  In late June, Matt asked to see a\npsychiatrist. When Dr. Pareek arrived,\nMatt reported no mental health concerns\nand persisted in his decision to remain\noff his medication. Dr. Pareek provided\nneither treatment nor medication to Matt.\nAt this point, Matt had lost seventeen\npounds since his admission to WCI.\n\f  On July 11, 1998, Matt assaulted another\ninmate and was placed in segregation.\nJust prior to being placed there, Matt\ndrafted a document that he entitled his\nlast will and testament. This document--\ncollected by correctional staff at an\nundetermined time--was addressed to\nMatt’s mother and contemplated Matt’s\nimminent death.\n\n  While in segregation, Matt’s bizarre\nbehavior continued. After receiving\nconduct reports for refusing to return\nhis meal tray and bag lunch, Matt was\nserved \"nutri-loaf\"--a meal ground up\ninto a loaf that could be eaten without\nutensils. He did not eat these loaves and\nthus began to lose weight rapidly. His\nsubsequent autopsy confirmed that he lost\nabout forty-five pounds during his five\nmonths at WCI, nearly twenty-five of\nwhich were in the final month of his life\n(after his placement in segregation).\nMatt wrote to his mother and complained\nabout the nutri-loaf;/2 upon receipt of\nthe letter, she called the manager of the\nHealth Services Unit at WCI and relayed\nher concern that Matt was paranoid,\nsuicidal, and in serious trouble.\n  On July 24, 1998, Dr. Stephen Fleck, the\nthird doctor-defendant, visited Matt in\nhis cell in response to Mrs. Sanville’s\nphone call. Dr. Fleck was, however,\nsatisfied with Matt’s insistence that he\nhad no plans to harm himself. Matt again\nrefused clinical and psychiatric\nservices. Dr. Fleck’s report did not make\nany reference to Matt’s weight.\n\n  Matt repeatedly asked the guards to\nbring him a regular meal but his requests\nwere ignored. He reported to many prison\nemployees that he was unable to eat the\nnutri-loaf. His failure to eat and his\ncorresponding weight loss was allegedly\nknown to, at a minimum, the prison guards\nwho fed him (including defendant Ivy\nScaburdine).\n\n  Matt mailed a letter to his mother on\nJuly 27, 1998, which prison officials\nread. The letter conveyed that Matt\nthought he was being retaliated against\nbecause of the lawsuit that he had filed,\nasked for help in finding an attorney,\nrequested clinical services, and again\ntold Mrs. Sanville that he was not eating\nthe nutri-loaf. That same day Matt\nrequested to see someone from clinical\n\fservices, and Dr. Fleck visited him at\nhis cell. Dr. Fleck’s report indicated\nthat Matt said his mood was not good but\nthat \"[h]e denied any thoughts and plans\nto harm himself . . . .\" The notes\ncontinued:\n\nI again recommended a face-to-face. He\nagain refused, stating \"I can take care\nof myself.\" I again suggested he put in\nan interview request to see Y. Pareek,\nM.D., Psychiatry, to discuss the option\nof medication. He stated, \"I don’t need\nany drugs, I’m handling it myself.\" . . .\nI will follow up in four to six weeks to\nmonitor his status.\n\nLater the same day, Matt again requested\nto see someone from clinical services.\nDr. Fleck received this request on July\n28, and scheduled an appointment for July\n30, 1998, three days after the request.\nMatt told prison guards sometime during\nthese two days that he was going to kill\nhimself, but no action was taken.\n\n  On July 29, 1998, the day of Matt’s\nsuicide, correctional officer Ivy\nScaburdine, one of the guard-defendants,\nmade her morning rounds to pass out\nbreakfast. Matt had covered all of the\nopenings in his cell with paper--the\nvents, the call box, and the window--so\nthat it was nearly impossible to see\ninside. This was in violation of prison\npolicy. Scaburdine did not serve Matt\nbreakfast, instead skipping his cell and\ncontinuing on her rounds. When she made\nthe rounds to serve lunch, Matt’s window\nwas still covered, thus she did not serve\nhim at that time either. All of the\ndefendant guards observed Matt’s covered\ncell window at some point during the day,\nbut none took any action.\n\n  While his cell window was covered, Matt\nripped his pillowcase into strips, wet\nthe strips in his sink, and then tied the\nstrips together, thus fashioning a noose.\nHe slid the noose around his neck and\ntied it to the handicap railing along the\nwest wall of his cell. He managed to\nposition himself so that his weight would\npull the noose tighter until he gradually\nlost consciousness and died.\n\n  At approximately 2:48 p.m., correctional\nofficer Eric Schroeder, one of the guard-\ndefendants, was making his rounds. When\nhe passed Matt’s cell he noticed that\n\f\"inmate Sanville was sitting on his floor\nin his cell up against the left wall of\nhis cell with the left side of his body\nagainst the wall.\" He further noted that\n\"[Matt] had his window partially covered\nwith toilet paper making it somewhat\ndifficult to see into his cell.\"\nSchroeder, who was not regularly assigned\nto the segregation unit, decided not to\ntake any action. He had been instructed\nthat he should assume inmates who ignored\nhim were simply refusing supplies.\n\n  Schroeder claims that he returned to\nMatt’s cell at 2:57 p.m. with officer\nGlenn Gilgenbach, another guard-\ndefendant. Gilgenbach offered Matt his\ndinner several times and Matt did not\nrespond. Schroeder wrote in his report\nthat \"I then went to the window and\nobserved that he hadn’t moved since\nsupplies were offered, nine minites [sic]\nago.\" Schroeder then attempted to call\nthe sergeant for the segregation block,\nAnn Ingolia, but was unable to reach her\nbecause the battery in his radio was\ndead.\n\n  At approximately 3:00 p.m., Schroeder\nleft to retrieve Ingolia. Ingolia\nfollowed Schroeder to the door of the\ncell, peered inside, and noticed that\nMatt had a sheet around his neck. She\ninstructed Gilgenbach and Schroeder to\ncontinue feeding the other inmates while\nshe called Captain Don Strahota to alert\nhim to a possible suicide. Ingolia then\nreturned to the cell to wait for the\nfirst responders. Upon arrival, they\nattempted unsuccessfully to revive Matt.\nAt 3:10 p.m., rescue efforts ceased and\nMatt was pronounced dead. Matt was last\nseen alive by the defendants at 10:00\na.m.\n\n  The prison file provided to the doctor\nwho performed the autopsy indicated \"a\npast history of suicide attempt\" and\nfurther disclosed that, as of February 7,\n1998, Matt was \"psychotic but in\nremission with a Navane treatment.\"\nMatt’s weight was estimated at 110-120\npounds. The autopsy concluded that \"[a]\ndiagnosis of suicide is reasonable but it\nsure would have been nice to have him\nmore persuaded to take medication and\nseek psychiatric help.\"\n\n  Mrs. Sanville filed this lawsuit in the\nUnited States District Court for the\n\fEastern District of Wisconsin on July 25,\n1999, raising federal claims under 42\nU.S.C. sec. 1983-- alleging that the\nvarious defendants violated Matt’s Eighth\nAmendment rights--and pendent state law\nnegligence and medical malpractice\nclaims. The defendants moved to dismiss\nthe action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and\nfiled a corresponding motion for a\nprotective order prohibiting discovery\nuntil the court ruled on the motion to\ndismiss. On June 29, 2000, the court\ngranted defendants’ motion to dismiss the\nfederal claims on qualified immunity\ngrounds and declined to retain\njurisdiction of the ancillary state law\nnegligence claims.

The need for a mental illness\nto be treated could certainly be\nconsidered a serious medical need. See\nid. at 853 (citing Hudson v.

Further, there is the\nadditional possibility that Matt was\nphysically unable to eat the nutri-loaf\nthat he was being served (the complaint\nstates both that he refused his food and\nthat he was unable to eat it). We have\nheld that withholding food from an inmate\ncan, in some circumstances, satisfy the\nfirst Farmer prong. See id. (recognizing\nthat \"the amount and duration of the\ndeprivation\" would be relevant to whether\nthe deprivation amounted to an objective\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment).\nWhether these facts would support a\nfinding that Matt was denied food is not\nsomething we need to resolve, as we have\nalready concluded that Matt demonstrated\na serious medical need.\n\n  We therefore turn to the second element\nof the Farmer framework: whether the\ndefendants were deliberately indifferent\nto the risk that Matt would commit\nsuicide. See Pardue, 94 F.3d at 261. The\nmeaning of the \"deliberate indifference\"\nprong has recently been clarified by the\nSupreme Court: \"a prison official cannot\nbe found liable under the Eighth\nAmendment for denying an inmate humane\nconditions of confinement unless the\nofficial knows of and disregards an\n\fexcessive risk to inmate health or\nsafety; the official must both be aware\nof facts from which the inference could\nbe drawn that a substantial risk of\nserious harm exists, and he must also\ndraw the inference.\" Farmer, 511 U.S. at\n837. With this framework in mind, we\nconsider Mrs. Sanville’s claims against\nthe various defendants.\n\n1. The Medical Defendants: Cihlar,\nPareek, Fleck/4\n\n  Plaintiff alleges that the doctors knew\nthat Matt’s refusal to accept care was a\nsymptom of his mental illness and that by\ndeferring to his stated wishes, they\ndeliberately disregarded the substantial\nrisk that he would commit suicide. Thus,\nbecause they allowed him to remain\nunmedicated without taking further\nprecautions to ensure his safety,\nplaintiff alleges that the doctors were\ndeliberately indifferent to Matt’s\nserious medical need.\n\n  This situation is undeniably tragic. Yet\n\"a complaint that a physician has been\nnegligent in diagnosing or treating a\nmedical condition does not state a valid\nclaim of medical mistreatment under the\nEighth Amendment.\" Estelle v. Gamble, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109561\"><a href=\"/opinion/109561/estelle-v-gamble/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 106, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109561\"><a href=\"/opinion/109561/estelle-v-gamble/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

To avoid dismissal, Mrs.\nSanville must plead sufficient facts to\ndemonstrate that a fact-finder could\ninfer deliberate indifference from the\ndoctors’ treatment decisions.\n\"[D]eliberate indifference may be\ninferred . . . when the medical\nprofessional’s decision is such a\nsubstantial departure from accepted\nprofessional judgment, practice, or\nstandards as to demonstrate that the\nperson responsible did not base the\ndecision on such a judgment.\" Pardue, 94\nF.3d at 261-62. We examine Mrs.\nSanville’s claims against each of the\ndoctor-defendants in turn.\n\n  Plaintiff asserts that Dr. Cihlar,\nduring the screening interview at Dodge,\nincorrectly found that Matt did not have\na mental health illness and that he was\nnot medicated with anti-psychotics. While\nDr. Cihlar’s conclusions about Matt’s\nmental health may have been negligently\ndrawn, stating that Matt did not have a\nmental illness does not establish\ndeliberate indifference to Matt’s\n\fcondition. To violate the Eighth\nAmendment the official must knowingly\ndisregard a substantial risk to inmate\nhealth or safety, see Farmer, 511 U.S. at\n837. Not noticing that an inmate exhibits\na serious medical need does not violate\nthe Constitution because not noticing\nthat a need exists is not considered\n\"punishment\" under relevant Supreme Court\nprecedent. See id. at 837-38./5\nFurther, we note that his failure to\nrecognize Matt’s condition did not\nprevent Matt from getting subsequent\ntreatment for his mental illness.\n\n  Mrs. Sanville accuses Dr. Pareek and Dr.\nFleck of failing to provide treatment and\nmedication to Matt even though they were\naware of Matt’s history of mental\nillness, which was well-documented in his\nbase file at WCI. She also claimed that\nthey knew that Matt was incapable of\nmaking his own decisions regarding\nmedication and that he had a history of\nasking for help and then denying any need\nfor it. Dr. Pareek advised Matt to\ndiscontinue taking his medication--based\nupon his professional judgment that the\nmedicine was causing Matt’s stomachaches-\n-and later determined that Matt was\ncompetent and did not need to be\nmedicated. While plaintiff takes issue\nwith the correctness of these decisions,\na complaint that a physician negligently\ntreated Matt’s mental illness does not\nstate a valid Eighth Amendment medical\nmistreatment claim. See Estelle, 429 U.S.\nat 107. Plaintiff thus asserts that\nadvising Matt to stop taking his\nmedication was such a substantial\ndeparture from accepted professional\njudgment that a jury could infer\ndeliberate indifference. To determine\nwhether this is the case, we ask whether\na minimally competent doctor in Dr.\nPareek’s shoes would have been aware of a\nsubstantial risk that allowing Matt to\nremain unmedicated would result in\nserious harm. See Pardue, 94 F.3d at 262-\n63. Here, we cannot find that the risk\nwas such that Dr. Pareek’s actions were\ndeliberately indifferent. Matt saw Dr.\nPareek on March 5, March 26, April 2, and\nin late June of 1998. The last of these\ndates was over a month before Matt\ncommitted suicide. In April, Matt stated\nthat he no longer wanted medication or\npsychiatric services, and Dr. Pareek\ndeferred to those wishes. At the time of\nDr. Pareek’s June visit, Matt had been\n\foff his medication for three months\n(since March 5) and there is no\nindication that Matt was, at that time,\nsuicidal or in danger of harming himself.\nRecognizing that \"a medical professional\nmust consider [an inmate’s] conflicting\nrights,\" Dr. Pareek seemingly determined\nthat Matt’s desire to be free from\nmedication outweighed his right (or need)\nto receive psychotropic drugs for his\nmental illness. See Pardue, 94 F.3d at\n262 (noting that an inmate had both an\nEighth Amendment right to be restrained\nso that he would not injure himself and a\nFourteenth Amendment right to be free\nfrom restraint).\n\n  Although we wish Dr. Pareek could have\nprevented Matt’s suicide, physicians do\nnot practice with a crystal ball in hand.\nWe thus conclude that plaintiff has not\npresented evidence from which a trier of\nfact could find that Dr. Pareek was\ndeliberately indifferent to the\nsubstantial risk that Matt would commit\nsuicide. See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837.\n\n  Finally, we turn to Dr. Fleck. Dr. Fleck\nsaw Matt two times in the days\nimmediately preceding Matt’s suicide, and\nhis notes indicate that he was concerned\nabout Matt’s welfare. He recommended that\nMatt come in for a face-to-face visit and\nthat he see Dr. Pareek to discuss the\noption of medication. Matt responded by\nstating: \"I don’t need any drugs, I’m\nhandling it myself.\" Mrs. Sanville points\nout that Matt was dangerously underweight\nat the time of Dr. Fleck’s June 27, 1998\nvisit. She alleges that, by deferring to\nthe opinion of a mentally ill and\nsuicidal inmate, Dr. Fleck abdicated his\nprofessional judgment and that, at the\nleast, he should have taken extra\nprecautions with regard to Matt’s health\nand well-being. These claims are\nundeniably emotionally appealing. That a\ndoctor would defer to the discretion of a\nmentally ill inmate may be troubling to a\nlayperson, particularly when the doctor\nappeared to recognize that Matt needed to\nbe medicated. And we would hope that\nadditional precautions would have been\ntaken if they were thought to be\nnecessary. Plaintiff has not provided us\nwith any reason, however, to find that\nDr. Fleck’s choices were not made in the\nexercise of his professional judgment.\nWhile Mrs. Sanville would have preferred\nthe doctor to be less deferential to\n\fMatt’s requests and more forceful in pur\nsuing the option of medicating him, we\nagree with the district court that Dr.\nFleck’s actions and medical notes counsel\nagainst a finding of deliberate\nindifference. Sanville, slip op. at 21.\n\n  In sum, the evidence does not support a\nfinding that the medical professionals at\nWCI were deliberately indifferent to\nMatt’s serious medical needs. He was seen\nby medical professionals eleven times\nover the five months that he was\nincarcerated and most of these visits\ntook place shortly after they were\nrequested. Plaintiff points to Dr.\nFlick’s failure to see Matt promptly\nafter his July 27th request, yet Dr.\nFlick had already seen Matt once that\nday. There is no indication that the\ndoctor was aware that Matt was suicidal\nor in serious harm at that time (if, in\nfact, Matt was suicidal at that time).\nFurther, Dr. Flick did not even receive\nthe request until July 28th, at which\ntime he scheduled Matt for an appointment\non July 30th. Under the circumstances,\nthis delay cannot be considered\ndeliberately indifferent. See Gutierrez\nv. Peters, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739932\"><a href=\"/opinion/739932/carlos-m-gutierrez-v-howard-a-peters-iii-director-illinois-department/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1364</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1374 (7th Cir.\n1997) (finding no deliberate indifference\nwhere the inmate \"repeatedly received\ntreatment over [a] ten-month period and\nthat at most he experienced an isolated\noccasion or two where he did not receive\nprompt treatment\"); cf. Reed, 178 F.3d at\n855-56 (distinguishing prior Seventh\nCircuit cases where \"the totality of the\n[inmate’s] medical care\" counseled\nagainst a finding of deliberate\nindifference, and holding that the court\nwas faced with one of those instances in\nwhich \"mistreatment for a short time\nwould be evidence of a culpable state of\nmind\") (quotation omitted).\n\n  It is troubling that this young man’s\nsuicide might have been prevented had he\nbeen taking his prescribed psychotropic\nmedication. The ultimate problem seems to\nbe that none of the doctors ever noted\nthat Matt might be a suicide risk, an\nobservation that would not have seemed\ntoo obscure considering his mental\nillness and history of suicide attempts.\nYet the doctors’ failure to correctly\ndiagnose and treat Matt is not, in this\ninstance, evidence of anything more than\nmedical malpractice. Though we find that\nplaintiff’s claims against the doctor-\n\fdefendants were properly dismissed by the\ndistrict court, we note that plaintiff is\ncertainly free to pursue her state law\nmedical malpractice claims in state\ncourt./6\n\n2. The Guards: Scaburdine, Schroeder,\nGilgenbach, John Does Nos. 1-5/7\n\n  Mrs. Sanville accuses several\ncorrectional officers at WCI of knowing\nthat Matt was likely to commit suicide\nbut failing to reasonably respond to this\nrisk. To be liable under the Eighth\nAmendment for an inmate’s suicide, \"a\nprison official must be cognizant of the\nsignificant likelihood that an inmate may\nimminently seek to take his own life and\nmust fail to take reasonable steps to\nprevent the inmate from performing this\nact.\" Turbin, 226 F.3d at 529 (citations\nomitted). However, \"an Eighth Amendment\nclaimant need not show that a prison\nofficial acted or failed to act believing\nthat harm actually would befall an\ninmate; it is enough that the official\nacted or failed to act despite his\nknowledge of a substantial risk of\nserious harm.\" Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842.\nWhether a prison official had the\nrequisite knowledge is a question of\nfact. See id. If \"the circumstances\nsuggest that the defendant-official being\nsued had been exposed to information\nconcerning the risk and thus ’must have\nknown’ about it, then such evidence could\nbe sufficient to permit a trier of fact\nto find that the defendant-official had\nactual knowledge of the risk.\" Id. 842-\n43. Prison officials can still show that\nthey were unaware of the risk--this is a\nsubjective inquiry--or that they were\naware of the risk but that they responded\nreasonably to it, \"even if the harm\nultimately was not averted.\" Id. at 844-\n45. Thus we ask 1) were the prison\nofficials aware of the substantial risk\nthat Matt might take his own life and, if\nso, 2) did they \"take reasonable steps to\nprevent the inmate from performing this\nact.\" Turbin, 226 F.3d at 529.\n\na.   Awareness of the Substantial Risk\n\n  Plaintiff claims that, once Matt covered\nhis cell openings with toilet paper, the\nguards were aware of the substantial risk\nthat Matt would commit suicide. She\nasserts that the guards already knew: 1)\nthat Matt had written a last will and\n\ftestament contemplating his imminent\ndeath and telling his mother how to carry\non his affairs after he died; 2) that\nMatt told certain guards that he planned\nto commit suicide; 3) that he had\nattempted suicide in the past; 4) that he\nhad a long history of mental illness; 5)\nthat he was not eating and was\ndangerously thin; and 6) that his mother\nhad called the prison to alert them that\nhe was paranoid, suicidal, and in\ntrouble.\n  It seems quite possible that, under the\nfacts as alleged by the plaintiff, the\nguards could have been aware of the risk\nthat Matt would commit suicide.\nParticularly if Matt told them that he\nwas suicidal, that alone should have been\nenough to \"impute awareness of a\nsubstantial risk of suicide.\" Turbin, 226\nF.3d at 529. It is true that \"strange be\nhavior alone, without indications that\nthat behavior has a substantial\nlikelihood of taking a suicidal turn, is\nnot sufficient to impute subjective\nknowledge of a high suicide risk to jail\npersonnel.\" Id. at 530. Thus, if the\ninmate was a normally functioning\nindividual with no history of mental\nillness or suicide attempts, who had not\nrecently lost nearly one-third of his\nbody weight or written letters to his\nmother contemplating his death, then\nmaybe papering up his cell would not be\nenough to put the guards on notice that\nsomething was wrong. Matt was not a\nnormally functioning individual, however,\nand it would not be inconsistent with the\nalleged facts to find that he did \"put\njail officials on notice that there was a\nsignificant likelihood that he would\nattempt to harm himself.\" Id. The Eighth\nAmendment does not allow officials to\nturn a blind eye to the activities of an\ninmate, particularly one who is suicidal.\nWe thus find that plaintiff’s complaint\nshould not have been dismissed because\nshe has alleged sufficient facts that, if\nproven, would entitle her to relief\nagainst the WCI guards. See Hall, 957\nF.2d at 405 (finding that plaintiff\nraised a genuine issue of material fact\nregarding the defendants’ knowledge of\nHoward’s suicidal tendencies); cf.\nTurbin, 226 F.3d at 534 (Williams, J.,\ndissenting) (\"[W]e have more than\nNovack’s strange and bizarre behavior. We\nalso have evidence that jail officials\nknew that Novack was a suicide risk and\nhad a possible mental illness.\").\n\f  Defendants contend that they were not\naware of any risk that Matt would harm\nhimself, and assert that plaintiff cannot\nsurvive the first Farmer prong. We find\ntheir arguments unconvincing. First,\ndefendants contend that the only way the\nguards would have known many of these\nfacts is if they had read Matt’s prison\nfile, which they characterize as an\nunreasonable endeavor. While we do not\nneed to address whether the guards should\nbe familiar with the mental health\nhistories of the prison’s inmates, it\nseems contrary to defendants’ assertions\nthat the guards could have been aware of\nmany of the facts alleged by plaintiff\nwithout reading Matt’s file (for example:\nthat Mrs. Sanville had called the prison\nto express concern over Matt’s condition,\nand that Matt had written a last will and\ntestament, lost a significant amount of\nweight, and said that he planned to\ncommit suicide). Second, defendants\nallege that the fact that Matt was\nrequesting food other than the nutri-loaf\nand that he had filed a complaint the\nweek before his suicide indicates that\nthe guards would not have thought that\nMatt was a substantial suicide risk. What\nthe guards thought, however, is not an\nissue for us to resolve--it is an issue\nfor a trier of fact. See Farmer, 511 U.S.\nat 842. Third, the defendants criticize\nthe plaintiff for doing nothing more than\nalleging facts. Yet, under the\nrequirements of notice pleading, Mrs.\nSanville does not have to prove her\nfactual and legal allegations at this\nstage, she need only show that relief is\npossible. See Conley, 355 U.S. at 45-46;\nBartholet v. Reishauer A.G. (Zurich), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575872\"><a href=\"/opinion/575872/emil-j-bartholet-v-reishauer-ag-zurich-and-reishauer-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1073</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1078 (7th Cir. 1992).\nPlaintiff has certainly met this\nstandard. Of course, this is not the end\nof the inquiry. During discovery, the\nparties will undoubtedly explore in\ngreater detail whether the \"prison\nofficial[s] had the requisite knowledge\nof a substantial risk\" to Matt’s health.\nFarmer, 511 U.S. at 842.\n\nb. Whether the Defendants Took\nReasonable Steps\n\n  While it remains to be seen whether the\ndefendants were actually aware of the\nsubstantial risk to Matt’s health, there\nseems to be no evidence that the\ndefendants \"[took] reasonable steps to\n\fprevent the inmate from [committing\nsuicide]\" as is required by our case law.\nTurbin, 226 F.3d at 529. Matt was last\nseen alive by the defendants at 10:00\na.m. In the five hours during which\nMatt’s cell window was covered with\ntoilet paper, there was no apparent\nattempt to discern whether he was stable.\nThe guards did not use the video camera\nto check on Matt, nor did anyone take any\naction until approximately 3:00 p.m. If\nthe defendants were aware of the alleged\nrisk, failing to determine what was going\non in Matt’s cell could easily be\nconsidered egregious enough to rise to\nthe level of deliberate indifference. The\nevidence here clearly supports an\ninference that at least some of the\nguards, if not all of them, were aware of\nMatt’s serious medical need and\ndemonstrated deliberate indifference to\nthat need.\n\n  There are a number of reasons why\ndefendants assert that the guards cannot\nbe found liable, none of which we find\nmeritorious. Contrary to defendants’\nallegations, the fact that we have\nalready found that the doctors cannot be\nheld liable does not erect a legal bar\nthat prevents anyone else in the prison\nfrom being held liable. See Estelle, 429\nU.S. at 107-08 (finding that the claims\nagainst the doctor defendants amounted,\nat most, to medical malpractice, but\nremanded to the Court of Appeals for\nconsideration of \"whether a cause of\naction has been stated against the other\nprison officials\" including the prison\nwarden). Defendants further assert that\nthe guards cannot be held liable because\nthey relied upon the doctors’\ndetermination that Matt was not a suicide\nrisk. The record, however, at least as\ncurrently developed, does not support\nthis assertion. There is no evidence\nindicating that any of the doctors\nactually determined that Matt was not\nsuicidal, much less that they then\ninformed the guards that Matt was not\nsuicidal and that the guards then decided\nnot to act based on that information. Our\nreview is intended to determine whether\nthe plaintiff could prevail under any set\nof facts, not whether the defendant could\nwin under any set of facts. Likewise, the\nfact that Matt was seen by mental health\nprofessionals eleven times during his\nincarceration does not prevent us from\nfinding that someone--whether a guard or\n\fa warden or otherwise--was deliberately\nindifferent to his serious medical needs.\nThe guards’ liability is not premised\nupon the acts or omissions of the medical\nprofessionals, it is premised upon their\nown deliberate indifference to Matt’s\ncondition.\n\n  We will thus consider, subsequently,\nwhether this was a clearly established\nlaw at the time of defendants’ actions to\ndetermine whether this claim should be\nreinstated. We first turn to consider\nplaintiff’s claims against the final\ngroup of defendants--the wardens.\n\n3. The Wardens: Warden Gary McCaughtry,\nDeputy Warden Jane Gamble\n\n  Mrs. Sanville alleges that the wardens\nfailed to adopt and enforce adequate\nsuicide prevention policies and that they\nalso failed to train and supervise the\nguards and doctors./8 Because we have\nalready determined that plaintiff’s\nofficial capacity claims against\nMcCaughtry and Gamble should have been\ndismissed, we need only consider the\nclaims against the wardens in their\nindividual capacities. The plaintiff\nfaces a substantial challenge because\nfailure to train claims are usually\nmaintained against municipalities, not\nagainst individuals, see, e.g., Williams\nv. Heavener, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769276\"><a href=\"/opinion/769276/cynthia-williams-v-lindsey-heavener/\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">529</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 532 (7th Cir.\n2000); Kitzman-Kelley v.

See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 841\n(noting that the standard applied in City\nof Canton v. Harris, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112209\"><a href=\"/opinion/112209/canton-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">378</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 109 S.\nCt. 1197, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112209\"><a href=\"/opinion/112209/canton-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L.

A defendant\n\"will be deemed to have sufficient\npersonal responsibility if he directed\n\fthe conduct causing the constitutional\nviolation, or if it occurred with his\nknowledge or consent.\" Chavez, 251 F.3d\nat 652. This definition recognizes that\nthe individual does not have to have\nparticipated directly in the deprivation.\nSee McPhaul v. Board of Comm’rs of\nMadison Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770399\"><a href=\"/opinion/770399/cheryl-k-mcphaul-v-board-of-commissioners-of-madison-county-indiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">558</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 566 (7th Cir.\n2000) (quotation omitted). Thus, a\nsupervisor may be liable for \"deliberate,\nreckless indifference\" to the misconduct\nof subordinates. See Chavez, 251 F.3d at\n651. (\"The supervisors must know about\nthe conduct and facilitate it, approve\nit, condone it, or turn a blind eye for\nfear of what they might see.\")\n(quotations omitted).\n\n  Mrs. Sanville accuses defendants of\ntolerating a number of transgressions\nwhich she contends rose to the level of\nsystematic failure: 1) on four separate\noccasions, three guards ignored the paper\non Matt’s cell; 2) the camera in his cell\nwas not active the entire three weeks he\nwas in segregation; 3) Matt lost nearly\none-third of his body weight while in\nsegregation; and 4) the guards allegedly\nreceived no suicide prevention training.\nNone of these allegations, however,\nsuggest that the wardens were personally\nresponsible for any deprivation. Nor does\nplaintiff allege that they \"turned a\nblind eye\" to any particular conduct of\nthe remaining defendants. We thus agree\nwith the district court that plaintiff\nhas alleged no facts that would support a\nfinding of liability with respect to the\nwardens.\n\nC. Was the Right Clearly Established at\nthe Time of the Violation?\n  We must now consider whether the guards\nmay be held liable under sec. 1983, or\nwhether they are entitled to qualified\nimmunity. We have recently set forth the\nframework for making this determination:\n\nQualified immunity protects government\nofficials from individual liability under\nSection 1983 for actions taken while\nperforming discretionary functions,\nunless their conduct violates clearly\nestablished statutory or constitutional\nrights of which a reasonable person would\nhave known. Thus, before liability will\nattach, the contours of the right must be\nsufficiently clear that a reasonable\nofficial would understand that what he is\ndoing violates that right.\n\fBrokaw v.

There can be\nlittle debate that it was clearly\nestablished, long before 1998, \"that\nprison officials will be liable under\nSection 1983 for a pretrial detainee’s\nsuicide if they were deliberately\nindifferent to a substantial suicide\nrisk.\" Hall, 957 F.2d at 406. Further,\n\"[i]t was clearly established in 1986\nthat police officers could not be\ndeliberately indifferent to a detainee\nwho is in need of medical attention\nbecause of a mental illness or who is a\nsubstantial suicide risk. Deliberate\nindifference to a prisoner’s medical\nneeds constitutes cruel and unusual\npunishment in violation of the Eighth\nAmendment.\" Id. at 404-05. Thus, we find\nthat the guards are not immune from\nindividual liability in this case./9\n\nIII. Conclusion\n\n  In light of the foregoing analysis, we\nAFFIRM the district court’s dismissal of\nMrs. Sanville’s Eighth Amendment claims\nagainst the doctor-defendants and the\nwardens, and REVERSE the district court’s\ndismissal of her claims against the\nguards.\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n/1 For the sake of clarity, we will refer to Matt\nSanville as \"Matt,\" and to Martha Sanville as\n\"Mrs. Sanville.\"\n\n/2 He wrote a letter to his mom, dated July 23,\n1998, stating: \"the guards are trying to feed me\ngag loaf (nasty)--I can’t eat it.\"\n\n/3 We take judicial notice of the fact that both\nthese entities are state prisons: the Waupun\nCorrectional Institution is a state penitentiary\nand the Dodge Correctional Institution is the\ncorrectional treatment center at Waupun. See Wis.\nStat. sec. 302.01.\n\n/4 Plaintiff’s complaint also challenged the actions\nof Narinder Saini, Ph.D., and Gary Ankarlo, Ph.D.\nOn appeal, plaintiff did not present analysis\nwith respect to these doctors, thus we do not\naddress them here.\n\n/5 The Supreme Court has rejected the argument that,\nunder the subjective test for deliberate indif-\nference, \"prison officials will be free to ignore\n\fobvious dangers to inmates.\" Farmer, 511 U.S. at\n842. However, even if a risk is obvious--i.e.,\neven if it was well- documented in Matt’s file\nthat he had a mental illness that, if left\nuntreated, would pose substantial risk to his\nhealth--the prison official is not liable under\nthe Eighth Amendment if \"the obvious escaped\nhim.\" Id. at 843 n.8\n\n/6 The district court’s denial to exercise supple-\nmental jurisdiction over these claims is still\nappropriate given the disposition of those claims\nhere.\n\n/7 Plaintiff’s complaint also challenged the actions\nof Curtis Bender and Jodine Deppisch. On appeal,\nplaintiff did not present analysis with respect\nto these defendants, thus we do not address them\nhere.\n\n/8 The defendants contend that these allegations\nwere not in plaintiff’s district court complaint.\nWe found otherwise: both were included in Count\nI (alleging violations of Matt’s Eighth Amendment\nrights), paragraph 139.\n\n/9 The district court relied upon State Bank of St.\nCharles v.

Camic did not address quali-\nfied immunity; rather, that case found that the\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment was\nproper because the plaintiff did not raise \"a\nquestion of material fact as to whether the\ndefendants had knowledge of . . . suicidal ten-\ndencies on the part of [the inmate].\" Camic, 712\nF.2d at 1146.\n\f</pre>",
