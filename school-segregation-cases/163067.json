With her on the brief were Wilma A. \nLewis, U.S. Attorney, and R. Craig Lawrence, Assistant U.S. \nAttorney.\n\n\f     Before:  Sentelle, Henderson and Garland, Circuit \nJudges.\n\n     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Garland.\n\n     Garland, Circuit Judge:  Plaintiffs are black American \ncitizens of Panamanian or Hispanic national origin who have \nlong worked for the Panama Canal Commission and its \npredecessor, the Panama Canal Company (together, the \n\"PCC\" or \"Canal Commission\").  The PCC pays them sub-\nstantially less in salary and benefits than it pays other \nAmerican citizens working at the same jobs--the overwhelm-\ning majority of whom are white, non-Panamanians.  The \nplaintiffs allege this pay differential constitutes race and \nnational origin discrimination in violation of Title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964, Pub. L. No. 88-352, 78 Stat. 241 \n(codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. ss 2000e to 2000e-17 \n(1994)).  The district court granted summary judgment in \nfavor of the PCC and dismissed plaintiffs' complaint.  We \nreverse.\n\n                                I\n\n     The Canal Commission is a wholly-owned United States \ngovernment corporation.  The thirteen plaintiffs were hired \nby the PCC before 1979, and all but two before 1976.  Compl. \n pp 4-16.  One has since retired.  Id.  All the plaintiffs are \ncurrently United States citizens:  eleven were naturalized \nbetween 1987 and 1994;  one became a citizen in 1977 follow-\ning his service in the military;  and the remaining plaintiff is \nthe son of a United States citizen whose citizenship was not \nregistered with the U.S. Embassy until 1991.  Id.  The PCC \ndenies plaintiffs three types of benefits that it grants to other \nemployees, which generates the pay differential of which they \ncomplain.\n\n     The first benefit is the so-called \"tropical differential,\" the \ncurrent version of which was authorized by Congress in the \nPanama Canal Act of 1979, 22 U.S.C. s 3657.  The differen-\ntial, paid as a \"recruitment or retention\" incentive, is a 15% \nincrement above the employee's basic pay.  Id. s 3657(a);  see \n35 C.F.R. s 251.31(a).  Under the statute it is available to \n\n\f\"any\" employee who meets the eligibility requirements, with-\nout reference to the nature of the employee's job.  Anyone \nemployed before October 1, 19791 is statutorily eligible for the \nbenefit, regardless of citizenship or place of recruitment, as is \nanyone recruited after that date from outside Panama.  22 \nU.S.C. s 3657(a).  Because all plaintiffs were employed be-\nfore October 1, 1979, all are eligible under the statutory \ncriteria.\n\n     The Canal Commission, however, has chosen to restrict \neligibility further than Congress required.  Under the PCC's \nregulations, only American citizens are eligible for the tropi-\ncal differential.  35 C.F.R. s 251.31(a).  Moreover, employees \nhired from within Panama (\"Panamanian hires\") are eligible \nonly if they also come within a \"grandfather clause\" the PCC \nadopted in 1976--which requires that they were employed \nand receiving the differential no later than July 3, 1976.  See \nid. s 251.31(c).  This effectively limits the eligibility of Pana-\nmanian hires to those who already were American citizens on \nthat date.2  This requirement disqualifies all of the plaintiffs.\n\n     The second benefit is known as the \"equity adjustment \npackage,\" and consists of free rent and electricity in PCC \nhousing, as well as certain travel and educational benefits.  \nPls. Br. at 15.  For many years, the PCC operated subsidized \nstores where employees who were American citizens could \npurchase goods at prices below those available elsewhere in \n\n__________\n     1  The Panama Canal Treaty of 1977 took effect on this date.\n\n     2  Prior to the Canal Act, the Canal Commission was authorized \nto pay the tropical differential to all U.S. citizens, but only to U.S. \ncitizens.  See Pub. L. No. 85-550, s 7, 72 Stat. 405, 407-08 (1958).  \nIn 1976, the PCC by regulation limited payment to those who were \nrecruited from outside of Panama, but grandfathered in those \nlocally-hired citizen-employees who had been working since July 3, \n1976 and receiving the differential (and hence who had been citi-\nzens) as of that date.  PCC Br. at 5.  The Commission chose to \nretain those limitations after the Canal Act was passed in 1979.  See \n35 C.F.R. s 251.31(b)(1)(i);  id. s 251.31(c)(1);  see also PCC Br. at \n6.\n\n\fPanama.  See PCC Cross-Motion (Dist. Ct. Record Entry \n[hereinafter \"R.\"] 13), Ex. 37.  As part of the Panama Canal \nTreaty of 1977, the United States agreed to close those \nstores.  PCC citizen-employees, however, were permitted to \nshop in military commissaries for a limited period of time \nending September 30, 1984.  Effective October 1, 1984, Con-\ngress authorized an allowance for any U.S. citizen (as of the \ntime the benefits are received) who was employed on Septem-\nber 30, 1979, regardless of place of recruitment.  The allow-\nance was also authorized for anyone recruited after Septem-\nber 30, 1979 from outside Panama, regardless of citizenship.  \n22 U.S.C. s 3646.  From 1984-89, five plaintiffs were eligible \nunder these statutory criteria and received the equity pack-\nage benefits.\n\n     On December 29, 1989, the last American administrator of \nthe Canal changed the PCC's policy and imposed additional \neligibility requirements on Panamanian hires.  Under these \nnew criteria, an employee hired from within Panama is eligi-\nble for the equity package only if he or she was employed on \nSeptember 30, 1979 and was a citizen before October 1, 1984.  \nSee PCC Cross-Motion (R. 13), Exs. 20, 54.  As a conse-\nquence of the new criteria, four plaintiffs who had been \nreceiving the equity package lost their benefits.  Pls. Br. at \n16;  PCC Br. at 8.\n\n     The final benefits at issue are travel and home leave \nvacation benefits.  An employee hired from within Panama is \neligible if he or she was employed on September 30, 1979 and \nwas a citizen as of that date.  An employee recruited from \noutside of Panama is eligible regardless of date of employ-\nment or citizenship.  PCC Cross-Motion (R. 13), Ex. 67.  The \ndate-of-citizenship requirement disqualifies all but one of the \nplaintiffs.  Compl. pp 4-16.3\n\n     Between June 2, 1995 and July 3, 1996, the plaintiffs filed \nformal complaints with the PCC's Office of Equal Opportuni-\nty alleging that their exclusion from these salary and benefit \nprograms constituted race and national origin discrimination.  \n\n__________\n     3  As is evident from the description of the three benefit pro-\ngrams, and as the PCC conceded at oral argument, plaintiffs are not \ndisqualified by statute from receiving the benefits at issue in this \ncase.  Only the PCC's discretionary policies render them ineligible.\n\nPls. Br. at 3.  The PCC accepted most of the claims for \ninvestigation.4  After completing the investigation, however, it \ndismissed the claims as untimely, ruling that plaintiffs should \nhave filed years earlier when the benefit policies were first \napplied to them.\n\n     In December 1996, the plaintiffs brought an action in \ndistrict court, alleging that the denial of the three benefit \npackages constituted intentional disparate treatment, and had \nan unlawful disparate impact, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \ns 2000e-2.5 Plaintiffs relied on statistical evidence, as well as \non an attack on the rationales offered by the PCC for denying \nthem the benefits.  They contended that the date-of-\ncitizenship requirements were mere pretext, guaranteeing \ncontinued benefits to white non-Panamanians while denying \nthem to black Panamanian employees, the vast majority of \nwhom did not become citizens until after the cut-off dates.6  \nThey also proffered evidence of what they contended was the \nPanama Canal's \"longstanding history of discriminating \nagainst employees from the West Indies in every aspect of \nCanal life and employment,\" symbolized, they said, by a \nracially-based payroll system in which white Canal workers \nwere paid in gold from a \"gold roll,\" while black Panamanians \n__________\n     4  The PCC declined to accept the complaints of two plaintiffs \nregarding the equity package, on the ground that those plaintiffs \nhad already filed formal grievances.  See 5 U.S.C. s 7121(d) (bar-\nring federal employees from raising discrimination charges through \nboth negotiated grievance and administrative complaint proce-\ndures).  The district court did not consider this issue, and because \nit appears to involve factfinding we leave it for that court's initial \nconsideration on remand.\n\n     5  The plaintiffs also alleged a violation of the Fifth Amendment, \nan argument not pressed on this appeal.\n\n     6  In conjunction with the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977, Con-\ngress amended U.S. immigration laws to make it easier for non-\ncitizen employees of the PCC to become U.S. citizens.  The amend-\nments made Panamanian-born Canal employees residing in the \nCanal Zone, as well as their spouses and children, eligible for \n\"special immigrant\" status, which in turn made them permanent \nresidents and eligible for naturalization.  See 8 U.S.C. \ns 1101(a)(27)(E)-(G).  Eleven of the plaintiffs became U.S. citizens \npursuant to this legislation.  Pls. Br. at 10.\n\nwere paid in less-valuable Panamanian silver.  Pls. Br. at 21.  \n\"[P]ayment of the tropical differential to some employees and \nnot others,\" they contended, reflected nothing more than \"a \ncontinuation of the 'gold' and 'silver' roll wage differentials \nwhich were based on race.\"  Id. at 35.\n\n     The district court granted summary judgment in favor of \nthe Commission and dismissed the case.  The court rejected \nplaintiffs' disparate treatment claim, concluding they were \ndenied benefits because of their \"citizenship, not because of \nmembership in a Title VII protected class.\"  Anderson v. \nZubieta, 977 F. Supp. 439, 441-42 (D.D.C. 1997).  The court \ndenied the disparate impact claim on the ground that, al-\nthough disparate impact \"may be true as a matter of fact,\" \nthere was \"no evidence that the Defendant acted with any \nunlawful discriminatory purpose.\"  Id. at 442.  This appeal \nfollowed.\n\n                                II\n\n     As an initial matter, we must decide whether plaintiffs \ntimely filed their claims with the PCC's Office of Equal \nOpportunity.  Regulations issued by the Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission (EEOC) require federal employees \nto bring Title VII complaints to the attention of an Equal \nEmployment Opportunity counselor within 45 calendar days \nof the alleged discriminatory event.  See 29 C.F.R. \ns 1614.105(a)(1).  A plaintiff's administrative complaint is un-\ntimely unless it is brought within the 45-day limitations \nperiod, or unless the plaintiff establishes a basis for equitable \ntolling.  See id. s 1614.107(b).\n\n     After investigating plaintiffs' complaints, the PCC rejected \nthem as untimely.  The Canal Commission had amended the \nbenefit policies in question in 1976, 1979, and 1989.  The \nplaintiffs, all of whom became citizens between 1977 and 1994, \nreceived notice that they were not entitled to the benefits on \nvarious dates ranging from July 13, 1977 to July 7, 1994.  See \nPCC Stmt. of Material Facts (R. 16).  None brought a \ncomplaint within 45 days of either the amendments or the \nnotice;  the first complaint was not brought until June 2, 1995.  \n\n\fOn that basis, the PCC concluded plaintiffs' administrative \ncomplaints were filed too late.\n\n     The plaintiffs respond that their complaints allege continu-\ning violations of Title VII, actionable upon receipt of each \npaycheck.  We agree.  As a unanimous Supreme Court said \nin Bazemore v. Friday, \"[e]ach week's paycheck that delivers \nless to a black than to a similarly situated white is a wrong \nactionable under Title VII, regardless of the fact that this \npattern was begun prior\" to the limitations period.  478 U.S. \n385, 395 (1986) (Brennan, J., concurring, joined by all other \nMembers of the Court).  The Courts of Appeals have re-\npeatedly reached the same conclusion.7\n\n     The Canal Commission bases its contrary position on a line \nof Supreme Court cases beginning with United Air Lines v. \nEvans, 431 U.S. 553 (1977).  In Evans, defendant had dis-\ncriminatorily dismissed the plaintiff in 1968, pursuant to a \npolicy barring married female flight attendants.  When it \n\n__________\n     7  See Ashley v. Boyle's Famous Corned Beef Co., 66 F.3d 164, \n167-68 (8th Cir. 1995) (en banc);  Brinkley-Obu v. Hughes Train-\ning, Inc., 36 F.3d 336, 345-49 (4th Cir. 1994) (\"Our cases demon-\nstrate ... that in a compensation discrimination case, the issuance \nof each diminished paycheck constitutes a discriminatory act.\");  \nBeavers v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., 975 F.2d 792, 796-800 \n(11th Cir. 1992);  EEOC v. Penton Indus. Publ'g Co., 851 F.2d 835, \n838 (6th Cir. 1988) (recognizing that \"where an employer continues \nto presently impose disparate work assignment or pay rates be-\ntween similarly situated employee groups\" a continuing violation \nexists);  Gibbs v. Pierce County Law Enforcement Support Agency, \n785 F.2d 1396, 1399 (9th Cir. 1986) (\"The policy of paying lower \nwages ... on each payday constitutes a 'continuing violation.' \") \n(internal quotation omitted);  see also Miller v. Beneficial Manage-\nment Corp., 977 F.2d 834, 843-44 (3d Cir. 1992) (applying continu-\ning violations doctrine to unequal pay claim under Equal Pay Act);  \nSatz v. ITT Fin. Corp., 619 F.2d 738, 743 (8th Cir. 1980) (\"The \npractice of paying discriminatorily unequal pay occurs not only \nwhen an employer sets pay levels, but as long as the discriminatory \ndifferential continues.\").  But cf. Hendrix v. City of Yazoo, 911 F.2d \n1102, 1103-05 (5th Cir. 1990) (holding that discriminatory pay \nreduction under Fair Labor Standards Act does not constitute \ncontinuing violation).\n\nrehired plaintiff in 1972 after changing the policy, it did not \ngive her any seniority credit for her earlier service.  Suing in \n1973, plaintiff conceded that a claim for her 1968 dismissal \nwas untimely, but contended that the seniority system imper-\nmissibly gave present effect to that past act of discrimination.  \nThe Court held the challenge to defendant's neutral seniority \nsystem time barred notwithstanding that present effect.  Id. \nat 558.\n\n     The second case in the Evans line, Delaware State College \nv. Ricks, 449 U.S. 250 (1980), involved a professor's claim of \nunlawful termination by a university.  The Court held that \nthe limitations period was triggered at the moment the \nuniversity allegedly denied plaintiff tenure for a discriminato-\nry reason, rather than a year later when he ultimately lost his \njob.  In the third case, Lorance v. AT&T Technologies, Inc., \n490 U.S. 900, 903 (1989), the Court held that when a seniority \nsystem was \"not alleged to be discriminatory on its face or as \npresently applied,\" a complaint contending it was originally \nadopted for discriminatory reasons (outside the limitations \nperiod) was time barred.\n\n     The Evans-Ricks-Lorance line of cases does not support \nthe Canal Commission's contention that plaintiffs' claims are \ntime barred.  To the contrary, the Lorance Court's explana-\ntion of the difference between that line and Bazemore makes \nit clear that the opposite is true.  As Lorance explained, \nBazemore was a case in which plaintiffs contended not just \nthat the pay system was originally adopted for discriminatory \nreasons, but that it continued to discriminate unlawfully each \ntime it was applied.  Lorance, 490 U.S. at 912 n.5.  \"There is \nno doubt,\" Justice Scalia said, that a system \"that treats \nsimilarly situated employees differently ... can be challenged \nat any time.\"  Id. at 912.  By contrast, in Lorance, \"[p]eti-\ntioners [did] not allege that the seniority system treat[ed] \nsimilarly situated employees differently or that it ha[d] been \noperated in an intentionally discriminatory manner.  Rather, \nthey claim[ed] that its differential impact on the sexes [was] \n\n\funlawful because the system 'ha[d] its genesis in [sex] dis-\ncrimination.' \"  Id. at 905.8\n\n     Similarly, Lorance explained that in Evans the plaintiff did \nnot contend that the present seniority system was discrimina-\ntory, but rather \"asserted a claim that [was] wholly depen-\ndent on discriminatory conduct occurring well outside the \nperiod of limitations\"--that is, her dismissal in 1968.  Lor-\nance, 409 U.S. at 907-08;  see Evans, 431 U.S. at 560 (\"[R]e-\nspondent does not attack the bona fides of United's seniority \nsystem, and ... makes no charge that the system is inten-\ntionally designed to discriminate....\").  Likewise in Ricks, \nthe Lorance Court said, plaintiff \"did not claim that 'the \nmanner in which his employment was terminated differed \ndiscriminatorily from the manner in which the College termi-\nnated other professors who had been denied tenure.' \"  Rath-\ner, the only alleged discrimination occurred earlier, when \nplaintiff had been demoted into the ranks of the untenured.  \nSee Lorance, 490 U.S. at 906 (quoting Ricks, 449 U.S. at 258).\n\n__________\n     8  The result in Lorance was also based in part on the fact that \n\"[s]eniority systems ... are afforded special treatment under Title \nVII.\"  Id. at 904 (quoting Trans World Airlines v. Hardison, 432 \nU.S. 63, 81 (1977)).  That special treatment, the Court said, was \"by \nreason of s 703(h), which states:\n\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, it shall \n     not be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to \n     apply different standards of compensation, or different terms, \n     conditions, or privileges of employment pursuant to a bona fide \n     seniority ... system, ... provided that such differences are \n     not the result of an intention to discriminate because of race, \n     color, religion, sex, or national origin....  \n     \nId. at 904-05 (quoting Title VII s 703(h), 42 U.S.C. s 2000e-2(h)).  \nThat section has no application to the benefits policies at issue here.  \nSee also 42 U.S.C. s 2000e-5(e)(2) (overruling Lorance's application \nto seniority systems by providing that an intentionally discriminato-\nry seniority system is a violation \"when ... adopted, when an \nindividual becomes subject to the seniority system, or when a \nperson aggrieved is injured by the application of the seniority \nsystem\") (added by Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166, \ns 112, 105 Stat. 1075, 1078-79 (1991)).\n\n     The plaintiffs here fall on the Bazemore rather than Evans \nside of the line drawn in Lorance.  They do not seek relief for \nthe PCC's initial announcement of its discriminatory policies, \nbut rather for their continued application.  Unlike the peti-\ntioners in Lorance, the plaintiffs in this case allege that the \nPCC's policy currently \"treats similarly situated employees \ndifferently.\"  Id. at 905.  Accordingly, under Lorance they \nmay challenge those policies \"at any time.\"  Id. at 912.\n\n     Defendant also seeks support in a series of our cases \nholding that, to establish a continuing violation, a plaintiff \nmust show \"a series of related acts, one or more of which falls \nwithin the limitations period, or the maintenance of a discrim-\ninatory system both before and during the [statutory] peri-\nod.\"  McKenzie v. Sawyer, 684 F.2d 62, 72 (D.C. Cir. 1982) \n(quoting Valentino v. United States Postal Serv., 674 F.2d 56, \n65 (D.C. Cir. 1982));  see Palmer v. Kelly, 17 F.3d 1490, 1496 \n(D.C. Cir. 1994) (citing Berger v. Iron Workers Reinforced \nRodmen Local 201, 843 F.2d 1395, 1422 (D.C. Cir. 1988)).  \nDefendant's quotation of McKenzie is accurate, but the line of \ncases it represents goes to an analytically different question \nthan the one we have just discussed.  Thus far, we have been \nconsidering the \"first question in the analysis of a continuing \nviolations claim,\" namely, \"whether an actual violation of Title \nVII occurred during the statutory period.\"  Palmer, 17 F.3d \nat 1496.  As noted above, plaintiffs have adequately alleged \nsuch a \"present violation.\"  See id. (quoting Evans, 431 U.S. \nat 558).  As explained below, that claim survives summary \njudgment.  If plaintiffs' claim of a present violation is ulti-\nmately proven, it will justify their request to be made whole \nfor those paychecks received during the 45-day window and \nfor all paychecks issued thereafter.\n\n     Like most plaintiffs, however, the plaintiffs here want more \nthan that.  They also want to reach back and obtain compen-\nsation for the lower paychecks they received prior to the 45-\nday limitations period.9  It is to this \"next question\" that our \n\n__________\n     9  They concede, however, that this claim is bounded by 42 \nU.S.C. s 2000e-5(g)(1), which limits back pay to two years prior to \n\n\fcases refer when they require that a present violation be \neither \"part of a series of related discriminatory acts or ... \ncaused by a discriminatory system in effect both before and \nduring the limitations period.\"  Id.10\n\n     Plaintiffs plainly satisfy this test as well.  Indeed, they \nallege that their current lower paychecks and benefits are \nboth part of a series of such discriminatory payments and \ncaused by the continued maintenance of a broadly discrimina-\ntory pay and benefits system.  Plaintiffs do not merely \nchallenge \"separate and distinct\" events, see Stoller v. Marsh, \n682 F.2d 971, 975 (D.C. Cir. 1982), but rather allege that the \n\"current violations\" they have identified \"were taken pursu-\nant to the same employment policy as the actions sought to \nbe challenged outside the normally applicable limitations peri-\nod.\"  Berger, 843 F.2d at 1422 (citing Evans, 431 U.S. at 558).  \n\"Where, as here, discrimination is not limited to isolated \nincidents, but pervades a series or pattern of events which \ncontinue to within [45] days of the filing of the charge ... , \nthe filing is timely ... regardless of when the first discrimi-\nnatory incident occurred.\"  Laffey v.

But the portions of both Stoller and Smith-Haynie cited by \nthe PCC do not discuss the continuing violations doctrine, which \ndeems certain claims to be timely filed within the limitations period, \nbut rather discuss the criteria for the equitable tolling doctrine, \nwhich permits the tolling of that period.

Id.  \nDisparate impact claims, on the other hand, \"involve employ-\nment practices that are facially neutral in their treatment of \ndifferent groups but that in fact fall more harshly on one \ngroup than another and cannot be justified by business \nnecessity.\"  Id. at 336 n.15.  \"Proof of discriminatory motive \n... is not required under a disparate-impact theory.\" Id.\n\n     The familiar three-step evidentiary framework for proving \na disparate treatment case was set forth in McDonnell Doug-\nlas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973).  The plaintiffs must \nfirst establish a prima facie case, the elements of which vary \naccording to the circumstances.  Id. at 802 & n.13.  For a \nprima facie case of wage discrimination, plaintiffs must show \n\"membership in a protected class ... , and that [they] were \nperforming work substantially equal to that of white employ-\nees who were compensated at higher rates than they were.\"  \nCoward v. ADT Sec. Sys., Inc., 140 F.3d 271, 273 (D.C. Cir. \n1998) (internal quotations and alterations omitted);  see id. at \n275.  Once plaintiffs establish a prima facie case of disparate \ntreatment, under the second step of McDonnell Douglas \n\"[t]he burden then must shift to the employer to articulate \nsome legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\" for the challenged \nemployment practice.  McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802.  \nIf the defendant carries this burden, the third step requires \nthat plaintiffs be \"afforded a fair opportunity to show that \n[the] stated reason ... was in fact pretext\" for discrimination.  \nId. at 804.  For a disparate treatment case finally to reach \nthe jury, the court must find in light of all the evidence that \n\"the plaintiff has met his burden of showing that a reasonable \njury could conclude that he had suffered [intentional] discrim-\nination.\"  Aka v. Washington Hosp. Ctr., 156 F.3d 1284, 1290 \n(D.C. Cir. 1998) (en banc).\n\n     In a disparate impact case, a three-step, burden-shifting \nframework is also employed.  As with disparate treatment, \nthe plaintiff must first make out a prima facie case.  Albe-\n\n\fmarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 425 (1975).  This \n\"may be established by policies or practices that are neutral \non their face and in intent but that nonetheless discriminate \nin effect against a particular group.\"  International Bhd. of \nTeamsters, 431 U.S. at 349.  In the second step, the burden \nshifts to the employer to \"demonstrate that the challenged \npractice is job related for the position in question and consis-\ntent with business necessity.\"  42 U.S.C. s 2000e-\n2(k)(1)(A)(i);  see Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 431 \n(1971).12  Finally, if the defendant demonstrates business \nnecessity, plaintiffs must be given an opportunity to demon-\nstrate that an alternative employment practice could meet the \nemployer's legitimate needs without a similar discriminatory \neffect.  See 42 U.S.C. s 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(ii);  Albemarle Pa-\nper Co., 422 U.S. at 425.\n\n                                B\n\n     Plaintiffs receive a 15% lower salary than their white, non-\nPanamanian counterparts and are not given the equity pack-\nage and vacation benefits.  This is sufficient to establish a \nprima facie case of wage discrimination.  There is no dispute \nthat race and national origin are protected classes.  Nor is \nthere any dispute that the work plaintiffs perform is substan-\ntially the same as that of the white non-Panamanians:  the \nPCC awards the wage differential and benefits as an incre-\nment above an employee's base salary regardless of the kind \nof work he or she performs or the level of skill it requires.\n\n     In addition to this comparison of their personal situations, \nplaintiffs offered statistics showing a wide disparity between \nthe percentages of black versus white U.S. citizens who \nreceive the higher salary and benefits, as well as between the \n\n__________\n     12  For purposes of the disparate impact test, Title VII defines \nthe term \"demonstrates\" as \"meets the burdens of production and \npersuasion.\"  42 U.S.C. s 2000e(m).

Many of the disparities are far in \nexcess of 1.96 standard deviations.14  Under our case law, this \nlevel of statistical significance is sufficient to establish a prima \nfacie case of both disparate treatment and disparate impact.  \nSee Berger, 843 F.2d at 1412;  Palmer v.

The \ndisparity with respect to national origin was 4.6 standard deviations \nfor the tropical differential and 2.46 for the vacation benefits.  See \nHirn Decl. pp 3, 4 (R. 9).\n\n                                C\n\n     As the plaintiffs have established a prima facie case of \ndisparate treatment, under the second step of McDonnell \nDouglas \"[t]he burden then must shift to the employer to \narticulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\" for the \nchallenged employment practice.  McDonnell Douglas, 411 \nU.S. at 802.  Similarly, under the disparate impact provisions \nof Title VII, proof of a prima facie case shifts the burden to \nthe employer to demonstrate that the challenged practice is \njob related and consistent with business necessity.  42 U.S.C. \ns 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i);  Griggs, 401 U.S. at 431.\n\n     The district court, however, pretermitted any further anal-\nysis under either theory after the prima facie stage.  Al-\nthough it agreed that Title VII protects against discrimina-\ntion \"because of [an] individual's race ... or national origin,\" \n977 F. Supp. at 442 (quoting 42 U.S.C. s 2000e-2(a)(1)), the \ncourt cut off the analysis of plaintiffs' disparate treatment \nclaim on the ground that the discrimination here was \" 'be-\ncause of' citizenship, not because of membership in a Title VII \nprotected class.\"  Id.  Stating that \"[t]he Supreme Court \nheld in Espinoza v. Farah, that ... [Title VII] does not offer \nprotection from discrimination on the basis of citizenship,\" the \ndistrict court held that plaintiffs had failed as a matter of law \nto make out a prima facie case of disparate treatment.  Id. at \n441 (citation omitted).\n\n     The district court's reliance on Espinoza was misplaced for \ntwo reasons.  First, although the Supreme Court did hold \nthat citizenship is not a facially-unlawful criterion for employ-\nment decisions, see 414 U.S. 86, 91 (1973), it also recognized \nthat \"an employer might use a citizenship test as a pretext to \ndisguise what is in fact national-origin discrimination.\"  Id. at \n92.  Title VII, the Court said, \"prohibits discrimination on the \nbasis of citizenship whenever it has the purpose or effect of \ndiscriminating on the basis of national origin.\"  Id. That \nprinciple was of no assistance to the Espinoza plaintiffs, who \nalleged discrimination based on Mexican national origin:  not-\nwithstanding the employer's citizens-only policy, there was no \nevidence of discriminatory purpose or effect since more than \n\n\f96% of its employees were of Mexican descent.  Id. at 93.  \nHere, however, plaintiffs' claims of pretext and disparate \neffect are not as easily brushed aside:  the overwhelming \nmajority of those who receive the pay differential are whites \nof non-Panamanian origin.  See supra p. 15.  If, as Espinoza \nproclaimed, Title VII truly does \"prohibit[ ] discrimination on \nthe basis of citizenship whenever it has the purpose or effect \nof discriminating on the basis of national origin,\" then courts \nmust afford plaintiffs an opportunity to prove such a purpose \nor effect.  See also 29 C.F.R. s 1606.5(a) (EEOC regulation) \n(\"[W]here citizenship requirements have the purpose or effect \nof discriminating against an individual on the basis of national \norigin, they are prohibited by [T]itle VII.\").\n\n     Second, \"citizenship\" is simply not the basis upon which the \nPCC differentiates, or even contends that it differentiates, \namong its employees.  All of the plaintiffs are, in fact, Ameri-\ncan citizens.  Nor is the issue whether it was lawful for the \nPCC to prefer citizens over noncitizens in 1976, the year the \ntropical differential policy was announced, or to prefer them \nin 1989, the year the equity package was cut off.  As dis-\ncussed above, the limitations period has run on those kinds of \nclaims.  Instead, the plaintiffs' core contention is that the \nPCC is engaged in a current, continuing violation of Title VII, \nbecause today and every day it pays them less than it pays \nothers who are similarly situated.  The question in this case, \nthen, is whether the PCC is unlawfully discriminating against \nAmerican citizens today, by maintaining a system of prefer-\nences based on whether they were citizens at an earlier time.  \nAs the PCC itself describes its policies, it differentiates \namong its employees based on the timing of their citizenship.  \nFor that reason, Espinoza, a case in which the employer \nsimply preferred citizens over noncitizens, is not controlling.\n\n     The district court cut off the analysis of plaintiffs' disparate \nimpact claim on a different ground.  Although it acknowl-\nedged that the PCC's benefit-eligibility requirements may \nhave had a disparate impact, it dismissed the claim because \nplaintiffs had presented \"no evidence that the Defendant \nacted with any unlawful discriminatory purpose.\"  977 \nF. Supp. at 442.  That ruling was flawed both in law and in \n\n\ffact.  First, \"[u]nlike disparate treatment cases, disparate \nimpact cases do not require a showing of discriminatory \nanimus on the part of the employer.\"  McKenzie, 684 F.2d at \n70 n.6 (citing Connecticut v. Teal, 457 U.S. 440 (1982));  see \nInternational Bhd. of Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 336 n.15.  Sec-\nond, plaintiffs did present evidence of discriminatory intent.  \n\"[T]his court has squarely held that, even absent specific \nanecdotal evidence of discrimination, statistical proof alone \nmay establish a prima facie case of intentional discrimina-\ntion.\"  Berger, 843 F.2d at 1413.  And, as noted above, we \nhave deemed the 1.96 standard deviations shown here to be \nsufficient to do so.  Id. at 1412-13.  Accordingly, the district \ncourt's conclusion that plaintiffs failed to make out a prima \nfacie case of disparate impact, like its conclusion with respect \nto plaintiffs' disparate treatment case, was in error.\n\n                                D\n\n     The PCC offers us an alternative rationale, different from \nthose of the district court, for concluding that plaintiffs have \nfailed to establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment or \nimpact.  To prove disparate treatment, the PCC notes, plain-\ntiffs must show they were treated differently from other \nsimilarly-situated members of a nonprotected class.  But, the \nPCC contends, \"appellants were only similarly situated with \nother locally-hired employees who became citizens after\" the \ndates specified by the PCC as required qualifications for \nbenefits.  PCC Br. at 32 (emphasis omitted).  Because plain-\ntiffs \"fail[ ] to identify a single employee of any race or \nnational origin who was naturalized after July 3, 1976, but \nwho nevertheless receives the tropical differential,\" they as-\nsertedly cannot show disparate treatment.  Id.  Similarly, \nbecause plaintiffs' statistical evidence fails to compare the \ntreatment of protected and nonprotected employees equally \n\"qualified\" under the PCC's rules, the PCC contends plain-\ntiffs' disparate impact case is also fatally flawed.  At bottom, \ndefendant contends plaintiffs err in \"lumping all PCC employ-\nees of a particular national origin together, regardless wheth-\ner they were naturalized after the date the benefits were cut \noff.\"  Id. at 38.\n\n\f     The PCC is correct, of course, that plaintiffs must demon-\nstrate they are treated less well than other employees who \nare similarly situated.  But that does not require us to \nassume that the very factor plaintiffs attack as pretext is a \nbona fide attribute of being situated similarly.  To adopt such \na position would be to assume the very thing the McDonnell \nDouglas test is aimed at ferreting out--namely, whether that \nfacially-neutral factor is indeed a pretext.  To require plain-\ntiffs to compare their situation to that of others disadvan-\ntaged by the same challenged factor would effectively elimi-\nnate their opportunity to show pretext, because it would bar \nthem from ever passing the prima facie stage.  See Segar v. \nSmith, 738 F.2d 1249, 1276 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (noting that some \nemployer qualifications \"may well serve as a veil of seeming \nlegitimacy behind which illegal discrimination is operating\" \nand that \"[i]f so, measurement of the relation of such a factor \nto an observed disparity would simply amount to a measure of \nthe amount of discrimination operating through the applica-\ntion of the factor\").\n\n     Similarly, requiring a plaintiff to \"correct\" his statistics to \naccount for timing of citizenship would render the disparate \nimpact provisions of Title VII nugatory.  The gravamen of \nplaintiffs' disparate impact claim is that timing of citizenship \nis the factor that causes the disparate impact, whether it was \nintended to have that effect or not.  If we were to require \nthat the very factor that causes disparate impact be included \nin the comparison for purposes of establishing a prima facie \ncase, we would effectively define disparate impact analysis out \nof existence.  See Berger, 843 F.2d at 1417-18 (rejecting \ndefendant's contention that racial disparity in union admis-\nsions could be explained by minorities' inability to satisfy \nunion-established training requirement, since that require-\nment was precisely \"the discriminatory practice at issue\").\n\n     It is true that in order to eliminate the most common \nnondiscriminatory explanation for a disparity--lack of qualifi-\ncations--a plaintiff's prima facie case must take into account \nthe \"minimum objective qualifications\" for the position at \nissue.  Segar, 738 F.2d at 1274 (citing, inter alia, Valentino, \n674 F.2d at 71);  Valentino, 674 F.2d at 61 (citing Hazelwood \n\n\fSch. Dist. v. United States, 433 U.S. 299, 308 n.13 (1977)).  \nBut that does not mean a plaintiff must take account of every \nqualification recited by the employer, nor even of every \n\"objective\" qualification.  Rather, what the case law means by \n\"minimum objective qualifications\" are those objective qualifi-\ncations that can be shown to be truly required to do the job at \nissue.\n\n     The seminal disparate impact case, Griggs v. Duke Power \nCo., makes this conclusion inescapable.  There, plaintiffs con-\ntended that Duke Power's announced criteria for both hiring \nand transfer to better-paid jobs--a high school diploma \nand/or passing grade on a standardized intelligence test--had \na disparate impact on black applicants.  There was no dispute \nthat these criteria were objective and \"applied fairly to whites \nand Negroes alike.\"  401 U.S. at 429.  Nonetheless, the Court \nheld that plaintiffs had made out a violation of Title VII \nbecause defendant had not shown that the criteria \"bear a \ndemonstrable relationship to successful performance of the \njobs for which [they were] used.\"  Id. at 431.  \"If an employ-\nment practice which operates to exclude Negroes cannot be \nshown to be related to job performance,\" Chief Justice Burg-\ner held, \"the practice is prohibited.\"  Id.\n\n     Similarly, in Dothard v. Rawlinson, the plaintiff sought \nemployment as a prison guard, but was rejected because she \ncould not meet the employer's minimum height (5'2\") and \nweight (120 lbs.) qualifications.  433 U.S. 321, 323-24 (1977).  \nShe offered statistical evidence that these objective qualifica-\ntions had a disproportionate impact on women, and the Court \nagreed that her statistics established a prima facie case--\nnotwithstanding that the qualification standards were \"facial-\nly neutral.\"  Id. at 329-31.  It then went on to consider \ndefendant's claim that it had rebutted the prima facie case by \nshowing that the height and weight requirements were \"job \nrelated\" since they correlated \"with the requisite amount of \nstrength thought essential to good job performance.\"  Id. at \n331.  The Court rejected the rebuttal because defendant \n\"produced no evidence\" of such a correlation.  Id. at 331-32.\n\n\f     This Circuit's cases follow the same pattern.  In Goodrich \nv. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, 712 F.2d \n1488 (D.C. Cir. 1983), a female employee contended that her \nemployer paid men more than women for the same work.  \nThe employer countered that the men were paid better \nbecause they were in positions for which plaintiff could not \nqualify--not because she was a woman, but because she was \nnot a union member.  Id. at 1492.  The district court granted \nsummary judgment on that basis, finding the employer's \nnondiscriminatory criterion of union membership fatal to \nplaintiff's case.  Id. at 1490.  This court, however, reversed \nand remanded for trial.  The purpose of a trial, we held, was \nto test whether union membership really provided the \"spe-\ncial expertise\" defendant claimed was necessary to succeed in \nthe higher-paid positions.  Id. at 1493-94.\n\n     In Valentino v. United States Postal Service, we did find a \nplaintiff's prima facie case insufficient because she \"failed to \ntake into account minimum objective qualifications,\" namely \n\"specialized education and experience\" required for the \"high \nlevel professional, administrative, and managerial positions\" \nat issue.  674 F.2d at 66-67.  At the same time, however, we \n\"confine[d] our analysis to [such] high level\" positions, id. at \n68 n.16, noting that it would not apply for \"jobs involving \nskills 'many persons possess or can fairly readily acquire,' \" \nid. at 67 (quoting Hazelwood, 433 U.S. at 308 n.13).  To the \nsame effect is our decision in Metrocare v. Washington \nMetropolitan Area Transit Authority.  See 679 F.2d at 930 \n(\"For some jobs, no particular qualifications are needed, and \nan appropriate comparison group would be the local popula-\ntion in general.  But when the posts require managerial \ncapability or other expertise, the comparison group must be \nthe set of available minority persons with that expertise or \nqualification.\") (citations omitted);  see also Hazelwood, 433 \nU.S. at 308 n.13 (noting that when \"job skill\" at issue is \n\"special qualification\" like teaching experience, the compari-\nson must be \"to the smaller group of individuals who possess \nthe necessary qualifications,\" but that when the skill is one \nlike driving a truck \"that many persons possess,\" comparison \nto general population is appropriate).\n\n\f     With this understanding of the meaning of the term, it is \nplain that the timing of an employee's citizenship is not a \n\"minimum objective qualification\" for the wage and benefit \npreferences at issue here.  There is no sense at all in which \nsuch citizenship can fairly be said to be demonstrably \"related \nto job performance.\"  Having become a citizen by 1976 does \nnot assist an employee in digging a ditch, guiding a barge, or \nprogramming a computer.  The plaintiffs in this case already \nare employees of the PCC, and most have worked there since \nbefore 1976, all the while doing work that otherwise would \n\"qualify\" for the preference.  The PCC has never suggested, \nlet alone shown, that plaintiffs' job performance has suffered \nin any way because of their citizenship status.\n\n     Indeed, the PCC's own policies make clear that the timing \nof citizenship is not a work-related qualification.  As noted in \nPart I, from 1984 to 1989 four plaintiffs received the PCC's \nequity adjustment package;  yet there is no claim that their \nwork was less acceptable than that of employees with earlier \ncitizenship who also received the package during the same \ntime period.  See Berger, 843 F.2d at 1421 (holding that five-\nmonth period in which employer did not insist on employment \nqualification precluded claim that it was a \"minimum objective \nqualification,\" and noting that employer could not rely on a \nqualification unless it \"satisfies the bedrock requirements of \njob-relatedness\");  cf. Griggs, 401 U.S. at 431-32 (noting that \nhiring and transfer requirements that were inapplicable to \nsome employees who nevertheless \"perform satisfactorily ... \nsuggests the possibility that the requirements may not be \nneeded\").  Even more telling, the PCC continues to make the \nequity package and vacation benefits available to those who \nhave never become American citizens, as long as they were \nrecruited from outside of Panama.  See 22 U.S.C. s 3646;  \nPCC Cross-Motion (R. 13), Exs. 20, 54, 67.  Accordingly, it \ncannot be said that citizenship, let alone 1976 citizenship, is \ntruly a job-related qualification for the PCC's pay prefer-\nences--unless by \"qualification\" we simply mean any qualifi-\ncation an employer announces.\n\n     Because the PCC has not shown that its eligibility criteria \nconstitute \"minimum objective qualifications\" for the work \n\n\fplaintiffs do, the plaintiffs' statistical comparisons are suffi-\ncient to make out a prima facie case of both disparate \ntreatment and disparate impact.  Accordingly, summary \njudgment is inappropriate unless the PCC can satisfy its \nburden to show a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason and \nbusiness necessity for the requirement.  And even then, \nplaintiffs must be given an opportunity to show that the \nreason is pretextual or that there is an alternative that can \nsatisfy the employer's need in a nondiscriminatory fashion.  \nBecause of its erroneous view of the law, the district court cut \nshort the analysis without undertaking any of these inquiries.\n\n                                IV\n\n     The PCC argues that even if plaintiffs have established a \nprima facie case, it has satisfied the second step of McDon-\nnell Douglas by showing \"a legitimate, non-discriminatory \nreason for denying them benefits.\"  PCC Br. at 33.  Similar-\nly, the Commission contends that it has met the second \nrequirement of the disparate impact test by showing that its \n\"criteria for awarding benefits were job-related and consis-\ntent with business necessity.\"  Id. at 36.  But what exactly is \nthe defendant's explanation for its eligibility requirements?\n\n     In places in its brief, the PCC appears to suggest that the \n\"timing of citizenship\" is the legitimate, nondiscriminatory \nexplanation for the disparities of which plaintiffs complain.  \nThe district court indicated that was its understanding as \nwell.  See 977 F. Supp. at 441-42.  But in fact, the PCC does \nnot rest its policy on a simple preference for long-time \ncitizens over more recent ones.  Nor is it surprising that a \ncorporation wholly-owned by the United States government \nwould eschew such a naked preference for one category of \nAmerican citizens over another.  In any event, for the rea-\nsons discussed above, the timing of citizenship cannot satisfy \nthe \"job-related\" requirement of Title VII.\n\n     Rather than explain its pay disparity as the product of a \npreference for the timing of its employees' citizenship, the \nPCC ultimately rests instead on a policy of \"grandfathering.\"  \nPCC Br. at 34.  At one time, the Commission explains, any \n\n\fcitizen-employee was eligible for the tropical differential.  \nHad that policy continued, plaintiffs would have become eligi-\nble when they, too, became citizens.  But in 1976, the PCC \nstopped offering the differential to Panamanian hires.  See \nsupra note 2.  It decided, however, to grandfather those who \nwere receiving the differential as of that date--thus effective-\nly retaining the benefit for employees who were citizens as of \n1976, but excluding those who would become citizens at a \nlater time.  Id.\n\n     But re-labeling the policy as \"grandfathering\" cannot alone \nsatisfy the PCC's burden of producing evidence of a nondis-\ncriminatory reason for the practice, or of establishing a \nbusiness necessity for it.  Just as the employer in Dothard \ncould not simply announce a height and weight policy, but \nrather had to show how those criteria related to the strength \nrequired for the job of prison guard, so must the PCC explain \nhow grandfathering is related to the work of the Canal \nCommission.\n\n     The PCC has attempted to do that.  It \"preserved the \nbenefits for those locally-hired U.S. citizens who were already \nreceiving the benefits,\" the PCC explains, \"in order to retain \nthose employees.\"  PCC Br. at 36.  Grandfathering, it con-\ntends, was the \"retention incentive\" needed to ensure that its \nemployees stayed on the job.  Id.15\n\n     The following sections consider the serious attacks plain-\ntiffs have leveled at the credibility of this retention rationale.  \nThose attacks are aimed at showing that the PCC's proffered \nrationale is in fact a pretext for paying benefits to its white \nnon-Panamanian employees while denying them to black Pan-\n\n__________\n     15  The PCC also implies a second rationale for grandfathering, \nnamely, \"to preserve the morale of innocent employees who are \nvictims of lowering wage scales.\"  PCC Br. at 34 (quoting Canton v. \nCanal Zone Gov't, 522 F. Supp. 1, 12 n.17 (D.C. Z. 1981) (discussing \nconcept in a different context)).  But the PCC does not stress this \npoint, no doubt because the response is obvious:  Why, a reasonable \njuror might ask, is the morale of those who receive the benefit more \nimportant than the morale of the plaintiff employees?  And why are \nthe plaintiffs any less \"innocent\"?\n\n\famanians, the great majority of whom did not become U.S. \ncitizens until after 1976.  See supra note 6.  They also are \naimed at showing defendant's policy unjustified by business \nnecessity or achievable by plaintiffs' suggested nondiscrimina-\ntory alternative of broadening eligibility to all U.S. citizen \nemployees.  See Pls. Br. at 45.\n\n                                A\n\n     The PCC's retention rationale is certainly not facially ille-\ngitimate.  That, however, is not the question.  The question is \nwhether the plaintiffs have cast such doubt on its credibility \nthat a reasonable juror could regard it as pretext and infer a \ndiscriminatory motive, or that a reasonable factfinder could \nconclude it was inconsistent with business necessity or achiev-\nable in a nondiscriminatory way.  That conclusion seems \nunavoidable here.  As plaintiffs point out, the PCC has to \ndate offered no evidence that its pay and benefit enhance-\nments were ever necessary for retention in the first place, \nand certainly no evidence that their maintenance is necessary \nfor continued retention of those who receive them.  It is not \nas if \"home\" for most benefit recipients is the continental \nUnited States, and that they are thus more likely than the \nplaintiffs to leave Panama if they do not receive the pay \ndifferential or the free vacation flights.  To the contrary, \nplaintiffs have proffered evidence that \"home\" is just as likely \nto be the Panamanian isthmus for the vast majority of those \nreceiving the differential as it is for the plaintiffs.16  Like \nplaintiffs, many of those who receive the benefits are second-\nand third-generation Canal employees.  Pls. Br. at 37.\n\n     Moreover, just as the PCC has offered no support for its \ncontention that its policies are required to ensure retention of \nthose who receive the preferential benefits, it has offered no \n\n__________\n     16  The PCC's own survey showed that 429 of the 464 employees \nwho were receiving the tropical differential in 1995 were already \nresiding in Panama at the time they were recruited to work for the \nCommission.  Only 35 were recruited from off-isthmus.  Pls. Stmt. \nof Material Facts (R. 9) p 27 (citing Regist Decl. p 14 & Attach. A);  \nPls. Br. at 38.\n\n\fevidence to suggest that retention of employees like the \nplaintiffs is any less important to its business.  Nor has it \noffered evidence that the benefits are any less necessary for \nretention of the plaintiffs.  Indeed, one of the plaintiffs has \nalready quit the PCC and moved to Florida.  Id. at 39.\n\n                                B\n\n     The biggest problem with the retention rationale, however, \nis that even if accepted, it can only explain half of the PCC's \neligibility criteria.  Although the Commission stresses the \ncriterion of date-of-citizenship as consistent with a grandfa-\nthering rationale, the plaintiffs correctly point out that none \nof the three benefit programs is actually limited to employees \nwho were citizens as of a certain date.  Timing of citizenship \nis one way to qualify, but it is not the only way.  As the PCC \nconcedes, the tropical differential is also available to \"new \nhires\" from outside of Panama, regardless when they became \ncitizens.  PCC Br. at 5-6;  see 35 C.F.R. s 251.31(b)(1)(i).  \nAnd the equity package and travel benefits are available to \nnew hires from outside of Panama, even if they never become \nAmerican citizens.  See 22 U.S.C. s 3646;  PCC Cross-Motion \n(R. 13), Exs. 20, 54, 67.\n\n     Needless to say, PCC's new-hire criterion cannot be ex-\nplained by a retention rationale, since the new hires never \npreviously worked for the company.  For this criterion, the \nPCC must turn to a different \"legitimate, nondiscriminatory \nreason.\"  The new-hire criterion is justified, the Canal Com-\nmission contends, because it is needed for \"recruiting\" em-\nployees.  PCC Br. at 34.\n\n     Like retention, there is nothing inherently suspect about a \nrecruitment rationale.  But as the plaintiffs note, to date the \nPCC has not offered any evidence that the benefits contested \nhere are or were necessary for recruitment.  Where is the \nevidence, they ask, that the base salaries offered by the PCC \nare or were insufficient to recruit the necessary workforce?  \nWhere is the evidence that the PCC has even considered the \n\n\fquestion?  Indeed, plaintiffs point out that the only evidence \nin the record is to the contrary, i.e., that the PCC has (and \nhas had) no need for off-isthmus recruitment at all.  An \naffidavit from the PCC's own Personnel Director explains \nthat the reason the tropical differential was originally \ndropped in 1976 was that \"in general, there were sufficient \nnumbers of qualified applicants available locally that made it \nunnecessary to grant the differential to all U.S. citizens as a \nrecruitment and retention incentive.\"  Pls. Br. at 40 (quoting \nMercier Aff.);  see also Comptroller General, Report to the \nSubcommittee on Panama Canal 102 (1975) (noting that the \ntropical differential was not needed for across-the-board re-\ncruitment because \"[q]ualified applicants ... are available \nlocally for most skills\") (quoted in Pls. Br. at 37).\n\n                                C\n\n     The equity adjustment package presents a particularly \ngood example of the weakness, and shifting nature, of the \nrationales defendant offers in support of its benefit policies.  \nAs part of the Panama Canal Treaty negotiations, the United \nStates agreed that in 1984 it would close commissaries that \npreviously had offered goods to PCC citizen-employees at \ndiscounted prices.  PCC Br. at 6-7;  Pls. Br. at 14.  To offset \nthe increase in employee cost-of-living attributable to closure, \nCongress authorized the PCC to pay a cost-of-living allow-\nance.  Congress authorized payment to \"each officer and \nemployee ... who is a citizen of the United States and was \nemployed by the Panama Canal Company ... on September \n30, 1979,\" regardless of place of recruitment, as well as to \nanyone recruited \"outside the Republic of Panama\" after that \ndate, regardless of citizenship.  22 U.S.C. s 3646 (emphasis \nadded).  Under that provision, between 1984 and 1989 the \nPCC paid the equity adjustment package to five of the \nplaintiffs.\n\n     On December 29, 1989, as one his final acts before depart-\ning Panama, the last American administrator of the Canal \nterminated the equity adjustment package for any employee \noriginally hired from within Panama who was not a citizen \n\n\fbefore October 1, 1984.  As a result, four plaintiffs lost their \nbenefits.  As they quite rightly note, the PCC has not shown \nhow the need to provide retention incentives explains the \ntermination of their benefits.  Indeed, cancellation is argu-\nably inconsistent with that grandfathering-based rationale.\n\n     Unable to rely on a grandfathering/retention rationale, the \nPCC turns instead to another:  the equity adjustment pack-\nage, the PCC contends, \"was meant only to compensate \nemployees who had lost [commissary] benefits.\"  PCC Br. at \n8 (emphasis added).  Because plaintiffs were not citizens \nduring the period the commissaries were open, they \"never \nreceived any [commissary] benefits.\"  Id.  Hence, the PCC \ncontends, plaintiffs should never have been given the equity \nadjustment package in the first place, and the Commission \nwas justified in terminating the undeserved \"windfall\" they \nhad been receiving for four years.  Id.\n\n     But this compensation explanation appears inconsistent \nwith the new-hires eligibility criterion discussed above.  If \nthe equity allowance were meant only for those who previous-\nly had the benefit of shopping at the commissaries, why does \nthe PCC make it available to those whom the Commission \nnewly hires from outside of Panama?  Those new hires, by \ndefinition, never received the pre-1984 commissary benefits.  \nAnd why does the PCC extend this offer to new hires only if \nthey do not come from Panama?\n\n     To respond, the PCC retreats to a variant of the recruit-\nment rationale:  \"Although these [newly-hired] employees \nnever received any [commissary] benefits, they receive the \nequity package as compensation for the loss of access to \ngoods and services they received before coming to Panama.\"  \nId. at 8.  In other words, and swallowing its previous words, \nthe PCC contends that the equity adjustment package was \nreally not \"meant only to compensate employees who had \nlost\" commissary benefits, id. at 8;  it was also meant to \ncompensate newly-hired employees who had lost the benefit \nof lower-priced goods in their home countries.  The plaintiffs \nare not eligible on this theory either, the PCC insists, because \nthey have always \"had to pay Panamanian prices, for Pana-\n\n\fmanian goods, from a Panamanian wage.\"  Id. (quoting \nAnderson, 977 F. Supp. at 441 n.2).\n\n     The plaintiffs cast substantial doubt on the credibility of \nthis new compensation/recruitment explanation as well.  \nWhere is the evidence, they ask, that the new hires did pay \nlower prices at home?  Where is the evidence that the PCC \never conducted the kind of cost comparison that would justify \nsuch a policy?  To date, the PCC has offered no evidence on \neither score.  This is hardly surprising since at bottom the \nPCC's across-the-board policy--in which every new non-\nPanamanian hire is eligible but no Panamanian hire ever is--\nappears to rest on the unlikely proposition that Panama has \n(and has long had) the highest cost of living in the world.\n\n     Finally, plaintiffs point to another flaw in the PCC's prof-\nfered rationale.  Notwithstanding its references to a \"new \nhires\" criterion, the PCC is actually rather expansive in its \ndefinition of the word \"new.\"  It not only makes the equity \nadjustment package available to those newly-hired from off-\nisthmus, it also makes it available to anyone, citizen or not, \nhired from outside of Panama after September 30, 1979.  See \n22 U.S.C. s 3646;  PCC Cross-Motion (R. 13), Exs. 20, 54.  \nOn the PCC's rationale, how can it justify providing the \npackage to these not-new, not-citizen hires?  Like the plain-\ntiffs, they never received the original commissary benefits \n(because they were not citizens during the commissary peri-\nod), making the grandfathering/retention rationale inapplica-\nble.  But also like the plaintiffs, these hires were not enjoying \nthe benefit of lower-cost goods in their home countries when \nthe commissaries closed in 1984.  Just like the plaintiffs, they \nwere working in Panama, \"pay[ing] Panamanian prices, for \nPanamanian goods, from a Panamanian wage\" from 1979 to \n1984.  Hence, the compensation/recruitment explanation is \nalso unavailable.  A reasonable factfinder could therefore \nconclude that only one remaining line divides these employees \nfrom the plaintiffs:  they are not of Panamanian national \norigin.  That, however, is precisely the line the law forbids \nthe PCC to draw.\n\n\f                                V\n\n     The preceding analysis persuades us that the district court \nerred in granting summary judgment and dismissing plain-\ntiffs' Title VII complaint.  With respect to the claim of \ndisparate impact, we have noted that the court erred in ruling \nthat proof of discriminatory intent was required.  According-\nly, because Part III establishes that plaintiffs' statistical \nevidence is sufficient for a prima facie case, and Part IV \nestablishes that on the present record a reasonable factfinder \ncould find defendant's pay policies unjustified by business \nnecessity (or rebutted by plaintiffs' as-yet unchallenged alter-\nnative of broadening eligibility to all U.S. citizen employees), \nreversal of summary judgment on the disparate impact claim \nis required.\n\n     For plaintiffs' disparate treatment charge to reach the jury, \nthey must show that a reasonable juror could find intentional \ndiscrimination.  Aka, 156 F.3d at 1289-90.  In deciding \nwhether intentional discrimination can be inferred, the court \nconsiders \"the combination of (1) the plaintiff's prima facie \ncase;  (2) any evidence the plaintiff presents to attack the \nemployer's proffered explanation for its actions;  and (3) any \nfurther evidence of discrimination that may be available to \nthe plaintiff.\"  Id. at 1289.\n\n     Part III demonstrates that when properly evaluated, the \nplaintiffs' prima facie case of disparate treatment is strong.  \nNot only have plaintiffs shown they were treated differently \nfrom similarly-situated, white non-Panamanians, but they \nhave shown the statistical disparities to be large--large \nenough alone to permit an inference of discriminatory intent.  \nSimilarly, Part IV demonstrates that plaintiffs' attack on the \nPCC's proffered explanations for that treatment is also \nstrong, providing a reasonable basis for viewing them as \npretexts.  As we recognized in Aka v. Washington Hospital \nCenter, such a discrediting of an employer's explanations \n\"may, together with the elements of the prima facie case, \nsuffice to show intentional discrimination.\"  156 F.3d at 1293 \n(quoting St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 511 \n(1993)).  In this case, they plainly do suffice.  Hence, we need \n\n\fnot even consider plaintiffs' proffer of further evidence that \nthe PCC's eligibility criteria represent \"nothing more than a \nthinly veiled continuation of the 'gold' and 'silver' system that \nsegregated native-born white U.S. citizen employees from \nblack employees by pay and every other aspect of Canal \nlife\"--a contention plaintiffs will have the opportunity to \nprove at trial.  Pls. Br. at 9;  see McKenzie, 684 F.2d at 72 \n(\"Evidence of past practices may illuminate present statistics, \nor present patterns of behavior.\").  Because on the current \nrecord it is impossible to conclude that no reasonable juror \ncould find intentional discrimination, the grant of summary \njudgment on the disparate treatment claim must also be \nreversed.\n\n     Of course, plaintiffs' attack on defendant's rationales for its \nwage and benefit policies may in the end prove mistaken.  So \nfar, however, plaintiffs' contentions stand largely unrebutted \nbecause the district court did not require the Canal Commis-\nsion to offer a rebuttal in order to keep plaintiffs from a trial.  \nOn remand the Commission will have the opportunity, and \nthe obligation, to do so.\n\n                                           Reversed and remanded.\n\n                                                                               ",

The court rejected plaintiffs' disparate treatment claim, concluding they were denied benefits because of their \"citizenship, not because of membership in a Title VII protected class.\"  Anderson v. Zubieta, 977 F.Supp. 439, 441-42 (D.D.C.1997).  The court denied the disparate impact claim on the ground that, although disparate impact \"may be true as a matter of fact,\" there was \"no evidence that the Defendant acted with any unlawful discriminatory purpose.\"  Id. at 442.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an initial matter, we must decide whether plaintiffs timely filed their claims with the PCC's Office of Equal Opportunity.  Regulations issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) require federal employees to bring Title VII complaints to the attention of an Equal Employment Opportunity counselor within 45 calendar days of the alleged discriminatory event.  See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1614.105(a)(1).  A plaintiff's administrative complaint is untimely unless it is brought within the 45-day limitations period, or unless the plaintiff establishes a basis for equitable tolling.  See id. &#167; 1614.107(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After investigating plaintiffs' complaints, the PCC rejected them as untimely.  The Canal Commission had amended the benefit policies in question in 1976, 1979, and 1989.  The plaintiffs, all of whom became citizens between 1977 and 1994, received notice that they were not entitled to the benefits on various dates ranging from July 13, 1977 to July 7, 1994.  See PCC Stmt. of Material Facts (R. 16).  None brought a complaint within 45 days of either the amendments or the notice; the first complaint was not brought until June 2, 1995.  On that basis, the PCC concluded plaintiffs' administrative complaints were filed too late.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs respond that their complaints allege continuing violations of Title VII, actionable upon receipt of each paycheck.  We agree.  As a unanimous Supreme Court said in Bazemore v. Friday, \"[e]ach week's paycheck that delivers less to a black than to a similarly situated white is a wrong actionable under Title VII, regardless of the fact that this pattern was begun prior\" to the limitations period. 478 U.S. 385, 395, 106 S.Ct. 3000, 92 L.Ed.2d 315 (1986) (Brennan, J., concurring, joined by all other Members of the Court).  The Courts of Appeals have repeatedly reached the same conclusion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Canal Commission bases its contrary position on a line of Supreme Court cases beginning with United Air Lines v. Evans, 431 U.S. 553, 97 S.Ct. 1885, 52 L.Ed.2d 571 (1977).  In Evans, defendant had discriminatorily dismissed the plaintiff in 1968, pursuant to a policy barring married female flight attendants.  When it rehired plaintiff in 1972 after changing the policy, it did not give her any seniority credit for her earlier service.  Suing in 1973, plaintiff conceded that a claim for her 1968 dismissal was untimely, but contended that the seniority system impermissibly gave present effect to that past act of discrimination.  The Court held the challenge to defendant's neutral seniority system time barred notwithstanding that present effect.  Id. at 558.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second case in the Evans line, Delaware State College v. Ricks, 449 U.S. 250, 101 S.Ct. 498, 66 L.Ed.2d 431 (1980), involved a professor's claim of unlawful termination by a university.  The Court held that the limitations period was triggered at the moment the university allegedly denied plaintiff tenure for a discriminatory reason, rather than a year later when he ultimately lost his job.  In the third case, Lorance v. AT&amp;T Technologies, Inc., 490 U.S. 900, 903, 109 S.Ct. 2261, 104 L.Ed.2d 961 (1989), the Court held that when a seniority system was \"not alleged to be discriminatory on its face or as presently applied,\" a complaint contending it was originally adopted for discriminatory reasons (outside the limitations period) was time barred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Evans-Ricks-Lorance line of cases does not support the Canal Commission's contention that plaintiffs' claims are time barred.  To the contrary, the Lorance Court's explanation of the difference between that line and Bazemore makes it clear that the opposite is true.  As Lorance explained, Bazemore was a case in which plaintiffs contended not just that the pay system was originally adopted for discriminatory reasons, but that it continued to discriminate unlawfully each time it was applied.  Lorance, 490 U.S. at 912 n. 5. \"There is no doubt,\" Justice Scalia said, that a system \"that treats similarly situated employees differently ... can be challenged at any time.\"  Id. at 912.  By contrast, in Lorance, \"[p]etitioners [did] not allege that the seniority system treat[ed] similarly situated employees differently or that it ha[d] been operated in an intentionally discriminatory manner.  Rather, they claim[ed] that its differential impact on the sexes [was] unlawful because the system 'ha[d] its genesis in [sex] discrimination.' \"  Id. at 905.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, Lorance explained that in Evans the plaintiff did not contend that the present seniority system was discriminatory, but rather \"asserted a claim that [was] wholly dependent on discriminatory conduct occurring well outside the period of limitations\"--that is, her dismissal in 1968.  Lorance, 409 U.S. at 907-08; see Evans, 431 U.S. at 560 (\"[R]espondent does not attack the bona fides of United's seniority system, and ... makes no charge that the system is intentionally designed to discriminate....\"). Likewise in Ricks, the Lorance Court said, plaintiff \"did not claim that 'the manner in which his employment was terminated differed discriminatorily from the manner in which the College terminated other professors who had been denied tenure.' \"  Rather, the only alleged discrimination occurred earlier, when plaintiff had been demoted into the ranks of the untenured.  See Lorance, 490 U.S. at 906 (quoting Ricks, 449 U.S. at 258).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs here fall on the Bazemore rather than Evans side of the line drawn in Lorance.  They do not seek relief for the PCC's initial announcement of its discriminatory policies, but rather for their continued application.  Unlike the petitioners in Lorance, the plaintiffs in this case allege that the PCC's policy currently \"treats similarly situated employees differently.\"  Id. at 905.  Accordingly, under Lorance they may challenge those policies \"at any time.\"  Id. at 912.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant also seeks support in a series of our cases holding that, to establish a continuing violation, a plaintiff must show \"a series of related acts, one or more of which falls within the limitations period, or the maintenance of a discriminatory system both before and during the [statutory] period.\"  McKenzie v. Sawyer, 684 F.2d 62, 72 (D.C.Cir.1982) (quoting Valentino v. United States Postal Serv., 674 F.2d 56, 65 (D.C.Cir.1982)); see Palmer v. Kelly, 17 F.3d 1490, 1496 (D.C.Cir.1994) (citing Berger v. Iron Workers Reinforced Rodmen Local 201, 843 F.2d 1395, 1422 (D.C.Cir.1988)).  Defendant's quotation of McKenzie is accurate, but the line of cases it represents goes to an analytically different question than the one we have just discussed.  Thus far, we have been considering the \"first question in the analysis of a continuing violations claim,\" namely, \"whether an actual violation of Title VII occurred during the statutory period.\"  Palmer, 17 F.3d at 1496.  As noted above, plaintiffs have adequately alleged such a \"present violation.\"  See id.  (quoting Evans, 431 U.S. at 558).  As explained below, that claim survives summary judgment.  If plaintiffs' claim of a present violation is ultimately proven, it will justify their request to be made whole for those paychecks received during the 45-day window and for all paychecks issued thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like most plaintiffs, however, the plaintiffs here want more than that.  They also want to reach back and obtain compensation for the lower paychecks they received prior to the 45-day limitations period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  It is to this \"next question\" that our cases refer when they require that a present violation be either \"part of a series of related discriminatory acts or ... caused by a discriminatory system in effect both before and during the limitations period.\"  Id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs plainly satisfy this test as well.  Indeed, they allege that their current lower paychecks and benefits are both part of a series of such discriminatory payments and caused by the continued maintenance of a broadly discriminatory pay and benefits system.  Plaintiffs do not merely challenge \"separate and distinct\" events, see Stoller v. Marsh, 682 F.2d 971, 975 (D.C.Cir.1982), but rather allege that the \"current violations\" they have identified \"were taken pursuant to the same employment policy as the actions sought to be challenged outside the normally applicable limitations period.\"  Berger, 843 F.2d at 1422 (citing Evans, 431 U.S. at 558).  \"Where, as here, discrimination is not limited to isolated incidents, but pervades a series or pattern of events which continue to within  days of the filing of the charge ... , the filing is timely ... regardless of when the first discriminatory incident occurred.\"  Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, 567 F.2d 429, 473 (D.C.Cir.1976).  We therefore reject the contention that plaintiffs' claims are time barred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the merits of plaintiffs' claims.  We review the district court's grant of defendant's motion for summary judgment de novo, and can sustain the court's decision only if \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); see FDIC v. Bender, 127 F.3d 58, 63 (D.C.Cir.1997).  We must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and ask \"whether any reasonable jury could find in its favor.\"  Harbor Ins.

We then focus on the first element of that framework, the prima facie case, and consider the reasons given by the district court, and an alternative rationale offered by the Canal Commission, for finding that plaintiffs failed to establish such a case.  We conclude that both the district court and the Commission were wrong, and that plaintiffs have met the requirements for showing a prima facie violation of Title VII.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Plaintiffs allege wage discrimination under theories of both disparate treatment and disparate impact.

United States, 431 U.S. 324, 335 n. 15, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977).  \"Proof of discriminatory motive is critical\" for such claims.  Id. Disparate impact claims, on the other hand, \"involve employment practices that are facially neutral in their treatment of different groups but that in fact fall more harshly on one group than another and cannot be justified by business necessity.\"  Id. at 336 n. 15.  \"Proof of discriminatory motive ... is not required under a disparate-impact theory.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The familiar three-step evidentiary framework for proving a disparate treatment case was set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).  The plaintiffs must first establish a prima facie case, the elements of which vary according to the circumstances.  Id. at 802 &amp; n. 13.  For a prima facie case of wage discrimination, plaintiffs must show \"membership in a protected class ... , and that [they] were performing work substantially equal to that of white employees who were compensated at higher rates than they were.\"  Coward v. ADT Sec. Sys., Inc., 140 F.3d 271, 273 (D.C.Cir.1998) (internal quotations and alterations omitted); see id. at 275.  Once plaintiffs establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment, under the second step of McDonnell Douglas \"[t]he burden then must shift to the employer to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\" for the challenged employment practice.  McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802.  If the defendant carries this burden, the third step requires that plaintiffs be \"afforded a fair opportunity to show that [the] stated reason ... was in fact pretext\" for discrimination.  Id. at 804.  For a disparate treatment case finally to reach the jury, the court must find in light of all the evidence that \"the plaintiff has met his burden of showing that a reasonable jury could conclude that he had suffered [intentional] discrimination.\"  Aka v.

As with disparate treatment, the plaintiff must first make out a prima facie case.  Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 425, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 45 L.Ed.2d 280 (1975).  This \"may be established by policies or practices that are neutral on their face and in intent but that nonetheless discriminate in effect against a particular group.\"  International Bhd. of Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 349.  In the second step, the burden shifts to the employer to \"demonstrate that the challenged practice is job related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i); see Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 431, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Finally, if the defendant demonstrates business necessity, plaintiffs must be given an opportunity to demonstrate that an alternative employment practice could meet the employer's legitimate needs without a similar discriminatory effect.

This is sufficient to establish a prima facie case of wage discrimination.  There is no dispute that race and national origin are protected classes.  Nor is there any dispute that the work plaintiffs perform is substantially the same as that of the white non-Panamanians: the PCC awards the wage differential and benefits as an increment above an employee's base salary regardless of the kind of work he or she performs or the level of skill it requires.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to this comparison of their personal situations, plaintiffs offered statistics showing a wide disparity between the percentages of black versus white U.S. citizens who receive the higher salary and benefits, as well as between the percentages of U.S. citizens of American versus Panamanian or Hispanic national origin who receive them.  The statistics offered by plaintiffs were compiled by the PCC's own Office of Equal Opportunity from a survey it conducted of PCC employees, all of whom were U.S. citizens.

McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802.  Similarly, under the disparate impact provisions of Title VII, proof of a prima facie case shifts the burden to the employer to demonstrate that the challenged practice is job related and consistent with business necessity. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i); Griggs, 401 U.S. at 431.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, however, pretermitted any further analysis under either theory after the prima facie stage.  Although it agreed that Title VII protects against discrimination \"because of [an] individual's race ... or national origin,\" 977 F.Supp. at 442 (quoting 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-2(a)(1)), the court cut off the analysis of plaintiffs' disparate treatment claim on the ground that the discrimination here was \" 'because of' citizenship, not because of membership in a Title VII protected class.\"  Id. Stating that \"[t]he Supreme Court held in Espinoza v. Farah, that ... [Title VII] does not offer protection from discrimination on the basis of citizenship,\" the district court held that plaintiffs had failed as a matter of law to make out a prima facie case of disparate treatment.  Id. at 441 (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's reliance on Espinoza was misplaced for two reasons.  First, although the Supreme Court did hold that citizenship is not a facially-unlawful criterion for employment decisions, see 414 U.S. 86, 91, 94 S.Ct. 334, 38 L.Ed.2d 287 (1973), it also recognized that \"an employer might use a citizenship test as a pretext to disguise what is in fact national-origin discrimination.\"  Id. at 92.  Title VII, the Court said, \"prohibits discrimination on the basis of citizenship whenever it has the purpose or effect of discriminating on the basis of national origin.\"  Id. That principle was of no assistance to the Espinoza plaintiffs, who alleged discrimination based on Mexican national origin: notwithstanding the employer's citizens-only policy, there was no evidence of discriminatory purpose or effect since more than 96% of its employees were of Mexican descent.  Id. at 93.  Here, however, plaintiffs' claims of pretext and disparate effect are not as easily brushed aside: the overwhelming majority of those who receive the pay differential are whites of non-Panamanian origin.  See supra p. 15.  If, as Espinoza proclaimed, Title VII truly does \"prohibit[ ] discrimination on the basis of citizenship whenever it has the purpose or effect of discriminating on the basis of national origin,\" then courts must afford plaintiffs an opportunity to prove such a purpose or effect.  See also 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1606.5(a) (EEOC regulation) (\"[W]here citizenship requirements have the purpose or effect of discriminating against an individual on the basis of national origin, they are prohibited by [T]itle VII.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, \"citizenship\" is simply not the basis upon which the PCC differentiates, or even contends that it differentiates, among its employees.  All of the plaintiffs are, in fact, American citizens.  Nor is the issue whether it was lawful for the PCC to prefer citizens over noncitizens in 1976, the year the tropical differential policy was announced, or to prefer them in 1989, the year the equity package was cut off.  As discussed above, the limitations period has run on those kinds of claims.  Instead, the plaintiffs' core contention is that the PCC is engaged in a current, continuing violation of Title VII, because today and every day it pays them less than it pays others who are similarly situated.  The question in this case, then, is whether the PCC is unlawfully discriminating against American citizens today, by maintaining a system of preferences based on whether they were citizens at an earlier time.  As the PCC itself describes its policies, it differentiates among its employees based on the timing of their citizenship.  For that reason, Espinoza, a case in which the employer simply preferred citizens over noncitizens, is not controlling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court cut off the analysis of plaintiffs' disparate impact claim on a different ground.  Although it acknowledged that the PCC's benefit-eligibility requirements may have had a disparate impact, it dismissed the claim because plaintiffs had presented \"no evidence that the Defendant acted with any unlawful discriminatory purpose.\" 977F.Supp. at 442.  That ruling was flawed both in law and in fact.  First, \"[u]nlike disparate treatment cases, disparate impact cases do not require a showing of discriminatory animus on the part of the employer.\"  McKenzie, 684 F.2d at 70 n. 6 (citing Connecticut v. Teal, 457 U.S. 440, 102 S.Ct. 2525, 73 L.Ed.2d 130 (1982)); see International Bhd. of Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 336 n. 15.  Second, plaintiffs did present evidence of discriminatory intent.  \"[T]his court has squarely held that, even absent specific anecdotal evidence of discrimination, statistical proof alone may establish a prima facie case of intentional discrimination.\"  Berger, 843 F.2d at 1413.  And, as noted above, we have deemed the 1.96 standard deviations shown here to be sufficient to do so.  Id. at 1412-13.  Accordingly, the district court's conclusion that plaintiffs failed to make out a prima facie case of disparate impact, like its conclusion with respect to plaintiffs' disparate treatment case, was in error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PCC offers us an alternative rationale, different from those of the district court, for concluding that plaintiffs have failed to establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment or impact.  To prove disparate treatment, the PCC notes, plaintiffs must show they were treated differently from other similarly-situated members of a nonprotected class.  But, the PCC contends, \"appellants were only similarly situated with other locally-hired employees who became citizens after\" the dates specified by the PCC as required qualifications for benefits.  PCC Br. at 32 (emphasis omitted).  Because plaintiffs \"fail[ ] to identify a single employee of any race or national origin who was naturalized after July 3, 1976, but who nevertheless receives the tropical differential,\" they assertedly cannot show disparate treatment.  Id. Similarly, because plaintiffs' statistical evidence fails to compare the treatment of protected and nonprotected employees equally \"qualified\" under the PCC's rules, the PCC contends plaintiffs' disparate impact case is also fatally flawed.  At bottom, defendant contends plaintiffs err in \"lumping all PCC employees of a particular national origin together, regardless whether they were naturalized after the date the benefits were cut off.\"  Id. at 38.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PCC is correct, of course, that plaintiffs must demonstrate they are treated less well than other employees who are similarly situated.  But that does not require us to assume that the very factor plaintiffs attack as pretext is a bona fide attribute of being situated similarly.  To adopt such a position would be to assume the very thing the McDonnell Douglas test is aimed at ferreting out--namely, whether that facially-neutral factor is indeed a pretext.  To require plaintiffs to compare their situation to that of others disadvantaged by the same challenged factor would effectively eliminate their opportunity to show pretext, because it would bar them from ever passing the prima facie stage.  See Segar v. Smith, 738 F.2d 1249, 1276 (D.C.Cir.1984) (noting that some employer qualifications \"may well serve as a veil of seeming legitimacy behind which illegal discrimination is operating\" and that \"[i]f so, measurement of the relation of such a factor to an observed disparity would simply amount to a measure of the amount of discrimination operating through the application of the factor\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, requiring a plaintiff to \"correct\" his statistics to account for timing of citizenship would render the disparate impact provisions of Title VII nugatory.  The gravamen of plaintiffs' disparate impact claim is that timing of citizenship is the factor that causes the disparate impact, whether it was intended to have that effect or not.  If we were to require that the very factor that causes disparate impact be included in the comparison for purposes of establishing a prima facie case, we would effectively define disparate impact analysis out of existence.  See Berger, 843 F.2d at 1417-18 (rejecting defendant's contention that racial disparity in union admissions could be explained by minorities' inability to satisfy union-established training requirement, since that requirement was precisely \"the discriminatory practice at issue\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that in order to eliminate the most common nondiscriminatory explanation for a disparity--lack of qualifications--a plaintiff's prima facie case must take into account the \"minimum objective qualifications\" for the position at issue.  Segar, 738 F.2d at 1274 (citing, inter alia, Valentino, 674 F.2d at 71); Valentino, 674 F.2d at 61 (citing Hazelwood Sch. Dist. v. United States, 433 U.S. 299, 308 n. 13, 97 S.Ct. 2736, 53 L.Ed.2d 768 (1977)).  But that does not mean a plaintiff must take account of every qualification recited by the employer, nor even of every \"objective\" qualification.  Rather, what the case law means by \"minimum objective qualifications\" are those objective qualifications that can be shown to be truly required to do the job at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The seminal disparate impact case, Griggs v. Duke Power Co., makes this conclusion inescapable.  There, plaintiffs contended that Duke Power's announced criteria for both hiring and transfer to better-paid jobs--a high school diploma and/or passing grade on a standardized intelligence test--had a disparate impact on black applicants.  There was no dispute that these criteria were objective and \"applied fairly to whites and Negroes alike.\" 401 U.S. at 429.  Nonetheless, the Court held that plaintiffs had made out a violation of Title VII because defendant had not shown that the criteria \"bear a demonstrable relationship to successful performance of the jobs for which [they were] used.\"  Id. at 431.  \"If an employment practice which operates to exclude Negroes cannot be shown to be related to job performance,\" Chief Justice Burger held, \"the practice is prohibited.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, in Dothard v.

She offered statistical evidence that these objective qualifications had a disproportionate impact on women, and the Court agreed that her statistics established a prima facie case--notwithstanding that the qualification standards were \"facially neutral.\"  Id. at 329-31.  It then went on to consider defendant's claim that it had rebutted the prima facie case by showing that the height and weight requirements were \"job related\" since they correlated \"with the requisite amount of strength thought essential to good job performance.\"  Id. at 331.  The Court rejected the rebuttal because defendant \"produced no evidence\" of such a correlation.

The employer countered that the men were paid better because they were in positions for which plaintiff could not qualify--not because she was a woman, but because she was not a union member.  Id. at 1492.  The district court granted summary judgment on that basis, finding the employer's nondiscriminatory criterion of union membership fatal to plaintiff's case.  Id. at 1490.  This court, however, reversed and remanded for trial.  The purpose of a trial, we held, was to test whether union membership really provided the \"special expertise\" defendant claimed was necessary to succeed in the higher-paid positions.

At the same time, however, we \"confine[d] our analysis to [such] high level\" positions, id. at 68 n. 16, noting that it would not apply for \"jobs involving skills 'many persons possess or can fairly readily acquire,' \" id. at 67 (quoting Hazelwood, 433 U.S. at 308 n. 13).  To the same effect is our decision in Metrocare v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.  See 679 F.2d at 930 (\"For some jobs, no particular qualifications are needed, and an appropriate comparison group would be the local population in general.  But when the posts require managerial capability or other expertise, the comparison group must be the set of available minority persons with that expertise or qualification.\")  (citations omitted); see also Hazelwood, 433 U.S. at 308 n. 13 (noting that when \"job skill\" at issue is \"special qualification\" like teaching experience, the comparison must be \"to the smaller group of individuals who possess the necessary qualifications,\" but that when the skill is one like driving a truck \"that many persons possess,\" comparison to general population is appropriate).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With this understanding of the meaning of the term, it is plain that the timing of an employee's citizenship is not a \"minimum objective qualification\" for the wage and benefit preferences at issue here.  There is no sense at all in which such citizenship can fairly be said to be demonstrably \"related to job performance.\"  Having become a citizen by 1976 does not assist an employee in digging a ditch, guiding a barge, or programming a computer.  The plaintiffs in this case already are employees of the PCC, and most have worked there since before 1976, all the while doing work that otherwise would \"qualify\" for the preference.  The PCC has never suggested, let alone shown, that plaintiffs' job performance has suffered in any way because of their citizenship status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the PCC's own policies make clear that the timing of citizenship is not a work-related qualification.  As noted in Part I, from 1984 to 1989 four plaintiffs received the PCC's equity adjustment package; yet there is no claim that their work was less acceptable than that of employees with earlier citizenship who also received the package during the same time period.  See Berger, 843 F.2d at 1421 (holding that fivemonth period in which employer did not insist on employment qualification precluded claim that it was a \"minimum objective qualification,\" and noting that employer could not rely on a qualification unless it \"satisfies the bedrock requirements of job-relatedness\"); cf.  Griggs, 401 U.S. at 431-32 (noting that hiring and transfer requirements that were inapplicable to some employees who nevertheless \"perform satisfactorily ... suggests the possibility that the requirements may not be needed\").  Even more telling, the PCC continues to make the equity package and vacation benefits available to those who have never become American citizens, as long as they were recruited from outside of Panama.  See 22 U.S.C. &#167; 3646; PCC Cross-Motion (R. 13), Exs. 20, 54, 67.  Accordingly, it cannot be said that citizenship, let alone 1976 citizenship, is truly a job-related qualification for the PCC's pay preferences--unless by \"qualification\" we simply mean any qualification an employer announces.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the PCC has not shown that its eligibility criteria constitute \"minimum objective qualifications\" for the work plaintiffs do, the plaintiffs' statistical comparisons are sufficient to make out a prima facie case of both disparate treatment and disparate impact.  Accordingly, summary judgment is inappropriate unless the PCC can satisfy its burden to show a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason and business necessity for the requirement.  And even then, plaintiffs must be given an opportunity to show that the reason is pretextual or that there is an alternative that can satisfy the employer's need in a nondiscriminatory fashion.  Because of its erroneous view of the law, the district court cut short the analysis without undertaking any of these inquiries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PCC argues that even if plaintiffs have established a prima facie case, it has satisfied the second step of McDonnell Douglas by showing \"a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for denying them benefits.\"  PCC Br. at 33.  Similarly, the Commission contends that it has met the second requirement of the disparate impact test by showing that its \"criteria for awarding benefits were job-related and consistent with business necessity.\"  Id. at 36.  But what exactly is the defendant's explanation for its eligibility requirements?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In places in its brief, the PCC appears to suggest that the \"timing of citizenship\" is the legitimate, nondiscriminatory explanation for the disparities of which plaintiffs complain.  The district court indicated that was its understanding as well.  See 977 F.Supp. at 441-42.  But in fact, the PCC does not rest its policy on a simple preference for long-time citizens over more recent ones.  Nor is it surprising that a corporation wholly-owned by the United States government would eschew such a naked preference for one category of American citizens over another.  In any event, for the reasons discussed above, the timing of citizenship cannot satisfy the \"job-related\" requirement of Title VII.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than explain its pay disparity as the product of a preference for the timing of its employees' citizenship, the PCC ultimately rests instead on a policy of \"grandfathering.\"  PCC Br. at 34.  At one time, the Commission explains, any citizen-employee was eligible for the tropical differential.  Had that policy continued, plaintiffs would have become eligible when they, too, became citizens.  But in 1976, the PCC stopped offering the differential to Panamanian hires.  See supra note 2. It decided, however, to grandfather those who were receiving the differential as of that date--thus effectively retaining the benefit for employees who were citizens as of 1976, but excluding those who would become citizens at a later time.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But re-labeling the policy as \"grandfathering\" cannot alone satisfy the PCC's burden of producing evidence of a nondiscriminatory reason for the practice, or of establishing a business necessity for it.  Just as the employer in Dothard could not simply announce a height and weight policy, but rather had to show how those criteria related to the strength required for the job of prison guard, so must the PCC explain how grandfathering is related to the work of the Canal Commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PCC has attempted to do that.  It \"preserved the benefits for those locally-hired U.S. citizens who were already receiving the benefits,\" the PCC explains, \"in order to retain those employees.\"  PCC Br. at 36.  Grandfathering, it contends, was the \"retention incentive\" needed to ensure that its employees stayed on the job.  Id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following sections consider the serious attacks plaintiffs have leveled at the credibility of this retention rationale.  Those attacks are aimed at showing that the PCC's proffered rationale is in fact a pretext for paying benefits to its white non-Panamanian employees while denying them to black Panamanians, the great majority of whom did not become U.S. citizens until after 1976.  See supra note 6. They also are aimed at showing defendant's policy unjustified by business necessity or achievable by plaintiffs' suggested nondiscriminatory alternative of broadening eligibility to all U.S. citizen employees.  See Pls. Br. at 45.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The PCC's retention rationale is certainly not facially illegitimate.  That, however, is not the question.  The question is whether the plaintiffs have cast such doubt on its credibility that a reasonable juror could regard it as pretext and infer a discriminatory motive, or that a reasonable factfinder could conclude it was inconsistent with business necessity or achievable in a nondiscriminatory way.  That conclusion seems unavoidable here.  As plaintiffs point out, the PCC has to date offered no evidence that its pay and benefit enhancements were ever necessary for retention in the first place, and certainly no evidence that their maintenance is necessary for continued retention of those who receive them.  It is not as if \"home\" for most benefit recipients is the continental United States, and that they are thus more likely than the plaintiffs to leave Panama if they do not receive the pay differential or the free vacation flights.  To the contrary, plaintiffs have proffered evidence that \"home\" is just as likely to be the Panamanian isthmus for the vast majority of those receiving the differential as it is for the plaintiffs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  Like plaintiffs, many of those who receive the benefits are secondand third-generation Canal employees.  Pls. Br. at 37.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, just as the PCC has offered no support for its contention that its policies are required to ensure retention of those who receive the preferential benefits, it has offered no evidence to suggest that retention of employees like the plaintiffs is any less important to its business.  Nor has it offered evidence that the benefits are any less necessary for retention of the plaintiffs.  Indeed, one of the plaintiffs has already quit the PCC and moved to Florida.  Id. at 39.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The biggest problem with the retention rationale, however, is that even if accepted, it can only explain half of the PCC's eligibility criteria.  Although the Commission stresses the criterion of date-of-citizenship as consistent with a grandfathering rationale, the plaintiffs correctly point out that none of the three benefit programs is actually limited to employees who were citizens as of a certain date.  Timing of citizenship is one way to qualify, but it is not the only way.  As the PCC concedes, the tropical differential is also available to \"new hires\" from outside of Panama, regardless when they became citizens.  PCC Br. at 5-6; see 35 C.F.R. &#167; 251.31(b)(1)(i).  And the equity package and travel benefits are available to new hires from outside of Panama, even if they never become American citizens.  See 22 U.S.C. &#167; 3646; PCC Cross-Motion (R. 13), Exs. 20, 54, 67.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Needless to say, PCC's new-hire criterion cannot be explained by a retention rationale, since the new hires never previously worked for the company.  For this criterion, the PCC must turn to a different \"legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason.\"  The new-hire criterion is justified, the Canal Commission contends, because it is needed for \"recruiting\" employees.  PCC Br. at 34.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like retention, there is nothing inherently suspect about a recruitment rationale.  But as the plaintiffs note, to date the PCC has not offered any evidence that the benefits contested here are or were necessary for recruitment.  Where is the evidence, they ask, that the base salaries offered by the PCC are or were insufficient to recruit the necessary workforce?  Where is the evidence that the PCC has even considered the question?  Indeed, plaintiffs point out that the only evidence in the record is to the contrary, i.e., that the PCC has (and has had) no need for off-isthmus recruitment at all.  An affidavit from the PCC's own Personnel Director explains that the reason the tropical differential was originally dropped in 1976 was that \"in general, there were sufficient numbers of qualified applicants available locally that made it unnecessary to grant the differential to all U.S. citizens as a recruitment and retention incentive.\"  Pls. Br. at 40 (quoting Mercier Aff.); see also COMPTROLLER GENERAL, REPORT TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON PANAMA CANAL 102 (1975) (noting that the tropical differential was not needed for across-the-board recruitment because \"[q]ualified applicants ... are available locally for most skills\") (quoted in Pls. Br. at 37).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The equity adjustment package presents a particularly good example of the weakness, and shifting nature, of the rationales defendant offers in support of its benefit policies.  As part of the Panama Canal Treaty negotiations, the United States agreed that in 1984 it would close commissaries that previously had offered goods to PCC citizen-employees at discounted prices.  PCC Br. at 6-7; Pls. Br. at 14.  To offset the increase in employee cost-of-living attributable to closure, Congress authorized the PCC to pay a cost-of-living allowance.  Congress authorized payment to \"each officer and employee ... who is a citizen of the United States and was employed by the Panama Canal Company ... on September 30, 1979,\" regardless of place of recruitment, as well as to anyone recruited \"outside the Republic of Panama\" after that date, regardless of citizenship. 22 U.S.C. &#167; 3646 (emphasis added).  Under that provision, between 1984 and 1989 the PCC paid the equity adjustment package to five of the plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 29, 1989, as one his final acts before departing Panama, the last American administrator of the Canal terminated the equity adjustment package for any employee originally hired from within Panama who was not a citizen before October 1, 1984.  As a result, four plaintiffs lost their benefits.  As they quite rightly note, the PCC has not shown how the need to provide retention incentives explains the termination of their benefits.  Indeed, cancellation is arguably inconsistent with that grandfathering-based rationale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unable to rely on a grandfathering/retention rationale, the PCC turns instead to another: the equity adjustment package, the PCC contends, \"was meant only to compensate employees who had lost [commissary] benefits.\"  PCC Br. at 8 (emphasis added).  Because plaintiffs were not citizens during the period the commissaries were open, they \"never received any [commissary] benefits.\"  Id. Hence, the PCC contends, plaintiffs should never have been given the equity adjustment package in the first place, and the Commission was justified in terminating the undeserved \"windfall\" they had been receiving for four years.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But this compensation explanation appears inconsistent with the new-hires eligibility criterion discussed above.  If the equity allowance were meant only for those who previously had the benefit of shopping at the commissaries, why does the PCC make it available to those whom the Commission newly hires from outside of Panama?  Those new hires, by definition, never received the pre-1984 commissary benefits.  And why does the PCC extend this offer to new hires only if they do not come from Panama?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To respond, the PCC retreats to a variant of the recruitment rationale: \"Although these [newly-hired] employees never received any [commissary] benefits, they receive the equity package as compensation for the loss of access to goods and services they received before coming to Panama.\"  Id. at 8. In other words, and swallowing its previous words, the PCC contends that the equity adjustment package was really not \"meant only to compensate employees who had lost\" commissary benefits, id. at 8; it was also meant to compensate newly-hired employees who had lost the benefit of lower-priced goods in their home countries.  The plaintiffs are not eligible on this theory either, the PCC insists, because they have always \"had to pay Panamanian prices, for Panamanian goods, from a Panamanian wage.\"  Id. (quoting Anderson, 977 F.Supp. at 441 n. 2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs cast substantial doubt on the credibility of this new compensation/recruitment explanation as well.  Where is the evidence, they ask, that the new hires did pay lower prices at home?  Where is the evidence that the PCC ever conducted the kind of cost comparison that would justify such a policy?  To date, the PCC has offered no evidence on either score.  This is hardly surprising since at bottom the PCC's across-the-board policy--in which every new nonPanamanian hire is eligible but no Panamanian hire ever is--appears to rest on the unlikely proposition that Panama has (and has long had) the highest cost of living in the world.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, plaintiffs point to another flaw in the PCC's proffered rationale.  Notwithstanding its references to a \"new hires\" criterion, the PCC is actually rather expansive in its definition of the word \"new.\"  It not only makes the equity adjustment package available to those newly-hired from offisthmus, it also makes it available to anyone, citizen or not, hired from outside of Panama after September 30, 1979.  See 22 U.S.C. &#167; 3646; PCC Cross-Motion (R. 13), Exs. 20, 54.  On the PCC's rationale, how can it justify providing the package to these not-new, not-citizen hires?  Like the plaintiffs, they never received the original commissary benefits (because they were not citizens during the commissary period), making the grandfathering/retention rationale inapplicable.  But also like the plaintiffs, these hires were not enjoying the benefit of lower-cost goods in their home countries when the commissaries closed in 1984.  Just like the plaintiffs, they were working in Panama, \"pay[ing] Panamanian prices, for Panamanian goods, from a Panamanian wage\" from 1979 to 1984.  Hence, the compensation/recruitment explanation is also unavailable.  A reasonable factfinder could therefore conclude that only one remaining line divides these employees from the plaintiffs: they are not of Panamanian national origin.  That, however, is precisely the line the law forbids the PCC to draw.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The preceding analysis persuades us that the district court erred in granting summary judgment and dismissing plaintiffs' Title VII complaint.  With respect to the claim of disparate impact, we have noted that the court erred in ruling that proof of discriminatory intent was required.  Accordingly, because Part III establishes that plaintiffs' statistical evidence is sufficient for a prima facie case, and Part IV establishes that on the present record a reasonable factfinder could find defendant's pay policies unjustified by business necessity (or rebutted by plaintiffs' as-yet unchallenged alternative of broadening eligibility to all U.S. citizen employees), reversal of summary judgment on the disparate impact claim is required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For plaintiffs' disparate treatment charge to reach the jury, they must show that a reasonable juror could find intentional discrimination.  Aka, 156 F.3d at 1289-90.  In deciding whether intentional discrimination can be inferred, the court considers \"the combination of (1) the plaintiff's prima facie case; (2) any evidence the plaintiff presents to attack the employer's proffered explanation for its actions; and (3) any further evidence of discrimination that may be available to the plaintiff.\"  Id. at 1289.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Part III demonstrates that when properly evaluated, the plaintiffs' prima facie case of disparate treatment is strong.  Not only have plaintiffs shown they were treated differently from similarly-situated, white non-Panamanians, but they have shown the statistical disparities to be large--large enough alone to permit an inference of discriminatory intent.  Similarly, Part IV demonstrates that plaintiffs' attack on the PCC's proffered explanations for that treatment is also strong, providing a reasonable basis for viewing them as pretexts.  As we recognized in Aka v. Washington Hospital Center, such a discrediting of an employer's explanations \"may, together with the elements of the prima facie case, suffice to show intentional discrimination.\" 156 F.3d at 1293 (quoting St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 511, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993)).  In this case, they plainly do suffice.  Hence, we need not even consider plaintiffs' proffer of further evidence that the PCC's eligibility criteria represent \"nothing more than a thinly veiled continuation of the 'gold' and 'silver' system that segregated native-born white U.S. citizen employees from black employees by pay and every other aspect of Canal life\"--a contention plaintiffs will have the opportunity to prove at trial.

Under the PCC's regulations, only American citizens are eligible for the tropical differential. 35 C.F.R. &#167; 251.31(a).  Moreover, employees hired from within Panama (\"Panamanian hires\") are eligible only if they also come within a \"grandfather clause\" the PCC adopted in 1976--which requires that they were employed and receiving the differential no later than July 3, 1976.  See id. &#167; 251.31(c).  This effectively limits the eligibility of Panamanian hires to those who already were American citizens on that date.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  This requirement disqualifies all of the plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second benefit is known as the \"equity adjustment package,\" and consists of free rent and electricity in PCC housing, as well as certain travel and educational benefits.

See PCC Cross-Motion (Dist. Ct. Record Entry [hereinafter \"R.\"] 13), Ex. 37.  As part of the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977, the United States agreed to close those stores.  PCC citizen-employees, however, were permitted to shop in military commissaries for a limited period of time ending September 30, 1984.  Effective October 1, 1984, Congress authorized an allowance for any U.S. citizen (as of the time the benefits are received) who was employed on September 30, 1979, regardless of place of recruitment.  The allowance was also authorized for anyone recruited after September 30, 1979 from outside Panama, regardless of citizenship. 22 U.S.C. &#167; 3646.

Regulations issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) require federal employees to bring Title VII complaints to the attention of an Equal Employment Opportunity counselor within 45 calendar days of the alleged discriminatory event.  See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1614.105(a)(1).  A plaintiff's administrative complaint is untimely unless it is brought within the 45-day limitations period, or unless the plaintiff establishes a basis for equitable tolling.

The Canal Commission had amended the benefit policies in question in 1976, 1979, and 1989.  The plaintiffs, all of whom became citizens between 1977 and 1994, received notice that they were not entitled to the benefits on various dates ranging from July 13, 1977 to July 7, 1994.  See PCC Stmt. of Material Facts (R. 16).  None brought a complaint within 45 days of either the amendments or the notice; the first complaint was not brought until June 2, 1995.

In Evans, defendant had discriminatorily dismissed the plaintiff in 1968, pursuant to a policy barring married female flight attendants.  When it rehired plaintiff in 1972 after changing the policy, it did not give her any seniority credit for her earlier service.  Suing in 1973, plaintiff conceded that a claim for her 1968 dismissal was untimely, but contended that the seniority system impermissibly gave present effect to that past act of discrimination.  The Court held the challenge to defendant's neutral seniority system time barred notwithstanding that present effect.

To the contrary, the Lorance Court's explanation of the difference between that line and Bazemore makes it clear that the opposite is true.  As Lorance explained, Bazemore was a case in which plaintiffs contended not just that the pay system was originally adopted for discriminatory reasons, but that it continued to discriminate unlawfully each time it was applied.  Lorance, 490 U.S. at 912 n. 5. \"There is no doubt,\" Justice Scalia said, that a system \"that treats similarly situated employees differently ... can be challenged at any time.\"  Id. at 912.  By contrast, in Lorance, \"[p]etitioners [did] not allege that the seniority system treat[ed] similarly situated employees differently or that it ha[d] been operated in an intentionally discriminatory manner.  Rather, they claim[ed] that its differential impact on the sexes [was] unlawful because the system 'ha[d] its genesis in [sex] discrimination.' \"  Id. at 905.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, Lorance explained that in Evans the plaintiff did not contend that the present seniority system was discriminatory, but rather \"asserted a claim that [was] wholly dependent on discriminatory conduct occurring well outside the period of limitations\"--that is, her dismissal in 1968.  Lorance, 409 U.S. at 907-08; see Evans, 431 U.S. at 560 (\"[R]espondent does not attack the bona fides of United's seniority system, and ... makes no charge that the system is intentionally designed to discriminate....\"). Likewise in Ricks, the Lorance Court said, plaintiff \"did not claim that 'the manner in which his employment was terminated differed discriminatorily from the manner in which the College terminated other professors who had been denied tenure.' \"  Rather, the only alleged discrimination occurred earlier, when plaintiff had been demoted into the ranks of the untenured.

They do not seek relief for the PCC's initial announcement of its discriminatory policies, but rather for their continued application.  Unlike the petitioners in Lorance, the plaintiffs in this case allege that the PCC's policy currently \"treats similarly situated employees differently.\"  Id. at 905.

Defendant's quotation of McKenzie is accurate, but the line of cases it represents goes to an analytically different question than the one we have just discussed.  Thus far, we have been considering the \"first question in the analysis of a continuing violations claim,\" namely, \"whether an actual violation of Title VII occurred during the statutory period.\"  Palmer, 17 F.3d at 1496.  As noted above, plaintiffs have adequately alleged such a \"present violation.\"  See id.  (quoting Evans, 431 U.S. at 558).  As explained below, that claim survives summary judgment.  If plaintiffs' claim of a present violation is ultimately proven, it will justify their request to be made whole for those paychecks received during the 45-day window and for all paychecks issued thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like most plaintiffs, however, the plaintiffs here want more than that.  They also want to reach back and obtain compensation for the lower paychecks they received prior to the 45-day limitations period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  It is to this \"next question\" that our cases refer when they require that a present violation be either \"part of a series of related discriminatory acts or ... caused by a discriminatory system in effect both before and during the limitations period.\"  Id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs plainly satisfy this test as well.  Indeed, they allege that their current lower paychecks and benefits are both part of a series of such discriminatory payments and caused by the continued maintenance of a broadly discriminatory pay and benefits system.  Plaintiffs do not merely challenge \"separate and distinct\" events, see Stoller v.

Stating that \"[t]he Supreme Court held in Espinoza v. Farah, that ... [Title VII] does not offer protection from discrimination on the basis of citizenship,\" the district court held that plaintiffs had failed as a matter of law to make out a prima facie case of disparate treatment.

First, although the Supreme Court did hold that citizenship is not a facially-unlawful criterion for employment decisions, see <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108883\"><a href=\"/opinion/108883/espinoza-v-farah-mfg-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">414</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span>, 91, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108883\"><a href=\"/opinion/108883/espinoza-v-farah-mfg-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Title VII, the Court said, \"prohibits discrimination on the basis of citizenship whenever it has the purpose or effect of discriminating on the basis of national origin.\"  Id. That principle was of no assistance to the Espinoza plaintiffs, who alleged discrimination based on Mexican national origin: notwithstanding the employer's citizens-only policy, there was no evidence of discriminatory purpose or effect since more than 96% of its employees were of Mexican descent.  Id. at 93.  Here, however, plaintiffs' claims of pretext and disparate effect are not as easily brushed aside: the overwhelming majority of those who receive the pay differential are whites of non-Panamanian origin.  See supra p. 15.  If, as Espinoza proclaimed, Title VII truly does \"prohibit[ ] discrimination on the basis of citizenship whenever it has the purpose or effect of discriminating on the basis of national origin,\" then courts must afford plaintiffs an opportunity to prove such a purpose or effect.  See also 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1606.5(a) (EEOC regulation) (\"[W]here citizenship requirements have the purpose or effect of discriminating against an individual on the basis of national origin, they are prohibited by [T]itle VII.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, \"citizenship\" is simply not the basis upon which the PCC differentiates, or even contends that it differentiates, among its employees.  All of the plaintiffs are, in fact, American citizens.  Nor is the issue whether it was lawful for the PCC to prefer citizens over noncitizens in 1976, the year the tropical differential policy was announced, or to prefer them in 1989, the year the equity package was cut off.  As discussed above, the limitations period has run on those kinds of claims.  Instead, the plaintiffs' core contention is that the PCC is engaged in a current, continuing violation of Title VII, because today and every day it pays them less than it pays others who are similarly situated.  The question in this case, then, is whether the PCC is unlawfully discriminating against American citizens today, by maintaining a system of preferences based on whether they were citizens at an earlier time.  As the PCC itself describes its policies, it differentiates among its employees based on the timing of their citizenship.  For that reason, Espinoza, a case in which the employer simply preferred citizens over noncitizens, is not controlling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court cut off the analysis of plaintiffs' disparate impact claim on a different ground.  Although it acknowledged that the PCC's benefit-eligibility requirements may have had a disparate impact, it dismissed the claim because plaintiffs had presented \"no evidence that the Defendant acted with any unlawful discriminatory purpose.\" 977F.Supp. at 442.  That ruling was flawed both in law and in fact.  First, \"[u]nlike disparate treatment cases, disparate impact cases do not require a showing of discriminatory animus on the part of the employer.\"  McKenzie, 684 F.2d at 70 n. 6 (citing Connecticut v. Teal, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110751\"><a href=\"/opinion/110751/connecticut-v-teal/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110751\"><a href=\"/opinion/110751/connecticut-v-teal/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Second, plaintiffs did present evidence of discriminatory intent.  \"[T]his court has squarely held that, even absent specific anecdotal evidence of discrimination, statistical proof alone may establish a prima facie case of intentional discrimination.\"  Berger, 843 F.2d at 1413.  And, as noted above, we have deemed the 1.96 standard deviations shown here to be sufficient to do so.  Id. at 1412-13.  Accordingly, the district court's conclusion that plaintiffs failed to make out a prima facie case of disparate impact, like its conclusion with respect to plaintiffs' disparate treatment case, was in error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PCC offers us an alternative rationale, different from those of the district court, for concluding that plaintiffs have failed to establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment or impact.  To prove disparate treatment, the PCC notes, plaintiffs must show they were treated differently from other similarly-situated members of a nonprotected class.  But, the PCC contends, \"appellants were only similarly situated with other locally-hired employees who became citizens after\" the dates specified by the PCC as required qualifications for benefits.  PCC Br. at 32 (emphasis omitted).  Because plaintiffs \"fail[ ] to identify a single employee of any race or national origin who was naturalized after July 3, 1976, but who nevertheless receives the tropical differential,\" they assertedly cannot show disparate treatment.  Id. Similarly, because plaintiffs' statistical evidence fails to compare the treatment of protected and nonprotected employees equally \"qualified\" under the PCC's rules, the PCC contends plaintiffs' disparate impact case is also fatally flawed.  At bottom, defendant contends plaintiffs err in \"lumping all PCC employees of a particular national origin together, regardless whether they were naturalized after the date the benefits were cut off.\"  Id. at 38.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PCC is correct, of course, that plaintiffs must demonstrate they are treated less well than other employees who are similarly situated.  But that does not require us to assume that the very factor plaintiffs attack as pretext is a bona fide attribute of being situated similarly.  To adopt such a position would be to assume the very thing the McDonnell Douglas test is aimed at ferreting out--namely, whether that facially-neutral factor is indeed a pretext.  To require plaintiffs to compare their situation to that of others disadvantaged by the same challenged factor would effectively eliminate their opportunity to show pretext, because it would bar them from ever passing the prima facie stage.  See Segar v. Smith, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"438801\"><a href=\"/opinion/438801/henry-w-segar-v-william-french-smith-attorney-general-henry-w-segar/\"><span class=\"volume\">738</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1249</span></a></span>, 1276 (D.C.Cir.1984) (noting that some employer qualifications \"may well serve as a veil of seeming legitimacy behind which illegal discrimination is operating\" and that \"[i]f so, measurement of the relation of such a factor to an observed disparity would simply amount to a measure of the amount of discrimination operating through the application of the factor\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, requiring a plaintiff to \"correct\" his statistics to account for timing of citizenship would render the disparate impact provisions of Title VII nugatory.  The gravamen of plaintiffs' disparate impact claim is that timing of citizenship is the factor that causes the disparate impact, whether it was intended to have that effect or not.  If we were to require that the very factor that causes disparate impact be included in the comparison for purposes of establishing a prima facie case, we would effectively define disparate impact analysis out of existence.  See Berger, 843 F.2d at 1417-18 (rejecting defendant's contention that racial disparity in union admissions could be explained by minorities' inability to satisfy union-established training requirement, since that requirement was precisely \"the discriminatory practice at issue\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that in order to eliminate the most common nondiscriminatory explanation for a disparity--lack of qualifications--a plaintiff's prima facie case must take into account the \"minimum objective qualifications\" for the position at issue.  Segar, 738 F.2d at 1274 (citing, inter alia, Valentino, 674 F.2d at 71); Valentino, 674 F.2d at 61 (citing Hazelwood Sch. Dist. v.

But that does not mean a plaintiff must take account of every qualification recited by the employer, nor even of every \"objective\" qualification.

There was no dispute that these criteria were objective and \"applied fairly to whites and Negroes alike.\" 401 U.S. at 429.  Nonetheless, the Court held that plaintiffs had made out a violation of Title VII because defendant had not shown that the criteria \"bear a demonstrable relationship to successful performance of the jobs for which [they were] used.\"  Id. at 431.  \"If an employment practice which operates to exclude Negroes cannot be shown to be related to job performance,\" Chief Justice Burger held, \"the practice is prohibited.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, in Dothard v.

This court, however, reversed and remanded for trial.  The purpose of a trial, we held, was to test whether union membership really provided the \"special expertise\" defendant claimed was necessary to succeed in the higher-paid positions.

At the same time, however, we \"confine[d] our analysis to [such] high level\" positions, id. at 68 n. 16, noting that it would not apply for \"jobs involving skills 'many persons possess or can fairly readily acquire,' \" id. at 67 (quoting Hazelwood, 433 U.S. at 308 n. 13).  To the same effect is our decision in Metrocare v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.  See 679 F.2d at 930 (\"For some jobs, no particular qualifications are needed, and an appropriate comparison group would be the local population in general.  But when the posts require managerial capability or other expertise, the comparison group must be the set of available minority persons with that expertise or qualification.\")  (citations omitted); see also Hazelwood, 433 U.S. at 308 n. 13 (noting that when \"job skill\" at issue is \"special qualification\" like teaching experience, the comparison must be \"to the smaller group of individuals who possess the necessary qualifications,\" but that when the skill is one like driving a truck \"that many persons possess,\" comparison to general population is appropriate).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With this understanding of the meaning of the term, it is plain that the timing of an employee's citizenship is not a \"minimum objective qualification\" for the wage and benefit preferences at issue here.  There is no sense at all in which such citizenship can fairly be said to be demonstrably \"related to job performance.\"  Having become a citizen by 1976 does not assist an employee in digging a ditch, guiding a barge, or programming a computer.  The plaintiffs in this case already are employees of the PCC, and most have worked there since before 1976, all the while doing work that otherwise would \"qualify\" for the preference.  The PCC has never suggested, let alone shown, that plaintiffs' job performance has suffered in any way because of their citizenship status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the PCC's own policies make clear that the timing of citizenship is not a work-related qualification.  As noted in Part I, from 1984 to 1989 four plaintiffs received the PCC's equity adjustment package; yet there is no claim that their work was less acceptable than that of employees with earlier citizenship who also received the package during the same time period.  See Berger, 843 F.2d at 1421 (holding that fivemonth period in which employer did not insist on employment qualification precluded claim that it was a \"minimum objective qualification,\" and noting that employer could not rely on a qualification unless it \"satisfies the bedrock requirements of job-relatedness\"); cf.  Griggs, 401 U.S. at 431-32 (noting that hiring and transfer requirements that were inapplicable to some employees who nevertheless \"perform satisfactorily ... suggests the possibility that the requirements may not be needed\").  Even more telling, the PCC continues to make the equity package and vacation benefits available to those who have never become American citizens, as long as they were recruited from outside of Panama.  See 22 U.S.C. &#167; 3646; PCC Cross-Motion (R. 13), Exs. 20, 54, 67.  Accordingly, it cannot be said that citizenship, let alone 1976 citizenship, is truly a job-related qualification for the PCC's pay preferences--unless by \"qualification\" we simply mean any qualification an employer announces.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the PCC has not shown that its eligibility criteria constitute \"minimum objective qualifications\" for the work plaintiffs do, the plaintiffs' statistical comparisons are sufficient to make out a prima facie case of both disparate treatment and disparate impact.  Accordingly, summary judgment is inappropriate unless the PCC can satisfy its burden to show a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason and business necessity for the requirement.  And even then, plaintiffs must be given an opportunity to show that the reason is pretextual or that there is an alternative that can satisfy the employer's need in a nondiscriminatory fashion.  Because of its erroneous view of the law, the district court cut short the analysis without undertaking any of these inquiries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PCC argues that even if plaintiffs have established a prima facie case, it has satisfied the second step of McDonnell Douglas by showing \"a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for denying them benefits.\"  PCC Br. at 33.  Similarly, the Commission contends that it has met the second requirement of the disparate impact test by showing that its \"criteria for awarding benefits were job-related and consistent with business necessity.\"  Id. at 36.  But what exactly is the defendant's explanation for its eligibility requirements?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In places in its brief, the PCC appears to suggest that the \"timing of citizenship\" is the legitimate, nondiscriminatory explanation for the disparities of which plaintiffs complain.  The district court indicated that was its understanding as well.  See 977 F.Supp. at 441-42.  But in fact, the PCC does not rest its policy on a simple preference for long-time citizens over more recent ones.  Nor is it surprising that a corporation wholly-owned by the United States government would eschew such a naked preference for one category of American citizens over another.  In any event, for the reasons discussed above, the timing of citizenship cannot satisfy the \"job-related\" requirement of Title VII.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than explain its pay disparity as the product of a preference for the timing of its employees' citizenship, the PCC ultimately rests instead on a policy of \"grandfathering.\"  PCC Br. at 34.  At one time, the Commission explains, any citizen-employee was eligible for the tropical differential.  Had that policy continued, plaintiffs would have become eligible when they, too, became citizens.  But in 1976, the PCC stopped offering the differential to Panamanian hires.  See supra note 2. It decided, however, to grandfather those who were receiving the differential as of that date--thus effectively retaining the benefit for employees who were citizens as of 1976, but excluding those who would become citizens at a later time.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But re-labeling the policy as \"grandfathering\" cannot alone satisfy the PCC's burden of producing evidence of a nondiscriminatory reason for the practice, or of establishing a business necessity for it.  Just as the employer in Dothard could not simply announce a height and weight policy, but rather had to show how those criteria related to the strength required for the job of prison guard, so must the PCC explain how grandfathering is related to the work of the Canal Commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PCC has attempted to do that.  It \"preserved the benefits for those locally-hired U.S. citizens who were already receiving the benefits,\" the PCC explains, \"in order to retain those employees.\"  PCC Br. at 36.  Grandfathering, it contends, was the \"retention incentive\" needed to ensure that its employees stayed on the job.  Id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following sections consider the serious attacks plaintiffs have leveled at the credibility of this retention rationale.  Those attacks are aimed at showing that the PCC's proffered rationale is in fact a pretext for paying benefits to its white non-Panamanian employees while denying them to black Panamanians, the great majority of whom did not become U.S. citizens until after 1976.  See supra note 6. They also are aimed at showing defendant's policy unjustified by business necessity or achievable by plaintiffs' suggested nondiscriminatory alternative of broadening eligibility to all U.S. citizen employees.  See Pls. Br. at 45.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The PCC's retention rationale is certainly not facially illegitimate.  That, however, is not the question.  The question is whether the plaintiffs have cast such doubt on its credibility that a reasonable juror could regard it as pretext and infer a discriminatory motive, or that a reasonable factfinder could conclude it was inconsistent with business necessity or achievable in a nondiscriminatory way.  That conclusion seems unavoidable here.  As plaintiffs point out, the PCC has to date offered no evidence that its pay and benefit enhancements were ever necessary for retention in the first place, and certainly no evidence that their maintenance is necessary for continued retention of those who receive them.  It is not as if \"home\" for most benefit recipients is the continental United States, and that they are thus more likely than the plaintiffs to leave Panama if they do not receive the pay differential or the free vacation flights.  To the contrary, plaintiffs have proffered evidence that \"home\" is just as likely to be the Panamanian isthmus for the vast majority of those receiving the differential as it is for the plaintiffs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  Like plaintiffs, many of those who receive the benefits are secondand third-generation Canal employees.  Pls. Br. at 37.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, just as the PCC has offered no support for its contention that its policies are required to ensure retention of those who receive the preferential benefits, it has offered no evidence to suggest that retention of employees like the plaintiffs is any less important to its business.  Nor has it offered evidence that the benefits are any less necessary for retention of the plaintiffs.  Indeed, one of the plaintiffs has already quit the PCC and moved to Florida.  Id. at 39.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The biggest problem with the retention rationale, however, is that even if accepted, it can only explain half of the PCC's eligibility criteria.  Although the Commission stresses the criterion of date-of-citizenship as consistent with a grandfathering rationale, the plaintiffs correctly point out that none of the three benefit programs is actually limited to employees who were citizens as of a certain date.  Timing of citizenship is one way to qualify, but it is not the only way.  As the PCC concedes, the tropical differential is also available to \"new hires\" from outside of Panama, regardless when they became citizens.  PCC Br. at 5-6; see 35 C.F.R. &#167; 251.31(b)(1)(i).  And the equity package and travel benefits are available to new hires from outside of Panama, even if they never become American citizens.  See 22 U.S.C. &#167; 3646; PCC Cross-Motion (R. 13), Exs. 20, 54, 67.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Needless to say, PCC's new-hire criterion cannot be explained by a retention rationale, since the new hires never previously worked for the company.  For this criterion, the PCC must turn to a different \"legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason.\"  The new-hire criterion is justified, the Canal Commission contends, because it is needed for \"recruiting\" employees.  PCC Br. at 34.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like retention, there is nothing inherently suspect about a recruitment rationale.  But as the plaintiffs note, to date the PCC has not offered any evidence that the benefits contested here are or were necessary for recruitment.  Where is the evidence, they ask, that the base salaries offered by the PCC are or were insufficient to recruit the necessary workforce?  Where is the evidence that the PCC has even considered the question?  Indeed, plaintiffs point out that the only evidence in the record is to the contrary, i.e., that the PCC has (and has had) no need for off-isthmus recruitment at all.  An affidavit from the PCC's own Personnel Director explains that the reason the tropical differential was originally dropped in 1976 was that \"in general, there were sufficient numbers of qualified applicants available locally that made it unnecessary to grant the differential to all U.S. citizens as a recruitment and retention incentive.\"  Pls. Br. at 40 (quoting Mercier Aff.); see also COMPTROLLER GENERAL, REPORT TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON PANAMA CANAL 102 (1975) (noting that the tropical differential was not needed for across-the-board recruitment because \"[q]ualified applicants ... are available locally for most skills\") (quoted in Pls. Br. at 37).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The equity adjustment package presents a particularly good example of the weakness, and shifting nature, of the rationales defendant offers in support of its benefit policies.  As part of the Panama Canal Treaty negotiations, the United States agreed that in 1984 it would close commissaries that previously had offered goods to PCC citizen-employees at discounted prices.  PCC Br. at 6-7; Pls. Br. at 14.  To offset the increase in employee cost-of-living attributable to closure, Congress authorized the PCC to pay a cost-of-living allowance.  Congress authorized payment to \"each officer and employee ... who is a citizen of the United States and was employed by the Panama Canal Company ... on September 30, 1979,\" regardless of place of recruitment, as well as to anyone recruited \"outside the Republic of Panama\" after that date, regardless of citizenship. 22 U.S.C. &#167; 3646 (emphasis added).  Under that provision, between 1984 and 1989 the PCC paid the equity adjustment package to five of the plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 29, 1989, as one his final acts before departing Panama, the last American administrator of the Canal terminated the equity adjustment package for any employee originally hired from within Panama who was not a citizen before October 1, 1984.  As a result, four plaintiffs lost their benefits.  As they quite rightly note, the PCC has not shown how the need to provide retention incentives explains the termination of their benefits.  Indeed, cancellation is arguably inconsistent with that grandfathering-based rationale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unable to rely on a grandfathering/retention rationale, the PCC turns instead to another: the equity adjustment package, the PCC contends, \"was meant only to compensate employees who had lost [commissary] benefits.\"  PCC Br. at 8 (emphasis added).  Because plaintiffs were not citizens during the period the commissaries were open, they \"never received any [commissary] benefits.\"  Id. Hence, the PCC contends, plaintiffs should never have been given the equity adjustment package in the first place, and the Commission was justified in terminating the undeserved \"windfall\" they had been receiving for four years.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But this compensation explanation appears inconsistent with the new-hires eligibility criterion discussed above.  If the equity allowance were meant only for those who previously had the benefit of shopping at the commissaries, why does the PCC make it available to those whom the Commission newly hires from outside of Panama?  Those new hires, by definition, never received the pre-1984 commissary benefits.  And why does the PCC extend this offer to new hires only if they do not come from Panama?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To respond, the PCC retreats to a variant of the recruitment rationale: \"Although these [newly-hired] employees never received any [commissary] benefits, they receive the equity package as compensation for the loss of access to goods and services they received before coming to Panama.\"  Id. at 8. In other words, and swallowing its previous words, the PCC contends that the equity adjustment package was really not \"meant only to compensate employees who had lost\" commissary benefits, id. at 8; it was also meant to compensate newly-hired employees who had lost the benefit of lower-priced goods in their home countries.  The plaintiffs are not eligible on this theory either, the PCC insists, because they have always \"had to pay Panamanian prices, for Panamanian goods, from a Panamanian wage.\"  Id. (quoting Anderson, 977 F.Supp. at 441 n. 2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs cast substantial doubt on the credibility of this new compensation/recruitment explanation as well.  Where is the evidence, they ask, that the new hires did pay lower prices at home?  Where is the evidence that the PCC ever conducted the kind of cost comparison that would justify such a policy?  To date, the PCC has offered no evidence on either score.  This is hardly surprising since at bottom the PCC's across-the-board policy--in which every new nonPanamanian hire is eligible but no Panamanian hire ever is--appears to rest on the unlikely proposition that Panama has (and has long had) the highest cost of living in the world.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, plaintiffs point to another flaw in the PCC's proffered rationale.  Notwithstanding its references to a \"new hires\" criterion, the PCC is actually rather expansive in its definition of the word \"new.\"  It not only makes the equity adjustment package available to those newly-hired from offisthmus, it also makes it available to anyone, citizen or not, hired from outside of Panama after September 30, 1979.  See 22 U.S.C. &#167; 3646; PCC Cross-Motion (R. 13), Exs. 20, 54.  On the PCC's rationale, how can it justify providing the package to these not-new, not-citizen hires?  Like the plaintiffs, they never received the original commissary benefits (because they were not citizens during the commissary period), making the grandfathering/retention rationale inapplicable.  But also like the plaintiffs, these hires were not enjoying the benefit of lower-cost goods in their home countries when the commissaries closed in 1984.  Just like the plaintiffs, they were working in Panama, \"pay[ing] Panamanian prices, for Panamanian goods, from a Panamanian wage\" from 1979 to 1984.  Hence, the compensation/recruitment explanation is also unavailable.  A reasonable factfinder could therefore conclude that only one remaining line divides these employees from the plaintiffs: they are not of Panamanian national origin.  That, however, is precisely the line the law forbids the PCC to draw.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The preceding analysis persuades us that the district court erred in granting summary judgment and dismissing plaintiffs' Title VII complaint.  With respect to the claim of disparate impact, we have noted that the court erred in ruling that proof of discriminatory intent was required.  Accordingly, because Part III establishes that plaintiffs' statistical evidence is sufficient for a prima facie case, and Part IV establishes that on the present record a reasonable factfinder could find defendant's pay policies unjustified by business necessity (or rebutted by plaintiffs' as-yet unchallenged alternative of broadening eligibility to all U.S. citizen employees), reversal of summary judgment on the disparate impact claim is required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For plaintiffs' disparate treatment charge to reach the jury, they must show that a reasonable juror could find intentional discrimination.  Aka, 156 F.3d at 1289-90.  In deciding whether intentional discrimination can be inferred, the court considers \"the combination of (1) the plaintiff's prima facie case; (2) any evidence the plaintiff presents to attack the employer's proffered explanation for its actions; and (3) any further evidence of discrimination that may be available to the plaintiff.\"  Id. at 1289.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Part III demonstrates that when properly evaluated, the plaintiffs' prima facie case of disparate treatment is strong.  Not only have plaintiffs shown they were treated differently from similarly-situated, white non-Panamanians, but they have shown the statistical disparities to be large--large enough alone to permit an inference of discriminatory intent.  Similarly, Part IV demonstrates that plaintiffs' attack on the PCC's proffered explanations for that treatment is also strong, providing a reasonable basis for viewing them as pretexts.  As we recognized in Aka v. Washington Hospital Center, such a discrediting of an employer's explanations \"may, together with the elements of the prima facie case, suffice to show intentional discrimination.\" 156 F.3d at 1293 (quoting St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112901\"><a href=\"/opinion/112901/st-marys-honor-center-v-hicks/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span>, 511, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112901\"><a href=\"/opinion/112901/st-marys-honor-center-v-hicks/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">407</span></a></span> (1993)).  In this case, they plainly do suffice.  Hence, we need not even consider plaintiffs' proffer of further evidence that the PCC's eligibility criteria represent \"nothing more than a thinly veiled continuation of the 'gold' and 'silver' system that segregated native-born white U.S. citizen employees from black employees by pay and every other aspect of Canal life\"--a contention plaintiffs will have the opportunity to prove at trial.  Pls. Br. at 9; see McKenzie, 684 F.2d at 72 (\"Evidence of past practices may illuminate present statistics, or present patterns of behavior.\").  Because on the current record it is impossible to conclude that no reasonable juror could find intentional discrimination, the grant of summary judgment on the disparate treatment claim must also be reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, plaintiffs' attack on defendant's rationales for its wage and benefit policies may in the end prove mistaken.  So far, however, plaintiffs' contentions stand largely unrebutted because the district court did not require the Canal Commission to offer a rebuttal in order to keep plaintiffs from a trial.  On remand the Commission will have the opportunity, and the obligation, to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Panama Canal Treaty of 1977 took effect on this date</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Prior to the Canal Act, the Canal Commission was authorized to pay the tropical differential to all U.S. citizens, but only to U.S. citizens.
