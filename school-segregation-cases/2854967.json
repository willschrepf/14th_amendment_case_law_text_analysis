William A.

We find that the\ndefendant was sentenced under the appropriate offense\nguideline relating to the victim’s age and that the use of the\nvictim’s age to enhance the defendant’s offense level under\nthat new offense guideline does not constitute impermissi-\n\f2                                                    No. 03-2530\n\nble double counting. However, the record does not support\nthe district court’s decision to apply an enhancement for\nabduction and the victim’s vulnerability, and so we agree\nthat the defendant must be resentenced.\n\n\n                     I. BACKGROUND1\n  William A. Beith was born May 21, 1972. At age 19, he\nbegan teaching at the Liberty Baptist Bible Academy\n(Academy) in Lake Station, Indiana. He received his bache-\nlor’s degree in Christian Education in 1995, and served as\nprincipal of the Academy for approximately two years prior\nto the charges in this action.\n  Beith first met G.M. when she began attending the\nAcademy in the third grade at the age of 8 years. In the im-\nmediate years thereafter, Beith developed a relationship\nwith G.M. that he considered to be “close,” yet not so close\nas to transgress appropriate bounds between teacher and\nstudent. The dynamic of their relationship, however, changed\naround February 2001, when G.M. was 11 years old and in\nthe sixth grade. G.M. approached Beith, then 29 years old,\ncomplaining of problems at home. In particular, she told\nhim that her father had touched her inappropriately and\nwas perhaps “peeping” at her. In response, Beith directed\nG.M.’s teacher, Suzanne Waddell, to set up a meeting with\nG.M.’s mother to discuss the allegations. After learning of\nG.M.’s allegations at the meeting, G.M.’s mother confronted\nher husband. The veracity of G.M.’s allegations regarding\nher father remain marginally in doubt.2\n\n\n\n1\n  As Beith pled guilty, we have assembled the facts, as did the\ndistrict court, from the pleadings, grand jury testimony, exhibits,\nFBI reports, and presentencing report.\n2\n  The bulk of the evidence suggests that, when confronted by\nG.M.’s mother, G.M.’s father did not deny the allegations, but per-\n                                                    (continued...)\n\fNo. 03-2530                                                     3\n\n  After the meeting with G.M.’s mother, Beith’s contact\nwith G.M. became more frequent. Beith allowed G.M. and\nother students to visit him in his office during recess and\nlunch breaks, and subsequently encouraged G.M. to come to\nhis office to talk alone. As a result of spending time with\nBeith during the course of the school day, G.M. would be\nlate for class at least two or three times a week. On such\noccasions, Beith would provide G.M. with notes excusing\nher tardiness. Though G.M.’s teacher and other members of\nthe faculty became troubled by the amount of attention\nBeith was lavishing on G.M., Beith sought to assuage those\nconcerns by explaining he was merely counseling G.M.\nabout her family problems.\n  Beith began taking G.M. to his home after school. On one\noccasion, following a math tutoring session, Beith took G.M.\nand a fellow female student out for pizza and then to his\nhouse. After inviting them inside, the girls changed clothes\nin his bedroom. Beith videotaped them as they tried on his\njewelry and played with his computer. The camera predomi-\nnantly focused on G.M.’s private parts, and captures Beith\nexpressing a sexual attraction to the girls. On subsequent\noccasions, Beith brought G.M. alone to his house to engage\nin kissing and fondling. Then he began to increase the\nintimacy of the relationship by disclosing confidences about\nhis sexual experience and loss of virginity.\n  On April 23, 2001, Beith was scheduled to take several\nstudents, including G.M., on a church-sponsored retreat at\na camp in Michigan. During the early morning hours of\nApril 24, 2001, while on the retreat, Beith allowed G.M. and\n\n\n2\n  (...continued)\nsuaded his wife that his conduct occurred as G.M. had attempted\nto wake him from an alcohol-induced slumber. However, Henry\nWaddell, the husband of G.M.’s teacher, testified before the grand\njury that his wife had told him that G.M. had recanted these alle-\ngations in the presence of her parents.\n\f4                                               No. 03-2530\n\none of her friends into his cabin and onto his bed with him.\nIn the presence of the friend, Beith fondled and kissed G.M.\nIn the early morning of the next day, G.M. came to Beith’s\ncabin alone, where he invited her into his bed and at-\ntempted to have unprotected sexual intercourse with her.\nDuring the drive back to Indiana, Beith sat with G.M. on\nthe bus and began discussing with her the possibility of\nrunning away together.\n  On April 27, 2001, Beith picked G.M. up from her house\nafter she had been left home alone. He took her to his\nresidence, where he again fondled and kissed her. He also\nrenewed discussions of leaving the Academy and running\naway with her, revealing (in either this conversation or a\nprevious one) that his destination was Las Vegas, Nevada.\nAt the end of the evening, around 11:00 p.m., he dropped\nher off in the alley behind her home.\n  Soon thereafter, the illicit relationship would be exposed.\nDuring a family birthday dinner at a local restaurant on\nApril 29, 2001, G.M. excused herself from the table to call\nBeith. During the conversation, Beith again asked her to run\naway with him. Upon returning to the table after the call,\nG.M. was pressed by a young family friend to reveal whom\nshe had called. In response, G.M. disclosed to the friend the\nintimate details of her relationship with Beith. The young\nfriend was so disturbed by the revelation that she passed\nalong the information to G.M.’s parents, who in turn took\nG.M. to the hospital the next day to be examined for sexual\nmolestation. In the course of the examination, G.M. informed\na nurse that Beith had indeed attempted sexual intercourse\nwith her. That information was then relayed to G.M.’s\nparents, who subsequently took G.M. to the Lake Station\nPolice Department to be interviewed. At the conclusion of\nthe interview, G.M. and her parents understood that the\npolice intended to question and possibly arrest Beith.\n  After leaving the police station, G.M.’s parents stopped at\na Wal-Mart store. While at the store, G.M. slipped away\n\fNo. 03-2530                                                 5\n\nfrom her parents to call Beith and warn him that the police\nwere on to him and would come calling later that day. In\nresponse, Beith told G.M. that he was leaving town and\nagain asked that she come with him. He then arranged for\nher to meet him at a location near the Wal-Mart. Once at\nthe designated meeting ground, G.M. got into Beith’s vehicle\nwithout any resistance and the two drove away headed for\nLas Vegas.\n  Along the way to Las Vegas, Beith made several stops al-\nlowing G.M. to shop. He also made several stops for over-\nnight stays at hotels, where he repeatedly engaged G.M. in\nunprotected sexual intercourse. The two also discussed\nhaving a baby together, as Beith thought it a “good idea.” In\naddition, he suggested to G.M. on more than one occasion\nthat perhaps he should take her home and then kill himself.\n   On May 8, 2001, Beith was arrested by Las Vegas Police\nin the parking lot of a hotel in which he was staying with\nG.M. Later, during an interview with the FBI, Beith ad-\nmitted taking G.M. and engaging in inappropriate sexual\ncontact with her, but insisted that it was G.M. who had af-\nfirmatively pursued the relationship. He also stated that\nG.M. was at all times during their travels free to leave him.\n  A federal grand jury sitting in the Northern District of\nIndiana returned a two count indictment charging Beith\nwith aggravated sexual abuse in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n§§ 2241(c) and 2246. Subsequently, on or about June 21,\n2002, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern\nDistrict of Indiana returned a one count information\nagainst Beith, charging him with transporting a child under\nthe age of 18 across state lines with the intent to engage in\nprohibited sexual contact in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(b).\nOn July 1, 2002, in consideration for the government’s\nmotion to dismiss the charges of aggravated sexual abuse,\nBeith pled guilty to the charges under 18 U.S.C. § 2423(b)\nand admitted to knowing that G.M. was 11 years old, kiss-\n\f6                                                No. 03-2530\n\ning and fondling her on several occasions, attempting to\nhave sexual intercourse with her at the retreat, driving her\nfrom Indiana to Nevada, and engaging her in sexual inter-\ncourse throughout their travels. Section 2423(b) provides for\na maximum sentence of 180 months.\n  A presentence report (PSR) was prepared using the 2001\nedition of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, recom-\nmending that the district court apply a base offense level of\n27 for the violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(b) pursuant to\nU.S.S.G. § 2A3.1 (by way of the criminal sexual assault\ncross reference, U.S.S.G. § 2A3.2(c)(1), triggered when the\nvictim is under the age of 12). It also recommended a 4-level\nenhancement pursuant to § 4A3.1(b)(2)(A), applicable where\nthe victim had not attained the age of twelve years; a 2-level\nenhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1(b)(3), applicable\nwhere the victim was in the custody, care, or supervisory\ncontrol of the defendant; a 4-level enhancement pursuant to\nU.S.S.G. § 2A3.1(b)(5), applicable where the victim was\nabducted; and a 2-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G.\n§ 3A1.1(b)(1), applicable where the victim was unusually\nvulnerable. Altogether, the PSR recommended a total\noffense level of 39.\n  On the day of the sentencing hearing, Beith withdrew all\nhis objections to the PSR, with the exception of those assert-\ning double counting in the application of U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1 to\nhis offense conduct; the application of the abduction\nenhancement; and the application of the vulnerable victim\nenhancement. He did not object to the enhancement based\non his custody, care, or supervisory control of G.M., nor did\nhe object to the factual statements in the PSR, which the\ncourt adopted.\n  Beith was sentenced on May 28, 2003, and the district court\nrejected each of his outstanding objections to the increase\nof his sentence, specifically concluding that calculation of\nhis sentence under U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1 would not constitute\ndouble counting. It further found, by a preponderance of the\n\fNo. 03-2530                                                  7\n\nevidence, that the § 2A3.1(b)(5) abduction enhancement\nshould be applied to Beith’s guideline calculation because\nhis conduct toward G.M. amounted to “inveigling and\ngrooming.” The court also found, by a preponderance of the\nevidence, that the § 3A1.1(b)(1) vulnerable victim enhance-\nment applied because Beith had pursued the illegal rela-\ntionship with G.M. after being told that her father had\nsubjected her to sexual misconduct. The district court then\ngranted Beith a 3-point reduction for his acceptance of\nresponsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1, leaving him\nwith a total offense level of 36. Falling within criminal\nhistory category I, the Guidelines provided a sentencing\nrange of 188 to 235 months imprisonment. However, the\nstatutory maximum sentence for his crime of conviction was\n180 months; therefore, the court sentenced him to the\nstatutory maximum term. On appeal, Beith contests all\nenhancements save the 2-point enhancement for having\nsupervisory control over the victim.\n\n\n                      II. ANALYSIS\n  Beith raises several challenges to his sentence, which pri-\nmarily attack the propriety of the district court’s application\nof the United States Sentencing Guidelines. He also\ncontends that his sentence is unconstitutional in light of the\nSupreme Court’s recent pronouncement in United States v.\nBooker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005). We begin by addressing the\ndistrict court’s application of certain guidelines provisions.\n\n\nA. Application of U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1 Was Appropriate\n  Beith first asserts that he was improperly sentenced under\n§ 2A3.1 contending that his crime is properly characterized\nas statutory rape and therefore falls within the purview of\n§ 2A3.2. This assertion should be rejected for two reasons.\nFirst, the criminal sexual abuse cross reference expressly\n\f8                                                    No. 03-2530\n\ndirected the district court to apply § 2A3.1, as opposed to\n§ 2A3.2, because Beith committed sexual abuse pursuant to\n§ 2241(c) and G.M. “had not attained the age of 12 years.”\nU.S.S.G. § 2A3.2(c)(1). A defendant who pleads guilty to a\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(b)3 may be sentenced under\nthe statutory rape offense guideline, U.S.S.G. § 2A3.2, which\napplies to sexual abuse of a minor under the age of 16 and\nsets the base offense level at 24. See U.S.S.G. § 2A3.2(a)(1)\n(defining sexual abuse as “the commission of a sexual act” or\n“sexual contact”). However, under § 2A3.2’s cross reference,\n“if the offense involved criminal sexual abuse or attempt to\ncommit criminal sexual abuse (as defined in 18 U.S.C.\n§ 2241 or § 2242)” or “[i]f the victim had not attained the age\nof 12 years,” the defendant must be sentenced pursuant to\n§ 2A3.1, which carries a base offense level of 27. U.S.S.G.\n§ 2A3.2(c)(1).4 The cross reference also explicitly negates the\ndefense of consent. Id. Beith cites United States v. Morris, 204\nF.3d 776, 777-78 (7th Cir. 2000), for the proposition that\nviolations of the federal statutory rape statute, § 2423(b),\nabsent the use of force, require a defendant to be sentenced\nunder § 2A3.2. However, the victim in Morris was over the\nage of 12 and therefore did not trigger the cross reference.\n\n\n3\n   Title 18 U.S.C. § 2423(b) states “[a] person who travels in in-\nterstate commerce . . . for the purpose of engaging in any illicit\nsexual conduct with another person shall be fined under this title\nor imprisoned not more than 30 years, or both.” “Illicit sexual con-\nduct” is defined as “a sexual act . . . with a person under 18 years\nof age . . . .” 18 U.S.C. § 2423(f).\n4\n  Criminal sexual abuse encompasses both “intent to engage in a\nsexual act with a person who has not attained the age of 12 years,”\nas well as “knowingly” engaging in such conduct. 18 U.S.C.\n§ 2241(c). Section 2241, however, also encompasses aggravated\nsexual assault accomplished by force, threat, or other means. Id.\nat § 2241(a) & (b). Section 2242 prohibits sexual abuse of one “in-\ncapable of appraising the nature of the conduct” or “physically\nincapable of declining” to take part in the act. Id. at § 2242.\n\fNo. 03-2530                                                      9\n\nId. at 777. As G.M. was 11 years of age during the commis-\nsion of the crime, Morris is inapposite.\n  Second, though Beith pled guilty to a violation of § 2423(b)\n(traveling with a minor for the purpose of engaging in sexual\nintercourse) as opposed to § 2241(c) (criminal sexual abuse),\nhis offense of conviction is not determinative of his offense\nguideline. See United States v. Angle, 234 F.3d 326, 345 (7th\nCir. 2000) (“[T]he term ‘offense’ is defined broadly to include\nnot only ‘the offense of conviction’ but also all conduct deemed\nrelevant by §1B1.3.”). See also U.S.S.G. § 1B1.2(a) (“[I]n the\ncase of a plea agreement . . . containing a stipulation that\nspecifically establishes a more serious offense than the\noffense of conviction, determine the offense guideline section\nin Chapter Two applicable to the stipulated offense.”).5 The\ndistrict court was free to consider relevant conduct—to\nwhich Beith admitted—when determining which offense\nguideline most appropriately reflected the scope of his crim-\ninal activity. See U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3; United States v. Vang,\n128 F.3d 1065, 1073 (7th Cir. 1997) (affirming use of § 2A3.1\nas offense guideline for sentencing defendant convicted of\nviolating § 2324(b) because defendant used force during the\ncommission of the sexual assault meriting application of\n§ 2A3.1 as opposed to § 2A3.2); United States v. Pollard, 986\n\n\n5\n  In his plea agreement Beith acknowledged that he engaged in\nsexual intercourse with G.M. who was 11 years of age, which con-\nstitutes criminal sexual assault as defined by 18 U.S.C. § 2241(c).\nSee United States v. Morgan, 164 F.3d 1235, 1238-39 (9th Cir. 1999)\n(upholding the applications of § 2A3.1 when the defendant pleaded\nguilty to violating 18 U.S.C. §§ 1153(a) and 2244(a), but admitted\nin his plea agreement that he engaged in sexual intercourse with\nthe victim while she was passed out and therefore incapacitated);\nUnited States v. Lucas, 157 F.3d 998, 1002-03 (5th Cir. 1998)\n(reversing a district court’s determination to apply § 2A3.3 and\nremanding for application of § 2A3.1 as the defendant’s stipulated\nconduct amounted to a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2241 based on his\nuse of force).\n\f10                                                    No. 03-2530\n\nF.2d 44, 47 (3d Cir. 1993) (affirming use of § 2A3.1 guideline\nwhen defendant convicted of kidnaping also sexually assaulted\nvictim). Therefore, based on § 2A3.2’s cross reference as\nwell as the scope of relevant conduct to which he admitted,\nthe district court could properly sentence Beith pursuant to\n§ 2A3.1.\n\n\nB. The District Court Did Not Impermissibly Double\n   Count\n  Having found that Beith could properly be sentenced\nunder § 2A3.1, we now turn to Beith’s argument that the\nuse of the victim’s age to support both the application of\n§ 2A3.1, which carries a higher base offense level, and an\nenhancement pursuant to § 2A3.1(b)(2)(A), amounts to im-\npermissible double counting. Beith’s argument is superfi-\ncially attractive in that G.M.’s age had the substantive\neffect of raising his base offense level three points (if G.M.\nwere over the age of 12, the cross reference would have been\ninapplicable and Beith’s base offense level would have been\n24 pursuant to § 2A3.2) and then subsequently enhancing\nhis offense level four points based on that same factor.6 The\ndistrict court rejected Beith’s challenge to his sentence,\nreasoning that the Guidelines must be read as a whole and\n\n\n6\n   Several of our sister circuits have rejected parallel double coun-\nting arguments. See United States v. Cole, III, 359 F.3d 420, 426-28\n(6th Cir. 2004) (applying § 2A3.1 as offense guideline, pursuant to\nkidnaping cross reference, § 2A4.1(b)(7)(A), because the victim was\nabducted and sexually assaulted and then enhancing defendant’s\nsentence under § 2A3.1(b)(5) for abduction); United States v.\nArchdale, 229 F.3d 861, 868-69 (9th Cir. 2000) (reasoning that\ndistrict court properly sentenced defendant under § 2A3.1, pur-\nsuant to the sexual assault cross reference in § 2A3.2(c)(1) based\non the use of force and also properly enhanced defendant’s sen-\ntence under § 2A3.1(b)(1) for the use of force); United States v.\nLewis, 115 F.3d 1531, 1536-37 (11th Cir. 1997) (same as Cole III).\n\fNo. 03-2530                                                11\n\nexplicitly permit G.M.’s age to be used twice. See U.S.S.G.\n§§ 1B1.1, application note 4(A), (B), & 1B1.5(a).\n  We reject appellant’s argument for several reasons. First,\nthe plain language of the Guidelines expressly directs this\nresult. Second, the application of § 2A3.1 (base offense level\nof 27) over § 2A3.2 (base offense level of 24) does not amount\nto an “increase” or enhancement, as the Guidelines must be\napplied as a whole. Finally, the bar on double counting is\nnot implicated because the Sentencing Commission in\nsetting the base offense level for § 2A3.1 did not account for\nthe victim’s age.\n   Generally, impermissible double counting occurs when\nidentical conduct justifies two upward adjustments under\nthe Guidelines. United States v. Haines, 32 F.3d 290, 293\n(7th Cir. 1994). Put another way, a district court may not\ndescribe the same conduct in two different ways to justify\ntwo upward adjustments.

According to the plain language\nof the Guidelines, as discussed above, a defendant must be\nsentenced pursuant to § 2A3.1 if the victim of his sexual\nabuse is under 12 years of age and then subsequently en-\nhanced four points based on the same element. U.S.S.G.\n§ 2A3.1(b)(2)(A). Absent a clear statement by the Guidelines\nthat such an element may not be used twice, we will apply\nthe Guidelines as written. See United States v. Jimenez, 897\nF.2d 286, 287 (7th Cir. 1990) (reasoning that “where the\nGuidelines except an element of the crime from enhancing\na sentence, their intent is expressly stated” and listing\n§ 3A1.1 app. note. 2, § 3B1.3, and § 3C1.1 as examples of\nexpress prohibition).\n  Moreover, it is perfectly rational for the Guidelines to\ntreat sexual assault against victims under the age of 12\nwith more severity.7 By enhancing a defendant’s base of-\nfense level two points for a victim between the age of 12 and\n\n\n7\n   In United States v. Shannon, 110 F.3d 382, 387 (7th Cir. 1997)\n(en banc), this court recognized the increased dangers associated\nwith a victim so young. We reasoned that “[a] 13 year old is un-\nlikely to have a full appreciation of the disease and fertility risks\nof intercourse, an accurate knowledge of contraceptives and dis-\nease-preventive measures, and the maturity to make a rational\ncomparison of the costs and benefits of premarital intercourse.” Id.\n\fNo. 03-2530                                                 13\n\n16, § 2A3.1(b)(2)(B), and four points for a victim under the\nage of 12, § 2A3.1(b)(2)(A), the guidelines reflect a “gradu-\nated adjustment scheme,” United States v. Sorensen, 58\nF.3d 1154, 1161 (7th Cir. 1995), which treats egregious con-\nduct more harshly. See U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1 cmt. background\n(“An enhancement is provided when the victim is less than\nsixteen years of age. An additional enhancement is pro-\nvided where the victim is less than twelve years of age.”)\n(emphasis added).\n  Beith’s argument that his offense level was “increased”\ntwice based on the victim’s age must also be rejected. As the\ndistrict court noted, the Guidelines must be read as a\nwhole. “A cross reference (an instruction to apply another\noffense guideline) refers to the entire offense guideline (i.e.,\nthe base offense level, specific offense characteristics, cross\nreferences and special instructions).” U.S.S.G. § 1B1.5(a).\nApplication of the cross reference or the determination of\nthe appropriate offense guideline based on the relevant\nconduct inquiry does not “increase” a defendant’s offense\nlevel. It merely sentences him under the offense guideline\nwhich reflects the full scope of his conduct. U.S.S.G. §§ 1B1.1\napp. note 4(A). Accord United States v. Sanchez, 354 F.3d\n70, 78-79 (1st Cir. 2004) (reasoning that once a court deems\na cross reference applicable, it must proceed to the new\noffense guideline and apply it as written); United States v.\nValdez-Torres, 108 F.3d 385, 389 n.7 (D.C. Cir. 1997)\n(rejecting argument that applying proper offense guideline\nwith a higher base offense level may be characterized as\n“increasing” base offense level).\n  Finally, we cannot say that the Guidelines fully accounted\nfor the degree of harm caused in light of G.M.’s age when it\nset the base offense level for § 2A3.1, such that a subse-\nquent enhancement for age would constitute double count-\ning. According to the commentary to § 2A.3.1, “[t]he base\noffense level represents sexual abuse as set forth in 18\nU.S.C. § 2242.” U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1 cmt. background. Section\n2242 prohibits sexual abuse of a victim otherwise incapable\n\f14                                               No. 03-2530\n\nof understanding or declining the defendant’s actions. This\nguideline does not provide for an additional enhancement\nbased on a victim’s incapacitation. By expressly defining the\nscope of the conduct accounted for in the base offense level,\nthe Guidelines are clear that the base offense level does not\nexpressly account for age while it does account for a victim’s\nincapacitation.\n  This court has applied similar logic concerning the use of\nconduct to apply an enhancement which encompasses an\nelement of the offense of conviction, concluding that “[t]he\nbar on double counting comes into play only if the offense\nitself necessarily includes the same conduct as the enhance-\nment.” United States v. Senn, 129 F.3d 886, 897 (7th Cir.\n1997) (emphasis in original); United States v. Ford, 21 F.3d\n759,765 (7th Cir. 1994) (“[T]he base offense level prescribed\nby the guidelines for a particular crime presumably reflects,\nor ‘includes,’ those characteristics considered by Congress\nto inhere in the crime at issue.”) (quoting United States v.\nButt, 955 F.2d 77, 89 (1st Cir. 1992)). Accord United States\nv.

For example, in United\nStates v. Wimberly, 60 F.3d 281, 288 (7th Cir. 1995), we\nheld that a defendant convicted of the criminal sexual\nassault of an individual under the age of 12, pursuant to 18\nU.S.C. § 2241(c), was not subject to double counting when\nthe district court also enhanced his offense level four points\nbased on the victim’s age, pursuant to § 2A3.1(b)(2)(A). We\nreasoned that because the § 2A3.1(b) enhancements apply\nto convictions under both § 2241 and § 2242—and, signifi-\ncantly, a violation of § 2242 does not require the victim to be\nunder the age of 12—these enhancements “account for more\n\fNo. 03-2530                                                        15\n\negregious conduct” and thus were drafted “as punishment\nmechanisms distinct from the underlying offense.” Id.\nAccord United States v. Balfany, 965 F.2d 575, 584 (8th Cir.\n1992) (rejecting parallel argument reasoning that “[t]he\nSentencing Commission obviously intended that the age of\nthe victim and other elements of aggravated sexual assault\nbe addressed through enhancements of the base offense level”);\nUnited States v. Ransom, 942 F.2d 775, 778-79 (10th Cir.\n1991) (same).8 For these reasons, Beith’s sentence could\n\n\n\n8\n   Though not addressing the precise question presented by Beith,\nin United States v. Sorensen, 58 F.3d 1154, 1160-61 (7th Cir. 1995),\nthis court found no double counting when the district court ap-\nplied the aggravated assault offense guideline, § 2A2.2, based on\nthe “involvement” of a dangerous weapon in the commission of\na crime, and then subsequently enhanced the defendant’s sen-\ntence, pursuant to § 2A2.2(b)(2)(B), based on the “use” of the dan-\ngerous weapon in the commission of the crime. We also rejected\nthe defendant’s second double counting argument concerning the\nuse of the victim’s status as a federal officer. We found that dif-\nferent conduct supported the application of the offense guideline\n(i.e., the victim’s status as a federal officer) and the enhancement\n(i.e., the fact that the defendant’s actions were motivated by the\nvictim’s status). Id. Accord United States v. Johnstone, 107 F.3d\n200, 212 (3d Cir. 1997); Valdez-Torres, 108 F.3d at 389; Reese,\n2 F.3d at 896; United States v. Williams, 954 F.2d 204, 207 (4th\nCir. 1992). But see United States v. Farrow, 198 F.3d 179, 195 (6th\nCir. 1999) and United States v.

The government\ncites Sorensen for the proposition that the Guidelines invite certain\ntypes of double counting; however, in Sorensen we rejected the\n                                                         (continued...)\n\f16                                                  No. 03-2530\n\nproperly be enhanced four points based on G.M.’s age.\n\n\nC. Vulnerable Victim            Enhancement          Was     Not\n   Appropriate\n   Beith next challenges the district court’s decision to en-\nhance his sentence two points pursuant to § 3A1.1(b)(1)\nbased on the district court’s conclusion that G.M. was “par-\nticularly susceptible to criminal conduct.” The district court\nbased its decision upon the following findings:\n     The victim had previously disclosed to Defendant\n     allegations of misconduct directed to her by her\n     father. Defendant’s Exhibit D at Pages 13 and\n     14. . . . [W]hether the underlying conducts actually\n     occurred remains unknown, it is undisputed that the\n     victim claimed that she had been subject to miscon-\n     duct. The victim was upset by her family problems\n     and even cursed her father in the Defendant’s video-\n     tapes of the victim. See Government’s Exhibits 9 and\n     14. The defendant did not discourage the victim’s be-\n     havior when she was repeatedly cursing her father.\n     The defendant knew this and stepped up his conduct\n     with the victim after learning these facts. When\n     Defendant was confronted by Ms. Waddell about the\n     amount of time the [victim] was missing, he explained\n     that he was counseling her regarding family prob-\n     lems. Defendant’s Exhibit D at 16.\n\n\n\n8\n   (...continued)\ndefendant’s double counting arguments because we found that the\nconduct which supported the application of the offense guideline\nand the subsequent enhancement was in fact distinct. Here, where\nit is only the victim’s age which supports both application of the\noffense guideline and a subsequent enhancement under that new\nguideline, Sorensen is instructive but not conclusive.\n\fNo. 03-2530                                                 17\n\nSent. Tr. II at 83-84 (emphasis added). Assuming that the\nfacts upon which the enhancement was based were properly\nfound, see United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005), the\ndistrict court’s determination that the victim was “unusually\nvulnerable” is reviewed here for clear error, see United States\nv. Parolin, 239 F.3d 922, 926 (7th Cir. 2001).\n  Section 3A1.1(b)(1) provides that a defendant’s base offense\nlevel should be increased two points “[i]f the defendant knew\nor should have known that a victim of the offense was a\nvulnerable victim.” The purpose of this enhancement is to\npunish a defendant for taking advantage of victims who are\nless able or likely to protect themselves from criminal\nconduct. United States v. Grimes, 173 F.3d 634, 637 (7th\nCir. 1999); United States v. Lallemand, 989 F.2d 936, 939\n(7th Cir. 1993). A victim may be vulnerable due to “age,\nphysical or mental condition,” or may be “otherwise parti-\ncularly susceptible to the criminal conduct.” U.S.S.G. § 3A1.1\napp. note 2. This enhancement is inapplicable “if the factor\nthat makes the person a vulnerable victim is incorporated\nin the offense guideline. For example, if the offense guide-\nline provides an enhancement for the age of the victim, this\nsubsection would not be applied unless the victim was\nunusually vulnerable for reasons unrelated to age.” Id.\nWhile it is no longer necessary to prove that the defendant\ntargeted the victim based on his or her vulnerability, the\ngovernment still has the burden of proving the particular\ncharacteristic of the victim which makes him or her vul-\nnerable. United States v. Paneras, 222 F.3d 406, 413 (7th\nCir. 2000).\n  As Beith’s sentence had already been enhanced based on\nG.M.’s age, the district court properly segregated that factor\nfrom its discussion concerning vulnerability. However, the\ncourt failed to make any findings concerning whether G.M.\nwas in fact molested by her father. During the first sentenc-\ning hearing the defendant stipulated that he was “made\naware of allegations regarding prior molestation.” Sent. Tr.\n\f18                                                    No. 03-2530\n\nI at 5 (emphasis added). The defendant, however, maintains\nthat G.M. recanted, while the government argues that she\nsustained her accusation. Victims of molestation and sexual\nassault certainly qualify as vulnerable victims, see United\nStates v. Snyder, 189 F.3d 640, 649 (7th Cir. 1999) (victim\nhad a history of molestation); United States v. Newman, 965\nF.2d 206, 211 (7th Cir. 1992) (20-year-old victim was raped\nat 15); United States v. White, 979 F.2d 539, 544 (7th Cir.\n1992) (victim lived in group home and had a history of\nsexual abuse), as do those found to have mental or severe\nemotional problems, see, e.g., United States v. Romero, 189\nF.3d 576, 590 (7th Cir. 1999) (victim was an adopted child\nunder the treatment of a psychiatrist for Attention Deficit\nDisorder and had a history of emotional problems). How-\never, the district court did not find that G.M. was in fact a\nvictim of molestation or that she had severe emotional\nproblems. The court seems to imply that a child who alleges\nmolestation, whether verified or not, is vulnerable. We\ncannot agree. Given the fact that G.M.’s age had already\nbeen the subject of an enhancement, her allegations of\nmolestation standing alone are insufficient to establish\nvulnerability.9\n\n\n9\n  Though the district court adopted the findings in the PSR, the\nPSR states only that:\n     [S]ometime in late February, early March, G.M. confided\n     to the defendant that her father had inappropriately\n     touched her breast and her bottom when he was drunk.\n     Initially, Mr. Beith directed G.M. to tell her mother. In\n     reality, G.M. did not inform her mother. Approximately\n     a month later, in a meeting with G.M.’s mother regarding\n     tutoring, Beith brought up the topic of G.M.’s father\n     touching her. At that time, she was shocked to learn of the\n     allegation and she immediately confronted her husband.\n     G.M.’s mother indicates that she believes her daughter’s\n                                                      (continued...)\n\fNo. 03-2530                                                       19\n\n  Without a finding from the lower court that sufficient\nevidence exists to substantiate the allegations of molesta-\ntion, or that G.M. was suffering from severe emotional prob-\nlems, we are left with findings that G.M. was having family\nproblems and was seen cursing her father. Unfortunately,\nfamily discord is common among victims such as G.M. See\nUnited States v. Williams, 291 F.3d 1180, 1196 (9th Cir. 2002)\n(upholding application of enhancement where district court\nfound that victim had a mental condition and was previously\nraped but reversing application of enhancement based on\nvictim’s unstable personal life and a chemical dependency\nas the latter victim’s characteristics were typical of Mann\nAct (18 U.S.C. § 2423) victims); see also United States v.\nEvans, 285 F.3d 664, 672 (8th Cir. 2002) (reasoning that a\nfinding of vulnerability should be based on a factor/char-\nacteristic which is unusual to victims of the underlying\noffense); United States v. Footman, 66 F. Supp. 2d 83, 96 (D.\nMass. 1999) (same) (citing United States v. Sabatino, 943\nF.2d 94, 103 (1st Cir. 1991)). A finding of family problems,\ntherefore, is not sufficient to support this enhancement.\nAnd this is to say nothing of the impropriety of increasing\nBeith’s sentence based on facts neither jury proven nor\ndefendant admitted under the mandatory scheme that once\nwas the Guidelines. See Booker, 125 S. Ct. at 756. Accord-\ningly, and notwithstanding our distaste for the particular\nheinousness of his crime, we must vacate Beith’s sentence\nand remand this case for a determination of whether the\nrecord supports a finding that G.M. was in fact vulnerable.\n Having decided to vacate and remand Beith’s sentence,\nwe note that when the district court imposes its new sen-\n\n\n9\n    (...continued)\n       accusation but thinks her husband’s conduct was a result\n       of his drinking problem, and not that he touched her for\n       his own gratification.\nPSR at ¶ 14. However, it is clear from the court’s findings that it\ndid not find that the molestation actually occurred.\n\f20                                               No. 03-2530\n\ntence upon remand, it must do so in accord with Booker, as\nBooker decidedly governs all sentences imposed after its\ndate of decision. So if the district court again contemplates\nexercising its discretion to increase Beith’s sentence, it\nmust first concentrate its attention on the universe of sen-\ntencing factors and policy concerns memorialized by Justice\nBreyer’s remedial opinion (Booker, 125 S. Ct. at 764-66) and\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).\n\n\nD. Abduction Enhancement Was Not Appropriate\n  Beith also challenges the district court’s application of an\nabduction enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1(b)(5)\n(providing for a 4-level increase where the victim was ab-\nducted). The Guidelines define abduction as “forcing” a vic-\ntim to accompany an offender to a different location.\nU.S.S.G. § 1B1.1 app. note 1(a). This court equates abduc-\ntion to kidnaping, reasoning that physical force is not\nnecessary to kidnap or abduct. Romero, 189 F.3d at 590.\n“Inveigling,” or imposing one’s will through “trickery” or\n“gentle urging” or flattery, is a proper basis for applying the\nenhancement. Id. (adopting reasoning of United States v.\nSaknikent, 30 F.3d 1012, 1014 (8th Cir. 1994)); see also\nUnited States v. Hefferon, 314 F.3d 211, 226-27 (5th Cir.\n2002) (finding abduction where the defendant appealed to\na seven year old’s obedience to adults to lure her to a se-\ncluded place to force her to perform oral sex). Here, the\ndistrict court found that Beith abducted G.M. through the\nprocess of inveigling. To support its finding of inveigling,\nthe district court found that Beith: (1) spent a “considerable\namount of time with [G.M.]”; (2) gave her special privileges\nin school by allowing her to spend time in his office and giv-\ning her passes when she was late to class; (3) took G.M. to\nhis home on several occasions; (4) videotaped her; (5) had\ninappropriate conversations with her about him no longer\nbeing a virgin; (6) gave her a pendant and his watch; and,\n\fNo. 03-2530                                                21\n\n(7) told the victim he would commit suicide if she left him.\nAgain, assuming all penultimate facts were properly found,\nsee United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005), we review\nthe district court’s ultimate finding that Beith abducted\nG.M. for clear error. United States v. Vang, 128 F.3d 1065,\n1073 (7th Cir. 1997) (reviewing factual finding for clear\nerror).\n  Beith argues that his actions do not rise to the level of\n“inveigling” because he did not “deceive” or “trick” G.M. into\nleaving with him. He relies on Romero, in which this court\nfound abduction by inveigling where the defendant lied to\nthe victim about his identity over the Internet to gain the\nchild’s confidences and convince him to flee with the\ndefendant. While he argues that all the “abduction\nby inveigling” cases thus far have involved in some form a\ndeception, it does not necessarily follow that “inveigling”\nunder the Guidelines requires deceit or trickery.\n  Nonetheless, we find that the evidence could not support\na finding of “abduction by inveigling.” Recall that it was\nG.M. who called to warn Beith of the police’s intent to inter-\nview and possibly arrest him. The factual findings suggest\nthat Beith’s reprehensible actions were not so much con-\ncentrated toward imposing his will over G.M. in absconding\nto Las Vegas as they were motivated toward cultivating a\nsincere—albeit perverse and illegal—relationship. Indeed,\nhe made no false promises to her, and his overtures, while\nundeniably vile, were cloaked in neither deceit nor trickery.\nAt most, the findings upon which the district court based\nthe abduction enhancement suggest that Beith endeavored\nto develop G.M.’s trust—a trust that he would ultimately\nabuse. This behavior also merits punishment, and for it the\ndistrict court has already obliged by enhancing his sentence\npursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1(b)(3) (the enhancement based\non his custody and supervisory control over G.M. as her\n\f22                                                    No. 03-2530\n\nprincipal).10 But we find no tenable connection between the\nmanner in which Beith pursued G.M. in molesting her and\nhis ultimate act of driving her to Nevada that could justify\na finding of abduction. Accordingly, additional enhancement\nunder the rubric of “abduction by inveigling” is inappropri-\nate here, and thus provides another ground for vacating\nsentence and remand.\n  Furthermore, with the Supreme Court’s recent pro-\nnouncement in United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738\n(2005), the district court’s basis for imposing the abduction\nenhancement has been compromised. Here, the district court\nerred both by increasing Beith’s sentence—via the obstruc-\ntion of justice enhancement—based on facts neither admitted\nby himself nor proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt,\nid. at 756 (holding that under the formerly mandatory\nGuidelines regime, “[a]ny fact (other than a prior convic-\ntion) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the\nmaximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of\nguilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or\nproved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt”), and through\nits mandatory application of the Guidelines in imposing his\nsentence, see id. at 757, 769 (remedying the Guidelines by\nrendering them “effectively advisory,” and allowing for\nresentencing notwithstanding the absence of a Sixth\nAmendment violation in a case where Guidelines\nmandatorily imposed); United States v.

William A.

We find that the\ndefendant was sentenced under the appropriate offense\nguideline relating to the victim’s age and that the use of the\nvictim’s age to enhance the defendant’s offense level under\nthat new offense guideline does not constitute impermissi-\n\f2                                                    No. 03-2530\n\nble double counting. However, the record does not support\nthe district court’s decision to apply an enhancement for\nabduction and the victim’s vulnerability, and so we agree\nthat the defendant must be resentenced.\n\n\n                     I. BACKGROUND1\n  William A. Beith was born May 21, 1972. At age 19, he\nbegan teaching at the Liberty Baptist Bible Academy\n(Academy) in Lake Station, Indiana. He received his bache-\nlor’s degree in Christian Education in 1995, and served as\nprincipal of the Academy for approximately two years prior\nto the charges in this action.\n  Beith first met G.M. when she began attending the\nAcademy in the third grade at the age of 8 years. In the im-\nmediate years thereafter, Beith developed a relationship\nwith G.M. that he considered to be “close,” yet not so close\nas to transgress appropriate bounds between teacher and\nstudent. The dynamic of their relationship, however, changed\naround February 2001, when G.M. was 11 years old and in\nthe sixth grade. G.M. approached Beith, then 29 years old,\ncomplaining of problems at home. In particular, she told\nhim that her father had touched her inappropriately and\nwas perhaps “peeping” at her. In response, Beith directed\nG.M.’s teacher, Suzanne Waddell, to set up a meeting with\nG.M.’s mother to discuss the allegations. After learning of\nG.M.’s allegations at the meeting, G.M.’s mother confronted\nher husband. The veracity of G.M.’s allegations regarding\nher father remain marginally in doubt.2\n\n\n\n1\n  As Beith pled guilty, we have assembled the facts, as did the\ndistrict court, from the pleadings, grand jury testimony, exhibits,\nFBI reports, and presentencing report.\n2\n  The bulk of the evidence suggests that, when confronted by\nG.M.’s mother, G.M.’s father did not deny the allegations, but per-\n                                                    (continued...)\n\fNo. 03-2530                                                     3\n\n  After the meeting with G.M.’s mother, Beith’s contact\nwith G.M. became more frequent. Beith allowed G.M. and\nother students to visit him in his office during recess and\nlunch breaks, and subsequently encouraged G.M. to come to\nhis office to talk alone. As a result of spending time with\nBeith during the course of the school day, G.M. would be\nlate for class at least two or three times a week. On such\noccasions, Beith would provide G.M. with notes excusing\nher tardiness. Though G.M.’s teacher and other members of\nthe faculty became troubled by the amount of attention\nBeith was lavishing on G.M., Beith sought to assuage those\nconcerns by explaining he was merely counseling G.M.\nabout her family problems.\n  Beith began taking G.M. to his home after school. On one\noccasion, following a math tutoring session, Beith took G.M.\nand a fellow female student out for pizza and then to his\nhouse. After inviting them inside, the girls changed clothes\nin his bedroom. Beith videotaped them as they tried on his\njewelry and played with his computer. The camera predomi-\nnantly focused on G.M.’s private parts, and captures Beith\nexpressing a sexual attraction to the girls. On subsequent\noccasions, Beith brought G.M. alone to his house to engage\nin kissing and fondling. Then he began to increase the\nintimacy of the relationship by disclosing confidences about\nhis sexual experience and loss of virginity.\n  On April 23, 2001, Beith was scheduled to take several\nstudents, including G.M., on a church-sponsored retreat at\na camp in Michigan. During the early morning hours of\nApril 24, 2001, while on the retreat, Beith allowed G.M. and\n\n\n2\n  (...continued)\nsuaded his wife that his conduct occurred as G.M. had attempted\nto wake him from an alcohol-induced slumber. However, Henry\nWaddell, the husband of G.M.’s teacher, testified before the grand\njury that his wife had told him that G.M. had recanted these alle-\ngations in the presence of her parents.\n\f4                                               No. 03-2530\n\none of her friends into his cabin and onto his bed with him.\nIn the presence of the friend, Beith fondled and kissed G.M.\nIn the early morning of the next day, G.M. came to Beith’s\ncabin alone, where he invited her into his bed and at-\ntempted to have unprotected sexual intercourse with her.\nDuring the drive back to Indiana, Beith sat with G.M. on\nthe bus and began discussing with her the possibility of\nrunning away together.\n  On April 27, 2001, Beith picked G.M. up from her house\nafter she had been left home alone. He took her to his\nresidence, where he again fondled and kissed her. He also\nrenewed discussions of leaving the Academy and running\naway with her, revealing (in either this conversation or a\nprevious one) that his destination was Las Vegas, Nevada.\nAt the end of the evening, around 11:00 p.m., he dropped\nher off in the alley behind her home.\n  Soon thereafter, the illicit relationship would be exposed.\nDuring a family birthday dinner at a local restaurant on\nApril 29, 2001, G.M. excused herself from the table to call\nBeith. During the conversation, Beith again asked her to run\naway with him. Upon returning to the table after the call,\nG.M. was pressed by a young family friend to reveal whom\nshe had called. In response, G.M. disclosed to the friend the\nintimate details of her relationship with Beith. The young\nfriend was so disturbed by the revelation that she passed\nalong the information to G.M.’s parents, who in turn took\nG.M. to the hospital the next day to be examined for sexual\nmolestation. In the course of the examination, G.M. informed\na nurse that Beith had indeed attempted sexual intercourse\nwith her. That information was then relayed to G.M.’s\nparents, who subsequently took G.M. to the Lake Station\nPolice Department to be interviewed. At the conclusion of\nthe interview, G.M. and her parents understood that the\npolice intended to question and possibly arrest Beith.\n  After leaving the police station, G.M.’s parents stopped at\na Wal-Mart store. While at the store, G.M. slipped away\n\fNo. 03-2530                                                 5\n\nfrom her parents to call Beith and warn him that the police\nwere on to him and would come calling later that day. In\nresponse, Beith told G.M. that he was leaving town and\nagain asked that she come with him. He then arranged for\nher to meet him at a location near the Wal-Mart. Once at\nthe designated meeting ground, G.M. got into Beith’s vehicle\nwithout any resistance and the two drove away headed for\nLas Vegas.\n  Along the way to Las Vegas, Beith made several stops al-\nlowing G.M. to shop. He also made several stops for over-\nnight stays at hotels, where he repeatedly engaged G.M. in\nunprotected sexual intercourse. The two also discussed\nhaving a baby together, as Beith thought it a “good idea.” In\naddition, he suggested to G.M. on more than one occasion\nthat perhaps he should take her home and then kill himself.\n   On May 8, 2001, Beith was arrested by Las Vegas Police\nin the parking lot of a hotel in which he was staying with\nG.M. Later, during an interview with the FBI, Beith ad-\nmitted taking G.M. and engaging in inappropriate sexual\ncontact with her, but insisted that it was G.M. who had af-\nfirmatively pursued the relationship. He also stated that\nG.M. was at all times during their travels free to leave him.\n  A federal grand jury sitting in the Northern District of\nIndiana returned a two count indictment charging Beith\nwith aggravated sexual abuse in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n§§ 2241(c) and 2246. Subsequently, on or about June 21,\n2002, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern\nDistrict of Indiana returned a one count information\nagainst Beith, charging him with transporting a child under\nthe age of 18 across state lines with the intent to engage in\nprohibited sexual contact in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(b).\nOn July 1, 2002, in consideration for the government’s\nmotion to dismiss the charges of aggravated sexual abuse,\nBeith pled guilty to the charges under 18 U.S.C. § 2423(b)\nand admitted to knowing that G.M. was 11 years old, kiss-\n\f6                                                No. 03-2530\n\ning and fondling her on several occasions, attempting to\nhave sexual intercourse with her at the retreat, driving her\nfrom Indiana to Nevada, and engaging her in sexual inter-\ncourse throughout their travels. Section 2423(b) provides for\na maximum sentence of 180 months.\n  A presentence report (PSR) was prepared using the 2001\nedition of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, recom-\nmending that the district court apply a base offense level of\n27 for the violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(b) pursuant to\nU.S.S.G. § 2A3.1 (by way of the criminal sexual assault\ncross reference, U.S.S.G. § 2A3.2(c)(1), triggered when the\nvictim is under the age of 12). It also recommended a 4-level\nenhancement pursuant to § 4A3.1(b)(2)(A), applicable where\nthe victim had not attained the age of twelve years; a 2-level\nenhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1(b)(3), applicable\nwhere the victim was in the custody, care, or supervisory\ncontrol of the defendant; a 4-level enhancement pursuant to\nU.S.S.G. § 2A3.1(b)(5), applicable where the victim was\nabducted; and a 2-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G.\n§ 3A1.1(b)(1), applicable where the victim was unusually\nvulnerable. Altogether, the PSR recommended a total\noffense level of 39.\n  On the day of the sentencing hearing, Beith withdrew all\nhis objections to the PSR, with the exception of those assert-\ning double counting in the application of U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1 to\nhis offense conduct; the application of the abduction\nenhancement; and the application of the vulnerable victim\nenhancement. He did not object to the enhancement based\non his custody, care, or supervisory control of G.M., nor did\nhe object to the factual statements in the PSR, which the\ncourt adopted.\n  Beith was sentenced on May 28, 2003, and the district court\nrejected each of his outstanding objections to the increase\nof his sentence, specifically concluding that calculation of\nhis sentence under U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1 would not constitute\ndouble counting. It further found, by a preponderance of the\n\fNo. 03-2530                                                  7\n\nevidence, that the § 2A3.1(b)(5) abduction enhancement\nshould be applied to Beith’s guideline calculation because\nhis conduct toward G.M. amounted to “inveigling and\ngrooming.” The court also found, by a preponderance of the\nevidence, that the § 3A1.1(b)(1) vulnerable victim enhance-\nment applied because Beith had pursued the illegal rela-\ntionship with G.M. after being told that her father had\nsubjected her to sexual misconduct. The district court then\ngranted Beith a 3-point reduction for his acceptance of\nresponsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1, leaving him\nwith a total offense level of 36. Falling within criminal\nhistory category I, the Guidelines provided a sentencing\nrange of 188 to 235 months imprisonment. However, the\nstatutory maximum sentence for his crime of conviction was\n180 months; therefore, the court sentenced him to the\nstatutory maximum term. On appeal, Beith contests all\nenhancements save the 2-point enhancement for having\nsupervisory control over the victim.\n\n\n                      II. ANALYSIS\n  Beith raises several challenges to his sentence, which pri-\nmarily attack the propriety of the district court’s application\nof the United States Sentencing Guidelines. He also\ncontends that his sentence is unconstitutional in light of the\nSupreme Court’s recent pronouncement in United States v.\nBooker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005). We begin by addressing the\ndistrict court’s application of certain guidelines provisions.\n\n\nA. Application of U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1 Was Appropriate\n  Beith first asserts that he was improperly sentenced under\n§ 2A3.1 contending that his crime is properly characterized\nas statutory rape and therefore falls within the purview of\n§ 2A3.2. This assertion should be rejected for two reasons.\nFirst, the criminal sexual abuse cross reference expressly\n\f8                                                    No. 03-2530\n\ndirected the district court to apply § 2A3.1, as opposed to\n§ 2A3.2, because Beith committed sexual abuse pursuant to\n§ 2241(c) and G.M. “had not attained the age of 12 years.”\nU.S.S.G. § 2A3.2(c)(1). A defendant who pleads guilty to a\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(b)3 may be sentenced under\nthe statutory rape offense guideline, U.S.S.G. § 2A3.2, which\napplies to sexual abuse of a minor under the age of 16 and\nsets the base offense level at 24. See U.S.S.G. § 2A3.2(a)(1)\n(defining sexual abuse as “the commission of a sexual act” or\n“sexual contact”). However, under § 2A3.2’s cross reference,\n“if the offense involved criminal sexual abuse or attempt to\ncommit criminal sexual abuse (as defined in 18 U.S.C.\n§ 2241 or § 2242)” or “[i]f the victim had not attained the age\nof 12 years,” the defendant must be sentenced pursuant to\n§ 2A3.1, which carries a base offense level of 27. U.S.S.G.\n§ 2A3.2(c)(1).4 The cross reference also explicitly negates the\ndefense of consent. Id. Beith cites United States v. Morris, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767768\"><a href=\"/opinion/767768/united-states-v-michael-l-morris/\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">776</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 777-78 (7th Cir. 2000), for the proposition that\nviolations of the federal statutory rape statute, § 2423(b),\nabsent the use of force, require a defendant to be sentenced\nunder § 2A3.2. However, the victim in Morris was over the\nage of 12 and therefore did not trigger the cross reference.\n\n\n3\n   Title 18 U.S.C. § 2423(b) states “[a] person who travels in in-\nterstate commerce . . . for the purpose of engaging in any illicit\nsexual conduct with another person shall be fined under this title\nor imprisoned not more than 30 years, or both.” “Illicit sexual con-\nduct” is defined as “a sexual act . . . with a person under 18 years\nof age . . . .” 18 U.S.C. § 2423(f).\n4\n  Criminal sexual abuse encompasses both “intent to engage in a\nsexual act with a person who has not attained the age of 12 years,”\nas well as “knowingly” engaging in such conduct. 18 U.S.C.\n§ 2241(c). Section 2241, however, also encompasses aggravated\nsexual assault accomplished by force, threat, or other means. Id.\nat § 2241(a) & (b). Section 2242 prohibits sexual abuse of one “in-\ncapable of appraising the nature of the conduct” or “physically\nincapable of declining” to take part in the act. Id. at § 2242.\n\fNo. 03-2530                                                      9\n\nId. at 777. As G.M. was 11 years of age during the commis-\nsion of the crime, Morris is inapposite.\n  Second, though Beith pled guilty to a violation of § 2423(b)\n(traveling with a minor for the purpose of engaging in sexual\nintercourse) as opposed to § 2241(c) (criminal sexual abuse),\nhis offense of conviction is not determinative of his offense\nguideline.

Angle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771348\"><a href=\"/opinion/771348/united-states-v-ralph-wayne-angle/\"><span class=\"volume\">234</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">326</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 345 (7th\nCir. 2000) (“[T]he term ‘offense’ is defined broadly to include\nnot only ‘the offense of conviction’ but also all conduct deemed\nrelevant by §1B1.3.”).

Therefore, based on § 2A3.2’s cross reference as\nwell as the scope of relevant conduct to which he admitted,\nthe district court could properly sentence Beith pursuant to\n§ 2A3.1.\n\n\nB. The District Court Did Not Impermissibly Double\n   Count\n  Having found that Beith could properly be sentenced\nunder § 2A3.1, we now turn to Beith’s argument that the\nuse of the victim’s age to support both the application of\n§ 2A3.1, which carries a higher base offense level, and an\nenhancement pursuant to § 2A3.1(b)(2)(A), amounts to im-\npermissible double counting. Beith’s argument is superfi-\ncially attractive in that G.M.’s age had the substantive\neffect of raising his base offense level three points (if G.M.\nwere over the age of 12, the cross reference would have been\ninapplicable and Beith’s base offense level would have been\n24 pursuant to § 2A3.2) and then subsequently enhancing\nhis offense level four points based on that same factor.6 The\ndistrict court rejected Beith’s challenge to his sentence,\nreasoning that the Guidelines must be read as a whole and\n\n\n6\n   Several of our sister circuits have rejected parallel double coun-\nting arguments.

According to the commentary to § 2A.3.1, “[t]he base\noffense level represents sexual abuse as set forth in 18\nU.S.C. § 2242.” U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1 cmt. background.

How-\never, the district court did not find that G.M. was in fact a\nvictim of molestation or that she had severe emotional\nproblems. The court seems to imply that a child who alleges\nmolestation, whether verified or not, is vulnerable. We\ncannot agree. Given the fact that G.M.’s age had already\nbeen the subject of an enhancement, her allegations of\nmolestation standing alone are insufficient to establish\nvulnerability.9\n\n\n9\n  Though the district court adopted the findings in the PSR, the\nPSR states only that:\n     [S]ometime in late February, early March, G.M. confided\n     to the defendant that her father had inappropriately\n     touched her breast and her bottom when he was drunk.\n     Initially, Mr. Beith directed G.M. to tell her mother. In\n     reality, G.M. did not inform her mother. Approximately\n     a month later, in a meeting with G.M.’s mother regarding\n     tutoring, Beith brought up the topic of G.M.’s father\n     touching her. At that time, she was shocked to learn of the\n     allegation and she immediately confronted her husband.\n     G.M.’s mother indicates that she believes her daughter’s\n                                                      (continued...)\n\fNo. 03-2530                                                       19\n\n  Without a finding from the lower court that sufficient\nevidence exists to substantiate the allegations of molesta-\ntion, or that G.M. was suffering from severe emotional prob-\nlems, we are left with findings that G.M. was having family\nproblems and was seen cursing her father. Unfortunately,\nfamily discord is common among victims such as G.M. See\nUnited States v.

A finding of family problems,\ntherefore, is not sufficient to support this enhancement.\nAnd this is to say nothing of the impropriety of increasing\nBeith’s sentence based on facts neither jury proven nor\ndefendant admitted under the mandatory scheme that once\nwas the Guidelines. See Booker, 125 S. Ct. at 756. Accord-\ningly, and notwithstanding our distaste for the particular\nheinousness of his crime, we must vacate Beith’s sentence\nand remand this case for a determination of whether the\nrecord supports a finding that G.M. was in fact vulnerable.\n Having decided to vacate and remand Beith’s sentence,\nwe note that when the district court imposes its new sen-\n\n\n9\n    (...continued)\n       accusation but thinks her husband’s conduct was a result\n       of his drinking problem, and not that he touched her for\n       his own gratification.\nPSR at ¶ 14. However, it is clear from the court’s findings that it\ndid not find that the molestation actually occurred.\n\f20                                               No. 03-2530\n\ntence upon remand, it must do so in accord with Booker, as\nBooker decidedly governs all sentences imposed after its\ndate of decision. So if the district court again contemplates\nexercising its discretion to increase Beith’s sentence, it\nmust first concentrate its attention on the universe of sen-\ntencing factors and policy concerns memorialized by Justice\nBreyer’s remedial opinion (Booker, 125 S. Ct. at 764-66) and\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).\n\n\nD. Abduction Enhancement Was Not Appropriate\n  Beith also challenges the district court’s application of an\nabduction enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1(b)(5)\n(providing for a 4-level increase where the victim was ab-\nducted). The Guidelines define abduction as “forcing” a vic-\ntim to accompany an offender to a different location.\nU.S.S.G. § 1B1.1 app. note 1(a). This court equates abduc-\ntion to kidnaping, reasoning that physical force is not\nnecessary to kidnap or abduct. Romero, 189 F.3d at 590.\n“Inveigling,” or imposing one’s will through “trickery” or\n“gentle urging” or flattery, is a proper basis for applying the\nenhancement. Id.

Here, the\ndistrict court found that Beith abducted G.M. through the\nprocess of inveigling. To support its finding of inveigling,\nthe district court found that Beith: (1) spent a “considerable\namount of time with [G.M.]”; (2) gave her special privileges\nin school by allowing her to spend time in his office and giv-\ning her passes when she was late to class; (3) took G.M. to\nhis home on several occasions; (4) videotaped her; (5) had\ninappropriate conversations with her about him no longer\nbeing a virgin; (6) gave her a pendant and his watch; and,\n\fNo. 03-2530                                                21\n\n(7) told the victim he would commit suicide if she left him.\nAgain, assuming all penultimate facts were properly found,\nsee United States v. Booker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005), we review\nthe district court’s ultimate finding that Beith abducted\nG.M. for clear error. United States v. Vang, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"747770\"><a href=\"/opinion/747770/united-states-v-thong-vang-and-neng-vue/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1065</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1073 (7th Cir. 1997) (reviewing factual finding for clear\nerror).\n  Beith argues that his actions do not rise to the level of\n“inveigling” because he did not “deceive” or “trick” G.M. into\nleaving with him. He relies on Romero, in which this court\nfound abduction by inveigling where the defendant lied to\nthe victim about his identity over the Internet to gain the\nchild’s confidences and convince him to flee with the\ndefendant. While he argues that all the “abduction\nby inveigling” cases thus far have involved in some form a\ndeception, it does not necessarily follow that “inveigling”\nunder the Guidelines requires deceit or trickery.\n  Nonetheless, we find that the evidence could not support\na finding of “abduction by inveigling.” Recall that it was\nG.M. who called to warn Beith of the police’s intent to inter-\nview and possibly arrest him. The factual findings suggest\nthat Beith’s reprehensible actions were not so much con-\ncentrated toward imposing his will over G.M. in absconding\nto Las Vegas as they were motivated toward cultivating a\nsincere—albeit perverse and illegal—relationship. Indeed,\nhe made no false promises to her, and his overtures, while\nundeniably vile, were cloaked in neither deceit nor trickery.\nAt most, the findings upon which the district court based\nthe abduction enhancement suggest that Beith endeavored\nto develop G.M.’s trust—a trust that he would ultimately\nabuse. This behavior also merits punishment, and for it the\ndistrict court has already obliged by enhancing his sentence\npursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1(b)(3) (the enhancement based\non his custody and supervisory control over G.M. as her\n\f22                                                    No. 03-2530\n\nprincipal).10 But we find no tenable connection between the\nmanner in which Beith pursued G.M. in molesting her and\nhis ultimate act of driving her to Nevada that could justify\na finding of abduction. Accordingly, additional enhancement\nunder the rubric of “abduction by inveigling” is inappropri-\nate here, and thus provides another ground for vacating\nsentence and remand.\n  Furthermore, with the Supreme Court’s recent pro-\nnouncement in United States v. Booker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(2005), the district court’s basis for imposing the abduction\nenhancement has been compromised. Here, the district court\nerred both by increasing Beith’s sentence—via the obstruc-\ntion of justice enhancement—based on facts neither admitted\nby himself nor proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt,\nid. at 756 (holding that under the formerly mandatory\nGuidelines regime, “[a]ny fact (other than a prior convic-\ntion) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the\nmaximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of\nguilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or\nproved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt”), and through\nits mandatory application of the Guidelines in imposing his\nsentence, see id. at 757, 769 (remedying the Guidelines by\nrendering them “effectively advisory,” and allowing for\nresentencing notwithstanding the absence of a Sixth\nAmendment violation in a case where Guidelines\nmandatorily imposed); United States v.
