(collectively \"GMIT\").  GMIT brought suit\r\nagainst Patterson's predecessor in office seeking a declaration that GMIT had a valid lease\r\nfor offshore mariculture, or fish farming,<sup> (1)</sup> operations and alleging an unconstitutional taking. \r\n<em>See</em> Tex. Const. art. 1, § 17.  After a non-jury trial, the trial court declared that GMIT had\r\na valid lease for offshore mariculture operations and ordered that GMIT take nothing on\r\nits takings claim.  Both parties appealed the judgment of the trial court.  We affirm in part\r\nand reverse and render in part.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>I. Factual Background</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn August 27, 1986, Garry Mauro, then the Texas Land Commissioner, entered into\r\nSurface and Subsurface Lease No. 860161 (the \"1986 Lease\") with Tenneco Oil Company\r\nfor a tract of submerged land in the Gulf of Mexico located approximately ten miles\r\noffshore from Matagorda County, referred to as Tract 526L.<sup> (2)</sup>  The purpose of the 1986\r\nLease was for Tenneco to establish a platform from which they could directionally drill two\r\noil and gas wells into adjacent federally-owned submerged land.  Seagull E &amp; P, Inc.\r\n(\"Seagull\") was Tenneco's successor-in-interest to the 1986 Lease.  The second paragraph\r\nof the 1986 Lease provided that:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span></span><span>\tThe term of this lease shall be Fifty (50) years from the date of\r\nexecution of this instrument, or until the time at which the two (2) wells to be\r\ndrilled pursuant hereto shall have been plugged and abandoned in\r\naccordance with all applicable rules and regulations promulgated by oil and\r\ngas regulatory agencies having jurisdiction with respect thereto, if such\r\nplugging occurs sooner.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>\tBy the late 1990s, the wells drilled by Tenneco had been depleted, and Seagull was\r\nready to discontinue its oil and gas production operations that it had been conducting\r\npursuant to the 1986 Lease.  At the same time, GMIT, a non-profit research entity led by\r\nmanaging director John Ericsson, was attempting to acquire an offshore platform in the\r\nGulf of Mexico from which they could conduct mariculture research and commercial\r\noperations.  Ericsson determined that Tract 526L would be ideal for GMIT's purposes\r\nbecause of its water quality, its relative proximity to shore, and the fact that usable\r\nplatforms were already in place.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn September 18, 1998, Seagull and GMIT executed a \"Property Transfer\r\nAgreement\" under which Seagull agreed to transfer all of its rights, titles and interests in\r\nTract 526L under the 1986 Lease to GMIT.  Seagull also agreed to pay $1.3 million in cash\r\nto GMIT.  In exchange, GMIT agreed to assume all of Seagull's obligations under the 1986\r\nLease, including the eventual removal of all equipment and platforms from the leased\r\narea.<sup> (3)</sup>  The property transfer agreement also provided, in relevant part:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span></span><span>\tBuyer [GMIT] is a knowledgeable purchaser and has had the ability\r\nto evaluate the Assets for purchase and for their contemplated use following\r\nthe Closing.  Buyer acknowledges that the term of the Lease (as currently in\r\neffect) shall expire upon the plugging and abandonment of the Wells by\r\nSeller [Seagull].</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>\tPursuant to the property transfer agreement, Seagull and GMIT executed an\r\n\"Assignment and Assumption Agreement\" on September 19, 1998, which effectuated the\r\nassignment of the 1986 Lease from Seagull to GMIT.  The assignment and assumption\r\nagreement was approved by Commissioner Mauro and provided that GMIT assumed and\r\nagreed to perform the covenants, duties, and obligations required of the lessee under the\r\nterms of the 1986 Lease, but that Seagull would remain jointly and severally liable on those\r\nduties and covenants.  The assignment and assumption agreement also required that\r\nGMIT obtain a performance bond payable to Seagull to insure that GMIT would be\r\nfinancially responsible for removing the existing offshore platforms.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt the beginning of 1999, David Dewhurst succeeded Garry Mauro as Texas Land\r\nCommissioner.  Under the direction of Commissioner Dewhurst, the GLO became\r\nincreasingly skeptical about the financial viability of GMIT's mariculture project.  The GLO\r\nalso became wary about engaging in business with Ericsson, who had been embroiled in\r\nlegal troubles in four other states.  On May 12, 1999, the GLO sent a letter to Ericsson\r\ninforming him that they would not execute a new lease suitable for mariculture operations.<sup> (4)</sup> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn June 7, 1999, Ericsson wrote to Seagull acknowledging that Seagull had denied\r\nGMIT's request to postpone the plugging of the wells on Tract 526L until December 31,\r\n2000.  Ericsson indicated in the June 7 letter that, because Seagull had denied this\r\nrequest, GMIT would not allow Seagull access to the platform, as had been provided for\r\nunder the property transfer agreement.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNevertheless, the wells that were drilled pursuant to the 1986 Lease were finally\r\nplugged on July 9, 1999, as reflected in forms filed by Seagull with the Texas Railroad\r\nCommission Oil and Gas Division.  On April 25, 2000, the GLO sent a letter to Ericsson\r\nstating that the 1986 Lease had expired by its own terms and demanding that GMIT\r\nremove the platforms from Tract 526L.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>II. Procedural Background</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn May 12, 2000, GMIT filed its original petition against Commissioner Dewhurst\r\nseeking injunctive relief and a declaration that the 1986 Lease had not been terminated by\r\nthe plugging of the two wells in July 1999.  Rather, GMIT claimed that the GLO's approval\r\nof the assignment of the 1986 Lease to GMIT had given GMIT a valid lease to conduct\r\nmariculture operations on the State-owned land.  More specifically, GMIT asserted that the\r\nGLO had waived its right to enforce the termination provisions contained in the second\r\nparagraph of the 1986 Lease.  GMIT also alleged, in its original petition, that the decision\r\nby the GLO not to enter into a mariculture lease was an unconstitutional taking without\r\ncompensation,<sup> (5)</sup> a due process violation,<sup> (6)</sup> a denial of equal protection of the laws,<sup> (7)</sup> and a\r\nbreach of contract.  Commissioner Dewhurst filed a plea to the jurisdiction on June 5,\r\n2000, contending that GMIT's suit was barred by the doctrine of governmental immunity. \r\nThis was denied by order of the trial court on November 20, 2000.  Dewhurst subsequently\r\nfiled an interlocutory appeal challenging the trial court's denial of its plea to the jurisdiction. \r\nWe affirmed.  <em>See Dewhurst v. Gulf Marine Inst. of Tech.</em>, 55 S.W.3d 91 (Tex.\r\nApp.-Corpus Christi 2001, pet. denied).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><em>\t</em>In <em>Dewhurst</em>, taking all of GMIT's allegations as true,<sup> (8)</sup> we found that the terms of the\r\nassignment agreement were ambiguous because they called for an impossible condition\r\nas a test of performance:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span></span><span>\tThe provision regarding plugging and abandoning the wells conflicts\r\nwith the purpose of the assignment as intended by the parties, who knew the\r\nwells were plugged and abandoned by agreement as a condition to making\r\nthe assignment at the outset.  This conflict must be construed so as to\r\nrender the assignment valid and effective.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>55 S.W.3d at 97.<sup> (9)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe further determined that the GLO had implicitly waived its right to enforce the\r\ntermination provision of the 1986 Lease:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span></span><span>\t[B]ecause of the actions of Mauro and Dewhurst during and after the\r\nexecution of the assignment, the forfeiture provision was waived and the\r\nState is estopped from terminating the assignment/lease by virtue of the two\r\nwells having been plugged and abandoned. . . . Waiver by Mauro and\r\nDewhurst is implied from their conduct evidencing an intention not to insist\r\non compliance with the provisions of the original lease or inconsistent with\r\na determination to terminate the lease.<em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em></em></span><span><em></em></span><span><em></em></span><span>Id. at 99.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFrom this conclusion we reasoned that GMIT's allegations were sufficient to\r\nestablish that the GLO had acted beyond its lawful discretion in attempting to enforce the\r\ntermination provision of the 1986 Lease and therefore, governmental immunity was\r\ninapplicable.  <em>Id.</em> at 101 (\"In the absence of findings of fact, we must presume the trial court\r\nconsidered the facts alleged and the prayer for relief and determined the nature of GMIT's\r\nsuit to be for declaratory judgment that Dewhurst acted illegally or without authority and for\r\ninjunctive relief.\").</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGMIT subsequently filed a first amended original petition with the trial court, alleging\r\nits original five claims as well as three others:  (1) a claim of inverse condemnation under\r\narticle I, section 17 of the Texas Constitution and amendments V and VII to the United\r\nStates Constitution; (2) a Private Real Property Rights Preservation Act claim under\r\nchapter 2007 of the Texas Government Code; and (3) a claim for rescission of the\r\nagreements between the GLO, GMIT, and Seagull, as an alternative to their other seven\r\nclaims.<sup> (10)</sup>  At trial, GMIT abandoned all of its claims other than:  (1) its request for a\r\ndeclaratory judgment, (2) its claim for an unconstitutional taking under article I, section 17\r\nof the Texas Constitution, and (3) its request for attorney's fees.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter four days of non-jury trial, the trial court issued its final judgment on November\r\n15, 2005.<sup> (11)</sup>  The final judgment provided in relevant part that:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span></span><span>\tIt is ORDERED and the Court hereby declares that GMIT has a valid\r\ncontract for the use of the property that is the subject of this litigation,\r\nspecifically, those lands within Tract 526L and more fully described in that\r\nSurface and Subsurface Lease No. 860161 between [t]he State of Texas\r\nand Tenneco Oil Company and dated August 26, 1986, and that the valid\r\ncontract is for use of the subject property for a mariculture research facility\r\nand for related operations, and that the lease continues to in effect [sic] for\r\n50 years after August 26, 1986, or until GMIT ceases such mariculture\r\noperations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>\tIt is further ORDERED and the Court hereby declares that any\r\nforfeiture provision contained in Surface and Subsurface Lease No. 860161,\r\nor in any assignment agreement, assumption agreement or performance\r\nbond related thereto in favor of the State of Texas, cannot be enforced by\r\nPatterson or the State of Texas against GMIT, its successors or assigns, for\r\nthe duration of GMIT's use of the property for mariculture operations and\r\nrelated uses.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>\tIt is further ORDERED that GMIT take nothing on its claims against\r\nCommissioner for takings under Tex. Const. art. 1, § 17.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>\tIt is further ORDERED that GMIT shall have judgment against and\r\nrecover from the State of Texas its reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses\r\nin the amount of $222,732.00 on behalf of Douglas W. Poole of the firm\r\nMcLeod, Alexander, Powel &amp; Appfel, P.C.; $25,000 in favor of D.R. \"Tom\"\r\nUher, Attorney at Law, and $31,480.00 on behalf of Ronald B. Collins of the\r\nfirm Duckett, Bouligny &amp; Collins, L.L.P. for a total amount of $279,212.00,\r\nwith an additional $25,000 for appeal to the Court of Appeals, $25,000 for\r\nappeal, if any, to the Supreme Court of Texas.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>\tOn December 2, 2005, Patterson filed a request for findings of fact and conclusions\r\nof law.  On January 5, 2006, Patterson filed a notice of past due findings of fact and\r\nconclusions of law.  However, the trial court did not file any such findings or conclusions. \r\nBoth parties subsequently filed notices of appeal.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>III. Discussion</strong>\tPatterson alleges on appeal that:  (1) GMIT's declaratory judgment action was\r\nbarred by governmental immunity; (2) the trial court violated the Texas Constitution by\r\nextending property rights in Permanent School Fund (\"PSF\") land to a private party without\r\ncompensation; (3) there was no evidence to support the trial court's conclusion that a valid\r\nlease for mariculture operations existed; (4) the injunctive relief granted by the trial court\r\nwas not sufficiently clear and specific; (5) the trial court's failure to issue findings of fact\r\nand conclusions of law was harmful; and (6) the trial court abused its discretion in its award\r\nof attorney's fees to GMIT.  GMIT contends by cross-appeal that the trial court erred in (1)\r\ndenying GMIT's constitutional takings claim, and (2) reducing the amount of attorney's fees\r\nawarded to GMIT.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong></strong></span><span><strong>A. Governmental Immunity</strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBy his first issue, Patterson contends that GMIT's declaratory judgment action was\r\nbarred by governmental immunity.  It is well-established that governmental entities such\r\nas the GLO enjoy immunity from suit, unless the legislature has explicitly waived such\r\nimmunity.  <em>See, e.g., Tooke v. City of Mexia</em>, 197 S.W.3d 325, 332 (Tex. 2006); <em>City of\r\nWeslaco v. Borne</em>, 210 S.W.3d 782, 789 (Tex. App.-Corpus Christi 2006, pet. denied); <em>see\r\nalso</em> Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 311.034 (Vernon Supp. 2007) (\"In order to preserve the\r\nlegislature's interest in managing state fiscal matters through the appropriations process,\r\na statute shall not be construed as a waiver of sovereign immunity unless the waiver is\r\neffected by clear and unambiguous language.\").  Patterson, like Dewhurst, was sued solely\r\nin his official capacity as Commissioner of the GLO, and as such, is entitled to the same\r\nimmunity as that afforded to governmental entities themselves.  <em>Hidalgo County v.\r\nGonzales</em>, 128 S.W.3d 788, 793 (Tex. App.-Corpus Christi 2004, no pet.) (\"If [a]\r\ngovernmental unit would be immune due to sovereign immunity, so is the governmental\r\nofficial sued in his official capacity.\").</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe doctrine of governmental immunity has developed into two distinct forms:  (1)\r\nimmunity from suit, which bars suit against a governmental entity altogether in the absence\r\nof legislative consent; and (2) immunity from liability, which bars enforcement of a judgment\r\nagainst a governmental entity.  <em>Tooke</em>, 197 S.W.3d at 331.  Immunity from suit implicates\r\na court's subject-matter jurisdiction, whereas immunity from liability does not.  <em>Tex. Dep't\r\nof Transp. v. Jones</em>, 8 S.W.3d 636, 638 (Tex. 1999).  Therefore, we must note and review\r\nthe application of governmental immunity from suit at any time it appears.  <em>Fincher v. City\r\nof Texarkana</em>, 597 S.W.2d 22, 23 (Tex. Civ. App.-Texarkana 1980, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (stating\r\nthat a trial court's lack of subject-matter jurisdiction \"is fundamental error and must be\r\nnoted and reviewed by the appellate court at any time it appears.\")  Whether a trial court\r\nhas subject-matter jurisdiction is a question of law that we review de novo.  <em>Tex. Dep't of\r\nParks &amp; Wildlife v. Miranda</em>, 133 S.W.3d 217, 226 (Tex. 2004).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>1. Declaratory Judgments and Immunity</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn certain circumstances, the doctrine of governmental immunity is not applicable\r\nto requests for declaratory relief filed pursuant to the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act. \r\n<em>See </em>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. §§ 37.001-37.011 (Vernon Supp. 2007); <em>see also\r\nTex. Highway Comm'n v. Tex. Ass'n of Steel Importers, Inc.</em>, 372 S.W.2d 525, 530 (Tex.\r\n1963) (holding that legislative consent was not required for a declaratory judgment suit\r\nagainst the Highway Commission to determine the parties' rights); <em>Cobb v. Harrington</em>, 190\r\nS.W.2d 709, 712 (Tex. 1945) (holding that legislative consent was not required for\r\ndeclaratory judgment suit against the State Comptroller to determine the parties' rights\r\nunder a taxation statute).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Texas Supreme Court has held that private parties may seek declaratory relief\r\nagainst state officials who allegedly act without legal or statutory authority, without regard\r\nto governmental immunity.  <em>Tex. Natural Res. Conservation Comm'n v. IT-Davy</em>, 74 S.W.3d\r\n849, 855 (Tex. 2002). This type of declaratory judgment action simply seeks to compel\r\nstate officers to act within their official capacity and does not attempt to subject the State\r\nto liability, so immunity is not applicable.  <em>Id.</em>  On the other hand, declaratory judgment\r\nactions against state officials seeking to establish a contract's validity, to enforce\r\nperformance under a contract, or to impose contractual liabilities are considered suits\r\nagainst the State, and may not be imposed without explicit legislative permission.  <em>Id.</em>; <em>W.D.\r\nHaden Co. v. Dodgen</em>, 308 S.W. 2d 838, 840 (Tex. 1958) (citing <em>Herring v. Houston Nat'l\r\nExch. Bank</em>, 253 S.W. 813 (Tex. 1923)).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHere, the purpose of GMIT's request for declaratory relief is to establish the validity\r\nof what it claims to be a contract for mariculture operations on Tract 526L.  The limited\r\nexception to the doctrine of governmental immunity for certain declaratory judgment\r\nactions therefore does not apply in the instant case.  <em>See Dodgen</em>, 308 S.W.2d at 840.</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>2. Waiver by Conduct</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEven in the absence of a statute explicitly waiving immunity, suits against\r\ngovernmental entities are permitted where it is alleged that a state official violated state\r\nlaw.  <em>Dewhurst</em>, 55 S.W.3d at 96; <em>see Dir. of the Dep't of Agric. &amp; Env't v.

That\r\nis because a state official's illegal or unauthorized actions are not considered \"acts of the\r\nState.\"  <em>Dewhurst</em>, 55 S.W.3d at 96.  Moreover, one may challenge in court an action of a\r\nstate agency that exceeds the agency's jurisdiction or authority.  <em>See MAG-T, L.P. v. Travis\r\nCent. Appraisal Dist.</em>, 161 S.W.3d 617, 625 (Tex. App.-Austin 2005, pet. denied) (\"If a\r\nstate agency acts without authority and contrary to express statutes, the aggrieved party\r\nmay appeal directly to the courts.\"); <em>see also MHCB</em>, 2007 Tex. App. LEXIS 7669, at *26.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe relevant inquiry, therefore, is whether Dewhurst's attempt to enforce the\r\ntermination provision in the 1986 Lease amounted to an illegal act or an act beyond the\r\nscope of his authority.  If so, the GLO would have waived its governmental immunity by its\r\nown conduct.  <em>See Cobb</em>, 190 S.W.2d at 712; <em>MAG-T, L.P.</em>, 161 S.W.3d at 625.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn <em>Dewhurst</em>, we found that GMIT's pleadings were sufficient to establish that the\r\nGLO acted illegally and/or beyond its authority in attempting to enforce the termination\r\nprovision of the 1986 Lease and therefore, governmental immunity did not bar GMIT's suit. \r\n55 S.W.3d at 101 (\"In the absence of findings of fact, we must presume the trial court\r\nconsidered the facts alleged and the prayer for relief and determined the nature of GMIT's\r\nsuit to be for declaratory judgment that Dewhurst acted illegally or without authority and for\r\ninjunctive relief.\").</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHowever, in <em>Dewhurst</em> we were presented with an interlocutory appeal asking us to\r\nreview the trial court's denial of a plea to the jurisdiction on governmental immunity\r\ngrounds.  As such, we were required to take all allegations in GMIT's pleadings as true. \r\n<em>See Dewhurst</em>, 55 S.W.3d at 94; <em>City of San Antonio v. Butler</em>, 131 S.W.3d 170, 174 (Tex.\r\nApp.-San Antonio 2004, pet. denied).  One of GMIT's pleadings that we assumed to be\r\ntrue was that the wells drilled pursuant to the 1986 Lease were plugged on or before the\r\ntime that Mauro originally approved the assignment of the 1986 Lease.  Relying on this\r\nassumption, we found that:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span></span><span>\t[I]t would have been impossible for the parties to perform under the\r\nassignment/lease, if the contention of Dewhurst were accepted.  This theory\r\nwould place Mauro/Dewhurst in the position of making the contract, knowing\r\nthat the plugging and abandonment of the wells had occurred prior to or\r\nsimultaneously with the execution of the assignment.  It is unreasonable to\r\nview the facts in such manner as to find that Mauro/Dewhurst contracted with\r\nGMIT out of frivolous motives or with the intent to work a fraud.  This theory\r\nwould place the parties in the position of making the contract knowing that\r\nthe condition could not be met . . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span></span><span></span><span><em>Dewhurst</em>, 55 S.W.3d at 98.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHowever, the undisputed trial evidence revealed that the assignment agreement\r\nwas approved by Mauro on September 19, 1998, and that the wells were plugged on July\r\n9, 1999.  Thus, contrary to GMIT's pleadings, the plugging of the wells took place over nine\r\nmonths <em>after </em>the Commissioner approved the assignment of the 1986 Lease to GMIT.\r\nGiven these facts, it certainly was possible for the parties to perform under the assignment\r\nagreement and the lease--indeed, ample time remained for the parties to do so. \r\nTherefore, the terms of those instruments were not ambiguous.<sup> (12)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tViewed in this light, Mauro's approval of the assignment of the 1986 Lease to GMIT\r\nwas neither frivolous nor fraudulent.  GMIT still retained the responsibility to obtain a new\r\nlease suited to their unique proposed use of Tract 526L, and their awareness of this\r\nresponsibility was evidenced by their request on June 7, 1999, that Seagull postpone the\r\nplugging of the wells until such time as a new lease could be negotiated.  The negotiations\r\nsimply failed.  Still, the parties remained bound to the unambiguous terms of the 1986\r\nLease, including the provision providing for the termination of the lease upon the plugging\r\nand abandonment of the wells.  Accordingly, Dewhurst's decision to enforce the\r\ntermination provision of the 1986 Lease was a lawful exercise of his statutory authority in\r\ndeciding how and to whom state-owned land may be leased.<sup> (13)</sup></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>B. Law of the Case Doctrine and <em>Dewhurst</em></strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGMIT claims that Patterson is now merely \"attempting to do nothing more than\r\nreargue this Court's prior denial of [Dewhurst's] plea to the jurisdiction,\" and that we must\r\ntherefore reach the same conclusion as we did in <em>Dewhurst</em>.  We disagree.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tUnder the law of the case doctrine, a court of appeals is generally bound by its initial\r\ndecision if there is a subsequent appeal in the same case.  <em>Briscoe v. Goodman Corp.</em>, 102\r\nS.W.3d 714, 716 (Tex. 2003).  The doctrine is defined as that principle under which\r\nquestions of law decided on appeal to a court of last resort will govern the case throughout\r\nits subsequent stages.  <em>Hudson v. Wakefield</em>, 711 S.W.2d 628, 630 (Tex. 1986); <em>see also\r\nBFI Waste Sys. of N. Am., Inc. v. N. Alamo Water Supply Corp.</em>, No. 13-04-00069-CV,\r\n2006 Tex. App. LEXIS 3007, at *7 (Tex. App.-Corpus Christi Apr. 13, 2006, pet. denied)\r\n(mem. op., not designated for publication).  However, a decision rendered on an issue\r\nbefore the appellate court does not absolutely bar re-consideration of the same issue on\r\na second appeal.  <em>Briscoe</em>, 102 S.W.3d at 716 (citing <em>Kempner v. Huddleston</em>, 37 S.W.\r\n1066, 1066-67 (Tex. 1896)).  Application of the doctrine lies within the discretion of the\r\ncourt, depending on the particular circumstances surrounding that case.  <em>Id.</em>; <em>see also BFI\r\nWaste Sys.</em>, 2006 Tex. App. LEXIS 3007, at *7.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe instant case is a prime example of why the law of the case doctrine cannot\r\nalways apply.  First, a key fact that we assumed in <em>Dewhurst</em> was disproved at trial: \r\nnamely, that the plugging of wells occurred before or simultaneously to the assignment of\r\nthe 1986 Lease.  GMIT argues that this Court \"did not rely upon the plugging date in\r\nfashioning its opinion\" in <em>Dewhurst</em>.  This is incorrect.  We relied heavily on that assumption\r\nin concluding that the assignment was ambiguous and that the GLO had waived its right\r\nto enforce the termination provision of the 1986 Lease.<sup> (14)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAlthough we were bound to assume GMIT's pleadings as true in <em>Dewhurst</em>, we are\r\nnot similarly bound here.  Instead, we have the benefit of a record that includes four days\r\nof trial testimony in which certain facts were conclusively established, including the date\r\nthat the wells were plugged.  After reviewing the record, we conclude that the GLO did not\r\nwaive its right to enforce the termination provision of the 1986 Lease.  Therefore, the 1986\r\nLease unambiguously terminated by its own terms on July 9, 1999, upon the plugging of\r\nthe wells on Tract 526L.  It is of no consequence that Mauro believed GMIT had done\r\nenough to ensure they could continue with the mariculture project, nor even that Mauro\r\nwould have declined to enforce the termination provision were he still in office.  Indeed,\r\none of the fundamental reasons why immunity exists is to prevent governmental entities\r\nfrom being bound by the policy decisions of their predecessors.  <em>Catalina Dev., Inc. v.\r\nCounty of El Paso</em>, 121 S.W.3d 704, 706 (Tex. 2003); <em>see IT-Davy</em>, 74 S.W.3d at 854\r\n(stating that \"legislative control ensures that current policymakers are neither bound by, nor\r\nheld accountable for, policies underlying their predecessors' long-term contracts.\").</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSecond, the law regarding waiver of immunity by the State's conduct has changed\r\nsignificantly since we decided <em>Dewhurst</em>.  In <em>Fed. Sign v. Tex. State Univ.</em>, the Texas\r\nSupreme Court suggested in a footnote that there may be circumstances \"where the State\r\nmay waive its immunity by conduct other than [by] simply executing a contract.\"  951\r\nS.W.2d 401, 408 n.1 (Tex. 1997).  But since then, the supreme court has consistently\r\ndeclined to fashion a waiver-by-conduct exception to the doctrine of governmental\r\nimmunity.  <em>See IT-Davy</em>, 74 S.W.3d at 857 (\"Creating a waiver-by-conduct exception would\r\nforce the State to expend its resources to litigate the waiver-by-conduct issue before\r\nenjoying sovereign immunity's protections--and this would defeat many of the doctrine's\r\nunderlying policies.\"); <em>Gen. Serv. Comm'n v. Little-Tex Insulation Co.</em>, 39 S.W.3d 591, 595\r\n(Tex. 2001) (\"Historically, we have left to the Legislature whether to waive sovereign\r\nimmunity . . . [t]oday we once again adhere to this principle and defer to the Legislature.\");\r\n<em>see also Catalina Dev., Inc.</em>, 121 S.W.3d at 705-07 (finding that El Paso County's conduct\r\nin refusing to sign property over to Catalina, despite Catalina's bid for the property being\r\npreviously approved by the county, did not waive immunity because \"the County was under\r\nno statutory obligation either to accept any potential bids or to complete a transaction if it\r\ndid decide to accept a bid.\").</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTo hold that the GLO's conduct implicitly waived its right to enforce the termination\r\nprovision of the 1986 Lease--and therefore that the GLO waived its immunity when it\r\nsought to enforce that provision--would be to create the conduct-based exception to\r\ngovernmental immunity that the supreme court has consistently declined to fashion.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tConsequently, we conclude that Dewhurst was well within his discretion, and did not\r\nviolate the law, when he demanded that GMIT forfeit its rights to Tract 526L upon the\r\ntermination of the 1986 Lease by its own terms.  As such, the doctrine of governmental\r\nimmunity bars GMIT's suit seeking a declaration to the contrary.  Accordingly, we sustain\r\nPatterson's first issue.<strong></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>C. GMIT's Takings Claim</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGMIT asserts by cross-appeal that the trial court erred in denying GMIT's claims\r\nmade pursuant to article I, section 17 of the Texas Constitution.  We disagree.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tArticle I, section 17 of the Texas Constitution prohibits the State from taking a\r\nperson's property under its sovereign powers without adequate compensation unless by\r\nsuch person's consent. <em> </em>Tex. Const. art. I, § 17; <em>see Little-Tex</em>, 39 S.W.3d at 598.  To\r\nestablish a claim under this provision, GMIT must prove (1) the State intentionally\r\nperformed certain acts, (2) that resulted in a \"taking\" of property, (3) for public use.  <em>Steele\r\nv. City of Houston</em>, 603 S.W.2d 786, 788-92 (Tex. 1980).  Although we have concluded that\r\nthe doctrine of governmental immunity bars GMIT's declaratory judgment action, the\r\ndoctrine does not shield Patterson from an action for compensation under the takings\r\nclause.  <em>See Little-Tex</em>, 39 S.W.3d at 598; <em>Steele</em>, 603 S.W.2d at 791.  Whether particular\r\nfacts are enough to constitute a taking is a question of law.  <em>See Little-Tex</em>, 39 S.W.3d at\r\n598; <em>Mayhew v. Town of Sunnyvale</em>, 964 S.W.2d 922, 936 (Tex. 1998).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGMIT contends that Dewhurst's termination of the 1986 Lease deprived GMIT of its\r\nlegal right to use Tract 526L.  However, the State does not have the requisite intent under\r\nconstitutional-takings jurisprudence when it merely withholds property or money from an\r\nentity in a contract dispute.  <em>See Little-Tex</em>, 39 S.W.3d at 598-99.  In such a situation, the\r\nState does not have the intent to take under its eminent domain powers; rather, it only has\r\nan intent to act within the scope of the contract.  <em>Green Int'l Co. v. State</em>, 877 S.W.2d 428,\r\n434 (Tex. App.-Austin 1994, writ dism'd).  In other words, when the State acts within a\r\ncolor of right to withhold property under a contract, it is acting akin to a private citizen and\r\nnot under any sovereign powers, and so a takings claim does not lie.  <em>See Little-Tex</em>, 39\r\nS.W.3d at 599.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGMIT relies on <em>Tex. Parks &amp; Wildlife Dep't v. Callaway</em>, 971 S.W.2d 145 (Tex.\r\nApp.-Austin 1998, no pet.) to support its argument that the GLO's actions constituted a\r\ncompensable taking.  In <em>Callaway</em>, the Austin court of appeals ruled that a governmental\r\nagency's violations of both contractual <em>and </em>extracontractual duties constituted a valid basis\r\nfor a claim under article I, section 17.  <em>Id.</em> at 151.  However, the court was very clear in\r\ndistinguishing the factual situation in <em>Callaway</em> from cases where \"the state's duty to pay\r\nor perform arose <em>solely</em> from its contract with the private party.\"  <em>Id. </em>at 150 (emphasis in\r\noriginal).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the instant case, the GLO's duties with respect to Tract 526L arose entirely out\r\nof its execution of the 1986 Lease.  Once the 1986 Lease terminated by its own terms, the\r\nState owed no additional extracontractual duties to GMIT.  Thus, the GLO lacked the\r\nrequisite intent to form the basis of a valid takings claim.  Therefore, we conclude that the\r\ntrial court did not err in denying GMIT's constitutional takings claim.  Accordingly, we\r\noverrule GMIT's first issue on cross-appeal.<strong></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>D. Attorney's Fees</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tPatterson asserts by his sixth issue on appeal that the trial court erred in awarding\r\nattorney's fees that were not segregated by claim or defendant and were unsupported by\r\nthe evidence, and in awarding appellate attorney's fees that were based on conclusory\r\naffidavit testimony and unconditioned on the successful defense of the judgment upon\r\nappeal.  GMIT asserts by its second issue on cross-appeal that the trial court erred in\r\nawarding attorney's fees in an amount less than that requested by GMIT.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act permits a trial court to award reasonable\r\nand necessary attorney's fees as are equitable and just.  Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §\r\n37.009.  However, in light of our conclusion that governmental immunity bars GMIT's\r\ndeclaratory judgment action, the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act is not applicable, and\r\ntherefore there is no basis for the award of attorney's fees.  <em>See In re Sw. Bell Tel. Co.,\r\nL.P.</em>, 235 S.W.3d 619, 626 (Tex. 2007) (noting that \"[a]lthough the Texas [Declaratory\r\nJudgment Act] expressly provides for attorney's fees, it functions solely as a procedural\r\nmechanism for resolving substantive controversies which are already within the jurisdiction\r\nof the courts\") (quoting <em>Utica Lloyd's of Tex. v. Mitchell</em>, 138 F.3d 208, 210 (5th Cir. 1998)). \r\nAccordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court awarding attorney's fees to GMIT\r\nand we sustain Patterson's sixth issue.<sup> (15)</sup><strong></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>IV.

Mariculture is more precisely defined as \"the cultivation of marine organisms in their natural\r\nenvironment.\"  Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (10th ed. 1996).\r\n</p><p>2.  Tract 526L is owned by the State of Texas and has been dedicated to the Permanent School Fund\r\n(\"PSF\").  The PSF is a mechanism created pursuant to the Texas Constitution in order to provide funding for\r\nthe state's public schools, and proceeds from the sale of PSF land are invested for that purpose.  <em>See</em> Tex.\r\nConst. art. VII, §§ 2, 4.  The Commissioner of the General Land Office (\"GLO\") may enter into leases of PSF\r\nland for \"any purpose the commissioner determines is in the best interest of the state under terms and\r\nconditions set by the commissioner.\"  Tex. Nat. Res. Code Ann. §§ 51.012 &amp; 51.121 (Vernon Supp. 2006).\r\n</p><p>3.  Under rules promulgated by the GLO, a lessee of submerged PSF land such as Tract 526L must\r\n\"remove all equipment, structures, machinery, tools, supplies, and other items on the [leased] property and\r\notherwise restore the property to the condition it was in immediately preceding issuance of th[e] lease\" within\r\n120 days of the discontinuance of the lease.  31 Tex. Admin. Code § 9.91(c)(5)(C) (1999).\r\n</p><p>4.  GMIT claims that the GLO \"terminated\" the lease at this point, but the record does not reflect this\r\ninterpretation of events.  Rather, at this time, the GLO merely announced its determination that it would\r\ndecline to execute a new lease suited to use of Tract 526L for mariculture purposes.  There is no indication\r\nthat the GLO ever purported to \"terminate\" the 1986 Lease prior to the time it expired by its own terms.\r\n</p><p>5. <em> See</em> Tex. Const. art. I, § 17.\r\n</p><p>6. <em> See</em> Tex. Const. art. I, § 19.\r\n</p><p>7. <em> See</em> Tex. Const. art.

Both GMIT's original petition and its first amended original petition named Seagull as a defendant,\r\nin addition to the Land Commissioner.  However, GMIT non-suited Seagull four days prior to the\r\ncommencement of trial.  Seagull is not a party to this appeal.\r\n</p><p>11.  The trial court first issued an interlocutory judgment on August 4, 2005, on all issues raised at trial\r\nother than the parties' claims for attorney's fees.  The November 15, 2005 judgment, which is the judgment\r\nthat is appealed here, incorporated all of the rulings announced in the August 4, 2005, judgment and also\r\nincluded rulings on attorney's fees.\r\n</p><p>12. <em> Cf.

Nat. Res. Code Ann. § 51.121 (Vernon Supp. 2006).\r\n</p><p>14. In <em>Dewhurst</em>, we repeatedly referred to the assumed fact that the wells had been plugged prior to\r\nor simultaneously with the assignment of the lease:</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>The provision regarding plugging and abandoning the wells conflicts with the purpose of the\r\nassignment as intended by the parties, who knew the wells were plugged and abandoned by\r\nthe agreement as a condition to making the assignment at the outset. . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>To construe the assignment so as to terminate it before it commenced, that is, upon plugging\r\nand abandonment of the wells, would be unreasonable, oppressive and ridiculous. . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>[I]t would have been impossible for the parties to perform under the assignment/lease, if the\r\ncontention of Dewhurst were accepted.  This theory would place Mauro/Dewhurst in the\r\nposition of making the contract, knowing that the plugging and abandonment of the wells had\r\noccurred prior to or simultaneously with the execution of the assignment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>55 S.W.3d at 97-98.\r\n<p>15.  Because of our conclusion with regard to attorney's fees, we need not address Patterson's\r\narguments regarding the segregation of the attorney's fees award or the unconditional nature of the award\r\nof appellate attorney's fees.  Though we do not reach the issue, we note that it is well-settled that a trial court\r\nmay not grant an unconditional award of appellate attorney's fees, because to do so would penalize a party\r\nfor pursuing a meritorious appeal.  <em>Pickett v.

(collectively \"GMIT\").  GMIT brought suit\r\nagainst Patterson's predecessor in office seeking a declaration that GMIT had a valid lease\r\nfor offshore mariculture, or fish farming,<sup> (1)</sup> operations and alleging an unconstitutional taking. \r\n<em>See</em> Tex. Const. art. 1, § 17.  After a non-jury trial, the trial court declared that GMIT had\r\na valid lease for offshore mariculture operations and ordered that GMIT take nothing on\r\nits takings claim.  Both parties appealed the judgment of the trial court.  We affirm in part\r\nand reverse and render in part.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>I. Factual Background</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn August 27, 1986, Garry Mauro, then the Texas Land Commissioner, entered into\r\nSurface and Subsurface Lease No. 860161 (the \"1986 Lease\") with Tenneco Oil Company\r\nfor a tract of submerged land in the Gulf of Mexico located approximately ten miles\r\noffshore from Matagorda County, referred to as Tract 526L.<sup> (2)</sup>  The purpose of the 1986\r\nLease was for Tenneco to establish a platform from which they could directionally drill two\r\noil and gas wells into adjacent federally-owned submerged land.  Seagull E &amp; P, Inc.\r\n(\"Seagull\") was Tenneco's successor-in-interest to the 1986 Lease.  The second paragraph\r\nof the 1986 Lease provided that:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span></span><span>\tThe term of this lease shall be Fifty (50) years from the date of\r\nexecution of this instrument, or until the time at which the two (2) wells to be\r\ndrilled pursuant hereto shall have been plugged and abandoned in\r\naccordance with all applicable rules and regulations promulgated by oil and\r\ngas regulatory agencies having jurisdiction with respect thereto, if such\r\nplugging occurs sooner.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>\tBy the late 1990s, the wells drilled by Tenneco had been depleted, and Seagull was\r\nready to discontinue its oil and gas production operations that it had been conducting\r\npursuant to the 1986 Lease.  At the same time, GMIT, a non-profit research entity led by\r\nmanaging director John Ericsson, was attempting to acquire an offshore platform in the\r\nGulf of Mexico from which they could conduct mariculture research and commercial\r\noperations.  Ericsson determined that Tract 526L would be ideal for GMIT's purposes\r\nbecause of its water quality, its relative proximity to shore, and the fact that usable\r\nplatforms were already in place.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn September 18, 1998, Seagull and GMIT executed a \"Property Transfer\r\nAgreement\" under which Seagull agreed to transfer all of its rights, titles and interests in\r\nTract 526L under the 1986 Lease to GMIT.  Seagull also agreed to pay $1.3 million in cash\r\nto GMIT.  In exchange, GMIT agreed to assume all of Seagull's obligations under the 1986\r\nLease, including the eventual removal of all equipment and platforms from the leased\r\narea.<sup> (3)</sup>  The property transfer agreement also provided, in relevant part:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span></span><span>\tBuyer [GMIT] is a knowledgeable purchaser and has had the ability\r\nto evaluate the Assets for purchase and for their contemplated use following\r\nthe Closing.  Buyer acknowledges that the term of the Lease (as currently in\r\neffect) shall expire upon the plugging and abandonment of the Wells by\r\nSeller [Seagull].</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>\tPursuant to the property transfer agreement, Seagull and GMIT executed an\r\n\"Assignment and Assumption Agreement\" on September 19, 1998, which effectuated the\r\nassignment of the 1986 Lease from Seagull to GMIT.  The assignment and assumption\r\nagreement was approved by Commissioner Mauro and provided that GMIT assumed and\r\nagreed to perform the covenants, duties, and obligations required of the lessee under the\r\nterms of the 1986 Lease, but that Seagull would remain jointly and severally liable on those\r\nduties and covenants.  The assignment and assumption agreement also required that\r\nGMIT obtain a performance bond payable to Seagull to insure that GMIT would be\r\nfinancially responsible for removing the existing offshore platforms.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt the beginning of 1999, David Dewhurst succeeded Garry Mauro as Texas Land\r\nCommissioner.  Under the direction of Commissioner Dewhurst, the GLO became\r\nincreasingly skeptical about the financial viability of GMIT's mariculture project.  The GLO\r\nalso became wary about engaging in business with Ericsson, who had been embroiled in\r\nlegal troubles in four other states.  On May 12, 1999, the GLO sent a letter to Ericsson\r\ninforming him that they would not execute a new lease suitable for mariculture operations.<sup> (4)</sup> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn June 7, 1999, Ericsson wrote to Seagull acknowledging that Seagull had denied\r\nGMIT's request to postpone the plugging of the wells on Tract 526L until December 31,\r\n2000.  Ericsson indicated in the June 7 letter that, because Seagull had denied this\r\nrequest, GMIT would not allow Seagull access to the platform, as had been provided for\r\nunder the property transfer agreement.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNevertheless, the wells that were drilled pursuant to the 1986 Lease were finally\r\nplugged on July 9, 1999, as reflected in forms filed by Seagull with the Texas Railroad\r\nCommission Oil and Gas Division.  On April 25, 2000, the GLO sent a letter to Ericsson\r\nstating that the 1986 Lease had expired by its own terms and demanding that GMIT\r\nremove the platforms from Tract 526L.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>II. Procedural Background</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn May 12, 2000, GMIT filed its original petition against Commissioner Dewhurst\r\nseeking injunctive relief and a declaration that the 1986 Lease had not been terminated by\r\nthe plugging of the two wells in July 1999.  Rather, GMIT claimed that the GLO's approval\r\nof the assignment of the 1986 Lease to GMIT had given GMIT a valid lease to conduct\r\nmariculture operations on the State-owned land.  More specifically, GMIT asserted that the\r\nGLO had waived its right to enforce the termination provisions contained in the second\r\nparagraph of the 1986 Lease.  GMIT also alleged, in its original petition, that the decision\r\nby the GLO not to enter into a mariculture lease was an unconstitutional taking without\r\ncompensation,<sup> (5)</sup> a due process violation,<sup> (6)</sup> a denial of equal protection of the laws,<sup> (7)</sup> and a\r\nbreach of contract.  Commissioner Dewhurst filed a plea to the jurisdiction on June 5,\r\n2000, contending that GMIT's suit was barred by the doctrine of governmental immunity. \r\nThis was denied by order of the trial court on November 20, 2000.  Dewhurst subsequently\r\nfiled an interlocutory appeal challenging the trial court's denial of its plea to the jurisdiction. \r\nWe affirmed.  <em>See Dewhurst v. Gulf Marine Inst. of Tech.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2336151\"><a href=\"/opinion/2336151/dewhurst-v-gulf-marine-institute-of-tech/\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></a></span> (Tex.\r\nApp.-Corpus Christi 2001, pet. denied).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><em>\t</em>In <em>Dewhurst</em>, taking all of GMIT's allegations as true,<sup> (8)</sup> we found that the terms of the\r\nassignment agreement were ambiguous because they called for an impossible condition\r\nas a test of performance:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span></span><span>\tThe provision regarding plugging and abandoning the wells conflicts\r\nwith the purpose of the assignment as intended by the parties, who knew the\r\nwells were plugged and abandoned by agreement as a condition to making\r\nthe assignment at the outset.

Waiver by Mauro and\r\nDewhurst is implied from their conduct evidencing an intention not to insist\r\non compliance with the provisions of the original lease or inconsistent with\r\na determination to terminate the lease.<em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em></em></span><span><em></em></span><span><em></em></span><span>Id. at 99.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFrom this conclusion we reasoned that GMIT's allegations were sufficient to\r\nestablish that the GLO had acted beyond its lawful discretion in attempting to enforce the\r\ntermination provision of the 1986 Lease and therefore, governmental immunity was\r\ninapplicable.  <em>Id.</em> at 101 (\"In the absence of findings of fact, we must presume the trial court\r\nconsidered the facts alleged and the prayer for relief and determined the nature of GMIT's\r\nsuit to be for declaratory judgment that Dewhurst acted illegally or without authority and for\r\ninjunctive relief.\").</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGMIT subsequently filed a first amended original petition with the trial court, alleging\r\nits original five claims as well as three others:  (1) a claim of inverse condemnation under\r\narticle I, section 17 of the Texas Constitution and amendments V and VII to the United\r\nStates Constitution; (2) a Private Real Property Rights Preservation Act claim under\r\nchapter 2007 of the Texas Government Code; and (3) a claim for rescission of the\r\nagreements between the GLO, GMIT, and Seagull, as an alternative to their other seven\r\nclaims.<sup> (10)</sup>  At trial, GMIT abandoned all of its claims other than:  (1) its request for a\r\ndeclaratory judgment, (2) its claim for an unconstitutional taking under article I, section 17\r\nof the Texas Constitution, and (3) its request for attorney's fees.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter four days of non-jury trial, the trial court issued its final judgment on November\r\n15, 2005.<sup> (11)</sup>  The final judgment provided in relevant part that:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span></span><span>\tIt is ORDERED and the Court hereby declares that GMIT has a valid\r\ncontract for the use of the property that is the subject of this litigation,\r\nspecifically, those lands within Tract 526L and more fully described in that\r\nSurface and Subsurface Lease No. 860161 between [t]he State of Texas\r\nand Tenneco Oil Company and dated August 26, 1986, and that the valid\r\ncontract is for use of the subject property for a mariculture research facility\r\nand for related operations, and that the lease continues to in effect [sic] for\r\n50 years after August 26, 1986, or until GMIT ceases such mariculture\r\noperations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>\tIt is further ORDERED and the Court hereby declares that any\r\nforfeiture provision contained in Surface and Subsurface Lease No. 860161,\r\nor in any assignment agreement, assumption agreement or performance\r\nbond related thereto in favor of the State of Texas, cannot be enforced by\r\nPatterson or the State of Texas against GMIT, its successors or assigns, for\r\nthe duration of GMIT's use of the property for mariculture operations and\r\nrelated uses.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>\tIt is further ORDERED that GMIT take nothing on its claims against\r\nCommissioner for takings under Tex.

On January 5, 2006, Patterson filed a notice of past due findings of fact and\r\nconclusions of law.  However, the trial court did not file any such findings or conclusions. \r\nBoth parties subsequently filed notices of appeal.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>III. Discussion</strong>\tPatterson alleges on appeal that:  (1) GMIT's declaratory judgment action was\r\nbarred by governmental immunity; (2) the trial court violated the Texas Constitution by\r\nextending property rights in Permanent School Fund (\"PSF\") land to a private party without\r\ncompensation; (3) there was no evidence to support the trial court's conclusion that a valid\r\nlease for mariculture operations existed; (4) the injunctive relief granted by the trial court\r\nwas not sufficiently clear and specific; (5) the trial court's failure to issue findings of fact\r\nand conclusions of law was harmful; and (6) the trial court abused its discretion in its award\r\nof attorney's fees to GMIT.  GMIT contends by cross-appeal that the trial court erred in (1)\r\ndenying GMIT's constitutional takings claim, and (2) reducing the amount of attorney's fees\r\nawarded to GMIT.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong></strong></span><span><strong>A. Governmental Immunity</strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBy his first issue, Patterson contends that GMIT's declaratory judgment action was\r\nbarred by governmental immunity.  It is well-established that governmental entities such\r\nas the GLO enjoy immunity from suit, unless the legislature has explicitly waived such\r\nimmunity.  <em>See, e.g., Tooke v. City of Mexia</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1400009\"><a href=\"/opinion/1400009/tooke-v-city-of-mexia/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span>, 332 (Tex. 2006); <em>City of\r\nWeslaco v.

Gov't Code Ann. § 311.034 (Vernon Supp. 2007) (\"In order to preserve the\r\nlegislature's interest in managing state fiscal matters through the appropriations process,\r\na statute shall not be construed as a waiver of sovereign immunity unless the waiver is\r\neffected by clear and unambiguous language.\").  Patterson, like Dewhurst, was sued solely\r\nin his official capacity as Commissioner of the GLO, and as such, is entitled to the same\r\nimmunity as that afforded to governmental entities themselves.  <em>Hidalgo County v.\r\nGonzales</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2003420\"><a href=\"/opinion/2003420/hidalgo-county-v-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">788</span></a></span>, 793 (Tex. App.-Corpus Christi 2004, no pet.) (\"If [a]\r\ngovernmental unit would be immune due to sovereign immunity, so is the governmental\r\nofficial sued in his official capacity.\").</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe doctrine of governmental immunity has developed into two distinct forms:  (1)\r\nimmunity from suit, which bars suit against a governmental entity altogether in the absence\r\nof legislative consent; and (2) immunity from liability, which bars enforcement of a judgment\r\nagainst a governmental entity.  <em>Tooke</em>, 197 S.W.3d at 331.  Immunity from suit implicates\r\na court's subject-matter jurisdiction, whereas immunity from liability does not.  <em>Tex. Dep't\r\nof Transp. v.

Therefore, we must note and review\r\nthe application of governmental immunity from suit at any time it appears.  <em>Fincher v.

(stating\r\nthat a trial court's lack of subject-matter jurisdiction \"is fundamental error and must be\r\nnoted and reviewed by the appellate court at any time it appears.\")  Whether a trial court\r\nhas subject-matter jurisdiction is a question of law that we review de novo.  <em>Tex.

This type of declaratory judgment action simply seeks to compel\r\nstate officers to act within their official capacity and does not attempt to subject the State\r\nto liability, so immunity is not applicable.  <em>Id.</em>  On the other hand, declaratory judgment\r\nactions against state officials seeking to establish a contract's validity, to enforce\r\nperformance under a contract, or to impose contractual liabilities are considered suits\r\nagainst the State, and may not be imposed without explicit legislative permission.  <em>Id.</em>; <em>W.D.\r\nHaden Co. v.

App. LEXIS 7669, at *26.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe relevant inquiry, therefore, is whether Dewhurst's attempt to enforce the\r\ntermination provision in the 1986 Lease amounted to an illegal act or an act beyond the\r\nscope of his authority.  If so, the GLO would have waived its governmental immunity by its\r\nown conduct.  <em>See Cobb</em>, 190 S.W.2d at 712; <em>MAG-T, L.P.</em>, 161 S.W.3d at 625.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn <em>Dewhurst</em>, we found that GMIT's pleadings were sufficient to establish that the\r\nGLO acted illegally and/or beyond its authority in attempting to enforce the termination\r\nprovision of the 1986 Lease and therefore, governmental immunity did not bar GMIT's suit. \r\n55 S.W.3d at 101 (\"In the absence of findings of fact, we must presume the trial court\r\nconsidered the facts alleged and the prayer for relief and determined the nature of GMIT's\r\nsuit to be for declaratory judgment that Dewhurst acted illegally or without authority and for\r\ninjunctive relief.\").</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHowever, in <em>Dewhurst</em> we were presented with an interlocutory appeal asking us to\r\nreview the trial court's denial of a plea to the jurisdiction on governmental immunity\r\ngrounds.  As such, we were required to take all allegations in GMIT's pleadings as true. \r\n<em>See Dewhurst</em>, 55 S.W.3d at 94; <em>City of San Antonio v. Butler</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1880111\"><a href=\"/opinion/1880111/city-of-san-antonio-v-butler/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">170</span></a></span>, 174 (Tex.\r\nApp.-San Antonio 2004, pet. denied).  One of GMIT's pleadings that we assumed to be\r\ntrue was that the wells drilled pursuant to the 1986 Lease were plugged on or before the\r\ntime that Mauro originally approved the assignment of the 1986 Lease.  Relying on this\r\nassumption, we found that:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span></span><span>\t[I]t would have been impossible for the parties to perform under the\r\nassignment/lease, if the contention of Dewhurst were accepted.  This theory\r\nwould place Mauro/Dewhurst in the position of making the contract, knowing\r\nthat the plugging and abandonment of the wells had occurred prior to or\r\nsimultaneously with the execution of the assignment.  It is unreasonable to\r\nview the facts in such manner as to find that Mauro/Dewhurst contracted with\r\nGMIT out of frivolous motives or with the intent to work a fraud.  This theory\r\nwould place the parties in the position of making the contract knowing that\r\nthe condition could not be met . . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span></span><span></span><span><em>Dewhurst</em>, 55 S.W.3d at 98.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHowever, the undisputed trial evidence revealed that the assignment agreement\r\nwas approved by Mauro on September 19, 1998, and that the wells were plugged on July\r\n9, 1999.  Thus, contrary to GMIT's pleadings, the plugging of the wells took place over nine\r\nmonths <em>after </em>the Commissioner approved the assignment of the 1986 Lease to GMIT.\r\nGiven these facts, it certainly was possible for the parties to perform under the assignment\r\nagreement and the lease--indeed, ample time remained for the parties to do so. \r\nTherefore, the terms of those instruments were not ambiguous.<sup> (12)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tViewed in this light, Mauro's approval of the assignment of the 1986 Lease to GMIT\r\nwas neither frivolous nor fraudulent.  GMIT still retained the responsibility to obtain a new\r\nlease suited to their unique proposed use of Tract 526L, and their awareness of this\r\nresponsibility was evidenced by their request on June 7, 1999, that Seagull postpone the\r\nplugging of the wells until such time as a new lease could be negotiated.  The negotiations\r\nsimply failed.  Still, the parties remained bound to the unambiguous terms of the 1986\r\nLease, including the provision providing for the termination of the lease upon the plugging\r\nand abandonment of the wells.  Accordingly, Dewhurst's decision to enforce the\r\ntermination provision of the 1986 Lease was a lawful exercise of his statutory authority in\r\ndeciding how and to whom state-owned land may be leased.<sup> (13)</sup></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>B. Law of the Case Doctrine and <em>Dewhurst</em></strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGMIT claims that Patterson is now merely \"attempting to do nothing more than\r\nreargue this Court's prior denial of [Dewhurst's] plea to the jurisdiction,\" and that we must\r\ntherefore reach the same conclusion as we did in <em>Dewhurst</em>.  We disagree.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tUnder the law of the case doctrine, a court of appeals is generally bound by its initial\r\ndecision if there is a subsequent appeal in the same case.  <em>Briscoe v. Goodman Corp.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1370803\"><a href=\"/opinion/1370803/briscoe-v-goodmark-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">714</span></a></span>, 716 (Tex. 2003).  The doctrine is defined as that principle under which\r\nquestions of law decided on appeal to a court of last resort will govern the case throughout\r\nits subsequent stages.  <em>Hudson v. Wakefield</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1499932\"><a href=\"/opinion/1499932/hudson-v-wakefield/\"><span class=\"volume\">711</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">628</span></a></span>, 630 (Tex. 1986); <em>see also\r\nBFI Waste Sys. of N. Am., Inc. v. N. Alamo Water Supply Corp.</em>, No. 13-04-00069-CV,\r\n2006 Tex. App. LEXIS 3007, at *7 (Tex. App.-Corpus Christi Apr. 13, 2006, pet. denied)\r\n(mem. op., not designated for publication).  However, a decision rendered on an issue\r\nbefore the appellate court does not absolutely bar re-consideration of the same issue on\r\na second appeal.  <em>Briscoe</em>, 102 S.W.3d at 716 (citing <em>Kempner v. Huddleston</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3977543\"><a href=\"/opinion/4205783/kempner-v-huddleston/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">1066</span></a></span>, 1066-67 (Tex. 1896)).  Application of the doctrine lies within the discretion of the\r\ncourt, depending on the particular circumstances surrounding that case.  <em>Id.</em>; <em>see also BFI\r\nWaste Sys.</em>, 2006 Tex. App. LEXIS 3007, at *7.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe instant case is a prime example of why the law of the case doctrine cannot\r\nalways apply.  First, a key fact that we assumed in <em>Dewhurst</em> was disproved at trial: \r\nnamely, that the plugging of wells occurred before or simultaneously to the assignment of\r\nthe 1986 Lease.  GMIT argues that this Court \"did not rely upon the plugging date in\r\nfashioning its opinion\" in <em>Dewhurst</em>.  This is incorrect.  We relied heavily on that assumption\r\nin concluding that the assignment was ambiguous and that the GLO had waived its right\r\nto enforce the termination provision of the 1986 Lease.<sup> (14)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAlthough we were bound to assume GMIT's pleadings as true in <em>Dewhurst</em>, we are\r\nnot similarly bound here.  Instead, we have the benefit of a record that includes four days\r\nof trial testimony in which certain facts were conclusively established, including the date\r\nthat the wells were plugged.  After reviewing the record, we conclude that the GLO did not\r\nwaive its right to enforce the termination provision of the 1986 Lease.  Therefore, the 1986\r\nLease unambiguously terminated by its own terms on July 9, 1999, upon the plugging of\r\nthe wells on Tract 526L.  It is of no consequence that Mauro believed GMIT had done\r\nenough to ensure they could continue with the mariculture project, nor even that Mauro\r\nwould have declined to enforce the termination provision were he still in office.  Indeed,\r\none of the fundamental reasons why immunity exists is to prevent governmental entities\r\nfrom being bound by the policy decisions of their predecessors.  <em>Catalina Dev., Inc. v.\r\nCounty of El Paso</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1627284\"><a href=\"/opinion/1627284/catalina-development-v-county-of-el-paso/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">704</span></a></span>, 706 (Tex. 2003); <em>see IT-Davy</em>, 74 S.W.3d at 854\r\n(stating that \"legislative control ensures that current policymakers are neither bound by, nor\r\nheld accountable for, policies underlying their predecessors' long-term contracts.\").</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSecond, the law regarding waiver of immunity by the State's conduct has changed\r\nsignificantly since we decided <em>Dewhurst</em>.  In <em>Fed. Sign v. Tex. State Univ.</em>, the Texas\r\nSupreme Court suggested in a footnote that there may be circumstances \"where the State\r\nmay waive its immunity by conduct other than [by] simply executing a contract.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2382125\"><a href=\"/opinion/2382125/federal-sign-v-texas-southern-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span>, 408 n.1 (Tex. 1997).  But since then, the supreme court has consistently\r\ndeclined to fashion a waiver-by-conduct exception to the doctrine of governmental\r\nimmunity.  <em>See IT-Davy</em>, 74 S.W.3d at 857 (\"Creating a waiver-by-conduct exception would\r\nforce the State to expend its resources to litigate the waiver-by-conduct issue before\r\nenjoying sovereign immunity's protections--and this would defeat many of the doctrine's\r\nunderlying policies.\"); <em>Gen. Serv. Comm'n v. Little-Tex Insulation Co.</em>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">591</span></span>, 595\r\n(Tex. 2001) (\"Historically, we have left to the Legislature whether to waive sovereign\r\nimmunity . . . [t]oday we once again adhere to this principle and defer to the Legislature.\");\r\n<em>see also Catalina Dev., Inc.</em>, 121 S.W.3d at 705-07 (finding that El Paso County's conduct\r\nin refusing to sign property over to Catalina, despite Catalina's bid for the property being\r\npreviously approved by the county, did not waive immunity because \"the County was under\r\nno statutory obligation either to accept any potential bids or to complete a transaction if it\r\ndid decide to accept a bid.\").</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTo hold that the GLO's conduct implicitly waived its right to enforce the termination\r\nprovision of the 1986 Lease--and therefore that the GLO waived its immunity when it\r\nsought to enforce that provision--would be to create the conduct-based exception to\r\ngovernmental immunity that the supreme court has consistently declined to fashion.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tConsequently, we conclude that Dewhurst was well within his discretion, and did not\r\nviolate the law, when he demanded that GMIT forfeit its rights to Tract 526L upon the\r\ntermination of the 1986 Lease by its own terms.  As such, the doctrine of governmental\r\nimmunity bars GMIT's suit seeking a declaration to the contrary.  Accordingly, we sustain\r\nPatterson's first issue.<strong></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>C. GMIT's Takings Claim</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGMIT asserts by cross-appeal that the trial court erred in denying GMIT's claims\r\nmade pursuant to article I, section 17 of the Texas Constitution.  We disagree.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tArticle I, section 17 of the Texas Constitution prohibits the State from taking a\r\nperson's property under its sovereign powers without adequate compensation unless by\r\nsuch person's consent. <em> </em>Tex. Const. art. I, § 17; <em>see Little-Tex</em>, 39 S.W.3d at 598.  To\r\nestablish a claim under this provision, GMIT must prove (1) the State intentionally\r\nperformed certain acts, (2) that resulted in a \"taking\" of property, (3) for public use.  <em>Steele\r\nv. City of Houston</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1624478\"><a href=\"/opinion/1624478/steele-v-city-of-houston/\"><span class=\"volume\">603</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">786</span></a></span>, 788-92 (Tex. 1980).  Although we have concluded that\r\nthe doctrine of governmental immunity bars GMIT's declaratory judgment action, the\r\ndoctrine does not shield Patterson from an action for compensation under the takings\r\nclause.  <em>See Little-Tex</em>, 39 S.W.3d at 598; <em>Steele</em>, 603 S.W.2d at 791.  Whether particular\r\nfacts are enough to constitute a taking is a question of law.  <em>See Little-Tex</em>, 39 S.W.3d at\r\n598; <em>Mayhew v. Town of Sunnyvale</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2393810\"><a href=\"/opinion/2393810/mayhew-v-town-of-sunnyvale/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">922</span></a></span>, 936 (Tex. 1998).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGMIT contends that Dewhurst's termination of the 1986 Lease deprived GMIT of its\r\nlegal right to use Tract 526L.  However, the State does not have the requisite intent under\r\nconstitutional-takings jurisprudence when it merely withholds property or money from an\r\nentity in a contract dispute.  <em>See Little-Tex</em>, 39 S.W.3d at 598-99.  In such a situation, the\r\nState does not have the intent to take under its eminent domain powers; rather, it only has\r\nan intent to act within the scope of the contract.  <em>Green Int'l Co. v. State</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2384982\"><a href=\"/opinion/2384982/green-intern-inc-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">877</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">428</span></a></span>,\r\n434 (Tex. App.-Austin 1994, writ dism'd).  In other words, when the State acts within a\r\ncolor of right to withhold property under a contract, it is acting akin to a private citizen and\r\nnot under any sovereign powers, and so a takings claim does not lie.  <em>See Little-Tex</em>, 39\r\nS.W.3d at 599.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGMIT relies on <em>Tex. Parks &amp; Wildlife Dep't v. Callaway</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1572922\"><a href=\"/opinion/1572922/texas-parks-wildlife-dept-v-callaway/\"><span class=\"volume\">971</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></a></span> (Tex.\r\nApp.-Austin 1998, no pet.) to support its argument that the GLO's actions constituted a\r\ncompensable taking.  In <em>Callaway</em>, the Austin court of appeals ruled that a governmental\r\nagency's violations of both contractual <em>and </em>extracontractual duties constituted a valid basis\r\nfor a claim under article I, section 17.  <em>Id.</em> at 151.  However, the court was very clear in\r\ndistinguishing the factual situation in <em>Callaway</em> from cases where \"the state's duty to pay\r\nor perform arose <em>solely</em> from its contract with the private party.\"  <em>Id. </em>at 150 (emphasis in\r\noriginal).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the instant case, the GLO's duties with respect to Tract 526L arose entirely out\r\nof its execution of the 1986 Lease.  Once the 1986 Lease terminated by its own terms, the\r\nState owed no additional extracontractual duties to GMIT.  Thus, the GLO lacked the\r\nrequisite intent to form the basis of a valid takings claim.  Therefore, we conclude that the\r\ntrial court did not err in denying GMIT's constitutional takings claim.  Accordingly, we\r\noverrule GMIT's first issue on cross-appeal.<strong></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>D. Attorney's Fees</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tPatterson asserts by his sixth issue on appeal that the trial court erred in awarding\r\nattorney's fees that were not segregated by claim or defendant and were unsupported by\r\nthe evidence, and in awarding appellate attorney's fees that were based on conclusory\r\naffidavit testimony and unconditioned on the successful defense of the judgment upon\r\nappeal.  GMIT asserts by its second issue on cross-appeal that the trial court erred in\r\nawarding attorney's fees in an amount less than that requested by GMIT.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act permits a trial court to award reasonable\r\nand necessary attorney's fees as are equitable and just.  Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §\r\n37.009.  However, in light of our conclusion that governmental immunity bars GMIT's\r\ndeclaratory judgment action, the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act is not applicable, and\r\ntherefore there is no basis for the award of attorney's fees.  <em>See In re Sw.

Tract 526L is owned by the State of Texas and has been dedicated to the Permanent School Fund\r\n(\"PSF\").  The PSF is a mechanism created pursuant to the Texas Constitution in order to provide funding for\r\nthe state's public schools, and proceeds from the sale of PSF land are invested for that purpose.  <em>See</em> Tex.\r\nConst. art. VII, §§ 2, 4.  The Commissioner of the General Land Office (\"GLO\") may enter into leases of PSF\r\nland for \"any purpose the commissioner determines is in the best interest of the state under terms and\r\nconditions set by the commissioner.\"  Tex. Nat. Res. Code Ann. §§ 51.012 &amp; 51.121 (Vernon Supp. 2006).\r\n</p><p>3.  Under rules promulgated by the GLO, a lessee of submerged PSF land such as Tract 526L must\r\n\"remove all equipment, structures, machinery, tools, supplies, and other items on the [leased] property and\r\notherwise restore the property to the condition it was in immediately preceding issuance of th[e] lease\" within\r\n120 days of the discontinuance of the lease.  31 Tex. Admin. Code § 9.91(c)(5)(C) (1999).\r\n</p><p>4.  GMIT claims that the GLO \"terminated\" the lease at this point, but the record does not reflect this\r\ninterpretation of events.  Rather, at this time, the GLO merely announced its determination that it would\r\ndecline to execute a new lease suited to use of Tract 526L for mariculture purposes.  There is no indication\r\nthat the GLO ever purported to \"terminate\" the 1986 Lease prior to the time it expired by its own terms.\r\n</p><p>5. <em> See</em> Tex. Const. art.

The November 15, 2005 judgment, which is the judgment\r\nthat is appealed here, incorporated all of the rulings announced in the August 4, 2005, judgment and also\r\nincluded rulings on attorney's fees.\r\n</p><p>12. <em> Cf.

Nat. Res. Code Ann. § 51.121 (Vernon Supp. 2006).\r\n</p><p>14. In <em>Dewhurst</em>, we repeatedly referred to the assumed fact that the wells had been plugged prior to\r\nor simultaneously with the assignment of the lease:</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>The provision regarding plugging and abandoning the wells conflicts with the purpose of the\r\nassignment as intended by the parties, who knew the wells were plugged and abandoned by\r\nthe agreement as a condition to making the assignment at the outset. . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>To construe the assignment so as to terminate it before it commenced, that is, upon plugging\r\nand abandonment of the wells, would be unreasonable, oppressive and ridiculous. . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>[I]t would have been impossible for the parties to perform under the assignment/lease, if the\r\ncontention of Dewhurst were accepted.  This theory would place Mauro/Dewhurst in the\r\nposition of making the contract, knowing that the plugging and abandonment of the wells had\r\noccurred prior to or simultaneously with the execution of the assignment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>55 S.W.3d at 97-98.\r\n<p>15.  Because of our conclusion with regard to attorney's fees, we need not address Patterson's\r\narguments regarding the segregation of the attorney's fees award or the unconditional nature of the award\r\nof appellate attorney's fees.  Though we do not reach the issue, we note that it is well-settled that a trial court\r\nmay not grant an unconditional award of appellate attorney's fees, because to do so would penalize a party\r\nfor pursuing a meritorious appeal.  <em>Pickett v.
