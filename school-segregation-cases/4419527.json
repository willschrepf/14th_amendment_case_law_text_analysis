With the parties consent, the trial court\n\nconducted a hearing in this case on the basis of documentary evidence. The trial\ncourt concluded that Hood was entitled to a penalty award of $7,150 for the\n\nDistrict's untimely production of certain documents.1 It rejected Hood's other\nclaims.2 The court also concluded that Hood was entitled to $5,309.95 in attorney\n\nfees and costs.3\n\n       Hood appeals the underlying judgment and the award ofattorney fees. He\nargues that the trial court erred when it determined that the District's search for\nresponsive records was reasonable, penalized the District \"only for untimely\ndisclosures while ignoring other violations,\" denied his proposed groupings for\npenalties, erroneously applied mitigating and aggravating factors to its penalty\n\n\n\n\n1Clerk's Papers (CP) at 241.\n2 CP at 3100.\n3 CP at 46.\n\fNo. 73165-3-1/2\n\n\ncalculations, and erroneously calculated the penalty period.4 He also claims that\n\nthe trial court should have granted all of his requested attorney fees.\n\n       Based on our de novo review, we conclude that the trial court did not err\n\nexcept when it calculated Hood's award of attorney fees and costs. Accordingly,\n\nwe affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.\n\n                                      FACTS\n\n       Hood worked as a teacher for the District from 1996 to 2010.5 In 2010, the\n\nDistrict decided not to renew Hood's teaching contract.6 Through his union, Hood\n\nchallenged the decision in binding arbitration.7 An arbitrator upheld the District's\n\nnon-renewal decision.8      Hood subsequently filed multiple lawsuits against the\n\nDistrict in federal court.9 Hood also made numerous public records requests of the\n\nDistrict under the Public Records Act (PRA).10 The District's responses to those\n\nrequests are the subject of this lawsuit.\n\n       Hood began requesting public records from the District in June 2011.11 That\nyear, Hood requested records on June 16, July 1, July 7, July 10, and July 14.12\nBy August 5, Hood had made 25 different requests.13 Hood made additional record\nrequests on August 18 and November 1 of that year.14\n\n\n\n4 Appellant's Am.

For example,\n\nin 2011, the District responded on June 17, July 5, July 9, July 12, July 20, July 28,\n\nAugust 5, August 17, August 22, September 6, September 7, September 9,\n\nSeptember 14, September 20, October 14, November 7, December 14, and\n\nDecember 21,24 In 2012, the District responded on January 2, June 21, September\n\n11, September 26, October 12, October 22, October 23, October 31, November 3,\nNovember 8, November 19, November 20, November 27, November 29,\n\nDecember 12, and December 19.25 In 2013, the District responded on January\n\n25, January 31, February 5, February 14, February 20, March 12, March 14, March\n25, and May 2.26 In 2014, the District responded on February 5, February 14,\nFebruary 20, February 28, March 12, and March 14.27 Hood and the District\nexchanged e-mails during these time frames as well.\n          The District provided thousands of records in response to Hood's\nrequests.28 In 2011, the District provided records on July 20, July 27, August 16,\nAugust 31, September 7, September 20, October 14, and December 16.29 In 2012,\nthe District provided records January 2, June 21, September 11, October 9,\nOctober 16, November 13, November 27, November 29, December 12, and\n\n\n\n23 CP at 225.\n24   CP   at 225, 899-903, 995, 1002-92.\n25   CP   at 225-26, 903-07, 1096-1182.\n26   CP   at 226, 908-09, 1187-88,

25,\n\nand May 2.31 In 2014, the District provided records on February 5, February 28,\n\nand March 14.32\n\n        In June 2012, Hood commenced this action against the District in Island\n\nCounty Superior Court.33 Among other things, Hood alleged that the District\n\nviolated the PRA when it responded to his July 2011 record requests.34 In August\n\n2013, Hood filed an amended complaint against the District alleging many\n\nadditional violations of the PRA when it responded to his later requests.35\n\n         In March 2014, Hood moved for summary judgment.36 He argued that the\n\nDistrict violated the PRA in numerous ways when it responded to his requests from\n\nJune 2011, July 2011, November 1, 2011, June 19, 2012, September 11, 2012,\nOctober 10, 2012, October 16, 2012, October 18, 2012, November 15, 2012,\n\nJanuary 24, 2013, and January 28, 2013.37 He proposed grouping the violations\ninto nine different groups, and he sought a total penalty award of $390,795.38 With\nhis motion, Hood submitted affidavits from himself and from his attorney.39\n         The District responded and argued that its searches were reasonable, that\nHood's allegations were speculative, insufficient, and meritless, and that Hood's\n\n\n\n\n30 CP at 226, 903-07.\n31 CP at 226, 895-96, 907-09.\n32 CP at 226, 896, 909-10.\n33 CP   at   2816.\n34 CP   at   2816.\n35 CP

the\n\nDistrict submitted declarations from several District employees and attorneys.\n\n        On June 27, 2014, the matter proceeded to a hearing.41 The parties agreed\n\nthat the hearing on the merits could be conducted on the basis of affidavits\n\npursuant to RCW 42.56.550(3).42 Thus, with the parties' consent, the court\n\nconducted a trial on the basis of the submitted papers.43 The court explicitly stated\n\nthat it \"balanced and weighed the evidence\" and \"resolved all material factual\n\nissues and issues of credibility, as it would if it had heard oral testimony.\"44\n        On September 15, 2014, the trial court issued its memorandum decision.45\nIt determined that Hood was entitled to penalty award of $4,890 for the District's\n\nuntimely production of documents in response to Hood's June 2011 requests and\nHood's July 2011 requests.46 It also determined that Hood was entitled to a penalty\naward of $2,260 for the District's untimely production of documents in response to\nHood's November 1, 2011 request.47 It rejected the remainder of Hood's claims.48\n         On December 15, 2014, the trial court entered comprehensive findings of\nfact and conclusions of law.49 It also entered final judgment, which granted Hood's\n\n\n\n\n40 CP at 764-808.\n41 CPat218.\n42 CP at 218, 3060.\n43 CP at 219, 3060.\n44 QD gt 219\n45 CP at 219, 3060-3100.\n46 CP   at

    Hood subsequently moved for reconsideration.51        He claimed that the\n\ndiscovery of five additional e-mails constituted newly discovered evidence\n\nestablishing that the District's searches in response to Hood's July and November\n\n2011 requests were not reasonable.52 In a written decision, the court rejected\n\nthese arguments and denied Hood's motion.53          It entered an order denying\n\nreconsideration.54\n\n         Hood moved for attorney fees and costs.55 In March 2015, the trial court\n\nentered its findings offact, conclusions oflaw, and order on this motion.56 Thetrial\ncourt concluded that Hood was entitled to an award of attorney fees and costs, but\n\nit declined to award Hood his full requested amount.57 It reduced the amount of\n\nattorney fees requested by 50 percent and awarded Hood $5,309.95.58\n         Hood appeals.\n\n                                    ANALYSIS\n\n         The PRA \"is a strongly worded mandate for broad disclosure of

However, RAP 2.5(b)(1) provides four exceptions tothis\nrule.

Regardless of the result of our review, Hood\nwould be entitled to at least the money he has already accepted.60 The District\ndoes not contend that Hood is entitled to any less money than he received in the\n\njudgment.

Hood asserts that we review de novo agency actions under the PRAwhen\n\nthe sole evidence is documentary.64 He further asserts that we are not bound by\n\nthe trial court's factual findings regarding an agency's PRA violations.65 The\n\nDistrict asserts that because the trial court made credibility findings, weighed\n\nevidence, and resolved conflicting testimony, the substantial evidence standard is\n\nappropriate for any challenged factual finding.66 We agree with Hood.\n       Under RCW 42.56.550(3), \"[judicial review of all agency actions taken or\n\nchallenged under RCW 42.56.030 through 42.56.520 shall be de novo.\"67\n       On appeal, \"the appellate court stands in the same position as the trial court\nwhere the record consists only of affidavits, memoranda of law, and other\ndocumentary evidence.\" PAWS, 125 Wn.2d at 252. \"Under such circumstances,\n\nthe reviewing court is not bound by the trial court's findings on disputed factual\n\nissues.\" PAWS. 125 Wn.2d at 253.\n\n\n\n\n61 CP at 804-08.\n62 Resp't's Br. at 2, 48-49.\n63 Given our resolution of this issue, we deny Hood's motion to supplement the record\nunder RAP 9.11, and we deny the District's cross-motion to supplement the record.\n64 Appellant's Am.

The\nrecord establishes that the District's searches were reasonably calculated to\n\n uncover all relevant documents.\n\n\n\n                                        12\n\fNo. 73165-3-1/13\n\n\n       Declarations of District employees detail the District's searches in response\n\nto Hood's requests. In general, they describe the procedure employed to identify\n\nindividuals likely to have responsive records, the likely location of records, and the\n\nsearch terms utilized to search for records.\n\n       Of particular interest are the declarations of Josephine Moccia, the District\n\nSuperintendent, and Brian Miller, the DistrictTechnology Manager.\n\n       Moccia personally oversaw the District's response to each of Hood's public\n\nrecords requests after her arrival in the District in July 2011.70 Moccia consulted\n\nwith the individual District staff members directly responsible for gathering\n\nresponsive records, directed individuals with personal knowledge of potentially\nresponsive records to gather those records, and in some instances, personally\nsearched for responsive records within her direct control.71\n       Moccia testified that in response to Hood's July 2011 requests, she directed\n\nMiller to work with legal counsel \"to identify key search terms and potential record\ncustodians and then to search those custodians' electronic files for responsive\n\nrecords.\"72      The potential custodians included current and former District\nadministrative staff, the District's board members, and the teachers, counselors,\n\nand union representatives identified by Hood.73\n       Moccia testified that individual District staff members also searched their\n\ncomputer files for responsive records.74        For example, Moccia directed her\n\n\n\n70 CP at 419.\n71 CPat419.\n72 CP at 2812.\n73 CP at 2812.\n74 CP at 2813.\n\n

for the specific programs identified\n\nin Hood's requests were directed to locate and assemble potentially responsive\n\nrecords.76 Likewise, school and administrative staff from Hood's former school\n\nwere directed to locate and assemble potentially responsive records.77\n\n        The District's outside counsel reviewed the assembled records in July,\n\nAugust, September, and October 2011.78 Exempt records were withheld and\n\nlogged as additional responsive records were gathered.79 The District provided\nresponsive, non-exempt records in several installments between July and October\n\n2011.80\n\n         Moccia testified that Hood's November 2011 requests were \"largely\n\nduplicative\" of his July 2011 requests.81 Nonetheless, Moccia directed Miller and\nother central office staff to locate and assemble responsive records.82 Further,\n\nschool and administrative staff from Hood's former school \"were again directed to\n\nlocate and assemble potentially responsive

non-exempt records responsive to his November 2011\n\nrequests in several installments between December 2011 and January 2012.85\n        After Hood filed this lawsuit against the District in 2012 alleging violations\n\nof the PRA in responding to his July 2011 requests, Moccia carefully reviewed the\n\nallegations in his complaint.86 In response to his allegations, Moccia \"directed that\nthe District undertake another review of its files to ensure that no responsive, non-\n\nexempt records were inadvertently withheld\" from Hood.87 During this search, the\nDistrict discovered a file of binders Moccia's predecessor maintained.88 After\n\nreviewing these records, the District produced additional records to Hood in\nSeptember 2012.89\n\n         Between June 2012 and February 2013, Moccia continued to receive\n\ndozens of public records requests from Hood.90 Many of these requests were\nduplicative \"to the broadest parts of [Hood's] July 2011 and November 2011 public\nrecord requests\" as well as his other requests.91\n         In response to Hood's continued requests, Moccia \"directed the completion\nof additional searches of the District's computer systems by [Miller] and other\nDistrict technology support staff.\"92 Moccia testified that District administrators,\n\n\n\n84 CP   at 2815.\n85 CP   at 2815-16.\n86 CP   at 2816.\n87 CP   at 2817.\n88 CP   at 2817.\n89

members were \"notified\n\nof requests related to them and requested to search for and produce any additional\n\nrecords responsive to Hood's specific requests.\"93 For example, upon receiving\n\nHood's requests for records regarding an alleged state audit of the District, Moccia\n\nasked the District's Assistant Superintendent for Business to locate responsive\n\nrecords.94 And when asked by Hood for records regarding student attendance at\n\nBayview School, she asked the director of the school and his secretarial staff to\nlocate responsive records.95\n\n       Moccia testified that the District spent hundreds of hours of staff and\n\nattorney time and thousands of dollars responding to Hood's requests.96 She\nfurther testified:\n\n        Throughout the process of responding to [Hood's] numerous\n        requests, I fully intended that the District provide [Hood] all\n        identifiable, responsive, non-exempt records that the District located.\n        I believe that the District's searches and productions were\n        reasonable in their scope and conducted with diligence and in good\n        faith. Ihave no personal motivation to withhold material from [Hood]\n        or to not disclose the records he requested. I have not intentionally\n        destroyed any records that [Hood] was requesting or directed that\n        anyone else destroy or not disclose records to [Hood] to prevent him\n        from accessing such records. Any errors in the District's search and\n        production processes were inadvertent and not the result of any\n        intention to hinder [Hood's] access to public records from the\n        District.!97^\n\n\n\n\n 93 CP at 2819.\n 94 CP at 2819.\n 95 CP at 2819.\n 96 CP at 2820, 2814.\n 97 CP at 2820.\n\n                                          16\n\fNo. 73165-3-1/17\n\n\n           Miller's declaration provides even greater detail than Moccia's declaration.\n\nMiller worked as the District's Technology Manager from 1993 to 2012 and then\n\nworked as the District's Director of Facilities and Operations.98\n\n           In response to Hood's July 2011 requests, Miller worked with the District's\n\nlegal counsel to locate responsive records from the District's electronic\n\ndatabases.99 Miller testified that he worked with the District's attorney to identify\n\nkey search terms and potential record custodians for each request.100 He then\nsearched each of those custodians' electronic mail accounts for records.101\n\n           With his declaration, Miller provided a copy of the processing matrix he\n\ncreated to track his work on the July 2011 requests.102 This detailed matrix lists\n\nseveral categories of information.103 It provides (1) a description ofeach of Hood's\n\nrequests, (2) the relevant date range for each request, (3) the searchterms utilized\nfor each request, (4) the systems searched, and (5) the potential custodians for\neach request.104 With respect to Hood's July 2011 requests, the matrix shows that\nMiller searched the accounts of at least 40 individuals.105\n\n           Miller testified that he spent over 60 hours \"carefully searching and\n\nreviewing email files for [Hood's] requests in the summer and fall of 2011 .\"106 He\nsearched the personal e-mail accounts ofeach identified custodian onthe District's\n\n\n\n98 CP at 2793.\n99 CP at 2794.\n100 CP at 2794.\n101 CP at 2794.\n102 CP at 2794,

District changed its e-mail from FirstClass to\n\n\"Google Apps, a cloud-based electronic mail system.\"108 Unlike the FirstClass\nsystem, the District did not maintain physical control over the e-mail server.109\nNonetheless, Miller also searched for e-mails in the Google Apps program.110\nDuring the search process, hediscovered that the Google Apps program was only\nsaving e-mails for a period of 45 days after their creation.111 Miller reported the\nproblem to Google and it was addressed going-forward.112 However, due to this\nerror, there is a period of time for which the District's e-mails were not archived.113\n       After assembling all responsive electronic records located in his searches,\nMiller provided them to the District's counsel for review.114 Miller ultimately\nprovided three CD-ROMs (compact disc, read-only memory) to Hood containing\nall of the non-exempt records that Miller was able to locate in response to Hood's\nJuly 2011 requests.115\n       In response to Hood's November 2011 requests, Miller duplicated the\nsearch efforts described earlier, using new search terms and time periods.116 With\n\n\n107 CP at 2795.\n108 CP at 2796.\n109 CP

73165-3-1/19\n\n\nhis declaration, Miller included the processing matrix he used to track his work on\n\nthese requests.117 This matrix, like the other, provides the same five categories of\n\ninformation, including the relevant search terms and potential custodians.118 Once\n\nMiller had assembled records responsive to Hood's November 2011 requests and\n\nthe District's counsel had reviewed them, he prepared another CD-ROM for\n\nproduction to Hood.119\n\n           In response to Hood's continued requests in September and October 2012,\n\nMiller searched both of the District's electronic mail systems—FirstClass and\n\nGoogle Apps—to locate any potentially responsive records.120 He searched in the\n\naccounts of likely custodians of responsive records based on the individuals\n\nidentified in Hood's requests.121 With his declaration, Miller included a copy of the\n\nprocessing matrix he created to track his work on these requests.122 Like the\nothers, this matrix reflects the same categories of information, including the\n\nrelevant search terms and potential custodians searched.123\n\n           Finally, Miller testified as follows:\n\n           Throughout the process of responding to [Hood's] requests, I have\n           conducted all searches to the best of my ability, I have pulled and\n           reviewed all responsive documents located by my searches, and I\n           have worked with the District Superintendent and its counsel to\n           provide all records located. I have no personal reason to withhold\n           material from [Hood] or not to disclose the records he requested. No\n           one has ever asked me to destroy records that [Hood] requested or\n           suggested that records not be disclosed to him. To the contrary, my\n           direction from the Superintendent has always been to disclose all\n\n117 CP at 2798, 2804.\n118   CP   at   2804.\n119   CP   at   2798.\n120   CP   at   2798-99.\n121   CP   at   2799.\n122 CP at 2799, 2806.\n123 CP at 2806.\n\n                                                   19\n\fNo. 73165-3-1/20\n\n\n       responsive, non-exempt records. To the best of my knowledge and\n       ability, that is exactly what I did.[124]\n\n       After reviewing the record, we are convinced that the trial court properly\n\ndetermined that the District's searches were adequate.           These nonconclusory\n\ndeclarations from District employees provide significant detail about the type of\n\nsearch performed, the search terms utilized, and the locations searched. On these\n\nfacts, it is clear that the District's searches were reasonably calculated to uncover\n\nall relevant documents.\n\n\n       Hood presents a number of arguments challenging the declarations of the\n\nDistrict's employees. In general, he contends that their testimony was unreliable\n\nand incredible and that it misled the trial court.125 We reject all of his arguments.\n\n       Hood argues that Moccia's statement that she directed Terhar to search\n\nTerhar's computer for responsive records is contradicted by Terhar's statement\n\nthat she failed to perform a global search of her computer.126 But Terhar also\n\ntestified that if Hood's requests \"pertained to anything that [she] might have had\n\non [her] computer, [she] would search for it.\"127 This is consistent with Moccia's\n\nstatement.\n\n\n       Hood argues that the District's failure to search the files of Sue Raley, a\n\nteacher, was unreasonable.128        But as the trial court correctly noted, \"it was\n\nreasonable for the District to believe that a fellow teacher would not have District\n\n\n\n\n124 CP at 2799.\n125 Appellant's Am.

But these two declarations merely establish that in summer 2014,\n\nthese employees searched their files for records responsive to Hood's 2014\n\nrequests and found e-mail correspondence from summer 2011.131 These facts do\n\nnot negate Moccia's assertion that individual staff members searched their\n\ncomputer files for records responsive to Hood's July and November 2011\n\nrequests.132\n\n       Hood argues that the District was obligated to search the individual\n\ncomputer files of any person who might have stored records because the District\n\nknew its e-mail system auto-deleted e-mails.133 But Moccia testified that individual\n\nstaff members searched their computer files.134 This was sufficient.\n\n       Hood argues that the untimely disclosure of e-mails shows that the\n\nsearches were unreasonable.135 He also argues that the production of District\n\nrecords by other agencies shows that the searches were unreasonable.136 He is\nincorrect on both accounts.

None of them establish that the District's searches\n\nwere unreasonable.\n\n                                       Penalties\n\n\n       Hood next argues that the trial court erred when it determined penalties.141\nSpecifically, he contends that the court erred when it rejected seven of his nine\n\nproposed penaltygroups, \"penalized the District only for untimely disclosures while\n\nignoring other violations,\" applied mitigating and aggravating factors, and\n\ncalculated the lengths of time of violations.142 We address these arguments below.\n\n\n137 Appellant's Reply Br. at 9.\n138 Appellant's Reply Br. at 9-10.\n139 Appellant's Reply Br. at 10.\n140 Appellant's Reply Br. at 10-11.\n141 Appellant's Am.

We address each of the rejected groups in turn.\n\n                                          Group 2\n\n           The trial court rejected Hood's proposed Group 2, which consisted of\n\nrecords produced in the September 11, 2012 supplemental production.146 For this\n\ngroup, Hood requested $35 per day and a total penalty of $15,015.147\n\n           The trial court rejected Group 2 for the following reason:\n\n           Hood's proposed Group 2 relates to records produced after this\n           lawsuit was filed. Yet these records were produced in response to\n           his July 2011 requests, and are thus encompassed by Group 1. The\n           Court finds no legitimate basis for increased or duplicative penalties\n           based on the fact that the records were produced after litigation was\n           initiated.   See, by analogy. Sanders 169 Wn.2d at 849-50.           This\n           proposed grouping is not appropriate.[148]\n\n           The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied this group. The\n\nrecord establishes that the records produced on September 11, 2012 were\n\nproduced in response to Hood's July 2011 requests. A letter dated September 11,\n2012 from the District to Hood confirms this.149 So does the declaration of Carlos\n\nA.

Enclosed please find a CD-ROM containing a\nsupplemental production of records related to your requests.\" CP at 1107.\n150 Chavez testified that he conducted another search for records after Hood filed his\nlawsuit in June 2012. During this search, he collected and reviewed materials for\nresponsiveness to Hood's July 2011 requests. He found eight binders of hardcopy\nmaterials and, after reviewing the binders and the District's prior productions, he provided\nHood a supplemental production of 398 pages. CP at 2863-67.\n                                             24\n\fNo. 73165-3-1/25\n\n\n       Hood claims that documents from this production were \"silently withheld for\n\n429 days\" and that the court abused its discretion when it \"minimized\" the Group\n\n2 violations.151      But Hood's argument that the District silently withheld these\n\nrecords is speculative.152 Additionally, as our Supreme Court has stated, \"[W]e did\n\nnot explicitly allow the potential silent withholding in PAWS to support a\n\nfreestanding daily penalty award.\" Neighborhood Alliance. 172 Wn.2d 724.\n\n       In short, the trial court properly rejected Hood's claims of silent withholding\n\nand did not abuse its discretion when it rejected proposed Group 2.\n\n                                         Group 3\n\n       The trial court rejected Hood's proposed Group 3, which consisted of\n\ndocuments that the District initially listed on an October 14, 2011 exemption log\n\nand then later produced with the September 11, 2012 supplemental production.153\nFor this group, Hood requested $50 per day and a total penalty of$21,450.154\n       The trial court rejected Group 3 for the following reason:\n\n       Hood's proposed Group 3 contains exempt documents withheld by\n       the District based on what Hood argues was a false claim of the\n       deliberative process exemption. Hood argues that penalties should\n       be assessed because the District initially asserted the deliberative\n       process exemption of RCW 42.56.280 as the basis for withholding\n       the documents, and this exemption didn't apply. But the District later\n       asserted the work product and attorney-client privileges exemption\n       for the withholding of the documents, and it was entitled to do so.\n       [Sanders, 169 Wn.2d at 849-50]; fPAWS. 125 Wn.2d at 253.] The\n       Court has conducted an in camera review of the documents Hood\n       identified as potentiallywrongfully withheld, and has determined that\n       they are all exempt from disclosure. To the extent that Hood argues\n       that the District's production of some exempt documents prevents it\n       from asserting exemptions to other documents, this is plainly\n\n151 Appellant's Am. Opening Br. at 47.\n152 Appellant's Am.

Under Sanders, the production of exempt documents does\n       not necessarily waive exemptions as to other documents. 169\n       Wn.2d at 847-50. The Court finds no waiver in the present case.\n       Group 3 is not a valid grouping for this case.[155]\n\n       The trial court's reasoning was correct. The trial court properly recognized\n\nthat the relevant consideration is whether the documents are exempt from\n\ndisclosure. Sanders. 169 Wn.2d at 849-50. If they are exempt, \"the agency's\n\nwithholding of them was lawful and its subsequent production of them irrelevant.\"\n\nSanders. 169 Wn.2d at 850. The trial court also properly recognized that the\n\nDistrict could assert a different exemption than the one initially claimed.\n\n       Our review of these documents confirms that a majority of them are exempt\n\nfrom disclosure under the work product exemption or the attorney-client privilege\n\nexemption.       Hood presents no persuasive argument to the contrary.          The\n\nremaining documents are not responsive to Hood's requests. Accordingly, the trial\n\ncourt properly concluded that the agency's withholding of those documents was\n\nlawful and the subsequent production of them was irrelevant. In short, the trial\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion when it rejected Group 3.\n\n                                         Group 4\n\n       The trial court rejected Hood's proposed Group 4, which consisted of\n\ndocuments disclosed by other agencies. According to Hood, these documents\n\nshow \"that the District silently withheld [these documents] for a period of 604 days\n\nand/or destroyed them.\"156 For this group, Hood requested $100 per day and a\n\ntotal penalty of $60,400.157\n\n\n155 CP at 229.\n156 Appellant's Am. Opening Br. at 51.\n157 CP at 933-34.\n\n                                           26\n\fNo. 73165-3-1/27\n\n\n       The trial court rejected Group 4 for the following reason:\n\n       Hood proposes Group 4 for the documents that he alleges the District\n       is silently withholding from him. The basis for Hood's argument\n       appears to be that various documents were provided to him by other\n       agencies in response to other public records requests, and therefore\n       that the District must be intentionally silently withholding identical\n       records. Hood's speculation has no record support, and the Court\n       finds that additional penalties based on this speculation are\n       unwarranted. Furthermore, to the extent they existed and were\n       untimely produced, any such documents are already included in\n       Groups 1 and 5 and are fully addressed in the penalties the Court\n       will award for those groups.11581\n\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it rejected this group.\n\n\"Purely speculative claims about the existence and discoverability of other\n\ndocuments will not overcome an agency affidavit, which is accorded a presumption\n\nof good faith.\" Forbes v. City of Gold Bar, 171 Wn. App. 857, 867, 288 P.3d 384\n\n(2012). The fact that other agencies produced documents responsive to Hood's\n\nrequests does not establish that the District's search was unreasonable. See\n\nNeighborhood Alliance. 172 Wn.2d at 720. Nor does it establish that the District\n\nsilently withheld these documents.\n\n        Likewise, the fact that the District produced documents referencing\n\nunproduced documents does not establish that the District's search was\n\nunreasonable.    See Neighborhood Alliance. 172 Wn.2d at 737.          Nor does it\n\nestablish that the District silently withheld the unproduced documents. Further, as\n\nwe indicated earlier, potential silent withholding does not support a freestanding\n\ndaily penalty award. Neighborhood Alliance. 172 Wn.2d 724. In short, the trial\n\n\n\n\n158 CP at 230.\n\n                                           27\n\fNo. 73165-3-1/28\n\n\ncourt properly concluded that Hood's silent withholding claims were speculative,\n\nand it did not abuse its discretion when it rejected Group 4.\n\n                                        Group 6\n\n         The trial court rejected Hood's proposed Group 6, which consisted of\n\ndocuments relating to a state audit of student enrollment at a district school, the\n\nDistrict's \"Highly Capable Learner's Program,\" administrative policies, and the\n\ncollective bargaining agreement.159 Hood asserts that these documents warrant\n\nhigher penalties because they are records of public importance. For this group,\n\nHood requested $50 per day and a total penalty of $26,200.160\n\n         The trial court rejected Group 6 for the following reason:\n\n         Hood argues that certain documents he requested were of public\n         importance, and requests increased penalties for his proposed\n         Group 6 on this basis. The Court has determined that Hood's\n         assertions are largely without merit, as detailed below. The Court\n         does not find any legitimate basis for heightened penalties based on\n         the alleged public importance of any of Hood's requests.\n         Furthermore, any such records are subsumed in Groups 1 and 5 and\n         are fully addressed in the penalties the Court will award for those\n         groups.[161]\n\n         The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it rejected this proposed\n\ngroup. The trial court \"fully accounted\" for any public importance of these records\nwhen it considered this as an aggravating factor in assessing penalties.162 Hood\n\nfails to persuasively explain why the alleged public importance of the documents\n\nfactor should constitute its own freestanding penalty.\n\n\n\n\n159   CP at   934.\n160   CP at   935.\n161   CP at   230.\n162   CPat    237.\n\n                                           28\n\fNo. 73165-3-1/29\n\n\n                                         Group 7\n\n      The trial court rejected Hood's proposed Group 7, which consisted of\n\nallegedly undisclosed metadata.163 Hood argues that the District ignored his\n\nrequests for metadata \"by providing only minimal header metadata for emails and\n\nabsolutely none for non-email documents.\"164 For this group, he requested the\n\nmaximum, $100 per day, and a total penalty of $99,200.165\n      The trial court rejected Group 7 for the following reasons:\n\n       Hood claims that he requested metadata in connection with many of\n       his requests, and that the District has not provided such metadata.\n       His proposed Group 7 seeks penalties for the alleged failure to\n       produce metadata. In his email to Superintendent Moccia on July 7,\n       2011, Hood stated: \"Note that all requests below include an explicit\n       request for metadata (Fields for the 'To', 'From', and 'cc' are all\n       recipients and are considered 'metadata.' See O'Neill v. City of\n       Shoreline. 170 Wn.2d 138, 151-152[, 240 P.3d 1149] (2010))\" [sic].\n       The District provided metadata in the form ofthe \"to,\" \"from,\" and \"cc\"\n       fields (basic header information) on the emails it produced. Hood\n       received an email from the Arlington School District in response to\n       one of his records requests to that agency that also shows server\n       routing information for the electronic communication in addition tothe\n       header information. Hood did not contest the District's assertions\n       thatthis allegedly \"missing\" metadata does not supply any additional\n       substantive content to the email communication. The Court finds that\n       the server routing information Hood identifies as the metadata\n       missing from the District's productions is immaterial to the actual\n       substantive content of the records he requested.\n\n       Further, the Court finds that the District included the metadata\n       reasonably available to it and of the type explicitly requested by Hood\n       in its responses to Hood's requests. The Court finds thatthe District\n       complied with Hood's requests for metadata. Further, even if the\n       District could have technically provided Hood a greater quantity or\n       additional types of metadata, the Court finds that no additional\n       penalties are appropriate in this regard.11661\n\n\n163 CP at 935.\n164 Appellant's Am. Opening Br. at 26.\n165 CP at 935.\n166 CPat 230-31.\n\n                                            29\n\fNo. 73165-3-1/30\n\n\n       The trial court properly determined that the District complied with Hood's\n\nrequests for e-mail metadata. The District provided the type of metadata that Hood\n\nspecifically requested. Further, Miller expressly testified in his deposition that the\n\ne-mails he printed out in response to Hood's requests all had metadata.167 He\n\nidentified metadata as \"[t]he header at the top, printed by, title, date, time, [and\n\npage number.]\"168 Miller also testified that he did not know if it was possible to\n\nretrieve the additional metadata Hood now asserts should have been provided.169\n\n       The trial court did not separately analyze the District's compliance with\n\nHood's requests for metadata for non e-mail documents. But, based on our review\n\nof the record, we see no evidence that the District is \"intentionally\" and \"silently\"\n\nwithholding metadata for non e-mail documents. Hood's claims to the contrary are\n\nspeculative. In any event, the trial court also made it clear that even if the District\ncould have provided Hood with additional metadata, it would not have awarded\nany additional penalties. The court viewed the penalty awarded as sufficient to\naddress any violation based on metadata. This was within the trial court's\ndiscretion.\n\n                                       Group 8\n\n       The trial court rejected Hood's proposed Group 8, which consisted of\nrecords on a CD-ROM, labeled July 27, 2011.170 Forthis group, Hood sought the\n\nmaximum per day penalty, $100, and a total penalty of $96,250.171\n       The trial court rejected Group 8 for the following reason:\n\n167 CPat 1217.\n168 CPat 1218.\n169 CPat 1218.\n170 CPat 935, 231.\n171 CP at 935.\n\n                                          30\n\fNo. 73165-3-1/31\n\n\n\n\n       Hood's proposed Group 8 relates to the alleged late production of a\n       CD-ROM labeled with the date 7/27/11. There is no dispute that\n       Hood received a copy of this CD on February 28, 2014. The District's\n       evidence indicates that it believed that the CD had already been\n       produced to Hood on August 16, 2011. Regardless ofwhether Hood\n       received the CD itself for the first time in August 2011 or February\n       2014, the record reflects that its contents were either produced to\n       him as part of previous productions or were exempt. In any event,\n       the record supports a finding that any of the responsive records on\n       the 7/27/11 CD are appropriately accounted for within Groups 1 and\n       5, and the Court declines to award additional penalties for this\n       material beyond those calculated below.[172]\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it rejected this group. Hood\n\ndoes not challenge the assertion that these records fall within Groups 1 and 5.\nRather, he contends that the court abused its discretion \"by ignoring both the\nseverity of this violation and Hood's justification for making it a separate group.\"173\nBut the court was entitled to reject Hood's arguments. He provides no persuasive\n\nargument to the contrary.\n\n                                          Group 9\n\n        The trial court rejected Hood's proposed Group 9 for various statutory\nviolations ofthe PRA.174 Hood claims that the District charged him money to view\nrecords, tried to charge him for other requests, and refused to provide records. For\nthis group, Hood requested $25 per day and a total penalty of $10,425.175\n        The trial court rejected Group 9 for the following reasons:\n\n        Hood's proposed Group 9 encompasses his allegations that the\n        District charged him to view records, tried to charge him for at least\n        one other request, and refused to provide records because of their\n        origin without justification. The Court rejects these allegations and\n\n172 CPat 231-32.\n 173 Appellant's Am. Opening Br. at 57.\n 174 CP at 935.\n 175 CP at 936.\n\n                                            31\n\fNo. 73165-3-1/32\n\n\n       finds that additional or heightened penalties for these alleged\n       violations are not appropriate.\n\n       Hood's principal allegation to support Group 9 is that the District\n       charged him to review records. Hood had requested a large set of\n       student attendance records, and the District located these records\n       and was prepared to make them available to him. However, the\n       records consisted of approximately 5,000 hard copy originals and\n       required redaction of identifying student information from every page\n       before they could be produced. See RCW 42.56.230(1). In an\n       attempt to accommodate Hood's request, the District made a\n       redacted exemplar of the student records and showed it to Hood on\n       December 18, 2012. After reviewing the exemplar, Hood chose to\n       narrow the scope of his request and the District prepared a first\n       installment of redacted attendance records for his review.        The\n       District did notcharge Hood to review that installment, butdid explain\n       that if Hood did not wish to pay for copies of the installment after he\n       had the chance to review the records, the District would close the\n       request.\n\n       Hood paid $11.10 for copies of the first installment of 74 redacted\n       attendance records. RCW 42.56.120 provides that no fee shall be\n       charged for the inspection of public records, nor for locating public\n       documents and making them available for copying. However, a\n       reasonable fee may be imposed for providing copies of public\n       records, and to the extent that the agency has not determined the\n       actual per page cost for photocopies, the agency may not charge in\n       excess of fifteen cents per page. Seventy-four pages (the number\n       of redacted attendance records prepared for Hood by the District)\n       times $0.15 perpage is $11.10, the amount Hood paid to the District.\n       Hood acknowledges that he came to an agreement with the District\n       avoiding further copying, and he did not request further installments.\n        It would be an exaltation of form over substance to impose a penalty\n        against the District where the records were prepared at Hood's\n        request, where he voluntarily paid the $11.10, and where he reached\n        an agreement with the District obviating the need for additional\n        installments.!1761\n\n        The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it rejected this group. The\n\ntrial court's recitation of the facts is supported by the record. Further, the trial\ncourt's reasoning provides a tenable basis for the court to conclude that additional\n\n\n 176 CP at 232-33.\n\n                                          32\n\fNo. 73165-3-1/33\n\n\nor heightened penalties for any statutory violations were not warranted. We reject\n\nHood's arguments to the contrary.\n\n                          Groups 1 and 5 Penalty Amount\n\n       Hood next argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it\n\ndetermined that $5 per day was an appropriate penalty for Groups 1 and 5.177\nSpecifically, he contends that the court abused its discretion when it considered\nthe mitigating and aggravating penalty factors.178 We disagree.\n       In Yousoufian II. the Supreme Court established a framework to guide trial\n\ncourts' determinations of penalties within the range provided underthe PRA. 168\n\nWn.2d 444.\n\n       At the outset, the '\"principal\"' factor for determining the appropriate daily\npenalty is the existence or absence of an agency's bad faith. Yousoufian II, 168\nWn.2d at 460 (quoting Amren v. Citv of Kalama. 131 Wn.2d 25, 37-38, 929 P.2d\n389 (1997)). Other relevant factors relating to an agency's culpability include: (1)\nthe economic lossto the party requesting the documents; (2) the public importance\nof the underlying issue to which the request relates, and whether the significance\nof the issue wasforeseeable tothe agency; and (3) the degree towhich the penalty\nis an adequate incentive to induce further compliance.

The Yousoufian II court identified seven mitigating factors and nine\n\naggravating factors in determining PRA penalties.\n\n       The mitigating factors that may serve to decrease the penalty are\n\n       (1) a lack of clarity in the PRA request; (2) the agency's prompt\n       response or legitimate follow-up inquiry for clarification; (3) the\n       agency's good faith, honest, timely, and strict compliance with all\n       PRA procedural requirements and exceptions; (4) proper training\n       and supervision of the agency's personnel; (5) the reasonableness\n       of any explanation for noncompliance by the agency; (6) the\n       helpfulness of the agency to the requestor; and (7) the existence of\n       agency systems to track and retrieve public records.\n\nYousoufian II. 168 Wn.2d at 467 (footnotes omitted).\n\n       Conversely, the aggravating factors that may support increasing the penalty\n\nare\n\n\n       (1) a delayed response by the agency, especially in circumstances\n       making time of the essence; (2) lack of strict compliance by the\n       agency with all the PRA procedural requirements and exceptions; (3)\n       lack of proper training and supervision of the agency's personnel; (4)\n       unreasonableness of any explanation for noncompliance by the\n       agency; (5) negligent, reckless, wanton, bad faith, or intentional\n       noncompliance with the PRA by the agency; (6) agency dishonesty;\n       (7) the public importance of the issue to which the request is related,\n       where the importance was foreseeable to the agency; (8) any actual\n       personal economic loss to the requestor resulting from the agency's\n       misconduct, where the loss was foreseeable to the agency; and (9)\n       a penalty amount necessary to deter future misconduct by the\n       agency considering the size of the agency and the facts of the case.\n\nYousoufian II. 168 Wn.2d at 467-68 (footnotes omitted).\n\n       These factors \"may overlap, are offered only as guidance, may not apply\n\nequally or at all in every case, and are not an exclusive list of appropriate\n\n                                         34\n\fNo. 73165-3-1/35\n\n\nconsiderations.\" Yousoufian II. 168 Wn.2d at 468.

In 2011, the legislature amended the\nPRA to eliminate mandatory penalties. Lawsof 2011, ch. 273 § 1. The trial court\n\nacknowledged this, stating that \"the [legislature has vested [the court] with the\ndiscretion to award an appropriate penalty in an amount from zero to [$100] per\n\nday for such improper denials.\"180\n       The trial courtalso properly applied the Yousoufian II framework bycarefully\n\nconsidered the relevant mitigating and aggravating factors.\n\n\n179 CP at 239-40.\n180 CP at 238.\n\n                                          35\n\fNo. 73165-3-1/36\n\n\n         The court identified several mitigating factors in this case. It concluded that\n\nthe first mitigating factor—a lack of clarity in the PRA request—was applicable.181\n\nItfound that \"Hood made multiple, broad, overlapping, and occasionally duplicative\n\nrequests.\"182 It reasoned that \"[b]ecause of this, it was virtually inevitable that the\n\nDistrict would miss some of the records in its initial searches.\"183\n\n         The court also concluded that the second and third mitigating factors were\n\napplicable. These included the agency's prompt response and the agency's good\n\nfaith, honest, timely, and strict compliance with the PRA. The court reasoned that\n\nthe District's \"reasonably prompt responses to the majority of Hood's requests and\n\nits good faith efforts to comply with the PRA, including the retention of counsel to\n\nassist in responding to Hood, mitigate the penalties that should apply here.\"184\n         The court agreed with Hood that the lack of proper training and supervision\n\nby the District was an aggravating factor.185 But the court reasoned that the\ndecision to utilize legal counsel mitigated the District's lack of training.186\nAccordingly, it concluded that \"a minor increase in the penalty that would otherwise\nhave been imposed but for the lack of training of the [District's] personnel [was]\n\nappropriate.\"187\n\n         The court rejected several other aggravating factors proposed by Hood.\n\nThe court rejected Hood's argument that the District's unreasonable explanations\n\n\n\n 81 CP   at   237.\n 82 CP   at   237.\n 83 CP   at   237.\n 84 CP   at   237.\n 85 CP   at   233-34.\n 86 CP   at   233-34.\n 87 CP   at   234.\n\n                                            36\n\fNo. 73165-3-1/37\n\n\nfor instances of noncompliance was an aggravating factor.            It found that the\n\nDistrict's explanations for particular oversights in its searches and productions\n\nwere \"reasonable and fully understandable in light of the numerous broad and\n\noverlapping requests with which it was faced.\"188\n\n           The court rejected Hood's argument that the District's negligent, reckless,\n\nwanton, or bad faith conduct was an aggravating factor. It found that \"[t]he record\n\nas a whole shows that the District did, in fact, act in good faith at all times, was not\n\nnegligent, and provided reasonable explanations for its actions in response to\n\nHood's requests.\"189\n\n           The court rejected Hood's argument that his personal economic loss was\n\nan aggravating factor.       It found that Hood's assertion that he suffered actual\n\npersonal economic loss was frivolous.190\n\n           And the court rejected Hood's argument that the public importance of his\n\nrequests was an aggravating factor. It found that \"the overwhelming majority of\n\nHood's requests were directly related to his personal challenge to his nonrenewal\n\nas a teacher.\"191 It found and that the \"few requests that involved ostensibly public\n\nmatters were tied to the work of his former supervisors and his attempts to discredit\n\nthem.\"192 Itconcluded that this aggravating factor \"either does not apply, or applies\n\nonly minimally, in the present case\" and stated that it \"has fully accounted for this\n\nfactor in assessing an appropriate penalty against the District.\"193\n\n\n188   CP   at   234.\n189   CP   at   235.\n190   CP   at   235.\n191   CP   at   236.\n192   CP   at   236.\n193   CP   at   237.\n\n                                            37\n\fNo. 73165-3-1/38\n\n\n\n           After considering the relevant mitigating and aggravating factors, the court\n\nthen considered the other relevant factors identified in Yousoufian II. including the\n\namount necessary to effectively deter future misconduct.194\n\n           The court declined to adopt Hood's proposed multiplier of 15 for Group 1,\n\nwhich would have resulted in a penalty of $75 per day, and Hood's proposed\n\nmultiplier of 12 for Group 5, which would have resulted in a penalty of $60 per\n\nday.195 The court declined to impose these multipliers because Hood suffered no\n\neconomic loss, his requests did not concern matters of public importance, and the\n\nDistrict was \"by no means intransigent in its responses.\"196\n           The court also reasoned that the $5 per day penalty was \"appropriate and\n\nprovides adequate incentive to induce future District compliance with the[PRA].\"197\nThe court explained that the nature and size of the agency was a relevant\n\nconsideration. It stated:\n\n           The Court pointedly notes our Supreme Court's statement in\n           Yousoufian [111: \"The penalty needed to deter a small school district\n           and that necessary to deter a large county may not be the same.\"\n           [168 Wn.2d at 463.] This statement is directly applicable in the\n           present case. While District personnel had not received proper\n           training in PRA matters, the District, to its credit, engaged legal\n           counsel to assist in responding to Hood's requests.11981\n           The court noted that the District \"is a relatively small school district serving\n\napproximately 1,400 students in its school programs,\" the District's steady\ndecrease in student enrollment has led to a 15 percent drop in the District's budget\n\n\n\n194 See 168 Wn.2d at 461-63; CP at 238-241.\n195   CP   at   238-240.\n196   CP   at   238.\n197   CP   at   239.\n198   CP   at   238.\n\n                                              38\n\fNo. 73165-3-1/39\n\n\nduring the last six years, and the District does not have a dedicated full-time public\n\nrecords officer.199\n\n       Overall, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it\n\ndetermined that $5 per day was an appropriate penalty amount. The trial court's\n\nfactual determinations are supported by the evidence, and the court's reasoning\n\nshows that it properly and carefully applied the Yousoufian II framework.\n\n       Hood argues that a penalty determination \"should include consideration of\n\nculpability as a major factor.\"200 This is true. But the court did consider culpability\n\nas a factor, and it stated that \"[t]he record as a whole shows that the District did, in\n\nfact, act in good faith at all times, was not negligent, and provided reasonable\nexplanations for its actions in response to Hood's requests.\"201 As the court\nexplained in its written memorandum, \"This is by no means a case in which the\nrequester was 'blown off' or that requests were treated in a cavalier manner.\"202\nAfter our own review of the record, we agree with the trial court in its assessment\n\nof the District's actions and its level of culpability.\n\n       Hood argues that the trial court abused its discretion, because it failed \"to\ngive dueweight tothe negligent degree towhich District employees lacked training\nand oversight.\"203 Hood asserts that the use of counsel should only mitigate\npenalties if counsel does not make significant errors and that \"[ignoring [the]\nDistrict's liability for counsel's failures is an abuse ofdiscretion.\"204 But reliance on\n\n\n199 CP at 225.\n200 Appellant's Am.

Moreover, Hood overlooks the fact that the court\n\nawarded a minor increase in the penalty for lack of training. This was all within its\n\ndiscretion.\n\n       Hood argues that the court abused its discretion when it failed to impose a\n\n\"reasonable alternative\" to his proposed penalty awards.205 He contends that the\n\ntrial court should have considered the District's available economic resources\n\nrather than its size in determining what would be necessary to deter future\n\nmisconduct.206 But as the Supreme Court indicated in Yousoufian II. size of the\n\nagency may be a relevant consideration. 168 Wn.2d at 467.\n       Hood argues that the trial court erred \"by overlooking, ignoring or\nmisunderstanding many violations and minimally penalized them by lumping them\ntogether as 'technical non-compliance.'\"207 He contends that an agency will not be\ndeterred from future violations that the trial court \"vaguely labels as 'technical non\n\ncompliance' and does not appropriately penalize.\"208 With this argument, Hood is\nreferring to the trial court's determination that the per day penalty was sufficient \"to\naddress any and all issues related to the District's belated production of this\nmaterial, as well as any technical non-compliance with any provision ofthe Act.\"20*\nHood's argument is not persuasive. Essentially, the trial court determined thatany\n\n\n\n205 Appellant's Am. Opening Br. at 60.\n206 Appellant's Am. Opening Br. at 60.\n207 Appellant's Am. Opening Br. at 43.\n208 Appellant's Am.

Because Hood's other asserted violations lack\n\nevidentiary support or were minor, this was not an abuse of discretion.\n\n                          Groups 1 and 5 Penalty Period\n\n       Hood argues that the court erred in calculating the lengths of time of the\n\nviolations.210   Specifically, he asserts that \"[b]ecause the District withheld\n\ndocuments responsive to Hood's July 2011 requests until September 24, 2014, the\n\ntrial court abused its discretion by not extending the Group 1 penalty period to\n\n1,172 calendar days.\"211 For the same reason, he also contends that the court\n\nshould have extended the Group 5 penalty period to 1,058 days.212\n\n       We reject this argument. Hood failed to develop this argument at the trial\n\ncourt and fails to fully develop it on appeal. For this reason, we conclude that the\n\ntrial court did not err when it calculated the penalty period.\n\n                               Motion for Reconsideration\n\n        Hood assigns error to the denial of his motion for reconsideration.213 In his\noutline of the issues, he asserts that the motion for reconsideration \"showed that\n\nthe District's searches were unreasonable and the penalty period should have\n\nbeen extended to September 29, 2014.\"214\n\n        But Hood fails to present any argument about this assignment of error and\n\nissue in his briefing. \"A party waives an assignment oferror not adequatelyargued\n\n\n\n\n210 Appellant's Am.

RCW 42.56.550(4). The amount of attorney fees is within the\n\ndiscretion of the trial court. Sanders. 169 Wn.2d at 867. To calculate attorney\n\nfees, courts use the lodestar method, in which the court multiplies a reasonable\n\nattorney rate by a reasonable number of hours worked. Sanders. 169 Wn.2d at\n\n869. In determining a reasonable number of hours, the court \"discounts hours\n\nspent on unsuccessful claims, duplicated effort, or otherwise unproductive time.\"\nO'Neill v. Citv of Shoreline. 183 Wn.

App. 110, 120, 231\n\nP.3d 219 (2010).\n\n        Here, in his initial motion for attorney fees and costs, Hood stated that he\n\n\"prevailed on approximately 50 [percent] of his claims\" and had invoiced $85,436\n\nin attorney fees and $3,174.86 in costs.216 He requested that the court \"find the\n\npercentage of the fees and costs requested reasonable.\"217 As the trial court later\n\nindicated, it was not clear whether Hood was requesting all of the invoiced fees\n\nand costs or only a reasonable percentage of the fees and costs.\n\n        Thereafter, Hood and the District entered into a stipulation.218 They agreed\n\nthat Hood would withdraw his request for costs incurred after January 7, 2014.219\n\nThus, the fees at issue were $10,320 in attorney fees and $283.95 in costs.220\n        The trial court found that \"most of the time spent during the period in\n\nquestion was for preliminary investigation and discovery purposes, which time\n\ncould not reasonably be segregated among claims or theories.\"221\n         The trial court then calculated the lodestar. It found that Hood's attorney\n\nspent 34.4 hours of attorney time between October29, 2013 and January 7, 2014,\n\n\n\n\n216   CPat   132.\n217   CPat   135.\n218   CPat   2791.\n219   CPat   2791.\n220 CPat 42, 128.\n221 CP at 42.\n\n                                          43\n\fNo. 73165-3-1/44\n\n\nand it found this to be reasonable.222 The trial court also found that the attorney's\n\nhourly rate, $300, was reasonable.223\n\n           Finally, the trial court determined that Hood's claimed fees based on the\n\nlodestar should be reduced because \"Hood prevailed on less than 2 [percent] of\n\nthe penalties he sought,\" and because \"Hood only prevailed on the claims that\n\nsome documents were not timely produced pursuant to the requests in July and\n\nNovember of 2011, and to a minor extent on the issue of the aggravating factor of\n\nlack of proper training and supervision.\"224 The trial court noted that Hood lost on\n\nat least seven other issues.225 Accordingly, the trial court concluded that a 50\n\npercent reduction in the amount of attorney fees was appropriate.226\n\n           As stated earlier, the court must discount hours for unsuccessful claims,\n\nduplicated or wasted effort, or otherwise unproductive time.               Bowers v.\n\nTransamerica Title Ins. Co.. 100 Wn.2d 581, 597, 675 P.2d 193 (1983). But a\n\ncourt accomplishes this by discounting hours when calculating the lodestar. See\n\nChuong Van Pham v. Citv of Seattle. 159 Wn.2d 527, 539, 151 P.3d 976 (2007).\n\nAfter the lodestar has been calculated, adjustments to the lodestar are appropriate\n\nunder two broad categories—the contingent nature of success and the quality of\n\nwork performed. Bowers. 100 Wn.2d at 598.\n\n           Here, the trial court did not discount hours for unsuccessful claims when it\n\ncalculated the lodestar.

With the parties consent, the trial court\n\nconducted a hearing in this case on the basis of documentary evidence. The trial\ncourt concluded that Hood was entitled to a penalty award of $7,150 for the\n\nDistrict's untimely production of certain documents.1 It rejected Hood's other\nclaims.2 The court also concluded that Hood was entitled to $5,309.95 in attorney\n\nfees and costs.3\n\n       Hood appeals the underlying judgment and the award ofattorney fees. He\nargues that the trial court erred when it determined that the District's search for\nresponsive records was reasonable, penalized the District \"only for untimely\ndisclosures while ignoring other violations,\" denied his proposed groupings for\npenalties, erroneously applied mitigating and aggravating factors to its penalty\n\n\n\n\n1Clerk's Papers (CP) at 241.\n2 CP at 3100.\n3 CP at 46.\n\fNo. 73165-3-1/2\n\n\ncalculations, and erroneously calculated the penalty period.4 He also claims that\n\nthe trial court should have granted all of his requested attorney fees.\n\n       Based on our de novo review, we conclude that the trial court did not err\n\nexcept when it calculated Hood's award of attorney fees and costs. Accordingly,\n\nwe affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.\n\n                                      FACTS\n\n       Hood worked as a teacher for the District from 1996 to 2010.5 In 2010, the\n\nDistrict decided not to renew Hood's teaching contract.6 Through his union, Hood\n\nchallenged the decision in binding arbitration.7 An arbitrator upheld the District's\n\nnon-renewal decision.8      Hood subsequently filed multiple lawsuits against the\n\nDistrict in federal court.9 Hood also made numerous public records requests of the\n\nDistrict under the Public Records Act (PRA).10 The District's responses to those\n\nrequests are the subject of this lawsuit.\n\n       Hood began requesting public records from the District in June 2011.11 That\nyear, Hood requested records on June 16, July 1, July 7, July 10, and July 14.12\nBy August 5, Hood had made 25 different requests.13 Hood made additional record\nrequests on August 18 and November 1 of that year.14\n\n\n\n4 Appellant's Am.

For example,\n\nin 2011, the District responded on June 17, July 5, July 9, July 12, July 20, July 28,\n\nAugust 5, August 17, August 22, September 6, September 7, September 9,\n\nSeptember 14, September 20, October 14, November 7, December 14, and\n\nDecember 21,24 In 2012, the District responded on January 2, June 21, September\n\n11, September 26, October 12, October 22, October 23, October 31, November 3,\nNovember 8, November 19, November 20, November 27, November 29,\n\nDecember 12, and December 19.25 In 2013, the District responded on January\n\n25, January 31, February 5, February 14, February 20, March 12, March 14, March\n25, and May 2.26 In 2014, the District responded on February 5, February 14,\nFebruary 20, February 28, March 12, and March 14.27 Hood and the District\nexchanged e-mails during these time frames as well.\n          The District provided thousands of records in response to Hood's\nrequests.28 In 2011, the District provided records on July 20, July 27, August 16,\nAugust 31, September 7, September 20, October 14, and December 16.29 In 2012,\nthe District provided records January 2, June 21, September 11, October 9,\nOctober 16, November

25,\n\nand May 2.31 In 2014, the District provided records on February 5, February 28,\n\nand March 14.32\n\n        In June 2012, Hood commenced this action against the District in Island\n\nCounty Superior Court.33 Among other things, Hood alleged that the District\n\nviolated the PRA when it responded to his July 2011 record requests.34 In August\n\n2013, Hood filed an amended complaint against the District alleging many\n\nadditional violations of the PRA when it responded to his later requests.35\n\n         In March 2014, Hood moved for summary judgment.36 He argued that the\n\nDistrict violated the PRA in numerous ways when it responded to his requests from\n\nJune 2011, July 2011, November 1, 2011, June 19, 2012, September 11, 2012,\nOctober 10, 2012, October 16, 2012, October 18, 2012, November 15, 2012,\n\nJanuary 24, 2013, and January 28, 2013.37 He proposed grouping the violations\ninto nine different groups, and he sought a total penalty award of $390,795.38 With\nhis motion, Hood submitted affidavits from himself and from his attorney.39\n         The District responded and argued that its searches were reasonable, that\nHood's allegations were speculative, insufficient, and meritless, and that Hood's\n\n\n\n\n30 CP at 226, 903-07.\n31 CP at 226, 895-96, 907-09.\n32 CP at 226, 896, 909-10.\n33 CP   at   2816.\n34 CP   at   2816.\n35 CP

the\n\nDistrict submitted declarations from several District employees and attorneys.\n\n        On June 27, 2014, the matter proceeded to a hearing.41 The parties agreed\n\nthat the hearing on the merits could be conducted on the basis of affidavits\n\npursuant to RCW 42.56.550(3).42 Thus, with the parties' consent, the court\n\nconducted a trial on the basis of the submitted papers.43 The court explicitly stated\n\nthat it \"balanced and weighed the evidence\" and \"resolved all material factual\n\nissues and issues of credibility, as it would if it had heard oral testimony.\"44\n        On September 15, 2014, the trial court issued its memorandum decision.45\nIt determined that Hood was entitled to penalty award of $4,890 for the District's\n\nuntimely production of documents in response to Hood's June 2011 requests and\nHood's July 2011 requests.46 It also determined that Hood was entitled to a penalty\naward of $2,260 for the District's untimely production of documents in response to\nHood's November 1, 2011 request.47 It rejected the remainder of Hood's claims.48\n         On December 15, 2014, the trial court entered comprehensive findings of\nfact and conclusions of law.49 It also entered final judgment, which granted Hood's\n\n\n\n\n40 CP at 764-808.\n41 CPat218.\n42 CP at 218, 3060.\n43 CP at 219, 3060.\n44 QD gt 219\n45 CP at 219, 3060-3100.\n46 CP   at

    Hood subsequently moved for reconsideration.51        He claimed that the\n\ndiscovery of five additional e-mails constituted newly discovered evidence\n\nestablishing that the District's searches in response to Hood's July and November\n\n2011 requests were not reasonable.52 In a written decision, the court rejected\n\nthese arguments and denied Hood's motion.53          It entered an order denying\n\nreconsideration.54\n\n         Hood moved for attorney fees and costs.55 In March 2015, the trial court\n\nentered its findings offact, conclusions oflaw, and order on this motion.56 Thetrial\ncourt concluded that Hood was entitled to an award of attorney fees and costs, but\n\nit declined to award Hood his full requested amount.57 It reduced the amount of\n\nattorney fees requested by 50 percent and awarded Hood $5,309.95.58\n         Hood appeals.\n\n                                    ANALYSIS\n\n         The PRA \"is a strongly worded mandate for broad disclosure of

In general, they describe the procedure employed to identify\n\nindividuals likely to have responsive records, the likely location of records, and the\n\nsearch terms utilized to search for records.\n\n       Of particular interest are the declarations of Josephine Moccia, the District\n\nSuperintendent, and Brian Miller, the DistrictTechnology Manager.\n\n       Moccia personally oversaw the District's response to each of Hood's public\n\nrecords requests after her arrival in the District in July 2011.70 Moccia consulted\n\nwith the individual District staff members directly responsible for gathering\n\nresponsive records, directed individuals with personal knowledge of potentially\nresponsive records to gather those records, and in some instances, personally\nsearched for responsive records within her direct control.71\n       Moccia testified that in response to Hood's July 2011 requests, she directed\n\nMiller to work with legal counsel \"to identify key search terms and potential record\ncustodians and then to search those custodians' electronic files for responsive\n\nrecords.\"72      The potential custodians included current and former District\nadministrative staff, the District's board members, and the teachers, counselors,\n\nand union representatives identified by Hood.73\n       Moccia testified that individual District staff members also searched their\n\ncomputer files for responsive records.74        For example, Moccia directed her\n\n\n\n70 CP at 419.\n71 CPat419.\n72 CP at 2812.\n73 CP at 2812.\n74 CP at 2813.\n\n

for the specific programs identified\n\nin Hood's requests were directed to locate and assemble potentially responsive\n\nrecords.76 Likewise, school and administrative staff from Hood's former school\n\nwere directed to locate and assemble potentially responsive records.77\n\n        The District's outside counsel reviewed the assembled records in July,\n\nAugust, September, and October 2011.78 Exempt records were withheld and\n\nlogged as additional responsive records were gathered.79 The District provided\nresponsive, non-exempt records in several installments between July and October\n\n2011.80\n\n         Moccia testified that Hood's November 2011 requests were \"largely\n\nduplicative\" of his July 2011 requests.81 Nonetheless, Moccia directed Miller and\nother central office staff to locate and assemble responsive records.82 Further,\n\nschool and administrative staff from Hood's former school \"were again directed to\n\nlocate and assemble potentially responsive records.\"83\n\n\n\n\n75 CP   at   2813.\n76 CP   at   2813.\n77 CP   at   2813.\n78 CP   at   2813.\n79 CP   at   2813-14.\n80 CP   at   2814.\n81 CP   at   2815.\n82 CP   at   2815.\n83 CP at 2815,

non-exempt records responsive to his November 2011\n\nrequests in several installments between December 2011 and January 2012.85\n        After Hood filed this lawsuit against the District in 2012 alleging violations\n\nof the PRA in responding to his July 2011 requests, Moccia carefully reviewed the\n\nallegations in his complaint.86 In response to his allegations, Moccia \"directed that\nthe District undertake another review of its files to ensure that no responsive, non-\n\nexempt records were inadvertently withheld\" from Hood.87 During this search, the\nDistrict discovered a file of binders Moccia's predecessor maintained.88 After\n\nreviewing these records, the District produced additional records to Hood in\nSeptember 2012.89\n\n         Between June 2012 and February 2013, Moccia continued to receive\n\ndozens of public records requests from Hood.90 Many of these requests were\nduplicative \"to the broadest parts of [Hood's] July 2011 and November 2011 public\nrecord requests\" as well as his other requests.91\n         In response to Hood's continued requests, Moccia \"directed the completion\nof additional searches of the District's computer systems by [Miller] and other\nDistrict technology support staff.\"92 Moccia testified that District administrators,\n\n\n\n84 CP   at 2815.\n85 CP   at 2815-16.\n86 CP   at 2816.\n87 CP   at 2817.\n88 CP   at 2817.\n89

members were \"notified\n\nof requests related to them and requested to search for and produce any additional\n\nrecords responsive to Hood's specific requests.\"93 For example, upon receiving\n\nHood's requests for records regarding an alleged state audit of the District, Moccia\n\nasked the District's Assistant Superintendent for Business to locate responsive\n\nrecords.94 And when asked by Hood for records regarding student attendance at\n\nBayview School, she asked the director of the school and his secretarial staff to\nlocate responsive records.95\n\n       Moccia testified that the District spent hundreds of hours of staff and\n\nattorney time and thousands of dollars responding to Hood's requests.96 She\nfurther testified:\n\n        Throughout the process of responding to [Hood's] numerous\n        requests, I fully intended that the District provide [Hood] all\n        identifiable, responsive, non-exempt records that the District located.\n        I believe that the District's searches and productions were\n        reasonable in their scope and conducted with diligence and in good\n        faith. Ihave no personal motivation to withhold material from [Hood]\n        or to not disclose the records he requested. I have not intentionally\n        destroyed any records that [Hood] was requesting or directed that\n        anyone else destroy or not disclose records to [Hood] to prevent him\n        from accessing such records. Any errors in the District's search and\n        production processes were inadvertent and not the result of any\n        intention to hinder [Hood's] access to public records from the\n        District.!97^\n\n\n\n\n 93 CP at 2819.\n 94 CP at 2819.\n 95 CP at 2819.\n 96 CP at 2820, 2814.\n 97 CP at 2820.\n\n                                          16\n\fNo. 73165-3-1/17\n\n\n           Miller's declaration provides even greater detail than Moccia's declaration.\n\nMiller worked as the District's Technology Manager from 1993 to 2012 and then\n\nworked as the District's Director of Facilities and Operations.98\n\n           In response to Hood's July 2011 requests, Miller worked with the District's\n\nlegal counsel to locate responsive records from the District's electronic\n\ndatabases.99 Miller testified that he worked with the District's attorney to identify\n\nkey search terms and potential record custodians for each request.100 He then\nsearched each of those custodians' electronic mail accounts for records.101\n\n           With his declaration, Miller provided a copy of the processing matrix he\n\ncreated to track his work on the July 2011 requests.102 This detailed matrix lists\n\nseveral categories of information.103 It provides (1) a description ofeach of Hood's\n\nrequests, (2) the relevant date range for each request, (3) the searchterms utilized\nfor each request, (4) the systems searched, and (5) the potential custodians for\neach request.104 With respect to Hood's July 2011 requests, the matrix shows that\nMiller searched the accounts of at least 40 individuals.105\n\n           Miller testified that he spent over 60 hours \"carefully searching and\n\nreviewing email files for [Hood's] requests in the summer and fall of 2011 .\"106 He\nsearched the personal e-mail accounts ofeach identified custodian onthe District's\n\n\n\n98 CP at 2793.\n99 CP at 2794.\n100 CP at 2794.\n101 CP at 2794.\n102 CP at 2794,

server,\" a commercial product used to manage employees'\n\ncommunication and personal organization tools, such as e-mail, calendaring, and\n\npersonal contacts.107\n\n      Around March 2011, the District changed its e-mail from FirstClass to\n\n\"Google Apps, a cloud-based electronic mail system.\"108 Unlike the FirstClass\nsystem, the District did not maintain physical control over the e-mail server.109\nNonetheless, Miller also searched for e-mails in the Google Apps program.110\nDuring the search process, hediscovered that the Google Apps program was only\nsaving e-mails for a period of 45 days after their creation.111 Miller reported the\nproblem to Google and it was addressed going-forward.112 However, due to this\nerror, there is a period of time for which the District's e-mails were not archived.113\n       After assembling all responsive electronic records located in his searches,\nMiller provided them to the District's counsel for review.114 Miller ultimately\nprovided three CD-ROMs (compact disc, read-only memory) to Hood containing\nall of the non-exempt records that Miller was able to locate in response to Hood's\nJuly 2011 requests.115\n       In response to Hood's November 2011 requests, Miller duplicated the\nsearch efforts described earlier, using new search terms and time periods.116 With\n\n\n107 CP at 2795.\n108 CP at 2796.\n109 CP

73165-3-1/19\n\n\nhis declaration, Miller included the processing matrix he used to track his work on\n\nthese requests.117 This matrix, like the other, provides the same five categories of\n\ninformation, including the relevant search terms and potential custodians.118 Once\n\nMiller had assembled records responsive to Hood's November 2011 requests and\n\nthe District's counsel had reviewed them, he prepared another CD-ROM for\n\nproduction to Hood.119\n\n           In response to Hood's continued requests in September and October 2012,\n\nMiller searched both of the District's electronic mail systems—FirstClass and\n\nGoogle Apps—to locate any potentially responsive records.120 He searched in the\n\naccounts of likely custodians of responsive records based on the individuals\n\nidentified in Hood's requests.121 With his declaration, Miller included a copy of the\n\nprocessing matrix he created to track his work on these requests.122 Like the\nothers, this matrix reflects the same categories of information, including the\n\nrelevant search terms and potential custodians searched.123\n\n           Finally, Miller testified as follows:\n\n           Throughout the process of responding to [Hood's] requests, I have\n           conducted all searches to the best of my ability, I have pulled and\n           reviewed all responsive documents located by my searches, and I\n           have worked with the District Superintendent and its counsel to\n           provide all records located. I have no personal reason to withhold\n           material from [Hood] or not to disclose the records he requested. No\n           one has ever asked me to destroy records that [Hood] requested or\n           suggested that records not be disclosed to him. To the contrary, my\n           direction from the Superintendent has always been to disclose all\n\n117 CP at 2798, 2804.\n118   CP   at   2804.\n119   CP   at   2798.\n120   CP   at   2798-99.\n121   CP   at   2799.\n122 CP at 2799, 2806.\n123 CP at 2806.\n\n                                                   19\n\fNo. 73165-3-1/20\n\n\n       responsive, non-exempt records. To the best of my knowledge and\n       ability, that is exactly what I did.[124]\n\n       After reviewing the record, we are convinced that the trial court properly\n\ndetermined that the District's searches were adequate.           These nonconclusory\n\ndeclarations from District employees provide significant detail about the type of\n\nsearch performed, the search terms utilized, and the locations searched. On these\n\nfacts, it is clear that the District's searches were reasonably calculated to uncover\n\nall relevant documents.\n\n\n       Hood presents a number of arguments challenging the declarations of the\n\nDistrict's employees. In general, he contends that their testimony was unreliable\n\nand incredible and that it misled the trial court.125 We reject all of his arguments.\n\n       Hood argues that Moccia's statement that she directed Terhar to search\n\nTerhar's computer for responsive records is contradicted by Terhar's statement\n\nthat she failed to perform a global search of her computer.126 But Terhar also\n\ntestified that if Hood's requests \"pertained to anything that [she] might have had\n\non [her] computer, [she] would search for it.\"127 This is consistent with Moccia's\n\nstatement.\n\n\n       Hood argues that the District's failure to search the files of Sue Raley, a\n\nteacher, was unreasonable.128        But as the trial court correctly noted, \"it was\n\nreasonable for the District to believe that a fellow teacher would not have District\n\n\n\n\n124 CP at 2799.\n125 Appellant's Am.

But these two declarations merely establish that in summer 2014,\n\nthese employees searched their files for records responsive to Hood's 2014\n\nrequests and found e-mail correspondence from summer 2011.131 These facts do\n\nnot negate Moccia's assertion that individual staff members searched their\n\ncomputer files for records responsive to Hood's July and November 2011\n\nrequests.132\n\n       Hood argues that the District was obligated to search the individual\n\ncomputer files of any person who might have stored records because the District\n\nknew its e-mail system auto-deleted e-mails.133 But Moccia testified that individual\n\nstaff members searched their computer files.134 This was sufficient.\n\n       Hood argues that the untimely disclosure of e-mails shows that the\n\nsearches were unreasonable.135 He also argues that the production of District\n\nrecords by other agencies shows that the searches were unreasonable.136 He is\nincorrect on both accounts.

Yet these records were produced in response to\n           his July 2011 requests, and are thus encompassed by Group 1. The\n           Court finds no legitimate basis for increased or duplicative penalties\n           based on the fact that the records were produced after litigation was\n           initiated.

Hood argues that penalties should\n       be assessed because the District initially asserted the deliberative\n       process exemption of RCW 42.56.280 as the basis for withholding\n       the documents, and this exemption didn't apply. But the District later\n       asserted the work product and attorney-client privileges exemption\n       for the withholding of the documents, and it was entitled to do so.\n       [Sanders, 169 Wn.2d at 849-50]; fPAWS. 125 Wn.2d at 253.] The\n       Court has conducted an in camera review of the documents Hood\n       identified as potentiallywrongfully withheld, and has determined that\n       they are all exempt from disclosure. To the extent that Hood argues\n       that the District's production of some exempt documents prevents it\n       from asserting exemptions to other documents, this is plainly\n\n151 Appellant's Am.

Under Sanders, the production of exempt documents does\n       not necessarily waive exemptions as to other documents. 169\n       Wn.2d at 847-50. The Court finds no waiver in the present case.\n       Group 3 is not a valid grouping for this case.[155]\n\n       The trial court's reasoning was correct. The trial court properly recognized\n\nthat the relevant consideration is whether the documents are exempt from\n\ndisclosure. Sanders. 169 Wn.2d at 849-50. If they are exempt, \"the agency's\n\nwithholding of them was lawful and its subsequent production of them irrelevant.\"\n\nSanders. 169 Wn.2d at 850. The trial court also properly recognized that the\n\nDistrict could assert a different exemption than the one initially claimed.\n\n       Our review of these documents confirms that a majority of them are exempt\n\nfrom disclosure under the work product exemption or the attorney-client privilege\n\nexemption.       Hood presents no persuasive argument to the contrary.          The\n\nremaining documents are not responsive to Hood's requests. Accordingly, the trial\n\ncourt properly concluded that the agency's withholding of those documents was\n\nlawful and the subsequent production of them was irrelevant. In short, the trial\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion when it rejected Group 3.\n\n                                         Group 4\n\n       The trial court rejected Hood's proposed Group 4, which consisted of\n\ndocuments disclosed by other agencies. According to Hood, these documents\n\nshow \"that the District silently withheld [these documents] for a period of 604 days\n\nand/or destroyed them.\"156 For this group, Hood requested $100 per day and a\n\ntotal penalty of $60,400.157\n\n\n155 CP at 229.\n156 Appellant's Am.

The basis for Hood's argument\n       appears to be that various documents were provided to him by other\n       agencies in response to other public records requests, and therefore\n       that the District must be intentionally silently withholding identical\n       records. Hood's speculation has no record support, and the Court\n       finds that additional penalties based on this speculation are\n       unwarranted. Furthermore, to the extent they existed and were\n       untimely produced, any such documents are already included in\n       Groups 1 and 5 and are fully addressed in the penalties the Court\n       will award for those groups.11581\n\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it rejected this group.\n\n\"Purely speculative claims about the existence and discoverability of other\n\ndocuments will not overcome an agency affidavit, which is accorded a presumption\n\nof good faith.\" Forbes v.

For this group,\n\nHood requested $50 per day and a total penalty of $26,200.160\n\n         The trial court rejected Group 6 for the following reason:\n\n         Hood argues that certain documents he requested were of public\n         importance, and requests increased penalties for his proposed\n         Group 6 on this basis. The Court has determined that Hood's\n         assertions are largely without merit, as detailed below. The Court\n         does not find any legitimate basis for heightened penalties based on\n         the alleged public importance of any of Hood's requests.\n         Furthermore, any such records are subsumed in Groups 1 and 5 and\n         are fully addressed in the penalties the Court will award for those\n         groups.[161]\n\n         The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it rejected this proposed\n\ngroup. The trial court \"fully accounted\" for any public importance of these records\nwhen it considered this as an aggravating factor in assessing penalties.162 Hood\n\nfails to persuasively explain why the alleged public importance of the documents\n\nfactor should constitute its own freestanding penalty.\n\n\n\n\n159   CP at   934.\n160   CP at   935.\n161   CP at   230.\n162   CPat    237.\n\n                                           28\n\fNo. 73165-3-1/29\n\n\n                                         Group 7\n\n      The trial court rejected Hood's proposed Group 7, which consisted of\n\nallegedly undisclosed metadata.163 Hood argues that the District ignored his\n\nrequests for metadata \"by providing only minimal header metadata for emails and\n\nabsolutely none for non-email documents.\"164 For this group, he requested the\n\nmaximum, $100 per day, and a total penalty of $99,200.165\n      The trial court rejected Group 7 for the following reasons:\n\n       Hood claims that he requested metadata in connection with many of\n       his requests, and that the District has not provided such metadata.\n       His proposed Group 7 seeks penalties for the alleged failure to\n       produce metadata. In his email to Superintendent Moccia on July 7,\n       2011, Hood stated: \"Note that all requests below include an explicit\n       request for metadata (Fields for the 'To', 'From', and 'cc' are all\n       recipients and are considered 'metadata.'

Hood\n       received an email from the Arlington School District in response to\n       one of his records requests to that agency that also shows server\n       routing information for the electronic communication in addition tothe\n       header information. Hood did not contest the District's assertions\n       thatthis allegedly \"missing\" metadata does not supply any additional\n       substantive content to the email communication. The Court finds that\n       the server routing information Hood identifies as the metadata\n       missing from the District's productions is immaterial to the actual\n       substantive content of the records he requested.\n\n       Further, the Court finds that the District included the metadata\n       reasonably available to it and of the type explicitly requested by Hood\n       in its responses to Hood's requests. The Court finds thatthe District\n       complied with Hood's requests for metadata. Further, even if the\n       District could have technically provided Hood a greater quantity or\n       additional types of metadata, the Court finds that no additional\n       penalties are appropriate in this regard.11661\n\n\n163 CP at 935.\n164 Appellant's Am.

The District provided the type of metadata that Hood\n\nspecifically requested. Further, Miller expressly testified in his deposition that the\n\ne-mails he printed out in response to Hood's requests all had metadata.167 He\n\nidentified metadata as \"[t]he header at the top, printed by, title, date, time, [and\n\npage number.]\"168 Miller also testified that he did not know if it was possible to\n\nretrieve the additional metadata Hood now asserts should have been provided.169\n\n       The trial court did not separately analyze the District's compliance with\n\nHood's requests for metadata for non e-mail documents. But, based on our review\n\nof the record, we see no evidence that the District is \"intentionally\" and \"silently\"\n\nwithholding metadata for non e-mail documents. Hood's claims to the contrary are\n\nspeculative. In any event, the trial court also made it clear that even if the District\ncould have provided Hood with additional metadata, it would not have awarded\nany additional penalties. The court viewed the penalty awarded as sufficient to\naddress any violation based on metadata. This was within the trial court's\ndiscretion.\n\n                                       Group 8\n\n       The trial court rejected Hood's proposed Group 8, which consisted of\nrecords on a CD-ROM, labeled July 27, 2011.170 Forthis group, Hood sought the\n\nmaximum per day penalty, $100, and a total penalty of $96,250.171\n       The trial court rejected Group 8 for the following reason:\n\n167 CPat 1217.\n168 CPat 1218.\n169 CPat 1218.\n170 CPat 935, 231.\n171 CP at 935.\n\n                                          30\n\fNo. 73165-3-1/31\n\n\n\n\n       Hood's proposed Group 8 relates to the alleged late production of a\n       CD-ROM labeled with the date 7/27/11. There is no dispute that\n       Hood received a copy of this CD on February 28, 2014. The District's\n       evidence indicates that it believed that the CD had already been\n       produced to Hood on August 16, 2011. Regardless ofwhether Hood\n       received the CD itself for the first time in August 2011 or February\n       2014, the record reflects that its contents were either produced to\n       him as part of previous productions or were exempt. In any event,\n       the record supports a finding that any of the responsive records on\n       the 7/27/11 CD are appropriately accounted for within Groups 1 and\n       5, and the Court declines to award additional penalties for this\n       material beyond those calculated below.[172]\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it rejected this group. Hood\n\ndoes not challenge the assertion that these records fall within Groups 1 and 5.\nRather, he contends that the court abused its discretion \"by ignoring both the\nseverity of this violation and Hood's justification for making it a separate group.\"173\nBut the court was entitled to reject Hood's arguments. He provides no persuasive\n\nargument to the contrary.\n\n                                          Group 9\n\n        The trial court rejected Hood's proposed Group 9 for various statutory\nviolations ofthe PRA.174 Hood claims that the District charged him money to view\nrecords, tried to charge him for other requests, and refused to provide records. For\nthis group, Hood requested $25 per day and a total penalty of $10,425.175\n        The trial court rejected Group 9 for the following reasons:\n\n        Hood's proposed Group 9 encompasses his allegations that the\n        District charged him to view records, tried to charge him for at least\n        one other request, and refused to provide records because of their\n        origin without justification.

Hood had requested a large set of\n       student attendance records, and the District located these records\n       and was prepared to make them available to him. However, the\n       records consisted of approximately 5,000 hard copy originals and\n       required redaction of identifying student information from every page\n       before they could be produced. See RCW 42.56.230(1). In an\n       attempt to accommodate Hood's request, the District made a\n       redacted exemplar of the student records and showed it to Hood on\n       December 18, 2012. After reviewing the exemplar, Hood chose to\n       narrow the scope of his request and the District prepared a first\n       installment of redacted attendance records for his review.        The\n       District did notcharge Hood to review that installment, butdid explain\n       that if Hood did not wish to pay for copies of the installment after he\n       had the chance to review the records, the District would close the\n       request.\n\n       Hood paid $11.10 for copies of the first installment of 74 redacted\n       attendance records. RCW 42.56.120 provides that no fee shall be\n       charged for the inspection of public records, nor for locating public\n       documents and making them available for copying. However, a\n       reasonable fee may be imposed for providing copies of public\n       records, and to the extent that the agency has not determined the\n       actual per page cost for photocopies, the agency may not charge in\n       excess of fifteen cents per page. Seventy-four pages (the number\n       of redacted attendance records prepared for Hood by the District)\n       times $0.15 perpage is $11.10, the amount Hood paid to the District.\n       Hood acknowledges that he came to an agreement with the District\n       avoiding further copying, and he did not request further installments.\n        It would be an exaltation of form over substance to impose a penalty\n        against the District where the records were prepared at Hood's\n        request, where he voluntarily paid the $11.10, and where he reached\n        an agreement with the District obviating the need for additional\n        installments.!1761\n\n        The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it rejected this group. The\n\ntrial court's recitation of the facts is supported by the record. Further, the trial\ncourt's reasoning provides a tenable basis for the court to conclude that additional\n\n\n 176 CP at 232-33.\n\n                                          32\n\fNo. 73165-3-1/33\n\n\nor heightened penalties for any statutory violations were not warranted.

The Yousoufian II court identified seven mitigating factors and nine\n\naggravating factors in determining PRA penalties.\n\n       The mitigating factors that may serve to decrease the penalty are\n\n       (1) a lack of clarity in the PRA request; (2) the agency's prompt\n       response or legitimate follow-up inquiry for clarification; (3) the\n       agency's good faith, honest, timely, and strict compliance with all\n       PRA procedural requirements and exceptions; (4) proper training\n       and supervision of the agency's personnel; (5) the reasonableness\n       of any explanation for noncompliance by the agency; (6) the\n       helpfulness of the agency to the requestor; and (7) the existence of\n       agency systems to track and retrieve public records.\n\nYousoufian II. 168 Wn.2d at 467 (footnotes omitted).\n\n       Conversely, the aggravating factors that may support increasing the penalty\n\nare\n\n\n       (1) a delayed response by the agency, especially in circumstances\n       making time of the essence; (2) lack of strict compliance by the\n       agency with all the PRA procedural requirements and exceptions; (3)\n       lack of proper training and supervision of the agency's personnel; (4)\n       unreasonableness of any explanation for noncompliance by the\n       agency; (5) negligent, reckless, wanton, bad faith, or intentional\n       noncompliance with the PRA by the agency; (6) agency dishonesty;\n       (7) the public importance of the issue to which the request is related,\n       where the importance was foreseeable to the agency; (8) any actual\n       personal economic loss to the requestor resulting from the agency's\n       misconduct, where the loss was foreseeable to the agency; and (9)\n       a penalty amount necessary to deter future misconduct by the\n       agency considering the size of the agency and the facts of the case.\n\nYousoufian II. 168 Wn.2d at 467-68 (footnotes omitted).\n\n       These factors \"may overlap, are offered only as guidance, may not apply\n\nequally or at all in every case, and are not an exclusive list of appropriate\n\n                                         34\n\fNo. 73165-3-1/35\n\n\nconsiderations.\" Yousoufian II. 168 Wn.2d at 468.

In 2011, the legislature amended the\nPRA to eliminate mandatory penalties. Lawsof 2011, ch. 273 § 1. The trial court\n\nacknowledged this, stating that \"the [legislature has vested [the court] with the\ndiscretion to award an appropriate penalty in an amount from zero to [$100] per\n\nday for such improper denials.\"180\n       The trial courtalso properly applied the Yousoufian II framework bycarefully\n\nconsidered the relevant mitigating and aggravating factors.\n\n\n179 CP at 239-40.\n180 CP at 238.\n\n                                          35\n\fNo. 73165-3-1/36\n\n\n         The court identified several mitigating factors in this case. It concluded that\n\nthe first mitigating factor—a lack of clarity in the PRA request—was applicable.181\n\nItfound that \"Hood made multiple, broad, overlapping, and occasionally duplicative\n\nrequests.\"182 It reasoned that \"[b]ecause of this, it was virtually inevitable that the\n\nDistrict would miss some of the records in its initial searches.\"183\n\n         The court also concluded that the second and third mitigating factors were\n\napplicable. These included the agency's prompt response and the agency's good\n\nfaith, honest, timely, and strict compliance with the PRA. The court reasoned that\n\nthe District's \"reasonably prompt responses to the majority of Hood's requests and\n\nits good faith efforts to comply with the PRA, including the retention of counsel to\n\nassist in responding to Hood, mitigate the penalties that should apply here.\"184\n         The court agreed with Hood that the lack of proper training and supervision\n\nby the District was an aggravating factor.185 But the court reasoned that the\ndecision to utilize legal counsel mitigated the District's lack of training.186\nAccordingly, it concluded that \"a minor increase in the penalty that would otherwise\nhave been imposed but for the lack of training of the [District's] personnel [was]\n\nappropriate.\"187\n\n         The court rejected several other aggravating factors proposed by Hood.\n\nThe court rejected Hood's argument that the District's unreasonable explanations\n\n\n\n 81 CP   at   237.\n 82 CP   at   237.\n 83 CP   at   237.\n 84 CP   at   237.\n 85 CP   at   233-34.\n 86 CP   at   233-34.\n 87 CP   at   234.\n\n                                            36\n\fNo. 73165-3-1/37\n\n\nfor instances of noncompliance was an aggravating factor.            It found that the\n\nDistrict's explanations for particular oversights in its searches and productions\n\nwere \"reasonable and fully understandable in light of the numerous broad and\n\noverlapping requests with which it was faced.\"188\n\n           The court rejected Hood's argument that the District's negligent, reckless,\n\nwanton, or bad faith conduct was an aggravating factor. It found that \"[t]he record\n\nas a whole shows that the District did, in fact, act in good faith at all times, was not\n\nnegligent, and provided reasonable explanations for its actions in response to\n\nHood's requests.\"189\n\n           The court rejected Hood's argument that his personal economic loss was\n\nan aggravating factor.       It found that Hood's assertion that he suffered actual\n\npersonal economic loss was frivolous.190\n\n           And the court rejected Hood's argument that the public importance of his\n\nrequests was an aggravating factor. It found that \"the overwhelming majority of\n\nHood's requests were directly related to his personal challenge to his nonrenewal\n\nas a teacher.\"191 It found and that the \"few requests that involved ostensibly public\n\nmatters were tied to the work of his former supervisors and his attempts to discredit\n\nthem.\"192 Itconcluded that this aggravating factor \"either does not apply, or applies\n\nonly minimally, in the present case\" and stated that it \"has fully accounted for this\n\nfactor in assessing an appropriate penalty against the District.\"193\n\n\n188   CP   at   234.\n189   CP   at   235.\n190   CP   at   235.\n191   CP   at   236.\n192   CP   at   236.\n193   CP   at   237.\n\n                                            37\n\fNo. 73165-3-1/38\n\n\n\n           After considering the relevant mitigating and aggravating factors, the court\n\nthen considered the other relevant factors identified in Yousoufian II. including the\n\namount necessary to effectively deter future misconduct.194\n\n           The court declined to adopt Hood's proposed multiplier of 15 for Group 1,\n\nwhich would have resulted in a penalty of $75 per day, and Hood's proposed\n\nmultiplier of 12 for Group 5, which would have resulted in a penalty of $60 per\n\nday.195 The court declined to impose these multipliers because Hood suffered no\n\neconomic loss, his requests did not concern matters of public importance, and the\n\nDistrict was \"by no means intransigent in its responses.\"196\n           The court also reasoned that the $5 per day penalty was \"appropriate and\n\nprovides adequate incentive to induce future District compliance with the[PRA].\"197\nThe court explained that the nature and size of the agency was a relevant\n\nconsideration. It stated:\n\n           The Court pointedly notes our Supreme Court's statement in\n           Yousoufian [111: \"The penalty needed to deter a small school district\n           and that necessary to deter a large county may not be the same.\"\n           [168 Wn.2d at 463.] This statement is directly applicable in the\n           present case. While District personnel had not received proper\n           training in PRA matters, the District, to its credit, engaged legal\n           counsel to assist in responding to Hood's requests.11981\n           The court noted that the District \"is a relatively small school district serving\n\napproximately 1,400 students in its school programs,\" the District's steady\ndecrease in student enrollment has led to a 15 percent drop in the District's budget\n\n\n\n194 See 168 Wn.2d at 461-63; CP at 238-241.\n195   CP   at   238-240.\n196   CP   at   238.\n197   CP   at   239.\n198   CP   at   238.\n\n                                              38\n\fNo. 73165-3-1/39\n\n\nduring the last six years, and the District does not have a dedicated full-time public\n\nrecords officer.199\n\n       Overall, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it\n\ndetermined that $5 per day was an appropriate penalty amount. The trial court's\n\nfactual determinations are supported by the evidence, and the court's reasoning\n\nshows that it properly and carefully applied the Yousoufian II framework.\n\n       Hood argues that a penalty determination \"should include consideration of\n\nculpability as a major factor.\"200 This is true. But the court did consider culpability\n\nas a factor, and it stated that \"[t]he record as a whole shows that the District did, in\n\nfact, act in good faith at all times, was not negligent, and provided reasonable\nexplanations for its actions in response to Hood's requests.\"201 As the court\nexplained in its written memorandum, \"This is by no means a case in which the\nrequester was 'blown off' or that requests were treated in a cavalier manner.\"202\nAfter our own review of the record, we agree with the trial court in its assessment\n\nof the District's actions and its level of culpability.\n\n       Hood argues that the trial court abused its discretion, because it failed \"to\ngive dueweight tothe negligent degree towhich District employees lacked training\nand oversight.\"203 Hood asserts that the use of counsel should only mitigate\npenalties if counsel does not make significant errors and that \"[ignoring [the]\nDistrict's liability for counsel's failures is an abuse ofdiscretion.\"204 But reliance on\n\n\n199 CP at 225.\n200 Appellant's Am.

Moreover, Hood overlooks the fact that the court\n\nawarded a minor increase in the penalty for lack of training. This was all within its\n\ndiscretion.\n\n       Hood argues that the court abused its discretion when it failed to impose a\n\n\"reasonable alternative\" to his proposed penalty awards.205 He contends that the\n\ntrial court should have considered the District's available economic resources\n\nrather than its size in determining what would be necessary to deter future\n\nmisconduct.206 But as the Supreme Court indicated in Yousoufian II. size of the\n\nagency may be a relevant consideration. 168 Wn.2d at 467.\n       Hood argues that the trial court erred \"by overlooking, ignoring or\nmisunderstanding many violations and minimally penalized them by lumping them\ntogether as 'technical non-compliance.'\"207 He contends that an agency will not be\ndeterred from future violations that the trial court \"vaguely labels as 'technical non\n\ncompliance' and does not appropriately penalize.\"208 With this argument, Hood is\nreferring to the trial court's determination that the per day penalty was sufficient \"to\naddress any and all issues related to the District's belated production of this\nmaterial, as well as any technical non-compliance with any provision ofthe Act.\"20*\nHood's argument is not persuasive.

It found that Hood's attorney\n\nspent 34.4 hours of attorney time between October29, 2013 and January 7, 2014,\n\n\n\n\n216   CPat   132.\n217   CPat   135.\n218   CPat   2791.\n219   CPat   2791.\n220 CPat 42, 128.\n221 CP at 42.\n\n                                          43\n\fNo. 73165-3-1/44\n\n\nand it found this to be reasonable.222 The trial court also found that the attorney's\n\nhourly rate, $300, was reasonable.223\n\n           Finally, the trial court determined that Hood's claimed fees based on the\n\nlodestar should be reduced because \"Hood prevailed on less than 2 [percent] of\n\nthe penalties he sought,\" and because \"Hood only prevailed on the claims that\n\nsome documents were not timely produced pursuant to the requests in July and\n\nNovember of 2011, and to a minor extent on the issue of the aggravating factor of\n\nlack of proper training and supervision.\"224 The trial court noted that Hood lost on\n\nat least seven other issues.225 Accordingly, the trial court concluded that a 50\n\npercent reduction in the amount of attorney fees was appropriate.226\n\n           As stated earlier, the court must discount hours for unsuccessful claims,\n\nduplicated or wasted effort, or otherwise unproductive time.
