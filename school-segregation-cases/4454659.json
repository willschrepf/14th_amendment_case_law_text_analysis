This Court should affirm the trial court’s Judgment because:\n\n       The trial Court properly admitted Exhibit “A”2 into evidence. This was a\n\nbench trial, and the trial judge did not commit error.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  At trial, Quitman Independent School District was represented by the same Counsel for Wood\nCounty, etal. (Mr. Jim Lambeth, with the Linebarger, Goggan firm). On appeal, Quitman ISD is\nrepresented by Mr. David Hudson, with the Perdue, Brandon firm. References to “Taxing\nEntities”, as utilized by Appellant in its brief, shall include all appellee taxing jurisdictions.\nReferences to “QISD” shall be limited to Quitman Independent School District. References to\nHydrogeo shall include both Hydrogeo, LLC and First Bank & Trust East Texas as Appellants.\n2\n  Reference to Exhibit “A” shall mean Tax Entities Exhibit “A” introduced at trial, also included\nin Appellant’s Brief at Appendix A.\n                                                1\n\f      Exhibit “A”, along with pre-trial discovery, put the defendant’s on notice of\n\nthe claim of Taxing Entities, and any typographical errors were cured by the\n\ntestimony of witnesses.\n\n      Taxing Entities met their burden of proof and established their prima facie\n\ncase with the admission into evidence of Exhibit “A”. To the extent Hydrogeo was\n\nable to successfully rebut that presumption (which is denied), Taxing Entities\n\nestablished through testimonial evidence facts sufficient to meet their burden and\n\nsupport the Court’s Judgment.\n\n      Taxing Entities had levied their tax on working interest, which is a real\n\nproperty interest, not a personal property interest. Taxing Entities obtained their\n\nJudgment on real property, entitling them to foreclosure of their tax lien, and any\n\nreferences to personal property are merely an irrelevant argument.\n\n\n\n       APPELLEE QUITMAN INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\n              REPLY TO APPELLANTS ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n                              ISSUE NO. 1 (restated)\n\nDid the trial court commit reversible error by admitting Plaintiffs’ Exhibit “A”\ninto evidence when the document had not been produced prior to trial, and\nwhen the taxing authorities failed to make any showing of good cause for their\nfailure to produce the document.\n\n      Appellant’s contention in this issue is that taxing entities prima facie case fails\n\nbecause Exhibit “A” was not offered pursuant to a discovery request and that the\n                                           2\n\ftrial court erred in admitting the document at trial and that admission of evidence\n\nconstitutes reversible error. The trial court’s evidentiary ruling can be reviewed on\n\nappeal for abuse of discretion. Parker Plaza West, LTD. v. Boniuk Invs., Ltd., 153\n\nS.W.3d 729, 734 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2005, no pet.) (citing Aluminum Co. of Am. V.\n\nBullock, 870 S.W.2d 2, 3 Tex. 1994)). It is an abuse of discretion for a trial court\n\nto rule arbitrarily, unreasonably, without regard to guiding legal principles, or\n\nwithout supporting evidence. Oscar Luis Lopez v. La Madeleine of Texas, Inc., 200\n\nS.W.3d 854, 860 (Tex.App-Dallas, no pet.) (citing Bocquet v. Herring, 972 S.W.2d\n\n19, 21 (Tex.1998)).\n\n      The evidentiary issue in this matter was the introduction of a “Certified Copy\n\nof Tax Records”, dated August 22, 2014. (2 R. R. p.7 line 15-20).\n\n      In a suit to collect delinquent taxes, Texas Tax Code (hereinafter “Tax Code”)\n\nSection 33.47(a) provides:\n\n      [T]he taxing unit’s current tax roll and delinquent tax roll or certified copies\n      of the entries showing the property and the amount of the tax and penalties\n      imposed and interest accrued constitute prima facie evidence that each\n      person charged with a duty relating to the imposition of the tax has complied\n      with all requirements of law and that the amount of tax alleged to be\n      delinquent against the property and the amount of penalties and interest\n      due on that tax as listed are the correct amounts.\n\n\n\n      In this case the Taxing Entities introduced the tax records described in Section\n\n33.47(a), creating a rebuttable presumption that the taxes were due, delinquent, and\n\n                                          3\n\funpaid. City of Bellaire v. Sewell, 426 S.W.3d 116, 120 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st.]\n\n2012, no pet.)\n\n      Appellants contention in their Issue No. 1 is that because the Certified Copy\n\nof Tax Records was not provided in discovery, the trial court erred in admitting that\n\nevidence over objection at trial without good cause effectively rebutting Taxing\n\nEntities prima facie case causing harmful error. “The purpose of the discovery rules\n\nis to encourage full discovery of the issues and facts before trial so that parties can\n\nmake realistic assessment of their respective positions in order to facilitate\n\nsettlements and prevent trial by ambush.” La Madeleine 200 S.W.3d at 860). In this\n\ncase there can be no contention of surprise or ambush at trial. Taxation is a fact of\n\nlife and Appellants knew or reasonably should have known that a tax liability was\n\ndue when served with citation. Taxing Units pleadings include claims for all\n\ndelinquent taxes penalties, interest, attorney’s fees, and costs. (See Original Petition,\n\nCR at 9). Additionally, tax records are certified public records with the seal of the\n\nappropriate official and Appellants had the same access to them as the Taxing Units.\n\nV.T.C.A., Tax Code Sec. 33.42(a, b); Vernon’s Ann.Texas Rules Civ.Proc., Rule\n\n193.6(a)(2).\n\n\n      Good cause for the admission of evidence is at the discretion of the Trial\n\nJudge. “The trial court has the discretion to determine whether the offering party\n\nhas met his burden of showing good cause to admit the testimony.” Wal-Mart\n\n                                           4\n\fStores, Inc. v. Tinsley, 998 S.W.2d 911 at 671 (Tex.App.—Texarkana 1999 no pet.).\n\nThe trial court here, exercising its discretion, overruled objections and admitted the\n\ntax records offered, Exhibit “A”, into evidence. (2 R.R. p. 9, line 5 – p. 9, line 13).\n\nFurthermore, Wal-Mart, 998 S.W.2d at 671, citing, Ramos v. Champlin Petroleum\n\nCo., 750 S.W.2d 873, 877 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 1998, pet. denied) recognizes\n\nthat the Trial Court can implicitly find good cause by simply admitting the evidence.\n\n\n      Because the Trial Court did not err in admitting Tax Records, and that\n\nadmission did not result in an improper judgment, a holding sustaining the Trial\n\nCourt’s admission of evidence should be affirmed.\n\n                              ISSUE NO. 2 (restated)\n\nDid the trial court err by holding taxing entities’ entire alleged tax lien\nenforceable against Hydrogeo, LLC, and First Bank & Trust East Texas when\ntaxing entities failed to segregate that portion of the lien which was\nunenforceable against Hydrogeo.\n\n\n      The argument raised in Issue #2 is based upon the erroneous assumption that\n\nthe value of the real estate (minerals in this case) is combined with the value of\n\npersonal property to establish one tax account. This is not the law, and all arguments\n\nfollowing from that erroneous assumption become moot.\n\n      The distinction and separation in the taxation of real estate (minerals in place)\n\nfrom personal property is set forth in Tax Code §11.01(a) for real estate and\n\n§11.01(b) for business personal property. The distinction is further echoed in §21.01\n\n                                          5\n\fproviding for the taxation of real estate by its situs (location) and §21.02 for the\n\ntaxation of personal property held for the production of income based upon its situs.\n\n      The reality in separating the taxation of real estate and personal property lies\n\nin the fact the real estate is permanently in place, whereas personal property can be\n\nmoved. In fact, special rules exist for the taxation of personal property to determine\n\nits situs for purposes of taxation as set forth in Tax Code §21.02(a). There are further\n\nrules for the taxation of personal property such as vessels and other watercraft\n\n(§21.021), railroad rolling stock (§21.04) and aircraft (§§21.05 and 21.055). There\n\nare no provisions in the Tax Code for including the value of “production equipment,\n\nsuch as casing, tubing, pump jacks tanks and surface pipelines” (p. 15 Appellant’s\n\nBrief) in the value of the underlying working interest (or royalty interest) of a\n\nmineral interest. The situs rules of §21.02(a) may have even resulted in the business\n\npersonal property of Hydrogeo being taxed in a different taxing jurisdiction: recall\n\nthe testimony of Mr. William E. Godsey, Jr., as owner of Hydrogeo, where he states\n\nthat if there is no longer any production he will “…take my equipment and use it on\n\nsome other leases”. (transcript p. 62). The personal property is clearly movable, and\n\nthere is nothing in the record to show the personal property of Hydrogeo had even\n\nacquired taxable situs in Wood County. It may have been taxable in Wood County,\n\nand it may have been taxable elsewhere; there is simply nothing in the Record to\n\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\fshow how, where, or if it was taxed. Certainly, there is no evidence that it was taxed\n\nas part of the real estate – only the argument of Hydrogeo.\n\n      A more accurate analysis of the taxation of the working interest presently\n\nowned by Hydrogeo and the existence of the business personal property at the well\n\nhead is as follows:\n\n      For each of the tax years in question (2009-2011) the Chief Appraiser of\n\nWood County appraised the real property (mineral working interests) the subject of\n\nthis appeal pursuant to Tax Code §25.01 and in compliance with §25.12. Any\n\nrequired notices of Appraised Value were mailed pursuant to Tax Code §25.19, and\n\nthe respective market values of the subject properties were certified to the taxing\n\nunits pursuant to Tax Code §26.01. Tax bills were mailed pursuant to Tax Code\n\n§33.01, and in the absence of payment, the taxes reflected in those bills became\n\ndelinquent and subject to penalties and interest authorized by Tax Code §33.01 and\n\n33.07. The admission into evidence of Taxing Entities Exhibit “A” established their\n\nprima facie case, Davis vs. City of Austin (Sup. 1982) 632 SW2d 331, and further\n\nestablished proper delivery of all required tax notices despite taxpayer’s assertion\n\nthat he did not receive any notices. See also Maximum Medical Imp., Inc. vs. County\n\nof Dallas (App. 5 Dist. 2008) 272 SW3d 832.\n\n      Of note, the Tax Code affords numerous rights to property owners beginning\n\nwith the Right of Protest authorized in Tax Code §41.41. Property owners can\n\n\n                                          7\n\fprotest all of the complaints raised by Hydrogeo, including (A) a determination of\n\nthe appraised value in §41.41(a)(1) to the extent Hydrogeo believed the real estate\n\nand personal property values were combined in one total, (B) inclusion of the\n\nowner’s property on the appraisal records (§41.41(a)(3)) or a determination that the\n\nproperty owner is the owner of the property (§41.41(a)(7)) to the extent Hydrogeo\n\nor any other property owner objected to their inclusion or exclusion from the\n\nAppraisal Roll (such as Steelman Investments, Inc.), and (C) the failure to even\n\nreceive the notice of appraised value as authorized by §41.411.\n\n      Affording some protections to property tax jurisdictions (and preventing a\n\ntaxpayer from suggesting “I don’t owe anything because you never sent me a\n\nstatement”), the Tax Code provides in §25.19(d) that the failure to receive a notice\n\nof appraised value “does not affect the validity of the appraisal of the property, the\n\nimposition of any tax…the existence of any tax lien…or any proceeding instituted\n\nto collect the tax”. Regarding tax bills, the Tax Code provides in §31.01(g) that the\n\nfailure to “receive the tax bill required by this section…does not affect the validity\n\nof the tax, penalty, or interest… the existence of a tax lien, or any procedure to collect\n\na tax”.\n\n      The Tax Code is replete with rights and remedies for the taxpayer, and\n\nprovides procedures for the taxpayer to exhaust their administrative remedies\n\nthrough the protest procedures set forth in the Tax Code (i.e. §41.41 to protest any\n\n\n                                            8\n\fissues with a tax appraisal, including the catch all §41.41(a)(9) “any other\n\naction…that applies to and adversely affects the property owner”. (emphasis added).\n\nThe administrative remedy provisions of the Tax Code are designed to resolve\n\nvaluation and description disputes on an administrative level (the taxpayer who\n\ncomplies with the law and follows the administrative remedy provisions can later\n\nfile suit pursuant to Tax Code 42.21 – not the facts here). In order to emphasize the\n\nrequirement of exhaustion of administrative remedies, the Tax Code provides in\n\n§42.09(a) that the protest procedures of the Tax Code are exclusive and may not be\n\nraised “in defense to a suit to enforce the collection of delinquent taxes….” Most of\n\nthe arguments raised by Hydrogeo are issues that should have been timely protested\n\nthrough the administrative remedies provisions of the Tax Code, and not raised as\n\ndefenses to the underlying delinquent tax suit.\n\n      Hydrogeo suggests that Taxing Entities live petition noted “the value of any\n\npersonal property that may be described above…” (emphasis added - Brief p. 16).\n\nAlthough the live petition of Taxing Entities “may” describe personal property, it\n\ndid not describe or identify any personal property; Exhibit “A” did not identify any\n\npersonal property, and the Judgment did not recover taxes on any described personal\n\nproperty. To the extent Taxing Entities may have sought taxes on personal property\n\n(which is denied), the Court’s Judgment notes in its final paragraph that “All relief\n\nprayed for in any of the pleadings in this cause which is not specifically granted by\n\n\n                                          9\n\fthis judgment is hereby denied”. (Appellant’s Brief, Appendix B). Hydrogeo raises\n\nissues (or imaginatively tries to create issues) and presents appellate arguments\n\nregarding the taxation of personal property that simply were not included in the\n\nJudgment.\n\n      A party seeking to be excused from the lawful obligation of paying taxes\n\nshould otherwise comply with the law, which brings us to one final note regarding\n\nthe personal property. Tax Code §22.01 provides a person “…shall render for\n\ntaxation all tangible personal property used for the production of income….”\n\n(emphasis added). See Harris County Appraisal District v. Texas Gas Transmission\n\nCorp. (App. 1 Dist.2003) 105 SW3d 88 review denied – where the Court held “shall”\n\nis mandatory, not discretionary. There is nothing in the record to show that any of\n\nthe taxpayer entities rendered their personal property as required by law (in Wood\n\nCounty or elsewhere), or paid taxes on personal property and were somehow taxed\n\ntwice on the same property. There is nothing in the record to show that any of the\n\ntaxpayer entities had paid their personal property taxes but were delinquent on the\n\nmineral interests. There is finally nothing in the record to show Taxing Entities\n\nsought recovery of specific dollars on specific personal property. The inescapable\n\nconclusion (and this conclusion is implicit in Hydrogeo’s argument) is that the\n\nbusiness personal property held for the production of income at the well head\n\n(production equipment, such as casing, tubing, pump jacks tanks and surface\n\n\n                                        10\n\fpipelines) escaped taxation altogether and perhaps should be added to the Tax Roll\n\nas omitted property as authorized by Tax Code §25.21. But it is certainly not a basis\n\nfor a legal finding that the Judgment entered on the working interest (a real property\n\ninterest) of Hydrogeo is somehow defective because it did not describe and identify\n\npersonal property. Finally, Hydrogeo should not be rewarded for their failure to\n\nrender their own business personal property with a finding that such failure becomes\n\na basis to reverse the trial court’s Judgment.\n\n         The trial court’s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (Appellant’s Brief,\n\nAppendix F) does not make any finding of the existence or taxation of personal\n\nproperty, nor does it include a conclusion of law that the omission of the personal\n\nproperty impacts the lien on the mineral interest owned by Hydrogeo. The tax lien\n\nof Taxing Entities is found to be valid and enforceable through foreclosure.\n\n         As the personal property was not taxed, the issue of Hydrogeo’s status as a\n\nbona fide purchaser need not be addressed here.3\n\n\n\n\n3\n QISD maintains the testimony of Loretta Ward that she obtained “a receipt” (Transcript p.25), is not legally the same\nas a Tax Certificate. See Tax Code §31.075 for receipts, and §31.08 for Tax Certificates. An erroneous Tax Certificate\ncan extinguish the lien of a taxing unit, whereas a receipt is merely evidence of a payment. Obtaining a receipt (not\nproduced in the record) does not make one a bona fide purchaser.\n\n                                                         11\n\f                                    CONCLUSION\n\n         The Trial Judge did not commit error in admitting Exhibit “A” into evidence,\n\nas the material included in Exhibit “A” had already been provided to the opposing\n\nside – there was no surprise or ambush at trial resulting from the admission of\n\ncertified public records.\n\n         Although Appellant suggests that personal property was included in the\n\ntaxation of Hydrogeo’s working interest, the evidence produced by Plaintiff at trial,\n\nthe Court’s Judgment, the Trial Court Findings of Fact and Conclusion of Law and\n\nthe Texas Property Tax Code all definitively establish taxation of Hydrogeo’s\n\nmineral interests was limited to their real property interest, and did not include the\n\ntaxation of personal property. Taxing Entities do not argue Hydrogeo did not have\n\nor own personal property; simply that it was not taxed in the accounts the subject of\n\nthis litigation. Accordingly, the Judgment entered in favor of Taxing Entities is\n\nvalid.\n\n                                       PRAYER\n\n         Taxing Entities pray that this honorable Court affirm the Judgment of the Trial\n\nCourt.\n\n\n\n\n                                            12\n\f                                Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n                                __/s/ David Hudson_______________\n                                David Hudson\n                                Texas Bar No. 00786445\n                                Tab Beall\n                                Texas Bar No. 01954000\n                                Perdue, Brandon, Fielder, Collins & Mott, LLP\n                                PO Box 2007\n                                Tyler, Texas 75710-2007\n                                (903) 597-7664\n                                Fax: (903) 597-6298\n                                dhudson@pbfcm.com\n                                tbeall@pbfcm.com\n\n\n                     CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE\n\n            Counsel certifies that this reply brief contains, as counted by Microsoft\n\nWord, contains 2,915 words.

Appellee Wood County, etal.\n\n                STATEMENT REGARDING ORAL ARGUMENT\n\n       Appellee, Quitman Independent School District, does not request Oral\n\nArgument, but agrees the customary time limits should apply if the Court grants oral\n\nargument.\n\n\n\n                             SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n\n       Quitman Independent School District1 (hereinafter QISD) seeks\n\nforeclosure of its tax lien following entry of Judgment (in the absence of payment of\n\nthe taxes). This Court should affirm the trial court’s Judgment because:\n\n       The trial Court properly admitted Exhibit “A”2 into evidence. This was a\n\nbench trial, and the trial judge did not commit error.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  At trial, Quitman Independent School District was represented by the same Counsel for Wood\nCounty, etal. (Mr. Jim Lambeth, with the Linebarger, Goggan firm). On appeal, Quitman ISD is\nrepresented by Mr. David Hudson, with the Perdue, Brandon firm. References to “Taxing\nEntities”, as utilized by Appellant in its brief, shall include all appellee taxing jurisdictions.\nReferences to “QISD” shall be limited to Quitman Independent School District. References to\nHydrogeo shall include both Hydrogeo, LLC and First Bank & Trust East Texas as Appellants.\n2\n  Reference to Exhibit “A” shall mean Tax Entities Exhibit “A” introduced at trial, also included\nin Appellant’s Brief at Appendix A.\n                                                1\n\f      Exhibit “A”, along with pre-trial discovery, put the defendant’s on notice of\n\nthe claim of Taxing Entities, and any typographical errors were cured by the\n\ntestimony of witnesses.\n\n      Taxing Entities met their burden of proof and established their prima facie\n\ncase with the admission into evidence of Exhibit “A”. To the extent Hydrogeo was\n\nable to successfully rebut that presumption (which is denied), Taxing Entities\n\nestablished through testimonial evidence facts sufficient to meet their burden and\n\nsupport the Court’s Judgment.\n\n      Taxing Entities had levied their tax on working interest, which is a real\n\nproperty interest, not a personal property interest. Taxing Entities obtained their\n\nJudgment on real property, entitling them to foreclosure of their tax lien, and any\n\nreferences to personal property are merely an irrelevant argument.\n\n\n\n       APPELLEE QUITMAN INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\n              REPLY TO APPELLANTS ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n                              ISSUE NO. 1 (restated)\n\nDid the trial court commit reversible error by admitting Plaintiffs’ Exhibit “A”\ninto evidence when the document had not been produced prior to trial, and\nwhen the taxing authorities failed to make any showing of good cause for their\nfailure to produce the document.\n\n      Appellant’s contention in this issue is that taxing entities prima facie case fails\n\nbecause Exhibit “A” was not offered pursuant to a discovery request and that the\n                                           2\n\ftrial court erred in admitting the document at trial and that admission of evidence\n\nconstitutes reversible error. The trial court’s evidentiary ruling can be reviewed on\n\nappeal for abuse of discretion. Parker Plaza West, LTD. v.

App.—Houston [1st.]\n\n2012, no pet.)\n\n      Appellants contention in their Issue No. 1 is that because the Certified Copy\n\nof Tax Records was not provided in discovery, the trial court erred in admitting that\n\nevidence over objection at trial without good cause effectively rebutting Taxing\n\nEntities prima facie case causing harmful error. “The purpose of the discovery rules\n\nis to encourage full discovery of the issues and facts before trial so that parties can\n\nmake realistic assessment of their respective positions in order to facilitate\n\nsettlements and prevent trial by ambush.” La Madeleine 200 S.W.3d at 860). In this\n\ncase there can be no contention of surprise or ambush at trial. Taxation is a fact of\n\nlife and Appellants knew or reasonably should have known that a tax liability was\n\ndue when served with citation. Taxing Units pleadings include claims for all\n\ndelinquent taxes penalties, interest, attorney’s fees, and costs. (See Original Petition,\n\nCR at 9). Additionally, tax records are certified public records with the seal of the\n\nappropriate official and Appellants had the same access to them as the Taxing Units.\n\nV.T.C.A., Tax Code Sec. 33.42(a, b); Vernon’s Ann.Texas Rules Civ.Proc., Rule\n\n193.6(a)(2).\n\n\n      Good cause for the admission of evidence is at the discretion of the Trial\n\nJudge. “The trial court has the discretion to determine whether the offering party\n\nhas met his burden of showing good cause to admit the testimony.” Wal-Mart\n\n                                           4\n\fStores, Inc. v.

(2 R.R. p. 9, line 5 – p. 9, line 13).\n\nFurthermore, Wal-Mart, 998 S.W.2d at 671, citing, Ramos v. Champlin Petroleum\n\nCo., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2436763\"><a href=\"/opinion/2436763/ramos-v-champlin-petroleum-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">750</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">873</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 877 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 1998, pet. denied) recognizes\n\nthat the Trial Court can implicitly find good cause by simply admitting the evidence.\n\n\n      Because the Trial Court did not err in admitting Tax Records, and that\n\nadmission did not result in an improper judgment, a holding sustaining the Trial\n\nCourt’s admission of evidence should be affirmed.\n\n                              ISSUE NO. 2 (restated)\n\nDid the trial court err by holding taxing entities’ entire alleged tax lien\nenforceable against Hydrogeo, LLC, and First Bank & Trust East Texas when\ntaxing entities failed to segregate that portion of the lien which was\nunenforceable against Hydrogeo.\n\n\n      The argument raised in Issue #2 is based upon the erroneous assumption that\n\nthe value of the real estate (minerals in this case) is combined with the value of\n\npersonal property to establish one tax account. This is not the law, and all arguments\n\nfollowing from that erroneous assumption become moot.\n\n      The distinction and separation in the taxation of real estate (minerals in place)\n\nfrom personal property is set forth in Tax Code §11.01(a) for real estate and\n\n§11.01(b) for business personal property. The distinction is further echoed in §21.01\n\n                                          5\n\fproviding for the taxation of real estate by its situs (location) and §21.02 for the\n\ntaxation of personal property held for the production of income based upon its situs.\n\n      The reality in separating the taxation of real estate and personal property lies\n\nin the fact the real estate is permanently in place, whereas personal property can be\n\nmoved. In fact, special rules exist for the taxation of personal property to determine\n\nits situs for purposes of taxation as set forth in Tax Code §21.02(a). There are further\n\nrules for the taxation of personal property such as vessels and other watercraft\n\n(§21.021), railroad rolling stock (§21.04) and aircraft (§§21.05 and 21.055). There\n\nare no provisions in the Tax Code for including the value of “production equipment,\n\nsuch as casing, tubing, pump jacks tanks and surface pipelines” (p. 15 Appellant’s\n\nBrief) in the value of the underlying working interest (or royalty interest) of a\n\nmineral interest. The situs rules of §21.02(a) may have even resulted in the business\n\npersonal property of Hydrogeo being taxed in a different taxing jurisdiction: recall\n\nthe testimony of Mr. William E. Godsey, Jr., as owner of Hydrogeo, where he states\n\nthat if there is no longer any production he will “…take my equipment and use it on\n\nsome other leases”. (transcript p. 62). The personal property is clearly movable, and\n\nthere is nothing in the record to show the personal property of Hydrogeo had even\n\nacquired taxable situs in Wood County. It may have been taxable in Wood County,\n\nand it may have been taxable elsewhere; there is simply nothing in the Record to\n\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\fshow how, where, or if it was taxed. Certainly, there is no evidence that it was taxed\n\nas part of the real estate – only the argument of Hydrogeo.\n\n      A more accurate analysis of the taxation of the working interest presently\n\nowned by Hydrogeo and the existence of the business personal property at the well\n\nhead is as follows:\n\n      For each of the tax years in question (2009-2011) the Chief Appraiser of\n\nWood County appraised the real property (mineral working interests) the subject of\n\nthis appeal pursuant to Tax Code §25.01 and in compliance with §25.12. Any\n\nrequired notices of Appraised Value were mailed pursuant to Tax Code §25.19, and\n\nthe respective market values of the subject properties were certified to the taxing\n\nunits pursuant to Tax Code §26.01. Tax bills were mailed pursuant to Tax Code\n\n§33.01, and in the absence of payment, the taxes reflected in those bills became\n\ndelinquent and subject to penalties and interest authorized by Tax Code §33.01 and\n\n33.07. The admission into evidence of Taxing Entities Exhibit “A” established their\n\nprima facie case, Davis vs. City of Austin (Sup. 1982) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">632</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">331</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, and further\n\nestablished proper delivery of all required tax notices despite taxpayer’s assertion\n\nthat he did not receive any notices.

Property owners can\n\n\n                                          7\n\fprotest all of the complaints raised by Hydrogeo, including (A) a determination of\n\nthe appraised value in §41.41(a)(1) to the extent Hydrogeo believed the real estate\n\nand personal property values were combined in one total, (B) inclusion of the\n\nowner’s property on the appraisal records (§41.41(a)(3)) or a determination that the\n\nproperty owner is the owner of the property (§41.41(a)(7)) to the extent Hydrogeo\n\nor any other property owner objected to their inclusion or exclusion from the\n\nAppraisal Roll (such as Steelman Investments, Inc.), and (C) the failure to even\n\nreceive the notice of appraised value as authorized by §41.411.\n\n      Affording some protections to property tax jurisdictions (and preventing a\n\ntaxpayer from suggesting “I don’t owe anything because you never sent me a\n\nstatement”), the Tax Code provides in §25.19(d) that the failure to receive a notice\n\nof appraised value “does not affect the validity of the appraisal of the property, the\n\nimposition of any tax…the existence of any tax lien…or any proceeding instituted\n\nto collect the tax”. Regarding tax bills, the Tax Code provides in §31.01(g) that the\n\nfailure to “receive the tax bill required by this section…does not affect the validity\n\nof the tax, penalty, or interest… the existence of a tax lien, or any procedure to collect\n\na tax”.\n\n      The Tax Code is replete with rights and remedies for the taxpayer, and\n\nprovides procedures for the taxpayer to exhaust their administrative remedies\n\nthrough the protest procedures set forth in the Tax Code (i.e. §41.41 to protest any\n\n\n                                            8\n\fissues with a tax appraisal, including the catch all §41.41(a)(9) “any other\n\naction…that applies to and adversely affects the property owner”. (emphasis added).\n\nThe administrative remedy provisions of the Tax Code are designed to resolve\n\nvaluation and description disputes on an administrative level (the taxpayer who\n\ncomplies with the law and follows the administrative remedy provisions can later\n\nfile suit pursuant to Tax Code 42.21 – not the facts here). In order to emphasize the\n\nrequirement of exhaustion of administrative remedies, the Tax Code provides in\n\n§42.09(a) that the protest procedures of the Tax Code are exclusive and may not be\n\nraised “in defense to a suit to enforce the collection of delinquent taxes….” Most of\n\nthe arguments raised by Hydrogeo are issues that should have been timely protested\n\nthrough the administrative remedies provisions of the Tax Code, and not raised as\n\ndefenses to the underlying delinquent tax suit.\n\n      Hydrogeo suggests that Taxing Entities live petition noted “the value of any\n\npersonal property that may be described above…” (emphasis added - Brief p. 16).\n\nAlthough the live petition of Taxing Entities “may” describe personal property, it\n\ndid not describe or identify any personal property; Exhibit “A” did not identify any\n\npersonal property, and the Judgment did not recover taxes on any described personal\n\nproperty. To the extent Taxing Entities may have sought taxes on personal property\n\n(which is denied), the Court’s Judgment notes in its final paragraph that “All relief\n\nprayed for in any of the pleadings in this cause which is not specifically granted by\n\n\n                                          9\n\fthis judgment is hereby denied”. (Appellant’s Brief, Appendix B). Hydrogeo raises\n\nissues (or imaginatively tries to create issues) and presents appellate arguments\n\nregarding the taxation of personal property that simply were not included in the\n\nJudgment.\n\n      A party seeking to be excused from the lawful obligation of paying taxes\n\nshould otherwise comply with the law, which brings us to one final note regarding\n\nthe personal property. Tax Code §22.01 provides a person “…shall render for\n\ntaxation all tangible personal property used for the production of income….”\n\n(emphasis added). See Harris County Appraisal District v. Texas Gas Transmission\n\nCorp. (App. 1 Dist.2003) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1960185\"><a href=\"/opinion/1960185/harris-county-appraisal-dist-v-texas-gas/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> review denied – where the Court held “shall”\n\nis mandatory, not discretionary. There is nothing in the record to show that any of\n\nthe taxpayer entities rendered their personal property as required by law (in Wood\n\nCounty or elsewhere), or paid taxes on personal property and were somehow taxed\n\ntwice on the same property. There is nothing in the record to show that any of the\n\ntaxpayer entities had paid their personal property taxes but were delinquent on the\n\nmineral interests. There is finally nothing in the record to show Taxing Entities\n\nsought recovery of specific dollars on specific personal property. The inescapable\n\nconclusion (and this conclusion is implicit in Hydrogeo’s argument) is that the\n\nbusiness personal property held for the production of income at the well head\n\n(production equipment, such as casing, tubing, pump jacks tanks and surface\n\n\n                                        10\n\fpipelines) escaped taxation altogether and perhaps should be added to the Tax Roll\n\nas omitted property as authorized by Tax Code §25.21. But it is certainly not a basis\n\nfor a legal finding that the Judgment entered on the working interest (a real property\n\ninterest) of Hydrogeo is somehow defective because it did not describe and identify\n\npersonal property. Finally, Hydrogeo should not be rewarded for their failure to\n\nrender their own business personal property with a finding that such failure becomes\n\na basis to reverse the trial court’s Judgment.\n\n         The trial court’s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (Appellant’s Brief,\n\nAppendix F) does not make any finding of the existence or taxation of personal\n\nproperty, nor does it include a conclusion of law that the omission of the personal\n\nproperty impacts the lien on the mineral interest owned by Hydrogeo. The tax lien\n\nof Taxing Entities is found to be valid and enforceable through foreclosure.\n\n         As the personal property was not taxed, the issue of Hydrogeo’s status as a\n\nbona fide purchaser need not be addressed here.3\n\n\n\n\n3\n QISD maintains the testimony of Loretta Ward that she obtained “a receipt” (Transcript p.25), is not legally the same\nas a Tax Certificate. See Tax Code §31.075 for receipts, and §31.08 for Tax Certificates. An erroneous Tax Certificate\ncan extinguish the lien of a taxing unit, whereas a receipt is merely evidence of a payment. Obtaining a receipt (not\nproduced in the record) does not make one a bona fide purchaser.\n\n                                                         11\n\f                                    CONCLUSION\n\n         The Trial Judge did not commit error in admitting Exhibit “A” into evidence,\n\nas the material included in Exhibit “A” had already been provided to the opposing\n\nside – there was no surprise or ambush at trial resulting from the admission of\n\ncertified public records.\n\n         Although Appellant suggests that personal property was included in the\n\ntaxation of Hydrogeo’s working interest, the evidence produced by Plaintiff at trial,\n\nthe Court’s Judgment, the Trial Court Findings of Fact and Conclusion of Law and\n\nthe Texas Property Tax Code all definitively establish taxation of Hydrogeo’s\n\nmineral interests was limited to their real property interest, and did not include the\n\ntaxation of personal property. Taxing Entities do not argue Hydrogeo did not have\n\nor own personal property; simply that it was not taxed in the accounts the subject of\n\nthis litigation. Accordingly, the Judgment entered in favor of Taxing Entities is\n\nvalid.\n\n                                       PRAYER\n\n         Taxing Entities pray that this honorable Court affirm the Judgment of the Trial\n\nCourt.\n\n\n\n\n                                            12\n\f                                Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n                                __/s/ David Hudson_______________\n                                David Hudson\n                                Texas Bar No. 00786445\n                                Tab Beall\n                                Texas Bar No. 01954000\n                                Perdue, Brandon, Fielder, Collins & Mott, LLP\n                                PO Box 2007\n                                Tyler, Texas 75710-2007\n                                (903) 597-7664\n                                Fax: (903) 597-6298\n                                dhudson@pbfcm.com\n                                tbeall@pbfcm.com\n\n\n                     CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE\n\n            Counsel certifies that this reply brief contains, as counted by Microsoft\n\nWord, contains 2,915 words.
