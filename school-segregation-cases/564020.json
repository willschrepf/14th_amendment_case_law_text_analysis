R. 36.3.\n\n      **\n         The Honorable Dale A. Kimball, United States District Judge for the\nDistrict of Utah, sitting by designation.\n\f      Connie Marion (“plaintiff”) brought this Title VII   1\n                                                               action 2 against The\n\nSlaughter Company, a division of R.E. Phelon Co., Inc. (“TSC”), alleging gender-\n\nbased job and wage discrimination. The case went to trial on the issue of\n\ndisparate treatment. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury returned a verdict\n\nagainst the plaintiff, answering “no” to the following question on the verdict\n\nform: “Has plaintiff Connie Marion proved that her sex was, more likely than\n\nnot, a motivating factor in establishing her rate of pay?” Appellant’s App. at 68.\n\nSubsequently, the plaintiff filed post-trial motions for judgment as a matter of law\n\nand seeking a determination in equity by the court that despite the absence of\n\nintentional discrimination, the gender distribution in TSC’s work force violated\n\nTitle VII under a disparate impact theory. The district court ruled that neither the\n\npleadings, the law, nor the evidence supported a disparate impact claim, and it\n\ndenied relief on the plaintiff’s post-trial motions.\n\n      On appeal, the plaintiff contends that the district court erred by failing to\n\nrule that the gender composition of the departments in question constituted a per\n\n\n\n      Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq., as\n      1\n\namended by the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 42 U.S.C. § 1981A.\n      2\n        The complaint also alleged retaliation in violation of Title VII as a result\nof the complaint Mrs. Marion filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommission, and violations of the Equal Pay Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 206(d), 215(a)(3),\n216, and the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 201 et seq. The district\ncourt granted the defendant’s motion for summary judgment on those claims.\nMrs. Marion does not pursue those portions of the judgment on appeal.\n\n                                          -2-\n\fse violation of Title VII, and by failing to hold or to instruct the jury that the\n\ngender distribution in the workforce amounted to a facially neutral policy having\n\na prohibited disparate impact. The plaintiff seeks either outright reversal and\n\nentry of judgment in her favor, or a new trial. For the reasons stated below, we\n\naffirm.\n\n\n\n                                   BACKGROUND\n\n      TSC manufactures electronic testing equipment in a small facility\n\nemploying approximately fifty people. The process involves sheet metal work\n\nfabricating cabinets of various sizes, and the assembly of components in the\n\ncabinets. This work has been departmentalized into sheet metal and assembly. In\n\naddition to the shop foreman, the sheet metal department usually includes two\n\nmachinists, two or three sheet metal workers, and until recently, a painter. The\n\nassemblers are not further designated by job category.\n\n      The work force in both departments is small: on average, six people or less\n\neach, including a supervisor in assembly and a plant foreman in sheet metal.\n\nTurnover is rare in the sheet metal department. In the fifteen-year period from\n\n1983 to 1998, only two or three openings occurred, each filled by a male\n\napplicant. A larger turnover occurred among the assemblers, although no exact\n\nnumbers for this same period are furnished by the parties. All those vacancies\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fwere filled by women. Except for two instances a number of years ago, the work\n\nforce in the sheet metal department has been entirely male, and entirely female in\n\nthe assembly department. Overall, the wages paid in the sheet metal department\n\nare higher than those paid to the assemblers, but some assemblers make more than\n\nsome of the employees in the sheet metal department. The salary of the plant\n\nforeman has always been higher than the salary paid to the supervisor of the\n\nassemblers.\n\n      The plaintiff, Connie Marion, started with the company in 1967 following\n\nher graduation from high school. Throughout her career she has worked in the\n\nassembly department. In 1985, following the purchase of the company by R.E.\n\nPhelon Co., Inc., the plaintiff was promoted to the position of assembly\n\nsupervisor. Beginning in 1990, she began participating in the hiring process for\n\nassembler positions. In recent years, employees working as assemblers included\n\nthe plaintiff’s sister, sister-in-law and a woman recommended by the plaintiff’s\n\nfather. At the time of trial, only three employees other than the plaintiff were\n\nworking as assemblers.\n\n      Howard Reed started with TSC in 1972 as a sheet metal worker. In 1985,\n\nhe was promoted to plant foreman, supervising the sheet metal department. He\n\nwas paid more than Mrs. Marion, a fact she discovered and contested in 1995.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fThe plaintiff demanded that TSC raise her pay to equal Mr. Reed’s pay. That\n\ndemand was refused and this suit resulted.\n\n      Prior to trial, the district court, in response to cross-motions for summary\n\njudgment, ruled first that the plaintiff had not alleged any failure to hire, promote\n\nor transfer her to the sheet metal department, so the case would be treated as one\n\nasserting disparate pay based on gender. Second, the court ruled that the plaintiff\n\nhad not identified any facially neutral employment policy or practice which\n\ndisparately impacts women, so the plaintiff’s case would be treated as one\n\nalleging disparate treatment. The questions reserved for trial were “whether the\n\nDefendant has intentionally engaged in a practice or policy of maintaining\n\ngender-based job categories, and of intentionally discriminating between the male\n\nand female job categories in its pay structure,” and further, “whether the pay\n\ndisparity between the Plaintiff and the male supervisor was motivated by gender\n\ndiscrimination.” Order of Feb. 3, 1998, at 11; Appellant’s App. at 45.\n\n      The case was extensively prepared and fully presented to the jury. The\n\nplaintiff called five witnesses and the defendant six, including expert witnesses\n\nfor both sides. The plaintiff focused on her claims: (1) that the work force was\n\ninvidiously segregated by gender; (2) that her job and that of the other assemblers\n\nwas as complicated and valuable to the employer and in the workplace generally\n\nas the job performed by Mr. Reed and others in the sheet metal department, thus\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fthe difference in pay was based on gender; and (3) that if her job was less\n\nvaluable, then the company had intentionally placed men in the higher paying\n\njobs.\n\n        Both parties presented evidence regarding the job description, functions,\n\nskill, training, and experience of positions in both departments, including the\n\nposition of supervisor and that of plant foreman. They introduced evidence\n\nregarding the company’s record of filling job vacancies and paying employees,\n\nand expert testimony regarding the value of the various jobs to the company and\n\ngenerally in the economy. The parties also introduced directly conflicting\n\ntestimony regarding alleged statements and attitudes as to gender and jobs in the\n\ntwo affected departments.\n\n        As indicated above, the jury, after assessing the evidence and necessarily\n\nmaking credibility determinations relating to direct collisions in the testimony,\n\ndetermined that Mrs. Marion had not proved that her pay was affected by her\n\ngender.\n\n        Subsequently, the plaintiff filed a post-trial motion for judgment as a matter\n\nof law or for a new trial. The district court denied the motion, surveying the\n\nevidence and ruling, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f            A. Claim of Discrimination with Regard to Pay\n\n             The Court finds that the Defendant offered ample evidence of\n      legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for the pay disparity between\n      the Plaintiff and the plant foreman. The evidence at trial showed\n      significant differences in the duties required of the two positions.\n      According to the Defendant’s evidence, the plant foreman supervised\n      and trained a more highly skilled group of employees, including sheet\n      metal workers and machinists. Unlike the assembly supervisor, the\n      plant foreman is responsible for costly, heavy equipment. The effort\n      required and the working conditions are different. The plant foreman\n      works in a noisier, more hazardous environment than the assembly\n      supervisor. A reasonable jury could find, based upon this evidence,\n      that the pay differential was attributable to differences in the jobs,\n      and was not the result of intentional gender discrimination.\n\n            ....\n\n            B. Claim of Discriminatory Classification System\n\n             The Plaintiff also argues that the Defendant has failed to rebut\n      her prima facie showing of a discriminatory classification system at\n      the Defendant’s production facility. However, the Plaintiff has not\n      shown that she was “aggrieved” or harmed by the alleged\n      classification system. . . . The Plaintiff offers no evidence that she\n      ever sought or applied for, or was qualified for, a position in the\n      sheet metal shop or machine shop, or for the position of plant\n      foreman. Moreover, it was undisputed at trial that the Plaintiff\n      participated to some degree in the hiring decisions for the assembly\n      division, and that she selected only female applicants. The Plaintiff\n      has failed to show that she was harmed either by being deprived of\n      an opportunity to work in a particular position or category of jobs, or\n      by being deprived of the opportunity to work alongside members of\n      the opposite gender. Under the circumstances, the Court finds that\n      the Plaintiff has not made a prima facie claim under Title VII for\n      maintaining a discriminatory job classification system. Thus, the\n      Plaintiff is not entitled to either judgment as a matter of law or a new\n      trial on her discriminatory classification claim.\n\nOrder of June 15, 1998, at 2-4; Appellant’s App. at 60-62 (footnotes omitted).\n\n                                         -7-\n\f       The plaintiff also sought reconsideration by the court of its earlier rulings\n\nthat the case did not present a disparate impact claim. The plaintiff argued that\n\nthe question of adverse impact is one committed by statute to the court, not the\n\njury, and that in deciding the issue “the court must defer to factual issues as found\n\nby the jury, while making it’s [sic] own independent findings on [the disparate\n\nimpact claim].” Pl.’s Post Trial Br. at 2; Appellant’s App. at 1512.\n\n       The district court responded in its order as follows: “Thus, it appears from\n\nthe face of the statute that the right to a jury trial under Title VII extends only to a\n\nclaim of intentional discrimination or disparate treatment.       See Allison v. Citgo\n\nPetroleum Corp., ___ F.3d ___, 1998 WL 244989 (5th Cir. 1998).            Accordingly\n\nthe Court will now reconsider the Plaintiff’s disparate impact theory      .” Order of\n\nJune 15, 1998, at 7; Appellant’s App. at 65-66 (emphasis added).\n\n       The court then surveyed the law and the facts and ruled again that the\n\nplaintiff had failed to establish a prima facie disparate impact claim.    3\n\n\n\nAlternatively, the court found and concluded as follows:\n\n              Even if the Plaintiff had identified a specific, facially neutral\n       policy, the Court would find in favor of the Defendant on the\n       Plaintiff’s disparate impact claim. The preponderance of the\n       evidence at trial showed that the Defendant had legitimate, non-\n\n\n       3\n        The allocation of responsibilities between the court and jury urged by the\nplaintiff in the district court and the court’s conclusion on that point are not\nbefore us on appeal. We, therefore, take the case as presented without implying\nany opinion on the subject.\n\n                                             -8-\n\f       discriminatory reasons for its hiring practices, including the\n       Defendant’s prior experience requirement (or preference) for sheet\n       metal workers and machinists. Further, the preponderance of the\n       evidence at trial showed that the composition of the Defendant’s\n       work force was largely due to the gender make-up of the pool of\n       applicants, rather than the disparate effects of any policy of the\n       Defendant. Thus, the Court concludes that the Plaintiff is not\n       entitled to judgment on her Title VII claim under a disparate impact\n       theory.\n\nId. at 9; Appellant’s App. at 67.\n\n       The district court’s order stated in conclusion that the plaintiff’s post-trial\n\nmotions, including the motion for reconsideration, were denied. This conclusion\n\nis problematic due to the district court’s determination in the order itself to\n\nreconsider the disparate impact claim on its merits, then making factual findings\n\nand reaching a conclusion adverse to the plaintiff on that claim.\n\n\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n\n       The plaintiff’s brief omits a discussion of the standards that guide our\n\nreview. However, as to the disparate impact issue, it is axiomatic that statutory\n\ninterpretation and application are matters of law that we review de novo, while\n\ncrediting facts favorable to the jury’s verdict and deferring to facts found by the\n\ndistrict court in its disparate impact ruling.         See Ortega v. Safeway Stores, Inc.   ,\n\n943 F.2d 1230, 1244 n.29 (10th Cir. 1991).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -9-\n\f      As to the plaintiff’s claim of error in the jury instructions, we review the\n\nrecord to determine whether the instructions properly set forth the governing law\n\nand provided the jury with an ample understanding of the issues involved; and we\n\nreverse only if, based on a review of the record as a whole, any error is\n\ndetermined to have been prejudicial.     See United States v. Roberts , 185 F.3d\n\n1125, 1139 (10th Cir. 1999) (citing    Big Horn Coal Co. v. Commonwealth Edison\n\nCo. , 852 F.2d 1259, 1271 n.19 (10th Cir. 1988);       Ramsey v. Culpepper , 738 F.2d\n\n1092, 1098 (10th Cir. 1984)).\n\n\n\n                                            A.\n\n      A disparate impact claim differs from a disparate treatment claim in that it\n\ndoes not require a showing of discriminatory intent.        See Ortega , 943 F.2d at\n\n1242. Instead, a plaintiff may establish a prima facie case of disparate impact\n\ndiscrimination by showing that a “specific identifiable employment practice or\n\npolicy caused a significant disparate impact on a protected group.”        Id. ; accord 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i);    Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins      , 507 U.S. 604, 609\n\n(1993) (quoting International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States        , 431\n\nU.S. 324, 335 n.15 (1977) (“claims that stress ‘disparate impact’ involve\n\nemployment practices that are facially neutral in their treatment of different\n\ngroups but that in fact fall more harshly on one group than another and cannot be\n\n\n                                           -10-\n\fjustified by business necessity”));   Bullington v. United Airlines , 186 F.3d 1301,\n\n1311-12 (10th Cir. 1999).\n\n       The plaintiff advances essentially one central argument on appeal,\n\ncharacterized in different ways. She contends that TSC committed a per se\n\nviolation of Title VII because the sheet metal department employees were male\n\nand those in the assembly department were female. In support, she relies on 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000e-2(a) which provides, in part, that:\n\n       It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer—\n\n       (2) to . . . segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for\n       employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any\n       individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect\n       his status as an employee, because of such individual’s race, color,\n       religion, sex, or national origin.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a).\n\n       Raising the same point in a different way, the plaintiff contends that the\n\nwork force gender distribution in this case necessarily resulted from a facially\n\nneutral but prohibited policy or practice   4\n                                                by TSC, i.e., the distribution proves a\n\n\n\n       In an alternative argument, the plaintiff makes much of the district court’s\n       4\n\nstatement that TSC’s hiring practices were “facially discriminatory.” In reliance\non that statement the plaintiff cites a multitude of cases involving an express\ngender-based policy. See, e.g., International Union, United Auto., Aerospace &\nAgric. Implement Workers v. Johnson Controls, Inc., 499 U.S. 187, 199 (1991)\n(policy excluding women with childbearing capacity from certain job positions).\nTaken in context, the district court’s statement does not support the plaintiff’s\ninterpretation, and the cases cited by plaintiff with respect to express\n                                                                         (continued...)\n\n                                            -11-\n\fpractice must have existed. In these arguments the plaintiff does not focus on the\n\nsupervisory jobs themselves because there has been no real turnover. Rather, she\n\nargues that the supervisor/foreman jobs are filled from within the respective\n\ndepartments so that the gender composition of the departments bears on her\n\nsituation.\n\n      We reject the plaintiff’s disparate impact arguments for three reasons, each\n\nof which is sufficient. The first reason is dispositive; the second and third are\n\nalternative reasons for affirmance.\n\n      First, and dispositively, the plaintiff lacks standing to complain of the\n\ngender staffing in the sheet metal department, and the jury has ruled out wage\n\ndiscrimination in her pay in the assembly department. As the district court found,\n\nthe plaintiff did not seek and was not denied any position in the sheet metal\n\ndepartment, in particular, the job of plant foreman. Nor did she plead or establish\n\nthat she would have sought any such position but for some policy against it.\n\nThus, assuming for purposes of argument that TSC unlawfully excluded females\n\nfrom sheet metal jobs, that fact had no effect on the plaintiff.\n\n      The district court’s ruling, quoted above, correctly states that Title VII only\n\nprovides a cause of action to a person who is “aggrieved” by an unlawful\n\n\n\n\n      (...continued)\n      4\n\ngender-based policies manifestly do not apply to this case.\n\n                                         -12-\n\femployment practice. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f). One who is not injured is not\n\naggrieved. See Patton v. United Parcel Serv., Inc.      , 910 F. Supp. 1250, 1278 (S.D.\n\nTex. 1995). That statutory requirement reflects the requirement of standing under\n\nthe case or controversy provision of Article III. To invoke a federal court’s\n\njurisdiction a plaintiff must demonstrate three things: (1) injury in fact; (2) a\n\ncausal relationship between the injury and the challenged conduct; and (3) a\n\nlikelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.        See Byers v.\n\nCity of Albuquerque , 150 F.3d 1271, 1274 (10th Cir. 1998);         see also Lujan v.\n\nDefenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992). The plaintiff fails these\n\nrequirements.\n\n       Second, the fact, standing alone, that TSC has all men in sheet metal\n\npositions and all women in assembly is not a per se violation of Title VII; nor is it\n\nself-proving as to the existence of a policy or practice, lawful or otherwise. The\n\nsection of the statute to which the plaintiff refers, set out above, refers to\n\nsegregation or classification that tends to deprive protected individuals of\n\nemployment opportunity or otherwise adversely affect employment status. Thus,\n\nit is not the fact of separate genders in departments that is prohibited, it is the\n\ndeprivation of opportunity or adverse effect on status that is prohibited.       Cf. Vant\n\nHul v. City of Dell Rapids , 462 F. Supp. 828, 833 (D.S.D. 1978) (stating that the\n\npurpose of the Civil Rights Act is not to guarantee that a definite number of\n\n\n                                            -13-\n\ffemales are employed, but “to achieve equality and eliminate discrimination based\n\non artificial . . . barriers to employment”). That is a matter of proof, and that\n\nburden was not carried here. Furthermore, the terms “segregate or classify,” as\n\nused in the statute, are verbs denoting purposeful action by the employer.       See\n\nMcDonnell v. Cisneros , 84 F.3d 256, 258 (7th Cir. 1996) (under these provisions,\n\nthere is no actionable discrimination without something that can be described as\n\nan adverse employment action). Pure nondiscriminatory happenstance, or results\n\nfrom hiring practices that are justified by business necessity do not fall in this\n\ncategory.\n\n       The district court also correctly pointed out numerous times in this case\n\nthat the plaintiff failed to identify an actual policy or practice of TSC relating to\n\ngender in hiring. Statistics alone are insufficient. They must be tied to an\n\nidentifiable practice, such as a skewed interview procedure.      See, e.g. , Bullington ,\n\n186 F.3d at 1314.\n\n       Furthermore, even when a specific policy or practice is identified and then\n\nstatistics are offered “we require the data to cross a ‘threshold of reliability before\n\nit can establish even a prima facie case of disparate impact.’”     Id. at 1313 (citing\n\nOrtega , 943 F.2d at 1243). “The ‘reliability’ or usefulness of any particular\n\nanalysis will depend on the surrounding facts and circumstances of the case.”          Id.\n\n(citing Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust       , 487 U.S. 977, 995 n.3 (1998)). And,\n\n\n                                            -14-\n\f“some statistical analysis may be so incomplete as to be irrelevant.”     Id. at 1314,\n\nn.9. That is the case here.\n\n        Third, even if a facially neutral hiring policy led to the gender distribution\n\nin question, the district court found that TSC had legitimate non-discriminatory\n\nreasons for its hiring decisions. Those findings quoted above include experience,\n\nthe gender of the applicant pool, low turnover, and job preference. Plaintiff’s\n\nclaims of discrimination do not overcome these facts necessarily found by the jury\n\nand directly found by the district court.\n\n\n\n                                             B.\n\n        The plaintiff also claims that the district court erred by refusing to give an\n\n“inexorable zero” instruction. Under certain circumstances an inference of\n\ndiscrimination may sometimes be drawn from statistical evidence that no member\n\nof a protected group has ever occupied a particular job or position.      See , e.g. ,\n\nLoyd v. Phillips Bros., Inc.   , 25 F.3d 518, 524 n.4 (7th Cir. 1994). Such evidence\n\nis often referred to as the “inexorable zero.”      See Teamsters , 431 U.S. at 342\n\nn.23.\n\n        The proposed instruction to which the plaintiff refers us states, in part, “if\n\nyou [the jury] find that defendant has maintained a segregated work force . . . then\n\nyou must find for plaintiff on her Title VII claim.” Appellant’s App. at 86. The\n\n\n                                             -15-\n\fdistrict court stated that an instruction to that effect would be improper, but that\n\nplaintiff’s counsel was free to argue the statistics and inferences from those\n\nclaimed by the plaintiff. There is no error in that ruling.\n\n      Throughout the trial the plaintiff’s evidence and argument focused on the\n\nwork force distribution, including hiring, and plaintiff’s counsel vigorously\n\npressed the contention on the jury. In addition, the court correctly instructed the\n\njury on the statutory provisions, on the fact that they could draw inferences from\n\nthe evidence, and on the importance of considering both direct and circumstantial\n\nevidence.\n\n      In contrast, the plaintiff’s view of 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a) misstates the\n\nlaw, as we have explained above. The district court correctly perceived the\n\nfallacy when it refused the proffered instruction.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\f                                 CONCLUSION\n\n      As our extensive quotes from the district court’s opinions will indicate, the\n\ndistrict court’s treatment of the issues in this case was careful and cogent. We\n\nhave considered all of the plaintiff’s arguments and conclude that the district\n\ncourt did not err.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n                                               ENTERED FOR THE COURT\n\n\n                                               Stephen H.

Phelon Co., Inc. (“TSC”), alleging gender-\n\nbased job and wage discrimination. The case went to trial on the issue of\n\ndisparate treatment. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury returned a verdict\n\nagainst the plaintiff, answering “no” to the following question on the verdict\n\nform: “Has plaintiff Connie Marion proved that her sex was, more likely than\n\nnot, a motivating factor in establishing her rate of pay?” Appellant’s App. at 68.\n\nSubsequently, the plaintiff filed post-trial motions for judgment as a matter of law\n\nand seeking a determination in equity by the court that despite the absence of\n\nintentional discrimination, the gender distribution in TSC’s work force violated\n\nTitle VII under a disparate impact theory. The district court ruled that neither the\n\npleadings, the law, nor the evidence supported a disparate impact claim, and it\n\ndenied relief on the plaintiff’s post-trial motions.\n\n      On appeal, the plaintiff contends that the district court erred by failing to\n\nrule that the gender composition of the departments in question constituted a per\n\n\n\n      Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq., as\n      1\n\namended by the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 42 U.S.C. § 1981A.\n      2\n        The complaint also alleged retaliation in violation of Title VII as a result\nof the complaint Mrs. Marion filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommission, and violations of the Equal Pay Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 206(d), 215(a)(3),\n216, and the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 201 et seq. The district\ncourt granted the defendant’s motion for summary judgment on those claims.\nMrs. Marion does not pursue those portions of the judgment on appeal.\n\n                                          -2-\n\fse violation of Title VII, and by failing to hold or to instruct the jury that the\n\ngender distribution in the workforce amounted to a facially neutral policy having\n\na prohibited disparate impact. The plaintiff seeks either outright reversal and\n\nentry of judgment in her favor, or a new trial. For the reasons stated below, we\n\naffirm.\n\n\n\n                                   BACKGROUND\n\n      TSC manufactures electronic testing equipment in a small facility\n\nemploying approximately fifty people. The process involves sheet metal work\n\nfabricating cabinets of various sizes, and the assembly of components in the\n\ncabinets. This work has been departmentalized into sheet metal and assembly. In\n\naddition to the shop foreman, the sheet metal department usually includes two\n\nmachinists, two or three sheet metal workers, and until recently, a painter. The\n\nassemblers are not further designated by job category.\n\n      The work force in both departments is small: on average, six people or less\n\neach, including a supervisor in assembly and a plant foreman in sheet metal.\n\nTurnover is rare in the sheet metal department. In the fifteen-year period from\n\n1983 to 1998, only two or three openings occurred, each filled by a male\n\napplicant. A larger turnover occurred among the assemblers, although no exact\n\nnumbers for this same period are furnished by the parties. All those vacancies\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fwere filled by women. Except for two instances a number of years ago, the work\n\nforce in the sheet metal department has been entirely male, and entirely female in\n\nthe assembly department. Overall, the wages paid in the sheet metal department\n\nare higher than those paid to the assemblers, but some assemblers make more than\n\nsome of the employees in the sheet metal department. The salary of the plant\n\nforeman has always been higher than the salary paid to the supervisor of the\n\nassemblers.\n\n      The plaintiff, Connie Marion, started with the company in 1967 following\n\nher graduation from high school. Throughout her career she has worked in the\n\nassembly department. In 1985, following the purchase of the company by R.E.\n\nPhelon Co., Inc., the plaintiff was promoted to the position of assembly\n\nsupervisor. Beginning in 1990, she began participating in the hiring process for\n\nassembler positions. In recent years, employees working as assemblers included\n\nthe plaintiff’s sister, sister-in-law and a woman recommended by the plaintiff’s\n\nfather. At the time of trial, only three employees other than the plaintiff were\n\nworking as assemblers.\n\n      Howard Reed started with TSC in 1972 as a sheet metal worker. In 1985,\n\nhe was promoted to plant foreman, supervising the sheet metal department. He\n\nwas paid more than Mrs. Marion, a fact she discovered and contested in 1995.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fThe plaintiff demanded that TSC raise her pay to equal Mr. Reed’s pay. That\n\ndemand was refused and this suit resulted.\n\n      Prior to trial, the district court, in response to cross-motions for summary\n\njudgment, ruled first that the plaintiff had not alleged any failure to hire, promote\n\nor transfer her to the sheet metal department, so the case would be treated as one\n\nasserting disparate pay based on gender. Second, the court ruled that the plaintiff\n\nhad not identified any facially neutral employment policy or practice which\n\ndisparately impacts women, so the plaintiff’s case would be treated as one\n\nalleging disparate treatment. The questions reserved for trial were “whether the\n\nDefendant has intentionally engaged in a practice or policy of maintaining\n\ngender-based job categories, and of intentionally discriminating between the male\n\nand female job categories in its pay structure,” and further, “whether the pay\n\ndisparity between the Plaintiff and the male supervisor was motivated by gender\n\ndiscrimination.” Order of Feb. 3, 1998, at 11; Appellant’s App. at 45.\n\n      The case was extensively prepared and fully presented to the jury. The\n\nplaintiff called five witnesses and the defendant six, including expert witnesses\n\nfor both sides. The plaintiff focused on her claims: (1) that the work force was\n\ninvidiously segregated by gender; (2) that her job and that of the other assemblers\n\nwas as complicated and valuable to the employer and in the workplace generally\n\nas the job performed by Mr. Reed and others in the sheet metal department, thus\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fthe difference in pay was based on gender; and (3) that if her job was less\n\nvaluable, then the company had intentionally placed men in the higher paying\n\njobs.\n\n        Both parties presented evidence regarding the job description, functions,\n\nskill, training, and experience of positions in both departments, including the\n\nposition of supervisor and that of plant foreman. They introduced evidence\n\nregarding the company’s record of filling job vacancies and paying employees,\n\nand expert testimony regarding the value of the various jobs to the company and\n\ngenerally in the economy. The parties also introduced directly conflicting\n\ntestimony regarding alleged statements and attitudes as to gender and jobs in the\n\ntwo affected departments.\n\n        As indicated above, the jury, after assessing the evidence and necessarily\n\nmaking credibility determinations relating to direct collisions in the testimony,\n\ndetermined that Mrs. Marion had not proved that her pay was affected by her\n\ngender.\n\n        Subsequently, the plaintiff filed a post-trial motion for judgment as a matter\n\nof law or for a new trial. The district court denied the motion, surveying the\n\nevidence and ruling, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f            A. Claim of Discrimination with Regard to Pay\n\n             The Court finds that the Defendant offered ample evidence of\n      legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for the pay disparity between\n      the Plaintiff and the plant foreman. The evidence at trial showed\n      significant differences in the duties required of the two positions.\n      According to the Defendant’s evidence, the plant foreman supervised\n      and trained a more highly skilled group of employees, including sheet\n      metal workers and machinists. Unlike the assembly supervisor, the\n      plant foreman is responsible for costly, heavy equipment. The effort\n      required and the working conditions are different. The plant foreman\n      works in a noisier, more hazardous environment than the assembly\n      supervisor. A reasonable jury could find, based upon this evidence,\n      that the pay differential was attributable to differences in the jobs,\n      and was not the result of intentional gender discrimination.\n\n            ....\n\n            B. Claim of Discriminatory Classification System\n\n             The Plaintiff also argues that the Defendant has failed to rebut\n      her prima facie showing of a discriminatory classification system at\n      the Defendant’s production facility. However, the Plaintiff has not\n      shown that she was “aggrieved” or harmed by the alleged\n      classification system. . . . The Plaintiff offers no evidence that she\n      ever sought or applied for, or was qualified for, a position in the\n      sheet metal shop or machine shop, or for the position of plant\n      foreman. Moreover, it was undisputed at trial that the Plaintiff\n      participated to some degree in the hiring decisions for the assembly\n      division, and that she selected only female applicants. The Plaintiff\n      has failed to show that she was harmed either by being deprived of\n      an opportunity to work in a particular position or category of jobs, or\n      by being deprived of the opportunity to work alongside members of\n      the opposite gender. Under the circumstances, the Court finds that\n      the Plaintiff has not made a prima facie claim under Title VII for\n      maintaining a discriminatory job classification system. Thus, the\n      Plaintiff is not entitled to either judgment as a matter of law or a new\n      trial on her discriminatory classification claim.\n\nOrder of June 15, 1998, at 2-4; Appellant’s App. at 60-62 (footnotes omitted).\n\n                                         -7-\n\f       The plaintiff also sought reconsideration by the court of its earlier rulings\n\nthat the case did not present a disparate impact claim. The plaintiff argued that\n\nthe question of adverse impact is one committed by statute to the court, not the\n\njury, and that in deciding the issue “the court must defer to factual issues as found\n\nby the jury, while making it’s [sic] own independent findings on [the disparate\n\nimpact claim].” Pl.’s Post Trial Br. at 2; Appellant’s App. at 1512.\n\n       The district court responded in its order as follows: “Thus, it appears from\n\nthe face of the statute that the right to a jury trial under Title VII extends only to a\n\nclaim of intentional discrimination or disparate treatment.       See Allison v. Citgo\n\nPetroleum Corp., ___ F.3d ___, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">244989</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1998).            Accordingly\n\nthe Court will now reconsider the Plaintiff’s disparate impact theory      .” Order of\n\nJune 15, 1998, at 7; Appellant’s App. at 65-66 (emphasis added).\n\n       The court then surveyed the law and the facts and ruled again that the\n\nplaintiff had failed to establish a prima facie disparate impact claim.    3\n\n\n\nAlternatively, the court found and concluded as follows:\n\n              Even if the Plaintiff had identified a specific, facially neutral\n       policy, the Court would find in favor of the Defendant on the\n       Plaintiff’s disparate impact claim. The preponderance of the\n       evidence at trial showed that the Defendant had legitimate, non-\n\n\n       3\n        The allocation of responsibilities between the court and jury urged by the\nplaintiff in the district court and the court’s conclusion on that point are not\nbefore us on appeal. We, therefore, take the case as presented without implying\nany opinion on the subject.\n\n                                             -8-\n\f       discriminatory reasons for its hiring practices, including the\n       Defendant’s prior experience requirement (or preference) for sheet\n       metal workers and machinists. Further, the preponderance of the\n       evidence at trial showed that the composition of the Defendant’s\n       work force was largely due to the gender make-up of the pool of\n       applicants, rather than the disparate effects of any policy of the\n       Defendant. Thus, the Court concludes that the Plaintiff is not\n       entitled to judgment on her Title VII claim under a disparate impact\n       theory.\n\nId. at 9; Appellant’s App. at 67.\n\n       The district court’s order stated in conclusion that the plaintiff’s post-trial\n\nmotions, including the motion for reconsideration, were denied. This conclusion\n\nis problematic due to the district court’s determination in the order itself to\n\nreconsider the disparate impact claim on its merits, then making factual findings\n\nand reaching a conclusion adverse to the plaintiff on that claim.\n\n\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n\n       The plaintiff’s brief omits a discussion of the standards that guide our\n\nreview. However, as to the disparate impact issue, it is axiomatic that statutory\n\ninterpretation and application are matters of law that we review de novo, while\n\ncrediting facts favorable to the jury’s verdict and deferring to facts found by the\n\ndistrict court in its disparate impact ruling.

She contends that TSC committed a per se\n\nviolation of Title VII because the sheet metal department employees were male\n\nand those in the assembly department were female. In support, she relies on 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000e-2(a) which provides, in part, that:\n\n       It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer—\n\n       (2) to . . . segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for\n       employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any\n       individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect\n       his status as an employee, because of such individual’s race, color,\n       religion, sex, or national origin.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a).\n\n       Raising the same point in a different way, the plaintiff contends that the\n\nwork force gender distribution in this case necessarily resulted from a facially\n\nneutral but prohibited policy or practice   4\n                                                by TSC, i.e., the distribution proves a\n\n\n\n       In an alternative argument, the plaintiff makes much of the district court’s\n       4\n\nstatement that TSC’s hiring practices were “facially discriminatory.” In reliance\non that statement the plaintiff cites a multitude of cases involving an express\ngender-based policy. See, e.g., International Union, United Auto., Aerospace &\nAgric. Implement Workers v. Johnson Controls, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112563\"><a href=\"/opinion/112563/automobile-workers-v-johnson-controls-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 199 (1991)\n(policy excluding women with childbearing capacity from certain job positions).\nTaken in context, the district court’s statement does not support the plaintiff’s\ninterpretation, and the cases cited by plaintiff with respect to express\n                                                                         (continued...)\n\n                                            -11-\n\fpractice must have existed. In these arguments the plaintiff does not focus on the\n\nsupervisory jobs themselves because there has been no real turnover. Rather, she\n\nargues that the supervisor/foreman jobs are filled from within the respective\n\ndepartments so that the gender composition of the departments bears on her\n\nsituation.\n\n      We reject the plaintiff’s disparate impact arguments for three reasons, each\n\nof which is sufficient. The first reason is dispositive; the second and third are\n\nalternative reasons for affirmance.\n\n      First, and dispositively, the plaintiff lacks standing to complain of the\n\ngender staffing in the sheet metal department, and the jury has ruled out wage\n\ndiscrimination in her pay in the assembly department. As the district court found,\n\nthe plaintiff did not seek and was not denied any position in the sheet metal\n\ndepartment, in particular, the job of plant foreman. Nor did she plead or establish\n\nthat she would have sought any such position but for some policy against it.\n\nThus, assuming for purposes of argument that TSC unlawfully excluded females\n\nfrom sheet metal jobs, that fact had no effect on the plaintiff.\n\n      The district court’s ruling, quoted above, correctly states that Title VII only\n\nprovides a cause of action to a person who is “aggrieved” by an unlawful\n\n\n\n\n      (...continued)\n      4\n\ngender-based policies manifestly do not apply to this case.\n\n                                         -12-\n\femployment practice. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f). One who is not injured is not\n\naggrieved. See Patton v.

That statutory requirement reflects the requirement of standing under\n\nthe case or controversy provision of Article III. To invoke a federal court’s\n\njurisdiction a plaintiff must demonstrate three things: (1) injury in fact; (2) a\n\ncausal relationship between the injury and the challenged conduct; and (3) a\n\nlikelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.        See Byers v.\n\nCity of Albuquerque , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"156684\"><a href=\"/opinion/156684/byers-v-city-of-albuquerque/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1271</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1274 (10th Cir. 1998);         see also Lujan v.\n\nDefenders of Wildlife , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112747\"><a href=\"/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 560-61 (1992). The plaintiff fails these\n\nrequirements.\n\n       Second, the fact, standing alone, that TSC has all men in sheet metal\n\npositions and all women in assembly is not a per se violation of Title VII; nor is it\n\nself-proving as to the existence of a policy or practice, lawful or otherwise. The\n\nsection of the statute to which the plaintiff refers, set out above, refers to\n\nsegregation or classification that tends to deprive protected individuals of\n\nemployment opportunity or otherwise adversely affect employment status. Thus,\n\nit is not the fact of separate genders in departments that is prohibited, it is the\n\ndeprivation of opportunity or adverse effect on status that is prohibited.       Cf. Vant\n\nHul v. City of Dell Rapids , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2142388\"><a href=\"/opinion/2142388/vant-hul-v-city-of-dell-rapids/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

That is a matter of proof, and that\n\nburden was not carried here. Furthermore, the terms “segregate or classify,” as\n\nused in the statute, are verbs denoting purposeful action by the employer.       See\n\nMcDonnell v. Cisneros , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718358\"><a href=\"/opinion/718358/mary-pat-mcdonnell-and-thomas-w-boockmeier-v-henry-g-cisneros-secretary/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">256</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 258 (7th Cir. 1996) (under these provisions,\n\nthere is no actionable discrimination without something that can be described as\n\nan adverse employment action). Pure nondiscriminatory happenstance, or results\n\nfrom hiring practices that are justified by business necessity do not fall in this\n\ncategory.\n\n       The district court also correctly pointed out numerous times in this case\n\nthat the plaintiff failed to identify an actual policy or practice of TSC relating to\n\ngender in hiring. Statistics alone are insufficient. They must be tied to an\n\nidentifiable practice, such as a skewed interview procedure.      See, e.g. , Bullington ,\n\n186 F.3d at 1314.\n\n       Furthermore, even when a specific policy or practice is identified and then\n\nstatistics are offered “we require the data to cross a ‘threshold of reliability before\n\nit can establish even a prima facie case of disparate impact.’”     Id. at 1313 (citing\n\nOrtega , 943 F.2d at 1243). “The ‘reliability’ or usefulness of any particular\n\nanalysis will depend on the surrounding facts and circumstances of the case.”          Id.\n\n(citing Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust       , </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">977</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 995 n.3 (1998)). And,\n\n\n                                            -14-\n\f“some statistical analysis may be so incomplete as to be irrelevant.”     Id. at 1314,\n\nn.9. That is the case here.\n\n        Third, even if a facially neutral hiring policy led to the gender distribution\n\nin question, the district court found that TSC had legitimate non-discriminatory\n\nreasons for its hiring decisions. Those findings quoted above include experience,\n\nthe gender of the applicant pool, low turnover, and job preference. Plaintiff’s\n\nclaims of discrimination do not overcome these facts necessarily found by the jury\n\nand directly found by the district court.\n\n\n\n                                             B.\n\n        The plaintiff also claims that the district court erred by refusing to give an\n\n“inexorable zero” instruction. Under certain circumstances an inference of\n\ndiscrimination may sometimes be drawn from statistical evidence that no member\n\nof a protected group has ever occupied a particular job or position.      See , e.g. ,\n\nLoyd v. Phillips Bros., Inc.   , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"670747\"><a href=\"/opinion/670747/64-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1513-64-empl-prac-dec-p-43158-sandra-k/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 524 n.4 (7th Cir. 1994). Such evidence\n\nis often referred to as the “inexorable zero.”      See Teamsters , 431 U.S. at 342\n\nn.23.\n\n        The proposed instruction to which the plaintiff refers us states, in part, “if\n\nyou [the jury] find that defendant has maintained a segregated work force . . . then\n\nyou must find for plaintiff on her Title VII claim.” Appellant’s App. at 86. The\n\n\n                                             -15-\n\fdistrict court stated that an instruction to that effect would be improper, but that\n\nplaintiff’s counsel was free to argue the statistics and inferences from those\n\nclaimed by the plaintiff. There is no error in that ruling.\n\n      Throughout the trial the plaintiff’s evidence and argument focused on the\n\nwork force distribution, including hiring, and plaintiff’s counsel vigorously\n\npressed the contention on the jury. In addition, the court correctly instructed the\n\njury on the statutory provisions, on the fact that they could draw inferences from\n\nthe evidence, and on the importance of considering both direct and circumstantial\n\nevidence.\n\n      In contrast, the plaintiff’s view of 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a) misstates the\n\nlaw, as we have explained above. The district court correctly perceived the\n\nfallacy when it refused the proffered instruction.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\f                                 CONCLUSION\n\n      As our extensive quotes from the district court’s opinions will indicate, the\n\ndistrict court’s treatment of the issues in this case was careful and cogent. We\n\nhave considered all of the plaintiff’s arguments and conclude that the district\n\ncourt did not err.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n                                               ENTERED FOR THE COURT\n\n\n                                               Stephen H.
