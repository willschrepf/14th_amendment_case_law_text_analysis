Co.,  954 F.2d 19, 20<br>          ____________    _______________________________<br><br>          (1st Cir. 1992).   The R/V Endeavor is a  vessel chartered by the<br><br>          National Science Foundation to  URI's Graduate School of Oceanog-<br><br>          raphy  (GSO) for research purposes.   In the summer of 1985, John<br><br>          Metz, the GSO's port  engineer, discovered serious rust corrosion<br><br>          on  the inside of the  Endeavor's steel ballast  tanks, which are<br><br>          submerged in  salt water during  normal operation of  the vessel.<br><br>          Responding  to  a  Chesterton advertisement,  Metz  received test<br><br>          samples of  \"Rust Transformer,\"  a Chesterton product  which pur-<br><br>          portedly converts surface corrosion  into a rust-inhibitor, which<br><br>          in turn serves  as a base for further coats  of paint.  Satisfied<br><br>          with  the  test-sample  results,  Metz  invited Chesterton  sales<br><br>          representatives  aboard  the  Endeavor.    After  inspecting  the<br><br><br>                                          2<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          Endeavor's ballast tank  corrosion, Chesterton's  representatives<br><br>          recommended that  Metz use Chesterton's 1-2-3  System (using Rust<br><br>          Transformer,  a primer, and a final  enamel coat) to rehabilitate<br><br>          the  tanks.   Metz  ordered the  1-2-3  System on  September  11,<br><br>          1985.1   Six months after URI completed the 1-2-3 System applica-<br><br>          tion, the  new coating on  the ballast tanks began  to loosen and<br><br>          flake  off.    URI allegedly  expended  $100,000  to correct  the<br><br>          problem.<br><br>                    URI  brought suit  against Chesterton  in Rhode  Island<br><br>          state  court  on   May 4,  1989,   alleging  negligence,   strict<br><br>          liability,  and  breaches  of  an express  warranty  and  implied<br><br>          warranties  of  merchantability  and  fitness  for  a  particular<br><br>          purpose.    Chesterton promptly  removed  the  action to  federal<br><br>          district court.   URI moved for remand on the ground that URI, as<br><br>          an \"alter  ego, arm, or agent\"  of the State of  Rhode Island, is<br><br>          not  a \"citizen\"  of Rhode  Island for  diversity purposes.   The<br><br>          district court denied URI's  remand motion without an evidentiary<br><br>          hearing,  relying  on an  earlier  district  court decision,  see<br>                                                                        ___<br><br>          Vanlaarhoven v. Newman,  564 F. Supp.  145 (D.R.I. 1983)  (Selya,<br>          ____________    ______<br><br>          J.), which  determined that URI was not an \"arm\" of the State for<br><br>          sovereign immunity purposes.<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               1The original URI complaint  alleged that Metz was reassured<br>          by Chesterton  that  the 1-2-3  System would  work on  Endeavor's<br>          ballast tanks.  On the other hand, the product's written instruc-<br>          tions advised  that the system  was not recommended  for surfaces<br>          regularly  immersed in sea water.   In an  amended complaint, URI<br>          alleged that  Chesterton  representatives observed  the URI  crew<br>          applying  the 1-2-3 System to the ballast tanks, but said nothing<br>          to URI representatives  about the unsuitability of the  system or<br>          its improper application.<br><br>                                          3<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                    This  court declined  to entertain  URI's interlocutory<br><br>          appeal  from the  jurisdictional  ruling  but noted  disagreement<br><br>          among  the circuits as to the proper criteria for determining the<br><br>          citizenship  of state  universities for  diversity purposes.   We<br><br>          recommended that the district court conduct \"limited factfinding\"<br><br>          on remand relating to several factors pertinent to URI's citizen-<br><br>          ship,  including  (1)  \"the degree  of  URI's  dependence on  and<br><br>          functional integration  with the  state treasury,\" (2)  \"the per-<br><br>          centage of URI's annual budget that derives from state appropria-<br><br>          tions,\"  and (3)  \"whether the legislature  bases levels  of such<br><br>          appropriations  in part  on the  amount of  nonappropriated funds<br><br>          available to URI.\"2   On remand, the district court  denied URI's<br><br>          motion  for  a pretrial  evidentiary  hearing  relating to  these<br><br>          jurisdictional  matters.   The  jury trial  began on  December 3,<br><br>          1991.  After the  district court excluded the testimony  of URI's<br><br>          only expert witness on the issue of contract damages, URI abrupt-<br><br>          ly  rested its case.  Judgment  was entered for Chesterton on all<br><br>          counts, as  a matter of law,  pursuant to Fed. R.  Civ. P. 50(a),<br><br>          and URI appealed.<br><br><br><br>                                          II<br>                                          II<br><br>                                      DISCUSSION<br>                                      DISCUSSION<br>                                      __________<br><br><br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               2As  an alternate  and independent  reason for  declining to<br>          entertain  the interlocutory  appeal, this  court noted  that the<br>          litigation  was unlikely to be so protracted as to warrant appel-<br>          late   interruption, given the nature and scope of URI's contract<br>          claims.<br><br>                                          4<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          A.

Instead, URI<br><br>          insists  that Chesterton,  as the  party requesting  removal, see<br>                                                                        ___<br><br>          supra Section II.A,  was required  to bear the  entire burden  of<br>          _____                                           ______<br><br>          proof and production on every conceivable fact     even including<br><br>          \"negative\" facts     which  might prove  relevant to the  Board's<br>                                      _____ _____<br><br>          citizenship  status.  Thus, even  after trial on  the merits, URI<br><br>          speculates that  there may  be evidence  which  would preclude  a<br><br>          reliable determination as to federal diversity jurisdiction.  For<br><br>          the  reasons  hereinafter  explained,  we  think  URI inadvisably<br><br><br>                                          29<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          banked on a cramped view of the proper allocation of the  burdens<br><br>          of  proof and  production relating  to the  jurisdictional issue,<br><br>          misapprehended the proper role of  \"functional integration\" data,<br><br>          and exaggerated the import of our earlier \"recommendation\" to the<br><br>          district court for further factfinding on remand.<br><br>                    For some  reason, our  earlier invitation to  engage in<br><br>          additional factfinding  on remand  went unheeded.   URI intimates<br><br>          that it did  all it  could by requesting  a separate  evidentiary<br>                                                      ________<br><br>          hearing,  and  that  the  district court  simply  discounted  our<br><br>          recommendation  as  to  the  possible  relevance  of  \"functional<br><br>          integration\"  evidence.   In  our view,  however, URI  mischarac-<br><br>          terizes the remand order.  While we suggested the desirability of<br><br>          supplementary factfinding, the  precise factfinding procedure  to<br>                        ___________                           _________<br><br>          be employed always rests within the sound discretion of the trial<br><br>          court.  See Foman v. Davis,  371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962); O'Toole v.<br>                  ___ _____    _____                             _______<br><br>          Arlington Trust Co., 681 F.2d 94,  98 (1st Cir. 1982) (finding no<br>          ___________________<br><br>          abuse of discretion,  as \"the  court was under  no obligation  to<br><br>          require  an evidentiary  hearing  . . .

Following an unrecorded<br><br>          pretrial  conference with  counsel, the  district court  did deny<br><br>          URI's motion for a separate evidentiary hearing.  In that connec-<br><br>          tion,  URI has provided  no indication  of the  legal contentions<br><br>          advanced by either party  at the pretrial conference, nor  of the<br><br>          grounds for the  district court's decision  to bypass a  pretrial<br><br>          evidentiary hearing.  Chesterton, on the other hand, asserts that<br><br>          the conference  involved an extended discussion  about the appro-<br><br>          priateness  of a  separate pretrial hearing,  but that  the court<br><br>          opted to permit the presentation of evidence on the jurisdiction-<br><br>          al issue at trial.<br>                   __ _____<br><br>                    Viewed  in  proper procedural  context,  therefore, the<br><br>          present claim hinges entirely  on URI's unremitting allocation of<br><br>          the burdens of persuasion  and production to Chesterton, and  not<br><br>          on  any lack of opportunity  to raise or  substantiate its \"func-<br><br>          tional integration\" claim.   Significantly, our remand order took<br><br>          no position  as to which party  would be obliged  to come forward<br>                             _____<br><br>          with evidence of functional integration, nor did it suggest  that<br><br>          proof of  lack of  functional integration  was required  in every<br><br>          case.  <br><br>                    Of  course,  Chesterton, the  party  invoking diversity<br><br>          jurisdiction, bears  the ultimate burden of  proving diversity of<br>                                   ________<br><br>          citizenship.

After all, while not immutable,<br><br>          the  citizenship  of a  public  corporation,  like its  domicile,<br><br>          should be  accorded a  reasonable measure  of permanence; at  the<br><br>          very  least, ordinary  fluctuations  in  the university's  budget<br><br>          ought not occasion continual  judicial reevaluation.

In our  view,<br><br>          this  approach best  comports with  the analysis  contemplated in<br><br>          Moor. <br>          ____<br><br>                    In considering whether Chesterton carried its burden of<br><br>          persuasion on the  issue of  financial autonomy, we  think it  is<br><br>          inescapable that the Board's nonappropriated revenues represent a<br><br>          substantial budget component; tuition, housing, dining and admin-<br><br>          istrative  fees, donations,  bequests,  federal  grants, and  the<br><br>          proceeds from discretionary sales and leases of URI property  are<br><br>          not  insubstantial  revenue sources.    Thus,  on its  face,  the<br><br>          enabling statute demonstrates Board  access to, and control over,<br><br>          substantial amounts  of nonappropriated  revenues.   Following  a<br><br>          trial on the merits, and  absent any indication that URI did  not<br><br>          have  a  fair opportunity  to  identify  and produce  statistical<br><br>          evidence which  might rebut  Chesterton's demonstration  that the<br><br>          enabling  statute  confers the  requisite  financial  autonomy to<br><br>          qualify the  Board for citizenship  under Moor, we  conclude that<br>                                                    ____<br><br>          URI's appellate challenge comes too late.<br><br>                    Finally, in a similar vein,  URI suggests that it might<br>                                                                      _____<br><br>          be  that the State routinely attunes  its annual appropriation to<br><br>          the  Board in  response to  the total  amount  of nonappropriated<br><br>          funds available to the Board, including the nonappropriated funds<br><br>          accumulated from  prior fiscal years and those anticipated in the<br><br>          current  fiscal  year.   Under this  \"linkage\" theory,  the State<br><br>          could  compel the Board to expend all accumulated and anticipated<br>                                     ______<br><br><br>                                          41<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          nonappropriated funds  merely by  limiting its  annual appropria-<br><br>          tions to the  difference between the Board's  fiscal year revenue<br><br>          requirements and the total available nonappropriated funds.<br><br>                    URI's contention  that the State might  link its appro-<br><br>          priations to  the availability of nonappropriated  Board funds is<br><br>          pure  conjecture.    Arrayed  against URI's  conjecture  are  the<br><br>          explicit provisions of the enabling statute,  as amended in 1988,<br><br>          which expressly  state that all nonappropriated  funds, including<br><br>          accumulated  nonappropriated  funds, are  to  be  deposited in  a<br><br>          segregated account under the exclusive control of the Board.

Evidence of Damages<br>               ___________________<br><br>                    In  a ruling  that  proved fatal  to  URI's claims  for<br><br>          damages for breach of warranties, the district court excluded the<br><br>          testimony of URI's longtime  controller, Ronald Osborne, a certi-<br><br>          fied public accountant in charge of all URI financial information<br><br>          and  accounting practices.    URI  called  Osborne as  an  expert<br><br>          witness to establish  the amount of money it spent to correct the<br><br>          corrosion problem allegedly left unremedied by Chesterton's 1-2-3<br><br>          System.  URI  proffered no  other evidence on  damages.   Osborne<br><br>          testified on direct examination  that he previously had performed<br><br>          cost assessments  on various  URI projects,  and  that his  usual<br><br>          procedure  was  to  consult  URI financial  records  and  conduct<br><br>          interviews with URI personnel involved in the particular project.<br><br>          He consulted GSO  records to ascertain the  overtime hours worked<br><br>          in 1985, and conducted several interviews with URI employees  and<br><br>          various \"private vendors\" to  ascertain which overtime hours were<br><br>          attributable to  the correction of Endeavor's  corrosion problem.<br><br>          To these figures he added the  cost of fringe benefits (22%)  for<br><br>                                          43<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          overtime  employees,  and  \"indirect costs,\"  at  an  unspecified<br><br>          percentage rate,  which included  expenses for  \"accounting, pur-<br><br>          chasing,  maintenance,  [and] utilities.\"   Before  Osborne could<br><br>          state an opinion concerning  the total monetary damages sustained<br><br>          by URI, Chesterton objected  on the grounds that (1)  Osborne was<br><br>          not a  qualified expert on  damages calculation, (2)  the factual<br><br>          bases for his calculation  included inadmissible hearsay, and (3)<br><br>          the damages  calculation included inappropriate factors,  such as<br><br>          \"indirect costs.\"<br><br>                    URI  relied on Federal Rules of Evidence 703 and 705 as<br><br>          grounds  for the admission of Osborne's expert opinion.  Rule 703<br><br>          provides that \"[t]he  facts or  data . . . upon  which an  expert<br><br>          bases an opinion or inference . . .

R. Evid. 703.  Rule 705  provides that \"[t]he<br><br>          expert  may testify  in terms  of opinion  or inference  and give<br><br>          reasons therefor without prior disclosure of the underlying facts<br><br>          or data, unless the court requires  otherwise.

Nevertheless, Rules<br><br>          703 and 705 do not afford automatic entitlements to proponents of<br><br>          expert  testimony.   Rule 703  requires the  trial court  to give<br><br>          \"careful consideration\" to any  inadmissible facts upon which the<br><br>          expert will  rely,  in order  to  determine whether  reliance  is<br><br>          \"reasonable.\" Id. at  545.

A litigant should be able to<br><br>          ascertain, with relatively modest effort and legal fees, where to<br><br>          bring its  lawsuit.   But if  the court's  analysis of a  \"myriad<br><br>          factors\" --  which are \"by  no means exhaustive\" -- is  to be the<br><br>          governing standard,  future litigants in cases  involving similar<br><br>          state agencies had better be prepared to pay a lot  of legal fees<br><br>          for  their lawyers to  (1) read and digest  the prose; (2) gather<br><br>          the relevant  information and apply  the legal analysis  to their<br><br>          client or  opponent; (3) litigate  the issues at  pretrial, trial<br><br>          and on  appeal.  Those litigants had  also better be prepared for<br><br>          delays in decisionmaking as lawyers and judges ponder  the issue:<br><br>          the  \"myriad factors\" will seldom yield a certain outcome until a<br><br>          court actually decides the issue.<br><br>                    To  be sure, this court  is not alone  in adopting this<br><br>          approach.

This summary paints a<br>                                  __<br><br>          picture of  a \"sufficiently independent corporate  character\"  to<br><br>          match that  of the California county  at issue in Moor.   No more<br>                                                            ____<br><br>          should  be necessary.2  I therefore concur in the court's evalua-<br><br>          tion that jurisdiction exists, but not in the prolonged reasoning<br><br>          by which it reaches that conclusion.<br><br>                    I add one postscript:   The careful reader will observe<br><br>          that neither I nor the court have articulated any  jurisdictional<br><br>          policy  arguments in  determining the  citizenship of  the Board.<br><br>          The policy  interests behind  the court's myriad  factor approach<br><br>          are borrowed -- I believe  ill-advisedly -- from Eleventh  Amend-<br><br>          ment cases where the primary  goal is to protect the state  trea-<br><br>          sury.   Perhaps  the  court's complex  analysis and  case-by-case<br><br>          approach  are  justified there.   The  policy goals  in diversity<br><br>          jurisdiction  analysis are  somewhat different,  involving avail-<br><br>          ability of  an unbiased  forum.

Utah Constr.  Co., 278  U.S.<br>          ______________________________________________________<br>          194,  199 (1929).    There, a  lawsuit  was brought  against  the<br>          Wyoming State Highway Commission (an unincorporated state agency)<br>          and its individual members, premised on diversity of citizenship.<br>          The Supreme  Court found  no diversity jurisdiction.   Primarily,<br>          the Court determined  that the  suit was not  really against  the<br>          Highway  Commission  but against  the  State  of Wyoming  itself,<br>          because it  was the State that  was actually a party  to the con-<br>          tract  in dispute  and  neither the  Commission  nor any  of  its<br>          members had assumed any responsibility.   The sentence most often<br>          quoted (and referred to in Moor) states:  \"The Commission was but<br>                                     ____<br>          the arm  or alter ego  of the State with  no funds or  ability to<br>                      _____ ___<br>          respond in damages.\"  278 U.S. at 199.<br><br>                                          54<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          dressed them in its analysis of what is a citizen  and neither do<br><br>          I.   In any event,  such interests  can best be  served by  clear<br><br>          rules  for the generality of cases; every single piece of litiga-<br><br>          tion  need not require a  return to first  principles.  Probably,<br><br>          the major policy interest at stake  lies in how the conclusion is<br>                                                      ___<br><br>          reached.   Simplicity from the courts of appeals (and the Supreme<br><br>          Court)  on these  gatekeeping and  procedural issues  will permit<br><br>          lawyers and  judges -- and  most importantly,  the  parties -- to<br><br>          deal  with the  merits of disputes  in a  simple and  less costly<br><br>          manner.   Needlessly complex jurisdictional rules  like those the<br><br>          court  advances here can only  perplex the litigants  as they pay<br><br>          mounting  attorney fees  and  suffer through  procedural  delays.<br><br>          Congress has ordered district courts to pay heed to such concerns<br><br>          in  the Civil Justice Reform  Act of 1990,  28 U.S.C.    471-482.<br><br>          Appellate courts  can make that task easier by resisting unneces-<br><br>          sary subtleties and  focusing instead on  rules that ensure  pre-<br><br>          dictability and certainty, as well as fairness.<br><br>                    In all other respects, I join the court's opinion.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                                          55<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></pre>\n\n</div>",

The R/V Endeavor is a  vessel chartered by the<br><br>          National Science Foundation to  URI's Graduate School of Oceanog-<br><br>          raphy  (GSO) for research purposes.   In the summer of 1985, John<br><br>          Metz, the GSO's port  engineer, discovered serious rust corrosion<br><br>          on  the inside of the  Endeavor's steel ballast  tanks, which are<br><br>          submerged in  salt water during  normal operation of  the vessel.<br><br>          Responding  to  a  Chesterton advertisement,  Metz  received test<br><br>          samples of  \"Rust Transformer,\"  a Chesterton product  which pur-<br><br>          portedly converts surface corrosion  into a rust-inhibitor, which<br><br>          in turn serves  as a base for further coats  of paint.  Satisfied<br><br>          with  the  test-sample  results,  Metz  invited Chesterton  sales<br><br>          representatives  aboard  the  Endeavor.    After  inspecting  the<br><br><br>                                          2<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          Endeavor's ballast tank  corrosion, Chesterton's  representatives<br><br>          recommended that  Metz use Chesterton's 1-2-3  System (using Rust<br><br>          Transformer,  a primer, and a final  enamel coat) to rehabilitate<br><br>          the  tanks.   Metz  ordered the  1-2-3  System on  September  11,<br><br>          1985.1   Six months after URI completed the 1-2-3 System applica-<br><br>          tion, the  new coating on  the ballast tanks began  to loosen and<br><br>          flake  off.    URI allegedly  expended  $100,000  to correct  the<br><br>          problem.<br><br>                    URI  brought suit  against Chesterton  in Rhode  Island<br><br>          state  court  on   May 4,  1989,   alleging  negligence,   strict<br><br>          liability,  and  breaches  of  an express  warranty  and  implied<br><br>          warranties  of  merchantability  and  fitness  for  a  particular<br><br>          purpose.    Chesterton promptly  removed  the  action to  federal<br><br>          district court.   URI moved for remand on the ground that URI, as<br><br>          an \"alter  ego, arm, or agent\"  of the State of  Rhode Island, is<br><br>          not  a \"citizen\"  of Rhode  Island for  diversity purposes.   The<br><br>          district court denied URI's  remand motion without an evidentiary<br><br>          hearing,  relying  on an  earlier  district  court decision,  see<br>                                                                        ___<br><br>          Vanlaarhoven v.

On the other hand, the product's written instruc-<br>          tions advised  that the system  was not recommended  for surfaces<br>          regularly  immersed in sea water.   In an  amended complaint, URI<br>          alleged that  Chesterton  representatives observed  the URI  crew<br>          applying  the 1-2-3 System to the ballast tanks, but said nothing<br>          to URI representatives  about the unsuitability of the  system or<br>          its improper application.<br><br>                                          3<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                    This  court declined  to entertain  URI's interlocutory<br><br>          appeal  from the  jurisdictional  ruling  but noted  disagreement<br><br>          among  the circuits as to the proper criteria for determining the<br><br>          citizenship  of state  universities for  diversity purposes.   We<br><br>          recommended that the district court conduct \"limited factfinding\"<br><br>          on remand relating to several factors pertinent to URI's citizen-<br><br>          ship,  including  (1)  \"the degree  of  URI's  dependence on  and<br><br>          functional integration  with the  state treasury,\" (2)  \"the per-<br><br>          centage of URI's annual budget that derives from state appropria-<br><br>          tions,\"  and (3)  \"whether the legislature  bases levels  of such<br><br>          appropriations  in part  on the  amount of  nonappropriated funds<br><br>          available to URI.\"2   On remand, the district court  denied URI's<br><br>          motion  for  a pretrial  evidentiary  hearing  relating to  these<br><br>          jurisdictional  matters.   The  jury trial  began on  December 3,<br><br>          1991.

Supp. at  761 (evidence of<br>                     ___   ____  _______<br><br>          actual control by State would trump evidence of formal autonomy).<br><br>                    We emphasize that URI does not assert the existence  of<br>                                               ___            _________<br><br>          budgetary data which would demonstrate that the Board enjoys less<br><br>          financial autonomy  than the  enabling statute indicates.

Instead, URI<br><br>          insists  that Chesterton,  as the  party requesting  removal, see<br>                                                                        ___<br><br>          supra Section II.A,  was required  to bear the  entire burden  of<br>          _____                                           ______<br><br>          proof and production on every conceivable fact     even including<br><br>          \"negative\" facts     which  might prove  relevant to the  Board's<br>                                      _____ _____<br><br>          citizenship  status.  Thus, even  after trial on  the merits, URI<br><br>          speculates that  there may  be evidence  which  would preclude  a<br><br>          reliable determination as to federal diversity jurisdiction.  For<br><br>          the  reasons  hereinafter  explained,  we  think  URI inadvisably<br><br><br>                                          29<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          banked on a cramped view of the proper allocation of the  burdens<br><br>          of  proof and  production relating  to the  jurisdictional issue,<br><br>          misapprehended the proper role of  \"functional integration\" data,<br><br>          and exaggerated the import of our earlier \"recommendation\" to the<br><br>          district court for further factfinding on remand.<br><br>                    For some  reason, our  earlier invitation to  engage in<br><br>          additional factfinding  on remand  went unheeded.   URI intimates<br><br>          that it did  all it  could by requesting  a separate  evidentiary<br>                                                      ________<br><br>          hearing,  and  that  the  district court  simply  discounted  our<br><br>          recommendation  as  to  the  possible  relevance  of  \"functional<br><br>          integration\"  evidence.   In  our view,  however, URI  mischarac-<br><br>          terizes the remand order.  While we suggested the desirability of<br><br>          supplementary factfinding, the  precise factfinding procedure  to<br>                        ___________                           _________<br><br>          be employed always rests within the sound discretion of the trial<br><br>          court.

Following an unrecorded<br><br>          pretrial  conference with  counsel, the  district court  did deny<br><br>          URI's motion for a separate evidentiary hearing.  In that connec-<br><br>          tion,  URI has provided  no indication  of the  legal contentions<br><br>          advanced by either party  at the pretrial conference, nor  of the<br><br>          grounds for the  district court's decision  to bypass a  pretrial<br><br>          evidentiary hearing.  Chesterton, on the other hand, asserts that<br><br>          the conference  involved an extended discussion  about the appro-<br><br>          priateness  of a  separate pretrial hearing,  but that  the court<br><br>          opted to permit the presentation of evidence on the jurisdiction-<br><br>          al issue at trial.<br>                   __ _____<br><br>                    Viewed  in  proper procedural  context,  therefore, the<br><br>          present claim hinges entirely  on URI's unremitting allocation of<br><br>          the burdens of persuasion  and production to Chesterton, and  not<br><br>          on  any lack of opportunity  to raise or  substantiate its \"func-<br><br>          tional integration\" claim.   Significantly, our remand order took<br><br>          no position  as to which party  would be obliged  to come forward<br>                             _____<br><br>          with evidence of functional integration, nor did it suggest  that<br><br>          proof of  lack of  functional integration  was required  in every<br><br>          case.  <br><br>                    Of  course,  Chesterton, the  party  invoking diversity<br><br>          jurisdiction, bears  the ultimate burden of  proving diversity of<br>                                   ________<br><br>          citizenship.

After all, while not immutable,<br><br>          the  citizenship  of a  public  corporation,  like its  domicile,<br><br>          should be  accorded a  reasonable measure  of permanence; at  the<br><br>          very  least, ordinary  fluctuations  in  the university's  budget<br><br>          ought not occasion continual  judicial reevaluation.

In our  view,<br><br>          this  approach best  comports with  the analysis  contemplated in<br><br>          Moor. <br>          ____<br><br>                    In considering whether Chesterton carried its burden of<br><br>          persuasion on the  issue of  financial autonomy, we  think it  is<br><br>          inescapable that the Board's nonappropriated revenues represent a<br><br>          substantial budget component; tuition, housing, dining and admin-<br><br>          istrative  fees, donations,  bequests,  federal  grants, and  the<br><br>          proceeds from discretionary sales and leases of URI property  are<br><br>          not  insubstantial  revenue sources.    Thus,  on its  face,  the<br><br>          enabling statute demonstrates Board  access to, and control over,<br><br>          substantial amounts  of nonappropriated  revenues.   Following  a<br><br>          trial on the merits, and  absent any indication that URI did  not<br><br>          have  a  fair opportunity  to  identify  and produce  statistical<br><br>          evidence which  might rebut  Chesterton's demonstration  that the<br><br>          enabling  statute  confers the  requisite  financial  autonomy to<br><br>          qualify the  Board for citizenship  under Moor, we  conclude that<br>                                                    ____<br><br>          URI's appellate challenge comes too late.<br><br>                    Finally, in a similar vein,  URI suggests that it might<br>                                                                      _____<br><br>          be  that the State routinely attunes  its annual appropriation to<br><br>          the  Board in  response to  the total  amount  of nonappropriated<br><br>          funds available to the Board, including the nonappropriated funds<br><br>          accumulated from  prior fiscal years and those anticipated in the<br><br>          current  fiscal  year.

Arrayed  against URI's  conjecture  are  the<br><br>          explicit provisions of the enabling statute,  as amended in 1988,<br><br>          which expressly  state that all nonappropriated  funds, including<br><br>          accumulated  nonappropriated  funds, are  to  be  deposited in  a<br><br>          segregated account under the exclusive control of the Board.

Evidence of Damages<br>               ___________________<br><br>                    In  a ruling  that  proved fatal  to  URI's claims  for<br><br>          damages for breach of warranties, the district court excluded the<br><br>          testimony of URI's longtime  controller, Ronald Osborne, a certi-<br><br>          fied public accountant in charge of all URI financial information<br><br>          and  accounting practices.    URI  called  Osborne as  an  expert<br><br>          witness to establish  the amount of money it spent to correct the<br><br>          corrosion problem allegedly left unremedied by Chesterton's 1-2-3<br><br>          System.  URI  proffered no  other evidence on  damages.   Osborne<br><br>          testified on direct examination  that he previously had performed<br><br>          cost assessments  on various  URI projects,  and  that his  usual<br><br>          procedure  was  to  consult  URI financial  records  and  conduct<br><br>          interviews with URI personnel involved in the particular project.<br><br>          He consulted GSO  records to ascertain the  overtime hours worked<br><br>          in 1985, and conducted several interviews with URI employees  and<br><br>          various \"private vendors\" to  ascertain which overtime hours were<br><br>          attributable to  the correction of Endeavor's  corrosion problem.<br><br>          To these figures he added the  cost of fringe benefits (22%)  for<br><br>                                          43<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          overtime  employees,  and  \"indirect costs,\"  at  an  unspecified<br><br>          percentage rate,  which included  expenses for  \"accounting, pur-<br><br>          chasing,  maintenance,  [and] utilities.\"   Before  Osborne could<br><br>          state an opinion concerning  the total monetary damages sustained<br><br>          by URI, Chesterton objected  on the grounds that (1)  Osborne was<br><br>          not a  qualified expert on  damages calculation, (2)  the factual<br><br>          bases for his calculation  included inadmissible hearsay, and (3)<br><br>          the damages  calculation included inappropriate factors,  such as<br><br>          \"indirect costs.\"<br><br>                    URI  relied on Federal Rules of Evidence 703 and 705 as<br><br>          grounds  for the admission of Osborne's expert opinion.  Rule 703<br><br>          provides that \"[t]he  facts or  data . . . upon  which an  expert<br><br>          bases an opinion or inference . . .

R. Evid. 703.  Rule 705  provides that \"[t]he<br><br>          expert  may testify  in terms  of opinion  or inference  and give<br><br>          reasons therefor without prior disclosure of the underlying facts<br><br>          or data, unless the court requires  otherwise.

Nevertheless, Rules<br><br>          703 and 705 do not afford automatic entitlements to proponents of<br><br>          expert  testimony.   Rule 703  requires the  trial court  to give<br><br>          \"careful consideration\" to any  inadmissible facts upon which the<br><br>          expert will  rely,  in order  to  determine whether  reliance  is<br><br>          \"reasonable.\" Id. at  545.

Apparently,  URI came  to  trial with  no supporting<br><br>          documentation  whatever to  substantiate Osborne's  assessment of<br><br>          damages.

Rather, Osborne<br><br>          relied on  \"interviews\" with undisclosed URI  employees and \"out-<br><br>          side vendors,\" conducted either by himself or other URI officials<br><br>          who reported to him.   The trial court quite  reasonably expected<br><br>          URI  to explain,  out  of the  presence of  the  jury, the  basic<br><br>          assumptions  undergirding  its  witness's   seemingly  unorthodox<br><br>          method of reconstruction.<br><br>                    Rather than provide an explanation, however, URI simply<br><br>          accepted a directed verdict  on the issue of damages.

As far as  we can discern,<br>          the  amendment's only significant  factual supplementation to the<br>          original complaint would allege that Chesterton's representatives<br>          \"came aboard the Research vessel Endeavor while the Chesterton 1-<br>          2-3 System was actually being applied and said  nothing as to its<br>          not being  equal to the task of painting the ballast tanks.\"  The<br>          amended complaint  generally shifted  the focus of  URI's allega-<br>          tions  from Chesterton's  defective manufacture  of a  product to<br>          Chesterton's negligence in recommending an ill-suited product, or<br>          its failure to  give adequate or  continuing instructions on  its<br>          use.

Is this approach really essential for deter-<br><br>          mining  whether a federal  court has jurisdiction?   Granted that<br><br>          our system limits the jurisdiction  of federal courts, a rational<br><br>          observer might nevertheless  expect simple gatekeeping rules  for<br><br>          what gets in and what is kept out.   A litigant should be able to<br><br>          ascertain, with relatively modest effort and legal fees, where to<br><br>          bring its  lawsuit.   But if  the court's  analysis of a  \"myriad<br><br>          factors\" --  which are \"by  no means exhaustive\" -- is  to be the<br><br>          governing standard,  future litigants in cases  involving similar<br><br>          state agencies had better be prepared to pay a lot  of legal fees<br><br>          for  their lawyers to  (1) read and digest  the prose; (2) gather<br><br>          the relevant  information and apply  the legal analysis  to their<br><br>          client or  opponent; (3) litigate  the issues at  pretrial, trial<br><br>          and on  appeal.  Those litigants had  also better be prepared for<br><br>          delays in decisionmaking as lawyers and judges ponder  the issue:<br><br>          the  \"myriad factors\" will seldom yield a certain outcome until a<br><br>          court actually decides the issue.<br><br>                    To  be sure, this court  is not alone  in adopting this<br><br>          approach.   Other courts have also applied a multitude of factors<br><br>          (with no  particular weight assigned), in  determining the status<br><br><br>                                          50<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          of a particular state agency.

But  in Moor the Supreme  Court spent only<br>                          ____           ____<br><br>          one paragraph  summarizing California  statutes to  conclude that<br><br>          the county was a corporation with important powers independent of<br><br>          the state and a second paragraph summarizing a California Supreme<br><br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               1I  agree with the court that there is no legal entity under<br>          Rhode Island law known as the University of Rhode Island.<br><br>                                          52<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          Court decision  finding California  counties to  be corporations.<br><br>          Based on those two summary paragraphs, the Supreme Court conclud-<br><br>          ed  that \"the  county  has a  sufficiently independent  corporate<br><br>          character  to dictate that it be treated as a citizen of Califor-<br><br>          nia under our  decision in Cowles v.

The Board that governs<br><br>          the University of  Rhode Island is a  \"public corporation, empow-<br><br>          ered to sue  and be sued  in its  own name, to  have a  corporate<br><br>          seal,  and to  exercise  all the  powers,  in addition  to  those<br><br>          hereinafter  specifically  enumerated,  usually  appertaining  to<br><br>          public  corporations entrusted  with  control  of  post-secondary<br><br>          educational institutions and functions.\"  R.I. General Laws   16-<br>                                                    _________________<br><br>          59-1-(a) (1992).   Under Rhode Island law, a \"public corporation\"<br><br>          is \"a corporate entity which is  considered a governmental agency<br><br>          but which  has a distinct  legal existence from the  state or any<br><br>          municipality, [and] does not constitute  a department of state or<br><br>          municipal government . . . .\"  Id. 22-10-2(f).  The Board has the<br>                                         __<br><br>          corporate power to acquire, hold, and dispose of real and person-<br><br>          al property (albeit in  trust for the state).

Id.   16-59-4, 8.   This summary paints a<br>                                  __<br><br>          picture of  a \"sufficiently independent corporate  character\"  to<br><br>          match that  of the California county  at issue in Moor.   No more<br>                                                            ____<br><br>          should  be necessary.2  I therefore concur in the court's evalua-<br><br>          tion that jurisdiction exists, but not in the prolonged reasoning<br><br>          by which it reaches that conclusion.<br><br>                    I add one postscript:   The careful reader will observe<br><br>          that neither I nor the court have articulated any  jurisdictional<br><br>          policy  arguments in  determining the  citizenship of  the Board.<br><br>          The policy  interests behind  the court's myriad  factor approach<br><br>          are borrowed -- I believe  ill-advisedly -- from Eleventh  Amend-<br><br>          ment cases where the primary  goal is to protect the state  trea-<br><br>          sury.   Perhaps  the  court's complex  analysis and  case-by-case<br><br>          approach  are  justified there.   The  policy goals  in diversity<br><br>          jurisdiction  analysis are  somewhat different,  involving avail-<br><br>          ability of  an unbiased  forum.   The Supreme Court  has not  ad-<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               2Since the  Board is a public corporation, it seems unneces-<br>          sary to pursue  the \"arm or  alter ego\" alternative set  forth in<br>                                       _____ ___<br>          State Highway Comm'n  of Wyoming  v. Utah Constr.  Co., 278  U.S.<br>          ______________________________________________________<br>          194,  199 (1929).    There, a  lawsuit  was brought  against  the<br>          Wyoming State Highway Commission (an unincorporated state agency)<br>          and its individual members, premised on diversity of citizenship.<br>          The Supreme  Court found  no diversity jurisdiction.   Primarily,<br>          the Court determined  that the  suit was not  really against  the<br>          Highway  Commission  but against  the  State  of Wyoming  itself,<br>          because it  was the State that  was actually a party  to the con-<br>          tract  in dispute  and  neither the  Commission  nor any  of  its<br>          members had assumed any responsibility.   The sentence most often<br>          quoted (and referred to in Moor) states:  \"The Commission was but<br>                                     ____<br>          the arm  or alter ego  of the State with  no funds or  ability to<br>                      _____ ___<br>          respond in damages.\"  278 U.S. at 199.<br><br>                                          54<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          dressed them in its analysis of what is a citizen  and neither do<br><br>          I.   In any event,  such interests  can best be  served by  clear<br><br>          rules  for the generality of cases; every single piece of litiga-<br><br>          tion  need not require a  return to first  principles.  Probably,<br><br>          the major policy interest at stake  lies in how the conclusion is<br>                                                      ___<br><br>          reached.   Simplicity from the courts of appeals (and the Supreme<br><br>          Court)  on these  gatekeeping and  procedural issues  will permit<br><br>          lawyers and  judges -- and  most importantly,  the  parties -- to<br><br>          deal  with the  merits of disputes  in a  simple and  less costly<br><br>          manner.   Needlessly complex jurisdictional rules  like those the<br><br>          court  advances here can only  perplex the litigants  as they pay<br><br>          mounting  attorney fees  and  suffer through  procedural  delays.<br><br>          Congress has ordered district courts to pay heed to such concerns<br><br>          in  the Civil Justice Reform  Act of 1990,  28 U.S.C.    471-482.<br><br>          Appellate courts  can make that task easier by resisting unneces-<br><br>          sary subtleties and  focusing instead on  rules that ensure  pre-<br><br>          dictability and certainty, as well as fairness.<br><br>                    In all other respects, I join the court's opinion.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                                          55<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></pre>\n\n</div>",
