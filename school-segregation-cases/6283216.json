Sticks and stones may break\n\nsome bones, but harassment can hurt forever.           \"Cunt,\" \"bitch,\"\n\n\"lesbo\": all are but a smattering of the vile verbal assaults the\n\nplaintiff in this gender discrimination case, Lori Franchina, a\n\nformer   lieutenant   firefighter,   was   regularly   subjected   to   by\n\nmembers of the Providence Fire Department (\"the Department\").           She\n\nwas also spit on, shoved, and--in one particularly horrifying\n\nincident--had the blood and brain matter of a suicide-attempt\n\nvictim flung at her by a member of her own team.        After an eight-\n\nday trial, a jury in the District of Rhode Island concluded that\n\nFranchina had been discriminated against on the basis of her gender\n\nand retaliated against when she dared protest her treatment.            For\n\nher ordeal, she was awarded front pay1 as well as emotional\n\ndamages.2   The City of Providence (\"the City\") now appeals, making\n\nnumerous arguments as to why the jury verdict should be set aside\n\nor, in the alternative, why the judge's front pay award should be\n\n\n\n\n     1 Front pay awards are essentially awards of future \"damages\nfor wages from the date of judgment to some specified date in the\nfuture.\" Scarfo v. Cabletron Sys., Inc., 54 F.3d 931, 953 (1st\nCir. 1995). They serve to \"mak[e] victims of discrimination whole\nin cases where the factfinder can reasonably predict that the\nplaintiff has no reasonable prospect of obtaining comparable\nalternative employment.\" Powers v. Grinnell Corp., 915 F.2d 34,\n42â€“43 (1st Cir. 1990) (internal quotation marks omitted). A lot\nmore on that later.\n     2 The jury also awarded punitive damages but those were later\neliminated.\n\n\n                                - 3 -\n\fstricken. Because we decline to put out flames of the Department's\n\nown making, we affirm.\n\n                      Getting Our Factual Bearings\n\n             We begin, as we nearly always do, by outlining how this\n\ncase came to be.      Though the City attempts to trivialize the abuse\n\ninflicted upon Franchina while working for the Department by giving\n\nit short shrift in its brief, we decline to be as pithy in reciting\n\nFranchina's plight in order to give context both to the jury's and\n\nthe district court's ultimate determinations.3            In outlining the\n\nbackground in this case, we keep in mind that our recounting of\n\nthe facts is done \"in the light most favorable to the verdict,\n\ndeferring    'to   the    jury's   discernible   resolution    of    disputed\n\nfactual issues.'\"        Ciolino v. Gikas, 861 F.3d 296, 299 (1st Cir.\n\n2017) (quoting Raiche v. Pietroski, 623 F.3d 30, 35 (1st Cir.\n\n2010)).\n\n             Franchina testified for three days and recalled the\n\nfollowing for the jury.       In or about 2002, Franchina was assigned\n\nto the North Main Street Fire Station in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nUp   until    2006,   she    experienced    neither    discrimination     nor\n\nharassment by members of the Department.         In fact, in her lengthy\n\ntestimony,    Franchina     recounted   numerous      kind-hearted    moments\n\n\n\n     3 Indeed, doing so is especially necessary here where the\ndistrict judge, in his discretion, imposed the equitable remedy of\nfront pay.\n\n\n                                    - 4 -\n\fduring this timeframe where she felt comradery with her colleagues.\n\nShe explained, for example, that at the beginning of her career--\n\nas a young female among a workforce consisting primarily of males-\n\n-she felt that some members of the Department took her under their\n\nwings and shielded her from individuals who sometimes got too drunk\n\nor unruly at work events.\n\n           Far    from     worrying    about     discrimination,     Franchina\n\ntestified that some of her biggest concerns during her early years\n\nhad to do with Department leadership wanting to promote her too\n\nquickly.     That her superiors wanted to promote Franchina is\n\nunsurprising given her commendable professional record.               She was\n\none   of   only   eighty     applicants       accepted   to   the   Providence\n\nFirefighter Academy out of 2,300 who applied her year and, once\n\nthere, she graduated tenth in her class.             Throughout her career\n\nher superiors noted that she \"did her job . . . the way we expected\n\nit to be done\" and effused that she was \"on her game and knows her\n\nstuff.\"    Franchina's Chief also regularly received compliments\n\nabout her performance.       Franchina, however, worried that rising up\n\nthe ranks too quickly could cause resentment among more senior\n\nfirefighters and testified that she actively attempted to keep\n\nleadership from assigning her to officer roles at the beginning.\n\nNonetheless, Franchina's superiors ultimately ordered that she be\n\npromoted from Rescue Technician to Acting Rescue Lieutenant to,\n\neventually, Rescue Lieutenant.\n\n\n                                      - 5 -\n\f              Franchina's woes began in or about 2006 when she was\n\nassigned to work a shift with Andre Ferro (\"Ferro\"), a firefighter\n\nwith a history of sexually harassing female colleagues in the\n\nDepartment.4     During that shift, Franchina and Ferro were assigned\n\nto the same rescue vehicle, with Franchina serving as an acting\n\nrescue lieutenant, and Ferro assigned to be her rescue tech\n\nchauffeur.     That is to say, Ferro was responsible for driving the\n\nrescue vehicle and Franchina served as his superior.                Franchina\n\nand Ferro had never worked with one another prior to this point,\n\nthough Franchina was aware of Ferro's dubious reputation with women\n\nand was therefore apprehensive about having to spend the shift\n\nwith him.\n\n              Ferro's   notoriety   was    on   display   within   moments    of\n\nFranchina meeting him. After arriving at the station for her shift\n\nand   while    pouring    herself   a     cup   of   coffee,   Franchina     was\n\nimmediately approached by Ferro who, without missing a beat, asked\n\n\n      4This Court is familiar with Ferro. Over fifteen years ago,\nwe encountered him in a separate Title VII action. In that case,\nthe City was found to be liable under Title VII for, among other\nthings, comments Ferro made toward the plaintiff, another female\nfirefighter named Julia O'Rourke. Ferro commented on her breast\nsize (which he referred to as \"stacked\") and suggested that if she\nhad sex with him she would \"never want another man.\" O'Rourke v.\nCity of Providence, 235 F.3d 713, 718 (1st Cir. 2001). Ferro also\nforced O'Rourke to listen to his musings on different sexual\npositions he enjoyed and his love of oral sex, played videos of\nhimself having sex with his girlfriend in front of her, and\ndiscussed his sexual prowess and stamina. Id. Nonetheless, Ferro\nmaintained his employment with the Department in spite of the\nO'Rourke outcome.\n\n\n                                    - 6 -\n\fif she was a lesbian.           To repeat, this was their very first\n\nencounter.      After Franchina retorted that it was none of his\n\nbusiness, Ferro followed up with the statement, \"I don't normally\n\nlike to work with women; but, you know, we like the same thing, so\n\nI think we're going to get along.\"              Franchina testified she was\n\nappalled by his comments and as his supervisor, instructed him not\n\nto say such things.         She then immediately left for her office to\n\nescape him.     Soon thereafter, however, an emergency call came in\n\nand Franchina and Ferro were jointly dispatched to respond in their\n\nrescue vehicle.\n\n             During   the    emergency    run   Ferro    continued   with   his\n\ninappropriate prattle.        He asked, for example, if Franchina wanted\n\nto have children and quickly followed up with, \"I could help you\n\nwith   that,\"   implying     that   he   wanted   to    impregnate   her.   So\n\nincessant was the unprofessional chatter that Franchina was forced\n\nto tell Ferro on multiple occasions to stop talking because she\n\nwas    having   difficulty     hearing   the    dispatcher's    instructions.\n\nFranchina further testified that she refused to engage with Ferro's\n\nuncomfortable banter, instead riding in silence or telling him to\n\nbe quiet as needed.\n\n             During the same shift, Franchina and Ferro were also\n\ndispatched on a run that took them to the Rhode Island Hospital.\n\nWhen they arrived, two other rescue vehicles were on the scene,\n\nmeaning that a total of six firefighters were present (two in each\n\n\n                                     - 7 -\n\fvehicle).    The firefighters entered the hospital in order to pass\n\nalong reports about their respective transports (patients that had\n\nbeen transported to the hospital) and, after doing so, Franchina\n\nand the other firefighters (with the exception of Ferro) waited in\n\na holding area and chatted with one another.         At some point Ferro\n\napproached the group and began rubbing his nipples in a circular\n\nfashion, leapt up in the air, and screamed at Franchina, \"My\n\nlesbian lover!      How are you doing?\"     Nurses, doctors, patients,\n\nand patients' families were all present in the holding room to\n\nwitness this display.     Franchina testified that she was horrified\n\nand felt belittled.    The other firefighters present were similarly\n\nappalled.\n\n            Later that evening, after returning back to the station,\n\nFranchina went to her personal quarters and began changing out of\n\nher uniform.     Though she had closed the door, it was not locked.\n\nA rule, however, existed in the station requiring that if an\n\nofficer's door was closed, anyone seeking permission to enter had\n\nto first knock three times and wait for the officer to respond.\n\nNevertheless, without knocking, and while Franchina was changing,\n\nFerro opened the door to her room wearing what appeared to be only\n\nhis   boxers,   a   Providence   Fire   Department   shirt,   and   socks.\n\nFranchina, who was in her undergarments, quickly grabbed a sheet\n\noff her bed to cover herself. When Franchina asked Ferro to leave,\n\nhe refused.     She asked a second time, and he refused yet again.\n\n\n                                  - 8 -\n\fOnly after telling him to \"get the fuck out\" of the room did Ferro\n\nfinally depart.\n\n           Franchina never reported this repulsive behavior.           She\n\ndidn't have to.      Following the nipple-rubbing incident at the\n\nhospital, Chief Curt Varone, a high-level officer with authority\n\nover all of the stations within the Department, called her directly\n\nbecause he had \"gotten wind\" of what had transpired.        During the\n\nphone call, Chief Varone asked Franchina to recount the details of\n\nFerro's actions.    Based on Franchina's explanation, Chief Varone\n\nfiled a written complaint against Ferro charging him with sexual\n\nharassment and exposing him to employment termination.5         A hearing\n\nwas scheduled to determine whether Ferro would retain his job.\n\n           Once word spread about Ferro's disciplinary proceeding,\n\nfirefighters in the North Main Street station began to treat\n\nFranchina with contempt and disdain.     Firefighter Andy McDougal,\n\na subordinate to Franchina, approached her in the kitchen several\n\nweeks before Ferro's hearing and, in front of numerous other\n\nfirefighters, yelled at her and asked, \"What are you trying to get\n\nhim   fucking   fired?\"   Although   Captain   Alan   Horton,    the   top\n\nsupervisor in the North Main Street station, was present during\n\nthis exchange, he neither reprimanded McDougal nor reported the\n\nincident to Chief Varone.\n\n\n      5Ferro was, in fact, ultimately fired in 2007, but, again,\nwas allowed to subsequently return to the Department in 2008.\n\n\n                               - 9 -\n\f            The day following McDougal's kitchen outburst, McDougal-\n\n-who was responsible for cooking at the station--also stated to\n\nCaptain Horton that he would no longer prepare meals for Franchina.\n\nCaptain Horton, however, overrode McDougal, which angered him.\n\nAccording to Franchina, from that point forward, the meals McDougal\n\nprepared for her made her severely ill.                 Following several bouts\n\nof    ensuing    illness,   Franchina,       who   never     had    a   history   of\n\ngastrointestinal problems, decided to swap her meal with that of\n\na different rescue tech.          After that tech ate Franchina's meal,\n\nhe, too, became ill and had to go home sick.6\n\n            Starting in 2006, members of the North Main Street\n\nstation also began to refer to Franchina using gendered epithets.\n\nFor    example,    she    was   referred     to    openly      as   \"Frangina,\"   a\n\ncombination of her last name and the word \"vagina,\" which (as\n\nFranchina       testified   she    had     seen    on    the    popular    website\n\nUrbanDictionary.com) is also a slang term used to describe an\n\nunshaved        vagina.           See      Frangina,        Urban       Dictionary,\n\nhttps://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Frangina                     (last\n\nvisited Jan. 25, 2017).           Additionally, Franchina explained she\n\nheard male firefighters in the station refer to her as a \"bitch\"\n\nwith great regularity.          \"Who does that fucking bitch think she\n\nis?\"; \"I'm not going to help that fucking bitch\"; \"That bitch can\n\n\n       6\n      The record does not tell us how this meal preparation debacle\nwas ever resolved.\n\n\n                                        - 10 -\n\fcarry her own stretcher\" were common derogatory remarks hurled at\n\nFranchina.\n\n             The men of the North Main Street station did not limit\n\ntheir harassment of Franchina to verbal attacks.           Rather, at one\n\npoint they began utilizing a group white board in one of the common\n\nareas to further taunt her.     Twenty-one total insults were written\n\non the board including: \"Be careful how you talk to her, she'll\n\nbark at you,\" \"You get what you get, bitch,\" and \"Frangina leads\n\nTeam Lesbo to victory.\"      Franchina testified that she personally\n\nheard   Captain   Peter   Spedutti,    a   thirty-year    veteran    of   the\n\nDepartment, point at the white board and say, \"I'll show her.\"\n\nShe also later witnessed him boisterously brag to a younger\n\nfirefighter about what was written on the white board.              The list\n\nremained up for over fourteen hours. Although Franchina complained\n\nto Chief Michael Crawford, a superior officer in the Department,\n\nabout   what   was   being   written   about   her   on   the   board,    the\n\nperpetrators were not reprimanded.\n\n             Based on trial testimony, Franchina also suggested that\n\nthe actions of the North Main Street station put the lives of the\n\npeople of Providence at risk, including, in one instance, that of\n\nan unborn child and the child's mother.         About a month prior to\n\nFranchina leaving the North Main Street station in 2007, Franchina\n\nwas dispatched to a pre-natal facility in response to a pregnant\n\nmother experiencing fetal distress.          In order to get oxygen to\n\n\n                                 - 11 -\n\fboth the mother and baby, a device known as a non-rebreather was\n\nneeded     because   the   fetal     heartrate   was   severely   elevated.\n\nFirefighter McDougal, who had already been avoiding eye contact\n\nwith Franchina and who did not want to work with her (or, remember,\n\ncook for her), was also on the scene.            Though Franchina tasked\n\nMcDougal with securing the re-breather around the patientâ€™s nose\n\nand mouth, he continued to let the device slip off, thus preventing\n\noxygen from properly being transported to the patient.            Franchina\n\nhad to order him to get away from the patient so she could properly\n\nsecure the device herself.         Such instances of insubordination with\n\nMcDougal, Franchina recalled, were common and intentional.\n\n            Franchina was eventually transferred in 2007 from the\n\nNorth Main Street station to the Branch Avenue station and,\n\ninitially, her experiences at Branch Avenue were good.              Things,\n\nhowever, went south and her colleagues at that station began to\n\ndisplay similar behaviors to those at the North Main Street\n\nstation.    Franchina testified that the beginning of the bad times\n\nseemed to coincide with call-back shifts in which McDougal was\n\nassigned to work in the Branch Avenue station.7           During one call-\n\nback, McDougal walked into the kitchen where members of the Branch\n\nAvenue station were convening (including Franchina) and exclaimed\n\n\n\n     7  Call-back shifts are additional overtime shifts that\nfirefighters in the Department may pick up for additional\ncompensation.\n\n\n                                     - 12 -\n\floudly, \"affirmative action's killing this fucking job.\"                       An\n\nofficer who was present did not reprimand him for this outburst.\n\nOn another occasion, during a shift change, he purposely pushed\n\nFranchina       into    a   wall   when    nobody    was   looking.     Franchina\n\ncomplained about the incident to Chief Al Horton8 but nothing was\n\ndone.\n\n               Franchina explained at trial that following McDougal's\n\ncall-backs at the Branch Avenue station, she regularly began to be\n\ncalled \"bitch,\" \"cunt,\" and \"Frangina.\"                She also testified that\n\na subordinate flicked her Lieutenant's insignia on her collar and\n\nwhispered, \"I will never take a fucking order from you.\"\n\n               Franchina also testified to the inappropriate behavior\n\nthat Branch Avenue station firefighters would exhibit on emergency\n\nruns to spite her. In one instance, a firefighter purposely failed\n\nto put a wheelchair on one of Franchina's rescue vehicles when she\n\nwas responding to a patient with cerebral palsy who was wheel-\n\nchair       dependent    for   transportation.         Franchina    reported   the\n\nincident to Chief Horton but the firefighter was not reprimanded.\n\nIn   another      run,      Franchina     and    a   number   of   Branch   Avenue\n\nfirefighters responded to a car accident involving two individuals\n\nwho were severely injured.          One of them had been decapped (meaning\n\na portion of his scalp had been severed).                  Franchina was able to\n\n\n        8\n       While we referred to Horton as Captain Horton previously,\nby this point he had been promoted to Chief.\n\n\n                                        - 13 -\n\fget this victim onto a stretcher and then into a rescue vehicle\n\nbut,   while     treating   the    victim,       realized     that   none    of    the\n\nfirefighters at the scene were behind the driverâ€™s wheel to\n\ntransport the victim to the hospital.                After requesting a driver\n\nnumerous times from the firefighters on scene, Franchina was\n\naddressed by Lieutenant Anthony Lancellotti who, in a sour tone,\n\nbarked \"You'll get a driver when you get your driver.\"                      The car\n\ncrash victim later died.\n\n           During another run, Franchina and several Branch Avenue\n\nfirefighters--including           Lieutenant        Robert      Jackson,        Rescue\n\nTechnician Paul Tang, and Firefighter Sean McGarty--responded to\n\na   suicide-attempt    victim      who    had     shot     himself   in   the   head.\n\nFranchina was the officer in charge at the scene.                          Franchina\n\nordered Jackson to assist in putting the body of the victim onto\n\na stair chair so that he could be carried downstairs to the rescue\n\nvehicle.    Jackson, however, refused to comply, folded his arms,\n\nand    stated,    \"That's   a     lot    of      blood.\"       McGarty    was     also\n\ninsubordinate, and refused to comply with Franchina's directive to\n\nmove the victim to the chair.             McGarty quipped, \"if he wanted to\n\nkill himself, maybe we should just let him.\"                    Franchina ordered\n\nthe men at least four times to move the victim onto the chair.\n\nNone would comply.      Tang, in fact, took the chair and slammed it\n\nopen, but would not help put the victim in it.                            Eventually\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 14 -\n\fFranchina had to find a police officer to assist her since her own\n\nmen remained insubordinate.\n\n            Once    the    suicide-attempt         victim   was      in   the   rescue\n\nvehicle, Tang performed CPR on the victim.                  The gloves Tang wore\n\nbecame severely encrusted with blood and pieces of brain matter.\n\nAfter    Tang    completed    CPR,    he   sat   upright      with    his    hands   at\n\nFranchina's eye level.          He then removed the gloves, purposely\n\nsnapping them off in such a way as to fling the bloody debris onto\n\nFranchina's face, nose, hair, neck, eyes, ears, and mouth.\n\n            Immediately following this incident (and as a result of\n\nit), Franchina went out on disability leave for six months' time.\n\nShe also confidentially reported the incident to Chief Crawford,\n\nand     though   Crawford     contacted      the     City's     Equal       Employment\n\nOpportunity (\"EEO\") Officer, the complaint form he completed noted\n\nthat he believed Franchina was \"blowing [the incident] out of\n\nproportion.\"         The     City's    EEO   officer,         however,       concluded\n\ndifferently:\n\n        there appears to be AMPLE merit to [Franchina's] claim\n        of MULTIPLE & REPEATED violations of [Providence Fire\n        Department] RULES AND REGULATIONS.\n\n        Even seems plausible that the pervasiveness of this\n        behavior creates a HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENT for her.\n        Also seems clear that [the Department] has FAILED to\n        STOP the behavior.\n\n\n\n\n                                      - 15 -\n\fAmended Joint App'x at 1046 (emphasis in original).                     The EEO\n\nofficer testified at trial that she was unaware if anyone was ever\n\nultimately disciplined for their actions toward Franchina.\n\n             Following her return to the Department after the six-\n\nmonth leave, the abuse from her colleagues continued.                     At a\n\nDecember 2009 Christmas party in the Firefighter's Union Hall,\n\nFranchina was berated by McGarty (we will call this event the\n\n\"Union Hall Incident\").        He screamed obscenities at her, spit as\n\nhe yelled at her, and, at a whopping 6'6\", attempted to use his\n\nbody to block her from leaving the hall so he could continue his\n\nbellowing.    He called her a \"fucking doughnut,\" a \"fucking zero,\"\n\nand a \"fucking loser.\"          Two senior officers, Lieutenant Elliot\n\nMurphy and Lieutenant Robert Jackson were both about fifteen to\n\ntwenty feet away from where this harassment was occurring, yet\n\nsaid nothing.    In fact, when Franchina, seeking assistance, called\n\nout to Lieutenant Jackson--McGarty's direct supervisor--Jackson\n\nresponded,     \"I'm   not    your   fucking    baby-sitter\"       and   allowed\n\nMcGarty's tormenting to continue.\n\n             In response to this incident, Franchina sought first a\n\ntemporary restraining order (\"TRO\") against McGarty, which a Rhode\n\nIsland   state-court        judge   granted,    and   then    a    preliminary\n\ninjunction, which was also granted.            The injunction specifically\n\nrestrained McGarty from \"interfering with, molesting, harassing,\n\nannoying or contacting [Franchina] in any manner, directly or\n\n\n                                    - 16 -\n\findirectly.\"      The only exception to this injunctive relief was a\n\ncarve-out allowing the two to interact with one another \"on an\n\nemergency call, that is, specifically when [McGarty] is doing a\n\ncall on behalf of the fire department and he is on the scene.\"\n\nApart from that narrow exception, the superior court left it up to\n\nthe Department to prevent Franchina and McGarty from encountering\n\none another.   Chief Michael Dillon, Assistant Chief of Operations,\n\nsubsequently issued an order barring McGarty from working any call-\n\nbacks in stations that had a rescue unit, thus ensuring that\n\nFranchina   (as    a   rescue   lieutenant)      and   McGarty   would   never\n\ninteract.    Nonetheless, Chief Scott Mello, who was in charge of\n\nscheduling, testified that he believed such an order was impossible\n\nto enforce and, moreover, that he viewed the order as \"more of a\n\nsuggestion.\"      No surprise, then, that the order was not actually\n\nfollowed and McGarty violated it at least four separate times.\n\n            Franchina's    final    day     as    an    active-duty      rescue\n\nlieutenant was October 28, 2010.            That day, she arrived at the\n\nBranch Avenue Station only to discover that McGarty was on duty\n\nworking there.     McGarty and various other firefighters, including\n\nChief Mello (the scheduler discussed above), were on the second-\n\nfloor landing of the station, talking negatively about Franchina\n\nin a raucous manner.      Franchina heard them making fun of her and\n\nloudly exclaiming, \"Do you know who was in the fucking station\n\ntoday?   That bitch was in the station.\"          Franchina confronted the\n\n\n                                   - 17 -\n\fgroup and then reported the incident to Chief Horton.                   Again, no\n\ndisciplinary action was ever taken against anyone as a result of\n\nthis incident.\n\n             The    constant      ridicule        and   harassment      Franchina\n\nexperienced caused her to be placed on injured-on-duty (\"IOD\")\n\nstatus.      Still, in order to remain an active member of the\n\nDepartment,        Franchina     was     required       to    perform     various\n\nadministrative tasks at the Branch Avenue Station.               She testified\n\nthat she performed these tasks \"weekly\" for a \"good portion\" of\n\n2011.     The abuse, however, did not stop even when Franchina was\n\nclassified    as    IOD.       While   at   the    station,    she   would   hear\n\nfirefighters make disparaging comments about her such as \"[t]he\n\nbitch is in the house,\" and \"F that bitch . . . thank God she's\n\nnot here anymore.\"\n\n             One of the Department chiefs eventually requested that\n\nFranchina no longer come into the station.              Thereafter, Franchina\n\nremained employed with IOD status (for a total of three more\n\nyears), but she no longer physically reported in.               On November 30,\n\n2011, Franchina filed a Charge of Discrimination with the Rhode\n\nIsland Commission for Human Rights (\"RICHR\") and with the Equal\n\nEmployment    Opportunity       Commission      (\"EEOC\").      She   officially\n\nretired on disability on December 19, 2013, after being diagnosed\n\nwith severe post-traumatic stress resulting from the numerous\n\nwork-related incidents that occurred.              She testified that she can\n\n\n                                       - 18 -\n\fnever again work as a rescue lieutenant as a result of her\n\npermanent disability, which the City does not contest.                      By the\n\ntime Franchina officially retired, she had submitted approximately\n\nforty different written statements complaining of harassment,\n\ndiscrimination, and retaliation to higher-ups in the Department.\n\n            At      trial,    numerous    individuals     besides       Franchina\n\ntestified    to     the   disparities    and   harassment      faced   by    female\n\nemployees of the Department.        Lieutenant Danielle Masse testified,\n\nfor example, that women were treated as \"less competent\" than men\n\nand were \"spoken to as if they have no authority.\"                      She also\n\ntestified that when women brought issues to the Department's chain\n\nof   command,     leadership    generally      didn't   take    the    complaints\n\nseriously or deal with them in an appropriate way.                 In fact, she\n\nstated that when a woman would voice a grievance, Department\n\nleadership often turned the problem around and blamed the female\n\nfirefighter doing the complaining.\n\n            There was also testimony that female employees who dated\n\nmale firefighters were generally treated better than those who\n\nwere not intimately involved with their male colleagues. And Chief\n\nVarone testified that there were men in the Department who openly\n\ntreated     their    female    counterparts      with   contempt.           Another\n\nfirefighter, Lieutenant Andrea Stuckus, explained at trial that\n\nshe herself was followed into the women's restroom by a drunk male\n\n\n\n\n                                    - 19 -\n\ffirefighter who had to be physically removed by other male members\n\nof the Department.\n\n            At the end of the trial the jury found in favor of\n\nFranchina   on   both       her   gender-based   hostile     work    environment\n\ndiscrimination claim, as well as her retaliation claim.                 It also\n\nawarded her punitive, emotional, and front pay damages.                    After\n\njudgment was entered for Franchina, the City filed a motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law, a motion for a new trial, and, in the\n\nalternative, a motion to amend the judgment (by striking the\n\npunitive damages and front pay awards).               After a hearing, the\n\ndistrict court denied the City's motion for judgment as a matter\n\nof law and motion for a new trial.              It did, however, strike the\n\npunitive damages award after reasoning that 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1981a(b)(1)\n\nlegally   precluded     a    plaintiff   like    Franchina    from    recovering\n\npunitive damages from a municipality like the City.                  Lastly, the\n\ndistrict judge denied the City's motion to amend the judgment by\n\nstriking the jury's front pay award. In doing so, the court stated\n\nthat it had independently determined, in its equitable discretion,\n\nthat front pay was an appropriate remedy and thus awarded the same\n\namount that the jury had previously determined was fair.                      An\n\namended judgment was then entered.\n\n            With this background in place, we now turn to the issues\n\npresented on appeal, highlighting additional facts when needed to\n\nput the claims into proper perspective.\n\n\n                                      - 20 -\n\f                                 Analysis\n\n           The City appeals from the denial of its motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law, making numerous arguments as to why\n\nthe decision in this case should not stand.          While the core issue\n\non appeal involves the merits of Franchina's sex-discrimination\n\nclaim, the City complains of other supposed reversible errors--\n\nsuch as timeliness concerns and evidentiary issues--that we will\n\nalso address.   We review the district court's denial of the motion\n\nfor judgment as a matter of law de novo.        Parker v. Gerrish, 547\n\nF.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2008).         In doing so, however, we do not\n\n\"evaluate the credibility of the witnesses or weigh the evidence.\"\n\nRodrÃ­guez-MarÃ­n v. Rivera-GonzÃ¡lez, 438 F.3d 72, 75 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).   We will reverse \"only if reasonable persons could not have\n\nreached the conclusion that the jury embraced.\"         Negron-Rivera v.\n\nRivera-Claudio, 204 F.3d 287, 290 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n                          A. Title VII: A Primer\n\n           We begin with a brief introduction to Title VII of the\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\"), 42 U.S.C. Â§ 2000e, et seq.,\n\nthe anti-discrimination statute upon which Franchina's claims are\n\nbased.   Under that statute, it is unlawful for an employer \"to\n\ndiscriminate    against    any   individual   with    respect   to   [her]\n\ncompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\" 42\n\nU.S.C. Â§ 2000eâ€“2(a)(1), or \"to limit, segregate, or classify [her]\n\nemployees . . . in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive\n\n\n                                  - 21 -\n\fany individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely\n\naffect [her] status as an employee,\" 42 U.S.C. Â§ 2000eâ€“2(a)(2),\n\nbased on a protected characteristic such as sex. The Supreme Court\n\nhas articulated that, pursuant to that language, plaintiffs may\n\nestablish a violation of Title VII by demonstrating that an\n\nemployer required them to work in a hostile or abusive environment.\n\nHarris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993) (explaining\n\nthat   \"[t]he       phrase    'terms,     conditions,   or    privileges     of\n\nemployment' evinces a congressional intent to strike at the entire\n\nspectrum of disparate treatment of men and women in employment,\n\nwhich includes requiring people to work in a discriminatorily\n\nhostile     or   abusive      environment\")    (internal     quotation   marks\n\nomitted).\n\n            Title VII's anti-retaliation provision separately tells\n\nus that it is unlawful \"for an employer to discriminate against\n\nany of his employees . . . because [the employee] has opposed any\n\npractice     made     an     unlawful     employment    practice    by     this\n\nsubchapter[.]\"        42     U.S.C.   Â§   2000e-3(a).   Because,    as   we've\n\nexplained, the term \"'oppose' . . . carries its ordinary meaning:\n\nto resist or antagonize . . .; to contend against; to confront;\n\nresist; withstand,\"        RodrÃ­guez-Vives v. P.R. Firefighters Corps of\n\nP.R., 743 F.3d 278, 284 (1st Cir. 2014) (quoting Crawford v. Metro.\n\nGov't of Nashville & Davidson Cnty., 555 U.S. 271, 276 (2009)), we\n\nhave interpreted the provision as casting a very broad \"protective\n\n\n                                      - 22 -\n\fcloak.\" See id. at 283-84. That is to say, not only is it unlawful\n\nto retaliate against an employee for initiating formal legal\n\nactions pursuant to Title VII, see, e.g., Marianiâ€“ColÃ³n v. Dep't\n\nof Homeland Sec. ex rel. Chertoff, 511 F.3d 216, 223 (1st Cir.\n\n2007) (complaining to human resource department and EEOC), but it\n\nis also unlawful for an employer to retaliate because an employee\n\nmerely complains to a supervisor about conduct constituting sex\n\ndiscrimination.          See, e.g., Tuli v. Brigham & Women's Hosp., 656\n\nF.3d       33,   41â€“43   (1st   Cir.   2011).9      Retaliation   to   informal\n\nopposition of a discriminatory employment activity is, in sum,\n\nsufficient to violate Title VII.\n\n                 Franchina brought two claims under Title VII, asserting\n\n(1) that she was subjected to a hostile work environment, and (2)\n\nthat she suffered retaliatory action for having reported sex-based\n\ndiscrimination to her superiors.                As we noted, she received a\n\nfavorable jury verdict on each of her claims in the district court.\n\nOn appeal, the City shines its spotlight solely on the hostile\n\nwork environment cause of action.               In light of the City's focus,\n\n\n\n\n       9\n       Other examples of unlawful retaliation courts have found\nunder Title VII include retaliation against an employee who\ninvoluntarily testified as a witness in a proceeding, see, e.g.,\nDeravin v. Kerik, 335 F.3d 195, 204 (2d Cir. 2003), as well as\nretaliation in response to an employee who aided a co-worker in\nasserting her rights. See e.g., Eichman v. Ind. State Univ. Bd.\nof Trs., 597 F.2d 1104, 1107 (7th Cir. 1979).\n\n\n                                       - 23 -\n\fwe linger not on the retaliation claim, giving our undivided\n\nattention instead to the issue with which the City takes umbrage.\n\n           To succeed on a hostile work environment claim, six\n\nelements must generally be established:\n\n     (1) that [the plaintiff] is a member of a protected\n     class; (2) that [she] was subjected to unwelcome sexual\n     harassment; (3) that the harassment was based upon sex;\n     (4) that the harassment was sufficiently severe or\n     pervasive so as to alter the conditions of [her]\n     employment and create an abusive work environment; (5)\n     that sexually objectionable conduct was both objectively\n     and subjectively offensive, such that a reasonable\n     person would find it hostile or abusive and that [s]he\n     in fact did perceive it to be so; and (6) that some basis\n     for employer liability has been demonstrated.\n\nPÃ©rez-Cordero v. Wal-Mart P.R., Inc., 656 F.3d 19, 27 (1st Cir.\n\n2011).10   This standard, which \"takes a middle path between making\n\nactionable any conduct that is merely offensive and requiring the\n\nconduct to cause a tangible psychological injury,\" Aponte-Rivera\n\nv. DHL Sols. (USA), Inc., 650 F.3d 803, 808 (1st Cir. 2011)\n\n(quoting   Harris,   510   U.S.   at   21   (1993)),   demands   that   we\n\n\"distinguish between the ordinary, if occasionally unpleasant,\n\nvicissitudes of the workplace and actual harassment.\"        Noviello v.\n\nCity of Boston, 398 F.3d 76, 92 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           And determining whether alleged instances of offensive\n\nconduct reach the requisite level of pervasiveness and/or severity\n\nto constitute actual harassment is by no means a black-and-white\n\n\n     10It is the third element in this standard that is the primary\ntarget of the City's appeal, which we will get into momentarily.\n\n\n                                  - 24 -\n\fdetermination.      Indeed, we have explained time and again that\n\n\"[t]here is no mathematically precise test that we employ to answer\n\nthis question.\"     Gerald v. Univ. of P.R., 707 F.3d 7, 18 (1st Cir.\n\n2013).    We look, instead, to numerous factors (to which we assign\n\nno particular determinative weight) in order to guide us in our\n\nresolution    of    these   difficult   situations:   severity   of     the\n\ndiscriminatory conduct, its frequency, the extent to which the\n\nbehavior is physically threatening or humiliating as opposed to a\n\nmere offensive utterance, and the extent to which it unreasonably\n\ninterferes with an employee's work performance.       Id.   Each hostile\n\nwork environment claim, then, is necessarily evaluated on a case-\n\nby-case basis.\n\n            Title VII also requires that the plaintiff file charges\n\nof discrimination within 180 days of the alleged act. 42 U.S.C.\n\nÂ§ 2000e-5(e)(1).      However, this period extends to 300 days where\n\nthe plaintiff has \"instituted proceedings with a State or local\n\nagency with authority to grant or seek relief from such practice.\"\n\nId.; see also VelÃ¡zquez-PÃ©rez v. Developers Diversified Realty\n\nCorp., 753 F.3d 265, 276 (1st Cir. 2014).\n\n            In fixing the applicable tolling time, we must keep in\n\nmind a key distinction the Supreme Court has articulated between\n\nthe tolling of (1) discrete incidents of discrimination and (2)\n\nhostile    work    environment   claims.     \"Discrete   acts    such    as\n\ntermination, failure to promote, denial of transfer, or refusal to\n\n\n                                  - 25 -\n\fhire are easy to identify,\"       Nat'l R.R. Passenger Grp. v. Morgan,\n\n536 U.S. 101, 114 (2002), and, consequently, those \"acts are not\n\nactionable if time barred, even when they are related to acts\n\nalleged in timely filed charges.\"           Campbell v. BankBoston, N.A.,\n\n327 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 2003) (citation omitted).               Hostile work\n\nenvironment claims, on the other hand, generally \"do not 'turn on\n\nsingle acts but on an aggregation of hostile acts extending over\n\na period of time.'\"       Marrero v.

Dep't of Educ., 250 F.3d 1,\n\n6 (1st Cir. 2001)).11       For this reason, an equitable exception to\n\nthe 300-day filing period is recognized under Title VII for the\n\n\"ongoing pattern[s] of discrimination,\" that are part and parcel\n\nwith    hostile   work    environment    claims.      O'Rourke    v.   City    of\n\nProvidence, 235 F.3d 713, 726 (1st Cir. 2001) (citations omitted);\n\nsee also Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp., 536 U.S. at 122.                         The\n\ncontinuing violation doctrine, in other words, allows plaintiffs\n\nto proceed on a hostile work environment claim \"so long as all\n\nacts which constitute the claim are part of the same unlawful\n\nemployment practice and at least one act falls within the time\n\nperiod.\"    Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp., 536 U.S. at 122 (emphasis\n\nadded).     Thus,    in    determining    liability    in   a    hostile   work\n\n\n       11\n       Of course, there are instances where a single incident can\nbe so severe that it alone satisfies the \"severe or pervasive\"\nprong of a hostile work environment claim. See Gerald, 707 F.3d\nat 18 (1st Cir. 2013).\n\n\n                                   - 26 -\n\fenvironment claim, all \"component acts\" of the claim that occurred\n\noutside of the limitations period may be considered.                   Tobin v.\n\nLiberty Mut. Ins. Co., 553 F.3d 121, 130 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n             With that legal landscape in mind, we address the City's\n\nvarious arguments, rejecting each one as we go along.\n\n                              B. Timeliness\n\n             The City's first arrow in its effort to lampoon the\n\ndistrict court proceedings is its claim that Franchina failed to\n\npresent evidence establishing an instance of harassment falling\n\nwithin the applicable statute of limitations under Title VII.                The\n\nCity contends that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law\n\non that issue and that the lower court erred in denying its motion.\n\nHaving reviewed the issue de novo, see Cigna Ins. Co. v. Oy\n\nSaunatec,    Ltd.,   241   F.3d   1,   8   (1st   Cir.   2001),   we   are   not\n\npersuaded.\n\n             Both parties agree that Franchina filed her charge of\n\ndiscrimination with the RICHR on November 30, 2011.                    As such,\n\nFranchina extended her statute of limitations beyond the typical\n\n180-day limit and we therefore look to whether Franchina filed\n\ncharges within 300 days of the alleged discrimination (i.e., on or\n\nafter February 3, 2011).      See VelÃ¡zquez-PÃ©rez, 753 F.3d at 276.\n\n             The relevant inquiry here is whether Franchina anchored\n\nher hostile work environment claim by proving that some instance\n\nof harassment happened on or after February 3, 2011.              See Nat'l R.\n\n\n                                   - 27 -\n\fR. Passenger Corp., 536 U.S. at 117 (where a plaintiff proves \"that\n\nan act contributing to the claim occurs within the filing period,\n\nthe entire time period of the hostile environment may be considered\n\nfor the purposes of determining liability\").         Here, Franchina\n\ntestified that she was subject to vulgar obscenities and harassment\n\non her weekly visits to the firehouse while she was out on\n\ndisability.    She explicitly testified that these visits continued\n\nfor a \"good portion\" of 2011.\n\n          The City argues that because Franchina did not testify\n\nwhen specifically in 2011 the harassment occurred, she did not\n\nmeet her burden of proving that some actionable conduct happened\n\non or after February 3, 2011. Franchina counters that a jury could\n\nreasonably infer that a \"good portion\" of 2011 meant that Franchina\n\nreturned for more than the first month of 2011 and therefore on or\n\nafter February 3, 2011.   We agree with Franchina.\n\n          We will reverse on appeal only if our review of the\n\nrecord reveals that the evidence required \"one conclusion, namely,\n\nthat the moving party was entitled to judgment.\" Travers v. Flight\n\nServs. & Sys., Inc., 808 F.3d 525, 531 (1st Cir. 2015) (quoting\n\nAstro-Med, Inc. v. Nihon Kohden Am., Inc., 591 F.3d 1, 13 (1st\n\nCir. 1999)).   Here, in order for the City to prevail, it must prove\n\nthat the only reasonable conclusion one could draw from the\n\nevidence is that Franchina stopped returning to the firehouse (and\n\ntherefore stopped experiencing harassment) before February 3,\n\n\n                                - 28 -\n\f2011.        We do not see the evidence in such stark a light.          Indeed,\n\nFranchina's testimony that she returned to the firehouse for a\n\n\"good portion\" of 2011 could certainly be understood to mean that\n\nshe returned past February 3, 2011 (and logic reasonably suggests\n\nthat the words \"good portion\" encompassed not merely the first\n\nthirty-three days of the year).                   Although we agree with the\n\ndistrict court judge that more would have been better, we find the\n\ntestimony presented to be at least minimally sufficient.                Viewing\n\nthe \"cold pages of the record\" leaves little room for second\n\nguessing the district court's finding, RodrÃ­quez v. Municipality\n\nof San Juan, 659 F.3d 168, 175 (1st Cir. 2011), and the City fails\n\nto provide us with a compelling reason to do so.\n\n                             C. Evidentiary Disputes\n\n                Moving on, the City contends here as it did below that\n\nthe district court erred in its admission of certain evidence,\n\nnamely the allowance of testimony pertaining to the Union Hall\n\nIncident        and   the   admission    of   a    transcript   from   McGarty's\n\npreliminary injunction hearing that resulted from that incident.12\n\nIn particular, the City argues first that all evidence of the Union\n\nHall Incident was admitted in error because it is irrelevant to\n\n\n\n        12\n        The briefs refer to the hearing as a \"TRO hearing,\" and\ncall the relevant transcript a \"TRO transcript,\" but that is\nincorrect. We take judicial notice that the hearing transcript in\nthe record is from the preliminary injunction proceeding.     See\nUnited States v. Bello, 194 F.3d 18, 22-24 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n\n                                        - 29 -\n\fworkplace harassment.       Second, it asserts that even if evidence of\n\nthe Union Hall Incident were relevant, the transcript of the\n\nrestraining order hearing was surely inadmissible hearsay. The\n\nadmission of both, the City continues, so tainted the fairness of\n\nthe trial by \"engender[ing] a verdict based on sympathy, passion,\n\nand emotion.\"   These arguments do not hit the mark.\n\n            We review a district court's admission of evidence for\n\nabuse of discretion,    Baker v. Goldman, Sachs & Co., 771 F.3d 37,\n\n57 (1st Cir. 2014), a standard which is necessarily deferential.\n\nShervin v. Partners Healthcare Sys. Inc., 804 F.3d 23, 44 (1st\n\nCir. 2015) (\"[O]nly rarely--and in extraordinarily compelling\n\ncircumstances--will we, from the vista of a cold appellate record,\n\nreverse a district court's\" evidentiary ruling.).              Even if a\n\nchallenger passes this high hurdle, we will not reverse so long as\n\n\"it is highly probable that the error did not affect the outcome\n\nof the case.\"   McDonough v. City of Quincy, 452 F.3d 8, 19-20 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).\n\n                      1. The Incident as a Whole\n\n            The City's first objection is to the admission of the\n\nevidence of the Union Hall Incident generally, which it lodges on\n\nrelevancy grounds.     Specifically, it contends that the incident\n\noccurred outside the workplace and is therefore irrelevant to\n\nFranchina's workplace harassment claim.        Franchina counters that\n\nincidents   outside   the    workplace   involving   her   colleagues   and\n\n\n                                  - 30 -\n\fsupervisors     are    relevant    to   establish      the   severity     and/or\n\npervasiveness of her hostile work environment claim.\n\n          Making a relevancy-based argument, as the City does, is\n\na rather tough sell.       For evidence to be relevant it \"need only\n\nmove the inquiry forward to some degree\" on a fact of consequence.\n\nBielunas v. F/V Misty Dawn, Inc., 621 F.3d 72, 76 (1st Cir. 2010)\n\n(citation omitted); see also Fed. R. Evid. 401 (relevant evidence\n\nhas \"any tendency to make a fact [that is of consequence] more or\n\nless probable\").       And relevancy is determined \"in light of the\n\nunderlying substantive law.\"        Bielunas, 621 F.3d at 76.           In cases\n\ndealing with Title VII, we have previously held that evidence of\n\nnon-workplace    conduct    is     admissible    \"to    help   determine     the\n\nseverity and pervasiveness of the hostility in the workplace.\"\n\nCrowley v. L.L. Bean, Inc., 303 F.3d 387, 409 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          The City nonetheless seems to argue, without citation,\n\nthat non-workplace conduct cannot be admitted as relevant unless\n\nthe incident is directly tied to consequences suffered by the\n\ncomplainant in the workplace.           It maintains that as a result of\n\nthe   Union     Hall    Incident     Franchina      suffered    no      material\n\nconsequences (i.e. reduction of pay, change in work schedule,\n\nstation relocation, or similar negative actions) at work and that,\n\nto the contrary, it was McGarty who was subject to work-based\n\nconsequences given that his assignments had to be drastically\n\nrestricted after the injunction issued.                We disagree with the\n\n\n                                    - 31 -\n\fCity's admissibility argument.         First, we have never mandated that\n\nevidence of non-workplace harassment have direct, formal workplace\n\nconsequences (such as those listed above) for it to be relevant.\n\nAnd even if such an explicit connection were required, which it is\n\nnot,    Franchina        testified    she     did     experience      workplace\n\nconsequences, in the form of removal from the firehouse, following\n\nthe Union Hall Incident.\n\n             Second--and not to belabor the point--we have explained\n\nthat non-workplace incidences are admissible if they cast light on\n\nthe motivations, pervasiveness, and/or severity of the harassment.\n\nSee Crowley, 303 F.3d at 409; see also O'Rourke, 235 F.3d at 724,\n\n727 (affirming a verdict in favor of a sexual harassment victim\n\nwho offered evidence of prank phone calls taking place outside the\n\nworkplace).    Both McCarty, the alleged harasser in the Union Hall\n\nIncident, and Lieutenant Jackson, one of the supervisors who failed\n\nto intervene, were players in Franchinaâ€™s workplace harassment\n\nclaim as each had been insubordinate in a previous rescue attempt\n\nepisode.     Just as testimony that a firefighter on duty refused to\n\ncook   for   her   or    made   Franchina   sick    helps   to   establish   the\n\npervasiveness      and    severity    of    the     hostility    in   her    work\n\nenvironment, so too does off-duty evidence demonstrating Franchina\n\nwas berated, spit at, and otherwise assaulted by a co-worker while\n\na supervising officer stood by. Therefore, the Union Hall Incident\n\nwas not isolated, non-work related conduct, but rather evidence\n\n\n                                     - 32 -\n\fsupporting the magnitude of the workplace harassment Franchina\n\nendured; a permissible means.            See Crowley, 303 F.3d at 409.\n\n              Because the City's relevancy argument cannot withstand\n\nour   scrutiny    we     turn    next    to   the    City's       challenge    to     the\n\ntranscript's admissibility specifically.\n\n         2. The Preliminary Injunction Hearing Transcript\n\n              As noted above, after the Union Hall Incident Franchina\n\nsought   and     then    received       injunctive      relief      against    McGarty\n\nfollowing a multi-witness hearing before the Rhode Island Superior\n\nCourt.   At Franchina's Title VII trial, the district court, over\n\nthe   City's     objection,        admitted      into    evidence      the     hearing\n\ntranscript from the superior court proceeding.                    The City contends\n\nthe   admission         was     erroneous     because       the     transcript        was\n\ninadmissible      hearsay.       Franchina    disagrees,          arguing    that    the\n\ntranscript was not admitted to prove what happened at the Union\n\nHall, but rather for the non-hearsay purpose of demonstrating (as\n\nthe   trial     court    explained      in    its    jury    instructions)          \"that\n\nmanagement-level employees of the City [ ] knew or should have\n\nknown of the harassment, and that those management-level employees\n\nfailed to implement prompt and appropriate remedial actions that\n\n[we]re reasonably calculated to stop the harassment and remedy the\n\nsituation.\"      We agree with Franchina.\n\n              Out-of-court statements are considered \"nonhearsay\" when\n\nthey are offered not for the truth of the matter but for some other\n\n\n                                        - 33 -\n\fpurpose.      United States v. Murphy, 193 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1999)\n\n(\"So long as out-of-court statements are not offered for their\n\ntruth,      they    are      not   hearsay.\").         The    transcript,        then,    was\n\nadmissible as non-hearsay if, as Franchina argues, it was offered\n\nfor the purpose of establishing that the City was, or should have\n\nbeen, on notice of Franchinaâ€™s alleged workplace harassment.                             See\n\nKelley v. Airborne Freight Corp., 140 F.3d 335, 346 (1st Cir. 1998)\n\n(hearsay rule does not bar out-of-court statement offered to prove\n\nnotice);     Tuli,      656    F.3d     at    41    (out-of-court       statements       were\n\npermissibly        introduced      as    non-hearsay          because    they     \"remained\n\nrelevant for purposes of showing notice to the [employer] and\n\ntoleration         of   a     general    climate       of     offensive        remarks    and\n\ndisplays\").        And the transcript did just that.\n\n              Here,         multiple    employees        of     the     Fire     Department\n\ntestified at the superior court hearing about the altercation\n\nbetween McGarty and Franchina.13                   Those who testified included not\n\njust    Franchina       and    McGarty,       but     also    two     higher-ups    in   the\n\n\n       13Lieutenant Murphy (who was testifying in support of\nMcGarty) noted on the record his awareness that during the Union\nHall Incident \"an argument ensued, a heated discussion amongst\n[Franchina and McGarty].\"        He also explained that while\nfirefighters generally \"settle[d] their differences\" in the Union\nHall (that is, they didn't bring their work problems home with\nthem and dealt with them amongst themselves), this incident was\nthe first time in his twenty-two years on the job that he could\nremember \"anything leaving the union hall.\" Lieutenant Jackson\n(who was also testifying in support of McGarty) similarly explained\nthat an argument between Franchina and McGarty had occurred, though\nhe was unable to hear what it was about.\n\n\n                                             - 34 -\n\fDepartment's leadership, Lieutenant Robert Jackson and Lieutenant\n\nElliot Murphy.14   Testimony from senior officers (i.e. those in\n\npositions of power) concerning what happened at the union hall,\n\nregardless of its truth, could be understood as lending credence\n\nto the inference that the Department should have been on notice of\n\nthe hostile work environment with which Franchina contended.   See\n\nForrest v. Brinker Int'l Payroll Co., LP, 511 F.3d 225, 231 (1st\n\nCir. 2007) (harassment open and known by management level employees\n\nevidenced that the employer knew of the harassment).     Moreover,\n\nthe transcript evidences a larger knowledge about the alleged\n\nharassment among the employees of the Department.     For example,\n\nLieutenant Murphy testified that he filed a report with the\n\nDepartment about the Union Hall Incident and that he knew of the\n\nprevious alleged incident of insubordination between Franchina,\n\nMcGarty, and Lieutenant Jackson.   And Lieutenant Jackson testified\n\nthat he had heard rumors that Franchina was filing a lawsuit\n\nagainst the Department related to his alleged insubordination\n\nduring a rescue. Such evidence of widespread knowledge among\n\nemployees can be probative of an employer's notice and, therefore,\n\n\n\n     14 Firefighter Michael Evora also testified about the fact\nthat he witnessed the argument, but was unable to determine what\nhad caused it and did not hear what they were arguing over. He\ndid note, however, that he noticed Franchina trying to ask for\nhelp from a senior officer during the incident.\n\n\n\n\n                              - 35 -\n\fwas properly admitted for this purpose.      Crowley, 303 F.3d at 402-\n\n03 (evidence that managers, team leaders, and superiors were aware\n\nof harassment evidenced that the employer knew or should have\n\nknown); White v. N.H. Dept. of Corr., 221 F.3d 254, 261 (1st Cir.\n\n2000) (Title VII requires proving that the supervisors \"knew or\n\nshould have known\" of the workplace harassment but \"failed to\n\nimplement prompt and appropriate corrective action\").15\n\n             The events following the preliminary injunction hearing\n\nfurther support the fact that leadership was on notice that the\n\nhearing occurred and about what had transpired at the hearing.\n\nIndeed, immediately following the superior court's grant of the\n\ninjunctive    relief,   Chief   Michael   Dillon,   Assistant   Chief   of\n\nOperations, issued an order barring McGarty from working any call-\n\n\n     15 In what appears to be part of its broader admissibility\nargument, the City seems to tell us that admission of the\ntranscript was unduly prejudicial and should have been excluded.\nWe've held that when statements \"potentially qualif[y] as both\nhearsay and nonhearsay, the district court may admit it if it is\nrelevant, and if the probative value of its intended nonhearsay\nuse is not substantially outweighed by the risk of the jury\nconsidering it for the truth of the matter asserted.\"        United\nStates v. ColÃ³n-DÃ­az, 521 F.3d 29, 33 (1st Cir. 2008); see also\nFed. R. Evid. 403.       Here, the City's contention that the\ntranscript's probative value is substantially outweighed by the\nprejudicial effect is made in conclusory terms and without citation\nor persuasive reasoning.    We see no reason to make the City's\nargument for it, and consider it waived. United States v. Zannino,\n895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"It is not enough merely to mention\na possible argument in the most skeletal way, leaving the court to\ndo counsel's work, create the ossature for the argument, and put\nflesh on its bones.\"). Additionally, we note that the City never\nasked the court to issue a limiting instruction to the jury\nregarding the extent to which the transcript could be considered.\n\n\n                                 - 36 -\n\fbacks with Franchina and Chief Scott Mello, a scheduler in the\n\nDepartment, testified about receiving and attempting to implement\n\nMello's order.              In light of all of this, we espy no abuse of\n\ndiscretion on the part of the district court.\n\n                 But, even if the district court erred by admitting\n\nevidence of either the Union Hall Incident or the preliminary\n\ninjunction hearing transcript or both (and by no means do we\n\nsuggest it did), any such error would necessarily be harmless.\n\nThere was a plethora of other, independent evidence introduced at\n\ntrial that more than supports the verdict that Franchina was\n\ndiscriminated against on the basis of her gender.                Indeed, in our\n\nnext section below we outline that evidence in further detail.\n\n                   D. Sufficiency of the Evidence: Title VII\n\n                 The City next maintains that it was entitled to judgment\n\nas   a        matter   of   law   on   Franchina's   hostile   work   environment\n\ndiscrimination claim because she failed, in its opinion, to present\n\nsufficient evidence under a sex-plus theory of discrimination as\n\nrequired by our Title VII jurisprudence.16              Our de novo review \"is\n\n\n\n\n         16\n        We note here that Franchina argues that the City lacks\nstanding to appeal the hostile work environment discrimination\nclaim. Specifically, she points out that the jury awarded lump\nsum damages on both her hostile work environment and retaliation\nclaims, but the City did not appeal the retaliation claim. So the\nargument goes, the City never objected to damages being awarded in\na lump sum and so even if they prevail on their appeal with respect\nto the discrimination claim, lump sum damages are joint and several\nand therefore fully attributable to the retaliation claim which is\n\n\n                                         - 37 -\n\fweighted toward preservation of the jury verdict; 'we must affirm\n\nunless   the   evidence   was   so     strongly   and   overwhelmingly\n\ninconsistent with the verdict[] that no reasonable jury could have\n\nreturned [it].'\"   Rodowicz v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co., 279 F.3d\n\n36, 41-42 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting Walton v. Nalco Chem. Co., 272\n\nF.3d 13, 23 (1st Cir. 2001)).        For the reasons that follow, we\n\nconclude the City's charge overshoots its target.\n\n 1.   What's Required to Prove a Sex-Plus Claim under Title VII?\n\n          Before delving into the heart of the City's argument, we\n\nbriefly pause to shed some light on what we perceive to be a\n\nmisapprehension by the City over what is required to prove a\n\nhostile work environment claim when a plaintiff (like Franchina)\n\npremises her claim on a \"sex-plus theory.\"        In short, \"sex-plus\n\nclaims\" are a flavor of gender discrimination claims where \"an\n\nemployer classifies employees on the basis of sex plus another\n\n\n\n\nnot up for appeal. Franchina thus maintains that there is no live\ncase and controversy and the discrimination claim is moot.\n     But the City's notice of appeal was all encompassing.      It\nspecifically stated that it was appealing \"all adverse orders and\nrulings made by the District Court in this action,\" including \"all\njudgments and amended judgments.\"    Thus, at the very least, it\ncertainly had standing to challenge the retaliation claim. While\nit is true that the City provided no argumentation on the merits\nof the retaliation claim, we will assume (favorably to the City)\nthat the argument was not waived. See De JesÃºs v. LTT Card Servs.,\nInc., 474 F.3d 16, 20 n.6 (1st Cir. 2007). That said, we see no\nneed to delve deep into the retaliation issue. Indeed, much of\nthe same evidence that supports the discrimination claim alleged\nby Franchina similarly supports her retaliation cause of action.\n\n\n                                - 38 -\n\fcharacteristic.\"         Chadwick v. WellPoint, Inc., 561 F.3d 38, 43\n\n(1st Cir. 2009) (quoting 1 Barbara Lindemann & Paul Grossman,\n\nEmployment Discrimination Law 456 (3d ed. 1996) (emphasis in\n\noriginal)).      The City contends, as best we can tell, that for a\n\nplaintiff to be successful under a sex-plus theory, a separate,\n\nmore   stringent      evidentiary      standard     exists    than    for    straight\n\nclaims of sex discrimination.            The City, it seems, believes that\n\nunder a sex-plus theory, plaintiffs are required to identify a\n\ncorresponding sub-class of the opposite gender and show that the\n\ncorresponding class was not subject to similar harassment or\n\ndiscrimination.       Thus, for Franchina to succeed, the City tells us\n\nshe    is   required     to    have    presented    evidence     at   trial        of   a\n\ncomparative      class    of     gay    male     firefighters     who       were    not\n\ndiscriminated against.          Without such a showing, the City contends,\n\nit would not be possible to prove that any sort of differential\n\ntreatment a plaintiff experiences is necessarily predicated on his\n\nor her gender.\n\n              This approach--one that we have never endorsed--has some\n\nrather      obvious   flaws.      Indeed,      at   oral     argument,      the    City\n\nrecognized one of them in its concession that such a standard would\n\npermit employers to discriminate free from Title VII recourse so\n\nlong as they do not employ any subclass member of the opposite\n\ngender.      But, of course, that cannot be.           Under such an approach,\n\nfor example, discrimination against women with children would be\n\n\n                                        - 39 -\n\funactionable as long as the employer employed no fathers.              But see\n\nChadwick, 561 F.3d at 41.17       The result that would follow from the\n\nCity's approach would, thus, be inapposite to Title VII's mandate\n\nagainst sex-based discrimination.\n\n             Indeed,   at   the   advent    of    sex-plus   claims,   courts\n\nrecognized that \"[t]he effect of [Title VII] is not to be diluted\n\nbecause discrimination adversely affects only a portion of the\n\nprotected class.\"      Sprogis v. United Air Lines, Inc., 444 F.2d\n\n1194, 1198 (7th Cir. 1971), cert denied, 404 U.S. 991 (1971); see\n\nalso Chadwick, 561 F.3d at 42 n.4 (explaining that \"discrimination\n\nagainst      one   employee       cannot     be     remedied    solely     by\n\nnondiscrimination against another employee in that same group\").\n\nSimilarly, the effect of Title VII is not to be diluted because\n\ndiscrimination adversely affects a plaintiff who is unlucky enough\n\nto lack a comparator in his or her workplace.\n\n             The City's position conflicts also with Title VII's text\n\nand jurisprudence.     Requiring a plaintiff to point to a comparator\n\nof the opposite gender implies the inquiry is that of \"but-for\"\n\ncausation.    That is to say, the City's approach requires Franchina\n\nto make a showing that, all else being equal (the \"plus\" factors\n\n\n     17 Sexual harassment against black women would also be\nunactionable as sex discrimination as long as the employer employed\nno black men.    But see Jefferies v. Harris Cnty. Cmty. Action\nAss'n, 615 F.2d 1025, 1034 (5th Cir. 1980) (\"It is clear from the\nforegoing cases that an employer may not single out black women\nfor discriminatory treatment.\").\n\n\n                                   - 40 -\n\fbeing the same), the discrimination would not have occurred but\n\nfor her gender.        Title VII requires no such proof.              The text bars\n\ndiscrimination        when   sex    is    \"a    motivating   factor,\"      not   \"the\n\nmotivating     factor.\"       42    U.S.C.      Â§   2000e-2(m)    (\"[A]n   unlawful\n\nemployment practice is established when the complaining party\n\ndemonstrates that . . . sex . . . was a motivating factor for any\n\nemployment practice, even though other factors also motivated the\n\npractice.\").       And, moreover, the Supreme Court has explicitly\n\nrejected the \"but for\" standard.               See Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins,\n\n490 U.S. 228, 240 (1989) (\"To construe the words 'because of' as\n\ncolloquial      shorthand     for    'but-for       causation'    .    .   .   is   to\n\nmisunderstand them.\").\n\n              In sum, the City advocates a standard for sex-plus claims\n\nthat requires plaintiffs to allege more than what is required for\n\ntraditional sex discrimination claims.               But we have held that sex-\n\nplus \"does not mean that more than simple sex discrimination must\n\nbe alleged.\"     Chadwick, 561 F.3d at 43.            Chadwick, in other words,\n\nmade clear that the sex-plus label is no more than a \"heuristic .\n\n. . , a judicial convenience developed in the context of Title VII\n\nto   affirm    that    plaintiffs        can,   under   certain       circumstances,\n\nsurvive summary judgment [and obtain a favorable verdict at trial]\n\neven when not all members of a disfavored class are discriminated\n\nagainst.\"      Back v. Hastings On Hudson Union Free Sch. Dist., 365\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 41 -\n\fF.3d 107, 118 (2d Cir. 2004).               With these principles in mind we\n\nmove on to the City's sufficiency of the evidence challenge.\n\n 2.   Was there Sufficient Evidence to Support Franchina's Claim?\n\n              At core, the City believes that Franchina has presented\n\nno    evidence      to     support   her    claim      that   the   harassment        she\n\nexperienced was a result, at least in part, of her gender.18\n\nRather, it contends Franchina inappropriately blurred the line\n\nbetween sex and sexual orientation discrimination under Title VII.\n\nAccording      to    the    City,    even   though,     arguendo,    she   may    have\n\npresented evidence demonstrating discrimination as a result of the\n\nlatter      (her    sexual    orientation),      she    presented    little      to   no\n\nevidence of the former (her gender).                And such sexual orientation\n\nbigotry, the argument goes, does not enjoy Title VII protection\n\nunder Higgins v. New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc., a nearly twenty-\n\nyear-old case in which we concluded that Title VII does not\n\nproscribe harassment based solely on one's sexual orientation.\n\n194 F.3d 252, 258-59 (1st Cir. 1999).19                  While that may be true,\n\n\n       18\n       In its brief, the City's argument here is primarily premised\non Franchina's failure to present evidence showing that a\ncomparator class (of gay male firefighters) was not subject to the\nsame discriminatory actions alleged by Franchina. For the reasons\ndiscussed at length above, however, that argument cannot stand.\n       19\n       Though the tide may be turning when it comes to Title VII's\nprotections, see Hively v. Ivy Tech Community College of Ind., 853\nF.3d 339, 341 (7th Cir. 2017) (holding en banc that discrimination\non the basis of sexual orientation is a form of sex\ndiscrimination), it is not our job here to posit whether Higgins\nshould be reexamined.     Though Franchina originally brought a\nseparate claim alleging sexual-orientation discrimination under\n\n\n                                        - 42 -\n\fwe do not believe that Higgins forecloses a plaintiff in our\n\nCircuit from bringing sex-plus claims under Title VII where, in\n\naddition   to   the   sex-based   charge,   the   \"plus\"   factor   is   the\n\nplaintiff's status as a gay or lesbian individual. Indeed, Higgins\n\nexpressly disclaimed reaching a conclusion on that issue.           See 194\n\nF.3d at 260 (explaining that while appellant made a sex-plus\n\nargument on appeal, that claim \"never surfaced in the district\n\ncourt\" and, therefore, the court would not reach that issue on the\n\nmerits).   In sex-plus claims brought under Title VII \"the simple\n\nquestion posed . . . is whether the employer took an adverse\n\nemployment action at least in part because of an employee's sex.\"\n\nChadwick, 561 F.3d at 43 (emphasis in original).            And we see no\n\nreason why claims where the \"plus-factor\" is sexual orientation\n\nwould not be viable if the gay or lesbian plaintiff asserting the\n\nclaim also demonstrates that he or she was discriminated at least\n\nin part because of his or her gender.\n\n           Here, Franchina presented a plethora of evidence showing\n\nthat the impetus for the discrimination she sustained was based in\n\npart on her being a female.           In gender discrimination cases\n\npremised on a hostile work environment, Title VII permits a\n\nplaintiff to prove unlawful discrimination by demonstrating that\n\n\n\nTitle VII, the district court dismissed that count at the motion\nto dismiss stage of this case.     Franchina did not appeal that\ndecision and so it is not before us.\n\n\n                                  - 43 -\n\fthe \"workplace is permeated with 'discriminatory intimidation,\n\nridicule, and insult' that is 'sufficiently severe or pervasive to\n\nalter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an\n\nabusive working environment.'\"          Harris, 510 U.S. at 21 (citations\n\nomitted).     \"Evidence of sexual remarks, innuendos, ridicule, and\n\nintimidation may be sufficient to support a jury verdict for a\n\nhostile work environment.\" O'Rourke, 235 F.3d at 729. Here, there\n\nwas repeated evidence that Franchina was called a \"bitch,\" \"cunt,\"\n\nand \"Frangina.\"       The use of these words is inherently \"gender-\n\nspecific\"    and    their   \"repeated   and   hostile    use   .   .   .    .   can\n\nreasonably     be    considered    evidence     of    sexual       harassment.\"\n\nPassananti v. Cook Cnty., 689 F.3d 655, 666 (7th Cir. 2012).                     In\n\nfact a \"raft of case law . . . establishes that the use of sexually\n\ndegrading,    gender-specific     epithets,    such     as   'slut,'       'cunt,'\n\n'whore,' and 'bitch' . . . , has been consistently held to\n\nconstitute harassment based upon sex.\"          Forrest, 511 F.3d at 229;\n\nsee also State of Conn. v. Baccala, 163 A.3d 1, 13 (Conn. 2017)\n\n(explaining that \"fat ugly bitch\" and \"cunt\" are \"one or more of\n\nthe most vulgar terms known in our lexicon to refer to [the female]\n\ngender\").    This case is no different.        In fact, there was more.\n\n             There was also evidence that women were treated as less\n\ncompetent; a treatment barred by Title VII.             Oncale v. Sundowner\n\nOffshore Servs. Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 80 (1998) (\"The critical issue,\n\nTitle VII's text indicates, is whether members of one sex are\n\n\n                                   - 44 -\n\fexposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to\n\nwhich members of the other sex are not exposed.\") (quotation marks\n\nomitted).     There was evidence that men treated women better when\n\nthey were perceived as willing to have sex with them.              There was\n\nevidence    that   Franchina   was    subjected    to    humiliating     sexual\n\nremarks and innuendos by Ferro, including asking the plaintiff if\n\nshe wanted to have babies and if he could help her conceive.               This\n\ntype of sexually based animus is a hallmark of Title VII.                  Id.\n\n(noting that \"the inference of discrimination [is] easy to draw .\n\n. . [when] the challenged conduct typically involves explicit or\n\nimplicit proposals of sexual activity\"); Marrero, 304 F.3d at 19\n\n(observing     that    repeated     \"humiliating     sexual    remarks     and\n\ninnuendos\" are actionable under Title VII).\n\n             In sum, the jury heard evidence of repeated hostile,\n\ngender-based epithets, ill treatment of women as workers, sexual\n\ninnuendoes, and preferential treatment for women who were more\n\nlikely to sleep with the men of the Department.            This sampling of\n\nevidence demonstrates that the \"accumulated effect . . . taken\n\ntogether\" constitutes a hostile work environment.              O'Rourke, 235\n\nF.3d at 729.\n\n3. Did the Judge Accurately Convey to the Jury What was Required\n                        Under Title VII?\n\n             Lastly,   the   City    quibbles     over   the   judge's    jury\n\ninstructions--specifically as to how he conveyed to the jury what\n\n\n\n                                    - 45 -\n\felements were required in order to prove a sex-plus claim under\n\nTitle VII. We review preserved claims of instructional error under\n\na split standard.        Questions as to whether jury instructions\n\ncapture the essence of the applicable law are reviewed de novo,\n\nwhile questions as to whether the court's choice of phraseology in\n\ncrafting    its   jury   instructions   is    unfairly   prejudicial    are\n\nreviewed for abuse of discretion.          DeCaro v. Hasbro, Inc., 580\n\nF.3d 55, 61 (1st Cir. 2009).      Because the question here is whether\n\nthe applicable law was adequately conveyed, our review is de novo.\n\nThe supposedly problematic instruction reads as follows:\n\n     Element three requires that harassment must be based on\n     gender.   The plaintiff need not prove that all women\n     were discriminated against or were harassed, but she\n     must prove that she was harassed at least in part because\n     she is a woman.\n     In other words, she may meet this element by proving\n     that she was harassed because she is part of a subclass\n     of women, in this case lesbians, if she also proves that\n     this harassment was at least in part because of her sex\n     or gender.\n            The City argues that this instruction is inconsistent\n\nwith the law, and states that the following sentence should have\n\nbeen added in order for the instruction to be legally sufficient:\n\n\"If you find that Ms. Franchina faced harassment solely because of\n\nher sexual orientation, then she has not proven that she faced\n\nharassment because of her gender.\"\n\n            Where \"a party assigns error to the failure to give a\n\nrequested   instruction,    the   threshold    inquiry   is   whether   the\n\n\n\n                                  - 46 -\n\frequested instruction was correct as a matter of law.\"            Shervin,\n\n804 F.3d at 47.      If that threshold is met, the challenger must\n\nmake two subsequent showings: first that the proposed instruction\n\nis \"not substantially incorporated into the charge as rendered\"\n\nand second that it is \"integral to an important point in the case.\"\n\nWhite, 221 F.3d at 263 (quoting United States v. DeStefano, 59\n\nF.3d 1, 2 (1995)).\n\n           While the City's requested jury instruction is, in fact,\n\nlegally correct (thus passing the threshold question), we fail to\n\nsee what supposed deficiency in the instructions the judge actually\n\ngave to the jury would be cured by the City's requested insert.\n\nWe have made clear that the inquiry in sex-plus claims is whether\n\nthe   harassment   was   caused   \"at   least   in   part   because   of   an\n\nemployee's sex,\" Chadwick, 561 F.3d at 43 (emphasis in original),\n\nwhich is exactly what the district court instructed.          As such, the\n\ninstruction was \"in substance, legally correct,\" Shervin, 804 F.3d\n\nat 47, and the City's requested instruction would have been mere\n\nsuperfluity.   Failure to include superfluous language is not an\n\nerror.   Having addressed each of the Cityâ€™s Title VII disputes, we\n\nmove on.\n\n                              E. Front Pay\n\n           Even if we decline to invalidate the entire jury verdict-\n\n-which, for the reasons discussed at length above, we just have--\n\nthe City argues that at the very least we must still strike the\n\n\n                                  - 47 -\n\fjudge's award of front pay to Franchina.      That is so, the City\n\ncontends, because the district court erred post-trial when it\n\nfailed to grant the City's motion to alter or amend the judgment\n\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).      The City's argument on this\n\npoint is three-fold.    First, the City contends that there was no\n\ncompetent evidence to support any award of front pay damages.\n\nSecond, the City argues that the judge erred in failing to instruct\n\nthe jury that any front pay award needed to be reduced to present\n\nvalue.    And third, the City takes issue with Franchina's failure\n\nto present expert testimony which it says was necessary to support\n\na front pay claim.20\n\n           We review a district court's ruling on a Rule 59(e)\n\nmotion for abuse of discretion.    Guadalupe-BÃ¡ez v. Pesquera, 819\n\nF.3d 509, 518 (1st Cir. 2016).    In doing so, we keep in mind that\n\n\"[s]uch a motion must either establish a clear error of law or\n\npoint to newly discovered evidence of sufficient consequence to\n\nmake a difference.\"    Id.\n\n\n     20While numerous other Circuits have explicitly stated front\npay determinations are only to be made by a judge and should never\ngo to a jury, see, e.g., Duke v. Uniroyal Inc., 928 F.2d 1413,\n1424 (4th Cir. 1991); Fortino v. Quasar Co., A Div. of Matsushita\nElec. Corp. of Am., 950 F.2d 389, 398 (7th Cir. 1991); Newhouse v.\nMcCormick & Co., Inc., 110 F.3d 635, 643 (8th Cir. 1997), and\nthough we have previously noted that there may be some question\nconcerning the propriety of a jury making front pay calculations\nin our Circuit, see Johnson v. Spencer Press of Me., Inc., 364\nF.3d 368, 380 n.8 (1st Cir. 2004) (citing Lindemann & Grossman,\nEmployment Discrimination Law 640â€“41 (Cane, Jr. et al. eds., 3d\ned. 1996)), this issue is not before us today.\n\n\n                               - 48 -\n\f            \"[F]ront   pay,    within      the   employment       discrimination\n\nuniverse, is generally equitable in nature.

These purposes, our\n\njudicial superiors tell us, include \"eradicating discrimination\n\nthroughout the economy and making persons whole for injuries\n\nsuffered through past discrimination.\"            Id. at 421.      Further, our\n\nprecedent   makes   plain     that   we    are   \"flexible    .    .   .   in   the\n\nconstruction of remedial awards,\" Selgas v. Am. Airlines, Inc.,\n\n104 F.3d 9, 13 (1st Cir. 1997), and, therefore, we generally give\n\ndistrict courts significant latitude in awarding front pay.                     See\n\nLussier, 50 F.3d at 1110 (explaining that \"[b]ecause the hallmarks\n\nof equity have long been flexibility and particularity . . . . a\n\nrule that confers latitude upon the district court to handle the\n\ninterface between [an issue related to] front pay differently in\n\ndifferent cases is fully consistent with this storied heritage\").\n\nThis flexibility also derives in large part from the inherently\n\nimprecise nature of the award.            See Johnson v.

Circuits).\n\nFinally, we note that \"when future payment or other pecuniary\n\nbenefits are to be anticipated, the [award] should be made up on\n\nthe basis of their present value only.\"           St. Louis Sw. Ry. Co. v.\n\nDickerson, 470 U.S. 409, 411 (1985).           And failure to instruct the\n\njury to reduce an award of future payment to present day value\n\nordinarily requires a new trial.             See Conway v. Electro Switch\n\nCorp., 825 F.2d 593, 603 n.5 (1st Cir. 1987) (\"We note, as a final\n\nmatter, that the jury was not instructed to reduce its award of\n\nfront pay to present value, thus . . . the district court must\n\norder a new trial on the front pay question.\").\n\n                        1. Exploring the Arguments\n\n             Because the City's second argument does not cause us to\n\ntarry, we begin there.          The City contends that the judge's front\n\npay   jury   instruction   constituted       reversible   error    because   it\n\nfailed to instruct the jury that any award needed to be reduced to\n\npresent day value.      Given our clear case law, ordinarily we would\n\nagree.21     However, we ask the reader to recall that, although the\n\n\n      21\n       Had the district court not made an independent award, our\nstandard of review would be de novo rather than abuse of\n\n\n                                    - 51 -\n\fdistrict court did initially submit the front pay issue to the\n\njury, it went a step further and exercised its equitable discretion\n\nto independently (and alternatively) award Franchina front pay\n\n(and at the same time clearly stated the award had been reduced to\n\npresent day value).   And the City is in agreement that a judge may\n\nfashion a front pay award--at the charge conference, the City's\n\ncounsel argued that the front pay question should not be given to\n\nthe jury because \"front pay is an equitable matter to be determined\n\nby the Court.\"   Therefore, because the City makes no challenge to\n\nthe district judge's ability to make front pay determinations, we\n\nmove on to discuss the City's more substantive attacks, the essence\n\nof both being the City's contention that \"[Franchina] presented\n\nvirtually zero evidence upon which a jury or the Court could\n\nfashion an appropriate award on front pay.\"\n\n          The City challenges the sufficiency of Franchina's front\n\npay award claiming she failed to meet her burden of presenting the\n\n\"essential data\" needed to calculate such an award.   Relying on a\n\nD.C. Circuit case, the City tells us \"essential data\" constitutes\n\n\"the amount of the proposed award, the length of time the plaintiff\n\nexpects to work for the defendant, and the applicable discount\n\n\n\n\ndiscretion. See DeCaro v. Hasbro, Inc., 580 F.3d 55, 61 (1st Cir.\n2009) (explaining that we review de novo questions as to whether\njury instructions capture the essence of the applicable law).\n\n\n                              - 52 -\n\frate.\" See Barbour v. Merrill, 48 F.3d 1270, 1279 (D.C. Cir. 1995)\n\n(citation omitted).\n\n             We agree that Franchina bore the burden of proving her\n\nentitlement to front pay in the amount awarded.                We disagree,\n\nthough, that she failed to produce any evidence in support of the\n\ndistrict court's determination. In deciding on a request for front\n\npay, a district court can consider an array of issues.                A non-\n\nexhaustive list includes the following: Is the plaintiff able and\n\nallowed to return to work with the employer? What pay and benefits\n\nwas she receiving?     What other work can and will she likely obtain\n\nto offset the loss?      What pay increases might she have obtained\n\nhad she remained employed?        For how long would she have worked?\n\nWhat will be the effects of inflation?            What will be the rate of\n\nreturn on any award?\n\n             Franchina's evidence covered most but not all of these\n\nfactors (for instance she did not propose a discount rate).               In\n\nterms   of    the   evidence    she     did    present,   though,   Franchina\n\ndemonstrated the following:             She had been earning $98,000 to\n\n$130,000 per year while employed with the Department; she is\n\npermanently disabled from continuing a career as a first responder\n\nin the Department; and she is receiving $25,000 per year in\n\ndisability benefits.     There was also testimony that she possessed\n\nexcellent    professional      skills    and    leadership   qualities,   and\n\nalthough she started in the Department as an entry-level Rescue\n\n\n                                      - 53 -\n\fTechnician, she quickly moved through the ranks and reached the\n\nlevel of Rescue Lieutenant (a leadership position).                Furthermore,\n\nFranchina had worked for ten years in the Department, yet was only\n\n44 years old at the time she left her job.                  The Department's\n\npension structure also encouraged Department employees to maintain\n\nemployment for great lengths of time.               Indeed, future benefits\n\nwere linked with longevity of service.              And she put on evidence\n\nthat numerous other employees spent upwards of 30-35 years with\n\nthe Department.\n\n           Given all of this, the crucial factor in estimating\n\nfuture   lost   wages    was    the   number   of   years   that    her   annual\n\nunadjusted loss of $73,000 to $105,000 would have continued.\n\nTwenty years would have generated a figure of $1.4 million to $2\n\nmillion.   Adding in for inflation and lost pension would have\n\nbumped this number up.         Reducing to present value may have reduced\n\nit as much, or perhaps more.          On this record, we see no reason to\n\nconclude that the record's omission of a discount rate rendered an\n\naward of $545,000 improper as a matter of law, at least where the\n\nadjudicator is a trial judge likely well familiar with the concept\n\nof present value.       Clearly the judge assumed that the future was\n\nuncertain, and an award for over $1 million unwarranted. Its ample\n\ndiscretion to discount for uncertainty dwarfed as a practical\n\nmatter any loss of precision in discounting for a reasonable rate\n\nof return where the likely duration was perhaps five years.\n\n\n                                      - 54 -\n\fCertainly the court could have awarded much less.   But its failure\n\nto insist that Franchina provide it with more precise information\n\nprovides no reason to set aside the award.\n\n            Nonetheless, the City posits that even if we conclude\n\nFranchina presented significant (and relevant) evidence going to\n\n\"essential data\" for crafting a front pay award, it says her damage\n\nclaim is still doomed because she failed to produce an expert\n\nwitness who could provide the fact finder with a proper methodology\n\nfor reducing any award to present day value.22\n\n            The City's primary contention is that it is \"standard\n\npractice\" for plaintiffs in employment discrimination suits to\n\npresent expert testimony on future earnings.        Based on this\n\nsupposed norm, the City tells us that it thus follows that expert\n\ntestimony must always be a requirement for calculating front pay.\n\nTo support its argument, the City directs us to Virgo v. Riviera\n\nBeach Assoc., Ltd., 30 F.3d 1350 (11th Cir. 1994), and Lussier, 50\n\nF.3d 1103, two cases where expert testimony was, in fact, presented\n\nat trial.   But those cases do not assist the City because neither\n\n\n     22 And even though the district court, in making its\nindependent front pay determination, expressly indicated that it\nhad discounted the award to present day value, the City argues\nthere is no indication it actually did so. Rather, as the City\naccuses, the district court \"did not make its own determination,\nequitable or otherwise . . .     but merely accepted the jury's\n[unsupported] front pay award.\" Given the considerable discretion\nafforded the district court in fashioning an equitable remedy, we\nhave no reason to believe the court didn't do what it said it had\ndone.\n\n\n                              - 55 -\n\fVirgo nor Lussier tackled the issue we are confronted with here--\n\nwhether expert testimony is a precondition for the calculation of\n\nany front pay award.\n\n          The City points to no First Circuit case in which we\n\nreached the conclusion the City now advocates for (and we have\n\nfound none in our independent search).23   However, several of our\n\nsister circuits have had occasion to opine on this issue.     None\n\nhave concluded that expert testimony on reduction to present day\n\nvalue is a mandatory prerequisite for an award of future earnings.\n\nSee Maxfield v. Sinclair Int'l, 766 F.2d 788, 797 (3d Cir. 1985)\n\n(\"Nor do we believe that expert testimony was needed to reduce the\n\ndamage award to present value.\"); Bonura v. Sea Land Serv., Inc.,\n\n505 F.2d 665, 668â€“69 (5th Cir. 1974) (explaining that actuarial\n\nand mathematical evidence are not prerequisites for recovery of\n\nlost future wages); Pa. R.R. Co. v. McKinley, 288 F.2d 262, 265\n\n(6th Cir. 1961); Heater v. Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co., 497 F.2d\n\n1243, 1250 (7th Cir. 1974); Duncan v. St. Louis-San Francisco Ry.\n\nCo., 480 F.2d 79, 87 (8th Cir. 1973); Cassino v. Reichhold Chems.,\n\nInc., 817 F.2d 1338, 1348 (9th Cir. 1987).\n\n          Moreover, we have at least once before implied that no\n\nexpert testimony is needed in situations like this.   In McDonald\n\nv. Federal Laboratories, Inc., 724 F.2d 243 (1st Cir. 1984), we\n\n\n     23The City also fails to point us to a single case from any\nof our sister circuits reaching such a conclusion.\n\n\n                             - 56 -\n\fupheld a district court's jury instruction that failed \"to specify\n\na particular present value discount rate [and] fail[ed] to set\n\nforth a formula for the jury to reduce to present value any damages\n\nawarded for future diminution of earning capacity.\"               Id. at 247.\n\nInstead, the district court there merely instructed the jury to\n\nreduce the award to present value, using a \"reasonable rate of\n\ninterest.\"    Id.      We   recognized    that    this   rather    simplistic\n\ninstruction was the result of the \"the parties' own failure to\n\nprovide probative evidence of an appropriate discount rate,\" but\n\nnevertheless, we found no error in the court's instruction.               Id.\n\n(emphasis added).      To accept the City's argument that Franchina's\n\nfuture earnings damages should be thrown out for lack of expert\n\ntestimony would be odd in light of our upholding of the front pay\n\naward in McDonald (where we specifically acknowledged the lack of\n\nprobative evidence on discount rate and left the factfinder to its\n\nown devices in properly discounting for present value).              See id.\n\n             Additionally, we have found that at least some district\n\ncourts in our Circuit have assumed this rule for years.                   See\n\nMcKeown v. Woods Hole, 9 F. Supp. 2d 32, 48 n.16 (D. Mass. 1998)\n\n(explaining that \"[t]he majority of courts also do not require\n\nevidence,    whether   by   expert    testimony   and/or   annuity    tables,\n\nsuggesting to the jury a method to reduce future loss of earnings\n\nto its present value\"); Worden v. Consol. Rail Corp., 689 F. Supp.\n\n35, 37â€“38 (D. Mass. 1988) (\"[P]laintiff's failure to come forth\n\n\n                                     - 57 -\n\fwith expert or other evidence regarding methods of present value\n\ncomputation is not fatal.\").\n\n            And we note that over fifty years ago the Sixth Circuit\n\nexplicated in Pennsylvania R. Co. v. McKinley, 288 F.2d at 265,\n\nthat \"[j]urors are presumed to be intelligent people, generally\n\naware, from today's economy and their own experience with it, of\n\nthe earning value of money when placed in safe investments.\"    In\n\nother words, because the effect of inflation and interest rates on\n\nthe value of money is otherwise self-evident (and assumed to be\n\ncommon knowledge), \"a jury, unaided by specific testimony as to\n\nmoney values, could themselves, being told that the award should\n\nbe only money value, properly apply the applicable rule.\"      Id.\n\nThis logic applies with even greater force to judges given, as we\n\nmentioned earlier, that they are routinely called upon to make\n\nfront pay calculations and are presumed to be more knowledgeable\n\nabout necessary reductions to present day value and how to make\n\nthem.     See Monessen Sw. Ry. Co. v. Morgan, 486 U.S. 330, 341-42\n\n(1988).\n\n            Given all of this, we decline to adopt an absolute rule\n\nmandating the presentation of expert testimony in every instance\n\nin determining future pay.   Moreover, based upon our review of the\n\nentire record, we find no evidentiary insufficiency and no abuse\n\n\n\n\n                               - 58 -\n\fof discretion in the district court's front pay call.24    We thus\n\nleave Franchina's award of damages undisturbed.25\n\n                            Conclusion\n\n          The abuse Lori Franchina suffered at the hands of the\n\nProvidence Fire Department is nothing short of abhorrent and, as\n\n\n     24The City suggests that because Franchina's proposed witness\nlist did not designate an expert to calculate the discount rate,\nit assumed she was not seeking a front pay award. Had it known\nshe was, in fact, asking for future earnings, it might have\nretained an expert of its own on this topic.          While it is\nunfortunate that the City made this dubious assumption, it in no\nway impacts our outcome here. In the complaint, Franchina clearly\nstated in her Title VII claim against the City that she \"suffered\nand continues to suffer damages.\"     The City, then, should have\nbeen on notice that she was seeking damages and could certainly\nhave posed in an interrogatory (which is meant to clarify the scope\nof the allegations in the complaint) a question to ascertain\nprecisely   what   types  of   damages   Franchina   was   seeking.\nFurthermore, in the City's pre-trial memorandum (filed a month and\na half before trial), it included proposed jury instructions on\nthe topic of damages stating: \"You may determine the amount of any\nwages and fringe benefits plaintiff would have earned in his [sic]\nemployment with defendant were it not for defendant's wrongful\nconduct.\" (Emphasis added). Such language clearly suggests that\nthe City was aware that Franchina could seek front pay.\n     25 We pause to note that while both parties also point us to\nour recent decision in Travers v. Flight Servs. & Sys., Inc., 808\nF.3d 525 (1st Cir. 2015), to support their respective arguments,\nwe are not convinced it is relevant to our analysis. In Travers\nwe were tasked with determining the validity of a front pay award\n(for purported loss of wages spanning a twenty-year time frame)\nsupported by only non-expert testimony. Id. at 545. Unlike here,\nhowever, the award in that case was based on both federal and\nMassachusetts law and \"the damages were not apportioned between\nthem.\" Id. at 546 n.15. We noted that the crux of our analysis\nin Travers \"considered only Massachusetts law.\" Id. at 545 n.14.\nThus it is not fully clear how transferable the holding in Travers\nis to the case at hand and so we do not rely on it. Still, for\nthe reasons explained above, any consideration of Travers--even\nassuming it were relevant--would result in the same outcome.\n\n\n                              - 59 -\n\fthis case demonstrates, employers should be cautioned that turning\n\na blind eye to blatant discrimination does not generally fare well\n\nunder anti-discrimination laws like Title VII.\n\n\n\n          Affirmed.

In or about 2002, Franchina was assigned\n\nto the North Main Street Fire Station in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nUp   until    2006,   she    experienced    neither    discrimination     nor\n\nharassment by members of the Department.         In fact, in her lengthy\n\ntestimony,    Franchina     recounted   numerous      kind-hearted    moments\n\n\n\n     3 Indeed, doing so is especially necessary here where the\ndistrict judge, in his discretion, imposed the equitable remedy of\nfront pay.\n\n\n                                    - 4 -\n\fduring this timeframe where she felt comradery with her colleagues.\n\nShe explained, for example, that at the beginning of her career--\n\nas a young female among a workforce consisting primarily of males-\n\n-she felt that some members of the Department took her under their\n\nwings and shielded her from individuals who sometimes got too drunk\n\nor unruly at work events.\n\n           Far    from     worrying    about     discrimination,     Franchina\n\ntestified that some of her biggest concerns during her early years\n\nhad to do with Department leadership wanting to promote her too\n\nquickly.     That her superiors wanted to promote Franchina is\n\nunsurprising given her commendable professional record.               She was\n\none   of   only   eighty     applicants       accepted   to   the   Providence\n\nFirefighter Academy out of 2,300 who applied her year and, once\n\nthere, she graduated tenth in her class.             Throughout her career\n\nher superiors noted that she \"did her job . . . the way we expected\n\nit to be done\" and effused that she was \"on her game and knows her\n\nstuff.\"    Franchina's Chief also regularly received compliments\n\nabout her performance.       Franchina, however, worried that rising up\n\nthe ranks too quickly could cause resentment among more senior\n\nfirefighters and testified that she actively attempted to keep\n\nleadership from assigning her to officer roles at the beginning.\n\nNonetheless, Franchina's superiors ultimately ordered that she be\n\npromoted from Rescue Technician to Acting Rescue Lieutenant to,\n\neventually, Rescue Lieutenant.\n\n\n                                      - 5 -\n\f              Franchina's woes began in or about 2006 when she was\n\nassigned to work a shift with Andre Ferro (\"Ferro\"), a firefighter\n\nwith a history of sexually harassing female colleagues in the\n\nDepartment.4     During that shift, Franchina and Ferro were assigned\n\nto the same rescue vehicle, with Franchina serving as an acting\n\nrescue lieutenant, and Ferro assigned to be her rescue tech\n\nchauffeur.     That is to say, Ferro was responsible for driving the\n\nrescue vehicle and Franchina served as his superior.                Franchina\n\nand Ferro had never worked with one another prior to this point,\n\nthough Franchina was aware of Ferro's dubious reputation with women\n\nand was therefore apprehensive about having to spend the shift\n\nwith him.\n\n              Ferro's   notoriety   was    on   display   within   moments    of\n\nFranchina meeting him. After arriving at the station for her shift\n\nand   while    pouring    herself   a     cup   of   coffee,   Franchina     was\n\nimmediately approached by Ferro who, without missing a beat, asked\n\n\n      4This Court is familiar with Ferro. Over fifteen years ago,\nwe encountered him in a separate Title VII action. In that case,\nthe City was found to be liable under Title VII for, among other\nthings, comments Ferro made toward the plaintiff, another female\nfirefighter named Julia O'Rourke. Ferro commented on her breast\nsize (which he referred to as \"stacked\") and suggested that if she\nhad sex with him she would \"never want another man.\" O'Rourke v.\nCity of Providence, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771503\"><a href=\"/opinion/771503/julia-m-orourke-v-city-of-providence/\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">713</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 718 (1st Cir. 2001). Ferro also\nforced O'Rourke to listen to his musings on different sexual\npositions he enjoyed and his love of oral sex, played videos of\nhimself having sex with his girlfriend in front of her, and\ndiscussed his sexual prowess and stamina. Id. Nonetheless, Ferro\nmaintained his employment with the Department in spite of the\nO'Rourke outcome.\n\n\n                                    - 6 -\n\fif she was a lesbian.           To repeat, this was their very first\n\nencounter.      After Franchina retorted that it was none of his\n\nbusiness, Ferro followed up with the statement, \"I don't normally\n\nlike to work with women; but, you know, we like the same thing, so\n\nI think we're going to get along.\"              Franchina testified she was\n\nappalled by his comments and as his supervisor, instructed him not\n\nto say such things.         She then immediately left for her office to\n\nescape him.     Soon thereafter, however, an emergency call came in\n\nand Franchina and Ferro were jointly dispatched to respond in their\n\nrescue vehicle.\n\n             During   the    emergency    run   Ferro    continued   with   his\n\ninappropriate prattle.        He asked, for example, if Franchina wanted\n\nto have children and quickly followed up with, \"I could help you\n\nwith   that,\"   implying     that   he   wanted   to    impregnate   her.   So\n\nincessant was the unprofessional chatter that Franchina was forced\n\nto tell Ferro on multiple occasions to stop talking because she\n\nwas    having   difficulty     hearing   the    dispatcher's    instructions.\n\nFranchina further testified that she refused to engage with Ferro's\n\nuncomfortable banter, instead riding in silence or telling him to\n\nbe quiet as needed.\n\n             During the same shift, Franchina and Ferro were also\n\ndispatched on a run that took them to the Rhode Island Hospital.\n\nWhen they arrived, two other rescue vehicles were on the scene,\n\nmeaning that a total of six firefighters were present (two in each\n\n\n                                     - 7 -\n\fvehicle).    The firefighters entered the hospital in order to pass\n\nalong reports about their respective transports (patients that had\n\nbeen transported to the hospital) and, after doing so, Franchina\n\nand the other firefighters (with the exception of Ferro) waited in\n\na holding area and chatted with one another.         At some point Ferro\n\napproached the group and began rubbing his nipples in a circular\n\nfashion, leapt up in the air, and screamed at Franchina, \"My\n\nlesbian lover!      How are you doing?\"     Nurses, doctors, patients,\n\nand patients' families were all present in the holding room to\n\nwitness this display.     Franchina testified that she was horrified\n\nand felt belittled.    The other firefighters present were similarly\n\nappalled.\n\n            Later that evening, after returning back to the station,\n\nFranchina went to her personal quarters and began changing out of\n\nher uniform.     Though she had closed the door, it was not locked.\n\nA rule, however, existed in the station requiring that if an\n\nofficer's door was closed, anyone seeking permission to enter had\n\nto first knock three times and wait for the officer to respond.\n\nNevertheless, without knocking, and while Franchina was changing,\n\nFerro opened the door to her room wearing what appeared to be only\n\nhis   boxers,   a   Providence   Fire   Department   shirt,   and   socks.\n\nFranchina, who was in her undergarments, quickly grabbed a sheet\n\noff her bed to cover herself. When Franchina asked Ferro to leave,\n\nhe refused.     She asked a second time, and he refused yet again.\n\n\n                                  - 8 -\n\fOnly after telling him to \"get the fuck out\" of the room did Ferro\n\nfinally depart.\n\n           Franchina never reported this repulsive behavior.           She\n\ndidn't have to.      Following the nipple-rubbing incident at the\n\nhospital, Chief Curt Varone, a high-level officer with authority\n\nover all of the stations within the Department, called her directly\n\nbecause he had \"gotten wind\" of what had transpired.        During the\n\nphone call, Chief Varone asked Franchina to recount the details of\n\nFerro's actions.    Based on Franchina's explanation, Chief Varone\n\nfiled a written complaint against Ferro charging him with sexual\n\nharassment and exposing him to employment termination.5         A hearing\n\nwas scheduled to determine whether Ferro would retain his job.\n\n           Once word spread about Ferro's disciplinary proceeding,\n\nfirefighters in the North Main Street station began to treat\n\nFranchina with contempt and disdain.     Firefighter Andy McDougal,\n\na subordinate to Franchina, approached her in the kitchen several\n\nweeks before Ferro's hearing and, in front of numerous other\n\nfirefighters, yelled at her and asked, \"What are you trying to get\n\nhim   fucking   fired?\"   Although   Captain   Alan   Horton,    the   top\n\nsupervisor in the North Main Street station, was present during\n\nthis exchange, he neither reprimanded McDougal nor reported the\n\nincident to Chief Varone.\n\n\n      5Ferro was, in fact, ultimately fired in 2007, but, again,\nwas allowed to subsequently return to the Department in 2008.\n\n\n                               - 9 -\n\f            The day following McDougal's kitchen outburst, McDougal-\n\n-who was responsible for cooking at the station--also stated to\n\nCaptain Horton that he would no longer prepare meals for Franchina.\n\nCaptain Horton, however, overrode McDougal, which angered him.\n\nAccording to Franchina, from that point forward, the meals McDougal\n\nprepared for her made her severely ill.                 Following several bouts\n\nof    ensuing    illness,   Franchina,       who   never     had    a   history   of\n\ngastrointestinal problems, decided to swap her meal with that of\n\na different rescue tech.          After that tech ate Franchina's meal,\n\nhe, too, became ill and had to go home sick.6\n\n            Starting in 2006, members of the North Main Street\n\nstation also began to refer to Franchina using gendered epithets.\n\nFor    example,    she    was   referred     to    openly      as   \"Frangina,\"   a\n\ncombination of her last name and the word \"vagina,\" which (as\n\nFranchina       testified   she    had     seen    on    the    popular    website\n\nUrbanDictionary.com) is also a slang term used to describe an\n\nunshaved        vagina.           See      Frangina,        Urban       Dictionary,\n\nhttps://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Frangina                     (last\n\nvisited Jan. 25, 2017).           Additionally, Franchina explained she\n\nheard male firefighters in the station refer to her as a \"bitch\"\n\nwith great regularity.          \"Who does that fucking bitch think she\n\nis?\"; \"I'm not going to help that fucking bitch\"; \"That bitch can\n\n\n       6\n      The record does not tell us how this meal preparation debacle\nwas ever resolved.\n\n\n                                        - 10 -\n\fcarry her own stretcher\" were common derogatory remarks hurled at\n\nFranchina.\n\n             The men of the North Main Street station did not limit\n\ntheir harassment of Franchina to verbal attacks.           Rather, at one\n\npoint they began utilizing a group white board in one of the common\n\nareas to further taunt her.     Twenty-one total insults were written\n\non the board including: \"Be careful how you talk to her, she'll\n\nbark at you,\" \"You get what you get, bitch,\" and \"Frangina leads\n\nTeam Lesbo to victory.\"      Franchina testified that she personally\n\nheard   Captain   Peter   Spedutti,    a   thirty-year    veteran    of   the\n\nDepartment, point at the white board and say, \"I'll show her.\"\n\nShe also later witnessed him boisterously brag to a younger\n\nfirefighter about what was written on the white board.              The list\n\nremained up for over fourteen hours. Although Franchina complained\n\nto Chief Michael Crawford, a superior officer in the Department,\n\nabout   what   was   being   written   about   her   on   the   board,    the\n\nperpetrators were not reprimanded.\n\n             Based on trial testimony, Franchina also suggested that\n\nthe actions of the North Main Street station put the lives of the\n\npeople of Providence at risk, including, in one instance, that of\n\nan unborn child and the child's mother.         About a month prior to\n\nFranchina leaving the North Main Street station in 2007, Franchina\n\nwas dispatched to a pre-natal facility in response to a pregnant\n\nmother experiencing fetal distress.          In order to get oxygen to\n\n\n                                 - 11 -\n\fboth the mother and baby, a device known as a non-rebreather was\n\nneeded     because   the   fetal     heartrate   was   severely   elevated.\n\nFirefighter McDougal, who had already been avoiding eye contact\n\nwith Franchina and who did not want to work with her (or, remember,\n\ncook for her), was also on the scene.            Though Franchina tasked\n\nMcDougal with securing the re-breather around the patientâ€™s nose\n\nand mouth, he continued to let the device slip off, thus preventing\n\noxygen from properly being transported to the patient.            Franchina\n\nhad to order him to get away from the patient so she could properly\n\nsecure the device herself.         Such instances of insubordination with\n\nMcDougal, Franchina recalled, were common and intentional.\n\n            Franchina was eventually transferred in 2007 from the\n\nNorth Main Street station to the Branch Avenue station and,\n\ninitially, her experiences at Branch Avenue were good.              Things,\n\nhowever, went south and her colleagues at that station began to\n\ndisplay similar behaviors to those at the North Main Street\n\nstation.    Franchina testified that the beginning of the bad times\n\nseemed to coincide with call-back shifts in which McDougal was\n\nassigned to work in the Branch Avenue station.7           During one call-\n\nback, McDougal walked into the kitchen where members of the Branch\n\nAvenue station were convening (including Franchina) and exclaimed\n\n\n\n     7  Call-back shifts are additional overtime shifts that\nfirefighters in the Department may pick up for additional\ncompensation.\n\n\n                                     - 12 -\n\floudly, \"affirmative action's killing this fucking job.\"                       An\n\nofficer who was present did not reprimand him for this outburst.\n\nOn another occasion, during a shift change, he purposely pushed\n\nFranchina       into    a   wall   when    nobody    was   looking.     Franchina\n\ncomplained about the incident to Chief Al Horton8 but nothing was\n\ndone.\n\n               Franchina explained at trial that following McDougal's\n\ncall-backs at the Branch Avenue station, she regularly began to be\n\ncalled \"bitch,\" \"cunt,\" and \"Frangina.\"                She also testified that\n\na subordinate flicked her Lieutenant's insignia on her collar and\n\nwhispered, \"I will never take a fucking order from you.\"\n\n               Franchina also testified to the inappropriate behavior\n\nthat Branch Avenue station firefighters would exhibit on emergency\n\nruns to spite her. In one instance, a firefighter purposely failed\n\nto put a wheelchair on one of Franchina's rescue vehicles when she\n\nwas responding to a patient with cerebral palsy who was wheel-\n\nchair       dependent    for   transportation.         Franchina    reported   the\n\nincident to Chief Horton but the firefighter was not reprimanded.\n\nIn   another      run,      Franchina     and    a   number   of   Branch   Avenue\n\nfirefighters responded to a car accident involving two individuals\n\nwho were severely injured.          One of them had been decapped (meaning\n\na portion of his scalp had been severed).                  Franchina was able to\n\n\n        8\n       While we referred to Horton as Captain Horton previously,\nby this point he had been promoted to Chief.\n\n\n                                        - 13 -\n\fget this victim onto a stretcher and then into a rescue vehicle\n\nbut,   while     treating   the    victim,       realized     that   none    of    the\n\nfirefighters at the scene were behind the driverâ€™s wheel to\n\ntransport the victim to the hospital.                After requesting a driver\n\nnumerous times from the firefighters on scene, Franchina was\n\naddressed by Lieutenant Anthony Lancellotti who, in a sour tone,\n\nbarked \"You'll get a driver when you get your driver.\"                      The car\n\ncrash victim later died.\n\n           During another run, Franchina and several Branch Avenue\n\nfirefighters--including           Lieutenant        Robert      Jackson,        Rescue\n\nTechnician Paul Tang, and Firefighter Sean McGarty--responded to\n\na   suicide-attempt    victim      who    had     shot     himself   in   the   head.\n\nFranchina was the officer in charge at the scene.                          Franchina\n\nordered Jackson to assist in putting the body of the victim onto\n\na stair chair so that he could be carried downstairs to the rescue\n\nvehicle.    Jackson, however, refused to comply, folded his arms,\n\nand    stated,    \"That's   a     lot    of      blood.\"       McGarty    was     also\n\ninsubordinate, and refused to comply with Franchina's directive to\n\nmove the victim to the chair.             McGarty quipped, \"if he wanted to\n\nkill himself, maybe we should just let him.\"                    Franchina ordered\n\nthe men at least four times to move the victim onto the chair.\n\nNone would comply.      Tang, in fact, took the chair and slammed it\n\nopen, but would not help put the victim in it.                            Eventually\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 14 -\n\fFranchina had to find a police officer to assist her since her own\n\nmen remained insubordinate.\n\n            Once    the    suicide-attempt         victim   was      in   the   rescue\n\nvehicle, Tang performed CPR on the victim.                  The gloves Tang wore\n\nbecame severely encrusted with blood and pieces of brain matter.\n\nAfter    Tang    completed    CPR,    he   sat   upright      with    his    hands   at\n\nFranchina's eye level.          He then removed the gloves, purposely\n\nsnapping them off in such a way as to fling the bloody debris onto\n\nFranchina's face, nose, hair, neck, eyes, ears, and mouth.\n\n            Immediately following this incident (and as a result of\n\nit), Franchina went out on disability leave for six months' time.\n\nShe also confidentially reported the incident to Chief Crawford,\n\nand     though   Crawford     contacted      the     City's     Equal       Employment\n\nOpportunity (\"EEO\") Officer, the complaint form he completed noted\n\nthat he believed Franchina was \"blowing [the incident] out of\n\nproportion.\"         The     City's    EEO   officer,         however,       concluded\n\ndifferently:\n\n        there appears to be AMPLE merit to [Franchina's] claim\n        of MULTIPLE & REPEATED violations of [Providence Fire\n        Department] RULES AND REGULATIONS.\n\n        Even seems plausible that the pervasiveness of this\n        behavior creates a HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENT for her.\n        Also seems clear that [the Department] has FAILED to\n        STOP the behavior.\n\n\n\n\n                                      - 15 -\n\fAmended Joint App'x at 1046 (emphasis in original).                     The EEO\n\nofficer testified at trial that she was unaware if anyone was ever\n\nultimately disciplined for their actions toward Franchina.\n\n             Following her return to the Department after the six-\n\nmonth leave, the abuse from her colleagues continued.                     At a\n\nDecember 2009 Christmas party in the Firefighter's Union Hall,\n\nFranchina was berated by McGarty (we will call this event the\n\n\"Union Hall Incident\").        He screamed obscenities at her, spit as\n\nhe yelled at her, and, at a whopping 6'6\", attempted to use his\n\nbody to block her from leaving the hall so he could continue his\n\nbellowing.    He called her a \"fucking doughnut,\" a \"fucking zero,\"\n\nand a \"fucking loser.\"          Two senior officers, Lieutenant Elliot\n\nMurphy and Lieutenant Robert Jackson were both about fifteen to\n\ntwenty feet away from where this harassment was occurring, yet\n\nsaid nothing.    In fact, when Franchina, seeking assistance, called\n\nout to Lieutenant Jackson--McGarty's direct supervisor--Jackson\n\nresponded,     \"I'm   not    your   fucking    baby-sitter\"       and   allowed\n\nMcGarty's tormenting to continue.\n\n             In response to this incident, Franchina sought first a\n\ntemporary restraining order (\"TRO\") against McGarty, which a Rhode\n\nIsland   state-court        judge   granted,    and   then    a    preliminary\n\ninjunction, which was also granted.            The injunction specifically\n\nrestrained McGarty from \"interfering with, molesting, harassing,\n\nannoying or contacting [Franchina] in any manner, directly or\n\n\n                                    - 16 -\n\findirectly.\"      The only exception to this injunctive relief was a\n\ncarve-out allowing the two to interact with one another \"on an\n\nemergency call, that is, specifically when [McGarty] is doing a\n\ncall on behalf of the fire department and he is on the scene.\"\n\nApart from that narrow exception, the superior court left it up to\n\nthe Department to prevent Franchina and McGarty from encountering\n\none another.   Chief Michael Dillon, Assistant Chief of Operations,\n\nsubsequently issued an order barring McGarty from working any call-\n\nbacks in stations that had a rescue unit, thus ensuring that\n\nFranchina   (as    a   rescue   lieutenant)      and   McGarty   would   never\n\ninteract.    Nonetheless, Chief Scott Mello, who was in charge of\n\nscheduling, testified that he believed such an order was impossible\n\nto enforce and, moreover, that he viewed the order as \"more of a\n\nsuggestion.\"      No surprise, then, that the order was not actually\n\nfollowed and McGarty violated it at least four separate times.\n\n            Franchina's    final    day     as    an    active-duty      rescue\n\nlieutenant was October 28, 2010.            That day, she arrived at the\n\nBranch Avenue Station only to discover that McGarty was on duty\n\nworking there.     McGarty and various other firefighters, including\n\nChief Mello (the scheduler discussed above), were on the second-\n\nfloor landing of the station, talking negatively about Franchina\n\nin a raucous manner.      Franchina heard them making fun of her and\n\nloudly exclaiming, \"Do you know who was in the fucking station\n\ntoday?   That bitch was in the station.\"          Franchina confronted the\n\n\n                                   - 17 -\n\fgroup and then reported the incident to Chief Horton.                   Again, no\n\ndisciplinary action was ever taken against anyone as a result of\n\nthis incident.\n\n             The    constant      ridicule        and   harassment      Franchina\n\nexperienced caused her to be placed on injured-on-duty (\"IOD\")\n\nstatus.      Still, in order to remain an active member of the\n\nDepartment,        Franchina     was     required       to    perform     various\n\nadministrative tasks at the Branch Avenue Station.               She testified\n\nthat she performed these tasks \"weekly\" for a \"good portion\" of\n\n2011.     The abuse, however, did not stop even when Franchina was\n\nclassified    as    IOD.       While   at   the    station,    she   would   hear\n\nfirefighters make disparaging comments about her such as \"[t]he\n\nbitch is in the house,\" and \"F that bitch . . . thank God she's\n\nnot here anymore.\"\n\n             One of the Department chiefs eventually requested that\n\nFranchina no longer come into the station.              Thereafter, Franchina\n\nremained employed with IOD status (for a total of three more\n\nyears), but she no longer physically reported in.               On November 30,\n\n2011, Franchina filed a Charge of Discrimination with the Rhode\n\nIsland Commission for Human Rights (\"RICHR\") and with the Equal\n\nEmployment    Opportunity       Commission      (\"EEOC\").      She   officially\n\nretired on disability on December 19, 2013, after being diagnosed\n\nwith severe post-traumatic stress resulting from the numerous\n\nwork-related incidents that occurred.              She testified that she can\n\n\n                                       - 18 -\n\fnever again work as a rescue lieutenant as a result of her\n\npermanent disability, which the City does not contest.                      By the\n\ntime Franchina officially retired, she had submitted approximately\n\nforty different written statements complaining of harassment,\n\ndiscrimination, and retaliation to higher-ups in the Department.\n\n            At      trial,    numerous    individuals     besides       Franchina\n\ntestified    to     the   disparities    and   harassment      faced   by    female\n\nemployees of the Department.        Lieutenant Danielle Masse testified,\n\nfor example, that women were treated as \"less competent\" than men\n\nand were \"spoken to as if they have no authority.\"                      She also\n\ntestified that when women brought issues to the Department's chain\n\nof   command,     leadership    generally      didn't   take    the    complaints\n\nseriously or deal with them in an appropriate way.                 In fact, she\n\nstated that when a woman would voice a grievance, Department\n\nleadership often turned the problem around and blamed the female\n\nfirefighter doing the complaining.\n\n            There was also testimony that female employees who dated\n\nmale firefighters were generally treated better than those who\n\nwere not intimately involved with their male colleagues. And Chief\n\nVarone testified that there were men in the Department who openly\n\ntreated     their    female    counterparts      with   contempt.           Another\n\nfirefighter, Lieutenant Andrea Stuckus, explained at trial that\n\nshe herself was followed into the women's restroom by a drunk male\n\n\n\n\n                                    - 19 -\n\ffirefighter who had to be physically removed by other male members\n\nof the Department.\n\n            At the end of the trial the jury found in favor of\n\nFranchina   on   both       her   gender-based   hostile     work    environment\n\ndiscrimination claim, as well as her retaliation claim.                 It also\n\nawarded her punitive, emotional, and front pay damages.                    After\n\njudgment was entered for Franchina, the City filed a motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law, a motion for a new trial, and, in the\n\nalternative, a motion to amend the judgment (by striking the\n\npunitive damages and front pay awards).               After a hearing, the\n\ndistrict court denied the City's motion for judgment as a matter\n\nof law and motion for a new trial.              It did, however, strike the\n\npunitive damages award after reasoning that 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1981a(b)(1)\n\nlegally   precluded     a    plaintiff   like    Franchina    from    recovering\n\npunitive damages from a municipality like the City.                  Lastly, the\n\ndistrict judge denied the City's motion to amend the judgment by\n\nstriking the jury's front pay award. In doing so, the court stated\n\nthat it had independently determined, in its equitable discretion,\n\nthat front pay was an appropriate remedy and thus awarded the same\n\namount that the jury had previously determined was fair.                      An\n\namended judgment was then entered.\n\n            With this background in place, we now turn to the issues\n\npresented on appeal, highlighting additional facts when needed to\n\nput the claims into proper perspective.\n\n\n                                      - 20 -\n\f                                 Analysis\n\n           The City appeals from the denial of its motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law, making numerous arguments as to why\n\nthe decision in this case should not stand.          While the core issue\n\non appeal involves the merits of Franchina's sex-discrimination\n\nclaim, the City complains of other supposed reversible errors--\n\nsuch as timeliness concerns and evidentiary issues--that we will\n\nalso address.   We review the district court's denial of the motion\n\nfor judgment as a matter of law de novo.        Parker v.

Â§ 2000e, et seq.,\n\nthe anti-discrimination statute upon which Franchina's claims are\n\nbased.

Â§ 2000eâ€“2(a)(2),\n\nbased on a protected characteristic such as sex.

Here, in order for the City to prevail, it must prove\n\nthat the only reasonable conclusion one could draw from the\n\nevidence is that Franchina stopped returning to the firehouse (and\n\ntherefore stopped experiencing harassment) before February 3,\n\n\n                                - 28 -\n\f2011.        We do not see the evidence in such stark a light.          Indeed,\n\nFranchina's testimony that she returned to the firehouse for a\n\n\"good portion\" of 2011 could certainly be understood to mean that\n\nshe returned past February 3, 2011 (and logic reasonably suggests\n\nthat the words \"good portion\" encompassed not merely the first\n\nthirty-three days of the year).

The Incident as a Whole\n\n            The City's first objection is to the admission of the\n\nevidence of the Union Hall Incident generally, which it lodges on\n\nrelevancy grounds.     Specifically, it contends that the incident\n\noccurred outside the workplace and is therefore irrelevant to\n\nFranchina's workplace harassment claim.        Franchina counters that\n\nincidents   outside   the    workplace   involving   her   colleagues   and\n\n\n                                  - 30 -\n\fsupervisors     are    relevant    to   establish      the   severity     and/or\n\npervasiveness of her hostile work environment claim.\n\n          Making a relevancy-based argument, as the City does, is\n\na rather tough sell.       For evidence to be relevant it \"need only\n\nmove the inquiry forward to some degree\" on a fact of consequence.\n\nBielunas v.

In cases\n\ndealing with Title VII, we have previously held that evidence of\n\nnon-workplace    conduct    is     admissible    \"to    help   determine     the\n\nseverity and pervasiveness of the hostility in the workplace.\"\n\nCrowley v. L.L. Bean, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200130\"><a href=\"/opinion/200130/crowley-v-ll-bean-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">387</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 409 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          The City nonetheless seems to argue, without citation,\n\nthat non-workplace conduct cannot be admitted as relevant unless\n\nthe incident is directly tied to consequences suffered by the\n\ncomplainant in the workplace.           It maintains that as a result of\n\nthe   Union     Hall    Incident     Franchina      suffered    no      material\n\nconsequences (i.e. reduction of pay, change in work schedule,\n\nstation relocation, or similar negative actions) at work and that,\n\nto the contrary, it was McGarty who was subject to work-based\n\nconsequences given that his assignments had to be drastically\n\nrestricted after the injunction issued.                We disagree with the\n\n\n                                    - 31 -\n\fCity's admissibility argument.         First, we have never mandated that\n\nevidence of non-workplace harassment have direct, formal workplace\n\nconsequences (such as those listed above) for it to be relevant.\n\nAnd even if such an explicit connection were required, which it is\n\nnot,    Franchina        testified    she     did     experience      workplace\n\nconsequences, in the form of removal from the firehouse, following\n\nthe Union Hall Incident.\n\n             Second--and not to belabor the point--we have explained\n\nthat non-workplace incidences are admissible if they cast light on\n\nthe motivations, pervasiveness, and/or severity of the harassment.\n\nSee Crowley, 303 F.3d at 409; see also O'Rourke, 235 F.3d at 724,\n\n727 (affirming a verdict in favor of a sexual harassment victim\n\nwho offered evidence of prank phone calls taking place outside the\n\nworkplace).    Both McCarty, the alleged harasser in the Union Hall\n\nIncident, and Lieutenant Jackson, one of the supervisors who failed\n\nto intervene, were players in Franchinaâ€™s workplace harassment\n\nclaim as each had been insubordinate in a previous rescue attempt\n\nepisode.     Just as testimony that a firefighter on duty refused to\n\ncook   for   her   or    made   Franchina   sick    helps   to   establish   the\n\npervasiveness      and    severity    of    the     hostility    in   her    work\n\nenvironment, so too does off-duty evidence demonstrating Franchina\n\nwas berated, spit at, and otherwise assaulted by a co-worker while\n\na supervising officer stood by. Therefore, the Union Hall Incident\n\nwas not isolated, non-work related conduct, but rather evidence\n\n\n                                     - 32 -\n\fsupporting the magnitude of the workplace harassment Franchina\n\nendured; a permissible means.            See Crowley, 303 F.3d at 409.\n\n              Because the City's relevancy argument cannot withstand\n\nour   scrutiny    we     turn    next    to   the    City's       challenge    to     the\n\ntranscript's admissibility specifically.\n\n         2. The Preliminary Injunction Hearing Transcript\n\n              As noted above, after the Union Hall Incident Franchina\n\nsought   and     then    received       injunctive      relief      against    McGarty\n\nfollowing a multi-witness hearing before the Rhode Island Superior\n\nCourt.   At Franchina's Title VII trial, the district court, over\n\nthe   City's     objection,        admitted      into    evidence      the     hearing\n\ntranscript from the superior court proceeding.                    The City contends\n\nthe   admission         was     erroneous     because       the     transcript        was\n\ninadmissible      hearsay.       Franchina    disagrees,          arguing    that    the\n\ntranscript was not admitted to prove what happened at the Union\n\nHall, but rather for the non-hearsay purpose of demonstrating (as\n\nthe   trial     court    explained      in    its    jury    instructions)          \"that\n\nmanagement-level employees of the City [ ] knew or should have\n\nknown of the harassment, and that those management-level employees\n\nfailed to implement prompt and appropriate remedial actions that\n\n[we]re reasonably calculated to stop the harassment and remedy the\n\nsituation.\"      We agree with Franchina.\n\n              Out-of-court statements are considered \"nonhearsay\" when\n\nthey are offered not for the truth of the matter but for some other\n\n\n                                        - 33 -\n\fpurpose.

And Lieutenant Jackson testified\n\nthat he had heard rumors that Franchina was filing a lawsuit\n\nagainst the Department related to his alleged insubordination\n\nduring a rescue. Such evidence of widespread knowledge among\n\nemployees can be probative of an employer's notice and, therefore,\n\n\n\n     14 Firefighter Michael Evora also testified about the fact\nthat he witnessed the argument, but was unable to determine what\nhad caused it and did not hear what they were arguing over.

For the reasons that follow, we\n\nconclude the City's charge overshoots its target.\n\n 1.   What's Required to Prove a Sex-Plus Claim under Title VII?\n\n          Before delving into the heart of the City's argument, we\n\nbriefly pause to shed some light on what we perceive to be a\n\nmisapprehension by the City over what is required to prove a\n\nhostile work environment claim when a plaintiff (like Franchina)\n\npremises her claim on a \"sex-plus theory.\"        In short, \"sex-plus\n\nclaims\" are a flavor of gender discrimination claims where \"an\n\nemployer classifies employees on the basis of sex plus another\n\n\n\n\nnot up for appeal. Franchina thus maintains that there is no live\ncase and controversy and the discrimination claim is moot.\n     But the City's notice of appeal was all encompassing.      It\nspecifically stated that it was appealing \"all adverse orders and\nrulings made by the District Court in this action,\" including \"all\njudgments and amended judgments.\"    Thus, at the very least, it\ncertainly had standing to challenge the retaliation claim. While\nit is true that the City provided no argumentation on the merits\nof the retaliation claim, we will assume (favorably to the City)\nthat the argument was not waived. See De JesÃºs v.

The City contends, as best we can tell, that for a\n\nplaintiff to be successful under a sex-plus theory, a separate,\n\nmore   stringent      evidentiary      standard     exists    than    for    straight\n\nclaims of sex discrimination.            The City, it seems, believes that\n\nunder a sex-plus theory, plaintiffs are required to identify a\n\ncorresponding sub-class of the opposite gender and show that the\n\ncorresponding class was not subject to similar harassment or\n\ndiscrimination.       Thus, for Franchina to succeed, the City tells us\n\nshe    is   required     to    have    presented    evidence     at   trial        of   a\n\ncomparative      class    of     gay    male     firefighters     who       were    not\n\ndiscriminated against.          Without such a showing, the City contends,\n\nit would not be possible to prove that any sort of differential\n\ntreatment a plaintiff experiences is necessarily predicated on his\n\nor her gender.\n\n              This approach--one that we have never endorsed--has some\n\nrather      obvious   flaws.      Indeed,      at   oral     argument,      the    City\n\nrecognized one of them in its concession that such a standard would\n\npermit employers to discriminate free from Title VII recourse so\n\nlong as they do not employ any subclass member of the opposite\n\ngender.      But, of course, that cannot be.

But see\n\nChadwick, 561 F.3d at 41.17       The result that would follow from the\n\nCity's approach would, thus, be inapposite to Title VII's mandate\n\nagainst sex-based discrimination.\n\n             Indeed,   at   the   advent    of    sex-plus   claims,   courts\n\nrecognized that \"[t]he effect of [Title VII] is not to be diluted\n\nbecause discrimination adversely affects only a portion of the\n\nprotected class.\"      Sprogis v.

Indeed, Higgins\n\nexpressly disclaimed reaching a conclusion on that issue.           See 194\n\nF.3d at 260 (explaining that while appellant made a sex-plus\n\nargument on appeal, that claim \"never surfaced in the district\n\ncourt\" and, therefore, the court would not reach that issue on the\n\nmerits).

And we see no\n\nreason why claims where the \"plus-factor\" is sexual orientation\n\nwould not be viable if the gay or lesbian plaintiff asserting the\n\nclaim also demonstrates that he or she was discriminated at least\n\nin part because of his or her gender.\n\n           Here, Franchina presented a plethora of evidence showing\n\nthat the impetus for the discrimination she sustained was based in\n\npart on her being a female.

Because the question here is whether\n\nthe applicable law was adequately conveyed, our review is de novo.\n\nThe supposedly problematic instruction reads as follows:\n\n     Element three requires that harassment must be based on\n     gender.   The plaintiff need not prove that all women\n     were discriminated against or were harassed, but she\n     must prove that she was harassed at least in part because\n     she is a woman.\n     In other words, she may meet this element by proving\n     that she was harassed because she is part of a subclass\n     of women, in this case lesbians, if she also proves that\n     this harassment was at least in part because of her sex\n     or gender.\n            The City argues that this instruction is inconsistent\n\nwith the law, and states that the following sentence should have\n\nbeen added in order for the instruction to be legally sufficient:\n\n\"If you find that Ms. Franchina faced harassment solely because of\n\nher sexual orientation, then she has not proven that she faced\n\nharassment because of her gender.\"\n\n            Where \"a party assigns error to the failure to give a\n\nrequested   instruction,    the   threshold    inquiry   is   whether   the\n\n\n\n                                  - 46 -\n\frequested instruction was correct as a matter of law.\"            Shervin,\n\n804 F.3d at 47.

As such, the\n\ninstruction was \"in substance, legally correct,\" Shervin, 804 F.3d\n\nat 47, and the City's requested instruction would have been mere\n\nsuperfluity.

That is so, the City\n\ncontends, because the district court erred post-trial when it\n\nfailed to grant the City's motion to alter or amend the judgment\n\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).      The City's argument on this\n\npoint is three-fold.    First, the City contends that there was no\n\ncompetent evidence to support any award of front pay damages.\n\nSecond, the City argues that the judge erred in failing to instruct\n\nthe jury that any front pay award needed to be reduced to present\n\nvalue.

Exploring the Arguments\n\n             Because the City's second argument does not cause us to\n\ntarry, we begin there.          The City contends that the judge's front\n\npay   jury   instruction   constituted       reversible   error    because   it\n\nfailed to instruct the jury that any award needed to be reduced to\n\npresent day value.      Given our clear case law, ordinarily we would\n\nagree.21     However, we ask the reader to recall that, although the\n\n\n      21\n       Had the district court not made an independent award, our\nstandard of review would be de novo rather than abuse of\n\n\n                                    - 51 -\n\fdistrict court did initially submit the front pay issue to the\n\njury, it went a step further and exercised its equitable discretion\n\nto independently (and alternatively) award Franchina front pay\n\n(and at the same time clearly stated the award had been reduced to\n\npresent day value).   And the City is in agreement that a judge may\n\nfashion a front pay award--at the charge conference, the City's\n\ncounsel argued that the front pay question should not be given to\n\nthe jury because \"front pay is an equitable matter to be determined\n\nby the Court.\"   Therefore, because the City makes no challenge to\n\nthe district judge's ability to make front pay determinations, we\n\nmove on to discuss the City's more substantive attacks, the essence\n\nof both being the City's contention that \"[Franchina] presented\n\nvirtually zero evidence upon which a jury or the Court could\n\nfashion an appropriate award on front pay.\"\n\n          The City challenges the sufficiency of Franchina's front\n\npay award claiming she failed to meet her burden of presenting the\n\n\"essential data\" needed to calculate such an award.   Relying on a\n\nD.C. Circuit case, the City tells us \"essential data\" constitutes\n\n\"the amount of the proposed award, the length of time the plaintiff\n\nexpects to work for the defendant, and the applicable discount\n\n\n\n\ndiscretion.

Cir. 1995)\n\n(citation omitted).\n\n             We agree that Franchina bore the burden of proving her\n\nentitlement to front pay in the amount awarded.                We disagree,\n\nthough, that she failed to produce any evidence in support of the\n\ndistrict court's determination. In deciding on a request for front\n\npay, a district court can consider an array of issues.                A non-\n\nexhaustive list includes the following: Is the plaintiff able and\n\nallowed to return to work with the employer? What pay and benefits\n\nwas she receiving?     What other work can and will she likely obtain\n\nto offset the loss?      What pay increases might she have obtained\n\nhad she remained employed?        For how long would she have worked?\n\nWhat will be the effects of inflation?            What will be the rate of\n\nreturn on any award?\n\n             Franchina's evidence covered most but not all of these\n\nfactors (for instance she did not propose a discount rate).               In\n\nterms   of    the   evidence    she     did    present,   though,   Franchina\n\ndemonstrated the following:             She had been earning $98,000 to\n\n$130,000 per year while employed with the Department; she is\n\npermanently disabled from continuing a career as a first responder\n\nin the Department; and she is receiving $25,000 per year in\n\ndisability benefits.     There was also testimony that she possessed\n\nexcellent    professional      skills    and    leadership   qualities,   and\n\nalthough she started in the Department as an entry-level Rescue\n\n\n                                      - 53 -\n\fTechnician, she quickly moved through the ranks and reached the\n\nlevel of Rescue Lieutenant (a leadership position).                Furthermore,\n\nFranchina had worked for ten years in the Department, yet was only\n\n44 years old at the time she left her job.                  The Department's\n\npension structure also encouraged Department employees to maintain\n\nemployment for great lengths of time.               Indeed, future benefits\n\nwere linked with longevity of service.              And she put on evidence\n\nthat numerous other employees spent upwards of 30-35 years with\n\nthe Department.\n\n           Given all of this, the crucial factor in estimating\n\nfuture   lost   wages    was    the   number   of   years   that    her   annual\n\nunadjusted loss of $73,000 to $105,000 would have continued.\n\nTwenty years would have generated a figure of $1.4 million to $2\n\nmillion.   Adding in for inflation and lost pension would have\n\nbumped this number up.         Reducing to present value may have reduced\n\nit as much, or perhaps more.          On this record, we see no reason to\n\nconclude that the record's omission of a discount rate rendered an\n\naward of $545,000 improper as a matter of law, at least where the\n\nadjudicator is a trial judge likely well familiar with the concept\n\nof present value.       Clearly the judge assumed that the future was\n\nuncertain, and an award for over $1 million unwarranted. Its ample\n\ndiscretion to discount for uncertainty dwarfed as a practical\n\nmatter any loss of precision in discounting for a reasonable rate\n\nof return where the likely duration was perhaps five years.\n\n\n                                      - 54 -\n\fCertainly the court could have awarded much less.   But its failure\n\nto insist that Franchina provide it with more precise information\n\nprovides no reason to set aside the award.\n\n            Nonetheless, the City posits that even if we conclude\n\nFranchina presented significant (and relevant) evidence going to\n\n\"essential data\" for crafting a front pay award, it says her damage\n\nclaim is still doomed because she failed to produce an expert\n\nwitness who could provide the fact finder with a proper methodology\n\nfor reducing any award to present day value.22\n\n            The City's primary contention is that it is \"standard\n\npractice\" for plaintiffs in employment discrimination suits to\n\npresent expert testimony on future earnings.        Based on this\n\nsupposed norm, the City tells us that it thus follows that expert\n\ntestimony must always be a requirement for calculating front pay.\n\nTo support its argument, the City directs us to Virgo v.

But those cases do not assist the City because neither\n\n\n     22 And even though the district court, in making its\nindependent front pay determination, expressly indicated that it\nhad discounted the award to present day value, the City argues\nthere is no indication it actually did so. Rather, as the City\naccuses, the district court \"did not make its own determination,\nequitable or otherwise . . .     but merely accepted the jury's\n[unsupported] front pay award.\" Given the considerable discretion\nafforded the district court in fashioning an equitable remedy, we\nhave no reason to believe the court didn't do what it said it had\ndone.\n\n\n                              - 55 -\n\fVirgo nor Lussier tackled the issue we are confronted with here--\n\nwhether expert testimony is a precondition for the calculation of\n\nany front pay award.\n\n          The City points to no First Circuit case in which we\n\nreached the conclusion the City now advocates for (and we have\n\nfound none in our independent search).23   However, several of our\n\nsister circuits have had occasion to opine on this issue.

Moreover, based upon our review of the\n\nentire record, we find no evidentiary insufficiency and no abuse\n\n\n\n\n                               - 58 -\n\fof discretion in the district court's front pay call.24    We thus\n\nleave Franchina's award of damages undisturbed.25\n\n                            Conclusion\n\n          The abuse Lori Franchina suffered at the hands of the\n\nProvidence Fire Department is nothing short of abhorrent and, as\n\n\n     24The City suggests that because Franchina's proposed witness\nlist did not designate an expert to calculate the discount rate,\nit assumed she was not seeking a front pay award. Had it known\nshe was, in fact, asking for future earnings, it might have\nretained an expert of its own on this topic.          While it is\nunfortunate that the City made this dubious assumption, it in no\nway impacts our outcome here. In the complaint, Franchina clearly\nstated in her Title VII claim against the City that she \"suffered\nand continues to suffer damages.\"     The City, then, should have\nbeen on notice that she was seeking damages and could certainly\nhave posed in an interrogatory (which is meant to clarify the scope\nof the allegations in the complaint) a question to ascertain\nprecisely   what   types  of   damages   Franchina   was   seeking.\nFurthermore, in the City's pre-trial memorandum (filed a month and\na half before trial), it included proposed jury instructions on\nthe topic of damages stating: \"You may determine the amount of any\nwages and fringe benefits plaintiff would have earned in his [sic]\nemployment with defendant were it not for defendant's wrongful\nconduct.\" (Emphasis added). Such language clearly suggests that\nthe City was aware that Franchina could seek front pay.\n     25 We pause to note that while both parties also point us to\nour recent decision in Travers v. Flight Servs. & Sys., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">808</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">525</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 2015), to support their respective arguments,\nwe are not convinced it is relevant to our analysis. In Travers\nwe were tasked with determining the validity of a front pay award\n(for purported loss of wages spanning a twenty-year time frame)\nsupported by only non-expert testimony. Id. at 545. Unlike here,\nhowever, the award in that case was based on both federal and\nMassachusetts law and \"the damages were not apportioned between\nthem.\" Id. at 546 n.15. We noted that the crux of our analysis\nin Travers \"considered only Massachusetts law.\" Id. at 545 n.14.\nThus it is not fully clear how transferable the holding in Travers\nis to the case at hand and so we do not rely on it. Still, for\nthe reasons explained above, any consideration of Travers--even\nassuming it were relevant--would result in the same outcome.\n\n\n                              - 59 -\n\fthis case demonstrates, employers should be cautioned that turning\n\na blind eye to blatant discrimination does not generally fare well\n\nunder anti-discrimination laws like Title VII.\n\n\n\n          Affirmed.   Costs awarded to appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                              - 60 -\n\f</pre>",
