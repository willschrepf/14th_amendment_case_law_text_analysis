Lloyd King, Bankruptcy Judges,\n28   also presided over portions of the underlying bankruptcy case.\n\f 1   Before: DUNN, JURY and KIRSCHER, Bankruptcy Judges.\n 2\n 3        This appeal follows a bitter dispute between chapter 113\n 4   debtor Horizon Ridge Medical & Corporate Center, LLC (“Horizon\n 5   Ridge”), and its major creditor Bank of America, N.A. (the\n 6   “Bank”).    Horizon Ridge filed its bankruptcy case in an apparent\n 7   effort to resolve a relatively minor disagreement with the Bank\n 8   over tenant improvement deposits, but the case quickly spiraled\n 9   out of control.    Counsel for Horizon Ridge allowed the\n10   exclusivity period to expire, and the Bank proposed a plan of\n11   liquidation.    Horizon Ridge engaged Gordon Silver as substitute\n12   counsel and countered with a reorganization plan of its own.\n13        Ultimately, the bankruptcy court confirmed the Bank’s plan,\n14   which required the Bank to assume the obligation of paying\n15   allowed administrative expenses.        Gordon Silver applied for and\n16   received final approval of its fees and costs in the amount of\n17   $512,741.30.    The Bank appeals.   We AFFIRM.\n18                          I.   FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n19   A.   Events prior to Gordon Silver’s involvement\n20        From its inception, the underlying chapter 11 case has been\n21   essentially a two-party dispute between Horizon Ridge and the\n22   Bank.    Horizon Ridge was the owner and operator of the Horizon\n23   Ridge Medical & Corporate Center (the “Medical Center”) in\n24   Henderson, Nevada.    Dr. Rick Abelson held a 90% managing\n25\n26        3\n            Unless otherwise indicated, all chapter and section\n27   references are to the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §§ 101-1532.\n     All “Rule” references are to the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy\n28   Procedure.\n\n                                         2\n\f 1   membership interest in Horizon Ridge, and Chandrakant Patel held\n 2   the remaining 10% interest.    The Medical Center was Horizon\n 3   Ridge’s only substantial asset.    In 2012, Horizon Ridge had a\n 4   total of four creditors: three unsecured creditors, whose claims\n 5   totaled no more than $9,000, and the Bank, which held a claim in\n 6   the amount of approximately $4 million, secured by a deed of\n 7   trust on the Medical Center.\n 8        Apparently, a relatively minor4 dispute arose between\n 9   Horizon Ridge and the Bank concerning tenant improvement\n10   deposits.   Dr. Abelson met with an attorney to discuss Horizon\n11   Ridge’s options.   Horizon Ridge hired the attorney and his firm,\n12   and in a move the bankruptcy court later labeled “improvident,”\n13   the firm filed a chapter 11 petition in behalf of Horizon Ridge.\n14   By all accounts, counsel’s performance was abysmal.    According to\n15   Dr. Abelson, the firm misled him as to the progress of the case;\n16   failed to discuss with him the significance of the § 1121(b)\n17   exclusivity period or the need to propose a reorganization plan\n18   before it expired; sent an inexperienced attorney unfamiliar with\n19   the case to appear in court; and refused to return Dr. Abelson’s\n20   increasingly distressed phone calls.5\n21        Meanwhile, after Horizon Ridge’s exclusivity period expired\n22   with no plan having been proposed, the Bank promptly filed its\n23   own chapter 11 plan, proposing to liquidate substantially all of\n24\n          4\n25          The bankruptcy court noted that the amount in controversy\n     was “less than $200,000.” Gordon Silver represented in its brief\n26   on appeal that it was less than $90,000.\n27        5\n            In the bankruptcy court’s more pithy description, the\n28   attorneys “didn’t have any idea what the devil they were doing.”\n\n                                       3\n\f 1   Horizon Ridge’s assets, consisting primarily of the Medical\n 2   Center (the “Liquidation Plan”).       The Liquidation Plan proposed\n 3   to sell the Medical Center, with the proceeds to be applied to\n 4   the Bank’s allowed secured claim and any surplus to be\n 5   distributed to Dr. Abelson and Mr. Patel, whose membership\n 6   interests in Horizon Ridge would be extinguished.      The\n 7   administrator of the Liquidation Plan would be required to pay\n 8   all allowed administrative expense claims, as well as all allowed\n 9   unsecured claims, in full, regardless of the amount generated by\n10   the sale of the Medical Center.    Together with the Liquidation\n11   Plan, the Bank filed a motion requesting entry of an order\n12   confirming that no disclosure statement would be required for the\n13   Liquidation Plan, as each interested party’s acceptance or\n14   rejection was implied as a matter of law without the need to\n15   vote.6\n16        This motion was set for hearing on September 26, 2012,\n17   together with the following motions made by Horizon Ridge: (1) a\n18   motion to value the Medical Center and “strip” the Bank’s lien;\n19   (2) a motion to dismiss the case; and (3) an objection to the\n20   Bank’s secured claim.   In the latter two motions, Horizon Ridge\n21   argued that the Bank was not the proper party in interest to\n22   assert its secured claim.   The day before the September 26\n23   hearing, Horizon Ridge filed its own plan of reorganization and\n24\n25\n          6\n            We exercise our discretion to take judicial notice of\n26   documents filed in the Debtor’s bankruptcy case. See Fear v.\n27   United States Trustee (In re Ruiz), 541 B.R. 892, 894 n.3 (9th\n     Cir. BAP 2015); Atwood v. Chase Manhattan Mortg. Co.\n28   (In re Atwood), 293 B.R. 227, 233 n.9 (9th Cir. BAP 2003).\n\n                                        4\n\f 1   disclosure statement, both of which were set for hearing on\n 2   October 31.    At the September 26 hearing, the bankruptcy court\n 3   denied all of Horizon Ridge’s motions and granted the Bank’s\n 4   motion.   The bankruptcy court also scheduled a confirmation\n 5   hearing on the Liquidation Plan for November 14, 2012, just two\n 6   weeks after the scheduled initial hearing on Horizon Ridge’s plan\n 7   and disclosure statement.\n 8   B.   Events following retention of Gordon Silver\n 9        Following the September 26 hearing, Dr. Abelson sought\n10   substitute counsel for Horizon Ridge to salvage the situation.\n11   Ultimately, he selected Gordon Silver, whom he paid a $40,000\n12   retainer out of his personal bank account.    Shortly after being\n13   retained, Gordon Silver filed an application to approve its\n14   employment, along with an amended plan of reorganization (the\n15   “Reorganization Plan”) and accompanying disclosure statement.\n16   The Reorganization Plan proposed to pay holders of priority\n17   claims, in full, no sooner than 90 days after the effective date\n18   of the plan.   General unsecured creditors would also receive\n19   payment in full, but the payments would be distributed in\n20   installments over a period of six months.    As for the Bank’s\n21   secured claim, Horizon Ridge proposed to make interest-only\n22   payments for three years, followed by four years of principal and\n23   interest payments, amortized over a thirty-year period, with a\n24   substantial balloon payment coming due at the end of the seventh\n25   year.\n26        The Bank objected to Gordon Silver’s employment application.\n27   It argued that Dr. Abelson’s payment of the $40,000 retainer,\n28   together with the provisions of the Reorganization Plan - which\n\n                                       5\n\f 1   the Bank viewed as unreasonably indulgent toward equity holders\n 2   and hostile toward the Bank - demonstrated that Gordon Silver was\n 3   not disinterested and represented an interest adverse to the\n 4   estate, namely Dr. Abelson himself.    After hearing, the\n 5   bankruptcy court approved Gordon Silver’s employment.    To address\n 6   the Bank’s concern about the potentially conflicting interests of\n 7   the bankruptcy estate and Dr. Abelson, the bankruptcy court\n 8   ordered Dr. Abelson to retain independent counsel.    Dr. Abelson\n 9   did so, and attorney Dorothy Bunce eventually docketed a notice\n10   of appearance on his behalf.\n11        Over the Bank’s opposition, the bankruptcy court granted\n12   conditional approval of Horizon Ridge’s disclosure statement and\n13   rescheduled the hearing on confirmation of the Liquidation Plan\n14   to take place simultaneously with a newly scheduled confirmation\n15   hearing for the Reorganization Plan.    This hearing was postponed\n16   several times over the course of the next year, as the parties\n17   litigated a series of related issues, including:\n18        (1)   After an evidentiary hearing on valuation of the\n19   Medical Center, the bankruptcy court entered an order determining\n20   its value to be $3,975,000.\n21        (2)   After a hearing on Horizon Ridge’s objection to the\n22   Bank’s secured claim, the bankruptcy court disallowed the claim\n23   to the extent of an asserted prepayment premium of $192,176.20.\n24   The bankruptcy court further disallowed the portion of the claim\n25   asserting postpetition interest in the amount of $578,036.18 on\n26   the grounds that the Bank’s claim was undersecured, based on the\n27   determined value of the Medical Center.    Otherwise, the\n28   bankruptcy court allowed the Bank’s claim as a secured claim in\n\n                                      6\n\f 1   the amount of $3,975,000 (i.e., the value of the Medical Center)\n 2   and as an unsecured claim in the amount of $369,314.52.\n 3        The day before the final evidentiary hearing concerning\n 4   confirmation of the competing plans (the “Confirmation Hearing”),\n 5   Horizon Ridge filed a second amended plan of reorganization (the\n 6   “Amended Reorganization Plan”).     The Amended Reorganization Plan\n 7   made two significant changes to the original Reorganization Plan.\n 8   First, it bifurcated the Bank’s claim into a secured and an\n 9   unsecured claim, with the unsecured claim placed in a class by\n10   itself, separate from the unsecured claims of other creditors.\n11   The Amended Reorganization Plan proposed to pay both of the\n12   Bank’s claims on the same seven-year timetable as previously\n13   proposed.     Second, the Amended Reorganization Plan included a\n14   guaranty by Dr. Abelson and Mr. Patel of the monthly payments on\n15   the Bank’s claims during that seven-year period.     Guaranty\n16   payments were made contingent on a request from Horizon Ridge,\n17   and they did not include a guaranty of the final balloon payment\n18   as contemplated by the Amended Reorganization Plan.\n19   C.   Confirmation\n20        The Confirmation Hearing took place on September 16 and 17,\n21   2013.     Following argument at a separate hearing, the bankruptcy\n22   court entered two orders, one denying confirmation of the Amended\n23   Reorganization Plan and a second order confirming the Liquidation\n24   Plan.\n25        1.    Denial of confirmation of the Amended Reorganization\n                Plan\n26\n27        The bankruptcy court’s first reason for denying confirmation\n28   of the Amended Reorganization Plan was the inadequacy of the\n\n                                        7\n\f 1   disclosure statement.   Because nearly a year had passed between\n 2   the conditional approval of the disclosure statement and the\n 3   Confirmation Hearing, the disclosure statement was out of date\n 4   with respect to its statements regarding the Medical Center’s\n 5   occupancy rate, and it failed to provide accurate information\n 6   concerning the projected future occupancy rate.   For the same\n 7   reason, the disclosure statement grossly underreported the amount\n 8   of administrative claims: the disclosure statement stated that\n 9   administrative claims were $29,000; by the time of the\n10   Confirmation Hearing, the amount had increased to $350,000.\n11   Finally, because the disclosure statement was drafted with the\n12   original Reorganization Plan in mind, it did not reveal that,\n13   under the Amended Reorganization Plan, the Bank held by far the\n14   largest unsecured claim.\n15        Second, the bankruptcy court found that the Amended\n16   Reorganization Plan was not proposed in good faith.   The court\n17   noted that, prior to the creation under the Amended\n18   Reorganization Plan of a separate class for the Bank’s unsecured\n19   claim, this claim would have had to be classified with the other,\n20   much smaller, unsecured claims.   In that event, no impaired class\n21   of claims would have voted to accept the plan, making\n22   confirmation impossible under § 1129(a)(10).   The Amended\n23   Reorganization Plan was designed to circumvent this problem by\n24   segregating the Bank’s large unsecured claim into its own class.\n25   This allowed the other unsecured creditors - whose claims were\n26   impaired only by virtue of the proposed delayed payment - to\n27   constitute an accepting impaired class.   The bankruptcy court\n28   found this “gerrymandering” indicative of bad faith, citing Beal\n\n                                       8\n\f 1   Bank USA v. Windmill Durango Office, LLC (In re Windmill Durango\n 2   Office, LLC), 481 B.R. 51, 68 (9th Cir. BAP 2012).   See also\n 3   Village Green I, GP v. Fed. Nat’l Mtg. Ass’n (In re Village Green\n 4   I, GP), ___ F.3d ___, 2016 WL 325163 at *2 (6th Cir. Jan. 27,\n 5   2016) (impairment of minor claims in form of 60-day delay in\n 6   payment was “an artifice to circumvent the purposes of\n 7   § 1129(a)(10)” and required denial of confirmation due to bad\n 8   faith).   Also indicative of bad faith, the court found, was the\n 9   “allocation of substantially all the risk of failure” of the\n10   Amended Reorganization Plan to the Bank.\n11        Third, the court found that the Amended Reorganization Plan\n12   was not in the best interests of creditors, because it proposed\n13   to pay the Bank’s secured claim over a seven-year period with\n14   5% interest.   The court found that this was less than what the\n15   Bank would receive on account of its secured claim in the event\n16   of liquidation.\n17        Fourth, the court found that the Amended Reorganization Plan\n18   was not feasible, and that the risk of future liquidation or\n19   reorganization was unacceptably high.   In particular, the court\n20   found it unlikely that Horizon Ridge would be able to make the\n21   balloon payment at the end of the seven-year period.   Given the\n22   “perilous” nature of Horizon Ridge’s prospective occupancy rates\n23   for the years to come, the court found even the periodic payments\n24   during the seven-year period would likely be infeasible.\n25        Finally, the bankruptcy court found that the Amended\n26   Reorganization Plan was not fair and equitable.   The court found\n27   that the cash payments to the Bank contemplated by the Amended\n28   Reorganization Plan would not equal the present value of the\n\n                                      9\n\f 1   Medical Center.   Moreover, the court found that the Amended\n 2   Reorganization Plan ran afoul of the absolute priority rule,\n 3   which precludes equity holders from retaining their equity unless\n 4   all creditors are paid in full.    And since Dr. Abelson and\n 5   Mr. Patel would provide only a contingent guaranty, the court\n 6   found this provision insufficient to trigger the new value\n 7   exception to the absolute priority rule.\n 8        2.   Confirmation of the Liquidation Plan\n 9        Although the class of equity holders was deemed to have\n10   rejected the Liquidation Plan, the bankruptcy court determined\n11   that it could be confirmed under the “cramdown” provision of\n12   § 1129(b)(1).   The court rejected Horizon Ridge’s arguments that\n13   the Liquidation Plan was insufficiently specific as to the nature\n14   of the proposed liquidation sale, the assets to be sold and the\n15   identity of the plan administrator.    Horizon Ridge also objected\n16   on the ground that the Liquidation Plan failed to provide for\n17   assumption or rejection of the leases of the Medical Center’s\n18   tenants, but the court concluded that this failure was not fatal\n19   under applicable law, as the leases would ride through the\n20   confirmation process.\n21        On three points, however, the bankruptcy court made\n22   confirmation conditional on amendments to the Liquidation Plan.\n23   First, the court required the Bank to amend the plan to provide\n24   for payment in full of unsecured claims on the effective date of\n25   the plan, rather than the closing date of the proposed\n26   liquidation sale.   Second, the court required the Bank to remove\n27   a paragraph providing for exculpation of the Bank, as such\n28   provisions “cannot be permitted to stand” under Ninth Circuit\n\n                                       10\n\f 1   law.    Finally, the court took issue with a provision in the\n 2   Liquidation Plan that would have permitted the plan administrator\n 3   to review and approve administrative claims.      This “attempt[] to\n 4   overreach and have [the] Plan Administrator assume the court’s\n 5   duties under the code” would also have to be removed.      The Bank\n 6   complied with the court’s requirements by filing an amended\n 7   Liquidation Plan.\n 8   D.   Postconfirmation events and Gordon Silver’s fees\n 9          After the Liquidation Plan was confirmed, the litigation\n10   between the Bank and Horizon Ridge continued.      Horizon Ridge\n11   opposed the Bank’s proposed procedures for conducting the\n12   liquidation sale contemplated by the Liquidation Plan.      The sale\n13   itself apparently was contentious as well, with two entities,\n14   including one newly organized by Dr. Abelson, bidding cash\n15   against the Bank’s escalating credit bids.      The Bank’s winning\n16   credit bid of $4,420,000 exceeded the previously determined value\n17   of Horizon Ridge’s assets.    Horizon Ridge appealed a total of\n18   five orders of the bankruptcy court relating to confirmation and\n19   the sale.    Though Horizon Ridge sought stays pending appeal,\n20   these were denied.    The five appeals have been dismissed.\n21          On July 14, 2014, nearly two years after its employment had\n22   been approved, Gordon Silver filed a final application for\n23   payment of its fees and expenses (“Fee Application”).      The Fee\n24   Application sought final approval of payment to Gordon Silver in\n25   the total amount of $512,741.30.      The Bank objected to the Fee\n26   Application, renewing its argument that Gordon Silver had been\n27   working solely for the benefit of Dr. Abelson and Mr. Patel,\n28   rather than the estate.    The Bank did not object to the\n\n                                      11\n\f 1   reasonableness of any particular entry in Gordon Silver’s billing\n 2   itemization.\n 3        The bankruptcy court held two hearings on the Fee\n 4   Application.   At the first of these hearings (the “First Fee\n 5   Hearing”), the court heard argument from Gordon Silver and the\n 6   Bank’s counsel.   Gordon Silver argued that the Bank was obligated\n 7   by its own Liquidation Plan to pay administrative expenses and\n 8   that Gordon Silver’s rates and billing were reasonable.   At this\n 9   point, the bankruptcy court commented that reasonableness of\n10   rates was not at issue:\n11        THE COURT: Well, I don’t think [the Bank’s attorney]\n          Mr. Weiss’s objection is that your rates were\n12        unreasonable. I think Mr. Weiss’s objection was that\n          you did a lot of work that benefitted –- potentially\n13        benefitted the principal of the debtor as opposed to\n          the debtor itself.\n14\n          MS. KOZLOWSKI: Fair enough. And really that comes\n15        down to the reasonableness, reasonably likely to\n          benefit the estate prong.\n16\n17   After argument and colloquy, primarily related to this issue, the\n18   bankruptcy court concluded the hearing and scheduled an\n19   additional hearing (the “Second Fee Hearing”), at which the court\n20   would announce its decision.\n21        At the Second Fee Hearing, the bankruptcy court stated on\n22   the record that it would approve Gordon Silver’s fees in full.\n23   The court elaborated:\n24        . . . I think it’s unfortunate that we had what started\n          out as an under $200,000 fight but has led to I think\n25        in excess of a million and a half dollars in attorneys’\n          fees. But both parties have to participate in the\n26        fight. If the bank pushes back, the debtor gets to\n          push back. . . .\n27\n          . . . .\n28\n\n                                     12\n\f 1        I was a little surprised . . . [that the Bank] bid\n          actual money for –- at the time of the sale and overbid\n 2        certain other bids, which would have [paid the Bank’s\n          allowed claims] in full.\n 3\n          But I don’t think there is anything wrong with the fees\n 4        of Gordon Silver. I think the fees –- as I understand\n          it, the fees of the bank are in excess of a million\n 5        dollars. . . .\n 6        The work that was done by both sides was good. I think\n          it’s unfortunate that the parties were not able to\n 7        resolve this at some lesser sum. But as I indicated,\n          the debtor is allowed to pursue their positions, the\n 8        bank is allowed to pursue their positions, and in this\n          case it led to a great deal of money being expended.\n 9\n          I am going to approve Gordon Silver’s fees in total.\n10        The general objection was that they weren’t reasonable.\n          I think in the context of the case, they were\n11        reasonable.\n12        Following the Fee Hearing, the bankruptcy court entered an\n13   order granting the Fee Application (“Fee Order”).     In the Fee\n14   Order, the bankruptcy court noted that it had “considered the\n15   oral argument presented [at the First Fee Hearing]” and “stated\n16   its findings of fact and conclusions of law on the record at [the\n17   Second Fee Hearing].”   The court ordered that the Fee Application\n18   was approved and that Gordon Silver’s fees were incurred for\n19   services “necessary and beneficial to the estate.”\n20        This timely appeal of the Fee Order followed.\n21                            II.    JURISDICTION\n22        The bankruptcy court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.\n23   §§ 1334 and 157(b)(2)(A).      We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.\n24   § 158.\n25                               III.    ISSUES\n26        1.   Whether the bankruptcy court identified and applied the\n27   correct legal standard to its ruling on the Fee Application.\n28        2.   Whether the bankruptcy court’s findings of fact in\n\n                                        13\n\f 1   connection with the Fee Order were clearly erroneous.\n 2                          IV.   STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n 3        We review an award of professional compensation for abuse of\n 4   discretion.   Smith v. Edwards & Hale (In re Smith), 317 F.3d 918,\n 5   923 (9th Cir. 2002).    A bankruptcy court abuses its discretion\n 6   only if it applies an incorrect legal standard or misapplies the\n 7   correct legal standard, or if its factual findings are illogical,\n 8   implausible or unsupported by evidence in the record.\n 9   TrafficSchool.com, Inc. v. Edriver Inc., 653 F.3d 820, 832 (9th\n10   Cir. 2011); United States v. Hinkson, 585 F.3d 1247, 1262 (9th\n11   Cir. 2009) (en banc).    We may affirm the decision of the\n12   bankruptcy court on any basis supported by the record.    See\n13   ASARCO, LLC v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., 765 F.3d 999, 1004 (9th Cir.\n14   2014); Shanks v. Dressel, 540 F.3d 1082, 1086 (9th Cir. 2008).\n15                                V.   DISCUSSION\n16   A.   What is the proper legal standard?\n17        Before we can determine whether the bankruptcy court applied\n18   the proper legal standard in evaluating the Fee Application, we\n19   must determine what that standard is.\n20        Compensation of professionals is governed by §§ 327 and 330.\n21   Section 327 provides for “reasonable compensation for actual,\n22   necessary services” and “reimbursement for actual, necessary\n23   expenses.”    Section 330(a)(3), in turn, requires the bankruptcy\n24   court to consider “all relevant factors” in determining\n25   reasonableness of compensation, including the following:\n26        (A) the time spent on such services;\n27        (B) the rates charged for such services;\n28        (C) whether the services were necessary to the\n\n                                         14\n\f 1         administration of, or beneficial at the time at which\n           the service was rendered toward the completion of, a\n 2         case under this title;\n 3         (D) whether the services were performed within a\n           reasonable amount of time commensurate with the\n 4         complexity, importance, and nature of the problem,\n           issue, or task addressed; and\n 5\n           (E) whether the compensation is reasonable based on the\n 6         customary compensation charged by comparably skilled\n           practitioners other than in cases under this title.\n 7\n 8   11 U.S.C. § 330(a)(3)(A)-(E).    Expressly excluded from\n 9   compensation are services that are not “reasonably likely to\n10   benefit the debtor’s estate” or “necessary to the administration\n11   of the case.”    11 U.S.C. § 330(a)(4)(A).   See also Ferrette &\n12   Slater v. United States Trustee (In re Garcia), 335 B.R. 717,\n13   723-24 (9th Cir. BAP 2005).    Professional services need not\n14   result in an actual material benefit to the estate in order to be\n15   compensable.    In re Garcia, 335 B.R. at 724.   “Instead, a\n16   professional need demonstrate only that the services were\n17   reasonably likely to benefit the estate at the time rendered.”\n18   Id.\n19         A professional requesting compensation must exercise\n20   “reasonable billing judgment” in incurring its fees.     Leichty v.\n21   United States Trustee (In re Strand), 375 F.3d 854, 860 (9th Cir.\n22   2004) (quoting Roberts, Sheritan & Kotel, P.C. v. Bergen Brunswig\n23   Drug Co. (In re MEDNET, MPC Corp.), 251 B.R. 103, 108 (9th Cir.\n24   BAP 2000)).    Reasonable billing judgment includes consideration\n25   of these questions:\n26         (a) Is the burden of the probable cost of legal\n           services disproportionately large in relation to the\n27         size of the estate and maximum probable recovery?\n28         (b) To what extent will the estate suffer if the\n\n                                      15\n\f 1        services are not rendered?\n 2        (c) To what extent may the estate benefit if the\n          services are rendered and what is the likelihood of the\n 3        disputed issues being resolved successfully?\n 4   In re Garcia, 335 B.R. at 724; In re MEDNET, 251 B.R. at 108.\n 5        Some bankruptcy courts have denied compensation to attorneys\n 6   for chapter 11 debtors based on a finding that the attorneys’\n 7   services primarily benefitted debtors personally or their\n 8   principals rather than the estate.     See, e.g., In re Love,\n 9   163 B.R. 164, 174-76 (Bankr. D. Mont. 1993) (attorney’s services\n10   benefitting individual chapter 11 debtor, including defense of\n11   debtor’s family members and insiders in adversary proceedings,\n12   were not compensable); In re Grabill Corp., 110 B.R. 356, 359-60\n13   (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 1990) (after appointment of chapter 11 interim\n14   trustee, debtor’s counsel’s efforts to oppose expansion of\n15   trustee’s powers benefitted only prepetition management and were\n16   not compensable); In re Kendavis Inds. Intern., Inc., 91 B.R.\n17   742, 748-51 (Bankr. N.D. Tex. 1988) (compensation reduced for\n18   attorneys’ services in proposing a plan “inexplicably generous to\n19   stockholders” where “substantial documentary evidence” showed\n20   that attorneys in fact represented equity holders).\n21        We agree that debtors’ attorneys may not be compensated by\n22   the estate for services rendered entirely for the benefit of\n23   principals or other non-debtor parties, because such services are\n24   not “reasonably likely to benefit the debtor’s estate.”\n25   11 U.S.C. § 330(a)(4).   In exercising “reasonable billing\n26   judgment,” the first question an attorney must consider is\n27   whether “the burden of the probable cost of legal services [is]\n28   disproportionately large in relation to the size of the estate\n\n                                       16\n\f 1   and maximum probable recovery.”    In re Garcia, 335 B.R. at 724.\n 2   Because the attorney is employed by the estate, it necessarily\n 3   follows that the attorney must consider the “burden” and the\n 4   “maximum probable recovery” to the estate.\n 5   B.   Did the bankruptcy court apply the correct standard?\n 6        The Bank argues that the bankruptcy court failed to apply\n 7   the proper legal standard in its findings and conclusions made in\n 8   connection with the Fee Order.    More specifically, the Bank\n 9   argues that, although the court stated at the Second Fee Hearing\n10   that Gordon Silver’s fees were “reasonable,” it “did not consider\n11   the identity of Gordon Silver’s true client.”\n12        Although it is true that the bankruptcy court did not frame\n13   its oral findings and conclusions in terms of “the identity of\n14   Gordon Silver’s true client,” a review of the transcript of the\n15   First Fee Hearing leaves no doubt that the court “consider[ed]”\n16   the issue of whose interests were furthered by Gordon Silver’s\n17   services.   During Gordon Silver’s oral argument, the bankruptcy\n18   court specifically redirected the discussion to that very issue,\n19   which discussion dominated most of the 22-minute hearing.    As\n20   noted above, the “true client” issue is part of the broader\n21   question of whether services are “reasonably likely to benefit\n22   the debtor’s estate.”   By making findings and conclusions in\n23   Gordon Silver’s favor following extensive briefing and oral\n24   argument primarily devoted to that issue, the bankruptcy court\n25   made it clear that it had considered and rejected the Bank’s\n26   argument.   The bankruptcy court’s comments that “if the bank\n27   pushes back, the debtor gets to push back” and that “the debtor\n28   is allowed to pursue [its] positions” further demonstrate that\n\n                                       17\n\f 1   the court found Gordon Silver’s litigation activities to have\n 2   been conducted on behalf of the debtor, Horizon Ridge, rather\n 3   than Dr. Abelson and Mr. Patel.\n 4        The language of the Fee Order itself provides additional\n 5   support for this conclusion.   In the Fee Order, the bankruptcy\n 6   court stated that its decision followed consideration of the oral\n 7   argument presented at the First Fee Hearing.      The Fee Order went\n 8   on to recite that Gordon Silver’s services were “necessary and\n 9   beneficial to the estate.”\n10        We conclude that the bankruptcy court applied the proper\n11   legal standard.\n12   C.   Did the bankruptcy court clearly err in its findings?\n13        Having concluded that the bankruptcy court applied the\n14   correct standard, we must affirm unless we conclude its findings\n15   “were illogical, implausible or without support in inferences\n16   that may be drawn from facts in the record.”      Hinkson, 585 F.3d\n17   at 1262.   On this record, we cannot so conclude.\n18        The Bank concedes that Gordon Silver’s efforts were\n19   reasonably likely to benefit the estate from the commencement of\n20   its employment to the moment the bankruptcy court determined that\n21   the value of the Medical Center was less than the amount of the\n22   Bank’s allowed claims.   After that point, the Bank argues, it was\n23   established conclusively that equity holders had no legitimate\n24   interest in continuing the fight.      Thus, to extend this\n25   reasoning, since the unsecured creditors expressed no preference\n26   between the Liquidation Plan and the Reorganization Plan, the\n27   only interested party left standing was the Bank, whose interests\n28   became paramount.   By this logic, anything Gordon Silver did that\n\n                                       18\n\f 1   was adversarial toward the Bank was necessarily not in the best\n 2   interests of the estate.   The bankruptcy court was not required\n 3   to accept this narrow definition of the estate’s interests.\n 4        As the bankruptcy court noted at the Second Fee Hearing,\n 5   both the Bank and Horizon Ridge vigorously pursued their\n 6   respective litigation positions at enormous expense rather than\n 7   “resolv[ing] this at some lesser sum.”   Although the Bank\n 8   prevailed both at the Confirmation Hearing and in most of the\n 9   postconfirmation disputes, it does not follow that the bankruptcy\n10   court clearly erred in finding that Gordon Silver’s fees were\n11   reasonable “in the context of the case.”   Granted, Gordon Silver\n12   billed a large proportion of its fees in connection with its\n13   efforts to confirm a plan that ultimately was found to be\n14   unconfirmable and not proposed in good faith.   Nevertheless,\n15   nothing in the record compelled the bankruptcy court to find that\n16   the project was hopeless or that Gordon Silver’s services were\n17   not reasonably likely to confer a benefit on the estate, whether\n18   in the form of a confirmable plan or a consensual resolution\n19   between the Bank and Horizon Ridge.\n20        Indeed, as the bankruptcy court commented at the First Fee\n21   Hearing, the sale price of the Medical Center was significantly\n22   higher than its value as previously determined by the court.\n23   This fact lends support to the proposition that, at the time\n24   Gordon Silver rendered its services, it was not unreasonable to\n25   expect that Horizon Ridge could propose a confirmable\n26   reorganization plan or achieve a consensual resolution.\n27   Notwithstanding the fact that these happy outcomes did not occur,\n28   there was sufficient evidence in the record before the bankruptcy\n\n                                     19\n\f 1   court to support the finding that the services were “reasonably\n 2   likely to benefit the estate at the time rendered.”\n 3   In re Garcia, 335 B.R. at 724.\n 4                               VI.   CONCLUSION\n 5        Based upon the foregoing, we conclude that the bankruptcy\n 6   court did not abuse its discretion in approving the Fee\n 7   Application.   We AFFIRM.\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n\n                                        20\n\f",

Lloyd King, Bankruptcy Judges,\n28   also presided over portions of the underlying bankruptcy case.\n\f 1   Before: DUNN, JURY and KIRSCHER, Bankruptcy Judges.\n 2\n 3        This appeal follows a bitter dispute between chapter 113\n 4   debtor Horizon Ridge Medical & Corporate Center, LLC (“Horizon\n 5   Ridge”), and its major creditor Bank of America, N.A. (the\n 6   “Bank”).    Horizon Ridge filed its bankruptcy case in an apparent\n 7   effort to resolve a relatively minor disagreement with the Bank\n 8   over tenant improvement deposits, but the case quickly spiraled\n 9   out of control.    Counsel for Horizon Ridge allowed the\n10   exclusivity period to expire, and the Bank proposed a plan of\n11   liquidation.    Horizon Ridge engaged Gordon Silver as substitute\n12   counsel and countered with a reorganization plan of its own.\n13        Ultimately, the bankruptcy court confirmed the Bank’s plan,\n14   which required the Bank to assume the obligation of paying\n15   allowed administrative expenses.        Gordon Silver applied for and\n16   received final approval of its fees and costs in the amount of\n17   $512,741.30.    The Bank appeals.   We AFFIRM.\n18                          I.   FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n19   A.   Events prior to Gordon Silver’s involvement\n20        From its inception, the underlying chapter 11 case has been\n21   essentially a two-party dispute between Horizon Ridge and the\n22   Bank.    Horizon Ridge was the owner and operator of the Horizon\n23   Ridge Medical & Corporate Center (the “Medical Center”) in\n24   Henderson, Nevada.    Dr. Rick Abelson held a 90% managing\n25\n26        3\n            Unless otherwise indicated, all chapter and section\n27   references are to the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §§ 101-1532.\n     All “Rule” references are to the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy\n28   Procedure.\n\n                                         2\n\f 1   membership interest in Horizon Ridge, and Chandrakant Patel held\n 2   the remaining 10% interest.    The Medical Center was Horizon\n 3   Ridge’s only substantial asset.    In 2012, Horizon Ridge had a\n 4   total of four creditors: three unsecured creditors, whose claims\n 5   totaled no more than $9,000, and the Bank, which held a claim in\n 6   the amount of approximately $4 million, secured by a deed of\n 7   trust on the Medical Center.\n 8        Apparently, a relatively minor4 dispute arose between\n 9   Horizon Ridge and the Bank concerning tenant improvement\n10   deposits.   Dr. Abelson met with an attorney to discuss Horizon\n11   Ridge’s options.   Horizon Ridge hired the attorney and his firm,\n12   and in a move the bankruptcy court later labeled “improvident,”\n13   the firm filed a chapter 11 petition in behalf of Horizon Ridge.\n14   By all accounts, counsel’s performance was abysmal.    According to\n15   Dr. Abelson, the firm misled him as to the progress of the case;\n16   failed to discuss with him the significance of the § 1121(b)\n17   exclusivity period or the need to propose a reorganization plan\n18   before it expired; sent an inexperienced attorney unfamiliar with\n19   the case to appear in court; and refused to return Dr. Abelson’s\n20   increasingly distressed phone calls.5\n21        Meanwhile, after Horizon Ridge’s exclusivity period expired\n22   with no plan having been proposed, the Bank promptly filed its\n23   own chapter 11 plan, proposing to liquidate substantially all of\n24\n          4\n25          The bankruptcy court noted that the amount in controversy\n     was “less than $200,000.” Gordon Silver represented in its brief\n26   on appeal that it was less than $90,000.\n27        5\n            In the bankruptcy court’s more pithy description, the\n28   attorneys “didn’t have any idea what the devil they were doing.”\n\n                                       3\n\f 1   Horizon Ridge’s assets, consisting primarily of the Medical\n 2   Center (the “Liquidation Plan”).       The Liquidation Plan proposed\n 3   to sell the Medical Center, with the proceeds to be applied to\n 4   the Bank’s allowed secured claim and any surplus to be\n 5   distributed to Dr. Abelson and Mr. Patel, whose membership\n 6   interests in Horizon Ridge would be extinguished.      The\n 7   administrator of the Liquidation Plan would be required to pay\n 8   all allowed administrative expense claims, as well as all allowed\n 9   unsecured claims, in full, regardless of the amount generated by\n10   the sale of the Medical Center.    Together with the Liquidation\n11   Plan, the Bank filed a motion requesting entry of an order\n12   confirming that no disclosure statement would be required for the\n13   Liquidation Plan, as each interested party’s acceptance or\n14   rejection was implied as a matter of law without the need to\n15   vote.6\n16        This motion was set for hearing on September 26, 2012,\n17   together with the following motions made by Horizon Ridge: (1) a\n18   motion to value the Medical Center and “strip” the Bank’s lien;\n19   (2) a motion to dismiss the case; and (3) an objection to the\n20   Bank’s secured claim.   In the latter two motions, Horizon Ridge\n21   argued that the Bank was not the proper party in interest to\n22   assert its secured claim.   The day before the September 26\n23   hearing, Horizon Ridge filed its own plan of reorganization and\n24\n25\n          6\n            We exercise our discretion to take judicial notice of\n26   documents filed in the Debtor’s bankruptcy case.

At the September 26 hearing, the bankruptcy court\n 3   denied all of Horizon Ridge’s motions and granted the Bank’s\n 4   motion.   The bankruptcy court also scheduled a confirmation\n 5   hearing on the Liquidation Plan for November 14, 2012, just two\n 6   weeks after the scheduled initial hearing on Horizon Ridge’s plan\n 7   and disclosure statement.\n 8   B.   Events following retention of Gordon Silver\n 9        Following the September 26 hearing, Dr. Abelson sought\n10   substitute counsel for Horizon Ridge to salvage the situation.\n11   Ultimately, he selected Gordon Silver, whom he paid a $40,000\n12   retainer out of his personal bank account.    Shortly after being\n13   retained, Gordon Silver filed an application to approve its\n14   employment, along with an amended plan of reorganization (the\n15   “Reorganization Plan”) and accompanying disclosure statement.\n16   The Reorganization Plan proposed to pay holders of priority\n17   claims, in full, no sooner than 90 days after the effective date\n18   of the plan.   General unsecured creditors would also receive\n19   payment in full, but the payments would be distributed in\n20   installments over a period of six months.    As for the Bank’s\n21   secured claim, Horizon Ridge proposed to make interest-only\n22   payments for three years, followed by four years of principal and\n23   interest payments, amortized over a thirty-year period, with a\n24   substantial balloon payment coming due at the end of the seventh\n25   year.\n26        The Bank objected to Gordon Silver’s employment application.\n27   It argued that Dr. Abelson’s payment of the $40,000 retainer,\n28   together with the provisions of the Reorganization Plan - which\n\n                                       5\n\f 1   the Bank viewed as unreasonably indulgent toward equity holders\n 2   and hostile toward the Bank - demonstrated that Gordon Silver was\n 3   not disinterested and represented an interest adverse to the\n 4   estate, namely Dr. Abelson himself.    After hearing, the\n 5   bankruptcy court approved Gordon Silver’s employment.    To address\n 6   the Bank’s concern about the potentially conflicting interests of\n 7   the bankruptcy estate and Dr. Abelson, the bankruptcy court\n 8   ordered Dr. Abelson to retain independent counsel.    Dr. Abelson\n 9   did so, and attorney Dorothy Bunce eventually docketed a notice\n10   of appearance on his behalf.\n11        Over the Bank’s opposition, the bankruptcy court granted\n12   conditional approval of Horizon Ridge’s disclosure statement and\n13   rescheduled the hearing on confirmation of the Liquidation Plan\n14   to take place simultaneously with a newly scheduled confirmation\n15   hearing for the Reorganization Plan.    This hearing was postponed\n16   several times over the course of the next year, as the parties\n17   litigated a series of related issues, including:\n18        (1)   After an evidentiary hearing on valuation of the\n19   Medical Center, the bankruptcy court entered an order determining\n20   its value to be $3,975,000.\n21        (2)   After a hearing on Horizon Ridge’s objection to the\n22   Bank’s secured claim, the bankruptcy court disallowed the claim\n23   to the extent of an asserted prepayment premium of $192,176.20.\n24   The bankruptcy court further disallowed the portion of the claim\n25   asserting postpetition interest in the amount of $578,036.18 on\n26   the grounds that the Bank’s claim was undersecured, based on the\n27   determined value of the Medical Center.    Otherwise, the\n28   bankruptcy court allowed the Bank’s claim as a secured claim in\n\n                                      6\n\f 1   the amount of $3,975,000 (i.e., the value of the Medical Center)\n 2   and as an unsecured claim in the amount of $369,314.52.\n 3        The day before the final evidentiary hearing concerning\n 4   confirmation of the competing plans (the “Confirmation Hearing”),\n 5   Horizon Ridge filed a second amended plan of reorganization (the\n 6   “Amended Reorganization Plan”).     The Amended Reorganization Plan\n 7   made two significant changes to the original Reorganization Plan.\n 8   First, it bifurcated the Bank’s claim into a secured and an\n 9   unsecured claim, with the unsecured claim placed in a class by\n10   itself, separate from the unsecured claims of other creditors.\n11   The Amended Reorganization Plan proposed to pay both of the\n12   Bank’s claims on the same seven-year timetable as previously\n13   proposed.     Second, the Amended Reorganization Plan included a\n14   guaranty by Dr. Abelson and Mr. Patel of the monthly payments on\n15   the Bank’s claims during that seven-year period.     Guaranty\n16   payments were made contingent on a request from Horizon Ridge,\n17   and they did not include a guaranty of the final balloon payment\n18   as contemplated by the Amended Reorganization Plan.\n19   C.   Confirmation\n20        The Confirmation Hearing took place on September 16 and 17,\n21   2013.     Following argument at a separate hearing, the bankruptcy\n22   court entered two orders, one denying confirmation of the Amended\n23   Reorganization Plan and a second order confirming the Liquidation\n24   Plan.\n25        1.    Denial of confirmation of the Amended Reorganization\n                Plan\n26\n27        The bankruptcy court’s first reason for denying confirmation\n28   of the Amended Reorganization Plan was the inadequacy of the\n\n                                        7\n\f 1   disclosure statement.   Because nearly a year had passed between\n 2   the conditional approval of the disclosure statement and the\n 3   Confirmation Hearing, the disclosure statement was out of date\n 4   with respect to its statements regarding the Medical Center’s\n 5   occupancy rate, and it failed to provide accurate information\n 6   concerning the projected future occupancy rate.   For the same\n 7   reason, the disclosure statement grossly underreported the amount\n 8   of administrative claims: the disclosure statement stated that\n 9   administrative claims were $29,000; by the time of the\n10   Confirmation Hearing, the amount had increased to $350,000.\n11   Finally, because the disclosure statement was drafted with the\n12   original Reorganization Plan in mind, it did not reveal that,\n13   under the Amended Reorganization Plan, the Bank held by far the\n14   largest unsecured claim.\n15        Second, the bankruptcy court found that the Amended\n16   Reorganization Plan was not proposed in good faith.   The court\n17   noted that, prior to the creation under the Amended\n18   Reorganization Plan of a separate class for the Bank’s unsecured\n19   claim, this claim would have had to be classified with the other,\n20   much smaller, unsecured claims.   In that event, no impaired class\n21   of claims would have voted to accept the plan, making\n22   confirmation impossible under § 1129(a)(10).   The Amended\n23   Reorganization Plan was designed to circumvent this problem by\n24   segregating the Bank’s large unsecured claim into its own class.\n25   This allowed the other unsecured creditors - whose claims were\n26   impaired only by virtue of the proposed delayed payment - to\n27   constitute an accepting impaired class.   The bankruptcy court\n28   found this “gerrymandering” indicative of bad faith, citing Beal\n\n                                       8\n\f 1   Bank USA v.

Jan. 27,\n 5   2016) (impairment of minor claims in form of 60-day delay in\n 6   payment was “an artifice to circumvent the purposes of\n 7   § 1129(a)(10)” and required denial of confirmation due to bad\n 8   faith).   Also indicative of bad faith, the court found, was the\n 9   “allocation of substantially all the risk of failure” of the\n10   Amended Reorganization Plan to the Bank.\n11        Third, the court found that the Amended Reorganization Plan\n12   was not in the best interests of creditors, because it proposed\n13   to pay the Bank’s secured claim over a seven-year period with\n14   5% interest.   The court found that this was less than what the\n15   Bank would receive on account of its secured claim in the event\n16   of liquidation.\n17        Fourth, the court found that the Amended Reorganization Plan\n18   was not feasible, and that the risk of future liquidation or\n19   reorganization was unacceptably high.   In particular, the court\n20   found it unlikely that Horizon Ridge would be able to make the\n21   balloon payment at the end of the seven-year period.   Given the\n22   “perilous” nature of Horizon Ridge’s prospective occupancy rates\n23   for the years to come, the court found even the periodic payments\n24   during the seven-year period would likely be infeasible.\n25        Finally, the bankruptcy court found that the Amended\n26   Reorganization Plan was not fair and equitable.   The court found\n27   that the cash payments to the Bank contemplated by the Amended\n28   Reorganization Plan would not equal the present value of the\n\n                                      9\n\f 1   Medical Center.   Moreover, the court found that the Amended\n 2   Reorganization Plan ran afoul of the absolute priority rule,\n 3   which precludes equity holders from retaining their equity unless\n 4   all creditors are paid in full.    And since Dr. Abelson and\n 5   Mr. Patel would provide only a contingent guaranty, the court\n 6   found this provision insufficient to trigger the new value\n 7   exception to the absolute priority rule.\n 8        2.   Confirmation of the Liquidation Plan\n 9        Although the class of equity holders was deemed to have\n10   rejected the Liquidation Plan, the bankruptcy court determined\n11   that it could be confirmed under the “cramdown” provision of\n12   § 1129(b)(1).   The court rejected Horizon Ridge’s arguments that\n13   the Liquidation Plan was insufficiently specific as to the nature\n14   of the proposed liquidation sale, the assets to be sold and the\n15   identity of the plan administrator.    Horizon Ridge also objected\n16   on the ground that the Liquidation Plan failed to provide for\n17   assumption or rejection of the leases of the Medical Center’s\n18   tenants, but the court concluded that this failure was not fatal\n19   under applicable law, as the leases would ride through the\n20   confirmation process.\n21        On three points, however, the bankruptcy court made\n22   confirmation conditional on amendments to the Liquidation Plan.\n23   First, the court required the Bank to amend the plan to provide\n24   for payment in full of unsecured claims on the effective date of\n25   the plan, rather than the closing date of the proposed\n26   liquidation sale.   Second, the court required the Bank to remove\n27   a paragraph providing for exculpation of the Bank, as such\n28   provisions “cannot be permitted to stand” under Ninth Circuit\n\n                                       10\n\f 1   law.    Finally, the court took issue with a provision in the\n 2   Liquidation Plan that would have permitted the plan administrator\n 3   to review and approve administrative claims.      This “attempt[] to\n 4   overreach and have [the] Plan Administrator assume the court’s\n 5   duties under the code” would also have to be removed.      The Bank\n 6   complied with the court’s requirements by filing an amended\n 7   Liquidation Plan.\n 8   D.   Postconfirmation events and Gordon Silver’s fees\n 9          After the Liquidation Plan was confirmed, the litigation\n10   between the Bank and Horizon Ridge continued.      Horizon Ridge\n11   opposed the Bank’s proposed procedures for conducting the\n12   liquidation sale contemplated by the Liquidation Plan.      The sale\n13   itself apparently was contentious as well, with two entities,\n14   including one newly organized by Dr. Abelson, bidding cash\n15   against the Bank’s escalating credit bids.      The Bank’s winning\n16   credit bid of $4,420,000 exceeded the previously determined value\n17   of Horizon Ridge’s assets.    Horizon Ridge appealed a total of\n18   five orders of the bankruptcy court relating to confirmation and\n19   the sale.    Though Horizon Ridge sought stays pending appeal,\n20   these were denied.    The five appeals have been dismissed.\n21          On July 14, 2014, nearly two years after its employment had\n22   been approved, Gordon Silver filed a final application for\n23   payment of its fees and expenses (“Fee Application”).      The Fee\n24   Application sought final approval of payment to Gordon Silver in\n25   the total amount of $512,741.30.      The Bank objected to the Fee\n26   Application, renewing its argument that Gordon Silver had been\n27   working solely for the benefit of Dr. Abelson and Mr. Patel,\n28   rather than the estate.    The Bank did not object to the\n\n                                      11\n\f 1   reasonableness of any particular entry in Gordon Silver’s billing\n 2   itemization.\n 3        The bankruptcy court held two hearings on the Fee\n 4   Application.   At the first of these hearings (the “First Fee\n 5   Hearing”), the court heard argument from Gordon Silver and the\n 6   Bank’s counsel.   Gordon Silver argued that the Bank was obligated\n 7   by its own Liquidation Plan to pay administrative expenses and\n 8   that Gordon Silver’s rates and billing were reasonable.   At this\n 9   point, the bankruptcy court commented that reasonableness of\n10   rates was not at issue:\n11        THE COURT: Well, I don’t think [the Bank’s attorney]\n          Mr. Weiss’s objection is that your rates were\n12        unreasonable. I think Mr. Weiss’s objection was that\n          you did a lot of work that benefitted –- potentially\n13        benefitted the principal of the debtor as opposed to\n          the debtor itself.\n14\n          MS. KOZLOWSKI: Fair enough. And really that comes\n15        down to the reasonableness, reasonably likely to\n          benefit the estate prong.\n16\n17   After argument and colloquy, primarily related to this issue, the\n18   bankruptcy court concluded the hearing and scheduled an\n19   additional hearing (the “Second Fee Hearing”), at which the court\n20   would announce its decision.\n21        At the Second Fee Hearing, the bankruptcy court stated on\n22   the record that it would approve Gordon Silver’s fees in full.\n23   The court elaborated:\n24        . . . I think it’s unfortunate that we had what started\n          out as an under $200,000 fight but has led to I think\n25        in excess of a million and a half dollars in attorneys’\n          fees. But both parties have to participate in the\n26        fight. If the bank pushes back, the debtor gets to\n          push back. . . .\n27\n          . . . .\n28\n\n                                     12\n\f 1        I was a little surprised . . . [that the Bank] bid\n          actual money for –- at the time of the sale and overbid\n 2        certain other bids, which would have [paid the Bank’s\n          allowed claims] in full.\n 3\n          But I don’t think there is anything wrong with the fees\n 4        of Gordon Silver. I think the fees –- as I understand\n          it, the fees of the bank are in excess of a million\n 5        dollars. . . .\n 6        The work that was done by both sides was good. I think\n          it’s unfortunate that the parties were not able to\n 7        resolve this at some lesser sum. But as I indicated,\n          the debtor is allowed to pursue their positions, the\n 8        bank is allowed to pursue their positions, and in this\n          case it led to a great deal of money being expended.\n 9\n          I am going to approve Gordon Silver’s fees in total.\n10        The general objection was that they weren’t reasonable.\n          I think in the context of the case, they were\n11        reasonable.\n12        Following the Fee Hearing, the bankruptcy court entered an\n13   order granting the Fee Application (“Fee Order”).     In the Fee\n14   Order, the bankruptcy court noted that it had “considered the\n15   oral argument presented [at the First Fee Hearing]” and “stated\n16   its findings of fact and conclusions of law on the record at [the\n17   Second Fee Hearing].”   The court ordered that the Fee Application\n18   was approved and that Gordon Silver’s fees were incurred for\n19   services “necessary and beneficial to the estate.”\n20        This timely appeal of the Fee Order followed.\n21                            II.    JURISDICTION\n22        The bankruptcy court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.\n23   §§ 1334 and 157(b)(2)(A).      We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.\n24   § 158.\n25                               III.    ISSUES\n26        1.   Whether the bankruptcy court identified and applied the\n27   correct legal standard to its ruling on the Fee Application.\n28        2.   Whether the bankruptcy court’s findings of fact in\n\n                                        13\n\f 1   connection with the Fee Order were clearly erroneous.\n 2                          IV.

DISCUSSION\n16   A.   What is the proper legal standard?\n17        Before we can determine whether the bankruptcy court applied\n18   the proper legal standard in evaluating the Fee Application, we\n19   must determine what that standard is.\n20        Compensation of professionals is governed by §§ 327 and 330.\n21   Section 327 provides for “reasonable compensation for actual,\n22   necessary services” and “reimbursement for actual, necessary\n23   expenses.”    Section 330(a)(3), in turn, requires the bankruptcy\n24   court to consider “all relevant factors” in determining\n25   reasonableness of compensation, including the following:\n26        (A) the time spent on such services;\n27        (B) the rates charged for such services;\n28        (C) whether the services were necessary to the\n\n                                         14\n\f 1         administration of, or beneficial at the time at which\n           the service was rendered toward the completion of, a\n 2         case under this title;\n 3         (D) whether the services were performed within a\n           reasonable amount of time commensurate with the\n 4         complexity, importance, and nature of the problem,\n           issue, or task addressed; and\n 5\n           (E) whether the compensation is reasonable based on the\n 6         customary compensation charged by comparably skilled\n           practitioners other than in cases under this title.\n 7\n 8   11 U.S.C. § 330(a)(3)(A)-(E).    Expressly excluded from\n 9   compensation are services that are not “reasonably likely to\n10   benefit the debtor’s estate” or “necessary to the administration\n11   of the case.”    11 U.S.C. § 330(a)(4)(A).

N.D. Tex. 1988) (compensation reduced for\n18   attorneys’ services in proposing a plan “inexplicably generous to\n19   stockholders” where “substantial documentary evidence” showed\n20   that attorneys in fact represented equity holders).\n21        We agree that debtors’ attorneys may not be compensated by\n22   the estate for services rendered entirely for the benefit of\n23   principals or other non-debtor parties, because such services are\n24   not “reasonably likely to benefit the debtor’s estate.”\n25   11 U.S.C. § 330(a)(4).   In exercising “reasonable billing\n26   judgment,” the first question an attorney must consider is\n27   whether “the burden of the probable cost of legal services [is]\n28   disproportionately large in relation to the size of the estate\n\n                                       16\n\f 1   and maximum probable recovery.”    In re Garcia, 335 B.R. at 724.\n 2   Because the attorney is employed by the estate, it necessarily\n 3   follows that the attorney must consider the “burden” and the\n 4   “maximum probable recovery” to the estate.\n 5   B.   Did the bankruptcy court apply the correct standard?\n 6        The Bank argues that the bankruptcy court failed to apply\n 7   the proper legal standard in its findings and conclusions made in\n 8   connection with the Fee Order.    More specifically, the Bank\n 9   argues that, although the court stated at the Second Fee Hearing\n10   that Gordon Silver’s fees were “reasonable,” it “did not consider\n11   the identity of Gordon Silver’s true client.”\n12        Although it is true that the bankruptcy court did not frame\n13   its oral findings and conclusions in terms of “the identity of\n14   Gordon Silver’s true client,” a review of the transcript of the\n15   First Fee Hearing leaves no doubt that the court “consider[ed]”\n16   the issue of whose interests were furthered by Gordon Silver’s\n17   services.   During Gordon Silver’s oral argument, the bankruptcy\n18   court specifically redirected the discussion to that very issue,\n19   which discussion dominated most of the 22-minute hearing.    As\n20   noted above, the “true client” issue is part of the broader\n21   question of whether services are “reasonably likely to benefit\n22   the debtor’s estate.”   By making findings and conclusions in\n23   Gordon Silver’s favor following extensive briefing and oral\n24   argument primarily devoted to that issue, the bankruptcy court\n25   made it clear that it had considered and rejected the Bank’s\n26   argument.   The bankruptcy court’s comments that “if the bank\n27   pushes back, the debtor gets to push back” and that “the debtor\n28   is allowed to pursue [its] positions” further demonstrate that\n\n                                       17\n\f 1   the court found Gordon Silver’s litigation activities to have\n 2   been conducted on behalf of the debtor, Horizon Ridge, rather\n 3   than Dr. Abelson and Mr. Patel.\n 4        The language of the Fee Order itself provides additional\n 5   support for this conclusion.   In the Fee Order, the bankruptcy\n 6   court stated that its decision followed consideration of the oral\n 7   argument presented at the First Fee Hearing.      The Fee Order went\n 8   on to recite that Gordon Silver’s services were “necessary and\n 9   beneficial to the estate.”\n10        We conclude that the bankruptcy court applied the proper\n11   legal standard.\n12   C.   Did the bankruptcy court clearly err in its findings?\n13        Having concluded that the bankruptcy court applied the\n14   correct standard, we must affirm unless we conclude its findings\n15   “were illogical, implausible or without support in inferences\n16   that may be drawn from facts in the record.”      Hinkson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">585</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">17</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">   at 1262.   On this record, we cannot so conclude.\n18        The Bank concedes that Gordon Silver’s efforts were\n19   reasonably likely to benefit the estate from the commencement of\n20   its employment to the moment the bankruptcy court determined that\n21   the value of the Medical Center was less than the amount of the\n22   Bank’s allowed claims.   After that point, the Bank argues, it was\n23   established conclusively that equity holders had no legitimate\n24   interest in continuing the fight.      Thus, to extend this\n25   reasoning, since the unsecured creditors expressed no preference\n26   between the Liquidation Plan and the Reorganization Plan, the\n27   only interested party left standing was the Bank, whose interests\n28   became paramount.   By this logic, anything Gordon Silver did that\n\n                                       18\n\f 1   was adversarial toward the Bank was necessarily not in the best\n 2   interests of the estate.   The bankruptcy court was not required\n 3   to accept this narrow definition of the estate’s interests.\n 4        As the bankruptcy court noted at the Second Fee Hearing,\n 5   both the Bank and Horizon Ridge vigorously pursued their\n 6   respective litigation positions at enormous expense rather than\n 7   “resolv[ing] this at some lesser sum.”   Although the Bank\n 8   prevailed both at the Confirmation Hearing and in most of the\n 9   postconfirmation disputes, it does not follow that the bankruptcy\n10   court clearly erred in finding that Gordon Silver’s fees were\n11   reasonable “in the context of the case.”   Granted, Gordon Silver\n12   billed a large proportion of its fees in connection with its\n13   efforts to confirm a plan that ultimately was found to be\n14   unconfirmable and not proposed in good faith.   Nevertheless,\n15   nothing in the record compelled the bankruptcy court to find that\n16   the project was hopeless or that Gordon Silver’s services were\n17   not reasonably likely to confer a benefit on the estate, whether\n18   in the form of a confirmable plan or a consensual resolution\n19   between the Bank and Horizon Ridge.\n20        Indeed, as the bankruptcy court commented at the First Fee\n21   Hearing, the sale price of the Medical Center was significantly\n22   higher than its value as previously determined by the court.\n23   This fact lends support to the proposition that, at the time\n24   Gordon Silver rendered its services, it was not unreasonable to\n25   expect that Horizon Ridge could propose a confirmable\n26   reorganization plan or achieve a consensual resolution.\n27   Notwithstanding the fact that these happy outcomes did not occur,\n28   there was sufficient evidence in the record before the bankruptcy\n\n                                     19\n\f 1   court to support the finding that the services were “reasonably\n 2   likely to benefit the estate at the time rendered.”\n 3   In re Garcia, 335 B.R. at 724.\n 4                               VI.   CONCLUSION\n 5        Based upon the foregoing, we conclude that the bankruptcy\n 6   court did not abuse its discretion in approving the Fee\n 7   Application.   We AFFIRM.\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n\n                                        20\n\f</pre>",
