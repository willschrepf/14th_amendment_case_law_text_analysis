The sale was part of an Internal\nRevenue Code (Title 26) section 1031 (section 1031) transaction to defer the buyer’s\ncapital gain tax on the buyer’s sale of another property. The buyer had the money\npayable on his sale of the other property deposited in a segregated account with a section\n1031 qualified exchange intermediary (section 1031 intermediary).1 On the Monday after\nthe sale had been scheduled to close, the section 1031 intermediary closed and then filed\nfor bankruptcy. The bankruptcy court did not release the buyer’s money until after it was\ntoo late legally to qualify for deferral of taxes under section 1031.\n       A jury found the seller and the escrow company at fault for the escrow not closing\non time—i.e., on Friday—and awarded the buyer damages against the seller for the delay,\nincluding the loss of the tax benefits. The jury also found the escrow company liable for\nbreach of fiduciary duty and awarded the buyer damages against the escrow company for\nlosses resulting from the delay in the closing of escrow.\n       We reverse in part because, as discussed in the published portion of the opinion,\n(a) there was insufficient evidence the contract damages assessed against the seller based\non the bankruptcy were foreseeable and (b), as to the escrow company, the trial court\nfailed to instruct the jury on an intervening and superseding cause—the bankruptcy.\n\n\n\n\n1\n       See Department of Treasury Internal Revenue Service Regulations: IRC section\n1031, “Definition of Qualified Intermediary,” Preamble to Regulations: Deferred\nExchange R.23; section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4) R.34.\n\n                                              2\n\f                                FACTUAL BACKGROUND2\n         Plaintiff David Ash as trustee of the David Ash Trust (Ash), in connection with his\nsale of commercial real estate that realized a taxable gain, desired to defer the capital gain\ntax under section 10313 by purchasing commercial property from defendant Lerner.4 On\nOctober 8, 2008, Ash and Lerner entered into an agreement by which Lerner agreed to\nsell to Ash commercial property. Defendant North American Title Company (NAT) was\nselected to be the escrow company for the purchase, for which escrow opened shortly\nthereafter, and was scheduled to close on November 21, 2008—the “expected closing\ndate.”\n         Ash was in the real estate business, and, after talking to different brokers, selected\nLandAmerica Exchange Services (LandAmerica) to receive proceeds from the sale of his\nproperty in order to comply with section 1031.5 When he entered into the agreement\n\n2\n       We do not state in detail the facts concerning the liability of the defendants\nbecause the issues in the published portion of this opinion involve damages and jury\ninstructions.\n3\n        “Under section 1031, no taxable gain or loss is recognized on the exchange of\nproperties of like kind if both the property surrendered and the property received are held\neither ‘for productive use in a trade or business or for investment.’ (26 U.S.C.\n§ 1031(a)(1).) This section ‘allows taxpayers with profitable real estate investments to\nswap them for other real estate without paying tax.’ (2 Greenwald & Asimow, Cal.\nPractice Guide: Real Property Transactions (The Rutter Group 2009) ¶ 13:305.1, p. 13-\n58 (rev. #1, 2009).” (Sharabianlou v. Karp (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 1133, 1140, fn. 5.)\n4\n       The defendants were Richard and Gloria Lerner, as trustees of the Exemption\nTrust of the Lerner Family Trust dated November 17, 1986. Also referred to as\ndefendants and owners of the property are Richard and Gloria Lerner, as trustees of the\nRay Learner Irrevocable Trust dated December 30, 1992. They are collectively referred\nto as Lerner.\n5\n        Ash originally said he was going to use TIMCOR as an intermediary, “and I think\nWAMU [Washington Mutual] bought them or something happened, and both of them\ndisappeared or went bankrupt or something. . . . I’m not sure if they went out of business\nor if they were bought out by Washington Mutual and then Washington Mutual closed\nthem down and then went out of business. But somehow, it was all lumped together,\nfrom what I know, or what I was told.”\n\n                                                3\n\fwith LandAmerica, he had no concerns about its “financial viability.” He chose\nLandAmerica based on “the opinion of the [p]eople [he] spoke to about it.” When asked\nif he was “scared to lose [his] money if he got into a 1031 exchange,” he responded “no.”\nAsh was told LandAmerica had various branches and was part of LandAmerica\nCommercial Services. Ash had used LandAmerica for another replacement property.\n       At some point during the escrow period after the purchase and escrow agreements\nwere executed, Ash had concerns, “I was afraid of the whole industry everywhere . . . the\nbanking system was, like, collapsing at the time. So -- I also needed income. So I\nwanted to do something as quick as possible to get my income and also to be protected.”\nHe had nevertheless chosen to use LandAmerica, signing the papers on November 13,\n2008, over a month after escrow opened, although the paperwork with LandAmerica was\ndated as of October 9, 2008. He later said that near the closing date he was worried about\nhis money because he wanted the income: “I wanted to get it done.” Ash had told NAT\nthat he needed the income from the property he purchased to have the escrow completed\nbecause he wanted to have his funds safely reinvested. Ash never said he was concerned\nat any time specifically about the financial condition of LandAmerica.\n       Under section 1031, in order to defer paying the capital gains tax on the sale of his\nother property, Ash was required to close his transaction with Lerner within 180 days of\nthe sale of Ash’s property.6 Ash had the proceeds from the sale of his property on which\nthe escrow had closed deposited with LandAmerica, using an account at Citibank. This\nwas a segregated account that paid a lower interest rate than an account that pooled\nmoney from other investors. Ash verified that the funds were in the Citibank account.\n       Neither Lerner nor NAT had any involvement with the selection of LandAmerica.\nAs noted, the escrow was to close on Friday, November 21, 2008, but it was anticipated\n\n\n6\n       The property being purchased must be identified within 45 days after the sale, and\nthe purchase must take place within 180 days of the sale. (Title 26 U.S.C. § 1031(a)(3).)\nUp to three potential properties may be identified. (Title 26 U.S.C. § 1031(a)(3).)\nSection 1031 can be simply a deferral of the capital gains tax if the taxpayer later sells the\nproperty he or she acquired.\n\n\n                                              4\n\fby both defendants that the escrow would take a few more days to close. When so\ninformed, Ash responded, “no problem do I get a discount[] (jk) [just kidding]. Thank\nyou!!” Ash’s response expressed no concern about the status of LandAmerica. On\nMonday, November 24, 2008, LandAmerica froze all of its accounts, including\nsegregated accounts, and then filed for bankruptcy.\n      Ash’s real estate broker was aware of LandAmerica and the number of people who\nused it. He believed it was a “very substantial company” and a “very large company”\nand knew of its affiliated companies. He said he told Ash it was a reputable company.\nAsh’s broker said he too was “shocked” and “everybody was shocked” when\nLandAmerica closed its doors. Ash had expressed no concerns to Lerner or to NAT\nabout the financial solvency of LandAmerica. The escrow officer at NAT who had\nworked with LandAmerica had no concerns about the solvency of LandAmerica prior to\nthe bankruptcy. She said she was “shocked” upon hearing LandAmerica had closed.\n      Ash’s expert, who once worked for LandAmerica, said it was “unusual,”\n“alarming,” and “unique” that LandAmerica closed its doors. She added that escrow\nholders would not get information about rumors concerning a section 1031 qualified\nintermediary, and if they did, they would not necessarily inform the principals to escrow\naccounts of such rumors. She could not say that any such rumors about LandAmerica\nwere generally known by people in the real estate industry in Southern California. There\nis no evidence that Ash, and more importantly defendants, were aware of any such\nrumors about LandAmerica. The real estate agents involved, in addition to the escrow\nofficer for NAT, said they were “shocked” and surprised about LandAmerica’s\nbankruptcy. A LandAmerica employee handling the matter said she had been involved in\n5000 or more section 1031 exchanges and apparently had no warning of an impending\nLandAmerica bankruptcy. That LandAmerica employee said, “There was never any\ndoubt until 9:00 a.m. on the morning of November 24 [the date the business closed] that\nthe money would be available.” She added that the event was so traumatic that it was\neven worse than the death of her father—“worse than anything”; “absolutely beyond\ndescription.” She added, “everybody [at LandAmerica] was very angry and couldn’t\n\n                                            5\n\funderstand how it could happen.” Another LandAmerica employee said she had no\nawareness of any financial problems with LandAmerica. Ash’s real estate agent, who\nhad been in the industry for more than 35 years and involved with section 1031\nexchanges, said this was the first one in which a qualified intermediary failed to fund the\nescrow. 7 Despite Ash’s hopes and the fact that the money was in a segregated account,\nthe bankruptcy court refused to allow depositors, including Ash, to have access to their\ndeposited monies.\n       Ash did not cancel the transaction because he was concerned he might lose his\ndeposits and would be unable to complete the tax-deferred exchange. He continued to\npay interest on the bank loan he had taken out to purchase the property without the\nincome from the property to use for loan payments. The bank required Ash to repay the\nloan after five months because there was no deed of trust recorded to secure the loan.\nWithout income from the property, he was required to borrow money from his mother.\nHe also needed to hire an attorney to attempt to convince the bankruptcy court to release\nhis money in order to complete the transaction.\n       The escrow did not close until March 2010, after the bankruptcy court finally\nreleased Ash’s funds. The closing of escrow was too late for Ash to obtain the section\n1031 tax deferral of his capital gain taxes.8\n\n\n\n\n7\n         LandAmerica apparently failed because it invested its funds in auction rate\nsecurities, the market for which collapsed in February of 2008. (See Funk, So You\nThought Your Proceeds Belong To You? The Interplay Between Like-Kind Exchanges\nUnder the Tax and Bankruptcy Codes (2011) 25 No. 2 Prac. Tax Law 43, 50-51 (Funk).\nThe Chief Operating Officer of LandAmerica told “everybody how great everything was\n. . . and that he had no idea there was a bankruptcy imminent.” He added that the\n“mother company” “had promised to, if necessary, buy those securities to make the\naccommodator [1031 intermediary] liquid.” He also said that the “mother company” had\nguaranteed the accommodator funds.\n8\n       Ash, nevertheless, on his tax return treated his sale of property as nontaxable, and\nthen later amended the return to show the gain.\n\n\n                                                6\n\f       As a result of the delayed escrow and the delay in recovering his funds resulting\nfrom the bankruptcy, Ash sued Lerner and NAT for damages, including Ash’s legal\nexpenses of $140,000 incurred in the bankruptcy proceeding and tax liability of $465,000\ndue to the failure of the section 1031 exchange. Additionally, Ash claimed $166,000 in\nincome from the property if the sale had been timely completed, payments to the lender\nof $42,000, $189,000 paid for a new loan above what he would have paid for the original\nloan that was terminated by the original lender, and $28,000 of interest on a loan to meet\nexpenses. These direct damages totaled $1,033,000.9 Ash also sought indirect damages\nof $1 million attributed to his loss of cash flow to retain and purchase properties.\n       Defendants’ made motions for nonsuit based on a lack of causation and the\ndefense of intervening and superseding cause. The trial court denied the motions and\nrefused to give defendants’ proposed instructions on causation and intervening/\nsuperseding cause.\n       The jury returned its verdict finding that Lerner breached its contract by delaying\nthe timely close of escrow, and was liable to Ash for $300,000, and that NAT breached\nits contract with Ash to provide proper and timely escrow and title services and was\nliable for $250,000 in contract damages. The jury also found that NAT was liable for\nnegligence in the amount of $500,000 and for $250,000 for breach of fiduciary duty. The\njury imposed punitive damages on NAT in the amount of $750,000. The trial court\ngranted NAT’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to the punitive\ndamage award, but otherwise denied the motions for new trial and judgment\nnotwithstanding the verdict. Lerner and NAT timely appealed. Ash cross-appealed in\nconnection with the punitive damages.\n\n\n\n\n9\n       The $3,000 discrepancy is due to rounding off some figures by the expert.\n\n                                              7\n\f                                       DISCUSSION\n\n\n       A.     Standard of Review\n\n\n       The determinations of whether there was a breach of contract and whether the\ncontract damages are foreseeable are questions of fact (Plut v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co.\n(2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 98, 105-106; Sun-Maid Raisin Growers v. Victor Packing Co.\n(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 787, 790; Porter v. Arthur Murray, Inc. (1967) 249 Cal.App.2d\n410, 421;) and are governed by the substantial evidence test (Garlock Sealing\nTechnologies, LLC v. NAK Sealing Technologies Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 937,\n955-956; Lenk v. Total-Western, Inc. (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 959, 968)—i.e. whether\nthere is substantial evidence to support the findings of the trier of fact. “‘Substantial\nevidence . . . is not synonymous with “any” evidence. Instead, it is “‘substantial proof of\nthe essentials which the law requires.’”’ [Citation.]” (Roddenberry v. Roddenberry\n(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 634, 651.) We view the evidence in the light most favorable to\nthe prevailing party and draw all reasonable inferences and resolve all conflicts in its\nfavor. (Hub City Solid Waste Services, Inc. v. City of Compton (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th\n1114, 1128-1129.) Regarding whether the failure to give an instruction on intervening\nand superseding cause was error, we use the de novo standard of review. (Collins v.\nNavistar, Inc. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 1486, 1500.)\n\n\n       B.     Damages Against Lerner and NAT for Breach of\n              Contract—Forseeability\n\n\n       “Contract damages are generally limited to those within the contemplation of the\nparties when the contract was entered into or at least reasonably foreseeable by them at\nthat time; consequential damages beyond the expectations of the parties are not\nrecoverable. [¶] In contrast, tort damages are awarded to compensate the victim for\ninjury suffered. [Citation.] ‘For the breach of an obligation not arising from contract, the\n\n                                              8\n\fmeasure of damages . . . is the amount which will compensate for all the detriment\nproximately caused thereby, whether it could have been anticipated or not.’ (Civ. Code,\n§ 3333.)” (Applied Equipment Corp. v. Litton Saudi Arabia Ltd. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 503,\n515-516.)\n       The court in Lewis Jorge Construction Management, Inc. v. Pomona Unified\nSchool Dist. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 960, 969 (Lewis Jorge) discussed this principle, pointing\nout that California follows the common law rule set forth by an English court in Hadley\nv. Baxendale (1854) 156 Eng.Rep. 145. In that venerable English case, a shaft in\nHadley’s mill broke rendering the mill inoperable. Hadley contracted with Baxendale to\ntransport the shaft to an engineer to make a duplicate. Hadley told Baxendale the shaft\nshould be sent immediately, and Baxendale promised to have it delivered the next day.\nBaxendale did not know the mill would be inoperable until the new shaft arrived.\nBaxendale did not transport the shaft in the promised time, causing the mill to be shut\ndown for an additional five days. Hadley sued, inter alia, for lost profits resulting from\nthe delay. The court held that although a plaintiff is entitled to an amount that will place\nit in the same position it would have been had the breaching party performed, damages\nfor special circumstances, such as in that case, can be assessed against the breaching\nparty only when they were within the contemplation of both parties as a probable\nconsequence of a breach. Baxendale did not know that the mill would be shut down and\nwould remain shut until the new shaft arrived. Loss of profits could not fairly or\nreasonably have been contemplated by both parties without Hadley having communicated\nthe special circumstances to Baxendale. Thus, the court, in reversing the judgment, held\nthat lost profits could not be awarded to Hadley. (Id. at p. 152.)\n       The court in Lewis Jorge, supra, 34 Cal.4th at pages 969 through 970 added,\n“Hadley did not expressly distinguish between general and special damages. But such a\ndistinction flows naturally from that case; hence the rule that a party assumes the risk of\nspecial damages liability for unusual losses arising from special circumstances only if it\nwas ‘advised of the facts concerning special harm which might result’ from breach—it is\nnot deemed to have assumed such additional risk, however, simply by entering into the\n\n                                              9\n\fcontract. [Citations.] [¶] The Hadley rule has long been applied by California courts,\nwhich view it as having been incorporated into California Civil Code section 3300’s\ndefinition of the damages available for breach of a contract. [Citations.] Contract\ndamages, unlike damages in tort (Civ. Code, § 3333), do not permit recovery for\nunanticipated injury. [Citation.] Parties may voluntarily assume the risk of liability for\nunusual losses, but to do so they must be told, at the time the contract is made, of any\nspecial harm likely to result from a breach [citations]. Alternatively, the nature of the\ncontract or the circumstances in which it is made may compel the inference that the\ndefendant should have contemplated the fact that such a loss would be ‘the probable\nresult’ of the defendant’s breach. [Citation.] Not recoverable as special damages are\nthose ‘beyond the expectations of the parties.’ [Citation.] Special damages for breach of\ncontract are limited to losses that were either actually foreseen [citation] or were\n‘reasonably foreseeable’ when the contract was formed. [Citation.]” (See Erlich v.\nMenezes (1999) 21 Cal.4th 543, 550; Greenwich S.F., LLC v. Wong (2010) 190\nCal.App.4th 739, 760 [special damages not foreseeable as a matter of law]; see also\nCalifornia Press Mfg. Co. v. Stafford Packing Co. (1923) 192 Cal. 479, 483.) In III\nFarnsworth on Contracts (3d ed. 2004) section 12.14, pages 260 to 262 (Farnsworth), the\nauthor sets forth the criteria for foreseeability in part as follows: “foreseeability is to be\ndetermined as of the time of the making of the contract”; “what must be foreseeable is\nonly that the loss would result if the breach occurred”; “it is foreseeability only by the\nparty in breach that is determinative”; “foreseeability has an objective character”; and\n“the loss need only have been foreseeable as a probable, as opposed to a necessary or\ncertain, result of the breach.”\n       The instant case is governed by the Hadley v. Baxendale, supra, 156 Eng.Rep. 145\nprinciple adopted by our Supreme Court. To the extent any part of the $250,000 of\ndamages for the breaches of contract by Lerner and NAT is attributable to expenses\nincurred in connection with the bankruptcy and the loss of the deferral of the capital gains\ntax, such damages are not general damages, i.e., those “‘which, in the ordinary course of\nthings, would be likely to result’” from the breach (Civ. Code, § 3300) and which “flow\n\n                                              10\n\fdirectly and necessarily from a breach of contract, or that are a natural result of a\nbreach” and are within the contemplation of the parties. (Lewis Jorge, supra, 34 Cal.4th\nat p. 968.) Rather, they “are secondary or derivative losses arising from circumstances\nthat are particular to the contract or to the parties.” (Ibid.) These “[s]pecial damages are\nrecoverable if the special or particular circumstances from which they arise were actually\ncommunicated to or known by the breaching party (a subjective test) or were matters of\nwhich the breaching party should have been aware at the time of contracting (an objective\ntest).” (Id. at pp. 968-969.) Moreover, “[s]pecial damages ‘will not be presumed from\nthe mere breach’ but represent loss that ‘occurred by reason of injuries following from’\nthe breach. [Citation.]” (Id. at p. 969.)\n       Because counsels’ arguments to the jury are not evidence, we look to the\ntestimony of the witnesses and the documents introduced as exhibits to assess the\nforeseeability of the bankruptcy. There is no evidence in the record that Ash\ncommunicated to Lerner or NAT at the time of contracting—the relevant time—or at\nanytime, that the bankruptcy of LandAmerica and indefinite freezing of segregated\naccounts could result from a short but untimely delay in the escrow closing. There is no\nevidence in the record, expert or otherwise, that Lerner or NAT knew or should have\nknown of this risk at the time of contracting or anytime. The transaction in issue took\nplace in the fall of 2008, during an economic recession. Evidence of the various events\nthat allegedly took place during 2008 and their timing is not in the record. There is no\nevidence as to what facts Lerner or NAT knew concerning those events. Whatever Ash’s\napprehensions were are irrelevant. Only the communications to or knowledge of Lerner\nand NAT are relevant to foreseeability.\n       Ash, even though ostensibly risk averse, having been in the real estate business\nand having consulted others in the business, chose the 1031 exchange intermediary and\npurportedly protected himself by having the proceeds of his sale deposited in a\nsegregated account. There is not substantial, if any, evidence that under these\ncircumstances, Ash was aware of any risk to the funds he placed in a segregated account,\nmuch less that he communicated any such risk to Lerner or NAT or that Lerner or NAT\n\n                                              11\n\fshould have known of any such risk. That Ash was not aware of any risk supports the\nposition that neither Lerner nor NAT was aware or should have been aware of any such\nrisk at the time of the contract.\n       The real estate brokers and agents involved, an escrow expert, and a LandAmerica\nemployee, all testified that they did not foresee any risk to the funds deposited with\nLandAmerica. Ash’s damages expert stated that what occurred is “a fairly rare\noccurrence” and is “fairly unusual.” Again, this evidence dispels any notion that Lerner\nor NAT were or should have foreseen the risk of bankruptcy. Lerner just wanted to sell\nhis property, and NAT was just the escrow company. Presumably, it did not matter to\nLerner or NAT whether the sale was part of a section 1031 exchange, other than the\nexchange was what motivated the buyer, Ash.\n       To suggest that Lerner and NAT should have known of the risk is speculation and\nnot based on any evidence. There is no evidence that the parties to the transaction were\nconcerned that the economy or other institutional failures created a risk to the funds\nplaced in a segregated account with LandAmerica. The evidence does not show that\nLandAmerica was part of purported banking system problems of which Ash was aware.\nHe had used LandAmerica for escrow and other services before. There is nothing in the\nrecord or even argued by Ash concerning the precise nature of economic conditions at the\ntime of the contract and how they might have impacted a section 1031 qualified\nintermediary such as LandAmerica, which is not a bank. There was no evidence that\nLerner and NAT knew or should have known at the time of contracting that if the escrow\ndid not close in time, the section 1031 qualified intermediary selected by Ash would or\ncould go bankrupt or that Ash would or might not be able to recover his funds in time to\nqualify for a tax deferral. The papers appointing LandAmerica to serve as a section 1031\nintermediary were signed over a month after the escrow opened. Thus, defendants did\nnot contemplate the LandAmerica bankruptcy or the consequences thereof.\n       That there is no evidence in the record that at the time of the contracts the\nbankruptcy of LandAmerica was reasonably foreseeable by any of the participants—most\nimportantly, Lerner and NAT—is consistent with the general view that bankruptcies\n\n                                             12\n\fnormally are not within the contemplation of the parties at the time of a contract. (See\nFiduciary Trust Co. v. Bingham Dana & Gould & Others (2003) 789 N.E.2d 171, 178\n[“plaintiffs offered nothing to refute or even to suggest Gaston’s bankruptcy was\nreasonably foreseeable . . . at the time” of defendant’s alleged malpractice]; Martin\nMarietta Corp. v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. (4th Cir. 1988) 852 F.2d 566, 570 [“financial\nruin of an apparently sound company is not normally a foreseeable consequence of those\nacts”]; Held Construction Co. v. Michigan National Bank of Detroit (Mich.App. 1983)\n335 N.W.2d 8, 10; In re Construction Diversification, Inc. (D.C. Mich. 1983) 36 B.R.\n434, 439 [bankruptcy damages not recoverable in breach of contract action absent bad\nfaith]; Howard v. Nicholson (Mo.App. 1977) 556 S.W.2d 477, 483 [“While the\npossibility of bankruptcy of businesses in general is a foreseeable and all-too-frequent\noccurrence, the future bankruptcy of a particular company, the continuing existence of\nwhich was essential to complete the entire transaction, was not reasonably within the\ncontemplation of the parties at the time of contracting such that the parties would have\nmade provision for such an event”].)10 As stated in one authoritative work, “[u]nless\nfinancial ruin is a consequence arising naturally from a breach of contract, damages\nsought by the nonbreaching party for financial ruin are not recoverable unless a risk of\ninsolvency was within the actual contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was\nmade.” (Henshaw and Kempflen, 7 Mich. Civ. Jur. Damages (2013) § 77.)\n       There are certain situations, unlike the one here, in which a bankruptcy is\nforeseeable if there is a breach of contract. For example, when a health maintenance\norganization improperly terminates a contract with a healthcare provider, it can expect\ndire financial consequences will arise for the latter. (See In re Doctors Health, Inc. v.\nNylcare Health Plans of the Mid-Atlantic, Inc. (D.Md. 2005) 335 B.R. 95, 121.) If the\nbreaching party breaches a contract to purchase stock when he knows of the other party’s\ndesperate financial need to sell the stock, a bankruptcy might be considered foreseeable.\n(See Hallmark v. Hand (Tex.App. 1992) 833 S.W.2d 603, 612.) When an insurer\n\n\n10\n       These cases appear to have decided the issue of foreseeability as a matter of law.\n\n                                             13\n\fwrongfully refuses to pay a claim, the adverse financial consequences can be foreseeable.\n(Cf. Reichert v. General Ins. Co. of America (1968) 68 Cal.2d 822 [issue not reached].)\nHere, there was no evidence the parties considered the bankruptcy of LandAmerica to be\na foreseeable consequence of any delay. As noted, Ash deposited the sums in a\nsegregated account with the understanding they would be safe. If he thought they were\nsafe, there was no reason to conclude that defendants nevertheless should have\ncontemplated that the deposit was unsafe.\n       Also, there was no evidence that Lerner or NAT had any knowledge at the time of\ncontracting of the possibility that a bankruptcy judge for such a lengthy period of time\nwould not release the money in a segregated account. Indeed, under the circumstances, it\nwas unforeseeable that a bankruptcy court would not release the funds in an account,\nespecially in a segregated account, in time to meet the requirements for a tax free\nexchange. (See Funk, supra, 25 No. 2 Prac. Tax Law 43; Roth et al., Committee\nEducational Session: Bankruptcy Taxation/Real Estate Lessons from LandAmerica: Who\nHas My Money? The Unexpected Perils of § 541, Dec. 1, 2011 American Bankruptcy\nInstitute 449 [“Outrage and Acrimony over the Court’s decision [in the LandAmerica\ncase]”]; Siegel v. Boston (In re Sale Guar. Corp.) (9th Cir. 1998) 220 B.R. 660, aff’d (9th\nCir. 2000) 199 F.3d 1375 [funds deposited in a separate trust account of qualified\nintermediary are not property of the bankruptcy estate].) Moreover, there was no\nevidence that defendants at the time of the contracts had knowledge that Ash would incur\nexpenses related to the bankruptcy.\n       As stated in Williston on Contracts, “If the contract is silent with respect to the\nrisks the defendant has assumed, the court will determine what risks were foreseen or\nforeseeable when the contract was made by viewing the matter in the light of common\nsense; and the courts will consider the nature and purpose of the contract, and the\nsurrounding circumstances known by the parties to exist at that time, as well as what the\nbreaching party may reasonably be supposed to have assumed consciously.” (24\nWilliston on Contracts (4th ed. 2013) § 64.13.) Because there was no evidence that the\nbankruptcy and bankruptcy judges’s refusal to release funds in a segregated account\n\n                                             14\n\fwere, at the time of the contracts, within the contemplation of the Lerner and NAT or that\nat those times they should have contemplated the probability of the result, the damages\narising from those events were not foreseeable for purposes of awarding contract\ndamages.\n       Accordingly, the trial court should reduce the contract damages judgment against\nLerner and NAT by amounts attributable to the bankruptcy and bankruptcy court’s delay\nin releasing the deposited funds. The matter is remanded for determination of damages\nnot attributable to the bankruptcy, including the legal fees in that proceeding and the\nbankruptcy court’s delay in releasing the funds.\n\n\n       C.     Intervening and Superseding Cause\n       The defendants invoked the tort defense of intervening and superseding cause, but\nthe trial court refused to instruct the jury on those defenses. A principle in tort law is that\nwhen “subsequent to the defendant’s negligent act, an independent intervening force\nactively operates to produce the injury, the chain of causation may be broken. It is\nusually said that if the risk of injury might have been reasonably foreseen, the defendant\nis liable, but that if the independent intervening act is highly unusual or extraordinary, not\nreasonably likely to happen and hence not foreseeable, it is a superseding cause, and the\ndefendant is not liable.” (6 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (10th ed 2005) Torts § 1197,\np. 574 and case cited therein.)\n       The Restatement Second of Torts distinguishes between “superseding cause” and\n“intervening force.” The Restatement Second of Torts, section 440, provides that “a\nsuperseding cause is an act of a third person or other force which by its intervention\nprevents the actor from being liable for harm to another which his antecedent negligence\nis a substantial factor in bringing about.” The Restatement Second of Torts, section 441,\nsubdivision (1) states, “An intervening force is one which actively operates in producing\nharm to another after the actor’s negligent act or omission has been committed.” Another\nauthority states, “An intervening act is regarded as a superseding cause when it is outside\nthe scope of the risk the defendant negligently created. This idea is usually expressed in\n\n                                              15\n\fshorthand by saying that if the intervening act is itself unforeseeable then it may become\na superseding cause.” (1 Dobbs et al., The Law of Torts (2d ed. 2013) § 212, p. 741\n(Dobbs).)\n        A superseding cause relieves a defendant from tort liability for a plaintiff’s\ninjuries, if both the intervening act and the results of the act are not foreseeable. “[W]hat\nis required to be foreseeable is the general character of the event or harm . . . not its\nprecise nature or manner of occurrence.” (Bigbee v. Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co. (1983) 34\nCal.3d 49, 57-58.) “Whether an intervening force is superseding or not generally\npresents a question of fact, but becomes a matter of law where only one reasonable\nconclusion may be reached. [Citation.]” (Chanda v. Federal Home Loans Corp. (2013)\n215 Cal.App.4th 746, 756; see also Perez v. VAS S.p.A. (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 658, 680-\n681.)\n        The defense of intervening and superseding cause applies in tort cases. In contract\ncases, the defense does not absolve the defendant of liability, although closely related is\nthe principle that if the special damages are not foreseeable and proximately caused by\nthe breach of contract they are not recoverable.11 As one authority has noted, “Breach\nmay not be precluded, however, by the presence of other contributing causes—multiple\nor intervening. Although the injured party’s own failure to avoid loss may bar recovery\nfor that loss, this is not thought of as a consequence of a requirement of causation but of a\nlimitation under a ‘mitigation’ rule.” (III Farnsworth, supra, at § 12.1, p. 151, fns.\nomitted.) Thus, the Lerners cannot invoke the defense of intervening and superseding\ncause applicable to torts because no tort claims were asserted against them.12\n\n11\n        See VerSteeg, Perspectives on Foreseeability in the Law of Contracts and Torts:\nThe Relationship Between “Intervening Causes” and “Impossibility” (2011) 2011 Mich.\nSt. L.Rev. 1497, 1510 (“The Contract doctrine that we typically label as ‘impossibility,\nimpracticability, frustration of purpose,’ or, as the Uniform Commercial Code refers to it,\n‘failure of presupposed conditions,’ and the Tort doctrine of ‘intervening and superseding\ncauses’ are actually one and the same”).\n12\n      See Schneider, Consequential Damages in the International Sale of Goods:\nAnalysis of Two Decisions (1995) 16 U. Pa. J. Int’l Bus. L. 615, § 2.2.4.1, fn. 74 (“When\n\n                                              16\n\f       Ash contends that the claims against NAT include an intentional tort, and\ntherefore the intervening and superseding act doctrine does not apply, as it applies only to\nNAT’s negligence. Ash asserts that so long as the intentional tort of breach of fiduciary\nduty was a substantial factor in causing the harm, NAT cannot escape liability even if\nthere were an intervening and superseding cause. (United States Fid. & Guar. Co. v.\nAmerican Employer’s Ins. Co. (1984) 159 Cal.App.3d 277, 285 [“‘[T]he notion of\nindependent intervening cause has no place in the law of intentional torts, so long as there\nis a factual chain of causation,’” quoting Tate v. Canonica (1960) 180 Cal.App.2d 898,\n907]; disapproved in other grounds in J.C. Penney Casualty Ins. Co. v. M.K. (1991) 52\nCal.3d 1009, 1019, fn. 8; Bank of New York v. Fremont General Corporation (9th Cir.\n2008) 523 F.3d 902, 910; Null v. City of Los Angeles (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 1528, 1535,\nfn. 6; Rest.2d Torts, §§ 435A, 435B; but see Brewer v. Teano (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th\n1024, 1036 [“This comes close to pleading an intentional tort. From that prospect, the\ndoctrine of superseding cause is less likely to cut off the chain of events put in motion by\nthe original conduct of the tortfeasor . . . even the ‘but for’ consequences of an intentional\ntort are not without limitation”]; Wright, Symposium, Baseline and Counterfactuals in\nthe Theory of Compensatory Damages: What Do Compensatory Damages Compensate?\n(2003) 40 San Diego L.Rev. 1425, 1478 [“The superseding cause limitation applies to all\ntort actions, including the intentional torts”].) Assuming, without deciding, that the\ndefense of intervening and superseding cause does not apply to any intentional tort, we\nmust examine the claim against NAT, which claim was breach of fiduciary duty.\n       “‘The elements of a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty are: (1) existence\nof a fiduciary duty; (2) breach of the fiduciary duty; and (3) damage proximately caused\n\n\na contract is breached or a tort committed, resulting losses or damages may not be caused\nby the actual breach or the tort itself, but rather by multiple or intervening causes . . . .\nSuch multiple or intervening causes are less likely to relieve a defendant from contractual\nliability than from tort liability”); III Farnsworth, supra, at section 12.1, page 151,\nfootnote 9 (“Although the same problems of multiple causes and of intervening causes\nthat enliven the law of torts also arise in connection with contract damages, they are\nrelatively less important than in the law of torts”).\n\n                                             17\n\fby the breach.’” (Gutierrez v. Girardi (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 925, 932.) The breach of\nfiduciary duty can be based upon either negligence or fraud depending on the\ncircumstances. (See Salahutdin v. Valley of California, Inc. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 555,\n563; see also Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. McSweeney (S.D. Cal. 1991) 772 F.Supp.\n1154, 1157.) It has been referred to as a species of tort distinct from causes of action for\nprofessional negligence (Slovensky v. Friedman (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1518, 1534) and\nfrom fraud (Salahutdin v. Valley of California, Inc., supra, 24 Cal.App.4th at p. 562).\n       The trial court instructed the jury as follows: “The Ash Trust claims that it was\nharmed by NATCO’S breach of the fiduciary duty to use reasonable care. To establish\nthis claim, the Ash Trust must prove all of the following: 1. That NATCO was the Ash\nTrust escrow holder; 2. That NATCO acted on the Ash Trust’s behalf for purposes of\npurchasing a commercial property; 3. That NATCO failed to act as a reasonably careful\nescrow holder would have acted under the same or similar circumstances; 4. That the Ash\nTrust was harmed; and 5. That NATCO’s conduct was a substantial factor in causing the\nAsh Trust’s harm.” The trial court did not instruct the jury that it was required to find the\nbreach of fiduciary duty to be intentional. And the trial court refused to instruct the jury\non constructive fraud.\n       As it appears that the breach of fiduciary duty might have arisen from negligence,\nthe intervening and superseding act doctrine could have been applicable. As suggested\nabove, there is a question as to whether the intervening and superseding act doctrine is\napplicable to intentional torts. And, as noted above, in Brewer v. Teano, supra, 40\nCal.App.4th at page 1036, the court said that the doctrine “is less likely to cut off the\nchain of events put in motion by the original conduct of the tortfeasor.”13 In Tate v.\n\n\n\n13\n        In Ventas, Inc. v. Health Care Prop. Investors, Inc. (W.D. Ky. 2009) 635\nF.Supp.2d 612, 624, the court predicted Kentucky law would apply the intervening and\nsuperseding cause doctrine to intentional torts, relying on a Kentucky comparative fault\nstatute that applied to both negligent and intentional torts. In California, comparative\nfault only applies to negligence causes of action. (People v. Brunette (2011) 194\nCal.App.4th 268, 282.) In Hibma v. Odegaard (7th Cir. 1985) 769 F.2d 1147, the court\n\n                                             18\n\fCanonica, supra, 180 Cal.App.2d at page 909, the court noted that the rule on an\nintervening and superseding act would apply “where the act of the defendant was\nintentionally done, but there was no intent to cause injury.” We do not have to decide\nwhether an intervening or superseding act can be a defense to an intentional tort because\nhere the trial court did not instruct the jury that in order to find a breach of fiduciary duty,\nit had to find that NAT intentionally breached its fiduciary duty.\n       Also, the intervening and superseding act itself need not necessarily be a negligent\nor intentional tort. For example, the culpability of the third person committing the\nintervening or superseding act is just one factor in determining if an intervening force is a\nnew and independent superseding cause. (Rest.2d Torts, § 442, subds. (e) and (f); see\nalso 1 Dobbs, supra, § 210, pp. 729-732 [acts of nature]; 4 Harper et al. on Torts (3d ed.\n2007) § 20.5, p. 179 [“extreme force”].)\n       Our Supreme Court has pointed out that “[a] tort is a legal cause of injury only\nwhen it is a substantial factor in producing the injury.” (Soule v. General Motors Corp.\n(1994) 8 Cal.4th 548, 572 (Soule).) As relevant here, the court added, “This principle is\ndistinct from the defense of ‘superseding cause,’ which absolves a tortfeasor, even though\nhis conduct was a substantial contributing factor, when an independent event intervenes\nin the chain of causation, producing harm of a kind and degree so far beyond the risk the\noriginal tortfeasor should have foreseen that the law deems it unfair to hold him\nresponsible. [Citations.] It is also distinct from the doctrine of ‘concurrent causes,’\nwhich holds that when two or more tortious acts combine, each contributing significantly\nto a single ultimate harm, each act is deemed a substantial and legal cause of injury,\nmaking each concurrent tortfeasor fully liable. [Citations.]” (Id. at p. 573, fn. 9.)\n       The trial court refused a proposed jury instruction on intervening and superseding\ncause (CACI No. 432), which instruction was based on NAT’s defense theory. A party is\nentitled to nonargumentative and correct instructions it requests on every theory\nadvanced by that party if the theory is supported by substantial evidence. (Soule, supra, 8\n\nheld that the deputy sheriffs who framed the plaintiff were not liable to the plaintiff for a\nsexual assault on the plaintiff by other prisoners.\n\n                                              19\n\fCal.4th at p. 572.) We review the evidence most favorable to the applicability of the\nrequested instruction, as a party is entitled to that instruction if that evidence could\nestablish the elements of the theory presented. (Scott v. Rayhrer (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th\n1535, 1540.) But “‘[a] judgment will not be reversed for error[] in jury instructions\nunless it appears reasonably probable that, absent the error, the jury would have rendered\na verdict more favorable to the appellant. [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (Ibid.)\n       NAT contended at trial that LandAmerica’s bankruptcy, the ensuing freezing of\nthe segregated account, and the bankruptcy court’s refusal to release the funds occurred\nafter NAT’s conduct caused Ash his damage and was highly unusual. NAT claimed it\nhad no reason to expect such occurrences, and the resulting harm was different than that\nwhich could be expected from NAT’s conduct. There was sufficient evidence that the\nbankruptcy constituted “an independent event [intervening] in the chain of causation,\nproducing harm of a kind and degree so far beyond the risk” (Soule, supra, 8 Cal.4th at p.\n573, fn. 9) that NAT should have foreseen, that the jury should have been given the\nintervening and superseding cause instruction. The failure to give that instruction\nconstituted error. (See id. at p. 573 and at fn. 10.)\n       Moreover, the error was prejudicial. The general instructions on causation do not\nrender the error harmless because the doctrine of intervening and superseding cause\nassumes that a defendant’s conduct was a substantial contributory factor—i.e. that there\nwas causation. (Soule, supra, 8 Cal.4th at p. 573, fn. 9.) The jury finding that NAT was\nresponsible for $250,000 as foreseeable contract damages suggests that the remaining\n$750,000 of Ash’s tort damages against NAT for negligence and breach of fiduciary duty\nwere not based on the contract standard of damages but on tort principles. As the jury\nwas not given an instruction on the defenses of intervening and superseding cause, it\ncould not properly consider whether NAT should be responsible for a tort or tort\ndamages. That NAT’s conduct was found to be wrongful does not determine whether an\nintervening and superseding event relieves NAT of liability. Had the jury been instructed\non intervening and superseding cause, it is reasonably probable that it would have come\nto a different result, for damages were caused by the bankruptcy proceedings—an\n\n                                              20\n\findependent event that caused a harm that could not be foreseen by NAT. (Soule, supra,\n8 Cal.4th at p. 573, fn. 9.)\n       This conclusion is evident from our determination that, in view of the evidentiary\npresentations in this case, the bankruptcy events were unusual and not reasonably\nforeseeable. “Since the court’s general instruction on causation did not go into the\ncircumstances of this particular case but dealt with the defense of superseding cause by\nnegative implication only, the jury may well have overlooked that defense in untangling\nthe issues and arriving at its verdict.” (Self v. General Motors Corp. (1974) 42\nCal.App.3d 1, 10 (overruled on other grounds in Soule, supra, 8 Cal.4th at p. 580).)\nMoreover, as the contract damages for the bankruptcy were not foreseeable, those\ndamages should not be invoked to render the instructional error harmless.\n\n\n               D.     Other Contentions\n       In view of our conclusions, we do not have to address many of the other\ncontentions by the parties.\n\n\n               1.     Accountant’s Testimony\n       Because of the decisions on foreseeability and intervening and superseding cause,\nwhether the accountant’s testimony on the transaction and damages was appropriate need\nnot be addressed.\n\n\n\n\n                                            21\n\f               2.    Special Instruction on Estoppel\n       NAT and Lerner contend that the trial court erred by refusing to give a special\ninstruction on estoppel based on Ash’s alleged acquiescence in the escrow delay. The\nelements of estoppel are that the party to be estopped must be aware of the facts, he must\nintend that his conduct be relied upon or acted on so that the other party should\nreasonably believe it was so intended, the other party must not know the true facts, and\nthe other party must rely on the conduct. (Longshore v. County of Ventura (1979) 25\nCal.3d 14, 28.) Estoppel may not be applied if any of these elements is missing. (Hair v.\nState of California (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 321, 328.) There was no evidence Lerner relied\non anything Ash said in this regard. Moreover, Ash did not know that NAT did not\nintend to follow his directions. Thus, there was no error in not giving an estoppel\ninstruction.\n\n\n               3.    Special Instruction on Causation\n       NAT and Lerner contend that the trial court erred by refusing to give their\nproposed instruction on speculative causation. The trial court correctly instructed the\njury that the breach must be a substantial factor in causing the damages and that the\ncausal occurrence be reasonably certain. (See US Ecology, Inc. v. State of California\n(2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 887, 909.) The intervening and superseding cause instruction\nthat should have been given as to NAT and the elimination of damages that are not\nforeseeable should cover Lerner’s and NAT’s contentions on this instruction.\n\n\n               4.    CACI No. 361 and Special Verdict\n       CACI No. 361 provides, “The Ash Trust has made claims against NATCO for\nbreach of contract; breach of fidiciary duty; and negligence. If you decide that the Ash\nTrust has proved all of . . . those claims, then the same damages that resulted from those\nclaims can be awarded only once.” Defendants claim this instruction along with the use\nof a special verdict form was error, citing Singh v. Southland Stone, U.S.A. Inc. (2010)\n186 Cal.App.4th 338, as well as the instruction to the jury not to total the damage award.\n\n                                            22\n\fBut defendants requested CACI No. 361 and did not object to the special verdict form.\nAny error in giving the instruction in the language of CACI No. 361 was invited\n(Transport Ins. Co. v. TIG Ins. Co. (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 984, 1000), and the failure to\nobject to the special verdict form was forfeited. Moreover, the damages awarded did not\nexceed the amount requested. The jury awarded different sums for each cause of action\nand did not write the total amount of the damages on the verdict form. On remand, the\ntrial court may take further steps to avoid any duplicate damages awards.\n\n\n              5.     Instruction Not to Total Damages\n       Any contention that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury not to total the\ndamages award was forfeited because NAT and Lerner requested the instruction based on\nCACI No. 361, did not object to the jury form on the ground that it allowed damages to\nimproperly be calculated, and stipulated to the responses that the trial court provided to\nthe jury questions during deliberations.\n\n\n              6.     Interpretation of Jury’s Verdict\n       NAT contends the trial court incorrectly added together the jury’s findings on\ndamages for contract and tort causes of action. It contends that Ash cannot obtain tort\ndamages for a breach of the escrow instructions (see Money Store Investment Corp. v.\nSouthern Cal. Bank (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 722, 732) or at least must elect between\ncauses of action. It appears that Ash introduced evidence that NAT’s conduct went\nbeyond a breach of contract. But, in view of our reversal, we need not reach this issue.\n\n\n              7.     Sufficiency of the Evidence\n       Because of our reversals on both the contract and tort causes of action, we need\nnot reach the issue of damages as to Lerner or liability as to NAT. There was substantial\nevidence to support the findings that Lerner and NAT breached their contracts with Ash.\nThe expected closing date as set forth in the parties’ agreement was November 21, 2008.\nThe purchase agreement and escrow instructions stated that time was of the essence.\n\n                                             23\n\fThere was testimony that the closing date was mandatory. With the acquiescence of\nNAT, Lerner did not submit his deeds of trust or vesting information into escrow in time\nto close. There was evidence that Ash had done everything required of him to close\nescrow on November 21, 2008. There was evidence that the funds could have been wired\non November 21, 2008. As noted above there was substantial evidence that Ash did not\nknow what prevented Lerner from providing the necessary material to close, and there\nwas substantial evidence that Lerner and NAT did not rely on anything Ash said or did to\ncause the escrow not to close on time.\n\n\n               8.    Attorney Fees\n       In view of our decision, the issues regarding attorney fees will have to be resolved\nupon remand.\n\n\n               9.    Rulings on Motions\n       Defendants contend their motions for nonsuit, judgment withstanding the verdict,\nand new trial should have been granted. In view of our decision, we need not deal with\nthese issues except that we remand for a new trial on whether NAT is liable on the\ndamages issue.\n\n\n               10.   Punitive Damages\n       Ash contends the trial court erred in granting NAT’s motion for judgment\nnotwithstanding the verdict on the issue of punitive damages. In view of our decision, we\ndo not have to resolve this issue.\n\n\n               11.   Amendment of Complaint\n       Ash contends he should have been granted leave to file a second amended\ncomplaint adding a cause of action that Lerner aided and abetted NAT’s breach of\nfiduciary duty, even though Ash waited more than two years from the filing of the\ncomplaint and more than one year after filing the operative amended complaint before\n\n                                            24\n\fseeking leave to file another amended complaint. This issue may be considered by the\ntrial court upon remand.\n\n\n       E.     Conclusion\n       We reverse and remand the matter for retrial on the issue of damages for breach of\ncontract and as to tort liability of NAT consistent with this opinion. (See Torres v.\nAutomobile Club of So. California (1997) 15 Cal.4th 771, 782; Bowman v. Wyatt (2010)\n186 Cal.App.4th 286, 332; Bliss v. Cal. Cooperative Producers (1952) 112 Cal.App.2d\n507.) The issues to be retried are not so inextricably intertwined that a complete new trial\nas to the breach of contract claims is required. (See Liodas v. Sahadi (1977) 19 Cal.3d\n278, 284-285.)\n\n\n                                     DISPOSITION\n\n\n       We affirm as to the liability of Lerner and NAT for breach of contact. We reverse\nand remand the matter as to contract damages as to Lerner and NAT and tort liability of\nNAT. Each party shall bear his or its own costs of appeal.\n       CERTIFIED FOR PARTIAL PUBLICATION\n\n\n\n\n                                                 MOSK, Acting P. J.\n\nI concur:\n\n\n\n              KUMAR, J.\n\n\n\n        Judge of the Los Angeles Superior Court, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to\narticle VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.\n\n                                            25\n\fKRIEGLER, J., Dissenting.\n       I respectfully dissent.\n       My colleagues reverse the judgment on the theory the evidence is insufficient as a\nmatter of law to establish that the damages suffered by the buyer were foreseeable. I\ndisagree and would hold, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\njudgment, that the issue of foreseeability was properly left to the jury’s determination.\n       The escrow company breached an agreement with the buyer to secure his funds by\na specified date, leaving the funds with an intermediary. Whether the intermediary’s\nbankruptcy was foreseeable to the escrow company based on the facts and circumstances\nof this case is a question on which reasonable minds can differ, making it an appropriate\nissue for the jury to decide. There is sufficient evidence to support the jury’s\ndetermination that the bankruptcy and the buyer’s damages were foreseeable to the\nescrow company. The seller breached the agreement as well, by failing to meet the\nescrow deadline, although the jury found the majority of the buyer’s damages (including\nthe tax consequences) were not foreseeable to the seller. However, the jury’s finding that\nsome of the damages were foreseeable to the seller as a result of missing the escrow\ndeadline is supported by substantial evidence.\n       I agree with the majority opinion that a superseding cause instruction was\nwarranted with respect to the tort actions against the escrow company. However, in light\nof the arguments at trial and the jury’s findings, I do not believe it is reasonably probable\nthat the jury would have come to a different result if the instruction had been given.\n\n\n                    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n\n       Our duty on appeal is to view the facts in the light most favorable to the judgment.\n(Hub City Solid Waste Services, Inc. v. City of Compton (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 1114,\n1128-1129.) Because my view of the facts supporting the judgment differs significantly\nfrom the majority, I set forth the facts in accordance with the standard of review.\n\fI. Property Purchase Agreement\n\n\n       Plaintiff and appellant David Ash, as trustee of the David Ash Trust dated January\n10, 2008, owned commercial property on Wilshire Boulevard. He entered into an\nagreement to sell the Wilshire property on September 8, 2008. His brokers and\naccountant said he could defer capital gains tax under Internal Revenue Code section\n1031 (section 1031) by using the proceeds to purchase a replacement property. Ash\nresearched tax deferred exchanges. Under section 1031, he was required to place the sale\nproceeds with a qualified intermediary, identify a replacement property within 45 days,\nand complete the purchase within 180 days. Ash intended to use TIMCOR Exchange\nCorporation 1031, a subsidiary of Washington Mutual, as the intermediary, because it\nwas the most familiar company.\n       Ash found a commercial property for sale on Venice Boulevard that fit his needs.\nThe property was owned by defendants and appellants Richard Lerner, as trustee of the\nLerner Family Trust, and Richard and Gloria Lerner, as trustees of the Exemption Trust\nof the Lerner Family Trust (collectively Lerner).1\n       Ash submitted a purchase offer for the Venice property on September 29, 2008.\nLerner’s counteroffer on October 6, 2008, signed by Richard, stated that the seller was\n“Lerner Family Trust” and provided Lerner the right to select the escrow holder. Ash\naccepted the counteroffer on October 8, 2008, and delivered a deposit of $50,000.\n       Ash could not use TIMCOR as an intermediary, however, because Washington\nMutual had declared bankruptcy in the interim and closed operations. Ash spoke with\nbrokers and selected qualified intermediary LandAmerica Exchange Services, Inc. He\narranged for LandAmerica to receive the sale proceeds from the escrow on the Wilshire\nproperty and place them in a segregated account held by LandAmerica for Ash’s benefit.\nLandAmerica prepared an agreement for the transaction dated October 8, 2008.\n\n\n1\n       Because more than one party or participant shares the last name Lerner, they are\nreferred to individually by their first names.\n\n                                            2\n\f       Lerner’s real estate agent was Rick Rivera at Centers Business Management\n(CBM). Rivera selected defendant and appellant North American Title Company (NAT)\nto provide escrow services and title insurance. NAT title officer Victor Greene prepared\na preliminary title report for the Venice property dated October 10, 2008, which he sent\nto CBM. The report stated that title to the property was held as follows: a 50 percent\ninterest held by Barbara Simkin, Bernard David Lerner, Richard Scott Lerner, Gloria Lee\nLerner, and Irving Reifman as trustees of the Ray Lerner Irrevocable Trust; and a 50\npercent interest held by Barbara Simkin, Bernard David Lerner, Richard Scott Lerner,\nand Gloria Lee Lerner as trustees of the Exemption Trust of the Lerner Family Trust\ndated November 17, 1986. The report included a form that Lerner needed to complete to\ncertify that the signatories had authority to act for the trust.\n       Rivera contacted NAT escrow officer Maria Jennings on October 13, 2008, to act\nas the escrow officer. Jennings prepared escrow instructions on October 17, 2008, which\nidentified the seller as “The Lerner Family Trust” and stated the expected closing date for\nescrow was November 21, 2008.\n       Richard decided to record a note and deed of trust on the Venice property to\nsecure a debt that Lerner owed to a third party. He would use the sale proceeds to pay off\nthe note. Paying the debt through escrow would provide tax benefits to Lerner. Richard\narranged for his attorney, James Fisher, to manage the transaction. Attorney Fisher did\nnot know the escrow deadline.\n       Richard also planned to defer Lerner’s capital gains tax on the sale through a\nsection 1031 exchange. On November 4, 2008, CBM’s in-house attorney, Jeffrey\nAdelman, wrote an e-mail to Richard stating, “So that we avoid the vesting issues we had\nto clean up at [two other properties], please confirm EXACTLY how title is held for [the\nVenice property] and EXACTLY who will be doing a [section] 1031 exchange.” Richard\nasked him to send information showing the recorded title for the Venice property.\n       On November 5, 2008, Ash removed all of the buyer contingencies and instructed\nNAT to meet the escrow deadline. Lerner learned that Ash planned to get a loan from US\nBank for part of the purchase price.\n\n                                                3\n\f       On November 6, 2008, Jennings alerted Rivera that vesting information was\nrequired for the property. Rivera asked her to identify the necessary information.\nJennings replied that the title to the property reflected two trusts, so NAT needed copies\nof the trust agreements and all amendments, a confirmation that Richard had authority to\nsign on behalf of both trusts, and death certificates for previous trustees. Rivera e-mailed\nNAT’s request to Richard.\n       Richard responded that his mortgage broker Barry Weinstock had handled vesting\ninformation five times previously, and Attorney Fisher had replaced one of the former\ntrustees. Richard requested Attorney Fisher send certain documents to Rivera, and that\nRivera obtain the rest of the information from Weinstock.\n       Escrow closed on Ash’s Wilshire property and the sale proceeds were deposited\nwith LandAmerica in the segregated account for Ash’s benefit. After Ash had entered\ninto the agreement with LandAmerica, he developed concerns about LandAmerica’s\nfinancial viability. The banking system was collapsing and Ash was afraid of the state of\nthe entire industry. He needed the income from the Venice property. He wanted to move\nforward as quickly as possible to get the income and be protected.\n       Ash could not direct LandAmerica to transfer his funds to the Venice property\nescrow without violating the section 1031 exchange requirements. On November 12,\n2008, Ash asked LandAmerica employee Sarah Blankenship to communicate with\nJennings to transfer $120,000 to escrow. Ash also instructed Jennings to demand the\nwire transfer from LandAmerica. On November 13, 2008, Blankenship and Jennings\nexchanged documents by e-mail, including wiring instructions. Blankenship transferred\n$120,000 into escrow that day. LandAmerica was already holding the sale proceeds in\naccordance with the intermediary agreement dated October 8, 2008, when Ash finally\nsigned the agreement on November 13, 2008.\n       Weinstock provided some of Lerner’s vesting information on November 14, 2008,\nwhich Jennings forwarded to Greene on November 17, 2008.\n       On November 19, 2008, two days before escrow was scheduled to close, US Bank\nemployee Robert Kaempen delivered the following to NAT on Ash’s behalf: cashier’s\n\n                                             4\n\fchecks totaling $842,000, a deed of trust, a document verifying that Ash was the sole\nauthorized trustee of the Ash Trust, and amended escrow instructions directing NAT to\nrecord the deed of trust before the close of escrow. Ash began accruing interest on the\nloan at the rate of $500 per day.\n       That same day, Ash repeatedly asked Jennings to request the rest of the purchase\nfunds from LandAmerica, which she confirmed that she would do. Ash told Jennings\nseveral times that he needed the income from the Venice property, wanted to get the\nescrow completed, and wanted to have his funds safely reinvested.\n       Ash’s real estate broker Robert Laswell spoke with Jennings in the late afternoon.\nShe told him that all the funds were in. He believed NAT had received Ash’s funds from\nLandAmerica and escrow would close a day early.\n       On the afternoon of November 19, 2008, Attorney Fisher spoke to Jennings for the\nfirst time. He said he would be giving her two deeds of trust securing notes payable to\nthird parties which he wanted recorded prior to the close of escrow. Jennings told him to\nget the deeds of trust to her by 3:30 p.m. the next day, if he wanted them recorded by\nFriday. Jennings agreed to prepare payoff demands, escrow instructions, and an\nacknowledgement. In an e-mail confirming their responsibilities, Attorney Fisher\nreferred to “the escrow tentatively scheduled to close the following week.” Jennings\nopened a separate escrow for Lerner’s transaction with the third party.\n       On the morning of November 20, 2008, Jennings gave Attorney Fisher’s contact\ninformation to Greene. Greene said he was reviewing Lerner’s trust documents and they\nprobably would need additional information.\n       Before noon on November 20, 2008, Richard sent an e-mail to Rivera in which he\nexpressed regret if the third party transaction delayed the escrow closing. He added, “It\nis my fault because I thought the escrow was not closing until the end of the month. I\nwill do my best to urge [Attorney Fisher] to expedite his matters.”\n       LandAmerica needed an estimated closing statement from Jennings stating the\namount to transfer. Shortly after noon, Ash sent an e-mail to Jennings asking if she had\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\freceived his funds from US Bank. “If so, is it possible to get me something so I can ask\nLandAmerica to wire you the remaining balance?”\n       Attorney Fisher, Jennings, and Greene continued to exchange documents and\ninstructions about Lerner’s transaction with the third party. Jennings wrote an e-mail to\nAsh, “I got the funds today, I am working on your file exclusively today. I will have an\nestimate for you shortly. I am working on some last minute things for the Seller that is\ngoing to delay us a bit. I will keep you posted on how that is all progressing. I am\nthinking that we are going to be pushed to Monday or Tuesday of next week.” Ash\nresponded, “No Problem. Do I get a discount;) (jk).” However, in a later telephone\nconversation, Jennings said escrow would not close on time and Ash said he was not\napproving a delay. Jennings said she would see what she could do to get it done.\n       Jennings prepared and e-mailed documents for the third party to sign. At 4:15\np.m., Jennings sent an e-mail to Rivera explaining that attorneys in the third party\ntransaction were reviewing documents. She said she had told Richard that every day the\ndeeds of trust were not recorded pushed the escrow closing one day later. She told\nRichard and Attorney Fisher that if they wanted the deeds of trust recorded the next day,\nshe needed them by 3:30 p.m., but they had not been delivered. She added, “Richard\nasked me if all these last minute issues were preventing this escrow from closing\ntomorrow and I respectfully told him ‘Yes.’” She noted Greene had contacted Attorney\nFisher for trust certifications, so he could finalize the seller vesting issues.\n       At 4:34 p.m., Jennings e-mailed a revised closing estimate to Ash. She sent a trust\ncertification for him to complete, but acknowledged later that she already had the trust\ncertification he signed for US Bank.\n       Ash forwarded the closing estimate to Blankenship. At 4:48 p.m., Blankenship\nrequested that Ash send a signed copy of the closing estimate and asked Jennings for\nwiring instructions. Ash faxed Blankenship a signed copy of the closing estimate.\nJennings did not reply.\n       On Friday, November 21, 2008, the day escrow was scheduled to close, Jennings\nhad all the funds necessary from Ash to close the transaction except the wire transfer\n\n                                               6\n\ffrom LandAmerica. Blankenship sent another e-mail to Jennings asking, “When do you\nneed the funds wired?” Jennings did not respond. Ash tried to call Jennings several\ntimes but was not able to reach her. He believed the wire transfer from LandAmerica had\nbeen completed.\n       At 1:16 p.m. on November 21, 2008, Jennings sent documents for the third party\nto sign. She notified Lerner that escrow could close if they got copies of the documents\nback by e-mail or fax. Lerner asked NAT to record the third party deeds of trust as an\naccommodation, releasing NAT from claims arising from the recording.\n       At 4:24 p.m. on November 21, 2008, Richard e-mailed some of the remaining\nvesting documents to Jennings. He could not find a copy of the exemption trust. He\nwrote, “I will look over the weekend at my home storage unit for a copy. Please [ask]\nyour title person if the waiver is sufficient especially in light of the recorded deeds.” The\nthird party e-mailed executed documents to Jennings at 4:55 p.m., but without the\ncomplete vesting documents, escrow could not close.\n       On Monday, November 24, 2008, LandAmerica notified its clients that it was\nfiling for bankruptcy. The bankruptcy court froze all of the assets that LandAmerica\ncontrolled. Jennings wrote an e-mail to Blankenship and Ash asking, “Sarah or David,\ncan you confirm how much you will be wiring and when you will wire?” NAT recorded\nthe third party deeds of trust that day.\n       Lerner’s vesting issues were later resolved, and the parties eventually executed\nagreements to extend escrow. Ash would not have signed the extension agreements,\nhowever, if he had known of Lerner and NAT’s actions that prevented escrow from\nclosing. Ash did not cancel the transaction, because he would have lost his deposits and\nbeen unable to complete the tax-deferred exchange. He paid interest on the US Bank\nloan. After five months, US Bank required Ash repay the loan, because no deed of trust\nhad been recorded to secure it. Ash was not receiving income from the property and had\nto borrow money from his mother. He hired an attorney to represent his interests in the\nbankruptcy and try to get his money released in order to complete the transaction. The\nbankruptcy court eventually released Ash’s funds in January 2010. With the funds and a\n\n                                              7\n\fnew loan at a higher interest rate from Wells Fargo, escrow closed in March 2010.\nHowever, the tax-deferred exchange was not completed within the time allowed and Ash\nhad to pay significant taxes on his gain from the sale of the Wilshire property.\n       Ash sustained direct damages totaling $1,033,000 as a result of the failure to meet\nthe escrow deadline, including his tax exposure, the interest that he paid on the US Bank\nloan, the increased interest rate on the Wells Fargo loan, and his attorney fees to obtain\nhis funds from the bankrupt estate.\n\n\nII. Legal Proceedings\n\n\n       On April 13, 2009, Ash filed a complaint against Lerner for breach of the purchase\nagreement and against NAT for breach of the escrow instructions and breach of fiduciary\nduty. On March 2, 2010, Ash filed an amended complaint, adding a cause of action\nagainst NAT for negligence.\n       A jury trial began on July 20, 2011. Ash’s escrow expert Vickie Crestani\nexplained that although LandAmerica’s bankruptcy was unusual, it was not the first time\nin her history of working with qualified intermediaries that an intermediary had declared\nbankruptcy. Crestani was disturbed to hear that LandAmerica had closed its doors, but\ncould not say that she was surprised. There had been rumors among LandAmerica\nemployees that LandAmerica would fold up and close its doors. Crestani could not say\nwhether these rumors were generally known by people in the real estate industry in\nSouthern California.\n       Crestani testified that Jennings had a fiduciary duty to follow Ash’s instructions to\nobtain his funds. Jennings failed to secure the funds from Ash’s qualified intermediary\nwhen he requested them, which she should have done even if escrow was going to be\ndelayed by a day or two.\n       In addition, the escrow instructions did not allow Lerner to encumber the property\nbefore escrow closed. When Jennings received information that constituted a material\nchange to the escrow, she needed to immediately advise Ash of the seller’s intentions to\n\n                                             8\n\fencumber the property and give Ash the opportunity to work out his options. NAT and\nJennings accommodated Lerner and assisted in the delay of escrow closing, rather than\nclosing the transaction.\n       Ash had completed everything that he needed to do to close the transaction.\nAccording to Crestani, when Jennings accepted loan proceeds from US Bank, she should\nhave communicated with Ash that she would not be able to record the transaction and did\nnot have his funds from LandAmerica. She should have gone over his options, including\nreturning the loan proceeds, obtaining the funds from LandAmerica, or investing Ash’s\nfunds in commercial paper or an interest-bearing account.\n       Ash’s accountant testified that when the section 1031 exchange failed, Ash’s tax\nliability included $465,000 attributable to the Venice property transaction. Ash’s\ndamages expert Winston Elton testified that as a result of the failure to close escrow on\ntime, Ash suffered the following damages: $166,000 of lost income from the property\nwhich Lerner collected instead; the additional tax liability of $465,000; legal costs of\n$140,000; payments and fees on the US Bank loan totaling $42,000; interest of $28,000\non a loan from his mother; and an additional $189,000 for the new loan from Wells\nFargo. Therefore, the total amount of Ash’s direct damages was $1,033,000.\n       During closing arguments, Ash argued that LandAmerica’s bankruptcy was the\nelephant in the room, but Lerner and NAT invited the elephant in by shirking their\nobligations to meet the escrow deadline. Lerner had breached the purchase agreement by\nrecording deeds of trust that changed the title and failing to deliver title by the escrow\ndeadline. NAT breached its agreement with Ash by failing to request Ash’s funds from\nLandAmerica and breached fiduciary duties by failing to act on Ash’s behalf.\nSpecifically, NAT failed to follow Ash’s instructions to get his funds from LandAmerica,\nconcealed information about the delay and entered into a side agreement with Lerner to\nrecord third party deeds of trust. NAT was negligent because Jennings failed to properly\ndetermine the property owners at the outset of escrow, did not timely send out\ndocuments, ignored the escrow deadline, and did not disclose conflicts to Ash. Ash\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\fsought four categories of damages totaling approximately one million dollars: the taxes\nincurred, lost profits, legal costs from the bankruptcy, and his costs related to the loans.\n       In Lerner’s closing argument, Lerner argued that a section 1031 exchange is not\ntax forgiveness, but simply tax deferral, so it was pure speculation as to what Ash’s tax\nliability would have ultimately been. In addition, Ash was seeking duplicative damages\nby asking for lost income as well as the payments made on the loans to acquire the\nproperty. Lerner noted that everyone was shocked when LandAmerica went into\nbankruptcy, and ultimately, it was LandAmerica that took Ash’s money.\n       NAT also argued that LandAmerica’s bankruptcy was an unforeseeable and\nextraordinary event. No one had expected or foreseen that it was going to happen.\nEscrow did not close on Monday, November 24, 2008, or later, because LandAmerica\nclosed its doors, which was not caused by NAT or Lerner. Ash could not blame NAT\nthat the bankruptcy judge refused to disburse funds held by LandAmerica.\n       On August 2, 2011, the jury returned its verdict. The jury found NAT breached its\ncontract with Ash. All the conditions occurred that were required for NAT’s\nperformance. NAT failed to act as required under the contract and Ash was harmed. The\ntotal damages attributable to NAT for breach of contract were $250,000. NAT also\nbreached a fiduciary duty owed to Ash, which caused damages of $250,000. In addition,\nthe jury found that NAT was negligent, which was a substantial factor in causing harm to\nAsh, and attributed damages of $500,000 to NAT for negligence. Moreover, the jury\nfound that NAT acted with malice, oppression, or fraud, and a managing agent of NAT\nauthorized the conduct. Therefore, the jury also awarded punitive damages of $750,000\nagainst NAT.\n       As against Lerner, the jury found that Lerner entered into a contract to sell\ncommercial real property to Ash, and Ash had substantially performed under the\nagreement. Lerner failed to act as the contract required and Ash was harmed as a result.\nThe jury attributed $300,000 of Ash’s damages to Lerner’s breach of the purchase\nagreement.\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\f       On September 19, 2011, the trial court entered judgment against NAT in the\namount of $1,750,000 and against Lerner in the amount of $300,000. Lerner and NAT\nfiled motions for new trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdict, while Ash filed a\nmotion seeking attorney and expert fees from Lerner and NAT. The court granted NAT’s\nmotion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to the claim for punitive damages and\notherwise denied the motions. On November 8, 2011, the court entered an amended\njudgment.\n\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n\nStandard of Review\n\n\n       “‘When findings of fact are challenged on appeal, we are bound by the familiar\nand highly deferential substantial evidence standard of review.

City of\nCompton (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 1114, 1128-1129.)\n\n\nForeseeability of Contract Damages\n\n\n       The majority accepts the contention of Lerner and NAT that Ash’s damages were\nunforeseeable as a matter of law and there is no substantial evidence to support the jury’s\nfinding that the damages were foreseeable. I disagree.\n       “Damages awarded to an injured party for breach of contract ‘seek to approximate\nthe agreed-upon performance.’ [Citation.] The goal is to put the plaintiff ‘in as good a\nposition as he or she would have occupied’ if the defendant had not breached the\n\n                                            11\n\fcontract. [Citation.] In other words, the plaintiff is entitled to damages that are\nequivalent to the benefit of the plaintiff’s contractual bargain. [Citation.]” (Lewis Jorge\nConstruction Management, Inc. v. Pomona Unified School Dist. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 960,\n967-968 (Lewis).)\n       There are two types of contractual damages: “general damages (sometimes called\ndirect damages) and special damages (sometimes called consequential damages).”\n(Lewis, supra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 968.) General damages are “those that flow directly and\nnecessarily from a breach of contract, or that are a natural result of a breach. (Civ. Code,\n§ 3300 [damages ‘which, in the ordinary course of things, would be likely to result’ from\nbreach]; Mitchell v. Clarke (1886) 71 Cal. 163, 167-168 [general damages are those that\nnaturally and necessarily result from breach].) Because general damages are a natural\nand necessary consequence of a contract breach, they are often said to be within the\ncontemplation of the parties, meaning that because their occurrence is sufficiently\npredictable the parties at the time of contracting are ‘deemed’ to have contemplated them.\n(Calamari & Perillo, The Law of Contracts (2d ed. 1977) § 14-5, p. 525; Hunt Bros. Co.\nv. San Lorenzo Water Co. (1906) 150 Cal. 51, 56 [parties need not ‘actually have\ncontemplated the very consequence that occurred,’ but they would have supposed such a\nconsequence was likely to follow a breach].)” (Lewis, supra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 968.)\n       Special damages “are those losses that do not arise directly and inevitably from\nany similar breach of any similar agreement. Instead, they are secondary or derivative\nlosses arising from circumstances that are particular to the contract or to the parties.\nSpecial damages are recoverable if the special or particular circumstances from which\nthey arise were actually communicated to or known by the breaching party (a subjective\ntest) or were matters of which the breaching party should have been aware at the time of\ncontracting (an objective test). [Citations.] Special damages ‘will not be presumed from\nthe mere breach’ but represent loss that ‘occurred by reason of injuries following from’\nthe breach. [Citation.] Special damages are among the losses that are foreseeable and\nproximately caused by the breach of a contract. [Citation.]” (Lewis, supra, 34 Cal.4th at\npp. 968-969.)\n\n                                             12\n\f       “Contract damages, unlike damages in tort (Civ. Code, § 3333), do not permit\nrecovery for unanticipated injury. [Citation.] Parties may voluntarily assume the risk of\nliability for unusual losses, but to do so they must be told, at the time the contract is\nmade, of any special harm likely to result from a breach [citations]. Alternatively, the\nnature of the contract or the circumstances in which it is made may compel the inference\nthat the defendant should have contemplated the fact that such a loss would be ‘the\nprobable result’ of the defendant’s breach. [Citation.] Not recoverable as special\ndamages are those ‘beyond the expectations of the parties.’ [Citation.] Special damages\nfor breach of contract are limited to losses that were either actually foreseen (see, e.g.,\nDallman Co. v. Southern Heater Co. (1968) 262 Cal.App.2d 582, 586 [in contract\nnegotiations, supplier was put on notice that its failure to perform would result in lost\nprofits]) or were ‘reasonably foreseeable’ when the contract was formed. [Citation.]”\n(Lewis, supra, 34 Cal.4th at pp. 969-970.)\n       Ash testified that just before the parties entered their transaction, the most well-\nknown intermediary closed its doors due to Washington Mutual’s bankruptcy. Ash\ndeveloped concerns about the financial viability of LandAmerica, and he told Jennings\nthat he was anxious to have his money safely reinvested in the property. In other words,\nAsh communicated his fear to NAT that his funds were not safe with the intermediary.\nThe extent of Ash’s concern was underscored by the fact that he had LandAmerica\ntransfer a significant portion of his funds into escrow early.\n       The jury understood Ash’s testimony about the collapse of the banking system and\nthe state of the industry referred to the economic crisis of 2008, the worst financial crisis\nin the United States since the Great Depression. (Brian R. Cheffins, Did Corporate\nGovernance “Fail” During the 2008 Stock Market Meltdown? The Case of the S&P 500\n(2009) 65 Bus. Law. 1, 1-2.) Venerable investment bank Bear Sterns was an early\ncasualty of the financial crisis in March 2008. (Financial Crisis Inquiry Report, Pub.L.\nNo. 111-21 (Jan. 2011) pp. 289-291, available at http://fcic.law.stanford.edu/report\n(Financial Crisis Report).) From there, financial market conditions deteriorated rapidly\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\fin the late summer and early fall of 2008. (West v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013)\n214 Cal.App.4th 780, 786.)\n       On September 7, 2008, the federal government placed two iconic mortgage\ninstitutions, the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal\nHome Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), into conservatorship. (Financial Crisis\nReport, supra, Pub.L. No. 111-21 at p. 309.) Investment bank Lehman Brothers declared\nbankruptcy on September 15, 2008, and American International Group, Inc. (AIG) failed\nas well. (Id. at p. 353.) Investors began pulling deposits out of strong banks far removed\nfrom the businesses at the center of the crisis. (Id. at pp. 353-354.) In a span of eight\ndays, depositors withdrew $16.7 billion from Washington Mutual. (Id. at p. 365.) On\nSeptember 25, 2008, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) issued an order closing\nWashington Mutual and appointing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as\nreceiver. (Jolley v. Chase Home Finance, LLC (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 872, 879, citing\nU.S. Dept. of the Treasury, Office of Thrift Supervision Order No. 2008-36 (Sep. 25,\n2008); 12 U.S.C. § 1821(c).) Washington Mutual’s collapse was the largest bank failure\nin United States history. (Douglas W. Arner, Michael A. Panton and Paul Lejot, Central\nBanks and Central Bank Cooperation in the Global Financial System (2010) 23 Pacific\nMcGeorge Global Bus. & Dev. L.J. 1, 23.)\n       On October 8, 2008, in the midst of the economic crisis, Ash and Lerner entered\ninto their purchase agreement. The Financial Crisis Report described the economic\nclimate at that time: “as massive losses spread throughout the financial system in the fall\nof 2008, many institutions failed, or would have failed but for government bailouts. As\npanic gripped the market, credit markets seized up, trading ground to a halt, and the stock\nmarket plunged.” (Financial Crisis Report, supra, Pub.L. No. 111-21 at p. 386.)\n       The jury was entitled to interpret the evidence in light of common human\nexperience and matters of common knowledge. (Gottloeb v. Melrose Health Baths\n(1957) 148 Cal.App.2d 313, 317.) The economic crisis of 2008 had a significant impact\non American lives. (Stavros Gadinis, From Independence to Politics in Financial\nRegulation (2013) 101 Cal. L. Rev. 327, 350.) “Dramatic government initiatives and\n\n                                             14\n\fviolent market reactions kept the crisis in daily headlines. The eleventh-hour bailouts of\nBear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, and AIG, and Lehman's spectacular collapse, increased the\nsalience of the issue and the visibility of the main actors. In a 2008 poll on the then-\nevolving financial crisis, an impressive 84 percent of respondents stated that they pay at\nleast some attention to reports about failing financial institutions such as Lehman, AIG,\nand Washington Mutual, with 57 percent stating that they pay a lot of attention.” (Id. at\npp. 350-351, fn. omitted.) “Although the national and state economies already were in\ndire straits [in September 2008], shortly thereafter the economy further deteriorated\ndramatically in light of the financial credit crisis and the resulting stock market collapse\nin October 2008 and a sharp decline in real estate values and consumer spending.”\n(Professional Engineers in California Government v. Schwarzenegger (2010) 50 Cal.4th\n989, 1001.)\n       The economic crisis that gripped the United States in 2008 and the risk of\nbankruptcy were not particular to LandAmerica. The conditions created a foreseeable\nrisk in any similar agreement at that time. Ash’s damages from the delay in closing\nescrow were general damages, not special damages. It was sufficiently predictable at the\ntime that the parties entered into their agreement that if NAT failed to obtain Ash’s funds\nand left them with the intermediary, NAT gambled on whether LandAmerica would be\nthe next financial institution to fail. Larger, established institutions collapsed before the\nparties even entered their agreement. Richard was as sophisticated an investor as Ash, if\nnot more so. If escrow failed to close on time, it was certainly predictable to Lerner that\n   Ash would lose income from the property and might have to arrange a new loan on\nless favorable terms. Whether the bankruptcy and damages resulting from delay were\nforeseeable to the parties at the time of contracting were factual issues for the jury to\ndetermine. The jury heard the evidence and found the damages were foreseeable, and I\nwould conclude from the above that the jury’s findings are supported by substantial\nevidence.\n       I agree with the majority that a superseding cause instruction was warranted in\nconnection with the tort causes of action against NAT. However, NAT fully argued that\n\n                                              15\n\fLandAmerica’s bankruptcy was an unforeseeable event and the cause of Ash’s damages.\nThe breach of contract instructions required the jury to find that either the harm was\nlikely to arise in the ordinary course of events from the breach, or both parties could\nreasonably have foreseen the harm as a probable result of the breach when the contract\nwas made. The jury not only awarded contract damages against NAT, but they awarded\nthe entire amount of Ash’s damages and found punitive damages were warranted as well.\nBased on the arguments and the jury’s findings, I do not believe it is reasonably probable\nthat the jury would have reached a different result had they been given a superseding\ncause instruction as to a few of the claims.\n\n\n\n\n              KRIEGLER, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                               16\n\f",

The sale was part of an Internal\nRevenue Code (Title 26) section 1031 (section 1031) transaction to defer the buyer’s\ncapital gain tax on the buyer’s sale of another property. The buyer had the money\npayable on his sale of the other property deposited in a segregated account with a section\n1031 qualified exchange intermediary (section 1031 intermediary).1 On the Monday after\nthe sale had been scheduled to close, the section 1031 intermediary closed and then filed\nfor bankruptcy. The bankruptcy court did not release the buyer’s money until after it was\ntoo late legally to qualify for deferral of taxes under section 1031.\n       A jury found the seller and the escrow company at fault for the escrow not closing\non time—i.e., on Friday—and awarded the buyer damages against the seller for the delay,\nincluding the loss of the tax benefits. The jury also found the escrow company liable for\nbreach of fiduciary duty and awarded the buyer damages against the escrow company for\nlosses resulting from the delay in the closing of escrow.\n       We reverse in part because, as discussed in the published portion of the opinion,\n(a) there was insufficient evidence the contract damages assessed against the seller based\non the bankruptcy were foreseeable and (b), as to the escrow company, the trial court\nfailed to instruct the jury on an intervening and superseding cause—the bankruptcy.\n\n\n\n\n1\n       See Department of Treasury Internal Revenue Service Regulations: IRC section\n1031, “Definition of Qualified Intermediary,” Preamble to Regulations: Deferred\nExchange R.23; section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4) R.34.\n\n                                              2\n\f                                FACTUAL BACKGROUND2\n         Plaintiff David Ash as trustee of the David Ash Trust (Ash), in connection with his\nsale of commercial real estate that realized a taxable gain, desired to defer the capital gain\ntax under section 10313 by purchasing commercial property from defendant Lerner.4 On\nOctober 8, 2008, Ash and Lerner entered into an agreement by which Lerner agreed to\nsell to Ash commercial property. Defendant North American Title Company (NAT) was\nselected to be the escrow company for the purchase, for which escrow opened shortly\nthereafter, and was scheduled to close on November 21, 2008—the “expected closing\ndate.”\n         Ash was in the real estate business, and, after talking to different brokers, selected\nLandAmerica Exchange Services (LandAmerica) to receive proceeds from the sale of his\nproperty in order to comply with section 1031.5 When he entered into the agreement\n\n2\n       We do not state in detail the facts concerning the liability of the defendants\nbecause the issues in the published portion of this opinion involve damages and jury\ninstructions.\n3\n        “Under section 1031, no taxable gain or loss is recognized on the exchange of\nproperties of like kind if both the property surrendered and the property received are held\neither ‘for productive use in a trade or business or for investment.’ (26 U.S.C.\n§ 1031(a)(1).) This section ‘allows taxpayers with profitable real estate investments to\nswap them for other real estate without paying tax.’ (2 Greenwald & Asimow, Cal.\nPractice Guide: Real Property Transactions (The Rutter Group 2009) ¶ 13:305.1, p. 13-\n58 (rev. #1, 2009).” (Sharabianlou v. Karp (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2255970\"><a href=\"/opinion/2255970/sharabianlou-v-karp/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Also referred to as\ndefendants and owners of the property are Richard and Gloria Lerner, as trustees of the\nRay Learner Irrevocable Trust dated December 30, 1992. They are collectively referred\nto as Lerner.\n5\n        Ash originally said he was going to use TIMCOR as an intermediary, “and I think\nWAMU [Washington Mutual] bought them or something happened, and both of them\ndisappeared or went bankrupt or something. . . . I’m not sure if they went out of business\nor if they were bought out by Washington Mutual and then Washington Mutual closed\nthem down and then went out of business. But somehow, it was all lumped together,\nfrom what I know, or what I was told.”\n\n                                                3\n\fwith LandAmerica, he had no concerns about its “financial viability.” He chose\nLandAmerica based on “the opinion of the [p]eople [he] spoke to about it.” When asked\nif he was “scared to lose [his] money if he got into a 1031 exchange,” he responded “no.”\nAsh was told LandAmerica had various branches and was part of LandAmerica\nCommercial Services. Ash had used LandAmerica for another replacement property.\n       At some point during the escrow period after the purchase and escrow agreements\nwere executed, Ash had concerns, “I was afraid of the whole industry everywhere . . . the\nbanking system was, like, collapsing at the time. So -- I also needed income. So I\nwanted to do something as quick as possible to get my income and also to be protected.”\nHe had nevertheless chosen to use LandAmerica, signing the papers on November 13,\n2008, over a month after escrow opened, although the paperwork with LandAmerica was\ndated as of October 9, 2008. He later said that near the closing date he was worried about\nhis money because he wanted the income: “I wanted to get it done.” Ash had told NAT\nthat he needed the income from the property he purchased to have the escrow completed\nbecause he wanted to have his funds safely reinvested. Ash never said he was concerned\nat any time specifically about the financial condition of LandAmerica.\n       Under section 1031, in order to defer paying the capital gains tax on the sale of his\nother property, Ash was required to close his transaction with Lerner within 180 days of\nthe sale of Ash’s property.6 Ash had the proceeds from the sale of his property on which\nthe escrow had closed deposited with LandAmerica, using an account at Citibank. This\nwas a segregated account that paid a lower interest rate than an account that pooled\nmoney from other investors. Ash verified that the funds were in the Citibank account.\n       Neither Lerner nor NAT had any involvement with the selection of LandAmerica.\nAs noted, the escrow was to close on Friday, November 21, 2008, but it was anticipated\n\n\n6\n       The property being purchased must be identified within 45 days after the sale, and\nthe purchase must take place within 180 days of the sale. (Title 26 U.S.C. § 1031(a)(3).)\nUp to three potential properties may be identified. (Title 26 U.S.C. § 1031(a)(3).)\nSection 1031 can be simply a deferral of the capital gains tax if the taxpayer later sells the\nproperty he or she acquired.\n\n\n                                              4\n\fby both defendants that the escrow would take a few more days to close. When so\ninformed, Ash responded, “no problem do I get a discount[] (jk) [just kidding]. Thank\nyou!!” Ash’s response expressed no concern about the status of LandAmerica. On\nMonday, November 24, 2008, LandAmerica froze all of its accounts, including\nsegregated accounts, and then filed for bankruptcy.\n      Ash’s real estate broker was aware of LandAmerica and the number of people who\nused it. He believed it was a “very substantial company” and a “very large company”\nand knew of its affiliated companies. He said he told Ash it was a reputable company.\nAsh’s broker said he too was “shocked” and “everybody was shocked” when\nLandAmerica closed its doors. Ash had expressed no concerns to Lerner or to NAT\nabout the financial solvency of LandAmerica. The escrow officer at NAT who had\nworked with LandAmerica had no concerns about the solvency of LandAmerica prior to\nthe bankruptcy. She said she was “shocked” upon hearing LandAmerica had closed.\n      Ash’s expert, who once worked for LandAmerica, said it was “unusual,”\n“alarming,” and “unique” that LandAmerica closed its doors. She added that escrow\nholders would not get information about rumors concerning a section 1031 qualified\nintermediary, and if they did, they would not necessarily inform the principals to escrow\naccounts of such rumors. She could not say that any such rumors about LandAmerica\nwere generally known by people in the real estate industry in Southern California. There\nis no evidence that Ash, and more importantly defendants, were aware of any such\nrumors about LandAmerica. The real estate agents involved, in addition to the escrow\nofficer for NAT, said they were “shocked” and surprised about LandAmerica’s\nbankruptcy. A LandAmerica employee handling the matter said she had been involved in\n5000 or more section 1031 exchanges and apparently had no warning of an impending\nLandAmerica bankruptcy. That LandAmerica employee said, “There was never any\ndoubt until 9:00 a.m. on the morning of November 24 [the date the business closed] that\nthe money would be available.” She added that the event was so traumatic that it was\neven worse than the death of her father—“worse than anything”; “absolutely beyond\ndescription.” She added, “everybody [at LandAmerica] was very angry and couldn’t\n\n                                            5\n\funderstand how it could happen.” Another LandAmerica employee said she had no\nawareness of any financial problems with LandAmerica. Ash’s real estate agent, who\nhad been in the industry for more than 35 years and involved with section 1031\nexchanges, said this was the first one in which a qualified intermediary failed to fund the\nescrow. 7 Despite Ash’s hopes and the fact that the money was in a segregated account,\nthe bankruptcy court refused to allow depositors, including Ash, to have access to their\ndeposited monies.\n       Ash did not cancel the transaction because he was concerned he might lose his\ndeposits and would be unable to complete the tax-deferred exchange. He continued to\npay interest on the bank loan he had taken out to purchase the property without the\nincome from the property to use for loan payments. The bank required Ash to repay the\nloan after five months because there was no deed of trust recorded to secure the loan.\nWithout income from the property, he was required to borrow money from his mother.\nHe also needed to hire an attorney to attempt to convince the bankruptcy court to release\nhis money in order to complete the transaction.\n       The escrow did not close until March 2010, after the bankruptcy court finally\nreleased Ash’s funds. The closing of escrow was too late for Ash to obtain the section\n1031 tax deferral of his capital gain taxes.8\n\n\n\n\n7\n         LandAmerica apparently failed because it invested its funds in auction rate\nsecurities, the market for which collapsed in February of 2008. (See Funk, So You\nThought Your Proceeds Belong To You? The Interplay Between Like-Kind Exchanges\nUnder the Tax and Bankruptcy Codes (2011) 25 No. 2 Prac. Tax Law 43, 50-51 (Funk).\nThe Chief Operating Officer of LandAmerica told “everybody how great everything was\n. . . and that he had no idea there was a bankruptcy imminent.” He added that the\n“mother company” “had promised to, if necessary, buy those securities to make the\naccommodator [1031 intermediary] liquid.” He also said that the “mother company” had\nguaranteed the accommodator funds.\n8\n       Ash, nevertheless, on his tax return treated his sale of property as nontaxable, and\nthen later amended the return to show the gain.\n\n\n                                                6\n\f       As a result of the delayed escrow and the delay in recovering his funds resulting\nfrom the bankruptcy, Ash sued Lerner and NAT for damages, including Ash’s legal\nexpenses of $140,000 incurred in the bankruptcy proceeding and tax liability of $465,000\ndue to the failure of the section 1031 exchange. Additionally, Ash claimed $166,000 in\nincome from the property if the sale had been timely completed, payments to the lender\nof $42,000, $189,000 paid for a new loan above what he would have paid for the original\nloan that was terminated by the original lender, and $28,000 of interest on a loan to meet\nexpenses. These direct damages totaled $1,033,000.9 Ash also sought indirect damages\nof $1 million attributed to his loss of cash flow to retain and purchase properties.\n       Defendants’ made motions for nonsuit based on a lack of causation and the\ndefense of intervening and superseding cause. The trial court denied the motions and\nrefused to give defendants’ proposed instructions on causation and intervening/\nsuperseding cause.\n       The jury returned its verdict finding that Lerner breached its contract by delaying\nthe timely close of escrow, and was liable to Ash for $300,000, and that NAT breached\nits contract with Ash to provide proper and timely escrow and title services and was\nliable for $250,000 in contract damages. The jury also found that NAT was liable for\nnegligence in the amount of $500,000 and for $250,000 for breach of fiduciary duty. The\njury imposed punitive damages on NAT in the amount of $750,000.

Baxendale (1854) 156 Eng.Rep. 145. In that venerable English case, a shaft in\nHadley’s mill broke rendering the mill inoperable. Hadley contracted with Baxendale to\ntransport the shaft to an engineer to make a duplicate. Hadley told Baxendale the shaft\nshould be sent immediately, and Baxendale promised to have it delivered the next day.\nBaxendale did not know the mill would be inoperable until the new shaft arrived.\nBaxendale did not transport the shaft in the promised time, causing the mill to be shut\ndown for an additional five days. Hadley sued, inter alia, for lost profits resulting from\nthe delay. The court held that although a plaintiff is entitled to an amount that will place\nit in the same position it would have been had the breaching party performed, damages\nfor special circumstances, such as in that case, can be assessed against the breaching\nparty only when they were within the contemplation of both parties as a probable\nconsequence of a breach. Baxendale did not know that the mill would be shut down and\nwould remain shut until the new shaft arrived. Loss of profits could not fairly or\nreasonably have been contemplated by both parties without Hadley having communicated\nthe special circumstances to Baxendale. Thus, the court, in reversing the judgment, held\nthat lost profits could not be awarded to Hadley. (Id. at p. 152.)\n       The court in Lewis Jorge, supra, 34 Cal.4th at pages 969 through 970 added,\n“Hadley did not expressly distinguish between general and special damages. But such a\ndistinction flows naturally from that case; hence the rule that a party assumes the risk of\nspecial damages liability for unusual losses arising from special circumstances only if it\nwas ‘advised of the facts concerning special harm which might result’ from breach—it is\nnot deemed to have assumed such additional risk, however, simply by entering into the\n\n                                              9\n\fcontract.

[Citations.] Contract\ndamages, unlike damages in tort (Civ. Code, § 3333), do not permit recovery for\nunanticipated injury. [Citation.] Parties may voluntarily assume the risk of liability for\nunusual losses, but to do so they must be told, at the time the contract is made, of any\nspecial harm likely to result from a breach [citations]. Alternatively, the nature of the\ncontract or the circumstances in which it is made may compel the inference that the\ndefendant should have contemplated the fact that such a loss would be ‘the probable\nresult’ of the defendant’s breach. [Citation.] Not recoverable as special damages are\nthose ‘beyond the expectations of the parties.’ [Citation.] Special damages for breach of\ncontract are limited to losses that were either actually foreseen [citation] or were\n‘reasonably foreseeable’ when the contract was formed.

In III\nFarnsworth on Contracts (3d ed. 2004) section 12.14, pages 260 to 262 (Farnsworth), the\nauthor sets forth the criteria for foreseeability in part as follows: “foreseeability is to be\ndetermined as of the time of the making of the contract”; “what must be foreseeable is\nonly that the loss would result if the breach occurred”; “it is foreseeability only by the\nparty in breach that is determinative”; “foreseeability has an objective character”; and\n“the loss need only have been foreseeable as a probable, as opposed to a necessary or\ncertain, result of the breach.”\n       The instant case is governed by the Hadley v. Baxendale, supra, 156 Eng.Rep. 145\nprinciple adopted by our Supreme Court. To the extent any part of the $250,000 of\ndamages for the breaches of contract by Lerner and NAT is attributable to expenses\nincurred in connection with the bankruptcy and the loss of the deferral of the capital gains\ntax, such damages are not general damages, i.e., those “‘which, in the ordinary course of\nthings, would be likely to result’” from the breach (Civ. Code, § 3300) and which “flow\n\n                                              10\n\fdirectly and necessarily from a breach of contract, or that are a natural result of a\nbreach” and are within the contemplation of the parties. (Lewis Jorge, supra, 34 Cal.4th\nat p. 968.) Rather, they “are secondary or derivative losses arising from circumstances\nthat are particular to the contract or to the parties.” (Ibid.) These “[s]pecial damages are\nrecoverable if the special or particular circumstances from which they arise were actually\ncommunicated to or known by the breaching party (a subjective test) or were matters of\nwhich the breaching party should have been aware at the time of contracting (an objective\ntest).” (Id. at pp. 968-969.) Moreover, “[s]pecial damages ‘will not be presumed from\nthe mere breach’ but represent loss that ‘occurred by reason of injuries following from’\nthe breach. [Citation.]” (Id. at p. 969.)\n       Because counsels’ arguments to the jury are not evidence, we look to the\ntestimony of the witnesses and the documents introduced as exhibits to assess the\nforeseeability of the bankruptcy. There is no evidence in the record that Ash\ncommunicated to Lerner or NAT at the time of contracting—the relevant time—or at\nanytime, that the bankruptcy of LandAmerica and indefinite freezing of segregated\naccounts could result from a short but untimely delay in the escrow closing. There is no\nevidence in the record, expert or otherwise, that Lerner or NAT knew or should have\nknown of this risk at the time of contracting or anytime. The transaction in issue took\nplace in the fall of 2008, during an economic recession. Evidence of the various events\nthat allegedly took place during 2008 and their timing is not in the record. There is no\nevidence as to what facts Lerner or NAT knew concerning those events. Whatever Ash’s\napprehensions were are irrelevant. Only the communications to or knowledge of Lerner\nand NAT are relevant to foreseeability.\n       Ash, even though ostensibly risk averse, having been in the real estate business\nand having consulted others in the business, chose the 1031 exchange intermediary and\npurportedly protected himself by having the proceeds of his sale deposited in a\nsegregated account. There is not substantial, if any, evidence that under these\ncircumstances, Ash was aware of any risk to the funds he placed in a segregated account,\nmuch less that he communicated any such risk to Lerner or NAT or that Lerner or NAT\n\n                                              11\n\fshould have known of any such risk. That Ash was not aware of any risk supports the\nposition that neither Lerner nor NAT was aware or should have been aware of any such\nrisk at the time of the contract.\n       The real estate brokers and agents involved, an escrow expert, and a LandAmerica\nemployee, all testified that they did not foresee any risk to the funds deposited with\nLandAmerica. Ash’s damages expert stated that what occurred is “a fairly rare\noccurrence” and is “fairly unusual.” Again, this evidence dispels any notion that Lerner\nor NAT were or should have foreseen the risk of bankruptcy. Lerner just wanted to sell\nhis property, and NAT was just the escrow company. Presumably, it did not matter to\nLerner or NAT whether the sale was part of a section 1031 exchange, other than the\nexchange was what motivated the buyer, Ash.\n       To suggest that Lerner and NAT should have known of the risk is speculation and\nnot based on any evidence. There is no evidence that the parties to the transaction were\nconcerned that the economy or other institutional failures created a risk to the funds\nplaced in a segregated account with LandAmerica. The evidence does not show that\nLandAmerica was part of purported banking system problems of which Ash was aware.\nHe had used LandAmerica for escrow and other services before. There is nothing in the\nrecord or even argued by Ash concerning the precise nature of economic conditions at the\ntime of the contract and how they might have impacted a section 1031 qualified\nintermediary such as LandAmerica, which is not a bank. There was no evidence that\nLerner and NAT knew or should have known at the time of contracting that if the escrow\ndid not close in time, the section 1031 qualified intermediary selected by Ash would or\ncould go bankrupt or that Ash would or might not be able to recover his funds in time to\nqualify for a tax deferral. The papers appointing LandAmerica to serve as a section 1031\nintermediary were signed over a month after the escrow opened. Thus, defendants did\nnot contemplate the LandAmerica bankruptcy or the consequences thereof.\n       That there is no evidence in the record that at the time of the contracts the\nbankruptcy of LandAmerica was reasonably foreseeable by any of the participants—most\nimportantly, Lerner and NAT—is consistent with the general view that bankruptcies\n\n                                             12\n\fnormally are not within the contemplation of the parties at the time of a contract.

As noted, Ash deposited the sums in a\nsegregated account with the understanding they would be safe. If he thought they were\nsafe, there was no reason to conclude that defendants nevertheless should have\ncontemplated that the deposit was unsafe.\n       Also, there was no evidence that Lerner or NAT had any knowledge at the time of\ncontracting of the possibility that a bankruptcy judge for such a lengthy period of time\nwould not release the money in a segregated account. Indeed, under the circumstances, it\nwas unforeseeable that a bankruptcy court would not release the funds in an account,\nespecially in a segregated account, in time to meet the requirements for a tax free\nexchange.

Moreover, there was no\nevidence that defendants at the time of the contracts had knowledge that Ash would incur\nexpenses related to the bankruptcy.\n       As stated in Williston on Contracts, “If the contract is silent with respect to the\nrisks the defendant has assumed, the court will determine what risks were foreseen or\nforeseeable when the contract was made by viewing the matter in the light of common\nsense; and the courts will consider the nature and purpose of the contract, and the\nsurrounding circumstances known by the parties to exist at that time, as well as what the\nbreaching party may reasonably be supposed to have assumed consciously.” (24\nWilliston on Contracts (4th ed. 2013) § 64.13.) Because there was no evidence that the\nbankruptcy and bankruptcy judges’s refusal to release funds in a segregated account\n\n                                             14\n\fwere, at the time of the contracts, within the contemplation of the Lerner and NAT or that\nat those times they should have contemplated the probability of the result, the damages\narising from those events were not foreseeable for purposes of awarding contract\ndamages.\n       Accordingly, the trial court should reduce the contract damages judgment against\nLerner and NAT by amounts attributable to the bankruptcy and bankruptcy court’s delay\nin releasing the deposited funds. The matter is remanded for determination of damages\nnot attributable to the bankruptcy, including the legal fees in that proceeding and the\nbankruptcy court’s delay in releasing the funds.\n\n\n       C.     Intervening and Superseding Cause\n       The defendants invoked the tort defense of intervening and superseding cause, but\nthe trial court refused to instruct the jury on those defenses. A principle in tort law is that\nwhen “subsequent to the defendant’s negligent act, an independent intervening force\nactively operates to produce the injury, the chain of causation may be broken. It is\nusually said that if the risk of injury might have been reasonably foreseen, the defendant\nis liable, but that if the independent intervening act is highly unusual or extraordinary, not\nreasonably likely to happen and hence not foreseeable, it is a superseding cause, and the\ndefendant is not liable.” (6 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (10th ed 2005) Torts § 1197,\np. 574 and case cited therein.)\n       The Restatement Second of Torts distinguishes between “superseding cause” and\n“intervening force.” The Restatement Second of Torts, section 440, provides that “a\nsuperseding cause is an act of a third person or other force which by its intervention\nprevents the actor from being liable for harm to another which his antecedent negligence\nis a substantial factor in bringing about.” The Restatement Second of Torts, section 441,\nsubdivision (1) states, “An intervening force is one which actively operates in producing\nharm to another after the actor’s negligent act or omission has been committed.” Another\nauthority states, “An intervening act is regarded as a superseding cause when it is outside\nthe scope of the risk the defendant negligently created. This idea is usually expressed in\n\n                                              15\n\fshorthand by saying that if the intervening act is itself unforeseeable then it may become\na superseding cause.” (1 Dobbs et al., The Law of Torts (2d ed. 2013) § 212, p. 741\n(Dobbs).)\n        A superseding cause relieves a defendant from tort liability for a plaintiff’s\ninjuries, if both the intervening act and the results of the act are not foreseeable. “[W]hat\nis required to be foreseeable is the general character of the event or harm . . . not its\nprecise nature or manner of occurrence.” (Bigbee v. Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co. (1983) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1359983\"><a href=\"/opinion/1359983/bigbee-v-pacific-tel-tel-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 57-58.) “Whether an intervening force is superseding or not generally\npresents a question of fact, but becomes a matter of law where only one reasonable\nconclusion may be reached. [Citation.]” (Chanda v. Federal Home Loans Corp. (2013)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 680-\n681.)\n        The defense of intervening and superseding cause applies in tort cases. In contract\ncases, the defense does not absolve the defendant of liability, although closely related is\nthe principle that if the special damages are not foreseeable and proximately caused by\nthe breach of contract they are not recoverable.11 As one authority has noted, “Breach\nmay not be precluded, however, by the presence of other contributing causes—multiple\nor intervening. Although the injured party’s own failure to avoid loss may bar recovery\nfor that loss, this is not thought of as a consequence of a requirement of causation but of a\nlimitation under a ‘mitigation’ rule.” (III Farnsworth, supra, at § 12.1, p. 151, fns.\nomitted.) Thus, the Lerners cannot invoke the defense of intervening and superseding\ncause applicable to torts because no tort claims were asserted against them.12\n\n11\n        See VerSteeg, Perspectives on Foreseeability in the Law of Contracts and Torts:\nThe Relationship Between “Intervening Causes” and “Impossibility” (2011) 2011 Mich.\nSt. L.Rev. 1497, 1510 (“The Contract doctrine that we typically label as ‘impossibility,\nimpracticability, frustration of purpose,’ or, as the Uniform Commercial Code refers to it,\n‘failure of presupposed conditions,’ and the Tort doctrine of ‘intervening and superseding\ncauses’ are actually one and the same”).\n12\n      See Schneider, Consequential Damages in the International Sale of Goods:\nAnalysis of Two Decisions (1995) 16 U.

Valley of California, Inc., supra, 24 Cal.App.4th at p. 562).\n       The trial court instructed the jury as follows: “The Ash Trust claims that it was\nharmed by NATCO’S breach of the fiduciary duty to use reasonable care. To establish\nthis claim, the Ash Trust must prove all of the following: 1. That NATCO was the Ash\nTrust escrow holder; 2. That NATCO acted on the Ash Trust’s behalf for purposes of\npurchasing a commercial property; 3. That NATCO failed to act as a reasonably careful\nescrow holder would have acted under the same or similar circumstances; 4. That the Ash\nTrust was harmed; and 5. That NATCO’s conduct was a substantial factor in causing the\nAsh Trust’s harm.” The trial court did not instruct the jury that it was required to find the\nbreach of fiduciary duty to be intentional. And the trial court refused to instruct the jury\non constructive fraud.\n       As it appears that the breach of fiduciary duty might have arisen from negligence,\nthe intervening and superseding act doctrine could have been applicable. As suggested\nabove, there is a question as to whether the intervening and superseding act doctrine is\napplicable to intentional torts. And, as noted above, in Brewer v. Teano, supra, 40\nCal.App.4th at page 1036, the court said that the doctrine “is less likely to cut off the\nchain of events put in motion by the original conduct of the tortfeasor.”13 In Tate v.\n\n\n\n13\n        In Ventas, Inc. v.

For example, the culpability of the third person committing the\nintervening or superseding act is just one factor in determining if an intervening force is a\nnew and independent superseding cause. (Rest.2d Torts, § 442, subds. (e) and (f); see\nalso 1 Dobbs, supra, § 210, pp. 729-732 [acts of nature]; 4 Harper et al. on Torts (3d ed.\n2007) § 20.5, p. 179 [“extreme force”].)\n       Our Supreme Court has pointed out that “[a] tort is a legal cause of injury only\nwhen it is a substantial factor in producing the injury.” (Soule v. General Motors Corp.\n(1994) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1296743\"><a href=\"/opinion/1296743/soule-v-general-motors-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 572 (Soule).) As relevant here, the court added, “This principle is\ndistinct from the defense of ‘superseding cause,’ which absolves a tortfeasor, even though\nhis conduct was a substantial contributing factor, when an independent event intervenes\nin the chain of causation, producing harm of a kind and degree so far beyond the risk the\noriginal tortfeasor should have foreseen that the law deems it unfair to hold him\nresponsible. [Citations.] It is also distinct from the doctrine of ‘concurrent causes,’\nwhich holds that when two or more tortious acts combine, each contributing significantly\nto a single ultimate harm, each act is deemed a substantial and legal cause of injury,\nmaking each concurrent tortfeasor fully liable. [Citations.]” (Id. at p. 573, fn. 9.)\n       The trial court refused a proposed jury instruction on intervening and superseding\ncause (CACI No. 432), which instruction was based on NAT’s defense theory. A party is\nentitled to nonargumentative and correct instructions it requests on every theory\nadvanced by that party if the theory is supported by substantial evidence. (Soule, supra, 8\n\nheld that the deputy sheriffs who framed the plaintiff were not liable to the plaintiff for a\nsexual assault on the plaintiff by other prisoners.\n\n                                              19\n\fCal.4th at p. 572.) We review the evidence most favorable to the applicability of the\nrequested instruction, as a party is entitled to that instruction if that evidence could\nestablish the elements of the theory presented. (Scott v. Rayhrer (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2265291\"><a href=\"/opinion/2265291/scott-v-rayhrer/\"><span class=\"volume\">185</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

But “‘[a] judgment will not be reversed for error[] in jury instructions\nunless it appears reasonably probable that, absent the error, the jury would have rendered\na verdict more favorable to the appellant. [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (Ibid.)\n       NAT contended at trial that LandAmerica’s bankruptcy, the ensuing freezing of\nthe segregated account, and the bankruptcy court’s refusal to release the funds occurred\nafter NAT’s conduct caused Ash his damage and was highly unusual. NAT claimed it\nhad no reason to expect such occurrences, and the resulting harm was different than that\nwhich could be expected from NAT’s conduct. There was sufficient evidence that the\nbankruptcy constituted “an independent event [intervening] in the chain of causation,\nproducing harm of a kind and degree so far beyond the risk” (Soule, supra, 8 Cal.4th at p.\n573, fn. 9) that NAT should have foreseen, that the jury should have been given the\nintervening and superseding cause instruction. The failure to give that instruction\nconstituted error. (See id. at p. 573 and at fn. 10.)\n       Moreover, the error was prejudicial. The general instructions on causation do not\nrender the error harmless because the doctrine of intervening and superseding cause\nassumes that a defendant’s conduct was a substantial contributory factor—i.e. that there\nwas causation. (Soule, supra, 8 Cal.4th at p. 573, fn. 9.) The jury finding that NAT was\nresponsible for $250,000 as foreseeable contract damages suggests that the remaining\n$750,000 of Ash’s tort damages against NAT for negligence and breach of fiduciary duty\nwere not based on the contract standard of damages but on tort principles. As the jury\nwas not given an instruction on the defenses of intervening and superseding cause, it\ncould not properly consider whether NAT should be responsible for a tort or tort\ndamages. That NAT’s conduct was found to be wrongful does not determine whether an\nintervening and superseding event relieves NAT of liability. Had the jury been instructed\non intervening and superseding cause, it is reasonably probable that it would have come\nto a different result, for damages were caused by the bankruptcy proceedings—an\n\n                                              20\n\findependent event that caused a harm that could not be foreseen by NAT. (Soule, supra,\n8 Cal.4th at p. 573, fn. 9.)\n       This conclusion is evident from our determination that, in view of the evidentiary\npresentations in this case, the bankruptcy events were unusual and not reasonably\nforeseeable. “Since the court’s general instruction on causation did not go into the\ncircumstances of this particular case but dealt with the defense of superseding cause by\nnegative implication only, the jury may well have overlooked that defense in untangling\nthe issues and arriving at its verdict.” (Self v. General Motors Corp. (1974) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2130968\"><a href=\"/opinion/2130968/self-v-general-motors-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Other Contentions\n       In view of our conclusions, we do not have to address many of the other\ncontentions by the parties.\n\n\n               1.     Accountant’s Testimony\n       Because of the decisions on foreseeability and intervening and superseding cause,\nwhether the accountant’s testimony on the transaction and damages was appropriate need\nnot be addressed.\n\n\n\n\n                                            21\n\f               2.    Special Instruction on Estoppel\n       NAT and Lerner contend that the trial court erred by refusing to give a special\ninstruction on estoppel based on Ash’s alleged acquiescence in the escrow delay. The\nelements of estoppel are that the party to be estopped must be aware of the facts, he must\nintend that his conduct be relied upon or acted on so that the other party should\nreasonably believe it was so intended, the other party must not know the true facts, and\nthe other party must rely on the conduct. (Longshore v. County of Ventura (1979) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 28.) Estoppel may not be applied if any of these elements is missing. (Hair v.\nState of California (1991) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2256545\"><a href=\"/opinion/2256545/hair-v-state-of-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 328.) There was no evidence Lerner relied\non anything Ash said in this regard. Moreover, Ash did not know that NAT did not\nintend to follow his directions. Thus, there was no error in not giving an estoppel\ninstruction.\n\n\n               3.    Special Instruction on Causation\n       NAT and Lerner contend that the trial court erred by refusing to give their\nproposed instruction on speculative causation. The trial court correctly instructed the\njury that the breach must be a substantial factor in causing the damages and that the\ncausal occurrence be reasonably certain. (See US Ecology, Inc. v. State of California\n(2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2255502\"><a href=\"/opinion/2255502/us-ecology-inc-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The intervening and superseding cause instruction\nthat should have been given as to NAT and the elimination of damages that are not\nforeseeable should cover Lerner’s and NAT’s contentions on this instruction.\n\n\n               4.    CACI No. 361 and Special Verdict\n       CACI No. 361 provides, “The Ash Trust has made claims against NATCO for\nbreach of contract; breach of fidiciary duty; and negligence. If you decide that the Ash\nTrust has proved all of . . . those claims, then the same damages that resulted from those\nclaims can be awarded only once.” Defendants claim this instruction along with the use\nof a special verdict form was error, citing Singh v. Southland Stone, U.S.A. Inc. (2010)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">338</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, as well as the instruction to the jury not to total the damage award.\n\n                                            22\n\fBut defendants requested CACI No. 361 and did not object to the special verdict form.\nAny error in giving the instruction in the language of CACI No. 361 was invited\n(Transport Ins. Co. v. TIG Ins. Co. (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">984</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1000), and the failure to\nobject to the special verdict form was forfeited. Moreover, the damages awarded did not\nexceed the amount requested. The jury awarded different sums for each cause of action\nand did not write the total amount of the damages on the verdict form. On remand, the\ntrial court may take further steps to avoid any duplicate damages awards.\n\n\n              5.     Instruction Not to Total Damages\n       Any contention that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury not to total the\ndamages award was forfeited because NAT and Lerner requested the instruction based on\nCACI No. 361, did not object to the jury form on the ground that it allowed damages to\nimproperly be calculated, and stipulated to the responses that the trial court provided to\nthe jury questions during deliberations.\n\n\n              6.     Interpretation of Jury’s Verdict\n       NAT contends the trial court incorrectly added together the jury’s findings on\ndamages for contract and tort causes of action. It contends that Ash cannot obtain tort\ndamages for a breach of the escrow instructions (see Money Store Investment Corp. v.\nSouthern Cal. Bank (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2276411\"><a href=\"/opinion/2276411/money-store-v-southern-cal-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 732) or at least must elect between\ncauses of action. It appears that Ash introduced evidence that NAT’s conduct went\nbeyond a breach of contract. But, in view of our reversal, we need not reach this issue.\n\n\n              7.     Sufficiency of the Evidence\n       Because of our reversals on both the contract and tort causes of action, we need\nnot reach the issue of damages as to Lerner or liability as to NAT. There was substantial\nevidence to support the findings that Lerner and NAT breached their contracts with Ash.\nThe expected closing date as set forth in the parties’ agreement was November 21, 2008.\nThe purchase agreement and escrow instructions stated that time was of the essence.\n\n                                             23\n\fThere was testimony that the closing date was mandatory. With the acquiescence of\nNAT, Lerner did not submit his deeds of trust or vesting information into escrow in time\nto close. There was evidence that Ash had done everything required of him to close\nescrow on November 21, 2008. There was evidence that the funds could have been wired\non November 21, 2008. As noted above there was substantial evidence that Ash did not\nknow what prevented Lerner from providing the necessary material to close, and there\nwas substantial evidence that Lerner and NAT did not rely on anything Ash said or did to\ncause the escrow not to close on time.\n\n\n               8.    Attorney Fees\n       In view of our decision, the issues regarding attorney fees will have to be resolved\nupon remand.\n\n\n               9.    Rulings on Motions\n       Defendants contend their motions for nonsuit, judgment withstanding the verdict,\nand new trial should have been granted. In view of our decision, we need not deal with\nthese issues except that we remand for a new trial on whether NAT is liable on the\ndamages issue.\n\n\n               10.   Punitive Damages\n       Ash contends the trial court erred in granting NAT’s motion for judgment\nnotwithstanding the verdict on the issue of punitive damages. In view of our decision, we\ndo not have to resolve this issue.\n\n\n               11.   Amendment of Complaint\n       Ash contends he should have been granted leave to file a second amended\ncomplaint adding a cause of action that Lerner aided and abetted NAT’s breach of\nfiduciary duty, even though Ash waited more than two years from the filing of the\ncomplaint and more than one year after filing the operative amended complaint before\n\n                                            24\n\fseeking leave to file another amended complaint. This issue may be considered by the\ntrial court upon remand.\n\n\n       E.     Conclusion\n       We reverse and remand the matter for retrial on the issue of damages for breach of\ncontract and as to tort liability of NAT consistent with this opinion.

I\ndisagree and would hold, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\njudgment, that the issue of foreseeability was properly left to the jury’s determination.\n       The escrow company breached an agreement with the buyer to secure his funds by\na specified date, leaving the funds with an intermediary. Whether the intermediary’s\nbankruptcy was foreseeable to the escrow company based on the facts and circumstances\nof this case is a question on which reasonable minds can differ, making it an appropriate\nissue for the jury to decide. There is sufficient evidence to support the jury’s\ndetermination that the bankruptcy and the buyer’s damages were foreseeable to the\nescrow company. The seller breached the agreement as well, by failing to meet the\nescrow deadline, although the jury found the majority of the buyer’s damages (including\nthe tax consequences) were not foreseeable to the seller. However, the jury’s finding that\nsome of the damages were foreseeable to the seller as a result of missing the escrow\ndeadline is supported by substantial evidence.\n       I agree with the majority opinion that a superseding cause instruction was\nwarranted with respect to the tort actions against the escrow company. However, in light\nof the arguments at trial and the jury’s findings, I do not believe it is reasonably probable\nthat the jury would have come to a different result if the instruction had been given.\n\n\n                    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n\n       Our duty on appeal is to view the facts in the light most favorable to the judgment.\n(Hub City Solid Waste Services, Inc. v.

Because my view of the facts supporting the judgment differs significantly\nfrom the majority, I set forth the facts in accordance with the standard of review.\n\fI. Property Purchase Agreement\n\n\n       Plaintiff and appellant David Ash, as trustee of the David Ash Trust dated January\n10, 2008, owned commercial property on Wilshire Boulevard. He entered into an\nagreement to sell the Wilshire property on September 8, 2008. His brokers and\naccountant said he could defer capital gains tax under Internal Revenue Code section\n1031 (section 1031) by using the proceeds to purchase a replacement property. Ash\nresearched tax deferred exchanges. Under section 1031, he was required to place the sale\nproceeds with a qualified intermediary, identify a replacement property within 45 days,\nand complete the purchase within 180 days. Ash intended to use TIMCOR Exchange\nCorporation 1031, a subsidiary of Washington Mutual, as the intermediary, because it\nwas the most familiar company.\n       Ash found a commercial property for sale on Venice Boulevard that fit his needs.\nThe property was owned by defendants and appellants Richard Lerner, as trustee of the\nLerner Family Trust, and Richard and Gloria Lerner, as trustees of the Exemption Trust\nof the Lerner Family Trust (collectively Lerner).1\n       Ash submitted a purchase offer for the Venice property on September 29, 2008.\nLerner’s counteroffer on October 6, 2008, signed by Richard, stated that the seller was\n“Lerner Family Trust” and provided Lerner the right to select the escrow holder. Ash\naccepted the counteroffer on October 8, 2008, and delivered a deposit of $50,000.\n       Ash could not use TIMCOR as an intermediary, however, because Washington\nMutual had declared bankruptcy in the interim and closed operations. Ash spoke with\nbrokers and selected qualified intermediary LandAmerica Exchange Services, Inc. He\narranged for LandAmerica to receive the sale proceeds from the escrow on the Wilshire\nproperty and place them in a segregated account held by LandAmerica for Ash’s benefit.\nLandAmerica prepared an agreement for the transaction dated October 8, 2008.\n\n\n1\n       Because more than one party or participant shares the last name Lerner, they are\nreferred to individually by their first names.\n\n                                            2\n\f       Lerner’s real estate agent was Rick Rivera at Centers Business Management\n(CBM). Rivera selected defendant and appellant North American Title Company (NAT)\nto provide escrow services and title insurance. NAT title officer Victor Greene prepared\na preliminary title report for the Venice property dated October 10, 2008, which he sent\nto CBM. The report stated that title to the property was held as follows: a 50 percent\ninterest held by Barbara Simkin, Bernard David Lerner, Richard Scott Lerner, Gloria Lee\nLerner, and Irving Reifman as trustees of the Ray Lerner Irrevocable Trust; and a 50\npercent interest held by Barbara Simkin, Bernard David Lerner, Richard Scott Lerner,\nand Gloria Lee Lerner as trustees of the Exemption Trust of the Lerner Family Trust\ndated November 17, 1986. The report included a form that Lerner needed to complete to\ncertify that the signatories had authority to act for the trust.\n       Rivera contacted NAT escrow officer Maria Jennings on October 13, 2008, to act\nas the escrow officer. Jennings prepared escrow instructions on October 17, 2008, which\nidentified the seller as “The Lerner Family Trust” and stated the expected closing date for\nescrow was November 21, 2008.\n       Richard decided to record a note and deed of trust on the Venice property to\nsecure a debt that Lerner owed to a third party. He would use the sale proceeds to pay off\nthe note. Paying the debt through escrow would provide tax benefits to Lerner. Richard\narranged for his attorney, James Fisher, to manage the transaction. Attorney Fisher did\nnot know the escrow deadline.\n       Richard also planned to defer Lerner’s capital gains tax on the sale through a\nsection 1031 exchange. On November 4, 2008, CBM’s in-house attorney, Jeffrey\nAdelman, wrote an e-mail to Richard stating, “So that we avoid the vesting issues we had\nto clean up at [two other properties], please confirm EXACTLY how title is held for [the\nVenice property] and EXACTLY who will be doing a [section] 1031 exchange.” Richard\nasked him to send information showing the recorded title for the Venice property.\n       On November 5, 2008, Ash removed all of the buyer contingencies and instructed\nNAT to meet the escrow deadline. Lerner learned that Ash planned to get a loan from US\nBank for part of the purchase price.\n\n                                                3\n\f       On November 6, 2008, Jennings alerted Rivera that vesting information was\nrequired for the property. Rivera asked her to identify the necessary information.\nJennings replied that the title to the property reflected two trusts, so NAT needed copies\nof the trust agreements and all amendments, a confirmation that Richard had authority to\nsign on behalf of both trusts, and death certificates for previous trustees. Rivera e-mailed\nNAT’s request to Richard.\n       Richard responded that his mortgage broker Barry Weinstock had handled vesting\ninformation five times previously, and Attorney Fisher had replaced one of the former\ntrustees. Richard requested Attorney Fisher send certain documents to Rivera, and that\nRivera obtain the rest of the information from Weinstock.\n       Escrow closed on Ash’s Wilshire property and the sale proceeds were deposited\nwith LandAmerica in the segregated account for Ash’s benefit. After Ash had entered\ninto the agreement with LandAmerica, he developed concerns about LandAmerica’s\nfinancial viability. The banking system was collapsing and Ash was afraid of the state of\nthe entire industry. He needed the income from the Venice property. He wanted to move\nforward as quickly as possible to get the income and be protected.\n       Ash could not direct LandAmerica to transfer his funds to the Venice property\nescrow without violating the section 1031 exchange requirements. On November 12,\n2008, Ash asked LandAmerica employee Sarah Blankenship to communicate with\nJennings to transfer $120,000 to escrow. Ash also instructed Jennings to demand the\nwire transfer from LandAmerica. On November 13, 2008, Blankenship and Jennings\nexchanged documents by e-mail, including wiring instructions. Blankenship transferred\n$120,000 into escrow that day. LandAmerica was already holding the sale proceeds in\naccordance with the intermediary agreement dated October 8, 2008, when Ash finally\nsigned the agreement on November 13, 2008.\n       Weinstock provided some of Lerner’s vesting information on November 14, 2008,\nwhich Jennings forwarded to Greene on November 17, 2008.\n       On November 19, 2008, two days before escrow was scheduled to close, US Bank\nemployee Robert Kaempen delivered the following to NAT on Ash’s behalf: cashier’s\n\n                                             4\n\fchecks totaling $842,000, a deed of trust, a document verifying that Ash was the sole\nauthorized trustee of the Ash Trust, and amended escrow instructions directing NAT to\nrecord the deed of trust before the close of escrow. Ash began accruing interest on the\nloan at the rate of $500 per day.\n       That same day, Ash repeatedly asked Jennings to request the rest of the purchase\nfunds from LandAmerica, which she confirmed that she would do. Ash told Jennings\nseveral times that he needed the income from the Venice property, wanted to get the\nescrow completed, and wanted to have his funds safely reinvested.\n       Ash’s real estate broker Robert Laswell spoke with Jennings in the late afternoon.\nShe told him that all the funds were in. He believed NAT had received Ash’s funds from\nLandAmerica and escrow would close a day early.\n       On the afternoon of November 19, 2008, Attorney Fisher spoke to Jennings for the\nfirst time. He said he would be giving her two deeds of trust securing notes payable to\nthird parties which he wanted recorded prior to the close of escrow. Jennings told him to\nget the deeds of trust to her by 3:30 p.m. the next day, if he wanted them recorded by\nFriday. Jennings agreed to prepare payoff demands, escrow instructions, and an\nacknowledgement. In an e-mail confirming their responsibilities, Attorney Fisher\nreferred to “the escrow tentatively scheduled to close the following week.” Jennings\nopened a separate escrow for Lerner’s transaction with the third party.\n       On the morning of November 20, 2008, Jennings gave Attorney Fisher’s contact\ninformation to Greene. Greene said he was reviewing Lerner’s trust documents and they\nprobably would need additional information.\n       Before noon on November 20, 2008, Richard sent an e-mail to Rivera in which he\nexpressed regret if the third party transaction delayed the escrow closing. He added, “It\nis my fault because I thought the escrow was not closing until the end of the month. I\nwill do my best to urge [Attorney Fisher] to expedite his matters.”\n       LandAmerica needed an estimated closing statement from Jennings stating the\namount to transfer. Shortly after noon, Ash sent an e-mail to Jennings asking if she had\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\freceived his funds from US Bank. “If so, is it possible to get me something so I can ask\nLandAmerica to wire you the remaining balance?”\n       Attorney Fisher, Jennings, and Greene continued to exchange documents and\ninstructions about Lerner’s transaction with the third party. Jennings wrote an e-mail to\nAsh, “I got the funds today, I am working on your file exclusively today. I will have an\nestimate for you shortly. I am working on some last minute things for the Seller that is\ngoing to delay us a bit. I will keep you posted on how that is all progressing. I am\nthinking that we are going to be pushed to Monday or Tuesday of next week.” Ash\nresponded, “No Problem. Do I get a discount;) (jk).” However, in a later telephone\nconversation, Jennings said escrow would not close on time and Ash said he was not\napproving a delay. Jennings said she would see what she could do to get it done.\n       Jennings prepared and e-mailed documents for the third party to sign. At 4:15\np.m., Jennings sent an e-mail to Rivera explaining that attorneys in the third party\ntransaction were reviewing documents. She said she had told Richard that every day the\ndeeds of trust were not recorded pushed the escrow closing one day later. She told\nRichard and Attorney Fisher that if they wanted the deeds of trust recorded the next day,\nshe needed them by 3:30 p.m., but they had not been delivered. She added, “Richard\nasked me if all these last minute issues were preventing this escrow from closing\ntomorrow and I respectfully told him ‘Yes.’” She noted Greene had contacted Attorney\nFisher for trust certifications, so he could finalize the seller vesting issues.\n       At 4:34 p.m., Jennings e-mailed a revised closing estimate to Ash. She sent a trust\ncertification for him to complete, but acknowledged later that she already had the trust\ncertification he signed for US Bank.\n       Ash forwarded the closing estimate to Blankenship. At 4:48 p.m., Blankenship\nrequested that Ash send a signed copy of the closing estimate and asked Jennings for\nwiring instructions. Ash faxed Blankenship a signed copy of the closing estimate.\nJennings did not reply.\n       On Friday, November 21, 2008, the day escrow was scheduled to close, Jennings\nhad all the funds necessary from Ash to close the transaction except the wire transfer\n\n                                               6\n\ffrom LandAmerica. Blankenship sent another e-mail to Jennings asking, “When do you\nneed the funds wired?” Jennings did not respond. Ash tried to call Jennings several\ntimes but was not able to reach her. He believed the wire transfer from LandAmerica had\nbeen completed.\n       At 1:16 p.m. on November 21, 2008, Jennings sent documents for the third party\nto sign. She notified Lerner that escrow could close if they got copies of the documents\nback by e-mail or fax. Lerner asked NAT to record the third party deeds of trust as an\naccommodation, releasing NAT from claims arising from the recording.\n       At 4:24 p.m. on November 21, 2008, Richard e-mailed some of the remaining\nvesting documents to Jennings. He could not find a copy of the exemption trust. He\nwrote, “I will look over the weekend at my home storage unit for a copy. Please [ask]\nyour title person if the waiver is sufficient especially in light of the recorded deeds.” The\nthird party e-mailed executed documents to Jennings at 4:55 p.m., but without the\ncomplete vesting documents, escrow could not close.\n       On Monday, November 24, 2008, LandAmerica notified its clients that it was\nfiling for bankruptcy. The bankruptcy court froze all of the assets that LandAmerica\ncontrolled. Jennings wrote an e-mail to Blankenship and Ash asking, “Sarah or David,\ncan you confirm how much you will be wiring and when you will wire?” NAT recorded\nthe third party deeds of trust that day.\n       Lerner’s vesting issues were later resolved, and the parties eventually executed\nagreements to extend escrow. Ash would not have signed the extension agreements,\nhowever, if he had known of Lerner and NAT’s actions that prevented escrow from\nclosing. Ash did not cancel the transaction, because he would have lost his deposits and\nbeen unable to complete the tax-deferred exchange. He paid interest on the US Bank\nloan. After five months, US Bank required Ash repay the loan, because no deed of trust\nhad been recorded to secure it. Ash was not receiving income from the property and had\nto borrow money from his mother. He hired an attorney to represent his interests in the\nbankruptcy and try to get his money released in order to complete the transaction. The\nbankruptcy court eventually released Ash’s funds in January 2010. With the funds and a\n\n                                              7\n\fnew loan at a higher interest rate from Wells Fargo, escrow closed in March 2010.\nHowever, the tax-deferred exchange was not completed within the time allowed and Ash\nhad to pay significant taxes on his gain from the sale of the Wilshire property.\n       Ash sustained direct damages totaling $1,033,000 as a result of the failure to meet\nthe escrow deadline, including his tax exposure, the interest that he paid on the US Bank\nloan, the increased interest rate on the Wells Fargo loan, and his attorney fees to obtain\nhis funds from the bankrupt estate.\n\n\nII. Legal Proceedings\n\n\n       On April 13, 2009, Ash filed a complaint against Lerner for breach of the purchase\nagreement and against NAT for breach of the escrow instructions and breach of fiduciary\nduty. On March 2, 2010, Ash filed an amended complaint, adding a cause of action\nagainst NAT for negligence.\n       A jury trial began on July 20, 2011. Ash’s escrow expert Vickie Crestani\nexplained that although LandAmerica’s bankruptcy was unusual, it was not the first time\nin her history of working with qualified intermediaries that an intermediary had declared\nbankruptcy. Crestani was disturbed to hear that LandAmerica had closed its doors, but\ncould not say that she was surprised. There had been rumors among LandAmerica\nemployees that LandAmerica would fold up and close its doors. Crestani could not say\nwhether these rumors were generally known by people in the real estate industry in\nSouthern California.\n       Crestani testified that Jennings had a fiduciary duty to follow Ash’s instructions to\nobtain his funds. Jennings failed to secure the funds from Ash’s qualified intermediary\nwhen he requested them, which she should have done even if escrow was going to be\ndelayed by a day or two.\n       In addition, the escrow instructions did not allow Lerner to encumber the property\nbefore escrow closed. When Jennings received information that constituted a material\nchange to the escrow, she needed to immediately advise Ash of the seller’s intentions to\n\n                                             8\n\fencumber the property and give Ash the opportunity to work out his options. NAT and\nJennings accommodated Lerner and assisted in the delay of escrow closing, rather than\nclosing the transaction.\n       Ash had completed everything that he needed to do to close the transaction.\nAccording to Crestani, when Jennings accepted loan proceeds from US Bank, she should\nhave communicated with Ash that she would not be able to record the transaction and did\nnot have his funds from LandAmerica. She should have gone over his options, including\nreturning the loan proceeds, obtaining the funds from LandAmerica, or investing Ash’s\nfunds in commercial paper or an interest-bearing account.\n       Ash’s accountant testified that when the section 1031 exchange failed, Ash’s tax\nliability included $465,000 attributable to the Venice property transaction. Ash’s\ndamages expert Winston Elton testified that as a result of the failure to close escrow on\ntime, Ash suffered the following damages: $166,000 of lost income from the property\nwhich Lerner collected instead; the additional tax liability of $465,000; legal costs of\n$140,000; payments and fees on the US Bank loan totaling $42,000; interest of $28,000\non a loan from his mother; and an additional $189,000 for the new loan from Wells\nFargo. Therefore, the total amount of Ash’s direct damages was $1,033,000.\n       During closing arguments, Ash argued that LandAmerica’s bankruptcy was the\nelephant in the room, but Lerner and NAT invited the elephant in by shirking their\nobligations to meet the escrow deadline. Lerner had breached the purchase agreement by\nrecording deeds of trust that changed the title and failing to deliver title by the escrow\ndeadline. NAT breached its agreement with Ash by failing to request Ash’s funds from\nLandAmerica and breached fiduciary duties by failing to act on Ash’s behalf.\nSpecifically, NAT failed to follow Ash’s instructions to get his funds from LandAmerica,\nconcealed information about the delay and entered into a side agreement with Lerner to\nrecord third party deeds of trust. NAT was negligent because Jennings failed to properly\ndetermine the property owners at the outset of escrow, did not timely send out\ndocuments, ignored the escrow deadline, and did not disclose conflicts to Ash. Ash\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\fsought four categories of damages totaling approximately one million dollars: the taxes\nincurred, lost profits, legal costs from the bankruptcy, and his costs related to the loans.\n       In Lerner’s closing argument, Lerner argued that a section 1031 exchange is not\ntax forgiveness, but simply tax deferral, so it was pure speculation as to what Ash’s tax\nliability would have ultimately been. In addition, Ash was seeking duplicative damages\nby asking for lost income as well as the payments made on the loans to acquire the\nproperty. Lerner noted that everyone was shocked when LandAmerica went into\nbankruptcy, and ultimately, it was LandAmerica that took Ash’s money.\n       NAT also argued that LandAmerica’s bankruptcy was an unforeseeable and\nextraordinary event. No one had expected or foreseen that it was going to happen.\nEscrow did not close on Monday, November 24, 2008, or later, because LandAmerica\nclosed its doors, which was not caused by NAT or Lerner. Ash could not blame NAT\nthat the bankruptcy judge refused to disburse funds held by LandAmerica.\n       On August 2, 2011, the jury returned its verdict. The jury found NAT breached its\ncontract with Ash. All the conditions occurred that were required for NAT’s\nperformance. NAT failed to act as required under the contract and Ash was harmed. The\ntotal damages attributable to NAT for breach of contract were $250,000. NAT also\nbreached a fiduciary duty owed to Ash, which caused damages of $250,000. In addition,\nthe jury found that NAT was negligent, which was a substantial factor in causing harm to\nAsh, and attributed damages of $500,000 to NAT for negligence. Moreover, the jury\nfound that NAT acted with malice, oppression, or fraud, and a managing agent of NAT\nauthorized the conduct. Therefore, the jury also awarded punitive damages of $750,000\nagainst NAT.\n       As against Lerner, the jury found that Lerner entered into a contract to sell\ncommercial real property to Ash, and Ash had substantially performed under the\nagreement. Lerner failed to act as the contract required and Ash was harmed as a result.\nThe jury attributed $300,000 of Ash’s damages to Lerner’s breach of the purchase\nagreement.\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\f       On September 19, 2011, the trial court entered judgment against NAT in the\namount of $1,750,000 and against Lerner in the amount of $300,000. Lerner and NAT\nfiled motions for new trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdict, while Ash filed a\nmotion seeking attorney and expert fees from Lerner and NAT. The court granted NAT’s\nmotion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to the claim for punitive damages and\notherwise denied the motions. On November 8, 2011, the court entered an amended\njudgment.\n\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n\nStandard of Review\n\n\n       “‘When findings of fact are challenged on appeal, we are bound by the familiar\nand highly deferential substantial evidence standard of review.

General damages are “those that flow directly and\nnecessarily from a breach of contract, or that are a natural result of a breach. (Civ. Code,\n§ 3300 [damages ‘which, in the ordinary course of things, would be likely to result’ from\nbreach]; Mitchell v.

Instead, they are secondary or derivative\nlosses arising from circumstances that are particular to the contract or to the parties.\nSpecial damages are recoverable if the special or particular circumstances from which\nthey arise were actually communicated to or known by the breaching party (a subjective\ntest) or were matters of which the breaching party should have been aware at the time of\ncontracting (an objective test).

Ash\ndeveloped concerns about the financial viability of LandAmerica, and he told Jennings\nthat he was anxious to have his money safely reinvested in the property. In other words,\nAsh communicated his fear to NAT that his funds were not safe with the intermediary.\nThe extent of Ash’s concern was underscored by the fact that he had LandAmerica\ntransfer a significant portion of his funds into escrow early.\n       The jury understood Ash’s testimony about the collapse of the banking system and\nthe state of the industry referred to the economic crisis of 2008, the worst financial crisis\nin the United States since the Great Depression.

Venerable investment bank Bear Sterns was an early\ncasualty of the financial crisis in March 2008. (Financial Crisis Inquiry Report, Pub.L.\nNo. 111-21 (Jan. 2011) pp. 289-291, available at http://fcic.law.stanford.edu/report\n(Financial Crisis Report).) From there, financial market conditions deteriorated rapidly\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\fin the late summer and early fall of 2008. (West v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

(Financial Crisis\nReport, supra, Pub.L. No. 111-21 at p. 309.) Investment bank Lehman Brothers declared\nbankruptcy on September 15, 2008, and American International Group, Inc. (AIG) failed\nas well. (Id. at p. 353.) Investors began pulling deposits out of strong banks far removed\nfrom the businesses at the center of the crisis. (Id. at pp. 353-354.) In a span of eight\ndays, depositors withdrew $16.7 billion from Washington Mutual. (Id. at p. 365.) On\nSeptember 25, 2008, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) issued an order closing\nWashington Mutual and appointing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as\nreceiver. (Jolley v.

Washington Mutual’s collapse was the largest bank failure\nin United States history. (Douglas W. Arner, Michael A. Panton and Paul Lejot, Central\nBanks and Central Bank Cooperation in the Global Financial System (2010) 23 Pacific\nMcGeorge Global Bus. & Dev. L.J. 1, 23.)\n       On October 8, 2008, in the midst of the economic crisis, Ash and Lerner entered\ninto their purchase agreement. The Financial Crisis Report described the economic\nclimate at that time: “as massive losses spread throughout the financial system in the fall\nof 2008, many institutions failed, or would have failed but for government bailouts. As\npanic gripped the market, credit markets seized up, trading ground to a halt, and the stock\nmarket plunged.” (Financial Crisis Report, supra, Pub.L. No. 111-21 at p. 386.)\n       The jury was entitled to interpret the evidence in light of common human\nexperience and matters of common knowledge. (Gottloeb v. Melrose Health Baths\n(1957) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">148</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">313</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 317.) The economic crisis of 2008 had a significant impact\non American lives. (Stavros Gadinis, From Independence to Politics in Financial\nRegulation (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rev. 327, 350.) “Dramatic government initiatives and\n\n                                             14\n\fviolent market reactions kept the crisis in daily headlines. The eleventh-hour bailouts of\nBear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, and AIG, and Lehman's spectacular collapse, increased the\nsalience of the issue and the visibility of the main actors. In a 2008 poll on the then-\nevolving financial crisis, an impressive 84 percent of respondents stated that they pay at\nleast some attention to reports about failing financial institutions such as Lehman, AIG,\nand Washington Mutual, with 57 percent stating that they pay a lot of attention.” (Id. at\npp. 350-351, fn. omitted.) “Although the national and state economies already were in\ndire straits [in September 2008], shortly thereafter the economy further deteriorated\ndramatically in light of the financial credit crisis and the resulting stock market collapse\nin October 2008 and a sharp decline in real estate values and consumer spending.”\n(Professional Engineers in California Government v. Schwarzenegger (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2264228\"><a href=\"/opinion/2264228/professional-engineers-in-california-government-v-schwarzenegger/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">989</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1001.)\n       The economic crisis that gripped the United States in 2008 and the risk of\nbankruptcy were not particular to LandAmerica. The conditions created a foreseeable\nrisk in any similar agreement at that time. Ash’s damages from the delay in closing\nescrow were general damages, not special damages. It was sufficiently predictable at the\ntime that the parties entered into their agreement that if NAT failed to obtain Ash’s funds\nand left them with the intermediary, NAT gambled on whether LandAmerica would be\nthe next financial institution to fail. Larger, established institutions collapsed before the\nparties even entered their agreement. Richard was as sophisticated an investor as Ash, if\nnot more so. If escrow failed to close on time, it was certainly predictable to Lerner that\n   Ash would lose income from the property and might have to arrange a new loan on\nless favorable terms. Whether the bankruptcy and damages resulting from delay were\nforeseeable to the parties at the time of contracting were factual issues for the jury to\ndetermine. The jury heard the evidence and found the damages were foreseeable, and I\nwould conclude from the above that the jury’s findings are supported by substantial\nevidence.\n       I agree with the majority that a superseding cause instruction was warranted in\nconnection with the tort causes of action against NAT. However, NAT fully argued that\n\n                                              15\n\fLandAmerica’s bankruptcy was an unforeseeable event and the cause of Ash’s damages.\nThe breach of contract instructions required the jury to find that either the harm was\nlikely to arise in the ordinary course of events from the breach, or both parties could\nreasonably have foreseen the harm as a probable result of the breach when the contract\nwas made. The jury not only awarded contract damages against NAT, but they awarded\nthe entire amount of Ash’s damages and found punitive damages were warranted as well.\nBased on the arguments and the jury’s findings, I do not believe it is reasonably probable\nthat the jury would have reached a different result had they been given a superseding\ncause instruction as to a few of the claims.\n\n\n\n\n              KRIEGLER, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                               16\n\f</pre>",
