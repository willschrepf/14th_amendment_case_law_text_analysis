C. A.), and while the tax under secs. 61-2301 &#8212; 61-2311, I. C. A., is the general <em>ad valorem</em> tax, it includes school taxes, and therefore is a duplication <em>pro</em><em>tanto.</em> No other property is subjected to the double payment of taxes as is imposed here &#8212; all other property in the counties where the mines are located is subject to the general <em>ad</em><em>valorem</em> tax. . . . but no other property pays this so-called license tax. . . . .\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 706</span> </p>\n<p>In considering this phase of the controversy we must keep in mind the distinction between duplicate taxation and discriminatory taxation.</p>\n<p>In the above opinion the rule quoted is followed with this illustration:</p>\n<p>\". . . . as, for example, if property should be taxed against the bailor and bailee or against the trustee and <em>cestui que</em><em>trust</em>, mortgagor and mortgagee &#8212; such a taxation would be clearly duplicate, and it is in this sense that the uniformity clause found in many of the constitutions had been construed prior to the adoption of our constitution.\"</p>\n<p>Under the law thus stated and illustrated, the court sustained both a general and a special tax on all property within the respondent county for highway purposes, as not duplicate taxation, and there is more differentiation between income, <em>ad valorem</em> and occupation excise taxes, than between two <em>ad valorem</em> taxes. The doctrine of the above case has been thus sustained and followed as construed herein. (<em>Hettinger v.</em><em>Good Road Dist. No. 1</em>, <cross_reference>19 Idaho 313</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>113 P. 721</cross_reference>; <em>Independent</em><em>H. Dist. No. 2 v.

But it is argued mines are taxed twice for schools, while other businesses are not. That is a question of asserted discrimination and is disposed of elsewhere herein.</p>\n<p>The point now being established is that an occupation excise tax, as against concurrently levied <em>ad valorem</em> and income taxes, all for the support of the public schools, does not result in duplicate taxation.</p>\n<p>The very intensification of appellants' argument of the importance of the mining industry in the state, which every-one concedes, emphasizes that the occupation of mining is valuable and when productive, may legitimately be the subject of distinct taxation, separate and apart from, the income derived therefrom and thereby, and the value of the properties worked and improvements and equipment thereon.</p>\n<p>Appellants argue that because this occupation tax is applied to mining operations and not other businesses it lacks uniformity. The tax applies to all mining operations <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 707</span> \ncarried on in the state and the legislature may select what businesses or incidents of value are to be taxed, and such selection is not obnoxious to the constitution if the imposition operates equally on all within the particular class so selected, and this tax does so operate.</p>\n<p>In <em>State v. Crosson</em>, <cross_reference>33 Idaho 140</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>190 P. 922</cross_reference>, the statute singled out certain ones of a general group engaged in transportation, which the court held unjustifiable classification, but recognized the rule.

A., 29-601 et seq.) imposed duplicate taxation upon the corporations coming under the provisions of the act, since they were already subject to a property tax. The court said (page 201 of the Idaho report):</p>\n<p>\"The fee required to be collected under the provisions of the statute involved in this case is referred to indiscriminately as a 'license tax' or an 'annual license fee' by the statute, which makes it clear that it is not intended <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 709</span> \nas a property tax. That fact appears from the statute in unmistakable terms. The fee here exacted is clearly an excise tax as usually distinguished from a property tax. It is authorized by that portion of sec. 2, art. 7, of the state constitution which says: 'The legislature may also impose a license tax (both upon natural persons and upon corporations, other than municipal, doing business in this state).' \"</p>\n<p>In <em>Diefendorf v.

The personal nature of the imposition is made clear by section 70 of the act: 'Every tax imposed by this act, . . . . shall be a debt from the taxpayer to the state. . . . . ' . . . .

In<em>McAlester-Edwards Coal Co. v. Trapp</em>, <cross_reference>43 Okl. 510</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>141 P. 794</cross_reference>, the first point passed on was that the purpose for which the tax was levied was sufficiently specified in the original and amendatory acts, relying on <em>Binion v. Oklahoma Gas  Elec. Co.</em>,<cross_reference>28 Okl. 356</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>114 P. 1096</cross_reference>, which in turn relied in part on<em>State v.

The second point was that the statute here considered was in contravention of the federal constitution in that the United States Government had sole control over the land (Indian lands) where the coal was mined and that plaintiffs there contesting the tax, were in effect agents of the federal government, whereby an instrumentality of the federal government was taxed, which question is in no way involved or pertinent herein. In <em>Binion v.

But as elsewhere pointed out herein, the legislature in the statute involved clearly intended the tax to apply to both, so the distinction between the two kinds of mining is unimportant.<em>Thompson v.

Provided, that where such lands are taxed with a five cent acreage tax for levy purposes, said levy tax shall be deducted from the tax hereby imposed.\"</p>\n<p>It was held that the above act imposed a tax on property as such and was not a privilege or occupation tax and hence violated section 112 of the Mississippi constitution, but since the tax under consideration is an excise tax the case is not in point.</p>\n<p>In <em>State v.

To accomplish this purpose, words may be changed, not to legislate, but to arrive at what the legislature intended to enact.

It has but one legitimate purpose; to arrive at and effectuate the true intent. This is to be determined, not from any one word or phrase, but from the whole enactment. The courts may not substitute their own wisdom and policy for the Legislature's. But they should not attribute to that co-ordinate branch an utterly unreasonable, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 718</span> \ninexplicable, and ineffectual intent.

The canons invoked are familiar and of unquestionable force in proper cases.</p>\n<p>\"But there is present here plenty of unequivocal language signifying the intent. The difficulty arises from the one word, not so much equivocal or ambiguous, as plainly out of place and unintended. If that word were really equivocal, leaving it doubtful whether the statute was intended for cities, towns and villages, or for towns and villages only, the rules invoked might apply. But the word must be rejected in any event. To stop there leaves us with a senseless act. The word is not merely superfluous. Another word was intended, and the context unerringly discloses it.</p>\n<p>\"Criminal statutes are to be strictly construed. But, as said by Mr. Justice Roberts, '. . . . they are not to be subjected to any strained or unnatural construction in order to work exemptions from their penalties.

J. 1131, sec. 670.)</p>\n<p>The claim that \"value\" must be determined, and that there is no one authorized to determine it, is erroneous because the statute provides that the tax is to be \"equal to three per cent of the value of the ores mined,\" and: <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 727</span> </p>\n<p>\"For the purpose of measuring and determining the amount of tax to be paid under the provisions of Section I of this act, the value of ore mined or extracted shall be the amount of money received from the mining or extracting of said ores from said mine or mining claim, after deduction (of numerous items).\" (Sec. 2.)</p>\n<p>Thus, the act is not a property valuation tax as such but an occupation excise tax measured by \"the amount of money received from the mining or extracting of said ores.\"</p>\n<p>The miner files a copy of his statement and pays on that basis. If there is a dispute or refusal to pay court action follows. Certainly the taxpayer may not complain that in the first instance his own return is the basis of computation. No assessment by anyone is called for or is necessary as the legislature has fixed the basis for taxation. Counsel for appellants argue there might be lack of uniformity between different taxpayers in different localities. Two adequate answers immediately suggest themselves: As elsewhere stated, before the court will pass upon such a point it must be actually presented in a real controversy; second, the court action specified in the statute is certainly due process sufficient to make uniform the matter of deductions etc. thus resulting in and leading to uniform taxation.</p>\n<p>The remaining charges of uncertainty rest on no factual basis herein entitling or requiring their present determination. (<em>Standard Oil Co. v. Brodie, supra.</em>)</p>\n<p>Appellants' last attack is that due process is denied because it is asserted the report by the taxpayer is a final and arbitrary fixation of net returns, binding irrespective of the true value thereof, without a hearing, relying on this statement in <em>Oertel Co. v. Glenn</em>, 13 Fed. Supp. 651:</p>\n<p>\"The act here in question measures the tax according to the value of the capital stock of the corporation. The taxpayer is authorized under the provisions of the act to declare the value, but this cannot be arbitrarily done; there must be a basis in fact for its conclusion. If the statute authorizes an arbitrary determination, it would be void for uncertainty. A statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 728</span> \nintelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application it violates the Fifth Amendment.\"</p>\n<p>But the court therein held the provisions in the statute therein considered, similar to the statute herein, were to be construed as permitting correction and allowed recovery for over payment, hence not a denial of due process, stating:</p>\n<p>\"The facts appearing in these proceedings show that there was no proper determination of the value of the capital stock as declared by the plaintiff in its original return, and it further appears that the amended return was filed before excess profits tax liability had accrued. I am of the opinion that the mistake alleged to have been made in the preparation of the original return is one that can be corrected by an amended return if filed before an excess profits tax return is due.\"</p>\n<p>While <em>Wm. B. Scaife  Sons Co. v. Driscoll</em>, 18 Fed. Supp. 748, did not entertain a suit to restrain the collection it did follow <em>Oretel Co. v. Glenn, supra</em>, on the point being considered &#8212; due process &#8212; thus:</p>\n<p>\"As we look at this case, the plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law for the recovery of any taxes it may be compelled to pay, based on a computation made upon the capital stock value given by the plaintiff in its first return rather than its second return. The case of <em>Oertel Co. v. Glenn</em> (D.C.) 13 Fed. Supp. 651, is an example of such a suit at law, brought to recover excess-profits taxes paid under similar provisions of the act of 1933.\"</p>\n<p>If the return is not correct, payment of the tax based on the amount shown in such return would not be payment of \"the tax provided for\" in the statute, and section 1 then gives court action with full opportunity for correct determination of any claimed deduction or allowance, thus fully meeting the requirement of <em>Mays v. District Court</em>, <cross_reference>34 Idaho 200</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>200 Pac. 115</cross_reference>, relied on by appellants, thus:</p>\n<p>\"If the remedy provided by sec. 7036 were intended to be exclusive, the section would be clearly unconstitutional. No person may be deprived of his property without due process of law. (Const. I, sec. 13). Due process of law requires that one be heard before his rights are adjudged.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 729</span> </p>\n<p>Due process derives herein not only from the court action specifically authorized by sec. 8, but there are no such arbitrary provisions herein preventing injunctive relief against over, or under, taxation by the Commissioner unlawful, arbitrary or otherwise, as compelled the holding of partial unconstitutionality of the sales tax statute. (Chap. 12, sec. 6, First Ex. Sess. Laws, 1935) in <em>Johnson v. Diefendorf</em>,<cross_reference>56 Idaho 620</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>630-632</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>57 P.2d 1068</cross_reference>, and the holding therein sustaining the balance of that statute upholds this statute as against appellants' attack in this particular, i. e., denial of due process because of lack of hearing. (See, also, <em>Giragi et</em><em>al. v. Moore</em>, (Ariz.) <cross_reference>64 P.2d 819</cross_reference>, 110 A.L.R. 320.)</p>\n<p>In <em>Barwise v.

Laws, Ex. Sess. 1912, p. 13, I. C. A., 29-601 et seq.) imposed duplicate taxation upon the corporations coming under the provisions of the act, since they were already subject to a property tax. The court said (page 201 of the Idaho report):</p>\n<p>\"The fee required to be collected under the provisions of the statute involved in this case is referred to indiscriminately as a 'license tax' or an 'annual license fee' by the statute, which makes it clear that it is not intended <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 709</span> \nas a property tax. That fact appears from the statute in unmistakable terms. The fee here exacted is clearly an excise tax as usually distinguished from a property tax. It is authorized by that portion of sec. 2, art. 7, of the state constitution which says: 'The legislature may also impose a license tax (both upon natural persons and upon corporations, other than municipal, doing business in this state).' \"</p>\n<p>In <em>Diefendorf v.

The second point was that the statute here considered was in contravention of the federal constitution in that the United States Government had sole control over the land (Indian lands) where the coal was mined and that plaintiffs there contesting the tax, were in effect agents of the federal government, whereby an instrumentality of the federal government was taxed, which question is in no way involved or pertinent herein.

One that every intendment in favor of the constitutionality of a statute must prevail; the other that a tax statute must be strictly construed in favor of the tax payer. The definitive resultant of these two contending forces is that as to the validity of a statute it must be liberally construed to sustain its constitutionality, as to its application (except in certain instances not involved herein) it will be construed in favor of the taxpayer. Aside from the analysis of the statute above set forth giving full effect to the last stated principle, appellants suggest only supposititious situations which will not be considered, since under the record herein they are mere abstract questions.

City of Santa Fe,</em><em>supra;</em> 59 C. J. 1131, sec. 670.)</p>\n<p>The claim that \"value\" must be determined, and that there is no one authorized to determine it, is erroneous because the statute provides that the tax is to be \"equal to three per cent of the value of the ores mined,\" and: <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 727</span> </p>\n<p>\"For the purpose of measuring and determining the amount of tax to be paid under the provisions of Section I of this act, the value of ore mined or extracted shall be the amount of money received from the mining or extracting of said ores from said mine or mining claim, after deduction (of numerous items).\" (Sec. 2.)</p>\n<p>Thus, the act is not a property valuation tax as such but an occupation excise tax measured by \"the amount of money received from the mining or extracting of said ores.\"</p>\n<p>The miner files a copy of his statement and pays on that basis. If there is a dispute or refusal to pay court action follows. Certainly the taxpayer may not complain that in the first instance his own return is the basis of computation. No assessment by anyone is called for or is necessary as the legislature has fixed the basis for taxation. Counsel for appellants argue there might be lack of uniformity between different taxpayers in different localities. Two adequate answers immediately suggest themselves: As elsewhere stated, before the court will pass upon such a point it must be actually presented in a real controversy; second, the court action specified in the statute is certainly due process sufficient to make uniform the matter of deductions etc. thus resulting in and leading to uniform taxation.</p>\n<p>The remaining charges of uncertainty rest on no factual basis herein entitling or requiring their present determination. (<em>Standard Oil Co. v. Brodie, supra.</em>)</p>\n<p>Appellants' last attack is that due process is denied because it is asserted the report by the taxpayer is a final and arbitrary fixation of net returns, binding irrespective of the true value thereof, without a hearing, relying on this statement in <em>Oertel Co. v. Glenn</em>, 13 Fed. Supp. 651:</p>\n<p>\"The act here in question measures the tax according to the value of the capital stock of the corporation. The taxpayer is authorized under the provisions of the act to declare the value, but this cannot be arbitrarily done; there must be a basis in fact for its conclusion. If the statute authorizes an arbitrary determination, it would be void for uncertainty. A statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 728</span> \nintelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application it violates the Fifth Amendment.\"</p>\n<p>But the court therein held the provisions in the statute therein considered, similar to the statute herein, were to be construed as permitting correction and allowed recovery for over payment, hence not a denial of due process, stating:</p>\n<p>\"The facts appearing in these proceedings show that there was no proper determination of the value of the capital stock as declared by the plaintiff in its original return, and it further appears that the amended return was filed before excess profits tax liability had accrued. I am of the opinion that the mistake alleged to have been made in the preparation of the original return is one that can be corrected by an amended return if filed before an excess profits tax return is due.\"</p>\n<p>While <em>Wm. B. Scaife  Sons Co. v. Driscoll</em>, 18 Fed. Supp. 748, did not entertain a suit to restrain the collection it did follow <em>Oretel Co. v. Glenn, supra</em>, on the point being considered &#8212; due process &#8212; thus:</p>\n<p>\"As we look at this case, the plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law for the recovery of any taxes it may be compelled to pay, based on a computation made upon the capital stock value given by the plaintiff in its first return rather than its second return. The case of <em>Oertel Co. v. Glenn</em> (D.C.) 13 Fed. Supp. 651, is an example of such a suit at law, brought to recover excess-profits taxes paid under similar provisions of the act of 1933.\"</p>\n<p>If the return is not correct, payment of the tax based on the amount shown in such return would not be payment of \"the tax provided for\" in the statute, and section 1 then gives court action with full opportunity for correct determination of any claimed deduction or allowance, thus fully meeting the requirement of <em>Mays v.

Due process of law requires that one be heard before his rights are adjudged.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 729</span> </p>\n<p>Due process derives herein not only from the court action specifically authorized by sec. 8, but there are no such arbitrary provisions herein preventing injunctive relief against over, or under, taxation by the Commissioner unlawful, arbitrary or otherwise, as compelled the holding of partial unconstitutionality of the sales tax statute.

      "attorneys": "Hawley  Worthwine, for Appellants.\n\nThe act does not apply to placer mining operations excepting in the remote case of a lode miner engaged in extracting ores from a placer claim and none of the plaintiffs are engaged in mining or extracting ores, but on the contrary are solely engaged in extracting gold and silver from gravel and sand deposits, not in any sense ores. (Sec. 23, tit. 30, U.S.C.A.; sec. 35, tit. 30, U.S.C.A.;  Cole v. Ralph ,  252 U.S. 286 , 40 Sup. Ct. 321 ,  64 L. ed. 567 ; Morrison on Mining Rights, p. 252; United States v. Iron Silver Min. Co. et al. ,  128 U.S. 673 , 9 Sup. Ct. 195 ,  32 L. ed. 571 .)\n\nThe act confers legislative power and duty upon others than the senate and house of representatives of the state of Idaho against the provisions of section 1 of article 3 of the constitution of the state of Idaho. ( State v. Nelson ,  36 Idaho 713 , 213 P. 358 ;  State v. Purcell ,  39 Idaho 642 ,  228 P. 796 ; Westphal v. Westphal ,  122 Cal.App. 379 ,  10 P.2d 119 .)\n\nThe title of the act is insufficient and in conflict with section 3 of article 16 of the constitution of the state of Idaho. ( Jackson v. Gallet ,  39 Idaho 382 ,  228 P. 1068 ;  Federal  Reserve Bank v. Citizens' Bank  Trust Co. ,  53 Idaho 316 , 23 P.2d 735 .)\n\nThe act violates section 6 of article 7 of the constitution of the state of Idaho in that it provides a special tax for the benefit of municipal corporations, to wit, independent school districts. (1919 C. S., sec. 824;  School District v. Twin  Falls, etc. ,  30 Idaho 400 ,  164 P. 1174 ;  State v. Davey , 27 Ariz. 254 ,  232 P. 884 ;  Joint School Dist. No. 132 v. Dabney , 127 Okl. 234 ,  260 P. 486 ;  State v. Wilson ,  65 Kan. 237 , 69 Pac. 172 .)\n\nThe act imposes duplicate taxation upon the same property resulting in lack of equality and uniformity of the tax against the provisions of section 5 of article 7 of the Idaho constitution. ( Oregon Short Line R. Co. v. Washington County et  al. ,  54 Idaho 171 ,  30 P.2d 198 ;  Humbird Lumber Co. v.  Kootenai County ,  10 Idaho 490 ,  79 P. 396 ;  Independent H. Dist.  No. 2 v. Ada County ,  24 Idaho 416 ,  431 ,  134 P. 542 ;  Hettinger  v. Good Roads Dist. No. 1 ,  19 Idaho 313 ,  319 ,  113 P. 721 ; Diefendorf v. Gallet ,  51 Idaho 619 ,  640 ,  10 P.2d 307 .)\n\nJ.W. Taylor, Attorney General, and Ariel L. Crowley, Assistant Attorney General, for Respondents.\n\nThe term \"ore\" is amply broad, when used in context with the words \"placer mining\" to include metals recovered by hydraulic placer mining operations. (New Funk  Wagnall's Standard Dictionary, title \"Ore\"; Webster's New International Unabridged Dictionary, title, \"Ore\"; 16 Encyclopedia Britannica, title \" Ore Deposits,\" p. 874; 16 Encyclopedia Britannica, title \"Ore Dressing,\" p. 880; Costigan's Mining Law, p. 109, note 26; Alameda Min. Co. V. Success, etc., Min. Co. ,  29 Idaho 618 , 161 Pac. 862 ;  249 U.S. 622 ,  39 Sup. Ct. 385 ,  63 L. ed. 806 ; 30 U.S.C.A., sec. 35.)\n\nIn construing a statute, in order to give it effect, the court may look beyond its literal language to determine the legislative intent and give effect thereto. ( Hamilton v.  Swendsen ,  46 Idaho 175 ,  267 P. 229 ;  Smallwood v. Jeter , 42 Idaho 169 ,  244 P. 149 .)\n\nChapter 65, 1935 First Extraordinary Session Laws imposes an excise upon a privilege and is not a tax upon property. ( Utah Power  Light Co. v. Pfost ,  52 Fed. (2d) 226 , 286 U.S. 165 ,  52 Sup. Ct. 548 ,  76 L. ed. 1038 ;  Northern Pac. Ry. Co. v.  Gifford ,  25 Idaho 196 ,  136 P. 1131 ;  In re Kessler ,  26 Idaho 764 , 146 P. 113 , Ann. Cas. 1917A, 228, L.R.A. 1915D, 322; J. C. Penney Co. v. Diefendorf ,  54 Idaho 374 ,  32 P.2d 784 ; Diefendorf v. Gallet ,  51 Idaho 619 ,  10 P.2d 307 .)\n\nThe state may lawfully impose at the same time a tax by valuation and a privilege tax, and this is not double taxation. ( Garrett Trans.  Stor. Co. v. Pfost ,  54 Idaho 576 ,, 229; 1 Cooley on Taxation, 226.)\n\nThe legislature may impose double excises and still not violate the constitution under the circumstances here. ( Washington Water Power Co. v. Shoshone County , 270 Fed. 377; Hanley v. Federal Min.  S. Co. , 235 Fed. 769;  People v.  Henderson ,  12 Colo. 369 ,  21 P. 144 ;  National Savings  Loan  Assn. v. Gillis ,  35 Fed. (2d) 386 .)\n\nThe title to the act is sufficient, indicating clearly the legislative intention to impose a tax and provide for its distribution in the treasury of the state. ( Twin Falls Bank   Trust Co. v. Pringle ,  55 Idaho 451 ,  43 P.2d 515 ;  In re  Crane ,  27 Idaho 671 ,  688 ,  151 P. 1006 , L.R.A. 1918A, 942.)\n\nSchool districts are not municipal corporations within constitution, article 7, section 6. ( Fenton v. Board of County  Commrs. , 20 Ida.. 392, 119 P. 41;  Barton v. Alexander , 27 Idaho 286 ,  148 P. 471 , Ann. Cas. 1917D, 729; Const., art. 9, sec. 1.)",
