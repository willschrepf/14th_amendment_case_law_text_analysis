Code, § 4502, subd. (a))1 and assault by an inmate by means likely to cause great\nbodily injury (§ 4501). The trial court found true three prior strike allegations. (§§ 667,\nsubds. (b)-(i), 1170.12.) The trial court sentenced defendant to consecutive terms of 25\nyears to life on each count. In an unpublished opinion, this court affirmed the judgment.\n(People v. Valdez (May 13, 2003, C038924) [nonpub. opn.] slip opn. at pp. 1-11 (Slip\nOpn.).)\n       Defendant appeals from the trial court’s denial of his petition for recall of sentence\nunder the Three Strikes Reform Act of 2012 (enacted by Prop. 36, as approved by voters,\nGen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012); §§ 667, 1170.12, 1170.126 (Proposition 36 or the Act)). As to\neach conviction, defendant asserts that: (1) the trial court was not authorized to make\nfindings of fact and the People were required to plead and prove any disqualifying facts\nin the prosecution of his commitment offense; (2) substantial evidence did not support the\ntrial court’s determinations regarding his ineligibility; and (3) the trial court employed the\nwrong standard of proof, in that it should have applied the “clear and convincing\nevidence” standard rather than the “preponderance of the evidence” standard. Defendant\nalso asserts that, if we conclude that he is eligible for resentencing on one conviction but\nineligible on the other, he should be resentenced on the eligible offense.\n       In the published part of this opinion we conclude there was substantial evidence\nsupporting the trial court’s determination that defendant was “armed” with the sharp\ninstrument in prison. Defendant had the weapon available for use while he possessed it\nin his cell and the fact that the weapon was seized from his cell by correctional officers\nwhile defendant was away taking a shower does not make defendant eligible for\nresentencing under Proposition 36. Possession of a weapon can be a continuing offense.\n\n\n\n1 Further undesignated statutory references are to the Penal Code in effect at the relevant\ntimes.\n\n                                              2\n\fConsequently, a person is armed with a weapon for purposes of the Proposition 36\nresentencing exception if the evidence from the record of conviction establishes that he or\nshe was present with the weapon and had it available for use at any time he or she had\nactual or constructive possession of it within the time period for which the defendant was\ncharged and convicted.\n       In the unpublished parts of this opinion, we discuss and reject defendant’s other\ncontentions.\n       We affirm.\n                  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n                                   Current Convictions2\n       Possession of a Sharp Instrument in Prison (§ 4502)\n       “In December 1998, Correctional Officer Kevin Keene was working as a floor\nofficer in the administrative segregation section of ‘six block’ of the California State\nPrison, Sacramento. While defendant and codefendant Jose Alberto Dubon were away\ntaking showers, Keene conducted a routine search of their cell. The cell had two bunks\nand a toilet on the right-hand side and upper and lower cubicles on the left-hand side.\n\n\n\n\n2  The factual background relating to defendant’s underlying convictions is derived from\nthis court’s unpublished opinion affirming the judgment. (Slip Opn., supra, at pp. 1-11;\nsee People v. Guilford (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 651, 660-661 (Guilford) [prior appellate\nopinion admissible to prove ineligibility in section 1170.126 proceedings].) Defendant\nmoved to augment the record on appeal to include the entire record in his appeal from the\nunderlying convictions and we treated that motion as a motion to incorporate by\nreference that record and granted the motion. Defendant relies upon facts from testimony\nin the trial transcript in his appellate briefing. Although defendant did not present the\ntranscript from his trial to the trial court in connection with his petition for resentencing,\nwe have considered the cited testimony as well as other testimony in the trial transcript as\nif he had. (See People v. Blakely (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1042, 1063 (Blakely) [the trial\ncourt may examine relevant, reliable, admissible portions of the record of conviction to\ndetermine the existence or nonexistence of disqualifying factors].) We discuss the other\ntestimony from the trial transcript in our discussion, post.\n\n                                              3\n\f        “In the upper cubicle, Keene found a long stiff straight object wrapped in plastic.\nWhen he unwrapped it, Keene saw that the object was an ‘altered toothbrush with razor\nmelted’ into the handle, ‘with cardboard cover piece, . . . two pieces of clear cellophane\nplastic.’ Keene confiscated the object, put it into evidence, and notified the sergeant of\nhis discovery. No inmates other than defendant and Dubon would have been allowed in\ntheir cell.\n        “Keene testified that inmates in administrative segregation are not allowed to have\ndisposable razors or sharp metal objects. Inmates in the general population are allowed\nto have razors but are not allowed to alter them or remove them from their plastic\ncasings. . . . Keene was not sure which inmate ordinarily used the upper cubicle.” (Slip\nOpn., supra, at pp. 2-3, fn. omitted.) We set forth additional facts regarding this offense\nin our discussion, post.\n        Assault by Inmate by Means Likely to Cause Great Bodily Injury (§ 4501)\n        “Several months after the incident in count three, defendant, Dubon, and two other\ninmates were seen assaulting a newer inmate. Defendant struck the victim from the back\nat about the same time that Dubon struck him in the front. Defendant and Dubon kicked\nthe victim with ‘full force kicks.’ Both men ignored Correctional Officer Ernest\nJohnson’s order to stop fighting and were undeterred when he fired a special gun that\nshot rubber grommets. When Johnson resorted to tear gas, the inmates dispersed. At that\npoint, the victim was on the ground and was not moving. He later regained\nconsciousness and tried to stand but fell down a couple of times. He suffered multiple\ninjuries to his face and head, including a large hematoma to his right forehead, an open\ncontusion on his right forehead, a bloody nose, multiple bruising to his upper face, blood\nin his mouth, a shoe imprint on the left side of his face, and abrasions on both knees and\nelbows.” (Slip Opn., supra, at pp. 3-4.)\n\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f                                Petition for Resentencing\n       In 2014, defendant filed a petition for recall of his sentence pursuant to section\n1170.126 which is part of the Act. Defendant asserted that, under section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (e)(1), his convictions of possession of a sharp instrument while in prison\n(§ 4502, subd. (a)) and assault by a prisoner by means of force likely to produce great\nbodily injury (§ 4501) were neither serious felonies within the meaning of section 1192.7,\nnor violent felonies within the meaning of section 667.5, and therefore these convictions\ndid not render him ineligible for resentencing under the Act. Defendant also asserted\nthat, in violating sections 4501 and 4502, subdivision (a), he was not armed with a\nfirearm or deadly weapon, did not use a firearm or deadly weapon, and he did not intend\nto cause great bodily injury to another person within the meaning of section 667,\nsubdivision (e)(2)(C)(iii), and therefore he was not ineligible for resentencing under the\nAct. (§ 1170.126, subd. (e)(2).) Defendant further asserted that these convictions did not\notherwise render him ineligible for relief. Thus, according to defendant, he satisfied all\nof the criteria for resentencing under the Act, and requested that the trial court resentence\nhim as a second strike offender.\n                             Trial Court’s Denial of Petition\n       The trial court rejected each of defendant’s contentions and denied the petition.\nWe discuss post the court’s factual findings concerning each conviction and its\ndetermination of resentencing ineligibility based on those findings.\n       The trial court also rejected defendant’s contention that, if it were to make findings\nof fact relevant to issues, it would violate the mandate of Apprendi v. New Jersey (2000)\n530 U.S. 466 [147 L.Ed.2d 435] that findings of fact that may result in an increase in\npunishment must be made by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The court ruled that\nApprendi does not apply to section 1170.126 resentencing proceedings because\nresentencing pursuant to that section would constitute a downward departure from a\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\fpreviously imposed sentence, and there is no requirement that disqualifying factors must\nhave previously been pleaded and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\n       The trial court also ruled that its conclusion as to either conviction rendered\ndefendant ineligible for resentencing under the Act. In this regard, the trial court\nfollowed those cases which had concluded that a defendant is ineligible for resentencing\nunder the Act if any of the defendant’s current convictions render him or her ineligible,\nalthough the court noted that the issue was pending before our high court at the time.3\n       Accordingly, the trial court denied defendant’s petition for resentencing.\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n                                        I.   The Act\n       “Prior to its amendment by the Act, the Three Strikes law required that a\ndefendant who had two or more prior convictions of violent or serious felonies receive a\nthird strike sentence of a minimum of 25 years to life for any current felony conviction,\neven if the current offense was neither serious nor violent. [Citations.] The Act amended\nthe Three Strikes law with respect to defendants whose current conviction is for a felony\nthat is neither serious nor violent. In that circumstance, unless an exception applies, the\ndefendant is to receive a second strike sentence of twice the term otherwise provided for\nthe current felony, pursuant to the provisions that apply when a defendant has one prior\nconviction for a serious or violent felony.” (Johnson, supra, 61 Cal.4th at pp. 680-681.)\n\n\n\n3  In People v. Johnson (2015) 61 Cal.4th 674 (Johnson), decided after the trial court’s\ndetermination here, our high court concluded that “the Act requires an inmate’s eligibility\nfor resentencing . . . be evaluated on a count-by-count basis,” and that “resentencing is\nallowed with respect to a count that is neither serious nor violent, despite the presence of\nanother count that is serious or violent.” (Johnson, at pp. 679, 688, 694-695.) Thus, our\nhigh court rejected the approach adopted by the trial court here that a single ineligible\nconviction rendered the defendant ineligible for resentencing under the Act on other\nconvictions. In any event, as we discuss post, Johnson is of no moment because\ndefendant is ineligible for resentencing on both convictions.\n\n                                              6\n\f       “The Act’s exceptions to the new sentencing provisions relate to a defendant’s\ncurrent offense and prior offenses.” (Johnson, supra, 61 Cal.4th at p. 681.) These\nexceptions are set forth in sections 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C), and 1170.12,\nsubdivision (c)(2)(C). (Johnson, at p. 681.)\n       The Act addressed both prospective sentencing and retrospective resentencing.\nThis case involves retrospective resentencing. “In addition to reducing the sentence to be\nimposed for some third strike felonies that are neither violent nor serious, the Act\nprovides a procedure by which some prisoners already serving third strike sentences may\nseek resentencing in accordance with the new sentencing rules. [Citation.] ‘An inmate is\neligible for resentencing if . . . . [¶] . . . [t]he inmate is serving an indeterminate term of\nlife imprisonment imposed pursuant to [the Three Strikes law] for a conviction of a\nfelony or felonies that are not defined as serious and/or violent . . . .’ [Citation.] Like a\ndefendant who is being sentenced under the new provisions, an inmate is disqualified\nfrom resentencing if any of the exceptions set forth in section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)\nand section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(C) are present.” (Johnson, supra, 61 Cal.4th at\np. 682.)\n       The specific exceptions applicable in this case are: “[d]uring the commission of\nthe current offense, the defendant . . . was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or\nintended to cause great bodily injury to another person.” (§ 667, subd. (c)(2)(C)(iii);\n1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(C)(iii), italics added.)\n                          II.    Pleading and Proof Requirement\n       Defendant asserts that the People were required to plead and prove disqualifying\nfacts at trial on the current convictions, and that a court considering a petition under the\nAct cannot make new findings of fact resulting in the denial of the petition. We disagree.\n       As this court said in People v. Guilford (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 651 (Guilford):\n“Because the electorate required pleading and proof of these disqualifying facts in the\nprospective part of the Act, but not the retrospective part, we presume the intention was\n\n                                                 7\n\fto dispense with a pleading and proof requirement in the latter case.” (Guilford, at\np. 657.) Contrary to defendant’s contention, the fact that the resentencing portion of the\nAct cross-references the prospective portions does not necessarily lead to the conclusion\nthat the electorate intended to impose a pleading and proof requirement for resentencing.\nIn many cases, the relevant factors would not have been adjudicated in the current case,\nresulting in undermining one purpose of Proposition 36—to preclude dangerous persons\nfrom the recall provision. (Guilford, at p. 658.) Rather, it is appropriate in considering a\nrecall petition for the trial court to consider the facts of the crime, as shown by the record,\nin making a determination as to whether the defendant is ineligible. (Id. at p. 659.) Thus,\nas defendant acknowledges, this court has agreed with the conclusion that “[t]he\nrequirement of pleading and proof for prospective application of the Act, and the absence\nof such requirement for retrospective application, indicates that pleading and proof is not\na requirement for the latter.” (Guilford, at p. 659.)\n       Recently, the Court of Appeal for the Second Appellate District, Division Two,\naddressed a defendant’s argument that the trial court considering his Proposition 36\npetition “was not permitted ‘to make a brand new factual finding of intent’ and could not\n‘make new findings that went beyond the “nature or basis” of the conviction.’ ” (People\nv. Newman (2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 718, 723 (Newman), review granted November 22,\n2016, S237491.) The Newman court clarified: “The gist of [the defendant’s] claim of\nerror is unless the disqualifying factor, e.g., ‘intent to cause great bodily injury,’ is an\nelement of the current crime or a sentence enhancement allegation found true by the jury,\nthe court is not empowered to find such factor exists.” (Ibid.) The Newman court\ndisagreed. (Ibid.) The court stated that, unlike the determination of the defendant’s guilt\nor innocence of the underlying charges, “the existence of a disqualifying factor that\nwould render a defendant ineligible for resentencing under Proposition 36, which would\nlessen his punishment if he were eligible, is a determination solely within the province of\nthe Proposition 36 court to make without regard to any factual finding by the trier of\n\n                                               8\n\ffact.” (Newman, at p. 724.) “[A] Proposition 36 court may determine whether one or\nmore of these disqualifying factors exists independent of the elements of the current\noffense and any attendant sentence enhancement allegation.” (Newman, at p. 726.)\n       The court in Newman observed that there was no requirement on the face of\nProposition 36 that disqualifying factors must be an element of the crimes of conviction,\nor that they must be pled and proved to the trier of fact. (Newman, supra, 2 Cal.App.5th\nat p. 724.) The court stated: “Its plain and clear language reflects a contrary intent.\nSubdivision (f) of section 1170.126 expressly provides: ‘Upon receiving a petition for\nrecall of sentence under this section, the court shall determine whether the petitioner\nsatisfies the criteria in subdivision (e).’ ” (Newman, at p. 724.) Additionally, the\nNewman court held that the disqualifying factors were not required to be determined by a\njury because they do not have the effect of increasing punishment. (Ibid.) On the\ncontrary, Proposition 36 has the effect of decreasing a defendant’s punishment, and\ntherefore it constituted “ ‘ “an act of lenity.” ’ ” (Newman, at p. 724.) As such, the\nNewman court concluded Apprendi v. New Jersey (2000) 530 U.S. 466 [147 L.Ed.2d 435]\nand the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial were not implicated. (Newman, at p. 724.)\n       “[T]he Proposition 36 court is authorized to make its factual findings regarding a\ndisqualifying factor based on the record of conviction.” (Newman, supra, 2 Cal.App.5th\nat p. 725.) “ ‘[A] . . . court determining eligibility for resentencing under the Act is not\nlimited to a consideration of the elements of the current offense and the evidence that was\npresented at the trial (or plea proceedings) at which the defendant was convicted. Rather,\nthe court may examine relevant, reliable, admissible portions of the record of conviction\nto determine the existence or nonexistence of disqualifying factors. [Citation.] This is\nconsistent with voters’ intent.’ ” (Newman, at p. 726, quoting Blakely, supra, 225\nCal.App.4th at p. 1063.)\n       More recently, the Fifth Appellate District agreed with Newman on this point.\n“Simply put, the trial court takes the facts from the record of conviction and determines,\n\n                                              9\n\ffrom its interpretation of those facts, whether a petitioner is eligible for resentencing.”\n(People v. Perez (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 812, 832-833 (Perez), review granted Jan. 11, 2017,\nS238354.)\n        We agree with the analysis in Newman and Perez and adopt it as our own. Thus,\nwe reject defendant’s contentions that the People had the burden of pleading and proving\nat trial all disqualifying facts and that the trial court was not authorized to make findings\nof fact.\n\n                           III.   Applicable Standard of Proof\n        Defendant asserts that, even if the trial court had the authority to make new\nfindings of fact, and even if there was substantial evidence to support its findings, the\ntrial court should have employed the “clear and convincing evidence” standard of proof\nrather than the “preponderance of the evidence” standard. In making this assertion,\ndefendant relies on a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals case,4 as well as a concurring\nopinion5 from this court.6 The court in Newman rejected this contention (Newman,\nsupra, 2 Cal.App.5th at p. 728), and so do we.\n        As noted by the Newman court: “To date, no reviewing court has embraced the\nclear and convincing evidence standard as the standard of proof applicable to a\nProposition 36 resentencing disability finding. Rather, the battle lines have been drawn\nwith beyond a reasonable doubt, on one side, and preponderance of the evidence, on the\nother. The published appellate court opinions espousing a standard of proof thus far have\nall come down on the side of preponderance of the evidence, except for one, [People v.\n\n\n\n4   United States v. Pineda-Doval (9th Cir. 2010) 614 F.3d 1019.\n5 People v. Bradford (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 1322, 1344-1351 (conc. opn. of Raye,\nP.J.).\n6 While relying on these opinions in advancing his argument, defendant correctly\nacknowledges that they are not binding authority on this court.\n\n                                              10\n\fArevalo (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 836 (Arevalo)], in which the court embraced the beyond\na reasonable doubt standard of proof. We decline to follow Arevalo and conclude the\nappropriate standard of proof is preponderance of the evidence.” (Newman, supra, 2\nCal.App.5th at p. 728.) In our view, the reasoning in Newman is persuasive. (Id. at\npp. 727-732; accord Perez, supra, 3 Cal.App.5th at p. 833; People v. Frierson (2016) 1\nCal.App.5th 788 (Frierson), review granted Oct. 19, 2016, S236728; People v. Osuna\n(2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1020, 1040.)7 Accordingly, we agree that the preponderance of\nthe evidence is the appropriate and applicable standard of proof.8 Thus, contrary to\ndefendant’s contention, we conclude that the trial court employed the proper standard of\nproof.\n    IV.     Sufficiency of the Evidence Supporting the Ineligibility Determinations\n                                     A. Standard of Review\n         We review the factual basis for the trial court’s finding of resentencing\nineligibility under the substantial evidence test. We review the whole record in a light\nmost favorable to the order to determine whether it contains substantial evidence, i.e.,\nevidence that is credible and of solid value, from which a rational trier of fact could find\nineligibility by a preponderance of the evidence. (See Guilford, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th\nat p. 661 [applying the substantial evidence test to a determination of resentence\nineligibility under the Act]; accord, People v. Perez (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 812, 833,\n\n\n\n\n7 The Newman court addressed at length both the statutory standard of proof and the\nconstitutionally required standard of proof, concluding that proof by a preponderance of\nthe evidence was prescribed as to both.\n8 This issue is now before the California Supreme Court. Our high court has granted\nreview in Newman, supra, 2 Cal.App.5th 718, and Frierson, supra, 1 Cal.App.5th 788.\nIn granting review in Frierson, our high court stated that the issue to be briefed and\nargued was “[w]hat is the standard of proof for a finding of ineligibility for resentencing\nunder Proposition 36.”\n\n                                              11\n\freview granted Jan. 11, 2017, S238354; People v. Newman (2016) 2 Cal.App.4th 718,\n727 (Newman), review granted Nov. 22, 2016, S237491.)\n     B. Possession of a Sharp Instrument in Prison - Armed with a Deadly Weapon\n       Defendant asserts that the trial court’s determination that he was armed with a\ndeadly weapon when he violated section 4502, possession of a sharp instrument in\nprison,9 was not supported by substantial evidence. We disagree.\n       1. The Trial Court’s Ruling\n       The trial court found that defendant was armed with a deadly weapon within the\nmeaning of section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iii). The court stated that, in this context,\nto be “ ‘armed with a deadly weapon’ ” means that a person has “the deadly weapon\navailable for use, either offensively or defensively.” In concluding that the circumstances\nhere satisfied this requirement, the trial court stated: “Here, defendant . . . and [his]\ncellmate . . . were only gone briefly from their cell, to take a shower; otherwise, the two\nand only those two spent most of their time in that cell. As the possession was ongoing,\nand defendant . . . most of the time was present in the cell and so near to the weapon as to\nhave it available to him offensively or defensively during the times of his possession, he\nclearly was ‘armed’ with the deadly weapon when he was committing the offense.”\nAccordingly, the court concluded that defendant was ineligible for resentencing on this\nconviction under the Act.\n       2. Analysis\n       “A defendant is armed if the defendant has the specified weapon available for use,\neither offensively or defensively.” (People v. Bland (1995) 10 Cal.4th 991, 997 (Bland).)\n\n\n\n\n9 Section 4502, subdivision (a), provides in pertinent part: “Every person who, while at\nor confined in any penal institution, while being conveyed to or from any penal\ninstitution, or while under the custody of officials, officers, or employees of any penal\ninstitution, possesses . . . [a] sharp instrument . . . is guilty of a felony.”\n\n                                              12\n\f“ ‘ “[I]t is the availability—the ready access—of the weapon that constitutes arming.” ’ ”\n(People v. White (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 512, 524 (M. White), quoting Bland, at p. 997,\n& People v. Mendival (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 562, 574.)\n       In Bland, supra, 10 Cal.4th 991, our high court described the issue presented in the\ncase as follows: “is a defendant convicted of a possessory drug offense subject to this\n‘arming’ enhancement when the defendant possesses both drugs and a gun, and keeps\nthem together, but is not present when the police seize them from the defendant’s house?”\n(Id. at p. 995, italics added.) Police investigating the defendant’s possible involvement in\nthe theft of auto parts searched his house and found rock cocaine in his bedroom closet.\n(Ibid.) Under the bed, they found an assault rifle. (Ibid.) At the time of the search, the\ndefendant was in custody inside a police vehicle parked outside of his house. (Ibid.) The\nopinion does not make note of specifically where defendant was located prior to being\nplaced in the patrol vehicle. The Court of Appeal affirmed the underlying convictions,\nbut reversed the three-year arming enhancement, concluding that the defendant was not\narmed because he was outside of the house when the weapon was found. (Id. at p. 996.)\n       In reversing the Court of Appeal’s decision, the California Supreme Court\nobserved that, by focusing on the defendant’s proximity to the weapon at the time the\npolice found it, the Court of Appeal erred because its temporal focus was too narrow.\n(Bland, supra, 10 Cal.4th at p. 996.) Our high court explained: “[W]hether defendant\nwas ‘armed in the commission’ of the continuing offense of drug possession—it is\nimmaterial whether defendant was present when police seized the assault rifle together\nwith the cache of crack cocaine, so long as he had the firearm available for use in\nfurtherance of the drug offense at any time during his possession of the drugs. From\nevidence that the assault weapon was kept in [the] defendant’s bedroom near the drugs,\nthe jury could reasonably infer that, at some point during the felonious drug possession,\ndefendant was physically present with both the drugs and the weapon, giving him ready\naccess to the assault rifle to aid his commission of the drug offense.” (Id. at p. 1000,\n\n                                             13\n\fitalics added.) In its reasoning, the court emphasized the continuing nature of drug\npossession. (Id. at pp. 999-1000, 1002, 1004.) To summarize, the court wrote: “[W]hen\nthe prosecution has proved a charge of felony drug possession, and the evidence at trial\nshows that a firearm was found in close proximity to the illegal drugs in a place\nfrequented by the defendant, a jury may reasonably infer (1) that the defendant knew of\nthe firearm’s presence, (2) that its presence together with the drugs was not accidental or\ncoincidental, and (3) that, at some point during the period of illegal drug possession, the\ndefendant was present with both the drugs and the firearm and thus that the firearm was\navailable for the defendant to put to immediate use to aid in the drug possession. These\nreasonable inferences, if not refuted by defense evidence, are sufficient to warrant a\ndetermination that the defendant was ‘armed with a firearm in the commission’ of a\nfelony within the meaning of section 12022.” (Bland, at pp. 1002-1003, fn. omitted,\nitalics added.) Thus, in the context of ongoing or continuous possession, our high court\ndoes not require the weapon be readily “available” or available for “immediate use” at the\nvery moment the weapon is found.\n       Here the possessory crime is the possession of a sharp instrument in prison.\nPossessory offenses, such as drug possession or possession of a deadly weapon, are\n“ ‘continuing offense[s], one[s] that extend[] through time” and create criminal liability\n“throughout the entire time the defendant asserts dominion and control.” (Bland, supra,\n10 Cal.4th at p. 999.) Thus, even if it is true that the weapon was not in defendant’s\nactual physical possession at the precise time it was discovered, this does not necessarily\nundermine a finding that he was armed with the deadly weapon at other relevant times so\nas to support the trial court’s determination. The instant case, where the weapon is stored\nin an inmate’s cell, is an example of continuing or ongoing possession. Indeed, the\ndiscovery of the weapon in defendant’s cell presents a stronger case for a finding that he\nwas armed than the circumstances in Bland because defendant, an administrative\nsegregation prisoner, spent the vast majority of his time in the cell where the weapon was\n\n                                             14\n\fdiscovered, whereas it is not clear how much time the defendant in Bland spent in his\nbedroom where police discovered the assault rifle.\n       Moreover, similar to the situation in Bland, there is a safety risk here. The Bland\ncourt explained that “[t]he crime scene in a drug possession case is the place where the\ndefendant keeps his or her cache of illegal drugs. A firearm kept near the drugs creates\nan ongoing risk of serious injury or death from use of the weapon to protect the defendant\nduring a drug sale, to guard against theft of the drugs, or to ward off police. Yet\ndefendant would have us ignore the continuing nature of that risk.” (Bland, supra, 10\nCal.4th at pp. 1001-1002.) Like in Bland, we should not ignore the continuing nature of\nthe safety risk here. (Id. at p. 1002.) Possession of a weapon by a state prisoner creates a\ncontinuing risk of serious injury or death to other inmates and staff and jeopardizes the\nsecurity of the facility. Thus, incarcerated felons who possess such weapons are\nparticularly dangerous. And as we shall discuss post, the electorate was particularly\nconcerned with keeping dangerous felons incarcerated when it enacted Proposition 36.\n       People v. Delgadillo (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 1570 (Delgadillo), is another\nexample of the situation where, even though the defendant was not present when a\nweapon was found, the court held that he was armed because the weapon had earlier been\navailable for use in furtherance of the drug offenses during the commission of those\ncrimes. In Delgadillo, law enforcement followed the defendant from his house and\nstopped him some distance away on a freeway. (Id. at p. 1572.) Law enforcement then\nexecuted a search warrant at his house. Two guns were found in the headboard of the\ndefendant’s bed and methamphetamine, cash, and indicia of methamphetamine sale and\nmanufacturing were found elsewhere inside the home and in a car parked outside. (Id. at\np. 1573.) The Delgadillo court followed the Bland court’s reasoning concerning the\ncontinuing nature of drug possession, noting “the crime of drug possession is ‘a\n“continuing” offense, one that extends through time . . . [a]nd when, at any time during\nthe commission of the felony drug possession, the defendant can resort to a firearm to\n\n                                             15\n\ffurther that offense, the defendant satisfies the statutory language of being “armed with a\nfirearm in the commission . . . of a felony.” ’ ” (Delgadillo, at p. 1574, italics added.)\nFocusing the temporal analysis of arming on occasions prior to his arrest, the court held\nthat the firearms were available for defendant to use offensively or defensively “at any\ntime during the manufacturing process,” even though that process took place over time\nand at different locations. (Id. at pp. 1574-1575, italics added.)\n       It is true that Bland and Delgadillo are “armed in the commission” cases and that\nthe Bland court noted “ ‘in the commission’ ” (italics added) means “any time during and\nin furtherance of the felony.” (Bland, supra, 10 Cal.4th at p. 1001.) Because section\n1170.126 requires only that the arming be “during” the commission of the crime, there is\nno facilitative nexus requirement as when the arming must also be in furtherance of a\nfelony. (People v. Hicks (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 275, 283-284 (Hicks) [crime of\npossession of firearm by a felon precludes section 1170.126 relief under the arming\nprohibition]; accord, People v. White (2016) 243 Cal.App.4th 1354, 1362-1363 (T. White)\n[same]; People v. Osuna (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1020, 1032 (Osuna) [same].)\n       In Hicks, a published case of this court, parole agents and police officers\napproaching an apartment complex looking for a parolee at large encountered the\ndefendant and two companions. (Hicks, supra, 231 Cal.App.4th at p. 280.) After the\ndefendant removed a clear plastic bag from his sweatpants and threw it away, officers\nfrisked him and found five .380-caliber bullets. (Ibid.) Additionally, an officer retrieved\nthe clear bag and discovered that it contained rock cocaine. (Ibid.) Officers proceeded to\nthe apartment defendant and his companions were there to visit, and, in that apartment,\nthey found a backpack containing a loaded .380-caliber handgun. (Ibid.) Two witnesses,\nwho subsequently gave inconsistent testimony, told the police that the defendant had left\nthe backpack in the apartment. (Id. at pp. 280-281.) This court affirmed the trial court’s\ndetermination that the defendant was ineligible for resentencing because he was armed\nwith a firearm when he committed the crime of being a felon in possession of a firearm.\n\n                                             16\n\f(Id. at pp. 279-280.) The Hicks court stated: “unlike section 12022, which requires that a\ndefendant be armed ‘in the commission of’ a felony for additional punishment to be\nimposed . . . , the Act disqualifies an inmate from eligibility for lesser punishment if he or\nshe was armed with a firearm ‘[d]uring the commission of’ the current offense.” (Hicks,\nat pp. 283-284.) “Thus, there must be a temporal nexus between the arming and the\nunderlying felony, not a facilitative one. The two are not the same.” (Id. at p. 284, citing\nBland, supra, 10 Cal.4th at p. 1002.) The Hicks court continued: “Following this\nreasoning, defendant was armed with a firearm during his possession of the gun, but not\n‘in the commission’ of his crime of possession. There was no facilitative nexus; his\nhaving the firearm available for use did not further his illegal possession of it. There was,\nhowever, a temporal nexus. Since the Act uses the phrase ‘[d]uring the commission of\nthe current offense,’ and not ‘in the commission of’ the current offense [citations], and\nsince at issue is not the imposition of additional punishment but rather eligibility for\nreduced punishment, we conclude the plain language of the Act disqualifies an inmate\nfrom resentencing if he or she was armed with a firearm during the unlawful possession\nof that firearm. [¶] Here, the trial court stated it found beyond a reasonable doubt that\ndefendant was personally armed with the firearm he was convicted of possessing. There\nwas sufficient evidence to support this finding based on the initial statements of the two\nrecanting witnesses . . . that it was defendant who had the backpack with the gun inside\nand put it in the tenant’s apartment.” (Hicks, at p. 284.)\n       Similarly, here, defendant was armed with the deadly weapon during his\ncommission of possession of a sharp instrument in prison. Contrary to defendant’s\ncontention, the possession of the weapon need not facilitate another felony, e.g., drug\npossession or drug manufacturing. We need only look to whether the inmate was armed\nduring the possession of the weapon. Further, we see no need to reconsider, as urged by\ndefendant, this court’s determination in Hicks that “there must be a temporal nexus\nbetween the arming and the underlying felony, not a facilitative one.” (Hicks, supra, 231\n\n                                             17\n\fCal.App.4th at p. 284.) As we have noted, other courts are in accord. (T. White, supra,\n243 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1362-1363; Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1032.)\nAdditionally, on its facts, Hicks provides another example of the fact that a defendant\nneed not be present with the weapon when it is discovered to be deemed “armed” within\nthe meaning of the exception rendering a defendant ineligible for resentencing under the\nAct.\n       More recently, in T. White, supra, 243 Cal.App.4th 1354, a felon in possession of\na firearm prosecution, the Fourth Appellate District, Division Three, observed that “a\ndefendant is armed with a weapon even though it is not carried on his person, when he is\naware it is hidden in a place readily accessible to him.” (Id. at p. 1361.) This precisely\ndescribes the circumstance at issue here. Although the facts in T. White are different, in\nthe instant case the weapon was hidden in a place that was readily accessible to defendant\nwhen he was nearby.\n       In T. White, a police officer spotted the defendant walking down the street\ncarrying a fanny pack. (T. White, supra, 243 Cal.App.4th at p. 1358.) Because the\ndefendant matched the general description of a suspect in an armed robbery, the officer\ndrove his patrol car next to the defendant. (Ibid.) The defendant turned away and walked\ninto the parking lot of a motel, and the officer followed. (Ibid.) The officer lost sight of\nthe defendant but moments later, he saw the defendant walking along the second story\ncorridor of the motel. (Ibid.) The officer got out of his car and asked the defendant to\ncome speak with him and defendant came down the stairs toward the officer. (Ibid.) The\nofficer noted the fanny pack appeared to be less full than it had appeared before. (Ibid.)\nRetracing the defendant’s path, the officer found a loaded nine-millimeter semiautomatic\npistol in a trash can. (Ibid.) A search of the fanny pack revealed two bullets of the same\nmake and caliber as those in the gun. (Ibid.) The defendant testified at trial, denying that\nhe had a firearm when he arrived at the hotel and denying that he placed a firearm in the\ntrash can. (Ibid.) The defendant did admit, however, that he walked by the garbage can.\n\n                                             18\n\f(Ibid.) He testified he had found the two bullets on the motel stairs and picked them up.\n(Ibid.)\n          On appeal from the denial of his Proposition 36 petition, the defendant in T. White\ncontended that his case was different from the situation where the defendant is seen in\nactual possession and thus excluded under the arming exception.10 (T. White, supra, 243\nCal.App.4th at pp. 1357, 1361.) Unlike that situation, according to the defendant, he\ncould not be found to have been armed because the police never saw him discard the\nweapon in the trashcan or otherwise observed him in physical possession of it. (Id. at\np. 1361.) Rejecting that contention, the Court of Appeal reasoned, “it [was] clear [the]\ndefendant’s conviction was based on either the inference he discarded the gun into the\ntrash can on that occasion or he had placed it there earlier. Either way, his possession\namounts to being armed.” (Id. at p. 1357, italics added.) The court explained that the\njury necessarily concluded that the defendant possessed the gun found in the trash can,\nand, in turn, that finding necessarily implied that the defendant was “at least aware it was\nhidden there.” (Id. at p. 1361.) The Court of Appeal reasoned: “When [the] defendant\nwas first approached by the police officer in the street, he turned directly into the motel,\nand assuming he did not have the gun in his fanny pack, he went straight for the trash can\nwhere he knew it was already hidden. And as he walked by that trash can—as he\nconceded he did—that gun was readily accessible to him. That qualifies [the] defendant\nas being ‘armed.’ As our Supreme Court has explained, ‘ “[i]t is the availability—the\nready access—of the weapon that constitutes arming.” ’ ” (Id. at pp. 1361-1362, quoting\nBland, supra, 10 Cal.4th at p. 997.) The T. White court concluded: “So even if the jury\n\n\n\n10 Specifically, the defendant in T. White contended his case was distinguishable from\nM. White, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th 512, where the officers saw defendant carrying rolled\nup sweatpants with an object inside. After defendant threw these items into the back of\nhis pickup truck, the officers recovered them and discovered the object in the sweatpants\nwas a handgun. (M. White, at p. 520.)\n\n                                               19\n\fbelieved [the] defendant’s testimony that he did not bring the gun into the motel on the\noccasion in question, its finding that he had possession of the gun located in the trash can,\ncombined with his admission he walked right by it immediately after the police officer\ndrove alongside him, demonstrates he qualified as armed during that possession.” (T.\nWhite, at p. 1362.)\n       Although the facts here are different, the circumstances are similar. The jury\nnecessarily found that defendant possessed the altered toothbrush with the razor melted\ninto the handle.11 Prior to its discovery, this weapon was readily accessible to defendant\nwhen he was in his cell. As in T. White, supra, 243 Cal.App.4th 1354, the weapon was\nnot discovered on defendant’s person or the immediately surrounding area where the\ndefendant was stopped. However, the evidence supports a finding that defendant was\naware that the weapon was “hidden in a place readily accessible to him.” (Id. at p. 1361.)\nWe also note that both here and in T. White, the defendants were under control of law\nenforcement authorities in a different location when the weapons were discovered.\n       The case law thus teaches us not to limit the temporal focus for arming to the\nmoment when the weapon was discovered; such a focus is too narrow. (Bland, supra, 10\nCal.4th at p. 996 [Court of Appeal erred by focusing too narrowly on the defendant’s\nproximity to the assault weapon at the time police found the cocaine and the assault\nweapon in the defendant’s bedroom].) Possession of a weapon, like drug possession, can\nbe a continuing crime. Thus, when a weapon is available to a defendant to use\noffensively or defensively at any time during the actual or constructive possession of that\n\n\n\n\n11 The dissent comments that “at some unwitnessed point in time [defendant] was\npresumably in the cell with the weapon.” (Italics added.) In our view, this is not a matter\nsubject to speculation and we need not presume this fact. The jury convicted defendant\nof possession of the weapon found in his cell while he was taking a shower, and this court\nrejected his claim of insufficient evidence of possession in his appeal from that\nconviction. (Slip Opn., supra, at pp. 4-6.)\n\n                                             20\n\fweapon within the time period for which a defendant was charged, the defendant was\narmed. (See Bland, at p. 997.) The defendant need not be present at the moment when\nthe weapon is discovered, nor must the weapon be immediately available for his or her\nuse at that very moment.\n       Defendant relies on a hypothetical situation considered in Osuna, supra, 225\nCal.App.4th 1020, as supporting his position. In Osuna, an officer attempted to pull the\ndefendant over after he sped through a school zone. (Id. at p. 1027.) When the defendant\nfinally stopped and exited the car he was driving, he was holding a handgun. (Ibid.) The\ndefendant fled and, approximately 20 minutes later, police arrested him as he exited a\nhouse within the perimeter established by police. (Ibid.) Police searched the house and\nlocated a handgun in the air conditioning duct and its missing magazine outside the\nhome. (Ibid.) Police discovered a second magazine and ammunition in the vehicle the\ndefendant had been driving. (Ibid.) The Osuna court, affirming the denial of the\ndefendant’s Proposition 36 petition, concluded that the defendant was disqualified from\nresentencing under the Act because he was armed with a firearm during the commission\nof the current firearm possession offense. (Osuna, at p. 1040.) The Osuna court stated:\nthe “defendant was actually holding a handgun when he first got out of the car. Thus,\nfactually he was ‘armed with a firearm’ within the meaning of the Act.” (Osuna, at\np. 1030.) In dicta, the Osuna court also wrote: “A firearm can be under a person’s\ndominion and control without it being available for use. For example, suppose a\nparolee’s residence (in which only he lives) is searched and a firearm is found next to his\nbed. The parolee is in possession of the firearm, because it is under his dominion and\ncontrol. If he is not home at the time, however, he is not armed with the firearm, because\nit is not readily available to him for offensive or defensive use. Accordingly, possessing\n\n\n\n\n                                            21\n\fa firearm does not necessarily constitute being armed with a firearm.” (Ibid., fn.\nomitted.)12\n       The Osuna court did not discuss the reasoning in Bland or Delgadillo, cases with\nfacts that closely approximated the facts in the hypothetical. As a result, it does not\nappear that the Osuna court considered the Bland court’s observation that it is\n“immaterial” whether the defendant is present when the authorities find the weapon.\n(Bland, supra, 10 Cal.4th at p. 1000.) Even so, the Osuna hypothetical is inapt.13 Here,\n\n\n\n12  This dicta was recently repeated in another case involving actual possession of a\nfirearm by a felon. (People v. Frutoz (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 171, 177.)\n13  We are aware that other courts have stated that mere possession of a weapon does not\nestablish that the defendant was armed with the weapon because possession can be\nconstructive as well as actual. (See People v. Burnes (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1452,\n1458, citing Blakely, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1057.) In M. White, supra, 223\nCal.App.4th 512, the court stated, “while the act of being armed with a firearm—that is,\nhaving ready access to a firearm [citation]—necessarily requires possession of the\nfirearm, possession of a firearm does not necessarily require that the possessor be armed\nwith it.” (Id. at p. 524.) The M. White court posed a hypothetical example in dicta\nsimilar to the one in Osuna to illustrate its perception of when a person in constructive\npossession of a weapon would not be armed: “For example, a convicted felon may be\nfound to be a felon in possession of a firearm if he or she knowingly kept a firearm in a\nlocked offsite storage unit even though he or she had no ready access to the firearm and,\nthus, was not armed with it.” (M. White, at p. 524.) None of these cases actually\ninvolved the specific situation where the defendant was not seen with the weapon and\nwas not present when the weapon was discovered. Indeed, in Burnes, the issue before the\ncourt related to the improper use of a probation report to determine the circumstances of\nthe defendant’s possession, not the sufficiency of evidence establishing arming. (Burnes,\nat p. 1455.) No other source of facts establishing the underlying circumstances of the\ndefendant’s possession was considered by the trial court in Burnes. In People v. Blakely\n(2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1322, the defendant actually fired the weapon and admitted\nactual possession of it for purposes of self-defense (id. at p. 1049), so not only was he\nexcluded under the arming exception but also the personal use exception. In M. White,\nthe defendant was also in actual physical possession of the weapon. (M. White, at\npp. 524-525; see fn. 10, ante.) Constructive possession was not a theory of possession in\nthese cases. More important, like Osuna, these courts did not consider our high court’s\nobservation in Bland that the defendant need not be present when the weapon is found so\n\n                                             22\n\fdefendant left his cell briefly to take a shower. When he left the cell, his possession was\ncontinuing. Moments before he went to the shower, he was in his cell and in either\nconstructive or actual possession of the weapon. At a minimum, the weapon was readily\naccessible to him at that time and thus it was readily accessible during his possession of\nthe weapon. Additionally, the showers are located “[r]ight in the middle of the . . . tier,”\nwith five cells to each side of each shower. Unlike the hypothetical parolee described in\nOsuna who was not home (Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1030), defendant here\nwas “home.” He was simply in another part of his home, mere cell widths away from his\ncell taking a shower. And defendant would undoubtedly be returning to his cell directly\nfollowing his shower. Had the correctional officers not discovered the weapon, it would\nhave been readily accessible to him immediately upon his return from the showers.\n       Defendant’s circumstances here are more analogous to those of the defendant in\nPeople v. Elder (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 1308 (Elder). In Elder, a law enforcement task\nforce executing a search warrant found the defendant outside the front door of his\napartment. (Id. at p. 1317.) Inside the apartment, law enforcement found a gun on an\nentertainment center and another gun in an unlocked safe in the bedroom. (Ibid.) The\n\n\n\n\nlong as the evidence demonstrates he or she had the weapon available for use “at any time\nduring [the] possession of the drugs.” (Bland, supra, 10 Cal.4th at p. 1000, italics added.)\nIn light of our high court’s reasoning in Bland, the fact that a defendant is only in\nconstructive possession as opposed to actual possession at the time the weapon is\ndiscovered does not mean he or she did not have the weapon available for use at some\nearlier point during the possession of that weapon. Having said that, we do not disagree\nthat there could be scenarios where a person is in knowing constructive possession of a\nweapon, yet was never near it or even touched it so as to be deemed armed, e.g., where a\nthird person places a weapon in a place over which the defendant has dominion and\ncontrol, tells the defendant it is at that location, but the weapon is discovered before the\ndefendant could go to that location.\n\n                                             23\n\fElder court concluded that the trial court properly determined that the defendant was\nineligible for resentencing because he was armed with a firearm. (Ibid.)14\n       In addition to Elder, defendant’s circumstances here are similar to each of the\nfollowing: the defendant in Bland who was in the police vehicle while the weapon and\ndrugs were discovered inside of his house; the defendant in Delgadillo who was detained\non a freeway while drugs and a firearm were found during the execution of a search\nwarrant at his home; the defendant in Hicks who was detained outside the apartment he\nwas there to visit, inside of which his backpack containing a gun was found; and the\ndefendant who was detained by the police officer at the motel in T. White while the gun\nwas found in a garbage can in an upstairs corridor where the defendant had been. In each\nof these cases, the weapon was not discovered on the defendant’s person or in his\nimmediate presence and the authorities never saw the defendant in actual possession of\nthe weapon. Yet, there was sufficient evidence to reasonably infer that, at some point\nduring the defendant’s possession of the weapon, he was present with it and that it was\nreadily accessible to him for his immediate use.\n       Defendant asserts he could not be armed, because in addition to being away from\nhis cell, he was “under guard and possibly handcuffed” when the weapon was found.\nThus, according to defendant, the weapon was not readily available for offensive or\ndefensive use. But this was the case in each of the cases we have just mentioned. Those\ndefendants were also detained or in custody at the time the weapons were found. We\nconclude defendant’s supervised visit to the shower did not make him eligible for\nsentence reduction under the Act. The arming exception still disqualifies him. Where, as\n\n\n\n14  However, in light of Bland, Delgadillo, Hicks, and T. White, we do not agree with the\nElder court’s seemingly inconsistent suggestion that a person could not be denied\nsentence reduction under the “armed” exception where the weapon “is under a\ndefendant’s dominion and control in a location not readily accessible to him at the time of\nits discovery.” (Elder, supra, 227 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1313-1314, italics added.)\n\n                                            24\n\fhere, the possessory offense is ongoing and defendant had the weapon available for use\nearlier, the arming exception makes him ineligible for resentencing under the Act. To\nconclude otherwise would mean that before he went to the shower, defendant was\nineligible for sentence reduction; while he was in the shower, he was eligible for sentence\nreduction; and when he returned from the shower (had the weapon not been discovered),\nhe was again ineligible for sentence reduction. It is difficult to accept the premise that it\nwas the intent of the electorate to make defendant eligible or ineligible for sentence\nreduction depending on the fortuity of the weapon being found while he was taking a\nshower.\n       Nor should his eligibility turn on the fact that inmates in administrative\nsegregation were not allowed to roam the cell block freely. Defendant’s eligibility for\nProposition 36 relief cannot conceivably turn on the fact that he was housed in\nadministrative segregation and, therefore, because he was escorted to the shower rather\nthan being free to enter and exit his cell with greater autonomy, he was not deemed to\nhave had the weapon available for use. This analysis would lead to an absurd result: an\ninmate housed elsewhere in the prison, with the ability to enter and exit his cell more\nfreely and to take showers with lesser supervision would be ineligible for Proposition 36\nrelief if a weapon were found in his cell while he was nearby taking a shower or\nelsewhere in the cellblock, but defendant would be eligible for relief because, due to the\ngreater danger he posed to other inmates and corrections officers, he had to be restrained\nwhenever he left his cell.\n       The dissent suggests the analysis in a Bland situation involving the possession of a\nweapon with drugs should be different than the analysis employed in a case involving a\npossession of a weapon charge. (Dis. opn. of Duarte, J., post, at p. 2.) According to the\ndissent, “[t]he key moment in time as well as in physical location for the ‘armed’\nclassification in the drug cases is the discovery of the drugs,” and the result would be\ndifferent if the weapon had been stored away from the drugs at the time when the drugs\n\n                                              25\n\fwere discovered. (Ibid.) We do not disagree. As we have noted, armed in the\ncommission of a drug offense requires both a facilitative nexus as well as a temporal\nnexus. (Hicks, supra, 231 Cal.App.4th at pp. 283-284.) Consequently, if the firearm is\nstored away from the drugs, a facilitative nexus could not be established based solely on\nthe concurrent possession of the weapon and drugs. But as Bland teaches, the defendant\nneed not be present when the drugs and weapon are found to be deemed armed. (Bland,\nsupra, 10 Cal.4th at p. 1000.) Moreover, in a weapon possession case where arming\nrequires that the weapon be available for a defendant’s use during the commission of the\nweapon possession, only a temporal nexus is required and that nexus has nothing to do\nwith where the defendant was located when the weapon is discovered. The temporal\nnexus is the concurrence of the point in time when the defendant has possession of the\nweapon and it is available for use. Thus, the key point in time for purposes of\ndetermining whether a defendant will be deemed to have been “armed” in a case\ninvolving constructive possession is whatever point in time the defendant had\nconstructive possession of the weapon and it was simultaneously available for use.\n       The dissent suggests that under our analysis, a defendant is “forever armed,” but\nthis temporal focus misses the mark. If a person commits a crime today and is not\napprehended until some future point in time, that person is still subject to prosecution for\nthe crime when he is apprehended (assuming charges are filed within the statute of\nlimitations). That person is no less culpable for the offense just because he was not\ncaught in the act and arrested at the time and place where the crime was committed.\nSimilarly, where, as here, a defendant constructively possessed a weapon and\nsimultaneously had it available for use offensively or defensively, he was armed at that\npoint in time, and it does not matter that he was later detained in some place other than\nwhere the arming had previously taken place. He still had the weapon available for use at\nthe earlier point in time. Thus, if he is charged with possession alleged to have taken\nplace at that earlier time and convicted, he may also be deemed armed at that earlier time\n\n                                             26\n\ffor purposes of the arming exception, rendering him ineligible for resentencing under the\nAct.15\n         In our view, the conclusion we reach here is consistent with the voters’ intent in\nenacting Proposition 36. The arguments expressed in support of Proposition 36\n“reflect[ed] an intent to ‘make the punishment fit the crime’ and ‘make room in prison for\ndangerous felons.’ ” (Johnson, supra, 61 Cal.4th at p. 686, quoting Voter Information\nGuide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012) argument in favor of Prop. 36, p. 52, italics added.) “In\nthis same vein, the ballot materials related to Proposition 36 (and therefore the\nresentencing statute) reflect an intent to ‘ “keep violent felons off the street” ’ and ‘\n“prevent[] dangerous criminals from being released early.” ’ ” (People v. Caraballo\n(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 936, 940, quoting Johnson, at p. 686, italics added.) These aims\nwould not be served by an interpretation of the statute requiring the narrow temporal\nfocus of arming advanced by defendant, a focus that would make him eligible for\nsentence reduction simply because he was not present with the weapon when it was\nfound, even though he had been present with it and it had been available for his use\nearlier. “[T]he plain purpose of these disqualifying factors is to serve as a prophylactic\nmeasure to further the goal of the Three Strikes law to protect society against recidivist\ncriminals who commit violent and/or serious crimes. In enacting Proposition 36, the\nvoters intended a third strike defendant who committed a current, nonviolent and\nnonserious crime would not be punished as severely as a third strike defendant whose\ncurrent crime was violent and/or serious. Nonetheless, the voters also intended to\nexclude those defendants who committed the current nonviolent and nonserious crime in\na manner that potentially could result in violent and/or serious consequences, which\nintent is manifest in the triad of disqualifying factors. As the court cogently reasoned in\n\n\n\n15 Defendant was charged with possession of the weapon “[o]n or about December 7,\n1998,” the same day when he left his cell to shower and the weapon was discovered.\n\n                                              27\n\f[Blakely, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th 1042]: ‘It is clear the electorate’s intent was not to\nthrow open the prison doors for all third strike offenders whose current convictions were\nnot for serious or violent felonies, but only for those who were perceived as\nnondangerous or posing little or no risk to the public.’ ” (Newman, supra, 2 Cal.App.5th\nat pp. 724-725, first & third italics added.) Felons in possession of weapons and who\nhave them readily available for use at any time during the possession are obviously\ndangerous, particularly in a custodial setting. We see nothing in the statute, the ballot\narguments or any other source that suggests the voters intended dangerous felons to be\neligible for sentence reduction if they were lucky enough to be arrested or detained at a\nlocation where they could not easily put their hands on the weapon, even though they had\nit available for use at some earlier point in time during their possession of it.\n       Based on the foregoing, we conclude that substantial evidence supported the trial\ncourt’s determination that defendant was armed with a deadly weapon within the\nmeaning of sections 667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(iii), and 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(C)(iii), and that\nhe was thus ineligible for resentencing on this conviction.\n     C. Assault by Inmate by Means Likely to Cause Great Bodily Injury (§ 4501)\n       Defendant also asserts that substantial evidence does not support the trial court’s\ndetermination that, in committing the assault on another inmate in violation of section\n4501,16 he intended to cause great bodily injury. We disagree.\n       1. The Trial Court’s Findings\n       The trial court concluded that this court’s opinion on the appeal from the\nconviction clearly established the defendant intended to cause great bodily injury to the\n\n\n\n16  Section 4501 provides: “Every person confined in a state prison of this state except\none undergoing a life sentence who commits an assault upon the person of another with a\ndeadly weapon or instrument, or by any means of force likely to produce great bodily\ninjury, shall be guilty of a felony and shall be imprisoned in the state prison for two, four,\nor six years to be served consecutively.” (Stats. 1978, ch. 579, § 33.)\n\n                                              28\n\fvictim. Based on the opinion, the trial court noted that defendant “acted in concert with\ncellmate/codefendant Dubon and another inmate, in assaulting the victim; defendant was\nstriking the victim from the back at about the same time that Dubon struck the victim in\nthe front; defendant and Dubon kicked the victim with full force kicks; both ignored\norders from officers to stop fighting as well as the firing of a special gun, and kept on\nwith the assault; only after tear gas was set off did defendant and the others disperse,\nleaving the victim on the ground, not moving; the victim only later regained\nconsciousness and tried to stand but fell down a couple of times; the victim had suffered\nmultiple injuries to his face and head, including a large hematoma to his right forehead,\nan open contusion on his right forehead, a bloody nose, multiple bruising to his upper\nface, blood in his mouth, a shoe imprint on the left side of his face, and abrasions on both\nknees and elbows.”\n       Based on these facts, the trial court stated that it was “easily inferable . . . that\ndefendant intended to cause great bodily harm to the victim, by his participation and role\nin the assault, by the types of injuries inflicted on the victim, including one of the\nassailants stepping on the victim’s face so hard as to cause a shoe imprint and the\ninfliction of a large hematoma on the victim’s head, and by defendant’s continuing to\ninflict the injuries on the victim or enable his coparticipants to do so by not stopping the\nassault when officers attempted to have the assault come to an end.” The court\nconcluded, beyond a reasonable doubt, that a jury would have found that defendant acted\nwith intent to cause great bodily injury during the commission of this offense, and,\ntherefore, the court itself made such a finding. As a result, the court found defendant\nineligible for resentencing pursuant to section 1170.126 because, “ ‘[d]uring the\ncommission of the current offense, the defendant . . . intended to cause great bodily injury\nto another person,’ under the meaning of Penal Code §§ 667(e)(2)(C)(iii) and\n1170.12(c)(2)(C)(iii).”\n\n\n\n                                               29\n\f         2. Analysis\n         A defendant is ineligible for, or disqualified from, resentencing if he or she\n“intended to cause great bodily injury to another person.” (§§ 667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(iii),\n1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(C)(iii).) Section 12022.7, subdivision (f), defines “ ‘great bodily\ninjury’ ” as “a significant or substantial physical injury.” “However, ‘the injury need not\nbe so grave as to cause the victim “permanent,” “prolonged,” or “protracted” bodily\ndamage.’ [Citation.] ‘Proof that a victim’s bodily injury is “great” . . . is commonly\nestablished by evidence of the severity of the victim’s physical injury, the resulting pain,\nor the medical care required to treat or repair the injury.’ ” (People v. Woods (2015) 241\nCal.App.4th 461, 486.)\n         “The intent to inflict great bodily injury need not be proven by direct evidence.\nSuch intent may be inferred or presumed. ‘ “It is black-letter law that a party is presumed\nto intend to do that which he voluntarily or willfully does in fact do and also presumed to\nintend the natural, probable and usual consequences of his own acts.” ’ ” (In re Sergio R.\n(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 588, 601; see People v. Phillips (1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 1120,\n1124.)\n         We agree with the trial court’s findings based on this court’s opinion on\ndefendant’s original appeal. We also note from the trial transcript that a physician\ndetermined that the victim suffered left anterior and medial orbital wall factures, right\nmaxillary sinus fractures, and a nasal fracture.\n         Based on the descriptions of defendant’s participation in the assault, his\ncontinuation with the assault after corrections officers intervened, ceasing only when\nofficers employed tear gas, and the extent of injuries inflicted on the victim, we conclude\nthat substantial evidence supports the trial court’s determination that, in committing the\nassault, defendant intended to inflict great bodily injury. (See Newman, supra, 2\nCal.App.5th at p. 727; Guilford, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at p. 662.)\n\n\n\n                                               30\n\f       Contrary to defendant’s contention, the fact that there was no finding of great\nbodily injury at trial does not undermine this determination. Defendant was convicted of\nassault by a prisoner by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury. (§ 4501.)\nThere was no requirement that the People at trial prove the actual infliction of great\nbodily injury; the People were only required to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the\nassault was committed “by any means of force likely to produce great bodily injury.”\n(§ 4501; see fn. 16, ante.) And the Proposition 36 eligibility exception does not require\nthat defendant actually inflict great bodily injury; rather the plain language of the statute\nrequires only that defendant intended to cause such injury. (§§ 667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(iii),\n1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(C)(iii); see Newman, supra, 2 Cal.App.5th at p. 725 [“mere intent\nto cause great bodily injury” is required].) Moreover, as stated, ante, “the existence of a\ndisqualifying factor that would render a defendant ineligible for resentencing under\nProposition 36, which would lessen his punishment if he were eligible, is a determination\nsolely within the province of the Proposition 36 court to make without regard to any\nfactual finding by the trier of fact.” (Newman, at p. 724.) “[A] Proposition 36 court may\ndetermine whether one or more of these disqualifying factors exists independent of the\nelements of the current offense and any attendant sentence enhancement allegation.”\n(Newman, at p. 726.)\n       Defendant also asserts that there is no evidence that he personally inflicted great\nbodily injury on the victim, or that he personally caused any particular injury to the\nvictim. For this proposition, defendant cites section 12022, subdivision (a). However,\nthat section does not refer to great bodily injury; section 12022, subdivision (a), addresses\ncommitting or attempting to commit a felony while armed with a firearm. That section\nhas no relevance or applicability here. It appears that defendant intended to reference\nsection 12022.7, subdivision (a). That section provides an enhancement for the personal\ninfliction of great bodily injury. To the extent that defendant asserts an express finding\nthat he personally inflicted great bodily injury on the victim is necessary to infer his\n\n                                              31\n\fintent to inflict great bodily injury, we disagree. The disqualifying factor speaks to the\nintent to inflict great bodily injury, not the personal infliction of great bodily injury as\nrequired by section 12022.7, subdivision (a). (§§ 667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(iii), 1170.12,\nsubd. (c)(2)(C)(iii); see Newman, supra, 2 Cal.App.5th at p. 725.) Thus, the plain\nlanguage of the Act does not contain a personal infliction requirement. “ ‘We presume\nthe [electorate] intended everything in a statutory scheme, and we do not read statutes to\nomit expressed language or to include omitted language. [Citation.] When “ ‘ “ ‘a statute\non a particular subject omits a particular provision, the inclusion of such a provision in\nanother statute concerning a related matter indicates an intent that the provision is not\napplicable to the statute from which it was omitted.’ ” ’ ” ’ ” (Guilford, supra, 228\nCal.App.4th at p. 657.) Moreover, by convicting defendant of a violation of section\n4501, the jury did determine that defendant assaulted the victim by “means of force likely\nto produce great bodily injury.” (§ 4501.) His intent, thus, was inferable from the nature\nof the facts underlying the conviction.\n       We conclude that substantial evidence supports the trial court’s determination that\ndefendant intended to inflict great bodily injury on the victim within the meaning of\nsections 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iii), and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(C)(iii), rendering\nhim ineligible for resentencing on his conviction of a violation of section 4501.\n                                       DISPOSITION\n       The order appealed from is affirmed.\n\n\n                                                          MURRAY                 , J.\n\nI concur:\n\n\n\n      HULL                   , Acting P. J.\n\n\n\n\n                                              32\n\fDUARTE, J., Concurring and Dissenting.\n\n\n       I concur in all parts of the majority opinion except Part IV.B., from which I\nrespectfully dissent.\n       Absent some farfetched hypothetical, under the majority’s broad holding every\nweapon possession is armed if charged broadly enough. The majority opinion erases the\ndistinction between possession where the weapon is readily accessible to a defendant and\npossession where it is not. In my view, while both are valid theories of possession, only\nthe first is armed possession. Thus I am compelled to dissent.\n       The majority writes that because weapon possession “can be a continuing crime,”\n“when a weapon is available to a defendant to use offensively or defensively at any time\nduring the actual or constructive possession of the weapon within the time period for\nwhich defendant was charged, the defendant was armed.” (Maj. opn., ante, at pp. 20-21;\nsee also id. at p. 3 [a defendant is armed if “he or she was present with the weapon and\nhad it available for use at any time he or she had actual or constructive possession of it\nwithin the time period for which the defendant was charged and convicted”], all\nemphases in original.)\n       Under the majority’s holding, a hypothetical defendant who acquired a weapon\nand immediately secured it in a safe, then buried the safe and left the state, remaining\naway for multiple years, would be classified “armed” with that weapon were he\neventually charged with its possession. Apparently, this classification would be valid\nprovided the date range on the charging document encompassed the date of the weapon’s\nacquisition. This would be true even if the date of the weapon’s acquisition preceded the\nweapon’s discovery (and the corresponding discovery of defendant’s constructive\npossession of it) by years. This classification is merited merely because at some point\n(“at any time”) the defendant placed the weapon in the safe. At the time of its placement,\nthe weapon was readily accessible to him for use. Thus he is forever “armed” with it,\n\n                                              1\n\fdespite being many years and miles removed from the weapon at the time of its\ndiscovery.\n       I understand that these are not the facts of Valdez’s case; I discuss his specific\nsituation in detail below. But this is the broad effect of the holding’s application.\n       I disagree with the majority that People v. Bland (1995) 10 Cal.4th 991 compels\nthis conclusion. (See maj. opn., ante, at pp. 21-22.) In the drug cases of Bland and\nPeople v. Delgadillo (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 1570, both relied on by the majority,\nbecause of the proximity of the guns at issue to the drugs, it was clear that the defendants\nwere armed with the guns at the time they were dealing drugs. But Bland and Delgadillo\nare not weapon possession cases; they are drug cases with weapon enhancements at issue.\nThose cases start with a completely separate offense from any arming analysis and build\non that offense, requiring proof that during commission of the continuing drug offense a\ndefendant had a weapon readily available for use to further that offense. This analysis\nstands in sharp contrast to the necessary analysis in a weapon possession case where the\n“armed” analysis is built on the same conduct as the charged possession. The key\nmoment in time as well as in physical location for the “armed” classification in the drug\ncases is the discovery of the drugs, the charged crime being drug possession for sale. In\nthose cases, at the time the defendants were discovered to be in (constructive) possession\nfor sale of the drugs, the guns were with the drugs, and easily accessible to the defendants\nwhile they were selling drugs. If the guns in those cases had been stored away from the\ndrugs at the time the drugs were discovered, the results of those cases would be different.\n       At the time Valdez was discovered to be in constructive possession of the weapon,\nit was stored and secured away from him. There is no evidence that Valdez was ever\nseen in actual possession of the weapon, as far as can be gleaned from this record. In my\nview, he cannot properly be classified as armed “during the commission of the current\noffense” merely because at some unwitnessed point in time he was presumably in the cell\nwith the weapon. As the majority acknowledges (maj. opn., ante, at pp. 22-23, fns. 14,\n\n                                              2\n\f15), published cases have agreed with my position in dicta, but those courts were not\ndirectly confronted with a case such as this one, where defendant’s criminal conviction\nwas based solely on evidence of constructive possession. Although I agree that those\ncases are not directly on point, I find them instructive.\n        In People v. White (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 512, at pages 523-524, the Fourth\nAppellate District, Division One analyzed the application of the “armed” classification to\ndefendant’s conduct as a felon in possession who was spotted by the police in actual\npossession of the gun--carrying it--and then, witnessed by police, threw the gun into the\nbed of his truck, from where it was later recovered. I agree that White was armed during\nthe possession offense with which he was charged, as the trial and appellate courts found.\nBut the White court went on to note that although White was observed in actual physical\npossession of the firearm, conviction under the relevant statute (former Pen. Code,\n§ 12021, subd. (a))1 could also be under the theory of constructive possession. The court\nexplained that: “while the act of being armed with a firearm--that is, having ready access\nto a firearm [citing Bland]--necessarily requires possession of a firearm, possession of a\nfirearm does not necessarily require that a possessor be armed with it. For example, a\nconvicted felon may be found to be a felon in possession of a firearm if he or she\nknowingly kept a firearm in a locked offsite storage unit even though he or she had no\nready access to the firearm and, thus, was not armed with it.” (White, at p. 524.) The\nfelon contemplated by the White court in this analysis surely had ready access to that gun\nat some point--when he or she placed in the safe, at a minimum. Yet the White court\ndeclined to classify that hypothetical felon as armed with the gun, even though he was\nclearly in constructive possession of it, presumably at the time of its detection. Summing\nup, the court stressed that White’s offense was one of actual, not constructive, possession\n\n\n\n\n1   Undesignated statutory references are to the Penal Code.\n\n                                              3\n\fof the gun, given that White was carrying the gun at the time he was spotted by the\npolice, and emphasized that for this reason the “armed” classification was appropriate.\n(See Id. at pp. 525-526.)\n       This court seemed to be in basic agreement that there is a separation between\npossession and armed possession in People v. Elder (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 1308, citing\nWhite and noting that White “makes the point that if constructive possession was the basis\nfor the prior conviction, not every conviction for possession will establish that a\ndefendant was armed.” (Id. at p. 1314, fn. 7.) Elder itself makes the point that “not every\ncommitment offense for unlawful possession of a gun necessarily involves being armed\nwith the gun, if the gun is not otherwise available for immediate use in connection with\nits possession, e.g., where it is under defendant’s dominion and control in a location not\nreadily accessible to him at the time of its discovery.” (Id. at pp. 1313-1314.) Although\nElder was outside the door of his apartment when the police caught him, there appear to\nhave been two accessible guns inside, as well as a recent photograph of defendant in\nactual possession of one of the guns. (Id. at p. 1317.) Elder’s conclusion that defendant\nwas “armed” with those guns which were immediately inside his apartment is much more\ndefensible than a conclusion that defendant here was “armed” with the altered toothbrush\ncontaining the razor, found hidden in one of the cubicles in his shared cell while he was\nsecured in the shower area and unable to get to his cell. The relationship between\ndefendant and his altered toothbrush in this case in precisely that described by the Elder\ncourt, “e.g., where [the altered toothbrush] is under defendant’s dominion and control in a\nlocation not readily accessible to him at the time of its discovery.” (Ibid.)\n       The Fifth Appellate District’s People v. Osuna (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1020, at\npage 1030, agrees with the idea that constructive possession does not equate to “armed”\npossession without at least some indication of ready access in close temporal proximity to\nthe discovery of the offense. Being secured elsewhere and unable to access the cell\ncontaining the weapon, let alone the cubicle or the weapon itself, is akin to the\n\n                                              4\n\fhypothetical parolee in Osuna whose bedroom is searched while he is away from home.\nAlthough the majority classifies any comparison of Osuna with the instant case as inapt\n(maj. opn., ante, at pp. 22-24), I do not agree that Valdez was “simply in another part of\nhis home” (id. at p. 23) while he was held by force in another part of the facility and\nunable to return to his cell. The record does not indicate that Valdez had any access to\nhis cell while he was detained away from it, much less ready access to the weapon\nsecreted therein. The majority also discusses People v. White (2016) 243 Cal.App.4th\n1354, at pages 1361-1362, where the Fourth Appellate District, Division One upheld an\nineligibility finding by the trial court based on the armed classification. There, the\nevidence produced at trial showed that not only was defendant likely carrying the gun in\nhis fanny pack when first observed by law enforcement, but also that he was admittedly\nwithin arm’s reach of the gun during the course of the pursuit which resulted in his being\napprehended and charged with the gun’s possession. (Id. at p. 1358.)\n       These cases require at least some evidence of ready access to the weapon at the\ntime its discovery was ongoing, although they are arguably trending toward broadening\nthat requirement. I am not inclined to continue down this slippery slope and further blur\nthe line between actual and constructive possession, and current and remote availability\nof the weapon for use.2 Being armed with a weapon requires possessing that weapon in a\nmanner which heightens the ease and probability of its use. The record shows only that\nValdez constructively possessed a sharp object, which was first seen hidden in his cell\nwhile he was detained elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n2 To the extent an earlier case from this court does not appear to require witnessed or\nadmitted availability of the weapon to the defendant during its discovery (see People v.\nHicks (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 275 [defendant armed where witnesses saw backpack\ncontaining gun in defendant’s possession at some point, but timing of backpack’s\npossession by defendant unclear]), I disagree for the reasons I have discussed.\n\n                                              5\n\f       In People v. Burnes (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1452, although the defendant\nadmitted possession of a firearm and possession of a deadly weapon with his no contest\npleas to those counts, the Sixth Appellate District reversed the trial court’s determination\nthat defendant was armed for purposes of assessing eligibility for Proposition 47 relief.\nThe reversal was due to the trial court’s reliance on the probation report to find facts\nsupporting its determination; however, had the mere fact of conviction on the firearm and\nweapon possession counts been enough to establish that defendant was “armed,” reversal\nwould not have been required. Any error in reliance on the probation report would have\nbeen harmless. Thus at least impliedly, the Burnes court agreed that the defendant’s\nconviction of these possession offenses did not automatically equate to his being armed.\n       To the extent that the majority relies on policy to justify its broad holding, I\ncertainly agree that weapon possession by prisoners is dangerous. However, defendant’s\noffense was not classified by the electorate as a disqualifying offense per se. (See\n§ 1170.126, subd. (e)(1), cross-referencing § 667.5, subd. (c).) Only if he were actually\n“armed” with the weapon “during the commission of the current offense”--constructive\npossession of the weapon--is he precluded from seeking recall of sentence. (§ 1170.126,\nsubd. (e)(2), cross-referencing § 667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(iii).) If he is permitted to seek\nrecall because he was in constructive possession of the weapon but not armed with it, he\nis still subject to the trial court’s determination as to whether his resentencing poses an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (§ 1170.126, subd. (f).) The trial court may\nconsider all of those concerns expressed by the majority opinion in its determination of\nrisk, as well as any other relevant evidence. (See § 1170.126, subd. (g).)\n       The question before us is not whether defendant is dangerous, or the intent of the\nelectorate in approving Proposition 36, but simply whether defendant was armed in the\ncommission of the current offense. “ ‘[I]t is the availability--the ready access--of the\nweapon that constitutes arming.’ ” (People v. Bland, supra, 10 Cal.4th at p. 997.) On the\nrecord we were provided, it cannot be said that Valdez was armed in the commission of\n\n                                              6\n\fhis constructive possession offense. Nor can it be said that my hypothetical defendant,\nlong separated by time and distance from his gun, is forever armed with it and thereby\nineligible to petition for recall of his sentence.\n       For these reasons, I respectfully disagree with the majority’s analysis and\nconclusion in Part IV.B.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       Duarte                , J.\n\n\n\n\n                                                7\n\f",

Code, § 4502, subd. (a))1 and assault by an inmate by means likely to cause great\nbodily injury (§ 4501). The trial court found true three prior strike allegations. (§§ 667,\nsubds. (b)-(i), 1170.12.) The trial court sentenced defendant to consecutive terms of 25\nyears to life on each count. In an unpublished opinion, this court affirmed the judgment.\n(People v. Valdez (May 13, 2003, C038924) [nonpub. opn.] slip opn. at pp. 1-11 (Slip\nOpn.).)\n       Defendant appeals from the trial court’s denial of his petition for recall of sentence\nunder the Three Strikes Reform Act of 2012 (enacted by Prop. 36, as approved by voters,\nGen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012); §§ 667, 1170.12, 1170.126 (Proposition 36 or the Act)). As to\neach conviction, defendant asserts that: (1) the trial court was not authorized to make\nfindings of fact and the People were required to plead and prove any disqualifying facts\nin the prosecution of his commitment offense; (2) substantial evidence did not support the\ntrial court’s determinations regarding his ineligibility; and (3) the trial court employed the\nwrong standard of proof, in that it should have applied the “clear and convincing\nevidence” standard rather than the “preponderance of the evidence” standard. Defendant\nalso asserts that, if we conclude that he is eligible for resentencing on one conviction but\nineligible on the other, he should be resentenced on the eligible offense.\n       In the published part of this opinion we conclude there was substantial evidence\nsupporting the trial court’s determination that defendant was “armed” with the sharp\ninstrument in prison. Defendant had the weapon available for use while he possessed it\nin his cell and the fact that the weapon was seized from his cell by correctional officers\nwhile defendant was away taking a shower does not make defendant eligible for\nresentencing under Proposition 36. Possession of a weapon can be a continuing offense.\n\n\n\n1 Further undesignated statutory references are to the Penal Code in effect at the relevant\ntimes.\n\n                                              2\n\fConsequently, a person is armed with a weapon for purposes of the Proposition 36\nresentencing exception if the evidence from the record of conviction establishes that he or\nshe was present with the weapon and had it available for use at any time he or she had\nactual or constructive possession of it within the time period for which the defendant was\ncharged and convicted.\n       In the unpublished parts of this opinion, we discuss and reject defendant’s other\ncontentions.\n       We affirm.\n                  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n                                   Current Convictions2\n       Possession of a Sharp Instrument in Prison (§ 4502)\n       “In December 1998, Correctional Officer Kevin Keene was working as a floor\nofficer in the administrative segregation section of ‘six block’ of the California State\nPrison, Sacramento. While defendant and codefendant Jose Alberto Dubon were away\ntaking showers, Keene conducted a routine search of their cell. The cell had two bunks\nand a toilet on the right-hand side and upper and lower cubicles on the left-hand side.\n\n\n\n\n2  The factual background relating to defendant’s underlying convictions is derived from\nthis court’s unpublished opinion affirming the judgment.

Defendant relies upon facts from testimony\nin the trial transcript in his appellate briefing. Although defendant did not present the\ntranscript from his trial to the trial court in connection with his petition for resentencing,\nwe have considered the cited testimony as well as other testimony in the trial transcript as\nif he had.

No inmates other than defendant and Dubon would have been allowed in\ntheir cell.\n        “Keene testified that inmates in administrative segregation are not allowed to have\ndisposable razors or sharp metal objects. Inmates in the general population are allowed\nto have razors but are not allowed to alter them or remove them from their plastic\ncasings. . . . Keene was not sure which inmate ordinarily used the upper cubicle.” (Slip\nOpn., supra, at pp. 2-3, fn. omitted.) We set forth additional facts regarding this offense\nin our discussion, post.\n        Assault by Inmate by Means Likely to Cause Great Bodily Injury (§ 4501)\n        “Several months after the incident in count three, defendant, Dubon, and two other\ninmates were seen assaulting a newer inmate. Defendant struck the victim from the back\nat about the same time that Dubon struck him in the front. Defendant and Dubon kicked\nthe victim with ‘full force kicks.’ Both men ignored Correctional Officer Ernest\nJohnson’s order to stop fighting and were undeterred when he fired a special gun that\nshot rubber grommets. When Johnson resorted to tear gas, the inmates dispersed. At that\npoint, the victim was on the ground and was not moving. He later regained\nconsciousness and tried to stand but fell down a couple of times. He suffered multiple\ninjuries to his face and head, including a large hematoma to his right forehead, an open\ncontusion on his right forehead, a bloody nose, multiple bruising to his upper face, blood\nin his mouth, a shoe imprint on the left side of his face, and abrasions on both knees and\nelbows.” (Slip Opn., supra, at pp. 3-4.)\n\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f                                Petition for Resentencing\n       In 2014, defendant filed a petition for recall of his sentence pursuant to section\n1170.126 which is part of the Act. Defendant asserted that, under section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (e)(1), his convictions of possession of a sharp instrument while in prison\n(§ 4502, subd. (a)) and assault by a prisoner by means of force likely to produce great\nbodily injury (§ 4501) were neither serious felonies within the meaning of section 1192.7,\nnor violent felonies within the meaning of section 667.5, and therefore these convictions\ndid not render him ineligible for resentencing under the Act. Defendant also asserted\nthat, in violating sections 4501 and 4502, subdivision (a), he was not armed with a\nfirearm or deadly weapon, did not use a firearm or deadly weapon, and he did not intend\nto cause great bodily injury to another person within the meaning of section 667,\nsubdivision (e)(2)(C)(iii), and therefore he was not ineligible for resentencing under the\nAct. (§ 1170.126, subd. (e)(2).) Defendant further asserted that these convictions did not\notherwise render him ineligible for relief. Thus, according to defendant, he satisfied all\nof the criteria for resentencing under the Act, and requested that the trial court resentence\nhim as a second strike offender.\n                             Trial Court’s Denial of Petition\n       The trial court rejected each of defendant’s contentions and denied the petition.\nWe discuss post the court’s factual findings concerning each conviction and its\ndetermination of resentencing ineligibility based on those findings.\n       The trial court also rejected defendant’s contention that, if it were to make findings\nof fact relevant to issues, it would violate the mandate of Apprendi v.

In this regard, the trial court\nfollowed those cases which had concluded that a defendant is ineligible for resentencing\nunder the Act if any of the defendant’s current convictions render him or her ineligible,\nalthough the court noted that the issue was pending before our high court at the time.3\n       Accordingly, the trial court denied defendant’s petition for resentencing.\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n                                        I.   The Act\n       “Prior to its amendment by the Act, the Three Strikes law required that a\ndefendant who had two or more prior convictions of violent or serious felonies receive a\nthird strike sentence of a minimum of 25 years to life for any current felony conviction,\neven if the current offense was neither serious nor violent. [Citations.] The Act amended\nthe Three Strikes law with respect to defendants whose current conviction is for a felony\nthat is neither serious nor violent. In that circumstance, unless an exception applies, the\ndefendant is to receive a second strike sentence of twice the term otherwise provided for\nthe current felony, pursuant to the provisions that apply when a defendant has one prior\nconviction for a serious or violent felony.” (Johnson, supra, 61 Cal.4th at pp. 680-681.)\n\n\n\n3  In People v. Johnson (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">674</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Johnson), decided after the trial court’s\ndetermination here, our high court concluded that “the Act requires an inmate’s eligibility\nfor resentencing . . . be evaluated on a count-by-count basis,” and that “resentencing is\nallowed with respect to a count that is neither serious nor violent, despite the presence of\nanother count that is serious or violent.” (Johnson, at pp. 679, 688, 694-695.) Thus, our\nhigh court rejected the approach adopted by the trial court here that a single ineligible\nconviction rendered the defendant ineligible for resentencing under the Act on other\nconvictions. In any event, as we discuss post, Johnson is of no moment because\ndefendant is ineligible for resentencing on both convictions.\n\n                                              6\n\f       “The Act’s exceptions to the new sentencing provisions relate to a defendant’s\ncurrent offense and prior offenses.” (Johnson, supra, 61 Cal.4th at p. 681.) These\nexceptions are set forth in sections 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C), and 1170.12,\nsubdivision (c)(2)(C). (Johnson, at p. 681.)\n       The Act addressed both prospective sentencing and retrospective resentencing.\nThis case involves retrospective resentencing. “In addition to reducing the sentence to be\nimposed for some third strike felonies that are neither violent nor serious, the Act\nprovides a procedure by which some prisoners already serving third strike sentences may\nseek resentencing in accordance with the new sentencing rules. [Citation.] ‘An inmate is\neligible for resentencing if . . . . [¶] . . . [t]he inmate is serving an indeterminate term of\nlife imprisonment imposed pursuant to [the Three Strikes law] for a conviction of a\nfelony or felonies that are not defined as serious and/or violent . . . .’ [Citation.] Like a\ndefendant who is being sentenced under the new provisions, an inmate is disqualified\nfrom resentencing if any of the exceptions set forth in section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)\nand section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(C) are present.” (Johnson, supra, 61 Cal.4th at\np. 682.)\n       The specific exceptions applicable in this case are: “[d]uring the commission of\nthe current offense, the defendant . . . was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or\nintended to cause great bodily injury to another person.” (§ 667, subd. (c)(2)(C)(iii);\n1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(C)(iii), italics added.)\n                          II.    Pleading and Proof Requirement\n       Defendant asserts that the People were required to plead and prove disqualifying\nfacts at trial on the current convictions, and that a court considering a petition under the\nAct cannot make new findings of fact resulting in the denial of the petition. We disagree.\n       As this court said in People v. Guilford (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">228</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Guilford):\n“Because the electorate required pleading and proof of these disqualifying facts in the\nprospective part of the Act, but not the retrospective part, we presume the intention was\n\n                                                 7\n\fto dispense with a pleading and proof requirement in the latter case.” (Guilford, at\np. 657.) Contrary to defendant’s contention, the fact that the resentencing portion of the\nAct cross-references the prospective portions does not necessarily lead to the conclusion\nthat the electorate intended to impose a pleading and proof requirement for resentencing.\nIn many cases, the relevant factors would not have been adjudicated in the current case,\nresulting in undermining one purpose of Proposition 36—to preclude dangerous persons\nfrom the recall provision. (Guilford, at p. 658.) Rather, it is appropriate in considering a\nrecall petition for the trial court to consider the facts of the crime, as shown by the record,\nin making a determination as to whether the defendant is ineligible. (Id. at p. 659.) Thus,\nas defendant acknowledges, this court has agreed with the conclusion that “[t]he\nrequirement of pleading and proof for prospective application of the Act, and the absence\nof such requirement for retrospective application, indicates that pleading and proof is not\na requirement for the latter.” (Guilford, at p. 659.)\n       Recently, the Court of Appeal for the Second Appellate District, Division Two,\naddressed a defendant’s argument that the trial court considering his Proposition 36\npetition “was not permitted ‘to make a brand new factual finding of intent’ and could not\n‘make new findings that went beyond the “nature or basis” of the conviction.’ ” (People\nv. Newman (2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 718, 723 (Newman), review granted November 22,\n2016, S237491.) The Newman court clarified: “The gist of [the defendant’s] claim of\nerror is unless the disqualifying factor, e.g., ‘intent to cause great bodily injury,’ is an\nelement of the current crime or a sentence enhancement allegation found true by the jury,\nthe court is not empowered to find such factor exists.” (Ibid.) The Newman court\ndisagreed. (Ibid.) The court stated that, unlike the determination of the defendant’s guilt\nor innocence of the underlying charges, “the existence of a disqualifying factor that\nwould render a defendant ineligible for resentencing under Proposition 36, which would\nlessen his punishment if he were eligible, is a determination solely within the province of\nthe Proposition 36 court to make without regard to any factual finding by the trier of\n\n                                               8\n\ffact.” (Newman, at p. 724.) “[A] Proposition 36 court may determine whether one or\nmore of these disqualifying factors exists independent of the elements of the current\noffense and any attendant sentence enhancement allegation.” (Newman, at p. 726.)\n       The court in Newman observed that there was no requirement on the face of\nProposition 36 that disqualifying factors must be an element of the crimes of conviction,\nor that they must be pled and proved to the trier of fact. (Newman, supra, 2 Cal.App.5th\nat p. 724.) The court stated: “Its plain and clear language reflects a contrary intent.\nSubdivision (f) of section 1170.126 expressly provides: ‘Upon receiving a petition for\nrecall of sentence under this section, the court shall determine whether the petitioner\nsatisfies the criteria in subdivision (e).’ ” (Newman, at p. 724.) Additionally, the\nNewman court held that the disqualifying factors were not required to be determined by a\njury because they do not have the effect of increasing punishment. (Ibid.) On the\ncontrary, Proposition 36 has the effect of decreasing a defendant’s punishment, and\ntherefore it constituted “ ‘ “an act of lenity.” ’ ” (Newman, at p. 724.) As such, the\nNewman court concluded Apprendi v.

(Newman, at p. 724.)\n       “[T]he Proposition 36 court is authorized to make its factual findings regarding a\ndisqualifying factor based on the record of conviction.” (Newman, supra, 2 Cal.App.5th\nat p. 725.) “ ‘[A] . . . court determining eligibility for resentencing under the Act is not\nlimited to a consideration of the elements of the current offense and the evidence that was\npresented at the trial (or plea proceedings) at which the defendant was convicted. Rather,\nthe court may examine relevant, reliable, admissible portions of the record of conviction\nto determine the existence or nonexistence of disqualifying factors. [Citation.] This is\nconsistent with voters’ intent.’ ” (Newman, at p. 726, quoting Blakely, supra, 225\nCal.App.4th at p. 1063.)\n       More recently, the Fifth Appellate District agreed with Newman on this point.\n“Simply put, the trial court takes the facts from the record of conviction and determines,\n\n                                              9\n\ffrom its interpretation of those facts, whether a petitioner is eligible for resentencing.”\n(People v. Perez (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 812, 832-833 (Perez), review granted Jan. 11, 2017,\nS238354.)\n        We agree with the analysis in Newman and Perez and adopt it as our own. Thus,\nwe reject defendant’s contentions that the People had the burden of pleading and proving\nat trial all disqualifying facts and that the trial court was not authorized to make findings\nof fact.\n\n                           III.   Applicable Standard of Proof\n        Defendant asserts that, even if the trial court had the authority to make new\nfindings of fact, and even if there was substantial evidence to support its findings, the\ntrial court should have employed the “clear and convincing evidence” standard of proof\nrather than the “preponderance of the evidence” standard. In making this assertion,\ndefendant relies on a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals case,4 as well as a concurring\nopinion5 from this court.6 The court in Newman rejected this contention (Newman,\nsupra, 2 Cal.App.5th at p. 728), and so do we.\n        As noted by the Newman court: “To date, no reviewing court has embraced the\nclear and convincing evidence standard as the standard of proof applicable to a\nProposition 36 resentencing disability finding. Rather, the battle lines have been drawn\nwith beyond a reasonable doubt, on one side, and preponderance of the evidence, on the\nother. The published appellate court opinions espousing a standard of proof thus far have\nall come down on the side of preponderance of the evidence, except for one, [People v.\n\n\n\n4   United States v.

We decline to follow Arevalo and conclude the\nappropriate standard of proof is preponderance of the evidence.” (Newman, supra, 2\nCal.App.5th at p. 728.) In our view, the reasoning in Newman is persuasive. (Id. at\npp. 727-732; accord Perez, supra, 3 Cal.App.5th at p. 833; People v. Frierson (2016) 1\nCal.App.5th 788 (Frierson), review granted Oct. 19, 2016, S236728; People v.

Possession of a Sharp Instrument in Prison - Armed with a Deadly Weapon\n       Defendant asserts that the trial court’s determination that he was armed with a\ndeadly weapon when he violated section 4502, possession of a sharp instrument in\nprison,9 was not supported by substantial evidence. We disagree.\n       1. The Trial Court’s Ruling\n       The trial court found that defendant was armed with a deadly weapon within the\nmeaning of section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iii). The court stated that, in this context,\nto be “ ‘armed with a deadly weapon’ ” means that a person has “the deadly weapon\navailable for use, either offensively or defensively.” In concluding that the circumstances\nhere satisfied this requirement, the trial court stated: “Here, defendant . . . and [his]\ncellmate . . . were only gone briefly from their cell, to take a shower; otherwise, the two\nand only those two spent most of their time in that cell. As the possession was ongoing,\nand defendant . . . most of the time was present in the cell and so near to the weapon as to\nhave it available to him offensively or defensively during the times of his possession, he\nclearly was ‘armed’ with the deadly weapon when he was committing the offense.”\nAccordingly, the court concluded that defendant was ineligible for resentencing on this\nconviction under the Act.\n       2. Analysis\n       “A defendant is armed if the defendant has the specified weapon available for use,\neither offensively or defensively.” (People v. Bland (1995) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1208051\"><a href=\"/opinion/1208051/people-v-bland/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">991</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 997 (Bland).)\n\n\n\n\n9 Section 4502, subdivision (a), provides in pertinent part: “Every person who, while at\nor confined in any penal institution, while being conveyed to or from any penal\ninstitution, or while under the custody of officials, officers, or employees of any penal\ninstitution, possesses . . . [a] sharp instrument . . . is guilty of a felony.”\n\n                                              12\n\f“ ‘ “[I]t is the availability—the ready access—of the weapon that constitutes arming.” ’ ”\n(People v.

Police investigating the defendant’s possible involvement in\nthe theft of auto parts searched his house and found rock cocaine in his bedroom closet.\n(Ibid.) Under the bed, they found an assault rifle. (Ibid.) At the time of the search, the\ndefendant was in custody inside a police vehicle parked outside of his house. (Ibid.) The\nopinion does not make note of specifically where defendant was located prior to being\nplaced in the patrol vehicle. The Court of Appeal affirmed the underlying convictions,\nbut reversed the three-year arming enhancement, concluding that the defendant was not\narmed because he was outside of the house when the weapon was found. (Id. at p. 996.)\n       In reversing the Court of Appeal’s decision, the California Supreme Court\nobserved that, by focusing on the defendant’s proximity to the weapon at the time the\npolice found it, the Court of Appeal erred because its temporal focus was too narrow.\n(Bland, supra, 10 Cal.4th at p. 996.) Our high court explained: “[W]hether defendant\nwas ‘armed in the commission’ of the continuing offense of drug possession—it is\nimmaterial whether defendant was present when police seized the assault rifle together\nwith the cache of crack cocaine, so long as he had the firearm available for use in\nfurtherance of the drug offense at any time during his possession of the drugs. From\nevidence that the assault weapon was kept in [the] defendant’s bedroom near the drugs,\nthe jury could reasonably infer that, at some point during the felonious drug possession,\ndefendant was physically present with both the drugs and the weapon, giving him ready\naccess to the assault rifle to aid his commission of the drug offense.” (Id. at p. 1000,\n\n                                             13\n\fitalics added.) In its reasoning, the court emphasized the continuing nature of drug\npossession. (Id. at pp. 999-1000, 1002, 1004.) To summarize, the court wrote: “[W]hen\nthe prosecution has proved a charge of felony drug possession, and the evidence at trial\nshows that a firearm was found in close proximity to the illegal drugs in a place\nfrequented by the defendant, a jury may reasonably infer (1) that the defendant knew of\nthe firearm’s presence, (2) that its presence together with the drugs was not accidental or\ncoincidental, and (3) that, at some point during the period of illegal drug possession, the\ndefendant was present with both the drugs and the firearm and thus that the firearm was\navailable for the defendant to put to immediate use to aid in the drug possession. These\nreasonable inferences, if not refuted by defense evidence, are sufficient to warrant a\ndetermination that the defendant was ‘armed with a firearm in the commission’ of a\nfelony within the meaning of section 12022.” (Bland, at pp. 1002-1003, fn. omitted,\nitalics added.) Thus, in the context of ongoing or continuous possession, our high court\ndoes not require the weapon be readily “available” or available for “immediate use” at the\nvery moment the weapon is found.\n       Here the possessory crime is the possession of a sharp instrument in prison.\nPossessory offenses, such as drug possession or possession of a deadly weapon, are\n“ ‘continuing offense[s], one[s] that extend[] through time” and create criminal liability\n“throughout the entire time the defendant asserts dominion and control.” (Bland, supra,\n10 Cal.4th at p. 999.) Thus, even if it is true that the weapon was not in defendant’s\nactual physical possession at the precise time it was discovered, this does not necessarily\nundermine a finding that he was armed with the deadly weapon at other relevant times so\nas to support the trial court’s determination. The instant case, where the weapon is stored\nin an inmate’s cell, is an example of continuing or ongoing possession. Indeed, the\ndiscovery of the weapon in defendant’s cell presents a stronger case for a finding that he\nwas armed than the circumstances in Bland because defendant, an administrative\nsegregation prisoner, spent the vast majority of his time in the cell where the weapon was\n\n                                             14\n\fdiscovered, whereas it is not clear how much time the defendant in Bland spent in his\nbedroom where police discovered the assault rifle.\n       Moreover, similar to the situation in Bland, there is a safety risk here. The Bland\ncourt explained that “[t]he crime scene in a drug possession case is the place where the\ndefendant keeps his or her cache of illegal drugs. A firearm kept near the drugs creates\nan ongoing risk of serious injury or death from use of the weapon to protect the defendant\nduring a drug sale, to guard against theft of the drugs, or to ward off police. Yet\ndefendant would have us ignore the continuing nature of that risk.” (Bland, supra, 10\nCal.4th at pp. 1001-1002.) Like in Bland, we should not ignore the continuing nature of\nthe safety risk here. (Id. at p. 1002.) Possession of a weapon by a state prisoner creates a\ncontinuing risk of serious injury or death to other inmates and staff and jeopardizes the\nsecurity of the facility. Thus, incarcerated felons who possess such weapons are\nparticularly dangerous. And as we shall discuss post, the electorate was particularly\nconcerned with keeping dangerous felons incarcerated when it enacted Proposition 36.\n       People v. Delgadillo (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1570</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Delgadillo), is another\nexample of the situation where, even though the defendant was not present when a\nweapon was found, the court held that he was armed because the weapon had earlier been\navailable for use in furtherance of the drug offenses during the commission of those\ncrimes. In Delgadillo, law enforcement followed the defendant from his house and\nstopped him some distance away on a freeway. (Id. at p. 1572.) Law enforcement then\nexecuted a search warrant at his house. Two guns were found in the headboard of the\ndefendant’s bed and methamphetamine, cash, and indicia of methamphetamine sale and\nmanufacturing were found elsewhere inside the home and in a car parked outside. (Id. at\np. 1573.) The Delgadillo court followed the Bland court’s reasoning concerning the\ncontinuing nature of drug possession, noting “the crime of drug possession is ‘a\n“continuing” offense, one that extends through time . . . [a]nd when, at any time during\nthe commission of the felony drug possession, the defendant can resort to a firearm to\n\n                                             15\n\ffurther that offense, the defendant satisfies the statutory language of being “armed with a\nfirearm in the commission . . . of a felony.” ’ ” (Delgadillo, at p. 1574, italics added.)\nFocusing the temporal analysis of arming on occasions prior to his arrest, the court held\nthat the firearms were available for defendant to use offensively or defensively “at any\ntime during the manufacturing process,” even though that process took place over time\nand at different locations. (Id. at pp. 1574-1575, italics added.)\n       It is true that Bland and Delgadillo are “armed in the commission” cases and that\nthe Bland court noted “ ‘in the commission’ ” (italics added) means “any time during and\nin furtherance of the felony.” (Bland, supra, 10 Cal.4th at p. 1001.) Because section\n1170.126 requires only that the arming be “during” the commission of the crime, there is\nno facilitative nexus requirement as when the arming must also be in furtherance of a\nfelony. (People v. Hicks (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">231</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 283-284 (Hicks) [crime of\npossession of firearm by a felon precludes section 1170.126 relief under the arming\nprohibition]; accord, People v.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1020</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1032 (Osuna) [same].)\n       In Hicks, a published case of this court, parole agents and police officers\napproaching an apartment complex looking for a parolee at large encountered the\ndefendant and two companions. (Hicks, supra, 231 Cal.App.4th at p. 280.) After the\ndefendant removed a clear plastic bag from his sweatpants and threw it away, officers\nfrisked him and found five .380-caliber bullets. (Ibid.) Additionally, an officer retrieved\nthe clear bag and discovered that it contained rock cocaine. (Ibid.) Officers proceeded to\nthe apartment defendant and his companions were there to visit, and, in that apartment,\nthey found a backpack containing a loaded .380-caliber handgun. (Ibid.) Two witnesses,\nwho subsequently gave inconsistent testimony, told the police that the defendant had left\nthe backpack in the apartment. (Id. at pp. 280-281.) This court affirmed the trial court’s\ndetermination that the defendant was ineligible for resentencing because he was armed\nwith a firearm when he committed the crime of being a felon in possession of a firearm.\n\n                                             16\n\f(Id. at pp. 279-280.) The Hicks court stated: “unlike section 12022, which requires that a\ndefendant be armed ‘in the commission of’ a felony for additional punishment to be\nimposed . . . , the Act disqualifies an inmate from eligibility for lesser punishment if he or\nshe was armed with a firearm ‘[d]uring the commission of’ the current offense.” (Hicks,\nat pp. 283-284.) “Thus, there must be a temporal nexus between the arming and the\nunderlying felony, not a facilitative one. The two are not the same.” (Id. at p. 284, citing\nBland, supra, 10 Cal.4th at p. 1002.) The Hicks court continued: “Following this\nreasoning, defendant was armed with a firearm during his possession of the gun, but not\n‘in the commission’ of his crime of possession. There was no facilitative nexus; his\nhaving the firearm available for use did not further his illegal possession of it. There was,\nhowever, a temporal nexus. Since the Act uses the phrase ‘[d]uring the commission of\nthe current offense,’ and not ‘in the commission of’ the current offense [citations], and\nsince at issue is not the imposition of additional punishment but rather eligibility for\nreduced punishment, we conclude the plain language of the Act disqualifies an inmate\nfrom resentencing if he or she was armed with a firearm during the unlawful possession\nof that firearm. [¶] Here, the trial court stated it found beyond a reasonable doubt that\ndefendant was personally armed with the firearm he was convicted of possessing. There\nwas sufficient evidence to support this finding based on the initial statements of the two\nrecanting witnesses . . . that it was defendant who had the backpack with the gun inside\nand put it in the tenant’s apartment.” (Hicks, at p. 284.)\n       Similarly, here, defendant was armed with the deadly weapon during his\ncommission of possession of a sharp instrument in prison. Contrary to defendant’s\ncontention, the possession of the weapon need not facilitate another felony, e.g., drug\npossession or drug manufacturing. We need only look to whether the inmate was armed\nduring the possession of the weapon. Further, we see no need to reconsider, as urged by\ndefendant, this court’s determination in Hicks that “there must be a temporal nexus\nbetween the arming and the underlying felony, not a facilitative one.” (Hicks, supra, 231\n\n                                             17\n\fCal.App.4th at p. 284.) As we have noted, other courts are in accord. (T. White, supra,\n243 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1362-1363; Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1032.)\nAdditionally, on its facts, Hicks provides another example of the fact that a defendant\nneed not be present with the weapon when it is discovered to be deemed “armed” within\nthe meaning of the exception rendering a defendant ineligible for resentencing under the\nAct.\n       More recently, in T. White, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">243</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1354</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, a felon in possession of\na firearm prosecution, the Fourth Appellate District, Division Three, observed that “a\ndefendant is armed with a weapon even though it is not carried on his person, when he is\naware it is hidden in a place readily accessible to him.” (Id. at p. 1361.) This precisely\ndescribes the circumstance at issue here. Although the facts in T. White are different, in\nthe instant case the weapon was hidden in a place that was readily accessible to defendant\nwhen he was nearby.\n       In T. White, a police officer spotted the defendant walking down the street\ncarrying a fanny pack. (T. White, supra, 243 Cal.App.4th at p. 1358.) Because the\ndefendant matched the general description of a suspect in an armed robbery, the officer\ndrove his patrol car next to the defendant. (Ibid.) The defendant turned away and walked\ninto the parking lot of a motel, and the officer followed. (Ibid.) The officer lost sight of\nthe defendant but moments later, he saw the defendant walking along the second story\ncorridor of the motel. (Ibid.) The officer got out of his car and asked the defendant to\ncome speak with him and defendant came down the stairs toward the officer. (Ibid.) The\nofficer noted the fanny pack appeared to be less full than it had appeared before. (Ibid.)\nRetracing the defendant’s path, the officer found a loaded nine-millimeter semiautomatic\npistol in a trash can. (Ibid.) A search of the fanny pack revealed two bullets of the same\nmake and caliber as those in the gun. (Ibid.) The defendant testified at trial, denying that\nhe had a firearm when he arrived at the hotel and denying that he placed a firearm in the\ntrash can. (Ibid.) The defendant did admit, however, that he walked by the garbage can.\n\n                                             18\n\f(Ibid.) He testified he had found the two bullets on the motel stairs and picked them up.\n(Ibid.)\n          On appeal from the denial of his Proposition 36 petition, the defendant in T. White\ncontended that his case was different from the situation where the defendant is seen in\nactual possession and thus excluded under the arming exception.10 (T. White, supra, 243\nCal.App.4th at pp. 1357, 1361.) Unlike that situation, according to the defendant, he\ncould not be found to have been armed because the police never saw him discard the\nweapon in the trashcan or otherwise observed him in physical possession of it. (Id. at\np. 1361.) Rejecting that contention, the Court of Appeal reasoned, “it [was] clear [the]\ndefendant’s conviction was based on either the inference he discarded the gun into the\ntrash can on that occasion or he had placed it there earlier. Either way, his possession\namounts to being armed.” (Id. at p. 1357, italics added.) The court explained that the\njury necessarily concluded that the defendant possessed the gun found in the trash can,\nand, in turn, that finding necessarily implied that the defendant was “at least aware it was\nhidden there.” (Id. at p. 1361.) The Court of Appeal reasoned: “When [the] defendant\nwas first approached by the police officer in the street, he turned directly into the motel,\nand assuming he did not have the gun in his fanny pack, he went straight for the trash can\nwhere he knew it was already hidden. And as he walked by that trash can—as he\nconceded he did—that gun was readily accessible to him. That qualifies [the] defendant\nas being ‘armed.’ As our Supreme Court has explained, ‘ “[i]t is the availability—the\nready access—of the weapon that constitutes arming.” ’ ” (Id. at pp. 1361-1362, quoting\nBland, supra, 10 Cal.4th at p. 997.) The T. White court concluded: “So even if the jury\n\n\n\n10 Specifically, the defendant in T. White contended his case was distinguishable from\nM.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">512</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, where the officers saw defendant carrying rolled\nup sweatpants with an object inside. After defendant threw these items into the back of\nhis pickup truck, the officers recovered them and discovered the object in the sweatpants\nwas a handgun. (M. White, at p. 520.)\n\n                                               19\n\fbelieved [the] defendant’s testimony that he did not bring the gun into the motel on the\noccasion in question, its finding that he had possession of the gun located in the trash can,\ncombined with his admission he walked right by it immediately after the police officer\ndrove alongside him, demonstrates he qualified as armed during that possession.” (T.\nWhite, at p. 1362.)\n       Although the facts here are different, the circumstances are similar. The jury\nnecessarily found that defendant possessed the altered toothbrush with the razor melted\ninto the handle.11 Prior to its discovery, this weapon was readily accessible to defendant\nwhen he was in his cell.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1354</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the weapon was\nnot discovered on defendant’s person or the immediately surrounding area where the\ndefendant was stopped. However, the evidence supports a finding that defendant was\naware that the weapon was “hidden in a place readily accessible to him.” (Id. at p. 1361.)\nWe also note that both here and in T. White, the defendants were under control of law\nenforcement authorities in a different location when the weapons were discovered.\n       The case law thus teaches us not to limit the temporal focus for arming to the\nmoment when the weapon was discovered; such a focus is too narrow. (Bland, supra, 10\nCal.4th at p. 996 [Court of Appeal erred by focusing too narrowly on the defendant’s\nproximity to the assault weapon at the time police found the cocaine and the assault\nweapon in the defendant’s bedroom].) Possession of a weapon, like drug possession, can\nbe a continuing crime. Thus, when a weapon is available to a defendant to use\noffensively or defensively at any time during the actual or constructive possession of that\n\n\n\n\n11 The dissent comments that “at some unwitnessed point in time [defendant] was\npresumably in the cell with the weapon.” (Italics added.) In our view, this is not a matter\nsubject to speculation and we need not presume this fact. The jury convicted defendant\nof possession of the weapon found in his cell while he was taking a shower, and this court\nrejected his claim of insufficient evidence of possession in his appeal from that\nconviction. (Slip Opn., supra, at pp. 4-6.)\n\n                                             20\n\fweapon within the time period for which a defendant was charged, the defendant was\narmed. (See Bland, at p. 997.) The defendant need not be present at the moment when\nthe weapon is discovered, nor must the weapon be immediately available for his or her\nuse at that very moment.\n       Defendant relies on a hypothetical situation considered in Osuna, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1020</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, as supporting his position. In Osuna, an officer attempted to pull the\ndefendant over after he sped through a school zone. (Id. at p. 1027.) When the defendant\nfinally stopped and exited the car he was driving, he was holding a handgun. (Ibid.) The\ndefendant fled and, approximately 20 minutes later, police arrested him as he exited a\nhouse within the perimeter established by police. (Ibid.) Police searched the house and\nlocated a handgun in the air conditioning duct and its missing magazine outside the\nhome. (Ibid.) Police discovered a second magazine and ammunition in the vehicle the\ndefendant had been driving. (Ibid.) The Osuna court, affirming the denial of the\ndefendant’s Proposition 36 petition, concluded that the defendant was disqualified from\nresentencing under the Act because he was armed with a firearm during the commission\nof the current firearm possession offense. (Osuna, at p. 1040.) The Osuna court stated:\nthe “defendant was actually holding a handgun when he first got out of the car. Thus,\nfactually he was ‘armed with a firearm’ within the meaning of the Act.” (Osuna, at\np. 1030.) In dicta, the Osuna court also wrote: “A firearm can be under a person’s\ndominion and control without it being available for use. For example, suppose a\nparolee’s residence (in which only he lives) is searched and a firearm is found next to his\nbed. The parolee is in possession of the firearm, because it is under his dominion and\ncontrol. If he is not home at the time, however, he is not armed with the firearm, because\nit is not readily available to him for offensive or defensive use. Accordingly, possessing\n\n\n\n\n                                            21\n\fa firearm does not necessarily constitute being armed with a firearm.” (Ibid., fn.\nomitted.)12\n       The Osuna court did not discuss the reasoning in Bland or Delgadillo, cases with\nfacts that closely approximated the facts in the hypothetical. As a result, it does not\nappear that the Osuna court considered the Bland court’s observation that it is\n“immaterial” whether the defendant is present when the authorities find the weapon.\n(Bland, supra, 10 Cal.4th at p. 1000.) Even so, the Osuna hypothetical is inapt.13 Here,\n\n\n\n12  This dicta was recently repeated in another case involving actual possession of a\nfirearm by a felon. (People v. Frutoz (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 171, 177.)\n13  We are aware that other courts have stated that mere possession of a weapon does not\nestablish that the defendant was armed with the weapon because possession can be\nconstructive as well as actual. (See People v. Burnes (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">242</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1452</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1458, citing Blakely, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1057.) In M. White, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">223</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">512</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the court stated, “while the act of being armed with a firearm—that is,\nhaving ready access to a firearm [citation]—necessarily requires possession of the\nfirearm, possession of a firearm does not necessarily require that the possessor be armed\nwith it.” (Id. at p. 524.) The M. White court posed a hypothetical example in dicta\nsimilar to the one in Osuna to illustrate its perception of when a person in constructive\npossession of a weapon would not be armed: “For example, a convicted felon may be\nfound to be a felon in possession of a firearm if he or she knowingly kept a firearm in a\nlocked offsite storage unit even though he or she had no ready access to the firearm and,\nthus, was not armed with it.” (M. White, at p. 524.) None of these cases actually\ninvolved the specific situation where the defendant was not seen with the weapon and\nwas not present when the weapon was discovered. Indeed, in Burnes, the issue before the\ncourt related to the improper use of a probation report to determine the circumstances of\nthe defendant’s possession, not the sufficiency of evidence establishing arming. (Burnes,\nat p. 1455.) No other source of facts establishing the underlying circumstances of the\ndefendant’s possession was considered by the trial court in Burnes. In People v. Blakely\n(2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1322</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the defendant actually fired the weapon and admitted\nactual possession of it for purposes of self-defense (id. at p. 1049), so not only was he\nexcluded under the arming exception but also the personal use exception. In M. White,\nthe defendant was also in actual physical possession of the weapon. (M. White, at\npp. 524-525; see fn. 10, ante.) Constructive possession was not a theory of possession in\nthese cases. More important, like Osuna, these courts did not consider our high court’s\nobservation in Bland that the defendant need not be present when the weapon is found so\n\n                                             22\n\fdefendant left his cell briefly to take a shower. When he left the cell, his possession was\ncontinuing. Moments before he went to the shower, he was in his cell and in either\nconstructive or actual possession of the weapon. At a minimum, the weapon was readily\naccessible to him at that time and thus it was readily accessible during his possession of\nthe weapon. Additionally, the showers are located “[r]ight in the middle of the . . . tier,”\nwith five cells to each side of each shower. Unlike the hypothetical parolee described in\nOsuna who was not home (Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1030), defendant here\nwas “home.” He was simply in another part of his home, mere cell widths away from his\ncell taking a shower. And defendant would undoubtedly be returning to his cell directly\nfollowing his shower. Had the correctional officers not discovered the weapon, it would\nhave been readily accessible to him immediately upon his return from the showers.\n       Defendant’s circumstances here are more analogous to those of the defendant in\nPeople v. Elder (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1308</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Elder). In Elder, a law enforcement task\nforce executing a search warrant found the defendant outside the front door of his\napartment. (Id. at p. 1317.) Inside the apartment, law enforcement found a gun on an\nentertainment center and another gun in an unlocked safe in the bedroom. (Ibid.) The\n\n\n\n\nlong as the evidence demonstrates he or she had the weapon available for use “at any time\nduring [the] possession of the drugs.” (Bland, supra, 10 Cal.4th at p. 1000, italics added.)\nIn light of our high court’s reasoning in Bland, the fact that a defendant is only in\nconstructive possession as opposed to actual possession at the time the weapon is\ndiscovered does not mean he or she did not have the weapon available for use at some\nearlier point during the possession of that weapon. Having said that, we do not disagree\nthat there could be scenarios where a person is in knowing constructive possession of a\nweapon, yet was never near it or even touched it so as to be deemed armed, e.g., where a\nthird person places a weapon in a place over which the defendant has dominion and\ncontrol, tells the defendant it is at that location, but the weapon is discovered before the\ndefendant could go to that location.\n\n                                             23\n\fElder court concluded that the trial court properly determined that the defendant was\nineligible for resentencing because he was armed with a firearm. (Ibid.)14\n       In addition to Elder, defendant’s circumstances here are similar to each of the\nfollowing: the defendant in Bland who was in the police vehicle while the weapon and\ndrugs were discovered inside of his house; the defendant in Delgadillo who was detained\non a freeway while drugs and a firearm were found during the execution of a search\nwarrant at his home; the defendant in Hicks who was detained outside the apartment he\nwas there to visit, inside of which his backpack containing a gun was found; and the\ndefendant who was detained by the police officer at the motel in T. White while the gun\nwas found in a garbage can in an upstairs corridor where the defendant had been. In each\nof these cases, the weapon was not discovered on the defendant’s person or in his\nimmediate presence and the authorities never saw the defendant in actual possession of\nthe weapon. Yet, there was sufficient evidence to reasonably infer that, at some point\nduring the defendant’s possession of the weapon, he was present with it and that it was\nreadily accessible to him for his immediate use.\n       Defendant asserts he could not be armed, because in addition to being away from\nhis cell, he was “under guard and possibly handcuffed” when the weapon was found.\nThus, according to defendant, the weapon was not readily available for offensive or\ndefensive use. But this was the case in each of the cases we have just mentioned. Those\ndefendants were also detained or in custody at the time the weapons were found. We\nconclude defendant’s supervised visit to the shower did not make him eligible for\nsentence reduction under the Act. The arming exception still disqualifies him. Where, as\n\n\n\n14  However, in light of Bland, Delgadillo, Hicks, and T. White, we do not agree with the\nElder court’s seemingly inconsistent suggestion that a person could not be denied\nsentence reduction under the “armed” exception where the weapon “is under a\ndefendant’s dominion and control in a location not readily accessible to him at the time of\nits discovery.” (Elder, supra, 227 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1313-1314, italics added.)\n\n                                            24\n\fhere, the possessory offense is ongoing and defendant had the weapon available for use\nearlier, the arming exception makes him ineligible for resentencing under the Act. To\nconclude otherwise would mean that before he went to the shower, defendant was\nineligible for sentence reduction; while he was in the shower, he was eligible for sentence\nreduction; and when he returned from the shower (had the weapon not been discovered),\nhe was again ineligible for sentence reduction. It is difficult to accept the premise that it\nwas the intent of the electorate to make defendant eligible or ineligible for sentence\nreduction depending on the fortuity of the weapon being found while he was taking a\nshower.\n       Nor should his eligibility turn on the fact that inmates in administrative\nsegregation were not allowed to roam the cell block freely. Defendant’s eligibility for\nProposition 36 relief cannot conceivably turn on the fact that he was housed in\nadministrative segregation and, therefore, because he was escorted to the shower rather\nthan being free to enter and exit his cell with greater autonomy, he was not deemed to\nhave had the weapon available for use. This analysis would lead to an absurd result: an\ninmate housed elsewhere in the prison, with the ability to enter and exit his cell more\nfreely and to take showers with lesser supervision would be ineligible for Proposition 36\nrelief if a weapon were found in his cell while he was nearby taking a shower or\nelsewhere in the cellblock, but defendant would be eligible for relief because, due to the\ngreater danger he posed to other inmates and corrections officers, he had to be restrained\nwhenever he left his cell.\n       The dissent suggests the analysis in a Bland situation involving the possession of a\nweapon with drugs should be different than the analysis employed in a case involving a\npossession of a weapon charge. (Dis. opn. of Duarte, J., post, at p. 2.) According to the\ndissent, “[t]he key moment in time as well as in physical location for the ‘armed’\nclassification in the drug cases is the discovery of the drugs,” and the result would be\ndifferent if the weapon had been stored away from the drugs at the time when the drugs\n\n                                              25\n\fwere discovered. (Ibid.) We do not disagree. As we have noted, armed in the\ncommission of a drug offense requires both a facilitative nexus as well as a temporal\nnexus. (Hicks, supra, 231 Cal.App.4th at pp. 283-284.) Consequently, if the firearm is\nstored away from the drugs, a facilitative nexus could not be established based solely on\nthe concurrent possession of the weapon and drugs. But as Bland teaches, the defendant\nneed not be present when the drugs and weapon are found to be deemed armed. (Bland,\nsupra, 10 Cal.4th at p. 1000.) Moreover, in a weapon possession case where arming\nrequires that the weapon be available for a defendant’s use during the commission of the\nweapon possession, only a temporal nexus is required and that nexus has nothing to do\nwith where the defendant was located when the weapon is discovered. The temporal\nnexus is the concurrence of the point in time when the defendant has possession of the\nweapon and it is available for use. Thus, the key point in time for purposes of\ndetermining whether a defendant will be deemed to have been “armed” in a case\ninvolving constructive possession is whatever point in time the defendant had\nconstructive possession of the weapon and it was simultaneously available for use.\n       The dissent suggests that under our analysis, a defendant is “forever armed,” but\nthis temporal focus misses the mark. If a person commits a crime today and is not\napprehended until some future point in time, that person is still subject to prosecution for\nthe crime when he is apprehended (assuming charges are filed within the statute of\nlimitations). That person is no less culpable for the offense just because he was not\ncaught in the act and arrested at the time and place where the crime was committed.\nSimilarly, where, as here, a defendant constructively possessed a weapon and\nsimultaneously had it available for use offensively or defensively, he was armed at that\npoint in time, and it does not matter that he was later detained in some place other than\nwhere the arming had previously taken place. He still had the weapon available for use at\nthe earlier point in time. Thus, if he is charged with possession alleged to have taken\nplace at that earlier time and convicted, he may also be deemed armed at that earlier time\n\n                                             26\n\ffor purposes of the arming exception, rendering him ineligible for resentencing under the\nAct.15\n         In our view, the conclusion we reach here is consistent with the voters’ intent in\nenacting Proposition 36. The arguments expressed in support of Proposition 36\n“reflect[ed] an intent to ‘make the punishment fit the crime’ and ‘make room in prison for\ndangerous felons.’ ” (Johnson, supra, 61 Cal.4th at p. 686, quoting Voter Information\nGuide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012) argument in favor of Prop. 36, p. 52, italics added.) “In\nthis same vein, the ballot materials related to Proposition 36 (and therefore the\nresentencing statute) reflect an intent to ‘ “keep violent felons off the street” ’ and ‘\n“prevent[] dangerous criminals from being released early.” ’ ” (People v. Caraballo\n(2016) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">936</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 940, quoting Johnson, at p. 686, italics added.) These aims\nwould not be served by an interpretation of the statute requiring the narrow temporal\nfocus of arming advanced by defendant, a focus that would make him eligible for\nsentence reduction simply because he was not present with the weapon when it was\nfound, even though he had been present with it and it had been available for his use\nearlier. “[T]he plain purpose of these disqualifying factors is to serve as a prophylactic\nmeasure to further the goal of the Three Strikes law to protect society against recidivist\ncriminals who commit violent and/or serious crimes. In enacting Proposition 36, the\nvoters intended a third strike defendant who committed a current, nonviolent and\nnonserious crime would not be punished as severely as a third strike defendant whose\ncurrent crime was violent and/or serious. Nonetheless, the voters also intended to\nexclude those defendants who committed the current nonviolent and nonserious crime in\na manner that potentially could result in violent and/or serious consequences, which\nintent is manifest in the triad of disqualifying factors. As the court cogently reasoned in\n\n\n\n15 Defendant was charged with possession of the weapon “[o]n or about December 7,\n1998,” the same day when he left his cell to shower and the weapon was discovered.\n\n                                              27\n\f[Blakely, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1042</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">]: ‘It is clear the electorate’s intent was not to\nthrow open the prison doors for all third strike offenders whose current convictions were\nnot for serious or violent felonies, but only for those who were perceived as\nnondangerous or posing little or no risk to the public.’ ” (Newman, supra, 2 Cal.App.5th\nat pp. 724-725, first & third italics added.) Felons in possession of weapons and who\nhave them readily available for use at any time during the possession are obviously\ndangerous, particularly in a custodial setting. We see nothing in the statute, the ballot\narguments or any other source that suggests the voters intended dangerous felons to be\neligible for sentence reduction if they were lucky enough to be arrested or detained at a\nlocation where they could not easily put their hands on the weapon, even though they had\nit available for use at some earlier point in time during their possession of it.\n       Based on the foregoing, we conclude that substantial evidence supported the trial\ncourt’s determination that defendant was armed with a deadly weapon within the\nmeaning of sections 667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(iii), and 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(C)(iii), and that\nhe was thus ineligible for resentencing on this conviction.\n     C. Assault by Inmate by Means Likely to Cause Great Bodily Injury (§ 4501)\n       Defendant also asserts that substantial evidence does not support the trial court’s\ndetermination that, in committing the assault on another inmate in violation of section\n4501,16 he intended to cause great bodily injury. We disagree.\n       1. The Trial Court’s Findings\n       The trial court concluded that this court’s opinion on the appeal from the\nconviction clearly established the defendant intended to cause great bodily injury to the\n\n\n\n16  Section 4501 provides: “Every person confined in a state prison of this state except\none undergoing a life sentence who commits an assault upon the person of another with a\ndeadly weapon or instrument, or by any means of force likely to produce great bodily\ninjury, shall be guilty of a felony and shall be imprisoned in the state prison for two, four,\nor six years to be served consecutively.” (Stats. 1978, ch. 579, § 33.)\n\n                                              28\n\fvictim. Based on the opinion, the trial court noted that defendant “acted in concert with\ncellmate/codefendant Dubon and another inmate, in assaulting the victim; defendant was\nstriking the victim from the back at about the same time that Dubon struck the victim in\nthe front; defendant and Dubon kicked the victim with full force kicks; both ignored\norders from officers to stop fighting as well as the firing of a special gun, and kept on\nwith the assault; only after tear gas was set off did defendant and the others disperse,\nleaving the victim on the ground, not moving; the victim only later regained\nconsciousness and tried to stand but fell down a couple of times; the victim had suffered\nmultiple injuries to his face and head, including a large hematoma to his right forehead,\nan open contusion on his right forehead, a bloody nose, multiple bruising to his upper\nface, blood in his mouth, a shoe imprint on the left side of his face, and abrasions on both\nknees and elbows.”\n       Based on these facts, the trial court stated that it was “easily inferable . . . that\ndefendant intended to cause great bodily harm to the victim, by his participation and role\nin the assault, by the types of injuries inflicted on the victim, including one of the\nassailants stepping on the victim’s face so hard as to cause a shoe imprint and the\ninfliction of a large hematoma on the victim’s head, and by defendant’s continuing to\ninflict the injuries on the victim or enable his coparticipants to do so by not stopping the\nassault when officers attempted to have the assault come to an end.” The court\nconcluded, beyond a reasonable doubt, that a jury would have found that defendant acted\nwith intent to cause great bodily injury during the commission of this offense, and,\ntherefore, the court itself made such a finding. As a result, the court found defendant\nineligible for resentencing pursuant to section 1170.126 because, “ ‘[d]uring the\ncommission of the current offense, the defendant . . . intended to cause great bodily injury\nto another person,’ under the meaning of Penal Code §§ 667(e)(2)(C)(iii) and\n1170.12(c)(2)(C)(iii).”\n\n\n\n                                               29\n\f         2. Analysis\n         A defendant is ineligible for, or disqualified from, resentencing if he or she\n“intended to cause great bodily injury to another person.” (§§ 667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(iii),\n1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(C)(iii).) Section 12022.7, subdivision (f), defines “ ‘great bodily\ninjury’ ” as “a significant or substantial physical injury.” “However, ‘the injury need not\nbe so grave as to cause the victim “permanent,” “prolonged,” or “protracted” bodily\ndamage.’ [Citation.] ‘Proof that a victim’s bodily injury is “great” . . . is commonly\nestablished by evidence of the severity of the victim’s physical injury, the resulting pain,\nor the medical care required to treat or repair the injury.’ ” (People v. Woods (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 486.)\n         “The intent to inflict great bodily injury need not be proven by direct evidence.\nSuch intent may be inferred or presumed. ‘ “It is black-letter law that a party is presumed\nto intend to do that which he voluntarily or willfully does in fact do and also presumed to\nintend the natural, probable and usual consequences of his own acts.” ’ ” (In re Sergio R.\n(1991) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">228</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">588</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 601; see People v.

App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1120</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1124.)\n         We agree with the trial court’s findings based on this court’s opinion on\ndefendant’s original appeal. We also note from the trial transcript that a physician\ndetermined that the victim suffered left anterior and medial orbital wall factures, right\nmaxillary sinus fractures, and a nasal fracture.\n         Based on the descriptions of defendant’s participation in the assault, his\ncontinuation with the assault after corrections officers intervened, ceasing only when\nofficers employed tear gas, and the extent of injuries inflicted on the victim, we conclude\nthat substantial evidence supports the trial court’s determination that, in committing the\nassault, defendant intended to inflict great bodily injury. (See Newman, supra, 2\nCal.App.5th at p. 727; Guilford, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at p. 662.)\n\n\n\n                                               30\n\f       Contrary to defendant’s contention, the fact that there was no finding of great\nbodily injury at trial does not undermine this determination. Defendant was convicted of\nassault by a prisoner by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury. (§ 4501.)\nThere was no requirement that the People at trial prove the actual infliction of great\nbodily injury; the People were only required to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the\nassault was committed “by any means of force likely to produce great bodily injury.”\n(§ 4501; see fn. 16, ante.) And the Proposition 36 eligibility exception does not require\nthat defendant actually inflict great bodily injury; rather the plain language of the statute\nrequires only that defendant intended to cause such injury. (§§ 667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(iii),\n1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(C)(iii); see Newman, supra, 2 Cal.App.5th at p. 725 [“mere intent\nto cause great bodily injury” is required].) Moreover, as stated, ante, “the existence of a\ndisqualifying factor that would render a defendant ineligible for resentencing under\nProposition 36, which would lessen his punishment if he were eligible, is a determination\nsolely within the province of the Proposition 36 court to make without regard to any\nfactual finding by the trier of fact.” (Newman, at p. 724.) “[A] Proposition 36 court may\ndetermine whether one or more of these disqualifying factors exists independent of the\nelements of the current offense and any attendant sentence enhancement allegation.”\n(Newman, at p. 726.)\n       Defendant also asserts that there is no evidence that he personally inflicted great\nbodily injury on the victim, or that he personally caused any particular injury to the\nvictim. For this proposition, defendant cites section 12022, subdivision (a). However,\nthat section does not refer to great bodily injury; section 12022, subdivision (a), addresses\ncommitting or attempting to commit a felony while armed with a firearm. That section\nhas no relevance or applicability here. It appears that defendant intended to reference\nsection 12022.7, subdivision (a). That section provides an enhancement for the personal\ninfliction of great bodily injury. To the extent that defendant asserts an express finding\nthat he personally inflicted great bodily injury on the victim is necessary to infer his\n\n                                              31\n\fintent to inflict great bodily injury, we disagree. The disqualifying factor speaks to the\nintent to inflict great bodily injury, not the personal infliction of great bodily injury as\nrequired by section 12022.7, subdivision (a). (§§ 667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(iii), 1170.12,\nsubd. (c)(2)(C)(iii); see Newman, supra, 2 Cal.App.5th at p. 725.) Thus, the plain\nlanguage of the Act does not contain a personal infliction requirement. “ ‘We presume\nthe [electorate] intended everything in a statutory scheme, and we do not read statutes to\nomit expressed language or to include omitted language. [Citation.] When “ ‘ “ ‘a statute\non a particular subject omits a particular provision, the inclusion of such a provision in\nanother statute concerning a related matter indicates an intent that the provision is not\napplicable to the statute from which it was omitted.’ ” ’ ” ’ ” (Guilford, supra, 228\nCal.App.4th at p. 657.) Moreover, by convicting defendant of a violation of section\n4501, the jury did determine that defendant assaulted the victim by “means of force likely\nto produce great bodily injury.” (§ 4501.) His intent, thus, was inferable from the nature\nof the facts underlying the conviction.\n       We conclude that substantial evidence supports the trial court’s determination that\ndefendant intended to inflict great bodily injury on the victim within the meaning of\nsections 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iii), and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(C)(iii), rendering\nhim ineligible for resentencing on his conviction of a violation of section 4501.\n                                       DISPOSITION\n       The order appealed from is affirmed.\n\n\n                                                          MURRAY                 , J.\n\nI concur:\n\n\n\n      HULL                   , Acting P. J.\n\n\n\n\n                                              32\n\fDUARTE, J., Concurring and Dissenting.\n\n\n       I concur in all parts of the majority opinion except Part IV.B., from which I\nrespectfully dissent.\n       Absent some farfetched hypothetical, under the majority’s broad holding every\nweapon possession is armed if charged broadly enough. The majority opinion erases the\ndistinction between possession where the weapon is readily accessible to a defendant and\npossession where it is not. In my view, while both are valid theories of possession, only\nthe first is armed possession. Thus I am compelled to dissent.\n       The majority writes that because weapon possession “can be a continuing crime,”\n“when a weapon is available to a defendant to use offensively or defensively at any time\nduring the actual or constructive possession of the weapon within the time period for\nwhich defendant was charged, the defendant was armed.” (Maj. opn., ante, at pp. 20-21;\nsee also id. at p. 3 [a defendant is armed if “he or she was present with the weapon and\nhad it available for use at any time he or she had actual or constructive possession of it\nwithin the time period for which the defendant was charged and convicted”], all\nemphases in original.)\n       Under the majority’s holding, a hypothetical defendant who acquired a weapon\nand immediately secured it in a safe, then buried the safe and left the state, remaining\naway for multiple years, would be classified “armed” with that weapon were he\neventually charged with its possession. Apparently, this classification would be valid\nprovided the date range on the charging document encompassed the date of the weapon’s\nacquisition. This would be true even if the date of the weapon’s acquisition preceded the\nweapon’s discovery (and the corresponding discovery of defendant’s constructive\npossession of it) by years. This classification is merited merely because at some point\n(“at any time”) the defendant placed the weapon in the safe. At the time of its placement,\nthe weapon was readily accessible to him for use. Thus he is forever “armed” with it,\n\n                                              1\n\fdespite being many years and miles removed from the weapon at the time of its\ndiscovery.\n       I understand that these are not the facts of Valdez’s case; I discuss his specific\nsituation in detail below. But this is the broad effect of the holding’s application.\n       I disagree with the majority that People v. Bland (1995) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1208051\"><a href=\"/opinion/1208051/people-v-bland/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">991</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> compels\nthis conclusion. (See maj. opn., ante, at pp. 21-22.) In the drug cases of Bland and\nPeople v. Delgadillo (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1570</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, both relied on by the majority,\nbecause of the proximity of the guns at issue to the drugs, it was clear that the defendants\nwere armed with the guns at the time they were dealing drugs. But Bland and Delgadillo\nare not weapon possession cases; they are drug cases with weapon enhancements at issue.\nThose cases start with a completely separate offense from any arming analysis and build\non that offense, requiring proof that during commission of the continuing drug offense a\ndefendant had a weapon readily available for use to further that offense. This analysis\nstands in sharp contrast to the necessary analysis in a weapon possession case where the\n“armed” analysis is built on the same conduct as the charged possession. The key\nmoment in time as well as in physical location for the “armed” classification in the drug\ncases is the discovery of the drugs, the charged crime being drug possession for sale. In\nthose cases, at the time the defendants were discovered to be in (constructive) possession\nfor sale of the drugs, the guns were with the drugs, and easily accessible to the defendants\nwhile they were selling drugs. If the guns in those cases had been stored away from the\ndrugs at the time the drugs were discovered, the results of those cases would be different.\n       At the time Valdez was discovered to be in constructive possession of the weapon,\nit was stored and secured away from him. There is no evidence that Valdez was ever\nseen in actual possession of the weapon, as far as can be gleaned from this record. In my\nview, he cannot properly be classified as armed “during the commission of the current\noffense” merely because at some unwitnessed point in time he was presumably in the cell\nwith the weapon. As the majority acknowledges (maj. opn., ante, at pp. 22-23, fns. 14,\n\n                                              2\n\f15), published cases have agreed with my position in dicta, but those courts were not\ndirectly confronted with a case such as this one, where defendant’s criminal conviction\nwas based solely on evidence of constructive possession. Although I agree that those\ncases are not directly on point, I find them instructive.\n        In People v. White (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">223</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">512</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at pages 523-524, the Fourth\nAppellate District, Division One analyzed the application of the “armed” classification to\ndefendant’s conduct as a felon in possession who was spotted by the police in actual\npossession of the gun--carrying it--and then, witnessed by police, threw the gun into the\nbed of his truck, from where it was later recovered. I agree that White was armed during\nthe possession offense with which he was charged, as the trial and appellate courts found.\nBut the White court went on to note that although White was observed in actual physical\npossession of the firearm, conviction under the relevant statute (former Pen. Code,\n§ 12021, subd. (a))1 could also be under the theory of constructive possession. The court\nexplained that: “while the act of being armed with a firearm--that is, having ready access\nto a firearm [citing Bland]--necessarily requires possession of a firearm, possession of a\nfirearm does not necessarily require that a possessor be armed with it. For example, a\nconvicted felon may be found to be a felon in possession of a firearm if he or she\nknowingly kept a firearm in a locked offsite storage unit even though he or she had no\nready access to the firearm and, thus, was not armed with it.” (White, at p. 524.) The\nfelon contemplated by the White court in this analysis surely had ready access to that gun\nat some point--when he or she placed in the safe, at a minimum. Yet the White court\ndeclined to classify that hypothetical felon as armed with the gun, even though he was\nclearly in constructive possession of it, presumably at the time of its detection. Summing\nup, the court stressed that White’s offense was one of actual, not constructive, possession\n\n\n\n\n1   Undesignated statutory references are to the Penal Code.\n\n                                              3\n\fof the gun, given that White was carrying the gun at the time he was spotted by the\npolice, and emphasized that for this reason the “armed” classification was appropriate.\n(See Id. at pp. 525-526.)\n       This court seemed to be in basic agreement that there is a separation between\npossession and armed possession in People v. Elder (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1308</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, citing\nWhite and noting that White “makes the point that if constructive possession was the basis\nfor the prior conviction, not every conviction for possession will establish that a\ndefendant was armed.” (Id. at p. 1314, fn. 7.) Elder itself makes the point that “not every\ncommitment offense for unlawful possession of a gun necessarily involves being armed\nwith the gun, if the gun is not otherwise available for immediate use in connection with\nits possession, e.g., where it is under defendant’s dominion and control in a location not\nreadily accessible to him at the time of its discovery.” (Id. at pp. 1313-1314.) Although\nElder was outside the door of his apartment when the police caught him, there appear to\nhave been two accessible guns inside, as well as a recent photograph of defendant in\nactual possession of one of the guns. (Id. at p. 1317.) Elder’s conclusion that defendant\nwas “armed” with those guns which were immediately inside his apartment is much more\ndefensible than a conclusion that defendant here was “armed” with the altered toothbrush\ncontaining the razor, found hidden in one of the cubicles in his shared cell while he was\nsecured in the shower area and unable to get to his cell. The relationship between\ndefendant and his altered toothbrush in this case in precisely that described by the Elder\ncourt, “e.g., where [the altered toothbrush] is under defendant’s dominion and control in a\nlocation not readily accessible to him at the time of its discovery.” (Ibid.)\n       The Fifth Appellate District’s People v. Osuna (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1020</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at\npage 1030, agrees with the idea that constructive possession does not equate to “armed”\npossession without at least some indication of ready access in close temporal proximity to\nthe discovery of the offense. Being secured elsewhere and unable to access the cell\ncontaining the weapon, let alone the cubicle or the weapon itself, is akin to the\n\n                                              4\n\fhypothetical parolee in Osuna whose bedroom is searched while he is away from home.\nAlthough the majority classifies any comparison of Osuna with the instant case as inapt\n(maj. opn., ante, at pp. 22-24), I do not agree that Valdez was “simply in another part of\nhis home” (id. at p. 23) while he was held by force in another part of the facility and\nunable to return to his cell. The record does not indicate that Valdez had any access to\nhis cell while he was detained away from it, much less ready access to the weapon\nsecreted therein. The majority also discusses People v. White (2016) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">243</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1354</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at pages 1361-1362, where the Fourth Appellate District, Division One upheld an\nineligibility finding by the trial court based on the armed classification. There, the\nevidence produced at trial showed that not only was defendant likely carrying the gun in\nhis fanny pack when first observed by law enforcement, but also that he was admittedly\nwithin arm’s reach of the gun during the course of the pursuit which resulted in his being\napprehended and charged with the gun’s possession. (Id. at p. 1358.)\n       These cases require at least some evidence of ready access to the weapon at the\ntime its discovery was ongoing, although they are arguably trending toward broadening\nthat requirement. I am not inclined to continue down this slippery slope and further blur\nthe line between actual and constructive possession, and current and remote availability\nof the weapon for use.2 Being armed with a weapon requires possessing that weapon in a\nmanner which heightens the ease and probability of its use. The record shows only that\nValdez constructively possessed a sharp object, which was first seen hidden in his cell\nwhile he was detained elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n2 To the extent an earlier case from this court does not appear to require witnessed or\nadmitted availability of the weapon to the defendant during its discovery (see People v.\nHicks (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">231</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> [defendant armed where witnesses saw backpack\ncontaining gun in defendant’s possession at some point, but timing of backpack’s\npossession by defendant unclear]), I disagree for the reasons I have discussed.\n\n                                              5\n\f       In People v. Burnes (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">242</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1452</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, although the defendant\nadmitted possession of a firearm and possession of a deadly weapon with his no contest\npleas to those counts, the Sixth Appellate District reversed the trial court’s determination\nthat defendant was armed for purposes of assessing eligibility for Proposition 47 relief.\nThe reversal was due to the trial court’s reliance on the probation report to find facts\nsupporting its determination; however, had the mere fact of conviction on the firearm and\nweapon possession counts been enough to establish that defendant was “armed,” reversal\nwould not have been required. Any error in reliance on the probation report would have\nbeen harmless. Thus at least impliedly, the Burnes court agreed that the defendant’s\nconviction of these possession offenses did not automatically equate to his being armed.\n       To the extent that the majority relies on policy to justify its broad holding, I\ncertainly agree that weapon possession by prisoners is dangerous. However, defendant’s\noffense was not classified by the electorate as a disqualifying offense per se. (See\n§ 1170.126, subd. (e)(1), cross-referencing § 667.5, subd. (c).) Only if he were actually\n“armed” with the weapon “during the commission of the current offense”--constructive\npossession of the weapon--is he precluded from seeking recall of sentence. (§ 1170.126,\nsubd. (e)(2), cross-referencing § 667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(iii).) If he is permitted to seek\nrecall because he was in constructive possession of the weapon but not armed with it, he\nis still subject to the trial court’s determination as to whether his resentencing poses an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (§ 1170.126, subd. (f).) The trial court may\nconsider all of those concerns expressed by the majority opinion in its determination of\nrisk, as well as any other relevant evidence. (See § 1170.126, subd. (g).)\n       The question before us is not whether defendant is dangerous, or the intent of the\nelectorate in approving Proposition 36, but simply whether defendant was armed in the\ncommission of the current offense. “ ‘[I]t is the availability--the ready access--of the\nweapon that constitutes arming.’ ” (People v. Bland, supra, 10 Cal.4th at p. 997.) On the\nrecord we were provided, it cannot be said that Valdez was armed in the commission of\n\n                                              6\n\fhis constructive possession offense. Nor can it be said that my hypothetical defendant,\nlong separated by time and distance from his gun, is forever armed with it and thereby\nineligible to petition for recall of his sentence.\n       For these reasons, I respectfully disagree with the majority’s analysis and\nconclusion in Part IV.B.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       Duarte                , J.\n\n\n\n\n                                                7\n\f</pre>",
