PENAL CODE ANN. § 22.01(b)(2) (West Supp. 2016).\n\ftrue to the allegations in two enhancement paragraphs, the trial court assessed his\n\npunishment at twenty-five years’ confinement. In two issues, appellant contends\n\nthat (1) the trial court erroneously limited his cross-examination of a witness by\n\nrefusing to allow him to cross-examine the witness about her interest in ongoing\n\nchild-custody proceedings involving appellant’s and the complainant’s daughter,\n\nand (2) the trial court erroneously excluded evidence concerning the complainant’s\n\nviolent character.\n\n      We reverse and remand.\n\n                                      Background\n\nA.    Factual Background\n\n      On December 17, 2014, appellant was living in a house with his girlfriend,\n\nthe complainant Amy Jimenez, their one-year-old daughter, and Jimenez’s mother,\n\nAdeline Gonzales. All four of them started watching a movie in the living room of\n\nthe house. Appellant made inappropriate comments about a scene in the movie, and\n\nJimenez told him to stop because Gonzales was in the room. Gonzales testified that\n\n“there was a lot of frustration in the room.” She left the room with the baby, and\n\nappellant went into the garage. Gonzales later returned to the living room and told\n\nJimenez that the baby needed some items from the store for school. Appellant’s and\n\nGonzales’s accounts of what happened after this point differ dramatically.\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\f      According to appellant, after he left the living room, he stayed in the garage\n\nfor about an hour and a half playing a game on his cell phone. Jimenez “came in the\n\ngarage a few times” and talked to him. Defense counsel asked whether there was a\n\nfight every time Jimenez came into the garage, and appellant replied that there was\n\nno fight, but “she was trying to pick a fight[.]”\n\n      Appellant was sitting between two cars playing on his phone, basically\n\nignoring Jimenez. She then got “in [his] face” and “karate kick[ed the] phone out of\n\n[his] hand.” When asked by his counsel whether Jimenez slapped the phone down\n\nor kicked it, appellant replied, “She did a pretty good karate kick.” He stated that\n\nthe phone “hit the car, fell on the floor. I’m in a tight little space. She kind of hit\n\nmy hand pretty hard.” Appellant then slapped Jimenez. When asked whether\n\nGonzales saw the confrontation, appellant replied, “I doubt it” because of the tight\n\narea and because Jimenez’s back was “towards the window of the kitchen by the\n\ndoor” to the garage.\n\n      According to Gonzales, however, Jimenez went out to the garage, and she and\n\nappellant started arguing. Jimenez wanted the keys to the car to go to the store, and\n\nappellant would not answer her. Gonzales testified that she had the baby in her arms,\n\nand she opened the garage door to give Jimenez some money. She saw appellant\n\ntake “a swing at [Jimenez] and he hit her in the face.” The prosecutor then asked\n\nher, “Now prior to you seeing that, did you see [Jimenez] make any contact, physical\n\n\n                                           3\n\fcontact with the defendant?” Gonzales replied, “She was trying to get his attention.\n\nHe had a cell phone in his hand. She whacked the phone in his hand.”\n\n      Gonzales did not know what happened to the phone, but, in response to the\n\nprosecutor’s statement, “So you’re saying you saw [Jimenez] make contact with his\n\nphone,” she replied, “Right, trying to get his attention.”        In response to the\n\nprosecutor’s question, “What did that sound like when he struck your daughter?”\n\nGonzales testified, “I mean, it was pretty hard because her whole face went back. I\n\nlooked back at her. I saw blood coming out of her face,” out of “[h]er lip, right here,\n\nmouth.” Gonzales then started screaming to appellant, “I told you not to put your\n\nhands on her anymore.” She stated, “I had the baby in my arms and I told [Jimenez],\n\nI said, Get out, get in your car, go your dad’s house.” Jimenez looked “pretty scared.\n\nShe had a look on her face I had never seen before and I’m a mother. I felt what I\n\nwas looking at and I said, Get out of here, get in your car and go. And I’ll call you\n\nwhen you can come back.” Gonzales then called 9-1-1. She testified that she did\n\nnot see Jimenez kick appellant “at any point,” explaining, “I was standing in the\n\nmiddle of them by that time and there was a car there.”\n\n      Appellant did not immediately leave after the altercation with Jimenez. He\n\ndemanded to kiss and hug his daughter. He testified, “[Gonzales] is real possessive\n\nof my daughter. She wouldn’t let me get my daughter. So I stayed around longer.\n\n[Gonzales was] yelling at me. And I’m yelling at her, just trying to see my daughter\n\n\n                                          4\n\freal quick before I left.” No other blows were thrown. Appellant testified that he\n\nwent back into the house to get his wallet and identification, and when he discovered\n\nthat Gonzales had called 9-1-1, he jumped the fence and went to the park. Appellant\n\ncame back to the house after the police arrived, and he was arrested.\n\n      Jimenez had left the scene in response to Gonzales’s order before any of this\n\nhappened. Gonzales testified extensively, however, as to appellant’s behavior after\n\nJimenez left. According to her testimony, appellant ransacked the interior of the\n\nhouse and came back into the garage, “[s]creaming obscenities, calling me\n\neverything in the book and ransacking what he could. I had [the baby] in my arms.\n\nI was more afraid of that than anything else.” She stated, “I was afraid to go back in\n\nthe house.” Appellant came back into the garage, and the baby was “crying, crying,”\n\nand Gonzales was trying to calm her down. Appellant picked up a jack that was in\n\nthe garage and started swinging it just a couple of feet from Gonzales while\n\nscreaming obscenities at her, including “Get your own F’ing baby. This is my F’ing\n\nbaby. You rotten F’ing B. It was going on and on.” She stated that appellant also\n\nkicked the doors to her car. She kept screaming, “Get out of here, get out of here,\n\nget of here,” and appellant said in response, “I’m going to get out of here when I kiss\n\nmy baby.”\n\n      According to Gonzales, appellant grabbed the baby, saying “I just want to hug\n\nmy baby,” while Gonzales still held the baby in her arms. Gonzales “kept telling\n\n\n                                          5\n\f[appellant] to leave [the baby] alone because she started crying. And he grabbed her\n\nlittle leg and he started doing this to her little body. And it scared me, because I said,\n\nMy God, he could have ripped her spinal cord. I let her go.” Appellant stepped\n\naway “because he was leaving with [the baby],” holding her “like a rag doll under\n\nhis arm. And she was crying and crying. He’s screaming.” Gonzales testified that\n\nthe baby\n\n      was pushing and pushing and she was screaming this loud cry like I\n      never heard it before. [Appellant] finally puts her down because she’s\n      wiggling to get away from him. He puts her down and he kind of\n      nudges her and I ran toward her and I grabbed her. I had her in my\n      arms. I wouldn’t let her go. He was still screaming at me, I’m going to\n      get her. I’m going to get her. At that point I was going to do whatever\n      I needed to do because I wasn’t going to let her go.\n\nWhen the police arrived, appellant went back inside the house and escaped out the\n\nback door over the fence.\n\n      Gonzales testified that Jimenez drove up a few minutes later, and “[s]he was\n\nmad, telling me, Mom, why did you call the police?              Why did you call the\n\npolice. . . . She’s upset and she’s screaming. I’m trying to regroup to what’s just\n\nhappening. The baby’s still crying and it’s a whole lot of commotion going on at\n\nthe same time.” Jimenez “had a big ball in her lip. . . . You could see a little dried\n\nblood on her face. She had a big ball on her lip here.” Both Gonzales and Jimenez\n\nwere interviewed by the police.\n\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\f      When asked whether he told his side of the story to the police, appellant\n\ntestified, “I didn’t feel like my story means anything. Two angry women.” He also\n\ntestified that Jimenez did not file charges against him, she failed to receive a letter\n\nof non-prosecution to sign that he had sent to her, and she came to visit him every\n\nday he was in jail prior to trial. Appellant testified that Jimenez and Gonzales had a\n\nvolatile relationship, but the court sustained as irrelevant the State’s objection to the\n\nquestion of whether appellant had ever seen Jimenez strike her mother. Appellant\n\nfinally testified that the other cases he had had involving family violence also had to\n\ndo with knocking a phone out of someone’s hand; he was charged and pled guilty in\n\norder “[t]o come home and take care of my child.”\n\n      Houston Police Department Officer J. Portillo responded to Gonzales’s 9-1-1\n\ncall. As he approached the house, he saw Gonzales and Jimenez walk into the\n\ngarage. Both of them “seemed pretty upset and emotional.” Officer Portillo\n\nobserved redness on Jimenez’s face and a cut on her upper lip. Although Jimenez\n\nultimately spoke with Officer Portillo, she initially did not want to speak to police.\n\nOfficer Portillo did not see any damage to property in the garage, and the inside of\n\nthe house did not appear to have been ransacked, as Gonzales had testified.\n\n\n\n\n                                           7\n\fB.    Procedural Background\n\n      After voir dire but before the jury was sworn in, defense counsel sought\n\npermission to introduce evidence of an ongoing Child Protective Services (“CPS”)\n\nproceeding to terminate the parental rights of both appellant and Jimenez to their\n\ndaughter. Counsel argued:\n\n      [Defense Counsel]:         The third and last point, Judge, it is my\n                                 understanding that CPS is involved and the\n                                 welfare of the [child] in whether or not\n                                 parental rights were taken from the\n                                 complaining witness, [Jimenez], and the\n                                 defendant, and that one of the persons who\n                                 may be—I don’t know how to put this\n                                 gently—would get the grandchild would be\n                                 the mother. Again, it would go to motive as\n                                 to why—if she sat up there and saw, based on\n                                 the police report, if she saw mutual\n                                 conduct—\n\n      The Court:                 So you want to ask Adeline Gonzales\n                                 whether there’s a CPS investigation and\n                                 whether she gets the children if that CPS\n                                 issue was sustained?\n\n      [Defense Counsel]:         Yes.\n\nThe trial court ruled that this evidence was not relevant. Defense counsel also sought\n\npermission to question Gonzales about Jimenez’s reputation in the community for\n\nviolence and, specifically, whether Jimenez had ever been violent towards Gonzales.\n\nThe trial court ruled that this evidence was not relevant and was inadmissible under\n\nRule of Evidence 608.\n\n\n                                          8\n\f      Later in the trial, after Gonzales had testified before the jury, defense counsel\n\nmade an offer of proof concerning testimony from Gonzales that the trial court had\n\nexcluded. Gonzales testified that Jimenez had threatened her on a few occasions in\n\nthe past. She also testified that Jimenez had hit her on several occasions and that\n\nJimenez had been the initial aggressor. With respect to the termination proceedings,\n\ndefense counsel and Gonzales had the following exchange:\n\n      Q.    Do you know that there’s a CPS—that there’s a child custody\n            battle going on to eliminate parental rights of both Amy and\n            Dedric?\n      A.    Yes, sir.\n      Q.    Do you have an interest in that being done?\n      A.    I don’t understand what that means.\n      Q.    Do you have a preference?\n      A.    Do I have a preference of what?\n      Q.    That their parental rights be terminated or not?\n      A.    I don’t have any say in that. That damage has been done between\n            the both of them.\n      Q.    My understanding is the child is with an aunt; is that correct?\n      A.    My sister.\n      Q.    Your sister?\n      A.    Yes. And before that, she was with me. I had her. I’ve always\n            had her.\n      Q.    The reason that you take care of the child is because of the\n            relationship that Dedric and Amy have, correct?\n      A.    I’m sorry?\n\n\n                                          9\n\f      Q.     It’s because of the type of relationship that Amy and Dedric have\n             and the things that they do destructive towards each other,\n             correct?\n      A.     I’m not sure I want to answer that.\n      Q.     The reason—\n      A.     Yes, that’s why I take care of her because I want her to be safe.\n             She’s a beautiful little girl. She deserves to be safe. (Witness\n             crying.)\n      Q.     In this particular case, it is your testimony that Amy hit Dedric\n             first, correct?\n      A.     She slapped the phone in his hands.\n\n      The jury ultimately found appellant guilty of the offense of assault on a family\n\nmember.    After appellant pleaded true to the allegations in two enhancement\n\nparagraphs, the trial court assessed his punishment at twenty-five years’\n\nconfinement. This appeal followed.\n\n                                  Preservation of Error\n\n      We first consider whether appellant preserved his complaint about his cross-\n\nexamination of Gonzales for appellate review.\n\n      The dissenting opinion argues that appellant failed to preserve his complaint\n\nfor appellate review because his offer of proof about Gonzales’s testimony regarding\n\nCPS termination proceedings was insufficient to establish Gonzales’s alleged bias\n\nagainst appellant. A party may complain on appeal about a ruling excluding\n\nevidence if the error “affects a substantial right of the party” and the party “informs\n\nthe court of [the evidence’s] substance by an offer of proof, unless the substance was\n\n                                          10\n\fapparent from the context.” TEX. R. EVID. 103(a). An offer of proof may consist of\n\na concise statement by counsel that includes a reasonably specific summary of the\n\nevidence and the relevance of the evidence, or the offer may be in question-and-\n\nanswer form. Mays v. State, 285 S.W.3d 884, 889–90 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009). “The\n\nprimary purpose of an offer of proof is to enable an appellate court to determine\n\nwhether the exclusion was erroneous and harmful. A secondary purpose is to permit\n\nthe trial judge to reconsider his ruling in light of the actual evidence.” Id. at 890.\n\n      Here, before the jury was sworn in, defense counsel stated that he wished to\n\nquestion Gonzales about several matters, including an ongoing CPS proceeding to\n\nterminate the parental rights of appellant and Jimenez, noting that Gonzales could\n\nget custody of the child and this would be relevant to her motive to testify. The trial\n\ncourt ruled that this evidence was not relevant. Later, after questioning Gonzales,\n\ndefense counsel put on an offer of proof concerning several topics, including\n\nGonzales’s knowledge of, and interest in, the ongoing termination proceedings.\n\nGonzales testified that she was aware of the termination proceedings, but she did not\n\n“have any say” in whether the court terminated appellant’s and Jimenez’s parental\n\nrights. Gonzales then testified that the child was currently staying with her sister,\n\nalthough before that the child had always lived with Gonzales, and that she would\n\ntake care of the child because she wanted the child to be safe. We conclude that this\n\noffer of proof sufficiently informed the trial court of the substance of the evidence\n\n\n                                           11\n\fthat appellant sought to introduce, and appellant therefore preserved his complaint\n\nabout the exclusion of this evidence. See TEX. R. EVID. 103(a); Mays, 285 S.W.3d\n\nat 889–90.\n\n      The dissenting opinion complains about procedural defects concerning\n\nappellant’s offer of proof.      Specifically, the dissenting opinion argues that\n\nappellant’s offer of proof failed to segregate admissible evidence from inadmissible\n\nevidence, such as Gonzales’s testimony regarding Jimenez’s past violent conduct,\n\nand that appellant failed to obtain a ruling on the admissibility of the evidence\n\nrelating to the termination proceeding.\n\n      The dissent cites this Court’s opinion in Sohail v. State for the proposition that\n\nwhen a party proffers evidence containing both admissible and inadmissible\n\nevidence but does not segregate the evidence to offer only the admissible statements,\n\nthe trial court may properly exclude all the statements. See 264 S.W.3d 251, 261\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2008, pet. ref’d). While this is a correct statement\n\nof the law, Sohail does not involve an offer of proof. Rather, in Sohail, the defendant\n\nsought to introduce into evidence during his case-in-chief a letter, an affidavit to\n\ndismiss a protective order, and a tape recording of the complainant’s conversation\n\nwith an unidentified individual, all of which included both admissible and\n\ninadmissible evidence. Id. The defendant did not attempt to redact the inadmissible\n\nstatements from these exhibits. Id. at 260. As a result, this Court held that the trial\n\n\n                                          12\n\fcourt properly excluded the exhibits because they contained inadmissible evidence.\n\nId. at 261.\n\n      The instant case involves an offer of proof, which, necessarily, is made after\n\nthe trial court has already ruled that evidence is inadmissible and has excluded that\n\nevidence. See TEX. R. EVID. 103(a)(2); Mays, 285 S.W.3d at 889 (stating that to\n\npreserve error regarding trial court’s decision to exclude evidence, complaining\n\nparty must make offer of proof setting forth substance of proffered evidence). The\n\nreason appellant made his offer of proof, which contained testimony from Gonzales\n\non several subjects, including the termination proceedings and Jimenez’s past\n\nviolent conduct, was that the trial court had already excluded all of this evidence.\n\n      The dissent also argues that appellant failed to obtain a ruling on the\n\nadmissibility of the offered testimony concerning the termination proceedings. This\n\nis incorrect. After voir dire, but before the jurors had been sworn in, the trial court,\n\ndefense counsel, and the State discussed on the record “issues of admissibility of\n\ncertain pieces of evidence.” Defense counsel stated that he wished to question\n\nGonzales about the termination proceedings. The trial court stated, “I’m going to\n\nfind the CPS investigation and any potential outcomes are not relevant to this trial\n\nand in fact would be more [prejudicial] to the defendant.” The trial court did not\n\ndefer ruling on admissibility—it immediately ruled right then that evidence\n\nconcerning the termination proceedings was not relevant and was, thus,\n\n\n                                          13\n\finadmissible. Later, after Gonzales testified in front of the jury, appellant put on his\n\noffer of proof. Appellant obtained a ruling on the admissibility of the evidence of\n\nthe termination proceedings. He was not required to obtain a second ruling on the\n\nevidence after he made his offer of proof, which he made because the trial court\n\nexcluded the evidence of the termination proceedings.2 See TEX. R. EVID. 103(a).\n\n      We conclude that appellant preserved his complaint regarding Gonzales’s bias\n\nfor appellate review, and we turn to his appeal.\n\n                                Denial of Cross-Examination\n\n      In his first issue, appellant contends that the trial court violated the\n\nConfrontation Clause by erroneously limiting his cross-examination of Gonzales\n\nconcerning any interest she might have in ongoing child-custody proceedings\n\ninvolving appellant’s and Jimenez’s daughter. He contends that the inability to\n\nquestion Gonzales about her motivation in testifying against him—specifically her\n\ninterest in possibly gaining custody of his child—together with his inability to\n\nquestion Gonzales regarding Jimenez’s past history of violence, severely\n\nundermined his ability to present his defense that he slapped Jimenez in self-defense.\n\n\n\n2\n      As support for the argument that appellant failed to obtain a ruling, the dissent cites\n      Geuder v. State, 115 S.W.3d 11, 14–15 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003), which held that a\n      pretrial motion in limine generally does not preserve error concerning the exclusion\n      of evidence. Geuder did not address offers of proof or whether the complaining\n      party, after obtaining a ruling excluding evidence, must obtain an additional ruling\n      after making an offer of proof—a ruling which would have no function.\n                                            14\n\fThus, appellant makes two critical arguments in this issue. First, he was denied the\n\nconstitutional right of confrontation. Second, the ability to confront Gonzales as to\n\nher interest in the custody proceedings was essential to his ability to prove his\n\ndefense of self-defense as she was the only witness besides himself who testified as\n\nto the facts of the confrontation between himself and Jimenez, upon which he was\n\nconvicted and sentenced to twenty-five years’ confinement.            We agree with\n\nappellant.\n\nA.    Cross-Examination: The Constitutional Right of Confrontation\n\n      Cross-examination serves three general purposes: to identify the witness with\n\nthe community so that independent testimony regarding the witness’s reputation for\n\nveracity may be sought, to allow the jury to assess the credibility of the witness, and\n\nto allow facts to be brought out tending to discredit the witness by showing that his\n\ntestimony was untrue or biased. Carroll v. State, 916 S.W.2d 494, 497 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1996). Cross-examination is, by its nature, exploratory, “and there is no\n\ngeneral requirement that the defendant indicate the purpose of his inquiry.” Id.\n\nRather, the defendant “should be granted a wide latitude even though he is unable to\n\nstate what facts he expects to prove through his cross-examination.” Id.\n\n      The classic case on the right of confrontation under circumstances similar to\n\nthose in this case is Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 94 S. Ct. 1105 (1974). In that\n\ncase, the United States Supreme Court held that the Confrontation Clause means\n\n\n                                          15\n\fmore than the right of an accused in a criminal prosecution to be allowed to confront\n\nthe witnesses against him “physically.” Id. at 315, 94 S. Ct. at 1110. “The main and\n\nessential purpose of confrontation is to secure for the opponent the opportunity of\n\ncross-examination,” as this is “the principal means by which the believability of a\n\nwitness and the truth of his testimony are tested.” Id. at 315–16, 94 S. Ct. at 1110;\n\nsee Johnson v. State, 433 S.W.3d 546, 551 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014) (quoting Davis,\n\n415 U.S. at 315–16, 94 S. Ct. at 1110). The defendant is not only permitted to delve\n\ninto the witness’s story to test his perceptions and memory but is traditionally\n\nallowed to impeach or discredit the witness. Davis, 415 U.S. at 316, 94 S. Ct. at\n\n1110. A defendant’s\n\n      attack on the witness’s credibility is effected by means of cross-\n      examination directed toward revealing possible biases, prejudices, or\n      ulterior motives of the witness as they may relate directly to issues or\n      personalities in the case at hand. The partiality of a witness is subject\n      to exploration at trial and is “always relevant to discrediting the witness\n      and affecting the weight of his testimony.”\n\nId. (quoting 3A J. Wigmore, Evidence § 940, p. 775 (Chadbourn rev. 1970)).\n\n      “[E]xposure of a witness’ motivation in testifying is a proper and important\n\nfunction of the constitutionally protected right of cross-examination.” Delaware v.\n\nVan Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 678–79, 106 S. Ct. 1431, 1435 (1986); Carpenter v.\n\nState, 979 S.W.2d 633, 634 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998) (“Exposing a witness’\n\nmotivation to testify for or against the accused or the State is a proper and important\n\npurpose of cross-examination.”). “The possible animus, motive, or ill will of a\n                                          16\n\fprosecution witness who testified against the defendant is never a collateral or\n\nirrelevant inquiry, and the defendant is entitled, subject to reasonable restrictions, to\n\nshow any relevant fact that might tend to establish ill feeling, bias, motive, interest,\n\nor animus on the part of any witness testifying against him.” Billodeau v. State, 277\n\nS.W.3d 34, 42–43 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009); see Johnson v. State, 490 S.W.3d 895,\n\n909–10 (Tex. Crim. App. 2016).\n\n      Particularly pertinent to this case is the Supreme Court’s holding in Davis that\n\nthe defendant in that case had the right to attempt to show that a prosecution witness\n\nwho was on probation was biased against the defendant because of the witness’s\n\n“vulnerable status.” 415 U.S. at 317–18, 94 S. Ct. at 1111; see also Carroll, 916\n\nS.W.2d at 500 (“Appellant’s cross-examination was clearly an attempt to\n\ndemonstrate that [the witness] held a possible motive, bias or interest in testifying\n\nfor the State. . . . A defendant is permitted to elicit any fact from a witness intended\n\nto demonstrate that witness’s vulnerable relationship with the state.”). The Davis\n\nCourt observed,\n\n      We cannot speculate as to whether the jury, as sole judge of the\n      credibility of a witness, would have accepted this line of reasoning had\n      counsel been permitted to fully present it. But we do conclude that the\n      jurors were entitled to have the benefit of the defense theory before\n      them so that they could make an informed judgment as to the weight to\n      place on [the witness’s] testimony which provided “a crucial link in the\n      proof . . . of petitioner’s act.”\n\n\n\n\n                                           17\n\f415 U.S. at 317, 94 S. Ct. at 1111 (quoting Douglas v. Alabama, 390 U.S. 415, 419,\n\n85 S. Ct. 1074, 1077 (1965)) (emphasis added).\n\n      The scope of appropriate cross-examination is necessarily broad. Carroll, 916\n\nS.W.2d at 497. It encompasses all facts and circumstances that, tested by human\n\nexperience, tend to show that the witness may shade his testimony for the purpose\n\nof establishing one side of the cause only. Id. at 497–98 (quoting Jackson v. State,\n\n482 S.W.2d 864, 868 (Tex. Crim. App. 1972)). Accordingly, a defendant is entitled\n\nto pursue all avenues of cross-examination reasonably calculated to expose a motive,\n\nbias, or interest for the witness’s testimony. Lewis v. State, 815 S.W.2d 560, 565\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1991).\n\n      A defendant’s constitutional right to confrontation is violated when\n\nappropriate cross-examination is limited. See Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 679, 106 S.\n\nCt. at 1435; Carroll, 916 S.W.2d at 497. The trial court has no discretion to so\n\ndrastically curtail the defendant’s cross-examination as to leave him unable to show\n\nwhy the witness might have been biased or otherwise lacked the level of impartiality\n\nexpected of a witness. Johnson, 433 S.W.3d at 555. However, the proponent of the\n\nevidence “must establish some causal connection or logical relationship between the\n\n[source of bias] and the witness’ ‘vulnerable relationship’ or potential bias or\n\nprejudice for the State, or testimony at trial.” Carpenter, 979 S.W.2d at 634\n\n\n\n\n                                        18\n\f(analyzing admissibility of evidence of pending charges against witness); see Irby v.\n\nState, 327 S.W.3d 138, 147–48 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010) (same).\n\nB.    Law Concerning Defense of Self-Defense\n\n      Appellant argues that he hit Jimenez in self-defense after she karate-kicked\n\nhis phone out of his hands. Self-defense is statutorily defined and provides a defense\n\nto prosecution when the conduct in question is “justified.” TEX. PENAL CODE ANN.\n\n§§ 9.02, 9.31 (West 2011). Under Texas Penal Code Chapter 9, “a person is justified\n\nin using force against another when and to the degree the actor reasonably believes\n\nthe force is immediately necessary to protect the actor against the other’s use or\n\nattempted use of unlawful force.” Id. § 9.31(a). “The use of force against another\n\nis not justified,” either “in response to verbal provocation alone” or “if the actor\n\nprovoked the other’s use or attempted use of unlawful force.” Id. § 9.31(b)(1), (4).\n\n      When a defense of self-defense is raised, as here, the reviewing court’s task\n\nis to “determine whether after viewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to\n\nthe prosecution, any rational trier of fact would have found the essential elements of\n\n[the crime] beyond a reasonable doubt and also would have found against appellant\n\non the self-defense issue beyond a reasonable doubt.” Saxton v. State, 804 S.W.2d\n\n910, 914 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991) (emphasis added).\n\n      In a claim of self-defense, “a defendant bears the burden of production,” while\n\n“the State then bears the burden of persuasion to disprove the raised defense.”\n\n\n                                         19\n\fZuliani v. State, 97 S.W.3d 589, 594 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003) (citing Saxton, 804\n\nS.W.2d at 913–14). The defendant’s burden of production requires the defendant to\n\nadduce some evidence that would support a rational jury finding as to the defense.\n\nSee TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. § 2.03(c) (West 2011) (“The issue of the existence of a\n\ndefense is not submitted to the jury unless evidence is admitted supporting the\n\ndefense.”); Krajcovic v. State, 393 S.W.3d 282, 286 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013); Shaw\n\nv. State, 243 S.W.3d 647, 657–58 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). “[E]ven a minimum\n\nquantity of evidence is sufficient to raise a defense as long as the evidence would\n\nsupport a rational jury finding as to the defense.” Krajcovic, 393 S.W.3d at 286\n\n(citing Shaw, 243 S.W.3d at 657–58). “[A] defense is supported (or ‘raised’) if there\n\nis evidence in the record making a prima facie case for the defense.” Shaw, 243\n\nS.W.3d at 657. “A prima facie case is that ‘minimum quantum of evidence necessary\n\nto support a rational inference that [an] allegation of fact is true.’” Id. (quoting\n\nTompkins v. State, 774 S.W.2d 195, 201 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987)).\n\n      If the defendant meets his burden of production, the burden of persuasion\n\nshifts back to the State. Zuliani, 97 S.W.3d at 594. The State’s “burden of\n\npersuasion is not one that requires the production of evidence, rather it requires only\n\nthat the State prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id. (citing Saxton, 804\n\nS.W.2d at 913). In order to prove the offense beyond a reasonable doubt, it must\n\nlikewise disprove the defense of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. Saxton,\n\n\n                                          20\n\f804 S.W.2d at 914. Thus, if appellant produced at least some evidence that would\n\nsupport a rational jury’s finding that he hit Jimenez in defense to her use of force\n\nagainst him, the State would have to disprove his defense of self-defense beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt to prove the family violence charge against him beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\n\n      With appellant’s defense in mind—that he slapped Jimenez in self-defense\n\nonly after she karate-kicked him first—we turn to the effect of Gonzales’s testimony\n\nagainst appellant. Appellant argues that his questioning could have shown that\n\nGonzales was biased against him because of her interest as a potential managing\n\nconservator of his child and that, therefore, the trial court erred in not allowing him\n\nto question her as to ongoing parental rights termination proceedings against himself\n\nand Jimenez.\n\nC.    Relationship Between Family Violence Conviction and Child Custody\n      Proceedings\n\n      Termination and custody proceedings always entail the determination of\n\ncustody based on the conduct of the parents and the best interests of the child. The\n\ncommission of family violence is a mandatory consideration in determining the\n\ncustody of a child in both custody and termination proceedings. Texas Family Code\n\nsection 153.004(c) requires that, in custody proceedings, the family court shall\n\nconsider the commission of family violence in determining whether to deny, restrict,\n\nor limit possession of a child by a parent. TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. § 153.004(c) (West\n                                          21\n\f2014). In a case to terminate parental rights brought by the Department of Family\n\nand Protective Services (“DFPS”) under Family Code section 161.001, DFPS must\n\nestablish, by clear and convincing evidence, that (1) the parent committed one or\n\nmore of the enumerated acts or omissions justifying termination and (2) termination\n\nis in the best interest of the child. Id. § 161.001(b) (West Supp. 2016); In re C.H.,\n\n89 S.W.3d 17, 23 (Tex. 2002).\n\n      There is a strong presumption that the best interest of the child will be served\n\nby preserving the parent-child relationship. See In re R.R., 209 S.W.3d 112, 116\n\n(Tex. 2006) (per curiam). However, prompt and permanent placement of the child\n\nin a safe environment is also presumed to be in the child’s best interest. TEX. FAM.\n\nCODE ANN. § 263.307(a) (West Supp. 2016).\n\n      A grandparent can have an interest in a child custody determination—whether\n\nin connection with termination proceedings or not—if the grandparent requests\n\npossession of a child by filing an original suit or a suit for modification. Id.\n\n§ 153.432(a) (West 2014); see In re Chambless, 257 S.W.3d 698, 699–700 (Tex.\n\n2008) (per curiam).      However, Family Code section 153.131(a) creates a\n\npresumption in favor of a parent when a non-parent (such as DFPS or a grandparent\n\nor other relative) is seeking custody of a child.3 TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. § 153.131(a)\n\n\n\n3\n      Section 153.131(a) provides:\n\n                                         22\n\f(West 2014). The parental presumption set out in Family Code section 153.131(a)\n\nis expressly made subject to section 153.004 of the Code. Section 153.004(b)\n\nprovides “a rebuttable presumption that the appointment of a parent as the sole\n\nmanaging conservator of a child or as the conservator who has the exclusive right to\n\ndetermine the primary residence of a child is not in the best interest of the child if\n\ncredible   evidence     is   presented    of        a   history   or   pattern   of   past   or\n\npresent . . . physical . . . abuse by that parent directed against the other parent . . . .”\n\nId. § 153.004(b). And, as stated above, section 153.004(c) requires that, in custody\n\nproceedings, the family court “shall consider the commission of family violence in\n\ndetermining whether to deny, restrict, or limit possession of a child by a parent . . . .”\n\nId. § 153.004(c) (emphasis added).\n\nD.     Confrontation Clause Analysis\n\n       Appellant was charged with assault on a family member, Jimenez—an act of\n\nfamily violence. The elements of assault on a family member, as relevant here, are\n\n(1) intentionally (2) causing bodily injury (3) to another person (4) who is a member\n\n\n\n       Subject to the prohibition in Section 153.004, unless the court finds that\n       appointment of the parent or parents would not be in the best interest of the\n       child because the appointment would significantly impair the child’s physical\n       health or emotional development, a parent shall be appointed sole managing\n       conservator or both parents shall be appointed as joint managing\n       conservators of the child.\n\nTEX. FAM. CODE ANN. § 153.131(a) (West 2014).\n\n                                               23\n\fof the defendant’s family or a person with whom the defendant has a “dating\n\nrelationship.” TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. § 22.01(a) (West Supp. 2016) (defining\n\nassault).   Under the Penal Code, the offense is enhanced from a Class A\n\nmisdemeanor to a third-degree felony if the assault is against a family member or\n\ninvolves “dating violence” and the defendant has certain prior convictions, including\n\na prior conviction for assault on a family member. Id. § 22.01(b)(2)(A); TEX. FAM.\n\nCODE ANN. § 71.0021 (West Supp. 2016) (defining “dating violence” and “dating\n\nrelationship”); id. § 71.003 (West 2014) (defining “family”). The punishment for\n\nconviction of a third-degree felony—such as assault on a family member, second\n\noffender—when the defendant has two prior felony convictions is confinement for\n\ntwenty-five years to life. See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. § 12.42(d) (West Supp. 2016).\n\n      Because he had a prior conviction for assault on a family member as well as\n\ntwo prior felony convictions, appellant faced a sentence of twenty-five years to life\n\nupon conviction in this case for family violence. His defense at trial was that\n\nJimenez “karate kick[ed]” his phone out of his hand when he would not respond to\n\nher and that he struck her in self-defense. The only witnesses to the offense with\n\nwhich appellant was charged who testified at trial were appellant and Gonzales.\n\nJimenez, the complainant, did not testify.\n\n      At the time of trial, Jimenez and appellant were involved in ongoing child\n\ncustody proceedings to determine whether their parental rights to their one-year-old\n\n\n                                         24\n\fdaughter should be terminated. Although there is a strong presumption that the best\n\ninterest of the child is served by preserving the parent-child relationship, under the\n\nplain language of Family Code sections 153.131(a) and 153.004(b) and (c), the\n\nparental presumption is removed by a showing that the parent seeking to be\n\nappointed managing conservator has a history or pattern of past or present physical\n\nabuse directed against the other parent. See TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. §§ 153.004(b),\n\n153.131(a). Therefore, appellant’s conviction for family-violence assault, combined\n\nwith his past family-violence assault conviction, is exactly the type of evidence\n\nrequired to justify both the termination of his parental rights and the appointment of\n\nJimenez as sole managing conservator or, if Jimenez were likewise to have her rights\n\nterminated or to be shown to have a history of family violence, the parental\n\npresumption would be removed for both parents, and the appointment of a non-\n\nparent, like Gonzales, as sole managing conservator could be pursued. Thus,\n\nappellant had a “vulnerable status” with respect to testimony that he committed\n\nfamily violence. See Davis, 415 U.S. at 317–18, 94 S. Ct. at 1111; Carroll, 916\n\nS.W.2d at 500.\n\n      In this criminal case, it was the jury’s responsibility to determine beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt whether appellant committed an act of domestic violence against\n\nJimenez—hitting her in the face—without justification or whether appellant raised\n\na reasonable doubt as to whether his striking Jimenez was justified because Jimenez\n\n\n                                         25\n\fused unjustified force first against him by striking or “karate kicking” the phone\n\nfrom his hand. Only by making that determination could the jury determine whether\n\nappellant had the requisite intent to use unlawful force against Jimenez beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt and should be convicted of domestic violence or whether appellant\n\nhad raised a reasonable doubt as to his intent and should be acquitted. And on this\n\noutcome-determinative issue, the weight and credibility of Gonzales’s testimony\n\nwas critical.\n\n      The controlling question on appeal is whether, had appellant been able to\n\ncross-examine Gonzales on the termination proceedings and her interest in them, he\n\ncould have made the jury aware of a bias or interest on her part that would have\n\nmotivated her to testify against him on the underlying offense of domestic violence\n\nagainst Jimenez because of her interest in obtaining custody of his child or\n\npreventing appellant from maintaining custody of the child. Such a consideration\n\ndirectly impacts the weight to be given a witness’s testimony by the jury. See Davis,\n\n415 U.S. at 317, 94 S. Ct. at 1111.        Thus, appellant’s cross-examination of\n\nGonzales’s interest in the outcome of the parental rights termination proceeding had\n\nthe potential to raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of the jury as to whether\n\nappellant assaulted Jimenez without justification, committing an act of domestic\n\nviolence that could—and did—send him to prison for twenty-five years to life, or\n\nwhether he acted with justification in response to Jimenez’s initial, unjustified, and\n\n\n                                         26\n\funlawful act of force and therefore should have been acquitted on the basis of his\n\ndefense. See Zuliani, 97 S.W.3d at 594; Saxton, 804 S.W.2d at 913–14.\n\n      We conclude that this is a classic Confrontation Clause case. Here, the\n\nconverse of Davis is at issue: appellant, the defendant—as opposed to the witness\n\nagainst him, Gonzales—was in a particularly vulnerable status as a defendant in a\n\ndomestic dispute in which a conviction carried a twenty-five-year to life sentence\n\nand was also mandatory evidence in determining his parental and custody rights.\n\nSee TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. §§ 153.004, 153.131. Thus, he was extremely vulnerable\n\nto losing custody of his child should he be convicted of assaulting Jimenez without\n\njustification. The principal witness against him—indeed the only eyewitness who\n\ntestified at trial besides himself—was Gonzales, the grandmother of the child. Her\n\ntestimony on direct examination showed a deep possessory interest in the child, and\n\nshe could not be excluded on the basis of anything in the record of this case as a\n\npossible managing conservator should appellant and Jimenez lose their parental\n\nrights, or should appellant lose his. Thus, cross-examination and impeachment of\n\nGonzales directed toward revealing her “possible bias, prejudice or ulterior\n\nmotives . . . as they [might] relate directly to issues or personalities in the case” was\n\nnot only relevant but “‘always relevant as discrediting the witness and affecting the\n\nweight of [the] testimony.’” Davis, 415 U.S. at 316, 94 S. Ct. at 1110; Johnson, 433\n\nS.W.3d at 551.\n\n\n                                           27\n\f      Under Davis, “the jurors were entitled to have the benefit of the defense theory\n\nbefore them so that they could make an informed judgment as to the weight to place\n\non [the witness’s] testimony which provided ‘a crucial link in the proof . . . of [the\n\ndefendant’s] act” of domestic violence against Jimenez. 415 U.S. at 317, 94 S. Ct.\n\nat 1111. Appellant argued that he struck Jimenez in self-defense. The only other\n\neyewitness to the incident was Gonzales.        The State asked Gonzales whether\n\nJimenez made any physical contact with appellant before he struck her. Gonzales\n\ntestified, “She was trying to get his attention. He had a cell phone in his hand. She\n\nwhacked the phone in his hand.” Gonzales did not see what happened to the phone.\n\nShe also testified that she did not see whether Jimenez kicked appellant, stating, “I\n\nwas standing in the middle of them by that time and there was a car there.” Appellant\n\ntestified it was unlikely that Gonzales even saw clearly what happened between him\n\nand [Jimenez] because “like the tight area we [were] in, . . . [Jimenez’s] back is\n\ntowards the window of the kitchen by the door” and Gonzales came into the garage\n\nat approximately the moment the confrontation occurred.\n\n      Gonzales did not testify to anything else about the confrontation between\n\nJimenez and appellant with which appellant was charged. Instead, she testified\n\ngraphically and at length about her fears for her granddaughter’s safety in appellant’s\n\npresence and the danger she believed he presented to the child she was protecting\n\nfrom him. None of this testimony was relevant to the charged offense, but it was\n\n\n                                          28\n\fhighly prejudicial to appellant, both in his trial for striking and injuring Jimenez\n\nwithout justification and with respect to his ability to retain his parental rights to the\n\nchild, both because appellant faced a minimum twenty-five year sentence for striking\n\nJimenez without justification and because domestic violence is a mandatory\n\nconsideration in the termination and custody proceedings that were then ongoing—\n\nproceedings in which the elimination of the parental presumption in favor of\n\nappellant would allow Gonzales to seek custody of the child.\n\n      It is hard to imagine a more clear-cut case in which a criminal defendant\n\nshould have been permitted to confront the sole eyewitness against him to allow the\n\njury to assess her credibility and to allow facts to be brought out regarding her\n\ninterest in the child that might tend to discredit her by showing that her relevant\n\ntestimony with respect to the charged offense was untrue or biased. See Carroll,\n\n916 S.W.2d at 497; see also Davis, 415 U.S. at 316, 94 S. Ct. at 1110 (stating that\n\npartiality of witness is subject to exploration and is always relevant to discrediting\n\nwitness and affecting weight of testimony, and stating that exposing witness’s\n\nmotivation in testifying is proper function of protected right of cross-examination).\n\n      As appellant points out, an interest in the outcome of a child custody\n\ndetermination has twice been held by the intermediate appellate courts of this state\n\nto be a valid area for exposing bias through cross-examination in circumstances that\n\n\n\n\n                                           29\n\fdid not involve termination proceedings or the potential of a long prison sentence\n\nfor the party seeking cross-examination.\n\n      In Fox v. State, the Fourteenth Court of Appeals held that Rule of Evidence\n\n608, prohibiting cross-examination on a witness’s general character for truthfulness,\n\ndid not preclude cross-examination of a mother as to whether she attempted to\n\nimplant the suggestion of the father’s sexual abuse of the children where, if the father\n\nwere in jail or even accused of sexual abuse of a child, the mother would stand a far\n\nbetter chance of obtaining custody of all of the children in a separate divorce\n\nproceeding. 115 S.W.3d 550, 567–68 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, pet.\n\nref’d). The court of appeals held that there was no legitimate reason for the trial\n\ncourt to limit the cross-examination because the subject of motivation and bias was\n\nnot exhausted; the cross-examination was not designed to annoy, harass, or\n\nhumiliate, but rather to show motive and bias; and the cross-examination did not\n\nendanger the witness. Id. at 567. Because the requested cross-examination was\n\nproper under the rules of evidence and required by the Confrontation Clause of the\n\nUnited States Constitution, the trial court abused its discretion in limiting the cross-\n\nexamination. Id. at 568.\n\n      Ryan v. State, an unpublished decision, is also illustrative. See No. 04-08-\n\n00594-CR, 2009 WL 2045211 (Tex. App.—San Antonio July 15, 2009, no pet.) (not\n\ndesignated for publication). In that case, the court of appeals held that the trial court\n\n\n                                           30\n\fabused its discretion by limiting cross-examination of Ryan’s ex-wife about custody\n\nof their oldest child. Id. at *3–4. The ex-wife testified that when she and Ryan had\n\npreviously separated, the family court had awarded Ryan custody of the oldest child.\n\nId. at *4. Ryan testified that, after he was arrested for assaulting his ex-wife in the\n\nunderlying offense, she took both children, moved out of the residence, and did not\n\nreturn the oldest child to him. Id. The court did not permit Ryan to question his ex-\n\nwife about any subsequent custody disputes between them or the effect of any such\n\ndisputes on her testimony. Id.\n\n      The court of appeals observed that the commission of family violence is a\n\nmandatory factor to be considered in determining custody of children. Id. at *4\n\n(citing TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. § 153.004(c) (“The court shall consider the\n\ncommission of family violence in determining whether to deny, restrict, or limit the\n\npossession of a child by a parent who is appointed as a possessory conservator.”))\n\n(emphasis added). Accordingly, the court held that questions regarding custody\n\nproceedings were relevant to the ex-wife’s “motivation to exaggerate her testimony\n\nat trial.” Id. Because the ex-wife’s possible bias and motive as a result of the\n\nongoing custody dispute were not made clear to the jury through thorough and\n\neffective cross-examination, the trial court abused its discretion by limiting defense\n\ncounsel’s cross examination. Id. at *5.\n\n\n\n\n                                          31\n\f      Both Ryan and Fox are directly on point and persuasive authority. Gonzales\n\ntestified against appellant extensively on direct examination. First, she briefly\n\ntestified about the incident with which appellant was charged, indicating that\n\nJimenez tried to get appellant’s attention by “whack[ing] the phone in his hand.”\n\nShe then testified extensively and emotionally concerning appellant’s violence\n\ntowards his and Jimenez’s child as Gonzales tried to get him to leave the house after\n\nJimenez had already left. Yet appellant was expressly prohibited from asking\n\nGonzales whether she knew there was an ongoing child custody dispute to terminate\n\nthe parental rights of both Jimenez and appellant and whether Gonzales had an\n\ninterest in those proceedings. He was also prohibited from asking her whether she\n\nactually or potentially stood to obtain custody of the child in the accompanying\n\ncustody proceedings.\n\n      Without cross-examination, the jury in this case was deprived of facts\n\nnecessary to determine Gonzales’s credibility and thus to make an informed\n\njudgment as to her motivation and the weight to be placed on her testimony, which\n\nwas crucial to the proof of appellant’s intent to strike and injure Jimenez without\n\njustification and therefore with criminal intent. See Davis, 415 U.S. at 317, 94 S.\n\nCt. at 1111; Douglas, 390 U.S. at 419, 85 S. Ct. at 1077. Thus, Gonzales’s testimony\n\nabout appellant’s family violence was critical to his conviction. Moreover, had the\n\njury agreed that appellant raised a reasonable doubt as to his defense of self-defense,\n\n\n                                          32\n\fit could not have convicted him of domestic violence beyond a reasonable doubt—\n\na mandatory consideration in determining whether he would lose custody of the child\n\nto Jimenez, Gonzales herself, or another in the then-ongoing parental rights\n\ntermination proceedings.      See TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. §§ 153.004, 153.131.\n\nTherefore, there was a direct and crucial link between the weight placed by the jury\n\non Gonzales’s testimony in appellant’s trial for domestic violence and her own\n\npossible bias or interest in the parental rights termination proceedings and ultimate\n\npossession of the child. See, e.g., Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 678–79, 106 S. Ct. at\n\n1435 (“[E]xposure of a witness’ motivation in testifying is a proper and important\n\nfunction of the constitutionally protected right of cross-examination.”); Billodeau,\n\n277 S.W.3d at 42–43 (“The possible animus, motive, or ill will of a prosecution\n\nwitness who testifies against the defendant is never a collateral or irrelevant inquiry,\n\nand the defendant is entitled, subject to reasonable restrictions, to show any relevant\n\nfact that might tend to establish ill feeling, bias, motive, interest, or animus on the\n\npart of any witness testifying against him”); Carpenter, 979 S.W.2d at 634\n\n(“Exposing a witness’ motivation to testify for or against the accused or the State is\n\na proper and important purpose of cross-examination.”); Lewis, 815 S.W.2d at 565\n\n(defendant is entitled to pursue all avenues of cross-examination reasonably\n\ncalculated to expose motive, bias, or interest for witness’s testimony).\n\n\n\n\n                                          33\n\f      We hold that the trial court abused its discretion by denying appellant his\n\nconstitutional right under the Confrontation Clause to question Gonzales about her\n\ninterest in the outcome of ongoing parental rights termination proceedings against\n\nhim and Jimenez and therefore her possible bias in testifying against him. We now\n\ndetermine whether the error was harmful.\n\nE.    Harm Analysis\n\n      Constitutional error in a criminal case is subject to harmless error review.\n\nTEX. R. APP. P. 44.2. In such a case, the court of appeals must reverse a judgment\n\nof conviction unless the court determines beyond a reasonable doubt that the error\n\ndid not contribute to the conviction or punishment. Id. This rule is based on the\n\nparallel federal rule of criminal procedure; and, therefore, decisions of the United\n\nStates Supreme Court may be looked to for guidance in interpreting the state rule.\n\nJohnson v. State, 43 S.W.3d 1, 4 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001). Accordingly, the Court\n\nof Criminal Appeals has adopted the Supreme Court’s conclusion that it is the\n\nresponsibility of the appellate court to assess harm after reviewing the record. Id.\n\n(quoting O’Neal v. McAninch, 513 U.S. 432, 436–37, 115 S. Ct. 992, 994–95\n\n(1995)).\n\n      In Van Arsdall, the United States Supreme Court applied the harmless error\n\nstandard set out in Chapman v. California. See 475 U.S. at 680–81, 106 S. Ct. at\n\n1436 (citing Chapman, 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S. Ct. 824, 828 (1967)). Under this\n\n\n                                        34\n\fstandard, the reviewing court must inquire whether, assuming the damaging\n\npotential of the cross-examination were fully realized, a reviewing court might\n\nnonetheless say the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. at 684, 106\n\nS. Ct. at 1438. The reviewing court looks at “the importance of the witness’\n\ntestimony in the prosecution’s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the\n\npresence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the\n\nwitness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and,\n\nof course, the overall strength of the prosecution’s case.” Id.\n\n        Here, Gonzales was the State’s principal witness against appellant, since\n\nJimenez did not testify, and there were discrepancies between Gonzales’s testimony\n\nand that of both appellant and Officer Portillo, who responded to Gonzales’s 9-1-1\n\ncall.   Her testimony contradicted appellant’s description of the confrontation\n\nbetween himself and Jimenez. Having first testified that Jimenez “whacked” the\n\nphone in appellant’s hand to get his attention, Gonzales subsequently testified that\n\nJimenez merely “slapped the phone” in appellant’s hand and that appellant then hit\n\nJimenez in the face, knocking her back and causing her mouth to start bleeding\n\nimmediately. Appellant, by contrast, testified that he “slapped” Jimenez in self-\n\ndefense when Jimenez “karate kick[ed the] phone out of [his] hand,” striking his\n\nhand and causing the phone to hit the car. Gonzales admitted she did not see what\n\nhappened to the phone. According to Gonzales, Jimenez’s mouth swelled into “a\n\n\n                                          35\n\fbig ball on her lip.” Officer Portillo testified that Jimenez “had redness to the face”\n\nand a cut on her upper lip and that her eyes were watering. Gonzales also testified\n\nthat appellant “kicked her car doors in” and “ransacked” the house. Appellant\n\ntestified that he went into the house to get his identification and wallet when\n\nGonzales ordered him to leave. Officer Portillo saw no evidence of ransacking or of\n\ndamage to any property in the garage. Gonzales testified extensively, without\n\nrebuttal, to appellant’s treatment of the child and of herself after Jimenez had left the\n\nscene in response to Gonzales’s order and before appellant likewise left at\n\nGonzales’s command.\n\n      Jimenez did not testify. Therefore, the only direct witness to the confrontation\n\nbetween Jimenez and himself, besides appellant, was Gonzales. Appellant contends\n\nthat because he could not cross-examine Gonzales for bias or interest, the jury heard\n\nonly her testimony that Jimenez merely slapped the phone out of his hand “to get his\n\nattention” and his testimony, which, he contends, it could have discounted as self-\n\nserving.\n\n      Considering the Chapman and Van Arsdall standard for harmless error in\n\ndenial of cross-examination under these circumstances, Gonzales’ testimony was of\n\ngreat importance to the prosecution’s case against appellant for domestic violence,\n\nand her testimony was not cumulative, as no other eyewitness present at the time of\n\nthe offense testified about the confrontation between appellant and Jimenez other\n\n\n                                           36\n\fthan appellant himself, as Jimenez did not testify. See Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 684,\n\n106 S. Ct. at 1438.\n\n        Most importantly, appellant’s inability to confront Gonzales for bias or\n\ninterest greatly affected the overall strength of the prosecution’s case and of\n\nappellant’s defense of self-defense. See Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 684, 106 S. Ct. at\n\n1438.     Appellant was charged with assault on a family member, i.e., with\n\n(1) intentionally (2) causing bodily injury (3) to another person (4) who is a member\n\nof the defendant’s family or a person with whom the defendant has a “dating\n\nrelationship.” TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. § 22.01(a). Both appellant and Gonzales\n\ntestified that Jimenez struck appellant’s phone first. But Gonzales’s testimony\n\nswiftly veered to the subsequent confrontation between her and appellant over the\n\nchild and Gonzales’s command that appellant leave the house. Thus, without\n\nevidence of Gonzales’s interest in the child, there was nothing to support appellant’s\n\nclaim of self-defense in his confrontation with Jimenez other than his own testimony,\n\ntestimony that was overwhelmed by Gonzales’s testimony about her interest in\n\nprotecting the child from appellant.\n\n        Had the jury been in possession of the facts into which appellant was\n\nforbidden to inquire on cross-examination of Gonzales, it could have made an\n\ninformed judgment as to the weight to place on her testimony regarding the charged\n\ndomestic violence offense—testimony which provided a crucial link to the proof of\n\n\n                                         37\n\fboth appellant’s act against Jimenez and his defense of self-defense. Accordingly,\n\nwe hold that the trial court’s error in denying appellant the right to cross-examine\n\nGonzales about her interest in the termination of parental rights proceedings and the\n\nattendant custody dispute was harmful to appellant’s case. See Van Arsdall, 475\n\nU.S. at 684, 106 S. Ct. at 1438; see also TEX. R. APP. P. 44.2(a) (stating that, in cases\n\ninvolving constitutional error, appellate court must reverse judgment of conviction\n\nunless court determines beyond a reasonable doubt that error did not contribute to\n\nconviction).\n\n      We sustain appellant’s first issue.4\n\n                                         Conclusion\n\n      We reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand this case for a new trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                                Evelyn V.

PENAL CODE ANN. § 22.01(b)(2) (West Supp. 2016).\n\ftrue to the allegations in two enhancement paragraphs, the trial court assessed his\n\npunishment at twenty-five years’ confinement. In two issues, appellant contends\n\nthat (1) the trial court erroneously limited his cross-examination of a witness by\n\nrefusing to allow him to cross-examine the witness about her interest in ongoing\n\nchild-custody proceedings involving appellant’s and the complainant’s daughter,\n\nand (2) the trial court erroneously excluded evidence concerning the complainant’s\n\nviolent character.\n\n      We reverse and remand.\n\n                                      Background\n\nA.    Factual Background\n\n      On December 17, 2014, appellant was living in a house with his girlfriend,\n\nthe complainant Amy Jimenez, their one-year-old daughter, and Jimenez’s mother,\n\nAdeline Gonzales. All four of them started watching a movie in the living room of\n\nthe house. Appellant made inappropriate comments about a scene in the movie, and\n\nJimenez told him to stop because Gonzales was in the room. Gonzales testified that\n\n“there was a lot of frustration in the room.” She left the room with the baby, and\n\nappellant went into the garage. Gonzales later returned to the living room and told\n\nJimenez that the baby needed some items from the store for school. Appellant’s and\n\nGonzales’s accounts of what happened after this point differ dramatically.\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\f      According to appellant, after he left the living room, he stayed in the garage\n\nfor about an hour and a half playing a game on his cell phone. Jimenez “came in the\n\ngarage a few times” and talked to him. Defense counsel asked whether there was a\n\nfight every time Jimenez came into the garage, and appellant replied that there was\n\nno fight, but “she was trying to pick a fight[.]”\n\n      Appellant was sitting between two cars playing on his phone, basically\n\nignoring Jimenez. She then got “in [his] face” and “karate kick[ed the] phone out of\n\n[his] hand.” When asked by his counsel whether Jimenez slapped the phone down\n\nor kicked it, appellant replied, “She did a pretty good karate kick.” He stated that\n\nthe phone “hit the car, fell on the floor. I’m in a tight little space. She kind of hit\n\nmy hand pretty hard.” Appellant then slapped Jimenez. When asked whether\n\nGonzales saw the confrontation, appellant replied, “I doubt it” because of the tight\n\narea and because Jimenez’s back was “towards the window of the kitchen by the\n\ndoor” to the garage.\n\n      According to Gonzales, however, Jimenez went out to the garage, and she and\n\nappellant started arguing. Jimenez wanted the keys to the car to go to the store, and\n\nappellant would not answer her. Gonzales testified that she had the baby in her arms,\n\nand she opened the garage door to give Jimenez some money. She saw appellant\n\ntake “a swing at [Jimenez] and he hit her in the face.” The prosecutor then asked\n\nher, “Now prior to you seeing that, did you see [Jimenez] make any contact, physical\n\n\n                                           3\n\fcontact with the defendant?” Gonzales replied, “She was trying to get his attention.\n\nHe had a cell phone in his hand. She whacked the phone in his hand.”\n\n      Gonzales did not know what happened to the phone, but, in response to the\n\nprosecutor’s statement, “So you’re saying you saw [Jimenez] make contact with his\n\nphone,” she replied, “Right, trying to get his attention.”        In response to the\n\nprosecutor’s question, “What did that sound like when he struck your daughter?”\n\nGonzales testified, “I mean, it was pretty hard because her whole face went back. I\n\nlooked back at her. I saw blood coming out of her face,” out of “[h]er lip, right here,\n\nmouth.” Gonzales then started screaming to appellant, “I told you not to put your\n\nhands on her anymore.” She stated, “I had the baby in my arms and I told [Jimenez],\n\nI said, Get out, get in your car, go your dad’s house.” Jimenez looked “pretty scared.\n\nShe had a look on her face I had never seen before and I’m a mother. I felt what I\n\nwas looking at and I said, Get out of here, get in your car and go. And I’ll call you\n\nwhen you can come back.” Gonzales then called 9-1-1. She testified that she did\n\nnot see Jimenez kick appellant “at any point,” explaining, “I was standing in the\n\nmiddle of them by that time and there was a car there.”\n\n      Appellant did not immediately leave after the altercation with Jimenez. He\n\ndemanded to kiss and hug his daughter. He testified, “[Gonzales] is real possessive\n\nof my daughter. She wouldn’t let me get my daughter. So I stayed around longer.\n\n[Gonzales was] yelling at me. And I’m yelling at her, just trying to see my daughter\n\n\n                                          4\n\freal quick before I left.” No other blows were thrown. Appellant testified that he\n\nwent back into the house to get his wallet and identification, and when he discovered\n\nthat Gonzales had called 9-1-1, he jumped the fence and went to the park. Appellant\n\ncame back to the house after the police arrived, and he was arrested.\n\n      Jimenez had left the scene in response to Gonzales’s order before any of this\n\nhappened. Gonzales testified extensively, however, as to appellant’s behavior after\n\nJimenez left. According to her testimony, appellant ransacked the interior of the\n\nhouse and came back into the garage, “[s]creaming obscenities, calling me\n\neverything in the book and ransacking what he could. I had [the baby] in my arms.\n\nI was more afraid of that than anything else.” She stated, “I was afraid to go back in\n\nthe house.” Appellant came back into the garage, and the baby was “crying, crying,”\n\nand Gonzales was trying to calm her down. Appellant picked up a jack that was in\n\nthe garage and started swinging it just a couple of feet from Gonzales while\n\nscreaming obscenities at her, including “Get your own F’ing baby. This is my F’ing\n\nbaby. You rotten F’ing B. It was going on and on.” She stated that appellant also\n\nkicked the doors to her car. She kept screaming, “Get out of here, get out of here,\n\nget of here,” and appellant said in response, “I’m going to get out of here when I kiss\n\nmy baby.”\n\n      According to Gonzales, appellant grabbed the baby, saying “I just want to hug\n\nmy baby,” while Gonzales still held the baby in her arms. Gonzales “kept telling\n\n\n                                          5\n\f[appellant] to leave [the baby] alone because she started crying. And he grabbed her\n\nlittle leg and he started doing this to her little body. And it scared me, because I said,\n\nMy God, he could have ripped her spinal cord. I let her go.” Appellant stepped\n\naway “because he was leaving with [the baby],” holding her “like a rag doll under\n\nhis arm. And she was crying and crying. He’s screaming.” Gonzales testified that\n\nthe baby\n\n      was pushing and pushing and she was screaming this loud cry like I\n      never heard it before. [Appellant] finally puts her down because she’s\n      wiggling to get away from him. He puts her down and he kind of\n      nudges her and I ran toward her and I grabbed her. I had her in my\n      arms. I wouldn’t let her go. He was still screaming at me, I’m going to\n      get her. I’m going to get her. At that point I was going to do whatever\n      I needed to do because I wasn’t going to let her go.\n\nWhen the police arrived, appellant went back inside the house and escaped out the\n\nback door over the fence.\n\n      Gonzales testified that Jimenez drove up a few minutes later, and “[s]he was\n\nmad, telling me, Mom, why did you call the police?              Why did you call the\n\npolice. . . . She’s upset and she’s screaming. I’m trying to regroup to what’s just\n\nhappening. The baby’s still crying and it’s a whole lot of commotion going on at\n\nthe same time.” Jimenez “had a big ball in her lip. . . . You could see a little dried\n\nblood on her face. She had a big ball on her lip here.” Both Gonzales and Jimenez\n\nwere interviewed by the police.\n\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\f      When asked whether he told his side of the story to the police, appellant\n\ntestified, “I didn’t feel like my story means anything. Two angry women.” He also\n\ntestified that Jimenez did not file charges against him, she failed to receive a letter\n\nof non-prosecution to sign that he had sent to her, and she came to visit him every\n\nday he was in jail prior to trial. Appellant testified that Jimenez and Gonzales had a\n\nvolatile relationship, but the court sustained as irrelevant the State’s objection to the\n\nquestion of whether appellant had ever seen Jimenez strike her mother. Appellant\n\nfinally testified that the other cases he had had involving family violence also had to\n\ndo with knocking a phone out of someone’s hand; he was charged and pled guilty in\n\norder “[t]o come home and take care of my child.”\n\n      Houston Police Department Officer J. Portillo responded to Gonzales’s 9-1-1\n\ncall. As he approached the house, he saw Gonzales and Jimenez walk into the\n\ngarage. Both of them “seemed pretty upset and emotional.” Officer Portillo\n\nobserved redness on Jimenez’s face and a cut on her upper lip. Although Jimenez\n\nultimately spoke with Officer Portillo, she initially did not want to speak to police.\n\nOfficer Portillo did not see any damage to property in the garage, and the inside of\n\nthe house did not appear to have been ransacked, as Gonzales had testified.\n\n\n\n\n                                           7\n\fB.    Procedural Background\n\n      After voir dire but before the jury was sworn in, defense counsel sought\n\npermission to introduce evidence of an ongoing Child Protective Services (“CPS”)\n\nproceeding to terminate the parental rights of both appellant and Jimenez to their\n\ndaughter. Counsel argued:\n\n      [Defense Counsel]:         The third and last point, Judge, it is my\n                                 understanding that CPS is involved and the\n                                 welfare of the [child] in whether or not\n                                 parental rights were taken from the\n                                 complaining witness, [Jimenez], and the\n                                 defendant, and that one of the persons who\n                                 may be—I don’t know how to put this\n                                 gently—would get the grandchild would be\n                                 the mother. Again, it would go to motive as\n                                 to why—if she sat up there and saw, based on\n                                 the police report, if she saw mutual\n                                 conduct—\n\n      The Court:                 So you want to ask Adeline Gonzales\n                                 whether there’s a CPS investigation and\n                                 whether she gets the children if that CPS\n                                 issue was sustained?\n\n      [Defense Counsel]:         Yes.\n\nThe trial court ruled that this evidence was not relevant. Defense counsel also sought\n\npermission to question Gonzales about Jimenez’s reputation in the community for\n\nviolence and, specifically, whether Jimenez had ever been violent towards Gonzales.\n\nThe trial court ruled that this evidence was not relevant and was inadmissible under\n\nRule of Evidence 608.\n\n\n                                          8\n\f      Later in the trial, after Gonzales had testified before the jury, defense counsel\n\nmade an offer of proof concerning testimony from Gonzales that the trial court had\n\nexcluded. Gonzales testified that Jimenez had threatened her on a few occasions in\n\nthe past. She also testified that Jimenez had hit her on several occasions and that\n\nJimenez had been the initial aggressor. With respect to the termination proceedings,\n\ndefense counsel and Gonzales had the following exchange:\n\n      Q.    Do you know that there’s a CPS—that there’s a child custody\n            battle going on to eliminate parental rights of both Amy and\n            Dedric?\n      A.    Yes, sir.\n      Q.    Do you have an interest in that being done?\n      A.    I don’t understand what that means.\n      Q.    Do you have a preference?\n      A.    Do I have a preference of what?\n      Q.    That their parental rights be terminated or not?\n      A.    I don’t have any say in that. That damage has been done between\n            the both of them.\n      Q.    My understanding is the child is with an aunt; is that correct?\n      A.    My sister.\n      Q.    Your sister?\n      A.    Yes. And before that, she was with me. I had her. I’ve always\n            had her.\n      Q.    The reason that you take care of the child is because of the\n            relationship that Dedric and Amy have, correct?\n      A.    I’m sorry?\n\n\n                                          9\n\f      Q.     It’s because of the type of relationship that Amy and Dedric have\n             and the things that they do destructive towards each other,\n             correct?\n      A.     I’m not sure I want to answer that.\n      Q.     The reason—\n      A.     Yes, that’s why I take care of her because I want her to be safe.\n             She’s a beautiful little girl. She deserves to be safe. (Witness\n             crying.)\n      Q.     In this particular case, it is your testimony that Amy hit Dedric\n             first, correct?\n      A.     She slapped the phone in his hands.\n\n      The jury ultimately found appellant guilty of the offense of assault on a family\n\nmember.    After appellant pleaded true to the allegations in two enhancement\n\nparagraphs, the trial court assessed his punishment at twenty-five years’\n\nconfinement. This appeal followed.\n\n                                  Preservation of Error\n\n      We first consider whether appellant preserved his complaint about his cross-\n\nexamination of Gonzales for appellate review.\n\n      The dissenting opinion argues that appellant failed to preserve his complaint\n\nfor appellate review because his offer of proof about Gonzales’s testimony regarding\n\nCPS termination proceedings was insufficient to establish Gonzales’s alleged bias\n\nagainst appellant. A party may complain on appeal about a ruling excluding\n\nevidence if the error “affects a substantial right of the party” and the party “informs\n\nthe court of [the evidence’s] substance by an offer of proof, unless the substance was\n\n                                          10\n\fapparent from the context.” TEX. R. EVID. 103(a). An offer of proof may consist of\n\na concise statement by counsel that includes a reasonably specific summary of the\n\nevidence and the relevance of the evidence, or the offer may be in question-and-\n\nanswer form. Mays v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1869240\"><a href=\"/opinion/1869240/mays-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">884</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 889–90 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009). “The\n\nprimary purpose of an offer of proof is to enable an appellate court to determine\n\nwhether the exclusion was erroneous and harmful. A secondary purpose is to permit\n\nthe trial judge to reconsider his ruling in light of the actual evidence.” Id. at 890.\n\n      Here, before the jury was sworn in, defense counsel stated that he wished to\n\nquestion Gonzales about several matters, including an ongoing CPS proceeding to\n\nterminate the parental rights of appellant and Jimenez, noting that Gonzales could\n\nget custody of the child and this would be relevant to her motive to testify. The trial\n\ncourt ruled that this evidence was not relevant. Later, after questioning Gonzales,\n\ndefense counsel put on an offer of proof concerning several topics, including\n\nGonzales’s knowledge of, and interest in, the ongoing termination proceedings.\n\nGonzales testified that she was aware of the termination proceedings, but she did not\n\n“have any say” in whether the court terminated appellant’s and Jimenez’s parental\n\nrights. Gonzales then testified that the child was currently staying with her sister,\n\nalthough before that the child had always lived with Gonzales, and that she would\n\ntake care of the child because she wanted the child to be safe. We conclude that this\n\noffer of proof sufficiently informed the trial court of the substance of the evidence\n\n\n                                           11\n\fthat appellant sought to introduce, and appellant therefore preserved his complaint\n\nabout the exclusion of this evidence. See TEX. R. EVID. 103(a); Mays, 285 S.W.3d\n\nat 889–90.\n\n      The dissenting opinion complains about procedural defects concerning\n\nappellant’s offer of proof.      Specifically, the dissenting opinion argues that\n\nappellant’s offer of proof failed to segregate admissible evidence from inadmissible\n\nevidence, such as Gonzales’s testimony regarding Jimenez’s past violent conduct,\n\nand that appellant failed to obtain a ruling on the admissibility of the evidence\n\nrelating to the termination proceeding.\n\n      The dissent cites this Court’s opinion in Sohail v. State for the proposition that\n\nwhen a party proffers evidence containing both admissible and inadmissible\n\nevidence but does not segregate the evidence to offer only the admissible statements,\n\nthe trial court may properly exclude all the statements. See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1629716\"><a href=\"/opinion/1629716/sohail-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">264</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">251</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 261\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2008, pet. ref’d). While this is a correct statement\n\nof the law, Sohail does not involve an offer of proof. Rather, in Sohail, the defendant\n\nsought to introduce into evidence during his case-in-chief a letter, an affidavit to\n\ndismiss a protective order, and a tape recording of the complainant’s conversation\n\nwith an unidentified individual, all of which included both admissible and\n\ninadmissible evidence. Id. The defendant did not attempt to redact the inadmissible\n\nstatements from these exhibits. Id. at 260. As a result, this Court held that the trial\n\n\n                                          12\n\fcourt properly excluded the exhibits because they contained inadmissible evidence.\n\nId. at 261.\n\n      The instant case involves an offer of proof, which, necessarily, is made after\n\nthe trial court has already ruled that evidence is inadmissible and has excluded that\n\nevidence. See TEX. R. EVID. 103(a)(2); Mays, 285 S.W.3d at 889 (stating that to\n\npreserve error regarding trial court’s decision to exclude evidence, complaining\n\nparty must make offer of proof setting forth substance of proffered evidence). The\n\nreason appellant made his offer of proof, which contained testimony from Gonzales\n\non several subjects, including the termination proceedings and Jimenez’s past\n\nviolent conduct, was that the trial court had already excluded all of this evidence.\n\n      The dissent also argues that appellant failed to obtain a ruling on the\n\nadmissibility of the offered testimony concerning the termination proceedings. This\n\nis incorrect. After voir dire, but before the jurors had been sworn in, the trial court,\n\ndefense counsel, and the State discussed on the record “issues of admissibility of\n\ncertain pieces of evidence.” Defense counsel stated that he wished to question\n\nGonzales about the termination proceedings. The trial court stated, “I’m going to\n\nfind the CPS investigation and any potential outcomes are not relevant to this trial\n\nand in fact would be more [prejudicial] to the defendant.” The trial court did not\n\ndefer ruling on admissibility—it immediately ruled right then that evidence\n\nconcerning the termination proceedings was not relevant and was, thus,\n\n\n                                          13\n\finadmissible. Later, after Gonzales testified in front of the jury, appellant put on his\n\noffer of proof. Appellant obtained a ruling on the admissibility of the evidence of\n\nthe termination proceedings. He was not required to obtain a second ruling on the\n\nevidence after he made his offer of proof, which he made because the trial court\n\nexcluded the evidence of the termination proceedings.2 See TEX. R. EVID. 103(a).\n\n      We conclude that appellant preserved his complaint regarding Gonzales’s bias\n\nfor appellate review, and we turn to his appeal.\n\n                                Denial of Cross-Examination\n\n      In his first issue, appellant contends that the trial court violated the\n\nConfrontation Clause by erroneously limiting his cross-examination of Gonzales\n\nconcerning any interest she might have in ongoing child-custody proceedings\n\ninvolving appellant’s and Jimenez’s daughter. He contends that the inability to\n\nquestion Gonzales about her motivation in testifying against him—specifically her\n\ninterest in possibly gaining custody of his child—together with his inability to\n\nquestion Gonzales regarding Jimenez’s past history of violence, severely\n\nundermined his ability to present his defense that he slapped Jimenez in self-defense.\n\n\n\n2\n      As support for the argument that appellant failed to obtain a ruling, the dissent cites\n      Geuder v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1880954\"><a href=\"/opinion/1880954/geuder-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 14–15 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003), which held that a\n      pretrial motion in limine generally does not preserve error concerning the exclusion\n      of evidence. Geuder did not address offers of proof or whether the complaining\n      party, after obtaining a ruling excluding evidence, must obtain an additional ruling\n      after making an offer of proof—a ruling which would have no function.\n                                            14\n\fThus, appellant makes two critical arguments in this issue. First, he was denied the\n\nconstitutional right of confrontation. Second, the ability to confront Gonzales as to\n\nher interest in the custody proceedings was essential to his ability to prove his\n\ndefense of self-defense as she was the only witness besides himself who testified as\n\nto the facts of the confrontation between himself and Jimenez, upon which he was\n\nconvicted and sentenced to twenty-five years’ confinement.            We agree with\n\nappellant.\n\nA.    Cross-Examination: The Constitutional Right of Confrontation\n\n      Cross-examination serves three general purposes: to identify the witness with\n\nthe community so that independent testimony regarding the witness’s reputation for\n\nveracity may be sought, to allow the jury to assess the credibility of the witness, and\n\nto allow facts to be brought out tending to discredit the witness by showing that his\n\ntestimony was untrue or biased.

Cross-examination is, by its nature, exploratory, “and there is no\n\ngeneral requirement that the defendant indicate the purpose of his inquiry.” Id.\n\nRather, the defendant “should be granted a wide latitude even though he is unable to\n\nstate what facts he expects to prove through his cross-examination.” Id.\n\n      The classic case on the right of confrontation under circumstances similar to\n\nthose in this case is Davis v.

Ct. at 1110. “The main and\n\nessential purpose of confrontation is to secure for the opponent the opportunity of\n\ncross-examination,” as this is “the principal means by which the believability of a\n\nwitness and the truth of his testimony are tested.” Id. at 315–16, 94 S.

Davis, 415 U.S. at 316, 94 S. Ct. at\n\n1110. A defendant’s\n\n      attack on the witness’s credibility is effected by means of cross-\n      examination directed toward revealing possible biases, prejudices, or\n      ulterior motives of the witness as they may relate directly to issues or\n      personalities in the case at hand.

The State’s “burden of\n\npersuasion is not one that requires the production of evidence, rather it requires only\n\nthat the State prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id. (citing Saxton, 804\n\nS.W.2d at 913). In order to prove the offense beyond a reasonable doubt, it must\n\nlikewise disprove the defense of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt.

Thus, if appellant produced at least some evidence that would\n\nsupport a rational jury’s finding that he hit Jimenez in defense to her use of force\n\nagainst him, the State would have to disprove his defense of self-defense beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt to prove the family violence charge against him beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\n\n      With appellant’s defense in mind—that he slapped Jimenez in self-defense\n\nonly after she karate-kicked him first—we turn to the effect of Gonzales’s testimony\n\nagainst appellant. Appellant argues that his questioning could have shown that\n\nGonzales was biased against him because of her interest as a potential managing\n\nconservator of his child and that, therefore, the trial court erred in not allowing him\n\nto question her as to ongoing parental rights termination proceedings against himself\n\nand Jimenez.\n\nC.    Relationship Between Family Violence Conviction and Child Custody\n      Proceedings\n\n      Termination and custody proceedings always entail the determination of\n\ncustody based on the conduct of the parents and the best interests of the child. The\n\ncommission of family violence is a mandatory consideration in determining the\n\ncustody of a child in both custody and termination proceedings. Texas Family Code\n\nsection 153.004(c) requires that, in custody proceedings, the family court shall\n\nconsider the commission of family violence in determining whether to deny, restrict,\n\nor limit possession of a child by a parent. TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. § 153.004(c) (West\n                                          21\n\f2014). In a case to terminate parental rights brought by the Department of Family\n\nand Protective Services (“DFPS”) under Family Code section 161.001, DFPS must\n\nestablish, by clear and convincing evidence, that (1) the parent committed one or\n\nmore of the enumerated acts or omissions justifying termination and (2) termination\n\nis in the best interest of the child.

However, Family Code section 153.131(a) creates a\n\npresumption in favor of a parent when a non-parent (such as DFPS or a grandparent\n\nor other relative) is seeking custody of a child.3 TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. § 153.131(a)\n\n\n\n3\n      Section 153.131(a) provides:\n\n                                         22\n\f(West 2014). The parental presumption set out in Family Code section 153.131(a)\n\nis expressly made subject to section 153.004 of the Code. Section 153.004(b)\n\nprovides “a rebuttable presumption that the appointment of a parent as the sole\n\nmanaging conservator of a child or as the conservator who has the exclusive right to\n\ndetermine the primary residence of a child is not in the best interest of the child if\n\ncredible   evidence     is   presented    of        a   history   or   pattern   of   past   or\n\npresent . . . physical . . . abuse by that parent directed against the other parent . . . .”\n\nId. § 153.004(b). And, as stated above, section 153.004(c) requires that, in custody\n\nproceedings, the family court “shall consider the commission of family violence in\n\ndetermining whether to deny, restrict, or limit possession of a child by a parent . . . .”\n\nId. § 153.004(c) (emphasis added).\n\nD.     Confrontation Clause Analysis\n\n       Appellant was charged with assault on a family member, Jimenez—an act of\n\nfamily violence. The elements of assault on a family member, as relevant here, are\n\n(1) intentionally (2) causing bodily injury (3) to another person (4) who is a member\n\n\n\n       Subject to the prohibition in Section 153.004, unless the court finds that\n       appointment of the parent or parents would not be in the best interest of the\n       child because the appointment would significantly impair the child’s physical\n       health or emotional development, a parent shall be appointed sole managing\n       conservator or both parents shall be appointed as joint managing\n       conservators of the child.\n\nTEX. FAM. CODE ANN. § 153.131(a) (West 2014).\n\n                                               23\n\fof the defendant’s family or a person with whom the defendant has a “dating\n\nrelationship.” TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. § 22.01(a) (West Supp. 2016) (defining\n\nassault).   Under the Penal Code, the offense is enhanced from a Class A\n\nmisdemeanor to a third-degree felony if the assault is against a family member or\n\ninvolves “dating violence” and the defendant has certain prior convictions, including\n\na prior conviction for assault on a family member. Id. § 22.01(b)(2)(A); TEX. FAM.\n\nCODE ANN. § 71.0021 (West Supp. 2016) (defining “dating violence” and “dating\n\nrelationship”); id. § 71.003 (West 2014) (defining “family”). The punishment for\n\nconviction of a third-degree felony—such as assault on a family member, second\n\noffender—when the defendant has two prior felony convictions is confinement for\n\ntwenty-five years to life. See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. § 12.42(d) (West Supp. 2016).\n\n      Because he had a prior conviction for assault on a family member as well as\n\ntwo prior felony convictions, appellant faced a sentence of twenty-five years to life\n\nupon conviction in this case for family violence. His defense at trial was that\n\nJimenez “karate kick[ed]” his phone out of his hand when he would not respond to\n\nher and that he struck her in self-defense. The only witnesses to the offense with\n\nwhich appellant was charged who testified at trial were appellant and Gonzales.\n\nJimenez, the complainant, did not testify.\n\n      At the time of trial, Jimenez and appellant were involved in ongoing child\n\ncustody proceedings to determine whether their parental rights to their one-year-old\n\n\n                                         24\n\fdaughter should be terminated. Although there is a strong presumption that the best\n\ninterest of the child is served by preserving the parent-child relationship, under the\n\nplain language of Family Code sections 153.131(a) and 153.004(b) and (c), the\n\nparental presumption is removed by a showing that the parent seeking to be\n\nappointed managing conservator has a history or pattern of past or present physical\n\nabuse directed against the other parent. See TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. §§ 153.004(b),\n\n153.131(a). Therefore, appellant’s conviction for family-violence assault, combined\n\nwith his past family-violence assault conviction, is exactly the type of evidence\n\nrequired to justify both the termination of his parental rights and the appointment of\n\nJimenez as sole managing conservator or, if Jimenez were likewise to have her rights\n\nterminated or to be shown to have a history of family violence, the parental\n\npresumption would be removed for both parents, and the appointment of a non-\n\nparent, like Gonzales, as sole managing conservator could be pursued. Thus,\n\nappellant had a “vulnerable status” with respect to testimony that he committed\n\nfamily violence. See Davis, 415 U.S. at 317–18, 94 S. Ct. at 1111; Carroll, 916\n\nS.W.2d at 500.\n\n      In this criminal case, it was the jury’s responsibility to determine beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt whether appellant committed an act of domestic violence against\n\nJimenez—hitting her in the face—without justification or whether appellant raised\n\na reasonable doubt as to whether his striking Jimenez was justified because Jimenez\n\n\n                                         25\n\fused unjustified force first against him by striking or “karate kicking” the phone\n\nfrom his hand. Only by making that determination could the jury determine whether\n\nappellant had the requisite intent to use unlawful force against Jimenez beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt and should be convicted of domestic violence or whether appellant\n\nhad raised a reasonable doubt as to his intent and should be acquitted. And on this\n\noutcome-determinative issue, the weight and credibility of Gonzales’s testimony\n\nwas critical.\n\n      The controlling question on appeal is whether, had appellant been able to\n\ncross-examine Gonzales on the termination proceedings and her interest in them, he\n\ncould have made the jury aware of a bias or interest on her part that would have\n\nmotivated her to testify against him on the underlying offense of domestic violence\n\nagainst Jimenez because of her interest in obtaining custody of his child or\n\npreventing appellant from maintaining custody of the child. Such a consideration\n\ndirectly impacts the weight to be given a witness’s testimony by the jury. See Davis,\n\n415 U.S. at 317, 94 S. Ct. at 1111.        Thus, appellant’s cross-examination of\n\nGonzales’s interest in the outcome of the parental rights termination proceeding had\n\nthe potential to raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of the jury as to whether\n\nappellant assaulted Jimenez without justification, committing an act of domestic\n\nviolence that could—and did—send him to prison for twenty-five years to life, or\n\nwhether he acted with justification in response to Jimenez’s initial, unjustified, and\n\n\n                                         26\n\funlawful act of force and therefore should have been acquitted on the basis of his\n\ndefense. See Zuliani, 97 S.W.3d at 594; Saxton, 804 S.W.2d at 913–14.\n\n      We conclude that this is a classic Confrontation Clause case. Here, the\n\nconverse of Davis is at issue: appellant, the defendant—as opposed to the witness\n\nagainst him, Gonzales—was in a particularly vulnerable status as a defendant in a\n\ndomestic dispute in which a conviction carried a twenty-five-year to life sentence\n\nand was also mandatory evidence in determining his parental and custody rights.\n\nSee TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. §§ 153.004, 153.131. Thus, he was extremely vulnerable\n\nto losing custody of his child should he be convicted of assaulting Jimenez without\n\njustification. The principal witness against him—indeed the only eyewitness who\n\ntestified at trial besides himself—was Gonzales, the grandmother of the child. Her\n\ntestimony on direct examination showed a deep possessory interest in the child, and\n\nshe could not be excluded on the basis of anything in the record of this case as a\n\npossible managing conservator should appellant and Jimenez lose their parental\n\nrights, or should appellant lose his. Thus, cross-examination and impeachment of\n\nGonzales directed toward revealing her “possible bias, prejudice or ulterior\n\nmotives . . . as they [might] relate directly to issues or personalities in the case” was\n\nnot only relevant but “‘always relevant as discrediting the witness and affecting the\n\nweight of [the] testimony.’” Davis, 415 U.S. at 316, 94 S. Ct. at 1110; Johnson, 433\n\nS.W.3d at 551.\n\n\n                                           27\n\f      Under Davis, “the jurors were entitled to have the benefit of the defense theory\n\nbefore them so that they could make an informed judgment as to the weight to place\n\non [the witness’s] testimony which provided ‘a crucial link in the proof . . . of [the\n\ndefendant’s] act” of domestic violence against Jimenez. 415 U.S. at 317, 94 S. Ct.\n\nat 1111. Appellant argued that he struck Jimenez in self-defense. The only other\n\neyewitness to the incident was Gonzales.        The State asked Gonzales whether\n\nJimenez made any physical contact with appellant before he struck her. Gonzales\n\ntestified, “She was trying to get his attention. He had a cell phone in his hand. She\n\nwhacked the phone in his hand.” Gonzales did not see what happened to the phone.\n\nShe also testified that she did not see whether Jimenez kicked appellant, stating, “I\n\nwas standing in the middle of them by that time and there was a car there.” Appellant\n\ntestified it was unlikely that Gonzales even saw clearly what happened between him\n\nand [Jimenez] because “like the tight area we [were] in, . . . [Jimenez’s] back is\n\ntowards the window of the kitchen by the door” and Gonzales came into the garage\n\nat approximately the moment the confrontation occurred.\n\n      Gonzales did not testify to anything else about the confrontation between\n\nJimenez and appellant with which appellant was charged. Instead, she testified\n\ngraphically and at length about her fears for her granddaughter’s safety in appellant’s\n\npresence and the danger she believed he presented to the child she was protecting\n\nfrom him. None of this testimony was relevant to the charged offense, but it was\n\n\n                                          28\n\fhighly prejudicial to appellant, both in his trial for striking and injuring Jimenez\n\nwithout justification and with respect to his ability to retain his parental rights to the\n\nchild, both because appellant faced a minimum twenty-five year sentence for striking\n\nJimenez without justification and because domestic violence is a mandatory\n\nconsideration in the termination and custody proceedings that were then ongoing—\n\nproceedings in which the elimination of the parental presumption in favor of\n\nappellant would allow Gonzales to seek custody of the child.\n\n      It is hard to imagine a more clear-cut case in which a criminal defendant\n\nshould have been permitted to confront the sole eyewitness against him to allow the\n\njury to assess her credibility and to allow facts to be brought out regarding her\n\ninterest in the child that might tend to discredit her by showing that her relevant\n\ntestimony with respect to the charged offense was untrue or biased. See Carroll,\n\n916 S.W.2d at 497; see also Davis, 415 U.S. at 316, 94 S. Ct. at 1110 (stating that\n\npartiality of witness is subject to exploration and is always relevant to discrediting\n\nwitness and affecting weight of testimony, and stating that exposing witness’s\n\nmotivation in testifying is proper function of protected right of cross-examination).\n\n      As appellant points out, an interest in the outcome of a child custody\n\ndetermination has twice been held by the intermediate appellate courts of this state\n\nto be a valid area for exposing bias through cross-examination in circumstances that\n\n\n\n\n                                           29\n\fdid not involve termination proceedings or the potential of a long prison sentence\n\nfor the party seeking cross-examination.\n\n      In Fox v.

First, she briefly\n\ntestified about the incident with which appellant was charged, indicating that\n\nJimenez tried to get appellant’s attention by “whack[ing] the phone in his hand.”\n\nShe then testified extensively and emotionally concerning appellant’s violence\n\ntowards his and Jimenez’s child as Gonzales tried to get him to leave the house after\n\nJimenez had already left. Yet appellant was expressly prohibited from asking\n\nGonzales whether she knew there was an ongoing child custody dispute to terminate\n\nthe parental rights of both Jimenez and appellant and whether Gonzales had an\n\ninterest in those proceedings. He was also prohibited from asking her whether she\n\nactually or potentially stood to obtain custody of the child in the accompanying\n\ncustody proceedings.\n\n      Without cross-examination, the jury in this case was deprived of facts\n\nnecessary to determine Gonzales’s credibility and thus to make an informed\n\njudgment as to her motivation and the weight to be placed on her testimony, which\n\nwas crucial to the proof of appellant’s intent to strike and injure Jimenez without\n\njustification and therefore with criminal intent. See Davis, 415 U.S. at 317, 94 S.\n\nCt. at 1111; Douglas, 390 U.S. at 419, 85 S. Ct. at 1077. Thus, Gonzales’s testimony\n\nabout appellant’s family violence was critical to his conviction. Moreover, had the\n\njury agreed that appellant raised a reasonable doubt as to his defense of self-defense,\n\n\n                                          32\n\fit could not have convicted him of domestic violence beyond a reasonable doubt—\n\na mandatory consideration in determining whether he would lose custody of the child\n\nto Jimenez, Gonzales herself, or another in the then-ongoing parental rights\n\ntermination proceedings.      See TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. §§ 153.004, 153.131.\n\nTherefore, there was a direct and crucial link between the weight placed by the jury\n\non Gonzales’s testimony in appellant’s trial for domestic violence and her own\n\npossible bias or interest in the parental rights termination proceedings and ultimate\n\npossession of the child. See, e.g., Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 678–79, 106 S. Ct. at\n\n1435 (“[E]xposure of a witness’ motivation in testifying is a proper and important\n\nfunction of the constitutionally protected right of cross-examination.”); Billodeau,\n\n277 S.W.3d at 42–43 (“The possible animus, motive, or ill will of a prosecution\n\nwitness who testifies against the defendant is never a collateral or irrelevant inquiry,\n\nand the defendant is entitled, subject to reasonable restrictions, to show any relevant\n\nfact that might tend to establish ill feeling, bias, motive, interest, or animus on the\n\npart of any witness testifying against him”); Carpenter, 979 S.W.2d at 634\n\n(“Exposing a witness’ motivation to testify for or against the accused or the State is\n\na proper and important purpose of cross-examination.”); Lewis, 815 S.W.2d at 565\n\n(defendant is entitled to pursue all avenues of cross-examination reasonably\n\ncalculated to expose motive, bias, or interest for witness’s testimony).\n\n\n\n\n                                          33\n\f      We hold that the trial court abused its discretion by denying appellant his\n\nconstitutional right under the Confrontation Clause to question Gonzales about her\n\ninterest in the outcome of ongoing parental rights termination proceedings against\n\nhim and Jimenez and therefore her possible bias in testifying against him. We now\n\ndetermine whether the error was harmful.\n\nE.    Harm Analysis\n\n      Constitutional error in a criminal case is subject to harmless error review.\n\nTEX. R. APP. P. 44.2. In such a case, the court of appeals must reverse a judgment\n\nof conviction unless the court determines beyond a reasonable doubt that the error\n\ndid not contribute to the conviction or punishment. Id. This rule is based on the\n\nparallel federal rule of criminal procedure; and, therefore, decisions of the United\n\nStates Supreme Court may be looked to for guidance in interpreting the state rule.\n\nJohnson v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1382990\"><a href=\"/opinion/1382990/johnson-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 4 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001). Accordingly, the Court\n\nof Criminal Appeals has adopted the Supreme Court’s conclusion that it is the\n\nresponsibility of the appellate court to assess harm after reviewing the record. Id.\n\n(quoting O’Neal v. McAninch, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117897\"><a href=\"/opinion/117897/oneal-v-mcaninch/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 436–37, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117897\"><a href=\"/opinion/117897/oneal-v-mcaninch/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

California. See 475 U.S. at 680–81, 106 S. Ct. at\n\n1436 (citing Chapman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107359\"><a href=\"/opinion/107359/chapman-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 24, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107359\"><a href=\"/opinion/107359/chapman-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">824</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 828 (1967)). Under this\n\n\n                                        34\n\fstandard, the reviewing court must inquire whether, assuming the damaging\n\npotential of the cross-examination were fully realized, a reviewing court might\n\nnonetheless say the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. at 684, 106\n\nS. Ct. at 1438. The reviewing court looks at “the importance of the witness’\n\ntestimony in the prosecution’s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the\n\npresence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the\n\nwitness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and,\n\nof course, the overall strength of the prosecution’s case.” Id.\n\n        Here, Gonzales was the State’s principal witness against appellant, since\n\nJimenez did not testify, and there were discrepancies between Gonzales’s testimony\n\nand that of both appellant and Officer Portillo, who responded to Gonzales’s 9-1-1\n\ncall.   Her testimony contradicted appellant’s description of the confrontation\n\nbetween himself and Jimenez. Having first testified that Jimenez “whacked” the\n\nphone in appellant’s hand to get his attention, Gonzales subsequently testified that\n\nJimenez merely “slapped the phone” in appellant’s hand and that appellant then hit\n\nJimenez in the face, knocking her back and causing her mouth to start bleeding\n\nimmediately. Appellant, by contrast, testified that he “slapped” Jimenez in self-\n\ndefense when Jimenez “karate kick[ed the] phone out of [his] hand,” striking his\n\nhand and causing the phone to hit the car. Gonzales admitted she did not see what\n\nhappened to the phone. According to Gonzales, Jimenez’s mouth swelled into “a\n\n\n                                          35\n\fbig ball on her lip.” Officer Portillo testified that Jimenez “had redness to the face”\n\nand a cut on her upper lip and that her eyes were watering. Gonzales also testified\n\nthat appellant “kicked her car doors in” and “ransacked” the house. Appellant\n\ntestified that he went into the house to get his identification and wallet when\n\nGonzales ordered him to leave. Officer Portillo saw no evidence of ransacking or of\n\ndamage to any property in the garage. Gonzales testified extensively, without\n\nrebuttal, to appellant’s treatment of the child and of herself after Jimenez had left the\n\nscene in response to Gonzales’s order and before appellant likewise left at\n\nGonzales’s command.\n\n      Jimenez did not testify. Therefore, the only direct witness to the confrontation\n\nbetween Jimenez and himself, besides appellant, was Gonzales. Appellant contends\n\nthat because he could not cross-examine Gonzales for bias or interest, the jury heard\n\nonly her testimony that Jimenez merely slapped the phone out of his hand “to get his\n\nattention” and his testimony, which, he contends, it could have discounted as self-\n\nserving.\n\n      Considering the Chapman and Van Arsdall standard for harmless error in\n\ndenial of cross-examination under these circumstances, Gonzales’ testimony was of\n\ngreat importance to the prosecution’s case against appellant for domestic violence,\n\nand her testimony was not cumulative, as no other eyewitness present at the time of\n\nthe offense testified about the confrontation between appellant and Jimenez other\n\n\n                                           36\n\fthan appellant himself, as Jimenez did not testify. See Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 684,\n\n106 S. Ct. at 1438.\n\n        Most importantly, appellant’s inability to confront Gonzales for bias or\n\ninterest greatly affected the overall strength of the prosecution’s case and of\n\nappellant’s defense of self-defense. See Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 684, 106 S. Ct. at\n\n1438.     Appellant was charged with assault on a family member, i.e., with\n\n(1) intentionally (2) causing bodily injury (3) to another person (4) who is a member\n\nof the defendant’s family or a person with whom the defendant has a “dating\n\nrelationship.” TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. § 22.01(a). Both appellant and Gonzales\n\ntestified that Jimenez struck appellant’s phone first. But Gonzales’s testimony\n\nswiftly veered to the subsequent confrontation between her and appellant over the\n\nchild and Gonzales’s command that appellant leave the house. Thus, without\n\nevidence of Gonzales’s interest in the child, there was nothing to support appellant’s\n\nclaim of self-defense in his confrontation with Jimenez other than his own testimony,\n\ntestimony that was overwhelmed by Gonzales’s testimony about her interest in\n\nprotecting the child from appellant.\n\n        Had the jury been in possession of the facts into which appellant was\n\nforbidden to inquire on cross-examination of Gonzales, it could have made an\n\ninformed judgment as to the weight to place on her testimony regarding the charged\n\ndomestic violence offense—testimony which provided a crucial link to the proof of\n\n\n                                         37\n\fboth appellant’s act against Jimenez and his defense of self-defense. Accordingly,\n\nwe hold that the trial court’s error in denying appellant the right to cross-examine\n\nGonzales about her interest in the termination of parental rights proceedings and the\n\nattendant custody dispute was harmful to appellant’s case. See Van Arsdall, 475\n\nU.S. at 684, 106 S. Ct. at 1438; see also TEX. R. APP. P. 44.2(a) (stating that, in cases\n\ninvolving constitutional error, appellate court must reverse judgment of conviction\n\nunless court determines beyond a reasonable doubt that error did not contribute to\n\nconviction).\n\n      We sustain appellant’s first issue.4\n\n                                         Conclusion\n\n      We reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand this case for a new trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                                Evelyn V. Keyes\n                                                Justice\n\nPanel consists of Justices Jennings, Keyes, and Brown.\n\nJustice Brown, dissenting.\n\nPublish. TEX. R. APP. P. 47.2(b).\n\n\n4\n      Because we sustain appellant’s first issue, and therefore remand this case for a new\n      trial, we need not address appellant’s second issue concerning the exclusion of\n      evidence of Jimenez’s violent acts against Gonzales, as resolution of that issue\n      would afford him no greater relief.\n                                           38\n\f</pre>",
