Dr. Jon Oberg, as relator for the United States, brought\n\nthis action against certain student loan corporations, alleging\n\nthat they defrauded the Department of Education and so violated\n\nthe False Claims Act (“FCA” or “the Act”), 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729 et\n\nseq.     (2006).            The   district      court       initially       dismissed     the\n\ncomplaint in its entirety.                    When Dr. Oberg appealed, we held\n\nthat the court had not employed the proper legal framework --\n\nthe arm-of-the-state analysis -- in reaching its conclusion and\n\nthus vacated its judgment and remanded the case.                              See U.S. ex\n\nrel. Oberg v. Ky. Higher Educ. Student Loan Corp., 681 F.3d 575,\n\n579-81 (4th Cir. 2012) (“Oberg I”).                        After applying the arm-of-\n\nthe-state analysis on remand, the district court again concluded\n\nthat    all      of   the    student     loan       corporations      constituted       state\n\nagencies not subject to suit under the Act and so again granted\n\ntheir    motions       to    dismiss.         For    the    reasons    that    follow,     we\n\naffirm      in      part,     vacate     in     part,      and     remand     for   further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n                                               I.\n\n       On   behalf      of      the   United    States,      Dr.    Oberg    brought      this\n\naction      against       the     Pennsylvania        Higher     Education      Assistance\n\nAgency,       the     Vermont     Student      Assistance        Corporation,       and   the\n\n                                                3\n\fArkansas     Student        Loan    Authority          (collectively      “appellees”).\n\nAppellees are corporate entities established by their respective\n\nstates to improve access to higher education by originating,\n\nfinancing, and guaranteeing student loans. 1\n\n     Dr. Oberg alleges that appellees defrauded the Department\n\nof Education by submitting false claims for Special Allowance\n\nPayments     (“SAP”),       a     generous    federal        student      loan      interest\n\nsubsidy.         According         to   Dr.       Oberg,     appellees         engaged   in\n\nnoneconomic sham transactions to inflate their loan portfolios\n\neligible    for      SAP,    and    the   Department         of   Education         overpaid\n\nhundreds of millions of dollars to appellees as a result of the\n\nscheme.     Dr. Oberg alleges that appellees violated the FCA when\n\nthey knowingly submitted these false SAP claims.\n\n     The FCA provides a cause of action against “any person” who\n\nengages    in     certain       fraudulent        conduct,     including        “knowingly\n\npresent[ing],        or     caus[ing]        to     be     presented,      a     false   or\n\nfraudulent      claim       for    payment        or     approval”   to    an       officer,\n\nemployee,       or    agent        of   the       United     States.           31     U.S.C.\n\n§ 3729(a)(1)(A).          The Act does not define the term “person.”                     In\n\nVermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States, ex rel.\n\n\n     1\n       Dr. Oberg also sued other defendants not parties to this\nappeal.    Among those defendants was another student loan\ncorporation,   the  Kentucky   Higher  Education  Student  Loan\nCorporation, which reached a settlement with Dr. Oberg shortly\nbefore the most recent appeal.\n\n\n                                              4\n\fStevens, 529 U.S. 765, 787-88 (2000), the Supreme Court held\n\nthat a state or state agency does not constitute a “person”\n\nsubject to liability under the Act.                 But the Court also noted\n\nthat corporations, by contrast, are “presumptively covered by\n\nthe term ‘person.’”            Id. at 782 (emphasis in original).               And\n\nthree years later, the Court applied the latter presumption and\n\nheld       that   municipal    corporations      like   counties    are    ‘persons’\n\nsubject to suit under the FCA.                 See Cook Cnty. v. U.S. ex rel.\n\nChandler, 538 U.S. 119, 122 (2003).\n\n       Accordingly, a court must walk a careful line between two\n\ncompeting         presumptions     to     determine      if    a    state-created\n\ncorporation is “truly subject to sufficient state control to\n\nrender [it] a part of the state, and not a ‘person,’ for FCA\n\npurposes.”        Oberg I, 681 F.3d at 579. 2           In the prior appeal, we\n\nheld       that   the   appropriate     legal    framework    for   this   delicate\n\ninquiry is the arm-of-the-state analysis used in the Eleventh\n\nAmendment context.            Id. at 579-80.       Because the district court\n\nhad not undertaken this analysis, we vacated its judgment and\n\n       2\n       Dr. Oberg insists that only one presumption applies: that\nall corporate entities -- regardless of their affiliation with a\nstate -- must overcome a “presumption of ‘personhood.’”\nAppellant’s Br. 15.   The dissent seems to agree.    See Dissent.\nOp. at 34. But this assertion ignores the Supreme Court’s clear\ninstruction that in the context of corporations created by and\nsponsored by a state, competing presumptions are at play.     See\nStevens, 529 U.S. at 782 (observing that “the presumption with\nregard to corporations is just the opposite of the one governing\n[state entities]”).\n\n\n                                           5\n\fremanded the case to the district court for application of the\n\nproper legal framework.            Id. at 581.\n\n       On   remand,      after    applying       the    arm-of-the-state       analysis,\n\nthe district court concluded that each appellee is part of its\n\nrespective state and thus not a “person” under the Act, and so\n\nagain granted appellees’ motions to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 12(b)(6).          Dr. Oberg then timely noted this appeal.\n\n       On review of a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, we consider a case\n\nde novo.       See E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Kolon Indus.,\n\nInc., 637 F.3d 435, 440 (4th Cir. 2011).                             We evaluate only\n\nwhether     the   complaint        states        “a    claim    to    relief   that    is\n\nplausible on its face.”                 Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S.\n\n544, 547 (2007).           In doing so, we construe “facts in the light\n\nmost   favorable      to    the    plaintiff,”          Nemet   Chevrolet,      Ltd.   v.\n\nConsumeraffairs.com, Inc., 591 F.3d 250, 255 (4th Cir. 2009),\n\nand    “draw   all    reasonable          inferences      in    [his]    favor”      Kolon\n\nIndus., 637       F.3d     at    440.      Yet    “we    need   not   accept    as    true\n\nunwarranted inferences, unreasonable conclusions, or arguments.”\n\nKloth v. Microsoft Corp., 444 F.3d 312, 319 (4th Cir. 2006).\n\nNor do we credit allegations that offer only “naked assertions\n\ndevoid of further factual enhancement.”                    Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556\n\nU.S. 662, 678 (2009) (internal quotations marks, alteration, and\n\ncitation omitted).\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\f       Moreover, in reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, we are\n\nnot confined to the four corners of the complaint.                   It is well\n\nestablished   that    “we    may    properly      take    judicial    notice   of\n\nmatters of public record,” including statutes.                Philips v. Pitt\n\nCnty. Mem’l Hosp., 572 F.3d 176, 180 (4th Cir. 2009).                     We may\n\nalso   consider   “documents       incorporated     into    the    complaint   by\n\nreference,” Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551\n\nU.S. 308, 322 (2007), “as well as those attached to the motion\n\nto dismiss, so long as they are integral to the complaint and\n\nauthentic,” Philips, 572 F.3d at 180.                    Thus, before us, the\n\nparties properly cite to and rely on state statutes and exhibits\n\nintegral to the complaint.\n\n       Finally, we note that although arm-of-the-state status may\n\nwell constitute an affirmative defense in the related Eleventh\n\nAmendment context, this is not so in an FCA case.                  To succeed in\n\nan FCA case, a relator must demonstrate that a defendant is a\n\n“person”   within    the    meaning    of   the    Act.       As    the   dissent\n\nrecognizes, this is “a statutory question.”                Dissent. Op. at 36.\n\nThat is, personhood is an element of the statutory FCA claim,\n\nnot an immunity providing a defense from suit as in the Eleventh\n\nAmendment context.     See, e.g., U.S. ex rel. Adrian v. Regents of\n\nUniv. of Cal., 363 F.3d 398, 401-02 (5th Cir. 2004) (dismissing\n\n\n\n\n                                       7\n\fFCA action on 12(b)(6) motion because “the FCA does not provide\n\na cause of action against state agencies”). 3\n\n\n\n                                II.\n\n     In applying the arm-of-the-state analysis, we consider four\n\nnonexclusive factors to determine whether an entity is “truly\n\nsubject to sufficient state control to render [it] a part of the\n\nstate.”   Oberg I, 681 F.3d at 579.\n\n     First, when (as here), an entity is a defendant, we ask\n\n“whether any judgment against the entity as defendant will be\n\npaid by the State.”     Oberg I, 681 F.3d at 580 (quoting S.C.\n\nDep’t Disabilities & Special Needs v. Hoover Universal, Inc.,\n\n535 F.3d 300, 303 (4th Cir. 2008)). 4      The Supreme Court has\n\n\n     3\n       The dissent’s suggestion to the contrary thus misses the\nmark.   Tellingly, it offers only Eleventh Amendment cases in\nsupport of its contention that arm-of-the-state status is an\naffirmative defense.    See Dissent. Op. at 35-36.      But the\nSupreme Court has made clear that the statutory FCA question is\ndistinct from the Eleventh Amendment inquiry. See Stevens, 529\nU.S. at 779-80 (explaining that the Court initially considers\nwhether “the [FCA] itself permits the cause of action it creates\nto be asserted against States” before reaching the Eleventh\nAmendment sovereign immunity question).\n     4\n       When an entity is a plaintiff, this factor requires us to\ndetermine “whether any recovery by the entity as plaintiff will\ninure to the benefit of the State.” Hoover Universal, 535 F.3d\nat 303.   We previously regarded the first factor as “the most\nimportant consideration,” Ram Ditta v. Md. Nat’l Capital Park &\nPlanning Comm’n, 822 F.2d 456, 457 (4th Cir. 1987), and the\ndissent seems to regard it as dispositive, see Dissent. Op. at\n41.   But as we noted in Oberg I, 681 F.3d at 580 n.3, more\n(Continued)\n                                 8\n\finstructed that in assessing this factor, an entity’s “potential\n\nlegal liability” is key.        Regents, 519 U.S. at 431; see also\n\nParker v. Franklin Cnty. Cmty. Sch. Corp., 667 F.3d 910, 927-28\n\n(7th Cir. 2012) (focusing on legal liability for payment of a\n\njudgment in the wake of Regents); Cooper v. Se. Penn. Transp.\n\nAuth., 548 F.3d 296, 303 (3d Cir. 2008)(same); U.S. ex rel.\n\nSikkenga v. Regence Bluecross Blueshield of Utah, 472 F.3d 702,\n\n718 (10th Cir. 2006) (same).           Thus, we consider whether state\n\nlaw   “provides   that   obligations       of   [the   entity]   shall   not   be\n\nbinding on [the] State.”        Lake Country Estates, Inc. v. Tahoe\n\nReg’l Planning Agency, 440 U.S. 391, 402 (1979) (emphasis in\n\noriginal).   In doing so, we look to whether “State law indicates\n\nthat a judgment against [the entity] can be enforced against the\n\nState.”   Cash v. Granville Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 242 F.3d 219, 224\n\n(4th Cir. 2001).\n\n      An entity may also constitute an arm of the state “where\n\nthe state is functionally liable, even if not legally liable.”\n\nStoner v. Santa Clara Cnty. Office of Educ., 502 F.3d 1116, 1122\n\n(9th Cir. 2007) (emphasis added); see also Hess v. Port Auth.\n\nTrans-Hudson Corp., 513 U.S. 30, 50 (1994) (“Where an agency is\n\n\n\nrecent Supreme Court precedent suggests that although this\nfactor remains of “considerable importance,” Regents of the\nUniv. of Cal. v. Doe, 519 U.S. 425, 430 (1997), it does not\ndeserve dispositive preeminence, see Fed. Maritime Comm’n v.\nS.C. State Ports Auth., 535 U.S. 743, 765 (2002).\n\n\n                                       9\n\fso structured that, as a practical matter, if the agency is to\n\nsurvive, a judgment must expend itself against state treasuries,\n\ncommon sense and the rationale of the eleventh amendment require\n\nthat     sovereign      immunity      attach       to     the    agency.”)        (internal\n\nquotation marks and alteration omitted).\n\n       Second, we assess “the degree of autonomy exercised by the\n\nentity,       including    such       circumstances         as     who       appoints     the\n\nentity’s      directors    or     officers,        who     funds       the    entity,     and\n\nwhether the State retains a veto over the entity’s actions.”\n\nOberg I, 681 F.3d at 580 (quoting Hoover Universal, 535 F.3d at\n\n303).         Also     relevant       to     the       autonomy        inquiry     is     the\n\ndetermination whether an entity has the ability to contract, sue\n\nand be sued, and purchase and sell property, see Cash, 242 F.3d\n\nat     225;   Ram     Ditta,    822    F.2d       at    458,     and     whether    it    is\n\nrepresented in legal matters by the state attorney general, see,\n\ne.g., Md. Stadium Auth. v. Ellerbe Becket, Inc., 407 F.3d 255,\n\n264 (4th Cir. 2005).\n\n       Third, we consider “whether the entity is involved with\n\nstate concerns as distinct from non-state concerns, including\n\nlocal    concerns.”       Oberg       I,    681    F.3d    at    580    (quoting     Hoover\n\nUniversal, 535 F.3d at 303).                “Non-state concerns,” however, do\n\nnot mean only “local” concerns, but rather also encompass other\n\nnon-state interests like out-of-state operations.                              See Hoover\n\nUniversal,      535    F.3d     at    307    (characterizing            this     factor    as\n\n                                             10\n\f“whether the entity is involved with statewide, as opposed to\n\nlocal or other non-state concerns”) (emphasis added).\n\n      Fourth, we look to “how the entity is treated under state\n\nlaw, such as whether the entity’s relationship with the State is\n\nsufficiently close to make the entity an arm of the State.”\n\nOberg I, 681 F.3d at 580 (quoting Hoover Universal, 535 F.3d at\n\n303).      Whether an entity is an arm of the state is ultimately a\n\nquestion of federal law, “[b]ut that federal question can be\n\nanswered only after considering the provisions of state law that\n\ndefine the agency’s character.”              Regents, 519 U.S. at 429 n.5.\n\n“In   addressing      this   factor,    a    court   may    consider   both   the\n\nrelevant      state     statutes,      regulations,        and   constitutional\n\nprovisions which characterize the entity, and the holdings of\n\nstate courts on the question.”               Md. Stadium Auth., 407 F.3d at\n\n265 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      With these principles in mind, we now apply arm-of-the-\n\nstate analysis to each of the appellees.\n\n\n\n                                       III.\n\n      We    initially    consider   the      Pennsylvania    Higher    Education\n\nAssistance Agency (“PHEAA”).           In 1963, the Pennsylvania General\n\nAssembly created PHEAA, which, according to PHEAA itself, now\n\nconstitutes one of the nation’s largest providers of student\n\nfinancial aid services.         Although PHEAA continues to administer\n\n                                        11\n\fstate-funded      student         aid     programs         in      Pennsylvania,       it\n\nacknowledges that it also operates nationally under the names\n\nAmerican Education Services and FedLoan Servicing.\n\n      The first factor in the arm-of-the-state analysis, whether\n\nPennsylvania would pay a judgment against PHEAA in this case,\n\nweighs decidedly against holding that PHEAA is an arm of the\n\nstate.     For    “instead     of       the    state      treasury    being    directly\n\nresponsible for judgments against [PHEAA], [state law] expressly\n\nprovides that obligations of [PHEAA] shall not be binding on\n\n[the] State.”      Lake Country Estates, 440 U.S. at 402 (emphasis\n\nin original).          Pennsylvania explicitly disavows liability for\n\nall of PHEAA’s debts.           See 24 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 5104(3)(2012)\n\n(“no obligation of the agency shall be a debt of the State”).\n\nIn addition, state law emphasizes that PHEAA’s debts are not\n\n“payable out of any moneys except those of the corporation.”\n\nId.      Aside   from     state     appropriations          that     go   directly     to\n\nstudents   in    the    form   of   education          grants,     moreover,     PHEAA’s\n\nsubstantial “moneys” derive exclusively from its own operations.\n\nThe   Pennsylvania        treasury        is       thus     neither       legally     nor\n\nfunctionally liable for any judgment against PHEAA.                        See Stoner,\n\n502 F.3d at 1122.\n\n      Nevertheless,       PHEAA     contends        that     the     important      first\n\nfactor weighs in favor of concluding that it is an arm of the\n\nstate because state statutes require that its funds be deposited\n\n                                              12\n\finto the state treasury and that “no money” be paid from the\n\ntreasury without approval from the state treasurer.                     See 24 Pa.\n\nCons. Stat. § 5104(3); 72 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 307 (2013).                            This\n\nargument,     however,       ignores       “a    commonplace      of        statutory\n\nconstruction that the specific governs the general.”                    Morales v.\n\nTrans World Airlines, 504 U.S. 374, 384 (1992).                      The statutory\n\nprovisions    specifically     outlining        PHEAA’s    “powers     and    duties”\n\nclearly indicate      that    PHEAA’s      board    of    directors    -–    not   the\n\nstate   treasurer    -–    controls     PHEAA’s      funds.      Those       statutes\n\nprovide that PHEAA’s funds “shall be available to the agency”\n\nand “may be utilized at the discretion of the board of directors\n\nfor carrying out any of the corporate purposes of the agency.”\n\n24 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 5104(3).              Further, the state treasurer may\n\nuse PHEAA’s funds only for purposes “consistent with guidelines\n\napproved by the board of directors.”               Id.\n\n     Moreover, PHEAA’s funds are held in a segregated account\n\napart from general state funds.                 Id. § 5105.10.          Our sister\n\ncircuits     have   recognized      that     such    an   arrangement        counsels\n\nagainst establishing arm-of-the-state status under this factor.\n\nThe First Circuit, for instance, held that the University of\n\nRhode Island is not an arm of its state in part because its\n\nfunds are not “merged with[] the general fund, but are kept in\n\nsegregated      accounts      [in      the       state      treasury]         pending\n\ndiscretionary disbursement by the [University’s] Board.”                       Univ.\n\n                                        13\n\fof R.I. v. A.W. Chesterton Co., 2 F.3d 1200, 1210 (1st Cir.\n\n1993).     Similarly, the Third Circuit, in assessing whether the\n\nPublic School Employees’ Retirement Board of Pennsylvania was an\n\narm of the state, remanded the case for further consideration in\n\npart because -– like PHEEA’s account -- the entity’s fund was\n\n“set apart in the state treasury from general state funds and []\n\nadministered by the State Treasurer at the discretion of the\n\nBoard.”       Blake v. Kline, 612 F.2d 718, 723 (3d. Cir. 1979)\n\n(footnote and citations omitted).          In sum, because state law\n\ninstructs that PHEAA would pay any judgment in this case with\n\nits own moneys from its segregated fund, see 24 Pa. Cons. Stat.\n\n§ 5104(3)(2012), the first factor weighs heavily against holding\n\nthat PHEAA is an arm of the state.\n\n      The second factor, the degree of autonomy exercised by the\n\nentity, presents a closer question.         PHEAA’s board of directors\n\nis composed of gubernatorial appointees and state legislators or\n\nofficials.      See 24 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 5103 (repealed July 2010,\n\nbut effective during the period when PHEAA allegedly violated\n\nthe   FCA).      Such   an   arrangement   frequently   indicates   state\n\ncontrol.      See Md. Stadium Auth., 407 F.3d at 264.           Further,\n\nstate officials exercise some degree of veto power over PHEAA’s\n\noperations.     For example, the Auditor General may review PHEAA’s\n\nactivities, 24 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 5108, and PHEAA must seek the\n\napproval of the Governor in order to issue notes and bonds, id.\n\n                                    14\n\f§ 5104(3).         These factors may mean, as PHEAA contends, that it\n\nis simply a tool of the state.\n\n      But   other     indicia      relevant    to   the    autonomy       analysis    --\n\nPHEAA’s     source     of    funding,     control    over    its    revenues,        and\n\ncorporate powers –- strongly suggest that PHEAA is not an arm of\n\nthe state.         Most critically, PHEAA is financially independent.\n\nAccording     to    its   annual    reports,    which     were    attached     to    the\n\namended complaint, PHEAA receives no operational funding from\n\nPennsylvania.        See also Appellees’ Br. 53 (conceding the point).\n\nPennsylvania       law,     moreover,    expressly      instructs     that    PHEAA’s\n\nfunds “shall be available to the agency,” and that PHEAA’s board\n\nmay use those funds in any manner that furthers the agency’s\n\ncorporate purposes.           24 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 5104(3).                Meanwhile,\n\nthe   state    treasurer’s       use    of    PHEAA’s     funds    must    adhere     to\n\n“guidelines approved by the board” of PHEAA.                        Id.      Finally,\n\nPHEAA has the power to enter into contracts, sue and be sued,\n\nand purchase and sell property in its own name, all of which\n\nsuggest operational autonomy.                See Cash, 242 F.3d at 225; Ram\n\nDitta, 822 F.2d at 458.                Although the facts relevant to this\n\nsecond factor cut both ways, when we consider “all reasonable\n\ninferences in favor of the plaintiff” as we must at this stage,\n\nKolon Indus., 637 F.3d at 440, we conclude that this factor also\n\ncounsels against holding that PHEAA is an arm of the state.\n\n\n\n                                          15\n\f      The   third        factor      is    whether      PHEAA     “is     involved     with\n\nstatewide, as opposed to local or other non-state concerns.”\n\nHoover    Universal,          535   F.3d     at   307.      Dr.     Oberg      poses    two\n\narguments relevant to this factor.\n\n      Initially,         he    contends      that    due   to     PHEAA’s      commercial\n\nfocus, its operations do not involve an area of legitimate state\n\nconcern.      See        Appellant’s       Br.    43;    Reply    Br.     25-26.       This\n\nargument fails.           Pennsylvania created PHEAA to finance, make,\n\nand     guarantee        loans      for    higher       education,       and   “[h]igher\n\neducation    is     an    area      of    quintessential        state    concern     and    a\n\ntraditional state government function.”                     Md. Stadium Auth., 407\n\nF.3d at 265.        PHEAA does not provide higher education directly,\n\nbut it nonetheless facilitates the attainment of education by\n\nsupplying student financial aid services.                       This work is clearly\n\nof legitimate state concern.\n\n      Dr. Oberg’s remaining argument as to the third factor is\n\nthat PHEAA’s operations from 2002 to 2006 -- during the time in\n\nwhich     PHEAA   allegedly          conducted       fraudulent         transactions       in\n\nviolation of the FCA -- were so focused out of state that PHEAA\n\nwas not involved primarily with state concerns. 5                        See Ram Ditta,\n\n\n\n      5\n       PHEAA counters that out-of-state operations are irrelevant\nbecause this factor is concerned only with whether an entity’s\nfocus is statewide as opposed to local.         The argument is\nmisguided. Rather, this factor looks to “whether the entity is\n(Continued)\n                                             16\n\f822 F.2d at 459; cf. Hoover Universal, 535 F.3d at 307.                         To this\n\nend,     Dr.   Oberg      alleges     that     “PHEAA        conducts       substantial\n\noperations outside of Pennsylvania,” and that as early as 2005,\n\n“one-third     of       PHEAA’s     earnings        c[a]me        from     outside   the\n\n[C]ommonwealth,”         after      which      it     further            “expanded   its\n\noperations.”        PHEAA’s financial reports, cited throughout Dr.\n\nOberg’s complaint, tend to corroborate these claims, so there is\n\nlittle    doubt     that    during     the     period        in    question     PHEAA’s\n\noperations     extended     well    beyond     the    borders       of     Pennsylvania.\n\nEven so, if only one-third of PHEAA’s earnings came from outside\n\nPennsylvania in 2005, it does not seem plausible that by 2006 --\n\nthe last year encompassed by Dr. Oberg’s allegations -– PHEAA’s\n\noperations focused primarily out of state.                        See Ram Ditta, 822\n\nF.2d at 459; see also Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (explaining that\n\n“[w]here a complaint pleads facts that are merely consistent\n\nwith a defendant’s liability, it stops short of the line between\n\npossibility       and     plausibility        of     entitlement           to   relief”)\n\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).                          Therefore, we\n\nbelieve this factor weighs in favor of arm-of-the-state status\n\nfor PHEAA.\n\n\n\n\ninvolved with statewide, as opposed to local or other non-state\nconcerns.” Hoover Universal, 535 F.3d at 307 (emphasis added).\n\n\n                                         17\n\f       The final factor, how PHEAA is treated under state law,\n\nalso    supports         PHEAA’s       contention            that    it         is    an    arm     of\n\nPennsylvania.           A state statute provides that “the creation of\n\nthe    agency      [was]      in      all    respects        for     the    benefit         of    the\n\npeople . . . and the agency [performs] an essential governmental\n\nfunction.”         24     Pa.      Cons.     Stat.     § 5105.6.            PHEAA’s         enabling\n\nlegislation was made effective by “amendment to the Constitution\n\nof     Pennsylvania           authorizing           grants      or     loans          for    higher\n\neducation,”        id.     § 5112,         and    Pennsylvania            state      courts       have\n\nconcluded        that     PHEAA       is    a    state      agency     for       jurisdictional\n\npurposes, see, e.g., Richmond v. Penn. Higher Educ. Assistance\n\nAgency, 297 A.2d 544, 546 (1972); Penn. Higher Educ. Assistance\n\nAgency v. Barksdale, 449 A.2d 688, 689-90 (1982).\n\n       In sum, although the third and fourth factors suggest that\n\nPHEAA is an arm of the state, the first (strongly) and second\n\n(albeit less strongly) point in the opposite direction.                                     At this\n\nearly stage, construing the facts in the light most favorable to\n\nthe    plaintiff,         Nemet       Chevrolet,          591   F.3d       at     255,      we    must\n\nconclude that Dr. Oberg has alleged sufficient facts that PHEAA\n\nis    not   an   arm     of     the    state,       but     rather    a    “person”         for   FCA\n\npurposes.         We     therefore         vacate     the    judgment       of       the    district\n\ncourt as to PHEAA and remand to permit limited discovery on the\n\nquestion whether PHEAA is “truly subject to sufficient state\n\n\n\n                                                 18\n\fcontrol to render [it] a part of the state.”                           Oberg I, 681 F.3d\n\nat 579.\n\n\n\n                                              IV.\n\n       We next consider whether Dr. Oberg’s complaint states a\n\nplausible claim that the Vermont Student Assistance Corporation\n\n(“VSAC”) is a “person” subject to suit under the FCA.                                       The\n\nVermont      legislature       created    VSAC       in   1965    to    provide       Vermont\n\nresidents       with     opportunities        to     attend      college     by     awarding\n\neducation grants and financing student loans.                            Vt. Stat. Ann.\n\ntit.   16,     §   2821(a)      (2013).         According        to    VSAC’s      financial\n\nstatements -– referenced repeatedly in Dr. Oberg’s complaint --\n\nthe agency currently administers a state grant program and a\n\nhigher       education     investment        plan;    originates,         services,         and\n\nguarantees         student      loans;       and     provides         higher       education\n\ninformation and counseling services.\n\n       The    upshot     of    the    first    arm-of-the-state          factor       --    who\n\nwould pay a judgment in this case -– is unclear.                                  State law\n\nprovides no definite guidance.                  On one hand, Dr. Oberg alleges\n\nthat     Vermont       would    not    pay     a    judgment      because       the     state\n\ndisclaims legal liability for VSAC’s debts.                       Yet, in contrast to\n\nPennsylvania,          which   disavows       liability       for      any   and      all   of\n\nPHEAA’s obligations, see 24 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 5104(3), Vermont\n\ndoes so only with respect to VSAC’s debt obligations issued to\n\n                                              19\n\ffinance loans for higher education, see Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 16,\n\n§ 2823(f); id at § 2868(i).           Dr. Oberg has identified no state\n\nlaw indicating that a judgment obligation could not be enforced\n\nagainst the state, and we have found none.                    See Lake Country\n\nEstates, 440 U.S. at 402 (finding relevant whether state law\n\n“provides that obligations of [the entity] shall not be binding\n\non [the] State”).\n\n       On the other hand, VSAC’s contention that Vermont would pay\n\na judgment rests on the state’s duty to “support and maintain”\n\nVSAC.        Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 16, § 2823(a).              But an obligation\n\nstated    in    such    general   terms    is    not    conclusive.     Moreover,\n\nalthough state appropriations compose nearly twenty percent of\n\nVSAC’s revenues, such funding goes entirely to students in the\n\nform    of    need-based    grants.       Thus,    whether    Vermont   would    be\n\nlegally or functionally liable for a judgment here is unclear.\n\nAt this stage, however, we must construe all facts in the light\n\nmost favorable to the plaintiff, Nemet Chevrolet, 591 F.3d at\n\n255, so we assume that this critical (albeit not dispositive)\n\nfirst factor weighs against arm-of-the-state status for VSAC.\n\n       The     second   factor,   VSAC’s       degree   of   autonomy   from    the\n\nstate, also presents a close question.                    Vermont law provides\n\nthat eight members of VSAC’s eleven-member board of directors\n\nare either state officials or gubernatorial appointees, and that\n\nthe board elects the remaining three members.                   Vt. Stat. Ann.\n\n                                          20\n\ftit. 16, § 2831.           Moreover, Vermont retains important oversight\n\nauthority over VSAC.          The state “reserves the right at any time\n\nto    alter,    amend,     repeal    or    otherwise            change    the     structure,\n\norganization, programs, or activities” of VSAC, id. § 2821(b),\n\nand state law provides that VSAC may issue no debt obligation\n\n“without       the     approval     in    writing          of    the     governor,”        id.\n\n§ 2823(f).\n\n       Other autonomy indicators, however, counsel against holding\n\nthat VSAC is an arm of the state.                          VSAC not only exercises\n\ncorporate powers including the capacity to contract and sue and\n\nbe sued, see Cash, 242 F.3d at 225, it is also, like PHEAA,\n\nfinancially      independent.            VSAC’s         financial    statements,       cited\n\nthroughout       the     complaint,       indicate          that     VSAC       uses   state\n\nappropriations only for need-based educational grants; no state\n\nfunds    finance     its   operations.             In    addition,       VSAC’s    board    is\n\nbroadly empowered to adopt policies and regulations governing\n\nits lending activities, Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 16, § 2834, and “to\n\ndo any and all acts and things as may be necessary” to secure\n\nits     debt   obligations,       id.     §        2868(d).         Thus,    although       we\n\nrecognize that certain facts relevant to the autonomy analysis\n\nsuggest that VSAC is an arm of the state, others weigh decidedly\n\nagainst that conclusion.             Once again “draw[ing] all reasonable\n\ninferences in favor of the plaintiff,” Kolon Indus., 637 F.3d at\n\n\n\n                                              21\n\f440, we believe this factor also counsels against holding as a\n\nmatter of law that VSAC is an arm of the state.\n\n       As    to    the   third      factor,      whether      VSAC    is   involved    with\n\nstatewide concerns, Dr. Oberg alleges that this factor weighs\n\nagainst      holding     that       VSAC    is   an    arm    of     the   state    because\n\n“Vermont law allows VSAC to conduct business in other States”\n\nand   the    agency      has    “contracted        with      borrowers     and    companies\n\noutside Vermont.”              But these assertions do not equate to an\n\nallegation        that   VSAC’s      operations       centered       primarily      outside\n\nVermont at any point in time.                    See Ram Ditta, 822 F.2d at 459.\n\nIndeed, Dr. Oberg’s allegations here fall short even of those he\n\noffers as to PHEAA’s extra-state operations, which we have held\n\ndo not rise to the level of establishing a plausible claim of\n\narm-of-the-state status under this factor.                         See Iqbal, 556 U.S.\n\nat    678.        Rather,      VSAC’s      financial      statements       indicate    that\n\nduring the period in question the agency was focused on the\n\nstatewide         concern      of   facilitating          postsecondary         educational\n\nopportunities for residents of Vermont.\n\n       With respect to the fourth factor, how state law treats the\n\nentity, Dr. Oberg alleges that Vermont does not treat VSAC as it\n\ntreats “true agencies of the state.”                         But in fact Vermont law\n\nexpressly provides that VSAC “shall be an instrumentality of the\n\nstate,” Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 16, § 2823(a), exempts VSAC from all\n\ntaxation,     id.     § 2825,       and    “designate[s]        [VSAC]     as    the   state\n\n                                              22\n\fagency to receive federal funds assigned to the state of Vermont\n\nfor student financial aid programs,” id. § 2823(c).\n\n       In sum, although the first and second factors present close\n\nquestions, we must conclude in compliance with Rule 12(b)(6)\n\nthat    both   weigh      against    holding     VSAC     an   arm    of    the    state.\n\nAccordingly,       while     the     third     and      fourth    factors         suggest\n\notherwise, we must also hold that Dr. Oberg’s allegations as to\n\nVSAC are sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.                         This is so\n\nparticularly given the first factor’s enduring importance.                            See\n\nsupra    at    8   n.4.      We     recognize     that     some      of    Dr.    Oberg’s\n\nallegations test the outer bounds of the plausibility standard,\n\nbut at this juncture, we must construe all facts in the light\n\nmost    favorable      to   the     plaintiff.       We    therefore        vacate    the\n\njudgment of the district court with respect to VSAC and remand\n\nto permit limited discovery on this question.\n\n\n\n                                         V.\n\n       Finally,    we     consider     whether    the     Arkansas        Student    Loan\n\nAuthority (“ASLA”) is an arm of the state of Arkansas.                                The\n\nstate legislature created ASLA in 1977 to help Arkansas provide\n\nhigher educational opportunities for its residents.                          Ark. Code\n\nAnn. § 6-81-102 (2013).             ASLA currently originates and disburses\n\nstudent loans at postsecondary schools throughout the state.                           It\n\n\n\n                                         23\n\falso    sponsors      outreach       services         to     increase      awareness          about\n\nfinancial aid in higher education.\n\n        In contrast to PHEAA and VSAC, all four factors weigh in\n\nfavor of holding that ASLA is an arm of the state.                                         First,\n\nalthough § 6-81-113 of the Arkansas Code disavows liability for\n\ndebt    obligations         issued      to      finance      student       loans,       it     says\n\nnothing      about     liability         for        other     debts       like     a    judgment\n\nobligation.          Critically,        Arkansas          statutes       elsewhere      indicate\n\nthat state revenues would be used to satisfy a judgment against\n\nASLA.        State    law    instructs          that       “[a]ll    moneys       received       by\n\n[ASLA]” from its lending operations are “specifically declared\n\nto be cash funds,” and further, that “cash funds” are “revenues\n\nof     the    state.”             Id.      at       §§      6-81-118(a)(1),            19-6-103.\n\nAccordingly, because ASLA’s income derives overwhelmingly from\n\nits    lending    activities,           and     because       such       income    statutorily\n\nbelongs to Arkansas, it follows that the state would foot the\n\nbulk of any judgment against ASLA.                          Dr. Oberg’s allegations to\n\nthe    contrary      establish       only       a    dubious       possibility         that    ASLA\n\ncould    procure      some    “other         income”        with     which    to       satisfy    a\n\njudgment.      See Reply Br. at 14.                   More is required to survive a\n\nmotion to dismiss.           See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.\n\n        The dissent misses the mark in contending that Arkansas’s\n\nstatutory      scheme        is    “similar           in     many     ways       to     that     in\n\nPennsylvania,”        Dissent.       Op.      at     50    n.4,    and    that     state      funds\n\n                                                24\n\fwould not be used to satisfy a judgment against ASLA because,\n\n“in reality,” Arkansas “claims” only ASLA’s “surplus revenues,”\n\nDissent. Op. at 51.         Arkansas does not, “in reality,” “claim”\n\nonly    ASLA’s   “surplus        revenues”     as   revenues    of     the   state.\n\nArkansas law expressly provides that “all moneys” received by\n\nASLA in connection with its lending activities are revenues of\n\nthe state.       Ark. Code Ann. §§ 6-81-118(a)(1), 19-6-103.                     And\n\nArkansas law carefully cabins ASLA’s use of those state revenues\n\nto certain lending costs, id. § 6-81-118(b)-(c), an arrangement\n\nfar    removed    from     the     Pennsylvania      scheme     granting       PHEAA\n\n“discretion[ary]” authority to use its funds for any corporate\n\npurpose, see 24 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 5104(3).\n\n       The dissent also misses the mark in suggesting that our\n\nanalysis here is “directly contrary” to that in Hess v. Port\n\nAuthority    Trans-Hudson        Corp.,    513   U.S.   30    (1994),    for    this\n\ncontention ignores crucial differences between the two cases.\n\nWhile ASLA is a corporation created by a single state to further\n\neducational opportunities in that state, the Port Authority in\n\nHess    is   a   bistate    “Compact       Clause    entity”    with     “diffuse”\n\npolitical accountability.            Id. at 42.         Because Congress must\n\nauthorize the creation of such bistate entities, see U.S. Const.\n\nart. 1, § 10, cl. 3, they “owe their existence to [both] state\n\nand federal sovereigns” and so “lack the tight tie to the people\n\nof one State that an instrument of single State has,” Hess, 513\n\n                                          25\n\fU.S. at 42.      For this reason, the Supreme Court recognizes a\n\n“general approach” for Compact Clause entities, like the Port\n\nAuthority, under which a court will “presume” that they are not\n\narms of the state.          Id. at 43.          (Of course, the Court has\n\nestablished     no    similar    “general     approach”     for    state-created\n\ncorporations like ASLA.)\n\n      Notwithstanding this presumption, and even though no state\n\nappropriated     funds    to     the   Port     Authority     or    claimed    the\n\nAuthority’s income as its revenue, the Authority argued that it\n\nwas an arm of a state because it dedicated some of its surplus\n\nto “public projects which the States themselves might otherwise\n\nfinance.”     Id. at 50.        The Supreme Court had little difficulty\n\nrejecting that argument, noting that because the Authority was a\n\nprofitable Compact Clause entity that retained and controlled\n\nits   income,   the    associated      states   would   not   pay    a   judgment\n\nagainst it.     Id. at 51.      ASLA, by contrast, is “an instrument of\n\na single [s]tate,” id. at 43, and state law expressly provides\n\nthat all of its lending income belongs to that state.                         Thus,\n\nstate funds necessarily would be used to pay a judgment against\n\nASLA.   In sum, Hess does not in any way undermine our holding\n\n\n\n\n                                        26\n\fthat this first factor indicates that ASLA is an arm of the\n\nstate. 6\n\n      As   to   the   second   arm-of-the-state     factor,   ASLA    operates\n\nwith little autonomy from Arkansas despite its corporate powers.\n\nState legislative       records   establish      that,   unlike   Pennsylvania\n\nand   Vermont,    Arkansas     provides    its   student   loan    corporation\n\nsubstantial funding. 7         Moreover, the Arkansas Attorney General\n\n\n      6\n        The dissent disputes this conclusion for two additional\nreasons.    Relying on the principle that the “specific governs\nthe general,” Morales, 504 U.S. at 384, the dissent notes that\nonly general statutory provisions –- not those “exclusively\napplicable to ASLA” -– define “cash funds” as “revenues of the\nstate.”    See Dissent. Op. at 48-49.      But the principle of\nstatutory construction on which the dissent relies applies only\nwhere general and specific statutory provisions conflict, or\nwhere a general provision would render a more specific one\nsuperfluous. See RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank,\n132 S. Ct. 2065, 2071 (2012).     The principle finds no footing\nwhere, as here, specific and general statutory provisions do not\nconflict, but rather go hand in hand.      That is, the specific\nprovision defining ASLA’s revenues as “cash funds” is entirely\nconsistent with the general provision declaring that “cash\nfunds” are revenues of the state.\n     The dissent also posits that “the fact that ASLA’s funds\nare held in a segregated fund outside the state treasury\ncounsels against arm-of-state status.” Dissent. Op. at 49. As\na general rule, we agree that such an arrangement would weigh\nagainst holding that an entity is an arm of its state.       But\nArkansas is an exception to this general rule, because state law\nexpressly declares agency income deposited outside the state\ntreasury to be revenue of the state. Ark. Code Ann. § 19-6-103.\nIn contrast to the dissent’s suggestion, see Dissent. Op. at 50\nn.4, ASLA’s statutory scheme thus operates nothing like that\ngoverning PHEAA.\n      7\n       The dissent unconvincingly suggests that this funding is\nirrelevant to the autonomy inquiry because it derives from\nASLA’s own cash funds. Dissent. Op. at 51, 55. But the source\n(Continued)\n                                      27\n\frepresents ASLA in litigation, including the case at hand, and\n\nstate law limits ASLA’s powers in several significant ways.            For\n\nexample, Arkansas subjects ASLA’s use of cash funds to approval\n\nby the General Assembly, Ark. Code Ann. § 19-4-802, and prevents\n\nits sale of bonds “until the bond issue has the written approval\n\nof the Governor after he or she has received the approval of the\n\nState Board of Finance,” id. § 6-81-108.\n\n       Critically, the Governor of Arkansas also appoints every\n\nmember of ASLA’s board of directors.           See id. § 6-81-102(d).\n\n“The fact that all of [an entity’s] decisionmakers are appointed\n\nby the Governor,” we have recognized, “is a key indicator of\n\nstate control.”     Md. Stadium Auth., 407 F.3d at 264; see also,\n\nHoover, 353 F.3d at 307; Kitchen, 286 F.3d at 185; Cash, 242\n\nF.3d at 225.      The dissent all but ignores this fact, claiming\n\ninstead that ASLA is autonomous because its board members serve\n\nfixed terms and may not be removed at will.          Dissent. Op. at 56.\n\nThis   argument   fails.   Even    where   board   members   serve   fixed\n\nterms,    state   authority   to    appoint    all    of     an   entity’s\n\n\n\nof state funds used to support ASLA’s operations matters not.\nWhat matters is whether an entity’s funds belong to the state.\nSee supra at 25-26. In this case, state law expressly provides\nthat they do.     Every dollar ASLA earns through its lending\nactivities becomes a dollar of state revenue “to be used as\nrequired and to be expended only for such purposes and in such\nmanner as determined by law.” Ark. Code Ann. § 19-6-103. That\nArkansas, in its discretion, returns some of this money to ASLA\nto finance its operations does not change that fact.\n\n\n                                   28\n\fdecisionmakers remains powerful evidence of state control.                                 See\n\nMd. Stadium Auth., 407 F.3d at 258, 264 (stressing importance of\n\npower     to    appoint       although    board     members         “serve     five    year\n\nterms”).        Arkansas law, moreover, is equivocal with respect to\n\nthe    governor’s    removal       power.        Indeed,       it   suggests    that       the\n\ngovernor may remove board members simply by selecting new ones,\n\nas    appointments       to   ASLA’s     board    are    for     four-year     terms       “or\n\nuntil a successor is appointed.”                 Ark. Code Ann. § 6-81-102(e).\n\n        Third, with respect to whether ASLA is focused on state\n\nconcerns, Dr. Oberg merely alleges that Arkansas law “allows\n\nASLA to lend to any qualified borrower nationwide” and that ASLA\n\n“can and has entered into contracts with institutions outside\n\nArkansas.”        The operative question, however, is whether ASLA is\n\nprimarily involved with state concerns.                       See Ram Ditta, 822 F.2d\n\nat 459.        And Dr. Oberg has alleged no facts indicating that ASLA\n\nis not primarily involved with the state concern of helping to\n\nfinance higher education for Arkansas residents.                            The dissent,\n\nwhile    conceding       that    student-loan          financing       facilitates         the\n\nimportant state goal of educating youth, maintains that ASLA is\n\nalso    engaged     in    non-state       concerns       like       “the    servicing       of\n\nfederal    student       loans.”         Dissent.       Op.    at    55.      But     ASLA’s\n\nfederal-loan       servicing     work     did    not    begin       until   2012,     so    is\n\nirrelevant to the question whether ASLA was a “person” within\n\n\n\n                                            29\n\fthe meaning of the FCA from 2002 to 2006 when it allegedly\n\nviolated the Act.\n\n       Fourth, as the dissent agrees, Arkansas law plainly treats\n\nASLA as an arm of the state.               ASLA was established by state law\n\nas “the instrumentality of the state charged with a portion of\n\nthe    responsibility         of     the      state     to     provide       educational\n\nopportunities.”         Ark.    Code    Ann.      §    6-81-102(c).        Its   lending\n\nrevenues are statutorily defined as “revenues of the state,” id.\n\n§§ 6-81-118, 19-6-103, and the Supreme Court of Arkansas has\n\ndescribed ASLA as “a state agency created by . . . the 1977 Acts\n\nof    Arkansas,”     Turner    v.    Woodruff,        689    S.W.2d   527,    528   (Ark.\n\n1985).\n\n       In   short,    we     conclude      that       each    of   the    four   factors\n\ncounsels in favor of holding that ASLA is an arm of the state.\n\nTo be sure, as the dissent points out, arm-of-the-state analysis\n\nis a fact-intensive inquiry often ill suited to judgment on the\n\npleadings.     See Dissent. Op. at 58-59.                   But where, as with ASLA,\n\nthe relevant facts are clear, Rule 12(b)(6) mandates dismissal.\n\nSee, e.g., Stoner, 502 F.3d at 1121-23 (dismissing FCA action on\n\n12(b)(6)     motion);      Adrian,      363     F.3d     at    401-02     (same).      We\n\ntherefore    hold     that    ASLA    is   an     arm    of    Arkansas    and   so   not\n\nsubject to suit under the FCA.\n\n\n\n\n                                           30\n\f                                  VI.\n\n      We affirm the judgment of the district court with respect\n\nto   ASLA.

In my view, plaintiff Jon Oberg’s Fourth\n\nAmended Complaint plausibly alleges that all of the defendant\n\nstudent-loan corporations (together, the “Loan Companies”) are\n\n“persons” against whom an action under the False Claims Act (the\n\n“FCA”) can be maintained.          Whether the Loan Companies qualify as\n\narms of their creating states is an affirmative defense that\n\nneed not be anticipated or negated by the allegations of the\n\ncomplaint, see Goodman v. Praxair, Inc., 494 F.3d 458, 466 (4th\n\nCir. 2007) (en banc), and is a question that cannot be finally\n\nresolved here without discovery and fact-finding by the district\n\ncourt.\n\n     Accordingly,       I     concur    in    that   portion     of    the     judgment\n\nvacating    the    dismissal      of    Oberg’s      False    Claims     Act    claims\n\nasserted    against     the    Pennsylvania      Higher      Education    Assistance\n\nAgency (“PHEAA”) and the Vermont Student Assistance Corporation\n\n(“VSAC”),    but    I   dissent        from    the   dismissal    of     the    claims\n\nasserted against the Arkansas Student Loan Authority (“ASLA”).\n\n\n\n\n                                          32\n\f                                            I.\n\n       “The   purpose      of   a   Rule    12(b)(6)    motion    is    to    test    the\n\nsufficiency       of   a   complaint”;        the    motion    “does    not    resolve\n\ncontests surrounding the facts, the merits of a claim, or the\n\napplicability of defenses.”                Butler v.

Ct. 2398 (2014).\n\n       To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a plaintiff\n\nmust allege facts plausibly establishing the elements of his\n\nasserted cause of action.             See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,\n\n678 (2009); Walters v. McMahen, 684 F.3d 435, 439 (4th Cir.\n\n2012),    cert.     denied,     133    S.     Ct.    1493     (2013).        While    the\n\nplaintiff is not required to “forecast evidence sufficient to\n\nprove the elements of the claim,” he “must allege sufficient\n\nfacts    to   establish     those     elements”      and    “advance    [his]        claim\n\nacross the line from conceivable to plausible.”                         Walters, 684\n\nF.3d     at   439      (internal      quotation        marks    omitted).            When\n\nconsidering a motion to dismiss, we give no deference to legal\n\nconclusions asserted in the complaint, but we must accept all\n\nfactual allegations as true.               See id.\n\n\n\n                                            II.\n\n       Broadly speaking, the False Claims Act imposes liability on\n\na “person” who knowingly presents a false or fraudulent claim\n\n                                            33\n\ffor    payment          or   knowingly            makes    or     uses     a    false          record    or\n\nstatement         material           to      a     false        claim.              See        31   U.S.C.\n\n§ 3729(a)(1)(A)              &   (B).         In    order       to   survive         the       motion    to\n\ndismiss, Oberg was therefore obliged to plead facts plausibly\n\nestablishing that the named defendants are “persons” within the\n\nmeaning of the FCA.\n\n       While states are not “persons” subject to qui tam actions\n\nunder the FCA, see Vt. Agency of Natural Res. v. United States\n\nex    rel.    Stevens,           529      U.S.     765,    787-88        (2000),          corporations,\n\nincluding municipal corporations like cities and counties, are\n\n“persons” under the Act, see Cook Cnty. v. United States ex rel.\n\nChandler, 538 U.S. 119, 134 (2003); see also 1 U.S.C. § 1 (“In\n\ndetermining         the      meaning         of    any     Act     of    Congress,          unless      the\n\ncontext indicates otherwise[,] . . . the word[] ‘person’ . . .\n\ninclude[s] corporations . . . .”).                                There is no dispute that\n\neach of the Loan Companies is a corporation, and Oberg alleged\n\nthe   corporate          status        of    each       Loan     Company       in    his       complaint.\n\nBecause corporations are presumed to be “persons” under the FCA,\n\nChandler,         538    U.S.        at     126,    Oberg’s       allegations             of    corporate\n\nstatus       plausibly           established            that      the     Loan       Companies          are\n\n“persons” within the meaning of the FCA, see Bell Atl. Corp. v.\n\nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (“Factual allegations must be\n\nenough       to    raise         a     right       to     relief        above       the     speculative\n\nlevel.”).\n\n                                                    34\n\f       The    Loan       Companies,         however,      all      contend       that   they   are\n\nalter-egos      or       arms    of   their     creating           states.       The    Companies\n\ntherefore argue that they, like the states themselves, do not\n\nqualify as “persons” under the FCA.                            Arm-of-state status is an\n\nEleventh-Amendment-based inquiry focused on determining whether\n\na state-created entity is so closely related to the state that\n\nit   should         be   permitted       to    share          in   the    state’s       sovereign\n\nimmunity.       See United States ex rel. Oberg v. Ky. Higher Educ.\n\nStudent Loan Corp., 681 F.3d 575, 580 (4th Cir. 2012) (“Oberg\n\nI”).     Although         this    court       has       not   addressed       the    issue,    the\n\ncircuits that have considered similar assertions of arm-of-state\n\nstatus       have     uniformly       concluded          that      it    is   an    affirmative\n\ndefense to be raised and established by the entity claiming to\n\nbe an arm of the state.                     See Sung Park v. Ind. Univ. Sch. of\n\nDentistry,      692       F.3d    828,       830     (7th      Cir.      2012)     (“[S]overeign\n\nimmunity is a waivable affirmative defense.”); Aholelei v. Dep’t\n\nof Pub. Safety, 488 F.3d 1144, 1147 (9th Cir. 2007) (“Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity is an affirmative defense . . . .” (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)); Woods v. Rondout Valley Cent.

Turnpike Comm’n, 54 F.3d 1140, 1144\n\n(3d    Cir.       1995)   (“[T]he    party    asserting   Eleventh      Amendment\n\nimmunity (and standing to benefit from its acceptance) bears the\n\nburden      of    proving    its    applicability.”).      I     believe      these\n\ndecisions were correctly decided and that the arm-of-state issue\n\nraised by the Loan Companies is an affirmative defense. 1\n\n       Preliminarily,        although    a    plaintiff   must     plead      facts\n\nestablishing that the court has jurisdiction over his claim,\n\nsee, e.g., Pinkley, Inc. v. City of Frederick, 191 F.3d 394, 399\n\n(4th       Cir.     1999),   the     arm-of-state     issue      here    is     not\n\njurisdictional.           Instead, as the Supreme Court made clear in\n\nStevens, it is a statutory question of whether the defendants\n\nnamed by Oberg qualify as “persons” under the FCA.                 See Stevens,\n\n529 U.S. at 779 (distinguishing the question whether the FCA\n\n       1\n       In our first opinion, we concluded that the district court\nhad not applied the arm-of-state analysis, and we remanded the\ncase for the district court to apply that analysis in the first\ninstance.   See United States ex rel. Oberg v. Ky. Higher Educ.\nStudent Loan Corp., 681 F.3d 575, 581 (4th Cir. 2012). While we\nnoted that the ultimate question of whether the Loan Companies\nwere subject to suit under the FCA did not turn solely on their\ncorporate status, see id. at 579, we did not consider the\nsufficiency of Oberg’s allegations or address whether arm-of-\nstate status was an affirmative defense.\n\n\n                                         36\n\fpermits      actions     against        states        from      whether    the     Eleventh\n\nAmendment would prohibit such an action and electing to resolve\n\nthe case on statutory grounds).\n\n       Moreover,       the     arm-of-state           claim     operates     like       other\n\naffirmative defenses, in that the claim would preclude liability\n\neven if all of Oberg’s allegations of wrongdoing are true.                                See\n\nEmergency One, Inc. v. Am. Fire Eagle Engine Co., 332 F.3d 264,\n\n271 (4th Cir. 2003) (“[A]ffirmative defenses share the common\n\ncharacteristic of a bar to the right of recovery even if the\n\ngeneral     complaint        were   more   or        less    admitted     to.”    (internal\n\nquotation marks and alteration omitted)); Black’s Law Dictionary\n\n(9th    ed.     2009)        (defining     “affirmative               defense”     as    “[a]\n\ndefendant’s assertion of facts and arguments that, if true, will\n\ndefeat the plaintiff’s or prosecution’s claim, even if all the\n\nallegations in the complaint are true.”).                        In my view, then, the\n\narm-of-state     status        asserted        by    the     Loan     Companies    must    be\n\ntreated as an affirmative defense.                         And once the arm-of-state\n\nissue in this case is recognized as an affirmative defense, the\n\nerror   in    dismissing       Oberg’s     claims          on   the    pleadings    becomes\n\napparent.\n\n       As    noted   above,         a   Rule        12(b)(6)     motion     “test[s]      the\n\nsufficiency of a complaint” but “does not resolve contests . . .\n\n[about] the merits of a claim or the applicability of defenses.”\n\nButler, 702 F.3d at 752 (internal quotation marks omitted).                                A\n\n                                               37\n\fplaintiff   therefore     has   no   “obligation   to   anticipate”   an\n\naffirmative defense by pleading facts that would refute the as-\n\nyet unasserted defense.         Gomez v. Toledo, 446 U.S. 635, 640\n\n(1980); see McMillan v. Jarvis, 332 F.3d 244, 248 (4th Cir.\n\n2003); Guy v. E.I.

Cir. 2013) (“[A]lthough it is certainly\n\ntrue that plaintiffs must plead the elements of their claims\n\nwith specificity, they are not required to negate an affirmative\n\ndefense in their complaint . . . .” (internal quotation marks\n\nand alteration omitted)).\n\n     As our en banc court explained in Goodman, an affirmative\n\ndefense may provide the basis for a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal only\n\n“in the relatively rare circumstances . . . [where] all facts\n\nnecessary to the affirmative defense clearly appear on the face\n\nof the complaint.”      Goodman, 494 F.3d at 464 (internal quotation\n\nmarks and alteration omitted); see also Xechem, Inc. v. Bristol–\n\nMyers Squibb Co., 372 F.3d 899, 901 (7th Cir. 2004) (“Only when\n\nthe plaintiff pleads itself out of court--that is, admits all\n\nthe ingredients of an impenetrable defense--may a complaint that\n\notherwise states a claim be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6).”).\n\n     Application of these principles to this case requires Oberg\n\nto plausibly allege that the Loan Companies are “persons” within\n\nthe meaning of the FCA.         Oberg did just that by alleging that\n\n                                     38\n\fthe Companies are corporations operating independently of their\n\ncreating states.      The Loan Companies’ contrary claim that they\n\nare   alter-egos    of    their    creating      states   is   an    affirmative\n\ndefense   which    they   bear    the   burden    of   pleading     and   proving.\n\nBecause Oberg had no obligation to anticipate that defense by\n\nalleging facts establishing that the multi-factored, factually\n\nintensive arm-of-state inquiry should be resolved in his favor,\n\nthe dismissal of his claims at this stage of the proceedings is\n\nimproper.     See Butler, 702 F.3d at 752; Goodman, 494 F.3d at\n\n464, 466. 2\n\n\n      2\n       The majority’s apparent view that arm-of-state status is\nan affirmative defense in the Eleventh Amendment context but not\nin this case is puzzling.     Although the arm-of-state inquiry\nhere presents a statutory rather than constitutional question,\nthe principles at stake are the same as in any case raising\nEleventh Amendment issues. If arm-of-state status is a waivable\naffirmative defense when the Eleventh Amendment is directly\nimplicated, so too should it be a waivable affirmative defense\nwhen the Eleventh Amendment is indirectly implicated.      While\n“personhood” is clearly an element of a plaintiff’s claim under\nthe FCA, Oberg, as previously discussed, carried his burden of\ndemonstrating the Loan Companies’ personhood by alleging their\nindependent corporate status.   The burden should then fall to\nthe defendants to plead and prove that they are not persons but\nrather are arms of their creating state. United States ex rel.\nAdrian v. Regents of University of California, 363 F.3d 398 (5th\nCir. 2004), the case relied on by the majority, does not suggest\notherwise.   In that case, the plaintiff brought an FCA action\nagainst an entity – the Regents of the University of California\n– that courts had repeatedly found to be an arm of the state.\nSee id. at 401-02.      The Fifth Circuit did not address the\naffirmative-defense issue, but its affirmance of a Rule 12(b)(6)\ndismissal of the claims against an entity previously found to be\nan arm of the state is consistent with the rule recognized by\nthis court in Goodman that an affirmative defense may be\n(Continued)\n                                        39\n\f                                          III.\n\n      Even if Oberg were somehow required to allege that the Loan\n\nCompanies      are    not   arms     of     their       states,       I    believe       the\n\nallegations of the complaint are still more than sufficient to\n\nwithstand the motion to dismiss.\n\n      As to PHEAA and VSAC, the majority concludes that Oberg’s\n\nallegations     plausibly      establish         that    the    companies         are    not\n\nalter-egos of their creating states.                    Although I agree with the\n\nmajority’s ultimate conclusion as to these defendants, I do not\n\nagree   with    the    majority’s     application          of   the       Rule    12(b)(6)\n\nstandard to the arm-of-state state factors.                     The sufficiency of\n\nthe complaint as to PHEAA and VSAC is not a close question in my\n\nview, and I therefore concur only in the judgment vacating the\n\ndismissal of Oberg’s claims against PHEAA and VSAC.                              While the\n\nquestion is perhaps a bit closer as to the claims against ASLA,\n\nI   nonetheless      believe   the   Oberg       has     plausibly        alleged       facts\n\nestablishing that ASLA is not an arm of the state of Arkansas.\n\nAccordingly, for the reasons set out below, I dissent from the\n\nmajority’s affirmance of the Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal of Oberg’s\n\nclaims against ASLA.\n\n\n\n\nresolved on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion when the facts necessary to\nthe defense appear on the face of the complaint.

Doe, 519 U.S. 425, 428 (1997), we must also\n\nconsider the practical effect of a judgment against the entity,\n\nsee   Hess    v.     Port    Auth.    Trans-Hudson       Corp.,    513   U.S.   30,   51\n\n(1994).       “[I]f the State treasury will be called upon to pay a\n\njudgment against a governmental entity, then Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity applies to that entity, and consideration of any other\n\nfactor becomes unnecessary.”                  Cash v. Granville Cnty. Bd. of\n\nEduc.,    242      F.3d     219,   223     (4th   Cir.   2001).        “[S]peculative,\n\n\n                                             41\n\findirect,     and    ancillary        impact[s]     on    the    State    treasury,”\n\nhowever, are insufficient to trigger immunity.                   Id. at 225.\n\n      If the state would not be liable for a judgment rendered\n\nagainst the entity, we must then consider the remaining factors,\n\nwhich serve to determine whether the entity “is so connected to\n\nthe   State   that       the    legal    action    against      the   entity    would,\n\ndespite the fact that the judgment will not be paid from the\n\nState treasury, amount to the indignity of subjecting a State to\n\nthe coercive process of judicial tribunals at the instance of\n\nprivate     parties.”           Id.     at   224   (internal      quotation      marks\n\nomitted); see Fed. Mar. Comm’n v. S.C. State Ports Auth., 535\n\nU.S. 743, 760 (2002) (“The preeminent purpose of state sovereign\n\nimmunity is to accord States the dignity that is consistent with\n\ntheir   status      as   sovereign      entities.”).       In    my   view,    Oberg’s\n\ncomplaint     contains         factually      detailed,    specific      allegations\n\naddressing the treasury factor and the dignity factors so as to\n\npreclude the granting of the motion to dismiss.\n\n                                             A.\n\n      The complaint alleges that ASLA, not its creating state,\n\nwould be liable for any judgment rendered against it.                         See J.A.\n\n116-18.     While that assertion is arguably a legal conclusion not\n\nentitled to be treated as true, see, e.g., Iqbal, 556 U.S. at\n\n678, the assertion is supported by specific factual allegations\n\nthat are supported by statutes, financial reports, and other\n\n                                             42\n\finformation   specifically    referenced       in   the   complaint   and\n\nproperly considered in the context of a motion to dismiss.            See\n\nTellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 322\n\n(2007); Philips v. Pitt Cnty. Mem’l Hosp., 572 F.3d 176, 180\n\n(4th Cir. 2009).      These allegations and information establish\n\nthe following:\n\n          ●    ASLA is a corporation entitled to enter into\n     contracts, own property, and sue and be sued in its own\n     name. See Ark. Code Ann. § 6-81-102(c) (establishing ASLA\n     as a “public body politic and corporate, with corporate\n     succession”).\n\n          ●     Arkansas has specifically disclaimed liability\n     for ASLA’s obligations.     See Ark. Code Ann. § 6-81-\n     113(a)(3).\n\n          ●    Arkansas law authorizes ASLA to pay expenses\n     associated with its lending activities from the revenues\n     earned from those activities. See Ark. Code Ann. §§ 6-81-\n     118(c)(3), 6-81-124(c)(1).\n\n          ●    ASLA generates substantial income streams and\n     relies   on  those  income  streams,   rather  than  state\n     appropriations, to support its business operations, and\n     ASLA has substantial assets from which a judgment could be\n     paid. See J.A 781-827 (ASLA financial statements).\n\n          ●    ASLA has a line of credit provided by Arkansas.\n     ASLA borrowed $50,000,000 under the line of credit in 2008\n     and repaid the note in full by September 2010.     See J.A.\n     802. ASLA has also borrowed money from a private lender to\n     improve its liquidity, with student loan revenues providing\n     the source of repayment. See J.A. 802.\n\n          ●    ASLA has commercial insurance to protect itself\n     from losses arising out of torts and its errors and\n     omissions. See J.A. 805.\n\nIn my view, these allegations are more than sufficient to make\n\nplausible   Oberg’s   assertion   that   the   Arkansas   state   treasury\n\n                                   43\n\fwould not be liable for a judgment rendered against ASLA.                     See\n\nRobertson v. Sea Pines Real Estate Cos., 679 F.3d 278, 288 (4th\n\nCir. 2012) (“Plausibility requires that the factual allegations\n\nbe enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level\n\non the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are\n\ntrue.” (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted)).\n\n     Although     the    majority     considers     ASLA’s    status     as     a\n\ncorporation only when analyzing the state-dignity factors, that\n\nfact is clearly relevant to the state-treasury factor as well.\n\nSee Cash, 242 F.3d at 224 (considering entity’s corporate form\n\nwhen analyzing state-treasury factor).             The fact that Arkansas\n\nelected to structure ASLA as a corporation makes it plausible\n\nthat the state will not be liable for any judgments in this\n\ncase, since insulating others from liability for corporate debt\n\nis one of the signal attributes of the corporate form.                    See,\n\ne.g., Musikiwamba v. ESSI, Inc., 760 F.2d 740, 753 (7th Cir.\n\n1985) (“General corporation law is clear that personal liability\n\nfor a corporation’s debts cannot be imposed on a person merely\n\nbecause he is an officer, shareholder, and incorporator of that\n\ncorporation.”).         That     Arkansas   has   specifically     disclaimed\n\nliability   for         ASLA’s      obligations     further       establishes\n\nplausibility,   particularly        given   the   absence    of   any   statute\n\nrequiring Arkansas to pay a judgment against ASLA.                  See Cash,\n\n242 F.3d at 224-25 (noting the absence of statute authorizing\n\n                                       44\n\frecovery      from   state     coffers        when   concluding      that    judgment\n\nagainst entity would not affect state treasury); Gray v. Laws 51\n\nF.3d 426, 436 (4th Cir. 1995) (noting the absence of statute\n\nrequiring payment by state).\n\n     Moreover,        the    allegations        of    the   complaint       and   the\n\nfinancial documents referenced in the complaint show that ASLA\n\ngenerates significant revenue streams through its lending and\n\nother     business    activities.         ASLA       uses   those     revenues,   as\n\nrequired      by   state    law,   to   pay    the   expenses   of    its    business\n\nactivities.        In light of these revenue streams, ASLA’s ability\n\nto raise revenues through other sources, see J.A. 802 (line of\n\ncredit and private lending available to ASLA), and its insurance\n\nprotection, it is entirely plausible a judgment in this case\n\nwill have no legal or practical effect on the Arkansas state\n\ntreasury.      See Burrus v. State Lottery Comm’n, 546 F.3d 417, 420\n\n(7th Cir. 2008) (concluding that state lottery commission was\n\nnot an arm of the state, in part because the lottery “has no\n\nneed for recourse to the state treasury” given the “large stream\n\nof revenue” it generates).\n\n                                          B.\n\n        The   allegations     of   Oberg’s      complaint    likewise       plausibly\n\ndemonstrate that ASLA has significant autonomy and independence\n\nfrom its creating state.            The allegations of the complaint and\n\nthe documents referenced therein establish the following:\n\n                                          45\n\f            ●    ASLA is a corporation entitled to enter into\n       contracts, own property, and sue and be sued in its own\n       name. See Ark. Code Ann. § 6-81-102(l).\n\n            ●    ASLA is governed by a board of directors, none of\n       whom are state officials, who serve fixed terms and are not\n       removable by the governor. See id. § 6-81-102(d) & (e).\n\n            ●    ASLA has authority to structure and operate                             its\n       business activities as it deems proper, including                                 the\n       authority to issue general obligation bonds secured by                            its\n       revenues and to create subsidiary corporations.    See                            id.\n       §§ 6-81-102(k), 6-81-102(l)(8)-(10) & (25).\n\n            ●    ASLA is supported by the revenues it earns from\n       its business activities, not by the state.  Although ASLA\n       receives appropriations from the state earmarked for\n       salaries and certain operating expenses, the funds so\n       appropriated are “cash funds” earned by ASLA through its\n       business activities.  See Ark. Code Ann. § 6-18-118; J.A.\n       412.\n\n            ●    ASLA’s revenues are not deposited into the state\n       treasury,   but   are  deposited  into   various   accounts\n       controlled by ASLA. See Ark. Stat. § 6-81-118(a) & (f).\n\n               ● ASLA’s business activities extend outside the\n       state of Arkansas and include the buying and selling of\n       loan pools on the secondary market and the servicing of\n       loans made directly by the federal government.\n\n            ●    ASLA has borrowed and repaid money from the state\n       of Arkansas, executing a promissory in favor of the state\n       and using its revenues to repay the loan. See J.A. 802.\n\n       These       allegations      are   not    naked       factual    assertions      that\n\nneed    not        be   accepted     as   true,        nor    are      they     mere   legal\n\nconclusions that can be disregarded.                         See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at\n\n678.    Instead, they are specific, detailed factual allegations\n\nthat   paint        a   plausible    picture      of    an    autonomous        corporation\n\noperating          in   the   commercial        sphere       largely     free     of   state\n\n\n                                            46\n\foversight or interference, such that it would not be an affront\n\nto the dignity of Arkansas to permit this action to proceed.\n\n     Accordingly, given the operational independence established\n\nby these allegations, and the financial independence established\n\nby the state-treasury allegations discussed above, I believe it\n\nis at least plausible that ASLA is a “person” within the meaning\n\nof the FCA, not an arm of the state of Arkansas.     See id. (“A\n\nclaim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual\n\ncontent that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference\n\nthat the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”).\n\n\n\n                               IV.\n\n     ASLA, however, makes various arguments about how a judgment\n\ncould affect the state treasury and points to various statutes\n\nindicating that the state has more control over it than Oberg’s\n\nallegations suggest.   In my view, these arguments do not provide\n\na basis for granting the motion to dismiss.   Even after Twombly\n\nand Iqbal, we still must view the properly alleged facts in the\n\nplaintiff’s favor and must give the plaintiff the benefit of all\n\nreasonable inferences that can be drawn from those facts.      See\n\nE.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Kolon Indus., Inc., 637 F.3d\n\n435, 440 (4th Cir. 2011); see also Sepulveda–Villarini v. Dep’t.\n\nof Educ. of P.R., 628 F.3d 25, 30 (1st Cir. 2010) (Souter, J.)\n\n(“A plausible but inconclusive inference from pleaded facts will\n\n                                47\n\fsurvive a motion to dismiss . . . .”).                    While ASLA’s arguments\n\nare   not   frivolous,   they     are    not    so     conclusive   as    to    render\n\nOberg’s allegations implausible for purposes of Rule 12(b)(6).\n\nSee   Starr   v.   Baca,    652    F.3d        1202,      1216   (9th    Cir.   2011)\n\n(“Plaintiff’s complaint may be dismissed only when defendant’s\n\nplausible     alternative       explanation          is    so    convincing      that\n\nplaintiff’s explanation is implausible.”); Watson Carpet & Floor\n\nCovering, Inc. v. Mohawk Indus., Inc., 648 F.3d 452, 458 (6th\n\nCir. 2011) (“[T]he plausibility of [the defendants’ theory] does\n\nnot render all other reasons implausible.”).\n\n                                         A.\n\n      ASLA argues that a judgment against it would affect the\n\nstate treasury.     Arkansas law requires the revenues from ASLA’s\n\nbusiness activities to be deposited into accounts outside the\n\nstate treasury.     See Ark. Code Ann. § 6-81-118(a), (b) & (f).\n\nUnder provisions of Arkansas law not exclusively applicable to\n\nASLA, all funds required to be deposited somewhere other than\n\nthe state treasury are “‘cash funds’” that are “declared to be\n\nrevenues of the state to be used as required and to be expended\n\nonly for such purposes and in such manner as determined by law.”\n\nArk. Code Ann. § 19-6-103.              Such cash funds must be “budgeted\n\nand proposed expenditures approved by enactments of the General\n\nAssembly.”     Id. § 19-4-802(a).         Relying on these statutes, ASLA\n\ncontends that a judgment against it is, as a practical matter, a\n\n                                         48\n\fjudgment against Arkansas, since all of ASLA’s money is really\n\nthe state’s money under § 19-6-103.\n\n     ASLA’s argument overlooks several important points.               First\n\nof all, as the majority noted in its discussion of PHEAA’s arm-\n\nof-state assertion, the fact that ASLA’s funds are held in a\n\nsegregated fund outside the state treasury counsels against arm-\n\nof-state status.        See Majority Op. at 13-14; see also Burrus,\n\n546 F.3d at 420; Univ. of R.I. v. A.W. Chesterton Co., 2 F.3d\n\n1200,    1210   (1st   Cir.   1993).    Moreover,   unlike   the   generally\n\napplicable      §   19-6-103,   the    statute   specifically      addressing\n\nASLA’s funds does not declare ASLA’s cash funds to be revenues\n\nof the state, see Ark. Code Ann. § 6-18-118, and nothing in § 6-\n\n18-118 appears to subject ASLA’s use of the funds to wholesale\n\ncontrol by the General Assembly. 3          Instead, § 6-18-118 simply\n\nrequires ASLA’s segregated cash funds to be “used as provided in\n\nthis subchapter” – subchapter 1 of Chapter 81 governing student\n\nloans.     Id. § 6-18-118(b) (emphasis added).          Subchapter 1, in\n\nturn, gives ASLA -- not the state legislature -- nearly complete\n\nauthority over the use of its funds, including the authority to\n\npay expenses arising from its lending activities.            See Ark. Code\n\n     3\n       As the majority recognized when considering PHEAA’s claim,\nthe terms of the statute specifically governing ASLA should be\ngiven priority over the generally applicable § 19-6-103.      See\nMorales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S. 374, 384 (1992)\n(“[I]t is a commonplace of statutory construction that the\nspecific governs the general . . . .”).\n\n\n                                       49\n\fAnn. § 6-81-118(c)(3) & (4) (giving ASLA authority to “use the\n\nproceeds of any bond issues, together with any other available\n\nfunds”      for       “[p]aying       incidental    expenses    in   connection     with\n\nloans”          and    “[p]aying       expenses     of    authorizing     and    issuing\n\nbonds”); id. § 6-81-118(f) (“The revenues not deposited into the\n\nState Treasury shall be deposited into an account or accounts\n\nspecified by resolution of the authority and used for carrying\n\nout the provisions of any resolution, indenture securing bonds\n\nof the authority, or other agreement of the authority under this\n\nsubchapter.”);           id.    §     6-81-124(a)    (requiring      “[a]ll     proceeds\n\nderived from a particular obligation” to be deposited into a\n\n“proceeds fund” to be “expended only on approval of [ASLA]”);\n\nid. § 6-81-124(c)(1) (authorizing funds contained in proceeds\n\nfund       to    be    used     for     “payment    of    the   necessary       expenses,\n\nincluding,            without     limitation,       the    costs     of   issuing     the\n\nauthority’s obligations, incurred by the authority in carrying\n\nout its responsibilities under this subchapter”). 4\n\n\n       4\n       Arkansas’ statutory arrangement thus is similar in many\nways to that in Pennsylvania.    Like Arkansas, Pennsylvania law\nappears to treat the Loan Company’s funds as state funds, see 24\nPa. Cons. Stat. § 5104(3) (requiring PHEAA’s funds to be\ndeposited into state treasury), and to require state approval of\nany expenditure of those funds, see 72 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 307,\nbut the statute specifically governing PHEAA’s operation gives\ncontrol of those funds to the company, see 24 Pa. Cons. Stat.\n§ 5104(3); see Majority Op. at 11-13 (describing operation of\nPennsylvania statutes governing PHEAA).        After considering\nPennsylvania’s statutory structure, the majority concluded that\n(Continued)\n                                             50\n\f     More importantly, however, the fact that Arkansas declares\n\nall of ASLA’s cash funds to be state funds does not conclusively\n\nestablish that the Arkansas state treasury would be affected by\n\na judgment against ASLA in this case.      As shown by the relevant\n\nstatutes and other information in the record, the cash funds\n\n“claimed” by the state consist entirely of revenues generated by\n\nASLA’s lending and other business activities.            And because the\n\nexpenses of those business activities must be paid from the cash\n\nfunds, the funds so claimed by the state in reality consist only\n\nof ASLA’s surplus revenues.\n\n     As the Supreme Court has explained, however, the state-\n\ntreasury factor focuses “not on the use of profits or surplus,\n\nbut rather . . . on losses and debts.”         Hess, 513 U.S. at 51\n\n(emphasis   added)).   “If    the   expenditures   of    the   enterprise\n\nexceed receipts, is the State in fact obligated to bear and pay\n\nthe resulting indebtedness of the enterprise?            When the answer\n\nis ‘No’ -- both legally and practically -- then the Eleventh\n\nAmendment’s core concern is not implicated.”       Id.\n\n     The majority’s assertion that the source of the cash funds\n\nclaimed by Arkansas does not matter because Arkansas claims all\n\n\n\n\nthe state-treasury factor “weighs heavily against holding that\nPHEAA is an arm of the state.” Majority Op. at 14. In my view,\nArkansas’ similar statutory scheme also weighs against arm-of-\nstate status.\n\n\n                                    51\n\fof the cash funds as its own, see Majority Op. at 27-28 n.7,\n\nthus seems directly contrary to the Supreme Court’s analysis in\n\nHess.        Under the majority’s view, a self-supporting entity –\n\nthat       is,    an    entity       that    supports     itself    not     through     state\n\nappropriations             but   through      the     revenues    earned     from     its   own\n\ncommercial activities – is dependent on the state as a matter of\n\nlaw    because         a    state    statute        arguably     declares    the      entity’s\n\nprofits to be revenues of the state.                      The Supreme Court raised a\n\nsuspicious eyebrow at such an argument in Hess, see 513 U.S. at\n\n51 n.21 (observing that “[i]t would indeed heighten a mystery of\n\nlegal evolution were we to spread an Eleventh Amendment cover\n\nover an agency that consumes no state revenues but contributes\n\nto the State’s wealth” (internal quotation marks and alteration\n\nomitted)), and the argument is no more persuasive here.\n\n       Oberg’s          allegations         of   a    self-supporting,          commercially\n\ninsured corporation with tens of millions of dollars in annual\n\nrevenue and access to a $50 million line of credit and other\n\nprivate       loans        provide    a     non-speculative       basis     for   concluding\n\nthat       ASLA   would      not     need    Arkansas’s     help    to    pay     a   judgment\n\nrendered against it. 5                Nothing more need be established at this\n\npoint       in    the      proceedings.          See     Twombly,    550     U.S.      at   555\n\n\n       5\n        Indeed, the financial statements referenced in the\npleadings show that ASLA absorbed an operational loss in 2011\nwithout any financial assistance from the state. See J.A. 790.\n\n\n                                                 52\n\f(“Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief\n\nabove    the     speculative       level.”);         Walters,          684     F.3d    at    439\n\n(plaintiff’s allegations must be sufficient to “advance [his]\n\nclaim across the line from conceivable to plausible”).\n\n                                              B.\n\n       The     state-dignity       factors         of    the     arm-of-state           inquiry\n\ninclude (1) “the degree of autonomy exercised by the entity”;\n\n(2)    “whether     the   entity       is    involved      with        state    concerns      as\n\ndistinct from non-state concerns, including local concerns”; and\n\n(3) “how the entity is treated under state law.”                               Oberg I, 681\n\nF.3d at 580.           As previously discussed, I believe that Oberg’s\n\nallegations of a corporate entity that is answerable to boards\n\nof    directors       rather    than    elected          state       officials        and    that\n\noperates largely free of state interference plausibly establish\n\nthat ASLA is not “so connected to the State that the legal\n\naction    against      the     entity    would,         despite      the     fact     that   the\n\njudgment will not be paid from the State treasury, amount to the\n\nindignity      of     subjecting    a    State      to    the     coercive       process       of\n\njudicial tribunals at the instance of private parties.”                                     Cash,\n\n242 F.3d at 224 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       I recognize, however, that other inferences can reasonably\n\nbe    drawn    from    the     information         alleged      in     the   complaint        and\n\ncontained      in   the   record.           Nonetheless,         the    question       at    this\n\nstage of the proceedings is not whether the defendant’s view of\n\n                                              53\n\fthe    issues        is    reasonable,         but     whether       the        plaintiff         has\n\nplausibly alleged an entitlement to relief.                               See, e.g., Butler\n\n702 F.3d at 752 (motion to dismiss “test[s] the sufficiency of a\n\ncomplaint” but “does not resolve contests surrounding the facts,\n\nthe    merits       of     a    claim,    or    the     applicability            of     defenses”\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).                       And in my view, the state-\n\ndignity      factors       do    not    conclusively            establish       that    the       Loan\n\nCompanies are arms of their creating states, notwithstanding the\n\nfact    that    some      of    the    factors       might      reasonably        support         that\n\nconclusion.\n\n       For    example,         Arkansas      appears       to    treat     ASLA    as       a    state\n\nagency.        See Ark. Code Ann. § 6-81-102(c) (describing ASLA an\n\n“an    instrumentality           of    the    state”);          Turner    v.    Woodruff,          689\n\nS.W.2d       527,    528       (Ark.    1985)     (describing            ASLA    as     a       “state\n\nagency”).           While this factor thus points toward a finding of\n\narm-of-state status, whether an entity qualifies as an arm of\n\nits creating state is a matter of federal law, see Regents, 519\n\nU.S. at 429 n.5, and this single factor is not dispositive of\n\nthe inquiry.\n\n       In addition, there can be no dispute that ASLA is involved,\n\nat least in part, in matters of statewide concern.                                “[E]ducating\n\nthe youth” of a state and providing higher education is “clearly\n\nan    area    of    statewide         concern,”      Md.     Stadium      Auth.       v.    Ellerbe\n\nBecket Inc., 407 F.3d 255, 265 (4th Cir. 2005), and making loans\n\n                                                54\n\favailable to students certainly facilitates that goal.                                  However,\n\nASLA is also engaged in other, more commercial activities, such\n\nas the buying and selling of loan pools on the secondary market\n\nand the servicing of federal student loans, that arguably are\n\nmore appropriately characterized as “non-state concerns.”                                      See\n\nHoover      Universal,        535   F.3d    at       307    (considering          “whether    the\n\nentity is involved with statewide, as opposed to local or other\n\nnon-state concerns” (emphasis added)); cf. Fresenius Med. Care\n\nCardiovascular Res., Inc. v. Puerto Rico, 322 F.3d 56, 64 (1st\n\nCir. 2003) (“Not all entities created by states are meant to\n\nshare state sovereignty. . . .                   Some entities may be meant to be\n\ncommercial        enterprises,         viable              and     competitive          in    the\n\nmarketplace in which they operate.”).\n\n       As    to   the    question          of    autonomy,             the     fact   that    ASLA\n\ngenerates      its   own       revenues         and    is        not    dependent      on    state\n\nappropriations is a strong indication of the Loan Companies’\n\noperational independence from the states.                               While ASLA receives\n\nan     appropriation       earmarked        for       salaries           and     certain     other\n\nexpenses, it is an appropriation of ASLA’s own “cash funds,”\n\nJ.A. 412, which, as previously discussed, are funds generated by\n\nASLA     through        its     business         activities.                   That    kind    of\n\nappropriation does not make ASLA dependent on the state.                                      See\n\nBurrus, 546 F.3d at 422 (appropriation of funds generated by\n\nentity claiming arm-of-state status “is of a different kind than\n\n                                                55\n\fthe appropriations we have found to be the mark of a state\n\nagency, namely, those appropriations that come directly from the\n\nstate.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). 6\n\n     Other facts, however, suggest that ASLA is not entirely\n\nautonomous.         For    example,   all       members     of    ASLA’s      board    of\n\ndirectors are appointed by the governor, see Ark. Stat. Ann.\n\n§ 6-81-102(d), a fact that clearly provides some indication of\n\nstate    control.         See   Md.   Stadium         Auth.,     407   F.3d    at     264.\n\nArkansas law, however, provides that the board members serve\n\nfixed    terms,     see    Ark.   Stat.        Ann.    §   6-81-102(e),       with      no\n\nsuggestion that they may be removed by the governor at will. 7\n\nSee Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, 664 (1997) (“The\n\npower to remove officers, we have recognized, is a powerful tool\n\n\n     6\n       In any event, even if ASLA did receive some money from the\nstate, that fact alone would not conclusively establish that\nASLA is dependent on the state.    See, e.g., Kitchen v. Upshaw,\n286 F.3d 179, 184-85 (4th Cir. 2002) (finding that an entity\nthat received some state funding was not an arm of the state);\nCash, 242 F.3d at 224, 226 (same).\n     7\n        According to the majority, the fact that ASLA board\nmembers serve for four years “or until a successor is\nappointed,” Ark. Code § 6-81-102(e), “suggests that the governor\nmay remove board members simply by selecting new ones.”\nMajority Op. at 29 (emphasis added).    It seems highly unlikely\nthat   the   Arkansas legislature   would  hide  removal-at-will\nauthority in a clause that more reasonably seems to authorize\nterms of more than four years in cases where an appointment is\nnot timely made. In any event, an ambiguous statutory scheme is\nfar from sufficient to establish for purposes of a Rule 12(b)(6)\nmotion that ASLA’s board is subject to the direct control of the\ngovernor.\n\n\n                                          56\n\ffor control.”); Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452, 456 n.1 (1997)\n\n(concluding that Board of Police Commissioners was not an arm of\n\nthe state because the state was not responsible for the Board’s\n\nfinancial liabilities and the only form of state control was the\n\ngovernor’s power to appoint four of five Board members); P.R.\n\nPorts Auth. v. Fed. Mar. Comm’n, 531 F.3d 868, 877 (D.C.

Univ. of Wisc. Hosp. & Clinics\n\nAuth.,       402   F.3d     768,      770   (7th     Cir.    2005)    (“[T]he     power   to\n\nappoint is not the power to control.”). 8\n\n       In addition, all bonds issued by ASLA must be approved by\n\nthe    governor,       a    fact      the     majority      finds    significant.         See\n\nMajority       Op.     at        27-28      (including       gubernatorial        approval\n\nrequirement        among     the      facts    establishing         that   ASLA   “operates\n\nwith little autonomy”).                The approval requirement, however, is a\n\nfunction of federal law, which places a ceiling on the volume of\n\n\n       8\n       Contrary to the majority’s characterization of my views, I\ndo not contend that ASLA “is autonomous” because of the manner\nin which its board is appointed, Majority op. at     28 (emphasis\nadded), only that Oberg has alleged specific facts relevant to\nASLA’s autonomy sufficient to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.\nAs I have previously discussed, the fact that other inferences\ncan be drawn from the information in the record does not render\nOberg’s allegations implausible.     See Sepulveda–Villarini v.\nDep’t. of Educ. of P.R., 628 F.3d 25, 30 (1st Cir. 2010)\n(Souter, J.) (“A plausible but inconclusive inference from\npleaded facts will survive a motion to dismiss . . . .”).\n\n\n                                                57\n\fcertain tax-exempt “private activity” bonds (including student\n\nloan bonds) that can be issued within a state and vests with the\n\nstate governor the authority to change the allocation of the\n\nstate ceiling among issuers, and which requires state approval\n\nof   such     bond   issues.     See    26    U.S.C.    §     141(e)(1)(E);   id.\n\n§ 144(b); id. § 146(a)-(e); id. § 147(f); see generally Steele\n\nv. Indus. Dev. Bd. of Metro. Gov’t Nashville, 301 F.3d 401, 404\n\n(6th   Cir.     2002);   Congressional       Research    Service,     Tax-Exempt\n\nBonds: A Description of State & Local Government Debt at 9-11\n\n(June 19, 2012).         Under these circumstances, the gubernatorial-\n\napproval requirement is less indicative of a lack of autonomy\n\nthan it might otherwise be.            In any event, the gubernatorial-\n\napproval requirement does not conclusively establish that ASLA\n\nlacks autonomy.\n\n       Thus, on the record before us, the facts relevant to the\n\nstate-dignity        factors   cut    both   ways,     with    some   supporting\n\nOberg’s claim that ASLA is not an arm of the state, and others\n\nsupporting      ASLA’s     contrary     claim.         But     because   Oberg’s\n\nallegations on this point more than satisfy the Iqbal-Twombly\n\nplausibility requirement, ASLA’s arguments provide no basis for\n\naffirming the dismissal of Oberg’s claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                        58\n\f                                          V.\n\n      As is apparent from the arm-of-state test itself and the\n\nnature of the considerations it entails, whether a state-created\n\nentity is so closely connected to its creating state that it\n\nshould be permitted to share in the state’s immunity from suit\n\ngenerally      is    a    fact-intensive          inquiry       dependent        on     an\n\nunderstanding of the actual operations of the entity and the\n\nactual relationship        between       the    entity    and    the    state.        See,\n\ne.g.,    Hess,      513   U.S.      at     49     (considering          the     entity’s\n\n“anticipated        and   actual        financial        independence         (emphasis\n\nadded)); Hoover, 535 F.3d at 303 (“The line separating a State-\n\ncreated entity functioning independently of the State from a\n\nState-created entity functioning as an arm of the State or its\n\nalter    ego   is   determined     by    the    particular       legal    and    factual\n\ncircumstances of the entity itself.” (emphasis added)); Gray, 51\n\nF.3d at 434 (remanding case to the district court because it was\n\n“in   the   best    position   to    address      in     the    first    instance      the\n\ncompeting questions of fact and state law necessary to resolve\n\nthe     eleventh     amendment      issue”        (internal       quotation        marks\n\nomitted)).     While there certainly have been and will continue to\n\nbe cases where the arm-of-state issue can be resolved on the\n\npleadings, multi-factored balancing tests “do[] not easily lend\n\n[themselves] to dismissal on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.”                           Decotiis\n\nv.

In my\n\n                                          59\n\fview, this case is one of the typical cases that cannot be\n\nresolved on the pleadings.              Indeed, the inconclusive nature of\n\nmost of the state-dignity factors highlights this very problem.\n\nWe have no information about the actual operations of the Loan\n\nCompanies   or     the     actual    amount      of   control     and     oversight\n\nexercised by the states and thus cannot determine the actual\n\nnature of the relationship between the Loan Companies and their\n\ncreating states.\n\n      Nonetheless,       the    facts    as     alleged    by    Oberg    plausibly\n\nestablish that the state treasuries will not be affected by a\n\njudgment against the Loan Companies and that the Loan Companies\n\nare   sufficiently   independent         from    their    creating     states     that\n\npermitting this action to proceed would not be an affront to the\n\ndignity of the states.           To require anything more at this stage\n\nof the proceedings is to ignore the purpose and scope of a\n\nmotion to dismiss, which is to test the facial sufficiency of\n\nthe   complaint,     not       resolve    contests       about   the     merits    or\n\napplicable defenses.           See Butler, 702 F.3d at 752; Goodman, 494\n\nF.3d at 464.\n\n      Accordingly, while I concur in the judgment insofar as it\n\nvacates the dismissal of the claims against PHEAA and VSAC, I\n\ndissent from the opinion and judgment affirming the dismissal of\n\nthe claims against ASLA.\n\n\n\n                                         60\n\f",

Dr. Jon Oberg, as relator for the United States, brought\n\nthis action against certain student loan corporations, alleging\n\nthat they defrauded the Department of Education and so violated\n\nthe False Claims Act (“FCA” or “the Act”), 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729 et\n\nseq.     (2006).            The   district      court       initially       dismissed     the\n\ncomplaint in its entirety.                    When Dr. Oberg appealed, we held\n\nthat the court had not employed the proper legal framework --\n\nthe arm-of-the-state analysis -- in reaching its conclusion and\n\nthus vacated its judgment and remanded the case.                              See U.S. ex\n\nrel. Oberg v. Ky. Higher Educ.

After applying the arm-of-\n\nthe-state analysis on remand, the district court again concluded\n\nthat    all      of   the    student     loan       corporations      constituted       state\n\nagencies not subject to suit under the Act and so again granted\n\ntheir    motions       to    dismiss.         For    the    reasons    that    follow,     we\n\naffirm      in      part,     vacate     in     part,      and     remand     for   further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n                                               I.\n\n       On   behalf      of      the   United    States,      Dr.    Oberg    brought      this\n\naction      against       the     Pennsylvania        Higher     Education      Assistance\n\nAgency,       the     Vermont     Student      Assistance        Corporation,       and   the\n\n                                                3\n\fArkansas     Student        Loan    Authority          (collectively      “appellees”).\n\nAppellees are corporate entities established by their respective\n\nstates to improve access to higher education by originating,\n\nfinancing, and guaranteeing student loans. 1\n\n     Dr. Oberg alleges that appellees defrauded the Department\n\nof Education by submitting false claims for Special Allowance\n\nPayments     (“SAP”),       a     generous    federal        student      loan      interest\n\nsubsidy.         According         to   Dr.       Oberg,     appellees         engaged   in\n\nnoneconomic sham transactions to inflate their loan portfolios\n\neligible    for      SAP,    and    the   Department         of   Education         overpaid\n\nhundreds of millions of dollars to appellees as a result of the\n\nscheme.     Dr. Oberg alleges that appellees violated the FCA when\n\nthey knowingly submitted these false SAP claims.\n\n     The FCA provides a cause of action against “any person” who\n\nengages    in     certain       fraudulent        conduct,     including        “knowingly\n\npresent[ing],        or     caus[ing]        to     be     presented,      a     false   or\n\nfraudulent      claim       for    payment        or     approval”   to    an       officer,\n\nemployee,       or    agent        of   the       United     States.           31     U.S.C.\n\n§ 3729(a)(1)(A).          The Act does not define the term “person.”                     In\n\nVermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States, ex rel.\n\n\n     1\n       Dr. Oberg also sued other defendants not parties to this\nappeal.    Among those defendants was another student loan\ncorporation,   the  Kentucky   Higher  Education  Student  Loan\nCorporation, which reached a settlement with Dr. Oberg shortly\nbefore the most recent appeal.\n\n\n                                              4\n\fStevens, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118368\"><a href=\"/opinion/118368/vermont-agency-of-natural-resources-v-united-states-ex-rel-stevens/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 787-88 (2000), the Supreme Court held\n\nthat a state or state agency does not constitute a “person”\n\nsubject to liability under the Act.                 But the Court also noted\n\nthat corporations, by contrast, are “presumptively covered by\n\nthe term ‘person.’”            Id. at 782 (emphasis in original).               And\n\nthree years later, the Court applied the latter presumption and\n\nheld       that   municipal    corporations      like   counties    are    ‘persons’\n\nsubject to suit under the FCA.

Id. at 579-80.       Because the district court\n\nhad not undertaken this analysis, we vacated its judgment and\n\n       2\n       Dr. Oberg insists that only one presumption applies: that\nall corporate entities -- regardless of their affiliation with a\nstate -- must overcome a “presumption of ‘personhood.’”\nAppellant’s Br. 15.   The dissent seems to agree.    See Dissent.\nOp. at 34. But this assertion ignores the Supreme Court’s clear\ninstruction that in the context of corporations created by and\nsponsored by a state, competing presumptions are at play.     See\nStevens, 529 U.S. at 782 (observing that “the presumption with\nregard to corporations is just the opposite of the one governing\n[state entities]”).\n\n\n                                           5\n\fremanded the case to the district court for application of the\n\nproper legal framework.            Id. at 581.\n\n       On   remand,      after    applying       the    arm-of-the-state       analysis,\n\nthe district court concluded that each appellee is part of its\n\nrespective state and thus not a “person” under the Act, and so\n\nagain granted appellees’ motions to dismiss pursuant to Fed.

See Hoover\n\nUniversal,      535    F.3d     at    307    (characterizing            this     factor    as\n\n                                             10\n\f“whether the entity is involved with statewide, as opposed to\n\nlocal or other non-state concerns”) (emphasis added).\n\n      Fourth, we look to “how the entity is treated under state\n\nlaw, such as whether the entity’s relationship with the State is\n\nsufficiently close to make the entity an arm of the State.”\n\nOberg I, 681 F.3d at 580 (quoting Hoover Universal, 535 F.3d at\n\n303).      Whether an entity is an arm of the state is ultimately a\n\nquestion of federal law, “[b]ut that federal question can be\n\nanswered only after considering the provisions of state law that\n\ndefine the agency’s character.”              Regents, 519 U.S. at 429 n.5.\n\n“In   addressing      this   factor,    a    court   may    consider   both   the\n\nrelevant      state     statutes,      regulations,        and   constitutional\n\nprovisions which characterize the entity, and the holdings of\n\nstate courts on the question.”               Md. Stadium Auth., 407 F.3d at\n\n265 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      With these principles in mind, we now apply arm-of-the-\n\nstate analysis to each of the appellees.\n\n\n\n                                       III.\n\n      We    initially    consider   the      Pennsylvania    Higher    Education\n\nAssistance Agency (“PHEAA”).           In 1963, the Pennsylvania General\n\nAssembly created PHEAA, which, according to PHEAA itself, now\n\nconstitutes one of the nation’s largest providers of student\n\nfinancial aid services.         Although PHEAA continues to administer\n\n                                        11\n\fstate-funded      student         aid     programs         in      Pennsylvania,       it\n\nacknowledges that it also operates nationally under the names\n\nAmerican Education Services and FedLoan Servicing.\n\n      The first factor in the arm-of-the-state analysis, whether\n\nPennsylvania would pay a judgment against PHEAA in this case,\n\nweighs decidedly against holding that PHEAA is an arm of the\n\nstate.     For    “instead     of       the    state      treasury    being    directly\n\nresponsible for judgments against [PHEAA], [state law] expressly\n\nprovides that obligations of [PHEAA] shall not be binding on\n\n[the] State.”      Lake Country Estates, 440 U.S. at 402 (emphasis\n\nin original).          Pennsylvania explicitly disavows liability for\n\nall of PHEAA’s debts.           See 24 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 5104(3)(2012)\n\n(“no obligation of the agency shall be a debt of the State”).\n\nIn addition, state law emphasizes that PHEAA’s debts are not\n\n“payable out of any moneys except those of the corporation.”\n\nId.      Aside   from     state     appropriations          that     go   directly     to\n\nstudents   in    the    form   of   education          grants,     moreover,     PHEAA’s\n\nsubstantial “moneys” derive exclusively from its own operations.\n\nThe   Pennsylvania        treasury        is       thus     neither       legally     nor\n\nfunctionally liable for any judgment against PHEAA.                        See Stoner,\n\n502 F.3d at 1122.\n\n      Nevertheless,       PHEAA     contends        that     the     important      first\n\nfactor weighs in favor of concluding that it is an arm of the\n\nstate because state statutes require that its funds be deposited\n\n                                              12\n\finto the state treasury and that “no money” be paid from the\n\ntreasury without approval from the state treasurer.                     See 24 Pa.\n\nCons. Stat. § 5104(3); 72 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 307 (2013).                            This\n\nargument,     however,       ignores       “a    commonplace      of        statutory\n\nconstruction that the specific governs the general.”                    Morales v.\n\nTrans World Airlines, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112742\"><a href=\"/opinion/112742/morales-v-trans-world-airlines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 384 (1992).                      The statutory\n\nprovisions    specifically     outlining        PHEAA’s    “powers     and    duties”\n\nclearly indicate      that    PHEAA’s      board    of    directors    -–    not   the\n\nstate   treasurer    -–    controls     PHEAA’s      funds.      Those       statutes\n\nprovide that PHEAA’s funds “shall be available to the agency”\n\nand “may be utilized at the discretion of the board of directors\n\nfor carrying out any of the corporate purposes of the agency.”\n\n24 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 5104(3).              Further, the state treasurer may\n\nuse PHEAA’s funds only for purposes “consistent with guidelines\n\napproved by the board of directors.”               Id.\n\n     Moreover, PHEAA’s funds are held in a segregated account\n\napart from general state funds.                 Id. § 5105.10.          Our sister\n\ncircuits     have   recognized      that     such    an   arrangement        counsels\n\nagainst establishing arm-of-the-state status under this factor.\n\nThe First Circuit, for instance, held that the University of\n\nRhode Island is not an arm of its state in part because its\n\nfunds are not “merged with[] the general fund, but are kept in\n\nsegregated      accounts      [in      the       state      treasury]         pending\n\ndiscretionary disbursement by the [University’s] Board.”                       Univ.\n\n                                        13\n\fof R.I. v.

Similarly, the Third Circuit, in assessing whether the\n\nPublic School Employees’ Retirement Board of Pennsylvania was an\n\narm of the state, remanded the case for further consideration in\n\npart because -– like PHEEA’s account -- the entity’s fund was\n\n“set apart in the state treasury from general state funds and []\n\nadministered by the State Treasurer at the discretion of the\n\nBoard.”       Blake v. Kline, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"373414\"><a href=\"/opinion/373414/blake-margaret-anne-a-minor-by-blake-james-her-guardian-v-kline/\"><span class=\"volume\">612</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">718</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 723 (3d. Cir. 1979)\n\n(footnote and citations omitted).          In sum, because state law\n\ninstructs that PHEAA would pay any judgment in this case with\n\nits own moneys from its segregated fund, see 24 Pa. Cons. Stat.\n\n§ 5104(3)(2012), the first factor weighs heavily against holding\n\nthat PHEAA is an arm of the state.\n\n      The second factor, the degree of autonomy exercised by the\n\nentity, presents a closer question.         PHEAA’s board of directors\n\nis composed of gubernatorial appointees and state legislators or\n\nofficials.      See 24 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 5103 (repealed July 2010,\n\nbut effective during the period when PHEAA allegedly violated\n\nthe   FCA).      Such   an   arrangement   frequently   indicates   state\n\ncontrol.      See Md. Stadium Auth., 407 F.3d at 264.           Further,\n\nstate officials exercise some degree of veto power over PHEAA’s\n\noperations.     For example, the Auditor General may review PHEAA’s\n\nactivities, 24 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 5108, and PHEAA must seek the\n\napproval of the Governor in order to issue notes and bonds, id.\n\n                                    14\n\f§ 5104(3).         These factors may mean, as PHEAA contends, that it\n\nis simply a tool of the state.\n\n      But   other     indicia      relevant    to   the    autonomy       analysis    --\n\nPHEAA’s     source     of    funding,     control    over    its    revenues,        and\n\ncorporate powers –- strongly suggest that PHEAA is not an arm of\n\nthe state.         Most critically, PHEAA is financially independent.\n\nAccording     to    its   annual    reports,    which     were    attached     to    the\n\namended complaint, PHEAA receives no operational funding from\n\nPennsylvania.        See also Appellees’ Br. 53 (conceding the point).\n\nPennsylvania       law,     moreover,    expressly      instructs     that    PHEAA’s\n\nfunds “shall be available to the agency,” and that PHEAA’s board\n\nmay use those funds in any manner that furthers the agency’s\n\ncorporate purposes.           24 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 5104(3).                Meanwhile,\n\nthe   state    treasurer’s       use    of    PHEAA’s     funds    must    adhere     to\n\n“guidelines approved by the board” of PHEAA.                        Id.      Finally,\n\nPHEAA has the power to enter into contracts, sue and be sued,\n\nand purchase and sell property in its own name, all of which\n\nsuggest operational autonomy.                See Cash, 242 F.3d at 225; Ram\n\nDitta, 822 F.2d at 458.                Although the facts relevant to this\n\nsecond factor cut both ways, when we consider “all reasonable\n\ninferences in favor of the plaintiff” as we must at this stage,\n\nKolon Indus., 637 F.3d at 440, we conclude that this factor also\n\ncounsels against holding that PHEAA is an arm of the state.\n\n\n\n                                          15\n\f      The   third        factor      is    whether      PHEAA     “is     involved     with\n\nstatewide, as opposed to local or other non-state concerns.”\n\nHoover    Universal,          535   F.3d     at   307.      Dr.     Oberg      poses    two\n\narguments relevant to this factor.\n\n      Initially,         he    contends      that    due   to     PHEAA’s      commercial\n\nfocus, its operations do not involve an area of legitimate state\n\nconcern.      See        Appellant’s       Br.    43;    Reply    Br.     25-26.       This\n\nargument fails.           Pennsylvania created PHEAA to finance, make,\n\nand     guarantee        loans      for    higher       education,       and   “[h]igher\n\neducation    is     an    area      of    quintessential        state    concern     and    a\n\ntraditional state government function.”                     Md. Stadium Auth., 407\n\nF.3d at 265.        PHEAA does not provide higher education directly,\n\nbut it nonetheless facilitates the attainment of education by\n\nsupplying student financial aid services.                       This work is clearly\n\nof legitimate state concern.\n\n      Dr. Oberg’s remaining argument as to the third factor is\n\nthat PHEAA’s operations from 2002 to 2006 -- during the time in\n\nwhich     PHEAA   allegedly          conducted       fraudulent         transactions       in\n\nviolation of the FCA -- were so focused out of state that PHEAA\n\nwas not involved primarily with state concerns. 5                        See Ram Ditta,\n\n\n\n      5\n       PHEAA counters that out-of-state operations are irrelevant\nbecause this factor is concerned only with whether an entity’s\nfocus is statewide as opposed to local.         The argument is\nmisguided. Rather, this factor looks to “whether the entity is\n(Continued)\n                                             16\n\f822 F.2d at 459; cf. Hoover Universal, 535 F.3d at 307.                         To this\n\nend,     Dr.   Oberg      alleges     that     “PHEAA        conducts       substantial\n\noperations outside of Pennsylvania,” and that as early as 2005,\n\n“one-third     of       PHEAA’s     earnings        c[a]me        from     outside   the\n\n[C]ommonwealth,”         after      which      it     further            “expanded   its\n\noperations.”        PHEAA’s financial reports, cited throughout Dr.\n\nOberg’s complaint, tend to corroborate these claims, so there is\n\nlittle    doubt     that    during     the     period        in    question     PHEAA’s\n\noperations     extended     well    beyond     the    borders       of     Pennsylvania.\n\nEven so, if only one-third of PHEAA’s earnings came from outside\n\nPennsylvania in 2005, it does not seem plausible that by 2006 --\n\nthe last year encompassed by Dr. Oberg’s allegations -– PHEAA’s\n\noperations focused primarily out of state.                        See Ram Ditta, 822\n\nF.2d at 459; see also Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (explaining that\n\n“[w]here a complaint pleads facts that are merely consistent\n\nwith a defendant’s liability, it stops short of the line between\n\npossibility       and     plausibility        of     entitlement           to   relief”)\n\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).                          Therefore, we\n\nbelieve this factor weighs in favor of arm-of-the-state status\n\nfor PHEAA.\n\n\n\n\ninvolved with statewide, as opposed to local or other non-state\nconcerns.” Hoover Universal, 535 F.3d at 307 (emphasis added).\n\n\n                                         17\n\f       The final factor, how PHEAA is treated under state law,\n\nalso    supports         PHEAA’s       contention            that    it         is    an    arm     of\n\nPennsylvania.           A state statute provides that “the creation of\n\nthe    agency      [was]      in      all    respects        for     the    benefit         of    the\n\npeople . . . and the agency [performs] an essential governmental\n\nfunction.”         24     Pa.      Cons.     Stat.     § 5105.6.            PHEAA’s         enabling\n\nlegislation was made effective by “amendment to the Constitution\n\nof     Pennsylvania           authorizing           grants      or     loans          for    higher\n\neducation,”        id.     § 5112,         and    Pennsylvania            state      courts       have\n\nconcluded        that     PHEAA       is    a    state      agency     for       jurisdictional\n\npurposes, see, e.g., Richmond v.

At this\n\nearly stage, construing the facts in the light most favorable to\n\nthe    plaintiff,         Nemet       Chevrolet,          591   F.3d       at     255,      we    must\n\nconclude that Dr. Oberg has alleged sufficient facts that PHEAA\n\nis    not   an   arm     of     the    state,       but     rather    a    “person”         for   FCA\n\npurposes.         We     therefore         vacate     the    judgment       of       the    district\n\ncourt as to PHEAA and remand to permit limited discovery on the\n\nquestion whether PHEAA is “truly subject to sufficient state\n\n\n\n                                                 18\n\fcontrol to render [it] a part of the state.”                           Oberg I, 681 F.3d\n\nat 579.\n\n\n\n                                              IV.\n\n       We next consider whether Dr. Oberg’s complaint states a\n\nplausible claim that the Vermont Student Assistance Corporation\n\n(“VSAC”) is a “person” subject to suit under the FCA.

According        to    VSAC’s      financial\n\nstatements -– referenced repeatedly in Dr. Oberg’s complaint --\n\nthe agency currently administers a state grant program and a\n\nhigher       education     investment        plan;    originates,         services,         and\n\nguarantees         student      loans;       and     provides         higher       education\n\ninformation and counseling services.\n\n       The    upshot     of    the    first    arm-of-the-state          factor       --    who\n\nwould pay a judgment in this case -– is unclear.                                  State law\n\nprovides no definite guidance.                  On one hand, Dr. Oberg alleges\n\nthat     Vermont       would    not    pay     a    judgment      because       the     state\n\ndisclaims legal liability for VSAC’s debts.                       Yet, in contrast to\n\nPennsylvania,          which   disavows       liability       for      any   and      all   of\n\nPHEAA’s obligations, see 24 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 5104(3), Vermont\n\ndoes so only with respect to VSAC’s debt obligations issued to\n\n                                              19\n\ffinance loans for higher education, see Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 16,\n\n§ 2823(f); id at § 2868(i).           Dr. Oberg has identified no state\n\nlaw indicating that a judgment obligation could not be enforced\n\nagainst the state, and we have found none.                    See Lake Country\n\nEstates, 440 U.S. at 402 (finding relevant whether state law\n\n“provides that obligations of [the entity] shall not be binding\n\non [the] State”).\n\n       On the other hand, VSAC’s contention that Vermont would pay\n\na judgment rests on the state’s duty to “support and maintain”\n\nVSAC.        Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 16, § 2823(a).              But an obligation\n\nstated    in    such    general   terms    is    not    conclusive.     Moreover,\n\nalthough state appropriations compose nearly twenty percent of\n\nVSAC’s revenues, such funding goes entirely to students in the\n\nform    of    need-based    grants.       Thus,    whether    Vermont   would    be\n\nlegally or functionally liable for a judgment here is unclear.\n\nAt this stage, however, we must construe all facts in the light\n\nmost favorable to the plaintiff, Nemet Chevrolet, 591 F.3d at\n\n255, so we assume that this critical (albeit not dispositive)\n\nfirst factor weighs against arm-of-the-state status for VSAC.\n\n       The     second   factor,   VSAC’s       degree   of   autonomy   from    the\n\nstate, also presents a close question.                    Vermont law provides\n\nthat eight members of VSAC’s eleven-member board of directors\n\nare either state officials or gubernatorial appointees, and that\n\nthe board elects the remaining three members.                   Vt. Stat. Ann.\n\n                                          20\n\ftit. 16, § 2831.           Moreover, Vermont retains important oversight\n\nauthority over VSAC.          The state “reserves the right at any time\n\nto    alter,    amend,     repeal    or    otherwise            change    the     structure,\n\norganization, programs, or activities” of VSAC, id. § 2821(b),\n\nand state law provides that VSAC may issue no debt obligation\n\n“without       the     approval     in    writing          of    the     governor,”        id.\n\n§ 2823(f).\n\n       Other autonomy indicators, however, counsel against holding\n\nthat VSAC is an arm of the state.                          VSAC not only exercises\n\ncorporate powers including the capacity to contract and sue and\n\nbe sued, see Cash, 242 F.3d at 225, it is also, like PHEAA,\n\nfinancially      independent.            VSAC’s         financial    statements,       cited\n\nthroughout       the     complaint,       indicate          that     VSAC       uses   state\n\nappropriations only for need-based educational grants; no state\n\nfunds    finance     its   operations.             In    addition,       VSAC’s    board    is\n\nbroadly empowered to adopt policies and regulations governing\n\nits lending activities, Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 16, § 2834, and “to\n\ndo any and all acts and things as may be necessary” to secure\n\nits     debt   obligations,       id.     §        2868(d).         Thus,    although       we\n\nrecognize that certain facts relevant to the autonomy analysis\n\nsuggest that VSAC is an arm of the state, others weigh decidedly\n\nagainst that conclusion.             Once again “draw[ing] all reasonable\n\ninferences in favor of the plaintiff,” Kolon Indus., 637 F.3d at\n\n\n\n                                              21\n\f440, we believe this factor also counsels against holding as a\n\nmatter of law that VSAC is an arm of the state.\n\n       As    to    the   third      factor,      whether      VSAC    is   involved    with\n\nstatewide concerns, Dr. Oberg alleges that this factor weighs\n\nagainst      holding     that       VSAC    is   an    arm    of     the   state    because\n\n“Vermont law allows VSAC to conduct business in other States”\n\nand   the    agency      has    “contracted        with      borrowers     and    companies\n\noutside Vermont.”              But these assertions do not equate to an\n\nallegation        that   VSAC’s      operations       centered       primarily      outside\n\nVermont at any point in time.                    See Ram Ditta, 822 F.2d at 459.\n\nIndeed, Dr. Oberg’s allegations here fall short even of those he\n\noffers as to PHEAA’s extra-state operations, which we have held\n\ndo not rise to the level of establishing a plausible claim of\n\narm-of-the-state status under this factor.                         See Iqbal, 556 U.S.\n\nat    678.        Rather,      VSAC’s      financial      statements       indicate    that\n\nduring the period in question the agency was focused on the\n\nstatewide         concern      of   facilitating          postsecondary         educational\n\nopportunities for residents of Vermont.\n\n       With respect to the fourth factor, how state law treats the\n\nentity, Dr. Oberg alleges that Vermont does not treat VSAC as it\n\ntreats “true agencies of the state.”                         But in fact Vermont law\n\nexpressly provides that VSAC “shall be an instrumentality of the\n\nstate,” Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 16, § 2823(a), exempts VSAC from all\n\ntaxation,     id.     § 2825,       and    “designate[s]        [VSAC]     as    the   state\n\n                                              22\n\fagency to receive federal funds assigned to the state of Vermont\n\nfor student financial aid programs,” id. § 2823(c).\n\n       In sum, although the first and second factors present close\n\nquestions, we must conclude in compliance with Rule 12(b)(6)\n\nthat    both   weigh      against    holding     VSAC     an   arm    of    the    state.\n\nAccordingly,       while     the     third     and      fourth    factors         suggest\n\notherwise, we must also hold that Dr. Oberg’s allegations as to\n\nVSAC are sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.                         This is so\n\nparticularly given the first factor’s enduring importance.                            See\n\nsupra    at    8   n.4.      We     recognize     that     some      of    Dr.    Oberg’s\n\nallegations test the outer bounds of the plausibility standard,\n\nbut at this juncture, we must construe all facts in the light\n\nmost    favorable      to   the     plaintiff.       We    therefore        vacate    the\n\njudgment of the district court with respect to VSAC and remand\n\nto permit limited discovery on this question.\n\n\n\n                                         V.\n\n       Finally,    we     consider     whether    the     Arkansas        Student    Loan\n\nAuthority (“ASLA”) is an arm of the state of Arkansas.                                The\n\nstate legislature created ASLA in 1977 to help Arkansas provide\n\nhigher educational opportunities for its residents.                          Ark. Code\n\nAnn. § 6-81-102 (2013).             ASLA currently originates and disburses\n\nstudent loans at postsecondary schools throughout the state.                           It\n\n\n\n                                         23\n\falso    sponsors      outreach       services         to     increase      awareness          about\n\nfinancial aid in higher education.\n\n        In contrast to PHEAA and VSAC, all four factors weigh in\n\nfavor of holding that ASLA is an arm of the state.                                         First,\n\nalthough § 6-81-113 of the Arkansas Code disavows liability for\n\ndebt    obligations         issued      to      finance      student       loans,       it     says\n\nnothing      about     liability         for        other     debts       like     a    judgment\n\nobligation.          Critically,        Arkansas          statutes       elsewhere      indicate\n\nthat state revenues would be used to satisfy a judgment against\n\nASLA.        State    law    instructs          that       “[a]ll    moneys       received       by\n\n[ASLA]” from its lending operations are “specifically declared\n\nto be cash funds,” and further, that “cash funds” are “revenues\n\nof     the    state.”             Id.      at       §§      6-81-118(a)(1),            19-6-103.\n\nAccordingly, because ASLA’s income derives overwhelmingly from\n\nits    lending    activities,           and     because       such       income    statutorily\n\nbelongs to Arkansas, it follows that the state would foot the\n\nbulk of any judgment against ASLA.                          Dr. Oberg’s allegations to\n\nthe    contrary      establish       only       a    dubious       possibility         that    ASLA\n\ncould    procure      some    “other         income”        with     which    to       satisfy    a\n\njudgment.      See Reply Br. at 14.                   More is required to survive a\n\nmotion to dismiss.           See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.\n\n        The dissent misses the mark in contending that Arkansas’s\n\nstatutory      scheme        is    “similar           in     many     ways       to     that     in\n\nPennsylvania,”        Dissent.       Op.      at     50    n.4,    and    that     state      funds\n\n                                                24\n\fwould not be used to satisfy a judgment against ASLA because,\n\n“in reality,” Arkansas “claims” only ASLA’s “surplus revenues,”\n\nDissent. Op. at 51.         Arkansas does not, “in reality,” “claim”\n\nonly    ASLA’s   “surplus        revenues”     as   revenues    of     the   state.\n\nArkansas law expressly provides that “all moneys” received by\n\nASLA in connection with its lending activities are revenues of\n\nthe state.       Ark. Code Ann. §§ 6-81-118(a)(1), 19-6-103.                     And\n\nArkansas law carefully cabins ASLA’s use of those state revenues\n\nto certain lending costs, id. § 6-81-118(b)-(c), an arrangement\n\nfar    removed    from     the     Pennsylvania      scheme     granting       PHEAA\n\n“discretion[ary]” authority to use its funds for any corporate\n\npurpose, see 24 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 5104(3).\n\n       The dissent also misses the mark in suggesting that our\n\nanalysis here is “directly contrary” to that in Hess v. Port\n\nAuthority    Trans-Hudson        Corp.,    </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117880\"><a href=\"/opinion/117880/hess-v-port-authority-trans-hudson-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>   <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">    (1994),    for    this\n\ncontention ignores crucial differences between the two cases.\n\nWhile ASLA is a corporation created by a single state to further\n\neducational opportunities in that state, the Port Authority in\n\nHess    is   a   bistate    “Compact       Clause    entity”    with     “diffuse”\n\npolitical accountability.            Id. at 42.         Because Congress must\n\nauthorize the creation of such bistate entities, see U.S. Const.\n\nart. 1, § 10, cl. 3, they “owe their existence to [both] state\n\nand federal sovereigns” and so “lack the tight tie to the people\n\nof one State that an instrument of single State has,” Hess, 513\n\n                                          25\n\fU.S. at 42.      For this reason, the Supreme Court recognizes a\n\n“general approach” for Compact Clause entities, like the Port\n\nAuthority, under which a court will “presume” that they are not\n\narms of the state.          Id. at 43.          (Of course, the Court has\n\nestablished     no    similar    “general     approach”     for    state-created\n\ncorporations like ASLA.)\n\n      Notwithstanding this presumption, and even though no state\n\nappropriated     funds    to     the   Port     Authority     or    claimed    the\n\nAuthority’s income as its revenue, the Authority argued that it\n\nwas an arm of a state because it dedicated some of its surplus\n\nto “public projects which the States themselves might otherwise\n\nfinance.”     Id. at 50.        The Supreme Court had little difficulty\n\nrejecting that argument, noting that because the Authority was a\n\nprofitable Compact Clause entity that retained and controlled\n\nits   income,   the    associated      states   would   not   pay    a   judgment\n\nagainst it.     Id. at 51.      ASLA, by contrast, is “an instrument of\n\na single [s]tate,” id. at 43, and state law expressly provides\n\nthat all of its lending income belongs to that state.                         Thus,\n\nstate funds necessarily would be used to pay a judgment against\n\nASLA.   In sum, Hess does not in any way undermine our holding\n\n\n\n\n                                        26\n\fthat this first factor indicates that ASLA is an arm of the\n\nstate. 6\n\n      As   to   the   second   arm-of-the-state     factor,   ASLA    operates\n\nwith little autonomy from Arkansas despite its corporate powers.\n\nState legislative       records   establish      that,   unlike   Pennsylvania\n\nand   Vermont,    Arkansas     provides    its   student   loan    corporation\n\nsubstantial funding. 7         Moreover, the Arkansas Attorney General\n\n\n      6\n        The dissent disputes this conclusion for two additional\nreasons.    Relying on the principle that the “specific governs\nthe general,” Morales, 504 U.S. at 384, the dissent notes that\nonly general statutory provisions –- not those “exclusively\napplicable to ASLA” -– define “cash funds” as “revenues of the\nstate.”    See Dissent. Op. at 48-49.      But the principle of\nstatutory construction on which the dissent relies applies only\nwhere general and specific statutory provisions conflict, or\nwhere a general provision would render a more specific one\nsuperfluous. See RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"801109\"><a href=\"/opinion/801109/radlax-gateway-hotel-llc-v-amalgamated-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2065</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2071 (2012).     The principle finds no footing\nwhere, as here, specific and general statutory provisions do not\nconflict, but rather go hand in hand.      That is, the specific\nprovision defining ASLA’s revenues as “cash funds” is entirely\nconsistent with the general provision declaring that “cash\nfunds” are revenues of the state.\n     The dissent also posits that “the fact that ASLA’s funds\nare held in a segregated fund outside the state treasury\ncounsels against arm-of-state status.” Dissent. Op. at 49. As\na general rule, we agree that such an arrangement would weigh\nagainst holding that an entity is an arm of its state.       But\nArkansas is an exception to this general rule, because state law\nexpressly declares agency income deposited outside the state\ntreasury to be revenue of the state. Ark. Code Ann. § 19-6-103.\nIn contrast to the dissent’s suggestion, see Dissent. Op. at 50\nn.4, ASLA’s statutory scheme thus operates nothing like that\ngoverning PHEAA.\n      7\n       The dissent unconvincingly suggests that this funding is\nirrelevant to the autonomy inquiry because it derives from\nASLA’s own cash funds. Dissent. Op. at 51, 55. But the source\n(Continued)\n                                      27\n\frepresents ASLA in litigation, including the case at hand, and\n\nstate law limits ASLA’s powers in several significant ways.            For\n\nexample, Arkansas subjects ASLA’s use of cash funds to approval\n\nby the General Assembly, Ark. Code Ann. § 19-4-802, and prevents\n\nits sale of bonds “until the bond issue has the written approval\n\nof the Governor after he or she has received the approval of the\n\nState Board of Finance,” id. § 6-81-108.\n\n       Critically, the Governor of Arkansas also appoints every\n\nmember of ASLA’s board of directors.           See id. § 6-81-102(d).\n\n“The fact that all of [an entity’s] decisionmakers are appointed\n\nby the Governor,” we have recognized, “is a key indicator of\n\nstate control.”     Md. Stadium Auth., 407 F.3d at 264; see also,\n\nHoover, 353 F.3d at 307; Kitchen, 286 F.3d at 185; Cash, 242\n\nF.3d at 225.      The dissent all but ignores this fact, claiming\n\ninstead that ASLA is autonomous because its board members serve\n\nfixed terms and may not be removed at will.          Dissent. Op. at 56.\n\nThis   argument   fails.   Even    where   board   members   serve   fixed\n\nterms,    state   authority   to    appoint    all    of     an   entity’s\n\n\n\nof state funds used to support ASLA’s operations matters not.\nWhat matters is whether an entity’s funds belong to the state.\nSee supra at 25-26. In this case, state law expressly provides\nthat they do.     Every dollar ASLA earns through its lending\nactivities becomes a dollar of state revenue “to be used as\nrequired and to be expended only for such purposes and in such\nmanner as determined by law.” Ark. Code Ann. § 19-6-103. That\nArkansas, in its discretion, returns some of this money to ASLA\nto finance its operations does not change that fact.\n\n\n                                   28\n\fdecisionmakers remains powerful evidence of state control.                                 See\n\nMd. Stadium Auth., 407 F.3d at 258, 264 (stressing importance of\n\npower     to    appoint       although    board     members         “serve     five    year\n\nterms”).        Arkansas law, moreover, is equivocal with respect to\n\nthe    governor’s    removal       power.        Indeed,       it   suggests    that       the\n\ngovernor may remove board members simply by selecting new ones,\n\nas    appointments       to   ASLA’s     board    are    for     four-year     terms       “or\n\nuntil a successor is appointed.”                 Ark. Code Ann. § 6-81-102(e).\n\n        Third, with respect to whether ASLA is focused on state\n\nconcerns, Dr. Oberg merely alleges that Arkansas law “allows\n\nASLA to lend to any qualified borrower nationwide” and that ASLA\n\n“can and has entered into contracts with institutions outside\n\nArkansas.”        The operative question, however, is whether ASLA is\n\nprimarily involved with state concerns.                       See Ram Ditta, 822 F.2d\n\nat 459.        And Dr. Oberg has alleged no facts indicating that ASLA\n\nis not primarily involved with the state concern of helping to\n\nfinance higher education for Arkansas residents.                            The dissent,\n\nwhile    conceding       that    student-loan          financing       facilitates         the\n\nimportant state goal of educating youth, maintains that ASLA is\n\nalso    engaged     in    non-state       concerns       like       “the    servicing       of\n\nfederal    student       loans.”         Dissent.       Op.    at    55.      But     ASLA’s\n\nfederal-loan       servicing     work     did    not    begin       until   2012,     so    is\n\nirrelevant to the question whether ASLA was a “person” within\n\n\n\n                                            29\n\fthe meaning of the FCA from 2002 to 2006 when it allegedly\n\nviolated the Act.\n\n       Fourth, as the dissent agrees, Arkansas law plainly treats\n\nASLA as an arm of the state.               ASLA was established by state law\n\nas “the instrumentality of the state charged with a portion of\n\nthe    responsibility         of     the      state     to     provide       educational\n\nopportunities.”         Ark.    Code    Ann.      §    6-81-102(c).        Its   lending\n\nrevenues are statutorily defined as “revenues of the state,” id.\n\n§§ 6-81-118, 19-6-103, and the Supreme Court of Arkansas has\n\ndescribed ASLA as “a state agency created by . . . the 1977 Acts\n\nof    Arkansas,”     Turner    v.

See Dissent. Op. at 58-59.

Oberg did just that by alleging that\n\n                                     38\n\fthe Companies are corporations operating independently of their\n\ncreating states.

Although the arm-of-state inquiry\nhere presents a statutory rather than constitutional question,\nthe principles at stake are the same as in any case raising\nEleventh Amendment issues. If arm-of-state status is a waivable\naffirmative defense when the Eleventh Amendment is directly\nimplicated, so too should it be a waivable affirmative defense\nwhen the Eleventh Amendment is indirectly implicated.      While\n“personhood” is clearly an element of a plaintiff’s claim under\nthe FCA, Oberg, as previously discussed, carried his burden of\ndemonstrating the Loan Companies’ personhood by alleging their\nindependent corporate status.

In that case, the plaintiff brought an FCA action\nagainst an entity – the Regents of the University of California\n– that courts had repeatedly found to be an arm of the state.\nSee id. at 401-02.      The Fifth Circuit did not address the\naffirmative-defense issue, but its affirmance of a Rule 12(b)(6)\ndismissal of the claims against an entity previously found to be\nan arm of the state is consistent with the rule recognized by\nthis court in Goodman that an affirmative defense may be\n(Continued)\n                                        39\n\f                                          III.\n\n      Even if Oberg were somehow required to allege that the Loan\n\nCompanies      are    not   arms     of     their       states,       I    believe       the\n\nallegations of the complaint are still more than sufficient to\n\nwithstand the motion to dismiss.\n\n      As to PHEAA and VSAC, the majority concludes that Oberg’s\n\nallegations     plausibly      establish         that    the    companies         are    not\n\nalter-egos of their creating states.                    Although I agree with the\n\nmajority’s ultimate conclusion as to these defendants, I do not\n\nagree   with    the    majority’s     application          of   the       Rule    12(b)(6)\n\nstandard to the arm-of-state state factors.                     The sufficiency of\n\nthe complaint as to PHEAA and VSAC is not a close question in my\n\nview, and I therefore concur only in the judgment vacating the\n\ndismissal of Oberg’s claims against PHEAA and VSAC.                              While the\n\nquestion is perhaps a bit closer as to the claims against ASLA,\n\nI   nonetheless      believe   the   Oberg       has     plausibly        alleged       facts\n\nestablishing that ASLA is not an arm of the state of Arkansas.\n\nAccordingly, for the reasons set out below, I dissent from the\n\nmajority’s affirmance of the Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal of Oberg’s\n\nclaims against ASLA.\n\n\n\n\nresolved on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion when the facts necessary to\nthe defense appear on the face of the complaint.

See Ark.

See J.A 781-827 (ASLA financial statements).\n\n          ●    ASLA has a line of credit provided by Arkansas.\n     ASLA borrowed $50,000,000 under the line of credit in 2008\n     and repaid the note in full by September 2010.     See J.A.\n     802. ASLA has also borrowed money from a private lender to\n     improve its liquidity, with student loan revenues providing\n     the source of repayment.

Code Ann. § 6-18-118; J.A.\n       412.\n\n            ●    ASLA’s revenues are not deposited into the state\n       treasury,   but   are  deposited  into   various   accounts\n       controlled by ASLA. See Ark. Stat. § 6-81-118(a) & (f).\n\n               ● ASLA’s business activities extend outside the\n       state of Arkansas and include the buying and selling of\n       loan pools on the secondary market and the servicing of\n       loans made directly by the federal government.\n\n            ●    ASLA has borrowed and repaid money from the state\n       of Arkansas, executing a promissory in favor of the state\n       and using its revenues to repay the loan. See J.A. 802.\n\n       These       allegations      are   not    naked       factual    assertions      that\n\nneed    not        be   accepted     as   true,        nor    are      they     mere   legal\n\nconclusions that can be disregarded.                         See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at\n\n678.    Instead, they are specific, detailed factual allegations\n\nthat   paint        a   plausible    picture      of    an    autonomous        corporation\n\noperating          in   the   commercial        sphere       largely     free     of   state\n\n\n                                            46\n\foversight or interference, such that it would not be an affront\n\nto the dignity of Arkansas to permit this action to proceed.\n\n     Accordingly, given the operational independence established\n\nby these allegations, and the financial independence established\n\nby the state-treasury allegations discussed above, I believe it\n\nis at least plausible that ASLA is a “person” within the meaning\n\nof the FCA, not an arm of the state of Arkansas.     See id. (“A\n\nclaim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual\n\ncontent that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference\n\nthat the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”).\n\n\n\n                               IV.\n\n     ASLA, however, makes various arguments about how a judgment\n\ncould affect the state treasury and points to various statutes\n\nindicating that the state has more control over it than Oberg’s\n\nallegations suggest.   In my view, these arguments do not provide\n\na basis for granting the motion to dismiss.   Even after Twombly\n\nand Iqbal, we still must view the properly alleged facts in the\n\nplaintiff’s favor and must give the plaintiff the benefit of all\n\nreasonable inferences that can be drawn from those facts.

Arkansas law requires the revenues from ASLA’s\n\nbusiness activities to be deposited into accounts outside the\n\nstate treasury.     See Ark. Code Ann. § 6-81-118(a), (b) & (f).\n\nUnder provisions of Arkansas law not exclusively applicable to\n\nASLA, all funds required to be deposited somewhere other than\n\nthe state treasury are “‘cash funds’” that are “declared to be\n\nrevenues of the state to be used as required and to be expended\n\nonly for such purposes and in such manner as determined by law.”\n\nArk. Code Ann. § 19-6-103.              Such cash funds must be “budgeted\n\nand proposed expenditures approved by enactments of the General\n\nAssembly.”     Id. § 19-4-802(a).         Relying on these statutes, ASLA\n\ncontends that a judgment against it is, as a practical matter, a\n\n                                         48\n\fjudgment against Arkansas, since all of ASLA’s money is really\n\nthe state’s money under § 19-6-103.\n\n     ASLA’s argument overlooks several important points.               First\n\nof all, as the majority noted in its discussion of PHEAA’s arm-\n\nof-state assertion, the fact that ASLA’s funds are held in a\n\nsegregated fund outside the state treasury counsels against arm-\n\nof-state status.        See Majority Op. at 13-14; see also Burrus,\n\n546 F.3d at 420; Univ. of R.I. v. A.W. Chesterton Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628596\"><a href=\"/opinion/628596/university-of-rhode-island-v-aw-chesterton-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,    1210   (1st   Cir.   1993).    Moreover,   unlike   the   generally\n\napplicable      §   19-6-103,   the    statute   specifically      addressing\n\nASLA’s funds does not declare ASLA’s cash funds to be revenues\n\nof the state, see Ark. Code Ann. § 6-18-118, and nothing in § 6-\n\n18-118 appears to subject ASLA’s use of the funds to wholesale\n\ncontrol by the General Assembly. 3          Instead, § 6-18-118 simply\n\nrequires ASLA’s segregated cash funds to be “used as provided in\n\nthis subchapter” – subchapter 1 of Chapter 81 governing student\n\nloans.     Id. § 6-18-118(b) (emphasis added).          Subchapter 1, in\n\nturn, gives ASLA -- not the state legislature -- nearly complete\n\nauthority over the use of its funds, including the authority to\n\npay expenses arising from its lending activities.            See Ark. Code\n\n     3\n       As the majority recognized when considering PHEAA’s claim,\nthe terms of the statute specifically governing ASLA should be\ngiven priority over the generally applicable § 19-6-103.      See\nMorales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112742\"><a href=\"/opinion/112742/morales-v-trans-world-airlines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 384 (1992)\n(“[I]t is a commonplace of statutory construction that the\nspecific governs the general . . . .”).\n\n\n                                       49\n\fAnn. § 6-81-118(c)(3) & (4) (giving ASLA authority to “use the\n\nproceeds of any bond issues, together with any other available\n\nfunds”      for       “[p]aying       incidental    expenses    in   connection     with\n\nloans”          and    “[p]aying       expenses     of    authorizing     and    issuing\n\nbonds”); id. § 6-81-118(f) (“The revenues not deposited into the\n\nState Treasury shall be deposited into an account or accounts\n\nspecified by resolution of the authority and used for carrying\n\nout the provisions of any resolution, indenture securing bonds\n\nof the authority, or other agreement of the authority under this\n\nsubchapter.”);           id.    §     6-81-124(a)    (requiring      “[a]ll     proceeds\n\nderived from a particular obligation” to be deposited into a\n\n“proceeds fund” to be “expended only on approval of [ASLA]”);\n\nid. § 6-81-124(c)(1) (authorizing funds contained in proceeds\n\nfund       to    be    used     for     “payment    of    the   necessary       expenses,\n\nincluding,            without     limitation,       the    costs     of   issuing     the\n\nauthority’s obligations, incurred by the authority in carrying\n\nout its responsibilities under this subchapter”). 4\n\n\n       4\n       Arkansas’ statutory arrangement thus is similar in many\nways to that in Pennsylvania.    Like Arkansas, Pennsylvania law\nappears to treat the Loan Company’s funds as state funds, see 24\nPa. Cons. Stat. § 5104(3) (requiring PHEAA’s funds to be\ndeposited into state treasury), and to require state approval of\nany expenditure of those funds, see 72 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 307,\nbut the statute specifically governing PHEAA’s operation gives\ncontrol of those funds to the company, see 24 Pa. Cons. Stat.\n§ 5104(3); see Majority Op. at 11-13 (describing operation of\nPennsylvania statutes governing PHEAA).        After considering\nPennsylvania’s statutory structure, the majority concluded that\n(Continued)\n                                             50\n\f     More importantly, however, the fact that Arkansas declares\n\nall of ASLA’s cash funds to be state funds does not conclusively\n\nestablish that the Arkansas state treasury would be affected by\n\na judgment against ASLA in this case.      As shown by the relevant\n\nstatutes and other information in the record, the cash funds\n\n“claimed” by the state consist entirely of revenues generated by\n\nASLA’s lending and other business activities.            And because the\n\nexpenses of those business activities must be paid from the cash\n\nfunds, the funds so claimed by the state in reality consist only\n\nof ASLA’s surplus revenues.\n\n     As the Supreme Court has explained, however, the state-\n\ntreasury factor focuses “not on the use of profits or surplus,\n\nbut rather . . . on losses and debts.”         Hess, 513 U.S. at 51\n\n(emphasis   added)).   “If    the   expenditures   of    the   enterprise\n\nexceed receipts, is the State in fact obligated to bear and pay\n\nthe resulting indebtedness of the enterprise?            When the answer\n\nis ‘No’ -- both legally and practically -- then the Eleventh\n\nAmendment’s core concern is not implicated.”       Id.\n\n     The majority’s assertion that the source of the cash funds\n\nclaimed by Arkansas does not matter because Arkansas claims all\n\n\n\n\nthe state-treasury factor “weighs heavily against holding that\nPHEAA is an arm of the state.” Majority Op. at 14. In my view,\nArkansas’ similar statutory scheme also weighs against arm-of-\nstate status.\n\n\n                                    51\n\fof the cash funds as its own, see Majority Op. at 27-28 n.7,\n\nthus seems directly contrary to the Supreme Court’s analysis in\n\nHess.        Under the majority’s view, a self-supporting entity –\n\nthat       is,    an    entity       that    supports     itself    not     through     state\n\nappropriations             but   through      the     revenues    earned     from     its   own\n\ncommercial activities – is dependent on the state as a matter of\n\nlaw    because         a    state    statute        arguably     declares    the      entity’s\n\nprofits to be revenues of the state.                      The Supreme Court raised a\n\nsuspicious eyebrow at such an argument in Hess, see 513 U.S. at\n\n51 n.21 (observing that “[i]t would indeed heighten a mystery of\n\nlegal evolution were we to spread an Eleventh Amendment cover\n\nover an agency that consumes no state revenues but contributes\n\nto the State’s wealth” (internal quotation marks and alteration\n\nomitted)), and the argument is no more persuasive here.\n\n       Oberg’s          allegations         of   a    self-supporting,          commercially\n\ninsured corporation with tens of millions of dollars in annual\n\nrevenue and access to a $50 million line of credit and other\n\nprivate       loans        provide    a     non-speculative       basis     for   concluding\n\nthat       ASLA   would      not     need    Arkansas’s     help    to    pay     a   judgment\n\nrendered against it. 5                Nothing more need be established at this\n\npoint       in    the      proceedings.          See     Twombly,    550     U.S.      at   555\n\n\n       5\n        Indeed, the financial statements referenced in the\npleadings show that ASLA absorbed an operational loss in 2011\nwithout any financial assistance from the state. See J.A. 790.\n\n\n                                                 52\n\f(“Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief\n\nabove    the     speculative       level.”);         Walters,          684     F.3d    at    439\n\n(plaintiff’s allegations must be sufficient to “advance [his]\n\nclaim across the line from conceivable to plausible”).\n\n                                              B.\n\n       The     state-dignity       factors         of    the     arm-of-state           inquiry\n\ninclude (1) “the degree of autonomy exercised by the entity”;\n\n(2)    “whether     the   entity       is    involved      with        state    concerns      as\n\ndistinct from non-state concerns, including local concerns”; and\n\n(3) “how the entity is treated under state law.”                               Oberg I, 681\n\nF.3d at 580.

Nonetheless,         the    question       at    this\n\nstage of the proceedings is not whether the defendant’s view of\n\n                                              53\n\fthe    issues        is    reasonable,         but     whether       the        plaintiff         has\n\nplausibly alleged an entitlement to relief.                               See, e.g., Butler\n\n702 F.3d at 752 (motion to dismiss “test[s] the sufficiency of a\n\ncomplaint” but “does not resolve contests surrounding the facts,\n\nthe    merits       of     a    claim,    or    the     applicability            of     defenses”\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).                       And in my view, the state-\n\ndignity      factors       do    not    conclusively            establish       that    the       Loan\n\nCompanies are arms of their creating states, notwithstanding the\n\nfact    that    some      of    the    factors       might      reasonably        support         that\n\nconclusion.\n\n       For    example,         Arkansas      appears       to    treat     ASLA    as       a    state\n\nagency.        See Ark. Code Ann. § 6-81-102(c) (describing ASLA an\n\n“an    instrumentality           of    the    state”);          Turner    v.

For    example,   all       members     of    ASLA’s      board    of\n\ndirectors are appointed by the governor, see Ark. Stat. Ann.\n\n§ 6-81-102(d), a fact that clearly provides some indication of\n\nstate    control.         See   Md.   Stadium         Auth.,     407   F.3d    at     264.\n\nArkansas law, however, provides that the board members serve\n\nfixed    terms,     see    Ark.   Stat.        Ann.    §   6-81-102(e),       with      no\n\nsuggestion that they may be removed by the governor at will. 7\n\nSee Edmond v.

Under these circumstances, the gubernatorial-\n\napproval requirement is less indicative of a lack of autonomy\n\nthan it might otherwise be.            In any event, the gubernatorial-\n\napproval requirement does not conclusively establish that ASLA\n\nlacks autonomy.\n\n       Thus, on the record before us, the facts relevant to the\n\nstate-dignity        factors   cut    both   ways,     with    some   supporting\n\nOberg’s claim that ASLA is not an arm of the state, and others\n\nsupporting      ASLA’s     contrary     claim.         But     because   Oberg’s\n\nallegations on this point more than satisfy the Iqbal-Twombly\n\nplausibility requirement, ASLA’s arguments provide no basis for\n\naffirming the dismissal of Oberg’s claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                        58\n\f                                          V.\n\n      As is apparent from the arm-of-state test itself and the\n\nnature of the considerations it entails, whether a state-created\n\nentity is so closely connected to its creating state that it\n\nshould be permitted to share in the state’s immunity from suit\n\ngenerally      is    a    fact-intensive          inquiry       dependent        on     an\n\nunderstanding of the actual operations of the entity and the\n\nactual relationship        between       the    entity    and    the    state.        See,\n\ne.g.,    Hess,      513   U.S.      at     49     (considering          the     entity’s\n\n“anticipated        and   actual        financial        independence         (emphasis\n\nadded)); Hoover, 535 F.3d at 303 (“The line separating a State-\n\ncreated entity functioning independently of the State from a\n\nState-created entity functioning as an arm of the State or its\n\nalter    ego   is   determined     by    the    particular       legal    and    factual\n\ncircumstances of the entity itself.” (emphasis added)); Gray, 51\n\nF.3d at 434 (remanding case to the district court because it was\n\n“in   the   best    position   to    address      in     the    first    instance      the\n\ncompeting questions of fact and state law necessary to resolve\n\nthe     eleventh     amendment      issue”        (internal       quotation        marks\n\nomitted)).

In my\n\n                                          59\n\fview, this case is one of the typical cases that cannot be\n\nresolved on the pleadings.              Indeed, the inconclusive nature of\n\nmost of the state-dignity factors highlights this very problem.\n\nWe have no information about the actual operations of the Loan\n\nCompanies   or     the     actual    amount      of   control     and     oversight\n\nexercised by the states and thus cannot determine the actual\n\nnature of the relationship between the Loan Companies and their\n\ncreating states.\n\n      Nonetheless,       the    facts    as     alleged    by    Oberg    plausibly\n\nestablish that the state treasuries will not be affected by a\n\njudgment against the Loan Companies and that the Loan Companies\n\nare   sufficiently   independent         from    their    creating     states     that\n\npermitting this action to proceed would not be an affront to the\n\ndignity of the states.           To require anything more at this stage\n\nof the proceedings is to ignore the purpose and scope of a\n\nmotion to dismiss, which is to test the facial sufficiency of\n\nthe   complaint,     not       resolve    contests       about   the     merits    or\n\napplicable defenses.
